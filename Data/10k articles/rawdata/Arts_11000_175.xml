The year '''1965 in film''' involved some significant events, with ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' topping the U.S. box office.

==Events==
* February 15 - [[George Stevens]]' production of ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'', a retelling of the account of [[Jesus Christ]], premieres in [[New York City, New York]]. It was such a flop with critics and audiences that its failure discouraged production of religious epics for many years. It is considered notable in the 21st century for its astonishing landscapes, powerful and provocative cinematography, [[Max von Sydow]]'s debut acting performance in an American film, and the final film performance of [[Claude Rains]].
* March 2 - The [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] film adaptation of ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'', directed by [[Robert Wise]] and starring [[Julie Andrews]] and [[Christopher Plummer]], premieres. It quickly became a worldwide phenomenon and an instant classic. It successfully displaced ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' to become, at the time, [[List of highest-grossing films in Canada and the United States#Adjusted for ticket-price inflation|the highest-grossing film of all-time]]. ''The Sound of Music'' is credited as the film that saved and restored [[Twentieth Century-Fox]] from bankruptcy after it suffered from extremely high production costs and low revenue of ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' two years prior.
* July 1 - [[Blake Edwards]]'s epic comedy ''[[The Great Race]],'' starring [[Tony Curtis]], [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Natalie Wood]], [[Peter Falk]], and [[Keenan Wynn]], premieres. Initially a flop with critics and audiences, some do admire Edwards' direction, the acting by its ensemble cast, [[Henry Mancini]]'s music and its climactic pie fight.
* December 22 - [[David Lean]]'s film adaptation of [[Boris Pasternak]]'s ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]'', starring [[Omar Sharif]], [[Julie Christie]], [[Rod Steiger]], and [[Alec Guinness]], premieres and, like ''The Sound of Music'', quickly became a worldwide phenomenon. Its moral story and message of a love and human spirit that defied the communist Soviet Union have made the film a true classic with critics and audiences. It was included among top films by the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|American Film Institute]]. In a decade of very difficult times for its studio, ''Zhivago'' became the most successful and acclaimed [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film since ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]];'' it was the greatest MGM film since ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]''.

'''Aesthetics''' ({{IPAc-en|ɛ|s|ˈ|θ|ɛ|t|ɪ|k|s|,_|i:|s|-}}) is a branch of [[philosophy]] that explores the nature of [[art]], [[beauty]], and [[taste (sociology)|taste]], with the creation and appreciation of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Aesthetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its more technical [[Epistemology|epistemological]] perspective, it is defined as the study of subjective and [[senses|sensori-emotional values]], sometimes called [[judgement|judgment]]s of [[Feeling|sentiment]] and taste.&lt;ref&gt;Zangwill, Nick. "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetic-judgment/ Aesthetic Judgment]", ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', 02-28-2003/10-22-2007. Retrieved 07-24-2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Aesthetics studies how artists imagine, create and perform works of art; how people use, enjoy, and criticize art; and what happens in their minds when they look at paintings, listen to music, or read poetry, and understand what they see and hear. It also studies how they feel about art—why they like some works and not others, and how art can affect their moods, beliefs, and attitude toward life.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Munro, "Aesthetics", The World Book Encyclopedia, Vol. 1, ed. A. Richard Harmet, et. al., (Chicago: Merchandise Mart Plaza, 1986), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

More broadly, scholars in the field define aesthetics as "critical reflection on art, culture and [[nature]]".&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1998) p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/adx.18.2.27949030|title =  Review of ''ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AESTHETICS 4 vol.''

==Etymology==
The word ''aesthetic'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang |grc|αἰσθητικός}} (''aisthetikos'', meaning "esthetic, sensitive, sentient, pertaining to sense perception"), which in turn was derived from αἰσθάνομαι (''aisthanomai'', meaning "I perceive, feel, sense" and related to {{lang |grc|αἴσθησις}} (''aisthēsis'', "sensation").&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD |aesthetic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "aesthetics" was appropriated and coined with new meaning by the German philosopher [[Alexander Baumgarten]] in his dissertation ''Meditationes philosophicae de nonnullis ad poema pertinentibus'' ("Philosophical considerations of some matters pertaining the poem") in 1735;&lt;ref name= "Guyer 2005"&gt;{{cite book |last = Guyer |first =Paul |title= Values of Beauty: Historical Essays in Aesthetics |date= 13 June 2005 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 0-521-60669-1 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=Bje-QgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Baumgarten chose "aesthetics" because he wished to emphasize the experience of art as a means of knowing. Aesthetics, a not very tidy intellectual discipline, is a heterogeneous collection of problems that concern the arts primarily but also relate to nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = George | last = T. Dickie | title = aesthetics | work = Encyclopedia Americana | volume = 1 | editor1-first = Barbara | editor1-last = Letta Cole | editor2 = et. al. | place = Danbury | publisher = Grolier | year = 1993 | page = 234}}.&lt;/ref&gt; even though his later definition in the fragment ''Aesthetica'' (1750) is more often referred to as the first definition of modern aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = N | last = Wilson | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8pXhAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21 | title = Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece | page = 20 | publisher = Routledge | date = 31 Oct 2013 | ISBN = 1-136-78800-X | accessdate = 2015-05-12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetics and the philosophy of art==
{{quotation|Aesthetics is for the artist as [[Ornithology]] is for the birds.|[[Barnett Newman]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barnettnewman.org/chronology.php Barnett Newman Foundation, Chronology, 1952] Retrieved 30 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Abuse of Beauty: Aesthetics and the Concept of Art'', By Arthur Coleman Danto, p.1, Published by Open Court Publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8126-9540-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8126-9540-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For some, aesthetics is considered a synonym for the philosophy of art since [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], while others insist that there is a significant distinction between these closely related fields. In practice, aesthetic judgement refers to the sensory contemplation or appreciation of an object (not necessarily an [[art object]]), while artistic judgement refers to the recognition, appreciation or criticism of art or an [[work of art|art work]].

Philosophical aesthetics has not only to speak about art and to produce judgments about art works, but also has to give a [[definition]] of what art is. Art is an [[autonomous]] entity for philosophy, because art deals with the [[senses]] (i. e. the etymology of aesthetics) and art is as such free of any moral or political purpose. Hence, there are two different conceptions of art in aesthetics: art as [[knowledge]] or art as action, but aesthetics is neither [[epistemology]] nor ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Annemarie Gethmann-Siefert]], ''Introduction to Aesthetics'' (''Einführung in die Ästhetik''), Munich, Wilhelm Fink, 1995, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aestheticians compare historical developments with theoretical approaches to the arts of many periods. They study the varieties of art in relation to their physical, social, and culture environments. Aestheticians also use psychology to understand how people see, hear, imagine, think, learn, and act in relation to the materials and problems of art. Aesthetic psychology studies the creative process and the aesthetic experience.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Munro, "aesthetics", The World Book Encyclopedia, Vol. 1, ed. A. Richard Harmet, et. al., (Chicago: Merchandise Mart Plaza, 1986), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetic judgment, universals and ethics==

===Aesthetic judgment&lt;!--'Aesthetic judgment' redirects here--&gt;===

Aesthetics examines our [[Bloom's taxonomy#The affective domain (emotion-based)|affective domain]] response to an object or phenomenon Judgments of aesthetic value rely on our ability to discriminate at a sensory level. However, '''aesthetic judgments'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; usually go beyond sensory discrimination.

For [[David Hume]], delicacy of taste is not merely "the ability to detect all the ingredients in a composition", but also our sensitivity "to pains as well as pleasures, which escape the rest of mankind."&lt;ref&gt;David Hume, ''Essays Moral, Political, Literary'', Indianapolis: Literary Fund, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the sensory discrimination is linked to capacity for [[pleasure]].

For [[Immanuel Kant]]  (''[[Critique of Judgment]]'', 1790), "enjoyment" is the result when pleasure arises from sensation, but [[The Critique of Judgment|judging something]] to be "beautiful" has a third requirement: sensation must give rise to pleasure by engaging our capacities of reflective contemplation. Judgments of beauty are sensory, emotional and intellectual all at once. Kant (1790) observed of a man "If he says that canary wine is agreeable he is quite content if someone else corrects his terms and reminds him to say instead: It is agreeable to ''me''," because "Everyone has his own ([[sense]] of) [[taste]]". The case of "beauty" is different from mere "agreeableness" because, "If he proclaims something to be beautiful, then he requires the same liking from others; he then judges not just for himself but for everyone, and speaks of beauty as if it were a property of things." [[Roger Scruton]] has argued similarly.

Viewer interpretations of beauty may on occasion be observed to possess two concepts of value: aesthetics and taste. Aesthetics is the philosophical notion of beauty. Taste is a result of an education process and awareness of elite cultural values learned through exposure to [[mass culture]]. Bourdieu examined how the elite in society define the aesthetic values like taste and how varying levels of exposure to these values can result in variations by class, cultural background, and education.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre (1984). Distinction. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-674-21277-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kant, beauty is subjective and universal; thus certain things are beautiful to everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetic-judgment/|title=Aesthetic Judgment|publisher=|accessdate=|last = Zangwill|first = Nick|work = The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date = 26 August 2014|editor-last = Zalta|editor-first = Edward N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the opinion of [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], there are six conditions for the presentation of art: beauty, form, representation, reproduction of reality, artistic expression and innovation. However, one may not be able to pin down these qualities in a work of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Władysław|last = Tatarkiewicz|title = A History of Six Ideas: an essay in aesthetics |date = 1980|url = https://books.google.com/books/about/A_history_of_six_ideas.html?id=eD4qAQAAMAAJ|publisher=PWN/Polish Scientific Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Factors involved in aesthetic judgment====
[[File:Double-alaskan-rainbow.jpg|thumb|[[Rainbow]]s often have aesthetic appeal.]]

Judgments of aesthetical values seem often to involve many other kinds of issues as well. Responses such as disgust show that sensory detection is linked in [[instinct]]ual ways to [[facial expression]]s, and even behaviours like the [[gag reflex]]. Yet disgust can often be a learned or cultural issue too; as Darwin pointed out, seeing a stripe of soup in a man's beard is disgusting even though neither [[soup]] nor [[beard]]s are themselves disgusting. Aesthetic judgments may be linked to emotions or, like emotions, partially embodied in our physical reactions. For example, the [[awe]] inspired by a [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] landscape might physically manifest with an increased heart-rate or pupil dilation; physiological reaction may express or even cause the initial awe. As seen, emotions are conformed to 'cultural' reactions, therefore aesthetics is always characterized by 'regional responses', as Francis Grose was the first to affirm in his ‘Rules for Drawing Caricaturas: With an Essay on Comic Painting’ (1788), published in W. Hogarth, The Analysis of Beauty, Bagster, London s.d. (1791? [1753]), pp.&amp;nbsp;1–24. Grose can therefore be claimed to be the first critical 'aesthetic regionalist' in proclaiming the anti-universality of aesthetics in contrast to the perilous and always resurgent dictatorship of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Yvonne|last = Bezrucka|title = The Invention of Northern Aesthetics in 18th-Century English Literature |date = 2017|url = http://www.cambridgescholars.com/the-invention-of-northern-aesthetics-in-18th-century-english-literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, aesthetic judgments may be culturally conditioned to some extent. [[Victorian Era|Victorians]] in Britain often saw [[African sculpture]] as ugly, but just a few decades later, [[Edwardian Era|Edwardian]] audiences saw the same sculptures as being beautiful. Evaluations of beauty may well be linked to desirability, perhaps even to [[Human sexuality|sexual]] desirability. Thus, judgments of [[Architectural design values|aesthetic value]] can become linked to judgments of economic, political, or [[morality|moral]] value.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and [[Industrial design]]: How attitudes, orientations, and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a current context, one might judge a [[Lamborghini]] to be beautiful partly because it is desirable as a status symbol, or we might judge it to be repulsive partly because it signifies for us over-consumption and offends our political or moral values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last = Korsmeyer |editor-first = Carolyn |title =Aesthetics: The Big Questions|date = 1998|publisher =Wiley-Blackwell |isbn = 978-0631205944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aesthetic judgments can often be very fine-grained and internally contradictory. Likewise aesthetic judgments seem often to be at least partly intellectual and interpretative. It is what a thing means or symbolizes for us that is often what we are judging. Modern aestheticians have asserted that [[free will|will]] and [[Desire (emotion)|desire]] were almost dormant in aesthetic experience, yet [[preference]] and [[choice]] have seemed important aesthetics to some 20th-century thinkers. The point is already made by [[David Hume|Hume]], but see Mary Mothersill, "Beauty and the Critic's Judgment", in The Blackwell Guide to Aesthetics, 2004. Thus aesthetic judgments might be seen to be based on the senses, emotions, intellectual opinions, will, desires, culture, preferences, values, subconscious behaviour, conscious decision, training, instinct, sociological institutions, or some complex combination of these, depending on exactly which theory one employs.

A third major topic in the study of aesthetic judgments is how they are unified across art forms. For instance, the source of a painting's beauty has a different character to that of beautiful music, suggesting their aesthetics differ in kind.&lt;ref&gt;Consider Clement Greenberg's arguments in "On Modernist Painting" (1961), reprinted in Aesthetics: A Reader in Philosophy of Arts.&lt;/ref&gt; The distinct inability of language to express aesthetic judgment and the role of [[Social constructionism|Social construction]] further cloud this issue.

===Aesthetic universals===
The philosopher [[Denis Dutton]] identified six universal signatures in human aesthetics:&lt;ref name="Dutton"&gt;[[Denis Dutton]]'s ''Aesthetic Universals'' summarized by [[Steven Pinker]] in ''[[The Blank Slate]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

# Expertise or virtuosity. Humans cultivate, recognize, and admire technical artistic skills.
# Nonutilitarian pleasure. People enjoy art for art's sake, and do not demand that it keep them warm or put food on the table.
# [[Style (visual arts)|Style]]. Artistic objects and performances satisfy rules of composition that place them in a recognizable style.
# Criticism. People make a point of judging, appreciating, and interpreting works of art.
# Imitation. With a few important exceptions like abstract painting, works of art simulate experiences of the world.
# Special focus. Art is set aside from ordinary life and made a dramatic focus of experience.

Artists such as Hirschhorn have indicated that there are too many exceptions to Dutton's categories. For example, the installations of the contemporary artist [[Thomas Hirschhorn]] deliberately eschew technical virtuosity. People can appreciate a Renaissance [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] for aesthetic reasons, but such objects often had (and sometimes still have) specific devotional functions. "Rules of composition" that might be read into [[Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' or [[John Cage]]'s ''[[4′33″]]'' do not locate the works in a recognizable style (or certainly not a style recognizable at the time of the works' realization). Moreover, some of Dutton's categories seem too broad: a physicist might entertain hypothetical worlds in his/her imagination in the course of formulating a theory. Another problem is that Dutton's categories seek to universalize traditional European notions of aesthetics and art forgetting that, as André Malraux and others have pointed out, there have been large numbers of cultures in which such ideas (including the idea "art" itself) were non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan, ''Art and the Human Adventure: André Malraux's Theory of Art''. (Amsterdam: Rodopi. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetic ethics===
Aesthetic ethics refers to the idea that human conduct and behaviour ought to be governed by that which is beautiful and attractive. [[John Dewey]]&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John. (1932)'Ethics', with James Tufts. In: '' The Collected Works of John Dewey, 1882–1953 '' Edited Jo-Ann Boydston: Carbonsdale: Southern Illinois University Press. p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out that the unity of aesthetics and ethics is in fact reflected in our understanding of behaviour being "fair"—the word having a double meaning of attractive and morally acceptable. More recently, [[James Page (Australian educationist)|James Page]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoagepub.com/products/content/p478d75b79b1ea.php Peace Education - Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations] infoagepub.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/12263/|title=Peace Education : Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations|first=Page, James|last=S.|date=22 October 2017|website=eprints.qut.edu.au|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that aesthetic ethics might be taken to form a philosophical rationale for [[peace education]].

==New Criticism and ''The Intentional Fallacy''==
During the first half of the twentieth century, a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art, including the literary arts and the visual arts, to each other. This resulted in the rise of the [[New Criticism]] school and debate concerning ''the intentional fallacy''. At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist.

In 1946, [[W. K. Wimsatt|William K. Wimsatt]] and [[Monroe Beardsley]] published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled "[[Intentional Fallacy|The Intentional Fallacy]]", in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an [[Authorial intentionality|author's intention]], or "intended meaning" in the analysis of a literary work.  For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting.

In another essay, "[[Affective fallacy|The Affective Fallacy]]," which served as a kind of sister essay to "The Intentional Fallacy" Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader's personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text. This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the [[reader-response]] school of literary theory. One of the leading theorists from this school, [[Stanley Fish]], was himself trained by New Critics. Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his essay "Literature in the Reader" (1970).&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, Vincent B., et al., eds. ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

As summarized by Gaut and Livingston in their essay "The Creation of Art": "Structuralist and post-structuralists theorists and critics were sharply critical of many aspects of New Criticism, beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the so-called autonomy of art, but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms' assumption that the artist's activities and experience were a privileged critical topic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gaut|first1=Berys|last2=  Livingston|first2 = Paisley|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7r27dci51FcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title =The Creation of Art| page = 3|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date =2003|isbn = 9780521812344}}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors contend that: "Anti-intentionalists, such as formalists, hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art. So details of the act of creating a work, though possibly of interest in themselves, have no bearing on the correct interpretation of the work."&lt;ref name="Gaut and Livingston, p.6"&gt;Gaut and Livingston, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaut and Livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from [[Formalism (art)|formalists]] stating that: "Intentionalists, unlike formalists, hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works." They quote [[Richard Wollheim]] as stating that, "The task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process, where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of, but terminating on, the work of art itself."&lt;ref name="Gaut and Livingston, p.6"/&gt;

==Derivative forms of aesthetics==
A large number of derivative forms of aesthetics have developed as contemporary and transitory forms of inquiry associated with the field of aesthetics which include the post-modern, psychoanalytic, scientific, and mathematical among others.

===Post-modern aesthetics and psychoanalysis===
[[File:Duchamp Fountaine.jpg|thumb|left|Example of the [[Dada]] aesthetic, [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''Fountain'' 1917]]

Early-twentieth-century artists, poets and composers challenged existing notions of beauty, broadening the scope of art and aesthetics. In 1941, [[Eli Siegel]], American philosopher and poet, founded [[Aesthetic Realism]], the philosophy that reality itself is aesthetic, and that "The world, art, and self explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green |first=Edward |title=Donald Francis Tovey, Aesthetic Realism and the Need for a Philosophic Musicology |publisher=International Revue of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music |year= 2005 |page= 227 |jstor=30032170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siegel |first= Eli |title=Is Beauty the Making One of Opposites? |publisher=''Journal of Aesthetics &amp; Art Criticism |year= 1955 |jstor=425879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various attempts have been made to define [[Post-Modern]] Aesthetics. The challenge to the assumption that beauty was central to art and aesthetics, thought to be original, is actually continuous with older aesthetic theory; Aristotle was the first in the Western tradition to classify "beauty" into types as in his theory of drama, and Kant made a distinction between beauty and the sublime. What was new was a refusal to credit the higher status of certain types, where the taxonomy implied a preference for tragedy and the sublime to comedy and the [[Rococo]].

[[Benedetto Croce|Croce]] suggested that "expression" is central in the way that beauty was once thought to be central. [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]] suggested that the sociological institutions of the art world were the glue binding art and sensibility into unities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Aesthetic Attitude|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aesth-at/|last = King|first = Alexandra|work = Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marshall McLuhan]] suggested that art always functions as a "counter-environment" designed to make visible what is usually invisible about a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grosswiler|first1=Paul|title=Transforming McLuhan: Cultural, Critical, and Postmodern Perspectives|date=2010|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|isbn=978-1-4331-1067-2|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/?id=I19crS0qJ78C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=mcluhan+on+art+as+counter-environment#v=onepage&amp;q=mcluhan%20on%20art%20as%20counter-environment&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodor Adorno]] felt that aesthetics could not proceed without confronting the role of the culture industry in the commodification of art and aesthetic experience. [[Hal Foster (art critic)|Hal Foster]] attempted to portray the reaction against beauty and Modernist art in ''The Anti-Aesthetic: Essays on Postmodern Culture''. [[Arthur Danto]] has described this reaction as "kalliphobia" (after the Greek word for beauty, κάλλος ''kallos'').&lt;ref&gt;'Kalliphobia in Contemporary Art' in ''Art Journal'' v. 63 no. 2 (Summer 2004) p.&amp;nbsp;24–35&lt;/ref&gt; [[André Malraux]] explains that the notion of beauty was connected to a particular conception of art that arose with the Renaissance and was still dominant in the eighteenth century (but was supplanted later). The discipline of aesthetics, which originated in the eighteenth century, mistook this transient state of affairs for a revelation of the permanent nature of art.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan, ''Art and the Human Adventure, André Malraux's Theory of Art'' (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Massumi]] suggests to reconsider beauty following the aesthetical thought in the philosophy of [[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]].&lt;ref&gt;Massumi, Brian, (ed.), A Shock to Thought. Expression after Deleuze and Guattari. London &amp; NY: Routeledge, 2002. {{ISBN|0-415-23804-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Walter Benjamin echoed Malraux in believing aesthetics was a comparatively recent invention, a view proven wrong in the late 1970s, when Abraham Moles and Frieder Nake analyzed links between beauty, information processing, and information theory. [[Denis Dutton]] in "The Art Instinct" also proposed that an aesthetic sense was a vital evolutionary factor.

[[Jean-François Lyotard]] re-invokes the Kantian distinction between [[taste (sociology)|taste]] and the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]. Sublime painting, unlike [[kitsch]] [[realism (visual arts)|realism]], "...&amp;nbsp;will enable us to see only by making it impossible to see; it will please only by causing pain."&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard, Jean-Françoise, ''What is Postmodernism?'', in ''The Postmodern Condition'', Minnesota and Manchester, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard, Jean-Françoise, ''Scriptures: Diffracted Traces'', in Theory, Culture and Society, Volume 21, Number 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]] inaugurated aesthetical thinking in [[Psychoanalysis]] mainly via the "Uncanny" as aesthetical affect.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund, "The Uncanny" (1919). Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Work of Sigmund Freud, 17:234-36. London: The Hogarth Press&lt;/ref&gt; Following Freud and [[Merleau-Ponty]],&lt;ref&gt;Merleau-Ponty, Maurice (1964), "The Visible and the Invisible". Northwestern University Press. {{ISBN|0-8101-0457-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques Lacan]] theorized aesthetics in terms of sublimation and the Thing.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, Jacques, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis (The Seminar of Jacques Lacan Book VII), NY: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relation of [[Marxist aesthetics]] to post-modern aesthetics is still a contentious area of debate.

===Recent aesthetics===
[[Guy Sircello]] has pioneered efforts in analytic philosophy to develop a rigorous theory of aesthetics, focusing on the concepts of beauty,&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Sircello]], ''A New Theory of Beauty''. Princeton Essays on the Arts, 1. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; love&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Sircello]], ''Love and Beauty''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; and sublimity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Sircello]], "How Is a Theory of the Sublime Possible?" ''The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism''
Vol. 51, No. 4 (Autumn, 1993), pp. 541–550&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to romantic theorists Sircello argued for the objectivity of beauty and formulated a theory of love on that basis.

British philosopher and theorist of [[conceptual art]] aesthetics, [[Peter Osborne (writer and academic)|Peter Osborne]], makes the point that "'[[post-conceptual art]]' aesthetic does not concern a particular type of [[contemporary art]] so much as the historical-[[ontological]] condition for the production of contemporary art in general&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, ''Anywhere Or Not At All: Philosophy of Contemporary Art'', Verso Books, London, 2013. pp. 3 &amp; 51&lt;/ref&gt; Osborne noted that [http://www.fondazioneratti.org/mat/mostre/Contemporary%20art%20is%20post-conceptual%20art%20/Leggi%20il%20testo%20della%20conferenza%20di%20Peter%20Osborne%20in%20PDF.pdf contemporary art is 'post-conceptual] in a public lecture delivered in 2010.

Gary Tedman has put forward a theory of a subjectless aesthetics derived from [[Karl Marx]]'s concept of alienation, and [[Louis Althusser]]'s antihumanism, using elements of Freud's group psychology, defining a concept of the 'aesthetic level of practice'.&lt;ref&gt;Tedman, G. (2012) ''Aesthetics &amp; Alienation'', Zero Books&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gregory Loewen]] has suggested that the subject is key in the interaction with the aesthetic object. The work of art serves as a vehicle for the projection of the individual's identity into the world of objects, as well as being the irruptive source of much of what is uncanny in modern life. As well, art is used to memorialize individuated biographies in a manner that allows persons to imagine that they are part of something greater than themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gregory Loewen]], Aesthetic Subjectivity, 2011 pages&amp;nbsp;36–7, 157, 238)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetics and science===
[[File:Mandel zoom 00 mandelbrot set.jpg|thumb|The [[Mandelbrot set]] with continuously coloured environment]]

The field of [[experimental aesthetics]] was founded by [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]] in the 19th century. Experimental aesthetics in these times had been characterized by a [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]-based, [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] approach. The analysis of individual experience and behaviour based on [[experiment|experimental methods]] is a central part of experimental aesthetics. In particular, the perception of works of art,&lt;ref&gt;Kobbert, M. (1986), ''Kunstpsychologie'' ("Psychology of art"), Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt&lt;/ref&gt; music, or modern items such as websites&lt;ref&gt;Thielsch, M. T. (2008), ''Ästhetik von Websites. Wahrnehmung von Ästhetik und deren Beziehung zu Inhalt, Usability und Persönlichkeitsmerkmalen.'' ("The aesthetics of websites. Perception of aesthetics and its relation to content, usability, and personality traits."), MV Wissenschaft, Münster&lt;/ref&gt; or other IT products&lt;ref&gt;Hassenzahl, M. (2008), ''Aesthetics in interactive products: Correlates and consequences of beauty''. In H. N. J. Schifferstein &amp; P. Hekkert (Eds.): ''Product Experience.'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;287–302). Elsevier, Amsterdam&lt;/ref&gt; is studied. Experimental aesthetics is strongly oriented towards the [[natural science]]s. Modern approaches mostly come from the fields of [[cognitive psychology]] or [[neuroscience]] ([[neuroaesthetics]]&lt;ref&gt;Martindale, C. (2007), ''Recent trends in the psychological study of aesthetics, creativity, and the arts''. In ''Empirical Studies of the Arts'', 25(2), p.&amp;nbsp;121–141.&lt;/ref&gt;).

In the 1970s, [[Abraham Moles]] and [[Frieder Nake]] were among the first to analyze links between aesthetics, [[information processing]], and [[information theory]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Moles: ''Théorie de l'information et perception esthétique'', Paris, Denoël, 1973 ([[Information Theory]] and aesthetical perception)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F Nake (1974). Ästhetik als Informationsverarbeitung. (Aesthetics as [[information processing]]). Grundlagen und Anwendungen der Informatik im Bereich ästhetischer Produktion und Kritik. Springer, 1974, {{ISBN|3-211-81216-4}}, {{ISBN|978-3-211-81216-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] described an [[algorithm]]ic theory of beauty which takes the [[subjectivity]] of the observer into account and postulates: among several observations classified as comparable by a given subjective observer, the aesthetically most pleasing one is the one with the shortest description, given the observer's previous knowledge and his particular method for encoding the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1576418|title=Low-Complexity Art|first=Jürgen|last=Schmidhuber|date=22 October 1997|publisher=|journal=Leonardo|volume=30|issue=2|pages=97–103|accessdate=|doi=10.2307/1576418}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/beauty.html|title=THEORY OF BEAUTY - FACIAL ATTRACTIVENESS - LOW-COMPLEXITY ART|website=www.idsia.ch|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is closely related to the principles of [[algorithmic information theory]] and [[minimum description length]]. One of his examples: [[mathematician]]s enjoy simple proofs with a short description in their [[formal language]]. Another very concrete example describes an aesthetically pleasing human face whose proportions can be described by very few [[bit]]s of information,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Jürgen Schmidhuber|first =Jürgen |last= Schmidhuber |title = Facial beauty and fractal geometry|website = Cogprint Archive|url =http://cogprints.org/690/1/newlocoface.html |deadurl = no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130215106/http://cogprints.org/690/1/newlocoface.html |archivedate=30 November 2012 |date = 7 June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Schmidhuber|J. Schmidhuber]]. Simple Algorithmic Principles of Discovery, Subjective Beauty, Selective Attention, Curiosity &amp; Creativity. Proc. 10th Intl. Conf. on Discovery Science (DS 2007) p.&amp;nbsp;26–38, LNAI 4755, Springer, 2007. Also in Proc. 18th Intl. Conf. on Algorithmic Learning Theory (ALT 2007) p. 32, LNAI 4754, Springer, 2007. Joint invited lecture for DS 2007 and ALT 2007, Sendai, Japan, 2007. {{arxiv|0709.0674}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing inspiration from less detailed 15th century proportion studies by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Albrecht Dürer]]. Schmidhuber's theory explicitly distinguishes between what's [[Beauty|beautiful]] and what's [[interesting]], stating that interestingness corresponds to the [[first derivative]] of subjectively perceived beauty. Here the premise is that any observer continually tries to improve the [[predictability]] and [[compressibility]] of the observations by discovering regularities such as repetitions and [[symmetries]] and [[fractal]] [[self-similarity]]. Whenever the observer's learning process (which may be a predictive [[artificial neural network]]; see also [[Neuroesthetics]]) leads to improved data compression such that the observation sequence can be described by fewer [[bit]]s than before, the temporary [[interest (emotion)|interest]]ingness of the data corresponds to the number of saved bits. This compression progress is proportional to the observer's internal reward, also called curiosity reward. A [[reinforcement learning]] algorithm is used to maximize future expected reward by learning to execute action sequences that cause additional [[interesting]] input data with yet unknown but learnable predictability or regularity. The principles can be implemented on artificial agents which then exhibit a form of [[Artificial intelligence|artificial]] [[curiosity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Schmidhuber|J. Schmidhuber]].

===Truth in beauty and mathematics===
Mathematical considerations, such as [[symmetry]] and [[complexity]], are used for analysis in theoretical aesthetics. This is different from the aesthetic considerations of [[applied aesthetics]] used in the study of [[mathematical beauty]]. Aesthetic considerations such as [[symmetry]] and [[Occam's razor|simplicity]] are used in areas of philosophy, such as [[Categorical imperative|ethics]] and [[theoretical physics]] and [[cosmology]] to [[define]] [[truth]], outside of [[empirical]] considerations. Beauty and [[Truth]] have been argued to be nearly synonymous,&lt;ref&gt;Why Beauty Is Truth: The History of Symmetry, [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]], 2008&lt;/ref&gt; as reflected in the statement "Beauty is truth, truth beauty" in the poem [[Ode on a Grecian Urn]] by [[John Keats]], or by the Hindu motto "Satyam Shivam Sundaram" (Satya (Truth) is Shiva (God), and Shiva is Sundaram (Beautiful)). The fact that judgments of beauty and judgments of truth both are influenced by [[processing fluency]], which is the ease with which information can be processed, has been presented as an explanation for why beauty is sometimes equated with truth.&lt;ref&gt;Reber, R, [[Norbert Schwarz|Schwarz, N]], Winkielman, P: "Processing fluency and aesthetic pleasure: Is beauty in the perceiver's processing experience?", ''Personality and Social Psychology Review'', 8(4):364-382&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, recent research found that people use beauty as an indication for truth in mathematical pattern tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Reber, R, Brun, M, Mitterndorfer, K: "The use of heuristics in intuitive mathematical judgment", ''Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review'', 15(6):1174–1178&lt;/ref&gt; However, scientists including the mathematician [[David Orrell]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Orrell |first=David |title=Truth or Beauty: Science and the Quest for Order  |location=New Haven|publisher=Yale University Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-300-18661-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and physicist [[Marcelo Gleiser]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gleiser|first=Marcelo |title=A Tear at the Edge of Creation: A Radical New Vision for Life in an Imperfect Universe |publisher=Free Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4391-0832-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that the emphasis on aesthetic criteria such as symmetry is equally capable of leading scientists astray.

===Computational approaches===
In 1928, the mathematician [[George David Birkhoff]] created an aesthetic measure ''M = O/C'' as the ratio of order to complexity.&lt;ref name="Akiba2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Akiba|first1=Fuminori|title=Preface: Natural Computing and Computational Aesthetics|journal=Natural Computing and Beyond|volume=6|date=2013|pages=117–118|doi=10.1007/978-4-431-54394-7_10|series=Proceedings in Information and Communications Technology|isbn=978-4-431-54393-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since about 2005, computer scientists have attempted to develop automated methods to infer aesthetic quality of images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first1=R. |last1=Datta |first2=D. |last2=Joshi |first3=J. |last3=Li |first4=J. |last4=Wang |title=Studying aesthetics in photographic images using a computational approach |booktitle=Europ.

There have also been relatively successful attempts with regard to chess{{explain|date=October 2018}} and music.&lt;ref&gt;Manaris, B., Roos, P., Penousal, M., Krehbiel, D., Pellicoro, L. and Romero, J.; A Corpus-Based Hybrid Approach to Music Analysis and Composition; Proceedings of 22nd Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-07); Vancouver, BC; 839-845 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A relation between [[Max Bense]]'s mathematical formulation of aesthetics in terms of "redundancy" and "complexity" and theories of musical anticipation was offered using the notion of Information Rate.&lt;ref&gt;Dubnov, S.; Musical Information Dynamics as Models of Auditory Anticipation; in Machine Audition: Principles, Algorithms and Systems, Ed. W. Weng, IGI Global publication, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary aesthetics===
{{main|Evolutionary aesthetics}}
Evolutionary aesthetics refers to [[evolutionary psychology]] theories in which the basic aesthetic preferences of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' are argued to have [[evolution|evolved]] in order to enhance survival and reproductive success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shimura|first1=Arthur P.|last2=Palmer|first2=Stephen E.|title=Aesthetic Science: Connecting Minds, Brains, and Experience|date=January 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example being that humans are argued to find beautiful and prefer [[landscape]]s which were good [[habitat]]s in the ancestral environment. Another example is that body symmetry and proportion are important aspects of [[physical attractiveness]] which may be due to this indicating good health during body growth. Evolutionary explanations for aesthetical preferences are important parts of [[evolutionary musicology]], [[Darwinian literary studies]], and the study of the [[evolution of emotion]].

===Applied aesthetics===
{{Main|Applied aesthetics}}

As well as being applied to art, aesthetics can also be applied to cultural objects, such as crosses or tools. For example, aesthetic coupling between art-objects and medical topics was made by speakers working for the US Information Agency&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Giannini AJ |title=Tangential symbols: using visual symbolization to teach pharmacological principles of drug addiction to international audiences |journal=Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume=33 |issue=12 |pages=1139–46 |date=December 1993 |pmid=7510314 |doi=10.1002/j.1552-4604.1993.tb03913.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Art slides were linked to slides of pharmacological data, which improved attention and retention by simultaneous activation of intuitive right brain with rational left. It can also be used in topics as diverse as [[Mathematical beauty|mathematics]], [[gastronomy]], fashion and website design.&lt;ref&gt;Moshagen, M. &amp; Thielsch, M. T. (2010). Facets of visual aesthetics. In: ''International Journal of Human-Computer Studies'', 68 (10), 689-709.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/visual_aesthetics.html |title=Visual Aesthetics |publisher=Interaction-design.org |date= |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lavie, T. &amp; Tractinsky, N. (2004). Assessing dimensions of perceived visual aesthetics of web sites. International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 60, 269–298.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The philosophy of aesthetics as a practice has been criticized by some sociologists and writers of art and society. [[Raymond Williams]] argues that there is no unique and or individual aesthetic object which can be extrapolated from the art world, but that there is a continuum of cultural forms and experience of which ordinary speech and experiences may signal as art. By "art" we may frame several artistic "works" or "creations" as so though this reference remains within the institution or special event which creates it and this leaves some works or other possible "art" outside of the frame work, or other interpretations such as other phenomenon which may not be considered as "art".{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[Pierre Bourdieu]] disagrees with Kant's idea of the "aesthetic". He argues that Kant's "aesthetic" merely represents an experience that is the product of an elevated class habitus and scholarly leisure as opposed to other possible and equally valid "aesthetic" experiences which lay outside Kant's narrow definition.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Timothy Laurie argues that theories of musical aesthetics "framed entirely in terms of appreciation, contemplation or reflection risk idealizing an implausibly unmotivated listener defined solely through musical objects, rather than seeing them as a person for whom complex intentions and motivations produce variable attractions to cultural objects and practices".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title= Music Genre As Method | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | newspaper= Cultural Studies Review | year= 2014 | url= https://www.academia.edu/9087511}} 20 (2), pp.&amp;nbsp;283–292.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alphonse de Neuville''' (31 May 1835{{snd}}18 May 1885) was a French [[Academic]] [[Painting|painter]] who studied under [[Eugène Delacroix]]. His dramatic and intensely patriotic subjects illustrated episodes from the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the [[Crimean War]], the [[Zulu War]] and portraits of soldiers. Some of his works have been collected by the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] and by the [[Metropolitan Museum]] in [[New York City|New York]].

==Early life==
Born Alphonse-Marie-Adolphe Deneuville to wealthy parents at [[Saint-Omer]], [[Pas-de-Calais]], earned his degree of ''bachelier ès-lettres'', and in spite of family opposition, he entered (1856) the naval school at [[Lorient]]; it was there that his artistic instincts started.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He was discouraged by several painters of repute, but he was admitted to work in the studio of [[François-Edouard Picot]]; he did not remain there long. He was painting by himself when he produced his first picture, ''The Fifth Battalion of Chasseurs at the Gervais Battery'' (Malakoff). In 1860 Neuville painted an ''Episode of the taking of Naples by [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]]'' for the Artists' Club in the [[rue de Provence]], and sent to the [[Paris Salon]] in 1861 ''The Guard Chasseurs in the Trenches of the Mamelon Vert''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Neuville, Alphonse Marie de|volume=19|page=450}} This cites Montrosier, ''Les Peintres militaires'' (Paris, 1881), "De Neuville," in ''Gazette des beaux arts'' (Paris, 1885).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illustrator and military artist==
He participated in illustrating the [[Pierre-Jules Hetzel|Hetzel]] editions of ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]''. He also illustrated ''Le Tour du monde'' and [[François Guizot|Guizot]]'s ''History of France''. At the same time he painted a number of remarkable pictures: ''The Attack in the Streets of Magenta by Zouaves and the Light Horse'' (1864), ''A Zouave Sentinel'' (1865), ''The Battle of San Lorenzo'' (1867), and ''Dismounted Cavalry crossing the Tchernaia'' (1869). In these he showed peculiar insight into military life.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

His full power was reached after the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870&amp;ndash;71. The long-term French reaction was [[Revanchism]]: a deep sense of bitterness, hatred and demand for revenge against Germany, especially because of the loss of Alsace and Lorraine.&lt;ref&gt;Karine Varley, ''Under the Shadow of Defeat: The War of 1870-71 in French Memory'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Paintings that emphasized the humiliation of the defeat came in high demand, such as "the Spy" by de Neuville.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Jay, "Alphonse de Neuville's 'The Spy' and the Legacy of the Franco-Prussian War," ''Metropolitan Museum Journal'' (1984) 19: pp. 151-162 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1512817 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;


He then aimed at depicting in his works the episodes of that war, and began by representing the ''Bivouac before Le Bourget'' (1872). His fame spread rapidly, and was increased by ''[[The Last Cartridges (painting)|The Last Cartridges]]'' (1873), memorializing [[Battle of Bazeilles|an episode]] involving the [[Blue Division (Second French Empire)|Blue Division]] of the French marines, in which it is easy to discern the vast difference between the conventional treatment of military subjects, as practised by [[Horace Vernet]], and that of a man who had lived the life that he painted.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In 1874 the ''Fight on a Railroad'' was not less successful, and was followed by the ''Attack on a House at Villersexel'' (1875) and the ''Railway Bridge at Styring'' (1877). In 1878 the painter exhibited (not at the [[Great Exhibition]]) ''[[Le Bourget]]'', the ''Surprise at Daybreak'', ''The Intercepted Despatch-bearer'', and a considerable number of drawings. He also exhibited in [[London]] some episodes of the [[Zulu War]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Fifty thousand people paid to see his impression of ''The Defence of Rorke's Drift'' (1880), which the infant Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney paid a large sum to acquire.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In 1881 he was made an officer of the [[Légion d'honneur]] for ''The Cemetery of Saint-Privat'' and ''The Despatch-bearer'' and the "Huns in the [[Battle of Chalon]]". During these years Neuville was at work with [[Édouard Detaille]] on an important though less artistic work, ''The Panorama of Rézonville''.  Neuville died in [[Paris]] on May 18, 1885. At the sale of his works the state purchased for the [[Palais du Luxembourg]] the ''Bourget'' and the ''Attack on a Barricaded House'', with a watercolor ''The Parley'', and a drawing of a ''Turco in Fighting Trim''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

'''Andres Serrano''' (born August 15, 1950) is an American [[photographer]] and artist who has become famous through his photos of corpses and his use of feces and bodily fluids in his work, notably his controversial work ''[[Piss Christ]]'', a red-tinged photograph of a [[crucifix]] submerged in a glass container of what was purported to be the artist's own [[urine]]. He is also notable for creating the artwork for the heavy metal band [[Metallica]]'s ''[[Load (album)|Load]]'' and ''[[Reload (Metallica album)|Reload]]'' albums.

==Career==
[[File:Andres Serrano cropped.jpg|left|thumb|Serrano in 2010 at [[Michael Musto]]'s ''[[Village Voice]]'' 25th Anniversary party]]
He worked as an assistant art director at an advertising firm, before creating his first works in 1983.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt;

His work has been exhibited in diverse locations around the world including the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] [[Cathedral of Saint John the Divine]] in New York City, ''World without end (2001)'', and a retrospective at the [[Barbican Arts Centre]] in London, ''Body and soul (2001)''.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt;

His exhibitions have often inspired angry reactions. On October 5, 2007, his group of photographs called ''The History of Sex'' were on display and several were vandalized at an art gallery in [[Lund]], Sweden by people who were believed to be part of a [[neo-Nazi]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/09/arts/design/09serr.html |title=Gallery Vandals Destroy Photos |author=Carol Vogel |date=October 9, 2007 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=April 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 16, 2011, after two weeks of protests and a campaign of [[hate mail]] and abusive phone calls to an art gallery displaying his work, orchestrated by groups of [[French Catholicism|French Catholic]] fundamentalists, approximately a thousand people marched through the streets of [[Avignon]], to protest outside the gallery. On April 17, 2011, two of his works, ''Piss Christ'' and ''The Church'', were vandalized. The gallery director plans to reopen the museum with the damaged works on show "so people can see what barbarians can do".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/18/andres-serrano-piss-christ-destroyed-christian-protesters |title=Attack on 'blasphemous' art work fires debate on role of religion in France |author=Angelique Chrisafis |date=April 18, 2011 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=April 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
Serrano usually makes large prints of about {{convert|20|by|30|in|cm}}. He has shot an array of subject matter including portraits of [[Ku Klux Klan|Klansmen]], morgue photos, and pictures of burn victims. He went into the [[New York City Subway]] with lights and photographic background paper to portray the bedraggled homeless, as well as producing some rather tender but sometimes decidedly kinky portraits of couples. One of these last shows what Adrian Searle of ''[[The Guardian]]'' described as "a young couple, she with a strap-on dildo, he with a mildly expectant expression."&lt;ref name="negener"&gt;Searle, Adrian.

Many of Serrano's pictures involve bodily fluids in some way—depicting, for example, blood (sometimes [[menstrual cycle|menstrual]] blood), [[semen]] (for example, ''Blood and Semen II'' (1990)) or human female milk. Within this series are a number of works in which objects are submerged in bodily fluids. Most famous of these is ''[[Piss Christ]]'' (1987), a photograph of a plastic crucifix submerged in a glass of the artist's own urine. This caused great controversy when first exhibited. The work was sold for $277,000 in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5070403 Auction Results: Andres Serrano's ''Piss Christ'']&lt;/ref&gt; which was far beyond the estimated $20,000 – $30,000. Serrano, alongside other artists such as [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], [[Barbara Degenevieve|Barbara DeGenevieve]], and [[Merry Alpern]],  became a figure whom [[Senator Jesse Helms]], and [[Alphonse D'Amato|Senator Alfonse D'Amato]], as well as other cultural conservatives, attacked for producing offensive art while others, including ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/08/arts/review-art-andres-serrano-provocation-and-spirituality.html|title=Andres Serrano: Provocation And Spirituality|last=Brenson|first=Michael|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=December 8, 1989|accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; defended him in the name of [[freedom of speech|artistic freedom]]. (See the American "[[culture war]]s" of the 1990s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/03/arts/endowment-ends-program-helping-individual-artists.html|title=Endowment Ends Program Helping Individual Artists|last=Schemo|first=Diana Jean|date=November 3, 1994|work=The New York Times|access-date=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serrano's series ''Objects of Desire'', from the early 1990s, features close-ups of firearms, photographed at the [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]], Louisiana home of artist [[Blake Nelson Boyd]]. Included is a shot, against a glowing orange background, down the barrel of a loaded .45 [[revolver]] (belonging to Boyd's grandfather) that was used by Jonas Mekas for the cover of the April–May–June 2007 Anthology Film Archives catalog.

Critical reception of Serrano's work has been mixed. In a 1989 ''New York Times'' review, critic Michael Brenson responded to Serrano's series of [[Cibachrome]] photographs of iconic objects submerged in bodily fluids: "You cannot consider the content of Mr. Serrano's work without considering his attitude toward photography. It is the photograph that breaks through convention, that makes the search possible and that enables the artist to sort out what he likes and does not like in religion and art. It is the photograph that becomes the vessel of transformation and revelation. The photograph then becomes an icon that, for Mr. Serrano, replaces the false icons in his work. The photograph is clean and purified, the reliquary or shrine in which he clearly believes that the word about the body can be stored and spread."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brenson|first=Michael|title=Andres Serrano: Provocation And Spirituality|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/08/arts/review-art-andres-serrano-provocation-and-spirituality.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=December 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing later work in 2001, ''Guardian'' art critic Adrian Searle was not impressed: he found that Serrano's photos were "far more about being lurid than anything else... In the end, the show is all surface, and looking for hidden depths does no good."&lt;ref name="negener" /&gt; Continuing his use of biological matter, more recent work of Serrano's uses feces as a medium.&lt;ref&gt;Yaeger, Lynn. [http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-08-27/columns/serrano-s-shit-show/ "Andres Serrano's 'Shit' Show"], ''Village Voice'', August 26, 2008. Accessed September 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Serrano's work ''Blood and Semen III'' is used as the cover of heavy metal band [[Metallica]]'s album ''[[Load (album)|Load]]'', while "Piss and Blood" is used on ''[[Reload (Metallica album)|Reload]]''. Serrano also directed a video for [[industrial metal]] group [[Godflesh]], "[[Crush My Soul]]".

In 2008, Serrano's piece ''The Interpretation of Dreams (White Nigger)'' was selected to participate in [[Renaissance Society|The Renaissance Society]]'s group exhibit, "Black Is, Black Ain't".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renaissancesociety.org/site/Exhibitions/Images.Black-Is-Black-Ain-t.595.5158.html Renaissance Society] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120910032932/http://www.renaissancesociety.org/site/Exhibitions/Images.Black-Is-Black-Ain-t.595.5158.html |date=September 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serrano adopted the [[alter ego]] "Brutus Faust" to create the full-length album ''Vengeance Is Mine'' in July 2010. The album contains covers of classic songs from the 1960s, and original compositions including four songs written by Serrano’s wife Irina Movmyga as well as one song co-written by Serrano, Thad DeBrock, and [[album producer]] Steve Messina of New York City–based band [[Blow Up Hollywood]]. Coinciding with the release of the album are the videos ''Goo Goo Gaga'', ''Love Letters'', and ''Bad Moon Rising''. ''Goo Goo Gaga'' consists mostly of black-and-white footage from the 1940s, which makes parallels between the Depression and the present day, with the images of "Brutus" shot by Francesco Carrozzini. ''Love Letters'' is footage taken from cult director Joe Sarno’s ''Flesh and Lace''. ''Bad Moon Rising'' consists entirely of footage Serrano compiled from several short films by John Santerineross. All of these short films were edited by Vincent V.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brutusfaust.com/about.php Brutus Faust.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://flavorwire.com/106955/andres-serrano-wants-to-be-a-rock-star|title=Andres Serrano Wants to Be a Rock Star|last=Laster|first=Paul|publisher=flavorwire|date=July 22, 2010|accessdate=August 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Serrano made a work of art called ''Sign of the Times'' by collecting 200 signs from homeless people in New York City, usually paying $20 for each sign. He described the work as "a testimony to the homeless men and women who roam the streets in search of food and shelter. It's also a chronicle of the times we live in."&lt;ref&gt;Serrano, Andres.[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/18/andres-serrano-signs-of-the-times-homeless I started buying the signs that homeless use to beg.

'''Arna Selznick''' is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] director and artist, known for directing [[Nelvana]]'s 1985 animated film ''[[The Care Bears Movie]]''.  Arna owns and operates a studio called Dancingmonkeys with her husband/partner [[John van Bruggen]].

== Career ==
Selznick completed two years, 2014- 2016 as a key member of the story team of the CG animated feature film, [[The Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature|The Nut Job 2,]] produced in Toronto by [[ToonBox Entertainment|Toonbox Entertainment]]. She is currently directing a CG animated featurette for Corus's [http://www.nelvana.com/ Nelvana], titled The Most Magnificent Thing, based on the popular children's book by [https://www.ashleyspires.com/ Ashley Spires].

Selznick began her career at Toronto's [[Nelvana]] studio, participating in several efforts such as ''[[Rock &amp; Rule|layout artist on Rock &amp; Rule]]'', ''[[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|story supervisor on Inspector Gadget]]'' and ''[[Strawberry Shortcake and the Baby Without a Name|director on Strawberry Shortcake and the Baby Without a Name]]''.&lt;ref name="beck" /&gt;  There, she met future husband [[John van Bruggen]].&lt;ref name="ottawa-fest" /&gt;  She moved on to direct ''[[The Care Bears Movie]]'', released in 1985 by [[the Samuel Goldwyn Company]] in the United States,&lt;ref name="beck" /&gt; and [[Astral Media|Astral Films]]&lt;ref name="trivia-ca"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=82ZJ1IvRkFcC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=%22Care+Bears%22+-+Astral&amp;hl=en|last1=Kearney|first1=Mark|last2=Ray|first2=Randy|title=The Great Canadian Trivia Book: A Collection of Compelling Curiosities from Alouette to Zed|chapter=What is the highest-grossing Canadian movie ever?|volume=2|page=80|isbn=0-88882-197-2|year=1998|accessdate=November 13, 2010|publisher=Dundurn Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Criterion Pictures Corporation&lt;ref name="film-canadiana"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fNpkAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Care+Bears%22+-+Astral&amp;dq=%22Care+Bears%22+-+Astral&amp;hl=en|author1=[[National Film Board of Canada]]|author2=[[National Library of Canada]]|author3=Moving Image and Sound Archives (Canada)|author4=Cinémathèque québécoise|title=Film/Vidéo Canadiana, 1985–1986|page=43|issn=0836-1002|year=1986|accessdate=November 13, 2010|publisher=National Film Board of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Canada.  The film won Canada's [[Golden Reel Award (Canada)|Golden Reel Award]] for [[1985 Genie Awards|highest-grossing local production in 1985]], with the Canadian gross of $22,934,622.00.  Quite remarkable, since children's admission at the time was about $3.50 or less. At the time of that film's release, Arna was probably only the third woman to direct an animated feature (after [[Lotte Reiniger]] of 1927's ''[[The Adventures of Prince Achmed]]'', and [[Joy Batchelor]] of 1954's [[Animal Farm (1954 film)|''Animal Farm'']]).&lt;ref name="beck" /&gt;{{#tag:ref|In 1998, Selznick was followed by [[Brenda Chapman]] of [[DreamWorks Animation]]'s ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]''.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/mar/19/entertainment/ca-10274/2|last=Mallory|first=Michael|title=Move Over, Old Men; Disney's fabled favourite artists weren't alone in the male-ruled animation world.

While the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Stephen Hunter gave a mixed response to the animation of ''The Care Bears Movie'', he pointed out that director Selznick "has a nice feel for the dynamics of action animation; several of the set-pieces zing along nicely."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hunter|first=Stephen|title='Care Bears Movie' is a harmless film diversion|date=April 6, 1985|work=Houston Chronicle|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association of American Editorial Cartoonists (AAEC)''' is a professional association concerned with promoting the interests of staff, freelance and student [[editorial cartoonists]] in the United States, Canada and Mexico. With nearly 300 members, it is the world's largest organization of [[political cartoonists]].

The AAEC has filed friend-of-the-court briefs in several cases dealing with freedom of the press, including the 1988 Supreme Court case ''Flynt v. Falwell'' ([[Hustler Magazine v. Falwell]]). Aside from [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] issues, the Association does not take sides in political controversies.

Formed in 1957 by a small group of newspaper cartoonists led by [[John Stampone]] of the ''[[Army Times]]'', the AAEC was created to promote and stimulate public interest in the editorial page cartoon and to create closer contact among political cartoonists. Each year, the annual AAEC convention is held in a different North American city, allowing cartoonists and other association members—including publishers, writers, historians and collectors—the chance to meet face-to-face, talk shop, and generally [[List of English words of Yiddish origin#kvetch|kvetch]].

== Publications and programs ==
The AAEC follows the publishing industry and member artists through weekly news updates at its web site [http://editorialcartoonists.com EditorialCartoonists.com], and in its quarterly magazine, the ''Notebook.'' The AAEC site also offers dozens of new editorial cartoons each day, and a recent archive of nearly 40,000 cartoons.

The AAEC also sponsors a '''Cartoons for the Classroom''' program designed to aid educators at all levels in teaching history, economics, social studies and current events.

== History ==
In 2007, the AAEC met over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend in Washington D.C. to celebrate its 50th Anniversary.&lt;ref name="anniv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://editorialcartoonists.com/aaecweb/convention2007.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705144219/http://editorialcartoonists.com/aaecweb/convention2007.cfm |archivedate=2008-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, AAEC joined over 60 other art licensing businesses (including the [[Artists Rights Society]], [[Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators]], the [[Stock Artists Alliance]], Illustrator's Partnership of America and the Advertising Photographers of America, among others) in opposing both [http://capwiz.com/illustratorspartnership/issues/bills/?billid=11320236 The Orphan Works Act of 2008] and [http://capwiz.com/illustratorspartnership/issues/bills/?billid=11322171 The Shawn Bentley Orphan Works Act of 2008].&lt;ref name="ipa2"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.illustratorspartnership.org/01_topics/article.php?searchterm=00273 |title=Orphan Works Legislative Action Center: Groups Opposed to the Orphan Works Act |access-date=2008-08-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930014130/http://www.illustratorspartnership.org/01_topics/article.php?searchterm=00273 |archive-date=2008-09-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Known collectively as "[https://web.archive.org/web/20080930014130/http://www.illustratorspartnership.org/01_topics/article.php?searchterm=00273 Artists United Against the U.S. Orphan Works Acts]," the diverse organizations joined forces to oppose the bills, which the groups believe "permits, and even encourages, wide-scale infringements while depriving creators of protections currently available under the Copyright Act."&lt;ref name="ipa2"/&gt;

== Awards ==
For the last two decades, the AAEC has sponsored the '''John Locher Memorial Award''', given each year to the most promising student cartoonist. The Award was named in honor of the late son of [[Dick Locher|Dick]] and Mary Locher, who felt the need to establish an award that would not only honor the memory of John Locher but also would help discover young cartoonists and stimulate interest in editorial cartooning among college-age students in North America.

'''''Bala''''' is a 1976 short [[documentary film]] made by [[Satyajit Ray]], about a [[Bharatanatyam]] dancer, [[Balasaraswati]], fondly known as "Bala".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satyajitray.org/films/bala.htm|title=Bala@satyajitray.org|accessdate=8 January 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120911121224/http://www.satyajitray.org/films/bala.htm|archivedate=11 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was jointly produced by [[National Centre for the Performing Arts (India)|National Centre for the Performing Arts]] and [[Government of Tamil Nadu]]. The thirty-three-minute documentary features the life and some of the works by Balasaraswati in the form of narration and dance, starring herself. At the age of fourteen, Ray had seen a performance of Balasaraswati in  [[Kolkata]], then known as "Calcutta", in 1935, when she was seventeen years old.&lt;ref name="balarayusc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://satyajitray.ucsc.edu/films/bala.html |title=Bala@satyajitray.ucsc |accessdate=8 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222015711/http://satyajitray.ucsc.edu/films/bala.html |archivedate=22 February 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ray had initially planned to make a film on Bala in 1966 when she was in her prime. However, he could start filming in only 1976. Incidentally, though Bala was often called "a revolutionary Bharatanatyam dancer",&lt;ref name="baladavid"/&gt; she had never been filmed till she was 58 years old, in spite of having a career spanned over four decades.&lt;ref name="balarayusc"/&gt; Ray decided to make the film on Bala, "the greatest Bharatanatyam dancer ever" according to him,&lt;ref name="raybook"&gt;{{cite book|title=Satyajit Ray: The Inner Eye|publisher=I.

==Background==

{{main|Balasaraswati}}

Tanjore Balasaraswati, fondly known as Balasaraswati or Bala, was born on 13 May 1918 in [[Chennai]], then known as Madras. With her earlier seven generations worked predominantly in dance and musical fields, Bala started her [[Bharatanatyam]] training at the age of five, under Nattuvanar Kandappa Pillai and made her dancing debut in 1925, at the age of seven, at [[Kancheepuram]] at the [[Kamakshi Amman Temple]].&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balasaraswati.com/time%20line.htm |title=balasaraswati timeline |accessdate=9 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424012918/http://www.balasaraswati.com/time%20line.htm |archivedate=24 April 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kpoursine.com/balasara.htm |title=Balasaraswati (1918-1984) |accessdate=9 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313220626/http://www.kpoursine.com/balasara.htm |archivedate=13 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, Jayammal was a singer who encouraged Bala's musical training and was her accompanist in the dance concerts. Bala continued to do stage performance around the world along with her brothers, [[Mridangam]] player [[T. Ranganathan]] and [[flautist]] [[T. Viswanathan]]. Bala and her famous contemporary [[Rukmini Devi Arundale]] are often called as revolutionary Bharatanatyam dancers.&lt;ref name="baladavid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/living/balasaraswati-vs-rukmini-arundale-the-grand-bharata-natyam-controversy-134874.html|title=Balasaraswati vs Rukmini Arundale: The grand Bharatanatyam controversy|publisher=[[First Post (India)|First Post]]|date=20 November 2011|accessdate=9 January 2013|author=Knight, Douglas M.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217003235/http://www.firstpost.com/living/balasaraswati-vs-rukmini-arundale-the-grand-bharata-natyam-controversy-134874.html|archivedate=17 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was awarded the second highest civilian honour given by the [[Government of India]], the [[Padma Vibhushan]], in 1977.&lt;ref name=pa&gt;{{cite web|title=Padma Awards Directory (1954-2007) |publisher=[[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] |date=30 May 2007 |url=http://www.mha.nic.in/pdfs/PadmaAwards1954-2007.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=9 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410024701/http://www.mha.nic.in/pdfs/PadmaAwards1954-2007.pdf |archivedate=10 April 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bala passed way on 9 February 1984, at the age of 65.

==Synopsis==

The film begins with the introduction of [[Bharatanatyam]] since its inception. It also explains the various hand gestures, known as [[Mudra]] and Bala demonstrates one of them, "Mayura Mudra" ("Peacock Mudra"). Narrated by [[Satyajit Ray]], the film describes Bala's lineage and her debut performance in 1925, at the age of seven, at [[Kancheepuram]] at the [[Kamakshi Amman Temple]]. A noted [[Sanskrit]] scholar and musicologist explains Bala's dancing style and an Indian dancer, [[Uday Shankar]] mentions about his association with Bala.

The film then showcases Bala's "one of the most acclaimed" performance ''[[Krishna Ni Begane Baaro]]'' in the background of the ocean. It mentions that Bala got international acclaim through "The Festival of Arts, [[Edinburgh]]" in 1963, where other Indian artists also performed their art like [[Sitar]] player [[Ravi Shankar]], classical vocalist [[M. S. Subbulakshmi]] and [[Sarod]] player [[Ali Akbar Khan]]. She performed eight solo recitals at the festival. Mentioning about Bala's achievement, the film showcases her daily routine with her brothers, [[Mridangam]] player [[T. Ranganathan]] and [[flautist]] [[T. Viswanathan]], and her only daughter Lakshmi Knight, also a Bharatanatyam dancer.

The final segment of the film showcases Bala's solo performance of a pada [[varnam]], which is based on [[Carnatic music]], known as "raagamaalika" (garland of [[raga]]s). For this performance, Bala uses the same pair of anklet she had used for her debut performance at the age of seven.

Her critically acclaimed play ''Aadhi Baat'' was about a retired headmaster.  The play examined the headmaster's day-to-day life problems and had [[Qavi Khan]] acting as the lead character.   The play's director was [[Agha Nasir]] and it was produced by [[Tauqeer Nasir]].  ''Aadhi Baat'' was performed in May 2010 in Islamabad at a three-day event which was organized by the [[Pakistan National Council of the Arts]].&lt;ref name="Aadhi Baat"/&gt; Ashfaq Ahmed's autobiography ''Baba Saheba'' was incomplete at the time of his death in September 2004. Qudsia completed the biography and the second part of it was published as ''Rah-i-Rawaan''. The contrast in the narrative styles of the couple is evident in these two books; while the first half is considered "provoking, lucid and utterly spellbinding" by critics, the second half takes the feeling of sorrow. Qudsia credits Ahmed for transforming her after their marriage and eventually allowing her to devote to her writing.&lt;ref name="Siamese"&gt;{{cite news|title=In life, in literature: the Siamese twins |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/619767 |accessdate=6 February 2017 |work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |date=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qudsia's novel ''Raah-e-Rawaan - راہ ِرواں'' was published in 2011. It is an analytical look at Ashfaq Ahmed's philosophical thinking and how it may relate to certain aspects of life itself.  Qudsia had the highest regards for her husband and she has placed Ashfaq Ahmed on a very high pedestal. However she does not even claim to understand the man she lived with for more than five decades. So, an attempt at writing the biography of Ashfaq Ahmed took her beyond that ‘one person’— and she started to write about his ancestry, the family including his grandfather, father, uncles, brothers, sisters and their children so as to fully understand the enigma that was Ashfaq Ahmed.  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sangemeel.com/BookReview.aspx?ProductID=9693523156&lt;/ref&gt;

Qudsia’s  novel ''[Haasil Ghaat]'' was published in 2005 and was noted for its diction but also criticized then for usages of English slangs than her usual traditional Urdu narrative. The language however became popular amongst other writers in future.&lt;ref name="Giant"/&gt;

Bano Qudsia also wrote a book about [[Qudrat Ullah Shahab]] titled "Mard-e-Abresham" "مردِابریشم". The book mainly portrays Shahab's life and how it was connected with [[Ashfaq Ahmed]] and his family both on social and spiritual level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thelibrarypk.com/mard-e-abresham-by-bano-qudsia-free-download/|title=Mard e Abresham By Bano Qudsia Free Pdf - The Library PK|date=2017-08-24|work=The Library PK|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Bano Qudsia died on 4 February 2017 at the [[Ittefaq Hospital]] in [[Lahore]] at the age of 88.

The '''Bernward Column''' ({{lang-de|Bernwardssäule}}) also known as the '''Christ Column''' ({{lang-de|Christussäule}}) is a [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] bronze column, made {{circa|1000}} for [[St. Michael's Church, Hildesheim|St. Michael's Church]] in [[Hildesheim]], Germany, and regarded as a masterpiece of [[Ottonian art]]. It was commissioned by  [[Bernward of Hildesheim|Bernward]], thirteenth bishop of Hildesheim. It depicts images from the life of [[Jesus]], arranged in a helix similar to [[Trajan's Column]]: it was originally topped with a cross or [[crucifix]]. During the 19th century, it was moved to a courtyard and later to [[Hildesheim Cathedral]]. During the restoration of the cathedral from 2010 to 2014, it was moved back to its original location in St. Michael's, but was returned to the Cathedral in August 2014.&lt;ref name="Column" /&gt;

== Original location and history ==
The Bernward Column was made for [[St. Michael's Church, Hildesheim]], the foundation and final resting place of Bishop Bernward. It initially stood in the east choir, behind the altar, with a triumphal cross. This location under the triumphal arch was proposed by Gallistl using the literary sources&lt;ref&gt;Lit. Gallistl (1993) p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; and confirmed in 2006 by excavations.&lt;ref&gt;"Grabungszeichnung Harenberg", in Christiane Segers-Glocke (ed.), ''St. Michael in Hildesheim: Forschungsergebnisse zur bauarchäologischen Untersuchung im Jahr 2006'', CW Niemeyer Buchverlage GmbH, Hameln 2008, Copyright: 2008 [[Niedersächsisches Landesamt für Denkmalpflege]] (= Arbeitshefte zur Denkmalpflege in Niedersachsen 34) {{ISBN|978-3-8271-8034-6}}: S. 153&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a copper-coated marble column stood in front of the altar, whose stone came from the eastern Mediterranean and, according to later sources, was a gift from [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] to Bernward.

The altar was equated with the offering table in the forehall of the [[Temple of Solomon]], which also stood between two columns ([[Boaz and Jachin]]).&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Gallistl, ''Der Dom zu Hildesheim und sein Weltkulturerbe, Bernwardstür und Christussäule'', pp. 30-31&lt;/ref&gt; A large [[wheel chandelier]], which was meant to have been a gift from Otto III to Bernward, hung above the Bernward Column until 1662, with a porphyry jug in the centre that was claimed to derive from the [[Wedding at Cana]]. This arrangement of a column topped with a cross, an altar and a wheel chandelier was modelled on the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], which was also equated with the fore hall of the Temple of Solomon. Furthermore, the distance of roughly {{convert|42|m}} between the original location of the column and the grave of Bernward in the west crypt of St. Michael's matched the distance between the Rotunda of the Resurrection and [[Golgotha]] in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, according to the reports of pilgrims.&lt;ref&gt;Hartwig Beseler, Hans Roggenkamp. ''Die Michaeliskirche in Hildesheim.'' Berlin 1954. p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1544, during the chaos of the [[Reformation]] in Hildesheim, the cross on top of the column was removed by iconoclasts. It was melted down and recast as a cannon, suggesting that it was of considerable size. After the demolition of the east choir of St. Michael's in 1650 and the resulting collapse of the east [[crossing (architecture)|crossing]], the column's [[capital (architecture)|capital]], which "weighed about a hundred pounds", was also melted down and replaced by a wooden capital of identical shape and size, meant to hide the replacement. An engraving by Johann Ludwig Brandes (1730) indicates that it was decorated with figures. Since figural capitals of this kind are otherwise only attested from the twelfth century, it has been suggested that the capital that was melted down was not the Bernwardian original either, and that this original was replaced during the renovation of the cloister church in the second half of the twelfth century.&lt;ref&gt;Lit. Olchawa (2008) S. 70 ff&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the column was not melted down in the following years (despite its value as raw material) because of its ancient significance as a [[contact relic]], since it was believed to have been made personally by St. Bernward.

In 1810, after the [[German mediatization|secularisation]] of the Catholic cloister (1803) and the abolition of the Protestant parish of St. Michael's (1810), the column was removed on the private initiative of diocese officials and installed in the north of the [[Domhof, Hildesheim|Domhof]] between the cathedral and the Bishop's house. In 1870 the Hildesheim sculptor [[Karl Küsthardt]] gave the column a new bronze capital, which was meant to imitate the wooden capital or an illustration of it and to indirectly preserve the appearance of the old bronze capital, which had supported an [[Impost (architecture)|impost]] topped by a bronze crucifix. In 1893 it was moved into the cathedral.

On 30 September 2009 it was moved back to St. Michael's for the duration of the cathedral renovations, which lasted until August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dom-hildesheim.de/en/content/ancient-world-heritage-new-light "ANCIENT WORLD HERITAGE IN A NEW LIGHT"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The Bernward column, which is {{convert|3.79|m}} high and {{convert|58|cm}} in diameter, is a [[Victory column]] that Bernward had cast from bronze in conscious imitation of the marble [[Trajan's Column]] and the [[Column of Marcus Aurelius]] in [[Rome]]. Just as those stone columns depict the military deeds of the Emperor in an upward spiralling frieze, so the Bernward column depicts the peaceful deeds of Christ, beginning with his [[Baptism of Jesus|baptism]] at the [[Jordan]] and ending with his [[triumphal entry into Jerusalem]]. The column was originally crowned with a [[triumphal cross]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.domsanierung.de/de/bernwards%C3%A4ule-christuss%C3%A4ule Bernwardsäule (Christussäule)] domsanierung.de {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ehrhardt"&gt;[http://www.alfred-ehrhardt-stiftung.de/index.php?alfred-ehrhardt-the-bernward-column-of-hildesheim-photography-and-film-1964 Alfred Ehrhardt: The Bernward Column of Hildesheim. / Photography and film 1964]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=GXS0AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14 Medieval Treasures from Hildesheim]'' Yale University Press, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The column is significant for the vitality of the figural relief, which is unusual for the time. The relief complements the [[Bernward Doors]], which picture the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]], [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], and [[resurrection]] of Jesus.&lt;ref name="Ehrhardt" /&gt; Both artworks, like the rest of Bernward's artistic and architectural programme, reflect his efforts to put his seat in the position of a northern Rome in the context of the [[Ottonian dynasty]]'s renewed Christian Roman Empire and also to emphasise Christ as a model of just and godly kingship for the rulers. For this reason, the execution of [[John the Baptist]] by the weak and unjust king [[Herod Antipas]] is given a great deal of space.

== Liturgical significance ==
An important indicator of the liturgical significance of the Bernward column is its original location on the central axis of St. Michael's near the altar since that is where communion was distributed and the sacrament was stored. In the reliefs the importance of the gospels on [[Palm Sunday]] is emphasised, which might be connected with the [[Cluniac reforms]].&lt;ref&gt;Olchawa 2008. S. 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--!?--&gt; The references to the Lenten and penitential rites, which are also found in the imagery of the Bernward Doors, support this.&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Gallistl, "In Faciem Angelici Templi.

''Jahrbuch für Geschichte und Kunst im Bistum Hildesheim'' 75/76 (2007/2008) p. 84 n. 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--!?--&gt;

== Cast ==
Since 1874 there has been a [[plaster cast]] of the column in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in [[London]], bought for £18 from one F. Künsthardt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/users/node/15500|title=Scenes from the Life of Christ|last=Victoria and Albert Museum|date=2012|work=The Cast Court Collection|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Breitling SA''' ({{IPA-de|braɪtliŋ}}) is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Luxury goods|luxury]] [[watchmaker]] based in [[Grenchen]], [[Switzerland]]. The company was founded in 1884 by [[Léon Breitling]] in [[Saint-Imier]]. Breitling is known for precision-made [[COSC certified chronometer|chronometers]] designed for [[aviator]]s.

==History==
[[File:Scott Carpenter inside Aurora 7.jpg|thumb|right|Astronaut [[Scott Carpenter]] wearing a ''Breitling Cosmonaute'' inside the ''[[Aurora 7]]'' spacecraft on May 24, 1962.]]
Breitling SA was founded in [[Saint-Imier]], [[Bernese Jura]] by Léon Breitling in 1884.&lt;ref name=bloom&gt;{{cite web | title=Breitling SA: Private Company Information | work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] | url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=7606770 | accessdate=January 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ernst Schneider bought the company from the founding Breitling family in 1979 and it was owned by the Schneider family until 2017. Ernst's son, Theodore Schneider, sold the majority stake (80%) in Breitling to [[CVC Capital Partners]] for over $870m. The Schneider family still retains 20% control of Breitling.&lt;ref name="FinTimes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Megaw|first1=Nicolas|title=CVC to take majority stake in Swiss watchmaker Breitling|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0f9ec346-8d8d-3bef-83bd-14845dcee8a6|website=Financial Times|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, Breitling sourced [[Movement (clockwork)|movements]] from suppliers such as [[Valjoux]], [[ETA SA|ETA]], and Venus rather than producing movements in-house. In 2009 Breitling developed the B01, an in-house self-winding, column wheel chronograph movement, used in the [[Breitling Chronomat]] 01 and subsequently Navitimer 01.&lt;ref name="WatchAnalyzer"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ivkovic|first1=Boris|title=Breitling Caliber 01 – An Automatic Chronograph Movement Intended for Industrial Production|url=http://www.watchalyzer.com/education/movements/breitling-caliber-01-automatic-chronograph-movement/|website=Watch Analyzer|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
The company fits [[certified chronometer]]s in all models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=COSC - An External Referee |first=Jonathan |last=Bues |work=WorldTempus |date=2010-11-02 |accessdate=2014-10-10 |url=http://en.worldtempus.com/article/insider/cosc-external-referee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watches are usually marketed towards either diving (SuperOcean) or aviation (Navitimer). Aviation models such as the Navitimer offer aviation functions largely as complications, since their function in aviation has largely been replaced by modern electronic instruments. The styling of Breitling watches is characterized by polished cases, bracelets and large watch faces which are designed to improve readability. Many models have an [[automatic watch|automatic winding]] mechanism that is purely mechanical (i.e. using no electronic components) and frequently have [[Complication (horology)|complications]].

In the 1940s, Breitling added a [[circular slide rule]] to the bezel of their chronograph models for use by aircraft pilots. This became the famous ''Navitimer'' model. During the 1950s and 1960s, a version of the Navitimer was offered by the [[Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association]] with the AOPA logo on the dial. In 1961, [[Scott Carpenter]], one of the original [[astronauts]] in the [[Mercury space program]], approached Breitling with the idea of incorporating a [[24 hour watch|24-hour dial]] instead of the normal 12-hour dial. This was needed because of the lack of day and night during space travel. Breitling complied, and produced the 24-hour Navitimer which Carpenter wore on his 1962 space flight. Breitling then proceeded to produce the 24-hour version as the so-called ''Cosmonaute'' Navitimer - under both Breitling and AOPA logos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breitling.com/en/models/navitimer/navitimer-cosmonaute/|title=Breitling Navitimer: 1 &amp; 8 Watches - Breitling|author=|date=|website=Breitling|accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s, the use of logos for military aviation customers had also expanded to include various unit logos on the Aerospace and Chronospace Auto models, primarily those of squadrons and usually part of a group purchase by the pilots and navigators/flight officers of that particular unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flyingsquadron.com/forums/topic/20388-viper-breitling-order/|title=Viper Breitling Order|author=|date=|website=Baseops Forums|accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emergency===
The ''Breitling Emergency'' watch contains a radio transmitter for [[civil aviation]] use which broadcasts on the [[Aircraft emergency frequency|121.5 MHz distress frequency]] and serves as a backup for [[Emergency Locator Transmitter|ELT]]-type airborne beacons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ganapati |first=Priya |url=https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2008/10/steve-fossett-n/ |title=Fossett Was Not Wearing a Breitling Emergency Watch, Says Watchmaker &amp;#124; Gadget Lab |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=2008-10-03 |accessdate=2013-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; For military users, the ''Emergency'' has a miniaturized transmitter operating on the 243.0&amp;nbsp;MHz military aviation emergency frequency. Under normal conditions&amp;mdash;flat terrain or calm seas&amp;mdash;the signal can be picked up at a range of up to 90 nautical miles (167&amp;nbsp;km) by search aircraft flying at 20,000 feet (6,000 m).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esquire.com/features/the-digital-man/ESQ0505MAHBDIGITAL_48 |title=Time Saver |work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] |first=Barry |last=Sonnenfeld |authorlink=Barry Sonnenfeld |date=2005-05-01 |accessdate=2013-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713070723/http://www.esquire.com/features/the-digital-man/ESQ0505MAHBDIGITAL_48 |archivedate=2014-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1 February 2009, the [[Cospas-Sarsat]] Satellite System has not monitored the 121.5/243.0&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency; however, the signal transmitted by the ''Emergency'' was never strong enough to be picked up by satellite, and Breitling has announced that, as these frequencies will still be monitored by aviation, particularly during the localization phase of a rescue attempt, there are no plans to modify the signal's frequency.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Reuters reported that in January 2003 two British pilots, [[Squadron Leader]] Steve Brooks and [[Flight Lieutenant]] Hugh Quentin-Smith, crashed their helicopter in Antarctica and were rescued after activating their Breitling Emergency transmitter watches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Steven |last=Morris |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jan/28/stevenmorris |title=Explorers or boys messing about? Either way, taxpayer gets rescue bill &amp;#124; UK news |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2003-01-28 |accessdate=2013-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Emergency'' is available for customers who do not hold a pilot's licence, but they must sign an agreement stating that they will bear the full costs of a rescue intervention should they trigger the distress beacon.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The model was heavily advertised by the ''[[Breitling Orbiter 3]]''&amp;mdash;both [[Brian Jones (aeronaut)|Brian Jones]] and [[Bertrand Piccard]] were wearing the ''Emergency''. Breitling sponsored the Orbiter 3 project, which in 1999 became the first balloon to completely orbit the Earth without landing. A commemorative Orbiter 3 version of the Emergency watch was subsequently produced, with a production run of 1,999.

===Emergency II===
In April 2013, Breitling announced a new version of the Emergency watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/29/breitling-releases-the-emergency-ii-a-watch-that-can-save-you-if-youre-trapped-on-the-island |title=Breitling Releases the Emergency II, a Watch That Can Save You If You’re Trapped on the Island|work=TechCrunch |first=John |last=Biggs |date=2013-04-29 |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This upgrade transmits on the 121.5&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency, but adds the 406.04&amp;nbsp;MHz signal that is [[Emergency position-indicating radiobeacon station|monitored by satellites]]. It has a separate, rechargeable battery for the transmitter.

===Breitling for Bentley===
As part of 10th anniversary of a Breitling–[[Bentley Motors]] partnership, the Bentley B04 GMT, B05 Unitime and B06 (based on [[COSC]] Certified Breitling Calibre B04, B05 and B06 respectively) were produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://luxurytrump.com/watches/breitling-bentley-celebrates-10-years-3-new-watches/|title="Breitling For Bentley" Celebrates 10 Years With 3 New Watches - Lux Pursuits|author=|date=30 August 2013|publisher=|accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Center Stage''' is the state theater of [[Maryland]], and [[Baltimore]]'s largest professional producing theater. Center Stage began in a converted gymnasium in 1963 as a full arena theatre that seated 240 people.

Center Stage houses two performing spaces, the 541-seat Pearlstone and the smaller Head Theater, both in its home in the Mount Vernon Cultural District of Baltimore.

==History==
Launched in 1963 by a group of local theater supporters, Center Stage soon became a leader in America's regional theater movement, with the goal of producing first-rate professional theater for local audiences, along with theaters like [[The Guthrie Theater]] in Minneapolis, [[Arena Stage]] in Washington, and [[Alley Theatre]] in Houston. On January 10th 1974, an arson fire (which was noted to be set off by two men who were forcibly removed from the next door bar Benny Goodmans Beef And Beer was out to burn down the bar for revenge, but accidentally mistook the Center Stage Theatre for the bar by setting it ablaze in the back part of the building), burned its North Avenue home to the ground. In 1931 the North Avenue building was previously occupied by a theatre called The Peabody which opened in the early 1900s, in 1931 Orioles Cafeteria a local food chain restaurant moved into the space at 11 East North Avenue and moved out in August 1965 to make space for The Center Stage Theatre, after the building burned down in .74 many decided that since the outer shell was not severely damaged that some hope have been considered for savage use, but the interior was completely destroyed and unstable and was later on considered unsafe by city inspectors and construction crews and was later demolished, although the majority of the building was demolished both sides of the facades columns remain to remind passerby's what was once there, today the site of the North Avenue building is currently a small parking lot for used cars and auto repairing. Additional stage hands quickly rebuilt the set for Noel Coward's ''Hayfever'' and help from local civic leaders, the theater continued its season at a local college (once a part of Loyola High School and College), and used the disaster to launch a major public relations and capital campaign to keep the organization alive. The theater ultimately moved into a new space carved out of an abandoned Jesuit college. Since that time, it has become Baltimore's leading professional theater, hosting more than 100,000 people each season to its home in [[Mount Vernon, Baltimore|Mount Vernon]].

In 2011, British playwright [[Kwame Kwei-Armah]] succeeded Irene Lewis as artistic director of Center Stage. Center Stage audiences became familiar with him in 2005 when Kwei-Armah’s most recognized work ''Elmina’s Kitchen'' held its American premiere at Center Stage. The play had previously debuted at the National Theatre in London in 2003, making Kwei-Armah the first Black Briton to have a play produced on the West End. Under the direction of Kwei-Armah, Center Stage has transitioned from a six play to a seven play season that includes a mix of comedy, drama, and musicals. 

Main stage performances occur in either the 541-seat Pearlstone Theater or the smaller, flexible-layout Head Theater. The Play Lab series features new work from emerging and established artists. Third Spaces brings theater to unexpected stages, such as the 2013 production of The Container, which placed a small audience inside a shipping container, and Fourth Spaces explores the relationship between technology and artistry, using the Center Stage interactive media wall to connect audiences and theater artists.

"'''Christmas Bells'''" is an American television commercial produced by [[the Hershey Company]] promoting [[Hershey's Kisses]]. The advertisement, produced with [[stop-motion animation]], features Hershey's Kisses, fashioned as a [[handbell choir]], playing the Christmas [[Carol (music)|carol]] "[[We Wish You a Merry Christmas]]". It debuted in 1989 and is shown in the United States each holiday season; as such, it is the longest-running television commercial for the Hershey brand.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

==Background==
In 1989, the Hershey Company began an advertising campaign for their product Hershey's Kisses, which was referred to as the "whimsy" campaign. [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather]] was the advertising agency behind the spot and David Apicella served as Creative Director. Television advertisements would utilize "tabletop stop-motion animation and CG product photography."

'''Emanuel Anthony Posselt''' (1858–1921) was an authority on [[Jacquard loom]]s and weaving. His book on the Jacquard machine is considered to be a classic.&lt;ref name=csbio&gt;[https://www.cs.arizona.edu/patterns/weaving/webdocs/pea_bibl.pdf cs.arizona.edu: "Emanuel Anthony Posselt"], by Ralph E. Griswold&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Posselt, the son of Emanuel Anthony and Elizabeth (Demuth) Posselt, was born in [[Liberec|Reichenberg, Austrian Empire]] (current Liberec, [[Czech Republic]]) on 21 August 1858. Emanuel graduated in 1876 from the [[Imperial Government Weaving School]], also in Reichenberg. During the next two years, he visited most of the important textile manufacturing cities in Europe, and during this time he managed his father's textile mills. In August 1878, he went to the United States, where he worked until 1884 for various textile mills in New England and Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=csbio/&gt;

In 1884, Posselt became the inaugural director of the textile division of [[Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art]]. In 1891, he resigned that position to accept the editorship of the [[Textile Record of North America]], at the time a leading trade journal.&lt;ref name=csbio/&gt;

Posselt then established a private textile academy and a textile trade book business. He published his own work on the Jacquard machine, the technology of textile design, textile calculations, and cotton, wool and silk industries; as well as works by other authors, such as Gardner on wool dyeing.  The series ''Hand Books of the Textile Industry'' and ''Posselt's Textile Library'', as well as ''Posselt's Textile Journal'' that ran between 1907 and 1923, are his own.  The last was the immediate forerunner of [[Textile World]].&lt;ref name=csbio/&gt;

Posselt died in 1921.&lt;ref name=csbio/&gt;

==Family==

Posselt married in July 1884 at [[Colchester, Vermont]] Anna Clera Pollinger, by whom he had three children: Anna (1896), Elwood (1906) and Gertrude (1908).&lt;ref name=csbio/&gt;

An '''exemplum''' (Latin for "example", pl. '''exempla''',  ''exempli gratia'' = "for example", abbr.: ''e.g.'') is a moral [[anecdote]], brief or extended, real or fictitious, used to illustrate a point. The word is also used to express an action performed by another and used as an example or model.

==Exemplary literature==

This [[genre]] sprang from the above, in classical, medieval and Renaissance literature, consisting of lives of famous figures, and using these (by emphasizing good or bad character traits) to make a moral point.

Collections of Exempla&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Nicolas |last=Louis |title=L’exemplum en pratiques : production, diffusion et usages des recueils d’exempla latins aux XIIIe-XVe siècles |volume=2 |publisher=Namur-Paris |year=2013 |hdl=2078.2/133816 |url=https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00860685/file/Nicolas_LOUIS_-_thA_se_-_enquete_annexe.pdf |format=PDF |pages=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; helped [[Middle Ages|medieval]] preachers to adorn their [[sermon]]s, to emphasize moral conclusions or illustrate a point of doctrine. The subject matter could be taken from [[fable]]s, [[Folklore|folktale]]s, [[legend]]s, real history, or natural history. [[Jacques de Vitry]]'s book of exempla, c. 1200, [[Nicholas Bozon]]'s ''Les contes moralisés'' (after 1320), and [[Odo of Cheriton]]'s ''Parabolae'' (after 1225) were famous medieval collections aimed particularly at preachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PscUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA6 |chapter=Introduction |page=5-6 |title=The Dialogues of Creatures Moralysed: A Critical Edition |editor-first=Gregory C. |editor-last=Kratzmann |editor2-first=Elizabeth |editor2-last=Gee |publisher=[[Brill (publisher)|Brill]] Archive |date=1 January 1988 |isbn=9789004085152}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Miller's Prologue and Tale]]'' became a vivid satire on this genre. There were also notable lay writers of moral tales, such as the 13th century [[Der Stricker]] and the 14th century [[Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena]] ([[Tales of Count Lucanor]]).
Examples dealing with historical figures include:

*[[Suetonius]]'s ''De vita Caesarum'' or ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]''
*[[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Parallel Lives]]''
*[[Jerome]]'s ''[[De Viris Illustribus (Jerome)|De viris illustribus]]''
*[[Petrarch]]'s ''[[De Viris Illustribus (Petrarch)|De viris illustribus]]''
*[[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]''
*[[Boccaccio]]'s ''[[On Famous Women]]'' and ''[[De Casibus Virorum Illustrium|On the Fates of Illustrious Men]]''
*[[Christine de Pizan]]'s ''[[The Book of the City of Ladies]]''.
*''[[Mirror for Magistrates]]'' by various Tudor authors

==Three examples of exempla==

''The Norton Anthology of Western Literature'' includes three exempla (singular, ''exemplum''), stories that illustrate a general principle or underscore a moral lesson: "The Two City Dwellers and the Country Man" and "The King's Tailor's Apprentice" (both from ''The Scholar's Guide'') and "The Cursed Dancers of Colbeck." 

==="The Two City Dwellers and the Country Man"===

In "The Two City Dwellers and the Country Man," told by the father, the three traveling companions of the tale's title are on a [[pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]]. Near their destination, their provisions are nearly depleted, and the two city dwellers attempt to cheat the country man by telling him that whoever of them dreams the most extraordinary dream shall get the last of their bread.

As the city dwellers sleep, the country man, alert to their intended deception, eats the half-baked bread before retiring.

The city dwellers relate their made-up dreams. One says he was taken to [[heaven]] and led before God by angels. The other says that angels escorted him to [[hell]]. 

The country man says he dreamed the same things that his companions dreamed and, believing them to be forever lost, one to heaven and the other to hell, ate the bread.

The son tells his father the moral of the story: "As it says in the [[proverb]], ‘He who wanted all, lost all.’" He says that the two city dwellers got their just comeuppance. The story says that he wishes they’d been whipped, as the antagonist in another story he has heard, was beaten for his chicanery. His comment is a transition to the next tale, causing the father to ask his son to tell him this story. Thus, the roles of the father and his son are reversed, as the father, who was the storyteller, becomes the listener, and the son, who was his father's audience, becomes the narrator.

==="The King And His Wife"===

The son's story recounts the story of a king's tailor's assistant, a youth by the name of Nedui.

One day while he is away, his master gives the other apprentices bread and [[honey]], but does not save any for Nedui, telling them that Nedui "would not eat honey even if he were here." Upon learning that he has been left out, Nedui avenges himself upon his master by telling the [[eunuch]] whom the king has set over the apprentices as their supervisor that the tailor is subject to seizures of madness, during which he becomes violent and dangerous. In fact, Nedui claims, he has killed those who have happened to be near him when he is in the grip of such a fit. To protect himself, Nedui says, he binds and beats the tailor when such a fit comes over him. He also tells the eunuch what to look for: "When you see him looking all around and feeling the floor with his hands and getting up from his seat and picking up the chair on which he is seated, then you will know that he is mad, and if you do not protect yourself and your servants, he will beat you on the head with a [[Club (weapon)|club]]."

The next day, Nedui hides the tailor's shears, and, when the master, hunting for them,  behaves as Nedui mentioned to the eunuch, the eunuch orders his servants to bind the tailor and beats him himself with a club. His servants also beat him until he is unconscious and "half dead."

When he regains consciousness, the tailor asks the eunuch what [[crime]] he has committed to have deserved such a beating, and the eunuch tells him what Nedui told him about the tailor's seizures. "Friend, when have you ever seen me crazy?" the master asks his apprentice, to which question he receives, from Nedui, the rejoinder: "When have you ever seen me refuse to eat honey?"

The father tells the son the [[moral]] of the story: "The tailor deserved his punishment because if he had kept the precept of Moses, to love his brother as himself, this would not have happened to him."

By having the listener tell the narrator the moral of the story, the storyteller shows that the narrative has successfully served its purpose as an exemplum, as the listener, hearing the story, shows that he is able to ascertain the moral that the tale is intended to express.

==="The Cursed Dancers of Colbeck"===

The third exemplum, "The Cursed Dancers of Colbeck," is a prose, rather than a poetic, narrative. Like a mini-sermon, it preaches against wrong conduct—in this case, sacrilegious behavior. This tale has an identifiable author, Robert Mannyng, who set down the story in the early fourteenth century. ''The Norton Anthology'''s version is translated from [[Middle English]] by Lee Patterson.

To bolster his listener's belief that "most of" his tale is "the [[gospel]] truth," the narrator names the culprits and their victims and cites [[Pope Leo IX|Pope Leo]] as one who knows (and wrote a version of) the narrative and points out that the story is "known in the court at Rome" and has appeared widely in many chronicles, including those "beyond the sea." However, after the telling of the tale, the storyteller admits that some doubt its veracity.

The story starts by identifying several activities that are not allowed in [[Church (building)|church]] or in the [[churchyard]]: "carols, [[wrestling]], or summer games." In addition, "interludes or singing, beating the [[tabor (instrument)|tabor]] [a small drum], or piping. . . . while the [[priest]] is conducting [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]]" are "forbidden" and sacrilegious, and "good priests" will not tolerate them.

It is also improper to dance in church, as the story that the narrator is about to tell demonstrates.

When "twelve fools" in Colbeck (or, as the editors’ note explains, "[[Kolbigk]], in [[Saxony]], an area in eastern Germany, just north of the present-day Czech border) decided, one [[Christmas Eve]], to make "a [[Carol (music)|carol]]--madly, as a kind of challenge," and persisted in singing and dancing in the churchyard while the priest was trying to conduct Mass, despite his entreaties to them to stop, the priest calls upon God to [[curse]] them.

The singers’ carol contains three lines, the last of which appears to become the basis of their curse, as they are unable to leave the churchyard or to quit singing or dancing for a year after God curses them for their sacrilegious behavior:

:By the leafy wood rode Bovoline,
:With him he led the fair Mersewine.
:Why are we waiting? Why don’t we go?

As a result of the curse, the dancers cannot stop singing and dancing; neither can they let go of one another's hands.

The priest, too late, sends his son, Ayone, to rescue his daughter, Ave, who is one of the "twelve fools" involved in the dancing. However, due to the curse, when Ayone takes his sister's arm to separate her from the other carolers, it detaches from her body. Miraculously, her wound does not bleed, nor does she die from it.

Ayone takes the arm to his father. The priest tries, three times unsuccessfully, to bury the limb, but the grave casts it back, so the priest displays it inside the church. Everyone, including the [[emperor]], comes to see the cursed dancers, who, despite no rest, food, drink, or sleep, dance non-stop, night and day, regardless of the temperature or the weather. Several times, the emperor orders a covering to be built to protect the dancers from storms, but it is reduced to rubble overnight each time it is built or rebuilt.

After the year has ended, the curse is lifted, and the dancers fall down upon the ground, as if dead.  Three days later, they arise—except for Ave, who has died. Soon after, the priest also dies. The emperor installs the container in the church as a receptacle for the dead girl's arm, and it becomes a holy [[relic]] commemorating the [[miracle]] of the curse.

The other dancers cannot get together again, ever, and must skip, instead of walking, wherever they go. Living mementoes of God's curse against sacrilegious behavior, they bear permanent physical changes to their clothing and their bodies: "Their clothes didn’t rot nor their nails grow; their hair didn’t lengthen nor their [[complexion]] change. Nor did they ever have relief..."

Although some believe and others doubt the authenticity of the tale he's told, the narrator says he recounted the story so that his listeners, taking heed, may be "afraid to carol in a church or churchyard, especially against the priest's will," as "jangling is a form of [[sacrilege]]."

'''''for colored girls who have considered suicide / when the rainbow is enuf''''' is  [[Ntozake Shange|Ntozake Shange's]] first work and most acclaimed theater piece, premiered in 1976. It consists of a series of poetic monologues to be accompanied by dance movements and music, a form Shange coined as the [[choreopoem]].&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Jane (October 28, 2018), [https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/28/opinions/ntozake-shange-remembered-in-tweets/index.html "What 'For Colored Girls' meant to us"], CNN.&lt;/ref&gt; ''for colored girls...'' tells the stories of seven women who have suffered oppression in a racist and sexist society.&lt;ref name="Hammad"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hammad|first=Lamia Khalil|title=Black Feminist Discourse of Power in for colored girls who have considered suicide |url=http://rupkatha.com/V3/n2/05_For_Colored_Girls_Who_Have_Considered_Suicide.pdf|publisher=Yarmouk University|work=Rupkatha Journal on Interdisciplinary Studies in Humanities|volume= 3.2|date= 2011|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a choreopoem, the piece is a series of 20 separate poems choreographed to music that weaves interconnected stories of love, empowerment, struggle and loss into a complex representation of sisterhood. The cast consists of seven nameless African-American women only identified by the colors they are assigned. They are the lady in red, lady in orange, lady in yellow, lady in green, lady in blue, lady in brown, and lady in purple.  Subjects from rape, abandonment, abortion and domestic violence are tackled.&lt;ref name="Hammad"/&gt; Shange originally wrote the monologues as separate poems in 1974. Her writing style is idiosyncratic and she often uses vernacular language, unique structure, and unorthodox punctuation to emphasize syncopation. Shange wanted to write ''for colored girls...'' in a way that mimicked how real women speak so she could draw her readers' focus to the experience of reading and listening.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf Study Guide|url = http://www.gradesaver.com/for-colored-girls-who-have-considered-suicide-when-the-rainbow-is-enuf|website = www.gradesaver.com|access-date = February 8, 2016|last = GradeSaver}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1974, Shange performed the first incarnation of her choreopoem with four other artists at a women's bar outside [[Berkeley, California]].&lt;ref name="Collins 717–752"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collins|first=Lisa Gail|title=Activists Who Yearn for Art That Transforms: Parallels in the Black Arts and Feminist Art Movements in the United States|journal=Signs|date=Spring 2006|volume=31|issue=3|pages=717–752|doi=10.1086/498991|jstor=10.1086/498991}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After moving to [[New York City]], she continued work on ''for colored girls...'', which went on to open at the [[Booth Theatre]] in 1976, becoming the second play by a black woman to reach [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], preceded by [[Lorraine Hansberry|Lorraine Hansberry's]] ''[[A Raisin in the Sun]]'' in 1959.&lt;ref name="Effiong"&gt;{{cite web|last=Effiong|first=Phillip|title=Ntozake Shange|url=http://literati.credoreference.com/content/entry/abcafatrle/shange_ntozake_1948/0|publisher=Santa Barbara: ABC-Clio|accessdate= May 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shange updated the original choreopoem in 2010, by adding the poem "positive" and referencing the [[Iraq War]] and [[PTSD]].

''for colored girls...'' has been performed [[Off-Broadway]] as well as on Broadway, and was adapted as a book (first published in 1976 by [[Alta (poet)#Shameless Hussy Press|Shameless Hussy Press]]), a 1982 [[for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf (Television)|television film]], and a 2010 [[For Colored Girls|theatrical film]]. The 1976 Broadway production was nominated for the [[Tony Award for Best Play]].

==Title==

''for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf'' is a piece of work inspired by events of Shange's own life. Shange admitted publicly to having attempted suicide on four different occasions. In a phone interview conducted with CNN, she explained how she came to the title of her choreopoem: "I was driving the No. 1 Highway in northern California and I was overcome by the appearance of two parallel rainbows. I had a feeling of near death or near catastrophe. Then I drove through the rainbow and I went away. Then I put that together to form the title,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cox-Cordova|first=Jill|title=Shange's 'For Colored Girls' has lasting power|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/books/07/21/for.colored.girls.shange/index.html?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ#cnnSTCText|publisher=Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.|date=July 21, 2009 |accessdate= May 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The colors of the rainbow then became the essence of the women in the choreopoem.

Shange [also] explains that she chose to use the word "colored" in the title of her choreopoem so that her grandmother would be able to understand it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Synopsis==
Structurally, ''for colored girls'' is a series of 20 poems, collectively called a "choreopoem." Shange's poetry expresses many struggles and obstacles that African-American women may face throughout their lives and is a representation of sisterhood and coming of age as an African-American woman. The poems are choreographed to music that weaves together interconnected stories. The choreopoem is performed by a cast of seven nameless women only identified by the colors they are assigned. They are the lady in red, lady in orange, lady in yellow, lady in green, lady in blue, lady in brown, and lady in purple.  Subjects from [[rape]], abandonment, [[abortion]], and domestic violence are tackled.&lt;ref name="Hammad"/&gt; By the end of the play these women come together in a circle, symbolizing the unity they have found sharing their stories.

*"dark phrases" – Lady in Brown with Ladies in Red, Blue, Orange, Green, Yellow and Purple
The prologue of the choreopoem "dark phrases" begins with the lady in brown describing the "dark phrases of womanhood".&lt;ref&gt;Shange, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  All she hears are screams and promises. Each woman states where she is from, by stating they are outside their respective cities. The lady in brown proclaims that this piece is all for "colored girls who have considered suicide / but moved to the ends of their own rainbows".&lt;ref name=Shange20&gt;Shange, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The women then begin to sing children's nursery rhymes, "mama's little baby likes shortnin, shortnin".&lt;ref name=Shange20/&gt; Then all the ladies start to dance to the song "[[Dancing in the Streets]]".

*"graduation nite" – Lady in Yellow with Ladies in Blue, Green and Red
The lady in yellow says it was graduation night and she was the only virgin. She was out driving around with her male friends who she has known since the seventh grade in a black Buick, laughing about graduation. After a fight breaks out, the lady in yellow and Bobby leave and end up having sex in the back of the Buick. The other ladies start talking about their sexual preferences.

*"now i love somebody more than" – Lady in Blue with Ladies in Yellow, Blue, and Green
The lady in blue talks about how she used to participate in dance marathons frequently. One night she refused to dance with anyone that only spoke English. Throughout the monologue she intertwines English and Spanish.  During this time she discovered blues clubs. She says she became possessed by the music. She ends her monologue by calling it her poem "thank-you for music," to which she states: "I love you more than poem".&lt;ref name=Shange27&gt;Shange, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; She repeats "te amo mas que," and the other women join her, softly chanting.

*"no assistance" – Lady in Red
The lady in red addresses an ambiguous "you" throughout the monologue.

*"i'm a poet who" – Lady in Orange with Ladies in Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple and Brown

*"latent rapists'" – Ladies in Red, Blue, Purple
The lady in blue talks about how hard it is to press charges against a friend. The other women begin to ponder and ask questions. They say that maybe it was a misunderstanding, or the woman caused it, and they ask her if she was drinking. The lady in red states that society only believes someone is a rapist if they are a perverted stranger. The women talk about male friends of theirs who have nice smiles and buy them dinner but end up raping women. The women all share the experience of having been violated by a man they knew while being on the lookout for “the stranger we always thot it wd be”&lt;ref&gt;Shange, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; The lady in red states that the "nature of rape has changed." The lights change, the women react to an imaginary slap.

The lady in brown became obsessed with Toussaint despite the fact that he was dead. He was her "secret lover at age 8".&lt;ref&gt;Shange, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The lady in brown wanted to run away to go to [[Haiti]] with Toussaint. On her journey the lady in brown meets a young boy whose name is Toussaint Jones. The lady in brown feels likes she's met her real-life Toussaint and she leaves with him.

*"one" – Lady in Red
The lady in red enters begins by describing a beautiful woman wearing orange butterflies, silk roses, and aqua sequins. This woman is deliberate in all her actions. Although she walked slowly to allow men to gaze at her, she never returned their interest with a smile or acknowledging their catcalls. She was "hot / a deliberate coquette".&lt;ref&gt;Shange, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Her goal was to be unforgettable. She takes "those especially schemin/ tactful suitors" to go home with her. In the morning, she becomes her ordinary self by washing off the glitter and the grime from the night before. She asks her lovers to leave. The men would leave in a hurry, and then she cleaned up and put her roses away. She would write about her exploits in her diary and then, cry herself to sleep.

*"i usedta to live in the world" – Lady in Blue
The lady in blue begins her monologue by explaining that she used to live in the world but now only lives in Harlem, and her universe is only six blocks. She used to walk all over the world and now her world is small and dirty. The lady in blue says that when she used to live in the world where she was nice and sweet but now, now she cannot bring herself to be nice to anyone in this "six blocks of cruelty / piled up on itself".&lt;ref&gt;Shange, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

*"pyramid" – Lady in Purple
The lady in purple joins the ladies in blue, yellow, and orange. She starts by describing them as three friends who shared every aspect of their lives. They remember a time when they all were attracted to the same man, but he only could choose one of them. The one who he chose loved him, but worried if her friends could hold out. One day she found the rose she left on his pillow on her friend's desk. The friend said she did not know what was going on, because the man said he was free. The three friends did not want to hurt one another but they know how wonderful this man could be. The friends hug and cry and go to confront the man, whom they find with another woman. The women cry and comfort each other like sisters.

*"no more love poems #1" – Lady in Orange
The lady in orange discusses a relationship that left her heartbroken. She says that ever since she realized that someone would call a "colored girl an evil woman a bitch or a nag" (56) she has tried not to be that person. She tries and not only give joy, but receive it as well. She finds herself in what she believes to be a real and honest relationship. Yet, the guy keeps going back to his ex-lover. The lady in orange tried to move on by finding another lover, but she wasn't satisfied. She tried to avoid sadness, but she found herself heartbroken by this man.

*"no more love poems #2" – Lady in Purple
The lady in purple speaks about her relationship to dance and men. She deliberately chooses to dance with men who don't speak English, pops pills, and uses dance as an escape from reality. Then she meets a man who she gave everything: dance, fear, hope and scars. She admits she was ready to die, but now is ready to be herself and accept love. She pleads, "lemme love you just like i am / a colored girl/ i'm finally bein real".&lt;ref name=Shange58&gt;Shange, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

*"no more love poems #3" – Lady in Blue
The lady in blue proclaims that they all deal with too much emotion and that it might be easier to be white. That way they could make everything "dry &amp; abstract wit no rhythm &amp; no / reelin for sheer sensual pleasure".&lt;ref name=Shange58/&gt; The lady in blue states that they should try to control their feelings and she is going to take the first step by masturbating. However, she finds that this makes her feel lonely and doesn't know where to look to feel whole.

*"no more love poems #4" – Lady in Yellow
The lady in yellow claims to have lost touch with reality because she used to think she was immune to emotional pain, but she realized she is not. She gave her dance, but her dance was not enough. She says "bein alive &amp; bein a woman &amp; bein colored is a metaphysical / dilemma / i haven't conquered yet".&lt;ref&gt;Shange, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

*"my love is too" – Ladies in Yellow, Brown, Purple, Blue, Orange, Red, Green
The other women come each repeat, "my love is too...delicate/beautiful/sanctified/magic/saturday nite/complicated/music to have thrown back in my face."&lt;ref&gt;Shange, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; The ladies begin dancing and chanting together.

*"somebody almost walked off wid alla my stuff" – Lady in Green
The lady in green says that someone has taken all of her "stuff". She feels that she is the only one that knows and can appreciate the value of her stuff. She describes her stuff as the way she sits with her legs open sometimes, her chewed up fingernails, her rhythm, her voice, her talk, her "delicate leg and whimsical kiss".&lt;ref&gt;Shange, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;  The person who stole her stuff is a man. She made too much room for this man who has run off with her stuff, especially because he doesn't even know that he has it. By the end of the monologue she demands her stuff back from this man.

*"sorry" – Ladies in Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple
The ladies start talking about all the apologies they've received from men. Some examples include: he is sorry because he does not know how she got your number, sorry because he was high, sorry because he is only human, and sorry because he thought she could handle it. The lady in blue then declares that she does not need any more apologies. She goes on to say that men should keep their apologies for themselves, because she does not need them to soothe her soul and she cannot use them. Rather than accepting apologies, she is going to do whatever she wants: yell, scream, and break things. And she will not apologize for any of it.

*"positive" – Ladies in Red, Yellow, Purple, Brown
Lady in yellow, purple, brown, red participate in reciting the next poem about contracting HIV/AIDS; they share the lines and all speak to one woman's experience. The ladies argue about suspicions of cheating in the relationship. The lady in yellow tells her friends how happy she is in her relationship and her friend tells her, they've seen her lover outside the gay bars. The lady in yellow protests, but her friend tells her to get tested. The lady in yellow goes to get tested to put the whole issue to bed. Two weeks later, the doctor calls the lady in yellow with her patient number (#7QYG9) to inform her that she is HIV positive. The lady in yellow confronts her lover who furiously tells her he is not gay and accuses her of cheating on him. She tells him to get tested but he gets angrier and violent. He throws her to the ground and when she wakes up he is gone and she says, "&amp; i was positive / &amp; not positive at all".&lt;ref&gt;Shange, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

*"a nite with beau willie brown" – Lady in Red, Orange
The lady in orange begins the story of Willie Brown by saying there is no air. Beau Willie is all tied up in the sheets, wishing a friend would come over and bring him some blow or any other kind of drug. The lady in red continues the story, saying that Beau Willie claims there is nothing wrong with him. Beau Willie tried to get veterans' benefits but he cannot read, so he starts driving a cab around the city but the cops always give him a hard time and he is not making any money. The lady in orange and red say that Crystal is pregnant again and Beau beats Crystal almost to death when he hears about her pregnancy. Beau Willie has wanted to marry Crystal since she was 14 but now, she laughs in his face saying she will never marry him. She has the baby and there are now two kids, Naomi and Kwame. Crystal ends up getting a court order to keep Beau away from her and the children. Beau Willie comes to the house despite the court order and while he is there he becomes apologetic saying he just wants to marry her and give her things. The two children run to their father as Crystal watches. Suddenly, he grabs the kids and pushes the screen out of the window. Beau Willie tells Crystal she has to agree to marry him. Naomi and Kwame scream and Crystal, at the moment, can only whisper. Beau Willie drops the kids out of the window and they die.

*"a laying on of hands" – Ladies in Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Brown
The ladies begin the last poem saying that they are missing something: a "layin on of hands".&lt;ref&gt;Shange, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The hands are strong, cool, moving, and make them whole and pure. The lady in blue says she feels the gods coming into her, laying her open to herself. She goes on to say that she knows about laying her body open for a man, but still she was missing something. Finally, all the ladies repeat the lines she says, "i found god in myself / &amp; i loved her / I loved her fiercely".&lt;ref&gt;Shange, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; They sing to each other and then the audience, and close into a tight circle with each other. The choreopoem ends with lady in brown modifying her earlier statement: "&amp; this is for colored girls who have considered suicide/ but are movin to the ends of their own rainbows."

==Production history==
[[File:Ntozake Shange, Reid Lecture, Women Issues Luncheon, Women's Center, November 1978 Crisco edit.jpg|thumb|[[Ntozake Shange]], author of ''for colored girls'']]
''for colored girls...'' was first performed by Shange with four other artists at the Bacchanal, a women's bar, outside [[Berkeley, California]].&lt;ref name=CambridgeGuide&gt;Haring-Smith, Tori, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=F-MMwSBrdikC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;dq=%22ntozake+shange%22+outer+critics+Award&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BSK81BkK9-&amp;sig=EhyUXDPHk0klreZVS0nTlhF3AbI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjXjsb0qaneAhUBqaQKHe68D6IQ6AEwE3oECB8QAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ntozake%20shange%22%20outer%20critics%20Award&amp;f=false "For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf"], in Don B. Wilmeth with Tice L. Miller (eds), ''The Cambridge Guide to American Theatre'', Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Collins 717–752"/&gt; About six months after performing the work in California, Shange and her collaborator, Paula Moss, decided to move across the country determined to perform it in New York City's downtown alternative spaces.&lt;ref name="Collins 717–752" /&gt; At the age of 27, Shange moved to New York, where, in July 1975, the reworked ''for colored girls'' was professionally produced in [[New York City]] at [[Studio Rivbea]] in 1975.&lt;ref name="Effiong"/&gt;&lt;ref name=CambridgeGuide /&gt; 
East coast audiences were soon able to experience Shange’s performance piece at other venues including the Old Reliable, and DeMonte's beginning in July 1975 and then starting in March 1976 at the Henry Street Settlement’s [[New Federal Theatre]].&lt;ref name="Collins 717–752"/&gt; The show grew increasingly popular, especially among African-American and Latino audiences.&lt;ref name="Collins 717–752"/&gt; As a result, ''for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf'' opened at [[The Public Theater]] in June 1976. Three months later, in September, the show was performed at the Booth Theater on Broadway, where it was continued until July 1978 and ran for 742 shows.&lt;ref&gt;Shange, Ntozake.

==''American Playhouse'' television adaptation==
In 1982 the play was adapted for television on [[PBS]] station [[WNET-TV]], as part of the ''[[American Playhouse]]''.&lt;ref name="O'Connor"/&gt; The adaptation, directed by [[Oz Scott]], was seen as a serious departure from the Broadway production.&lt;ref name="West 191–208"/&gt;  A review by ''[[The New York Times]]'' states: "What Miss Shange prefers to call a ''choreopoem'' has been expanded into realistic settings that too often resemble the sanitized atmosphere of an episode of ''[[Good Times]]''. The net result has been a considerable reduction in the work's emotional impact."&lt;ref name="O'Connor"/&gt; As a result, the televised production is often seen as a diluted version of the original choreopoem.

==Film adaptation==
{{main|For Colored Girls}}

On March 25, 2009, the film industry magazine [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118001644?refCatId=13 ''Variety''] reported that Nzingha Stewart, a black female director, had acquired the feature film rights to ''for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf'' from Shange and that [[Lionsgate]] had signed Stewart to create a screenplay adaptation and direct the film version of the play.

Stewart, at Lionsgate's direction, approached [[Tyler Perry]] about producing the film. However, Perry told Lionsgate that if he produced it, he also wanted to write and direct it. Perry then usurped the project from Stewart and scrapped her script.&lt;ref name=root&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theroot.com/views/tyler-perrys-view-colored-girls|title=Tyler Perry Talks About 'For Colored Girls' on The View|first=Helena |last=Andrews|date= October 26, 2010|work=The Root}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shadowandact.com/?p=9656|title=Shadow and Act New Home - Shadow and Act|author=Shadow and Act|work=Shadow and Act}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift prompted controversy over whether Perry, panned for formulaic, low-brow productions had the skill and consciousness to properly depict an iconic feminist work. Stewart remained on in the token position of executive producer of the film.&lt;ref name=root/&gt;

On September 3, 2009, Lionsgate announced it had acquired the distribution rights to Tyler Perry's 34th Street Films adaptation of the play, with principal photography originally scheduled to take place in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], in November and December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2009/09/03/Perry-directing-For-Colored-Girls-film/UPI-10721252035492/ "Perry Directing 'For Colored Girls' Film"], [[UPI]], September 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The film, which was retitled ''For Colored Girls'', was released on November 5, 2010, and was written, directed and produced by Perry. The cast includes [[Thandie Newton]], [[Loretta Devine]], [[Kimberly Elise]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[Phylicia Rashad]], [[Anika Noni Rose]], [[Kerry Washington]], [[Tessa Thompson]], [[Michael Ealy]], [[Macy Gray]] and [[Omari Hardwick]].&lt;ref&gt;.  Vena, Jocelyn. [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1640173/20100527/carey_mariah.jhtml "Mariah Carey Drops Out Of Tyler Perry's 'For Colored Girls ...'"], MTV News, May 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mariah Carey]] had also been cast, but pulled out in May 2010, citing medical reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usmagazine.com/moviestvmusic/news/mariah-carey-drops-out-of-film-due-to-medical-reasons-2010275 "Mariah Carey Drops Out of Film Due to Medical Reasons"], [[Us (magazine)|Us]], May 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perry's decision to make the book into a film was not met without controversy, with some, such as [[Oprah Winfrey]], having expressed doubts over whether the book should be made into a film at all. Others had reservations based on Perry's position at the helm of such an important book in African American literature, particularly considering the controversies raised by ''[[Precious: Based on the Novel "Push" by Sapphire|Precious]]'', a film he lent his name to.&lt;ref&gt;Finke, Nikki (September 16, 2010), [http://www.deadline.com/2010/09/even-oprah-didnt-want-him-to-do-it-trailer-unveiled-for-tyler-perrys-colored-girls/ "Even Oprah Didn't Want Him To Do It!

When asked if she held reservations about Perry's adaptation of her work, Shange responded: "I had a lot of qualms. I worried about his characterizations of women as plastic."&lt;ref name="Shange"&gt;{{citation|first=Brooks |last=Barnes|title=Tyler Perry gets serious with new image, new film|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/movies/2013264517_tylerperry26.html|newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]|accessdate=November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to the film post-production, she stated that "I think he did a very fine job, although I'm not sure I would call it a finished film."&lt;ref name="Shange"/&gt;

==Legacy==
The title of ''[[For Colored Boys Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow is Still Not Enough: Coming of Age, Coming Out, and Coming Home]]'', a 2012 anthology of essays edited by [[Keith Boykin]], was based on the title of Shange's play.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Darnell L. (August 10, 2012), [http://thefeministwire.com/2012/08/tfw-interview-keith-boykin-on-for-colored-boys/ "TFW Interview: Keith Boykin on 'For Colored Boys'"], ''The Feminist Wire''.&lt;/ref&gt; Shange's work has also been transformed using different forms of media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow is Enuf|first=Jillian |last=Owens|url = http://www.austinchronicle.com/arts/2011-09-09/for-colored-girls-who-have-considered-suicide-when-the-rainbow-is-enuf/|work = Austin Chronicle|date=September 9, 2011| access-date = February 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been continually performed in colleges and universities, art spaces, and theaters throughout the world. It has been set in beauty shops, prisons, and other historical time periods. A Brazilian production dropped the word "color" in the title, and a group of women in [[Kentucky]] made it about class instead of race.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Fort Antoine Theatre''' is a small [[amphitheatre]] on the Avenue de la Quarantaine in the [[Monaco-Ville]] ward of [[Monaco]]. The fort hosts open air plays in the summer months.&lt;ref name='Mon'&gt;{{cite web|title=Fort Antoine|url=http://www.visitmonaco.com/en/Places-to-visit/Monuments/Fort-Antoine|work=Visit Monaco - Fort Antoine|publisher=Visit Monaco|accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre was originally constructed as a fortress in the early 18th-century before its destruction in 1944.&lt;ref name='Mon'/&gt; [[Rainier III|Prince Rainier III]] had the fortress rebuilt as a theatre in 1953.&lt;ref name='Mon'/&gt; The [[parapet]] of the fort is provided by [[pittosporum]] hedges.&lt;ref name='Mon'/&gt; The militaristic nature of its architecture has been retained with a [[bartizan]] and a pyramid of cannonballs at the centre of the theatre.&lt;ref name='Mon'/&gt;

Godzilla's contemporaries included Godzookie, and the Barnstormers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
The original members of Godzilla were [[Tomie Arai]], Ken Chu, [[Karin Higa]], Arlan Huang, [[Byron Kim]], Bing Lee, Colin Lee, Janet Lin, Mei-Lin Liu, Margo Machida, Stephanie Mar, Yong Soon Min, Helen Oji, Eugenie Tsai, Charles Yuen and Garson Yu.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art, Volume 1|last=Chang|first=Alexandra|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=0195335791|editor-last=Marter|editor-first=Joan M.|location=|pages=344}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=January 24, 1914|title=Karen Higa (1966-2013)|url=http://artforum.com/passages/id=45076|journal=ARTFORUM|last1=Joselit|first1=David|accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Godzilla's members were previously involved in [[Basement Workshop]] and [[Asian American Arts Centre|Asian American Art Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hyperallergic.com/330442/a-brief-history-of-the-art-collectives-of-nycs-chinatown/|title=A Brief History of the Art Collectives of NYC’s Chinatown|last=Wong|first=Ryan|date=February 7, 2017|website=Hyperallergic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members decided to name the organization "Godzilla" after Japanese movie monster [[Godzilla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://as-ap.org/content/oral-history-interview-ken-chu-1|title=Interview with Ken Chu, Co-Founder, Godzilla {{!}} Art Spaces Archives Project|website=as-ap.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collective organized "slide slams" where hundreds of artists had the opportunity to display their work as well as view other artists' works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who We Be: A Cultural History of Race in Post-Civil Rights America|last=Chang|first=Jeff|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2014|isbn=1466854650|location=|pages=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Godzilla also published a national newsletter that included member-written opinion pieces, coverage of Asian American art from across the United States, and calls for artwork. Because Godzilla members rejected formally becoming a [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)3 organization]], rotating volunteer committees coordinated much of its work. The Godzilla logo and newsletters were designed and produced by Charles Yuen.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Other notable artists and arts professionals who later joined Godzilla include artists [[Paul Pfeiffer (artist)|Paul Pfeiffer]], [[Zhang Hongtu]], [[Nina Kuo]], [[Allan deSouza]], and art critic Alice Yang.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

=== Whitney Biennial Protest ===
In the spring of 1991, members of Godzilla published a letter highlighting the historic absence of Asian American artists in the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]]'s [[Whitney Biennial|Biennial]]s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/23/arts/art-expressing-the-hyphen-in-asian-american.html|title=ART; Expressing the Hyphen in 'Asian-American'|last=Karmel|first=Pepe|date=1995-04-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-15|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/04/identity-politics-that-forever-changed-art.html|title=The Reviled Identity Politics Show That Forever Changed Art|date=2016-04-21|work=Vulture|access-date=2017-05-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collective chose to call attention to this absence in part because of the Whitney Biennial's influence in establishing trends in the American art scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://as-ap.org/content/oral-history-interview-margo-machida-1|title=Interview with Margo Machida, Co-Founder, Godzilla {{!}} Art Spaces Archives Project|website=as-ap.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Godzilla's letter, Whitney Museum director David Ross met with Godzilla members Tsai, Machida, Pfeiffer and others to discuss plans to expand minority representation the Whitney's curatorial staff, which was intended to in turn improve the representation of minority artists in the Whitney's future biennials.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Tsai was subsequently appointed as a curator at the Whitney in 1994.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Gustav Bauernfeind''' (4 September 1848, [[Sulz am Neckar]] - 24 December 1904, [[Jerusalem]]) was a German [[Painting|painter]], [[illustrator]] and architect of partly Jewish origin.&lt;ref&gt;Son père, pharmacien juif autrichien installé en Bade-Wurtemberg, s'était converti au catholicisme. Cf. Adrian Darmon, Autour de l'Art Juif, Ed. Carnot, 2003, p.125&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered to be one of the most notable [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] painters of Germany.

==Life and career==
After completing his architectural studies at the [[University of Stuttgart|Polytechnic Institute]] in [[Stuttgart]], he worked in the architectural firm of Professor Wilhelm Bäumer and later in that of Adolph Gnauth, where he also learned painting. In his earlier paintings, Bauernfeind focused on local views of Germany, as well as motifs from Italy. During his journey to the [[Levant]] from 1880 to 1882, he became interested in the [[Orient]] and repeated his travels again and again. In 1896 he moved with his wife and son all the way to Palestine and subsequently settled in Jerusalem in 1898. He also lived and worked in Lebanon and Syria.

His work is characterized primarily by architectural views of Jerusalem and the [[Holy Land]]. The paintings of Bauernfeind are mostly meticulously crafted, intricately composed and almost photographically accurate cityscapes and images of known sanctuaries in oil. In addition, he produced [[landscape art|landscape scenes]] and [[watercolor painting|watercolours]]. During his lifetime he was the most popular Orientalist painter of Germany, but soon fell into oblivion after his death. However, since the early 1980s, Bauernfeind was gradually rediscovered, with his paintings appearing at auctions with high prices. Thus, his oil painting ''The Wailing Wall'' was sold at [[Christie's]] in London for the equivalent of €326,000 in 1992. The same painting would reach at [[Sotheby's]] in London the equivalent of €4.5 million in a later auction in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Sefanie Stadel: ''Aufstieg eines Orientmalers.'' In: ''[[Welt am Sonntag]],'' Nr. 27/2007, S. 74&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, another oil painting of Bauernfeind, ''The Port of Jaffa'', was sold at the Van Ham Kunstauktionen in [[Cologne]] for 1,510,000 [[Deutsche Mark|DM]], thus becoming the most expensive 19th-century painting ever sold in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.van-ham.com/rekordgalerie/gdr/detail/neuere-meister/gustav-bauernfeind.html|title=Van Ham, Galerie der Rekorde|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At his birthplace in Sulz am Neckar, the life and work of the painter is commemorated by the Gustav Bauernfeind Museum with a large permanent exhibition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3199">The '''Hatun Kotama Flute School''' is part of a larger cultural center in the community of Kotama in [[Otavalo (city)|Otavalo]], [[Ecuador]]. The purpose of the center is to educate others about the world view and cultural expression of the Kotama community.&lt;ref name=elnorte&gt;{{cite news |first=Tupac |last=Lema |title=Las flautas de Kotama sonaron en EEUU |url=http://www.elnorte.ec/otavalo/actualidad/39034-las-flautas-de-kotama-sonaron-en-eeuu.html |work=El Norte |date=16 July 2013 |accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the school practice and teach traditional ''gaita'' music. The music is inspired by a deep connection with nature and the sounds that occur in everyday life, primarily utilizing the transverse flute, harmonica, and shells for instrumentation.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cachiguango |first1=Luis Enrique |first2=Julián |last2=Pontón| title=Yaku-Mama: La Crianza del Agua; La Música Ritual del Hatun Puncha – Inti Raymi en Kotama, Otavalo. |year=2010 |publisher= Ministerio de Cultura del Ecuador|location= Quito |isbn=9789942029317 |page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The school was founded in the early 2000s by Luis Enrique Cachiguango under the name "The Village of Kotama's First Native Indigenous Flute School." Later in August 2008 the school was reinitiated under the name Hatun Kotama Flute School.&lt;ref name=Liner&gt;{{cite web|last=M.

'''It's a Small World''' (officially styled as '''"it's a small world"''') is a [[water]]-based [[dark ride]] located in the [[Fantasyland]] area at the various [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]] worldwide; these include: [[Disneyland|Disneyland Park]] in [[Anaheim]], [[California]], the [[Magic Kingdom]] at [[Walt Disney World Resort]] in [[Lake Buena Vista]], [[Florida]], [[Tokyo Disneyland]], [[Disneyland Paris]], and [[Hong Kong Disneyland]]. The ride features over 300 [[audio-animatronic]]  children in traditional costumes from cultures around the world, frolicking in a spirit of international unity, and singing the attraction's title song, which has a theme of global peace.  According to [[Time.com]], the song "It's A Small World" is the most publicly performed song of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/82493/its-a-small-world-50th-anniversary/|title=Is ''This'' the Most Played Song in Music History?|author=Corliss, Richard (April 30, 2014)|work=time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orlandoweekly.com/orlando/fact-checking-saving-mr-banks-with-disney-historian-jim-korkis/Content?oid=2240838|title=Fact-Checking Saving Mr. Banks with Disney Historian Jim Korkis|author=Kubersky, Seth (January 7, 2014)|work=orlandoweekly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Fabricated at the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] as ''Children of the World'', it was created by [[Walt Disney Imagineering|WED Enterprises]], then shipped to the [[1964 New York World's Fair]]'s [[UNICEF]] pavilion, sponsored by [[Pepsi]], where it featured at its entrance a kinetic sculpture, ''The Tower of the Four Winds'', a 120-foot perpetually spinning mobile created by WED designer [[Rolly Crump]]. It was added to four attractions&amp;nbsp;— ''Magic Skyway'' (Ford), ''[[Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln]]'' (Illinois), ''[[The Carousel of Progress]]'' (General Electric), and ''CircleVision 360'' (Kodak)—already under development, which were used by Disney to sponsor, fund, and test concepts and develop ride systems and innovative entertainment intended to be moved and rebuilt at Disneyland after the World's Fair closed in 1966.

The Pepsi Board of Directors took so long to agree on what type of attraction to sponsor that then-board member and widow of past company president [[Alfred Steele]], actress [[Joan Crawford]], prevailed upon her longtime [[Hollywood]] friend [[Walt Disney]] to design such an attraction as would be suitable for Pepsi. Because of the short lead-time to design, create, and construct such an attraction, she insisted that the board of directors accept his proposal, seeing as he was already designing attractions for the state of [[Illinois]], Ford, [[General Electric]], and [[Kodak]] and knew Walt was the only one who could accomplish such a feat in the short time left until the fair was scheduled to open.&lt;ref&gt;Paul F. Anderson (2001). [http://www.nywf64.com/pepsi03.shtml "A Little Boat Ride: It's A Small World"]. Excerpted from "Disney and the 1964 New York World's Fair", ''Persistence of Vision'', Issue #6/#7. nywf64.com. Retrieved on November 4, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Walt Disney Imagineering|WED Enterprises]] company was given only 11 months to create and build the pavilion.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=fFTpQIwKjqY#t=4m00s}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mary Blair]] was responsible for the attraction's whimsical design and color styling. Blair had been an art director on several [[Walt Disney Feature Animation|Disney animated features]], including ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 Film)|Alice In Wonderland]]'', and ''[[Peter Pan (1953 movie)|Peter Pan]]''. Like many Disneyland attractions, scenes and characters were designed by [[Marc Davis (animator)|Marc Davis]], while his wife, [[Alice Davis]], designed the costumes for the dolls. Rolly Crump designed the toys and other supplemental figures on display. The animated dolls were designed and sculpted by Blaine Gibson. Walt was personally involved with Gibson's and Greg S. Marinello development of the dolls' facial design; each animated doll face is completely identical in shape.

[[Arrow Development]] was deeply involved in the design of the passenger-carrying boats and propulsion system of the attraction. Two patents that were filed by Arrow Development staff and assigned to The Walt Disney Company illustrate passenger boats and vehicle guidance systems with features very similar to those later utilized on the Disneyland installation of the attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=US|number=3404635|status=patent|title=Boat amusement ride|pubdate=October 8, 1968|fdate=April 16, 1965|invent1=Bacon, Karl W.|invent2=Morgan, Edgar A.|assign1=The Walt Disney Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=US|number=D204282|status=patent|title=Passenger-carrying amusement boat|pubdate=April 5, 1966|fdate=March 8, 1965|invent1=Morgan, Edgar A.|assign1=The Walt Disney Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm is credited with manufacturing the Disneyland installation.&lt;ref name=Gurr&gt;{{cite web|last=Gurr|first=Bob|title=DESIGN: Those Were The Times – No.23 1955 Arrow Development – Ed Morgan and Karl Bacon|url=http://micechat.com/49581-bob-gurr-arrow-development/|publisher=MiceChat|accessdate=28 November 2013|date=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Song/melody===
"Children of the World" was the working title of the attraction. Its tentative soundtrack, which can be heard on the album, featured the national anthems of each country represented throughout the ride all playing all at once, which resulted in disharmonic cacophony. Walt conducted a walk-through of the attraction scale model with his staff songwriters [[Robert B. Sherman]] and [[Richard M. Sherman]], saying, "I need ''one'' song that can be easily translated into many languages and be played as a round."&lt;ref name="OneSong"&gt;{{cite web| url        = http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=4691| title      = "It's a small world"  by  Disneyland Chorus| accessdate = July 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Sherman brothers then wrote "It's a Small World (After All)"&lt;ref name="iasw-a2z"&gt;{{cite book| last       = Smith| first      = Dave| authorlink = Dave Smith (archivist)| title      = Disney A to Z: The Official Disney Encyclopedia| publisher  = Disney Editions| year       = 2006| page       = 354| isbn       = 0-7868-4919-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the wake of the 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], which influenced the song's message of peace and brotherhood. When they first presented it to Walt, they played it as a slow ballad. Walt requested something more cheerful, so they sped up the tempo and sang in counterpoint. Walt was so delighted with the final result that he renamed the attraction "It's a Small World" after the Sherman Brothers' song.

[[Robert_J._Sherman | Robert J. Sherman]], youngest son of [[Robert B. Sherman]], has claimed that this song is the single most-performed and most-translated piece of music on [[Earth]].&lt;ref name="OneSong"/&gt; In 2014, it was estimated that the song had played nearly 50 million times worldwide on the attractions alone, beating out the radio and TV estimates for ''[[You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin']]'' and ''[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]'', which were believed to have been played at least eight and seven million times respectively.&lt;ref name="Time-Song Plays"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Corliss|first1=Richard|title=Is This the Most Played Song in Music History?|url=http://time.com/82493/its-a-small-world-50th-anniversary/|website=TIME.com|accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schneider|first1=Caitlin|title=The Most Frequently Played Song in the World is One Everyone Hates|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/73391/most-frequently-played-song-world-one-everyone-hates|website=Mental Floss|accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third verse celebrating the attraction's 45th anniversary was written and popularized, but not incorporated into the ride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2014/03/sights-and-sounds-of-disney-parks-its-a-classic-attraction-its-just-turned-50-its-a-small-world/ |title="Sights and Sounds of Disney Parks: It's a Classic Attraction.

==Global installations==

===1964 New York World's Fair===
[[File:PEPSI-COLA presents WALT DISNEY'S "it's a small world" a salute to UNICEF and all the world's children.png|thumb|The attraction debuted at the 1964 New York World's Fair.]]

The first incarnation of It's a Small World, which debuted at the 1964 New York World's Fair, was an afterthought and nearly did not happen. Ford and General Electric had engaged Disney early on to create their pavilions for the [[1964 New York World's Fair]]. WED Enterprises had already long been at work developing a "dancing-doll" designed to reproduce human movement resulting in a crude early [[Audio-Animatronics|audio-animatronics]] fashioned as [[Abraham Lincoln]] when the State of [[Illinois]] approached Disney to create the Illinois Pavilion, representatives of the state instantly approved after being "introduced" to the robotic figurehead. A nine wide-screen ''CircleVision 360°'' exhibit for [[Kodak]]'s pavilion was also being planned as an improvement over the existing Disneyland eleven 4:3 format screen ''Circarama'' (which later failed the installation deadline for opening) when [[Pepsi]] approached Disney with a plan to tribute [[UNICEF]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;Disney seemed to be the showman to give us the package we want&amp;nbsp;... He's terrific. He's got his hands in more bowls than anyone I've ever seen, but he accomplishes what he sets out to do.&amp;nbsp;— J.G. Mullaly, Ford's World's Fair program manager.&lt;ref&gt;Walt Disney Conversations, p.83 {{ISBN|1-57806-713-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:"A salute to the children of the world, designed by Walt Disney, presents animated figures frolicking in miniature settings of many lands. Visitors are carried past the scenes in small boats. In an adjoining building Pepsi sponsors exhibits by the U.S. Committee for the United Nations Children's Fund. Above the pavilion rises the 120-foot Tower of the Four Winds, a fanciful creation of coloured shapes that dance and twist in the breeze."&amp;nbsp;– 1965 Official Guide Book to the New York World's Fair&lt;ref name=designing&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The attraction was incredibly successful. Ten million 60¢ and 95¢ tickets for children and adults, respectively, were collected in two half-year seasons and the proceeds were donated to [[UNICEF]].&lt;ref name="designing" /&gt; While other attractions had lines out the doors, there seemed to always be a seat available aboard It's a Small World. Its high rider-per-hour capacity was recognized as a valuable innovation and was incorporated indirectly and directly into future attractions. [[Pirates of the Caribbean (attraction)|Pirates of the Caribbean]] had been under construction at Disneyland as a subterranean walk-through. That design was scrapped as concrete was broken out so similar boats could sail past scenes which (because the original walk-through scene length was not shortened) were now different each voyage, another concept which forever influenced attraction design and popularity.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Disneyland===
The boats enter the show building through a tunnel under the Small World clock and emerge from the attraction fifteen minutes later. The [[show building]] interior is larger than the façade. Voyagers see [[Audio-Animatronics|animatronic]] dolls in traditional local costumes singing "It's a Small World (After All)" together, each in their native [[language]]. Boats carry voyagers as they visit the regions of the world.

Other Disney park installations wind the [[flume]] around one large room, emphasizing its theme that the world is small and interconnected. Each installation may vary the countries which are represented and the order in which they appear. The boats are stored behind the facade and go in and out backstage in between the Spanish room.

====Exterior====
[[File:It's a small world (28317874165).jpg|thumb|It's a Small World at Disneyland]]
The Tower of the Four Winds was not relocated to Disneyland's It's a Small World after the New York World's Fair; in its place is an outdoor oval flume and boarding queue decorated with topiary backed by a large, flat facade with stylized cutout turrets, towers and minarets which are vaguely reminiscent of world landmarks (such as the [[Eiffel Tower]] and the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]]). The facade was designed by Disney Imagineer Rolly Crump, who was inspired by Mary Blair's styling. Walt Disney asked Rolly to design a large 30-foot [[clock]], a central feature of the exterior facade, with a smiling [[face]] that rocks back and forth to a ticking sound.

A parade of wooden dolls in native [[culture]] costumes dance out from doors at the base of the Small World clock to an instrumental [[toy soldier]] version of "It's a Small World (After All)" in preparation for each quarter-hour, reminiscent of a European [[automaton clock]]. As the last doll returns into the clock, the parade doors close and the large central pair of doors open to reveal two giant toy blocks – the large block displays stylized [[numeral system|numeral]]s of the hour, the small one displays the minutes, while large and small [[Bell (instrument)|bell]]s toll to count the hours and quarters.

The exterior has been subtly repainted over the years, first as all-[[white]] with a gold/silver trim, then in various shades of [[blue]], then in pink and white with pastel accents. Portions of the left side of the original facade were removed in 1993 to make room for the entrance to Mickey's Toontown. As of 2015, the facade is white with a gold trim as it was in 1966, except the original gold and silver paint of the clock, the smiling clock face, is now entirely gold leaf. The [[garden]]s around the building are decorated with [[topiary]] animals.

During the 2005–2006 holiday season, an elaborate multimedia presentation was projected on the outdoor façade which registered colored patterns matched to the façade each quarter-hour after dusk. Guests were encouraged to view the popular ''[[Remember... Dreams Come True]]'' fireworks presentation from the It's a Small World Mall and nearby parade viewing platform built for [[Light Magic]] (which had included a smoking area, now relocated under the Monorail track between the [[Matterhorn Bobsleds]] and [[Autopia]]) to decrease overwhelming crowds gathered for viewing the fireworks spectacular in Plaza and Main Street.

====Refurbishment with new dolls====
Disneyland's "It's a Small World" was closed from January to November 2008 (closed and reopening in holiday version, skipping the summer season) to receive a major refurbishment.&lt;ref name="refurb"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyland/its-a-small-world/ | title="It's a Small World" attraction page | accessdate=February 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=refurb2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disneys-small-world-get-big-154781|title=Disney's 'Small World' to get big retrofit|author=Associated Press{{pipe}}AP|date=November 10, 2007|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="refurb3"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mouseplanet.com/8620/Disneyland_Resort_Update | title=MousePlanet DLR Update | accessdate=April 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The building's structure was improved, permanent attachments created for the "It's a Small World Holiday" overlay, the water flume replaced and its propulsion upgraded to electric water jet turbines, and the attraction's aging fiberglass boats redesigned in durable plastic. The refurbishment added 29 new Disney characters, each in their native land in a similar manner to the Hong Kong Disneyland version. This similar plan originally supposed to be in Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom, but it’ll most likely happen sometime in 2021 for the 50th anniversary of the Walt Disney World Resort and Walt Disney World’s Magic Kingdom...

[[Osram Sylvania|Sylvania]] has agreed to a twelve-year sponsorship. In 2014, the sponsor logo at the attraction's entrance changed to that of [[Siemens]], the parent company of Sylvania.

====''The Magic, the Memories and You''====

{{see also|Celebrate! Tokyo Disneyland}} 

As part of Disney's "Let the Memories Begin" campaign for 2011, a nighttime projection show premiered at [[Disneyland]]'s It's a Small World in Anaheim on January 27, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2011/01/new-projection-show-turns-small-world-into-a-big-canvas-for-the-magic-the-memories-and-you/ | title= New Projection Show Turns ‘Small World’ Into a Big Canvas, for ‘The Magic, The Memories and You'| accessdate=April 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Magic, the Memories and You'' show projected sequences of Disney attractions and characters set to Disney music onto the exterior façade of It's a Small World to fill its architectural features, personalized with exclusive photographs and videos of park guests taken that day by [[Disney's PhotoPass]] cast members. The show also existed in [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Magic Kingdom]], but was projected onto [[Cinderella Castle]]. As the "Let the Memories Begin" campaign drew to a close, the show ended its run on Labor Day, September 3, 2012 at both locations. The Florida version was eventually replaced by ''[[Celebrate the Magic]]'' in fall 2012 and later by ''[[Once Upon a Time (Disney parks)|Once Upon a Time]]'' in 2016. ''The Magic, The Memories and You'' theme song later rewritten for ''[[Celebrate! Tokyo Disneyland]]'' as part of the [[Tokyo Disney Resort]] 35th Anniversary celebration that premiered at [[Tokyo Disneyland]] in July 10th 2018 which also created as nod and tribute for the former nighttime projection show.

===Magic Kingdom===
On October 1, 1971, a version of the ride opened in Florida's [[Walt Disney World]] Fantasyland within the [[Magic Kingdom]]. The boarding queue was built inside, and the three-dimensional facade that is seen outdoors in the other Disney parks was instead located in a slightly smaller scale along the far wall. The clock lacks the parade of wooden dolls, and instead goes straight to opening the central pair of doors to reveal the time. The toy company [[Mattel]] sponsored the attraction from 1991 until 1998, when it transferred its sponsorship to another Magic Kingdom attraction, [[Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin]] in nearby [[Tomorrowland]] from that attraction's opening in 1998 until 1999, when it also dropped its sponsorship of that attraction, thus ending Mattel's history as a Walt Disney World sponsor.

===Tokyo Disneyland===
[[File:"it's a small world" at TDL.jpg|thumb|It's a Small World at Tokyo Disneyland]]
The Tokyo Disneyland version of the attraction is identical in layout to the Magic Kingdom version except for these differences:
* The façade's design is an almost-complete replica of the California counterpart under a different color scheme, resembling Disneyland's 1990s version.
* The loading area is split into two zones instead of one.
* A Welcome room was added during the 2018 refurbishment, resembling the one at the California version.
* There are scenes featuring various Disney characters redesigned in Mary Blair’s style that were added during the 2018 refurbishment.
* The Asian room features radically different sets and dolls for Japan and China compared to the Magic Kingdom version. A Mandarin language track was added to the China section in the 2018 refurbishment.
* The ride uses a different, more recent recording of the song sung in Japanese specifically created for this version instead of the original Japanese recording. The vocal track is used for both the Asian room and finale room.
* The walls of the African, South American, and Polynesian rooms are painted in colors similar to the Magic Kingdom version before its 2005 renovation compared to the current black walls in the Magic Kingdom version.
* The Polynesian room has vocals singing in English.
* The Goodbye room resembles the one found at the California version.

====2018 refurbishment====
On March 1, 2017, Tokyo Disneyland's version of "It's a Small World" closed down for refurbishment for its first major update since the park's opening in 1983. Reopened on April 8, 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyodisneyresort.jp/en/calendar/event.html|title=Tokyo Disney Resort Event Calendar|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; coinciding with Tokyo Disneyland's 35th anniversary, the attraction featured 40 characters from Disney properties including ''[[Cinderella (franchise)|Cinderella]]'', ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'', ''[[The Aristocats]]'', ''[[Brave (2012 film)|Brave]]'', ''[[The Little Mermaid (franchise)|The Little Mermaid]]'', ''[[Aladdin (franchise)|Aladdin]]'', ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', ''[[The Jungle Book (franchise)| The Jungle Book]]'', ''[[The Lion King (franchise)|The Lion King]]'', ''[[Hercules (franchise)|Hercules]]'', ''[[The Three Caballeros]]'', ''[[Mulan (franchise)|Mulan]]'', ''[[Tangled (franchise)|Tangled]]'', ''[[Lilo &amp; Stitch (franchise)|Lilo &amp; Stitch]]'', ''[[Frozen (franchise)|Frozen]]'', ''[[Finding Nemo (franchise)| Finding Nemo]]'' and ''[[Moana (2016 film)|Moana]]'' similar to its counterparts in California and Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyodisneyresort.jp/blog/pr161124/|title=東京ディズニーランドのアトラクション「イッツ・ア・スモールワールド」がリニューアル！さらに幸せな船旅に。 {{!}} 【公式】東京ディズニーリゾート・ブログ|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://d23.com/all-the-magical-art-you-need-to-see-for-tokyo-disney-resorts-35th-anniversary-celebration/?share_token=d1a0ae56ff|title=All the Magical Art You Need to See for Tokyo Disney Resort’s 35th Anniversary Celebration|publisher=Jocelyn Buhlman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attraction was initially set to be relocated to another area in Fantasyland with a new facade similar to the California counterpart as part of original expansion plans announced in October 2014 for the resort within the next ten years before being revised and updated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tdrexplorer.com/tokyo-disney-resort-expansions-announced/|title=Tokyo Disney Resort Expansions Announced|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The updated version of the attraction soft opened on April 8, 2018, revealing a redone color scheme for the façade, a new tick-tock sound and parade music (similar to the ones used in Hong Kong, Anaheim, and Orlando), an entirely redone loading area dubbed “Small World Station,” a new Welcome room, an extended Goodbye room, redone set pieces, and music tracks new to the ride including a Mandarin language track added to the China scene formerly exclusive to the Hong Kong version along with the aforementioned Disney characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wdwnt.com/2018/04/photos-video-its-a-small-world-returns-at-tokyo-disneyland-loaded-with-disney-characters/|title=PHOTOS, VIDEO: “it’s a small world” Returns At Tokyo Disneyland Loaded With Disney Characters|publisher=Jose Castillo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disneyland Paris===
The attraction at Disneyland Paris is a departure from other versions of the attraction. The façade features rearranged and slightly redesigned landmarks with a completely different clock tower. The exterior clock face features a wide-awake sun on its left half and a sleeping moon on its right half. Unlike all other versions of the ride, every scene is housed in one room with arches being used to define sections of the ride. The scenery design is a complete departure from Mary Blair's distinctive style, though the dolls used remain identical to all other versions. The ride also uses a completely different soundtrack composed by [[John Debney]] (which was also used for roughly a decade at the Californian version from the early 1990s to the early 2000s), which can be described as more ornate compared to the original soundtrack. This is the first version of the ride to incorporate a scene for North America with dolls representing [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], and a distinct Middle Eastern section with dolls singing in [[Arabic]].  In the Finale room, in addition to the song being sung in English, it is also sung in French and German. Also, the attraction had a post-show area called World Chorus that was sponsored by [[Orange S.A.|France Télécom]], which opened with the park in 1992 and then closed in 2010 to make way for the Princess Pavilion meet and greet area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dlptoday.com/2009/01/13/france-telecom-hangs-up-on-small-world/|title=France Télécom hangs up on "small world"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2015 refurbishment====
As part of an ongoing plan to refurbish several attractions for the park's 25th anniversary, this version went under an extensive refurbishment for six months before it reopened on December 19, 2015. The refurbishment included a different color scheme for the façade that is identical to the color scheme when it first opened, restored assets and special effects, refurbished boats, new LED lighting to replace the old stage lighting, and all 176 dolls in the ride being progressively replaced through 2017. The entrance and exit rooms have been completely revamped, being identical to the entrance scene in Hong Kong Disneyland's version and the exit scene in the Magic Kingdom and Hong Kong Disneyland versions (rendered in the Mary Blair style similar to the other parks). The soundtrack has been completely remastered with the base instrumental removed from the majority of the ride's audio except for the finale, making the soundtrack more similar to the original version. Additionally, new audio tracks are added including a new recording of someone yodeling to the tune of the song in the Switzerland scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disneylandparis-news.com/en/its-a-small-world-beautifed-boats/|title=Beautified boats at "it's a small world"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong Disneyland===
[[File:HKDL It's a small world dusk view 2012.jpg|thumb|It's a Small World at Hong Kong Disneyland]]
The Hong Kong Disneyland version of the attraction is mostly modeled after the original Disneyland counterpart, using a canal for the boats to travel through instead of the open-ended water track found in the Magic Kingdom, Tokyo, and Paris versions. Some of this version's prominent and unique characteristics include:
* 38 Disney characters (all rendered in the Mary Blair style) added to scenes where their stories originated&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|jZHZDcgCao8|Hong Kong Disneyland 2008 promo}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plan was originally supposed for the Magic Kingdom version of the attraction.
* An expanded Asia sequence with Hong Kong, the Philippines and Korea represented with children singing in Cantonese, Tagalog and Korean, respectively, as well as an extended China scene with represented with children singing in Mandarin
* A distinct Middle Eastern room, and scenes for North America, similar to the Paris version
* Extraordinary [[fiber-optic]] lighting effects in the Finale room not seen on any other Disney attraction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hkdlsource.com/news/viewstory&amp;story=73 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309154743/http://www.hkdlsource.com/news/viewstory%26story%3D73 |archivedate=March  9, 2014 |title=Three New Attractions in 2007 and 2008 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]], and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] versions of the song that were specifically recorded for Hong Kong Disneyland. The finale is sung in three languages: Cantonese, English and Mandarin.

The attraction is the largest indoor attraction at Hong Kong Disneyland. It is situated beyond the Hong Kong Disneyland Railroad, next to Disney's Storybook Theater where Mickey and the Wondrous Book is performed daily.

==Holiday overlay==
[[File:Smallworldholiday.jpg|thumb|250px|left|"It's a Small World holiday" lighting display]]

Since 1997, Disneyland has featured "It's a Small World holiday" during the end-of-the-year [[Christmas and holiday season]]. The attraction is closed in late October to receive temporary holiday decorations inside and outside, and reopens in early November before the start of the busy holiday tourist season. Almost one million lights are included during the holidays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Eades|first1=Mark|title=How Disneyland transforms Small World for holidays|newspaper=[[The Orange County Register]]|date=November 27, 2016|page=Local News 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overlay has proved very popular and has led to the installation of [[Disney's Fastpass|Fastpass]] machines. The attraction is the same boat voyage through many regions of the world, though the main theme song is not played in full.  Instead, the children sing "[[Jingle Bells]]" and a bridge of "[[Deck the Halls]]" in addition to the main theme.  The holiday overlay has since been implemented at Tokyo Disneyland with similar decorations.

Since the holiday 2009 season, the Disney characters and The Spirit of America room (formerly the covered transition room) have joined in the "It's a Small World holiday" at Disneyland.

Disneyland Paris' version used to add subtle decorations around the attraction and changed the music in the North American area to "Deck The Halls". For the 2009 winter season, Disneyland Paris has added "It's a Small World celebration", a variation of "It's a Small World holiday" highlighting winter season frolic shared by people worldwide. It includes new costumes, lighting, sounds, decorations and uses the Disneyland (California) version "It's a Small World holiday" music – Jingle Bells, Deck the Halls. Following the 2015 renovation, "It's a Small World celebration" was planned to use an updated soundtrack originally set for Winter 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disneylandparis-news.com/en/its-a-small-world-reopening-behind-the-scenes-with-tracy-eck-walt-disney-imagineering/|title="it's a small world" is reopening : interview with Tracy Eck from Walt Disney Imagineering|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was delayed for unknown reasons. “It’s a Small World celebration” resumed once again for the 2017 holiday season, featuring the updated soundtrack revealing that the base instrumental for the soundtrack was removed for every scene except the North America and finale scenes, similar to the non-holiday soundtrack.

Hong Kong Disneyland's "It's a Small World Christmas" changes the music seasonally and subtly adds a few Christmas decorations as well as an abridged version of the Holiday soundtrack, only ran from 2009-10.

Tokyo Disneyland also has a version of "It's a Small World holiday" called "It's a Small World Very Merry Holidays". It ran seasonally from November to January from 2003 to 2014. Due to damaged set pieces as a result of the 2011 earthquake, in December 1, 2018 with New Disney Characters once again for the 2018 holiday seasons, featuring the updated soundtrack revealing that the base instrumental for the soundtrack, similar to the non-holiday soundtrack.

The Magic Kingdom does not have its own holiday edition of "It's a Small World", and the regular ride operates continuously through the holiday season.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9323">This is a '''list of building materials'''.  Many types of [[building material]]s are used in the [[construction]] industry to create [[:Category:Buildings and structures|buildings and structures]].

These categories of materials and products are used by [[architect]]s and construction [[project manager]]s to specify the materials and methods used for [[Construction|building projects]].

Some building materials like cold rolled steel framing are considered modern methods of construction, over the traditionally slower methods like blockwork and timber.  Many building materials have a variety of uses, therefore it is always a good idea to consult the manufacturer to check if a product is best suited to your requirements.

==Catalogs==
Catalogs distributed by architectural product suppliers are typically organized into these groups.

'''Maria Aurelia Capmany i Farnés''' ([[Barcelona]], 3 August 1918 – 2 October 1991) was a [[Catalans|Catalan]] novelist, playwright and essayist of Catalan descent. She was also a prominent feminist cultural and anti-[[Francisco Franco|Franco]] activist.

Along with the writers [[Manuel de Pedrolo]], [[Jordi Sarsanedas]], [[Joan Perucho]], and [[Josep Maria Espinàs]], Capmany co-authored, ''Cita de narradors'' ("Rendezvous of Narrators") (1958), which was awarded the Josep Yxart Essay Prize.&lt;ref name=lletrA&gt;{{cite web|title=Maria Aurèlia Capmany|url=http://www.lletra.net/en/author/maria-aurelia-capmany|publisher=lletrA|accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Granddaughter of Sebastià Farnés (1854-1934), intellectual author of ''Paremiologia catalana comparada'', and daughter of Aureli Capmany i Farrés, folklorist and contributor of children's magazines, she spent her youth in the family's apartment near [[La Rambla, Barcelona|la Rambla]] in Barcelona. She studied at the Institut-Escola de la Generalitat de Catalunya and she graduated on Philosophy at the [[University of Barcelona]] after the war.

She practiced teaching during the 40s and 50s at the Institut Albéniz of [[Badalona]] and at the Escola Isabel de Villena in Barcelona. She also worked engraving glass, a job that she had learnt at University.

With her first novel ''Necessitem morir'' (''We need to die'') (published in 1952), she got to the final of the [[Premi Sant Jordi de novel·la|Joanot Martorell Price]] of 1947, price that she won the following year with ''El cel no és trasparent'' (''The sky is not transparent''). Her prestige as a narrator would arrive with novels like ''Betúlia'', ''El gust de la pols'' (''The flavour of dust'') and especially for ''Un lloc entre els morts'' (''A place for the death''), [[Premi Sant Jordi de novel·la|Sant Jordi Price]] of 1968. In 1981 she received the Ramon Fuster Price, given by the Col·legi Oficial de Doctors i Llicenciats en Filosofia i Lletres i en Ciències de Catalunya&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdl.cat/premis|accessdate=14 March 2014|title=Premis|editor=Col·legi Oficial de Doctors i Llicenciats en Filosofia i Lletres i en Ciències de Catalunya}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1983 she won the Premi Crítica Serra d'Or de Literatura Infantil i Juvenil with ''El malefici de la reina d'Hongria'' (''The curse of the Hungarian Queen'').

She was one of the most versatile Catalan writers, as apart from writing fiction, she was also devoted to translation, and she worked on the theatrical genre as well as on other literary genres.

In the field of [[dramaturgy]], she founded in 1959 the Escola d'Art Dramàtic Adrià Gual (School of Dramatic Arts Adrià Gual) together with Ricard Salvat. She exercised as a teacher, actress and headmaster. Besides, she premiered own plays, such as ''Preguntes i respostes sobre la vida i la mort de [[Francesc Layret]] advocat dels obrers de Catalunya'' (''Answers and questions about life and dead of Francesc Layret, lawyer of Catalan workers'').

As an essay writer, she excelled for her works on the situation of women, especially with ''La dona a Catalunya: consciència i situació'' (''The woman in Catalonia: awareness and situation'') in 1966. The same year, she took part in the Caputxinada, an assembly against the Spanish dictator [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]. She also devoted many articles to several aspects of Catalan culture and society. The book of memories ''Pedra de toc'' (1 and 2), ''Mala memòria'', and ''Això era i no era'' also excelled.

She took part and intervened in the ''Míting de la Llibertat'' (''Meeting of freedom'') (June 22, 1976) and in the constitutional process of [[Socialist Party of Catalonia-Congress]] (November 1976).

She was councillor and responsible for Culture and Editions at Barcelona's Town Hall during the first legislatures of the [[Socialists' Party of Catalonia]] (PSC) and member of the Diputation of Barcelona, since 1983 until she died on 2 October 1991. She was also member of the [[Associació d'Escriptors en Llengua Catalana]], and president of the Catalan PEN Club, the Catalan version of the [[PEN International]].

[[File:Edward Gibbon by Henry Walton cleaned.jpg|thumb|Edward Gibbon, by Henry Walton, 1773]]
'''''Memoirs of My Life and Writings''''' (1796) is an account of the historian [[Edward Gibbon]]'s life, compiled after his death by his friend [[John Baker Holroyd, 1st Earl of Sheffield|Lord Sheffield]] from six fragmentary autobiographical works Gibbon wrote during his last years.  Lord Sheffield's editing has been praised for its ingenuity and taste, but blamed for its unscholarly aggressiveness.  Since 1896 several other editions of the work have appeared, more in accordance with modern standards.  Gibbon's ''Memoirs'' are considered one of the first autobiographies in the modern sense of the word, and have a secure place in the canon of English literature.

== Synopsis ==

Gibbon begins with an account of his ancestors before moving on to his birth and education, which was partly private and partly at [[Westminster School]].  He matriculated as a student at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], an institution which he found at a low ebb.
&lt;blockquote&gt;To the university of Oxford I acknowledge no obligation; and she will as cheerfully renounce me for a son, as I am willing to disclaim her for a mother. I spent fourteen months at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]]; they proved the fourteen months the most idle and unprofitable of my whole life.{{sfn|Sheffield|1837|p=22}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Of one of his tutors Gibbon says that he "well remembered that he had a salary to receive, and only forgot that he had a duty to perform."{{sfn|Sheffield|1837|p=27}}  Gibbon's father took alarm on learning that he had converted to Roman Catholicism and, in order to bring him back to the Protestant fold, sent him to live with a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] minister in [[Lausanne]].  Gibbon made good use of his time in [[Switzerland]], meeting [[Voltaire]] and other literary figures, and perfecting his command of the French language.  He also fell in love with a Swiss girl, [[Suzanne Curchod]], but his wish to marry her was implacably opposed by his father.  "I sighed as a lover, I obeyed as a son."{{sfn|Sheffield|1837|p=48}}  On returning to England he published his first work, the ''Essai sur l'étude de la littérature''.  The next major event Gibbon mentions was his taking a commission in the [[67th (South Hampshire) Regiment of Foot|Hampshire militia]], an experience which he tells us was later to be of advantage to him:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The discipline and evolutions of a modern battalion gave me a clearer notion of the [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]] and the [[Roman legion|legion]]; and the captain of the Hampshire grenadiers (the reader may smile) has not been useless to the historian of the Roman empire.{{sfn|Sheffield|1837|p=62}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He then details his travels through France and on to Lausanne, where he formed a friendship with John Holroyd, later Lord Sheffield, which was to last for the rest of his life.  Gibbon crossed the Alps into Italy and eventually reached Rome.  He had for some time wanted to begin writing a history, without being able to choose a subject, but now, he tells us, the exciting experience of walking in the footsteps of the heroes of antiquity gave him a new idea:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It was at Rome, on the 15th of October, 1764, as I sat musing amidst the ruins of the Capitol, while the bare-footed friars were singing vespers in the temple of Jupiter, that the idea of writing the decline and fall of the city first started to my mind.{{sfn|Sheffield|1837|p=82}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
After returning to England Gibbon engaged in several other literary exercises before finally beginning to write [[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|his Roman history]].  The ''Memoirs'' now give a detailed account of the years he spent producing its successive volumes, and of the many hostile criticisms his work attracted.  These labours were diversified by his experiences as a [[Member of Parliament]], and his writing, at the request of the Government, a "Mémoire justificatif" asserting the justice of [[France in the American Revolutionary War|British hostilities against France]] at the time of the [[American Revolutionary War]].  During the course of writing the ''Decline and Fall'' Gibbon moved back to Lausanne.  Gibbon's ''Memoirs'' end with a survey of the factors he considered had combined to bring him a happy and productive life.

== Composition and manuscripts ==

Gibbon wrote a short account of his life in French in 1783.{{sfn|Bowersock|2009|p=47}} For five years he made no attempt to add to this, but in June 1788, one month after the last volumes of ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' were published, he began work on the ''Memoirs'' by writing to the [[College of Arms]] for information about his ancestry.  For the remaining years of his life he struggled with the task of recording his life in a satisfactory way, and his death in 1794 came before he could resolve the problem.  Six attempts at an autobiography have survived, conventionally identified by the letters '''A''' to '''F''':{{sfn|Gawthrop|1999|pp=188–189}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''A''': ''The Memoirs of the life of Edward Gibbon with various observations and excursions by himself'' (1788–1789).  40 [[quarto]] pages (6 missing).&lt;br/&gt;'''B''': ''My own Life'' (1788–1789).  72 quarto pages.  Describes the first 27 years of his life.&lt;br/&gt;'''C''': ''Memoirs of the life and writings of Edward Gibbon'' (1789).  41 [[folio]] pages plus insert.  Describes the first 35 years of his life.&lt;br/&gt;'''D''': [Untitled] (1790–1791).  13 folio pages.  Describing the first 35 years of his life.&lt;br/&gt;'''E''': ''My own Life'' (c. 1792–1793).  19 folio pages of text, and twelve of notes.  Describing the first 54 years of his life.&lt;br/&gt;'''F''': [Untitled] (1792–1793).  41 folio pages of text, and 7 of notes.  Describing the first 16 years of his life.{{sfn|Smith|1989|p=29}}{{sfn|Gawthrop|1999|pp=189, 191}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the drafts of the work succeeded each other Gibbon in some passages varied the emphasis, and even changed the facts, but where he was satisfied with the words of the previous version he simply transcribed them.{{sfn|Womersley|2004–2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edwardgibbonstudies.com/EG-MiscWorks5.htm |title=Edward Gibbon – Miscellaneous Works |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Edward Gibbon Studies |accessdate=11 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130914105442/http://www.edwardgibbonstudies.com/EG-MiscWorks5.htm |archivedate=14 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  '''E''' is the only version to cover his whole life, and perhaps the only one he wrote with a view to publication during his own lifetime,{{sfn|Womersley|2002|p=209}} but it omits many things included in the other versions.  As he wrote to Lord Sheffield,
&lt;blockquote&gt;A man may state many things in a posthumous work, that he might not in another; the latter often checks the introduction of many curious thoughts and facts.{{sfn|Womersley|2002|p=210}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Gibbon's struggles with his autobiography were ended by his death in 1794.  All six manuscripts then fell into the hands of his literary executor, Lord Sheffield, who used them to produce his own composite edition.  They remained undisturbed in the possession of his family, until in 1871 his son [[George Holroyd, 2nd Earl of Sheffield]], lent them to the medical writer [[William Alexander Greenhill]], who established their chronological order of composition and gave them the letters by which they are now always identified.  In 1895 the manuscripts were sold by the [[Henry Holroyd, 3rd Earl of Sheffield|3rd earl]] to the [[British Museum]], where they were bound together. They remain in the [[British Library]] as Add. MS. 34874.{{sfn|Bonnard|1964|p=207}}{{sfn|Smith|1989|pp=17, 29–30}}{{sfn|Womersley|2004–2013}}

== Editing and publication ==

Attempting to bring the manuscripts into a publishable state, Lord Sheffield found himself in a quandary.  Of all the versions available to him, only '''E''' could be called a complete narrative of Gibbon's life up to the 1790s, yet this one was very short on detail, and by no means a substantial work.  The other manuscripts were more circumstantial, but all left the story unfinished.  His solution was to produce a composite version, taking passages or individual sentences from each, especially from '''F''', and shaping them into an artistically satisfying whole.{{sfn|Gawthrop|1999|pp=196–197}}{{sfn|Womersley|2004–2013}}{{sfn|Womersley|2002|p=239}}  Choosing the title ''Memoirs of My Life and Writings'', he made the resulting work the centerpiece of a collection of inedited Gibboniana published in 1796 in two quarto volumes as ''[[Miscellaneous Works of Edward Gibbon|Miscellaneous Works of Edward Gibbon Esquire]]''.{{sfn|Womersley|2002|p=7}}{{sfn|Gawthrop|1999|pp=196–197}}  The work was reprinted many times through the 19th century, and remained the only published form of Gibbon's autobiography until 1896, when the publisher [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] produced an edition giving the full text of all six manuscripts.{{sfn|Anon.|1897|p=210}}  Two years later the American scholar [[Oliver Farrar Emerson]] edited the manuscripts along similar lines.{{sfn|Bonnard|1964|p=207}}  In 1966 Georges Bonnard returned to Lord Sheffield’s plan of producing an [[Textual criticism#Eclecticism|eclectic]] edition, though with far greater scholarly conscientiousness.{{sfn|Burgess|1966|p=521}}  The last major new edition of Gibbon's ''Memoirs'' was the work of [[Betty Radice]], and appeared in the Penguin English Library series in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Craddock |first1=Patricia B. |authorlink1=Patricia Craddock |title=Edward Gibbon: A Reference Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=4ZYnUpSXK5CXhQeD7oAw&amp;id=yoXgAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22memoirs+of+my+life%22+gibbon+radice+bonnard&amp;q=radice+harmondsworth#search_anchor |accessdate=11 September 2013 |year=1987 |publisher=G. K. Hall |location=Boston |isbn=0816182175 |page=427 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

So high is the critical repute of Gibbon's ''Memoirs'' that ''[[The Cambridge History of English and American Literature|The Cambridge History of English Literature]]'' declared it had "by general consent…established itself as one of the most fascinating books of its class in English literature".{{sfn|Ward|1913|p=299}}  One reason for this is the candour and openness with which Gibbon speaks of himself.  "Few men, I believe," Lord Sheffield wrote, "have ever so fully unveiled their own character".{{sfn|Fenton|2006}}  Again, Gibbon broke new ground in making it a truly "philosophical", that is to say analytical, autobiography; as the novelist [[Anthony Burgess]] wrote, "the sense of intellectual control, of a life somehow grasped as a concept, is unmatched".{{sfn|Burgess|1966|p=521}}  It is widely held that Gibbon's ''Memoirs'', along with the ''[[Confessions (Rousseau)|Confessions]]'' of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], brought the modern autobiography into being.{{sfn|Carnochan|1987|p=4}}{{sfn|Fenton|2006}}

In recent years much has been written by critics on Gibbon's failure to reach a final recension of his autobiography.  It has been explained in various ways: as a sign of Gibbon's wrestling with difficulties of literary form; as a result of disagreements between Gibbon and Sheffield as to how far the ''Memoirs'' should follow [[Edmund Burke]]'s interpretation of the [[French Revolution]]; or in psychoanalytic terms as the reflection of an uncertainty in Gibbon's mind as to his own identity.{{sfn|Womersley|2002|pp=207–240}}

When, with the publication of Murray's edition, it became possible to judge Sheffield's role in conflating the different versions of the ''Memoirs'', some critics accorded him praise moderated by their shock at finding how large a part he had played.  The historian [[Frederic Harrison]]'s opinion was that he had performed his task with "great skill and tact, but with the most daring freedom";{{sfn|Ward|1913|p=299}} and an anonymous writer in the ''[[The Spectator|Spectator]]'' said of Sheffield that
&lt;blockquote&gt;with an ingenuity which, in spite of its perversity, cannot but be admired, he concocted out of the six [manuscripts] a patchwork narrative, which has since always passed as Gibbon's autobiography. In reality it was nothing of the kind, and should have been called not ''Gibbon's Autobiography'' but ''Selections from the Autobiographical Remains of Edward Gibbon''.{{sfn|Anon.|1987|p=210}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
20th and 21st centuries critical opinions of Sheffield's work as an editor have diverged widely.  In 1913 the ''Cambridge History of English Literature'' called it "extraordinarily skillful", and in the 1960s Anthony Burgess wrote of "Six holograph sketches, out of which Lord Sheffield stitched not a patchwork but a tasteful and well-fitting suit of clothes."{{sfn|Ward|1913|p=299}}{{sfn|Burgess|1966|p=521}}  The academic W. B. Carnochan called Sheffield's editing "brilliant though high-handed",{{sfn|Carnochan|1987|p=125}} and pointed out that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Were it not for his unremitting labors, we would not think of Gibbon as having written a great autobiography; rather, we would think of him as a historian who tried to write an autobiography but failed.{{sfn|Carnochan|1987|p=4}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The academic David Womersley has written in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' that Sheffield did the job "With equal judgement, freedom, and shrewdness", but elsewhere he has conceded that "From our standpoint…Sheffield's handling of Gibbon’s manuscript was scandalous.".{{sfn|Womersley|2004–2013}}{{sfn|Womersley|2002|p=362}}  This last judgement has been endorsed by the historian [[Glen Bowersock]], while the Gibbon scholar Jane Elizabeth Norton said that "By all the standards of scholarship, Lord Sheffield's conduct was deplorable."{{sfn|Bowersock|2009|p=51}}{{sfn|Womersley|2002|p=362}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4170">[[File:Moresque ornament, Peter Flötner.jpg|thumb|upright|Moresque ornament print by [[Peter Flotner]].]]
[[File:Wzór ornamentu - groteska.jpg|thumb|upright|Mannerist [[grotesque]] ornament drawing by the Dutch painter and architect [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]] (1527–1609), of around 1604.  The figures of the [[faun]]s at bottom, and almost the dragons at top, are moresques in the figure sense.]]  
'''Moresque''' is an obsolete alternative term to "[[Moors|Moorish]]" in English, and in the arts has some specific meanings.  By itself the word is used of stylized plant-based forms of tendrils and leaves found in [[ornament (art)|ornament]] and decoration in the [[applied arts]] in Renaissance Europe that are derived from the [[arabesque]] patterns of Islamic ornament.  Like their Islamic ancestors, they differ from the typical European [[Scroll (art)|plant scroll]] in being many-branched and spreading rather than forming a line in one direction.  The use of half-leaves with their longest side running along the stem is typical for both.

First found in 15th-century Italy, especially [[Venice]], moresques continue in the [[Mannerist]] and [[Northern Mannerist]] styles of the 16th century.  

==Figures==
Another, related, meaning was defined in 1611 by [[Randle Cotgrave]]'s ''A Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues'' as: "a rude or anticke painting, or carving, wherin the feet and tayles of beasts, &amp;c, are intermingled with, or made to resemble, a kind of wild leaves, &amp;c." &lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Moresque"&lt;/ref&gt;  The word was also used for such a figure, starting off as a human or animal, but terminating as part of a decorative scheme of foliage or geometric [[strapwork]].

In fact the origin of figures like those described by Cotgrave comes not from the Islamic world, but from the Renaissance version, influenced by the Ancient Roman [[grotesque]] decorative style, of medieval ornament, especially that found in [[illuminated manuscript]]s. Here men and beasts whose forms disappear into geometric or foliage decoration go back almost a thousand years to the interlace of [[Insular art]] seen in the [[Book of Kells]] and other manuscripts.  These themselves derive from the [[Animal style]] of [[barbarian]] Europe.  However the term "moresque" is not used of these medieval versions.

==Book covers==
Tooled and decorated fine [[bookbinding]]s, and printer's ornaments marking the end of a chapter etc, were one of the first places where the style appeared, in 15th century Italy.  Moresque decoration remained a common element in decorated book bindings throughout the 16th century, and across Europe, often combined with [[strapwork]] or bandwork.

==Other meanings==
*"Moresque dance" is a fancy term for the English [[Morris dance]] (OED, quoting Chambers' [[Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]], 1727).  See also the Renaissance [[Moresca]] dances of France and Italy, called "moresques" in French.
*[[Hispano-Moresque ware]] is a type of medieval and Renaissance fine [[pottery]] produced in Spain by both Muslims and Christians.
*The term "Hispano-Moresque" is also used to describe figured [[silk]] [[textile]]s with geometric patterns woven in [[Al-Andalus|medieval Andalusia]].&lt;ref&gt;Monnas, Lisa. ''Merchants, Princes and Painters: Silk Fabrics in Italian and Northern Paintings 1300–1550''. London and New Haven, Yale University Press, 2008, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 18th century French, moresques were "large loose comfortable pantaloons of thin printed [[Calico (textile)|calico]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6zuMSUGG4m8C&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=%22Moresques%22#PPA168,M1 Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Editorial practice ==
Levinson focuses on the opportunities presented by digital and online media for reaching new audiences and expanding the impact of scholarly work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levinson|first=Nancy|date=2013-10-01|title=Print and Pixel|url=https://placesjournal.org/article/print-and-pixel/|journal=Places Journal|language=en-US|issue=2013|doi=10.22269/131001|issn=2164-7798}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Under Levinson’s editorship, ''Places'' moved from print to online and built a substantial and wide-ranging interdisciplinary readership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://placesjournal.org/news/from-the-editor-2009/|title=From the Editor|work=Places Journal|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://landscapearchitecturemagazine.org/2014/10/22/places-journal-has-a-new-place/|title=PLACES JOURNAL HAS A NEW PLACE|date=2014-10-22|work=Landscape Architecture Magazine|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levinson has expanded the mandate of the journal under the tagline “Public scholarship on architecture, landscape, and urbanism”''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://placesjournal.org/|title=Places Journal|work=Places Journal|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her editorial direction is described as “harnessing the moral and investigative power of public scholarship to promote equitable cities and sustainable landscapes.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Levinson has led funding campaigns to support the research and publication on topics that might not otherwise be addressed. This has resulted in funding from the [[Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts|Graham Foundation]] for three initiatives – History of the Present: Cities in Transition,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Future Archive&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.grahamfoundation.org/grantees/5232-future-archive|title=Graham Foundation &gt; Grantees &gt; Places Journal|website=www.grahamfoundation.org|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Writers’ Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.grahamfoundation.org/grantees/5526-places-journal-writers-fund|title=Graham Foundation &gt; Grantees &gt; Places Journal|website=www.grahamfoundation.org|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Inequality Chronicles, a series investigating racial, social and economic inequality in American cities, was funded by [[The Kresge Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://placesjournal.org/series/the-inequality-chronicles/|title=The Inequality Chronicles: A Series on Places Journal|work=Places Journal|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levinson has also used ''Places'' as a foundation on which to build a range of related enterprises that seek to expand participation, readership and the dissemination of scholarship on the built environment. Initiatives include [https://press.princeton.edu/catalogs/series/title/places-books.html Places Books], a collaboration between Places and [[Princeton Architectural Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://press.princeton.edu/catalogs/series/title/places-books.html|title=Browse Princeton Catalog in Places Books {{!}} Princeton University Press|website=press.princeton.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first in the series is ''Where are the Women Architects?'' by [[Despina Stratigakos]], which has been well received across academia and the architectural profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/935925102|title=Where are the women architects?|last=Despina,|first=Stratigakos,|isbn=9781400880294|location=Princeton|oclc=935925102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/books/review-where-are-the-women-architects-despina-stratigakos-princeton-university-press|title=Where are the Women Architects?, by Despina Stratigakos|last=Samuel|first=Flora|authorlink=Flora Samuel|date=June 2, 2016|website=Times Higher Education|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archiparlour.org/where-are-the-women-architects/|title=Where are the Women Architects|last=Thompson|first=Kerstin|authorlink=Kerstin Thompson|date=October 10, 2016|website=Parlour: women, equity, architecture|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://spacing.ca/national/2017/01/24/book-review-where-are-the-women-architects/|title=Book Review: Where Are the Women Architects? - Spacing National|date=2017-01-24|work=Spacing National|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [https://placesjournal.org/reading-lists/ Places Reading List] is a collaborative tool that allows readers to share knowledge and generate content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://placesjournal.org/news/places-journal-launches-new-tool-for-interdisciplinary-public-scholarship/|title=Places Journal launches new tool for interdisciplinary public scholarship|work=Places Journal|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archdaily.com/609192/places-journal-launches-new-tool-for-sharing-articles-about-architecture-landscape-and-urbanism|title=Places Journal Launches New Tool for Sharing Articles about Architecture, Landscape, and Urbanism|date=2015-03-13|work=ArchDaily|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nja Mahdaoui''', (born in 1937) is a Tunisian artist known for his use of calligraphy as a graphic art form. He has often been described as a ‘choreographer of letters.'&lt;ref name=molka&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mahdaoui|first1=Molka|title=Nja Mahdaoui|url=http://www.nja-mahdaoui.com/|website=Nja Mahdaoui|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Nja Mahdaoui was born in [[Tunis]], [[Tunisia]] in 1937.&lt;ref name=spring&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spring|first1=Christopher|title=Angaza Africa: African Art Now|date=28 November 2008|publisher=Laurence King|location=London|pages=178–181|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He initially studied painting and art history at [[Carthage National Museum]],&lt;ref name=vernoit&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vernoit|first1=S.J.|title=Mahdaoui, Nja|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T053180|website=Grove Art Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
but was later, encouraged by the Director of the Italian Cultural Centre in Tunis, studied painting and philosophy at the Santa Andrea Academy in Rome (1966-68).&lt;ref name=spring /&gt; 
He later moved to Paris to go to Cité Internationale des Arts, where he attended courses at the [[École du Louvre]].&lt;ref name=vernoit /&gt;
Mahdaoui returned to Tunisia in 1977 and currently lives and works there.&lt;ref name=meem&gt;{{cite web|title=Artists Resource|url=http://www.meemartgallery.com/art_exhibiting.php?id=2|website=Meem Gallery|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Mahdaoui began his career as an abstract painter in the 1960s, then continued by experimenting with Arabic calligraphy.&lt;ref name=twair&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Twair|first1=Pat McDonnell|title=World-Class Tunisian Artists Exhibited At Ne Sahara Gallery In L.A. Suburb|journal=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs|date=2011|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mahdaoui has tried various traditional and experimental media. He produced his first paintings on parchment in 1972, he became interested in weaving and carpet production in 1979 and he began to paint on animal skins and on the human body in 1980.&lt;ref name=vernoit /&gt;
Today he is known as the "inventor of abstract calligraphy," since his designs resemble Arabic letters, but have no literal meaning. When asked about his style Mahdaoui said, "I use fragmented and distorted letters to reject valuing each character." &lt;ref name= twair /&gt;
He started using his own personal '[[calligram]]s' on various mediums such as: canvas, papyrus, sculpture, aluminum, brass, drum, textile, embroidery, tapestry, ceramic, wood, jewelry, stained steel glass, planes, etc.&lt;ref name=molka /&gt; On account of his use of calligraphy in art, he is said to be part of the Hurufiyah art movement.&lt;ref&gt;Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahdaoui is of a generation of Arab artists who studied abroad but sought inspiration from their traditional roots.&lt;ref name=meem /&gt; Mahdaoui focused on the poetic quality of Arabic text, and invented a graphic style involving calligraphic works.&lt;ref name=richards&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richards|first1=Paul|title=Africa|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T000675pg26|website=Grover Art Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose Issa, a curator, has described his work saying, "Mahdaoui is careful not to emphasize the meaning of words but stresses instead the visual effect of compositions. His 'calligrams evoke infinite pleasures in rhythms, fast or slow, born from tension of the wrist, somewhat in the manner of a melodic flow, rising and fading away".&lt;ref name=geers&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geers|first1=Kendell|last2=Ross|first2=Doran H. Ross|title=africa95: Many Stories about the Art of a Continent|journal=African Arts|date=Summer 1996|volume=29|issue=3|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, he was also selected by [[Gulf Air]] to design the external decoration of its fleet for the airline's fiftieth anniversary.&lt;ref name= meem /&gt; He has also created monumental stained-glass windows for public buildings in the United Arab Emirates.&lt;ref name= twair /&gt; 
Mahdaoui followed his love of music, costume, and performance by using different media to apply his 'calligrams' to a wide range of objects such as large denim hangings, musicians' costumes, and a bass drum.&lt;ref name=spring2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spring|first1=Christopher|last2=Barley|first2=Nigel|last3=Hudson|first3=Julie|title=The Sainsbury African Galleries at the British Museum|journal=African Arts|date=Autumn 2001|volume=34|issue=3|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The bass drum was created in 1998 with wood and given calligraphic embellishments by Mahdaoui.&lt;ref name=spring2 /&gt; When asked about this piece Mahdaoui said,"This drum, transformed into a silent sculpture, has temporarily ceased to be an instrument; it simply exists. Its cultural function - as a catalyst to the senses articulated through formal and improvised melody - has been interrupted. More importantly, it has renounced its particular voice as part of a collective artistic performance. Instead, with its multiplicity of resonances, it has become a dynamic symbol of cultural pluralism, a kind of 'total art' to which people throughout the world can respond in a myriad different ways."&lt;ref name=spring /&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Mahdaoui has participated in both solo and group exhibitions worldwide. His work can be found in private and public international collections, including:

'''Online book rental''' refers to a service wherein users rent books via the internet. Users browse books online and have their choices home-delivered, rather than physically visiting a [[library]] to borrow a book. This [[e-commerce]] model is very similar to the popular [[video rental]] service provided by the California-based [[Netflix]]. Online book rental is gaining popularity in India, with a number of websites offering free doorstep delivery for a small monthly fee. The popularity of such websites can be attributed to increasing internet usage in the country; India is expected to have the third-largest number of internet users in the world by 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/biz/india-business/India-to-have-3rd-largest-number-of-Internet-users-by-2013/articleshow/4821630.cms India to have 3rd largest number of Internet users by 2013 – The Times of India]. Timesofindia.indiatimes.com (2009-07-26). Retrieved on 2012-08-08.&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics for the publishing industry are also promising. India is the world's third-largest market for English books,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/22/books-india-china Publishers look to China and India to help them weather recession | Books].

== {{anchor|The rental system}}Rental system ==

Online book-rental services save time by delivering books to a member's home or office. In addition to convenience, the service also offers an ease-of-use benefit; membership on most websites involves a simple [[registration form]] and payment through [[bank transfer]] or [[Collect on delivery|cash on delivery]]. This is important in a market that does not yet trust internet-based monetary transactions. Once membership is paid the user logs in to browse books, and clicks the "rent" button to receive the chosen books at home. The books are collected when the user logs in to indicate that he or she has finished reading.&lt;!-- How are the books collected? --&gt; Another advantage of online rental services is that most do not have any due dates or late fees; borrowers may keep books for as long as they wish, provided they pay the regular [[subscription]].
This era is changing, edits being made with education book selling. Engineering books are often taken on rent for a semester or 2 and returned after use. With the online space roaring, newer start ups have emerged in online book renting. In engineering book stores, you order books and pay Cash on Delivery, after usage you collect back up to 70% of the invoice back. 

== Presence ==

Online libraries and rental companies have come  with a national presence and are trying to reach other smaller cities by using courier companies and the postal service to deliver books. These new ventures have become popular with the trend towards internet-based [[marketing]]; almost all have their own [[blog]]s and [[Facebook]] pages. Ventures like Pustakkosh&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pustakkosh.com|title=Pustak Kosh - India's Leading TextBook and Student Need Rental Company|last=https://www.pustakkosh.com|access-date=2018-08-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Justbooks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thetechpanda.com/2013/06/10/justbooks-clc-the-economical-and-flexible-library-service-to-rent-and-read-books/|title=JustBooks CLC - Library Service to Rent and Read Books|website=thetechpanda.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; are major national level players in Indian online book rental scenario.

== {{anchor|E-books vs physical books}}Electronic versus print books ==

There is speculation as to the survival of these ventures, as more people use [[Amazon Kindle]] and read books online. However, most book-lovers prefer a physical book, and this is the premise on which these new ventures are based. Their success remains to be seen; however, they offer a ray of hope for young professionals in the country who currently lack access to books. Apart from the metropolitan areas, most cities and towns in India do not have good, well-stocked [[public libraries]]. For the residents of these cities, such ventures may offer an economical way to bridge the gap.

'''Ostankino Palace''' is a former summer residence and private [[opera]] theatre of [[Nikolai Sheremetev|Sheremetev family]], originally situated several kilometres to the north from [[Moscow]] but now a part of the [[North-Eastern Administrative Okrug]] of [[Moscow]]. Extant historical Ostankino includes the main wooden palace, built in 1792-1798 around a theater hall, with adjacent Egyptian and Italian pavilions, a 17th-century Trinity church, and fragments of the old Ostankino park with a replica of ''Milovzor'' [[folly]].
&lt;!--Ostankino Palace is third-largest wooden building in the world&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newstube.ru/media/v-stolice-ostaetsya-vse-men%27she-derevyannyx-zdanij&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Tōdai-ji]] in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], [[Japan]] and [[Old Government Buildings, Wellington|Old Government Buildings]] in [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]].--&gt;

== History ==

=== 16th century to 1787 ===

First documental evidence of Ostankino - then known as Ostashkovo - emerged in the middle of 16th century, when Tsar [[Ivan IV of Russia]] granted these lands to the hold of Alexey Satin, relative of statesman Alexey Adashev. Satin, however, was executed by Ivan in 1560, and the lands passed to someone Horn, a German [[mercenary]], and in 1585 - to notable [[diak]] (statesman) Vasily Schelkalov. Under Schelkalov, the unpopulated lands of Ostashkovo developed into a relatively prosperous manor estate with ponds and cedar park. This manor was destroyed by plunder and fire in the [[Time of Troubles]].

End of hostilities and ascension of the [[House of Romanov]] brought the new owners - princes [[Tcherkassky]]. They replanted the parks and established a spacious hunting reserve, expanding east to Alekseyevskoye village. A 1677 marriage between Tcherkassky and Odoyevsky families brought in a valuable asset - architect Pavel Potekhin, a slave of Odoyevsky family, who designed and built extant Trinity church (1678–1683, 1691–1692).

In the first half of 18th century Ostankino was gradually converted from a permanent country manor to a temporary retreat with hunt, house theater and other entertainment of the period; empress [[Elizabeth of Russia]] herself paid a visit to Ostankino in 1742. Next year, through a marriage between princess Varvara, the sole heir of Tcherkassky fortunes, and Peter Sheremetev, son of [[Boris Sheremetev|field marshal Sheremetev]], Ostankino passed to the Sheremetevs and remained their property until 1917.

Throughout the 18th century Sheremetevs lived primarily in [[Kuskovo]], and Ostankino retained its temporary entertainment atmosphere.

=== Construction of the palace ===

In 1787 [[Nikolai Sheremetev]] inherited Ostankino upon the death of his father. Well-educated and extremely wealthy, Nikolai Sheremetev was a patron of theater; his extravagant shows earned him nickname ''[[Croesus]] Junior''. In the three following years Sheremetev established house theaters in [[Kuskovo]], [[Kitai-gorod]] and Markovo. In 1790 he held an architectural contest for a ''Palace of Arts'' in Moscow, but eventually preferred to build it in the country, far from city life. Building a new large theater in Kuskovo would have ruined an already completed ensemble, so in the same 1790 Sheremetev finally chose Ostankino.

[[Image:View from the windows of the Ostankino Palace in the 18th century.jpg|thumb|View south from the windows of the Ostankino Palace in the early 18th century]]
Sheremetev initially hired someone Casier ({{lang-ru|Казье}}), a self-proclaimed architect employed by [[Galitzine|Golitsyn]] family. This project did not materialize; by 1792, Sheremetev built only a two-story wooden theater hall, apparently discarding Casier's plans. Then, as Sheremetev recruited services of influential contemporary architects (most notably [[Francesco Camporesi]], see [[Ostankino Palace#Attribution dispute|Attribution dispute]] section), work accelerated and the wooden palace was structurally in its present shape, including pavilion wings, by the end of 1793. Contemporary witnesses reported that Sheremetev was so confident in perfection of his palace that he set up an unprecedented veil of secrecy around construction site: the manor was closed to any visitors, covered with shrouds, architects worked in parallel unaware of each other's progress.&lt;ref name=P229&gt;Памятники архитектуры Москвы. Окрестности старой Москвы (северо-западная и северная части города). — М.: Искусство — XXI век, 2004. {{ISBN|5-98051-011-7}}, p.229-230&lt;/ref&gt;

Interior works took another six years. In 1793 Sheremetev ordered redesign of theater so that the main hall and stage could be transformed at will to a single ballroom. In 1794 he redecorated already finished Italian pavilion and expanded the galleries between pavilions and the palace. Each round of decoration required stripping of earlier finishes. In the same 1794 Sheremetev realized that the palace fails to accommodate all the guests and ordered another round of expansion and remodelling. [[Giacomo Quarenghi]] and [[Pyotr Argunov]] presented their ambitious expansion drafts, however, actual expansion carried out by (most likely) [[Ivan Starov]] was quite modest and did not change palace exterior - at least, its southern facade. Subsequent expansion concentrated on the sprawling side wings, most notably the Italian [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] (1796) that would become a study of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] sixty years later.

Major work on the palace was completed by the end of 1798, while lesser decoration and landscaping projects continued until the end of Sheremetev's life. The palace remains the largest extant wooden structure in Moscow ([[brick]] was used locally for fireproofing the ovens).

=== Park ===

In 1761 Sheremetevs hired a garden manager, Johann Manstadt, who supervised expansion of the park and its conversion to a commercial enterprise.&lt;ref name=H165&gt;Peter Hayden. Russian Parks and Gardens. 2005, {{ISBN|0-7112-2430-7}}, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Under Manstadt, Ostankino garden became an important supply of exotic plants for wealthy Moscow families; customers included [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]] and [[Grigori Alexandrovich Potemkin|Grigory Potyomkin]]. The park sprawled over territories of present-day [[All-Russia Exhibition Centre]], [[Moscow Botanical Garden of Academy of Sciences|Botanical Garden]], [[Ostankino Tower|Ostankino Television buildings]] and residential blocks around it. [[File:Ostankino19.JPG|thumb|The Ostankino Ballroom Theatre is one of the most perfectly preserved 18th-century theaters in the world. It still operates some of the original machinery.]]

Nikolai Sheremetev initially assigned landscaping to his serf architect, Mironov, but soon deemed Mironov's plan inappropriate. The job passed to Pyotr Argunov, with consultancy by [[Francis Reid (gardener)|Francis Reid]], manager of [[Tsaritsyno Park]] project. Reid and his associate, Nikolai Kuverin, worked in Ostankino in 1791-1794. A permanent garden manager, Robert Manners, was hired in 1796 and stayed in Ostankino for thirty years. Reid's input apparently concentrated on the immediate vicinity of the palace; regular [[English garden]] north from the palace was planted in 1797 by Manners.&lt;ref name="H165"/&gt;

=== Two seasons of the theater ===

The theater opened in summer of 1795, amazing the guests with unprecedented stage effects. [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]], who ascended to the throne in November 1796, summoned Nikolai Sheremetev to Saint-Petersburg. As one of the highest statesmen of the reign, Sheremetev now lived mostly in Saint-Petersburg. The splendid theater operated publicly for just one season in spring 1797 - with one show for emperor Paul and one for [[Stanisław August Poniatowski|Stanisław Poniatowski]], former king of [[Partitions of Poland|partitioned Poland]]. In 1800 Sheremetev reduced the artistic company - barely sufficient for the private entertainment.

1802 death of Sheremetev's wife, former actress [[Zhemchugova|Praskovya Kovaleva-Zhemchugova]], spelled the end of the theater. Nikolai Sheremetev disbanded his theater company and abstained from public entertainment till the end of his life (1809). There were accounts of an 1801 show for [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]],&lt;ref&gt;Reproduced as true accounts, for example, at the [http://www.museum.ru/Ostankino/2.htm official site of Ostankino theater]&lt;/ref&gt; however, modern studied deem these reports as incorrect - the show was planned but did not materialize.&lt;ref name=P230&gt;Памятники архитектуры Москвы. Окрестности старой Москвы (северо-западная и северная части города). — М.: Искусство — XXI век, 2004. {{ISBN|5-98051-011-7}}, p.230&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 19th to 21st centuries ===

[[File:Church in Ostankino 2.jpg|thumb|left|The manorial church was consecrated in 1683]]
Sheremetev's heirs barely maintained the palace; in the 1830s they demolished the old living quarters dating back to the 17th century, and demolished some of the free-standing service buildings. The palace was revived for a short time in 1856, when Alexander II chose Ostankino as his temporary residence during his [[coronation]]. Ground floor rooms were converted to living quarters and redecorated, probably by [[Mikhail Bykovsky]].

Ostankino Park fell in neglect in the 1830s. In the second part of the 19th century parts of the park were sold to [[dacha]] developers and leased to farmers, while the greenhouses concentrated on commercial flower growing.&lt;ref name=H166&gt;Peter Hayden. Russian Parks and Gardens. 2005, {{ISBN|0-7112-2430-7}}, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 19th century Sheremetev Park became a popular picnic destination; Sheremetevs built a temporary summer stage and ballroom. The palace, which went through another round of repairs and alterations in the 1870s, was opened for public viewing.

In the Soviet period the nationalized palace operated as a museum of serf art. In 1935 the eastern part of former Ostankino park grounds were allotted to the emerging [[All-Russia Exhibition Centre|Agricultural Exhibition]] and completely remodelled by 1939. In the same 1939 a part of regular English garden, immediately north from the palace, was replanted; Ostankino park proper shrunk to just one square kilometer as the lands further north became the State Botanical Garden.

Throughout the Soviet period the main theater hall was set up a single ballroom space. Partitions separating stage, orchestra pit and spectator areas were re-introduced during the controversial repairs of the 2000s, so the theater can once again be used in its original function.

== Attribution dispute ==

Nikolai Sheremetev managed construction himself, hiring architects at will; in addition to original architectural work, he reused drafts of [[Saint-Petersburg]] architects. Contemporary academic studies agree on the fact that, while certain parts and details of the palace can be attributed to specific architects (with different degree of probability), the palace as a whole - even its basic layout - has no single author apart from Sheremetev himself.&lt;ref name="P229"/&gt;

Of all architects involved in the project, [[Ivan Starov]]'s input is least controversial; Starov's trademark [[palladian window]]s without [[Impost (architecture)|impost]] columns were unique for the period, his work for Sheremetev in Saint-Petersburg and Moscow was thoroughly documented and studied. Modern studies also attribute specific palace interiors to [[Vincenzo Brenna]]. Shape of southern façade is usually credited to [[Francesco Camporesi]].

[[Pyotr Argunov]]'s role as a long-time construction manager is undisputed, but his actual creative input remains unresolved. [[Karl Blank]], who died in 1793, consulted Sheremetev in the beginning of the project; later stages of construction (1794–1798) were influenced by [[Giacomo Quarenghi]]. [[Elizvoy Nazarov]] consulted Sheremetev throughout the project.

[[Igor Grabar]] attributed design of the palace to [[Vasily Bazhenov]]; this viewpoint is discarded by modern studies as unsubstantiated.&lt;ref name="P230"/&gt;

==Description and history==
''Procession'' (September 1982) is an outdoor sculpture by Dallas Cole and Scott Wylie, the latter of whom designed the bricks and tiles, installed outside the west entrance of the Hilton Hotel's Conference Center. Additional contributions were made by Jill Perry and Joanne Haines.&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{cite web|title=Procession, (sculpture).|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!328735~!0#focus|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|accessdate=November 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eugene Weekly : Calendar : 07.01.04|url=http://www.eugeneweekly.com/2004/07/01/calendar|accessdate=November 9, 2015|work=[[Eugene Weekly]]|date=February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts five Egyptian figures, including two dancers, two water bearers, and one person surrounded by five birds and a turtle; the intricate background includes grapes and leaves, with wavy tiles possibly representing the flow of water. The mural measures {{Convert|10|ft|m}}, {{Convert|4|in|cm}} x {{Convert|30|ft|m}}, {{Convert|6|in|cm}}. One plaque set into the work reads, {{Small|SEPTEMBER, 1982 / DALLAS COLE / SCOTT WYLIE / JILL PERRY / JOANNE HAINES}}.

The sculpture was surveyed and deemed "treatment needed" by the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s "[[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]]" program in October 1993. It was administered by the Cultural Services Division of the City of Eugene's Recreation and Cultural Services Department at that time.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;

[[File:Cover of 'Revue et Gazette musicale de Paris' 1835 vol2 n46 - Internet Archive.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Revue et Gazette Musicale de Paris'' (15 November 1835)]]

The '''''{{Lang|fr|Revue musicale}}''''' was a weekly musical review founded in 1827 by the Belgian [[musicologist]], teacher and composer [[François-Joseph Fétis]], then working as professor of [[counterpoint]] and [[fugue]] at the [[Conservatoire de Paris]]. It was the first French-language journal dedicated entirely to classical music. In November 1835 it merged with [[Maurice Schlesinger]]'s '''''Gazette musicale de Paris''''' (first published in January 1834) to form '''''Revue et gazette musicale de Paris''''', first published on 1 November 1835. It ceased publication in 1880.

==History==
By 1830 the '''''Revue musicale''''', written and published by Fétis, was on sale at [[Maurice Schlesinger]]'s music seller's premises.&lt;ref name="RF_13-14"&gt;Vol 7 (Tome VIII, IV&lt;sup&gt;me&lt;/sup&gt; année) (1830) sold by Fétis, Alexandre Mesnier &amp; Schlesinger. See review of Vol. 7 in [https://books.google.com/books?id=WtsnAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA281 ''Revue française'', Issues 13-14, p. 281-3].&lt;/ref&gt; Schlesinger (whose father founded the ''Berliner allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'') was a German music editor who had moved to Paris in 1821. Schlesinger published editions of classical and modern music under his own name at a reasonable price, most notably works by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel|Hummel]] and [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]. He also published ''[[Robert le diable]]''&lt;ref&gt;Full score of Schlesinger's edition of [http://imslp.org/wiki/Robert_le_diable_%28Meyerbeer,_Giacomo%29 Robert le diable] at IMSLP.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Les Huguenots]]'' by [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]], as well as ''[[La Juive]]'' by [[Fromental Halévy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Fr icon}} ''{{Lang|fr|Larousse encyclopédique}}'' vol. 9, p.&amp;nbsp;9405.&lt;/ref&gt; Schlesinger founded his own rival publication, the '''''Gazette Musicale de Paris''''', which first appeared on 5 January 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{Fr icon}} {{cite book |title=Gazette Musicale de Paris |volume=I&lt;sup&gt;re&lt;/sup&gt; année, No. 1 |date=5 January 1834 |others= [[Maurice Schlesinger|Schlesinger, Maurice]] (ed.) |url=https://archive.org/stream/gazettemusicaled18341pari#page/n5/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Fr icon}} ''{{Lang|fr|Dictionnaire de la musique}}'' Larousse, p.&amp;nbsp;286 {{ISBN|978-2-03-505545-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another music journal, ''[[Le Ménestrel]]'', had first appeared the previous month on 1 December 1833.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref={{harvid|Le Ménestrel|1883-4|}} |title=Le Ménestrel |date=1 December 1833 |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5619191p/f8 |issue=Année 1, No. 0 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |authorlink=Théophile Gautier |last=Gautier |first=Théophile |year=1995 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QHd3nF0cAbEC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=Le+M%C3%A9nestrel+%22L'Henry%22&amp;hl=en#v=snippet&amp;q=L'Henry&amp;f=false |title=Correspondance générale 1865–1867 |editor1-first= Claudine |editor1-last=Lacoste-Veysseyre |publisher=Librairie Droz |isbn=2-600-00075-5 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until ''La Revue et Gazette'' ceased publication in 1880, ''Le Ménestrel'' was to be its main rival in terms of influence and breadth of coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Ellis |first= Katharine |year=2007 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7LC3WSReyLQC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=%22Le+M%C3%A9nestrel%22+Heugel&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Le%20M%C3%A9nestrel%22%20Heugel |title=Music Criticism in Nineteenth-Century France |page=2 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-03589-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1835, Schlesinger bought the ''Revue musicale'' from Fétis and merged the two journals into the '''''Revue et gazette musicale de Paris'''''. He widened the subject matter of the ''{{Lang|fr|Gazette musicale}}'' from music itself to also include literature about music – in 1837 he commissioned from [[Honoré de Balzac]] for the ''Gazette'' the [[novella]] ''[[Gambara (short story)|Gambara]]'' (dealing with the new style of [[grand opera]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Fr icon}} René Guise, ''La Pléiade'', p.&amp;nbsp;1517. Pierre Brunel, "{{Lang|fr|Histoire du texte}}", ''Folio Classique'', 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;318–9 comprising ''Gambara'', ''[[Sarrasine]]'', ''[[Massimilla Doni]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Revue musicale'' returned for six months in 1839 as the '''''Revue musicale, journal des artistes, des amateurs et des théatres''''' while the journal was a bi-weekly publication. The list of contributors to the ''Revue et gazette musicale'' in 1840 included: [[François Benoist]], [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Castil-Blaze]], [[Antoine Elwart]], [[Stephen Heller]], [[Jules Janin]], [[Jean-Georges Kastner]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Édouard Monnais]] (director of the [[Paris Opera]] from 1839 to 1847), [[Joseph d'Ortigue]], [[Theodor Panofka]], [[Ludwig Rellstab]], [[Georges Sand]], [[Robert Schumann]], and one [[Richard Wagner]].

'''Sigraf''' (also '''Sighraf''', '''Sighrafr''', fl. c.1175&amp;ndash;1210) was a [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] stone sculptor, working on [[Gotland]]. He was mainly active as a sculptor of [[baptismal font]]s, but also of [[Reliquary|reliquaries]], carved [[Column|pillar]]s and [[relief]]s. He was the most productive of several early medieval stone sculptors making baptismal fonts on Gotland.&lt;ref name="signum"&gt;{{cite book |last= Svanberg|first= Jan|authorlink= |language=Swedish|title= Signums svenska konsthistoria. Den romanska konsten.|url= |year= 1995|publisher= Signum förlag|location= Lund|isbn= 91-87896-23-0|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Unusually, this early medieval master stone sculptor is known by name since he has signed one of the fonts attributed to him (in [[Aa Church]], on [[Bornholm]] island in [[Denmark]]) with [[runes]], ''Sighraf Master''. He was active on Gotland island, working in local [[sandstone]] and making inscriptions in [[Old Gutnish]]. The works of his atelier were exported to several places around the [[Baltic Sea]], and he seems to have been the first sculptor of Romanesque fonts on Gotland to focus mainly on export, possibly because his home market was beginning to become satisfied. He was trained locally and his oeuvre displays similarities with earlier stone sculptors from Gotland, e.g. [[Semi-Byzantios]] and [[Majestatis]].&lt;ref name="signum"/&gt; His style is classical Romanesque with [[Viking Age art|Norse]] influences.&lt;ref name="amanda"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lexikonettamanda.se/show.php?aid=19468|title= Konstnärslexikonett Amanda|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= kultur1|accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sigraf has been identified as the creator of 23 baptismal fonts,&lt;ref name="signum"/&gt; including those in [[Silte church|Silte]], [[Bro church, Gotland|Bro]], [[Eke Church|Eke]], [[Grötlingbo church|Grötlingbo]], [[Lau Church|Lau]] churches, all on Gotland, as well as [[Hannas church|Hannas]] and [[Hammenhög]] churches, [[Scania]]; [[Brunflo]] church, [[Jämtland]]; [[Mo church, Sweden|Mo]] church, [[Hälsingland]]; [[Skogs-Tibble church|Skogs-Tibble]] and [[Knivsta]] churches, [[Uppland]]; [[Locknevi church|Locknevi]]&lt;ref name="Swartling"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://samla.raa.se/xmlui/bitstream/handle/raa/2147/1971_275.pdf?sequence=1|title= En Sighraf-funt i Locknevi kyrka|last1= Swartling|first1= Ingrid|last2= |first2= |date= |website= |language=Swedish|publisher= Journal of Swedish Antiquarian Research|accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="svuppb"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://svenskuppslagsbok.se/tag/sighraf/|title= Locknevi, socken|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= Svensk uppslagsbok (1955)|accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; church, [[Småland]]; [[Tingstad church|Tingstad]] church, [[Östergötland]]; [[Mölln, Schleswig-Holstein]]; [[St. Bendt's Church, Ringsted]] and possibly others.&lt;ref name="signum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="amanda"/&gt;

'''''Smile''''' (stylized as '''''SMiLE''''') is an [[unfinished creative work|unfinished album]] by American [[rock music|rock]] band [[the Beach Boys]] that was projected to follow their 11th studio album, ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' (1966). After bandleader and principal songwriter [[Brian Wilson]] abandoned large portions of music recorded over a ten-month period with outside lyricist [[Van Dyke Parks]], the band substituted its release with ''[[Smiley Smile]]'' (1967), an album containing stripped-down remakes of some ''Smile'' material. Over the next four decades, few of the original ''Smile'' tracks were officially released, and the project came to be regarded as the most "legendary" unreleased album in the history of [[popular music]].{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=72}}{{sfn|Jones|2008|p=63}}

Wilson touted ''Smile'' as a "teenage [[symphony]] to God". It was to be a twelve-track [[concept album]] assembled from short, interchangeable musical fragments—the same novel production method used for the group's biggest-selling hit yet, "[[Good Vibrations]]". Its contents ranged from musical and [[spoken word]] to [[sound effect]]s and [[role playing]], featuring innovative sounds and vocal arrangements, references to early [[Americana]] and [[Romantic poetry]], [[comedy sketch]]es, [[found object (music)|found object]] explorations,  and influences drawn from [[classical music|classical]], [[folk music|folk]], [[doo-wop]], [[traditional pop|pre-rock and roll pop]], [[spirituality]], and the nascent [[psychedelic movement]]. The [[lead single]] would have been "[[Heroes and Villains]]", a [[Western (genre)|Western]] musical comedy, or "[[Vega-Tables]]", a satire of [[physical fitness]].

[[Collapse of Smile|Numerous issues prevented the album's completion and release]]. Most of the backing tracks were produced between August and December 1966, but few vocals were ever recorded, and the album's structure was never finalized. A deadline set for January 1967 was missed, and Parks soon distanced himself from the project. In June, the Beach Boys reconvened at [[Brian Wilson's home studio|Brian's makeshift home studio]] to record ''Smiley Smile''. Afterward, there were many attempts to finish the original ''Smile'' tracks, most of which were derailed by Wilson, who became [[psychological trauma|psychologically traumatized]] by the album's difficult sessions. In the 1980s, [[The Beach Boys bootleg recordings|bootlegged tracks]] began circulating widely among [[Record collecting|record collectors]] and other music circles. The potential of what ''Smile'' could have been inspired many musicians, particularly those in [[indie rock]], [[post-punk]], and [[chamber pop]] scenes, and in the absence of an official album, fans were moved to assemble their own various interpretations of ''Smile'' using bootlegs and tracks released to that point.

As a solo artist, Wilson reinterpreted the project for concert performances in 2004, and then followed up with the studio album ''[[Brian Wilson Presents Smile]]''. Although he had ostensibly completed the work, Wilson stated that his 2004 arrangement differed substantially from how he had conceptualized the LP in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="EC" /&gt; On October 31, 2011, ''[[The Smile Sessions]]'' was released containing an approximation of what the Beach Boys' completed ''Smile'' might have sounded like based on the structure of ''Brian Wilson Presents Smile''. It received universal acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Smile Sessions – The Beach Boys|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/the-smile-sessions|accessdate=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the compilation was ranked number 381 in ''[[Rolling Stone]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s list of "[[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]".&lt;ref name="RS500list"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5938174/the_rs_500_greatest_albums_of_all_time  | title = The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time | publisher = Rolling Stone | date=November 18, 2003 | accessdate = June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, it won the [[Best Historical Album]] award at the [[2013 Grammy Awards|55th Grammy Awards]].&lt;ref name="eonline"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://au.eonline.com/news/386489/2013-grammy-awards-winners-the-complete-list|title=2013 Grammy Awards Winners: The Complete List|date=February 10, 2013|accessdate=April 12, 2013|author=Alyssa Toomey and Rosemary Brennan|work=[[E!]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Van Dyke Parks 1967.png|thumb|right|[[Van Dyke Parks]] circa 1967. Besides providing the majority of ''Smile'''s lyrics and thematic direction,&lt;ref name="NYbooks" /&gt;&lt;ref name=paste2004/&gt; he also participated in sessions as an instrumentalist.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=129}}]]

The Beach Boys' album ''[[Pet Sounds]]'', issued on May 16, 1966, was massively influential upon its release, containing lush and sophisticated orchestral arrangements that raised the band's prestige as rock innovators.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=72}} [[Brian Wilson]] had already begun planning a follow-up single, "[[Good Vibrations]]". During the recording sessions for ''Pet Sounds'', he started changing [[Musicianship of Brian Wilson#Process|his writing process]]. Rather than going to the studio with a completed song, he would record a track containing a series of chord changes he liked, take an [[acetate disc]] home, and then compose the song's melody and write its lyrics.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=42}} He explained, "I had a lot of unfinished ideas, fragments of music I called 'feels.' Each feel represented a mood or an emotion I'd felt, and I planned to fit them together like a mosaic."{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=42}} Throughout the mid 1960s, he was in the process of expanding his social circle to include a mix of worldly-minded friends, musicians, mystics, and business advisers from the developing Los Angeles "hip" scene. He also took an increasing interest in recreational drugs (particularly [[marijuana (drug)|marijuana]], [[LSD]], and [[Desbutal]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sanchez|2014|p=92|loc=wordly-minded mix}}; {{harvnb|Gaines|1986|pp=155, 163|loc=fascination with hip}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid 1965, multi-instrumentalist [[Van Dyke Parks]] was introduced to Wilson by mutual friends [[David Crosby]] and [[Terry Melcher]].{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p = 129}} About a year later, Wilson asked Parks to collaborate as lyricist for the Beach Boys' upcoming album project, then titled ''Dumb Angel'', to which Parks agreed.{{sfn|Henderson|2010|pp=38, 40–41}}

Wilson prepared for the writing and recording of ''Smile'' by purchasing about two thousand dollars' worth of [[marijuana]] and [[hashish]].&lt;ref name="Nolan1971"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nolan|first=Tom|title=The Beach Boys: A California Saga|journal=Rolling Stone|date=October 28, 1971|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-beach-boys-a-california-saga-19711028|issue=94|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he famously installed a [[hotboxing]] tent in his home and relocated a grand piano to a sandbox in his living room.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p = 130}}{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=36}} Between April and September 1966, Wilson and Parks spent many "all night sessions" co-writing a number of songs in the sandbox,&lt;ref name="Vosse1969"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Vosse|first=Michael|title=Our Exagmination Round His Factification For Incamination of Work in Progress: Michael Vosse Talks About ''Smile''|magazine=Fusion|date=April 14, 1969|volume=8|url=http://i351.photobucket.com/albums/q476/marcus1970/|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; including "[[Heroes and Villains]]", "[[Surf's Up (song)|Surf's Up]]", "[[Wonderful (The Beach Boys song)|Wonderful]]", "[[Cabin Essence]]" and "[[Wind Chimes (song)|Wind Chimes]]".{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=117}}{{refn|group=nb|Wilson removed the sandbox installation once he realized his pets were using it as a [[litter box]].&lt;ref name="BDW" /&gt;}} Throughout the summer of 1966, Wilson also concentrated on finishing  "Good Vibrations",{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=5}} ''Dumb Angel'' was renamed to ''Smile'' around October 1966.{{sfn|Matijas-Mecca|2017|p=50}} [[Carl Wilson]] said that this was because the group was focusing on spirituality and "the concept of spreading goodwill, good thoughts and happiness".&lt;ref name=Rave1967&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grant|first1=Mike|title='Our influences are of a religious nature': the Beach Boys on Smile|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/11/beach-boys-smile-brian-wilson|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=October 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian wrote that the stylized version of the title, ''SMiLE'', "was partly about forgetting the ego".{{sfn|Wilson|Greenman|2016}}

Brian envisioned ''Smile'' as an outlet for all of his intellectual occupations,{{sfn|Priore|1995|p=230}} such as his fascination with [[spirituality]] and its relationship to [[humor]] and [[laughter]].{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=36}} Music journalist [[Jules Siegel]] famously recalled that, during one evening in October, Wilson announced to his wife and friends that he was "writing a teenage symphony to God".{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=101}} At the time, Wilson was reading works such as the ''[[I Ching]]'', [[Subud]] philosophy, tracts on astrology, detailed charts of the stars and planets, various topics of [[mysticism]], ''[[The Little Prince]]'', the novels of [[Hermann Hesse]], works by [[Kahlil Gibran]], [[Rod McKuen]], and [[Walter Benton (poet)|Walter Benton]]'s ''This is My Beloved''.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=247}}{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=19}} According to an unnamed participant, "If you came up to the house and introduced something new to Brian's thought processes—astrology, a different way to think about [[History of Sino-Russian relations|the relationship of Russia to China]], anything at all—if all of a sudden he was into that, it would find its way into the music. You could hear a bit and say, 'I know where that feeling came from.'"&lt;ref name="Nolan1971"/&gt;

==Associates and media hype==
Before ''Pet Sounds'' was released, the Beach Boys hired former [[Beatles]] press agent [[Derek Taylor]] as their publicist. Wilson requested that Taylor establish a new image for the group as fashionable counterculture icons, and so a promotional campaign with the tagline "[[Brian Wilson is a genius]]" was created and coordinated by Taylor.{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|pp=92–93}}{{refn|group=nb|Taylor is widely recognized as instrumental in the album's success with the British due to his longstanding connections with the Beatles and other industry figures in the UK.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=152}}}}  Meanwhile, Wilson became acquainted with former [[MGM Records]] agent [[David Anderle]] thanks to a mutual friend, singer [[Danny Hutton]] (later of [[Three Dog Night]]). Anderle, who was nicknamed "the mayor of hip", acted as a conduit between Wilson and the "hip".{{sfn|Gaines|1986|pp=155–156, 158}} Parks said that, eventually, "it wasn't just Brian and me in a room; it was Brian and me ... and all kinds of self-interested people pulling him in various various directions."{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=117}} The album held a grandiose importance among those involved, as David Anderle said, "''Smile'' was going to be a monument. That's the way we talked about it, as a monument."{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p = 130}} 

Additional writers were brought in as witnesses to Wilson's [[CBS Columbia Square|Columbia]], [[Gold Star Studios|Gold Star]], and [[United Western Recorders|Western]] recording sessions, who also accompanied him outside the studio. Among the crowd: [[Richard Goldstein (writer born 1944)|Richard Goldstein]] from the ''[[Village Voice]]'', Jules Siegel from ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', and [[Paul Williams (music journalist)|Paul Williams]], the 18-year-old founder and editor of ''Crawdaddy!''{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=94}} As Wilson made more connections, his social circle "enlarged to encompass a whole new crowd," biographer [[Steven Gaines]] writes. "Some of these people were 'drainers,' [but others] were talented and industrious".{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=158}}  Other notable friends of Brian in this era included [[Michael Vosse]], Anderle's assistant, and Paul Jay Robbins, a journalist from the [[underground press]].{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=33}}

Released on October 10, 1966, "Good Vibrations" was the Beach Boys' third US number-one hit, reaching the top of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in December, and became their first number one in Britain.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=155–156}} That month, the record was their first single certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=86}} [[Dennis Wilson]] told a reporter that the new album "makes ''Pet Sounds'' stink—that's how good it is!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Altham|first=Keith|title=The Beach Boys: 'Don't you just love people?'—a classic interview from the vaults|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/03/beach-boys-1966-rocks-backpages|work=Rock's Backpages|publisher=The Guardian|location=London|date=July 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Priore|1988|p = 198}}  The Beach Boys were soon voted the number-one band in the world in an annual readers' poll conducted by ''NME'', ahead of the Beatles, [[the Walker Brothers]], [[the Rolling Stones]], and [[the Four Tops]].{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|pp=86–87}} ''[[Hit Parader]]'' wrote: "The Beach Boys' album ''Smile'' and single "Heroes And Villains" will make them the greatest group in the world.

In November 1966, Brian was filmed performing a solo version of "Surf's Up" on grand piano for a CBS News special on popular music: ''[[Inside Pop: The Rock Revolution]]''. The special was not aired until April 1967.{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=37}} In the interim, Capitol sent promotional materials to record distributors and dealers, and ads were placed in ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]''{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p = 105}}  and teenage magazines{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=118}} including ''Teen Set''.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=96}} One ad compared the album to the films ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' and ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'', both directed by [[Orson Welles]].{{sfn|Priore|1995}} Capitol circulated a promotional ad for employees at its label, using "Good Vibrations" as the backdrop against a voice-over reciting the album's promotional tagline: "With a happy album cover, the really happy sounds inside, and a happy in-store display piece, you can't miss! We're sure to sell a million units... in January!"{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=96}}

Several months after [[Collapse of Smile|the project's collapse]], a memoir written by Jules Siegel was published in an article for ''Cheetah'' magazine entitled "[[Goodbye Surfing, Hello God!]]" Many of the project's subsequent myths and legends derived from this single article.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=103–105}}{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=102}} Commenting on the reliability of figures such as Anderle, Siegel, and Vosse, journalist [[Nick Kent]] wrote that their claims are oftentimes "so lavish [that] one can be forgiven, if only momentarily, for believing that Brian Wilson had, at that time orbited out to the furthermost reaches of the celestial stratosphere for the duration of this starcrossed project."{{sfn|Priore|1995|p=264}} Gaines acknowledged that the "events surrounding the album differed so much according to each person's point of view, that no one can be certain."{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=162}}

==Production==
===Modular approach===

The ''Smile'' sessions were intentionally limited to recording short interchangeable fragments also referred to as "modules".&lt;ref name="ARP"/&gt; With "Good Vibrations", Wilson further expanded his modular approach to recording, experimenting with compiling the finished track by editing together the numerous sections from multiple versions recorded at the lengthy tracking sessions.{{refn|Wilson honed his atypical production methods over several years. In the 1960s, it was common for pop music to be recorded in a single take, but the Beach Boys' approach differed.{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=116}} Using multitrack technology, elements such as backing vocals and guitar solos were often recorded independently and would later be combined to the basic track. From 1964 onward Wilson also began to physically cut tape to craft his recordings, allowing hard-to-sing vocal sections to be recorded, cut and attached with sticky tape to the start or endings of songs. By the time of the ''[[Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)|Summer Days]]'' album in 1965, Wilson was becoming more adventurous in his use of tape splicing. An example is the ''a cappella'' track "And Your Dream Comes True", which was recorded in sections and then carefully edited together to create the final song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bell|first=Matt|title=The Resurrection of Brian Wilson's Smile|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/Oct04/articles/smile.htm|work=Sound on Sound|publisher=soundonsound.com|accessdate=July 16, 2013|date=October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group = nb}} Instead of taping each backing track as a more-or-less complete performance—as had been the model for previous Beach Boys recordings—he split the arrangement into sections, recording multiple takes of each section and developing and changing the arrangements and the production as the sessions proceeded. He sometimes recorded the same section at several different studios, to exploit the unique sonic characteristics or special effects available in each. Then, he selected the best performances of each section and edited these together to create a composite which combined the best features of production and performance. This meant that each section of the song was presented in its own distinct sonic envelope, rather than the homogeneous production sound of a conventional "one take" studio recording. The [[cut-up technique|cut-up]] structure and heavily edited production style of ''Smile'' was unique for its time in mainstream popular music,{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=117}}&lt;ref name="FreakyMike"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AZCentral /&gt; and to assemble an entire album from short musical fragments was a relatively bold undertaking.{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=116}}

{{quote box

[[Carl Wilson]] likened the assembly process to [[film editing]], a view shared by ''Smile'' archivist [[Alan Boyd]] who stated: "I think he was right about that. The kind of editing that the project required seemed more like the process of putting a film together than a pop record."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wolk|first1=Douglas|title=The Smile Sessions: The Story Behind the Box|url=http://www.wonderingsound.com/interview/the-smile-sessions-the-story-behind-the-box/|date=October 31, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105194949/http://www.wonderingsound.com/interview/the-smile-sessions-the-story-behind-the-box/|archivedate=January 5, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BrittPopMatters&gt;{{cite web|last1=Britt|first1=Thomas|title=The Beach Boys: The SMiLE Sessions|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/152324-the-beach-boys-the-smile-sessions/|publisher=''[[PopMatters]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|When compiling ''[[The Smile Sessions]]'', Boyd made use of film editing software [[Final Cut Pro]]. In a ''Mojo'' interview with Harvey Kubernik, Linett recounts that someone once said, "Brian was trying to do [[digital editing]] 20 or 30 years before it was invented."&lt;ref name=BrittPopMatters/&gt;}} This fragmentary approach can be related to "dangling clauses", a concept defined by [[David Bordwell]] thusly: "An unresolved action is presented near the end of one section that is picked up and pushed further in a later section. Every scene will tend to contain unresolved issues that demand settling further along."&lt;ref name=BrittPopMatters/&gt; This results in ambiguity for when and where most ''Smile'' songs begin and end, as many of them lack clearly defined song structures.&lt;ref name="ARP"/&gt;

Marshall Heiser interpreted the album's style of jumpcuts a "striking characteristic", and that they "must be acknowledged as compositional statements in themselves, giving the music a sonic signature every bit as noticeable as the performances themselves. There was no way this music could be 'real.' Wilson was therefore echoing the techniques of ''[[musique concrète]]'' and seemed to be breaking the audio 'fourth wall'—if there can said to be such a thing."&lt;ref name="ARP"/&gt; Parks said that the duo was conscious of ''musique concrete'', and that they "were trying to make something of it", naming Brian as a pioneer for its application in pop music.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=70}} Music journalist [[Paul Williams (Crawdaddy! creator)|Paul Williams]] suggested that Brian Wilson may well have been one of the earliest pioneers of [[sampling (music)|sampling]].{{sfn|Williams|2010|p=86}} Author [[Domenic Priore]] argued that Brian "manipulated sound effects in a way that would later be extremely successful when [[Pink Floyd]] released ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' in 1973, the best-selling album of the entire [[progressive rock]] period".{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=79}} Other methods of tape manipulation used on ''Smile'' included [[varispeed]].{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=83}}

===Recording history===
{{Further|#Reconstructions}}
Fifty hours of tape was amassed from a ten-month-long course of album recording sessions.&lt;ref name="ARP"/&gt; Music sessions occurred mainly at Hollywood recording studios [[United Western Recorders]], [[Gold Star Studios]], [[Sunset Sound Recorders]] and [[CBS Columbia Square]]. Oftentimes, [[Chuck Britz]] and [[Larry Levine]] assisted Brian with engineering, who produced every session, while most instrumentation was played by [[the Wrecking Crew (music)|the Wrecking Crew]]. The vocal sessions for ''Smile'' were usually done at CBS Columbia, which had the only 8-track audio recorder available amongst the major recording studios at the time.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Work on what would have been the core album track "Good Vibrations" begun in February 1966 during the ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' era. Three months later in May, an early tracking of "[[Heroes and Villains]]" was attempted. The ''Smile'' sessions officially began on August 3, 1966 with "[[Wind Chimes (song)|Wind Chimes]]", and from then on, Wilson led a long and complex series of sessions—approximately 50 overall, discounting the 17 sessions needed for "Good Vibrations"—that continued in earnest until April 14, 1967.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=188}} In December 1966, Brian informed Capitol that ''Smile'' would not be ready by January 1, but he advised that he would deliver it prior to January 15.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=167}} Once he missed that deadline, he continued work mostly on "Heroes and Villains" and "Vega-Tables" as potential singles.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=111}} After a final backing track session designated for "[[Love to Say Dada]]" on May 18, 1967, ''Smile'' was abandoned.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=188}}

''[[Smiley Smile]]'' sessions immediately followed at [[Brian Wilson's home studio]] on June 3. In November 1968 and June–July 1971, the tracks "[[Cabinessence]]", "[[Our Prayer]]", and "[[Surf's Up (song)|Surf's Up]]" would be treated with [[overdub]]s and completed by [[Carl Wilson|Carl]] and [[Dennis Wilson]] for other Beach Boys albums.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=188}}

In 1966 after being asked by a journalist how he would label his new music, Wilson responded, "I'd call it contemporary American music, not rock 'n' roll. Rock 'n' roll is such a worn out phrase. It's just contemporary American."{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=69}} In 2011, Brian questioned a journalist how they would categorize ''Smile'', with their response being "[[impressionism in music|impressionistic]] [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] folk rock", and that while most rock seems to be about adulthood, ''Smile'' "expresses what it's like to be a kid in an impressionistic way" and "depicts the psychedelic magic of childhood", to which Wilson replied: "I love that.

No official track sequencing was decided in 1967, and although numerous track listing and running orders were eventually established decades later,&lt;ref name="BDW" /&gt; Brian  has stated that the original ''Smile'' would have been "less uplifting" than his [[Brian Wilson Presents Smile|finished 2004 version]].

"[[Heroes and Villains]]" was the ultimate keystone for the musical structure of the album, and the considerable time and effort that Wilson devoted to it is indicative of its importance, both as a single and as part of the ''Smile'' narrative. Like "Good Vibrations", it was edited together from many discrete sections. Additionally, most individual tracks on ''Smile'' were composed as potential sections of "Heroes and Villains".{{refn|This includes "[[Do You Like Worms?]]", "[[I'm in Great Shape]]", "[[Vega-Tables]]", "[[Love to Say Dada]]", "[[He Gives Speeches]]", "[[Cabin Essence]]", and "[[My Only Sunshine]]". The complexity of Wilson's production at this time can be gauged by the sheer bulk of session material that has survived—more than 60 tracks in the five-CD ''The Smile Sessions'' boxed set are session recordings for "Heroes and Villains".&lt;ref name="Smile Sessions" /&gt;{{better source|date=August 2015}}|group = nb}} Nearly thirty sessions for the various versions of "Heroes and Villains" spanned from May 1966 to July 1967.{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=113}} There are dozens of takes spanning each section of the song, multiple versions of both the variant sections, and many attempts to splice together final mixes. One of the other centerpieces of ''Smile'' was to be "[[Surf's Up (song)|Surf's Up]]", which had been for many years perceived as the intended ending climax of ''Smile'', preceding a section described as a "[[amen|choral amen]] sort of thing."&lt;ref name="Vosse1969"/&gt;{{refn|group=nb|Domenic Priore reported in 2011: "I don’t always subscribe to things Brian Wilson may say now because, a lot of the time, I think Brian is kind of reading ad copy, in a way, when you talk to him.

All of the other tracks were either not recorded or only exist in part-completed form, and many ''Smile''-era recordings lack their full vocal arrangements, lyrics and melodies. Many of the shorter tracks, along with many other brief instrumental and vocal pieces, were evidently intended to serve as bridging sections that would have been edited in to provide links between the major songs.&lt;ref name="ARP"/&gt; Nearly all of the ''Smile'' tracks fluxed in state between August 1966 and May 1967, with the only exception being "[[Our Prayer]]": a short [[hymn]] intended by Wilson to be the opening "spiritual invocation" of the ''Smile'' album.&lt;ref name="Prokopy"&gt;{{cite web|last=Prokopy|first=David E.|title=The Prokopy Notes|url=http://www.angelfire.com/mn/smileshop/essaysprokopy.html|work=The Smile Shop|publisher=thesmileshop.net|accessdate=July 28, 2013|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leaf|first=David|title=Friends / 20/20 liner notes|url=http://albumlinernotes.com/Friends___20_20.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A track entitled "[[On a Holiday|Holidays]]" was recorded as an oblique instrumental in September 1966, and is one of the few pieces from ''Smile'' where every section was performed as part of one whole take.&lt;ref name="Primer"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shenk|first=Lou|title=Smile Primer|url=http://www.alphastudio.com/recordroom/essays_primer.html|publisher=alphastudio.com|accessdate=July 28, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212184838/http://www.alphastudio.com/recordroom/essays_primer.html|archivedate=December 12, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|"Holidays" was re-recorded with vocals for ''[[Brian Wilson Presents Smile]]'' as "On A Holiday" in 2004.|group = nb}} "[[You're Welcome (song)|You're Welcome]]" is a short chant sung by the Beach Boys over a thumpy background track featuring a glockenspiel and a timpani.{{refn|It was later released as the B-side to the 1967 "[[Heroes and Villains]]" single.|group = nb}} The other Wilson brothers also experimented with their own compositions in between sessions for the ''Smile'' album, but it's doubtful if they were to have been included in the album.{{refn|Of these, instrumental tracks labelled "I Don't Know" (by [[Dennis Wilson]]) and "Tones" (also known as "Tune X"; by [[Carl Wilson]]) have survived.&lt;ref name="Primer"/&gt;|group = nb}} A brief medley of the traditional standards "[[The Old Master Painter]]" and "[[You Are My Sunshine]]" was also recorded,{{refn|It was marked as "[[My Only Sunshine]]" on tape boxes.|group = nb}} along with a short instrumental cover version of "[[I Wanna Be Around]]".{{refn|group = nb|Domenic Priore noted: "One odd thing about the release of ''[[Brian Wilson Presents Smile]]'' in 2004 was a change in the original sequencing of pieces. ...

In 1988, Wilson also mentioned to [[Andy Paley]] that the musical reference of Johnny Mercer's song 'I Wanna Be Around' was specifically used to invoke the lyrical phrase 'I wanna be around to pick up the pieces of our broken love affair' – that is to say, picking up the pieces after the fire. In two places, and in two different eras, Brian had laid down clues to collaborators that the 'I Wanna Be Around'/’Workshop' combination was a cool-out and reconstruction after '[[Mrs. O'Leary's Cow (instrumental)|Mrs O'Leary's Cow]]'."{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=83}}}}

{{quote|It was just more textural, more complex and it had a lot more vocal movement. "Good Vibrations" is a good example of that.

Each movement had its own texture and required its own session. ... "Cabin Essence" was a tough one. Just the alacrity of the parts and the movements. There was wind driven part in the parts around "''who ran the iron horse''" – a lot of challenging vocal exercises and movements in that one. But we enjoyed those challenges. There was almost like a competition among us between who could do their part better than the other guy – but a healthy one. ... there was one part that I'd forgotten about where we sang this dissonant chord – this strange chord, which sounded like the [[train whistle|whistle of a train]].

Online journal ''Freaky Trigger'' states: "While the lyrics are usually pretty damned literary, at their most extreme, they’re divorced from any kind of meaning in the straightforward sense." While suggesting that "the line between the sung word and mere sound become criss-crossed and blurred again and again and again ... where the word becomes subservient to sound, which is only six or so steps on the road to sound-for-the-sake-of-sound", and reflecting on the image of "Brian jammin' with Sun Ra and [[John Cage]]", the journal concludes that it was a style of music which could be simply classified as doo-wop, a genre that the group had already familiarized themselves in for years.&lt;ref name="FreakyMike"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Michael|title=Let's Just Say That Sometimes ? &gt; !|journal=Freaky Trigger|date=June 7, 1999|url=http://freakytrigger.co.uk/ft/1999/06/lets-just-say-that-sometimes/|accessdate=July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ''Smile'' did not lend itself to any formal narrative development, only to themes and experiences; though ''Smile'' references some specifically, it is only in passing.&lt;ref name="ARP"/&gt; Most of the album's thematic direction was given to Parks with hardly any instruction from Wilson. Together, the two desired a back-to-basics approach to songwriting, as Wilson summarized, "We wanted to capture something as basic as the mood of water and fire."&lt;ref name=paste2004/&gt;

It is generally acknowledged that Wilson and Parks intended ''Smile'' to be explicitly American in style and subject, a conscious reaction to the overwhelming [[British invasion|British dominance]] of popular music at the time.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=94}}{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=117}} It was conceived as a musical journey across America from east to west, beginning at [[Plymouth Rock]] and ending in Hawaii, traversing some of the great themes of modern American history and culture including the impact of white settlement on Native Americans, the influence of the Spanish, the [[Wild West]] and the opening up of the country by railroad and highway.&lt;ref name=paste2004/&gt;{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=66}}{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=117}} Some historical events touched upon range from [[Manifest destiny]], [[American imperialism]], [[Territorial evolution of the United States|westward expansion]], the [[Great Chicago Fire]], and the [[Industrial Revolution]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

[[File:The Beatles in America.JPG|right|thumb|''Smile'' was partly intended to combat the [[British Invasion]] sparked by [[the Beatles]] in 1964]]

In reference to how [[George Gershwin]] "Americanized" jazz and classical music, Wilson in his own words intended to "'Americanize' early America and mid-America".&lt;ref name="EC" /&gt; Parks said that the duo "kind of wanted to investigate … American images. … Everyone was hung up and obsessed with everything totally British. So we decided to take a gauche route that we took, which was to explore American slang, and that's what we got."&lt;ref name="NYbooks"&gt;{{cite web|last=Parks|first=Van Dyke|title=IN RESPONSE TO: A Lost Pop Symphony from the September 22, 2005 issue|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2006/jan/12/smile/|work=The New York Review of Books|publisher=nybooks.com|date=January 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He clarified this notion further by saying, "So this is what this stuff was: American music. We would use the thematic America. We would be the Americans. Why do that? Everybody else was getting their snout in the British trough. Everybody wanted to sing 'bettah&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;', affecting these [[transatlantic accent]]s and trying to sound like [[the Beatles]]. I was with a man who couldn't do that.

Aside from focusing on American cultural heritage, ''Smile'''s themes include scattered references to [[childhood]], [[physical fitness]], [[poetry]], and [[God]].&lt;ref name=ZahlThatTime2011&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zahl|first1=David|title=That Time The Beach Boys Made a Teenage Symphony to God|url=http://www.mbird.com/2011/11/the-beach-boys-smile-a-teenage-symphony-to-god/|publisher=Mockingbird|date=November 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many traits in ''Smile'' lyrics are reminiscent of [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] period imagery{{sfn|Dillon|2012|p=143}} and the [[Romantic poetry]] movement that began in the mid-to-late 18th century, with the biggest focus being on the ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'' collection of poems written by English poet [[William Blake]]. Thematic links to ''Songs of Innocence and of Experience'' by concept of childhood and spirituality carry throughout other songs and tracks. However, the piece "[[My Heart Leaps Up]]" by [[William Wordsworth]] originated the idiom "''[[Child Is Father of the Man]]''" later recycled by Wilson and Parks.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Other general ''Smile'' themes have been recited by ''Smile'' visual artist [[Frank J. Holmes|Frank Holmes]] to have included "travel, [[nature]], history, communications, [[Romance (love)#In literature|love stories]], [[virtue]], [[betrayal]], bucolic splendor, [[astrology]], [and] [[mystery fiction|mystery]]".&lt;ref name="Smile Sessions" /&gt;{{better source|date=August 2015}}

''Smile'' drew heavily on American popular music of the past; Wilson's original compositions were interwoven with snippets of significant songs of yesteryear including "[[The Old Master Painter]]", the perennial "[[You Are My Sunshine]]" ([[List of U.S. state songs|state song]] of [[Louisiana]]), [[Johnny Mercer]]'s [[jazz]] standard "[[I Wanna Be Around]]" (recorded by [[Tony Bennett]]), "[[Gee (The Crows song)|Gee]]" by the 1950s [[doo-wop]] group [[the Crows]] and quotations from other 20th century pop culture reference points such as the [[Woody Woodpecker]] theme and "[[Twelfth Street Rag]]". These references tended to thematically blur with the other ''Smile'' elements, and there was no definite line drawn between the established Americana and spirituality themes.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Perhaps the least obvious example of this blur would be "The Old Master Painter"—the "master painter" described in the song's lyrics refers to God.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=68}} This is continued in the lyrics to the Wilson/Parks original "[[Surf's Up (song)|Surf's Up]]", which imagines [[religious experience]], "canvassing the town", and "[[Henry Beresford, 3rd Marquess of Waterford|brushing the backdrop]]". Various 18th–20th century works such as "[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]", "[[This Land Is Your Land]]", "[[See See Rider]]", "[[Frère Jacques]]", "[[Auld Lang Syne]]", "[[My Prayer]]", "[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (poem)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]", and ''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]'' are also alluded to in song lyrics or titles.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

[[Arthur Koestler]]'s book, ''[[The Act of Creation]]'', had a profound effect on Wilson that carried deeply into the ''Smile'' project, specifically the human logistics of [[laughter]]. Wilson pointed to the book's three-category division of the human mind: Humor, Discovery, and Art;&lt;ref name="IJWMFTT" /&gt; he has admitted that he was most influenced by Koestler's first rule of [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]], Humor, as he explained in 2005: "''The Act of Creation'' by Arthur Koestler turned me on to some very special things…it explains that people attach their egos to their sense of humor before anything else.

[[File:Chicago-fire1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Artist's rendering of the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871, an event which "[[The Elements: Fire|Fire]]" was based on]]

"The Elements" was a reputed four-part movement which encompassed the four [[classical element]]s: [[Air (classical element)|Air]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], and [[Water (classical element)|Water]].{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=163}}{{refn|"[[The Elements: Fire|Fire]]" (also known as "[[The Elements: Fire|Mrs. O'Leary's Cow]]") is the only surviving recording that is certain to have been part of any identifiable movement on the original ''Smile'' album, while "[[Vega-Tables]]' was considered to fulfill the "Earth" portion of the movement. For ''Brian Wilson Presents Smile'', the other missing components were filled in "[[Wind Chimes (song)|Wind Chimes]]" (Air) and "[[Love to Say Dada]]", which lost its birth/rebirth origins and was instead repurposed as "[[In Blue Hawaii]]" (Water).{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=163}}|group = nb}} According to Domenic Priore, conversations between him and Van Dyke Parks have told that "The Elements" were meant to invoke the increasing attention to health, fitness, and environmentalism by [[anti-war]] [[peace movement]]s.&lt;ref name="Domenic2002" /&gt; Alternatively, [[Darian Sahanaja]]—a close associate of Wilson and Parks—has said: "Brian never ever referred to any of the pieces as being part of some Elemental concept, and whenever I did bring up the concept he didn’t seem to react to it with any enthusiasm. I brought it up again while Van Dyke was around and didn’t get a clear reaction from him either. My gut feeling is that it was one of many subplots and underlying themes being tossed around back in the day.

{{quote|[H]e was really into the elements. He ran up to [[Big Sur]] for a week, just 'cause he wanted to get into that, up to the mountains, into the snow, down to the beach, out to the pool, out at night, running around, to water fountains, to a lot of water, the sky, the whole thing was this fantastic amount of awareness of his surroundings. So the obvious thing was to do something that would cover the physical surroundings. … We were aware, he made us aware, of what fire was going to be, and what water was going to be; we had some idea of air.

During the latter half of the 1960s, Wilson began an obsession with fitness that led him to move the furniture out of his living room in order to make room for tumbling mats and exercise bars; later briefly serving as the co-owner of his own [[health food store]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=270, 430}} Wilson reported in 1967, "I want to turn people on to vegetables, good natural food, organic food. Health is an important element in spiritual enlightenment. But I do not want to be pompous about it, so we will engage in a satirical approach."{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=160}} Derek Taylor remembers: "He'd be sitting with me in this restaurant going on and on about this supposedly strict vegetarian diet of his, preaching vegetarianism at me while at the very same moment he'd be whacking down some massive hamburger."{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=31}}

==Artwork and packaging==
[[File:SMiLE The Beach Boys (logo).jpg|thumb|The ''Smile'' logo that was pictured on the original cover art]]

Capitol began production on a lavish gatefold cover with a twelve-page booklet in December 1966. Considered by some to be one of the most legendary album covers in rock,{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=101}} its artwork was commissioned from [[Frank J. Holmes|Frank Holmes]], a friend of Van Dyke Parks.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p = 100}} Holmes based the cover art on an abandoned jewelry store he'd seen near his home in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], added onto several visual interpretations of the album's lyrics that were illustrated by Holmes for the bonus ''Smile'' booklet scheduled for its packaging.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p = 100}} According to Michael Vosse, the "Smile shop" portrayed on the cover came from Brian's desire for a humor album, "and everybody who knew anything about graphics, and about art, thought that the cover was not terribly well done... but Brian knew better; he was right. It was exactly what he wanted, precisely what he wanted."&lt;ref name="Vosse1969"/&gt;{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=36}} The cover image would have been one of the earliest instances of a popular music group featuring original commissioned artwork.&lt;ref name=Oteri2011/&gt;

Holmes met with Wilson and Parks in June 1966, and suggested to Capitol Records executives that the album be packaged with a booklet of his illustrations. Holmes explains his role in the project: "So I came up with that store-front idea ... I thought that was a good image because of the way, any time you go into a store, you’re entering something, and the door opens and you go in, but its designed; it’s like a funnel. So I thought, 'Well, this would be a good graphic image on the front cover'—something that would pull you in. I knew that sales were important in selling music. This was something that would be pulling you into the world of ''Smile''—the Smile Shoppe—and it had these little smiles all around. There’s two people in there, too, a husband and wife—a kind of early-Americana, old-style, 19th-century kind of image."{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=102}} By October, Holmes had completed his contributions.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=102}}

Parks considered work by Holmes to be the "third equation" of ''Smile'', and that they would have not continued on the project the way they did without thinking of it in cartoon terms: "To me, it was a musical cartoon, and Frank showed that, without being told anything. There is ''some'' reference: Frank was supposed to do something 'light-hearted', but there were no specific instructions and he came up with the perfect video vessel for realizing what we were doing, something I thought was an integral part of the situation. I think that still stands; I think of ''Smile'' in visual terms."{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=100}} Capitol later added the repeated written instances of "Good Vibrations" on the album cover, which were not featured on the original design by Holmes.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=167}} Color photographs of the group were also taken by [[Guy Webster]]. 466,000 covers and 419,000 booklets were printed by early January 1967; with the aforementioned track list displayed on the back cover, along with a photographed depiction of the group minus Brian surrounded by astrological symbols.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=100}}{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=173}}

{{Main|Smiley Smile}}

After ''Smile'' was cancelled, the Beach Boys still needed to complete an LP record to fulfill their obligations to Capitol Records, so an album replacement was recorded throughout June and July 1967. As Wilson retreated to [[Brian Wilson's home studio|his recently acquired Bel Air mansion]], it became the venue for the recording of much of the Beach Boys' next album, ''[[Smiley Smile]]''.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p = 132}} Released that September, the album included newly stripped-down recordings of several ''Smile'' tracks. It was received with confusion by critics and was the group's lowest-selling album to date in the US, making only number 41 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], although it fared considerably better in Britain, where it reached number nine on the album chart.{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=119}} The album was later described by Carl Wilson as "a [[bunt (baseball)|bunt]] instead of a [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]]".&lt;ref name="SmileySmileliner"&gt;{{cite AV media notes| title = Smiley Smile/Wild Honey | others= [[The Beach Boys]]| year = 1990| first = David| last = Leaf|authorlink=David Leaf|publisher=[[Capitol Records]]|type=CD Liner|url=http://www.albumlinernotes.com/Smiley_Smile_Wild_Honey.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-June 1967, before the release of ''Smiley Smile'', Capitol A&amp;R director Karl Engemann began circulating a memo which discussed conversations between him and Wilson of a 10-track ''Smile'' album. It would have followed up the release of ''Smiley Smile'', and would not have included the selections "Heroes and Villains" nor "Vegetables".{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=195}}{{sfn|Priore|1988|p=160}} During promotion for the June 24 release of the "Heroes and Villains" single, Bruce Johnston told ''NME'' that the ''Smile'' album was expected for release within two months.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=131}} By July, the group's dispute with Capitol was resolved; it was then agreed that ''Smile'' would not be the band's next album.{{sfn|Dillon|2012|p=134}} Carl would soon frequently revisit the session tapes, taking into mind the possibility of salvaging them for future release.&lt;ref name="Domenic2002" /&gt; This amounted to a portion of "Workshop" being recycled for the closing of the 1969 single "[[Do It Again (The Beach Boys song)|Do It Again]]", in addition to him and Dennis completing the tracks "Our Prayer" and "Cabin Essence" for the Beach Boys' album ''[[20/20 (The Beach Boys album)|20/20]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}{{refn|group=nb|Elsewhere a portion of "[[Vega-Tables]]" was rerecorded for ''[[Wild Honey (album)|Wild Honey]]'' as "Mama Says", while a section written for "[[Child Is Father of the Man]]" appears in "[[Little Bird (The Beach Boys song)|Little Bird]]" for ''[[Friends (The Beach Boys album)|Friends]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}}}

Since portions of the instrumental track were missing a lead vocal, one was overdubbed by Carl.

A contract signed with Warner Bros. Records in 1970 following the group's departure from Capitol included a clause that stipulated a finished ''Smile'' to be delivered by May 1, 1973. Later in 1970, Brian spoke in a radio interview with Jack Rieley—who was then a DJ that Brian had recently met at his health food store called [[The Radiant Radish]]—about the track "Surf's Up", saying "It's just that it's too long. Instead of putting it on a record, I would rather just leave it as a song. It rambles. It's too long to make it for me as a record, unless it were an album cut, which I guess it would have to be anyway. It's so far from a singles sound. It could never be a single."{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=273}} Rieley then became the group's manager and adviser. With permission from Brian, between mid-June and early July 1971, Rieley and Carl retrieved most of the original ''Smile'' multi-tracks for careful examination. The primary reason for this trawl was to locate the masters for "Surf's Up", which was decided for inclusion on the Beach Boys forthcoming [[Surf's Up (album)|album of the same name]]. As progress continued, Brian gradually withdrew from the song's assembly, presumably due to the negative memories associated with the ''Smile'' sessions. Yet, the ''Surf's Up'' album was completed and released in August 1971 with its title track serving as the album's closer.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=293}} Besides its title track, ''Surf's Up'' bears no connection to ''Smile'' neither thematically nor musically, and no other tapes from the latter's sessions were used. Sometime after, Brian and [[American Spring]] contributed guest vocals for a cover of "Vegetables" by [[Jan and Dean]].{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=120}}

Early in 1972, the Beach Boys announced that they would be finishing ''Smile'' to follow up on the critical and commercial success of ''Surf's Up''. By the end of the year, the idea was either abandoned or forgotten, with Brian refusing to participate in any further ''Smile''-related reworkings, leading the group to pay a $50,000 fine.&lt;ref name="LostPopSymphony" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Domenic2002"&gt;{{cite web|last=Alpert|first=Neal|title=That Music Was Actually Created|url=http://www.gadflyonline.com/05-06-02/ftr-smile.html|work=Gadfly|publisher=Gadfly Online|accessdate=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|When asked about ''Smile'' in a 1973 interview at his home, Brian told ''Melody Maker'' that there wasn't enough material to put together the album, and that it would never be released.

He expounded that its release could only satisfy a highly-[[niche market|niche audience]], deeming the material too inaccessible for mainstream record-buyers, and explained, "Sometimes, you're kind of let down. Say you discover the tapes and you say, 'Oh yeah?' It's been talked about so much…It would live up to your expectations [only] if you were [[Zubin Mehta]] analyzing a young composer's work."{{sfn|Leaf|1978}}

In 1981, Johnston announced that there were plans to issue a brief six-minute compilation of the album's recording sessions without Brian's knowledge.

By the beginning of the 1990s, ''Smile'' gained status as the most famous unreleased pop album, and was a focal point for [[bootleg recording]] makers and collectors.&lt;ref name="P4k"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richardson|first=Mark|title=The Smile Sessions review|journal=Pitchfork|date=November 2, 2011|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16000-the-smile-sessions/|accessdate=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1980s, cassette bootlegs of the album's sessions were being passed around various musician circles.&lt;ref name="Aquarium" /&gt;&lt;ref name="justwasntmadeliner"&gt;{{cite web|last=Was|first=Don|title=1995 liner notes|url=http://albumlinernotes.com/I_Just_Wasnt_Made_For...html|work=I Just Wasnt Made For These Times album}}&lt;/ref&gt; These recordings made it clear that ''Smile'' had been much closer to completion than had previously been thought,{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=118}} and this prompted much excitement by fans over what additional songs might exist, and debate about how the songs fit into the ''Smile'' running order.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Unofficial reconstructions of the album were often attempted by fans in order to give the recordings a cohesive listening structure, thus "completing" the album.&lt;ref name="p4k2004"&gt;{{cite web|last=Leone|first=Dominique|title=Brian Wilson: Smile|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8781-smile/|work=Pitchfork|publisher=Pitchfork|accessdate=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For decades, fan-created playlists were the only way for the public to listen to an approximation of ''Smile'' as it would have been heard performed by the Beach Boys.&lt;ref name=paste2004/&gt;{{refn|One of the most popular of which, ''Purple Chick presents: The Beach Boys Smile'', was an online [[mix tape]] assembled shortly after Wilson began performing the ''Smile'' material in 2004.

With the emerging popularity of the Internet in the mid-1990s, the bootlegged ''Smile'' recordings became more widely available through a series of websites and "tape trees". A few websites offered full downloads of the tracks, and fan edits and arrangements started to appear. Beginning in 1997, the bootleg label [[The Beach Boys bootleg recordings#Sea of Tunes|Sea of Tunes]] (named after [[Sea of Tunes|the Beach Boys' original publishing company]]) began releasing a series of CDs featuring high quality outtakes, session tracks and alternate recordings that ranged across the group's entire career. Among these was a three-CD set featuring over three hours of sessions for "Good Vibrations", and several multi-CD sets containing a significant number of the tracking, overdubbing and mixing sessions for ''Smile''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beachboys.com/raritiesII.html BeachBoys.com (unofficial website) – Rarities: Sea of Tunes III]&lt;/ref&gt; Those involved with releasing these bootlegs were later apprehended by authorities, and it was reported that nearly 10,000 discs were seized.&lt;ref name="Forever Frown"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilonsky|first=Robert|title=The Forever Frown|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1999-12-23/music/the-forever-frown/|work=Phoenix New Times Music|publisher=phoenixnewtimes.com|accessdate=July 29, 2013|date=December 23, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its chosen focus being "new American music that is outside the commercial mainstream", online publication ''[[NewMusicBox]]'' made an exception with ''Smile'', citing its standing as "an album recorded more than 45 years ago by one of the biggest (and most financially lucrative) musical acts of all time".&lt;ref name=Oteri2011/&gt; The site's reviewer, Frank Oteri, wrote: "Wilson’s experiments in 1966 and 1967 seem normative of the kinds of things most interesting musicians in any genre were up to at that point and even tamer than some of them. The blurring of boundaries between musical genres was pretty much commonplace at that time, as was the attitude, however real or imagined, that just about any musical undertaking was somehow an expansion beyond anything that had come before it." According to Oteri, "the same pride of place in American music history held by other great innovators" such as [[Charles Ives]], [[George Gershwin]], [[John Cage]], [[John Coltrane]], and [[James Brown]] would "probably" never include ''Smile'', since, "For many people, the Beach Boys will always be perceived as a light-hearted party band that drooled over '[[California Girls]]' while on a '[[Surfin' Safari|Surfing Safari]]'."&lt;ref name=Oteri2011/&gt;

Reviewing the available bootlegs and officially released tracks for [[AllMusic]], [[Richie Unterberger]] acknowledged that "numerous exquisitely beautiful passages, great ensemble singing, and brilliant orchestral pop instrumentation" were in circulation, yet "the fact is that Wilson somehow lacked the discipline needed to combine them into a pop masterpiece that was both brilliant and commercial."&lt;ref name="Smile AllMusic" /&gt; Writing in ''[[The Rolling Stone Record Guide]]'', [[Dave Marsh]] bemoaned the hype that continued to surround Wilson and the ''Smile'' project throughout the 1970s, saying: "''Smile'' would have been a great album, we were assured each time the Beach Boys released a mediocre one. This myth remains forceful even though the title track of ''Surf's Up'' … was far less forceful and arguably less innovative than Wilson's surf-era hits." Marsh concluded: "The ''Smile'' legend is an exercise in myth-mongering almost unparalleled in show business: Brian Wilson became a Major Artist by making music that no one outside of his own coterie ever heard."{{sfn|Marsh|Swenson|1983|p=31}}

Toop argues that attempts to complete ''Smile'' are "misguided", naming ''Smile'' a "labyrinth" which exists "in a memory house into which Wilson invited all those who could externalize its elements" notwithstanding the user's familiarity with the album's fragments. He then proposes the inquiry: "Can a song say it all, depth breadth and flow, break its banks in flood yet still be a song?"&lt;ref name="Toop2011"/&gt; ''Freaky Trigger'' shared the same view, writing: "There is no ‘correct’ track sequence, there is no completed album, because ''Smile'' isn’t a linear progression of tracks. As a collection of modular melodic ideas it is by nature organic and resists being bookended."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Fred|title=SMiLE!|journal=Freaky Trigger|date=June 6, 1999|url=http://freakytrigger.co.uk/ft/1999/06/smile/|accessdate=July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Anderle believed "there never was a ''Smile''" while Marshall Heiser says "Possibly the best term offered yet to describe the project is: 'sonic menagerie'".&lt;ref name="ARP"/&gt;

Among musicians, [[Elvis Costello]] describes a ''Smile'' piano demo of "Surf's Up" as akin to an original recording of [[Mozart]] in performance, and added "It's such an amazing tune. The words are very much of the time, they sound beautiful when they're sung—and quite of lot of that is true with the rest of the songs that come from this period, where obviously there was a stress and strain in realizing the music."&lt;ref name="Endless Harmony" /&gt; [[Matthew Sweet]] felt: "Van Dyke's lyrics are so cool and Brian did right by them. He and Brian are trying to capture an impressionistic thing. That time is so experimental, and looking at it now, it's easy to see why it could be overlooked — because people just don't instantly understand really abstract stuff. It takes time to have a conversation about it before we realize what an amazing thing they did."{{sfn|Dillon|2012|p=150}} Referring to a ''Smile'' track where "a whole bunch of tubas [are] having a conversation with trumpets," [[Questlove]] of [[neo soul]] band [[the Roots]] said "[Brian Wilson]'s a modern-day Stravinsky … The way he constructs his music, he's a madman. … He was doing stuff [40 years ago] that modern people do now, looping his work and stuff."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moss|first1=Corey|title=Chili Peppers, Backstreet Salute Beach Boys' Brian Wilson|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1496895/chili-peppers-backstreet-salute-beach-boys-brian-wilson/|publisher=MTV|accessdate=July 24, 2014|date=February 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Torff, referring to ''Smile''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s advanced structures, noted: "Here was a guy who could craft something that was almost symphonic. … Not many people had that craft in pop music at that time. … [He was] really expanding the boundaries of what rock and pop music could be."&lt;ref name="CNN2012" /&gt;  {{clear left}} &lt;!----

Authors Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz write that it is "likely" that the release of ''Smile'' would have reformed the public perception of the Beach Boys.{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=119}} Mark Richardson of [[Pitchfork Media]] has described the album as a "rite of passage for students of pop music history", and adds: "If you're wired a certain way, once you learn the ''Smile'' story, you long to hear the album that never was. It looms out there in imagination, an album that lends itself to storytelling and legend, like the aural equivalent of the [[Loch Ness Monster]]. … So you might start hunting down bootlegs, poring over the fragments, and finding competing edits and track sequences, which only feeds your desire to know what the 'real' ''Smile'' could have been."&lt;ref name="P4k" /&gt; Writing for the same website, Spencer Owen says that the album could have dramatically altered the course of popular music history, such that "Perhaps we wouldn't be so monotheistic in our pop leanings, worshiping only at the Beatles' altar the way some do today."&lt;ref name="P4kSmileySmile"&gt;{{cite web|last=Owen|first=Spencer|title=Smiley Smile/Wild Honey review|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11667-smiley-smilewild-honey/|work=Pitchfork|accessdate=July 30, 2013|date=March 29, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former ''[[Record Collector]]'' editor [[Peter Doggett]] states that ''Smile'' would most likely have had the same reception as that afforded Parks' ''Song Cycle'' – namely, critical acclaim but a commercial disaster.{{sfn|Doggett|2015|p=373}}

In a special ''Smile'' edition of the ''33 1/3'' book series, Luis Sanchez writes:

{{quote|If the counterculture had suddenly made it possible for a generation of Americans to define themselves against their cultural inheritance, Brian and Parks weren't convinced. Their work spoke of an urge to explore their native culture not as outsiders, but to identify with it emphatically and see where it led them. If Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys were going to survive as the defining force of American pop music they were, ''Smile'' was a conscious attempt to rediscover the impulses and ideas that power American consciousness from the inside out. It was a collaboration that led to some incredible music, which, if it had been completed as an album and delivered to the public in 1966, might have had an incredible impact.

Considering the material that does survive, on its own terms, we can try to understand why ''Smile'' remains vital, and why it still matters as music. ... The music appeals not through any kind of detached countercultural outlook, but by taking the best aspects of The Beach Boys' music–scope of studio production, vocal harmonies, a sense of possibility–and shifting in a way that makes them sound total, ''consummate'', as if this music is the music Brian was ''meant'' to make. There is nothing phony or fawning about any of it.{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|pp=112, 114}}}}

Geoffrey Himes of ''[[Paste Magazine]]'' suggested that ''Smile'' would have had a greater impact than the Beatles' ''Sgt. Pepper'', since: "There have been countless rock opera, [[art rock]] and [[prog rock]] projects, but most have merely dressed up mediocre rock 'n’ roll in the gowns of grandiosity. But Wilson used the moving parts and shifting textures of art music not to show off but to reflect adulthood's mixed emotions. He used the through-line of classical composition not to replace pop's intimacy but to reinforce it, linking one personal moment to the next."&lt;ref name=paste2004/&gt; David Howard, writing in his book ''Sonic Alchemy'', says that "Had Wilson been able to connect all the dots, ''Smile'' would most certainly be regarded as one of pop's major artistic statements, rather than an infamous, unfortunate footnote.{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=77}} Arizona publication ''AZ Central'' wrote in 2011: "If ''Smile'' had arrived in 1967, it would have placed the Beach Boys on the front lines of pop's psychedelic revolution, out there with the Beatles' ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'', Pink Floyd's ''[[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn]]'', [[The Doors (album)|the Doors' first album]] and [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]]'s ''[[Are You Experienced?]]'' It doesn't sound like any of those albums, but it clearly shares their spirit of adventure in a way that would have been unthinkable just two years earlier."&lt;ref name=AZCentral /&gt;

In 1999, ''Freaky Trigger'' wrote that the album was not "the best album ever," but that it is "astoundingly original" for being antithetical to contemporary rock music, and that the nature of its "twilight existence challenges the legitimacy of that legend of rock which puts ''Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'' at its summit." It concludes that:

{{quote|''Smile'' is so attractive is because it's the tangible evidence of an alternative rock history which turned out differently ... None of which would matter a damn if the record was boring. It isn't ... The very idea of basing an album around laughter and good health seems cracked, naive and baffling, but that's what ''Smile'' allegedly is: a humour record. And given that every year the angst, contrariness and cynicism of rock’n’roll culture gets more tedious, more oppressive, maybe even more dangerous, the more people exposed to Wilson’s damaged but beautiful humanism the better.&lt;ref name="FreakyTrigger1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ewing|first1=Tom|title=Dumb Angles: The Myth and Promise Of Smile|journal=Freaky Trigger|date=June 5, 1999|url=http://freakytrigger.co.uk/ft/1999/06/dumb-angles-the-myth-and-promise-of-smile/|accessdate=July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====The Beach Boys' views====
[[File:The Beach Boys Smile (7300302550).jpg|thumb|right|The reunited Beach Boys in 2012, performing "[[Heroes and Villains]]" during [[the 50th Reunion Tour|their 50th anniversary tour]]]]

For many years after its shelving, Brian Wilson was terrified of ''Smile'', repeatedly denouncing the album while associating its music with all of his failures.&lt;ref name=paste2004 /&gt; At various points, he considered the recordings "contrived with no soul",{{sfn|Toop|1999|p=136}} being imitations of Phil Spector without "getting anywhere near him",{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=43}} and "corny drug influenced music".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kamer|first1=Gijsbert|title=Altijd bang|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2676/Cultuur/article/detail/723272/2004/07/09/Altijd-bang.dhtml|language=Dutch|date=July 9, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked in a 1987 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview whether ''Smile'' would have topped the Beatles' ''Sgt. Pepper'', Wilson replied: "No. It wouldn't have come close. ''Sgt. Pepper'' would have ''kicked our ass''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Steve|last=Pond|title=Brian Wilson|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=November 5 – December 10, 1987|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, he gradually became more comfortable discussing the work, calling it "too advanced" to have been released in 1967. Biographer [[Peter Ames Carlin]] disputes this, saying that Wilson invented this story as a generic line to feed journalists in 2004, and that "[being] ahead of his time is exactly what they were looking for."&lt;ref name=AZCentral /&gt; In 1993, Mike Love believed that ''Smile'' "would have been a great record," but in its unfinished state is "nothing, it's just fragments."&lt;ref name=mojo1993&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holdship|first=Bill|journal=MOJO magazine|date=August 1993|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Jardine felt "There's performances we probably should have finished. I can't tell you exactly what they are, but that's the way I feel."&lt;ref name=Sharp2013 /&gt; In the early 1990s, Carl said that he loved the ''Smile'' lyrics.&lt;ref name="IJWMFTT"/&gt;

Love has asserted that whatever misgivings he had toward ''Smile'' laid specifically toward some of the lyrics and not the music.&lt;ref name="CBS2012"&gt;''CBS Sunday Morning'', 2012 {{YouTube|id=S0aV3ku-ha8|title=CBS Sunday Morning – The Beach Boys 50th Anniversary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MOJO2011"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Beach Boys ''Smile''|journal=Mojo Magazine|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His statements were corroborated by Carl in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="IJWMFTT"&gt;{{cite AV media|people=[[Don Was|Was, Don]] (Director)|year=1995|title=Brian Wilson: I Just Wasn't Made for These Times|medium=[[Documentary film]]|url=|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Al Jardine spoke regarding Love: "He's a big [[Chuck Berry]] fan and he loves those kind of lyrics. … Mike was always trying to pinpoint Van Dyke saying, 'What does that mean?' And he would go, 'I don't know, I was high' (''laughs''). Mike would go, 'That's disgusting, that doesn't make any sense.'"&lt;ref name=Popmatters /&gt;

| quote = The potential of what ''Smile'' would have been was the primary thing that inspired us ([[Elephant 6]]). When we started hearing ''Smile'' bootlegs, it was mind-blowing. It was what we had hoped it would be, but a lot of those songs weren't finished, so there was still this mystery of not hearing the melodies and lyrics. We wondered, "What are these songs and how do they fit together? Is this a verse?"

''Smile'' became the progenitor for [[indie rock]],&lt;ref name=Oteri2011/&gt; and its saga became a touchstone for the more art-inclined branches of [[post-punk]].&lt;ref name=BBCMozart&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Carl|title=The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson: America's Mozart?|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20150608-is-this-americas-mozart|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=June 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various artists have cited ''Smile'' and its themes as a major influence. [[Kevin Shields]] of the Irish [[shoegaze]] band [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]] has said that the 2013 album ''[[MBV (album)|MBV]]'' was inspired by ''Smile'', expounding "The idea was to bring a lot of parts together, riffs or chord changes without making a song out of it. … I wanted to see what would happen if I worked in a more impressionistic way, so that it only comes together at the end."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/my-bloody-valentine/64118|title=Kevin Shields: The new My Bloody Valentine album was influenced by The Beach Boys &amp;#124; News|work=[[NME]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|date=June 2, 2012|accessdate=February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Elephant 6 Recording Company]], a collective of [[independent music|independent artists]] which include [[Apples in Stereo]], [[the Olivia Tremor Control]], [[Neutral Milk Hotel]], [[Beulah (band)|Beulah]], [[Elf Power]], and [[Of Montreal]], was founded through a mutual admiration of 1960s pop music, with ''Smile'' being "their [[Holy Grail]]".{{sfn|Dillon|2012|p=136}}  According to [[Kevin Barnes]], of Montreal's album ''[[Coquelicot Asleep in the Poppies: A Variety of Whimsical Verse]]'' (2001) was partially based on ''Smile''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Labate|first=Steve|title=The complete Paste interview|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2008/11/of-montreals-kevin-barnes-the-complete-paste-inter.html|work=Paste}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Olivia Tremor Control 2005.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Olivia Tremor Control]] in 2005]]

The album ''[[Black Foliage: Animation Music Volume One]]'' (1999) by the Olivia Tremor Control has been compared to ''Smile'' for its dichotomous vocal harmony pop and avant-garde tape manipulation.&lt;ref name="Forever Frown" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|title=Black Foliage: Animation Music, Vol. 1|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/black-foliage-animation-music-vol-1-mw0000236976|work=AllMusic|accessdate=June 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domenic Priore believes that ''Smile'' influence is evident on [[the Flaming Lips]]' ''[[The Soft Bulletin]]'' (1999), [[Mercury Rev]]'s ''[[All Is Dream]]'' (2001), the Apples in Stereo's ''[[Her Wallpaper Reverie]]'' (1999), [[Heavy Blinkers]]' 2000 eponymous LP, [[the Thrills]]' ''[[So Much for the City]]'' (2000), and [[XTC]]'s ''[[Oranges &amp; Lemons (album)|Oranges &amp; Lemons]]'' (1989).{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=155}}

Independent musicians and groups such as [[Ant-Bee]], [[Melt-Banana]], [[Jim O'Rourke (musician)|Jim O'Rourke]], [[Adventures in Stereo]], [[Rufus Wainwright]], and [[Secret Chiefs 3]] have all recorded cover versions of ''Smile'' tracks. ''[[Smiling Pets]]'' (1998) is a tribute album which largely focuses on various artists' interpretations of ''Smile''-era recordings by the Beach Boys.&lt;ref name="Forever Frown" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brainwashed.com/weddle/reviews/smiling.html|publisher=Web of Mimicry|title=Smiling Pets review}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the [[Wondermints]] performed a live cover of "Surf's Up" at the Morgan-Wixon Theater in Los Angeles with Brian in the audience, who was then quoted saying "If I'd had these guys back in '66, I could've taken ''Smile'' on the road."{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=156}}

Outside the realms of alternative music, composers for the 1994 [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] [[role-playing video game]] ''[[EarthBound]]'' cited ''Smile'' and related work as major influences on the game's soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.1101.com/MOTHER_music/index.html (translation: http://www.artcorekirbies.fr/perso/mother/suzutana/)&lt;/ref&gt; Priore also reported that [[Lindsey Buckingham]] accessed ''Smile'' master tapes for research purposes during the making of [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s ''[[Tusk (album)|Tusk]]'' (1979), and that the tracks "That's All For Everyone" and "Beautiful Child" most strongly exemplify the results.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=193}}

Both albums ''[[Making God Smile: An Artists' Tribute to the Songs of Beach Boy Brian Wilson]]'' (2002) and ''[[Smiles, Vibes &amp; Harmony: A Tribute to Brian Wilson]]'' (1990) features cover artwork reworked from the original ''Smile'' album artwork. The cover artwork for [[power pop]] band [[Velvet Crush]]'s ''Teenage Symphonies to God'' (1994) was based on Frank Holmes' artwork for ''Smile''.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=155}} Dutch [[avant-garde]] group Palnickx paid homage to ''Smile'' on their 1996 rock-themed concept album ''The Psychedelic Years''; the tracks "Phase Ten/Thirteen (Brian Wilson)" and "Phase Twelve (Fire/Rebuilding After the Fire)" feature multiple references to the project's themes, tracks, and legends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Couture|first=François|title=The Psychedelic Years|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-psychedelic-years-mw0000969766|work=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Weird Al Yankovic]] recorded a song on his 2006 album ''[[Straight Outta Lynwood]]'' modeled after ''Smile'''s aesthetic, entitled "Pancreas". Brian Wilson himself would later revisit ''Smile''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s themes and cut-up structure within his eponymous debut solo album ''[[Brian Wilson (album)|Brian Wilson]]'' (1988), which features the eight-minute-long psychedelic western saga "[[Rio Grande (song)|Rio Grande]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Matthew|first=Matthew|title=Rio Grande review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/rio-grande-mt0011287213|work=Allmusic|publisher=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scenes from the films ''[[Grace of My Heart]]'' and ''[[Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story]]'' both feature homages to ''Smile''. The latter contains the song "[[Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story (soundtrack)|Black Sheep]]", a parody of Brian Wilson's music style composed by Van Dyke Parks. The album's sessions were dramatized in the [[made-for-television]] [[biopics]] ''Summer Dreams: The Story of the Beach Boys'' and ''[[The Beach Boys: An American Family]]''. Portions of the ''Smile'' sessions are also dramatized in the 2014 Wilson biopic ''[[Love and Mercy (film)|Love and Mercy]]'', featuring [[Paul Dano]] as Brian Wilson and [[Max Schneider]] as Van Dyke Parks. The 1993 science fiction novel ''Glimpses'' by [[Lewis Shiner]] contains a chapter in which the protagonist travels back in time to November 1966 and helps Wilson complete ''Smile''.&lt;ref name="Forever Frown" /&gt; References to ''Smile'', its bootlegs, and the Beach Boys are made in the 2006 novel ''Eat the Document'' by [[Dana Spiotta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Radical on the Run, Determined to Escape the Past|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/03/books/03kaku.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|date=February 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Parish Church of Saint Matthew, Langford''' is the [[Church of England parish church]] of [[Langford, Oxfordshire|Langford]], a village in [[West Oxfordshire]] about {{convert|3|mi|0}} northeast of [[Lechlade]] in neighbouring [[Gloucestershire]].

==Government==
The church was established as a chapelry of the [[Minster (church)#Early and Mid Anglo-Saxon periods|Anglo-Saxon minster]] of [[Bampton, Oxfordshire#Parish church|St. Mary's, Bampton]]. Later in the [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon era]] Langford was elevated to a minster with its own dependent chapels at [[Grafton, Oxfordshire|Grafton]] and [[Radcot Bridge|Radcot]]. Both chapels are long gone, but Grafton and Radcot hamlets remain parts of Langford's [[ecclesiastical parish]].{{sfn|Cotterill|2008|p=3}}

Langford was part of the [[Diocese of Lincoln]] until the [[Diocese of Oxford]] was established under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in 1541. Despite becoming part of the new diocese, Langford remained a [[Prebendary#History|prebend]] of [[Lincoln Cathedral]] until 1848, when the [[Ecclesiastical Commissioners Act 1840]] ceded all prebendal estates in England to the [[Ecclesiastical Commissioners]].{{sfn|Cotterill|2008|p=6}}

The church at Langford was formerly dedicated to [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|St. Mary]]. It was later rededicated to its current patron, [[Matthew the Evangelist|St. Matthew]].{{sfn|Cotterill|2008|p=6}}

The parish is now part of the [[Benefice#Church of England|Benefice]] of Shill Valley and Broadshire, which includes also the parishes of [[Alvescot]], [[Black Bourton]], [[Broadwell, Oxfordshire|Broadwell]], [[Broughton Poggs]], [[Filkins]], [[Holwell, Oxfordshire|Holwell]], [[Kelmscott]], [[Kencot, Oxfordshire|Kencot]], [[Little Faringdon]], [[Shilton, Oxfordshire|Shilton]] and [[Westwell, Oxfordshire|Westwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.achurchnearyou.com/benefice.php?B=27/441BF |title=Benefice of Shill Valley and Broadshire |author=[[Archbishops' Council]] |publisher=[[Church of England]] |year=2010 |accessdate=28 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121226072306/http://www.achurchnearyou.com/benefice.php?B=27%2F441BF |archivedate=26 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anglo-Saxon building==
[[File:Langford StMatthew Crucifix.JPG|thumb|Headless rood of Christ, possibly 8th century, on east wall of south porch]]
[[File:Langford StMatthew rood.JPG|thumb|10th century rood of Christ, St. Mary and St. John on south gable of south porch]]
[[File:Langford StMatthew TowerDetail.JPG|thumb|11th century lancet windows and relief on the south wall of the tower]]
The oldest parts of the present church at Langford are the [[bell tower]] and [[nave]], which were built in the second half of the 11th century.{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|pp=678–679}} They may post-date the [[Norman conquest of England]], but they are very high quality work by Anglo-Saxon masons{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=679}} and are the most important Anglo-Saxon remains in Oxfordshire.{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=680}}

The north and south [[Aisle#Architecture|aisles]] were added in about 1200 and the south porch in the 13th century, all in the [[English Gothic architecture#Early English Gothic|Early English Gothic]] style.{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=679}} The west walls of the nave and two aisles each have a 13th-century [[lancet window]].{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=680}} At one time the porch had two storeys. The upper storey has since been removed, but its blocked doorway and the outline of its stairs are still visible inside the south aisle.{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=680}}

The porch includes two [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] stone [[Rood#Crucifix or cross|rood]] reliefs, but they are repositioned and their original sites are not known. The one on the east wall of the porch is 8th century{{sfn|Cotterill|2008|p=8}} and has lost its head.{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=681}} The one on the south gable of the porch is 10th century{{sfn|Cotterill|2008|p=7}} and has been assembled with [[Jesus Christ|Christ's]] left and right arms swapped over and the figures of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Saint Mary]] and Saint [[John the Evangelist]] also transposed.{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=680}}

==Later additions==
In the 13th century the [[chancel]] was rebuilt wider and taller.{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=680}} The line of the former 11th century Anglo-Saxon roof against the east wall of the tower can be seen at the west end of the chancel. The concave [[lozenge]] at the top of each of the chancel windows is a highly unusual feature for the 13th century.{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=680}} The elaborate [[aumbry]] in the north wall of the chancel, with six compartments under three gables, is also unusual{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=680}} and suggests that it was a rich parish at the time.{{sfn|Cotterill|2008|p=5}}

Most of the windows of the north wall of the north aisle and south wall of the south aisle are 14th or 15th century [[English Gothic architecture#Decorated Gothic|Decorated Gothic]] or [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular Gothic]] additions.{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=680}} The present [[Baptismal font|font]] is 15th century.{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=681}}

In 1574 two [[flying buttress]]es were added to the north side of the north aisle. The more westerly of the two bears an inscription giving the date in the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. A pair of tall, cylindrical pinnacles at the west end of the nave, surmounting the late Norman [[pilaster]] buttresses on the west gable wall, were also added in the 16th century.{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=680}}

The pulpit is [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]],{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=681}} made in 1673.{{sfn|Cotterill|2008|p=7}} A clock was installed in the latter part of the 17th century{{sfn|Beeson|Simcock|1989|p=45}} but is now a static exhibit in the south aisle.

==Restoration and conservation==
The architect and builder [[Richard Pace (Lechlade)|Richard Pace]] restored the building in 1829.{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=680}} Further repairs were recommended by the [[Ecclesiastical Commissioners]]' surveyor [[Benjamin Ferrey]] in 1848 and undertaken the following year.{{sfn|Cotterill|2008|p=8}} The [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival architect]] [[Ewan Christian]] [[Victorian restoration|restored]] the nave roof to its original pitch in 1864.{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=680}}

St. Matthew's is now a [[Listed building#Categories of listed building|Grade I listed building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE |num=1053385 |desc=Church of St Matthew |date= |accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bells==
The [[Bell tower|tower]] has a [[Change ringing|ring]] of six bells.&lt;ref name=DovesDetails&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/detail.php?searchString=Langford&amp;DoveID=LANGFORD+O |title=Langford S Matthew |last=Davies |first=Peter |date=5 April 2007 |work=Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers |publisher=[[Central Council of Church Bell Ringers]] |accessdate=8 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four were cast in 1741 by Henry III Bagley of [[Chacombe#Social and economic history|Chacombe]], [[Northamptonshire]],&lt;ref name=DovesDetails/&gt; who at the time had a [[Bellfounding|bell-foundry]] at [[Witney]].&lt;ref name=DovesFounders&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/founders.php |title=Bell Founders |author=Dovemaster |date=25 June 2010 |work=Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers |publisher=[[Central Council of Church Bell Ringers]] |accessdate=8 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tenor and treble bells were cast by the [[Whitechapel Bell Foundry]] in 1953.&lt;ref name=DovesDetails/&gt;

[[File:Peacock feathers closeup.jpg|thumb|250px| The brilliant iridescent colours of the peacock's tail feathers are created by structural coloration, as first noted by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Robert Hooke]].]]
'''Structural coloration'''&lt;!--"Coloration" is a standard British English spelling, as in [[Hugh Cott]]'s 1940 ''[[Adaptive Coloration in Animals]]'', and is also used in American English. It follows a little-known rule, that roots in ''-our'' when given Latinate suffixes should use the ''-or'' spelling accordingly, as if borrowed directly from Latin instead of through French: ''colouring'' and ''colourist'' but ''coloration'', ''colorimetry'', and ''colorize''; ''honourable'' but ''honorarium''; ''humourless'' but ''humorous''; and so on. So this apparent aberration is actually a kind of etymological spelling, although the American usage may have been an influence post-Webster. (See Fowler's [[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage|''MEU'']] sv '''-our- and -or-'''.)--&gt; is the production of colour by microscopically structured surfaces fine enough to interfere with [[visible light]], sometimes in combination with [[pigment]]s. For example, [[peacock]] tail [[feather]]s are pigmented brown, but their microscopic structure makes them also reflect blue, turquoise, and green light, and they are often [[iridescence|iridescent]].

Structural coloration was first observed by English scientists Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton, and its principle – [[wave interference]] – explained by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] a century later. Young described iridescence as the result of interference between reflections from two or more surfaces of [[thin films]], combined with refraction as light enters and leaves such films. The geometry then determines that at certain angles, the light reflected from both surfaces interferes constructively, while at other angles, the light interferes destructively. Different colours therefore appear at different angles.

[[Animal coloration|In animals]] such as on the feathers of birds and the scales of [[butterfly|butterflies]], interference is created by a range of [[photonic]] mechanisms, including [[diffraction grating]]s, selective mirrors, [[photonic crystals]], crystal fibres, matrices of nanochannels and proteins that can vary their configuration. Some [[cuts of meat]] also show structural coloration due to the exposure of the periodic arrangement of the muscular fibres. Many of these photonic mechanisms correspond to elaborate structures visible by [[electron microscopy]]. In the few plants that exploit structural coloration, brilliant colours are produced by structures within cells. The most brilliant blue coloration known in any living tissue is found in the marble berries of ''[[Pollia condensata]]'', where a spiral structure of cellulose fibrils produces [[Bragg's law]] scattering of light. The bright gloss of [[buttercup]]s is produced by thin-film reflection by the epidermis supplemented by yellow pigmentation, and strong diffuse scattering by a layer of starch cells immediately beneath.

Structural coloration has potential for industrial, commercial and military application, with [[Biomimicry|biomimetic]] surfaces that could provide brilliant colours, adaptive [[camouflage]], efficient optical switches and low-reflectance glass.

== History ==
[[File:Micrographia title page.gif|thumb|upright|[[Robert Hooke]]'s 1665 ''[[Micrographia]]'' contains the first observations of structural colours.]]

In his 1665 book ''[[Micrographia]]'', [[Robert Hooke]] described the "fantastical" colours of the [[peacock]]'s feathers:&lt;ref name=HookeOnPeacockIridescence&gt;Hooke, Robert. Micrographia. Chapter 36 ('Observ. XXXVI. ''Of Peacoks, Ducks, and Other Feathers of Changeable Colours''.')&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The parts of the Feathers of this glorious Bird appear, through the Microscope, no less gaudy then do the whole Feathers; for, as to the naked eye 'tis evident that the stem or quill of each Feather in the tail sends out multitudes of Lateral branches, … so each of those threads in the Microscope appears a large long body, consisting of a multitude of bright reflecting parts. &lt;br /&gt;… their upper sides seem to me to consist of a multitude of thin plated bodies, which are exceeding thin, and lie very close together, and thereby, like [[Nacre|mother of Pearl]] shells, do not onely reflect a very brisk light, but tinge that light in a most curious manner; and by means of various positions, in respect of the light, they reflect back now one colour, and then another, and those most vividly.  Now, that these colours are onely fantastical ones, that is, such as arise immediately from the refractions of the light, I found by this, that water wetting these colour'd parts, destroy'd their colours, which seem'd to proceed from the alteration of the reflection and refraction.&lt;ref name=HookeOnPeacockIridescence/&gt;}}

In his 1704 book ''[[Opticks]]'', [[Isaac Newton]] described the mechanism of the colours other than the brown pigment of peacock tail feathers.&lt;ref name="ExeterIridescence"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/research/emag/themes/natural-photonics/iridescenceinlepidoptera/ | work=Natural Photonics (originally in Physics Review Magazine) | publisher=University of Exeter | title=Iridescence in Lepidoptera | date=September 1998 | accessdate=April 27, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407082122/http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/research/emag/themes/natural-photonics/iridescenceinlepidoptera/ | archivedate=April 7, 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton noted that&lt;ref name=Newton&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/33504/33504-h/33504-h.htm | title=Opticks | last=Newton |first=Isaac| publisher=William Innys at the West-End of St. Paul's, London|edition=4th | date=1730| origyear=1704 | accessdate=April 27, 2012 | pages=Prop. V., page 251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The finely colour'd Feathers of some Birds, and particularly those of Peacocks Tails, do, in the very same part of the Feather, appear of several Colours in several Positions of the Eye, after the very same manner that thin Plates were found to do in the 7th and 19th Observations, and therefore their Colours arise from the thinness of the transparent parts of the Feathers; that is, from the slenderness of the very fine Hairs, or Capillamenta, which grow out of the sides of the grosser lateral Branches or Fibres of those Feathers.&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt;}}

[[File:NHM Chrysospalax trevelyani (cropped).JPG|thumb|left|In 1892, [[Frank Evers Beddard]] noted that  ''[[Chrysospalax]]'' golden moles' thick fur was structurally coloured.]]
[[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] (1773–1829) extended Newton's [[particle theory of light]] by showing that light could also behave as a wave. He showed in 1803 that light could diffract from sharp edges or slits, creating [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Young| first=Thomas| title=Experimental Demonstration of the General Law of the Interference of Light |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |year=1804 |volume=94|doi=10.1098/rstl.1804.0001 | pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shamos |first=Morris |title=Great Experiments in Physics |year=1959 |publisher=Holt Rinehart and Winston |location=New York |pages=96–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1892 book ''[[Animal Coloration (1892 book)|Animal Coloration]]'', [[Frank Evers Beddard]] (1858–1925) acknowledged the existence of structural colours:

{{quote|The colours of animals are due either solely to the presence of definite pigments in the skin, or … beneath the skin; or they are partly caused by optical effects due to the scattering, diffraction or unequal refraction of the light rays. Colours of the latter kind are often spoken of as structural colours; they are caused by the structure of the coloured surfaces. The metallic lustre of the feathers of many birds, such as the [[Hummingbird|humming birds]], is due to the presence of excessively fine striae upon the surface of the feathers.&lt;ref name=Beddard&gt;{{cite book | title=Animal Coloration: an account of the principal facts and theories relating to the colours and markings of animals | authorlink=Frank Evers Beddard | year=1892 | last=Beddard | first=Frank Evers | publisher=Swan Sonnenschein |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5K-nT8GIn5AC | isbn=978-0-543-91406-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}}}

But Beddard then largely dismissed structural coloration, firstly as subservient to pigments: "in every case the [structural] colour needs for its display a background of dark pigment;"&lt;ref name=Beddard /&gt;{{rp|2}} and then by asserting its rarity: "By far the commonest source of colour in invertebrate animals is the presence in the skin of definite pigments",&lt;ref name=Beddard /&gt;{{rp|2}} though he does later admit that the [[Cape golden mole]] has "structural peculiarities" in its hair that "give rise to brilliant colours".&lt;ref name=Beddard /&gt;{{rp|32}}

== Principles ==

=== Structure not pigment ===
[[File:Thin film interference.svg|thumb|When light falls on a [[thin-film optics|thin film]], the waves reflected from the upper and lower surfaces travel different distances depending on the angle, so they [[Interference (optics)|interfere]].]]

{{further|Feather}}

Structural coloration is caused by interference effects rather than by pigments. [[Colour]]s are produced when a material is scored with fine parallel lines, formed of one or more parallel [[thin-film optics|thin layers]], or otherwise composed of microstructures on the scale of the colour's [[wavelength]].&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0030399205001246 | title=Structural colour in animals—simple to complex optics | author=Parker, A.R., Martini, N. | journal=Optics &amp; Laser Technology |date=June–September 2006 | volume=38 | issue=4–6 | pages=315–322 | doi=10.1016/j.optlastec.2005.06.037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Principle of iridescence ===
{{further|thin-film interference|iridescence}}
[[File:Bruchfläche eines Perlmuttstücks.JPG|thumb|left|[[Electron microscope|Electron micrograph]] of a fractured surface of [[nacre]] showing multiple thin layers]]

Iridescence, as explained by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] in 1803, is created when extremely [[thin film]]s reflect part of the light falling on them from their top surfaces. The rest of the light goes through the films, and a further part of it is reflected from their bottom surfaces. The two sets of reflected waves travel back upwards in the same direction. But since the bottom-reflected waves travelled a little further – controlled by the thickness and [[refractive index]] of the film, and the angle at which the light fell – the two sets of waves are [[Phase (waves)|out of phase]]. When the waves are one or more whole wavelength apart – in other words at certain specific angles, they add (interfere constructively), giving a strong reflection. At other angles and phase differences, they can subtract, giving weak reflections. The thin film therefore selectively reflects just one wavelength – a pure colour – at any given angle, but other wavelengths – different colours – at different angles. So, as a thin-film structure like a butterfly's wing or bird's feather moves, it seems to change colour.&lt;ref name=ExeterIridescence /&gt;

== Mechanisms ==

=== Fixed structures ===
[[File:Butterfly magnification series collage.jpg|thumb|Butterfly wing at different magnifications reveals microstructured chitin acting as a [[diffraction grating]]]]

A number of fixed structures can create structural colours, by mechanisms including diffraction gratings, selective mirrors, photonic crystals, crystal fibres and deformed matrices. Structures can be far more elaborate than a single thin film: films can be stacked up to give strong iridescence, to combine two colours, or to balance out the inevitable change of colour with angle to give a more diffuse, less iridescent effect.&lt;ref name=Ball /&gt; Each mechanism offers a specific solution to the problem of creating a bright colour or combination of colours visible from different directions.

[[File:Morpho butterfly scale christmas tree multilayer structures drawing from electron micrograph.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|Drawing of 'firtree' micro-structures in ''[[Morpho]]'' butterfly wing scale]]
A '''[[diffraction grating]]''' constructed of layers of [[chitin]] and air gives rise to the iridescent colours of various butterfly wing scales as well as to the tail feathers of birds such as the peacock. Hooke and Newton were correct in their claim that the peacock's colours are created by interference, but the structures responsible, being close to the wavelength of light in scale (see micrographs), were smaller than the striated structures they could see with their [[light microscope]]s. Another way to produce a diffraction grating is with tree-shaped arrays of chitin, as in the wing scales of some of the brilliantly coloured tropical ''[[Morpho]]'' butterflies (see drawing). Yet another variant exists in ''Parotia lawesii'', [[Lawes's parotia]], a bird of paradise. The barbules of the feathers of its brightly coloured breast patch are V-shaped, creating thin-film microstructures that strongly reflect two different colours, bright blue-green and orange-yellow. When the bird moves the colour switches sharply between these two colours, rather than drifting iridescently. During courtship, the male bird systematically makes small movements to attract females, so the structures must have evolved through [[sexual selection]].&lt;ref name=Ball /&gt;&lt;ref name="DoekeleBirdofParadise"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Dramatic colour changes in a bird of paradise caused by uniquely structured breast feather barbules | url=http://cbn.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/root/2011/ProcRSocBStavenga/2011ProcRSocBStavenga.pdf | author=Stavenga, Doekele G. | journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] | year=2010 | volume=278 | pages=2098–2104 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2010.2293 | last2=Leertouwer | first2=H.

'''Thin film with diffuse reflector''', based on the top two layers of a buttercup's petals.

=== Variable structures ===

[[File:Variable ring patterns on mantles of the blue-ringed octopus Hapalochlaena lunulata.png|thumb|left|400px|Variable ring patterns on mantles of ''Hapalochlaena lunulata'']]

Some animals including [[cephalopods]] like squid are able to vary their colours rapidly for both [[camouflage]] and signalling. The mechanisms include reversible [[proteins]] which can be switched between two configurations. The configuration of [[reflectin]] proteins in [[chromatophore]] cells in the skin of the ''[[Doryteuthis pealeii]]'' squid is controlled by electric charge. When charge is absent, the proteins stack together tightly, forming a thin, more reflective layer; when charge is present, the molecules stack more loosely, forming a thicker layer. Since chromatophores contain multiple reflectin layers, the switch changes the layer spacing and hence the colour of light that is reflected.&lt;ref name=Ball /&gt;

Blue-ringed octopuses spend much of their time hiding in crevices whilst displaying effective camouflage patterns with their dermal [[chromatophore]] cells.  If they are provoked, they quickly change colour, becoming bright yellow with each of the 50-60 rings flashing bright iridescent blue within a third of a second.  In the [[greater blue-ringed octopus]] (''Hapalochlaena lunulata''), the rings contain multi-layer [[Chromatophore#Iridophores and leucophores|iridophore]]s.  These are arranged to reflect blue–green light in a wide viewing direction. The fast flashes of the blue rings are achieved using muscles under neural control. Under normal circumstances, each ring is hidden by contraction of muscles above the iridophores. When these relax and muscles outside the ring contract, the bright blue rings are exposed.&lt;ref name="Mathger2012"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mäthger, L.M., Bell, G.R., Kuzirian, A.M., Allen, J.J. and Hanlon, R.T. |year=2012 |title=How does the blue-ringed octopus (Hapalochlaena lunulata) flash its blue rings? |journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=215 |issue=21 |pages=3752–3757 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/21/3752.full |doi=10.1242/jeb.076869 |pmid=23053367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sughra Rababi''' (1922 – 1994) was an artist from Pakistan. As a young female artist in the 1940s, she was the first woman to win the All India Painting Competition Award. A versatile painter, designer and sculptor - Rababi was truly a woman far ahead of her times.

Rababi donated most of the proceeds from sales of her art to support humanitarian causes. In recognition and memory of her artistic and charitable contributions, [[UNICEF]] created a Sughra Rababi Fund and the Mayor of San Francisco declared 19 January 1994, as Sughra Rababi Day in San Francisco.

Rababi, an accomplished Pakistani painter, did her graduate studies at the Saranagati School of Art in Karachi and her post-graduate studies at the Shantiniketan Fine Arts University in Bengal, India. Her art career spanned more than five decades and she exhibited her works in solo and group exhibitions throughout her life. Her last solo exhibition was held in 1992 in San Francisco, California. Rababi’s art was original and her style, versatile and truly her own. 
She was a prolific artist and created  landscapes, figurative and calligraphic paintings and used tempera, oil and acrylic as her mediums. Rababi was also a designer and a sculptor.

{{about|the archaeological find|the artwork|Sutton Hoo Helmet (sculpture)}}
The '''Sutton Hoo helmet''' is a decorated [[Anglo-Saxon]] helmet which was discovered during the 1939 excavation of the [[Sutton Hoo]] [[ship burial|ship-burial]]. It was buried around 625 and is widely believed to have been the helmet of King [[Rædwald of East Anglia]], and its elaborate decoration may have given it a secondary function akin to a crown. The helmet is "the most iconic object" from "one of the most spectacular archaeological discoveries ever made," and one of the most important Anglo-Saxon artefacts ever found.{{sfn|Google Arts &amp; Culture}}{{sfn|Davis|2013}} Its visage features eyebrows, nose, and moustache, creating the image of a man joined by a dragon's head to become a soaring dragon with outstretched wings. It has become a symbol of the Dark Ages and also "of Archaeology in general."{{sfn|Richards|1992|p=131}} It was excavated as hundreds of rusted fragments, and was first displayed following an initial reconstruction in 1945–46, and then in its present form after a second reconstruction in 1970–71.

The helmet and the other finds from Sutton Hoo were determined by a [[treasure trove]] inquest to be the property of [[Edith Pretty]], who owned the site of the ship-burial. She donated all the objects to the [[British Museum]], where they were conserved and put on display. The helmet was on view in Room 41 in 2018.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=xxxvii}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=718–731}}{{sfn|British Museum a}}

The helmet was buried among other regalia and instruments of power as part of a furnished ship-burial, probably dating from the early seventh century. Although the man in the grave has not been identified, the contents of the grave point to its being that of a king.{{sfn|Ruffin|2006|p=43}} It is generally thought most likely that Rædwald, the ruler of the East Angles, is the person buried in the ship, due to the proximity of the royal [[vill]] of Rendlesham{{sfn|Ruffin|2006|p=43}} and as use of the site is believed to have been a time when he held power in England.

The ship had been hauled from the nearby river up the hill and lowered into a prepared trench.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=176–180}}{{sfn|Evans|1986|pp=32–40}} Inside this, the helmet was wrapped in cloths and placed to the left of the head of the body.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=138–231}}{{sfn|Evans|1986|pp=46–49}} An oval mound was constructed around the ship.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=144, 156}} Long afterwards, the chamber roof collapsed violently under the weight of the mound, compressing the ship's contents into a seam of earth.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=488–577}}

It is thought that the helmet was shattered either by the collapse of the burial chamber or by the force of another object falling on it.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=138}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=198}} The fact that the helmet had shattered meant that it was possible to reconstruct it. Had the helmet been crushed before the iron had fully oxidised, leaving it still pliant, the helmet would have been squashed,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=198}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=120}} leaving it in a distorted shape similar to the [[Vendel]]{{sfn|Lindqvist|1950|pp=3–4, 24}} and [[Valsgärde]]{{sfn|Arwidsson|1942|pp=30–31}} helmets.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=138 n.2}}

The Sutton Hoo helmet, weighing an estimated {{convert|2.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}},{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=185}} was made of iron and covered with decorated sheets of tinned bronze.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=137}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=140}} Fluted strips of moulding divided the exterior into panels, each of which was stamped with one of five designs.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=138}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=140}} Two depict figural scenes, another two zoophormic interlaced patterns; a fifth pattern, known only from seven small fragments and incapable of restoration, is only known to occur once on an otherwise symmetrical helmet and may have been used to replace a damaged panel.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|pp=137–140, 143}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=146–150, 186–202}} The existence of these five designs has been generally understood since the first reconstruction, published in 1947.{{sfn|Maryon|1947}}{{refn|group=note|With that said, the evidence for the unidentified design has changed over time, from one piece which later turned out to be part of design 2, to the seven pieces recognised today. Maryon suggested an unidentified design because of a single piece showing "a solitary leg, from knee to foot, about {{convert|1/2|in|mm|disp=sqbr}} high."{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=139}} Williams's reconstruction moved this piece "from the bottom edge of the cap at the rear up to a position against the crest at top centre," where it was revealed to be a part of the second design after all.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=128}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=207}} The existence of an unidentified pattern was thus putatively eliminated when Bruce-Mitford claimed in his 1972 article on the new reconstruction that there were only four designs.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=121}} Even in the first volume of ''The Sutton Hoo Ship-Burial'', published in 1975, he referred to the unidentified scene in the past tense, stating that "at the time of the re-excavation [1965] it was believed that there was a third figural scene on the helmet."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=232}} Indications of a third scene did not return until volume two of the same work, published in 1978, where seven small fragments were discussed as being incapable of placement within the four known designs.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=197–199}}}} The succeeding three decades gave rise to an increased understanding of the designs and their parallels in contemporary imagery, allowing possible reconstructions of the full panels to be advanced, and through the second reconstruction their locations on the surface of the helmet to be redetermined.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=146–150, 186–202}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1949|p=47–50}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|pp=121–122, 128–130}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|pp=199–200, 207–208}} As referred to below, the designs are numbered according to [[Rupert Bruce-Mitford]]'s 1978 work.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=146–150, 186–202}}

=== Construction ===
The core of the helmet was constructed of iron and consisted of a cap from which hung a face mask and cheek and neck guards.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=137}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=140–146}} The cap was "beaten up out of a single piece of metal."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=152, 203}}{{refn|group=note|There is nothing to suggest that the cap was made from more than one piece of metal, although "the extreme deterioration of the fragments has not allowed this to be confirmed beyond doubt."{{sfn|Hood|Ager|Williams|Harrington|2012|p=95 n.4}} Radiographs show no "welded, forged or riveted join," while the "joining of certain fragments at the crown of the helmet demonstrates that the iron sheeting of the cap ran continuously through under the crest."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=152}} Based on this evidence it seems likely that the cap was made from a single piece of metal.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=152}}}} On either side of it were hung iron cheek guards,{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=140}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=171}} deep enough to "completely protect the side of the face"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=204}} and curved inward "both longitudinally and laterally."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=172}} Two hinges per side, possibly made of leather, supported these pieces,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=171–172}} allowing them to be pulled flush with the face mask and "completely enclose" the face.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=204}} A neck guard was attached to the back of the cap and made of two overlapping pieces: a shorter piece set inside the cap, over which attached a "broad fan-like portion" extending downwards, "straight from top to bottom but curved laterally to follow the line of the neck."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=174}} The inset portion afforded the neck guard extra movement, and like the cheek guards was attached to the cap by leather hinges.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=174}} Finally, the face mask was riveted to the cap on both sides and above the nose.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=163–164}} Two cutouts served as eye openings,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=163}} while a third opened into the hollow of the overlaid nose, thereby facilitating access to the two nostril-like holes underneath; though small, these holes would have been among the few sources of fresh air for the wearer.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=167}}

Atop the foundational layer of iron were placed decorative sheets of tinned bronze.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=137}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=146, 204}} These sheets, divided into five figural or zoomorphic designs,{{sfn|Maryon|1947|pp=137–140, 143}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=146–150, 186–202}} were manufactured by the ''pressblech'' process.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1949|p=47 n.194}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1982|p=220}}{{sfn|Coatsworth|Pinder|2002|pp=109–110}} Preformed dies similar to the [[Torslunda plates]]{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1968b|p=233}} were covered with thin metal which, through applied force, took up the design underneath;{{sfn|Coatsworth|Pinder|2002|pp=109–114}}{{sfn|Hawthorne|Smith|1979|pp=153–154}} identical designs could thus be "mass-produced" from the same die, allowing for their repeated use on the helmet and other objects.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1949|p=47 n.194}}{{refn|group=note|This technique is distinguished from [[Repoussé and chasing|repoussé]] work, a much more labor intensive process. Repoussé work uses small punches to raise individual details from behind a metal sheet,{{sfn|Maryon|1971|pp=113–116}}{{sfn|Coatsworth|Pinder|2002|pp=108–109}} which are then refined from the front by [[Repoussé and chasing|chasing]],{{sfn|Maryon|1971|pp=113–116}} whereas ''pressblech'' work raises a design in one operation from a single die.{{sfn|Coatsworth|Pinder|2002|pp=109–114}} Permutations of ''pressblech'' work involving multiple operations do, however, exist. The die used for design 5 on the Sutton Hoo helmet, for example, appears to have had a billeted border on only one each of its long and short sides,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=201–202}} while on the neck guard the design is seen with borders along both long sides.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=202}} "If the die was applied not one impression at a time but as seen on the face-mask, as a continuous series of impressions carefully juxtaposed, on a large sheet of foil, this could be cut in such a way as to leave the pattern with double borders down each side. It seems that this was the method used on the neck-guard."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=202}}}} Fluted strips of white alloyed moulding—possibly of tin and copper, and possibly [[swaging|swaged]]{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=138}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=111 n.1, 226–227}}—divided the designs into framed panels, held to the helmet by bronze rivets.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=138}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=146, 204}} The two strips running from front to back alongside the crest were gilded.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=150, 205, 227}}{{sfn|Williams|1992|pp=80–81}} The edges of the helmet were further protected by U-shaped brass tubing, fastened by swaged bronze clips{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=137}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=146, 227}} and themselves further holding in place the ''pressblech'' panels that shared edges with the helmet.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=146}}

A final layer of adornments added to the helmet a crest, eyebrows, nose and mouth piece, and three dragon heads. A hollow iron crest ran across the top of the cap and terminated at front and back.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=140}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=152, 203}} It was made of "D-sectioned" tubing{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=140}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=152, 203}} and consisted of two parts, an inverted "U-shaped" piece into which a "flat bottom strip" was placed.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=152}} As no traces of solder remain, the crest may have been either forged or shrunk on to the cap.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=158, 203}} From either end of the crest extended an iron tang, to each of which was riveted a gilded dragon head.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=152–155}} That on the front was made of cast bronze, while the one on the rear was made of "a different alloy, and now consists largely of tin oxide."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=159}} A third dragon head, also of cast bronze, faced upwards on the front of the helmet and broke the plane between face mask and cap;{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=205}} its neck rested on the face mask, while under its eyes it was held to the cap by "a massive rivet shank."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=161}} To either side of the neck projected a hollow cast bronze eyebrow, into each of which was inlaid parallel silver wires.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=141}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=122}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=200}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=168–169}} Terminal boar heads were gilded, as were the undersides of the eyebrows,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=169, 228–230}} where individual bronze cells held square garnets.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|pp=141–142}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=122}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=200}} The eyebrows were riveted on, both to the cap at their outer ends and to the tang of a nose and mouth piece which extended upwards underneath the neck of the dragon head.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=163–164, 168–169}} This tang was itself riveted to the cap,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=164}} one of five attachment points for the cast bronze{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=142}} nose and mouth piece.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=164–167}} Both sides of the nose featured "two small round projecting plates,"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=165}} connected by fluted and swaged strips, and concealing rivets.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=165–167}} An inlaid strip of wire extended the length of the nasal ridge, next to which the "background was punched down" and filled with [[niello]] or another metallic inlay,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=231}} leaving "triangles in relief" that were silvered.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=142}} A tracer (a "rather blunt chisel . . . used chiefly for outlining"{{sfn|Maryon|1971|p=120}}) was used to provide a grooved border on each side.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=142}} Running horizontally aside the nasal bridge were three punched circles per side, inlaid with silver and possibly surrounded by niello.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=142}} Beneath these circles, also running horizontally from the center of the nose to its sides were [[Repoussé and chasing|chased]]{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=142}} "alternate rows of plain flutings and billeted strips which run obliquely between the central strip and a billeted lower edge."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=167}} This same pattern is repeated in vertical fashion on the moustache.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=142}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=167–168}} The curve along the bevelled lower lip, in turn, repeats the circled pattern used on the nasal bridge.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|pp=142–143}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=168}} Excepting the portions covered by the eyebrows and dragon head,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=163}} or adorned with silver or niello,{{refn|group=note|Maryon states that niello was used to separate the inlaid silver wires of the eyebrows, to fill in the punched-down designs on the nasal ridge, and to surround the punched circles on the nasal bridge and lower lip.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|pp=141–143}} Oddy, however, does not identify the helmet among the objects in the Sutton Hoo burial that exhibit the use of niello—the shield, the large hanging bowl, the great gold buckle, and the drinking horns.{{sfn|Oddy|1980|pp=182–183}}{{sfn|Oddy|2004|pp=275–276}} With regards to the suggestion of niello on the nose, Oddy states that "[t]he metal of which these inlays are made is compact and is not corroded. In view of its condition it must be interpreted as a metallic inlay and not as niello which has subsequently been reduced to silver metal."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=231}}}} the nose and mouth piece was heavily gilded,{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=142}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=167–168}} which is suggested by the presence of mercury to have been done with the [[Gilding#Fire-gilding|fire-gilding]] method.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=231}}

Breaking the symmetry of the helmet are subtle differences in the two eyebrows, and in the methods employed to fashion the [[cloisonné]] garnets. The dexter and sinister eyebrows, though at first glance identical, may have been "manufactured in different ways while being intended to look essentially the same."{{sfn|Price|Mortimer|2014|p=521}} The dexter brow is approximately 5 millimeters shorter than the sinister, and contained 43 rather than 46 inlaid silver wires and one or two fewer garnets.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=169}}{{refn|group=note|Bruce-Mitford suggests there were 23 garnets in the dexter eyebrow and 25 in the sinister,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=169}} but a technical report appending the chapter posits 21 and 22 respectively.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=229–230}}}} Gilding on the dexter eyebrow was "reddish in colour" against the "yellowish" hue of the sinister,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=229}} while the latter contains both trace amounts of mercury and a tin corrosion product which are absent from its counterpart. Moreover, while the individual bronze cells into which the garnets are set, both on the dexter brow and on three of the four remaining dragon eyes, are underlain by small pieces of "hatched gold foil,"{{sfn|Maryon|1947|pp=141–142}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=169}} those on the sinister side, and the sinister eye of the upper dragon head, have no such backing.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=160, 169}} The gold backing served to reflect light back through the garnets, increasing their lustre and deepening their colour.{{sfn|Coatsworth|Pinder|2002|pp=141–142}} Where this backing was missing on the sinister eyebrow and one dragon eye, the luminosity of the garnets would be "substantially dimmed" by direct placement against the bronze.{{sfn|Price|Mortimer|2014|p=520}}

=== Dragon motifs ===
[[File:Sutton Hoo helmet - winged dragon motif.png|thumb|alt=Black and white line drawing of the winged dragon motif from the front of the helmet, composed of four fragments: a dragon head, the two eyebrows forming the wings, and the nose and moustache piece forming the body and tail respectively.|The winged dragon motif from the front of the helmet, with eyebrows for wings and the nose and mouth piece for body and tail]]
Three dragon heads are represented on the helmet. Two bronze-gilt dragon heads feature on either end of the iron crest running from the front to the rear of the skull cap.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=152}} The third sits at the junction between the two eyebrows, facing upward and given fuller form by the eyebrows, nose and moustache to create the impression of a dragon in flight.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=169}} There it soars upwards in the "central and most dramatic feature of the entire helmet," baring its teeth at the "snake-like dragon" flying down the crest.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=86}}

To the extent that the helmet is jewelled, such decoration is largely confined to the elements associated with the dragons.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=204–205}} Convex garnets sunk into the heads give the dragons red eyes.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=141}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=160, 205}} The eyebrows are likewise inlaid with square garnets on their under edges, continuing outwards on each side to where they terminate in gilded boars' heads;{{sfn|Maryon|1947|pp=141–142}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=122}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=200}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=169, 204–205}} in addition to their secondary decorative function as wings, the eyebrows may therefore take on a tertiary form as boars' bodies.{{sfn|Newton|1993|p=37}} The subtle differences between the eyebrows, the sinister of which lacks the gold foil backing employed on the dexter, may suggest an allusion to the one-eyed god [[Odin]];{{sfn|Price|Mortimer|2014|p=532}} seen in low light, with the garnets of only one eye reflecting light, the helmet may have itself seemed to have only one eye.{{sfn|Price|Mortimer|2014|p=522}}{{refn|group=note|An alternative theory suggests that the discrepancy between eyebrows is the result of a repair job.{{sfn|Marzinzik|2007|pp=29–30}} "That the absence of foils might result from a repair," however, "and presumably therefore a shortage of gold, seems unlikely in view of the minute quantities needed. Additionally, given the evident skill required to shape the gold cell walls and cut the garnets so precisely, the decision to omit the gold foils on the left eyebrow appears all the more deliberate."{{sfn|Price|Mortimer|2014|p=521}} The repair theory also fails to account for the absence of gold foil behind one of the garnet dragon eyes.{{sfn|Price|Mortimer|2014|p=521}} On the other hand, a repair could explain the other subtle differences between the eyebrows, such as their slightly different lengths and colours, which are not addressed by the theorized allusion to Odin.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=239}}}}

More gold covers the eyebrows, nose and mouth piece, and dragon heads, as it does the two fluted strips that flank the crest.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=205}} The crest and eyebrows are further inlaid with silver wires.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|pp=140, 144}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|pp=122, 124}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|pp=200, 204}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=155, 158, 169, 205}} Combined with the silvery colour of the tinned bronze, the effect was "an object of burnished silvery metal, set in a trelliswork of gold, surmounted by a crest of massive silver, and embellished with gilded ornaments, garnets and niello{{mdash}}in its way a magnificent thing and one of the outstanding masterpieces of barbaric art."{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=144}}

=== Design 1: Dancing warriors ===

The dancing warriors scene is known from six fragments and occurs four times on the helmet.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=186–189}} It is seen on the two panels immediately above the eyebrows, accounting for five of the fragments. The sixth fragment is placed in the middle row of the [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]] cheek guard, on the panel closest to the face mask;{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=186–189}}{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=80}} the generally symmetrical nature of the helmet implies the design's position on the opposite side as well.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=128}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=207}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=172–173}} None of the six pieces show both warriors, although the "key fragment" depicts their crossed wrists.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1949|p=50}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=187}} A full reconstruction of the scene was inferred after the first reconstruction, when Rupert Bruce-Mitford spent six weeks in Sweden and was shown a nearly identical design on the then unpublished [[Valsgärde]] 7 helmet.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=139}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1948a|p=6}}{{sfn|Archaeological News Letter|1948}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1949|pp=49–50}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1950a|p=449}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=186}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1989a}}

Design 1 pictures two men "in civilian or ceremonial dress"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=187}} perhaps engaged in a spear or sword dance{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=188}}{{sfn|Holmqvist|1960|pp=103, 109}} "associated with the cult of Odin, the war-god."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=129}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=208}} Their outer hands each hold two spears, pointed towards their feet,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1949|p=50}} while their crossed hands grip swords.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=139}} The depiction suggests "intricate measures," "rhythm," and an "elasticity of . . . dance steps."{{sfn|Holmqvist|1960|p=109}} Their trailing outer legs and curved hips imply movement towards each other,{{sfn|Holmqvist|1960|pp=121–122}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=189}} and they may be in the climax of the dance.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=189}} The prevalence of dance scenes with a "similarity of the presentation of the scheme of movement" in contemporary Scandinavian and Northern art suggests that ritual dances "were well-known phenomena."{{sfn|Holmqvist|1960|pp=104–106}} Sword dances in particular were recorded among the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] as early as the first century AD, when [[Tacitus]] wrote of "[n]aked youths who practice the sport bound in the dance amid swords and lances," a "spectacle" which was "always performed at every gathering."{{sfn|Tacitus|1868|p=17}}{{sfn|Tacitus|1886|p=14}}{{sfn|Holmqvist|1960|p=109}} Whatever the meaning conveyed by the Sutton Hoo example, the "ritual dance was evidently no freak of fashion confined to a particular epoch, but was practised for centuries in a more or less unchanged form."{{sfn|Holmqvist|1960|p=122}}

While many contemporary designs portray ritual dances,{{sfn|Holmqvist|1960}} at least three examples show scenes exceptionally similar to that on the Sutton Hoo helmet and contribute to the understanding of the depicted sword dance. The same design—identical but for a different type of spears held in hand,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=189 n.3}} a different pattern of dress,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1949|p=49}} and a lack of crossed spears behind the two men{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=188}}—is found on the Valsgärde 7 helmet, while a small fragment of stamped foil from the [[Gamla Uppsala#The eastern mound|eastern mound]] at [[Gamla Uppsala]] is "so close in every respect to the corresponding warrior on the Sutton Hoo helmet as to appear at first glance to be from the same die," and may even have been "cut by the same man."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=208}} The third similar design is one of the four [[Torslunda plates]],{{sfn|Nerman|1948|pp=79–81}} discovered in [[Öland]], Sweden, in 1870.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=214}} This plate, which is complete and depicts a figure with the same attributes as on design 1, suggests the association of the men in the Sutton Hoo example with "the cult of Odin."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=129}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=208}} The Torslunda figure is missing an eye, which laser scanning revealed to have been removed by a "sharp cut, probably in the original model used for the mould."{{sfn|Arrhenius|Freij|1992|p=76}} Odin too lost an eye, thus evidencing the identification of the Torslunda figure as him, and the Sutton Hoo figures as devotees of him.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=129}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=208}}{{sfn|Arrhenius|Freij|1992|p=76}}

=== Design 2: Rider and fallen warrior ===
[[File:06XX Goldscheibe mit Reiterdarstellung anagoria.JPG|thumb|alt=Colour photograph showing the gold Pliezhausen bracteate, which depicts a scene nearly identical to design 2.|The Pliezhausen bracteate shows a scene nearly identical to design 2.]]
Eight fragments represent all known instances of the second design, accounting for its placement on a like number of panels.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=190–197}} It is surmised to have originally appeared twelve times on the helmet,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=190}} although this theory assumes that the unidentified third design, which occupies one of the twelve panels, was a replacement for a damaged panel.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=199}} Assuming so, the pattern occupied eight spaces on the lowest row of the skull cap (i.e., all but the two showing design 1), and two panels, one atop the other rising towards the crest, in the centre of each side.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|pp=126–127}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|pp=202–203}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=146–149}} All panels showing design 2 appear to have been struck from the same die.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=192}} The horse and rider thus move in a clockwise direction around the helmet, facing towards the rear of the helmet on the dexter side, and towards the front on the [[Dexter and sinister|sinister]] side.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=192}}

As substantial sections of design 2 are missing, particularly from the "central area,"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=197}} reconstruction relies in part on continental versions of the same scene.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=190–193}} In particular, similar scenes are seen on the Valsgärde 7{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=192–193, 195–197}} and 8{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=193, 197}} helmets, the Vendel 1 helmet,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=199}} and on the [[Pliezhausen brooch|Pliezhausen bracteate]].{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=193–194, 196–197}} The latter piece, in particular, is both complete and nearly identical to the Sutton Hoo design.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|pp=37–39}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=193–196}} Although a mirror image, and lacking in certain details depicted in design 2 such as the sword carried by the rider and the scabbard worn by the fallen warrior,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=196}}{{sfn|Haseloff|1979|p=82}} it suggests other details such as the small shield held by the kneeling figure.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=194}}

Design 2 shows a mounted warrior, spear held overhead, trampling an enemy on the ground.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=193}} The latter leans upwards and, grasping the reins in his left hand, uses his right hand to thrust a sword into the chest of the horse.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=193}} Atop the horse's rump kneels a "diminutive human, or at least anthropomorphic figure."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=193}} The figure is stylistically similar to the horseman. Its arms and legs are positioned identically, and, together with the rider, it clutches the spear with its right hand.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=193}}

The iconographic meaning of design 2 is unknown. It may derive from Roman models,{{sfn|Arwidsson|1977|p=121}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1986|pp=198, 200}}{{sfn|Carver|2005|p=240}} which frequently depicted images of warriors trampling vanquished enemies.{{sfn|Mackintosh|1986}} The subsequent development of the design, which has been found in England, Sweden, and Germany, suggests that it carried a unique meaning broadly understood in [[Germanic mythology|Germanic tradition]].{{sfn|Haseloff|1979|p=82}} Whereas the Roman examples show riders in moments of unqualified victory,{{sfn|Mackintosh|1986|p=1}} in Germanic representations the scene is ambiguous.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=193, 197}} The symbolism is unclear,{{sfn|Haseloff|1979|p=80}}{{sfn|Beck|1964|p=6}} and elements of victory are combined with elements of defeat:{{sfn|Beck|1964|p=43}}{{sfn|Haseloff|1979|p=82}} the rider directs his spear straight forward at an invisible enemy, not down at the visible enemy on the ground; though the enemy is trampled, the rider's horse is dealt a fatal wound; and a small and possibly divine figure hovers behind the rider, its body taking the form of a victorious [[swastika]]{{refn|group=note|Assuming that this figure, which is only partly preserved on the Sutton Hoo helmet, takes the form of the like figure on the Pliezhausen bracteate.{{sfn|Haseloff|1979|pp=82–83}}}} while it seemingly guides the spear.{{sfn|Haseloff|1979|pp=82–83}} An overarching theme of the design may therefore be that of fate.{{sfn|Beck|1964|pp=42–43}}{{sfn|Haseloff|1979|p=82}} In this understanding the divine figure, possibly Odin, guides the warrior in battle, but does not completely free him from the deadly threats he faces.{{sfn|Beck|1964|pp=42–43}} The gods are themselves subject to the whims of fate, and can provide only limited help against the rider's enemies.{{sfn|Beck|1964|pp=43–44}}

=== Design 3: Unidentified figural scene ===
[[File:Sutton Hoo helmet - design 3 fragments.png|thumb|alt=Black and white line drawings of the seven fragments that do not correspond to any known design on the helmet.|The seven unidentified fragments]]
Seven small fragments suggest a third figural scene somewhere on the Sutton Hoo helmet. They are nevertheless too small and ambiguous to allow for the reconstruction of the scene.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=197–199}} Its presence is suggested "not more than four times, and perhaps only once";{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=199}} because other fragments demonstrate the occurrence of design 1{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=186–187}} or design 2{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=190–191}} on all seven available panels on the sinister side of the helmet, and on the forwardmost two panels on the dexter side (in addition to on the highest dexter panel), placement of design 3 "must have occurred towards the rear of the helmet"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=199}} on the dexter side.

That which remains of design 3 may suggest that a "variant rider scene" was employed to fix damage to a design 2 panel,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=199}} similar to how a unique ''pressblech'' design on the Valsgärde 6 helmet was likely used in repair.{{sfn|Arwidsson|1942|pp=29–31}} Fragment (a) for example shows groups of parallel raised lines running in correspondence "with changes of angle or direction in the modelled surface, which on the analogy of the Sutton Hoo and other rider scenes in Vendel art, strongly suggest the body of a horse."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=197–198}} Though smaller, fragment (d) shows similar patterns and suggests a similar interpretation.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=199}} Fragment (b), meanwhile, shows "two concentric raised lines two millimetres apart," and "appears to be a segment of the rim of a shield which would be of the same diameter as that held by the rider in design 2."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=198}}

The theory of design 3 as a replacement panel gains some support from damage towards the back of the helmet, yet is contradicted by the placement of fragment (c). The crest, complete for {{convert|25.5|cm|abbr=on}} from front to back, is missing {{convert|2|cm|abbr=on}} above the rear dragon head.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=154}} This head is itself mostly missing, and was entirely omitted from the 1945–46 reconstruction.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=125}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=205}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=159–163}} These missing portions are offered by Bruce-Mitford as a possible indication that the helmet at one time suffered damage necessitating the restoration of at least one design 2 panel with a new equestrian scene.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=224–225}} This theory does not explain why the rear crest and dragon head would not have been themselves repaired, however, and it is not helped by fragment (c). This fragment is an edge piece placed in the 1970–71 reconstruction on the dexter rear of the helmet at the bottom left of a panel where either design 2 or design 3 is expected, yet is "an isolated element quite out of context with any other surviving fragment and with what appears to be the subject matter of the design 3 panel."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=198}} Bruce-Mitford suggests that as it is an edge piece it may have originally been a scrap placed under another piece to fill a gap, for it is "otherwise inexplicable."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=198}}{{refn|group=note|Bruce-Mitford appears reluctant to even acknowledge fragment (c) as part of Design 3. Despite writing in 1978 that "[t]he fragment is mounted in the present helmet reconstruction on the right side towards the back,"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=198}} in 1982 he wrote that "none of the fragments that show portions of Design 3 are mounted in the helmet. Since we know neither what this scene depicted, nor how many times it was employed, to place such fragments in the reconstructed helmet could give a false impression both of the subject and of the position it may have occupied in the decorative layout of the helmet."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1982|p=272 n.31}} These contradictory statements would be reconciled by accepting Bruce-Mitford's theory that fragment (c) was a scrap, and not meant to be seen.}}

=== Design 4: Larger interlace ===
Occurring on the cheek guards, the neck guard and the skull cap,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=146–149}} the larger interlace pattern was capable of a complete reconstruction.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=146–150}} Unlike the two identified figural scenes, partial die impressions of design 4 were used in addition to full die impressions.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=146–150}} Blank spaces on the skull cap and neck guard, devoid of decorative designs, allowed for impressions of design 4 "that are either complete or nearly so."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=149}} On the cheek guards, by contrast, which are irregularly shaped and fully decorated, "the interlace designs are trimmed and sometimes turned on edge to fill awkward spaces."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=150}}

Design 4 depicts "a single quadruped in ribbon style."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=200}}

=== Design 5: Smaller interlace ===
The smaller interlace pattern covered the face mask, was used prominently on the neck guard, and filled in several empty spaces on the cheek guards.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=146–150}} It is a zoomorphic design, like the larger interlace, and shows "two animals, upside down and reversed in relation to each other, whose backward-turning heads lie towards the centre of the panel."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=201}}

The Sutton Hoo helmet was both a functional piece of battle equipment and a symbol of its owner's power and prestige. It would have offered considerable protection if ever used in battle,{{sfn|Donahue|2006|loc=13:46}} and at the same time, being the richest known Anglo-Saxon helmet, would have indicated its owner's status.{{sfn|Steuer|1987|p=200 n.32}} As it is older than the man with whom it was buried, the helmet may also have been an heirloom,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1952|pp=724–725}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=224–225}} symbolic of the ceremonies of its owner's life and death;{{sfn|Christensen|2000|pp=34–35}}{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pp=43–44}}{{sfn|MacGregor|2011|p=304}} it may further be a progenitor of [[Crown (headgear)|crowns]], known in Europe since around the twelfth century,{{sfn|Almgren|1983|pp=12–13}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1167–1169}} indicating both a leader's right to rule and his connection with the gods.{{sfn|Price|Mortimer|2014|pp=521–522, 533–534}}

Whether or not the helmet was ever worn in battle is unknown, but though delicately ornamented, it would have done the job well.{{sfn|Donahue|2006|loc=13:46}} Other than leaving spaces to allow movement of the shoulders and arms, the helmet leaves its wearer's head entirely protected,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=125}} and unlike any other known helmet of its general type, it has a face mask, one-piece cap, and solid neck guard.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=214}} The iron and silver crest would have helped deflect the force of falling blows,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1952|pp=707, 752 n.21}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=210}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=158}} and holes underneath the nose would have created a breathable—if stifling{{sfn|Donahue|2006|loc=13:59}}—environment within.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=157}} If two suppositions are to be taken as true—that damage to the back of the helmet occurred before the burial,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=199, 224–225}} and that Raedwald is properly identified as the helmet's owner—then the helmet can be at least described as one that saw some degree of use during its lifetime, and that was owned by a person who saw battle;{{sfn|Donahue|2006|loc=13:32}} according to [[Bede]], around 616 Raedwald defeated [[Æthelfrith]] of [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]] in the Battle of the [[River Idle]].{{sfn|Keynes|1992|p=104}}

Beyond its functional purpose, the Sutton Hoo helmet would have served to convey the high status of its owner. Little more than an iron cap, such as the helmets from [[Shorwell helmet|Shorwell]] and [[Pioneer Helmet|Wollaston]],{{sfn|Hood|Ager|Williams|Harrington|2012|p=93}}{{sfn|Meadows|2004|p=25}}{{sfn|Read|2006|p=39}} would be needed if one only sought to protect one's head.{{sfn|Christensen|2000|p=34}}{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=43}} Yet helmets were also objects of prestige in Anglo-Saxon England, as indicated by archaeological, literary, and historical evidence.{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1067–1070}} Helmets are relatively common in ''[[Beowulf]]'', an Anglo-Saxon poem focused on royals and their aristocratic milieu,{{sfn|Stjerna|1912|pp=1–2}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1169}}{{sfn|Cramp|1957|pp=57, 60}} but rarely found today; only six are currently known, despite the excavation of thousands of graves from the period.{{sfn|Hood|Ager|Williams|Harrington|2012|pp=93, 93 n.8}}{{sfn|Butterworth|Fregni|Fuller|Greaves|2016|p=41 n.27}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1167}} Much as this could also be reflective of poor rates of artefact survival, or even recognition—the Shorwell helmet was at first misidentified as a "fragmentary iron vessel",{{sfn|Hood|Ager|Williams|Harrington|2012|pp=83–84}} the Wollaston helmet as a bucket,{{sfn|Read|2006|p=38}} and a plain [[Roman Britain|Roman]] helmet from [[Burgh Castle]] as "cauldron fragments"{{sfn|Johnson|1980|p=303}}—the extreme scarcity suggests that helmets were never deposited in great numbers, and signified the importance of those wearing them.{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1167}}

That the Sutton Hoo helmet was likely around 100 years old when buried suggests that it may also have been an heirloom, a sample from the royal treasury passed down from another generation.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1952|pp=724–725}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=224–225}}{{sfn|Donahue|2006|loc=13:22}} The same suggestion has been made for the shield from the burial, as both it and the helmet are objects with distinct Swedish influence.{{sfn|Lindqvist|1948b|p=137}}{{sfn|Lindqvist|1948a|p=105}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1949|p=74}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1950b|p=71}} The importance of heirloom items is well documented in poetry;{{sfn|Whitelock|1958|p=91}} every sword of note in ''Beowulf'', from [[Hrunting]] to [[Nægling]], has such a history,{{sfn|Brady|1979|p=91}} and the poem's hero, whose own pyre is stacked with helmets,{{sfn|Stjerna|1912|p=1}} uses his dying words to bestow upon his follower [[Wiglaf]] a gold collar, [[Mail (armour)|byrnie]], and gilded helmet.{{sfn|Christensen|2000|p=35}}{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=44}} The passing of the helmet, from warrior to warrior and then to the ground, would have been symbolic of the larger ceremony of the passing of titles and power,{{sfn|Christensen|2000|pp=34–35}}{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pp=43–44}} and the final elegy for the man buried in the mound.{{sfn|MacGregor|2011|p=304}}

The helmet easily outstrips all other known examples in terms of richness.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=210–214}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1170}}{{sfn|Steuer|1987|p=200 n.32}} It is uniquely from a presumed royal burial,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=210–214}} at a time when the monarchy was defined by the helmet and the sword.{{sfn|Alföldi|1934|p=140}}{{sfn|Donahue|2006|loc=12:31}} Helmets, perhaps because they were worn by rulers so frequently, may have come to be identified as crowns.{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1167}}{{sfn|Almgren|1983|p=12}} Though many intermediate stages in the typological and functional evolution are yet unknown,{{sfn|Ambrosiani|1983|p=25}} the earliest European crowns that survive, such as the turn-of-the-millennium [[Holy Crown of Hungary|crown of Saint Stephen]] and of [[Constance of Aragon]], share the same basic construction of many helmets, including the [[Coppergate Helmet|Coppergate example]], contemporaneous with the one from Sutton Hoo: a brow band, a nose-to-nape band, and lateral bands.{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1167–1169}} A divine right to rule, or at least a connection between gods and leader—also seen on earlier Roman helmets, which sometimes represented [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman gods]]{{sfn|Gamber|1966|p=285}}—may also have been implied by the alteration to the sinister eyebrow on the Sutton Hoo helmet; the one-eyed appearance could only have been visible in low light, such as when its wearer was in a hall, the seat of the king's power.{{sfn|Price|Mortimer|2014|pp=521–522, 533–534}}

== Context and parallels ==
Unique in many respects, the Sutton Hoo helmet is nevertheless inextricably linked to its Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian contexts. It is one of only six known Anglo-Saxon helmets, along with those found at [[Benty Grange helmet|Benty Grange]], [[Coppergate Helmet|Coppergate]], [[Pioneer Helmet|Wollaston]], [[Shorwell helmet|Shorwell]] and [[Staffordshire helmet|Staffordshire]],{{sfn|Butterworth|Fregni|Fuller|Greaves|2016|p=41 n.27}} yet is closer in character to those from [[Vendel]] and [[Valsgärde]].{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=225}} At the same time, the helmet shares "consistent and intimate" parallels with those characterised in the Anglo-Saxon epic ''[[Beowulf]]'',{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=224}} and, like the Sutton Hoo ship-burial as a whole,{{sfn|Frank|1992|p=47}} has had a profound impact on modern understandings of the poem.{{sfn|Frank|1992|pp=54–55}}

=== Helmets ===
Within the corpus of sixth and seventh century helmets, the Sutton Hoo helmet is broadly classified as a "crested helmet,"{{sfn|Steuer|1987|pp=199–203, 230–231}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1086}} distinct from the continental [[spangenhelm]]{{sfn|Steuer|1987|pp=190–197, 227–229}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1082–1084, 1087}} and [[lamellenhelm]].{{sfn|Steuer|1987|pp=197–198, 229–230}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1082–1083, 1085}} 50 helmets are so classified,{{sfn|Steuer|1987|pp=199–203, 230–231}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1083, 1086}}{{refn|group=note|This number consolidates the work of multiple scholars. [[Heiko Steuer|Steuer]] numbers the helmets from 1 through 30,{{sfn|Steuer|1987|pp=230–231}} although he groups the five Vendel examples—three whole, two fragmentary—as #13, and the four Valsgärde examples as #15.{{sfn|Steuer|1987|p=231}} His list thus truly encompasses 37 helmets. Tweddle adds six to Steuer's list{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1083}}—a seventh turned out not to be the tenth-century helmet that he suggested, but rather a [[World War II]] [[SSK 90 helmet|SSK 90]] ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' helmet manufactured by [[Siemens]]{{sfn|Strong|2002}}{{sfn|Nederlandse Munten}}—but makes no mention of the fact that Steuer grouped nine helmets into two spots on his list. Tweddle's addition therefore makes 44 (37+6)—not the 37 (30+7) that he claimed.{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1083}} To these may be added the subsequent discoveries from [[Wollaston, Northamptonshire|Wollaston]], [[Staffordshire]], [[Horncastle helmet fragment|Horncastle]], [[Uppåkra]], Inhåleskullen, and [[Gevninge helmet fragment|Gevninge]], along with the [[Guilden Morden boar|boar from Guilden Morden]], for a total of 50 known crested helmets.}} although barely more than a dozen can be reconstructed{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1090}} and a few are so degraded that they are not indisputably from helmets.{{sfn|Steuer|1987|p=231}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1086}} Excepting an outlier fragment found in [[Kiev]];{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1083, 1086, 1125}} all crested helmets originate from England or Scandinavia.{{sfn|Steuer|1987|pp=199–200}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1086–1087}}

Of the crested helmets the Sutton Hoo helmet belongs to the Vendel and Valsgärde class, which themselves derive from the Roman infantry and cavalry [[Late Roman ridge helmet|helmets]] of the fourth and fifth century [[Constantine the Great|Constantinian]] workshops.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=223}} Helmets were found in graves 1, 12 and 14 at Vendel (in addition to partial helmets in graves 10 and 11), and in graves 5, 6, 7 and 8 at Valsgärde.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=208}} The Sutton Hoo example shares similarities in design, yet "is richer and of higher quality" than its Scandinavian analogues;{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=210}} its differences may reflect its manufacture for someone of higher social status, or its closer temporal proximity to the antecedent Roman helmets.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=212–214}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Although the Staffordshire helmet, currently undergoing research and reconstruction, may prove to be more closely related, the four other known Anglo-Saxon helmets share only minor details in decoration and few similarities in construction with the example from Sutton Hoo. In construction its cheek guards and crest link it to its Anglo-Saxon contemporaries, yet it remains the only helmet to have a face mask, fixed neck guard, or cap raised from a single piece of metal. Decoratively it is linked by its elaborate eyebrows, boar motifs, and wire inlays, but is unparalleled in its extensive ornamentation and ''pressblech'' patterns. The similarities likely reflect "a set of traditional decorative motifs which are more or less stable over a long period of time";{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1095}} the differences may simply highlight the disparity between royal and patrician helmets, or may indicate that the Sutton Hoo helmet was more a product of its Roman progenitors than its Anglo-Saxon counterparts.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=212–214}}

The primary structural similarity between the Sutton Hoo and other Anglo-Saxon helmets lies in the presence of cheek guards, a feature shared by the Coppergate, Wollaston and Staffordshire helmets,{{sfn|Tweddle|1984|p=20}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=989, 1094}}{{sfn|Read|2006|p=38}}{{sfn|Butterworth|Fregni|Fuller|Greaves|2016|pp=32, 41}} yet generally missing from their Scandinavian counterparts.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=214}} The construction of the Sutton Hoo helmet is otherwise largely distinguished from all other Anglo-Saxon examples. Its cap is unique in having been raised from a single piece of iron.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=152, 203, 214}} The caps of the other helmets were each composed of at least eight pieces. On the iron Coppergate, Shorwell and Wollaston helmets, a brow band was joined by a nose-to-nape band, two lateral bands, and four infill plates,{{sfn|Tweddle|1984|pp=13, 15}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=941, 946}}{{sfn|Hood|Ager|Williams|Harrington|2012|pp=83, 85}}{{sfn|Meadows|2004|pp=9–10}}{{sfn|Read|2006|p=38}} while the Benty Grange helmet was constructed from both iron and horn.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|pp=231–232}}{{sfn|Lester|1987|p=34}} A brow band was joined both by nose-to-nape and ear-to-ear bands and by four strips subdividing the resultant quadrants into eighths.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|pp=230–231}} Eight pieces of horn infilled the eight open spaces, with the eight joins each covered by an additional strip of horn.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|pp=231–232}} The Sutton Hoo helmet is also the only known Anglo-Saxon helmet to have either a face mark or a fixed neck guard;{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=214}} the Coppergate and Benty Grange helmets, the only others to have any surviving form of neck protection,{{refn|group=note|The Wollaston helmet, which was designed similarly to the Coppergate helmet,{{sfn|Meadows|1996–97|pp=192–193}}{{sfn|Meadows|2004|p=25}}{{sfn|Read|2006|p=39}} may have originally had some form of neck protection. Ploughing of the field in which it was buried, however, destroyed much of the helmet, including most of the dexter side.{{sfn|Meadows|2004|pp=2–3, 9, 25}} "The rear edge of the helmet's brow band is almost entirely lost through ploughing but the short section that did survive, when x-rayed, appeared to have part of at least 2 possible perforations on its damaged edge. The purpose of perforations in this position could only be to fix a neck guard of some type."{{sfn|Meadows|2004|p=9}} The remaining section of the rear edge of the brow band is only 26&amp;nbsp;mm long, however, rendering "[t]he purpose, and on such a small length the existence, of the perforations . . . uncertain."{{sfn|Meadows|2004|p=9}}}} used [[camail]] and horn, respectively,{{sfn|Tweddle|1984|pp=20–21}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=999–1009}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|pp=233}} and together with the Wollaston helmet protected the face by use of nose-to-nape bands elongated to form [[nasal helmet|nasal]]s.{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=946, 952}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=231}}{{sfn|Meadows|2004|p=11}}{{sfn|Read|2006|p=39}}

The decorative similarities between the Sutton Hoo helmet and its Anglo-Saxon contemporaries are peripheral, if not substantial. The helmets from Wollaston and Shorwell were designed for use rather than display;{{sfn|Meadows|2004|p=16}}{{sfn|Hood|Ager|Williams|Harrington|2012|p=93}} the latter was almost entirely utilitarian, while the former, "a sparsely decorated 'fighting helmet,'"{{sfn|Read|2006|p=39}} contained only a boar crest and sets of incised lines along its bands as decoration.{{sfn|Meadows|2004|pp=9, 16}}{{sfn|Read|2006|p=42}} Its boar crest finds parallel with that atop the Benty Grange helmet,{{sfn|Meadows|2004|p=6}} the eyes on which are made of garnets "set in gold sockets edged with filigree wire . . . and having hollow gold shanks . . . which were sunk into a hole" in the head.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=241}} Though superficially similar to the garnets and wire inlays on the Sutton Hoo helmet, the techniques employed to combine garnet, gold and filigree work are of a higher complexity more indicative of Germanic work.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=241}} A helmet sharing more distinct similarities with the Sutton Hoo example is the one from Coppergate. It features a crest and eyebrows, both hatched{{sfn|Tweddle|1984|p=15}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1094}} in a manner that may reflect "reminiscences or imitations of actual wire inlays"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1952|p=752 n.21}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=211}} akin to those on the Sutton Hoo helmet.{{sfn|Webster|1998|p=188}} The eyebrows and crests on both helmets further terminate in animal heads, though in a less intricate manner on the Coppergate helmet,{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1094–1095}} where they take a more two-dimensional form. These similarities are likely indicative of "a set of traditional decorative motifs which are more or less stable over a long period of rime," rather than of a significant relationship between the two helmets.{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1095}} Compared with the "almost austere brass against iron of the Coppergate helmet," the Sutton Hoo helmet, covered in tinned ''pressblech'' designs and further adorned with garnets, gilding, and inlaid silver wires, radiates "a rich polychromatic effect."{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1095}} Its appearance is substantially more similar to the Staffordshire helmet, which, while still undergoing conservation, has "a pair of cheek pieces cast with intricate gilded interlaced designs along with a possible gold crest and associated terminals."{{sfn|Butterworth|Fregni|Fuller|Greaves|2016|p=41}} Like the Sutton Hoo helmet it was covered in ''pressblech'' foils,{{sfn|Butterworth|Fregni|Fuller|Greaves|2016|p=31}} including a horseman and warrior motif so similar to design 3 as to have been initially taken for the same design.{{sfn|Pilkington|2012}}

Significant differences in the construction of the Sutton Hoo and Scandinavian helmets belie significant similarities in their designs. The Scandinavian helmets that are capable of restoration were constructed more simply than the Sutton Hoo helmet. None has a face mask,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=214}} solid neck guard,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=210–212}} or cap made from one piece of metal,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=214}} and only two have distinct cheek guards.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=214}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1092, 1104–1106}} The neck guards "seem without exception to have [been] either iron strips or protective mail curtains."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=212}} The helmets from Ultuna, Vendel 14 and Valsgärde 5 all used iron strips as neck protection; five strips hung from the rear of the Vendel 14{{sfn|Lindqvist|1931a|p=9}}{{sfn|Lindqvist|1932|p=31}} and Valsgärde 5{{sfn|Lindqvist|1932|pp=25–26}} brow bands,{{sfn|Gamber|1982|p=210}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1982|p=253}} and though only two strips survive from the Ultuna helmet,{{sfn|Lindqvist|1925|pp=183–184}}{{sfn|Lindqvist|1932|pp=30–31}} others would have hung alongside them.{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1111–1112}} [[Aventail|Camail]] was used on the remaining helmets, from Valsgärde 6,{{sfn|Arwidsson|1934|pp=244–245, 253–254}}{{sfn|Arwidsson|1942|pp=28–29}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=212}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1092, 1115, 1119}} 7{{sfn|Arwidsson|1934|p=254}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=215}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1092, 1115, 1119}} and 8,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=212}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1092, 1115, 1119}} and from Vendel 1{{sfn|Stolpe|Arne|1912|p=13}}{{sfn|Stolpe|Arne|1927|p=13}}{{sfn|Arwidsson|1934|pp=244–245, 253–254}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1092, 1115, 1119}} and 12.{{sfn|Stolpe|Arne|1912|p=46}}{{sfn|Stolpe|Arne|1927|pp=46–47}}{{sfn|Arwidsson|1934|p=254}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=212}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1092, 1115, 1119}} Fragmentary remains from Vendel 10{{sfn|Arwidsson|1934|p=254}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=212}} and 11,{{sfn|Arwidsson|1934|p=253}} and from Solberga,{{sfn|Arwidsson|1977|p=27}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1092, 1115, 1119}} likewise suggest camail. In terms of cheek protection, only two helmets had something other than continuations of the camail or iron strips used to protect the neck.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=214}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1092, 1104–1106}} The Vendel 14 helmet had cheek guards, but of "a differing version well forward on the face" of those on the Sutton Hoo helmet.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=214}} Though "difficult to reconstruct,"{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1105}} fragments from the Broa helmet suggest a configuration similar to those on the Vendel 14 helmet.{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1104–1106}} Finally, the widely varying caps on each Scandinavian helmet all share one feature: None is similar to the cap on the Sutton Hoo helmet.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=214}} The basic form of the helmets from Vendel, Valsgärde, Ultuna and Broa all started with a brow band and nose-to-nape band. The Ultuna helmet had its sides filled in with latticed iron strips,{{sfn|Lindqvist|1925|pp=182–183}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1111–1112, 1112}} while each side on the Valsgärde 8 helmet was filled in with six parallel strips running from the brow band to the nose-to-nape brand.{{sfn|Arwidsson|1954|pp=22–23}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1119–1121}} The remaining four helmets—excepting those from Vendel 1 and 10,{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1119–1120}} and Broa,{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1106–1107}} which are too fragmentary to determine their exact construction—all employed two lateral bands and sectional infills. The Vendel 14 helmet had eight infill plates, one rectangular and one triangular per quadrant;{{sfn|Stolpe|Arne|1912|p=53–54}}{{sfn|Stolpe|Arne|1927|p=54}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1106}} that from Valsgärde 7 helmet used four infill plates, one for each quadrant;{{sfn|Arwidsson|1977|pp=21–22}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1119–1121}} the one from Valsgärde 6 also used identical infills for each quadrant, but with "elaborate"{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1119}} Y-shaped iron strips creating a latticed effect;{{sfn|Arwidsson|1942|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1119–1121}} and the Valsgärde 5 example filled in the back two quadrants with latticed iron strips, and the front two quadrants each with a rectangular section of lattice work and a triangular plate.{{sfn|Lindqvist|1931a|pp=5, 8}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|pp=1111, 1113–1114}}

The decorative and iconographic similarities between the Sutton Hoo and Scandinavian helmets are remarkable; they are so pronounced as to have helped in the reconstruction of the Sutton Hoo helmet's own imagery, and to have fostered the idea that the helmet was made in Sweden, not Anglo-Saxon England. Its ornate crest and eyebrows are paralleled by the Scandinavian designs, some of which replicate or imitate its silver wire inlays; garnets adorn the helmets from Sutton Hoo and Valsgärde 7; and the ''pressblech'' designs covering the Sutton Hoo and Scandinavian helmets are both ubiquitous and iconographically intertwined. Although the Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian helmets almost universally have crests, hence their general classification as "crested helmets,"{{sfn|Steuer|1987|p=200}}{{sfn|Tweddle|1992|p=1083}} the wire inlays in the Sutton Hoo crest find their closest parallel in the "Veldel-type helmet-crests in which such wire-inlay patterns are imitated in casting or engraving."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1952|p=752 n.21}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=211}} Thus the crests from the Vendel 1{{sfn|Stjerna|1912|p=14}}{{sfn|Stolpe|Arne|1912|p=13}}{{sfn|Lindqvist|1925|pp=198–199}}{{sfn|Stolpe|Arne|1927|p=13}}{{sfn|Martin-Clarke|1947|pp=63, pl.

In all these decorative respects, two Scandinavian helmets, from Valsgärde 7 and Gamla Uppsala, are uniquely similar to the Sutton Hoo example.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=214–215}} The Valsgärde 7 crest has a "cast chevron ornament";{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=215}} the helmet "is 'jeweled', like the Sutton Hoo helmet, but showing a greater use of garnets";{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=218}} and it contains figural and interlace ''pressblech'' patterns, including versions of the two figural designs used on the Sutton Hoo helmet.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=218}} Unlike on the Sutton Hoo helmet, the Valsgärde 7 rider and fallen warrior design was made with two dies, so that those on both dexter and sinister sides are seen moving towards the front, and they contain some "differing and additional elements."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=218}} The Valsgärde 7 version of the dancing warriors design, however, contains "only [one] major iconographic difference," the absence of two crossed spears behind the two men.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=188}} The scenes are so similar that it was only with the Valsgärde 7 design in hand that the Sutton Hoo design could be reconstructed.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=139}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1949|pp=49–50}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1950a|p=449}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1989a}} The Gamla Uppsala version of this scene is even more similar.

Whatever its Anglo-Saxon or Scandinavian origins, the Sutton Hoo helmet is descended from the Roman helmets of the fourth and fifth century Constantinian workshops.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=220}} Its construction—featuring a distinctive crest, solid cap and neck and cheek guards, face mask, and leather lining—bears clear similarities to these earlier helmets.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=219–223}} Numerous examples have a crest similar to that on the Sutton Hoo helmet, such as those from Deurne, [[Concești]], [[Pfersee|Augsburg-Pfersee]], and [[Augst]], and the Berkasovo 1 and 2 and Intercisa 2 and 4 helmets.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=219–222}} Meanwhile, the one-piece cap underneath, unique in this respect among the Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian helmets,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=152, 203, 214}} represents the end of a Greek and Roman technique.{{sfn|Nickel|2002|p=112}} Primarily used in first and second century helmets of the early [[Roman Empire]]{{sfn|Johnson|1980|p=309}}{{sfn|James|1986|p=113}} before being replaced by helmets with a bipartite construction{{sfn|James|1986|pp=109, 131–132}}—hence the role of the crest in holding the two halves together{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=203}}—the practice is thought to have finally been forgotten around 500 AD.{{sfn|Nickel|2002|p=112}}{{sfn|Hood|Ager|Williams|Harrington|2012|p=92}} The solid iron cheek guards of the Sutton Hoo helmet, likewise, derive from the Constantinian style, which was also marked by cutouts towards the back.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=220}} The current reconstruction partly assumes the Roman influence of the cheek guards; Roman practice reinforced the belief that leather hinges were employed,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=171–172, 185}} while the sinister and dexter cheek guards were swapped after an expert on arms and armour suggested that the cutouts should be at the back.{{sfn|Williams|1992|pp=85–85}} The neck guard similarly assumes leather hinges,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=174, 174 n.1, 185}}{{refn|group=note|In contrast to the Constantinian group, however, the cheek and neck guards on the Sutton Hoo helmet were affixed directly to the bowl.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=203}} Late Roman helmets tended to have an iron band along the bottom of the cap to which the lower pieces were attached, as is seen on the Duerne, Augsburg-Pfersee, and Berkasovo 1 and 2 helmets.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=203, 219, 221}}}} and with its solid iron construction—like the one-piece cap, unique among Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian helmets{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=210–212, 214}}—is even more closely aligned with the Roman examples,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=178–179, 219–220}} if longer than was typical.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=176}} The [[Witcham Gravel helmet]] from the first century AD{{sfn|Kaminski|Sim|2014|pp=71, 75, 79, 81}}{{sfn|British Museum g}} has such a broad and deep neck guard,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=178–179}} and solid projecting guards are found on the Deurne and Berkasovo 2 helmets.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=219–220, 222–223}} Another feature of the Sutton Hoo helmet unparalleled by its contemporaries—its face mask{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=214}}—is matched by Roman examples.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=223–224}} Among others the [[Ribchester Helmet|Ribchester helmet]] from the turn of the first century AD,{{sfn|British Museum h}} and the [[Emesa helmet]] from the early first century AD,{{sfn|Seyrig|1952a|p=69}}{{sfn|Seyrig|1952b|p=105}}{{refn|group=note|The [[Emesa helmet]] was also restored by [[Herbert Maryon]],{{sfn|Huey|1962a}}{{sfn|Huey|1962b}} who carried out the first reconstruction of the Sutton Hoo helmet.{{sfn|Maryon|1947}} An account of the restoration was published by [[Harold Plenderleith|H.

Several of the decorative aspects of the Sutton Hoo helmet, particularly its white appearance, inlaid garnets, and prominent rivets, also derive from Roman practice.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=219–223}} Its tinned surface compares with the Berkasovo 1 and 2 helmets and those from [[Concești]], Augsburg-Pfersee, and Deurne.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=219–223}}{{sfn|Webster|1998|pp=188–189}} The Berkasovo 1 and Budapest helmets are further adorned with precious or semi-precious stones, a possible origin for the garnets on the Sutton Hoo and Valsgärde 7 helmets.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=219–220}} Finally, the prominent rivets seen on some of the crested helmets, such as those from Valsgärde 8 and Sutton Hoo, may have been inspired by the similar decorative effect achieved by the rivets on Roman helmets like the Berkasovo 2 and Duerne examples.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=219, 222–223}}

=== ''Beowulf'' ===
Understandings of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial and ''[[Beowulf]]'' have been intertwined ever since the 1939 discovery of the former. "By the late 1950s, ''Beowulf'' and Sutton Hoo were so inseparable that, in study after study, the appearance of one inevitably and automatically evoked the other. If ''Beowulf'' came on stage first, Sutton Hoo was swiftly brought in to illustrate how closely seventh-century reality resembled what the poet depicted; if Sutton Hoo performed first, ''Beowulf'' followed close behind to give voice to the former's dumb evidence."{{sfn|Frank|1992|p=59}} Although "each monument sheds light on the other,"{{sfn|Frank|2008|p=78}} the connection between the two "has almost certainly been made too specific."{{sfn|Stanley|1981|p=205}} Yet "[h]elmets are described in greater detail than any other item of war-equipment in the poem,"{{sfn|Cramp|1957|p=60}} and some specific connections can be drawn. The boar imagery, crest and visor all find parallels in ''Beowulf'', as does the helmet's gleaming white and jeweled appearance. Though the Sutton Hoo helmet cannot be said to fully mirror any one helmet in ''Beowulf'', the many isolated similarities help ensure that "despite the limited archaeological evidence no feature of the poetic descriptions is inexplicable and without archaeological parallel."{{sfn|Cramp|1957|p=63}}

[[File:Benty grange helm.jpg|thumb|alt=Colour photograph of the Benty Grange helmet, which has a freestanding boar atop its crest|The [[Benty Grange helmet]] exhibits the other style of boar motif mentioned in ''Beowulf'']]
Helmets with boar motifs are mentioned five times in ''Beowulf'',{{sfn|''Beowulf''|loc=ll. 303–306, 1110–1112, 1286, 1327–1328, 1448–1454}}{{sfn|Hatto|1957a|pp=155–156}}{{sfn|Speake|1980|p=80}}{{sfn|Bateman|1861|p=33}} and fall into two categories: those with freestanding boars and those without.{{sfn|Cramp|1957|pp=62–63}}{{sfn|Davidson|1968|p=354}}{{sfn|Chaney|1970|pp=123–124}} As Beowulf and his fourteen men disembark their ship and are led to see King [[Hrothgar]], they leave the boat anchored in the water:
{{Verse translation|

|
So they went on their way. The ship rode the water,
broad-beamed, bound by its hawser
and anchored fast. Boar-shapes flashed
above their cheek-guards, the brightly forged
work of goldsmiths, watching over
those stern-faced men.{{sfn|Heaney|2000|pp=21–23}}|attr1=|attr2=}}
Such boar-shapes may have been like those on the Sutton Hoo helmet, terminating at the ends of the eyebrows and looking out over the cheek guards.{{sfn|Cramp|1957|pp=62–63}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=122}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=200}} Beowulf himself dons a helmet "set around with boar images"{{sfn|Cramp|1957|p=62}} (''{{lang|ang|besette swin-licum}}''{{sfn|''Beowulf''|loc=l. 1453}}) before his fight with Grendel's mother; further described as "the white helmet . . . enhanced by treasure" (''{{lang|ang|ac se hwita helm . . . since geweorðad}}''{{sfn|''Beowulf''|loc=ll. 1448–1450}}), a similar description could have been applied to the tinned Sutton Hoo example.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=122}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|pp=200–201}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974b|p=7}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974c|p=286}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=185, 205, 205 n.1}} (The two helmets would not have been identical, however; Beowulf's was further described as "encircled in lordly links"{{sfn|Newton|1993|p=41}}—''{{lang|ang|befongen frea-wrasnum}}''{{sfn|''Beowulf''|loc=l. 1451}}—a possible reference to the type of chain mail on the Valsgärde 6 and 8 helmets that provided neck and face protection.{{sfn|Cramp|1957|pp=61–62}}{{sfn|Herben Jr.|1937}}) The other style of boar adornment, mentioned three times in the poem,{{sfn|''Beowulf''|loc=ll. 1110–1112, 1286, 1327–1328}} appears to refer to helmets with a freestanding boar atop the crest.{{sfn|Cramp|1957|pp=59, 62–63}}{{sfn|Davidson|1968|p=354}}{{sfn|Chaney|1970|pp=123–124}} When Hrothgar laments the death of his close friend [[Æschere]], he recalls how Æschere was "my right hand man when the ranks clashed and our boar-crests had to take a battering in the line of action."{{sfn|Heaney|2000|p=93}}{{sfn|Beowulf|loc=ll. 1326–1328}} These crests were probably more similar to those on the Benty Grange and Wollaston helmets,{{sfn|Cramp|1957|pp=59, 62–63}}{{sfn|Davidson|1968|p=354}}{{sfn|Chaney|1970|pp=123–124}} a [[Guilden Morden boar|detached boar]] found in [[Guilden Morden]],{{sfn|Fordham|1904}}{{sfn|Foster|1977a}}{{sfn|Foster|1977b|pp=23, 27}} and those seen in contemporary imagery on the Vendel 1 and Valsgärde 7 helmets and on the [[Torslunda plates]].{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=208–210, 216–217}}{{sfn|Stolpe|Arne|1927|loc=pl.

Alongside the boar imagery on the eyebrows, the silver inlays of the crest on the Sutton Hoo helmet find linguistic support in ''Beowulf''. The helmet presented to Beowulf as a "victory gift" following his defeat of Grendel is described with identical features:
{{Verse translation|

It was hardly a shame to be showered with such gifts
in front of the hall-troops. There haven't been many
moments, I am sure, when men exchanged
four such treasures at so friendly a sitting.
An embossed ridge, a band lapped with wire
arched over the helmet: head-protection
to keep the keen-ground cutting edge
from damaging it when danger threatened
and the man was battling behind his shield.{{sfn|Heaney|2000|p=69}}|attr1=|attr2=}}
This portion of the poem was thought "probably corrupt" until the helmet was discovered, with the suggestion that "the scribe himself does not appear to have understood it";{{sfn|Arnold|1876|p=70}} the meaning of "the notorious ''{{lang|ang|wala}}'',"{{sfn|Frank|1992|pp=54–55}} in particular, was only guessed at.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1952|pp=707, 752 n.21}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|pp=210–213}}{{refn|group=note|In 1882, for instance, ''{{lang|ang|wala}}'' was defined as "some part of a helmet," with the particular lines in Beowulf only partially translated as "about the helm's top a 'wal' wire-girt guarded on the outside the head's defense (i.e. the helmet)."{{sfn|Bosworth|Toller|1882|p=1163}} By 1916 it was termed a "rib, comb (of helmet),"{{sfn|Hall|1916|p=342}} and in 1922 it was said that "[t]he exact nature of a wala, which seems to be an ornamental as well as useful part of the helmet, is not known."{{sfn|Klaeber|1922|p=164}} This confusion led to incorrect or speculative translations of the relevant lines, such as (1837) "[a]bout the crest of the helm, the defense of the head, it held an amulet fastened without with wires";{{sfn|Kemble|1837|p=43}} (1855) "[a]round the helmet's roof, the head-guard, with wires bound round";{{sfn|Thorpe|1855|p=69}} (1914) "[r]ound the crown of the helm, as guard for the head, without, ran a rib to which plates were made fast";{{sfn|Hall|1914|p=37}} (1921) "[a]bout the roof of that helmet / his head's safety, With wires ywounden, / a wreath guarded without";{{sfn|Moncrieff|1921|p=39}} and, by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] in 1926, "[r]ound the helmet's crown the wale wound about with wire kept guard without over the head."{{sfn|Tolkien|2014|p=42}} Despite the many mistranslations, a correct interpretation of the use of the word ''{{lang|ang|wala}}'' was theorized at least twice before the discovery of the Sutton Hoo helmet. With the Vendel 1 helmet, which had a crest with "reminiscences or imitations of actual wire inlays on earlier or richer helmets,"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1952|p=752 n.21}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=211}} as his inspiration, [[Knut Stjerna]] suggested in 1912 that the "helmet had a rib or comb running up to it to its whole height and down again at the back, and this must have been the part of the helmet which is spoken of as the ''{{lang|ang|walu}}''."{{sfn|Stjerna|1912|p=14}} Elizabeth Martin-Clarke posed a similar idea during a 1945 lecture, stating that "probably here we may have a reference to a special part of the helmet also which resists the sword cut . . . well represented in the picture of a reconstructed helmet from Vendel [1]."{{sfn|Martin-Clarke|1947|p=63}}{{sfn|Frank|1992|pp=54–55}}}} The term is generally used in [[Old English]] to refer to a ridge of land, not the crest of a helmet;{{sfn|Frank|1992|p=55}} metaphorically termed ''{{lang|ang|wala}}'' in the poem, the crest is furthermore ''{{lang|ang|wirum bewunden}}'', literally "bound with wires."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=124}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=204}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=158}} It therefore parallels the silver inlays along the crest of the Sutton Hoo helmet.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1952|pp=707, 752 n.21}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|pp=210–211}} Such a crest would, as described in ''Beowulf'', provide protection from a falling sword. "A quick turn of the head as the blow fell would enable the wearer to take it across the 'comb' and avoid its falling parallel with the comb and splitting the cap."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1952|p=752 n.21}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=210}} The discovery has led many Old English dictionaries to define ''{{lang|ang|wala}}'' within the "immediate context" of ''Beowulf'', including as a "ridge or comb inlaid with wires running on top of helmet from front to back," although doing so "iron[s] out the figurative language" intended in the poem.{{sfn|Frank|1992|p=55}} The specific meaning of the term as used within the poem is nevertheless explicated by the Sutton Hoo helmet, in turn "illustrat[ing] the intimacy of the relationship between the archaeological material in the Sutton Hoo grave and the ''Beowulf'' poem."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1952|p=752 n.21}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=213}}

A final parallel between the Sutton Hoo helmet and those in ''Beowulf'' is the presence of face masks, a feature which makes the former unique among its Anglo-Saxon and East Scandinavian counterparts.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|pp=124–125}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=205}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=214}} The uniqueness may reflect that, as part of a royal burial,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=214}} the helmet is "richer and of higher quality than any other helmet yet found."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=210}} In ''Beowulf'', "a poem about kings and nobles, in which the common people hardly appear,"{{sfn|Stjerna|1912|p=1}} compounds such as "battle-mask" (''{{lang|ang|beadogriman}}''{{sfn|Beowulf|loc=l. 2257}}), "war-mask" (''{{lang|ang|heregriman}}''{{sfn|Beowulf|loc=ll. 396, 2049, 2605}}), "mask-helm" (''{{lang|ang|grimhelmas}}''{{sfn|Beowulf|loc=l. 334}}), and "war-head" (''{{lang|ang|wigheafolan}}''{{sfn|Beowulf|loc=l. 2661}}) indicate the use of visored helmets.{{sfn|Newton|1993|p=33}}{{sfn|Cramp|1957|pp=63, 63 n.30}} The term "war-head" is particularly apt for the anthropomorphic Sutton Hoo helmet. "[T]he word does indeed describe a helmet realistically. ''{{lang|ang|Wigheafola}}'': complete head-covering, forehead, eyebrows, eye-holes, cheeks, nose, mouth, chin, even a moustache!"{{sfn|Brady|1979|p=90}}

The Sutton Hoo helmet was discovered over three days in July and August 1939, with only three weeks remaining in the excavation of the ship-burial. It was found in more than 500 pieces,{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=77}} which would prove to account for less than half of the original surface area.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=120}} The discovery was recorded in the diary of [[Charles Phillips (archaeologist)|C. W. Phillips]] as follows:

{{quotation|Friday, 28 July 1939: "The crushed remains of an iron helmet were found {{convert|4|ft|spell=in|disp=sqbr}} east of the shield boss on the north side of the central deposit. The remains consisted of many fragments of iron covered with embossed ornament of an interlace with which were also associated gold leaf, textiles, an anthropomorphic face-piece consisting of a nose, mouth, and moustache cast as a whole (bronze), and bronze zoomorphic mountings and enrichments."

Saturday, 29 July: "A few more fragments of the iron helmet came to light and were boxed with the rest found the day before."

Tuesday, 1 August: "The day was spent in clearing out the excavated stern part of the ship and preparing it for study. Before this a final glean and sift in the burial area had produced a few fragments which are probably to be associated with the helmet and the chain mail respectively."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=742–743}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=138}}}}

[[File:Excavation diagram of the Sutton Hoo burial chamber.png|thumb|alt=Black and white drawing showing the position of the objects as found in the burial chamber. Whereas fragments of objects such as the shield are individually marked, the helmet is noted only by a circle with the words "nucleus of helmet remains."|The helmet fragments were neither photographed nor recorded ''in situ'', leaving only their general location known.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1979|p=13}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=138–140}}]]
Although the helmet is now considered to be one of the most important artefacts ever found on British soil,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=120}}{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=73}} its shattered state caused it to go at first unnoticed. No photographs were taken of the fragments ''in situ'', nor were their relative positions recorded,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=120}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=198}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=138}} as the importance of the discovery had not yet been realised.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=137}}{{refn|group=note|In a list of thirteen "hard-learned lessons" for the excavation of any future ship-burial that were given in a 1973 lecture, Bruce-Mitford would start the list with "[y]ou cannot take too many photographs" and "[y]ou cannot use too much colour film."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1979|p=10}}}} The only contemporary record of the helmet's location was a circle on the excavation diagram marked "nucleus of helmet remains."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1979|p=13}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=138–140}} When reconstruction of the helmet commenced years later, it would thus become "a jigsaw puzzle without any sort of picture on the lid of the box,"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=120}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=198}} not to mention a jigsaw puzzle missing half its pieces.

Overlooked at first, the helmet quickly gained notice. Even before all the fragments had been excavated, the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' spoke of "a gold helmet encrusted with precious stones."{{sfn|Daily Mail|1939a}} A few days later it would more accurately describe the helmet as having "elaborate interlaced ornaments in silver and gold leaf."{{sfn|Daily Mail|1939b|p=10}} Despite scant time to examine the fragments,{{sfn|Kendrick|Kitzinger|Allen|1939|p=111}}{{sfn|Kendrick|1940|p=180}} they were termed "elaborate"{{sfn|Phillips|Kendrick|Plenderleith|Godwin|1940|p=163}} and "magnificent";{{sfn|Kendrick|Kitzinger|Allen|1939|p=113}} "crushed and rotted"{{sfn|Kendrick|Kitzinger|Allen|1939|p=130}} and "sadly broken" such that it "may never make such an imposing exhibit as it ought to do,"{{sfn|Kendrick|1940|p=174}} it was nonetheless thought the helmet "may be one of the most exciting finds."{{sfn|Kendrick|Kitzinger|Allen|1939|p=130}} The stag found in the burial—later placed atop the sceptre—was even thought at first to adorn the crest of the helmet,{{sfn|Phillips|Kendrick|Plenderleith|Godwin|1940|pp=163, 168}}{{sfn|Kendrick|1940|p=174}}{{sfn|Phillips|1940|p=14}}{{sfn|Phillips|1941|p=256}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1949|p=9 n.34}} in parallel to the boar-crested [[Benty Grange helmet]]. This theory would gain no traction, however, and the helmet would have to wait out [[World War II]] before reconstruction could begin.

Excavations at Sutton Hoo came to an end on 24 August 1939, and all items were shipped out the following day.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=747}} Nine days later, Britain declared war on Germany. The intervening time allowed "first-aid treatment of fragile objects and perishables," and for "the finds to be deposited in security."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1947|p=11}} Throughout World War II the Sutton Hoo artefacts, along with other treasures from the British Museum such as the [[Elgin Marbles]],{{sfn|Lambert|2014}}{{sfn|Cunliffe|2016}} were stored in [[Aldwych tube station]].{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=xxxvii}}{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=73}} Only at the end of 1944 were preparations made to unpack, conserve and restore the finds from Sutton Hoo.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1989a}}

== First reconstruction ==
[[File:Sutton Hoo helmet - First Restoration.png|thumb|upright|alt=Colour photograph, taken from the front against a white background, of the first reconstruction of the Sutton hoo helmet.|The 1946 restoration of the Sutton Hoo helmet was displayed for more than 20 years.]]
{{See also|Herbert Maryon}}
The helmet was first reconstructed by [[Herbert Maryon]] from 1945 to 1946.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1946|pp=2–4}}{{sfn|Martin-Clarke|1947|p=63 n.19}} A retired professor of sculpture and an authority on early metalwork, Maryon was specially employed as a Technical Attaché at the [[British Museum]] on 11 November 1944.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=228}} His job was to restore and conserve the finds from the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, including "the real headaches – notably the crushed shield, helmet and drinking horns."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1989a}} Maryon's work on the Sutton Hoo objects continued until 1950,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1989b|p=14}}{{sfn|Carver|2004|p=25}} of which six continuous months were was spent reconstructing the helmet.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1947|p=24}} Stalled for years by World War II and still in the fragmentary state in which it had entered the war, by the time it reached Maryon's workbench the "task of restoration was thus reduced to a jigsaw puzzle without any sort of picture on the lid of the box,"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=120}} and, "as it proved, a great many of the pieces missing."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=140}}

Efforts on the first reconstruction began with a "process of familiarisation"{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=78}} with the various fragments;{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=137}} each piece was traced and detailed on a "piece of stiff card", until after "a long while" reconstruction could commence.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=137}} For this, Maryon sculpted "a head of normal size" from plaster, then "padded the head out above the brows to allow for the thickness of the lining which a metal helmet would naturally require."{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=144}} The fragments of the skull cap were then initially stuck to the head with [[Plasticine]], or, if thicker, placed into spaces cut into the head. Finally, "strong white plaster" was used to permanently affix the fragments, and, mixed with brown [[umber]], fill in the gaps between pieces.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=144}} Meanwhile, the fragments of the cheek guards, neck guard, and visor were placed onto shaped, plaster-covered wire mesh, then affixed with more plaster and joined to the cap.{{sfn|Williams|1992|pp=74–75}}

Though visibly different from the current reconstruction, "[m]uch of Maryon's work is valid. The general character of the helmet was made plain."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=121}} The 1946 reconstruction identified the designs recognised today, and similarly arranged them in a panelled configuration.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=140}} Both reconstructions composed the visor and neck guards with the same designs: the visor with the smaller interlace (design 5), the neck guard with a top row of the larger interlace (design 4) above two rows of the smaller interlace.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|pp=143–144}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|pp=121, 126}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=200, 203}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=146–149}} The layout of the cheek guards is also similar in both reconstructions; the main differences are the added length provided by a third row in the second reconstruction, the replacement of a design 4 panel with the dancing warriors (design 1) in the middle row, and the switching of sides.{{sfn|Maryon|1947|pp=143–144}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|pp=121, 126}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=200, 203}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=146–149}}

=== Reception and criticism ===
[[File:Sutton Hoo helmet - First Restoration - Dexter.jpg|thumb|alt=Colour photograph of the first reconstruction, dexter side.|Criticisms of the first reconstruction noted its small size, seen by the projecting face mask; the unprotected jaw; the hole left between nose and crest; the plaster used to lengthen the crest; and the fixed neck guard.]]
The first reconstruction of the Sutton Hoo helmet was met with worldwide acclaim and was both academically and culturally influential.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=74}} It stayed on display for more than 20 years,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=121}}{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=74}} during which time it became an iconic object of the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=121}}{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=6}}{{sfn|Williams|1992|pp=74, 77}} In 1951 the helmet was displayed at the [[Festival of Britain]],{{sfn|Donahue|2006|loc=23:39}} where an exhibit on Sutton Hoo was curated by [[Rupert Bruce-Mitford]].{{sfn|Festival of Britain Catalogue|1951|pp=106, 114}} That same year [[Life magazine|''Life'']] dispatched a 25-year-old [[Larry Burrows]] to the British Museum, resulting in a full-page photograph of the helmet alongside a photograph of Maryon;{{sfn|Life|1951|pp=19, 82–83}}{{sfn|Gerwardus|2011}} five years later, on the strength of his restorations, Maryon was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]].{{sfn|London Gazette|1956|p=3113}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1965}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1983a|p=xliii}} Images of the helmet made their way into television programmes,{{sfn|Marzinzik|2007|pp=16–17}} books, and newspapers,{{sfn|Mitchell|1970}}{{sfn|Mitchell|1971}} even as the second reconstruction was worked on.{{sfn|Grohskopf|1970|p=68}} Though the lasting impact of the first reconstruction is as a first, reversible, attempt from which problems could be identified and solutions could be found,{{sfn|Caple|2000|pp=133–134}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1983a|p=xliii}} for two decades Maryon's reconstruction was an icon in its own right.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=121}}{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=6}}{{sfn|Williams|1992|pp=74, 77}}

With the helmet on public display and as greater knowledge of contemporary helmets became available,{{sfn|Caple|2000|p=133}} the first reconstruction "was soon criticised, though not in print, by Swedish scholars and others."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=120}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=199}}{{refn|group=note|The only published criticism may have been that of [[Sune Lindqvist]], who wrote that the reconstruction "needs revision in certain respects."{{sfn|Lindqvist|1948b|p=136}}{{sfn|Green|1963|p=69}} Lindqvist's only specific criticism, however, was that the face mask was "set somewhat awry in the reconstruction."{{sfn|Lindqvist|1948b|p=136}} Bruce-Mitford was undoubtedly aware of Lindqvist's criticism when he wrote that the first reconstruction was not criticised in print, for he was the English translator of Lindqvist's article. He was thus likely referring to the more substantial criticisms of the reconstruction, such as its gaps in afforded protection, which indeed do not seem to have been published.}} An underlying issue was the decision to arrange the fragments around the mould of an average man's head, possibly inadvertently predetermining the reconstruction's size.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=204}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=123}} Particular criticisms also noted its exposed areas, and a neck guard that was fixed rather than movable.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|pp=123–124}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|pp=201, 204}}{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=74}} Though envisioned as similar to a "crash helmet of a motor cyclist" with padding of about {{convert|3/8|in|mm}} between head and helmet,{{sfn|Maryon|1947|p=137}} its size allowed for little such cushioning;{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=123}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=204}}{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=74}} one with a larger head would have had difficulty just getting it on.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=74}} The missing portion at the front of each cheek piece left the jaw exposed,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=123}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=201}} there was a hole between eyebrows and nose, and the "eye holes were so large" as to "allow a sword to pass through."{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=74}} Meanwhile, as noted early on by [[Sune Lindqvist]],{{sfn|Lindqvist|1948b|p=136}} the "angle of the face mask looked strange, not least because it rendered the wearer's nose vulnerable in the event of a blow to the face."{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=74}}

A final issue raised by Maryon's construction was the use of plaster to elongate the crest by approximately {{convert|4+1/2|in}}.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=232}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=124}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=204}} The crest had largely survived its millennium of interment, perhaps given durability by the inlaid silver wires.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=232}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=124}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=204}} The need to replace missing portions was thus questioned;{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=232}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=124}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=204}} it was thought that either Maryon had reconstructed the crest "to an undue length", or that original portions had been overlooked during the 1939 excavation.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=232}} When the ship-burial was re-excavated in the 1960s, one of the objectives was thus to search for more fragments, the absence of which could be treated as evidence that the crest had originally been shorter.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=232, 278}}

===Re-excavations at Sutton Hoo, 1965–70===
[[File:Sutton Hoo helmet - hinge on cheek guard.png|thumb|alt=Close-up colour photograph of two joining fragments on dexter cheek guard which together complete a hinge. The fragment on the left was discovered in 1967 during re-excavations at Sutton Hoo.|Discovered in 1967, the fragment on the left completed a hinge on the dexter cheek guard]]
Numerous questions were left unanswered by the 1939 excavation at Sutton Hoo, and in 1965 a second excavation began. Among other objectives were to survey the burial mound and its surrounding environment, to relocate the ship impression (from which a plaster cast was ultimately taken{{sfn|Van Geersdaele|1969}}{{sfn|Van Geersdaele|1970}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=280–288, 301–302}}) and excavate underneath, and to search the strata from the 1939 dumps for any fragments that may have been originally missed.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=230–236}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|pp=170–171}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1968a|pp=36–37}} The first excavation had been effectively "rescue dig" under the threat of impending war,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=170}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1979|p=5}} creating the danger that fragments of objects might have been inadvertently discarded;{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|pp=170–171}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=232, 311}} a gold mount from the burial was already known to have nearly met that fate.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=232 n.3}} Additional fragments of the helmet could hopefully shed light on the unidentified third figural design, or buttress Maryon's belief that {{convert|4|in}} of the crest were missing.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=232}} To this end, the excavation sought "both positive and negative evidence."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=171}} New crest fragments could go where Maryon had placed plaster, while their absence could be used to suggest that the crest on the first reconstruction was too long.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|pp=232, 278}}

Four new helmet fragments were discovered during re-excavation.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=335}} The three 1939 dumps were located during the 1967 season, and "almost at once" yielded "fragments of helmet and of the large hanging bowl&amp;nbsp;... as well as fragments of shield ornaments and a tine from the stag."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=170}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1968a|p=36}} The finds were so plentiful that a single three foot by one foot section of the first dump contained sixty cauldron fragments.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=278}} The four pieces of the helmet came from the second dump, which contained only items from the ship's burial chamber.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=278}} They included a hinge piece from the dexter cheek guard,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=335}} a "surface flake" from the crest,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=278}} a small piece of iron with fluted lines, and a small piece of iron edging showing part of the larger interlace design.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=335}}

The most important helmet finds from the re-excavation at Sutton Hoo were the piece from cheek guard, and the lack of any substantial crest piece. The fragment of the cheek guard joined another found in 1939,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=335}} together completing "a hinge plate for one of the moving parts of the helmet, which could not be done previously."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=279}} Meanwhile, although a "surface flake" from the crest was discovered, its placement did not affect the overall length of the crest.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=156}} The lack of significant crest finds instead "reinforce[d] scepticism of the long plaster insertions in the original reconstruction."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1975|p=278}}

The current reconstruction of the Sutton Hoo helmet was completed in 1971, following eighteen months of work by [[Nigel Williams (conservator)|Nigel Williams]].{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=123}} Williams had joined the British Museum in his teens after studying at the same [[Central School of Art and Design|Central School of Arts and Crafts]] as Maryon,{{sfn|Oddy|1992}}{{sfn|Institution of Mechanical Engineers|1918}}{{sfn|Mapping Sculpture|2011}} yet in contrast to Maryon, who completed the first restoration in his 70s and "with the use of only one eye,"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1965}} Williams reconstructed the helmet while in his mid-20s.{{sfn|Oddy|1992}}

In 1968, with problems evident in the first reconstruction that were left unresolved by the re-excavations at Sutton Hoo, the decision was made to reexamine the evidence.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=74}} "After several months' consideration" it was decided to disassemble the helmet and construct it anew.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=74}} The cheek guards, face mask and neck guard were first removed from the helmet and x-rayed, revealing the wire mesh covered in plaster and overlaid by fragments.{{sfn|Williams|1992|pp=74–75}} The wire was then "rolled back like a carpet", and a saw used to separate each fragment.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=75}} The remaining plaster was chipped away with a scalpel and needles.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=75}} The final piece of the helmet, the skull cap, was next cut in half by pushing off the crest with "long pins" inserted through the bottom of the plaster head and then slicing through the middle of the head.{{sfn|Williams|1992|pp=75–77}} The "central core of plaster" was then removed, and the remaining "thin skin of plaster and iron" separated into individual fragments "in the same way as the ear flaps, neck guard and face mask."{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=77}} This process of separation took four months and left the helmet in more than 500 fragments.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=77}} The result was "terrifying" to Williams.{{sfn|Williams|1989|p=6}} "One of only two known Anglo-Saxon helmets, an object illustrated in almost every book on the early medieval period, lay in pieces."{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=77}}

After four months of disassembly, work began on a new construction of the helmet.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=77}} This work was advanced largely by the discovery of new joins, marked by several breakthroughs in understanding.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|pp=126–127}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=206}} "Almost all" of the new joins were found by looking at the backs of the fragments, which retained "a unique blackened, rippled and bubbly nature,"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=127}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|pp=206–207}} "wrinkled like screwed up paper and very black in colour."{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=78}} The distinctive nature is thought to result from a "disintegrated leather lining permeated with iron oxide"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=127}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=207}}—indeed, this is the evidence substantiating the leather lining in the [[Royal Armouries]] replica{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=179}}—and allowed for the fragments' wrinkles to be matched under a microscope.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=80}} In this manner the skull cap was built out from the crest, aided by the discovery that only the two fluted strips bordering the crest were gilded; the six fragments with gilded moulding were consequently found to attach to the crest.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=80}} The cheek guards, meanwhile, were shaped and substantially lengthened by joining three fragments from the sinister side of the first reconstruction with two fragments from the [[dexter and sinister|dexter]] side.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=79}} The exposed areas by the jaw left by the first reconstruction were only eliminated near the end of the second, when an expert on arms and armour advised that the cheek guards should simply switch sides.{{sfn|Williams|1992|pp=85–86}}

When a "reasonable picture of the original helmet" was in view, more than nine months of work into the second reconstruction, the repositioned fragments were placed against a "featureless plaster dome."{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=84}} This dome was itself built outwards with "oil-free [[plasticine]]" to match the original dimensions of the helmet.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=84}} The fragments were held in place with "long pins" until a mixture of [[jute]] and adhesive was molded to the shape of the missing areas, and adhered to the fragments.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=85}} The edges of the fragments were then coated with water-resistant resin,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=181}} and plaster was spread atop the jute to level and smooth the helmet's surface.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=85}} The plaster was painted light brown to resemble the colour of the fragments while allowing the fragments themselves to stand out;{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1982|p=251}} lines were then drawn to indicate the edges of the panels.{{sfn|Williams|1992|p=86}} The result was a hollow helmet in which the backs of the fragments remain visible.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=181}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1982|p=251}} On 2 November 1971,{{sfn|Marzinzik|2007|p=28}} after eighteen months of time and a full year of work by Williams, the second and current reconstruction of the Sutton Hoo helmet was put on display.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1972|p=123}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974a|p=201}}{{sfn|Blake|1971}}

=== Cultural impact ===

The 1971 reconstruction of the Sutton Hoo helmet was widely celebrated,{{sfn|Oddy|1992}} and in the five decades since it has come to symbolise the [[Middle Ages]], archaeology, and England.{{sfn|Marzinzik|2007|p=61}}{{sfn|Richards|1992|p=131}}{{sfn|MacGregor|2011|pp=301–303}} It is depicted on the covers of novels, textbooks, and scholarly publications, such as [[The Winter King (novel)|''The Winter King'']] by [[Bernard Cornwell]] and ''The Anglo-Saxons'' by [[James Campbell (historian)|James Campbell]], and has influenced artists, filmmakers and designers.{{sfn|Marzinzik|2007|pp=59–60}}  At the same time, the helmet has become the face of a time once known as the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], but now recognised for its sophistication—in part because of the finds from Sutton Hoo—and referred to as the Middle Ages.{{sfn|MacGregor|2011|pp=301, 305}}{{sfn|BBC|2010}}{{sfn|Marzinzik|2007|p=61}} It gives truth to a period of time known from depictions of warriors and mead halls in ''Beowulf'', once thought fanciful, and personifies the Anglo-Saxons in post-Roman Britain.{{sfn|MacGregor|2011|pp=303–305}} Considered "the most iconic object"{{sfn|Google Arts &amp; Culture}}{{sfn|Davis|2013}} from an archaeological find hailed as the "British Tutankhamen,"{{sfn|Daily Mail|1939b}}{{sfn|MacGregor|2011|p=303}} in 2006 it was voted one of the 100 cultural icons of England alongside the [[Machin series|Queen's head stamp]], the [[AEC Routemaster|double-decker bus]], and the cup of tea.{{sfn|BBC News|2006}}{{sfn|Culture24}}

=== Errors ===
Although "universally acclaimed,"{{sfn|Oddy|1992}} the current reconstruction of the Sutton Hoo helmet left "a number of minor problems unsolved"{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974b|p=6}} and contains several slight inaccuracies. These are primarily confined to the neck guard, where "very little indeed of the original substance . . . survives that can be positioned with any certainty."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1982|p=257}} Two blocks of fragments on the bottom edge, and four blocks of fragments in the middle, are only speculatively placed, leaving some uncertainty about their correct locations.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1982|p=259}} The resulting uncertainties relate to the placement of the individual fragments within the larger space, rather than to a problem with the proposed shape of the neck guard.

As currently reconstructed, the Sutton Hoo neck guard has three principal problems. Several fragments of design 5 are placed too high on the neck guard, which "shows more space below the lengths of transverse fluted strips than above them. The space left below is greater than the length of the die, while the space above is less than the length of the die."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=176 n.1}} Corrected on the Royal Armouries replica, the configuration should allow for two full impressions of design 5, of equal length, joined vertically at their ends.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=176, 176 n.1}} Furthermore, the lack of fragments from the neck guard leaves open the question of how many vertical strips of design 5 were used.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1982|p=258}} Although seven strips were suggested in the reconstruction,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=144, 148}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1982|pp=258–259}} "[t]here is no evidence to indicate that there were seven vertical ornamental strips on the lower portion of the neck-guard, and the suggestion . . . that the number should be cut to five is equally possible."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1982|p=258}} Even if seven is the accurate number, the current reconstruction shows an "implausible inward tilt" by the two strips flanking the central one; straightening the strips "would have the effect of allowing the ornamental strips to fan out naturally, leaving evenly-expanding wedges of plain surface between them."{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1982|p=259}} Finally, the neck guard hangs lower on the current reconstruction than it would have when made, for the top of the neck guard originally fitted inside the cap.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=181}} This leaves the abutting edges of the dexter cheek and neck guards at different levels, and was corrected on the Royal Armouries replica.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=181}}

== Royal Armouries replica ==
[[File:Sutton Hoo helmet (replica).jpg|thumb|alt=Colour photograph of the Royal Armouries replica of the Sutton Hoo helmet|Royal Armouries replica]]
In 1973 the [[Royal Armouries]] collaborated with the British Museum to create a replica of the newly restored Sutton Hoo helmet.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974b}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974c}} The museum provided a general blueprint of the design{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974c|p=286}} along with [[electrotyping|electrotypes]] of the decorative elements—nose and mouth piece, eyebrows, dragon heads, and ''pressblech'' foils—leaving the Master of the Armouries A. R. Duffy, along with his assistant [[H. Russell Robinson]] and senior conservation officer armourers E. H. Smith and A. Davis to complete the task.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974b|p=6}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974c|pp=285–286}} A number of differences in construction were observed, such as a solid crest, lead solder used to back the decorative effects, and the technique employed to inlay the silver, although the helmet hewed closely to the original design.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=185}} The differences led to the replica's weight of {{convert|3.74|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, or {{convert|1.24|kg|lb|abbr=on}} heavier than the estimated weight of the original.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=185}} The finished replica was unveiled before an address at the [[Internationales Sachsensymposion|''Sachsensymposion'']] in September 1973{{sfn|Sachsensymposion}} with theatrical flair: the lights were dimmed; down the aisle came [[Nigel Williams (conservator)|Nigel Williams]] holding a replica of the Sutton Hoo whetstone; and behind him followed Rupert Bruce-Mitford, wearing a carriage rug and with hands hieratically crossed, wearing the Royal Armouries helmet and reciting the opening lines of ''Beowulf''.{{sfn|Biddle|2015|p=84}}

The Royal Armouries replica clarified a number of details of the original helmet, and provided an example of what it looked like when new.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974b}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974c}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=181–185}} It could also be worn and subjected to experimentation in a way the original could not.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974b|p=7}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974c|p=286}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=152 n.1, 181–185}} In particular the reproduction showed that the neck guard would have originally been set inside the cap, allowing it to move with more freedom and ride up, and thereby demonstrated an inaccuracy in the 1971 reconstruction, where the neck guard and the dexter cheek guard are misaligned.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=181}} The replica also corrected a second error in the reconstruction of the neck guard by affording an equal length to both the lower and upper instances of design 5, although it probably introduced an error by placing a visible billeted border on all four sides of each design 5 impression.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=176, 176 n.1}} That the replica could be worn also evinced several attributes of the original.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974b|p=7}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974c|p=286}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=152 n.1, 181–185}} It demonstrated the ranges of motion and vision that a wearer would have,{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974b|p=7}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974c|p=286}} and that with adequate padding in addition to the leather lining, people with heads of different sizes could comfortably wear the helmet.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=181–185}} It also showed that the helmet, while stifling, could  realistically be worn in battle,{{sfn|Donahue|2006|loc=13:51}} and that it would bestow upon its wearer a commanding and sonorous voice.{{sfn|Donahue|2006|loc=8:27}} Finally, and most strikingly, the Royal Armouries replica simply showed how the Sutton Hoo helmet originally appeared.{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974b|pp=6–7}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974c|pp=285–286}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|p=185}} It showed the helmet as a shining white object rather than a rusted brown relic, and in doing so illustrated the lines in ''Beowulf'' referring to  "the white helmet . . . enhanced by treasure" (''ac se hwita helm . . . since geweorðad''{{sfn|Beowulf|loc=ll. 1448–1450}}).{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974b|p=7}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1974c|p=286}}{{sfn|Bruce-Mitford|1978|pp=185, 205, 205 n.1, 214}}

The replica is displayed in the British Museum alongside the original helmet in Room 41.{{sfn|British Museum replica}}{{sfn|British Museum a}} It has also been exhibited worldwide, including stops in the United States,{{sfn|Connor|2003|pp=42, 98}} Japan,{{sfn|Asahi Shimbun|2003|pp=146–147}} South Korea, China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.{{sfn|British Museum replica}}

'''TG4''' ({{lang-ga|TG Ceathair}}; {{IPA-ga|tʲeː ɟeː ˈcahəɾʲ|pron}} or {{IPA-ga|tiː d͡ʒiː ˈcahəɾʲ|}}) is an Irish [[public service broadcaster]] for [[Irish language|Irish-language]] speakers. The channel launched on 31 October 1996. It is available to 98% of homes in Ireland through [[digital terrestrial television]] [[Saorview]] and is available on [[Virgin Media Ireland]], [[Eircom|eVision]], [[Magnet Networks]] and [[Sky Ireland]]. TG4 is also available to watch online live and to view previously broadcast programmes from around the world through the [[TG4 Player]].

TG4 was formerly known as '''{{lang|ga|Teilifís na Gaeilge}}''' or '''TnaG''', before a rebranding campaign in 1999. TG4 was the third national station to be launched in Ireland; after [[RTÉ One]] in 1961 (as {{lang|ga|Teilifís Éireann}}) and [[RTÉ Two]] in 1978; and was followed by [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]] in 1998. The channel has 650,000 viewers who tune into the channel each day to view a broad programming policy. It has been reported to have a share of 2% of the national television market in the Republic of Ireland and 3% of the national television market in Northern Ireland. The daily Irish-language programme schedule is its core service: seven hours of programming in Irish supported by a wide range of material in other languages, mostly English.

TG4 launched its high-definition channel ('''TG4 HD''') in 2012 on [[Virgin Media Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;"TG4 HD to Launch in 1 October" &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"TG4 HD to Launch in 30 September"&lt;/ref&gt;

===TG4 HD===
'''TG4 HD''' launched on 2 October 2012,&lt;ref name="TG4 HD to Launch in October"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.upc.ie/app/answers/detail/a_id/463/|title=New Channels Announced|publisher=UPC Ireland|accessdate=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; exclusively on [[Virgin Media Ireland|UPC Ireland]].&lt;ref name="TG4 HD to Launch in September"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cce.gno.ie/ent/2012/07July/10TG4HD.php|title=TG4 HD to Launch in September|publisher=CCÉ|accessdate=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first HD broadcast featured the 2012 TG4 Ladies Gaelic Football Championship final. TG4 HD, similar to [[RTÉ Two HD]], broadcasts mainly sporting programming from national to international events, documentaries, movies and US programming in high-definition where available. It is anticipated that TG4 will itself start broadcasting its own programming produced in high-definition in the future.&lt;ref name="TG4 HD to Launch in September"/&gt;

==History==
In 1969, [[Lelia Doolan]], Jack Dowling and [[Bob Quinn (Irish filmmaker)|Bob Quinn]] published ''Sit down and Be Counted'', a book describing their campaign for a separate Irish-language television service. Bob Quinn is a maverick film director who produced many documentaries and fiction films through the Irish language on limited budgets, including the first Irish-language feature film ''[[Poitín (film)|Poitín]]'' starring [[Niall Tóibín]], [[Cyril Cusack]] and [[Donal McCann]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;A Separate Irish language Television Channel? by Margaret O'Connor, Dublin City University&lt;/ref&gt;

The three writers proposed small temporary buildings for [[Gaeltacht]] regional television services broadcasting a limited number of hours each night with programming coming from each of the Gaeltacht regions around the country.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] and the Irish government had sought to improve the availability of Irish-language programming on RTÉ services. In 1972, [[RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta]] (RnaG) was set up to provide Irish-language radio services across the country. All radio and television services provided by RTÉ provided some Irish-language programming.

In 1980, a new group called ''Coiste ar son Teilifís Gaeltachta'' (The Committee for Irish-Language Television) was set up. In 1987 they set up the pirate television station Telefís na Gaeltachta, after years of delays, including the sudden death of their technician who was to build the transmitter. Eighteen hours of live and pre-recorded programming was broadcast between 2 and 5 November 1987. The transmitter was built at a cost of [[Irish pounds|IR£4,000]] through donations from local [[Gaeltacht]] communities. In December 1988, further broadcasts were transmitted from three different sites, broadcasting pre-recorded programming.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The movement for a national Irish-language television service continued to gain momentum afterwards. In 1989, Ciarán Ó Feinneadha, one of the members of ''Coiste ar son Teilifís Gaeltachta'', moved to [[Dublin]] and set up a similar organisation in the capital called ''Feachtas Náisiúnta Teilifíse'' (FTN). FTN outlined their demands:

* A television station to be set up in the [[Gaeltacht]] regions serving the [[Gaeltacht]] and Irish speakers across the country.
* It should be linked to RTÉ, but independent from both editorial and organisational points of view.
* A special authority set up to run it with representatives from RTÉ, the Department of Communications, and [[Údarás na Gaeltachta]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

It was also suggested that the cap on advertising on RTÉ be removed and the additional funds be designated for the new services. [[Ray Burke (Irish politician)|Ray Burke]] had limited the advertising minutes on RTÉ a few years previously. Hence, there would be no cost to the Exchequer, and funding would also come from the National Lottery and the television Licence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

FTN suggested two hours of programming each day, with the rest of the broadcast hours used for [[Open University]] type programming.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In the early 1990s, Irish language programmes amounted to only 5% of total programming broadcast by RTÉ, and was reduced significantly during the summer months.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Programmes included ''[[Echo Island]]'' for children, and current affairs programme ''Cúrsaí''. Before the birth of TG4, RTÉ had suggested the use of RTÉ Two's prime-time schedule for Irish-language programming.

The outgoing coalition parties of [[Fianna Fáil]] and the [[Progressive Democrats]] called for the establishment of an Irish language television station in their 1989 [[manifestos]]. Fianna Fáil stated that they would set up an Irish language television service in the Galway Gaeltacht that would service the whole country. The PDs also looked for the setting up of what they called "Teilifís na Gaeltachta". The Green Party's manifesto from 1987 also called for the establishment of such a channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://michaelpidgeon.com/manifestos/byelection.htm|title=: :Irish Manifestos : :|work=michaelpidgeon.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140208202243/http://michaelpidgeon.com/manifestos/byelection.htm|archivedate=8 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fianna Fáil]] entered into coalition with [[Labour Party (Ireland)|The Labour Party]] in 1993 and as part of their programme for government they included the setting up of TnaG. Taoiseach [[Albert Reynolds]] appointed [[Michael D. Higgins]] as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the responsibility for broadcasting moved to his department. This government left office in 1994 and was replaced by the [[24th Government of Ireland|Rainbow Coalition]]. The new programme for government also sought to launch TnaG as the 3rd channel. Michael D. Higgins remained as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht under Taoiseach [[John Bruton]]. TnaG launched in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://michaelpidgeon.com/manifestos/pfgs.htm|title=: :Irish Manifestos : :|work=michaelpidgeon.com}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On the air===
The total cost in establishing the transmission and links networks, and the construction of the station's headquarters in the [[Connemara]] [[Gaeltacht]], was IR£16.1 million. Annual running costs increased from IR£10.2 million in 1996 to IR£16 million in 2001, and €30 million in 2006.

[[File:Tnag425x250.jpg|thumb|left|TnaG Logo 1996 to 1999 at launch]]

In fewer than six months from the launch of Teilifís na Gaeilge, almost 65% of Ireland's television sets were able to receive the channel and the nightly audience had risen to 250,000 viewers. Three months later, in May 1997, independent research revealed that the station was able to attract audiences of 500,000, or 68% of television sets in Ireland, for at least one hour's viewing per week.

Very significant assistance in non-monetary terms comes from RTÉ which is required to provide over 360 hours of programming annually at no cost to TG4. It was not until 1996 that TnaG came on air. Their aim, initially, was to show one hour of Irish-language programming each night, increasing to two hours by 1999.

Initial criticisms of the planned station came from journalist [[Kevin Myers]] who derided TnaG as a [[white elephant]], calling it 'Telefís De Lorean', in a reference to the ill-fated [[DeLorean Motor Company]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.herald.ie/entertainment/tv-radio/the-cheers-27889128.html The cheers], ''[[Evening Herald]]'' 17 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/letters/trinity-of-errors-1.64888 TRINITY OF ERRORS?], ''[[Irish Times]]'', July 6, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the Irish postal service, [[An Post]], celebrated ten years of the Irish-language station with a commemorative stamp. The station also launched a book entitled ''TG4@10: Deich mBliana de TG4'' (Ten Years of TG4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galwayindependent.com/local-news/local-news/tg4-book-celebrates-milestone/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130123225915/http://www.galwayindependent.com/local-news/local-news/tg4-book-celebrates-milestone/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 January 2013 |title=TG4 book celebrates milestone |date=22 October 2008 |publisher=Galway Independent |accessdate=7 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April 2007, Teilifís na Gaeilge became an independent [[state-sponsored bodies of the Republic of Ireland|statutory corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0004/sec0044.html#partvi-sec44|title=Broadcasting Act, 2001|work=irishstatutebook.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] president Peter Quinn became first chairman of the corporation.

RTÉ holds a share in [[Euronews]], meaning TG4 could no longer broadcast the service.

On 1 July 2007, TG4 was accepted as a new member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]].

In 2008, TG4 became a founding member of [[World Indigenous Television Broadcasters Network]] (WITBN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.witbn.org/?page_id=129#linkmaoritv |title=WITBN |publisher=WITBN |date= |accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 July 2009, the [[Broadcasting Act 2009]] was signed into law. Many of the provisions of the Act relating to RTÉ also apply to TG4, with the station being subject to regulation from the new Broadcasting Authority of Ireland once the relevant provisions are commenced. The Act also changed the English-language title of the Chief Executive of TG4 to "Director-General" in line with RTÉ, and in the Irish language from "Ceannasaí" to "Ardstiúrthóir".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/corp/foir/foir.asp |title=AISEOLAS |publisher=TG4 |language=Irish |accessdate=1 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611234139/http://www.tg4.ie/corp/foir/foir.asp |archivedate=11 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been three Chief Executives of TG4, [[Cathal Goan]] (former [[Director-General of RTÉ]] from 1996 to 2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/about/goanc.html |title=Director-General – Cathal Goan |publisher=RTÉ Press Office |accessdate=1 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814005521/http://www.rte.ie/about/goanc.html |archivedate=14 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his successor Director General, [[Pól Ó Gallchóir]] (2000 - 2016).

==Operation==
{{Main article|Teilifís na Gaeilge (corporation)}}

The daily Irish-language programme schedule is its central service, broadcasting approximately 2.5 hours a day of new Irish-language programming, with an estimated 2.5 hours a day of repeated Irish-language programmes. Currently, RTÉ supplies TG4 with one hour a day of Irish-language programming. The remainder of the TG4 schedule is made up of acquisitions from other broadcasters particularly from US broadcasters.

Operating as a publisher and broadcaster, TG4 invests up to €20m annually in original indigenous programming from the independent production sector in Ireland. The Irish-language soap opera ''[[Ros na Rún]]'' is one of its most popular programmes, and it also commissions a relatively large number of documentaries.

===Scheduling===
During the first two years of TnaG, the service provided a "blocked" schedule. A distinct language schedule was created in line with their commitment to provide two hours of Irish-language television each day. Children's television ran from 17:00 to 18:00, while the prime time Irish-language block began at 20:00 and ended at 22:30 each night. In 1998, the channel began experimenting with their prime time schedule (due to low audience figures and pressure from independent producers). The prime time block was reduced by 30 minutes, ending at 22:00, while they tested Irish-language programming in late night slots after English-language programming, this schedule increased the audience for Irish programmes that followed English programmes. A new "hammocking" schedule was introduced. "Hammocking" is a term used in public service broadcasting meaning that shows with low audience appeal are placed between programmes with high appeal, thus increasing audience share for weaker programming. In 1999, the channel was renamed as TG4. The main aim of its new schedules was to provide "national resonance"{{clarify|post-text=Please explain this term|date=November 2011}} and to compete with [[BBC Two]] and [[Channel 4]] for Irish audiences.&lt;ref name="MacDubhghaill"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/mercator/images/UinsionnMacDubhghaill.pdf |title=Harry Potter and the Wizards of Baile na hAbhann: Translation, subtitling and dubbing policies in Ireland's TG4, from the start of broadcasting in 1996 to the present day |last=MacDubhghaill |first=Uinsionn |publisher=ABER.ac.uk |accessdate=11 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129192352/http://www.aber.ac.uk/mercator/images/UinsionnMacDubhghaill.pdf |archivedate=29 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

TG4 lost its language-driven schedule and replaced it with a stronger audience-driven schedule, with key audiences delivered at key times. TG4 aims to be a mainstream channel for a niche audience. This new scheduling provided TG4 with a strong increase in audience share during the first six months of the newly re-branded channel, rising from 1% to 2% and, by 2005, TG4 had become the eighth most watched television channel with 2.4% audience share, just below BBC Two and Channel 4, and well ahead of [[Sky One]].&lt;ref name="MacDubhghaill" /&gt;

===Budget===
The [[Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources]] reduced TG4's grant-in-aid from the exchequer to €32.25m for 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/assets/files/TB2010-B.pdf |title=TG4 Annual Report |publisher=TG4 |accessdate=5 August 2011 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, TG4 spent €15,469,000 on commissioned programming and €7.5 million on acquired shows. The latter consisted mainly of children's programmes which are dubbed into Irish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/docs/TB2006-B.pdf TG4 Annual Report 2006]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

TG4 has had a share of the Irish television market of some 3%,&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, Colum. [http://www.independent.ie/opinion/editorial/time-to-call-a-halt-to-the-lip-service-behind-tg4-success-26415784.html "Time to call a halt to the lip service behind TG4 'success'"], ''The Independent (Ireland)'', 27 August 2006. Accessed 10 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; with an average daily viewership of 730,000. TG4 provide their viewing figures each week on their website. Currently TG4's top ten programmes have ranged from 10,000 to 100,000 viewers, but their top shows have reached as high as 250,000. Like other television services TG4 achieves their highest viewing figures with sporting events.&lt;ref name="tg4.ie"&gt;[http://www.tg4.ie/leir/luch.asp] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626124520/http://www.tg4.ie/leir/luch.asp |date=26 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Saint Patrick's Day 2009, live coverage of the All-Ireland Finals in the AIB Club Championships on TG4 achieved very high audience ratings for the channel. Twenty five percent of afternoon television viewers on St. Patrick's Day were tuned into TG4. Over 1.1m viewers tuned on TG4 during the day, giving it an overall 8.2% national daily share and placing it in third place in the national daily viewing table for the first time ever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tg4.ie/corp/pr/2009/0319-1.asp] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322054828/http://www.tg4.ie/corp/pr/2009/0319-1.asp |date=22 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other major ratings successes for the channel include the All Ireland Ladies Football Final with 21% of all viewers tuned to that broadcast.
A series of [[Westerns]] has also proven very popular. On 25 April 2010, TG4's coverage of the [[National Football League (Ireland)|Allianz Football League]] Finals in [[Croke Park]] saw them become the most watched channel, with 650,000 viewers watching some of the games. The Division One final had an average audience of 220,000 viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/pr/2010/0427-1.asp |title=VIEWING FIGURES FOR GAA BEO – ALLIANZ FOOTBALL LEAGUE FINALS 2010 |date=27 April 2010 |publisher=TG4 |accessdate=3 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511212953/http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/pr/2010/0427-1.asp |archivedate=11 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most popular programmes included: [[Glór Tíre]] ([[country and western]] reality competition) – 90–110,000; Rásaí na Gaillimhe (political comedy drama); [[Ros na Rún]] (soap opera), GAA Beo (GAA sport) – 50–100,000; [[Fíorscéal]], Cogar (documentary); [[Seacht]] (university drama); [[Nuacht TG4]] (news); [[7 Lá]] (weekly review); [[Paisean Faisean]] (dating programme), Feirm Factor (reality television); and An Jig Gig. These have had an audience reach of 3% to 12% of the total viewing audience, or 40,000 to 100,000 viewers.&lt;ref name="tg4.ie"/&gt;

==Programming==
{{Main article|List of programmes broadcast by TG4}}
TG4 has nurtured a reputation for innovative programming in film, arts, drama, documentaries, and sports. Much of TG4's programming is subtitled in English. The station has a [[teletext]] service called ''[[Téacs TG4]]''. Programmes broadcast on Saorview (not Sky or internet) are at times also subtitled in Irish.

===Imported programming===
TG4 broadcasts many popular US shows ranging from dramas to comedies. 

====As TnaG====
In the lead up to the transmissions of TnaG in the autumn of 1996, RTÉ tested transmissions with airings of ''[[Fawlty Towers]]''. The TnaG service provided little in the way of imports except for children's programming. TnaG provided airings of QVC during daytime hours. TnaG aired ''[[Northern Exposure]]''. They also dubbed into Irish a number of European, Welsh and Scottish programmes.

====As TG4====
TnaG re-branded in 1999 as TG4 and with this came a fresh schedule which included more imported programming. Highly critically acclaimed US programming such as ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]'', ''[[Nip/Tuck]]'' and ''[[The Wire]]'' aired on the channel. During this time the extended out their range of adult and children's programming. Cula 4 na N-Og began airing from 07:00 for pre-school children with programmes such as ''Tar ag Spraoí Sesame'', ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'' and ''[[Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!]]'', Cula 4 airs ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', ''[[Ben 10]]'', ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', and others. In 2006 a strand called Ponc began airing with teen programming such as ''[[Pimp My Ride]]'', ''[[MTV Cribs]]'', ''[[8 Simple Rules]]'', ''[[America's Next Top Model]]'', ''[[What I Like About You (TV series)|What I Like About You]]'' and ''[[South Park]]''. Other series aired on the channel include ''[[Army Wives]]'', ''[[Cold Case (TV series)|Cold Case]]'',''[[Gossip Girl (TV series)|Gossip Girl]]'', ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'', ''[[The Starter Wife (miniseries)|The Starter Wife]]'', ''[[True Blood]]'', ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'', ''[[Vampire Diaries]]'', ''[[Without a Trace]]'', ''[[Carnivàle]]'', ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', ''[[Eve (U.S. TV series)|Eve]]'', ''[[Everwood]]'', ''[[Invasion (U.S. TV series)|Invasion]]'', ''[[Lipstick Jungle (TV series)|Lipstick Jungle]]'', ''[[The O.C.]]'', and''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]''.

TG4 often premieres such shows before other European broadcasters.
TG4 previously held a long-term agreement with HBO to air the majority of their programmes on the channel. With the launch of [[Sky Atlantic]] in 2011, they now hold first rights to Irish and UK broadcasts of HBO shows. This means TG4 now broadcasts HBO programming at a much later date than in the past. TG4 held first rights to ''[[The Wire]]'', ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]'', ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'', ''[[Generation Kill]]'', ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'', ''[[True Blood]]''. They also held an agreement with [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] to air ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' until the series concluded.

In Autumn 2013, the broadcaster started moving away from US imports instead focusing on successful European drama series from the Nordic countries. On 28 August 2013, TG$ announced its new schedule for autumn/winter 2013.&lt;ref name="tg4.ie1" /&gt; which relied on imports from internationally-acclaimed Nordic dramas such as [[Arne Dahl (TV series)|''Arne Dahl'']] from [[Sweden]], [[The Bridge (Danish/Swedish TV series)|''The Bridge'']] co-produced in Sweden and [[Denmark]] and Danish drama [[Borgen (TV series)|''Borgen'']].&lt;ref name="tg4.ie1"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.tg4.ie/press/docs/TG4-PDF-Schedules/TG4-Autumn-2013-B.pdf |title=Autumn 2013 |publisher=TG4 |access-date=2013-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908121347/http://www.tg4.ie/press/docs/TG4-PDF-Schedules/TG4-Autumn-2013-B.pdf |archive-date=2013-09-08 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; US imports include new seasons of ''[[Nashville (2012 TV series)|Nashville]]'', ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' (final season), ''[[True Blood]]'' and new dramas ''[[Justified (TV series)|Justified]]'' and ''[[Boss (TV series)|Boss]]''.&lt;ref name="tg4.ie1"/&gt;

TG4 continued to air ''Two and a Half Men'' up to the departure of [[Charlie Sheen]], when [[RTÉ Two]] began airing the series.

===News and current affairs===
All of TG4's news and current affairs programming is provided by [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] free of charge to the channel. In 1996 ''Nuacht TnaG'' started broadcasting from the TnaG Newsrooms in Baile na hAbhann. From 13 July 2009 all television broadcasts of ''[[Nuacht RTÉ]]'' broadcast from the Baile na hAbhann studios.&lt;ref name="RTÉ's 'Nuacht' Moves to West Coast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iftn.ie/?act1=record&amp;only=1&amp;aid=73&amp;rid=4282318&amp;tpl=archnewshome&amp;force=1|title=RTÉ's 'Nuacht' Moves to West Coast - The Irish Film &amp; Television Network|work=iftn.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main news anchor for ''Nuacht RTÉ'' is [[Siún Nic Gearailt]], who was the main news anchor for TG4 from 2002 to 2004, before moving to RTÉ.&lt;ref name="independent.ie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/tv-radio/heres-the-news-rtes-nuacht-shifts-base-to-west-coast-1818889.html|title=Here's the news RTÉ's Nuacht shifts base to west coast|work=Independent.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nuacht TnaG'' initially was broadcast at 22:00 each night, later moving to 20:00 and finally to 19:00 where it currently remains. From 1996 to 1998 [[Gráinne Seoige]] was the main news anchor for the channel, in 1998 she moved to [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]] to launch their main evening news where she remained until 2004. In 1998 [[Ailbhe Ó Monachain]] became TG4's main news anchor. With the rebranding of TnaG as TG4 the news service also renamed ''[[Nuacht TG4]]''. In 2004 [[Eimear Ní Chonaola]] became TG4's main news anchor. Since September 2010 Nóiméad Nuachta (News Minute) has broadcast each week day at 13:55.

Each Tuesday Night [[Páidí Ó Lionáird]] hosts their Current Affairs flagship show ''7 Lá'' (7 Days), the name derives from RTÉ's original Current Affairs programme ''7 Days''. Every Sunday night Eimear Ní Chonaola presents ''Timpeall na Tíre'', a round up of all the major stories of the week.

During the summer months they provide ''Féilte'' presented by Sinéad Ní Loideáin and Bríd Richardson. It takes a similar format to RTÉ's Nationwide, reporting on Festivals around Ireland during the summer months.

TG4 provides live coverage of [[Dáil Éireann]] each Wednesday and Thursday morning; as well as live coverage of the proceedings of key Dáil Committees from time to time.

TG4 has also provided coverage of the 1997, 2002, 2007, 2011 and 2016 general elections, coverage of European and local elections 2004, 2009 and 2014 and coverage of the annual national Budgets, and coverage of [[Údarás na Gaeltachta]] elections.

During the night TG4 airs a simulcast of [[France 24]] live from Paris.

===Sports===
The channel extensively covers Irish sports, such as the secondary [[Gaelic football]] and [[hurling]] competitions and club championships, and women's Gaelic football (it also broadcasts [[Pro14]]). These are events which generally do not appeal to a mass audience, but have a reasonably loyal following. Many of the sports that TG4 provide coverage to are sporting events that other Irish Broadcasters would not usually be interested in, they have gained a reputation for providing coverage to minority sporting events and repeat coverage to Rugby and Gaelic games under their programming strand ''Rugbaí Gold'' and ''GAA Gold'', showing highlights of classic games from the archives. ''[[Seó Spóirt]]'' broadcasts a round up of the weeks sporting news with a selected panel, it is hosted by [[Dara Ó Cinnéide]]. TG4 provided coverage of [[Volvo Ocean Race]] when it arrived in Galway in May 2009.&lt;ref name="VOLVO OCEAN RACE LIVE FROM GALWAY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/pr/2009/0518-1.asp |title=VOLVO OCEAN RACE LIVE FROM GALWAY |date=18 May 2009 |accessdate=2 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218210500/http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/pr/2009/0518-1.asp |archivedate=18 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====GAA====
Since 2000 TG4 have sponsored [[ladies' Gaelic football]]'s All-Ireland competition under the name ''[[All-Ireland Senior Ladies' Football Championship|TG4 Ladies Football All-Ireland Championships]]'' (''Craobhacha TG4 i bPeil Na mBan'').&lt;ref name="TG4 Press Office"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/pr/2010/0705-1.asp |title=LADIES FOOTBALL &amp; TG4 CELEBRATE 10 YEAR MILESTONE |date=5 July 2010 |publisher=TG4 Press Office |accessdate=11 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027171638/http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/pr/2010/0705-1.asp |archivedate=27 October 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have provided live coverage of the men's Gaelic football league and round-up of the men's football and [[hurling]] championships during the summer months with their GAA round up programme called ''GAA'' – followed by the year it is broadcast, for example in 2011 it was called ''GAA 2011''. They also provide live coverage of the Under 21 All-Ireland competitions and club competitions. In late 2010, TG4 began to broadcast a new handball show, entitled ''The GAA Handball Show''.

====Rugby====
They previously had exclusive rights to show Magner's Rugby League from 2001 to 2004. In 2004 the Irish rights were sold to [[Setanta Sports]], where it was broadcast exclusively from 2004 to 2010. In 2010 TG4 won back the rights for [[Pro14|Pro12]] rugby union with [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]], [[BBC Northern Ireland]], [[S4C]] and [[BBC Alba]].&lt;ref name="Clutton"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/club/7813469/Celtic-Rugby-secure-improved-broadcast-deal-for-Magners-League-coverage.html|title=Celtic Rugby secure improved broadcast deal for Magners League coverage|last=Clutton|first=Graham|date=9 June 2010|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=9 June 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 TG4 took a major coup in taking away exclusive highlights of the Heineken Cup and Amlin Challenge Cup from RTÉ Sport. This led to TG4 having Live coverage of the new Pro14, which is what the Celtic League was rebranded in 2011 as well as highlights of the top matches in European rugby.

On top of this they bought Irish-language rights to the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]] whereby they had lucrative rights to re-run matches from the Rugby World Cup 2011 in the afternoon. Therefore, Setanta Ireland had all matches live, RTÉ had 13 live matches, including all-Irish matches and every match from the quarter finals onwards. TG4 re-ran all the big matches in the afternoon such as the Ireland v Australia match and England and Welsh match.

In 2014, the Irish language channel received praise for airing the [[Women's Rugby World Cup]]. TG4 provided coverage to all of the Irish matches as well as the final and semi-final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/en/corporate/news-releases/2014/170714.html |title=News Releases - 17.07 - Women's Rugby World Cup to be broadcast LIVE on TG4  - TG4 - Irish language television channel - Teilifis Gaeilge |work=tg4.ie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510040058/http://www.tg4.ie/en/corporate/news-releases/2014/170714.html |archivedate=10 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Football (Soccer)====
TG4 broadcasts highlights programme called ''Olé Olé'' for Spanish [[La Liga]] which it extended to include the [[Scottish Premier League]] in 1997. The series no longer airs on the channel.&lt;ref name="TnaG - One Year Old"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medialive.ie/Comment/tnag.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/19980116050617/http://www.medialive.ie/Comment/tnag.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 January 1998|title=TnaG – One Year Old|date=31 October 1997|publisher=Medialive.ie|accessdate=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
TG4 held rights to [[League of Ireland]] with [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] and [[Setanta Sports]]. They have also broadcast UEFA Cup games in the past. TG4 did broadcast Friday night matches called ''Sacar Beo'' which showed League of Ireland matches and cup matches, but RTÉ and Setanta retain those rights now.

====Tennis====
TG4 broadcast exclusive Irish coverage of the [[Wimbledon championships]] tennis tournament. TG4's coverage of the tournament began in 2005, with their coverage being viewed by on average 300,000 viewers each day in 2008.&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/pr/2009/0620-1.asp |title=TG4'S SUCCESSFUL TENNIS COVERAGE TO CONTINUE WITH WIMBLEDON 2009 |date=20 June 2009 |publisher=TG4 |accessdate=2 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218210514/http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/pr/2009/0620-1.asp |archivedate=18 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RTÉ commonly showed Wimbledon for a number of years before dropping the tournament in 2001. Ireland didn't show Wimbledon for a number of years until TG4 took over the coverage in 2005. This proved popular as coverage has been more than it ever was on RTÉ, and with Connor Niland becoming the first Irish player at Wimbledon in 30 years their coverage continues to grow. TG4'S coverage of the [[French Open|Roland Garros]] Tennis began in 2008, which started with just highlights of everyday and the finals live. This proved popular so now TG4 coverage begins with highlights until the final week of the tournament when live coverage begins.

====Cycling====
TG4 provide live coverage of [[Tour de France]] French cycling. TG4's live coverage of the Tour de France began in 2005.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/pr/2007/0628-1.asp |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130217204423/http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/pr/2007/0628-1.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 February 2013 |title=TOUR DE FRANCE 2007 LIVE AND EXCLUSIVE ON TG4 |date=28 June 2007 |publisher=TG4 |accessdate=2 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====International Rules Series====
TG4 hold the television rights to the [[International Rules Series|International Rules]] 2010/2011 season&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/pr/2010/0601-1.asp |title=TG4 SPONSORS IRISH TEAM AND IS TO BROADCAST INTERNATIONAL RULES FOOTBALL |date=1 June 2010 |accessdate=2 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027171034/http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/pr/2010/0601-1.asp |archivedate=27 October 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2013/14 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaa.ie/about-the-gaa/international-rules/news/2003131137-irish-daily-mail-international-rules-series-2013-launched/ |title=News |work=gaa.ie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530232323/http://gaa.ie/about-the-gaa/international-rules/news/2003131137-irish-daily-mail-international-rules-series-2013-launched/ |archivedate=30 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; TG4 also provide a highlights package of [[Australian Football League]] games.

====Snooker====
TG4 for a number of years showed the Northern Ireland Trophy Snooker event from the Belfast Waterfront Hall. This started in 2005 and they showed every NI Trophy tournament until it was scrapped in 2009. This was advertised as their season of sport which started in 2005 and started with Wimbledon, le Tour de France and finished with the NI Trophy. This was firstly a non-ranking event, then became a ranking event. TG4 were the official broadcaster. Their coverage, ''Snucar Beo'', featured analysis from Irish players such as Fergal O'Brien and Ken Doherty and Northern Ireland players such as Patrick Wallace who were not Irish speakers and would provide analysis in English before the presenter would go back to talking in Irish. This is what usually happens in sports coverage on TG4 where links to cameras, reports and commentary are usually in Irish and interviews and analysis in rugby, football and snooker are usually in English.

===Entertainment===
Since its inception TG4 has provided a huge amount of light entertainment programming to its Irish speaking audience, such as the chat show ''[[Ardán]]'' and the fashion/dating show ''[[Paisean Faisean]]''.

''Cleamhnas'' ("Matchmaker") was TG4's first attempt at a [[wikt:blind date|blind date]] type of show. It was presented by [[Seán Bán Breathnach]] and later by Páidí Ó Lionáird. The audience would be introduced to the contestant looking for love and then to one of their parents (generally the father of a male contestant and the mother of a female contestant), then introduced to three suitors. The father or the mother would then ask the suitors questions about how they would treat their son or daughter. The presenter would then go into the audience to talk to the suitor's friends. It would then be up to the mother or father to choose which suitor would go on a blind date with their son or daughter.

This show ran for a number of years and was eventually replaced by ''[[Paisean Faisean]]'' where three boys/men select clothes for a girl, who would then choose the boy, based on the clothes that they had picked. This show was presented in the first three series by Aoife Ní Thuairisg, and in the fourth series by Blathnáid Nic Dhonnacha and Máiread Ni Chuaig. Máiread was replaced in 2008 by [[Síle Seoige]].

''Eochair An Ghrá'' ("Key to the Heart") started airing in 2008 and is similar in format to MTV's ''[[Room Raiders]]''.

The producers of ''Paisean Faisean'', [[Magma Films]], have since sold the rights to [[Zoo Productions]] who will produce the series for MTV under the title ''[[Style Date]]''.&lt;ref name="MTV Shops for 'Paisean Faisean'"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iftn.ie/news/?act1=record&amp;aid=73&amp;rid=4283010&amp;tpl=archnews&amp;only=1|title=MTV Shops for 'Paisean Faisean'|date=20 April 2010|publisher=Irish Film and Television Network|accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 TG4 aired ''Hollywood Anocht'' ("Hollywood Tonight"), a movie show presented by [[Síle Seoige]].

In 2004 TG4 launched a new strand of programming called ''Síle''. It was presented by Síle Ní Bhraonáin and ran from 17:30 to 19:00 each weeknight. It was similar in format to RTÉ's ''[[Two Tube]]''.

On 24 September 2007, TG4 began broadcasting ''[[South Park]]'' in Irish, on Síle, with the more adult content removed but also made available on Saturday nights. In 2009 Síle was replaced by'[[Cula 4|Ponc]].

They also had a number of quiz shows, including ''90 Seconds''. TG4 is a great way for students in Leaving Certificate or GCSCs or A-Levels who is studying Irish to learn from. It is a great resource and is encouraged by teacher. Research is shown that those who watch or listen to TG4 is deemed to have a better understanding of the language. As well as that, having Gaelic as a language, first or second is shown to better employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/ga/|title=TG4 {{!}} Súil Eile|website=TG4|language=English|access-date=2017-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
TG4 have a long tradition of providing [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish Traditional music]] on the channel. ''Geantraí'' is filmed around Ireland, with coverage of traditional music from many pubs around the country. Repeats of Irish traditional music programmes from RTÉ feature in the schedules such as ''The Pure Drop'' and ''Come West Along the Road''.

TG4 presents a number of six awards for Irish traditional music, celebrating and giving due recognition to the recordings, broadcasts and live performances of the recipients of the awards:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gradam.ie/?page_id=274&amp;lang=en | title= Gradam Ceoil TG4 home page for Irish Music Awards | publisher= TG4 | accessdate = 26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mid-2000s TG4 have provided coverage to [[Country music|Country and Western]] music.

Popular music on the channel started out with ''Ó Bun Go Barr'' ("From Top to Bottom"), which is now known as POP 4 and is presented by Eoghan Mac Diarmada, is Ireland's only Top 40 countdown chart show. It also acts as a chart request show and a launch pad for new and upcoming Irish bands.

Indie music is covered on ''Ar An Imeall'' ("On The Edge"), a spin-off series to TG4 Arts strand ''Imeall'' ("Edge").

On 23 March 2015, TG4 confirmed its participation in the [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2015]]. It is set to organise a national final, produced by [[Adare Productions]], to find its representative at the contest. It will mark [[Ireland in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest|Ireland's]] first participation in the contest and the first time since [[Eurovision Song Contest 1972|1972]] that [[Irish language|Irish]] will be heard at a [[Eurovision (network)|Eurovision event]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.junioreurovision.tv/page/blog?id=ireland_to_debut_at_junior_eurovision_2014|title = Ireland to debut at Junior Eurovision!| publisher = EBU| accessdate = 23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reality television===
''SÓS'' (the Irish for "break", and the use of a pun on "[[SOS]]") was one of TG4s early attempts at reality television. It followed a group of contestants in the bleakness of the [[Connemara]] landscape, left with nothing and to fend for themselves. It was a television version of [[Gay Byrne]]'s radio experiment from the 1980s.

''Ní Gaelgoir Mé'' was TG4's version of [[S4C]]'s successful show, getting celebs to learn Irish for a week. It was presented by Aoife Ní Thuairisg.

In 2003 TG4 launched their search for Ireland's next top [[country and western]] singer. ''[[Glór Tíre]]'' is now into its 6th successful season on the channel. Often landing the top spot on their top ten shows, it has a regular audience of 100,000 viewers.

In 2008 TG4 launched their search for the best farmer in Ireland. ''[[Feirm Factor]]'' had 12 farmers competing with each other to see who was the best. The judging panel consisted of [[Maura Derrane]] (former ''[[Ireland AM]]'' presenter), [[Alan Dukes]] (former Minister for Agriculture) and Seán O Lionaird (dairy farmer from Cork). The second series of ''Feirm Factor'' was broadcast from January to March 2010. Welsh television station [[S4C]] has started broadcasting their own version of the show in 2010, called ''Fferm Ffactor''.

''Underdogs'' searched for the best amateur football team from groups of men and women with no previous experience in Minor or Senior GAA football. The judging panel consisted of Geraldine Feerick, Jarlath Burns and Éamon Ó Muircheartaigh.

TG4 commissioned two reality talent shows for the channel from Adare Productions. ''Glas Vegas'' has a similar format to ''America's Got Talent'' and ''The All Ireland Talent Show''. ''Nollig No. 1'' has a similar format to ''[[You're a Star]]'' as the judges search for a Christmas number one single. The 2008 winner was Mary Lee, she released the single "You'll Never Walk Alone", with the chorus 'as Gaeilge'.&lt;ref name="Mary Lee's winning video"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHU67jJQk4o|title=YouTube|work=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009 another series from the same stable began the search for Ireland's best Irish dancing act, entitled An Jig Gig. The winners of this series were Irish Beats.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160411024451/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rWrUCRepR0]&lt;/ref&gt; A fourth season of ''Glas Vegas'' began in January 2010.

TG4 have broadcast all series of the American version of ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'' with an Irish-language voice over.

In 2015, TG4 launched a new dating show called ''[[Pioc do Ride]]'' where contestants choose a date from three potential partners based only on their car.

===Drama===
In the early years TG4 gained critical acclaim&lt;ref&gt;C.U. Burn won "Spiorad na Féile", at the Panceltic Televisiona and Film Festival 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; for ''[[C.U. Burn]]'', a comedy series about a [[Donegal]] [[undertaker]], and ''Glenn Ceo'', a comedy about a small town [[Garda Síochána|Garda]] station in Donegal.

''[[Ros na Rún]]'' is TG4's long-running soap opera, which broadcast for 35 weeks of the year with two episodes each week. It is now in its 17th season on the channel. It airs Tuesday and Thursday at 20:30, with an [[omnibus (broadcast)|omnibus]] edition at 22:30 each Sunday.

TG4 have also supported many Irish filmmakers with their Lasair short film programme fund.

In 2006 TG4 commissioned ''Teenage Cics'', their first youth drama. Set during the 1980s in the Donegal [[Gaeltacht]], it follows the exploits of young students from Belfast going to the Gaeltacht to learn Irish. This was followed by their successful teen drama ''[[Aifric]]''.

In 2007 TG4 won major critical acclaim for their political satirical comedy ''The Running Mate'' and for the programme ''[[Seacht]]'' which follows the lives of seven college students in [[Belfast]].

Their drama series ''Rásaí na Gaillimhe'' (part funded by the [[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland|BAI]]'s Sound and Vision Fund) was a major hit for the channel, becoming their second most popular show just after ''[[Glór Tíre]]''. Set during the week of the [[Galway Races]], it is a drama-comedy starring [[Don Wycherley]], [[Ruth Bradley]], [[Olga Wherly]], [[Hughie McGarvey]] and [[Owen Roe]].

TG4 broadcast their first supernatural thriller on 13 January 2010. ''[[Na Cloigne]]'' ("Heads") is set in contemporary Ireland and revolves around a young couple (Nuala and Séan). Nuala is an artist with supernatural powers connecting her to the Otherworld and is faced with an adulterous boyfriend. Soon two young women Séan brings home for a nightcap are found dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tg4.ie/clar/cloigne/index.asp] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123010100/http://www.tg4.ie/clar/cloigne/index.asp |date=23 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

TG4 continued with successful drama output with their comedy ''[[An Crisis]]'' ("The Crisis"), and ''[[Crisis Eile]]'' (in 2013). This series has poked fun at the Irish economic downturn and the effects on the promotion of the Irish language. The comedy initially centred around the office of the acting-chairman of ACT (An Chomhairle Teanga/The Language Commissioner) played by Risteárd Cooper as he fought to save the organisations from "[[An Bord Snip]] Nua".&lt;ref name="Iftn.ie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iftn.ie/?act1=record&amp;aid=73&amp;rid=4282951&amp;tpl=archnewshome&amp;only=1&amp;force=1 |title=TG4 Introduces Office Drama 'An Crisis' &amp;#124; The Irish Film &amp; Television Network |publisher=Iftn.ie |date= |accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Corp &amp; Anam'' is a four-part series from TG4 starring Diarmuid de Faoite and [[Maria Doyle Kennedy]] (''[[The Tudors]]''). It was originally broadcast in early 2011.&lt;ref name="Filming Wraps on 'Corp &amp; Anam'"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iftn.ie/news/?act1=record&amp;only=1&amp;aid=73&amp;rid=4283215&amp;tpl=archnews&amp;force=1|title=Filming Wraps on 'Corp &amp; Anam'|date=15 July 2010|publisher=IFTN|accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second series aired on the channel in 2014.

====Praise for TG4 drama====
::"The reality is that Irish-language television dramas, no matter how acclaimed or however many awards they might win, are unlikely to show up in box set form in any DVD mega-store. TG4's viewership ranges from between 2 and 4 per cent of the population, enough to cost a politician an election but far too few viewers to send a show into the top 10 in the television ratings.
::A shame, because there are great things happening in the area. TG4's recent batch of mini-series Rasaí na Gaillimhe, Paddywhackery and Na Cloigne (not to mention Aifric, Seacht and long-running soap Ros na Rún) have featured outrageous plots and wacky characters, and dare to be politically incorrect: they get away with it because they are in Irish."&lt;ref name="The Irish edge in the ratings war"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/2010/0319/1224266583816.html | work=The Irish Times | title=The Irish edge in the ratings war | date=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:: "the first episode of ''[[An Crisis]]'', a new six-parter from TG4, was laugh out loud funny – interspersed with a couple of knowing sniggers."&lt;ref name="Mind your language"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2010/0410/1224268015897.html | work=The Irish Times | title=Mind your language | date=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children's television===
{{Main article|Cúla 4}}

In 1996, TnaG started its children's programming under the strand ''Cullabulla'' (taken from [[Hiberno-English]]). Since then they have renamed and extended the strand as Cúla4.

===Factual===
It also actively commissions documentaries such as the acclaimed and popular ''Amú'' series of travel programmes which launched the career of [[Hector Ó hEochagáin]], one of a number of TG4 presenters who have gone on to success at other channels. Others include newsreader [[Gráinne Seoige]]. As many of these programs are subtitled in English, they are often popular with recent immigrant populations, who find spoken English very fast on Irish produced television, as well as native Irish speakers.

They dub a French-Canadian documentary series under the name ''[[Fíorscéal|Fíor Scéal]]''. ''Nello'' was another well received travel show looking at life in middle America.

They have a documentary strand called ''Cogar''. ''Ealú'' (Escape) was a series which looked at prison escapes around Ireland. They repeat the RTÉ shows ''Leargas'' (a new magazine show) and ''Scannal'' (reports on scandals that hit Ireland).

===Re-dubbed programming===
In the early years of TG4 the service repeated the Welsh teenage drama series ''[[Jabas]]'' which was re-dubbed into Irish from Welsh. They also aired the French cartoon ''[[Bouli]]'' as part of their children's schedule. ''Jabas'' and ''Bouli'' had previously aired on [[RTÉ Television]]. Again the Welsh series ''[[Pris y Farchnad]]'' was translated into Irish under the title ''An Craiceann is a Luach''. In general however TG4 perceived that live action series aimed at adults re-dubbed into Irish was not an attractive proposition even for fluent Irish speakers, as is the cases for many bilingual northern European viewers.&lt;ref name="MacDubhghaill" /&gt;

Since its launch TG4 has significantly increased the number of re-dubbed children's programmes from 70 hours in its first year to 200 hours. TG4 only re-dub cartoons while live action series remain in English, such as the Australian drama ''[[H2O: Just Add Water|H2O]]'' and the American sitcom ''[[Lizzie McGuire]]''. TG4 have re-dubbed all of the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]] into Irish and broadcast them each Saturday from January to March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/en/newsletter/tg4/february-2014.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222173903/http://www.tg4.ie/en/newsletter/tg4/february-2014.html |archivedate=22 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other live action children's movies such as ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'' have been re-dubbed into Irish.

===Film===
TG4 has a broad film policy which features a strong range of both independent and mainstream cinema. The channel places a strong emphasis on Irish films both in the Irish and English languages and European cinema which features films in French, German, Spanish, Italian, [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], among other languages. These films air under the strand ''Le Film''. TG4 regularly broadcast [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] under the strand ''An Western''.

Mainstream Hollywood cinema is represented by films from [[20th Century Fox]], [[Walt Disney Pictures]] and [[Warner Bros.]] among others. TG4 regularly broadcast such films on Tuesday Nights as part of their ''Scannán na Seachtaine'' ("Movie of the Week") strand. They sometimes re-dub children's films into Irish with English subtitles, the most notable being the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' films.

TG4 became the first channel to broadcast in full [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s classic ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', a season of Kubrick's films followed, including the European television premiere of ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]''. It also became one of the first channels in Europe to air the remastered director's cut version of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', even before the UK, as they were still only airing the edited version.

TG4 has created a '''TG4 Films''' department which invests in Irish-speaking films and mainstream Irish films such as the critically acclaimed [[Room (2015 film)|Room]].

===Subtitling and dubbing===
====Adult and prime time programming====
TG4 do not dub live action film or television programming into Irish. Some reality television programming have the English voice over replaced by Irish-language voice over (which is also subtitled in English), however all contestants and presenters are not re-dubbed. In the early years of TnaG the channel broadcast many European programmes with Irish dubbing however this policy has since stopped in favour of US programming in English. Some non-English-language films are also subtitled on teletext page 888 in Irish. Most Irish-language programmes are subtitled on screen in English, however no live programming (such as news and sport) is subtitled into English. Many Irish-language programmes are also subtitled on teletext page 888 in Irish.

====Children's and young people's programming====
Cúla 4, Cúla 4 na nÓg and Ponc do not have subtitles during live introductions. Many of the Irish-language cartoons are subtitled on page 888 for parents. TG4 broadcast all US teen programming in English, while Irish-language programming is subtitled on screen in English. TG4 have re-dubbed a number of Hollywood children's films into Irish.

==TG4 on demand==
As of 2011, TG4's [[video on demand]] (VOD) service is operated by TG4 Player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/ie/tg4-player/tg4-player.html |title=TG4 – Irish language television channel – Teilifis Gaeilge – Féach ar TG4 Beo |publisher=Tg4.ie |date= |accessdate=9 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408224519/http://www.tg4.ie/ie/tg4-player/tg4-player.html |archivedate=8 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the service was supplied by TG4 Beo; this service was launched in 2003 (and more recently in 2010) ahead of most European broadcasters.&lt;ref name="sbpost.ie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbpost.ie/mediaandmarketing/tg4-gets-the-picture-for-revamped-online-player-48202.html |title=The Sunday Business Post |publisher=Sbpost.ie |date= |access-date=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; TG4 Player allows viewers globally to watch TG4 live and watch previously aired programming on demand.

The new service is designed and managed by Nordic telecommunications company [[TeliaSonera]].  For certain programmes, a choice of subtitles in Irish and English is available.  According to TG4, the catch-up service has had 2 million downloads in a 12-month period.

==On-air identity and marketing==
TG4's on screen identity is very different from its counterparts', drawing upon the station's original slogan ''Súil Eile'' ("another view").

Its first idents were under their former name of TnaG. The music on TnaG's early ident sequences was produced by Irish composer [[Oisin Lunny]]. The opening sequence featured a number of Irish scenes from across the Island of Ireland, including Belfast and Dublin, and finished with a lighthouse, the light of which beamed the logo onto the screen. While the longer sequence went out at the beginning of each day and the end of the night, a shorter version went out before each programme. TnaG ran numerous marketing campaigns with this logo. Their main features were the difference of the Irish.One ad featured [[Red Lemonade]]. The slogan used in English was "Because we're Different" followed by the well known Irish slogan "Súil Eile". Another marketing campaign featured the stars of the channel asking the question "What more do you look for from a station?" They would be based at various stations such as train and space stations.

In 1999 with the onset of digital television, TnaG was rebranded as TG4 to strengthen the perception of the brand, from being niche Irish-language-only channel to mainstream channel with Irish-language programmes. The TG4 ident continued with the difference aspect of the channel, that provides an alternative view, the slogan ''Súil Eile'' translates literally as "another eye" but is also a pun in Irish meaning "a different view". The logo takes the G from the original logo, separates it from the T and the T loses its Celtic script look. The promotion of the channel from TnaG to TG4 was done with the use of a caterpillar growing into a butterfly.
During its 1999 rebrand TG4 would now feature a [[Digital on-screen graphic|DOG]] in the top right hand corner on all of TG4's programming, previously a TnaG DOG featured only on [[Oireachtas]] and [[QVC]] broadcasts.

The idents from 1999 to 2004 featured various people playing or messing in the background of the screen before the logo appear with the words Súil Eile below the logo.

In 2004, numerous new idents were developed for the station, featuring fairies, bridges, launderette, cars, wrestlers etc. TG4 promotions now feature the seasons Geimhreadh (Winter), Earrach (Spring), Samhradh (Summer) and Fómhar (Autumn). The opening ad break ident states ''Fan Linn'' ("stay with us") and the ad break ends with ''Seo Linn'' ("here we are"). In Autumn 2010 the season theme was dropped and replaced by a blue cube logo, the idents were updated with the TG4 logo animating up in a different way.

On Saturday 1 September 2012, TG4 launched its autumn scheduled. At this time a new look was introduced, a new ident was introduced and all the miscellaneous presentation was revamped. An updated logo was launched which is now coloured a dark grey. The identity focuses on the theme of Irish folklore including the [[Children of Lir]]. For the first time since the channels launch the on-screen logo is found on the top left hand corner. All the new graphics are created for HD ahead of TG4 HD's launch on UPC on 2 October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/press/index.htm |title=TG4 Autumn Schedule 2014 |work=tg4.ie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904163816/http://www.tg4.ie/press/index.htm |archivedate=4 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In-vision continuity followed by TG4's new generic ident. The generic ident is also used after weather updates when a long ident is not required as the weather presenter acts as a continuity announcer at the end of the forecast announcing the next show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/press/docs/TG4-PDF-Schedules/Fomhar-2012.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916100454/http://www.tg4.ie/press/docs/TG4-PDF-Schedules/Fomhar-2012.pdf |archivedate=16 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Northern Ireland==
TG4 was originally only available in [[Northern Ireland]] via 'overspill' of the terrestrial signal from the [[Republic of Ireland]]. In the 1998 [[Belfast Agreement]] there was provision for TG4 (then TnaG) to be made available in Northern Ireland, along with increased recognition of the Irish language. Similarly, while TG4, along with the [[Republic of Ireland]]'s other terrestrial channels, are carried on [[Sky (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky Ireland]] there, it was not available to Sky subscribers in Northern Ireland until 18 April 2005 or on [[Virgin Media|Virgin Media NI]] until February 2007.

In March 2005, TG4 began broadcasting from the [[Divis]] transmitter near [[Belfast]], as a result of agreement between the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Ireland)|Department of Foreign Affairs]] and the [[Northern Ireland Office]]. However, because of overcrowding on the frequency bands, only a low power signal can be transmitted and reception is still unavailable in many areas, even in parts of Belfast. The channel is, however, available on cable, digital terrestrial television (Freeview) and on to Sky satellite subscribers. It is hoped that the channel can eventually be made available [[free-to-air]] on satellite.

On 1 February 2010, the [[Republic of Ireland]]'s Minister for Communications [[Eamon Ryan]] signed an agreement with the UK's [[Ben Bradshaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0202/1224263582384.html|title=RTÉ and TG4 to be freely available in North in 2012 | work=The Irish Times | date=2 February 2010|accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This agreement enabled viewers within [[Northern Ireland]] to watch [[RTÉ One]], [[RTÉ Two]] and TG4 on a [[free-to-air]] basis as of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0201/communications.html|title=RTÉ News: Ryan signs TG4 agreement with the British government|accessdate=7 February 2010 | date=1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement between both jurisdictions initially also guaranteed viewers within the Republic would be able to view [[BBC One Northern Ireland]] and [[BBC Two Northern Ireland]] on the Republic's free-to-air service [[Saorview]]. A cross-border initiative has always been on the agenda for the [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] in Ireland. However, it was later confirmed [[BBC Northern Ireland]] services will not be made available in the Republic and would be made available on a 'paid for' basis. As of 2018, BBC Northern Ireland services are still unavailable on Saorview.

==Main TG4 analogue UHF transmitters==
None of these transmitters are still in operation. All terrestrial transmissions are now via [[Saorview]] (Ireland) or Freeview HD (Northern Ireland)

'''Tavar Zawacki''' (born 1981) is an American [[abstract art]]ist based in Berlin, Germany.&lt;ref name="BIO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tavarzawacki.com/bio/|title=Biography |publisher=tavarzawacki.com |accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For twenty years (1996–2016) Tavar Zawacki created and signed all of his artworks with his [[street artist]] pseudonym, 'ABOVE'.&lt;ref name="p_155"&gt;&lt;!-- cite book --&gt;Tavar Zawacki, ''Metamorphosis''. Germany: Urban Spree Books, 2017 page155. {{ISBN|978-3-9819026-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 19, Tavar bought a one way flight from California to Paris, France, bringing with him a backpack full of art supplies, all the money in his bank account ($1,500 usd), and a 'rise above your fears' approach to starting his art career.&lt;ref name="BIO"/&gt; Starting in Paris in 2000, Tavar transitioned from painting traditional letter style [[graffiti]] of A-B-O-V-E, to his 'Above arrow' icon that represented his optimistic mentality to 'rise above fears, challenges, and anything holding you back from your goals.'&lt;ref name="BIO"/&gt; During a 20-year period the artworks of ABOVE could be seen in over 100 cities spanning 50 countries around the world.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;*Above:Passport, October 2011. {{ISBN|978-1-937222-03-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, Tavar Zawacki decided to step out of his self-imposed shadow of [[anonymity]], and start creating, and signing artworks with his real birth name -  allowing more freedom of creative exploration, as well as liberation from the arrow icon he has associated himself with.  Tavar Zawacki's painting styles with his large scale mural works, as well as his indoor fine art are characterized by the use of [[hard-edge painting]], [[color field]], [[geometric abstraction]], [[Op art]], and [[Trompe-l'oeil]] painting styles.&lt;ref name="p_155"/&gt; Tavar Zawacki has been showcasing his work in galleries and creative institutions around the world since 2005.&lt;ref name="p_155"/&gt;

== Career ==

=== Early career (1995–2003) ===

Tavar Zawacki was born in the foothills of Northern California in 1981 from two creative [[hippie]] parents who invented his name.&lt;ref name="BIO"/&gt; Tavar was encouraged by both parents at a very young age to express himself through art, and music. At the age of 13 years old, Tavar was introduced to skateboarding and graffiti. Tavar stated 'as a teenager I spent my time after school skateboarding, and painting graffiti on trains at the train yard. I was magnetized towards skateboarding, and graffiti because they were both D.I.Y. and independent ways of expressing myself.'&lt;ref name="BIO"/&gt; 
At age fifteen, Tavar started spray painting the traditional letter style graffiti with his moniker 'ABOVE' on freight trains in California.&lt;ref name="p_155"/&gt; Four years later, Tavar changed from painting traditional letter graffiti to an arrow symbol that pointed 'Above'.&lt;ref&gt;''Graff it'' No. 4, July 2002. (Paris, France)&lt;/ref&gt; Tavar credits an impactful, and pivotal experience where a train he had painted with the letters A-B-O-V-E was leaving the train station and his name was completely illegible due to the increased speed of the departing train. Tavar realized that he needed to find a way for his artwork to connect and be recognized in a fraction of a second.&lt;ref name="p_155"/&gt;

In 2000, at the age of 19, Tavar moved from California to Paris, France. At that time Paris was home to street artists like [[Zevs (artist)|Zevs]], [[Invader (artist)|Invader]], Stak, Honet, and [[Andre (artist)|André]]&lt;ref&gt;''Backspin'' No. 46, July 2003 {{ISSN|1490-6392}} (Berlin, Germany)&lt;/ref&gt; Tavar and the other Parisian artists were part of a movement in street art that was heavily based on characters and logos.&lt;ref name="p_155"/&gt; In 2003, Tavar returned from Paris to California where he introduced his hanging wooden 'Arrow [[Motion (physics)|mobiles]]' from overhead wires. Tavar would later proliferate this hanging process of his 'arrow mobiles' for years to follow.&lt;ref name="p_155"/&gt;

== Travels and artworks ==

=== 2004 ===
[[File:Reno sf 04 005.jpg|thumb|A site-specific wooden arrow mobile that reads "shoe/tree" hung from a tree full of shoes. Nevada, U.S.A. 2004]]
In the summer of 2014, Tavar went on a self-titled "U.S.A. Tour". He drove {{convert|5000|mi}} across the United States hanging 300 plus arrow [[Motion (physics)|mobiles]] in 14 major cities.&lt;ref name="TORONTO NEWSPAPER"&gt;{{cite web|last=Topping |first=David |url=http://torontoist.com/2007/06/tall_poppy_inte_45.php |title=Toronto Newspaper |publisher=Torontoist.com |date=16 June 2007 |accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during Zawacki's self-titled, U.S.A. tour that he introduced elements of [[word play]] by writing a word on both sides of the spinning arrows to suggest a dialog.&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Newspaper"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pro|first=Johnna A.|title=Artists' arrows aim to make you look up|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/local/uncategorized/artists-arrows-aim-to-make-you-look-up-546307/|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=14 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zawacki has declined to respond to questions about how he is able to hang his mobiles so high, saying, "I value and respect that we all have imaginations and for me to interfere with what your imagination would be wrong."&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Newspaper" /&gt;

=== 2005 ===
After finishing the U.S.A. tour the previous year, Tavar returned to Europe in 2005. When asked in an interview why he did not hang his arrow mobiles in Europe after his U.S.A. tour, he responded, "In the United States there are an almost infinite amount of overhead telephone wires and street cables. However I was unsure if the different European countries had many overhead wires like in the United States? I decided instead to make wooden arrow that were able to adhere to the sides of buildings, at elevated heights. During my travels around Europe I was able to in fact see that most of the countries I visited had overhead wires to support the future hanging of my arrow mobiles."&lt;ref&gt;''Pulp'' No. 46, Aug/Sep 2005 (Sydney, Australia)&lt;/ref&gt; Tavar visited 15 countries during his 4-month long European tour, installing around 500 of the larger wooden fabric arrows.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Bant'' No. 31. Feb 2007 (Istanbul, Turkey)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2006 ===
[[File:Arrow Stack 5.JPG|thumb|right|Tavar Zawacki's wordplay arrow mobiles. Every arrow mobile had a word on each side creating a [[sign language]] once installed.  Tavar installed his arrow mobiles in 26 countries around Europe in 2006.]]

After returning to California, Tavar began planning a new tour which he titled the 'Sign Language Tour'. By his own reports, Tavar [[counterfeit]]ed [[Eurail]] tickets for a six-month duration, spanning 26 countries around Europe.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;''Lodown'' No. 58. Oct/Nov 2007 (Berlin, Germany)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Omagiu'' No. 9. June 2007, {{ISSN|1841-4788}} (Bucharest, Romania)&lt;/ref&gt; Tavar's 'Sign Language Tour' focused almost exclusively on his [[word play]] sign language arrow mobiles. Tavar is quoted saying '[[sign language]] is a form of communication using movements instead of sound. I found a lot of charm knowing that the arrow mobiles, once installed, are constantly spinning around. To create a [[dialogue|dialog]] I painted one word on each side of the arrow. [[conceptual art|Conceptually]] speaking, when the wind would spin the arrow mobile there would be a small word play dialog to anyone who looked at it."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; Tavar customized arrows to certain countries language such as French (''J'ai''/''faim'', ''chez''/''vous''), Spanish (''Hace''/''sol'', ''como''/''esta'') German (''uber''/''alle'') and Italian (''ciao/ciao'')."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

=== 2007 ===
In 2007, Tavar expanded from the word play of the previous year by painting larger word play [[mural]]s on the exterior of building facades in [[South America|South]] and Central America. He said in an interview " I wanted to return to painting letters, like the traditional graffiti I did when I was younger, but instead of painting my graffiti name, I wanted to paint word-based art that was [[site specific art|site specific]] and could easily be read and understood.&lt;ref&gt;''Soma'' No. 6 July 2008, (São Paulo, Brasil)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Serie B: second edition No. 18 July 2008 (Madrid, Spain)&lt;/ref&gt; Tavar funded his 'South Central Tour' by working as a waiter in a restaurant in [[Alaska]] for four months in spring 2007.&lt;ref name="Sep 2008"&gt;''Atypica'' No. 32, Sep 2008. {{ISSN|1851-7188}} (Buenos Aires, Argentina)&lt;/ref&gt; His south central tour lasted six months, starting in October 2007 in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, spanning 18 cities in 13 countries, and ending in [[Mexico City]], Mexico in May 2008.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;''DIF'' No. 62, October 2008. {{ISSN|1645-5444}} (Lisbon, Portugal)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2008 ===
[[File:ABOVE 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|"Giving to the poor" stencil in Lisbon, Portugal, addressing the issue of homelessness]]
In September 2008, Tavar traveled to [[Lisbon]], Portugal, where he painted his "Giving to the poor" stencil commenting on the [[social issue]] of [[homelessness]]. Zawacki stated "Every day I walked by this bank [[Automated teller machine|ATM machine]] and this particular homeless woman was sitting in the same place every day begging for money. I found it sadly ironic that just six feet away from here there were people lining up to withdraw money. The sharp social and economic clash inspired me to make this piece."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goabove.com/CUT_IT_OUT.html |title=Cut It Out |publisher=Goabove.com |accessdate=7 September 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100919074156/http://goabove.com/CUT_IT_OUT.html| archivedate= 19 September 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008, Tavar returned to California, when the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NTSE) took a drastic crash, marking a worsening of the [[Great Recession|2008 recession]]. Tavar stenciled on the exterior of a [[Washington Mutual]] building (one of several banks that collapsed during this period) an image of the NYSE bar graph with a downward sloping red line that went all the way down into the street gutter, mimicking the results that occurred just a few days before.

=== 2009 ===
In April, Zawacki created a [[stencil]] mural depicting four children searching for "Easter AIGs" in response to the breaking scandal surrounding [[American International Group]] and the degree to which it profited from the 2008 [[bailout]].

In May 2009, Tavar started another tour of Europe lasting four-months. This tour did not seem to have a title as with most of Zawacki's previous tours. In July, he painted a social and political stencil piece titled 'Bridging The Divide' directly on the [[Berlin Wall]]. The artwork depicted a young girl jumping up, with arm extended trying to grab a [[flower bouquet|bouquet]] of flowers from a person on the opposite side of the Berlin. The painted scene was completed with a smiling guard looking at the young girl jumping. 'Bridging The Divide' was painted on the 20th year anniversary of the [[German reunification]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/5559905 |title=Bridging the divide|via=Vimeo |accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SoldierBerlinArt.jpg|thumb|right|250px|"Bridge the divide" a site specific stencil &amp; installation on the Berlin Wall. Berlin, Germany. 2009]]

In August 2009, Tavar returned from Europe, and moved to [[Portland, Oregon]]. He started a charitable non-profit project involving Portland's homeless population. Tavar was quoted in an interview, "I wanted to address and draw more attention to the homeless crisis here in Portland. I wanted to learn more about this homeless epidemic by listening directly to the homeless community on an individual person to person level. During the month of November, 2009 I rode my bike around Portland wanting to listen to homeless individuals that wanted to share their story and suggestion on what shelters really help out with services as well as where I should donate the money fund raised from this 'Homeless not hopeless' print."&lt;ref name="goabove.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://goabove.com/Homelessnothopeless.html |title=Home Less, Not Hope Less! |publisher=Goabove.com |accessdate=7 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923195317/http://goabove.com/Homelessnothopeless.html |archivedate=23 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2010 ===
In January 2010, just days after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|Haiti Earthquakes]], Tavar flew to [[La Havana]], Cuba, to make a site specific stencil commenting on the recent devastation in the neighboring country of Haiti. Tavar's stencil work was titled 'Help Thy Neighbor' and depicted a young Cuban boy with tire raft, first aid medical kit, and a Haitian flag in hand ready to embark to what is assumed, Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vimeo.com/9452360 |title=Help Thy Neighbor|via=Vimeo |accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French Stencil artist, [[Blek le Rat]], had selected Tavar (then as ABOVE) to exhibit together for Tavar's first duo exhibition of his career at White Walls Gallery in San Francisco on 1 May 2010. This was Tavar's largest body of work exhibited at a gallery at that time in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joseph Lumbroso |url=http://www.whitewallssf.com/blog/2010/04/coming-may-1-2010-blek-le-rat-and-above/ |title=Coming May 1, 2010: Blek le Rat and Above – White Walls, SF – Blog |publisher=Whitewallssf.com |accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a press release from White Walls gallery "The meeting of these two artists is a passing of the torch from the original stencil artist to a younger generation of urban artists following in his legacy. Blek let Rat first pioneered stencils in the early 80s as a bold, attention grabbing form of street art that was never before seen.

In January 2011, Tavar flew to Sydney, to prepare for his first solo show, titled ''Here Today Gone Tomorrow''. In the press release for the exhibition, Tavar said that his older brother had passed away in an accidental car crash just three months prior. He was quoted, "I've been consistently traveling the world and the theme, 'Here Today Gone Tomorrow' applies to how I have been living my [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] for the past ten years. It's hard to say goodbye when traveling, and even harder when you don't even get the chance. I was deeply moved by the loss of my brother to make the new body of artworks that dealt with the fragility of life, death, and how important it is to live each day to the fullest."&lt;ref name="Here today gone tomorrow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curbsandstoops.com/today-tomorrow/|title=Here today gone tomorrow|publisher=Curbsandstoops.com|accessdate=21 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714122254/http://www.curbsandstoops.com/today-tomorrow/|archivedate=14 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The body of work in the exhibition profiled fifteen different celebrities such as; [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[James Dean]], [[Bob Marley]], and [[Princess Diana]], all of which died under the age of 37. [[Screen printing]], and paper [[collage]] mediums were used to recreate the images of the fifteen celebrities assembled on top of an arrow cut from wood.&lt;ref name="Here today gone tomorrow"/&gt;

In October at the height of the global [[Occupy Wall Street]] protest, Tavar flew to Miami, U.S.A. and painted a {{convert|120|foot}} long word play mural that read "Give A Wall St. Banker Enough Rope And He Will Hang Himself." Zawacki's mural incorporated a hanging effigy of a suited banker to the installation. While being interviewed by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', Tavar said "I tried to clothe him and dress him up as if he was what I imagined a Wall Street banker might wear, it was the cherry on the top of the word play installation." He continued to say, "It's extremely shocking which is part of the point as well. I think it is really gone too far, but then again I think it's my retaliation to how far Wall St, has gotten in general. It is shocking to me when I look at these numbers when I see that one per cent of the people have all of the money." Tavar explained that he was inspired by the proverb "If you give a fool enough rope, he will hang himself" and simply adapted it to fit the theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2053904/Occupy-Wall-Street-inspired-artist-hangs-banker-dummy-telephone-wire.html|title=Is this taking the protests too far?

It's extremely aggressive and that's actually the point." His final reply was "Everybody's entitled to their own opinion, and some people will praise it, others will deny it and criticize it, but the point being is that it's getting people talking about the movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/Occupy-Art-Has-Miami-Motorists-Doing-Double-Take-133233768.html|title=Occupy Art Has Miami Motorists Doing Double-Take|publisher=NBC 6 South Florida |accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2012 ===
In February 2012, Tavar traveled to [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, where he painted a mural commenting on the illegal [[blood diamond]] trade. Tavar appropriated the proverb 'Diamonds are a girl's best friend' and painted the message 'Diamonds are a woman's best friend and a man's worst enemy' on the exterior wall of Jewel City, one of the world's largest diamond exporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201205280510.html |title=South Africa: Refurbishments At Jewel City Completed |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site specific statement was {{convert|4|meters}} tall and {{convert|80|meters}} in length, spanning the entire city block.&lt;ref name="SAvid"/&gt;

The story of how Tavar was able to trick the owners of Jewel city to paint such a large controversial statement on the exterior of their building without any trouble was, in the artist's words, a 'jewel heist' of his own.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/04/american-graffiti-artist-boasts-prank-mural-south-africa/ |publisher=ABC News |title=American Graffiti Artist Brags About Diamond Mural Prank|accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tavar said, "I was able to get away with this diamond wall heist because I told the owners I would paint in big letters 'Diamonds are a woman's best friend' on the exterior of their building. The owners loved the idea and all quickly agreed."&lt;ref name="SAvid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arrestedmotion.com/2012/04/video-streets-above-south-africa/ |title=Video / Streets: ABOVE (South Africa) |accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tavar, the owners never came outside to inspect, or question his actions.&lt;ref name="SAvid" /&gt; In an interview with a reporter from [[ABC News]], Tavar said, "I decided to take it upon myself to justify lying as I felt that making this controversial statement seen, and topic of blood diamonds talked about more, would justify my actions. I have justified my lying as I feel it created a powerful social and political piece."&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"/&gt;

[[File:Spain crisis.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A social and political stencil where Tavar addressed the [[Eurozone]] crisis and more specifically Spain's unemployment. Zaragoza, Spain. 2012]]
In September, amidst the [[Eurozone]] financial crisis, Tavar flew to [[Zaragoza]], Spain. He painted a {{convert|120|foot}} long stencil mural of a queue of [[silhouette]]s accompanied by the statement '24% Desempleados' ('24% unemployed' in English) that were waiting in line for the unemployment office. This social, political, and time sensitive mural addressed the hard financial times that Spain was facing with its highest unemployment rate in the world. At the time that Tavar painted this mural 24.6% of Spaniards were unemployed; for under-25-year olds, 53% were unemployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/27/spanish-unemployment-record-high |work=The Guardian |title=Spanish unemployment reaches record high of 24.6%|date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=27 July 2012 |location=London |first=Giles |last=Tremlett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same month of September, Tavar went to [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, to created a [[Time-lapse photography|time-lapse film]] titled ''#Socialmedia''. He painted a message on the wall, then repainted the wall white, only to repaint a new message. He repeated this process of painting new statements over a duration of two days.&lt;ref name="#socialmedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/48736559 |title=#socialmedia|via=Vimeo |accessdate=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tavar's messages were [[sarcasm|sarcastic]] mocks, factual, and confrontational towards society and the uses of [[social media]]. He profiled such social media platforms such as [[:Facebook]], [[:Twitter]], and [[Instagram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/04/above-social-media_n_1854352.html  |title=Above's Short Film '#Socialmedia' Half Mocks, Half Embraces Our Addiction (VIDEO, PHOTOS)  |date= 4 September 2012|accessdate=4 September 2012 |work=HuffPost |first=Priscilla |last=Frank}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, Tavar said that he does not use social media such as Facebook, or Twitter, which allowed him to act as an outsider, looking in on how society uses such social media platforms.&lt;ref name="#socialmedia"/&gt;

=== 2013 ===
In August 2013, Tavar created a time relative stencil titled 'Timing Is Everything' in London, England. The colorful stencil painted on the side of a wall depicted a [[break dancer]] positioned upside down, with his arm extended downwards. At night, the context of the stencil is 'activated' by the street light, thus creating a shadow of the nearby street pole directly onto the wall. The stenciled break dancer is now seen in a newer context of balancing himself on top of the street sign's shadow. In an interview Tavar said, "all of my stencil works exist in a [[Site-specific art|site-specific]] context. I have been searching for this fixed shadow in a high visibility location for the past eight months during my global travels. I finally found the perfect shadow in [[Shoreditch]] area of London."&lt;ref name="Timing Is Everything"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1xrun.com/runs/Timing_Is_Everything  |title=ABOVE 'Timing Is Everything' |accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tavar, the main reason why 'the perfect shadow' was so challenging to find was because it needed to exist in a highly trafficked area of a major city.&lt;ref name="Timing Is Everything_2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlanticcities.com/arts-and-lifestyle/2013/08/street-art-day-breakdancer-comes-alive-after-dark/6459/|title=Street Art of the Day: A Breakdancer Comes Alive After Dark |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reporter from the news blog ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' claimed, "If [[Banksy]] and [[James Turrell]] were ever to collaborate, we like to think Tavar Zawacki would be their [[idea|brainchild]]."&lt;ref name="Huffington Post"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/08/above-street-art_n_3719890.html  |title=Clever Street Art Only Reveals Itself at Night |work = HuffPost|date= 8 August 2013|accessdate=8 August 2013 |first=Priscilla |last=Frank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of Tavar's street works have topics of social or political issues suggested in the artworks. During an interview he commented, "The Timing Is Everything stencil painted in London was void of any political or social message, but what it did have was an interaction with the city, and how things alter from day to night. The stencil shows how timing, and lighting can be the platform, as well as the [[artistic inspiration|inspiration]] for a piece of work."&lt;ref name="Mashable"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2013/08/12/timing-is-everything/  |title=Street Artist Proves Timing Is Everything With Handstand Graffiti |accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tavar closed the interview by saying, "My main intention with this piece is to have people observe, and re-evaluate their surroundings of how literally, timing is everything."
&lt;ref name="Mashable"/&gt;

=== 2014 ===
In June, Tavar was one of the international artists invited to paint at Artscape mural event held in the city of [[Malmö]], Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artscape.se/artists/|title=artists|accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He painted a mural titled [[Metamorphosis]] on an eight-story tall building in a style replicating the color printing process of [[CMYK]]. He explained, "I've been interested for many years now in shapes and colors. The arrow is its own unique shape, and when I overlap this colorful shape using the CMYK color blend process, it allows for new shapes and colors to metamorphosis into something new." Tavar continued saying, "It's about having fun and experimenting. As an artist it's important for me to experiment with my work, otherwise one can become stagnant. Making this mural put the arrow into a new context, giving it room for expansion of a new life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLxtimQisPw |title="Artscape Malmö 2014-Above" On Youtube |via=YouTube |accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, Tavar had a three-month long [[artist-in-residence]] in Detroit, Michigan in preparation for his solo exhibition titled 'Remix'.&lt;ref name="Above breaks down remix opening November 21st"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1xrun.com/runs/Grand_River_-_Original_Artwork|title=Above breaks down remix opening November 21st |publisher=1xrun.com |accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Remix exhibition displayed a variety of different [[laser cut]] wood panels that were then 'remixed', and exchanged into the artwork's final configuration. "The intention for the Remix body of work is to find a balanced [[symbiosis]] between curved and straight lines. The characteristics of the arrow are straight, sharp, angular, and void of any curved elements. My intention is to mix a variety of curved shapes within the straight arrow design, creating a totally new visual appearance."&lt;ref name="Above Remix @ Innerstate Gallery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juxtapoz.com/current/above-remix-inner-state-gallery-detroit|title=Above Remix @ Innerstate Gallery |publisher=juxtapoz.com |accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked the question, 'What strides do you think you have made with this work?' Tavar replied, "The variety of new curved elements from the Remix exhibition allowed me to expand the arrow design into something new and exciting. The emphasis was less on the arrow, and more on the mix of curved, and straight lined shapes. The arrow icon was breaking apart and morphing into new (and exciting) abstract shapes."&lt;ref name="Above breaks down remix opening November 21st"/&gt;

=== 2015 ===

In October 2015 Tavar painted his largest mural to date, a 33-meter tall (108 feet) by 17-meter wide (55 feet) mural titled 'Incognito' in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa as part of the City of Gold Festival.&lt;ref name="An Interview with ABOVE about his latest mural 'Incognito' in Johannesburg"/&gt; Tavar spent ten consecutive days painting the mural and when asked in an interview about his process, challenges, and color choices he stated 'My color selections were predetermined by the relationship of how each color transforms when laid on top of another. This was easy, however, in the designing of the mural I had to constantly move colors and shapes to finally get the final color arrangement you see. The biggest challenge for me during the Incognito mural was ensuring the proportions of the design were correct. I needed precision, and a lot of it.  The lines needed to be sharp and straight. If any line was miscalculated or skewed the design as a whole would suffer. This was my largest hurdle I had to overcome both with mapping it out, and painting it. Later in the interview Tavar said 'What I enjoy most about the Incognito design is the secondary shapes, and colors achieved from the overlapping of each arrow on top of another. There are many fun intersections of color and new shapes that emerge using this style of design. I look forward to exploring more in depth into this style in the future in my indoor and outdoor works.'&lt;ref name="An Interview with ABOVE about his latest mural 'Incognito' in Johannesburg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://instagrafite.com/an-interview-with-above-about-his-latest-mural-incognito-in-joburg%E2%80%8F/|title=An Interview with ABOVE about his latest mural 'Incognito' in Johannesburg |publisher=instagrafite.com/ |accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2016 ===
In March, Tavar Zawacki (still using his former street artist name 'ABOVE') had a solo exhibition in [[Zürich]], Switzerland titled '12 Months'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lin|first1=Amy|title=12 Months With ABOVE the Artist at Galerie SOON|url=https://www.widewalls.ch/above-the-artist-galerie-soon-zurich/|website=Wide Walls|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a section of Tavar's [[artist statement]] he wrote, 'My intention with my recent body of work is to show the viewer a visual portrayal of associations, and experiences I’ve had with each Month. This body of work explores new ways of incorporating my arrow icon into a variety of [[patterns]], configurations, and abstract styles, while using the entire color spectrum as my [[Color scheme|palette]]. My process started with reflecting back on each year, making detailed lists of colors, feelings, and associations I have with each month. I would use my written notes and transform these words into the visual designs of shape and color, you see in each painting.
I aimed to create each work with a unique feeling, while still having a consistency within the body of work. I intended to have my arrow icon act as the supporting role in every month’s composition. My goal is to have the arrow interact, transform, and re-create its shape as much as possible, helping illustrate the emotion and feeling of each month. During my creative process the consistent changing of colors, and emotions of each month both inspired, and challenged me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zawacki|first1=Tavar|title=12 Months|url=http://www.tavarzawacki.com/indoor/#/12-months/|website=Tavarzawacki.com|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2016, Tavar Zawacki served as artist-in-residence of the Quin Arts program at [[the Quin Hotel]] in New York City, furthering his exploration of [[geometric abstraction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zimmer|first1=Lori|title=Art Nerd New York's Top Event Picks for the Week- 7/14-7/20|url=http://www.6sqft.com/art-nerd-new-yorks-top-event-picks-for-the-week-714-720/|website=Art Nerd|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; through colorful multi-layer arrow compositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABOVE AT THE QUIN HOTEL.

It opened on 14 July and was Zawacki's first solo show in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eller|first1=Matthew|title=Tavar Zawacki aka ABOVE Solo Show 07/14/16 at The Quin, NYC|url=https://streetartnews.net/2016/07/preview-tavar-zawacki-aka-above-solo-show-071416-at-the-quin-nyc.html|website=Street Art News|accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2017 ===

In January 2017, Tavar decided to step out of his self-imposed shadow of anonymity, and start creating, and signing his artworks with his real birth name - allowing more freedom of creative exploration, as well as freedom from the arrow icon he had formerly associated himself with. Tavar stated, 'My decision suddenly liberated me, as well as opened up creative ideas to a seemingly unlimited expansion of new opportunities. I see a new foundation to expand upon, free of any artistic restrictions, and my curiosity to push my creative limits to new, higher levels'.&lt;ref name="BIO"/&gt;

Tavar debuted his museum style solo exhibition titled, [[Metamorphosis]] in September, 2017, at Urban Spree Galerie in Berlin.
Metamorphosis' entire body of work was painted on large format canvases, and profiled four different painting styles, [[Op-Art]], [[Trompe l'oeil]], [[CMYK]] and [[Hard-edge painting]].&lt;ref name="Metamorphosis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tavarzawacki.com/metamorphosis|title=Metamorphosis |publisher=tavarzawacki.com |accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tavar described his exhibition, 'Metamorphosis is about transformation from one state into a newer dynamic one. With a lot of brutal honesty, and conviction for growth I was able to take inner inventory of what no longer served me. I was able to let go of the fears that were stifling my creative progression. I was prepared for feeling uncomfortable during this metamorphosis. I was learning how to unblock my personal censors, and be valiant in painting the styles of works I’ve previously been too reluctant to paint.'&lt;ref name="Tavar Zawacki: Metamorphosis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanspree.com/event/tavar-zawacki-metamorphosis/|title=Tavar Zawacki: Metamorphosis |publisher=urbanspree.com |accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tavar Zawacki's Metamorphosis exhibition was the first time in his career that he made, and signed all his works with his real name.&lt;ref name="Tavar Zawacki Goes through Metamorphosis at Urban Spree"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.widewalls.ch/tavar-zawacki-art-urban-spree/|title=Tavar Zawacki Goes through Metamorphosis at Urban Spree |publisher=www.widewalls.ch |accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September Tavar's second book, also titled, Metamorphosis was published. Metamorphosis is a 168-page, hardcover book covering Tavar's last 3 years of creative works, from his seminal 2014 Remix exhibition in Detroit, to his latest and most ambitious show to date at Urban Spree Galerie in September 2017. The book covers all his outdoor murals during that period and illustrates how the artist navigates between his indoor and outdoor works and the influences thereof.&lt;ref name="Tavar Zawacki: Metamorphosis (Signed Copies)"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanspree.com/shop/en/street-artgraffiti/1000-tavar-zawacki-metamorphosis.html|title=Tavar Zawacki: Metamorphosis (Signed Copies) |publisher=www.urbanspree.com |accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passport: 156 page book documenting the artworks and travels of Tavar Zawacki in over 60 countries from 2004 to 2010. California: Zero+ Publishing, 2011.

Artist [[Shepard Fairey]] wrote the introduction in Passport saying "I first encountered Above's art on the streets of Paris in early 2003. His large scale trademark arrows were painted on roll down gates, trucks and storefronts with impressive coverage throughout the city. Above is extraordinarily driven. To paraphrase [[Radiohead]], "ambition can make you look pretty ugly," but in Above's case, his ambition makes the streets look very engaging. I am very impressed by Above's diligence, but after I got to know him and his artwork more, I began to realize that his output is not evidence of selfish ego, but of a lust for life, a utopian life, where his generosity, and curiosity, and his pursuit of creativity and social-consciousness have led him around the world making more friends than enemies.

Above made the time to act as tour guide for me and my wife and our two young daughters in a city he knows well and we didn't. The gesture made me greatly value Above's friendship and reinforced my belief that what you give is what you get. The Karma Police are not coming for Above even if the police vandal squad is."&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- cite book --&gt;Above, ''Above:Passport''. California: Zero+ Publishing, 2011.page08.

'''Teatro Farnese''' is a [[Baroque]]-style [[Theater (structure)|theatre]] in the [[Palazzo della Pilotta]], [[Parma]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Paolo| last=Landriani| year=1830| title=''Storia e Descrizione de' Principali Teatri Antichi e Moderni''| editor = Dottore Giulio Ferrario | pages=142–150 | publisher=Tipografia del Dottor Giulio Ferrario, Contrada del Bocchetto N. 2465|id= |url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/004309091| authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was built in 1618 by [[Giovanni Battista Aleotti]]. The idea of creating this great theater comes from the Duke of Parma and Piacenza [[Ranuccio I Farnese, Duke of Parma|Ranuccio I Farnese]]. The theatre was almost destroyed by an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[strategic bombing|air raid]] during World War II (1944). It was rebuilt and reopened in 1962.

Some claim this as the first permanent [[proscenium]] theatre (that is, a theatre in which the audience views the action through a single frame, which is known as the "proscenium arch").&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 550&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuritz, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Bridge''''' is a [[Lithography|lithograph]] print by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] artist [[M. C. Escher]], first printed in March 1930.

It depicts a bridge connecting two sheer cliffs. On the top of the left hand cliff is a city. The chasm between the two cliffs is narrow but plummets out of view. In the distance is another outcrop with a city built on top. Both the rock and the architecture on this third outcrop are darker in colouration than in the foreground. The buildings appear to be modelled partly after southern Italian architecture. The rock is in blocky formations that appeared often during Escher's Italian period and it is possible that the village seen is [[Assisi]].

'''''The Emerald Forest''''' is a 1985 [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] set in the [[Brazil]]ian [[Amazon Rainforest|Rainforest]], directed by [[John Boorman]], written by [[Rospo Pallenberg]], and starring [[Powers Boothe]], [[Meg Foster]], and [[Charley Boorman]] with supporting roles by Rui Polanah, [[Tetchie Agbayani]], [[Dira Paes]], Estee Chandler, and [[Eduardo Conde]]. It is allegedly based on a true story, although some dispute this. The film was screened out of competition at the [[1985 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/928/year/1985.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Emerald Forest |accessdate=8 July 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In promoting the film for awards competition, Boorman created the first [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] [[screener (promotional)|screener]]s, but the film received no Academy Award nominations.&lt;ref name=LosAngelesTimes /&gt;

==Plot summary==
Bill Markham ([[Powers Boothe]]) is an engineer who has moved to [[Brazil]] with his family to work on a large hydro-electric dam. The film opens on Markham, his wife Jean ([[Meg Foster]]), his young son Tommy (William Rodriguez), and his daughter Heather (Yara Vaneau) having a picnic on the edge of the jungle, which is being cleared for the dam's construction. Tommy wanders from the cleared area, and an [[Uncontacted peoples|Indian]] (Rui Polanah) from one of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous tribes]] known as the Invisible People notices Tommy and abducts him. Markham pursues the pair into the forest but does not find his son.

Ten years later, the dam is nearing completion. A 17-year-old Tommy ([[Charley Boorman]]), now called Tomme, has become one of the Invisible People. Tomme marries a woman named Kachiri ([[Dira Paes]]) and undergoes a [[vision quest]], where his [[Power animal|spirit animal]] tells him he must retrieve sacred stones from a remote spot deep in the jungle. Chief Wanadi, the man who abducted and adopted Tommy, warns him that the quest will be dangerous, as it will take him into the territory of the cannibalistic Fierce People.

Meanwhile, Markham has finally identified his son's abductors. Markham and a journalist decide to set off bottle rockets to attract the attention of the Invisible People. Instead, they attract the Fierce People and are captured. Armed with a [[CAR-15]] carbine, Markham is able to defend himself long enough to talk with Chief Jacareh (Claudio Moreno) who releases Markham for the night, promising to hunt him down in the morning, while the Fierce People kill and butcher the journalist. Close to dawn, Markham stumbles into Tomme collecting the sacred stones. The two recognize each other just as the Fierce People arrive, shooting Markham in the shoulder. Tomme and his father manage to escape, leaving Markham's carbine behind. In the care of the Invisible People, Markham recovers from his injuries and undergoes a vision quest, waking up back at the dam's construction zone.

Jacareh, recognizing the destructive power of Markham's carbine, visits a seedy brothel at the edge of the construction zone and arranges to exchange women for ammunition and more guns. Tomme and his friends return to their village to discover that many of the Invisible People have been murdered and all the young women abducted by the Fierce People. Desperate for help, Tomme navigates the city to his parents' condo, and Markham agrees to help rescue the women from the brothel.

That night, Markham initiates a shootout in the brothel while Tomme and his friends release the enslaved women from captivity. In the ensuing battle, the Fierce People kill several members of the Invisible People, including Chief Wanadi. Tomme is later sworn in as the new chief of the tribe. Markham warns Tomme that the almost-completed dam will end the tribe's way of life, but Tomme insists that the Invisible People are safe. During a storm, Markham places demolition explosives at key points along the dam, but the detonator fails.  The storm, summoned by Tomme and his people, has been raging for two days by now, and the flow is enough to breach the dam.  Markham watches its destruction with mixed emotions.

The film ends with Tomme and Kachiri sitting at the swimming hole near their village in the jungle, watching the members of their tribe splash and play.

==Reception==
As of 2018, ''Rotten Tomatoes'' assigns it an 81% approval rating out of 16 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_emerald_forest/ |title=The Emerald Forest |last= |first= |date= |website=Rotten Tomatoes |publisher= |access-date=March 13, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Emerald Forest'' was designated a Critics' Pick by a ''[[New York Times]]'' reviewer, who called it "compelling and richly atmospheric".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/reviews/movies/critics-picks |title=New York Times' Critics' Picks |last= |first= |date= |website=New York Times |publisher= |access-date=March 13, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a negative review, [[Paul Attanasio]] of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' called it "long, wheezy tribute to the Noble Savage" and more of "a National Geographic special" than a proper film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1985/07/03/its-rough-in-the-jungle/eb781990-c5e0-44fc-9006-dc564b11cd1a/ |title=It's Rough in the Jungle |last=Attanasio |first=Paul |date=July 3, 1985 |website=The Washington Post |publisher= |access-date=March 13, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was nominated for 3 BAFTA Awards, for Cinematography, Make Up, and Score.

==Inspiration==
The film was promoted as "based on a true story". Critic [[Harlan Ellison]] in his book ''Harlan Ellison's Watching'' wrote that attempts by SCAN&lt;ref&gt;The Southern California Answer Network (SCAN) is a library reference / research company.&lt;/ref&gt; to get background information on the real story revealed that Rospo Pallenberg's original screenplay was based on several stories,&lt;ref name="ellison"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ellison |first=Harlan |author-link=Harlan Ellison |title=Harlan Ellison's Watching |publisher=Underwood |year=1989 |pages=407–409}}&lt;/ref&gt; including an article in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' about a Peruvian labourer whose child had been abducted by a local Indian tribe and located sixteen years later almost fully assimilated.&lt;ref name=latimes1972&gt;{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/684744122.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Oct+8,+1972&amp;author=LEONARD+GRE&amp;puENWOODb=Los+Angeles+Times+(1886-Current+File)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=E10&amp;desc=Long+Hunt+for+Son+Ends+in+Success,+but--- |first=Leonard |last=Greenwood |title=Long hunt for son ends in success, but — |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=8 October 1972 |page=10 |archiveurl=http://www.nativeamericanfilms.org/ef-truestory.html |archivedate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pallenberg's agent told SCAN that while director [[John Boorman]] had said that he read the original ''L.A. Times'' article, in fact, he had not, but was simply working from Pallenberg's screenplay. According to SCAN, Boorman told NPR's ''All Things Considered'' that the son was still living with the tribe in 1985, and identified the tribe as "the [[Mayoruna]]", yet detailed anthropological studies of that tribe do not mention an adopted outsider.&lt;ref name="ellison"/&gt;

An additional possible source for ''The Emerald Forest'' is the book, ''Wizard of the Upper Amazon'', first published before 1975.&lt;ref name=CordovaRios1975&gt;{{cite book |title=Wizard of the upper Amazon: The story of Manuel Cordova-Rios |year=1975 |author-first=Manuel |author-last=Cordova-Rios |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=0395199190 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story is an account of Manuel Cordova-Rios’ kidnapping when he was a teenager working for rubber cutters in the Amazon in the early 1900s. He was taken by a [[Matsés|group of Native Amazonians]] to their remote Indian village. These Amazonians were fiercely independent and had fled into the interior because they refused to live under the subservient conditions imposed by the rubber barons at that time. Cordova-Rios was incorporated into their tribe and describes a life strikingly similar to the one depicted in ''The Emerald Forest''.&lt;ref name=CordovaRios1975/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Wizard of the upper Amazon: The story of Manuel Cordova-Rios |year=1993 |author1-first=Manuel |author1-last=Cordova-Rios |author2-first=F. Bruce |author2-last=Lamb |publisher=North Atlantic Books |isbn=978-0938190806 |edition=3rd Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to Ellison's conclusion, a contemporaneous January 1985 review in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine states up front that the movie is "[b]ased on an uncredited true story about a Peruvian whose son disappeared in the jungles of Brazil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117790680.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 |title=The Emerald Forest |magazine=Variety |date=1 January 1985 |access-date=13 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Los Angeles Times'' article also mentioned that the Peruvian child had at the time decided as an adult to stay with his adoptive tribe.&lt;ref name=latimes1972/&gt;

==First Oscar screeners==
Because Embassy Pictures was struggling in the year of ''Emerald Forest'''s release, the film did not receive a traditional "For Your Consideration" advertising campaign for the [[58th Academy Awards|1985 Academy Awards]]. Boorman took the initiative to promote the film himself by making [[VHS]] copies available for no charge to [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|Academy]] members at several [[Los Angeles]]-area video rental stores. Boorman's idea later became ubiquitous during [[Hollywood]]'s award season, and by the 2010s, more than a million Oscar [[screener (promotional)|screener]]s were mailed to Academy members each year. However, ''Emerald Forest'' itself received no nominations from Boorman's strategy.&lt;ref name=LosAngelesTimes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-oscar-screeners-20180301-story.html |title=The Oscar screener was invented by accident, and other secrets of an awards season staple |last=Miller  |first=Daniel  |date=March 1, 2018  |website=The Los Angeles Times  |publisher= |access-date=March 13, 2018 |quote="The Emerald Forest" didn't get any Oscar nominations — but Boorman's gambit made an impact: He effectively invented the movie screener, now an integral part of Hollywood's awards season apparatus. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In 1925, Korea is [[Korea under Japanese rule|ruled by Japan]], and 13-year-old [[Princess Deokhye]] – the last princess of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] – is forced to move to Japan to attend school there. She misses her home, and after she finishes school she makes several attempts to return, but is prevented by pro-Japanese general Han Taek-soo. One day, she is reunited with her childhood friend, Kim Jang-han, an officer in the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese army]] who is also part of the [[Korean independence movement]]. Kim plans a secret operation to move Deokhye and her brother [[Yi Un]] to Shanghai, site of the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea]]. This attempt fails after Han Taek-soo discovers the plan, and Deokhye and Kim are separated, losing contact with each other. She is forced to marry Count Takeyuki So in 1931, and develops [[schizophrenia]] after giving birth to their daughter the following year. Kim becomes a newspaper reporter and eventually finds Deokhye in a Japanese mental hospital, decades after they were separated. He then persuades the [[Government of South Korea|South Korean government]] to allow her in the country, and in 1962, Deokhye is finally able to return to her homeland.

==Production==
Director [[Hur Jin-ho]] decided to make a film about [[Princess Deokhye]] after watching a documentary about her on television; he could not forget the scene showing the princess reuniting with her [[court ladies]] at the Gimpo Airport, when she was finally allowed to return to Korea after 38 years in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Hur Jin-ho talks finding muse other than heartbreak: Director says life of the ‘Last Princess’ was too emotional not to tell | author = Sung So-young | work = [[Korea JoongAng Daily]] | date = 5 August 2016 | accessdate = 5 August 2016 | url = http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=3022203 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tragic life"/&gt; The film's screenplay was co-written by Hur, Lee Han-eol, and Seo Yoo-min, based on the best-selling novel ''Princess Deokhye'' (2009) by Kwon Bi-young.&lt;ref name="kjd review"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Korea's 'Last Princess' comes alive in new film | author = Sung So-young | work = [[Korea JoongAng Daily]] | date = 29 July 2016 | accessdate = 29 July 2016 | url = http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=3021892 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The story is a mix of fact and fiction, as Kim Jang-han is a fictional character.&lt;ref name="tragic life"/&gt; Princess Deokhye's story had never been made into a film before this.&lt;ref name="career-defining"&gt;{{Cite web | title = 'Last Princess' is career-defining film, says actress Son Ye-jin | last = Doo | first = Rumy | work = [[K-Pop Herald]] | date = 3 August 2016 | accessdate = 6 August 2016 | url = http://kpopherald.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=201608031725415911108_2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2012 [[Busan International Film Festival]] (BIFF), Hur's film project was selected to receive co-production development support from the [[Korean Film Council]]. Pre-production for ''The Last Princess'' began in 2014. In August 2015, [[Son Ye-jin]] and [[Park Hae-il]] were announced to be starring in the film.

Son accepted the role of Princess Deokhye with no hesitation.&lt;ref name="gave her all"/&gt; In an interview, she said "I know how hard it is to find a film that places such importance on a female character and deals with her life's journey...I have no hope that I'll come across another film like this for the rest of my career."&lt;ref name="career-defining"/&gt; However, she felt "tremendous pressure" portraying a historical figure, and it was her first time playing such a role. At a press conference, she said of the role: "The most difficult part about acting out Princess Deokhye was to think over and over what the princess would have done whenever I was confronted with the discrepancy between the existing archives and the film-adaptation version."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Actress Son Ye-jin reveals difficulties in playing historical figure | date = 29 June 2016 | accessdate = 29 July 2016 | url = http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2016/06/29/14/0200000000AEN20160629007800315F.html | publisher =''[[Yonhap News Agency]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; After seeing the completed film, she said she had no regrets about her performance.&lt;ref name="gave her all"/&gt;

''The Last Princess'' opened in third place at the box office on August 3, and rose to the number one spot during the weekend of August 5–7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Korean films top the local box office: ‘Princess’ and ‘Chromite’ lead way; ‘Busan’ sells 10M tickets | author = Sung So-youn | work = [[Korea JoongAng Daily]] | date = 9 August 2016 | accessdate = 9 August 2016 | url = http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=3022348 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the weekend, 1.2 million tickets were sold across 961 screens, accounting for 24 percent of all ticket sales in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = 'The Last Princess' dethrones 'Operation Chromite' at box office | date = 8 August 2016 | accessdate = 9 August 2016 | url = http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2016/08/08/80/0200000000AEN20160808006000315F.html | publisher =''[[Yonhap News Agency]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film earned US$12.4 million in a five-day period (August 3–7), with 1.7 million tickets sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kil|first1=Sonia|title=Korea Box Office: ‘Princess’ Reigns Over Weekend, ‘Squad’ Opens Third|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/asia/korea-box-office-princess-reigns-over-weekend-squad-opens-third-1201832502/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=9 August 2016|date=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film grossed US$35.4 million in South Korea.&lt;ref name="kobiz"&gt;{{Cite web | title = The Last Princess (2016) | work = KoBiz | publisher = ''[[Korean Film Council]]''| accessdate = 29 July 2016 | url = http://www.koreanfilm.or.kr/jsp/films/index/filmsView.jsp?movieCd=20150979 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It grossed {{USD|40.35 million}} worldwide.&lt;ref name="numbers"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Deok-hye-ong-ju-(South-Korea)#tab=summary|title= The Last Princess (2016)|accessdate= 30 December 2016|work= [[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
The film received generally positive reviews by critics. Sung So-young of the ''[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]'' praised the film for being "interesting enough to hold the audience's interest from beginning to end", even though she felt Hur's imagination went too far in several scenes. She said major events from Princess Deokhye's life were portrayed well, and the film's biggest virtue was how it made audiences want to know more about her.&lt;ref name="kjd review"/&gt; Woo Jae-yeon, writing for [[Yonhap]], said the film confirms Hur's reputation as a director who "has a proven track record in weaving a love story from a delicate web of emotions that each character experiences". Woo also praised Son Ye-jin's "outstanding" performance for her portrayal of "the unfathomable depths of the emotional ups and downs of Deokhye."&lt;ref name="swept away"&gt;{{Cite web | title = (Movie Review) Life is swept away in historical turmoil in 'The Last Princess' | author = Woo Jae-yeon | date = 29 July 2016 | accessdate = 29 July 2016 | url = http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2016/07/29/0200000000AEN20160729005200315.html | publisher =''[[Yonhap News Agency]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumy Doo of ''[[The Korea Herald]]'' said the film was a "refreshing change from typical dramas about the Japanese occupation of Korea, which are usually intent on delivering a message of patriotism, and tend to be heavy-handed in their emotional arcs". Doo appreciated Hur's "muted approach" in his handling of the character's emotions, and praised the performances of the two leads, saying Park Hae-il showed "deft skill and subtlety" and Son Ye-jin proved herself a "sensitive and technically refined performer".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = [Herald Review] 'The Last Princess' a refreshing historical drama | first = Rumy |last = Doo | work = [[The Korea Herald]] | date = 31 July 2016 | accessdate = 2 August 2016 | url = http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160731000275 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yun Suh-young of ''[[The Korea Times]]'' praised the film for being "engaging, entertaining and moving", rare for a historical film, and complemented Hur's "masterful" direction and the cast's "superb" acting.&lt;ref name="tragic life"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Tragic life of Korea's last princess on screen | author = Yun Suh-young | work = [[The Korea Times]] | date = 2 August 2016 | accessdate = 2 August 2016 | url = http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/culture/2016/08/141_210956.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Theater St. Gallen''' is a [[performing arts center]] for opera, musical, ballet, and theatre in [[St. Gallen]], [[Switzerland]], and considered to be the oldest professional [[theatre]] in Switzerland.&lt;ref name=TSG&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theatersg.ch/wDeutsch/theater/unser_haus/geschichte.asp?navid=110 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411044410/http://www.theatersg.ch/wDeutsch/theater/unser_haus/geschichte.asp?navid=110 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 11, 2009 |title=Unser Haus |author=Theater St. Gallen|language=German |accessdate=April 12, 2009}} &lt;/ref&gt;  It is a Swiss [[Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance|heritage site of national significance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.babs.admin.ch/de/aufgabenbabs/kgs/inventar/a-objekte.html |title=Kantonsliste A-Objekte |year=2009 |work=KGS Inventar |publisher=Federal Office of Civil Protection |language=German |accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the monks [[Tutilo]] and [[Notker the Stammerer|Notker]] already inspired briefly lay theatre in St. Gallen during the Middle Ages, theatre did not flourish for a long time because of moral concerns. In the early 19th century interest in theatre was reawakened. After the first performance on October 14, 1801 in modest surroundings, a "Theater Stock Company" was founded in 1805 to support a local professional theatre group. When they needed a larger place for their performances, the architect [[Johann Christoph Kunkler]] built a theater into which the group moved in 1857. This "Kunkler-Bau" remained the home of the formerly called ''Stadttheater St. Gallen'' for 111 years until 1968.&lt;ref name=TSG/&gt; The building was then demolished. 
[[File:St Gallen Theater Treppe.jpg|left|thumb|The staircase]]

The current building was designed by the Swiss architect [[Claude Paillard]] and inaugurated with Beethoven's ''[[Fidelio]]'' on March 15, 1968.&lt;ref name=TSG/&gt; The building houses two stages, the larger one allows 742 persons and the studio 100 persons to attend.

With the construction of the new building, the stock company was replaced by a consortium with participation of the town of St. Gallen and its canton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaterschweiz.ch/index.php?id=245| title=Theatre in Switzerland |author=Theaterschweiz |language=German |accessdate=April 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surrounding communities thereafter joined in the venture. The "Genossenschaft Konzert und Theater St. Gallen" ("Cooperative for concert and theatre of St. Gallen") is since 2000 the supporting organization for the orchestre and theatre of St. Gallen. The "Sinfonieorchester St. Gallen" therefore provides orchestral support for operas and musicals. 

Each year about 20 new productions are introduced. Among them, in 2009, the theater featured the world premiere of ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo (musical)|The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', a musical by [[Frank Wildhorn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagblatt.ch/aktuell/kultur/kultur/Im-Musical-Himmel;art624,1267733|title=Im Musical-Himmel|publisher=St. Galler Tagblatt|date=February 24, 2009|language=German|accessdate=April 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gans, Andrew.[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/126412.html Borchert to Star in World Premiere of Wildhorn's Count of Monte Cristo"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425033936/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/126412.html |date=2009-04-25 }}, playbill.com, February 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre's 390 annual performances are seen by about 140,000 attendees.

'''Tournai fonts''' are a type of [[baptismal font]] made from blue black [[limestone]] during the 12th and early 13th centuries in and around the Belgian town of [[Tournai]] by local masons.{{sfn|Drake (1999), p. 11}} There are seven complete examples in England{{sfn|Harris, p. 439}} and a disputed number in Europe: eighty according to one source,{{sfn|CRSBI, St Peter, Ipswich}} or fifty in Northern France and Belgium and two in Germany according to another.{{sfn|Wadsworth}}

A sculptural tradition, centred around Tournai, arose in the [[Scheldt]] valley from the 11th century onwards.{{sfn|Hourihane, p. 287}} This was characterised by its use of low [[relief]] (which was a useful feature when a sculpture was transported),{{sfn|Schwartzbaum, p. 90}} hard lines and the depiction of minute detail, these features arising from the hardness of the material used from the 12th century; Tournai marble.{{sfn|Hourihane, p. 287}} As a sculptural style it is distinguished from the contemporary style of [[Mosan art]], and it was used in sculpture in both [[Ghent]] and [[Bruges]].{{sfn|Hourihane, p. 287}} The designation "Tournai font" is employed to identify fonts made by local masons who worked the stone, as opposed to at least two other schools of masons who also sculpted the stone.{{sfn|Drake (1999), p. 11}}

==Construction==
The fonts are all sculpted from a single massive block{{sfn|Harris, p. 439}} of blue black [[Carboniferous Period|carboniferous]] limestone, known as "Tournai marble" (while not a true [[marble]], it was so called  as it is capable of taking a polish{{sfn|Drake (1999), p. 11}}), quarried from the banks of the River Scheldt. This seam of limestone runs from around [[Boulogne]] through the Scheldt and [[Meuse]] regions at [[Tournai]] and [[Namur]] to Aachen, and has been quarried and sculpted since [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times.  One of these quarries, at [[Veldt-lès-Tournai]], is still in operation.{{sfn|Drake (1999), p. 11}} As a stone, Tournai marble was prized for its high polish, which made it appear black, and it was popular not only for fonts but also for elements of ecclesiastical architecture (capitals, bases and colonnettes), as well as for tombslabs.{{sfn|Schwartzbaum, p. 89}} 

Each font weighs approximately {{conv|2|tonne|ST kg lb}}{{sfn|Drake (1999), p. 11}} and was probably carved before transport;{{sfn|Tudor-Craig, p. 152}} this can be inferred not only from the fact that the stylistic elements (of people, flora and fauna) on all the fonts in England and the continent show a resemblance, and because the fonts themselves are all of the same shape,{{sfn|Schwartzbaum, p. 90}} but also because transport was difficult and expensive, and there would have been little point expending money and effort taking such heavy blocks to a distant site and then discarding up to half the block as waste material.{{sfn|Drake (1999), p. 11}}

===Complete fonts in churches===
The font at Onze Lieve Vrouwekerk, [[Dendermonde]] (Belgium) illustrates the story of [[Saint Peter]]'s denial of [[Jesus]].{{sfn|Wadsworth}} The font at [[Meise|Wolvertem]] (Belgium) is unusual in being round, square being the usual shape.{{sfn|Wadsworth}} There are also complete Tournai fonts in Blessy (France), [[Deftinge]] (Belgium), [[:fr:Deux-Acren|Deux-Acren]] (Belgium), [[Guarbecque]] (France), [[Hove, Belgium|Hove]] (Belgium), [[Lichtervelde]] (Belgium), [[:fr:Église Saint-Pierre de Montdidier|Montdidier]] (St Pierre) (France), [[:fr:Église Notre-Dame de La Neuville de Corbie|La Neuville-lès-Corbie]] (France), [[Noordpeene]] (France), [[Saint-Just-en-Chaussée]] (France), [[Vermand]] (France), [[Zedelgem]] (Belgium) and [[Zillebeke]] (Belgium).{{sfn|Drake (2010), Appendix 2 Belgium: Mosan and Tournai Fonts}}

====Bases and fragments====
Bases of Tournai fonts are in churches in [[Bourghelles]] (France), [[Évin-Malmaison]] (France), [[:fr:Froyennes|Froyennes]] (Belgium), [[Herentals]] (Belgium), [[Ichtegem]] (Belgium), [[Meilegem]] (Belgium), [[Ribemont]] (France), [[Roubaix]] (France) and [[St Sauveur]]{{dn|date=December 2017}}&lt;!--[[:fr:Saint-Sauveur (Belgique)]]?--&gt;.{{sfn|Drake (2010), Appendix 2 Belgium: Mosan and Tournai Fonts}}  There are fragments of Tournai fonts in churches in Baardegem, Comines, Ere, Escanaffles (building material), Lampernisse, Lessines (St Pierre) (building material), Nivelles and Soignies.{{sfn|Drake (2010), Appendix 2 Belgium: Mosan and Tournai Fonts}}

===In museums===
Complete fonts are at [[Châlons-sur-Marne]] (cathedral) and Gondecourt, a base at Pervijse, and fragments at Ghent (St Bavon), Kontich, and Rotselaer.{{sfn|Drake (2010), Appendix 2 Belgium: Mosan and Tournai Fonts}}

===Disputed examples===
Disputed examples of Tournai fonts are at Chéreng, [[Compiègne]] (St Antoine), Hautmont, and Laon (cathedral). The fragment at Le Tréport is also disputed.{{sfn|Drake (2010), Appendix 2 Belgium: Mosan and Tournai Fonts}}

===Lost===
Formerly complete Tournai fonts, now lost, were at the following locations: Gallaix; Neuf-Berquin; St Venant; and Vimy.  At Stalhille, a recorded base is lost, as are fragments at Binche, Spiennes, and Spiere.{{sfn|Drake (2010), Appendix 2 Belgium: Mosan and Tournai Fonts}}  St Venant, destroyed in World War I, had the most complete cycle of the [[Passion of Christ]] known on any Romanesque font.{{sfn|Drake (2010), p. 9, note 20}}

===Hampshire===
For their transport to England they were exported under the protection of a caravan organised by the Tournai guild known as the Charité-St-Christophe.{{sfn|Schwartzbaum, p. 89}} and taken either over land to Boulogne and across the Channel, or down the Scheldt.{{sfn|Schwartzbaum, p. 90}} On account of their weight and the difficulty of land transport, their ultimate destinations were locations on the south or east coast, or places accessible by river.{{sfn|Harris, p. 439}}
The Charité-St-Christophe had commercial links with Winchester, and probably brought the four Hampshire fonts to the county,{{sfn|Wadsworth}} most likely under the patronage of [[Henry of Blois]].{{sfn|Tudor-Craig, p. 152}}&lt;!-- not all singing from the same hymnbook here --&gt;

====All Saints, East Meon====
The font of c. 1130–40{{sfn|Pevsner and Lloyd, p. 200}} was probably a gift to the church from [[Henry of Blois]], Bishop of Winchester.{{sfn|Wadsworth}} The friezes on its sides depict the creation of [[Adam and Eve]] and the Temptation (north face); the [[Expulsion from the Garden of Eden]] and Adam being shown how to dig (east face); and various animals, birds and dragons on the south and west faces.{{sfn|Pevsner and Lloyd, p. 200}} 

====St Peter's, St Mary Bourne====
This is the largest of the English fonts{{sfn|Harris, p. 439}} and, according to Pevsner, "one of the most splendid".{{sfn|Pevsner and Lloyd, p. 494}} There are arches on coupled colonnettes on the north and west faces; on the east and south faces are trees of life with grapes. The top of the font is circled with reeds; the corners display two birds drinking and leaves, forming an "oriental motif".{{sfn|Pevsner and Lloyd, p. 494}} A new base for the font was made in 1927 in Tournai.{{sfn|Harris, p. 439}}

====St Michael's, Southampton====
Located in the south-west corner of the church, the font's decoration is to Pevsner "far more elementary than that on the font at Winchester".{{sfn|Pevsner and Lloyd, p. 523}} Each face has three medallions, on eleven of which "grotesque figures"{{sfn|Pevsner and Lloyd, p. 523}} are carved, mostly with wings, with a single man carved on the twelfth. The pillars that support the font are not made of Tournai marble but of Purbeck marble, and are renewed.{{sfn|Pevsner and Lloyd, p. 523}} 

====Winchester Cathedral====
The font – the "most famous" of the Tournai fonts in England{{sfn|Pevsner and Lloyd, p. 683}} – illustrates scenes from the life of [[Saint Nicholas|St Nicholas of Myra]] on two faces, with three roundels of birds on the third and a roundel of a quadruped with birds on either side on the fourth.{{sfn|Pevsner and Lloyd, p. 683}} It is the only font in the cathedral, and is located in the nave,

===Lincolnshire===
St Lawrence's, [[Thornton Curtis]], and [[Lincoln Cathedral]], where the font is located on the south side of the nave. It has leaves on the corners of the base, with the faces showing "quadrupeds, mostly monstrous",{{sfn|Pevsner, p. 163}} and palmettes on the top. [[Alexander of Lincoln]], Bishop of Lincoln, has usually been credited with the commissioning of the font in Lincoln Cathedral, but recent scholarship has suggested that it was commissioned by his successor, [[Robert de Chesney]].{{sfn|King, pp. 18–19}}

===Suffolk===
====St Peter's, Ipswich====
The font is from c. 1170-90, resting on a 15th-century base, and is at the west end of the nave.{{sfn|CRSBI, St Peter, Ipswich}} One each face of the font are three lions [[Charge (heraldry)#Attitude of animals|statant gardant]], with pillars separating them. It has been argued that the position of the lions on each face, with the lion at each anglew facing outwards, was to avoid the lions pointing their rear ends towards the altar, but this has been questioned.{{sfn|CRSBI, St Peter, Ipswich}} The font used to be located close to the west respond of the south nave arcade.{{sfn|CRSBI, St Peter, Ipswich}}

===Fragment===
A fragment of the bowl of a Tournai font was found in Ipswich and is now in [[Ipswich Museum]].{{sfn|CRSBI, St Peter, Ipswich}} It has been suggested that it came from the nearby [[Priory of the Holy Trinity, Ipswich|Christchurch priory]].{{sfn|Blatchley and Haward, p. 3}}

===Disputed examples===
The original list of seven fonts was made by Allen and Kitchen in an 1894 article. There have subsequently been three suggested additions:
:*[[Romsey Abbey]], Hampshire. This existence of this font, apparently destroyed in a fire of 1850, has never been verified.{{sfn|Drake (2010)}} 
:*[[St Mary the Virgin, Iffley]], Oxfordshire. This black limestone font is unlike any of the known Tournai fonts.{{sfn|CRSBI, St Peter, Ipswich}}
:*St Michael's, [[Boulge]], Suffolk. Pevsner claims this is a Tournai font, albeit one with the relief statuary chipped off, but H. Munro Cautley states that it is Purbeck marble from around 1210.{{sfn|Harris, p. 439}} Drake claims that the finish is too smooth for it ever to have had statuary.{{sfn|Drake (2010)}}

==United States==
A fragment of a Tournai font is in the museum at [[Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania]].{{sfn|Drake (2010), Appendix 2 Belgium: Mosan and Tournai Fonts}}

[[File:The sculpture Unbearable.JPG|thumb|''Unbearable'' exhibited in Paris ]]

'''''Unbearable''''' is a bronze sculpture by the Danish artist [[Jens Galschiot]]. It consists of a graph showing the global fossil fuel carbon emissions, and an impaled polar bear. The sculpture was finished in 2015 and exhibited in Paris during [[COP21]]. The sculpture is made in cooperation with [[WWF Denmark]].

==Overview==
The polar bear is impaled on an oil pipeline, which is in shape of a graph showing the cumulative global fossil fuel carbon emissions. The polar bear is in natural full size and made in copper. The graph shows the emissions since year 0. The graph is 20 meters long, and until 1850 not rising. Then in 1850 the human consumption of fossil fuels rises. The graph end in year 2015 five meters above ground impaling the [[polar bear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/sep/01/insiders-guide-odense-hans-christian-andersen|title=An insider's guide to Odense: much more than Hans Christian Andersen|first=Thomas Gam|last=Nielsen|date=1 September 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The sculpture was funded by [[WWF Denmark]], a [[Crowdfunding]] campaign and [[Jens Galschiot]]. The campaign was crowdfunded on [[Kickstarter]] and gathered 12.000 euros &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ymlp.com/zwPPJv|title=Unbearable exhibited in the heart of Paris.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lef-online.be/index.php/11230-art-climate-and-crowdfunding-and-an-impaled-polar-bear|title=LEF-Online - Art, Climate and Crowdfunding - and an impaled polar bear|first=Joeri|last=Willekens|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
The sculpture was exhibited at a climate march in [[Copenhagen]], where thousands of demonstrates attended. After the march the sculpture was exhibited at [[Cité Universaitre]] in [[Paris]] at [[COP21]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grist.org/climate-energy/check-out-these-9-climate-art-projects-that-are-wowing-people-in-paris/|title=Check out these 9 climate art projects that are wowing people in Paris|date=11 December 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?257623/Visualization-of-impacts-of-Arctic-climate-change-unveiled-at-Paris-climate-talks|title=Visualization of impacts of Arctic climate change unveiled at Paris climate talks|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Jens Galschiot]] the sculpture was scheduled to be exhibited in front of the Danish parliament in April 2016.&lt;ref name="ymlp.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ymlp.com/zOrQbP|title=Impaled Polar Bear in front of Danish Parliament - memorial for Mexican artist - Polar Bear army in NY|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polar Bear Army==
[[File:Polar bear army.JPG|thumb|Jens Galschiot's polar bear army during demonstration in Paris]]

[[Jens Galschiot]] made a happening in Paris during [[COP21]], where he and his employees were in [[polar bear]] costumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insideclimatenews.org/news/12122015/photos-paris-cop21-climate-change-protest-red-lines|title=Photos: Thousands Protest in Paris to Urge Climate Action|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The happening was an effort to create a focus on human consumption of fossil fuel. [[Paris]] was in [[state of emergency]] at the time of the happening.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europe-solidaire.org/spip.php?article36559&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jens Galschiot]] and his employees were therefore not allowed to wear masks. The polar bear army participated in many climate changes demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-governments-fossil-fuels|title=Grand promises of Paris climate deal undermined by squalid retrenchments|first=George|last=Monbiot|date=12 December 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Jens Galschiot]] the polar bear army will participate in a happening in [[New York City]] together with the president of the United Nations General Assembly [[Mogens Lykketoft]].&lt;ref name="ymlp.com"/&gt;
