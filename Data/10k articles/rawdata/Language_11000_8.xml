'''Action assembly theory''' ('''AAT''') is a [[communication theory]] that emphasizes [[psychology|psychological]] and social influences on human action. The goal is to examine and describe the links between the [[cognition]] and [[behavior]] – how an individual's thoughts get transformed into action. It was developed by John Greene.&lt;ref&gt;Em Griffen. ''A First Look at Communication Theory''. "Chapter 11: [http://www.afirstlook.com/docs/action.pdf Action Assembly Theory of John Greene]." McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Action assembly theory describes the production of behavior in two essential processes: 
* the retrieval of procedural elements from long term memory, and
* the organization of these elements to form an output representation of action to be taken.
* Action Assembly Theory (AAT) seeks to explain message behavior (both verbal and nonverbal).  AAT is a communication theory that emphasizes psychological and social influences on human action.  The goal is to examine and describe the links between the cognition and behavior-how an individuals thoughts get transformed into action.  According to the psychology wiki, AAT describes the production of behavior in two essential processes: the retrieval of procedural elements from long term memory, and the organization of these elements to form an output representation of action to be taken. For example, assembly is considered a top-to-bottom process that begins with more general strategy and goes to a more specific idea about communicating the specific message.

== Retrieval of procedural elements ==
The idea of procedural record is at the center of action assembly.  These records contain information about action, outcomes, and situations.  These records are locked in the individual’s memory where it remembers past behaviors for the future.

A procedural record is at the center of action assembly. It is a personal nugget of truth about past behavior stockpiled for future use, part of an individual's memory system in which information about how to execute various behaviors is stored. Procedural records contain information about action, outcomes, and situations; for example, traveling at excessive speed (action) in a zone that specifies low speed limit (situation)can result in the issuance of a ticket (outcome).

Procedural records have different levels of strength. Some are mere scratches that barely leave a trace in the mind, while others are well-worn into long-term memory.

A central aspect of the action assembly theory is specifying the processes that link procedural records to behavioral representations. The activation process is the process used to select particular procedural records. For example, if a parent disciplined a child for stealing, all procedural records relevant to this goal and situation would be activated. In turn, if a common disciplinary tactic was to take away toys and play items, a procedural record of that would be activated quickly.

== Organization of procedural elements ==
It is also important to consider the process of assembly, which organizes records into a behavioral representation. For example, assembly is considered a top-down process that begins with general strategy and goes to more specific ideas about communicating the specific message.

Action assembly theory has been useful for topics such as speech onset latency and hesitations during speaking. These concepts are assumed to be indicators of cognitive processing. Another use is the study of planning – individuals who plan more effectively are more fluent than those do not, because planning reduces the cognitive load at the time of message production.

When an interaction situation has multiple goals, the theory finds increased demands on an individual's information processing capacity. Assembly of goals may be difficult because a specific goals may be incompatible with behaviors associated with the other goals. In turn, multiple goal messages involve more speech hesitations and latencies. The utilization of Action Assembly theory can provide a clear opportunity to plan or assemble  goals more careful to mitigate the effect.

== Use of AAT==
When an interaction situation has multiple goals, the theory finds increased demands on an individual’s information processing capacity.  Assembly of goals may be difficult because a specific goal may be incompatible with behaviors associated with each other goals.  In turn, multiple goal messages involve more speech hesitation.  The utilization of AAT can provide a clear opportunity to plan or assemble goals more careful to ease the effect.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5778">'''BT Highway''' was a [[UK]] [[retail]] [[ISDN|ISDN2e]] service from [[BT Group|British Telecom]] which was announced in November 1997&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite news  | url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/1997/nov/08/news.internet | title=BT heralds new high-speed Internet surfing at drop in the ocean cost | date=8 November 1997 | publisher=The Guardian | location=London | first=Chris | last=Barrie}}&lt;/ref&gt; and withdrawn in February 2007.&lt;ref name="bt1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bt.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/bt.cfg/php/enduser/cci/bt_adp.php?p_sid=&amp;p_faqid=8337&amp;cat_lvl1=346&amp;p_cv=1.346&amp;p_cats=346&amp;s_cid=con_FURL_homehighway | title=When and why did BT withdraw Home Highway? | accessdate=13 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the domestic market, it was sold as BT Home Highway and for small businesses, BT Business Highway. These names were used simply to differentiate billing schemes; the hardware for both services used the name BT Highway. Unlike regular ISDN2e service where only a digital [[S interface]] is provided BT Highway provided both digital and analogue connections simplifying migration from regular [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] service.

==Notability in the UK Internet Timeline==

Due to ISDN's ability to establish connections in less than 3 seconds, compared to 30–60 seconds for a dial-up modem, BT Highway provided many people's&lt;ref name=ciao1&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ciao.co.uk/BT_Highway__87071 | title=Ciao! Reviews of BT Home Highway | accessdate=13 June 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080603073802/http://www.ciao.co.uk/BT_Highway__87071| archivedate= 3 June 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; first experience of a near always-on Internet connection. The service also provided many people's&lt;ref name=ciao1/&gt; first experience of an Internet connection that ran faster than a [[Modem#Narrowband/phone-line dialup modems|dial-up modem]] (up to 128 [[Data rate units#Kilobit per second|kbit/s]] compared to 56 kbit/s, and with a [[lag|latency]] of 75-150 [[Millisecond|ms]] compared to 150-300 ms). BT Highway was available five or more years before the availability of [[broadband]], especially in rural areas&lt;ref name=sirgeorgeyoung1&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sirgeorgeyoung.org.uk/pages/broadband1.htm | title=Sir George Young MP calls for "Broadband Access for All" | date=17 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; where ISDN was available over far longer distances, and far more [[telephone exchange]]s, than the initial roll-out of [[ADSL]].

==Details==

BT Highway was provided as a wall-mounted panel that supplemented an analogue master socket. A blank faceplate was placed across the analogue master socket so that all connections had to be performed through the panel.

BT Highway was distinctive because, unlike most ISDN services, it was aimed at both home and small business users, and incorporated both analogue sockets (coloured white) and ISDN sockets (coloured blue). It was possible to plug in both Cat5 ISDN equipment and traditional [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] analogue telephones at the same time into the same master panel; normally an ISDN master panel provides only ISDN sockets. As with a standard ISDN2e service, it was possible to mix and match concurrent connections to provide two concurrent analogue phone calls, one analogue phone call and one ISDN 64kbit/s call, two 64 kbit/s ISDN calls or one 128 kbit/s ISDN call. The analogue sockets were standard UK [[British telephone sockets|BS6312 sockets]] and included a ring capacitor.

Unlike an analogue master socket, BT Highway required external power from a [[Adaptor|mains electric adaptor]]. However, in the event of a power cut, the system still allowed analogue telephone calls to be made through the first analogue socket.

Connection to the Internet was typically performed either by a dedicated ISDN [[Router (computing)|router]] or by an ISDN [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] card. Later versions of BT Highway provided a USB port which PCs could connect to; a driver CD was supplied and the device was seen as an ISDN modem by Windows. As with ISDN2e, most brands of device typically allowed the user to automatically connect and drop the second ISDN channel to switch between 64 kbit/s and 128 kbit/s, depending on whether one channel was already being used (for example, for a simultaneous analogue telephone call).

Three phone numbers were provided as standard. Two for the analogue ports and one for use by ISDN equipment. Home highway users were limited to these while business highway users could order [[Multiple Subscriber Number]]ing to get more phone numbers for ISDN equipment. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.seg.co.uk/products/isdnover.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction and Withdrawal==

BT Highway was announced in November 1997&lt;ref name="guardian1" /&gt; and introduced on an exchange-by-exchange basis starting in September 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.zdnet.co.uk/internet/0,1000000097,2069201,00.htm | title=BT service promises ISDN speed over phone lines | publisher=ZDNet | date=21 August 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; BT stopped selling new services on 5 September 2005 and stopped providing BT Highway services altogether in February 2007,&lt;ref name="bt1" /&gt; encouraging users to migrate to ADSL. Where migration to ADSL was not possible, BT continued to sell their ISDN2e service for business customers only.

'''Breyten Breytenbach''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|eɪ|t|ɛ|n|_|ˈ|b|ʌ|x}}; born 16 September 1939) is a South African writer and painter known for his opposition to [[apartheid]], and consequent imprisonment by the South African government. He is informally considered as the national [[poet laureate]] by [[Afrikaans]]-speaking South Africans of the region. He also holds French [[citizenship]].

==Biography==
Breyten Breytenbach was born in [[Bonnievale, Western Cape|Bonnievale]], approximately 180&amp;nbsp;km from [[Cape Town]] and 100&amp;nbsp;km from the southernmost tip of Africa at [[Cape Agulhas]]. His early education was at Hoërskool Hugenoot and he later studied [[fine arts]] at the Michaelis School of Fine Art at the [[University of Cape Town]]. His committed opposition to apartheid policy compelled him to leave South Africa for [[Paris]], [[France]], in the early 1960s, where he married a French woman of Vietnamese ancestry, Yolande, due to which he was not allowed to return: The ''[[Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act]]'' of 1949 and ''The [[Immorality Act]]'' (1950) made it a criminal offence for a white person to have any sexual relations with a person of a different [[Racism|race]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/breyten-breytenbach |title=Breyten Breytenbach |date= |website= |publisher=South African History Online |accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisonment==
On an illegal clandestine trip to South Africa in 1975 he was arrested and sentenced to nine years' imprisonment for [[high treason]]: his work ''The True Confessions of an Albino Terrorist'' describes aspects of his imprisonment. According to [[André Brink]],  Breytenbach was retried in June 1977 on new and fanciful charges that, among other things, he had planned a Russian submarine attack on the prison at [[Robben Island]] through the conspiratorial "[[Okhela]] Organisation".  In the end, the judge found him guilty only of having smuggled letters and poems out of jail, for which he was fined 50 dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=André Brink|title=A Season in Paradise|year=1985|chapter=Introduction|publisher=Faber and Faber|location=London|isbn=0-571-13491-2|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Released in 1982 as a result of international protests, he returned to Paris and obtained French citizenship.

He became a visiting professor at the [[University of Cape Town]] in the Graduate School of Humanities in January 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stellenboschwriters.com/breyten.html |title=Breyten Breytenbach |date= |website= |publisher=Stellenbosch Writers |accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also involved with the [[Gorée Institute]] in [[Dakar]] ([[Senegal]]) and with [[New York University]], where he teaches in the Graduate Creative Writing Program.

==Works==
Breytenbach's work includes numerous volumes of novels, poetry and essays, many of which are in [[Afrikaans]]. Many have been translated from Afrikaans to English, and many were originally published in English. He is also known for his works of pictorial arts. Exhibitions of his paintings and prints have been shown in cities around the world, including [[Johannesburg]], Cape Town, Hong Kong, [[Amsterdam]], Stockholm, Paris, [[Brussels]], Edinburgh and New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humanrousseau.com/authors/2878 |title=Author Focus |date= |website= |publisher=Human &amp; Rousseau |accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the brother of [[Jan Breytenbach]], co-founder of the 1st Reconnaissance Commando of the [[South African Special Forces Brigade|South African Special Forces]], and Cloete Breytenbach, a widely published [[war correspondent]]. He is the father of the French journalist Daphnee Breytenbach.

'''Maria Louisa "Briar" Gardner''' (29 July 1879 – 20 October 1968) was a [[New Zealand]] potter and speech therapist.

==Early life==
Gardner was born on 29 July 1879 in Hobsonville, [[Auckland]], to Louise (née Clark) and John Gardner.&lt;ref name="Te Ara"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McKergow|first1=Fiona|title=Gardner, Maria Louisa|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/4g4/gardner-maria-louisa|website=Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child she was tutored at home before spending two years at Araparera School after it opened in 1893.&lt;ref name="Te Ara"/&gt;

Growing up, her family was involved in the pottery industry: her uncles owned the Amalgamated Brick and Pipe Company, while her brothers established a brickworks in 1902 at [[New Lynn]] - with guidance from Gardner, they later expanded into domesticware and became known as [[Crown Lynn]]. She moved to live with her brothers at New Lynn.&lt;ref name="Te Ara"/&gt;

== Career==
Gardner became increasingly interested in creative arts and began embroidery, tapestry and painting, spending some time in Australia studying these crafts and exhibiting her decorative needlework in Auckland in 1920.&lt;ref name=AC&gt;{{cite book|last1=Calhoun|first1=Ann|title=The arts &amp; crafts movement in New Zealand 1870-1940 : women make their mark|date=2000|publisher=Auckland University Press|location=Auckland|isbn=1869402294|page=191|url=http://nlnzcat.natlib.govt.nz/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=603712}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began taking classes at [[Elam School of Fine Arts]], studying sculpture under William Wright and learning about Māori design from artist and illustrator [[Trevor Lloyd (artist)|Trevor Lloyd]].&lt;ref name="Te Ara"/&gt;

Gardner became interested in pottery when English potter Willam Speer came to work at New Lynn on a newly installed pottery wheel. Although he was largely discouraging, she began to teach herself pottery, beginning at 5.30am and working for two hours until Speer came to work at 7.30 am.&lt;ref name="Te Ara"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AC/&gt; She experimented with different glazes and decorating materials, experiencing technical difficulties in her early works.&lt;ref name="Te Ara"/&gt;

During the 1930s, her skill and recognition developed. She began regularly exhibiting her pottery through the Auckland Society of Arts in 1930. In 1937 she exhibited with the Waikato Society of Arts alongside four other women artists.&lt;ref name="Te Ara"/&gt; The following year, she established a kiln and pottery studio at her family home. During the war years, demand for her work increased, and her work was sold throughout New Zealand, but particularly at the Auckland departments stores [[Smith &amp; Caughey's]], and Milne &amp; Choyce. Her pottery was also exported to Australia at times.&lt;ref name=AC/&gt;

==Style==
In the mid-1930s, Gardner “was praised for the marked development in her work, particularly her use of ‘soft harmonious colourings’, ‘flowing glazes’ and Maori and indigenous plant motifs.”&lt;ref name="Te Ara"/&gt;

==Later life==
By 1950, arthritis forced her to stop pottery, and in 1951 she trained as a speech and drama teacher. She died in Auckland on 20 October 1968.&lt;ref name="Te Ara"/&gt;

==Collections==
Gardner's work is held in the collections of the [[Auckland War Memorial Museum]] and [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]].&lt;ref name="Te Ara"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Object: Jug|url=http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/object/1056914|website=Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11712">[[File:Passenger ship Zaandam in drydock.jpg|thumb|A bulbous bow with a complex shape—the through tunnels in the side are [[bow thruster]]s.]]
A '''bulbous bow''' is a protruding bulb at the [[bow (ship)|bow]] (or front) of a ship just below the [[waterline]]. The bulb modifies the way the water flows around the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]], reducing [[Drag (physics)|drag]] and thus increasing speed, range, [[fuel efficiency]], and stability. Large ships with bulbous bows generally have twelve to fifteen percent better fuel efficiency than similar vessels without them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dieselduck.ca/library/01%20articles/bulbous_bows.htm|title= Bulbous bows|author=Bray, Patrick J. |date=April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bulbous bow also increases the buoyancy of the forward part and hence reduces the pitching of the ship to a small degree.

Bulbous bows have been found to be most effective when used on vessels that meet the following conditions:
*the waterline length is longer than about {{convert|15|m|1}}
*the vessel will operate most of the time at or near its maximum speed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Theory of the Bulbous Bow and its Practical Application|last=Wigley|first=W.C.S.|publisher=Newcastle upon Tyne|year=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, large vessels that cross large bodies of water near their best speed will benefit from a bulbous bow. This would include naval vessels, cargo ships, passenger ships, tankers and supertankers. All of these ships tend to be large and usually operate within a small range of speeds close to their top speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.neely-chaulk.com/narciki/Bulbous_bow|title= Narciki - Naval Architecture Wiki Project: Bulbous bow}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bulbous bows are less beneficial in smaller craft and may actually be detrimental to their performance and economy. Thus, they are rarely used on tugboats or recreational craft like powerboats, sailing vessels, and yachts.

==Underlying principle==
[[File:Bulbous Bow Combined Wave Effects.png|thumb|The combined influence of a subsurface bulb and a conventional bow on wave formation where the wave created by the bulb cancels that created by the conventional bow {{ordered list |1= Profile of bow with bulb|2= Profile of bow without bulb|3= Wave created by bulb|4= Wave created by conventional bow|5= Waterline and region of cancelled waves}}]]
The effect of the bulbous bow can be explained using the concept of [[destructive interference]] of waves:&lt;ref name = Bowflows&gt;{{Citation

A conventionally shaped bow causes a [[bow wave]]. A bulb alone forces the water to flow up and over it forming a trough. Thus, if a bulb is added to a conventional bow at the proper position, the bulb trough coincides with the crest of the bow wave, and the two cancel out, reducing the vessel's [[wake]]. While inducing another wave stream saps energy from the ship, canceling out the second wave stream at the bow changes the pressure distribution along the hull, thereby reducing wave resistance. The effect that pressure distribution has on a surface is known as the [[form drag|form effect]].&lt;ref name = Bowflows/&gt;

A sharp bow on a conventional hull form would produce waves and low drag like a bulbous bow, but waves coming from the side would strike it harder. The blunt bulbous bow also produces higher pressure in a large region in front, making the bow wave start earlier.&lt;ref name = Bowflows/&gt;

The addition of a bulb to a ship's hull increases its overall wetted area. As wetted area increases, so does drag. At greater speeds and in larger vessels it is the bow wave that is the greatest force impeding the vessel's forward motion through the water. For a vessel that is small or spends a great deal of its time at a slow speed, the increase in drag will not be offset by the benefit in damping bow wave generation. As the wave counter effects are only significant at the vessel's higher range of speed, bulbous bows are not energy efficient when the vessel cruises outside of these ranges, specifically at lower speeds.&lt;ref name = Bowflows/&gt;

Some explanations note that water flowing over the bulb depresses the ship's bow and keeps it trimmed better. Since many of the bulbous bows are symmetrical or even angled upwards, which would tend to raise the bow further, the improved trim is likely a by-product of the reduced wave action as the vessel approaches [[hull speed]], rather than direct action of water flow over the bulb.{{reference needed|date=January 2018}}

[[File:USS Ronald Reagan Bulbous Bow.jpg|thumb|The bulbous bow of the [[U.S. Navy]] [[Aircraft carrier|carrier]] {{USS|Ronald Reagan|CVN-76|6}} made visible in drydock.]]
The bulbous bow concept is credited to [[David W. Taylor]], a naval architect who served as Chief Constructor of the [[United States Navy]] during the [[First World War]] and who used the concept (known as a bulbous forefoot) in his design of the {{USS|Delaware|BB-28|6}}, which entered service in 1910. The bow design did not initially enjoy wide acceptance, although it was used in the {{sclass-|Lexington|battlecruiser}} to great success after the two ships of that class which survived the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] were converted to [[aircraft carrier]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Friedman | first = Norman | year = 1985 | title = U.S. Battleships: An Illustrated Design History | publisher = [[Naval Institute Press]] | location = [[Annapolis]], Maryland | oclc = 12214729 | isbn = 978-0-87021-715-9 | page = 235 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of acceptance changed in the 1920s, with Germany's launching of {{SS|Bremen|1929|2}} and {{SS |Europa|1930|2}}. They were referred to as Germany's North Atlantic greyhounds, two large commercial [[ocean liner]]s that competed for the trans-Atlantic passenger trade.  Both ships won the coveted [[Blue Riband]], ''Bremen'' in 1929 with a crossing speed of {{convert |27.9|kn}}, and ''Europa'' surpassing her in 1930 with a crossing speed of 27.91 knots.&lt;ref name=kludas&gt;{{cite book | last=Kludas | first= Arnold | title= Record breakers of the North Atlantic, Blue Riband Liners 1838-1952 | location=London  | publisher=Chatham  | year=2000 | isbn =1-86176-141-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design began to be incorporated elsewhere, as seen in the U.S. built ''[[SS Malolo]]'', ''[[SS President Hoover]]'' and ''[[SS President Coolidge]]'' passenger liners launched in the late 1920s and early 1930s.  Still the idea was largely viewed as experimental by many ship builders and owners.{{reference needed|date=January 2018}}

In 1935 the French superliner {{SS|Normandie|3=2}} was designed by [[Vladimir Yurkevich]] combining a bulbous forefoot with massive size and a redesigned hull shape. She was able to achieve speeds in excess of 30 knots (56&amp;nbsp;km/h). ''Normandie'' was famous for many things, including her clean entry into the water and markedly reduced bow wave. ''Normandie''{{'}}s great rival, the British liner {{RMS|Queen Mary|3=2}}, achieved equivalent speeds using traditional stem and hull design. However, a crucial difference was that ''Normandie'' achieved these speeds with approximately thirty percent less engine power than ''Queen Mary'' and a corresponding reduction in fuel use.{{reference needed|date=January 2018}}

Bulbous bow designs were also developed and used by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. A modest bulbous bow was used in a number of their ship designs, including the light cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Ōyodo||2}} and the carriers  {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Shōkaku||2}} and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Taihō||2}}. A far more radical bulbous bow design solution was incorporated into their massively large {{sclass-|Yamato|battleship}}, including {{ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}}, {{ship|Japanese battleship|Musashi||2}} and the aircraft carrier {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Shinano||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yamato.kure-city.jp/english/eng.indd.pdf |title=Yamato Museum |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110627054009/http://yamato.kure-city.jp/english/eng.indd.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern bulbous bow was developed by Dr. Takao Inui at the [[University of Tokyo]] during the 1950s and 1960s, independently of Japanese naval research. Inui based his research on earlier findings by scientists made after Taylor discovered that ships fitted with a bulbous forefoot exhibited substantially lower drag characteristics than predicted. The bulbous bow concept was first definitively studied by Thomas Havelock, Cyril Wigley and Georg Weinblum, including Wigley's 1936 work "The Theory of the Bulbous Bow and its Practical Application" which examined the issues of wave production and damping. Inui's initial scientific papers on the effect of bulbous bow on wavemaking resistance were collected into a report published by the [[University of Michigan]] in 1960. His work came to widespread attention with his paper "Wavemaking Resistance of Ships" published by the [[Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers]] in 1962. It was eventually found that drag could be reduced by about five percent. Experimentation and refinement slowly improved the geometry of bulbous bows, but they were not widely exploited until computer modelling techniques enabled researchers at the [[University of British Columbia]] to increase their performance to a practical level in the 1980s.{{reference needed|date=January 2018}}

==Sonar domes==
Some [[warships]] specialized for [[anti-submarine warfare]] use a specifically shaped bulb as a hydrodynamic housing for a [[sonar]] [[transducer]], which resembles a bulbous bow but the hydrodynamic effects are only incidental. The transducer is a large cylinder or sphere composed of a [[phased array]] of [[acoustics|acoustic]] transducers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-Underwater-Warfare-Systems/UMS-4110-France.html|title=Jane's Underwater Warfare Systems|date=December 5, 2010|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913095952/http://articles.janes.com/articles/Janes-Underwater-Warfare-Systems/UMS-4110-France.html|archive-date=September 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire compartment is flooded with water and the acoustic window of the bulb is made of [[fiber-reinforced plastic]] or another material (such as [[rubber]]) transparent to underwater sounds as they are transmitted and received. The transducer bulb places the sonar equipment at the greatest possible distance from the ship's own noise-generating propulsion system.{{reference needed|date=January 2018}}

Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[host (network)|computer server]] running [[list of BBS software|software]] that allows users to connect to the system using a [[terminal program]]. Once logged in, the user can perform functions such as [[upload]]ing and [[download]]ing software and data, reading news and bulletins, and exchanging messages with other users through public [[Internet forum|message boards]] and sometimes via direct [[synchronous conferencing|chatting]]. In the middle to late 1980s, message aggregators and bulk store-and-forward'ers sprung up to provide services such as [[FidoNet]], which is similar to [[email]].

Many BBSes also offer [[BBS door|online games]] in which users can compete with each other. BBSes with multiple phone lines often provide [[chat room]]s, allowing users to interact with each other. Bulletin board systems were in many ways a precursor to the modern form of the [[World Wide Web]], [[social network service|social networks]], and other aspects of the [[Internet]]. Low-cost, high-performance [[modem]]s drove the use of [[online service]]s and BBSes through the early 1990s. ''[[Infoworld]]'' estimated that there were 60,000 BBSes serving 17 million users in the United States alone in 1994, a collective market much larger than major online services such as [[CompuServe]].

The introduction of inexpensive [[Dial-up Internet access|dial-up internet service]] and the [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic web browser]] offered ease of use and global access that BBS and online systems did not provide, and led to a rapid crash in the market starting in 1994. Over the next year, many of the [[List of BBS software|leading BBS software providers]] went [[bankrupt]] and tens of thousands of BBSes disappeared. Today, BBSing survives largely as a nostalgic hobby in most parts of the world, but it is still an extremely popular form of communication for Taiwanese youth (see [[PTT Bulletin Board System]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thinkingchinese.com/chinese-bbs-the-social-activity-that-never-grows-old

Some offer access through packet switched networks or [[packet radio]] connections.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==

=== Precursors ===

A precursor to the public bulletin board system was [[Community Memory]], started in August 1973 in [[Berkeley, California]]. Useful [[microcomputer]]s did not exist at that time, and modems were both expensive and slow. Community Memory therefore ran on a [[mainframe computer]] and was accessed through terminals located in several [[San Francisco Bay Area]] neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crosby|first=Kip|date=November 1995|title=Convivial Cybernetic Devices|journal=The Analytical Engine|publisher=Computer History Association of California|volume=3|issue=1|issn=1071-6351|url=http://www.opencollector.org/history/homebrew/engv3n1.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323072155/http://www.opencollector.org/history/homebrew/engv3n1.html|archivedate=2010-03-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poor quality of the original modem connecting the terminals to the mainframe prompted a user to invent the [[Pennywhistle modem]], whose design was highly influential in the mid-1970s.

Community Memory allowed the user to type messages into a [[computer terminal]] after inserting a coin, and offered a "pure" bulletin board experience with public messages only (no email or other features). It did offer the ability to tag messages with keywords, which the user could use in searches. The system acted primarily in the form of a buy and sell system with the tags taking the place of the more traditional [[Classified advertising|classifications]]. But users found ways to express themselves outside these bounds, and the system spontaneously created stories, poetry and other forms of communications. Unfortunately, the system was expensive to operate, and when their host machine became unavailable and a new one could not be found, the system closed in January 1975.

Similar functionality was available to most mainframe users, which might be considered a sort of ultra-local BBS when used in this fashion. Commercial systems, expressly intended to offer these features to the public, became available in the late 1970s and formed the [[online service]] market that lasted into the 1990s. One particularly influential example was [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO]], which had thousands of users by the late 1970s, many of whom used the messaging and [[chat room]] features of the system in the same way that would become common on BBSes.

===The first BBSes===
[[Image:Ward Christensen and the First BBS.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Ward Christensen holds an expansion card from the original CBBS S-100 host machine.]]
Early modems were generally very simple devices using [[acoustic coupler]]s to handle telephone operation. The user would first pick up the phone, dial a number, then press the handset into rubber cups on the top of the modem. Disconnecting at the end of a call required the user to pick up the handset and return it to the phone. Examples of direct-connecting modems did exist, and these often allowed the host computer to send it commands to answer or hang up calls, but these were very expensive devices used by large banks and similar companies.

With the introduction of [[microcomputer]]s with expansion slots, like the [[S-100 bus]] machines and [[Apple II]], it became possible for the modem to communicate instructions and data on separate lines. A number of modems of this sort were available by the late 1970s. This made the BBS possible for the first time, as it allowed software on the computer to pick up an incoming call, communicate with the user, and then hang up the call when the user logged off.

The first public [[dial-up]] BBS was developed by [[Ward Christensen]] and [[Randy Suess]]. According to an early interview, when Chicago was snowed under during the [[Great Blizzard of 1978]], the two began preliminary work on the [[Computerized Bulletin Board System]], or [[CBBS]]. The system came into existence largely through a fortuitous combination of Christensen having a spare S-100 bus computer and an early Hayes internal modem, and Suess's insistence that the machine be placed at his house in [[Chicago]] where it would be a local phone call to millions of users. Christensen patterned the system after the [[cork board]] his local computer club used to post information like "need a ride". CBBS officially went online on 16 February 1978.&lt;ref name=ward&gt;[http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/AAA/AAA/CBBS/memories.txt Collection of Memories of writing and running the first BBS by Ward Christensen (Circa 1992)], ''BBSDocumentary.com'', retrieved June 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; CBBS, which kept a count of callers, reportedly connected 253,301 callers before it was finally retired.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Smartmodem===
[[File:Hayes 300 Baud Smartmodem 02.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The 300 baud Smartmodem led to an initial wave of early BBS systems.]]

A key innovation required for the popularization of the BBS was the [[Hayes Microcomputer Products#The Smartmodem|Hayes Smartmodem]]. Internal modems like the ones used by CBBS and similar early systems were usable, but generally expensive due to the manufacturer having to make a different modem for every computer platform they wanted to target. They were also limited to those computers with internal expansion, and could not be used with other useful platforms like [[video terminal]]s. External modems were available for these platforms but required the phone to be dialed using a conventional handset, making them unable to accept incoming calls without manual intervention. Internal modems could be software controlled to perform both outbound and inbound calls, but external modems had only the data pins to communicate with the host system.

Hayes' solution to the problem was to use a small [[microcontroller]] to implement a system that examined the data flowing into the modem from the host computer, watching for certain command strings. This allowed commands to be sent to and from the modem using the same data pins as all the rest of the data, meaning it would work on any system that could support even the most basic modems. The Smartmodem could pick up the phone, dial numbers, and hang up again, all without any operator intervention. The Smartmodem was not necessary for BBS use but made overall operation dramatically simpler. It also improved usability for the caller, as most terminal software allowed different phone numbers to be stored and dialed on command, allowing the user to easily connect to a series of systems.

The introduction of the Smartmodem led to the first real wave of BBS systems. Limited in both speed and storage capacity, these systems were normally dedicated solely to messaging, both private email and public forums. File transfers were painfully slow at these speeds, and file libraries were typically limited to text files containing lists of other BBS systems. These systems attracted a particular type of user who used the BBS as a unique type of communications medium, and when these local systems were crowded from the market in the 1990s, their loss was lamented for many years.

=== Higher speeds, commercialization ===
Speed improved with the introduction of 1200 [[Bits per second|bit/s]] modems in the [[Modem#Increasing speeds|early 1980s]], giving way to 2400 bit/s fairly rapidly. The improved performance led to a substantial increase in BBS popularity. Most of the information was displayed using ordinary [[ASCII]] text or [[ANSI art]], but a number of systems attempted character-based [[graphical user interface]]s which began to be practical at 2400 bit/s.

There was a lengthy delay before 9600&amp;nbsp;bit/s models began to appear on the market. 9600&amp;nbsp;bit/s was not even established as a strong standard before [[V.32bis]] at 14.4&amp;nbsp;kbit/s took over in the early 1990s. This period also saw the rapid rise in capacity and a dramatic drop in the price of [[hard drive]]s. By the late 1980s, many BBS systems had significant file libraries, and this gave rise to leeching, users calling BBSes solely for their files. These users would tie up the modem for some time, leaving less time for other users, who got [[busy signal]]s. The resulting upheaval eliminated many of the pioneering message-centric systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldgamemags.com/multi-format/non-gaming-magazines/chips-bits/ "File Sponges, the BBS nightmare"], ''Chips 'n Bits''&lt;/ref&gt;

This also gave rise to a new class of BBS systems, dedicated solely to file upload and downloads. These systems charged for access, typically a flat monthly fee, compared to the per-hour fees charged by ''[[Event Horizons BBS]]'' and most online services. A host of 3rd party services sprang up to support these systems, offering simple credit card [[merchant account]] gateways for the payment of monthly fees, and entire file libraries on [[compact disk]] that made initial setup very easy. Early 1990s editions of ''Boardwatch'' were filled with ads for single-click install solutions dedicated to these new [[sysops]]. While this gave the market a bad reputation, it also led to its greatest success. During the early 1990s, there were a number of mid-sized software companies dedicated to BBS software, and the number of BBSes in service reached its peak.

Towards the early 1990s, the BBS industry became so popular that it spawned three monthly magazines, ''[[Boardwatch]]'', ''[[BBS Magazine]]'', and in Asia and Australia, ''[[Chips 'n Bits Magazine]]'' which devoted extensive coverage of the software and technology innovations and people behind them, and listings to US and worldwide BBSes.&lt;ref name=ChipsnBits&gt;[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/54469 Chips 'n' Bits : the Northern Territory Computer Users' newsletter], ''catalogue.nla.gov.au'', retrieved March 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in the USA, a major monthly magazine, ''[[Computer Shopper (US magazine)|Computer Shopper]]'', carried a list of BBSes along with a brief abstract of each of their offerings.

===GUIs===
Through the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was considerable experimentation with ways to improve the BBS experience from its [[command-line interface]] roots. Almost every popular system improved matters somewhat by adding ANSI-based color menus to make reading easier, and most also allowed cursor commands to offer command-line recall and similar features. Another common feature was the use of [[autocomplete]] to make menu navigation simpler, a feature that would not re-appear on the web until decades later.

A number of systems also made forays into GUI-based interfaces, either using character graphics sent from the host, or using custom GUI-based terminal systems. The latter initially appeared, unsurprisingly, on the [[Amiga]] and [[Macintosh]] platform, where [[TeleFinder]] and [[FirstClass]] became very popular. FirstClass offered a host of features that would be difficult or impossible under a terminal-based solution, including bi-directional information flow and non-blocking operation that allowed the user to exchange files in both directions while continuing to use the message system and chat, all in separate windows. [[Skypix]] featured on Amiga a complete [[markup language]]. It used a standardized set of icons to indicate mouse driven commands available online and to recognize different filetypes present on BBS storage media. It was capable to transmit data like images, audio files, and audio clips between users linked to same BBS or off-line if BBS was in the circuit of FidoNet organization.
On the PC, efforts were more oriented to extensions of the original terminal concept, with the GUI being described in the information on the host. One example was the [[Remote Imaging Protocol]], essentially a picture description system, which remained relatively obscure. Probably the ultimate development of this style of operation was the dynamic page implementation of the [[University of Southern California]] BBS (USCBBS) by Susan Biddlecomb, which predated the implementation of the [[HTML]] [[Dynamic web page]]. A complete Dynamic web page implementation was accomplished using [[The Bread Board System|TBBS]] with a [[TDBS]] add-on presenting a complete menu system individually customized for each user.

===Rise of the Internet and decline of BBS===
The demand for complex ANSI and ASCII screens and larger file transfers taxed available [[channel capacity]], which in turn propelled demand for faster modems. 14.4 kbit/s modems were standard for a number of years while various companies attempted to introduce non-standard systems with higher performance, normally about 19.2 kbit/s. Another delay followed due to a long [[List of ITU-T V-Series Recommendations|V.34]] standards process before 28.8&amp;nbsp;kbit/s was released, only to be quickly replaced by 33.6&amp;nbsp;kbit/s, and then 56&amp;nbsp;kbit/s.

These increasing speeds had the side effect of dramatically reducing the noticeable effects of channel efficiency. When modems were slow, considerable effort was put into developing the most efficient protocols and display systems possible. Running a general-purpose protocol like [[TCP/IP]] over a 1200 bit/s modem was a painful experience. With [[56 kbit/s modem]]s, however, the overhead was so greatly reduced as to be unnoticeable. Dial-up Internet service became widely available in 1994, and a must-have option for any general-use [[operating system]] by 1995.

These developments together resulted in the sudden obsolescence of bulletin board technology in 1995 and the collapse of its supporting market. Technically, Internet service offered an enormous advantage over BBS systems, as a single connection to the user's [[Internet service provider]] allowed them to contact services around the world. In comparison, BBS systems relied on a direct point-to-point connection, so even dialing multiple local systems required multiple phone calls. Moreover, Internet protocols allowed that same single connection to be used to contact multiple services at the same time, say download files from an [[FTP]] library while checking the weather on a local news web site. In comparison, a connection to a BBS allowed access only to the information on that system.

===Estimating numbers===
According to the [[FidoNet]] Nodelist, BBSes reached their peak usage around 1996, which was the same period that the [[World Wide Web]] and [[AOL]] became mainstream. BBSes rapidly declined in popularity thereafter, and were replaced by systems using the Internet for connectivity. Some of the larger commercial BBSes, such as MaxMegabyte and [[ExecPC BBS]], evolved into [[Internet Service Providers]].

The website ''[[textfiles.com]]'' serves as an archive that documents the history of the BBS. The [http://bbslist.textfiles.com/ historical BBS list] on ''textfiles.com'' contains over 105,000 BBSes that have existed over a span of 20 years in North America alone. The owner of ''textfiles.com'', [[Jason Scott Sadofsky|Jason Scott]], also produced ''[[BBS: The Documentary]]'', a [[DVD]] film that chronicles the history of the BBS and features interviews with well-known people (mostly from the United States) from the heyday BBS era.  As of 2016 an estimated 100 to 150 are still active, mostly for nostalgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Edwards|first1=Benj|title=The Lost Civilization of Dial-Up Bulletin Board Systems|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/11/the-lost-civilization-of-dial-up-bulletin-board-systems/506465/|accessdate=7 November 2016|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Software and hardware ==
[[File:Amiga3000UX.jpg|thumb|Amiga 3000 running a two-line BBS]]

Unlike modern websites and [[online services]] that are typically hosted by third-party companies in commercial [[data center]]s, BBS computers (especially for smaller boards) were typically operated from the SysOp's home. As such, access could be unreliable, and in many cases, only one user could be on the system at a time. Only larger BBSes with multiple phone lines using specialized hardware, multitasking software, or a [[LAN]] connecting multiple computers, could host multiple simultaneous users.

The first BBSes used homebrew software,{{efn|CBBS Chicago (which [[Ward Christensen]] programmed) was about 20,000 lines of 8080 assembler.}} quite often written or customized by the SysOps themselves, running on early [[S-100 bus]] [[microcomputer]] systems such as the [[Altair 8800]], [[IMSAI 8080]] and [[Cromemco]] under the [[CP/M]] operating system. Soon after, BBS software was being written for all of the major [[home computer]] systems of the late 1970s era – the [[Apple II]], [[Atari 8-bit family]], [[Commodore International|Commodore]] and [[TRS-80]] being some of the most popular.

A few years later, in 1981, IBM introduced the first [[DOS]] based [[IBM personal computer|IBM PC]], and due to the overwhelming popularity of PCs and their [[IBM PC Compatible|clones]], DOS soon became the operating system on which the majority of BBS programs were run. [[RBBS-PC]], [[porting|ported]] over from the CP/M world, and ''Fido'' BBS, created by [[Tom Jennings]] (who later founded [[FidoNet]]) were the first notable DOS BBS programs. Many successful commercial BBS programs were developed for DOS, such as [[PCBoard]] BBS, [[RemoteAccess]] BBS, and [[Wildcat! BBS]]. Some popular [[freeware]] BBS programs for DOS included [[Telegard]] BBS and [[Renegade (BBS)|Renegade BBS]], which both had early origins from leaked [[WWIV]] BBS source code. There were several dozen other BBS programs developed over the DOS era, and many were released under the [[shareware]] concept, while some were released as [[freeware]] including iniquity.

BBS systems on other systems remained popular, especially [[home computer]]s, largely because they catered to the audience of users running those machines. The ubiquitous [[Commodore 64]] (introduced in 1982) was a common platform in the 1980s. Popular commercial BBS programs were [[Blue Board (software)|Blue Board]], [[Ivory BBS]], [[Color64]] and [[C-Net DS2|CNet 64]]. In the early 1990s, a small number of BBSes were also running on the Commodore [[Amiga]]. Popular BBS software for the Amiga were ABBS, [[Amiexpress]], C-Net, StormforceBBS, [[Infinity (software)|Infinity]] and Tempest. There was also a small faction of devoted Atari BBSes that used the [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 800]], then the 800XL, and eventually the 1040ST. The earlier machines generally lacked [[hard drive]] capabilities, which limited them primarily to messaging.

MS-DOS continued to be the most popular operating system for BBS use up until the mid-1990s, and in the early years, most multi-node BBSes were running under a DOS based multitasker such as [[DESQview]] or consisted of multiple computers connected via a [[LAN]]. In the late 1980s, a handful of BBS developers implemented multitasking communications routines inside their software, allowing multiple phone lines and users to connect to the same BBS computer. These included Galacticomm's [[MajorBBS]] (later WorldGroup), eSoft [[The Bread Board System]] (TBBS), and [[Falken]]. Other popular BBS's were [[Maximus (BBS)|Maximus]] and Opus, with some associated applications such as BinkleyTerm being based on characters from the [[Berkeley Breathed|Berkley Breathed]] cartoon strip of [[Bloom County]]. Though most BBS software had been written in [[BASIC]] or [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] (with some low-level routines written in [[assembly language]]), the [[C (language)|C]] language was starting to gain popularity.

By 1995, many of the DOS-based BBSes had begun switching to modern [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] operating systems, such as [[OS/2]], [[Windows 95]], and [[Linux]]. One of the first graphics based BBS applications was [[Excalibur BBS]] with a low bandwidth applications that required its own client for efficiency. This led to one of the earliest implementations of Electronic Commerce in 1996 with replication of partner stores around the globe. TCP/IP networking allowed most of the remaining BBSes to evolve and include Internet hosting capabilities. Recent BBS software, such as [[Synchronet]], [[Mystic BBS]], EleBBS, [[Dave's own version of Citadel|DOC]] or [[Wildcat! BBS]], provide access using the [[Telnet]] protocol rather than dialup, or by using legacy DOS-based BBS software with a [[FOSSIL]]-to-Telnet redirector such as [[NetFoss]].

BBSes were generally text-based, rather than [[Graphical User Interface|GUI]]-based, and early BBSes conversed using the simple [[ASCII]] character set. However, some home computer manufacturers extended the ASCII character set to take advantage of the advanced color and graphics capabilities of their systems. BBS software authors included these extended character sets in their software, and terminal program authors included the ability to display them when a compatible system was called. Atari's native character set was known as [[ATASCII]], while most Commodore BBSes supported [[PETSCII]]. PETSCII was also supported by the nationwide online service [[Quantum Link]].{{efn|Quantum Link and parts of [[AppleLink]] went on to become [[America Online]].}}

The use of these custom character sets was generally incompatible between manufacturers. Unless a caller was using terminal emulation software written for, and running on, the same type of system as the BBS, the session would simply fall back to simple ASCII output. For example, a Commodore 64 user calling an Atari BBS would use ASCII rather than the machine's native character set. As time progressed, most terminal programs began using the [[ANSI X3.64|ANSI]] standard, but could use their native character set if it was available.

COCONET, a BBS system made by Coconut Computing, Inc., was released in 1988 and only supported a GUI (no text interface was initially available but eventually became available around 1990), and worked in EGA/VGA graphics mode, which made it stand out from the text-based BBS systems. COCONET's bitmap and vector graphics and support for multiple type fonts were inspired by the [[PLATO system]], and the graphics capabilities were based on what was available in the Borland BGI graphics library. A competing approach called [[Remote Imaging Protocol]] (RIP) emerged and was promoted by Telegrafix in the early to mid-1990s but it never became widespread. An industry standard technology called [[NAPLPS]] was also considered, and although it became the underlying graphics technology behind the [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy service]], it never gained popularity in the BBS market. There were several GUI-based BBSes on the [[Apple Macintosh]] platform, including [[TeleFinder]] and [[FirstClass]], but these remained widely used only in the Mac market.

In the UK, the [[BBC Micro]] based OBBS software, available from [[Pace Micro Technology|Pace]] for use with their modems, optionally allowed for color and graphics using the [[Teletext]] based graphics mode available on that platform. Other systems used the [[Viewdata]] protocols made popular in the UK by [[British Telecom]]'s [[Prestel]] service, and the on-line magazine [[Micronet800|Micronet 800]] whom were busy giving away modems with their subscriptions.

The most popular form of online graphics was [[ANSI art]], which combined the [[Extended ASCII|IBM Extended ASCII]] character set's blocks and symbols with [[ANSI X3.64|ANSI]] [[escape sequence]]s to allow changing colors on demand, provide cursor control and screen formatting, and even basic musical tones. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, most BBSes used ANSI to make elaborate welcome screens, and colorized menus, and thus, ANSI support was a sought-after feature in terminal client programs. The development of ANSI art became so popular that it spawned an entire BBS "[[artscene]]" [[subculture]] devoted to it.

The [[Amiga]] ''Skyline BBS'' software was the first in 1987 featuring a script [[markup language]] communication protocol called [[Skypix]] which was capable of giving the user a complete graphical interface, featuring rich graphic content, changeable fonts, mouse-controlled actions, animations and sound.&lt;ref name="Skyline"&gt;{{cite web | title = BBSDocumentary, An Overview of BBS Programs | url = http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/expanded.html | publisher = [[Jason Scott Sadofsky|Jason Scott]] for [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] Magazine (?) | author = Scott Lee | accessdate = 2017-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, most BBS software that is still actively supported, such as Worldgroup, [[Wildcat! BBS]] and [[Citadel/UX]], is Web-enabled, and the traditional text interface has been replaced (or operates concurrently) with a Web-based user interface. For those more nostalgic for the true BBS experience, one can use NetSerial (Windows) or [[DOSBox]] (Windows/*nix) to redirect DOS COM port software to telnet, allowing them to connect to Telnet BBSes using 1980s and 1990s era modem [[terminal emulator|terminal emulation]] software, like [[Telix]], [[Terminate (software)|Terminate]], [[Qmodem]] and [[Procomm Plus]]. Modern 32-bit terminal emulators such as mTelnet and [[Synchronet#SyncTerm|SyncTerm]] include native telnet support.

== Content and access ==
Since most early BBSes were run by computer hobbyists, they were typically technical in topic, with user communities revolving around hardware and software discussions.

As the BBS phenomenon grew, so did the popularity of special interest boards. Bulletin Board Systems could be found for almost every hobby and interest. Popular interests included politics, religion, music, [[matchmaker.com|dating]], and [[alternative lifestyle]]s. Many SysOps also adopted a [[Theme (computing)|theme]] in which they customized their entire BBS (welcome screens, prompts, menus, and so on) to reflect that theme. Common themes were based on [[fantasy]], or were intended to give the user the illusion of being somewhere else, such as in a [[sanatorium]], wizard's castle, or on a [[pirate ship]].

In the early days, the file download library consisted of files that the SysOps obtained themselves from other BBSes and friends. Many BBSes inspected every file uploaded to their public file download library to ensure that the material did not violate copyright law. As time went on, [[shareware]] CD-ROMs were sold with up to thousands of files on each [[CD-ROM]]. Small BBSes copied each file individually to their hard drive. Some systems used a CD-ROM drive to make the files available. Advanced BBSes used Multiple CD-ROM disc changer units that switched 6 CD-ROM disks on demand for the caller(s). Large systems used all 26 DOS drive letters with multi-disk changers housing tens of thousands of copyright-free shareware or freeware files available to all callers. These BBSes were generally more family friendly, avoiding the seedier side of BBSes. Access to these systems varied from single to multiple modem lines with some requiring little or no confirmed registration.

Some BBSes, called elite, WaReZ or pirate boards, were exclusively used for distributing [[copyright infringement of software|cracked software]], [[phreaking]], and other questionable or unlawful content. These BBSes often had multiple modems and phone lines, allowing several users to upload and download files at once. Most elite BBSes used some form of new user verification, where new users would have to apply for membership and attempt to prove that they were not a law enforcement officer or a ''[[lamer]].'' The largest elite boards accepted users by invitation only. Elite boards also spawned their own subculture and gave rise to the [[slang]] known today as [[leet]]speak.

Another common type of board was the ''support BBS'' run by a manufacturer of computer products or software. These boards were dedicated to supporting users of the company's products with question and answer forums, news and updates, and downloads. Most of them were not a free call. Today, these services have moved to the web.

Some general purpose Bulletin Board Systems had special levels of access that were given to those who paid extra money, uploaded useful files or knew the SysOp personally. These specialty and pay BBSes usually had something unique to offer their users, such as large file libraries, [[warez]], [[pornography]], [[chat room]]s or [[Internet]] access.

Pay BBSes such as The [[WELL (virtual community)|WELL]] and Echo NYC (now Internet forums rather than dial-up), [[ExecPC BBS|ExecPC]], PsudNetwork and [[MindVox]] (which folded in 1996) were admired for their tight-knit communities and quality discussion forums. However, many free BBSes also maintained close knit communities, and some even had annual or bi-annual events where users would travel great distances to meet face-to-face with their on-line friends. These events were especially popular with BBSes that offered [[chat room]]s.

Some of the BBSes that provided access to illegal content faced opposition. On July 12, 1985, in conjunction with a [[credit card fraud]] investigation, the [[Middlesex County, New Jersey]] Sheriff's department raided and seized The Private Sector BBS, which was the official BBS for [[grey hat]] hacker quarterly [[2600 Magazine]] at the time.&lt;ref name=Psector&gt;[http://thegreatgeekmanual.com/blog/this-day-in-geek-history-july-12 This Day in Geek History: July12], ''thegreatgeekmanual.com'', retrieved March 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The notorious [[Rusty n Edie's BBS]], in [[Boardman, Ohio]], was raided by the FBI in January 1993 for trading unlicensed software, and later sued by [[Playboy]] for copyright infringement in November 1997. In [[Flint, Michigan]], a 21-year-old man was charged with distributing [[child pornography]] through his BBS in March 1996.&lt;ref name="flintj"&gt;{{cite news|title=Man Says Kiddie Porno Made Computer Site Popular|publisher=[[The Flint Journal]]|date=1996-03-20|author=Doran, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Networks==
Most early BBSes operated as individual systems. Information contained on that BBS never left the system, and users would only interact with the information and user community on that BBS alone. However, as BBSes became more widespread, there evolved a desire to connect systems together to share messages and files with distant systems and users. The largest such network was [[FidoNet]].

As is it was prohibitively expensive for the hobbyist SysOp to have a dedicated connection to another system, FidoNet was developed as a [[store and forward]] network. Private email (Netmail), public message boards (Echomail) and eventually even file attachments on a FidoNet-capable BBS would be bundled into one or more archive files over a set time interval. These archive files were then compressed with [[ARC (file format)|ARC]] or [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] and forwarded to (or polled by) another nearby node or hub via a dialup [[Xmodem]] session. Messages would be relayed around various FidoNet hubs until they were eventually delivered to their destination. The hierarchy of FidoNet BBS nodes, hubs, and zones was maintained in a routing table called a Nodelist. Some larger BBSes or regional FidoNet hubs would make several transfers per day, some even to multiple nodes or hubs, and as such, transfers usually occurred at night or early morning when toll rates were lowest. In Fido's heyday, sending a Netmail message to a user on a distant FidoNet node, or participating in an Echomail discussion could take days, especially if any FidoNet nodes or hubs in the message's route only made one transfer call per day.

FidoNet was platform-independent and would work with any BBS that was written to use it. BBSes that did not have integrated FidoNet capability could usually add it using an external FidoNet [[front end processor (program)|front-end]] mailer such as [[FrontDoor]], BinkleyTerm, InterMail or D'Bridge, and a mail processor such as [[FastEcho]] or [[Squish (FidoNet)|Squish]]. The front-end mailer would conduct the periodic FidoNet transfers, while the mail processor would usually run just before and just after the mailer ran. This program would scan for and pack up new outgoing messages, and then unpack, sort and "toss" the incoming messages into a BBS user's local email box or into the BBS's local message bases reserved for Echomail. As such, these mail processors were commonly called "scanner/tosser/packers."

Many other BBS networks followed the example of FidoNet, using the same standards and the same software. These were called FidoNet Technology Networks (FTNs). They were usually smaller and targeted at selected audiences. Some networks used [[QWK (file format)|QWK]] doors, and others such as [[RelayNet]] (RIME) and [[WWIVnet]] used non-Fido software and standards.

Before commercial Internet access became common, these [[computer network|networks]] of BBSes provided regional and international [[e-mail]] and message bases. Some even provided [[Gateway (computer networking)|gateways]], such as UFGATE, by which members could send/receive e-mail to/from the [[Internet]] via [[UUCP]], and many FidoNet discussion groups were shared via gateway to [[Usenet]]. Elaborate schemes allowed users to download binary files, search [[Gopher (protocol)|gopherspace]], and interact with distant [[Computer program|programs]], all using plain text e-mail.

As the volume of FidoNet Mail increased and newsgroups from the early days of the Internet became available, satellite data downstream services became viable for larger systems. The satellite service provided access to FidoNet and Usenet newsgroups in large volumes at a reasonable fee. By connecting a small dish &amp; receiver, a constant downstream of thousands of FidoNet and Usenet newsgroups could be received. The local BBS only needed to upload new outgoing messages via the modem network back to the satellite service. This method drastically reduced phone data transfers while dramatically increasing the number of message forums.

FidoNet is still in use today, though in a much smaller form, and many Echomail groups are still shared with Usenet via FidoNet to Usenet gateways. Widespread abuse of Usenet with [[spam (electronic)|spam]] and [[pornography]] has led to many of these FidoNet gateways to cease operation completely.

==Shareware and freeware==
{{Main|Shareware}}
Much of the [[shareware]] movement was started via user distribution of software through BBSes. A notable example was [[Phil Katz]]'s PKARC (and later [[PKZIP]], using the same ".zip" [[algorithm]] that [[WinZip]] and other popular archivers now use); also other concepts of software distribution like [[freeware]], [[postcardware]] like [[JPEGview]] and [[donationware]] like [[Red Ryder (software)|Red Ryder]] for the Macintosh first appeared on BBS sites. [[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]] from [[id Software]] and nearly all [[3D Realms|Apogee Software]] games were distributed as shareware (Apogee is, in fact, credited for adding an order form to a shareware demo).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The Internet has largely erased the distinction of shareware – most users now download the software directly from the developer's website rather than receiving it from another BBS user 'sharing' it. Today shareware is commonly used to mean electronically distributed software from a small developer.

Many commercial BBS software companies that continue to support their old BBS software products switched to the shareware model or made it entirely free. Some companies were able to make the move to the Internet and provide commercial products with BBS capabilities.

==Features==
A classic BBS had:
* A [[computer]]
* One or more [[modem]]s
* One or more phone lines, with more allowing for increased concurrent users
* A [[List of BBS software|BBS software package]]
* A [[sysop]] – system operator
* A user community

The BBS software usually provides:
* Menu Systems
* One or more [[Message board|message base]]s
* File areas
* SysOp side, live viewing of all caller activity
* Voting – opinion booths
* Statistics on message posters, top uploaders / downloaders
* [[Online game]]s (usually single [[Player (game)|player]] or only a single active player at a given time)
* A [[BBS door|doorway]] to third-party online games
* Usage auditing capabilities
* Multi-user chat (only possible on multi-line BBSes)
* Internet email (more common in later Internet-connected BBSes)
* Networked message boards
* Most modern BBSes allow [[telnet]] access over the Internet using a telnet server and a virtual [[FOSSIL]] driver.
* A "yell for SysOp" page caller side menu item that sounded an audible alarm to the SysOp. If chosen, the SysOp could then initiate a text-to-text chat with the caller.
* Primitive social networking features, such as leaving messages on a user's profile

Chancery cursive (''Cancelleresca corsiva'') hand. Papal Letter to [[Christian II of Denmark]], 21 April 1518 (Royal Archives)]]

The term "'''chancery hand'''" can refer to either of two very different styles of [[Paleography|historical handwriting]].

A chancery hand was at first a form of [[handwriting]] for business transactions that developed in the [[Apostolic Chancery|Lateran chancery]] (the ''Cancelleria Apostolica'') of the thirteenth century, then spread to [[France]], notably through the [[Avignon Papacy]], and to [[England]] after 1350.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, John, Malcolm Richardson, and Jane L. Fisher, ''An Anthology of Chancery English'', 3&lt;/ref&gt; This early "chancery hand" is a form of [[blackletter]]. Versions of it were adopted by royal and ducal [[Chancery (medieval office)|chanceries]], which were often staffed by clerics who had taken [[minor orders]].

A later [[cursive]] "chancery hand", also developed in the [[Catholic Church|Vatican]] but based on [[humanist minuscule]] (itself based on [[Carolingian minuscule]]), was introduced in the 1420s by [[Niccolò Niccoli]]; it was the manuscript origin of the typefaces we recognize as ''[[italic type|italic]]''.

==English chancery hand==
In [[medieval England]] each of the royal departments tended to develop its own characteristic hand: the chancery hand used in the royal chancery at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] from the mid-century was employed for [[writ]]s, enrolments, patents, and engrossing of royal letters; its use continued for the enrollment of acts of Parliament until 1836.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/palaeography/doc10/intro.htm UK National Archives, "Palaeography"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The English chancery hand was already an arcane specialty by the time of the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]]. [[Samuel Pepys]] recorded (Thursday 12 July 1660):&lt;ref name="Pepys"&gt;

==Cursive chancery hand==
The later ''cancelleresca corsiva'' ("cursive chancery hand"), often called "Chancery Cursive", developed from [[Humanist minuscule]], itself the progeny of [[Carolingian minuscule]], in the mid-fifteenth century as "a cursive form of the humanistic minuscule".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-G2tQVnPiCAC&amp;pg=PA274&amp;lpg=PA274&amp;dq=cancelleresca+corsiva&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u-Vn--ECtB&amp;sig=nkA0Vittv2NtLfTQb5QAKXiQdz0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AewUU9etC8GEqwGezYDwAQ&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=cancelleresca%2520corsiva&amp;f=false|title=Selected Essays On the History of Letter-forms in Manuscript and Print|last=Morison|first=Stanley|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521183161|page=273|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In England and France at the time it was known as "Italic".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In English it is often changed in spelling to "cancellaresca corsiva".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cancellaresca%2520corsiva|title=Dictionary and Thesaurus {{!}} Merriam-Webster|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian scribe [[Ludovico Vicentino degli Arrighi]]'s 1522 influential pamphlet on handwriting called ''La Operina'' was the first book on writing the [[italic type|italic]] script known as cursive chancery hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Alexander S. |last=Lawson|title=Anatomy of a Typeface |publisher=David R. Godine |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-87923-332-7 |page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a scribe in the [[Papal Curia]], which had refined cursive chancery hand in its infancy during the latter half of the fifteenth century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While considered a cursive, this "papal hand" was "strongly disciplined in form, regular in movement and slightly, if at all, inclined from the perpendicular."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In cursive chancery hand the pen was held slanted at a forty-five-degree angle for speed, but it could also produce beautiful [[Calligraphy|calligraphic]] writing. In fifteenth-century [[Italy]] the cursive chancery hand was employed in correspondence, everyday business, and documents of minor formal importance.

It was adapted as the model for the [[italic type]]face developed by [[Aldus Manutius]] in [[Venice]], from punches cut by [[Francesco Griffo]] and first used in 1500 for the small portable series of inexpensive classics that issued from the Aldine press.

In sixteenth-century England it became known as the "Italian hand" to distinguish it from the angular, cramped, [[Blackletter]]-derived English chancery hand which had been developed earlier and independently.

'''Covering cherub''' (in literary usage) is the [[Anxiety of influence|obstructing presence]] for the artist of the inherited tradition, and cultural predecessors, with which they are faced.

==Origins==
Found originally in [[Ezekiel]], the covering cherub was adapted for use by (among others) both [[John Milton|Milton]] and [[William Blake]].  In the [[William Blake's mythology|Blakean vision]], the covering cherub was a composite but always negative figure of truth's guardian turned destructive,&lt;ref&gt;D. Erdman, ''The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake'' (2008) p. 944 and p. 926&lt;/ref&gt; of a cruel and hardened Selfhood;&lt;ref&gt;N.Marsh, ''William Blake: The Poems'' (2012) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; and it was from Blake that in 1967 [[Harold Bloom]] derived his concept of the covering cherub as a literary/cultural barrier.  Apparently, a waking nightmare he experienced gave rise first to his poem on the subject, "The Covering Cherub", and eventually to his book [[Anxiety of Influence|''The Anxiety of Influence'']].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hilobrow.com/2013/07/11/harold-bloom/ Harold Bloom]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thematics==
For Bloom, "the Covering Cherub then is a demon of continuity...cultural history, the dead poets, the embarrassments  of a tradition grown too wealthy to need anything more".&lt;ref&gt;H. Bloom, ''The Anxiety of Influence'' (1973) p. 39 and p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;  Bloom considered the artistic struggle in [[Freud]]ian terms, as a filial contest with a [[father figure]] carrying cultural authority&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers ed., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; – an [[Oedipal conflict]] with a [[superego]] either originally modelled on a cultural hero&lt;ref&gt;L. Hudson/B. Jarot, ''The Way Men Think'' (1993) p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; or influenced subsequently by such an ideal model.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 2) p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Though initially referencing a patriarchal father/son interaction, the concept of the covering cherub has also been applied to works by women writers such as [[Angela Carter]]&lt;ref&gt;''Bluebeard Gothic'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Virginia Woolf]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Keane, ''John Milton's Paradise Lost'' (2013) p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics have seen Bloom's central image as too open-ended to serve as analyical tool, a vague series of analogies only tenuously working as Bloom desired.&lt;ref&gt;J. Doane, ''Nostalgia and Sexual Difference'' (2013) p. 90-1&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=September 2008}}

In [[computer programming]], '''digraphs''' and '''trigraphs''' are sequences of two and three [[character (computing)|character]]s, respectively, that appear in [[source code]] and, according to a [[programming language]]'s specification, should be treated as if they were single characters.

Various reasons exist for using digraphs and trigraphs: keyboards may not have keys to cover the entire [[character set]] of the language, input of special characters may be difficult, [[text editor]]s may reserve some characters for special use and so on. Trigraphs might also be used for some [[EBCDIC]] [[code page]]s that lack characters such as &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;.

== History ==
The basic character set of the [[C programming language]] is a subset of the [[ASCII]] character set that includes nine characters which lie outside the [[ISO 646]] invariant character set. {{When|This can pose a problem for writing [[source code]] when the [[encoding]] (and possibly [[computer keyboard|keyboard]]) being used does not support any of these nine characters.|date=March 2016}} The [[ANSI C]] committee invented trigraphs as a way of entering source code using keyboards that support any version of the ISO 646 character set.

== {{anchor|TRIGRAPH.EXE}}Implementations ==
Trigraphs are not commonly encountered outside [[compiler]] [[test suite]]s.&lt;ref name="C"/&gt; Some compilers support an option to turn recognition of trigraphs off, or disable trigraphs by default and require an option to turn them on. Some can issue warnings when they encounter trigraphs in source files. [[Borland]] supplied a separate program, the trigraph preprocessor (&lt;code&gt;TRIGRAPH.EXE&lt;/code&gt;), to be used only when trigraph processing is desired (the rationale was to maximise speed of compilation).

== Language support ==
Different systems define different sets of digraphs and trigraphs, as described below.

=== ALGOL ===
Early versions of [[ALGOL]] predated the standardized ASCII and EBCDIC character sets, and were typically implemented using a manufacturer-specific [[six-bit character code]]. A number of ALGOL operations either lacked [[codepoint]]s in the available character set or were not supported by peripherals, leading to a number of substitutions including &lt;code&gt;:=&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;←&lt;/code&gt; (assignment) and &lt;code&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;≥&lt;/code&gt; (greater than or equal).

=== Pascal ===
The [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] programming language supports digraphs &lt;code&gt;(.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;(*&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;*)&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;[&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt; respectively. Unlike all other cases mentioned here, &lt;code&gt;(*&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;*)&lt;/code&gt; were and still are in wide use. However, many compilers treat them as a different type of commenting block rather than as actual digraphs, that is, a comment started with &lt;code&gt;(*&lt;/code&gt; cannot be closed with &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt; and vice versa.

=== J ===
The [[J programming language]] is a descendant of [[APL (programming language)|APL]] but uses the ASCII character set rather than [[APL symbol]]s. Because the printable range of ASCII is smaller than APL's specialized set of symbols, &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; (dot) and &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; (colon) characters are used to inflect ASCII symbols, effectively interpreting unigraphs, digraphs or rarely trigraphs as standalone "symbols".&lt;ref name="Hui_2015"/&gt;

Unlike the use of digraphs and trigraphs in C and [[C++]], there are no single-character equivalents to these in J.

=== C ===
The [[C preprocessor]] replaces all occurrences of the following nine trigraph sequences by their single-character equivalents before any other processing.&lt;ref name="BSI_2003_C"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rationale_2003_C"/&gt;

{|class="wikitable floatright" style="margin-left: 1.5em;"
|-
! Trigraph !! Equivalent
|-
| &lt;code&gt;??=&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;??/&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;??'&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;??(&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;??)&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;??!&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;??&lt;&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;??&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;??-&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;
|}

A programmer may want to place two question marks together yet not have the compiler treat them as introducing a trigraph. The C grammar does not permit two consecutive &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; tokens, so the only places in a C file where two question marks in a row may be used are in multi-character constants, [[string literal]]s, and comments. This is particularly a problem for the [[classic Mac OS]], where the constant &lt;code&gt;'????'&lt;/code&gt; may be used as a file type or creator. To safely place two consecutive question marks within a string literal, the programmer can use string concatenation &lt;code&gt;"...?""?..."&lt;/code&gt; or an [[escape sequence]] &lt;code&gt;"...?\?..."&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;???&lt;/code&gt; is not itself a trigraph sequence, but when followed by a character such as &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; it will be interpreted as &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;??-&lt;/code&gt;, as in the example below which has 16 &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;s before the &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;.

The &lt;code&gt;??/&lt;/code&gt; trigraph can be used to introduce an escaped newline for line splicing; this must be taken into account for correct and efficient handling of trigraphs within the preprocessor.  It can also cause surprises, particularly within comments.  For example:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 // Will the next line be executed????????????????/
 a++;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

which is a single logical comment line (used in C++ and [[C99]]), and

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
 /??/
 * A comment *??/
 /
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

which is a correctly formed block comment.

{|class="wikitable floatright" style="margin-left: 1.5em;"
|-
! Digraph !! Equivalent
|-
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;:&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;[&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;:&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;%&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;%&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;%:&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;
|}

In 1994, a normative amendment to the C standard,{{specify|date=March 2016}} included in C99, supplied digraphs as more readable alternatives to five of the trigraphs. They are listed in the table on the right.

Unlike trigraphs, digraphs are handled during [[Tokenization (lexical analysis)|tokenization]], and any digraph must always represent a full token by itself, or compose the token &lt;code&gt;%:%:&lt;/code&gt; replacing the preprocessor concatenation token &lt;code&gt;##&lt;/code&gt;. If a digraph sequence occurs inside another token, for example a quoted string, or a character constant, it will not be replaced.

=== C++ ===
{|class="wikitable floatright" style="margin-left: 1.5em;"

! Token !! Equivalent
|-
| &lt;code&gt;%:%:&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;##&lt;/code&gt;

|-
| &lt;code&gt;not&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;bitand&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;
|-

|-
| &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;||&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;xor&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;
|-

|-
| &lt;code&gt;or_eq&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|=&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;xor_eq&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;^=&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;not_eq&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|}

[[C++]] (through [[C++14]], see [[#REMOVAL|below]]) behaves like C, including the C99 additions, but with additional tokens listed in the table.&lt;ref name="Stroustrup_1994_DEC"/&gt;

As a note, &lt;code&gt;%:%:&lt;/code&gt; is treated as a single token, rather than two occurrences of &lt;code&gt;%:&lt;/code&gt;.

The C++ Standard makes this comment with regards to the term "digraph":&lt;ref name="OpenSTD"/&gt;
{{Quote|text=The term "digraph" (token consisting of two characters) is not perfectly descriptive, since one of the alternative preprocessing-tokens is &lt;code&gt;%:%:&lt;/code&gt; and of course several primary tokens contain two characters. Nonetheless, those alternative tokens that aren't lexical keywords are colloquially known as "digraphs".}}

{{See also|iso646.h}}

{{Anchor|REMOVAL}}Trigraphs were proposed for deprecation in [[C++0x]], which was released as [[C++11]].&lt;ref name="N2837"/&gt; This was opposed by [[IBM]], speaking on behalf of itself and other users of C++,&lt;ref name="N2910"/&gt; and as a result trigraphs were retained in C++0x. Trigraphs were then proposed again for removal (not only deprecation) in [[C++17]].&lt;ref name="N3981"/&gt; This passed a committee vote, and trigraphs (but not the additional tokens) are removed from C++17 despite the opposition from IBM.&lt;ref name="N4210"/&gt; Existing code that uses trigraphs can be supported by translating from the source files (parsing trigraphs) to the basic source character set that does not include trigraphs.&lt;ref name="N3981"/&gt;

=== {{anchor|TIO}}RPL ===
[[Hewlett-Packard]] calculators supporting the [[Reverse Polish LISP|RPL]] language and input method provide support for a large number of trigraphs (also called ''TIO codes'') to reliably transcribe non-seven-bit ASCII characters of the [[RPL character set|calculators' extended character set]]&lt;ref name="HP82240B_1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HP48G_UG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HP50G_AUR"/&gt; on foreign platforms, and to ease keyboard input without using the {{Mono|CHARS}} application.&lt;ref name="HP-TIO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heinz_2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HP48G_UG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HP50G_AUR"/&gt; The first character of all TIO codes is a &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;, followed by two other ASCII characters vaguely resembling the glyph to be substituted.&lt;ref name="HP-TIO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heinz_2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HP48G_UG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HP50G_AUR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Finseth_2012"/&gt; All other characters can be entered using the special &lt;code&gt;\nnn&lt;/code&gt; TIO code syntax with nnn being a three-digit [[decimal number]] (with [[leading zero]]s if necessary) of the corresponding [[code point]] (thereby formally representing a ''[[tetragraph]]'').&lt;ref name="HP-TIO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HP48G_UG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HP50G_AUR"/&gt;

== Application support ==
=== Vim ===
The [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] text editor supports digraphs for actual entry of text characters, following {{IETF_RFC|1345}}. The entry of digraphs is [[Key binding|bound]] to {{keypress|Ctrl|K}} by default.&lt;ref name="vim"/&gt; The list of all possible digraphs in [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] can be displayed by typing {{keypress|:dig}}.

=== GNU Screen ===
[[GNU Screen]] has a digraph command, bound to {{keypress|Ctrl|A}} {{keypress|Ctrl|V}}&lt;!-- ^A ^V --&gt; by default.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Digraph - Screen User's Manual |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/html_node/Digraph.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lotus ===
[[Lotus 1-2-3]] for [[DOS]] uses {{keypress|Alt|F1}} as [[compose key]] to allow easier input of many special characters of the [[Lotus International Character Set]] (LICS)&lt;ref name="HP_1991_95LXUG"/&gt; and [[Lotus Multi-Byte Character Set]] (LMBCS).

'''Eirug Wyn''' (11 December 1950 – 25 April 2004) was a Welsh satirical novelist who wrote in the [[Welsh language]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/eirug-wyn-549893.html ''The Independent'' obituary, 10 May 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; He was born Eirug Price Wynne, in [[Llanbrynmair]] in [[Mid Wales]], and educated at Brynrefail School and Trinity College, [[Carmarthen]].  He subsequently made his home in [[Groeslon|Y Groeslon]] in [[North Wales]].

At the age of 17 he appeared in court accused of not placing an [[L-plate]] on the back of his [[Automobile|car]], as was required in the United Kingdom for anyone learning to drive (the L is the initial letter of "learner"). Instead, he had placed a similar plate bearing the letter "D", for ''{{lang|cy|dysgwr}}'', the [[Welsh Language|Welsh]] equivalent. The eventual result of this case was to make D-plates equivalent to L-plates throughout Wales.

He wrote 15 books in the twelve years before his death, and won several prizes for his work at [[Eisteddfod]]au, including the prose medal in 1998 and 2000 and the Daniel Owen medal for novelists in 1994 and 2002. He also ran a bookshop in [[Caernarfon]], wrote a column for the ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]'', and edited ''[[Lol!]]'', a satirical magazine. His last book was entitled ''{{lang|cy|Y dyn yn y cefn heb fwstash}}'' (''The Man at the Back Without a Moustache''—{{ISBN|0-86243-735-0}}).

He died of [[Multiple myeloma|myeloma]] on 25 April 2004, at the age of 53.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3786">'''Environmental data''' is that which is based on the measurement of environmental pressures, the state of the environment and the impacts on ecosystems. This is usually the "P", "S" and "I" of the [[DPSIR]] model where D = Drivers, P = Pressures, S = State, I = Impact, R = Response.

Environmental data is typically generated by institutions executing [[environmental law]] or doing environmental research. Environment statistics are usually generated by statistical offices and are considered as environmental data, too. [[Socioeconomics|Socio-economic]] data and other [[Statistics|statistical data]] (often the "D" and the "R" of the DPSIR model) are not considered as environmental data. However, they are to be integrated into comprehensive environmental assessments. Usually this kind of data is held by other institutions than the environmental administration (e.g. National Statistical Offices). The same is true for geo-basisdata, which are not considered as environmental data, but have to be available for environmental policies and environmental information. In recent years, environmental data has become increasingly important to investors, prompting Bloomberg L.P. to begin providing Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) data through their terminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.emisoft.com/bloomberg-esg-matters/|title=Bloomberg ESG and Why It Matters - Emisoft|date=2016-11-15|newspaper=Emisoft|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All data generated by the execution of environmental law are to be considered as environmental data.

'''Environmental Data Management Systems (EDMS)
'''

In order to comply with the above requirements and obligations, certain conditions within them must be met. Typically these will include:

Managing monitoring programmes or schedules, ensuring that the monitoring required in the permit has been done, at the correct locations, for the correct parameters, and at the correct frequency
- Pre-processing, performing calculations and validating the data for compliance with any alert or reporting levels
- Generating routine compliance reports for authorities.
The management of the above can be complex and time-consuming, leading to an increasing uptake of software systems designed to manage environmental compliance. These are often referred to as 'Environmental Data Management Systems' (EDMS), the selection of which is subject to a number of key criteria.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9295">{{short description|Secondary phenomenon that occurs alongside or in parallel to a primary phenomenon}}
An '''epiphenomenon''' (plural: '''epiphenomena''') is a secondary [[phenomenon]] that occurs alongside or in parallel to a primary phenomenon. The word has two [[word sense|senses]],&lt;ref name="MW_Collegiate"&gt;{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |authorlink=Merriam-Webster |title=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/collegiate/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AHD"&gt;{{Citation |author=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |url=https://ahdictionary.com/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; one that [[connotation|connotes]] known [[causality|causation]] and one that connotes absence of causation or reservation of judgment about it.&lt;ref name="MW_Collegiate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AHD"/&gt;

==Examples==
===Metaphysics===
{{Main|Causality}}
The problem of epiphenomena is often a counterexample to theories of causation and is identified with situations in which an event E is caused by (or, is said to be caused by) an event C, which also causes (or, is said to cause) an event F. For example, take a simplified Lewisian counterfactual analysis of causation that the meaning of propositions about causal relationships between two events A and B can be explained in terms of counterfactual conditionals of the form “if A had not occurred then B would not have occurred”. Suppose that C causes E necessarily and that C has an epiphenomenon F necessarily. We then have that if E had not occurred, then F would not have occurred, either. But then according to the counterfactual analysis of causation, the proposition that there is a causal dependence of F on E is true; that is, on this view, E caused F. Since this is not in line with how we ordinarily speak about causation (we would not say that E caused F), a counterfactual analysis seems to be insufficient.

===Philosophy of mind and psychology===
{{Main|Epiphenomenalism}}
An epiphenomenon can be an effect of primary phenomena, but cannot affect a primary phenomenon. In [[philosophy of mind]], [[epiphenomenalism]] is the view that [[mind|mental]] phenomena are epiphenomena in that they can be caused by physical phenomena, but cannot cause physical phenomena.  In strong epiphenomenalism, epiphenomena that are mental phenomena can ''only'' be caused by physical phenomena, not by other mental phenomena.  In weak epiphenomenalism, epiphenomena that are mental phenomena can be caused by both physical phenomena and other mental phenomena, but mental phenomena cannot be the cause of any physical phenomenon.  

The [[physical world]] operates independently of the [[mental world]] in epiphenomenalism; the mental world exists as a derivative [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]] to the physical world, affected by the physical world (and by other epiphenomena in weak epiphenomenalism), but not able to have an effect on the physical world.  [[Instrumentalism|Instrumentalist]] versions of epiphenomenalism allow some mental phenomena to cause physical phenomena, when those mental phenomena can be strictly analyzable as summaries of physical phenomena, preserving causality of the physical world to be strictly analyzable by other physical phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Taylor (philosopher)|Taylor, Richard]] (1963). ''Metaphysics''. First Edition. Eaglewood Cliffs, Prentice-Hall.    &lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine===
In the more general use of the word, a [[causality|causal relationship]] between the phenomena is implied;&lt;ref name="MW_Collegiate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AHD"/&gt; the epiphenomenon is a consequence of the primary phenomenon.&lt;ref name="MW_Collegiate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AHD"/&gt; This is the [[word sense|sense]] that is related to the noun ''[[epiphenomenalism]]''.

However, in [[medicine]], this relationship is typically ''not'' implied, and the word is usually used in its second sense: an epiphenomenon may occur independently, and is called an epiphenomenon because it is not the primary phenomenon under study or because only [[correlation]], not [[causality|causation]], is known or suspected. In this sense, saying that X is [[association (statistics)|associated with]] Y as an epiphenomenon is preserving an acknowledgment that [[correlation does not imply causation]]. [[Medical sign|Signs]], [[symptom]]s, [[syndrome]]s (groups of symptoms), and [[risk factor]]s can all be epiphenomena in this sense. For example, having an increased risk of [[breast cancer]] concurrent with taking an [[antibiotic]] is an epiphenomenon. It is not the antibiotic that is causing the increased risk, but the increased [[inflammation]] associated with the bacterial [[infection]] that prompted the taking of an antibiotic. The [[metaphor]] of a [[tree]] is one way of helping to explain the difference to someone struggling to understand. If the infection is the root of the tree, and the inflammation is the trunk, then the cancer and the antibiotic are two branches; the antibiotic is not the trunk.

===Electromagnetism===
Although [[electronics]] is said to be due to the influence of [[electron]]s, the standard approach to the study of electrical phenomena due to [[James Clerk Maxwell]] views these particles as secondary:
:In [[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism|Maxwell’s theory]], [[electric charge|charge]] and [[electric current|current]] are 'epiphenomena' (secondary appearances) of underlying processes in what he termed, following [[Michael Faraday|Faraday]], the [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s. Indeed, Maxwell’s mature theory stays completely away from microstructure of matter and from any consideration of ‘electric substance’. Instead he proposed that certain quantities should be defined at every point in space, such that relations between them (the [[Maxwell equations]]) and functions of them (such as energy functions) determine phenomena. These quantities (the [[vector field|fields]]) may depend on microphysical events, and indeed Maxwell did expend some effort in his early papers on attempting to explain qualitatively how their relations could result in mechanical motions. However, the theory explains only large-scale phenomena, and it is not necessary to have the microscopic model in mind in order to work successfully with it.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Archibald (1994) "Mathematical theories of electricity and magnetism to 1900", in ''Companion Encyclopedia of the History and Philosophy of the Mathematical Sciences'',  volume 2, page 1216, [[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]] editor, [[Routledge]] {{ISBN|0-415-09239-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
                
===Free will===
According to epiphenomenalism, [[free will]] having an effect on the physical world is an illusion,&lt;ref&gt;[[Shaun Gallagher|Gallagher, Shaun]]; in: Does consciousness cause behavior? Pockett, Susan (ed.); Banks, William P. (ed.); Gallagher, Shaun (ed.); Cambridge, MA,: MIT Press, 2006. pp. 109–124. [Chapter]&lt;/ref&gt; as physical phenomena can only be caused by other physical phenomena.  In weak epiphenomenalism, there is free will to cause some mental effects, allowing for [[mental discipline]] that is directed at other mental phenomena.

===Behaviorism===
Weak versions of [[behaviorism]] in [[psychology]] admit the existence of mental phenomena but not their meaningful study as causes of observable behavior and view mental phenomena as either epiphenomena or linguistic summaries, [[instrumentalism|instruments]] to examine objectively observable physical behavior.

=== Complexity ===
In the field of [[complex systems]], the term epiphenomenon tends to be used interchangeably with "emergent effect".

=== Propositional theory ===
[[Zenon Pylyshyn]] suggested a [[propositional model of cognition]] where people do not conceptualize ideas in images but rather in meaningful relationships.  In this theory, epiphenomena refer to images because they are merely products people conceptualize from their actual thought processes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Sternberg|Sternberg, R.]] (2005). Cognitive psychology. 5th ed., Pearson, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pylyshyn defends his claim by explaining that we only see images when we envision the form of an object.  While visualizing objects or actions is a frequent process in our mind, it does not occur when we are considering the meaning behind an action or the non-visual properties of an object.  There are many concepts we simply cannot envision.&lt;ref&gt;Pylyshyn, Z. (2003). Return of the mental image: are there really pictures in the brain? Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 7(3), 113–118. doi:10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00003-2&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, when envisioning an image, it changes based on our preconceived notions, suggesting that semantic relations precede visual images.  Unfortunately, the idea of epiphenomena in propositional theory is largely subjective and not [[falsifiable]].&lt;ref&gt;Pylyshyn, Z. (2003). Explaining mental imagery: Now you see it, now you don't. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 7(3), 111–112. doi: 10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00004-4&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1548">'''''Esthesic''''' (UK ''aesthesic'') and '''''poietic''''' are terms used in [[semiotics]], the study of [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]], to describe perceptive and [[productive]] levels, processes, and analyses of [[symbol]]ic forms.

Like [[emic and etic|'emic' and 'etic']], both words appear to be derived from a suffix, ''-poietic'' (from {{lang-el|ποιητικός}} "creative") meaning productive or formative and ''-esthesic'' (from αἴσθησις "sense") being receptive or perceptive, in relation to the [[neutral level]]. The neutral level is the "trace" left behind, the physical or material creation of esthesic and poietic processes.

Thus, "a symbolic form... is not some 'intermediary' in a process of 'communication' that transmits the meaning intended by the author to the audience; it is instead the result of a complex ''process'' of creation (the poietic process) that has to do with the form as well as the content of the work; it is also the point of departure for a complex process of reception (the esthesic process) that ''reconstructs'' a 'message.'"

'''Friso-Saxon''' is a collective name for a group of [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] dialects found around the [[North Sea]] coast of [[the Netherlands]] and [[Germany]], in an area historically known as [[Frisia]]. Although they are forms of [[Low German|Low German/Low Saxon]], these dialects have experienced strong influence from the [[Frisian languages]]. Most of the Friso-Saxon dialects are spoken in areas which were historically Frisian-speaking, until Frisian was replaced with Low Saxon in the [[Late Middle Ages]]. However, Frisian has remained a [[substratum]] since then in the regions concerned. The only exception to this rule is [[Stellingwarfs]], a Low Saxon dialect which has undergone influence especially from [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]]. Most of the other Friso-Saxon dialects underwent most influence from [[Saterlandic Frisian language|East Frisian]], for example [[East Frisian Low Saxon]] and [[Gronings]], while the dialect of [[Dithmarschen]] underwent most influence from [[North Frisian language|North Frisian]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4160">'''Infiltration''' is the [[diffusion]] or [[wikt:accumulation|accumulation]] (in a [[biological tissue|tissue]] or [[cell (biology)|cell]]s) of foreign substances or in amounts in excess of the normal.  The material collected in those tissues or cells is called '''infiltrate'''.

==Definitions of infiltration==
As part of a disease process, infiltration is sometimes used to define the invasion of [[cancer]] cells into the underlying matrix or the blood vessels. Similarly, the term may describe the deposition of [[amyloid]] protein. During [[leukocyte extravasation]], [[white blood cell|white blood cells]] move in response to [[cytokines]] from within the blood, into the diseased or infected tissues, usually in the same direction as a chemical gradient&lt;ref&gt;Kumar et al. 2014, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;, in a process called [[chemotaxis]]. The presence of [[lymphocyte]]s in tissue in greater than normal numbers is likewise called infiltration.

As part of medical intervention, [[local anaesthetics]] may be injected at more than one point so as to infiltrate an area prior to a surgical procedure. However, the term may also apply to unintended [[iatrogenic]] leakage of fluids from phlebotomy or intravenous drug delivery procedures, a process also known as [[extravasation]] or "tissuing".

==Causes==
Infiltration  may be caused by:
* Puncture of distal vein wall during venipuncture
* Puncture of any portion of the vein wall by mechanical friction from the catheter/needle cannula
* Dislodgement of the catheter/needle cannula from the intima of the vein which may be a result of a poorly secured IV device or inappropriate choice of venous site to puncture.
* Improper cannula size or excessive delivery rate of the fluid

==Signs and symptoms==
The signs and symptoms of infiltration include:
* Inflammation at or near the insertion site with swollen, taut skin with pain
* Blanching and coolness of skin around IV site
* Damp or wet dressing
* Slowed or stopped infusion
* No backflow of blood into IV tubing on lowering the solution container.

===Grading===
{| class="wikitable sortable collapsible" border="1"
|-
! Grade || Skin appearance || Edema || Skin on examination || Symptoms
|-
| 0. || colspan="4" | No symptoms
|-
| 1. || Skin blanched || Edema &lt; 1 inch in any direction || Cool to touch || With or without pain
|-
| 2. || Skin blanched || Edema 1-6 inches in any direction || Cool to touch || With or without pain
|-

|}

===Nursing treatment===
The use of [[warm compresses]] to treat infiltration has become controversial. It has been found that cold compresses may be better for some infiltrated infusates.  If the infiltration is recent and the solution was hypertonic or had an increased pH, a cold compress can be applied. A warm compress can be applied if a small amount of non-caustic solution has infiltrated over a long period, or if the solution is isotonic with normal pH.

It has also been documented that elevation of the infiltrated extremity may be painful for the patient.

To act in the best interest of the patient, following IV infiltration, consult with the physician for orders regarding compresses and elevation.

'''Jakob Sande''' (1 December 1906 – 16 March 1967) was a Norwegian writer, poet and [[folk singer]] from Dale in [[Sunnfjord]]. His parents were Andreas Sande and Ragna Margrete (born Barsnes). He married Solveig Ytterlid in 1942 and they had a daughter, Siri, in 1943.

He wrote all his texts in [[nynorsk]], one of the two official Norwegian written language forms. His work helped secure a special place on the Norwegian culture-scene for the municipality [[Fjaler]].

==Biography==
Sande was born on 1 December 1906 in the village of [[Dale, Sogn og Fjordane|Dale]] in [[Sunnfjord]] in the county of [[Sogn og Fjordane]], Norway. His parents, Anders (father) and Ragna Margrete (mother), lived at [[Klokkargarden]].

His career as a writer spanned from 1929 to 1967. He completed his cand philol exam in 1931, but then he went to work at sea as he had been drawn to that life from early on. In 1934 he started to work as a [[lector]] in [[Fredrikstad]]. After [[World War II]] he moved to the same position at [[Ullern gymnas]] in Oslo.

In 1963, he decided to quit teaching and devote his life to writing. That year he received a [[stipend]] of 15 000 [[Norwegian kroner]] and was promised the same for 1964 and 1965.

His later years were marked by ill health.

He died on 16 March 1967 at age 61.

==Writings==
Sande's first poems were published in 1929 in a volume titled ''Svarte næter'' (''Black Nights''). The book was not welcomed by conservative Christians because of language deemed "straightforward" and "foul" for that time. Other readers loved the work's sense of humor, irony, and his wonderful descriptions of nature.

His second book of poems, ''Storm frå vest'', was published in 1931. Conservative Christians criticized this work as well, even though one of the poems, "Salme," was later used in a collection of religious poems.

In 1933, the book ''Frå Sundfjord til Rio'' (''From [[Sunnfjord]] to [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio]]'') was published. In three parts, the book described the sea, differences between the officers and the crew, bordellos, ports, and fighting in pubs.

1939 saw the publication of ''Krossen og sleggja'' (''The Cross and the Sledgehammer''), a collection of all his previous poems, as well as ten new ones.

One of his most famous poems, "Da Daniel drog" ("When Daniel Left") was published in the collection ''Guten og Grenda'' (''The Boy and the Village''). The poem is sometimes referred to as "Vesle Daniel" ("Little Daniel").

''Korn og klunger'' was published in 1950, and ''Sirius'' in 1955.

His last book, ''Det kveldar på Kobbeskjer'', was published in 1961.

His poems vary from a burlesque and a sometimes grotesque humor as in ''Kallen og katten'' and ''Likfunn'' to high emotionality as in  ''Fløytelåt'' and ''Vesle Daniel''

His beautiful song ''[[Det lyser i stille grender]]'' is included in most Norwegian books of hymns and is a very popular Christmas song.

His poem ''Etter ein rangel'' is very famous.

Many of Jakob Sande's poems have been set to music.  Two of the most popular groups who specialise in Jakob Sande lyrics are [[Aftenlandet]] and Jubelhornet.

==Commemoration==
*In 2002, 35 years after his death, Sande's birth community of Dale erected a statue by sculptor [[Sivert Donali]] in tribute to Sande's poem "Vesle Daniel." [http://www.nrk.no/img/193843.jpeg Picture of Vesle Daniel statue]
*In 2006 on Jacob Sande's 100 years anniversary, the Faroese singer and composer [[Hanus G. Johansen]] released an album with poems by Jakob Sande, which Hanus G. had composed melodies for. The album was called ''Frå leddigen – Jakob Sande-dikt i færøysk tonedrakt''. The music was played by the Faroese ensemble [[Aldubáran]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olavurjakobsen.com/DiscographyInnspaelingslisti/Hanus.html Olavurjacobsen.com, HANUS and ALDUBÁRAN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208134037/http://www.olavurjakobsen.com/DiscographyInnspaelingslisti/Hanus.html |date=8 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9415">[[File:VIII. Internationales Finale in Warschau 2014.JPG|thumb|VIII. International final in Warsaw, Poland 2014]]
'''Jugend debattiert international''' is a German-language [[debating]] competition for students based on the national German pupils' contest ''Jugend debattiert''. It is held in ten countries of Central and Eastern Europe: [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]] ([[Moscow]] and [[St. Petersburg]]), [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Hungary]]. The project is funded by the [[Goethe-Institut]], the [[Foundation "Remembrance, Responsibility and Future"]], the Hertie Foundation and the Central Agency for German Schools Abroad (Zentralstelle für das Auslandsschulwesen). There are local supporters in three countries: In Czech Republic the project is supported by the Czech-German Future Fund, in Lithuania by the Lithuanian Information and Technology Center for students. In Poland Jugend debattiert international is supported by the Foundation for Polish-German Cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jugend-debattiert.eu/&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Competition==
''Jugend debattiert international'' is the only international German-language debating contest for students.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} It helps young people in Central and Eastern Europe to advocate their views and opinions and represents and promotes the German language as a medium of [[debate]]. Beyond supporting language acquisition, it strengthens conversation skills and promotes a deeper understanding of [[democracy]]. Thus the project not only encourages democracy, but also works towards the formation of an international young elite. The debates revolve around topics such as school life, [[fundamental rights]], history (especially historical experiences of injustice), and [[Europe]]. ''Jugend debattiert international'' targets students from 10th grade onwards who master German at least to the level of B2 of the [[Common European Framework of Reference]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jugend-debattiert.eu/idee/wettbewerb/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015/16 more than 2300 students at 157 schools took part in the competition. The project is integrated into the curriculum. In class students are trained in the rules of debating and enter the competition on a school level. The best students compete the next stages of the competition: school district and national level. The winners (first and second) from each of the eight countries will finally compete in the international finale. Since the fourth international finale 2010 in Berlin, the winners of the German competition ''Jugend debattiert'' support them as advisors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jugend-debattiert.eu/idee/wettbewerb/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and evaluation of the debates==
The format of the [[debate]] is strictly set up: Four students, two on the ''pro'' side, two on the ''contra'' side, debate for 24 minutes in German language on socio-political issues (e.g., "Should Turkey accede to the European Union?"). The debate starts with an opening round in which every participant has two minutes to outline his or her position. In the following twelve minutes the four debaters can exchange their arguments without strict regulations. During the final round the participants have one minute each to reflect on the arguments and summarize their final position in the light of the debate.
A jury of three evaluates the debate according to the following points: expertise, eloquence, conversational competence and persuasiveness. Language skills are not included in the assessment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jugend-debattiert.eu/idee/die-debatte/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Jugend debattiert international'' was first carried out in Poland and the Czech Republic in 2005. Since 2006, schools in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Ukraine have been taking part in the project. In 2009 Moscow and Saint Petersburg joined the competition after a two-year pilot phase.
In 2007, students from all seven countries and Germany met for the first international finale in [[Prague]] under the auspices of the former president of Czech Republic, [[Václav Havel]]. Winners of the first international finale were Jakub Štefela from [[Liberec]], Czech Republic and Peer Klüßendorf from [[Rostock]], Germany. The Second international finale took place in October 2008 in ''Warsaw'' under the auspices of the [[Sejm Marshal]] of the Republic of Poland, Mr. [[Bronislaw Komorowski]]. Barbara Wasilewska from Warsaw, Poland and Wiebke Neelsen from [[Wismar]], Germany, won this competition. In February 2010 the third international finale took place in Prague. Jitka Rutrlová from Prague, Czech Republic and Maximilian Behrens from [[Münster]], Germany, were the winners of the final debate. The fourth international finale was held in [[Berlin]] in November 2010. Irina Avdeeva from Russia was awarded first place in competition 2009/2010 after the final debate. In 2011 the international final took place for the fifth time in [[Kiev]], Ukraine. Annett Lymar from Estonia won the final debate. In 2012 the sixth international final was won by the Hungarian student Gréta Szabó from [[Budapest]]. The international final was held for the seventh time in 2013 in [[Budapest]]. Dominika Perlínová from the Czech Republic was announced as the international winner. The 8th international final took place in Warsaw. Anastasija Minitš from Estonia won this year´s competition. In 2015 the international finale was held for the 9th time in Latvian capital Riga. The international winner was Anna Ryan from Hungary. From 2016 on, Slovakia and Slovenia take part in the project. In this year the international final took place in Prague and Khoi Nguyen won in his hometown.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41764">The verbal morphology of the [[Kagoshima dialect]]s is heavily marked by numerous distinctive [[Kagoshima dialect#Phonological Processes|phonological processes]], as well as both morphological and lexical differences.  The following article deals primarily with the changes and differences affecting the verb conjugations of the central Kagoshima dialect, spoken throughout most of the mainland and especially around [[Kagoshima|Kagoshima City]], though notes on peripheral dialects may be added.  Like [[Japanese verb conjugation|standard Japanese]], verbs do not inflect for person or plurality, and come in nine basic stems.  However, contrary to the standard language, all verbs ending with the stem ''-ru'' conjugate regularly as [[Japanese consonant and vowel verbs|consonant-stem verbs]], though irregularities are present in other forms.

Most notably, the distinction and irregular conjugation pattern of the ''shimo nidan'' or "lower bigrade" ending ''-(y)uru'', which corresponds to standard Japanese ''-eru'', is still preserved in the dialect.  However, ''kami nidan'' or "upper bigrade" verbs ending in ''-iru'' have merged with all other verbs ending in ''-ru'', in a similar fashion to other Kyushu dialects like that of [[Ōita dialect#Verbs|Ōita]].

The imperfective form, also known as the plain, the dictionary or the non-past form, is primarily used to mark a generic, affirmative action and generally overlaps the present and future tenses in English.  So, for instance, a statement like 彼やあそけ行っ ''aya asoke iʔ'' could mean either "he is going over there" or "he will be going over there".  Typically, context will provide the meaning, though temporal adverbs such as 今日 ''kyu'' "today", 今 ''inma'' "now" or 明日 ''ashita'' "tomorrow" may be used for clarification.

With regards to its conjugation paradigm, the imperfective form ends in ''-u'' for all verbs as in standard Japanese.  Notably, however, the resulting stem is reduced according to the dialect's phonological rules.  Thus, for vowel stems, ''-u'' will either coalesce with the previous vowel of the verb or become a moraic obstruent, while for nasal stems it reduces to a moraic nasal and for obstruents, a moraic obstruent.  This applies to most areas of Kagoshima with some exceptions: namely, the peripheral islands, such as [[Ōsumi Islands|Ōsumi]] (including Tanegashima) and [[Koshikijima Islands|Koshikijima]], do not reduce the endings.

When used predicatively, verbs in their imperfective form are commonly appended particles such as ど ''do'' and が ''ga'' in order to add more emphasis to the statement being said.  In this way, 俺や書っど ''oya kaddo'' "I will write (it)" adds more insistence or assertion than saying  俺や書っ ''oya kaʔ'' alone.  When used attributively, the verb is simply followed directly by the word or phrase it modifies: 書っ人 ''kaʔ futo'' (or ''kaffuto'') "a person who writes".

&lt;div style="clear:both;"  &gt;&lt;/div&gt;

== Perfective ==
The [[perfective aspect|perfective]] or completive ending ''-ta'', and its allomorph ''-da'', marks an action or an event as a whole, often one that has previously taken place.  It is thus frequently referred to as the "past tense" in English descriptions, though this is not always the case.  In Southern Tanegashima, this ending is pronounced ''-tō'' and has ''-dō'' as its allomorphic variant.

In contrast to standard Japanese, verbs ending in ''-u'' will take on the form ''-uta'' rather than ''-tta'', as in ''omou'' → ''omouta'' → ''omota''.  Similarly, a number of verbs with the morphological ending ''-gu'' will become ''-uda'', while others will tend towards ''-ida''.  For example, 稼ぐ ''kasegu'' "labour" becomes ''kaseida'', which is then coalesced as ''kaseda'', whereas 繋ぐ ''tsunagu'' "tie" becomes ''tsunouda'', which reduces to the form ''tsunoda''.  The same phenomenon can be observed with the ''-ku'' ending: while most verbs would become ''-ita'', such as 書く ''kaku'' "write" → ''kaita'' → ''kete'', some also become ''-uta'', such as 退く ''noku'' "step aside" → ''nouta'' → ''nota''.

Negation is expressed by appending the suffix ''-n'' at the end of a verb in its imperfective stem form.  This can be achieved by simply replacing the final ''-u'' in the underlying plain form with ''-a'', and then tagging on the negative suffix: ''kaku'' → ''kakan'' "not write", ''wakaru'' → ''wakaran'' "not understand", etc.  The two main irregularities in this form relate to verbs that stem in ''-ru'' and ''-su'' in their plain forms.  Verbs with the stem ''-ru'' may take on the ending ''-tan'' instead of ''-ran'', especially if the preceding syllable is a devoiced one.  So the negative form of the verb ''shiru'' "know" is ''shitan'' rather than ''shiran'', as the syllable ''shi'' {{IPA|[ɕi̥]}} is devoiced.  The alternative ending ''-yan'' is much more rare, occurring only in a few regions, and most prominently only when the preceding syllable contains a non-devoiced {{IPA|[i]}}.  For verbs with the stem ''-su'', the ending may be realized as either ''-san'' or ''-han'' with no rules governing its use other than speaker and dialect preference.

Verbs whose underlying imperfective form ends in ''-uru'' (''-eru'' in standard Japanese), otherwise known as ''shimo nidan'' or "lower bigrade" verbs, are also noticeably irregular.  For such verbs, the entire ending become ''-en'' when negated.  For example, the underlying verb 見ゆる ''miyuru'' becomes 見えん ''mien'' "not be seen", and 投ぐる ''naguru'' becomes 投げん ''nagen'' "not give up".&lt;ref name="SGN" /&gt;

Contrary to popular belief, the suffix ''-n'' does not derive from a relaxed pronunciation of the standard negative form ''-nai'', as demonstrated through the discrepancy between such forms as ''minai'' → *''miran'' "not see", and ''shinai'' → *''sen'' "not do".  Further, considering the phonological characteristics of the dialect, the form ''-ne'' would be expected if such were the case.  Rather, the negative suffix ''-n'' derives from the older attributive suffix ''-nu'', which can still be encountered in various literary works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A reference grammar of Japanese | first=Samuel Elmo | last=Martin | publisher=University of Hawaii Press | year=2004 | isbn=9780824828189 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SszxbMtHbs8C | page=372}}&lt;/ref&gt;  And while the oldest examples showing ''-nai'' date back to the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A reference grammar of Japanese | first=Samuel Elmo | last=Martin | publisher=University of Hawaii Press | year=2004 | isbn=9780824828189 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SszxbMtHbs8C | page=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''-nu'' is attested as early as the 8th century in the [[Kojiki]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A descriptive grammar of early Old Japanese prose | first=John R. | last=Bentley | publisher=[[Brill Publishers|BRILL]] | page=139 | year=2001 | isbn=9004123083}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is believed to have already been reduced to its present form ''-n'' during the [[Edo period]].  The first line of the 11th century classical novel [[The Tale of Genji]] provides an example of its use: "''(...) ito yamugoto-naki kifa-ni-fa '''ara-&lt;u&gt;nu&lt;/u&gt;''' ga (...)''", translated as "though (she) '''is &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt;''' quite of a nobel birth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.reference-global.com/doi/abs/10.1515/9783110219302.257 | first=Yasuhiko | last=Kato | publisher=de Gruyter Mouton | year=2010 | page=262 | isbn=9783110219296| doi=10.1515/9783110219302.257 | chapter=Negation in Classical Japanese | title=The Expression of Negation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The past negative form can be accomplished by compounding the regular negative verb form with the past form of the copula, yielding such constructions as ''kakanjatta'', ''kakannyatta'', or, more rarely, ''kakannatta'' "did not write" depending on the region's preferred variant.  The form ''-nkatta'', as in ''kakankatta'', has also been observed in the Ōsumi and Morokata regions, as well as the city of Kagoshima itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www2.ninjal.ac.jp/hogen/dp/gaj-pdf/gaj-map-legend/vol4/GAJ4-151.pdf | journal=Grammar Atlas of Japanese Dialects | title=行かなかった | publisher=The National Language Research Institute | issue=151 | year=1999 | accessdate=2010-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative commands or orders are informally marked by tagging on the suffix ''-na'' to the plain form: 行く ''iku'' "to go" → 行っな ''inna'', ''iʔna'' (most regions), 行くな ''ikuna'' (Tanegashima, Koshikijima), 行っだ ''idda'' (Yakushima) "don't go".&lt;ref name="GAJD221"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www2.ninjal.ac.jp/hogen/dp/gaj-pdf/gaj-map-legend/vol5/GAJ5-221.pdf | journal=Grammar Atlas of Japanese Dialects | title=【行くな】よ（やさしく） | publisher=The National Language Research Institute | issue=221 | year=1999 | accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GAJD223"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www2.ninjal.ac.jp/hogen/dp/gaj-pdf/gaj-map-legend/vol5/GAJ5-223.pdf | journal=Grammar Atlas of Japanese Dialects | title=【行くな】よ（きびしく） | publisher=The National Language Research Institute | issue=223 | year=1999 | accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In western Ōsumi, the ''-na'' suffix commonly co-occurs with the auxiliary verb ''yaru'', which is then combined to the continuative ''i'' form of a verb: 行く ''iku'' → 行っきゃっな ''ikkyanna''.&lt;ref name="GAJD221" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GAJD223" /&gt;  Formally, negative commands are marked by appending ''-ji(n)'' either directly to the imperfective ending or to the negative form: 行く ''iku'' → 行かぢ ''ikaji'', or 行かんじ ''ikanji'' "do not go".

Lastly, the negative form can also be used as a suggestive or light imperative when followed by the particle か ''ka''.  Thus, for the verb "eat", 食わんか ''kuwan ka'' would effectively mean along the lines of "go ahead and eat" or simply "(please) eat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.geocities.co.jp/Milkyway-Vega/8361/kagomaben.html | title=本命竜馬の特選　鹿児島弁辞典 | language=Japanese |trans-title=Kagoshima Dialect Dictionary | accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Note that this form is not the same as the standard Japanese construction ''-nai ka?'', as it functions more as an imperative than a negative question.  So a sentence like ゆっくい行かんか ''yukkui ikan ka'' would mean "(please) go slowly"&lt;ref name="shizuo"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www6.shizuokanet.ne.jp/kirameki/hougen/kagoshima.htm| title=鹿児島県の方言ページ | accessdate=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not "won't you go slowly?", unless the intonation is explicitly rising.

The ''i form'', also called the conjunctive, the continuative, the infinitive, the nominative or the ''ren'yōkei'' form, may be used for two main purposes: deriving nouns from verbs and creating compound constructions.  This form can be achieved by simply changing the vowel ''-u'' of the underlying plain form to ''-i'', and then applying the necessary sound changes afterwards.  Contrary to the standard Japanese language, this form is completely regular for verbs ending with the plain stem ''-ru''.  Thus, the underlying verb 食もる ''tamoru'' "eat" would become 食もい ''tamoi'' (&lt; ''tamori''), instead of just reducing to the root as in standard Japanese.

There may, however, be some irregularity when deriving nouns or compounds, as verbs ending with the plain stems ''-u'' and ''-ru'' may become a moraic obstruent as opposed to the vowel {{IPA|/i/}}.  For example, the underlying verb 買う ''kau'' "buy" could become {{IPA|/kaQ/}} in its nominal form rather than {{IPA|/ke/}} "buying", also creating a doublet between かっもん {{IPA|/kaQmoN/}} and けもん {{IPA|/kemoN/}} "shopping".&lt;ref name="RTYverb" /&gt;  Similarly, the underlying verb 知る ''shiru'' "know" could become {{IPA|/siQ/}} rather than {{IPA|/sii/}}, leading to the polite construction 知っもさん {{IPA|/siQmosaN/}} "not know" rather than {{IPA|/si(i)mosaN/}}.

Further, when the ''i form'' is used in a compound construction and the second verb begins with a vowel or a palatal consonant, the underlying stem may:

* Glide directly into the following vowel, especially with verbs whose base stem is ''ru'' (e.g. 取る ''toru'' + 上ぐる ''aguru'': とり ''tori'' + あぐる ''aguru'' → とやぐっ ''toyaguʔ'' "pick up");
* Be doubled, especially with verbs whose underlying stem is a nasal consonant (e.g. 読む ''yomu'' + やる ''yaru'': よみ ''yomi'' + やる ''yaru'' → よっみゃっ ''yommyaʔ'' "''(formal)'' read");
* Be doubled and glided to avoid a hiatus, especially with verbs whose underlying stem is a plosive consonant (e.g. 打つ ''utsu'' + 置く ''oku'': うち ''uchi'' + おく ''oku'' → うっちょっ ''utchoʔ'' "leave things as is").

The use of the ''i form'' for linking verbs together and creating compounds is especially prominent for adding a nuance of politeness.  The verbs やる ''yaru'', やす ''yasu'' and やんす ''yansu'', for instance, act as honorific auxiliaries and are frequently used in imperative constructions as in 食もいやんせ ''tamoi-yanse'' "please eat" or 遊っびゃんせ ''asubbyanse'' "please play" (also 遊っやんせ ''asuʔ-yanse''), which would be the equivalent of 食べなさい ''tabenasai'' and 遊びなさい ''asobinasai'' in standard Japanese.  Similarly, the verbs もす ''mosu'' (or もうす ''mōsu'' in Tanegashima) and もんす ''monsu'', sometimes written as 申す and 申んす,&lt;ref name="RTYaux"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.geocities.jp/rtymg285/7zyodousi.html | title=助動詞 | language=Japanese |trans-title=Auxiliary Verbs | accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; will add a degree of politeness akin to the standard Japanese ending ます ''-masu''.  Thus, for 食もる ''tamoru'' "eat" and 読む ''nomu'' "drink", the polite forms would be 食もいもす ''tamoi-mosu'' and 飲んもす ''non-mosu'' respectively.

The ''te form'' or the participle form functions in much the same way as it does in standard Japanese, being able to link different verbs and clauses together, and on its own expressing a slight command.  It differs, however, largely in its pronunciation. Depending on the speaker and dialect, it might be pronounced anywhere from {{IPA|[te̞]}}, {{IPA|[t͡ɕe̞]}}, {{IPA|[sse̞(ː)]}} or {{IPA|[ɕɕe̞(ː)]}}, which may or may not be reflected with the spellings て ''te'', ちぇ ''che'', っせ(え) ''sse(e)'' and っしぇ(ー) ''sshe(e)''.&lt;ref name="RTYverb"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.geocities.jp/rtymg285/7dousi.html | title=動詞 | language=Japanese |trans-title=Verbs | accessdate=2012-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.geocities.jp/rtymg285/7tagyouenotenn.html | title=他行の音節への転音 | language=Japanese |trans-title=Sound changes pertaining to alveolar plosives | accessdate=2012-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its voiced counterpart ''de'' exhibits the same phenomenon, being pronounced {{IPA|[de̞]}}, {{IPA|[d͡ʑe̞]}} or {{IPA|[ʑe̞]}}, which could be written as で ''de'', ぢぇ ''je'' or じぇ ''je'' respectively.&lt;ref name="RTYverb" /&gt;  The spellings て ''te'' and で ''de'' are here favoured, though the affricated pronunciations {{IPA|[t͡ɕe̞]}} and {{IPA|[ʑe̞]}} are the most common.

The form also differs slightly in its paradigm, as verbs that end with the morphological ending ''-u'' will take on the form ''-ute'' rather than ''-tte'', which is used in the standard language.  For example, the underlying verb 会う ''au'' "meet" would become あうて ''aute'', which is then coalesced to the form おて ''ote''.&lt;ref name="RTYverb" /&gt;  Similarly, a number of verbs with the morphological ending ''-gu'' will become ''-ude'', while others will tend towards ''-ide''.  For example, 剥ぐ ''hagu'' "tear off" becomes ''haide'', which is then coalesced as ''hede'', while 急ぐ ''isogu'' "rush" becomes ''isoude'' in its underlying form, which is then coalesced as ''isode''.&lt;ref name="RTYverb" /&gt;  This can also be observed with the ending ''-ku'', although to a much lesser extent.  Most verbs ending in ''-ku'' will become ''-ite'' in this form, so that 書く ''kaku'' "write" becomes ''kaite'', which is then coalesced as ''kete''.&lt;ref name="RTYverb" /&gt;  A few others will become ''-ute'', so that 退く ''noku'' "step aside/down" becomes ''noute'', which is coalesced as ''note''.&lt;ref name="RTYverb" /&gt;  Lastly, for verbs with the stems ''-mu'' and ''-bu'', the ending ''-nde'' may be optionally vocalized as ''-ude''.  So 飛ぶ ''tobu'' "fly" could become either ''tonde'' or ''tode'' (&lt; ''toude'').&lt;ref name="RTYverb" /&gt;  And for verbs ending in ''-su'', the form ''-shite'' may be reduced to ''-ite'', so that 貸す ''kasu'' "lend" becomes ''kaite'' instead of ''kashite'', which may be coalesced into ''kete''.&lt;ref name="RTYverb" /&gt;

The [[Continuous and progressive aspects#Japanese|continuous or progressive]] aspect, which is formed with the ''te form'' followed by the auxiliary いる ''iru'' in standard Japanese, follows a similar development in most Kagoshima dialects, using the auxiliary verb おる ''oru'' instead.  The ''te form'' is then combined and merged with the verb, becoming ちょる ''-choru'' or in some areas とる ''-toru'', which have ぢょる (じょる) ''-joru'' and どる ''doru'' as their respective voiced counterparts.  Thus, as the ''te form'' of the verb 食う ''kuu'' "eat" is くて ''kute'', its progressive form would generally be expressed as 食ちょっ ''kuchoʔ'' "eating", while the progressive form of 読む ''yomu'' "read" would become either 読んぢょっ ''yonjoʔ'' or 読ぢょっ ''yojoʔ'' "reading", reflecting the voicing in its participle forms 読んで ''yonde'' and 読で ''yode''.  In other dialects, the continuous-progressive aspect is constructed using the ''i form'' followed by the auxiliary ''oru''.  Some dialects may even make a semantic distinction between the two, with the first marking the [[resultative]] aspect, and the second, the continuous aspect.  So 雨が降っちょっ ''ame ga futchoʔ'' would effectively mean "it has rained", while 雨が降よっ ''ame ga fuyoʔ'' would mean "it is raining".

The imperative form is achieved by replacing the vowel ''-u'' of the underlying plain form to ''-e'', and subsequently applying the appropriate sound changes.  Namely, vowel coalescence is usually observed with verbs whose stem ends in just a vowel, and for verbs whose stem is ''-ru'', the resulting form ''-re'' is often reduced to ''-i'', so that 食もれ ''tamore'' would become 食もい ''tamoi'' "eat!".  This leads to overlap with the ''i form'', though context is usually sufficient to disambiguate the two.  The form is regularized in comparison to [[Japanese verb conjugation#Imperative|standard Japanese]], as the dialect only makes use of the ending ''-e'' and never ''-ro'' as an imperative, and the form ''-i'' observed with ''-ru'' verbs is here the result of a regular sound change, whereas in Japanese it is not so due to borrowing from the [[Kansai dialect]].

In order to form polite imperative commands, the auxiliary verb やる ''yaru'', along with its variants やす ''yasu'' and やんす ''yansu'', may be changed to its imperative form and appended to another verb in its conjunctive ''i form''.  For example, the polite form of the verb "eat" could become 食もいやい ''tamoi-yai'' or 食もいやんせ ''tamoi-yanse'' "please eat!".  When it comes to verbs whose stems reduce to a moraic obstruent in the ''i form'', two outcomes are possible.  First, the auxiliary can be appended directly without any change, giving 書っやい ''kaʔ-yai'' for "please write".&lt;ref name="RTYliaison"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.geocities.jp/rtymg285/7zyodousi.html | title=転音:連声（れんじょう） | language=Japanese |trans-title=Sound changes: liaison (sandhi) | accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Otherwise, the underlying stem will usually be doubled and subsequently glided in order to avoid a hiatus, resulting in the form 書っきゃい ''kakkyai'' for "please write".&lt;ref name="RTYliaison" /&gt;

The volitional or presumptive form is essentially used to express either intention or probability.  It is historically formed by appending the speculative or intentional suffix ''-u'', itself a reduction of the earlier form ''you'', to the conjunctive ''i'' form.&lt;ref name="RTYaux" /&gt;  The resulting ending was then contracted to ''-ō'' and later ''-o'' in the mainland dialects.  One main exception to this is that for verbs whose underlying imperfective form ends in ''-uru'' (''-eru'' in standard Japanese), otherwise known as ''shimo nidan'' or "lower bigrade" verbs, the entire ending is reduced to ''-u'' instead.&lt;ref name="RTYverb" /&gt;  For example, the verb 開くっ ''akuʔ'' (standard 開ける ''akeru'') "open" becomes 開く ''aku'' "intend on opening",&lt;ref name="RTYverb" /&gt; and 上ぐっ ''aguʔ'' (standard 上げる ''ageru'') "raise" becomes 上ぐ ''agu'' "intend on raising".&lt;ref name="RTYaux" /&gt;  Another exception is that, for verbs modelled off the verbs "to do" or "to come", otherwise known as ''sagyō'' and ''kagyō'' irregular verbs, the endings become ''-sū'' or ''-ku'' respectively.&lt;ref name="RTYaux" /&gt;

This form is also noticeably used in conjunction with the verb ごたっ ''gotaʔ'' (ごたる ''gotaru''), or its variants ごあっ ''goaʔ'' and ごちゃっ ''gochaʔ'',&lt;ref name="SGN"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kagoshimakenjinkai.ne.jp/kaggoma.html | title=かごっまの話 | language=Japanese |trans-title=Overview of the Kagomma dialect | publisher=さつま　グローバルネット (Satsuma Global Net) | year=2005 | accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; to indicate desire or express a wish to do something.  For example,  食ぉごたっ ''kwo-gotaʔ'' means "want to eat",&lt;ref name="RTYaux" /&gt; あすぼごたっ ''asubo-gotaʔ'' means "want to play", and 投ぐごあっ ''nagu-goaʔ''&lt;ref name="SGN" /&gt; (from the ''shimo nidan'' verb 投ぐる ''naguru'') means "want to give up".  This auxiliary verb can also be used with more stative verbs to indicate the notion of "it seems to be", "it looks", or "it looks like it is going to".  For instance, 雨が降ろごたっ ''ame ga furo-gotaʔ'' effectively means "it looks like it will rain".&lt;ref name="RTYaux" /&gt;

The causative form differs from standard Japanese in that it becomes ''-(was)asuru'' rather than ''-(was)aseru''.  This form can be achieved by replacing the final ''-u'' in the underlying plain form with ''-asuru'' or,  for verbs stemming in just ''-u'', ''-wasasuru''.  These are then reduced to ''-asuʔ'' and ''-wasasuʔ'' respectively following regular sound changes, though the latter ending may further reduce to ''-wassuʔ'' in speech, resulting in 食ゎっすっ ''kwassuʔ'' instead of 食ゎさすっ ''kwasasuʔ'' "to make (someone) eat". The difference observed between the dialectal form  ''-(as)asuru'' and the standard form ''-(as)aseru'' is also representative of the fact that this form conjugates like other ''shimo nidan'' or "lower bigrade" verbs.  Consequently, it is notably irregular in comparison to other ''-ru'' verbs in the ''i form'' and imperative form where it becomes ''-sase'', as well as the volitional form where it becomes ''-sasu''.  It is also irregular in the negative form, where it becomes ''-sasen''.&lt;ref name="SGN" /&gt;

'''Kako''' (also '''Mkako''' or '''Mkaka''') is a [[Bantu language]] spoken mainly in [[Cameroon]], with some speakers in the [[Central African Republic]] and the [[Republic of the Congo]]. The main population centres of Kako speakers are [[Batouri]] and [[Ndélélé]] in the [[East Region (Cameroon)|East Region]] of Cameroon.

Once grouped with the [[Gbaya languages|Gbaya]] dialect cluster and often still referred to as part of an undefined "Gbaya-Kaka" group, Kako is now grouped in the Bantu subgroup of the [[Niger–Congo language|Niger–Congo language family]].

==Dialects==
Kako can be divided in three main closely related dialects stretching from eastern dialect (Bεra, Bèra) near the Bertoua-Doumé area to a middle dialect (Mgbwako, Mgbako) in near the Batouri area to a western dialect (Mbondjóo, Bo-Ndjo, Kou) near the Cameroon-Central African Republic border area. The difference is the greatest between the eastern Bεra dialect and the western Mbondjóo, with the Mgbwako dialect forming a middle ground.

All three remain [[mutually intelligible]]. The Bεra and Mbondjóo dialects have 85.5% of their words in common, of which 26.4% are identical and 59.1% are cognates.&lt;ref name="kako"&gt;{{cite conference |first=Philip |last=Noss |title=An Ethnolinguistic Approach to the History of East Central Cameroon (Gbaya-Kaka Zones |date=18 May 1983 |location=Nigeria }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other known variants of Kako language are Bo-Rong, Lossou, Ngwendjè and Mbéssembo.

==History==
Linguistic and documentary evidence support [[oral traditions]] claiming that the people speaking Kako, and thus the language, have migrated to their present positions from further east.&lt;ref name="kako" /&gt; Current evidence can trace the language back to the area just east of the current Cameroon-Central African Republic border, around the towns of [[Berberati]] and Gaza in the mid 19th century. Further extrapolation into history is speculative, though being a Bantu language it is likely to have followed the [[Bantu migrations]] out of their ancestral homeland in the southern Cameroon-Nigeria borderlands.

For their known history, the Kako language has been in close contact with various dialects of the Gbaya language. This has resulted in numerous borrowings of words. In fact, the Bεra dialect of Kako and the Yaáyuwee dialect of Kako share nearly 1% of their words, with a further 10-15% being cognates.&lt;ref name="kako" /&gt;

'''Knife''' is the cutting die for [[envelope]] or [[Wrapper (philately)|wrapper]] blanks.  It is called a ''knife'' rather than a ''die'' because the latter is an object that makes an [[Paper embossing|embossed]] printed impression of the [[Postage stamp|stamp]] or [[indicium]] on the envelope.&lt;ref name=Thorp&gt;''Thorp-Bartels Catalogue of United States Stamped Envelopes'', Century Edition, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, a knife would normally be made of forged steel.  It was placed on a stack of paper with the sharp edge against the paper.  The press head forced the cutting edge all the way through the stack of paper.  The cut blanks were removed from the knife and the process repeated.  Not only could it cut out the odd shape of an envelope, but a knife could be used to cut out shapes of airmail stickers or gummed labels in the shape of stars or circles.  The variety of shapes a knife could cut would be infinite.

In [[philately]], [[Prescott Holden Thorp|Thorp]] knife numbers were, and still are, used to indicate the height, width, shapes, and folds of envelopes generally numbered in the order of their discovery by collectors.&lt;ref name=Thorp&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United Postal Stationery Society]] [http://www.upss.org (UPSS)] now has its own numbering system for envelope knives which is seeing more current use.&lt;ref&gt;Mintz, Allen, Ed.; ''Catalog of the 19th Century Stamped Envelopes, Wrappers, Cut Squares and Full Corners of the United States''; UPSS, 2001. {{oclc|50290906}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Undersander&gt;Undersander, Dan, Ed.; ''Catalog of the 20th and 21st Century Stamped Envelopes and Wrappers of the United States'', Third Edition, UPSS, 2011. {{ISBN|978-0-9800112-8-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lisan al-Gharbi''' (Arabic for "Western dialect") is the name given to an extinct [[Berber languages|dialect of Berber]] that was spoken over much of the Atlantic plains of [[Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Frankel, [https://books.google.fr/books?id=CDYsAQAAIAAJ History in Dispute: The Middle East since 1945. First series] (St. James Press, 2003), p.206&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="awal"&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=IXUPAQAAMAAJ Awal, Numéros 19 à 21] (Maison des sciences de l'homme, 1999), p.157&lt;/ref&gt; It was closely related to [[Tashelhit]].&lt;ref name="awal" /&gt;

The Lisan al-Gharbi was the official language of the [[Barghawata|Barghawata Confederacy]], and the idiom used in [[Salih ibn Tarif]]'s "indigenous Qur'an".

The [[Barghawata]]'s defeat by [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]] in the 11th century, the settlement of several Arab and Zenata tribes in the area by [[Almohads]] and [[Marinids]], the Portuguese invasion in the 15th century, several famines and the resulting displacement of populations made the Masmouda minoritary while Arabic became the dominant language; that led to the [[Arabization]] of the remaining Masmouda population and the extinction of the Lisan al-Gharbi.

Nowadays, several tribes and sub-tribes of [[Masmouda]] descent are still found among the [[Doukkala]], the [[Chaouia (Morocco)|Chaouia]], the [[Zaers]] and the [[Regraga]]. However, they are all Arabophone; the only Berber-speaking Masmouda ethnic group to be found in the Atlantic plains is the [[Haha (tribe)|Hahha]] confederacy, but no direct filiation link had been established between their dialect (belonging to [[Tashelhit]]) and the Lisan al-Gharbi.

==Biography==
Niazi was born on 9 April 1928, in Khanpur, one of the Pathan villages in [[Hoshiarpur]] [[Punjab]], [[British India]]. He was initially educated at Khanpur. After the [[partition of India]] in 1947, he migrated and settled in [[Sahiwal]], where he passed his [[matriculation]] examination. He earned an intermediate degree from Sadiq Egerton College, [[Bahawalpur]] and a B.A. degree from [[Dayal Singh College, Lahore]], [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1098878 |publisher=dawn.com newspaper |title=A fitting tribute to Munir Niazi |date=2014-04-10 |accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Munir Niazi launched a weekly, ''Seven Colours'', from Sahiwal in 1949. Some of his poetry was used in films and these film songs became extremely popular super-hit songs among the [[Pakistani]] public which established him as the foremost movie songwriter of [[Pakistan]]. For example, the film song in film Shaheed (1962), ''Uss Bewafa Ka Shehar Hai Aur Hum Hain Dosto'' and many others.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375056/soundtrack?ref_=tt_trv_snd, Munir Niazi hit film song on IMDb website, Retrieved 17 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nakos''' is another word for the [[Semantron]], a wood and metal gong-like instrument used to call Christian worshipers to prayer in Syria, Jerusalem and other parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]] where Muslim authorities did not allow the use of church bells.

A masculine name meaning "sage" or "wisdom". The origin of this name is [[Arapaho]], which is a tribe of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] historically living on the eastern plains of [[Colorado]] and [[Wyoming]]. Nakos can also mean "herb" or "[[sagebrush]]" - a shrubby aromatic North American plant of the daisy family.

"Nakos" is also a common Greek last name. Also pronounced as Nakou with the "s" being silent. Sometimes shortened in the United States from the Greek last name "Nakopolous". Originally thought to have come from the Epirus region of Greece but it's hard to pinpoint the origins.

He was born in the small village of [[Ajah (Nigeria)|Ajah]], now a bustling [[marketplace]]. He has campaigned against the development and exploitation of the surrounding areas for purely commercial purposes. In a [[television]] [[interview]] in 2001 he spoke about the loss of traditional [[land rights]] and values.&lt;ref name = "Evening"&gt;Evening with Mo! 28 November 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Known in Lagos as the Bushman Poet, he is known for his native [[rhythm]]s and complex [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] [[rhyme]]s. His main themes cover traditional practices. He was criticised by many politicians in the 1980s for being against [[modernisation]].&lt;ref name = "The News"&gt;''The News'', Lagos nigeria March/April 1984. [http://thenewsng.com/].&lt;/ref&gt;

He is currently the Nigerian [[Poet Laureate]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2099">A '''pritchel''' is a type of [[punch (engineering)|punch]] used in [[forging]], particularly in making [[nail (fastener)|nail]] holes in [[horseshoe]]s.  The horseshoe is heated and a hole is punched through 90 percent of the steel with a forepunch or drift punch. The pointed end of the tool should be kept sharp and so that the burr is cut out smoothly. The punched hole is lined up over the pritchel hole and the pritchel is driven into the hole, knocking out the remaining metal at the bottom of the punched hole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sims|first=Lorelei|title=The backyard blacksmith:Traditional Techniques for the modern smith|year=2006|publisher=Quarry Books|location=Massachusetts|isbn=1-59253-251-9|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The temperature of the pritchel should be always below the ''red-hot'' stage as the tool itself will bend and lose the temper. When over-heated it is advised to cool it in water intermediately.&lt;ref name ='Wiseman'/&gt;

==Back pritcheling==
The pritchel should normally be driven from the bottom of the shoe, similarly as the nail is driven. ''Back pritcheling''&lt;ref name='Wiseman'&gt;{{cite book|last=Wiseman|first=Robert F|title=The complete horse shoeing guide|year=1995|publisher=The University of Oklahoma Press,Norman, Publishing division of the University|location=USA|isbn=0-8061-2719-8|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the process of driving it from the opposite side —the hoof side— leaving burrs and resulting in the weakening and cutting the nails.

==Pritchel hole==
A '''pritchel hole''' is a round hole in an [[anvil]]. Its primary purpose is to provide clearance for punching tools, but it can also be used to hold [[tool]]s that have round shanks.   Pritchel tools are tools such as punches whose functions do not require them to be held at a particular orientation. A square hole in an anvil is called a [[Hardy hole]], not to be confused with
tapered square holes seen in tinsmith's equipment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3256">'''Rebecca bat Meir Tiktiner''' (died circa 1550), was a [[Yiddish]] writer, whose works include a treatise on [[Jewish ethics]] in the style of [[musar literature]] as well as a poem about [[Simchat Torah]].  

==Life==
She or her father probably resided in the northeast Poland town of [[Tykocin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://dbs.bh.org.il/luminary/tiktiner-rebecca Rebecca Tiktiner - The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot] and EJ&lt;/ref&gt; According to the records of the [[Old New Synagogue|Altneushul]], she was married to someone with rabbinic training (''ha-rav rabbi'').&lt;ref&gt;EJ&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethical treatise, "Meneket Rivkah" (Prague, 1609. Cracow, 1618), is 36 folios long and organized by seven gates. The author focuses on the duties of a housewife in various relationships (e.g., to husband or guest) as well as a general ethical approach, dealing with [[niddah]], health social practices (von Rohde, 2007b). The treatise includes stories from the [[Talmud]] and [[midrash]]ic literature. Tiktiner differentiates between the wisdom of the body and of the soul (''guf'' and ''nefesh''). This practical guidelines "paint a vivid picture of Jewish women's daily lives in the early modern period." Von Rohde claims that this is "probably the first substantive published book in Yiddish written by a Jewish women (sic)" (von Rohde 2007b).

Rebecca also wrote a rhymed Yiddish hymn for the holiday of [[Simḥat Torah]], entitled Eyn Simkhas Touro Lid, which describes an eschatological, festive banquet for men and women alike. The poem, which survives in two separate undated 17th century printings, consists of 40 rhyming couplets (with acrostic), in which each verse is followed by the refrain hallelujah.

She died in circa 1550 and was buried in [[Prague]]; she died circa 1550.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=216&amp;letter=T Jewish Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''SYZ conjecture''' is an attempt to understand the [[Mirror symmetry (string theory)|mirror symmetry]] conjecture, an issue in theoretical physics and mathematics. The original conjecture was proposed in a paper by [[Andrew Strominger|Strominger]], [[Shing-Tung Yau|Yau]], and [[Eric Zaslow|Zaslow]], entitled "Mirror Symmetry is ''T''-duality".&lt;ref name="SYZ"&gt;{{Citation |last=Strominger |first=Andrew |last2=Yau |first2=Shing-Tung |last3=Zaslow |first3=Eric |year=1996 |title=Mirror symmetry is ''T''-duality |journal=Nuclear Physics B |volume=479 |issue=1–2 |pages=243–259 |doi=10.1016/0550-3213(96)00434-8 |arxiv = hep-th/9606040 |bibcode = 1996NuPhB.479..243S }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the [[homological mirror symmetry| homological mirror symmetry conjecture]], it is one of the most explored tools applied to understand mirror symmetry in mathematical terms. While the homological mirror symmetry is based on [[homological algebra]], the SYZ conjecture is a geometrical realization of mirror symmetry.

== Formulation ==
In [[string theory]], mirror symmetry relates [[type IIA]] and [[type IIB]] theories. It predicts that the effective field theory of type IIA and type IIB should be the same if the two theories are compactified on mirror pair manifolds.

The SYZ conjecture uses this fact to realize mirror symmetry. It starts from considering [[BPS state]]s of type IIA theories compactified on ''X'', especially [[0-brane]]s that have [[moduli space]] ''X''. It is known that all of the BPS states of type IIB theories compactified on ''Y'' are [[3-brane]]s. Therefore, mirror symmetry will map 0-branes of type IIA theories into a subset of 3-branes of type IIB theories.

By considering [[supersymmetric]] conditions, it has been shown that these 3-branes should be [[special Lagrangian submanifold]]s.&lt;ref name="BBS"&gt;{{Citation |last=Becker |first=Katrin |last2=Becker |first2=Melanie |last3=Strominger |first3=Andrew |year=1995 |title=Fivebranes, membranes and non-perturbative string theory |journal=Nuclear Physics B |volume=456 |issue=1–2 |pages=130–152 |doi=10.1016/0550-3213(95)00487-1 |arxiv = hep-th/9507158 |bibcode = 1995NuPhB.456..130B }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HL"&gt;{{Citation |last=Harvey |first=Reese |last2=Lawson |first2=H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3035">A '''stage reading''' is a form of [[theatre]] without [[Theatrical scenery|sets]] or [[Stage clothes|full costumes]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark W. Travis, ''The Director's Journey'' (Michael Wiese Productions, 1997), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; The actors, who read from scripts, may be seated, stand in fixed positions, or incorporate minimal [[Blocking (stage)|stage movement]].

A stage reading of a new play in development is an intermediate phase between a cold reading, with the cast usually sitting around a table, and a full production. A narrator may read stage directions aloud. The purpose is to gauge the effectiveness of the dialogue, pacing and flow, and other dramatic elements that the playwright or director may wish to adjust. Audience feedback contributes to the process.&lt;ref&gt;Chuck Sambuchino, ''2009 Screenwriter's and Playwright's Market'' (Writer's Digest Books, 2008), n.p.; Terry McCabe, ''Mis-Directing the Play: An Argument against Contemporary Theatre'' (I.R. Dee, 2001), p. 94; Laura Annawyn Shamas, ''Playwriting for Theater, Film, and Television'' (Betterway Publications, 1991), p. 110; Alex Epstein, ''Crafty Screenwriting: Writing Movies That Get Made'' (Henry Holt, 2002), p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; In play-development workshopping, the stage reading is one of the forms of workshop, along with the rehearsed reading, the exploratory workshop, and the full workshop production.&lt;ref&gt;David Kahn and Donna Breed, ''Scriptwork: A Director's Approach to New Play Development'' (Southern Illinois University, 1995), p.79.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an inexpensive way to get a new play in front of an audience.&lt;ref&gt;Lenore DeKoven, ''Changing Direction: A Practical Approach to Directing Actors in Film and Theatre'' (Elsevier, 2006), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stage readings that include members of [[Actors' Equity Association|Actors' Equity]] in the cast are governed by that union's [http://www.actorsequity.org/docs/codes/Stage_Reading_Materials.pdf Stage Reading Guidelines].

==Screenplays==
{{Main|Screenplay}}
A screenplay in development that relies to a significant degree on dialogue rather than action may sometimes be given a stage reading, as a way to attract potential investors or to rehearse. As a form of public performance, the stage reading of a film script is like performing a [[radio play]] before a live audience, with emphasis on the use of imagination and on voice acting, which might require theatre actors and [[Voice acting|voice-over artists]].&lt;ref&gt;Cathy Haase, ''Acting for Film'' (Allworth Press, 2003), pp. 142–145; Epstein, ''Crafty Screenwriting'', p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Reader's theatre==
{{Main|Reader's theatre}}
Reader's theatre is the stage reading of a fully developed or classic play, when the reading is itself the performance.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen McIntyre, Nancy Hulan, and Vicky Layne, ''Reading Instruction for Diverse Classrooms'' (Guilford Press, 2011), p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7263">A '''storage organ''' is a part of a [[plant]] specifically modified for storage of energy 
(generally in the form of [[carbohydrate]]s) or [[water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/storage-organ|title=the definition of storage organ|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storage organs often grow underground, where they are better protected from attack by [[herbivore]]s. Plants that have an underground storage organ are called '''geophytes''' in the [[Raunkiær plant life-form|Raunkiær plant life-form classification system]].&lt;ref&gt;The underground storage organ itself is sometimes called a geophyte, but this is not the original usage of the term in the [[Raunkiær plant life-form|Raunkiær plant life-form classification]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Raunkiaer_1934&gt;{{Citation |last=Raunkiær |first=Christen |year=1934 |title=The life forms of plants and statistical plant geography |publication-place=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |oclc=4300750 |others=trans. Gilbert-Carter, H.; Fausbøll, A. &amp; Tansley, A.G. }}; reprinted (1977) in ''History of ecology'' series, New York: Arno Press, {{ISBN|978-0-405-10418-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storage organs often, but not always, act as [[perennating organ]]s which enable plants to survive adverse conditions (such as cold, excessive heat, lack of light or drought).

== Relationship to perennating organ ==
Storage organs may act as [[perennating organ]]s ('perennating' as in [[Perennial plant|perennial]], meaning "through the year", used in the sense of continuing beyond the year and in due course lasting for multiple years). These are used by plants to survive adverse periods in the plant's life-cycle (e.g. caused by cold, excessive heat, lack of light or drought). During these periods, parts of the plant die and then when conditions become favourable again, re-growth occurs from buds in the perennating organs. For example, geophytes growing in woodland under deciduous trees (e.g. [[Hyacinthoides non-scripta|bluebells]], [[trilliums]]) die back to underground storage organs during summer when tree leaf cover restricts light and water is less available.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

However, perennating organs need not be storage organs. After losing their leaves, deciduous trees grow them again from 'resting buds', which are the perennating organs of phanerophytes in the [[Raunkiær plant life-form|Raunkiær classification]], but which do not specifically act as storage organs. Equally, storage organs need not be perennating organs. Many [[succulent plant|succulents]] have leaves adapted for water storage, which they retain in adverse conditions.

==Underground storage organ==

In common parlance, underground storage organs may be generically called roots, [[tuber]]s, or bulbs, but to the [[botanist]] there is more specific technical [[nomenclature]]:
[[Image:Gingembre.jpg|thumb|right|A harvested [[ginger]] rhizome]]
* True [[root]]s:
** [[Tuberous root]] or root tuber — e.g. ''[[Dahlia]]''&lt;ref&gt;Examples mainly taken from {{Citation |last=Rix |first=M. |year=1983 |title=Growing bulbs |publication-place=Beckenham, Kent |publisher=Croom Helm |isbn=978-0-7099-2248-3 }}, pp. 5-12&lt;/ref&gt;
** Storage [[taproot]] — e.g. [[carrot]]
* Modified [[plant stem|stem]]s:
** [[Corm]] — e.g. ''[[Crocus]]''
**  [[Stem tuber]] — e.g. ''[[Zantedeschia]]'' (arum lily), [[potato]]
** [[Rhizome]] — e.g. ''[[Iris pseudacorus]]'' (yellow flag iris)
** [[Pseudobulb]] — e.g. ''[[Pleione (plant)|Pleione]]'' (windowsill orchid)
** [[Caudex]] — e.g. ''[[Adenium]]'' (desert-rose)
* Others:
** Storage [[hypocotyl]] (the stem of a seedling) — sometimes called a [[tuber]], as in ''[[Cyclamen]]''
** [[Bulb]] (a short stem that produces fleshy scale leaves or modified leaf bases) — e.g. ''[[Lilium]]'', ''[[Narcissus (plant)|Narcissus]]'', [[onion]]

Some of the above, particularly pseudobulbs and caudices, may occur wholly or partially above ground. Intermediates and combinations of the above are also found, making classification difficult. As an example of an intermediate, the tuber of ''Cyclamen'' arises from the stem of the seedling, which forms the junction of the roots and stem of the mature plant. In some species (e.g. ''[[Cyclamen coum]]'') roots come from the bottom of the tuber, suggesting that it is a stem tuber; in others (e.g. ''[[Cyclamen hederifolium]]'') roots come largely from the top of the tuber, suggesting that it is a root tuber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Grey-Wilson |first=C. |year=1988 |title=The Genus Cyclamen |publication-place=Bromley, UK |publisher=[[Christopher Helm]] |isbn=978-0-7470-1221-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of a combination, juno irises have both bulbs and storage roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Köhlein |first=Fritz |year=1987 |title=Iris |publication-place=London |publisher=Christopher Helm |isbn=978-0-7470-1803-2 |others=translated by M.C. Peters from German original published in 1981  }}, pp. 257ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Underground storage organs used for food may be generically called [[root vegetable]]s, although this phrase should not be taken to imply that the class only includes true roots.

== Other storage organs ==
[[File:Cookie Tree Jade.JPG|thumb|''[[Crassula arborescens]]'', a leaf succulent]]

[[Succulent]]s are plants which are adapted to withstand periods of drought by their ability to store moisture in specialized storage organs.&lt;ref&gt;Information in this section taken from {{Citation |last=Innes |first=Clive |last2=Wall |first2=Bill |year=1995 |title=Cacti, Succulents and Bromeliads |publication-place=London |publisher=Cassell Educational (for Royal Horticultural Society) |isbn=978-0-304-32076-9 |lastauthoramp=yes }}, pp. 75–6&lt;/ref&gt;

* Leaf succulents store water in their leaves, which are thus thickened, fleshy and typically covered with a waxy coating or fine hairs to reduce evaporation. They may also contain mucilagenous compounds. Some leaf succulents have leaves which are distributed along the stem in a similar fashion to non-succulent species (e.g. ''[[Crassula]]'', ''[[Kalanchoe]]''); their stems may also be succulent. In others, the leaves are more compact, forming a rosette (e.g. ''[[Echeveria]]'', ''[[Aloe]]''). Pebble-plants or living stones (e.g. ''[[Lithops]]'', ''[[Conophytum]]'') have reduced their leaves to just two, forming a fleshy body, only the top of which may be visible above ground.

[[File:Ferocactus pilosus1.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Ferocactus|Ferocactus pilosus]]'' (Mexican lime cactus), a stem succulent]]
* [[Stem succulent]]s are generally either leafless or have leaves which can be quickly shed in the event of drought. Photosynthesis is then taken over by the stems. As with leaf succulents, stems may be covered with a waxy coating or fine hairs to reduce evaporation. The ribbed bodies of [[cacti]] may be an adaption to allow shrinkage and expansion with the amount of water stored. Plants of the same general form as cacti are found in other families (e.g. ''[[Euphorbia canariensis]]'' (family [[Euphorbiaceae]]), ''[[Stapelia]]'' (family [[Apocynaceae]])).

'''Symbolic equation''' is the term used in [[Melanie Klein|Kleinian]] psychoanalysis for states of thinking which equate current objects with those of the past, rather than finding a ''resemblance'' between the two sets.

==Origins==
[[Hanna Segal]] developed the concept of the symbolic equation in the 1950s, during her examination of concrete thinking in the schizophrenic.&lt;ref&gt;J-M Quinodoz, ''Listening to Hanna Segal'' (2007) p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Its roots however have been traced back as far as Freud's ''[[Studies on Hysteria]]'' of 1895, where he noted how a phrase like a 'stab in the heart' could be concretised in terms of the original physical sensations behind it, so that "we find a symbolic version in concrete images and sensations of more artificial turns of speech".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J-M Quinodoz, ''Listening to Hanna Segal'' (2007) p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Symbolic equations have been connected to the [[Splitting (psychology)|splitting]] of the [[Paranoid-schizoid and depressive positions|paranoid-schizoid position]];&lt;ref&gt;J Segal, ''Melanie Klein'' (London 2001) p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; alternatively they can be seen as the result of a failure to make distinctions between self and others, or between real and [[Idealization|idealised]] objects.&lt;ref&gt;R Anderson ed., ''Clinical Lectures on Klein and Bion'' (London 1992) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
*[[Psychological trauma]] can lead to a collapse of the boundaries between inner and outer worlds, so that anything reminiscent of the trauma becomes by symbolic equation the trauma itself.&lt;ref&gt;F Busch ed., ''Mentalization'' (2011) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;
*Anxiety in nursing is correlated with the varying ability to relate symbolically to patients: where the latter are seen as symbolising the nurse's own damaged inner objects, care can be provided with manageable anxiety, but where patients are symbolically ''equated'' with parts of the self, anxiety spikes, leading either to despair or to [[Grandiosity|grandiose]] attempts at healing.&lt;ref&gt;M Rustin, ''Social Defences Against Anxiety'' (2014) p. 127-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternate usages==
*In classical psychoanalysis, symbolic equation is used merely to specify the object to which a symbol relates, as when [[Otto Fenichel]] write of "the symbolic equation money = feces".&lt;ref&gt;O Fenicjel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;
*For [[Jacques Lacan]]'s linguistically based [[Symbolic order]], a symbolic equation would mark the presence of (unarticulated) meaning, prior to its entrance into a linguistic code.&lt;ref&gt;M Charles, ''Working with Trauma'' (2011) p. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bible League Canada''', founded in 1948, is a charitable organization whose mission is to place [[Bible]]s into the hands of men, women and young people who are hungry for the Living Word of God. They do this through four strategic ministry programs including church planter training, adult Bible-based [[literacy]] programs, children's ministries, and supporting Christians persecuted for their faith. The organization seeks to bring the Christian message of [[Jesus Christ]] to people around the world because they believe that when people come into a relationship with Jesus through the Bible, lives are transformed from the inside out. The organization’s total revenue for fiscal year 2011 was $9.88 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bibleleague.ca/news/annual-report&lt;/ref&gt; Of this amount, 56.59% ($5.6 million) is provided by Bibles for Missions Thrift Stores, Canada. Bible League Canada is also a part of the [[Forum of Bible Agencies International]].

== History ==
In 1948, The Bible League of Canada began as the Canadian affiliate of the American Home Bible League. Throughout the 1950s, the affiliate organization distributed Bibles door-to-door through local churches and various outreach ministries. The organization changed in 1959 when Jo Vander Boom was appointed to manage the organization's activities. In 1960, Jo's husband, John Vander Boom, was appointed as the first Canadian director and officially changed the name of the organization to the Canadian Home Bible League in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bibleleague.ca/about-us/history{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1971, the organization was incorporated and became a legal entity separate from the American Home Bible League. The same year, an office in Weston, Ontario became the first purchased property, and an appeal for [[Cuba]] became the organization's first international project.

Vander Boom formed a group of prominent [[evangelical]] church leaders who lent their endorsements to the ministry of the Canadian Home Bible League. This action started the attainment of interdenominational support which continues to influence Bible League Canada today.

On December 11, 1984, the name of the organization was changed to the World Home Bible League of Canada, reflecting the organization's increasing commitment to international ministry.   The present name, The Bible League of Canada, became official in 1992. In 1994, offices were moved to the present location in Burlington, Ontario. In 2007, the organization began operating its own international ministries apart from the U.S. Bible League operations.

== Funding ==
The Bible League of Canada’s revenue comes from individual donors, churches, corporations, foundations, and Bibles for Missions Thrift Stores. In 2009, 90% of funds raised were sent to their ministry programs around the world, 4.5% of its funding was spent on administration and 4.5% was spent on fund raising.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bibleleague.ca/news/annual-report&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
The Bible League of Canada provides Bibles and community training worldwide by partnering with churches and mission organizations in India, South East Asia, Eurasia, South America and Canada.  The focus of the ministry involves four strategic ministry programs:  
* Church Planter Training
* Adult Bible-based Literacy
* Children’s Ministry
* Support of the Persecuted Church

==About==
While other organizations come with water, food and education… Bible League Canada comes with the Living Word of God. When individuals come into a relationship with Jesus through His Words, lives are transformed from the inside out. This transformation impacts families and communities. The individual and community is inspired to become self-sustaining and then water, food and education are generated by the community itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibleleague.ca/about-us about-us] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210041915/http://www.bibleleague.ca/about-us |date=2012-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hindu philosophy}}
''[[Adi Shankaracharya]]'', ''[[Ramanujacharya]]'' and ''[[Madhvacharya]]'' are considered to be the pillars of Vedantic tradition of spiritual India.

'''Shankaracharya''' proposed or rather popularized Advaitha Vedanta. Advaitha system of Vedanta was first proposed by Gaudapada who was the Guru of Shankaracharya's Guru Govinda Bhagavatpada. Advaitha means non-dual.

'''Ramanujacharya''' had a totally different experience than Shankaracharya. During the time of Ramanuja, followers of Advaitha tradition in Tamil Nadu had distorted the teachings of Shankaracharya so much that Ramanuja started correcting them.

'''Madhvacharya''''s work is the most interesting of the three. He took a daring step of explaining Prasthanatraya in the light of Dvaitha philosophy that is philosophically against [[Advaitha]] and Vishishtadvaitha.

'''VNI Software Company''' is the [[Westminster, California]]&amp;ndash;based, family-owned developer of various education, entertainment, office, and utility [[computer software|software]] packages.

==History==
VNI was founded in 1987 by [[Hồ Thành Việt]] to develop software that eases [[Vietnamese language]] use on computers. Among their products were the VNI Encoding and VNI [[input method editor|Input Method]].

===VNI vs. Microsoft===
{{Unreferenced|section|date=April 2016}}

In the 1990s, [[Microsoft]] recognized the potential of VNI's products and incorporated VNI Input Method into [[Windows 95]] Vietnamese Edition and [[MSDN]], in use worldwide.

Upon Microsoft's unauthorized use of these technologies, VNI took Microsoft to court over the matter. Microsoft settled the case out of court, withdrew the input method from their entire product line, and developed their own input method. It has, although virtually unknown, appeared in every [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] release since [[Windows 98]].

===Unicode===
Despite the growing popularity of [[Unicode]] in computing, the [[VNI Character Set|VNI Encoding]] (see [[#VNI Encoding|below]]) is still in wide use by Vietnamese speakers both in [[Vietnam]] and abroad. All professional printing facilities in the [[Little Saigon#Orange County|Little Saigon]] neighborhood of [[Orange County, California]] continue to use the VNI Encoding when processing Vietnamese text. For this reason, [[print job]]s submitted using the VNI Character Set are compatible with local printers.

==VNI products==
VNI invented, popularized, and commercialized an input method and an encoding, the [[VNI Character Set]], to assist computer users entering Vietnamese on their computers. The user can type using only [[ASCII]] characters found on standard computer [[keyboard layout]]s. Because the [[Vietnamese alphabet]] uses a complex system of [[diacritical mark]]s, the keyboard needs 133 alphanumeric keys and a [[Shift key]] to cover all possible characters.

===VNI Input Method===
Originally, VNI's input method utilized [[function key]]s (F1, F2, ...) to enter the tone marks, which later turned out to be problematic, as the operating system used those keys for other purposes. VNI then turned to the numerical keys along the top of the keyboard (as opposed to the [[numpad]]) for entering tone marks. This arrangement survives today, but users also have the option of customizing the keys used for tone marks.

[[File:Maitran.us-nutdau.png|frame|center|''Bảng dấu VNI'': a [[toolbar]] allowing one-click access to Vietnamese diacritical marks]]

With VNI Tan Ky mode on, the user can type in diacritical marks anywhere within a word, and the marks will appear at their proper locations. For example, the word ''[[wikt:trường|trường]]'', which means "school", can be typed in the following ways:
*&lt;tt&gt;72truong&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;trường&lt;/tt&gt;
*&lt;tt&gt;t72ruong&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;trường&lt;/tt&gt;
*&lt;tt&gt;tr72uong&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;trường&lt;/tt&gt;
*&lt;tt&gt;tru7o72ng&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;trường&lt;/tt&gt;
*&lt;tt&gt;truo72ng&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;trường&lt;/tt&gt;
*&lt;tt&gt;truo7ng2&lt;/tt&gt; → &lt;tt&gt;trường&lt;/tt&gt;

===VNI Tan Ky===
With the release of VNI Tan Ky 4 in the 1990s, VNI freed users from having to remember where to correctly insert tone marks within a word, because, as long as the user enters all the required characters and tone marks, the software will group them correctly. This feature is especially useful for newcomers to the language.

===VNI Auto Accent===
VNI Auto Accent is the company's most recent software release (2006), with the purpose of alleviating [[repetitive strain injury]] (RSI) caused by prolonged use of [[computer keyboard]]s. Auto Accent helps reduce the number of keystrokes needed to type each word by automatically adding diacritical marks for the user. The user must still enter every base letter in the word.

===VNI Encoding===
The [[VNI Character Set|VNI Encoding]] uses two characters to represent one [[Vietnamese alphabet#Vowels|Vietnamese vowel]] character, therefore removing the need for control characters to represent one Vietnamese character, a problematic system found in TCVN ([[VSCII]]), or using two different [[typeface|font]]s such as in [[VPSKeys]], one containing lowercase characters and the other uppercase characters.

This solution is more [[porting|portable]] between different versions of Windows and between different [[platform (computing)|platform]]s. However, due to the presence of multiple characters in a file to represent one written character increases the file size. The increased file size can usually be accounted for by [[data compression|compress]]ing the data into a file format such as [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]].

===VIQR and VNI-Internet Mail===
The use of [[Vietnamese Quoted-Readable]] (VIQR), a convention for writing in Vietnamese using ASCII characters, began during the [[Vietnam War]], when [[typewriter]]s were the main tool for [[word processing]]. Because the [[Military of the United States|U.S. military]] required a way to represent Vietnamese scripts accurately on official documents, VIQR was invented for the military. Due to its longstanding use, VIQR was a natural choice for computer word processing, prior to the appearance of VNI, [[VPSKeys]], [[VISCII]], and Unicode. It is still widely used for information exchange on computers, but is not desirable for design and layout, due to its cryptic appearance.

VNI was the only well-known company to fully recognize the potential of VIQR.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} VIQR's main issue, however, was the difficulty of reading VIQR text, especially for inexperienced computer users. VNI created and released a free font called ''VNI-Internet Mail''. VNI-Internet Mail utilized the VIQR encoding and VNI's two-character technique to give VIQR text a more natural appearance.

'''Vaikathu Paramesvara Sivadvija''', popularly known as '''Vaikath Pachu Moothathu''', was a scholar of the [[princely state]] of [[Travancore]]. A scholar of [[Ayurveda]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Malayalam]] and history, he wrote the first autobiography in Malayalam and established the first institution for learning the traditional Indian ayurvedic medicine, which developed to become Government Ayurveda College, [[Thiruvananthapuram]].

==Birth and early life==
Moothathu was born on 25 Edavam 989 Kolla era (1814 AD) in [[Vaikom]], Travancore state and was adopted by a Moothathu family called [[Vattapalli Matom]] at [[Suchindrum]] to perform temple rites and rituals. The family lacked a male child who could do those duties. The family of Vattapalli Matom is the Tantri of the Suchindrum [[Thanumalayan temple]] from where one male member (usually the eldest) must perform the rites and rituals of the temple.

==Learning==
Moothathu learned Ayurveda, a system of traditional medicine native to India. He was influenced by Vahata's ([[Vagbhata]]) Astangahridaya and started learning it. He learned Astangahrdaya in the Kollam Era 1018 (Kanni 2) and completed on the 29th of Thulam 1018 (1843 AD). He wrote '''Sri Rama Charitram Mahakavyam''' (1037 KOLLAM ERA), '''Thiruvitamcore Charitram''' (narrating the legends and facts up to the 1036 Kollam Era (1861 AD) i.e. up to the period of '''[[Maharaja]] [[Ayilyam Thirunal]]''').'''Hradyapriya'''(1040 Kollam Era) 1865 AD and '''Sukhasadhakam'''(1057 Kollam Era) 1882 AD are two important works by Sri Pachu [[Moothathu]] on [[Ayurveda]] and can be considered as a pragmatic commentary of Vahata's Astangahridaya. He insisted in transferring the knowledge of Ayurveda to ordinary people and his book ''Sukhasadhagam'' is an attempt in this direction.

He was the Kottaram Vaidyan (official ayurvedic physician) of Travancore and was awarded with the '''Veera Sringala''' by the maharaja, Ayilyam Thirunal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3555">[[Image:Vu Trong Phung.jpg|200px|thumb|Vũ Trọng Phụng]]
'''Vũ Trọng Phụng''' ([[Hanoi]], 20 October 1912 - Hanoi, 13 October 1939) was a popular [[Vietnam]]ese author and journalist, who is considered to be one of the most influential figures of 20th century [[Vietnamese literature]]. Today, several of his works are taught in Vietnamese schools.

Vũ Trọng Phụng's ancestral village was Hảo village, [[Mỹ Hào District]], [[Hưng Yên Province]], yet he was born, grew up, and died in [[Hanoi]]. The fact that his father died of [[tuberculosis]] when he was only 7 months old resulted in Vũ Trụng Phụng's being brought up mainly by his mother. After finishing primary school, sixteen-year-old Vũ Trọng Phụng was forced to stop schooling and earn his own living.
In 1939, he died from tuberculosis at the age of twenty-six (twenty-seven by the Vietnamese system of counting age), a week before his twenty-seventh birthday.

Vũ Trọng Phụng wrote prolifically during the 1930s, and "produced a body of writing that", according to Zinoman, "stands today as the single most remarkable individual achievement in modern Vietnamese literature."&lt;ref name="Zinoman intro"/&gt;Although he only wrote for a short span of time, with his first work being the short story "Chống nạng lên đường" ("Set off with crutches") on the newspaper "Ngọ báo" in 1930, he had left an amazing collection of literature works: over 30 short stories, 9 novels, 9 reports, 7 plays, along with a translated play from French, some literature reviews and criticising, and hundreds of articles on the matters of politics, society, and culture. Some excerpts from his publications, for example "Số đỏ" ([[Dumb Luck (novel)|Dumb Luck]]) and "Giông Tố" (The Storm), were taken into Vietnamese literature textbooks. 

Famous with the [[satire]] in his works, he was compared to [[Balzac]] by some critics. However, due to his "realistic" descriptions and heavy emphasis on [[sex]], he was called to court by the French authority in [[Ha Noi]] for "outraging morality" (outrage aux bonnes moeurs)&lt;ref&gt;http://evan.vnexpress.net/News/doi-song-van-nghe/chuyen-lang-van/2005/11/3B9ACDF6/&lt;/ref&gt;. Later on, his works were prohibited to be published or read in [[North Vietnam]] because they were "obscene publications" until the late 1980s.

It was created by researchers at London-based artificial intelligence firm [[DeepMind]]. The technique, outlined in a paper in September 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oord|first=Aaron van den|last2=Dieleman|first2=Sander|last3=Zen|first3=Heiga|last4=Simonyan|first4=Karen|last5=Vinyals|first5=Oriol|last6=Graves|first6=Alex|last7=Kalchbrenner|first7=Nal|last8=Senior|first8=Andrew|last9=Kavukcuoglu|first9=Koray|date=2016-09-12|title=WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio|journal=|volume=1609|arxiv=1609.03499|bibcode=2016arXiv160903499V|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is able to generate relatively realistic-sounding human-like voices by directly modelling waveforms using a [[neural network]] method trained with recordings of real speech. Tests with US English and Mandarin reportedly showed that the system outperforms Google's best existing [[Speech synthesis#Text-to-speech systems|text-to-speech]] (TTS) systems, although it is still less convincing than actual human speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-09/google-s-ai-brainiacs-achieve-speech-generation-breakthrough|title=Google’s DeepMind Achieves Speech-Generation Breakthrough|last=Kahn|first=Jeremy|date=2016-09-09|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-07-06|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; WaveNet’s ability to generate raw waveforms means that it can model any kind of audio, including music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/09/09/google-deepmind-wavenet-ai/|title=Google's DeepMind Claims Massive Progress in Synthesized Speech|last=Meyer|first=David|date=2016-09-09|website=Fortune|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==History==

Generating speech from text is an increasingly common task thanks to the popularity of software such as Apple's [[Siri]], Microsoft’s [[Cortana]], [[Amazon Alexa]] and the [[Google Assistant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-09/google-s-ai-brainiacs-achieve-speech-generation-breakthrough|title=Google’s DeepMind Achieves Speech-Generation Breakthrough|last=Kahn|first=Jeremy|date=2016-09-09|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-07-06|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Most such systems use a variation of a technique that involves concatenated sound fragments together to form recognisable sounds and words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602343/face-of-a-robot-voice-of-an-angel/|title=When this computer talks, you may actually want to listen|last=Condliffe|first=Jamie|date=2016-09-09|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2017-07-06|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common of these is called concatenative TTS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunt|first=A.

The result sounds unnatural, with an odd cadence and tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/09/googles-wavenet-uses-neural-nets-to-generate-eerily-convincing-speech-and-music/|title=Google’s WaveNet uses neural nets to generate eerily convincing speech and music|last=Coldewey|first=Devin|date=2016-09-09|website=TechCrunch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reliance on a recorded library also makes it difficult to modify or change the voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/|title=WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio|last=van den Oord|first=Aäron|last2=Dieleman|first2=Sander|date=2016-09-08|website=DeepMind|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-06|last3=Zen|first3=Heiga}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Another technique, known as parametric TTS,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zen|first=Heiga|last2=Tokuda|first2=Keiichi|last3=Black|first3=Alan W.|date=2009|title=Statistical parametric speech synthesis|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167639309000648|journal=Speech Communication|volume=51|issue=11|pages=1039–1064}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses mathematical models to recreate sounds that are then assembled into words and sentences. The information required to generate the sounds is stored in the parameters of the model. The characteristics of the output speech are controlled via the inputs to the model, while the speech is typically created using a voice synthesiser known as a [[vocoder]]. This can also result in unnatural sounding audio.
 
==Design==
 
WaveNet is a type of [[feedforward neural network]] known as a deep [[convolutional neural network]] (CNN). In WaveNet, the CNN takes a raw signal as an input and synthesises an output one sample at a time. It does so by sampling from a [[Softmax function|softmax]] (i.e. [[Categorical distribution|categorical]]) distribution of a signal value that is encoded using [[μ-law]] companding transformation and [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantized]] to 256 possible values.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oord|first=Aaron van den|last2=Dieleman|first2=Sander|last3=Zen|first3=Heiga|last4=Simonyan|first4=Karen|last5=Vinyals|first5=Oriol|last6=Graves|first6=Alex|last7=Kalchbrenner|first7=Nal|last8=Senior|first8=Andrew|last9=Kavukcuoglu|first9=Koray|date=2016-09-12|title=WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio|journal=|volume=1609|arxiv=1609.03499|bibcode=2016arXiv160903499V|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In the [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03499.pdf 2016 paper], the network was fed real waveforms of speech in English and Mandarin. As these pass through the network, it learns a set of rules to describe how the audio waveform evolves over time. The trained network can then be used to create new speech-like waveforms at 16,000 samples per second. These waveforms include realistic breaths and lip smacks - but do not conform to any language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/778056/google-deepminds-wavenet-algorithm-can-accurately-mimic-human-voices/|title=Are you sure you're talking to a human?

WaveNet is able to accurately model different voices, with the accent and tone of the input correlating with the output. For example, if it is trained with German, it produces German speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/09/googles-wavenet-uses-neural-nets-to-generate-eerily-convincing-speech-and-music/|title=Google’s WaveNet uses neural nets to generate eerily convincing speech and music|last=Coldewey|first=Devin|date=2016-09-09|website=TechCrunch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ability to clone voices has raised ethical concerns about WaveNets ability to mimic the voices of living persons. 
 
The capability also means that if the WaveNet is fed other inputs - such as music - its output will be musical. At the time of its release, DeepMind showed that WaveNet could produce waveforms that sound like [[classical music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/|title=WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio|last=van den Oord|first=Aäron|last2=Dieleman|first2=Sander|date=2016-09-08|website=DeepMind|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-06|last3=Zen|first3=Heiga}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

At the time of its release, DeepMind said that WaveNet required too much computational processing power to be used in real world applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37899902|title=Adobe Voco 'Photoshop-for-voice' causes concern|date=2016-11-07|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-07-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2017, Google announced a 1,000-fold performance improvement along with better voice quality. WaveNet was then used to generate [[Google Assistant]] voices for US English and Japanese across all Google platforms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-launches-google-assistant/ WaveNet launches in the Google Assistant]&lt;/ref&gt; At the annual [[Google I/O|I/O developer conference]] in May 2018, it was announced that new Google Assistant voices were available and made possible by WaveNet; WaveNet greatly reduced the number of audio recordings that were required to create a voice model by modeling the raw audio of the voice actor samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-get-all-google-assistants-new-voices-right-now/|title=Try the all-new Google Assistant voices right now|last=Martin|first=Taylor|date=May 9, 2018|work=CNET|access-date=May 10, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Who's your daddy?''''' is a [[slang]] expression that, in one use, takes the form of a [[rhetorical question]].  It is commonly used as a boastful claim of dominance over the intended listener. It may also be a part of role play between consenting adults or as the cited author ascribes a "claim of sexual dominance of a man over a woman or another man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite it news| url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/39185947.html?dids=39185947:39185947&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Feb+23%2C+1999&amp;author=Eric+Zorn.&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=DADDY+NOT+GETTING+THE+HANG+OF+ALL+THIS+NEW+SLANG&amp;pqatl=google| title=DADDY NOT GETTING THE HANG OF ALL THIS NEW SLANG| work=The Chicago Tribune| author=Eric Zorn| date=Feb 23, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The phrase itself stands out as a noteworthy lyric from the 1968 song "[[Time of the Season]]" by [[The Zombies]]: "What's your name? Who's your daddy? Is he rich like me?"

==Usage==

===Media===
An early use of the phrase occurs in [[Gene Wilder]]'s 1975 comedy ''[[The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother]]''. Sigerson Holmes ([[Gene Wilder]]) grills Jenny Hill ([[Madeline Kahn]]), the supposed daughter of the British Minister of External Affairs, in a rather unusual interrogation process.  While sitting over her almost naked and rather responsive body lying on a couch, he massages her breasts and repeatedly asks her ''Who's Your Father?''.

In the 1979 film ''[[Scum (film)|Scum]]'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079871/&lt;/ref&gt; where the 'Daddy' refers to the inmate who runs the [[borstal]]. The character Carlin, played by [[Ray Winstone]], brutally bludgeons Banks, the current Daddy, thus becoming the new Daddy.

Widespread provocative use of the phrase began as early as the late 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A46032-2005Jan3.html| title=Conception of a Question: Who's Your Daddy?| work=The Washington Post| author=Paul Farhi | date=January 4, 2005}}&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; largely due to its frequent use in sexually suggestive skits broadcast by a popular syndicated radio [[shock jock]] known as "[[The Greaseman]]". The expression was further popularized in a well known 1991 comedy routine by [[Dennis Miller]]. On an early episode of ''[[The Daily Show]]'' host [[Craig Kilborn]] used the line "Who's your daddy? Is he rich like me?"{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}, quoting from "Time of the Season".

[[Denzel Washington]] playing Coach Boone in ''[[Remember the Titans]]'' (2000) uses the line to initiate dominance over two student athletes.

In the film ''[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (2005 film)|Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith]]'' (2005),&lt;ref&gt;http://imdb.com/title/tt0356910/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Angelina Jolie]] speaks the phrase after taking down adversary [[Brad Pitt]].

In an episode of ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' Jack O'Neill ([[Richard Dean Anderson]]) calls out "Who's your daddy?!" after finishing off a horde of Replicators, using a new form of weapon.

In the movie "[[Master of Disguise]]" (2002), Pistachio Disguisey continually says the phrase as he is sparring with a wooden robot.

The phrase was used as the title for a quickly cancelled reality television show, ''[[Who's Your Daddy? (TV series)|Who's Your Daddy]]''

In an episode of ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'', Jack, trying to transfer his rapport with Karen to Grace, asks her "Who's Your Daddy?" Grace, taken aback, says "His name is Martin Adler...?"

===Sports===
It was also greatly popularized when the Duke basketball team of the late 1990s had T-shirts and hats printed bearing the phrase as they moved towards a possible NCAA basketball championship coached by Coach K.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}. One variant commonly targeted at residents of [[Indiana]] is "[[Hoosier]] Daddy?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/35/messages/1390.html Hoosier Daddy?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The term  "Hoosier Daddy" was used during the tenure of Coach Bobby Knight at Indiana University throughout the Midwest as a means of fan excitation. In October 2017, two Indiana University alumni debuted a dope audio show titled "Hoosier Daddy podcast". Now considered a 4.5-star production based on iTunes reviews and the claim the hosts are "classless" &lt;ref&gt;https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/hoosierdaddypodcast/id1301866595&lt;/ref&gt;, the weekly show covers all topics concerning the IU Men's Varsity basketball program.&lt;ref&gt;https://hoosierdaddy.blog/&lt;/ref&gt;


Also used in the long-standing one sided wrestling rivalry between David Campbell and Logan Stieber. The former being on the winning end of it. The carrier dome would chant it at Stieber during matches.

In the [[2004 American League Championship Series]] it was used as a chant by [[New York Yankees]] fans against [[Boston Red Sox]] pitcher [[Pedro Martínez]] (prompted by his previous statement, "They beat me. They're that good right now. They're that hot. I just tip my hat and call the Yankees my daddy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/writers/tom_verducci/09/28/pedro.yankees/ | work=CNN | date=September 28, 2004 | title=SI.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

In the [[2009 World Series]], Pedro Martinez once again found himself hearing the "Who's your daddy" chants from the Yankees fans, this time as a starting pitcher for the Philadelphia Phillies in Games 2 and 6 of the series vs the AL Champion Yankees. The Yankees would come through against him this time, as they were victorious in both games, including the Game 6 series clinching game.  Note: Before Pedro walked off the mound on the final game, the chant was raised once more, but morphed a bit... changing from "Who's Your Daddy?" to "Still Your Daddy!". {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Music===
In June 2007, [[Daddy Yankee]] released a track called "Who's Your Daddy?" on his ''[[El Cartel: The Big Boss]]'' album.

===Video games===
In the computer game ''[[Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos]]'' by Blizzard Entertainment, players may enter the cheat code "WhosYourDaddy" to cause their army to become invulnerable and instantly kill enemies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://classic.battle.net/war3/cheatcodes.shtml Warcraft III cheat codes on battle.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Who's Your Daddy? (video game)|Who's Your Daddy?]]'' is also the title of an online [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer game]] currently gaining traction in the [[Independent video game development|indie gaming]] community. Players take either the role of a father rapidly baby-proofing his house until his wife gets home, or the role of a baby vehemently trying to kill itself. The game reached full funding on its [[Kickstarter]] Page on October 14, 2015, and was released December 23, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/334327310/whos-your-daddy The Kickstarter Page for Who's Your Daddy]&lt;/ref&gt;
