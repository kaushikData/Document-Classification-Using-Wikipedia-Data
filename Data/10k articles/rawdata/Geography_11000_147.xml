Nothing is known about Ibn Fadlan other than what can be inferred from his ''Risala''. 
It has been asserted that he was a [[fiqh|faqih]]'' (an espert in Islamic jurisprudence) at the court of the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[Al-Muqtadir]].

==Biography==

===Background===
Primary sources documents and historical texts reveal that Ahmad Ibn Fadlan was a “[[Fiqh|faqih]]”, an expert in [[Islam]]ic jurisprudence and faith, in the court of the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[Al-Muqtadir]].&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel, Judith. “Among the Norse Tribes: The Remarkable Account of Ibn Fadlan”. Saudi Aramco World. Houston: Aramco Services Company, 1999. 36-42. Web. 1 Dec. 2012 http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199906/among.the.norse.tribes-the.remarkable.account.of.ibn.fadlan.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113133305/http://saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199906/among.the.norse.tribes-the.remarkable.account.of.ibn.fadlan.htm |date=2010-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears certain from his writing that prior to his departure on his historic mission, he had already been serving for some time in the court of al-Muqtadir. Other than the fact that he was both a traveler and a [[theologian]] in service of the Abbasid Caliphate, little is known about Ahmad Ibn Fadlan prior to 921 and his self-reported travels.

===The embassy===
Ibn Fadlan was sent from [[Baghdad]] in 921 to serve as the secretary to an ambassador from the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[al-Muqtadir]] to the [[iltäbär]] (vassal-king under the [[Khazars]]) of the [[Volga Bulgaria]], [[Almış]].

On 21 June 921 (11 ''safar'' AH 309), a diplomatic party led by Susan al-Rassi, a eunuch in the caliph's court, left Baghdad.&lt;ref name="Knight, Judson 1449"&gt;Knight, Judson. "Ahmad ibn Fadlan." Science and Its Times. Ed. Neil Schlager and Josh Lauer. Vol. 2: 700 to 1449. Detroit: Gale, 2001. 81-82. Gale Virtual Reference Library.&lt;/ref&gt; Primarily, the purpose of their mission was to explain [[Sharia|Islamic law]] to the recently converted Bulgar peoples living on the eastern bank of the Volga River in what is now [[Russia]]. (These were the Volga Bulgars; another group of Bulgars had moved westward in the 6th century, invading the country that today bears their name, and became Christians.)  Additionally, the embassy was sent in response to a request by the king of the Volga Bulgars to help them against their enemies, the [[Khazars]].&lt;ref name="hermes"/&gt; Ibn Fadlan served as the group's religious advisor and lead counselor for Islamic religious doctrine and law.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Judson. "Ibn Fadlan: An Arab Among the Vikings of Russia." Science and Its Times. Ed. Neil Schlager and Josh Lauer. Vol. 2: 700 to 1449. Detroit: Gale, 2001. 32-34. Gale Virtual Reference Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmad Ibn Fadlan and the diplomatic party utilized established caravan routes toward [[Bukhara]], now part of [[Uzbekistan]], but instead of following that route all the way to the east, they turned northward in what is now northeastern Iran. Leaving the city of [[Gurgan]] near the [[Caspian Sea]], they crossed lands belonging to a variety of Turkic peoples, notably the [[Khazar Khaganate]], [[Oghuz Turks]] on the east coast of the Caspian, the [[Pechenegs]] on the [[Ural River]], and the [[Bashkirs]] in what is now central Russia, but the largest portion of his account is dedicated to the [[Rus' people|Rus]], i.e. the [[Varangians|Varangians (Vikings)]] on the [[Volga trade route]]. All told, the delegation covered some 4000 kilometers (2500&amp;nbsp;mi).&lt;ref name="Knight, Judson 1449"/&gt;

Ibn Fadlan's envoy reached the Volga Bulgar capital on 12 May 922 (12 ''muharram'' AH 310). 
When they arrived, Ibn Fadlan read aloud a letter from the caliph to the Bulgar [[Khan (title)|Khan]], and presented him with gifts from the caliphate. At the meeting with the Bulgar ruler, Ibn Fadlan delivered the caliph's letter, but was criticized for not bringing with him the promised money from the caliph to build a fortress as defense against enemies of the Bulgars.&lt;ref&gt;Frye (2005){{page needed|date=December 2016}}, Hermes (2012:80-98)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnographic writing==

===Manuscript tradition===
For a long time, only an incomplete version of the account was known, transmitted as quotations in the geographical dictionary of [[Yaqut al-Hamawi|Yāqūt]] (under the headings [[Volga River|Atil]], [[Bashgird]], [[Volga Bulgars|Bulghār]], [[Khazar]], [[Khwarizm|Khwārizm]], [[Kievan Rus'|Rūs]]),&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Fadlān, ''Ibn Fadlān and the Land of Darkness: Arab Travellers in the Far North'', trans. by Paul Lunde and Caroline Stone (London: Penguin, 2012), pp. xxxiv-xxxv.&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1823 by [[Christian Martin Frähn]].&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Fraehn, ''Ibn Fozlan's und anderer Araber Berichte über die Russen älterer Zeit'' (St Petersburg: Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1823).&lt;/ref&gt;

Only in 1923 was a manuscript discovered by [[Zeki Validi Togan]] in the [[Astane Quds Museum]], [[Mashhad]], [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="hermes"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hermes|first1=Nizar F.|title=The [European] Other in Medieval Arabic Literature and Culture: Ninth-Twelfth Century AD|date=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0230109407|pages=80–84|chapter=Utter Alterity or Pure Humanity: Barbarian Turks, Bulghars, and Rus (Vikings) in the Remarkable Risala of Ibn Fadlan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript, [[Ridawiya Library, MS 5229|Razawi Library MS 5229]], dates from the 13th century (7th century [[Hijri year|Hijra]]) and consists of 420 pages (210 folia). Besides other geographical treatises, it contains a fuller version of Ibn Fadlan's text (pp.&amp;nbsp;390–420). Additional passages not preserved in MS 5229 are quoted in the work of the 16th century [[Persian people|Persian]] [[geographer]] [[Amīn Rāzī]] called ''Haft Iqlīm'' ("Seven [[Clime]]s").

Neither source seems to record Ibn Fadlān's complete report. Yāqūt offers excerpts, and several times claims that Ibn Fadlān also recounted his return to Bagdad, but does not quote such material. Meanwhile, the text in Razawi Library MS 5229 breaks off part way through describing the Khazars.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Fadlān, ''Ibn Fadlān and the Land of Darkness: Arab Travellers in the Far North'', trans. by Paul Lunde and Caroline Stone (London: Penguin, 2012), pp. xxxv-xxxvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Account of the Volga Bulgars===
One noteworthy aspect of the Volga Bulgars that Ibn Fadlan focused on was their religion and the institution of [[Islam in Central Asia|Islam in these territories]]. The Bulgar king had invited religious instruction as a gesture of homage to the Abbasids in exchange for financial and military support, and Ibn Fadlan's mission as a  ''faqih'' was one of proselytization as well as diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;"what was ultimately sought by Almish had more to do with politics and money than with spirituality and religion. As a growing number of scholars have observed, there seemed to be a political agreement between the Bulghar king and the Abbasid caliph. With this arrangement, the former would receive financial and military help in exchange for paying religious-political homage to the Abbasids."  (Hermes 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, Ibn Fadlan details in his encounter that the Volga Bulgar Khan commits an error in his prayer exhortations by repeating the prayer twice. One scholar calls it an “illuminating episode” in the text where Ibn Fadlan expresses his great anger and disgust over the fact that the Khan and the Volga Bulgars in general are practicing some form of imperfect and doctrinally unsound Islam.  In general, Ibn Fadlan recognized and judged the peoples of central [[Eurasia]] he encountered by the possession and practice of Islam, along with their efforts put forth to utilize, implement, and foster Islamic faith and social practice in their respective society. Consequently, many of the peoples and societies to Ibn Fadlan were "like asses gone astray. They have no religious bonds with God, nor do they have recourse to reason".&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2009:159–60).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|width=25%|quote=''I have seen the Rus as they came on their merchant journeys and encamped by the [[Volga|Itil]]. I have never seen more perfect physical specimens, tall as date palms, blond and ruddy; they wear neither [[tunic]]s nor [[kaftan]]s, but the men wear a garment which covers one side of the body and leaves a hand free. Each man has an [[axe]], a [[sword]], and a [[knife]], and keeps each by him at all times. Each woman wears on either breast a box of [[iron]], [[silver]], [[copper]], or [[gold]]; the value of the box indicates the wealth of the husband. Each box has a ring from which depends a [[knife]]. The women wear neck-rings of gold and silver. Their most prized ornaments are [[green]] [[glass]] [[bead]]s. They string them as [[necklace]]s for their women.''|source='''Ibn Fadlan''', ''on the Rus merchants at Itil, 922''.
}}

===Account of the Rus'===
{{Further|Rus' people}}
A substantial portion of Ibn Fadlan's account is dedicated to the description of a people he called the ''[[Rus' (people)|Rūs]]'' (روس) or ''Rūsiyyah''. Western scholarship has generally assumed that he was describing [[Volga Vikings]], the [[North Germanic tribes]] travelling the [[Volga trade route]], though the identification of the people Ibn Fadlān describes is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;James E. Montgomery, '[https://www.journals.uio.no/index.php/JAIS/article/viewFile/4553/4006 Ibn Faḍlān and the Rūsiyyah]', ''Journal of Arabic and Islamic Studies'', 3 (2000), 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The Rūs appear as traders who set up shop on the river banks nearby the Bolğar camp. They are described as having bodies tall as (date) palm-trees, with blond hair and ruddy skin. Each is [[tattoo]]ed from "the tips of his toes to his neck" with dark blue or dark green "designs" and all men are armed with an axe, sword and long knife.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Fadlān, ''Ibn Fadlān and the Land of Darkness: Arab Travellers in the Far North'', trans. by Paul Lunde and Caroline Stone (London: Penguin, 2012), pp. 45-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Fadlan describes the Rus as "perfect" physical specimens and the hygiene of the ''Rūsiyyah'' as disgusting (while also noting with some astonishment that they comb their hair every day) and considers them vulgar and unsophisticated. In that, his account contrasts with that of the Persian traveler [[Ibn Rustah]], whose impressions of the Rus were more favourable. He also describes in great detail [[Viking funeral#Ibn Fadlan's account|the funeral of one of their chieftains]] (a [[ship burial]] involving rape and [[human sacrifice]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Fadlān, ''Ibn Fadlān and the Land of Darkness: Arab Travellers in the Far North'', trans. by Paul Lunde and Caroline Stone (London: Penguin, 2012), pp. 45-54.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars believe that it took place in the modern [[Balymer complex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Ru icon}} [http://sm-k.narod.ru/archives/2002/jan/3/13.htm Сибирский курьер.

Shaouripur, near Bateshwar, which is the birthplace of the 22nd Tirthankar of [[Jain]] faith, Lord Neminath. Each year the region hosts a cattle fair in October and November. The commercial [[livestock]] event is also of significance to [[Hindu]]s, who make pilgrimage to the river Yamuna in honor of Shiva.

Bateshwar has long been celebrated for its annual fair, believed to have been a fixture since time immemorial given the significance of Shoripur/Bateshwar in Hindu texts.  Although the origins of this ancient fair are religious, and of immense importance in the Hindu religious calendar, the fair is also of great commercial value,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/City/Agra/CM-gives-Rs-4-5-crore-to-match-Bateshwar-Fair-with-Pushkar-Mela/articleshow/44963473.cms|title=CM gives Rs 4.5 crore to match Bateshwar Fair with Pushkar Mela|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is renowned as the 2nd largest animal fair in the country (Sonepur in Bihar being the largest).

'''Blue Mountain Peak''' is the highest [[mountain]] in [[Jamaica]] and one of the highest peaks in the [[Caribbean]] at &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;2,256&amp;nbsp;metres&amp;nbsp;(7,402&amp;nbsp;ft)&lt;/span&gt;. It is the home of [[Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee|Blue Mountain coffee]] and their famous tours. It is located on the border of the  [[Portland Parish|Portland]] and [[Saint Thomas Parish, Jamaica|Saint Thomas]] parishes of Jamaica.

The [[Blue Mountains (Jamaica)|Blue Mountains]] are considered by many to be a hiker's and camper's paradise. The traditional Blue Mountain trek is a 7-mile (10&amp;nbsp;km) hike to the peak and consists of a 3,000-foot (1,000&amp;nbsp;m) increase in elevation. Jamaicans prefer to reach the peak at sunrise, thus the 3–4 hour hike is usually undertaken in darkness. Since the sky is usually very clear in the mornings, Cuba can be seen in the distance. Some of the plants found on the Blue Mountain cannot be found anywhere else in the world and they are often of a dwarfed sort. This is mainly due to the cold climate which inhibits growth. 
The small coffee farming communities of [[Claverty Cottage]] and [[Hagley Gap]] are located near the peak.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2152">'''Campaniacum''' is the [[etymon]] inferred from numerous [[toponym]]s in [[France]].  The ''[[Toponymie générale de la France]]'' (''TGF'') derives it from a [[Roman naming conventions|Roman personal name]] ''[[Campanius]]'' and the [[Gaul]]ish suffix '''''[[-acum]]'''''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Nègre]], ''[[Toponymie générale de la France]]'' (''TGF''), Librairie Droz, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''-i-'' (which is important in the phonetic evolution of *''Campaniacum'') suggests that ''Campanius'' is a ''[[gens]]'' name.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Nègre&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern forms differ according to the diverse phonetic evolutions of the local [[dialect]]s.

*[[Campagnac (disambiguation)|Campagnac]]  (TGF § 7029)
*[[Campénéac]] ([[Morbihan]])  (TGF § 7535)
*[[Campigny (disambiguation)|Campigny]] (TGF § 8819)
*[[Champagnac (disambiguation)|Champagnac]] (TGF § 7061 and § 7438)
*[[Champagnat (disambiguation)|Champagnat]] (TGF § 7612 and § 8480)
*[[Champagné, Sarthe|Champagné]] (TGF § 8133)
*[[Champagneux]] (TGF § 8537)
*[[Champagney (disambiguation)|Champagney]] (TGF § 7873)
*[[Champagny]] (TGF § 8868)
*[[Champigny (disambiguation)|Champigny]] (TGF § 8868)

The initial /ka/ of ''*Campaniacum'' became /ʃa/ (written ''Cha'') in most of [[Gaul]], both in [[langue d'oïl]] dialects and the northern [[langue d'oc]] dialects; but north of the [[Joret line]], and most Langue d'oc dialects (southern one) /ka/ (written ''Ca-'') was preserved.

In the form ''[[Champigny (disambiguation)|Champigny]]'', [[Gaston Zink]] offered an explanation for the sequence ''ign'' in place of the expected ''agn'': before the [[palatal consonant]] /ɲ/, the /a/ shifted to /e/, which in turn closed to /i/; Zink points out the parallel form ''(fungum) campaniolum'' ('mushroom') which became ''champ'''e'''gneul'' in [[Old French]] and ''champ'''i'''gnon'' (with substitution of suffix) in modern French.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaston Zink]], ''Phonétique historique du français'' (''French Phonetic History''), 1986, page 184.&lt;/ref&gt;  This shift is restricted to central langue d'oïl.

The '''Caribbean Current''' is a warm [[ocean current]] that transports significant amounts of water and flows northwestward through the Caribbean from the east along the coast of South America and into the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;ref name="The Caribbean Current" /&gt; The current results from the flow of the Atlantic [[South Equatorial Current]] as it flows north along the coast of Brazil. As the current turns north through the [[Yucatán Channel]], it is renamed the '''Yucatán Current'''. The Caribbean Current water comes from the Atlantic Ocean via the North Equatorial, North Brazil, and Guiana Currents. The circulation of the Columbia-Panama Gyre flows counter-clockwise to the Caribbean Current.&lt;ref name="The Caribbean Current"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Caribbean Current|url=http://oceancurrents.rsmas.miami.edu/caribbean/caribbean.html|publisher=CIMAS|accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2228">'''EnMAP''' (''Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program'') is a German [[hyperspectral]] [[satellite]] mission to provide high accuracy [[hyperspectral]] image data of the Earth surface on a timely and frequent basis.

==Overview==
Under the scientific lead of the [http://www.gfz-potsdam.de German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ)] the mission is managed by the Space Agency of the German Aerospace Center ([[German Aerospace Center|DLR]]). The Hyperspectral Imager (HSI) will be developed by [https://www.ohb-system.de OHB-System AG] which is also responsible for the development of the satellite bus. The [[ground segment]] will be developed and operated by the German Aerospace Center ([[German Aerospace Center|DLR]]). The envisaged launch of the EnMAP satellite is 2020 using the [[Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/isro-enmap-satellite-spot-7-satellite-k-radhakrishnan-pslv-rocket-mars-orbiter/1/326376.html|title=ISRO to launch German, French, British and Canadian satellites|accessdate=27 November 2013|newspaper=India Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Indian space agency ISRO.

EnMAP records data via a [[sun-synchronous orbit]] at a height of 653&amp;nbsp;km above the Earth. The [[satellite]] provides a high resolution [[hyperspectral]] imager capable of resolving 230 spectral bands from 420 to 2450&amp;nbsp;nm with a ground resolution of 30 m x 30 m. The swath width amounts to 30&amp;nbsp;km at a maximum swath length of up to 5000&amp;nbsp;km a day. The off-nadir (+/- 30°) pointing feature enables fast target revisit of 4 days.

EnMAP is designed to record bio-physical, bio-chemical and geo-chemical variables on a global basis and thus, to increase our understanding of biospheric /geospheric processes and to ensure the sustainability of our resources.

'''Environmental hormones''' are chemical compounds that resembles [[endocrine]] [[hormone]]s. They may be either of natural origin, such as [[phytoestrogen]]s, or of synthetic origin.  These compounds are able to activate the same endocrine [[Receptor_(biochemistry)|receptors]] as their natural counterparts and can thus disrupt hormonal activity. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Danzo |first=B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13128">The study of '''field systems''' (collections of fields) in [[landscape history]] is concerned with the size, shape and orientation of a number of fields. These are often adjacent, but may be separated by a later feature.
==Field systems by region==
===Czech Republic===
In the Czech Republic (ancient [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]] and [[Czech Silesia]]), [[Ervín Černý]] undertook a study of medieval field systems.&lt;ref&gt;ČERNÝ, Ervín. Výsledky výzkumu zaniklých středověkých osad a jejich plužin: historicko-geografická studie v regionu Drahanské vrchoviny. 1. vyd. Brno: Muzejní a vlastivědná společnost, 1992, 143 s. Vlastivědná knihovna moravská, Sv. 74. {{ISBN|80-850-4840-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
===England===
Although agriculture was practised earlier, the earliest recognisable field systems in England are [[neolithic]]. [[Clearance cairn|Cairnfields]], which are pre-historic in date, are found in upland areas. They contain scattered stones and boulders and originated in surface clearance for agriculture.&lt;ref name=EH&gt;''Field Systems'', English Heritage, May, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

So called [[Celtic fields]] can date from the Bronze Age through to the early Middle Ages. These fields are typically small and rectangular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=0-460-04159-2 |first=Christopher |last=Taylor|title=Fields in the English Landscape}} (However, he says the term "celtic fields" is "totally misleading and meaningless.")&lt;/ref&gt; They are frequently coaxial - that is they form a system in which the boundaries of adjacent fields make a series of long, roughly parallel lines. The extensive coaxial field systems established by the Romans are described as [[centuriation]].
[[File:Ridge&amp;Furrow.JPG|thumb|right|400px|Ridge and Furrow in [[Grendon, Northamptonshire|Grendon]], [[Northamptonshire]]]]

[[Open field system|Open fields]] were very large fields in which many individual farmers cultivated their own strips. These were a frequently found feature in the [[Midlands (England)|Midlands]] but less so in the South-east and West country. No documents survive which explain how and when the change to open fields took place, but signs of the change are apparent in some areas in the 8th, 9th or 10th centuries.&lt;ref name=EH/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Della|last=Hooke|title=The landscape of Anglo-Saxon England|publisher=Leicester University Press|year=1998|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of open fields began to decline in the 15th century. The landscape of open fields was frequently called "champion country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Susan|last=Oosthuizen|title=Landscapes Decoded|page=13|publisher=University of Hertfordshire Press|year=2006|isbn=1-902806-58-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, [[enclosure]] of open fields during the 18th and 19th century produced field systems with larger rectangular fields, often with [[blackthorn]] hedges. Adjacent areas were often enclosed at different times, leading to a change in orientation of the field systems between the two areas. The pattern of [[ridge and furrow]] will often reveal the layout of the original open fields.

In parts of England where enclosure took place early (or which were never enclosed), fields are often small and have an irregular shape, sometimes described as "pocket [[handkerchief]]".

Recent changes of agricultural practice are eliminating old field boundaries, particularly by removing [[hedgerow removal|hedges]], to produce much larger fields reminiscent of traditional open fields.
===Ireland===

The most famous ancient field system in [[Ireland]] is the [[Céide Fields]], an extensive series of stone walls dating back to 3500 BC. Similar stone wall field systems dating back to the [[Atlantic Bronze Age]] are visible in western Ireland and on the [[Aran Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0034666786900254|title=Reconstruction of local landscape development in the post-atlantic based on palaeoecological investigations at carrownaglogh prehistoric field system, County Mayo, Ireland|date=1 December 1986|publisher=|journal=Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology|volume=49|issue=3-4|pages=117–176|via=www.sciencedirect.com|doi=10.1016/0034-6667(86)90025-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=g_Xdc8cIbhAC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=%22field+system%22+ireland&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0wfXUlOPbAhXkA8AKHVqjBsMQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22field+system%22+ireland&amp;f=false|title=Landscapes of Neolithic Ireland|first=Gabriel|last=Cooney|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primitive [[ard (plough)|ard plough]] used in [[Gaelic Ireland]] only scratched the surface of the soil, so cross-ploughing was necessary to break up the earth better. This favoured square fields, so groups of square-shaped fields are likely to have been laid out in the pre-Norman period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cambridgeairphotos.com/location/aph045/|title=Old field system. Brideswell, Roscommon, Ireland – aerial photo|website=www.cambridgeairphotos.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cambridgeairphotos.com/location/atf063/|title=Old field system. Tuam, Galway, Ireland – aerial photo|website=www.cambridgeairphotos.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Normans brought the [[Carruca|heavy plough]] to Ireland in the 12th century. This favoured long rectangular fields, so groups of fields with that shape are likely to postdate the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]].

The [[open-field system]] ("champion system") predominated in medieval Ireland. In the better land of the eastern part of the island, a [[manorial]] system similar to that of the rest of Europe as practiced. Strips of land belonging to the village farmers lay in two or three enormous open fields, each cultivated with the same crop on an agreed cycle — typically a three-year cycle of [[cereal]], then [[legume]], then [[fallow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=su2pNiqz-wIC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=%22field+system%22+ireland&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0wfXUlOPbAhXkA8AKHVqjBsMQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22field+system%22+ireland&amp;f=false|title=PRE-FAMINE IRELAND: SOCIAL STRUCTURE|first=Desmond|last=Keenan|date=7 March 2001|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopedia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/international/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/rural-settlement-and-field-systems|title=Rural Settlement and Field Systems - Dictionary definition of Rural Settlement and Field Systems - Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In marginal land (especially the high-rainfall west of Ireland),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=HK6Hz1WTPGMC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=%22field+system%22+ireland&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0wfXUlOPbAhXkA8AKHVqjBsMQ6AEITjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=%22field+system%22+ireland&amp;f=false|title=Ireland 1603-1702, Society and History|first=Desmond|last=Keenan|date=7 February 2013|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[rundale]] system was used. The land was divided into discontinuous plots, and cultivated and occupied by a number of tenants to whom it is [[lease]]d jointly. Houses were clustered in a [[clachán]] on the better land ("infield"), which was surrounded by mountainous or grazing land of lower quality ("outfield") where livestock ([[sheep]], [[cattle]]) were grazed during summer or dry periods ([[Transhumance|booleying]]). Only the infield was fertilised with [[manure]]. The outfield might be used to grow [[oats]] after a few years of lying fallow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-0289.1955.tb01537.x|title=INFIELD AND OUTFIELD IN IRELAND|first=DESMOND|last=McCOURT|date=1 April 1955|publisher=|journal=The Economic History Review|volume=7|issue=3|pages=369–376|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0289.1955.tb01537.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The present system of fields in Ireland dates to the 17th–18th century onwards, with [[enclosure]] of land by ditches (stone-and-sod banks) and hedgerows (made of [[Crataegus monogyna|hawthorn]], [[Fagus sylvatica|beech]] and [[Acer pseudoplatanus|sycamore]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/environment-geography/flora-fauna/Flora-and-fauna/networks-for-life/|title=Networks for Life|website=www.askaboutireland.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with a centrally located farmhouse and farmyard, being the hallmark of "improvement."&lt;ref name="encyclopedia.com"/&gt; Rapid population expansion prior to the [[Irish Potato Famine|Great Famine]] (1845–49) resulted in fragmentation of farms and fields. After the famine, continuous emigration resulted in consolidation or abandonment of fields. Relicts of these [[deserted villages]] and [[clachán]]s are still visible in the form of [[lazy beds]] and drystone walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nuigalway.ie/colleges-and-schools/arts-social-sciences-and-celtic-studies/geography-archaeology/disciplines/archaeology/research/ireland-atlantic-europe/thearchaeologyofirelandsgreatfamine/|title=The Archaeology of Ireland's Great Famine - NUI Galway|website=www.nuigalway.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[hedge]]rows that divide most of the fields of Ireland are estimated to run for over {{Convert|830000|km|abbr=on}} and cover a greater land area than forests or [[National parks in the Republic of Ireland|national parks]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.heritagecouncil.ie/content/files/historic_landscape_characterisation_guidance_2013_8mb.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wales===
Where early fields survive in Wales, most are associated with settlement features that indicate an Iron Age or Romano-British date. However buried soils as well peat pollen cores indicate earlier land-use of these areas and radiocarbon dates suggest a limited amount of woodland clearance as early as the Later Mesolithic &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.11141/ia.47.2 | issue=47 | title=Archaeological and environmental investigation of three prehistoric field systems in Gwynedd, north-west Wales | year=2018 | journal=Internet Archaeology | last1 = Smith | first1 = George |last2 = Caseldine | first2 = Astrid |last3 = Hopewell | first3 = David |last4 = Johnston  | first4 = Robert |last5 = Macphail | first5 = Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identifying former field systems==
The [[Boundaries in landscape history|boundaries]] of earlier field systems that have fallen out of use, can sometimes be deduced by studying [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]] (lumps and bumps), [[cropmark]]s or by using [[Archaeological geophysics|geophysics]]. Studying early maps will often show the field system in use at the time the map was prepared. From the mid 17th century, landowners began to commission [[estate maps]] that show the size and layout of the fields they own. However, for many English parishes, the earliest written evidence of their field system is from the [[enclosure|enclosure maps]] or [[tithe maps]]. It is often possible to draw conclusions about relative age by looking at how field boundaries meet. Later boundaries will often abut, but not cross earlier boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Hunter|title=Field Systems in Essex|year=2003|publisher=Essex Society for Archaeology and History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drawing conclusions from analysis of field systems==
Fields were organised for the convenience of the farmer - both arable and pastoral. Therefore, the size of fields often gives an indication of the type of [[agriculture]] and agricultural implements in use when they were established. The shape and orientation of collections of fields provides clues about the date they were established. Field systems can give an indication of land ownership and social structure. The extent to which the field system respects other features (or not) can be used as dating evidence for the other features or the field system itself. For example, a field system that doesn't respect a Roman road is likely to predate it. Similarly, a feature that respects medieval [[ridge and furrow]] is likely to post date it.

[[The Rodings]] (the largest group of parishes in England to bear a common name)&lt;ref name="EL0608"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/Launch.aspx?referral=other&amp;pnum=&amp;refresh=3Ex0Hy14j5C1&amp;EID=52357006-6cf2-46b7-874f-a85febe6a2c6&amp;skip=true|title= Around the Rodings |last=Rollason |first=Pam |date=June 2008|work=Essex Life|publisher=Archant|page=92 |accessdate=2009-02-03}} (Registration required.)&lt;/ref&gt; was investigated by Steven Basset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Landscape History|volume=19|year=1997|pages=25–42|title=Continuity and fission in the Anglo-Saxon landscape: the origins of the Rodings (Essex)|first=Steven|last=Basset}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basset showed that a broadly rectilinear field system (and other features such as roads) continued across parish boundaries thus showing that the field system pre-dated the formation of parishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The NEW Reading the Landscape|first=Richard|last=Muir|page=123|publisher=University of Exeter Press|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He therefore concluded that they had originally been a single estate.

[[Jamaica]] lies {{convert|90|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} south of [[Cuba]] and {{convert|118|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} west of [[Haiti]]. At its greatest extent, Jamaica is {{convert|146|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} long, and its width varies between {{convert|34|and|84|km|mi|abbr=on}}. With an area of {{convert|10,911|km2|abbr=on}}, Jamaica is the largest island of the [[Commonwealth Caribbean]] and the third largest of the [[Greater Antilles]], after [[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]]. Many small islands are located along the south coast of Jamaica, such as the [[Port Royal Cays]]. Southwest of mainland Jamaica lies [[Pedro Bank]], an area of shallow seas, with a number of [[cay]]s (low islands or reefs), extending generally east to west for over {{convert|160|km|abbr=on}}. To the southeast lies Morant Bank, with the [[Morant Cays]], {{convert|51|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Morant Point]], the easternmost point of mainland Jamaica. [[Alice Shoal]], {{convert|260|km|abbr=on}} southwest of the main island of Jamaica, falls within the Jamaica–Colombia Joint Regime.

==Geology and landforms==
{{main|Geology of Jamaica}}
Jamaica and the other islands of the Antilles evolved from an arc of ancient volcanoes that rose from the sea millions of years ago. During periods of submersion, thick layers of limestone were laid down over the old igneous and metamorphic rock. In many places, the limestone is thousands of feet{{Specify|date=March 2012}} thick. The country can be divided into three landform regions: the central mountain chain formed by igneous and metamorphic rocks; the karst limestone hills in the Cockpit area; the low-lying coastal plains and interior valleys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fiwiroots.com/terrain.html|title=Jamaica Terrain, Features, Size and Population - Fiwi Roots|website=fiwiroots.com|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest area is the [[Blue Mountains (Jamaica)|Blue Mountains]] range. These eastern mountains are formed by a central ridge of metamorphic rock running northwest to southeast from which many long spurs jut to the north and south. For a distance of over {{convert|3|km|mi}}, the crest of the ridge exceeds {{convert|1800|m|ft}}. The highest point is [[Blue Mountain Peak]] at {{convert|7402|ft|m|order=flip}}. The Blue Mountains rise to these elevations from the coastal plain in the space of about {{convert|16|km|mi}}, thus producing one of the steepest general gradients in the world. In this part of the country, the old metamorphic rock reveals itself through the surrounding limestone. To the north of the Blue Mountains lies the strongly tilted [[limestone]] plateau forming the [[John Crow Mountains]]. This range rises to elevations of over {{convert|1000|m|ft}}. To the west, in the central part of the country, are two high rolling plateaus: the [[Dry Harbour Mountains]] to the north and the Manchester Plateau to the south. Between the two, the land is rugged and here, also, the limestone layers are broken by the older rocks. Streams that rise in the region flow outward and sink soon after reaching the limestone layers.

The limestone plateau covers two-thirds of the country, so that [[karst]] formations dominate the island. Karst is formed by the erosion of the limestone in solution. Sinkholes, caves and caverns, disappearing streams, hummocky hills, and terra rosa (residual red) soils in the valleys are distinguishing features of a karst landscape; all these are present in Jamaica. To the west of the mountains is the rugged terrain of the [[Cockpit Country]], one of the world's most dramatic examples of karst topography.

The Cockpit Country is pockmarked with steep-sided hollows, as much as {{convert|120|m|ft}} deep in places, which are separated by conical hills and ridges. On the north, the main defining feature is the fault-based "Escarpment", a long ridge that extends from Flagstaff in the west, through Windsor in the centre, to Campbells and the start of the Barbecue Bottom Road (B10). The Barbecue Bottom Road, which runs north-south, high along the side of a deep, fault-based valley in the east, is the only drivable route across the [[Cockpit Country]]. However, there are two old, historical trails that cross further west, the Troy Trail, and the Quick Step Trail, both of which are seldom used {{As of|2006|lc=y}} and difficult to find. In the southwest, near Quick Step, is the district known as the "Land of Look Behind," so named because Spanish horsemen venturing into this region of hostile runaway slaves were said to have ridden two to a mount, one rider facing to the rear to keep a precautionary watch. Where the ridges between sinkholes in the plateau area have dissolved, flat-bottomed basins or valleys have been formed that are filled with terra rosa soils, some of the most productive on the island. The largest basin is the Vale of Clarendon, {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|32|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide. Queen of Spains Valley, [[Nassau Valley]], and Cave Valley were formed by the same process.

==Coasts==
The coastline of Jamaica is one of many contrasts. The northeast shore is severely eroded by the ocean. There are many small inlets in the rugged coastline, but no coastal plain of any extent. A narrow strip of plains along the northern coast offers calm seas and white sand beaches. Behind the beaches is a flat raised plain of uplifted coral reef.

The southern coast has small stretches of plains lined by black sand beaches. These are backed by cliffs of limestone where the plateaus end. In many stretches with no coastal plain, the cliffs drop {{convert|300|m|ft}} straight to the sea. In the southwest, broad plains stretch inland for a number of kilometres. The [[Black River (Jamaica)|Black River]] courses {{convert|70|km|mi}} through the largest of these plains. The swamplands of the Great Morass and the Upper Morass fill much of the plains. The western coastline contains the island's finest beaches.

Two types of climate are found in Jamaica. An upland tropical climate prevails on the windward side of the mountains, whereas a semiarid climate predominates on the leeward side. Warm trade winds from the east and northeast bring rainfall throughout the year. The rainfall is heaviest from May to October, with peaks in those two months. The average rainfall is {{convert|1960|mm|in|1}} per year. Rainfall is much greater in the mountain areas facing the north and east, however. Where the higher elevations of the John Crow Mountains and the Blue Mountains catch the rain from the moisture-laden winds, rainfall exceeds {{convert|5080|mm|in|0}} per year. Since the southwestern half of the island lies in the rain shadow of the mountains, it has a semiarid climate and receives fewer than {{convert|760|mm|in|1}} of rainfall annually.

Temperatures in Jamaica are fairly constant throughout the year, averaging {{convert|25|to|30|°C|°F}} in the lowlands and {{convert|15|to|22|°C|°F|1}} at higher elevations. Temperatures may dip to below {{convert|10|°C}} at the peaks of the Blue Mountains. The island receives, in addition to the northeast trade winds, refreshing onshore breezes during the day and cooling offshore breezes at night. These are known on Jamaica as the "Doctor Breeze" and the "Undertaker's Breeze," respectively.

Jamaica lies in the Atlantic [[hurricane belt]]; as a result, the island sometimes experiences significant storm damage. Powerful hurricanes which have hit the island directly causing death and destruction include [[Hurricane Charlie (1951)|Hurricane Charlie]] in 1951 and [[Hurricane Gilbert]] in 1988. Several other powerful hurricanes have passed near to the island with damaging effects. In 1980, for example, [[Hurricane Allen]] destroyed nearly all Jamaica's banana crop. [[Hurricane Ivan]] (2004) swept past the island causing heavy damage and a number of deaths; in 2005, Hurricanes [[Hurricane Dennis|Dennis]] and [[Hurricane Emily (2005)|Emily]] brought heavy rains to the island. A Category 4 hurricane, [[Hurricane Dean]], caused some deaths and heavy damage to Jamaica in August 2007.

The [[Pre-1600 Atlantic hurricane seasons|first recorded]] hurricane to hit Jamaica was in 1519. The island has been struck by tropical cyclones regularly. During two of the coldest periods in the last 250 years (1780s and 1810s), the frequency of hurricanes in the Jamaica region was unusually high. Another peak of activity occurred in the 1910s, the coldest decade of the 20th century. On the other hand, hurricane formation was greatly diminished from 1968 to 1994, which for some reason coincides with the great [[Sahel drought]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The 18th century climate of Jamaica derived from the journals of [[Thomas Thistlewood]], 1750-1786 |last=Chenoweth |first=Michael |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2003 |series=Transactions of the American Philosophical Society |volume=93 |publisher=American Philosophical Society |location=Philadelphia |isbn=0-87169-932-X |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vegetation and wildlife==
{{expand section|date=July 2014}}
Although most of Jamaica's native vegetation has been stripped in order to make room for cultivation, some areas have been left virtually undisturbed since the time of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]. Indigenous vegetation can be found along the northern coast from Rio Bueno to [[Discovery Bay, Jamaica|Discovery Bay]], in the highest parts of the Blue Mountains, and in the heart of the Cockpit Country.

As in the case of vegetation, considerable loss of wildlife has occurred beginning with the settlement of native peoples in the region millennia ago. For example, the only [[pinniped]] ever known to the Caribbean, the [[Caribbean monk seal]] once occurred in Jamaican waters and has now been driven to [[extinction]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Saundry. 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4163">The '''geology of [[Nicaragua]]''' includes [[Paleozoic]] crystalline basement rocks, [[Mesozoic]] intrusive igneous rocks and sedimentary rocks spanning the [[Cretaceous]] to the [[Pleistocene]]. Volcanoes erupted in the [[Paleogene]]and within the last 2.5&amp;nbsp;million years of the [[Quaternary]], due to the subduction of the Cocos Plate, which drives melting and magma creation. Many of these volcanoes are in the Nicaraguan Depression paralleled by the northwest-trending Middle America Trench which marks the Caribbean-Cocos plate boundary. Almost all the rocks in Nicaragua originated as dominantly [[felsic]] continental crust, unlike other areas in the region which include stranded sections of [[mafic]] oceanic crust. Structural geologists have grouped all the rock units as the Chortis Block.

==Volcanology==
Volcanism remains active in Nicaragua. The Masaya Caldera Complex erupted 460,000 and 50,000 years ago with the Las Sierras Formation as a Pliocene-Pleistocene basement rock. Massive pyroclastic and [[ignimbrite]] eruptions caused the caldera to collapse although most of the material it erupted has been basalt. Analysis of an eruption of the caldera in 1772 indicates perhaps the highest rate of lava effusion in Central America.&lt;ref name="osti"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Geology and eruptive mechanisms of Masaya Caldera Complex, Nicaragua (Thesis/Dissertation)|osti = 6676327|date = January 1983|last1 = Williams|first1 = S. N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another active volcano is the San Cristobal Volcanic Complex in the northwest, which erupted in the 1500s and 1600s and again at a reduced level in 1971, with tholeiitic, calc-alkaline and [[andesite]] material.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0377027387900643|title=Geology of the San Cristobal volcanic complex, Nicaragua|journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research|volume=33|pages=223–230|accessdate=2018-11-10|doi=10.1016/0377-0273(87)90064-3|year=1987|last1=Hazlett|first1=Richard W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural resource geology==
Nicaragua has 94 metal deposits and 46 non-metallic deposits. It is the leading gold producer in Central America from deposits in Bonanza, La Libertad and Limon, in epithermal and mesothermal vein deposits, as well as skarn and placer deposits. Eight million ounces of gold have been extracted since 1930. Copper, zinc, silver, limestone, aggregate, clay and gypsum are also important resources.&lt;ref name="tandfonline"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Information for|journal=International Geology Review|volume=42|pages=45–63|doi=10.1080/00206810009465069|year = 2000|last1 = Arengi|first1 = Joseph T.|last2=Hodgson|first2=Glen V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1943 and 1977, seismic and drilling surveys were done on the Miskito Basin off the eastern shore in search of oil.&lt;ref name="seg"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=An Error Occurred Setting Your User Cookie|journal=The Leading Edge|volume=16|issue=12|pages=1799–1806|doi=10.1190/1.1437584|year = 1997|last1 = Muñoz|first1 = Angélica|last2=Baca|first2=Dania|last3=Artiles|first3=Verónica|last4=Duarte|first4=Manuel|last5=Barboza|first5=Guillermo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wiley"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Neotectonic development of western Nicaragua - Weinberg - 1992 - Tectonics|journal=Tectonics|volume=11|issue=5|pages=1010–1017|doi=10.1029/92TC00859|year = 1992|last1 = Weinberg|first1 = Roberto Ferrez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10737">The '''Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol''' is a tool that promotes and guides more sustainable [[hydropower]] projects. It is a methodology used to measure the performance of a hydropower project across more than twenty environmental, social, technical and economic topics.

Hydropower projects can have both a positive and a negative environmental and social impact. This is because the construction of a [[dam]], power plant and [[reservoir]] creates certain social and physical changes in the area it effects. The protocol provides a common language to allow governments, [[civil society]], financial institutions and the hydropower sector to talk about and evaluate [[sustainability]] issues.

Assessments are based on objective evidence and the results are presented in a standardised way, to show how new projects are being developed or how existing facilities are performing.

It has been designed to work on projects and facilities anywhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hydropower Sustainability - Home|url = http://www.hydrosustainability.org/|website = www.hydrosustainability.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hydropower Sustainability - Protocol Basics|url = http://www.hydrosustainability.org/Protocol.aspx|website = www.hydrosustainability.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application  ==

=== Purpose ===

The Protocol is used by different hydropower stakeholders for different reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hydropower Sustainability - How it can help|url = http://www.hydrosustainability.org/Protocol/How-can-it-help-.aspx|website = www.hydrosustainability.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crédit Agricole]], [[Société Générale|Societe Generale]], [[Standard Chartered]], [[Citigroup|Citi]], and [[UBS]] now refer to the Protocol in their sector guidance.&lt;ref&gt;http://mediacommun.ca-cib.com/sitegenic/medias/DOC/13870/2012-12-politique-sectorielle-rse-energie-hydroelectricite-eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/files/documents/Document%20RSE/Finance%20responsable/Dams%20&amp;%20Hydropower%20Sector%20Policy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sc.com/en/resources/global-en/pdf/sustainabilty/Dams_and_Hydropower_Position_Statement.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.citigroup.com/citi/environment/data/1160840_Sector_Brief_HydroPower.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ubs.com/content/dam/ubs/global/about_ubs/corporate_responsibility/UBS-ESR-framework.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Bank]] has analysed the value of the Protocol for use by their clients, concluding that it is a useful tool for guiding the development of sustainable hydropower in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Protocol for World Bank clients|url = http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2014/06/20106007/hydropower-sustainability-assessment-protocol-use-world-bank-clients-lessons-learned-recommendations|website = documents.worldbank.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Institute for Environment and Development]] has reviewed social and environmental safeguards for large dam projects, concluding that the Protocol currently offers the best available ‘measuring stick’ for the [[World Commission on Dams]] provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A review of social and environmental safeguards for large dam projects|url = http://pubs.iied.org/17517IIED.html|website = pubs.iied.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Process ===

A Protocol assessment takes place over a one-week period at the project site and provides a rapid sustainability check.

A Protocol assessment does not replace an [[Environmental impact assessment|environmental and social impact assessment]] (ESIA), which takes place over a much longer period of time as a mandatory regulatory requirement. A Protocol assessment will, amongst other things, check the scope and quality of the ESIA which has been done.

To ensure high quality, all commercial use of the Protocol is carried out by accredited assessors. These assessors have significant experience of the hydropower sector or relevant sustainability issues, and have passed a rigorous accreditation course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hydropower Sustainability - Accredited Assessors|url = http://www.hydrosustainability.org/Protocol/Accredited-Assessors.aspx|website = www.hydrosustainability.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scope ==

=== Tools ===
The Protocol can be used at any stage of hydropower development, from the early planning stages through to operation.  Each project stage is assessed using a different tool: 
* The early stage tool, a screening tool for potential hydropower projects
* The preparation tool, which covers planning and design, management plans and commitments.
* The implementation tool, used through the construction phase.
* The operation tool, used on working projects.

=== Topics ===
The Protocol covers a range of topics that need to be understood to assess the overall sustainability of a hydropower project.

The name and range of topics changes slightly at different project stages.

==== Social aspects ====

*Communications and consultation
*Project benefits
*Project affected communities and livelihoods
*Resettlement 
*[[Indigenous peoples]]
*Labour and working conditions
*Public health
*Cultural heritage

==== Environmental aspects ====

*Environmental and social assessment and management  
*[[Biodiversity]] and invasive species 
*[[Erosion]] and [[sedimentation]]  
*Water quality  
*Waste, noise and air quality  
*[[Reservoir]] planning / preparation and filling / management  
*Downstream flow regimes

==== Business aspects ====

*[[Governance]]
*[[Procurement]]
*Integrated project management 
*Financial viability
*Economic viability

==== Technical aspects ====

*Demonstrated need and strategic fit
*Siting and design
*Hydrological resource
*Asset reliability and efficiency
*Infrastructure safety

The Protocol also includes ‘cross-cutting issues’ such as [[climate change]], [[gender]], and [[human rights]], which feature in multiple topics.

=== Criteria ===
For each sustainability topic, performance is assessed against a range of criteria at two levels: basic good practice and proven best practice.

==== Table 2: Criteria requirement at different levels. ====

== History  ==
A multi-stakeholder forum developed the Protocol between 2008 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hydropower Sustainability - History|url = http://www.hydrosustainability.org/Protocol/Protocol-development.aspx|website = www.hydrosustainability.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following key group were represented: social and environmental NGOs, governments of developed and developing countries, financial institutions, development banks, and the hydropower industry.

The forum jointly reviewed, enhanced and built consensus on what a sustainable hydropower project should look like.

Policies taken into account included the [[World Commission on Dams]]’ Criteria and Guidelines, World Bank Safeguard Policies, IFC Performance Standards, and the [[Equator Principles]].

A draft of the Protocol was released in 2009, which was trialled in 16 countries across six continents and subjected to further consultation involving 1,933 individual stakeholders from 28 countries.

The final version was produced in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hydropower Sustainability - Download Protocol Document|url = http://www.hydrosustainability.org/Protocol/The-Protocol-Documents.aspx|website = www.hydrosustainability.org|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The diversity of the forum was important to ensure that the Protocol became globally applicable and universally accepted. Diversity also ensured that the multiple perspectives and stakeholder interests surrounding a hydropower project were incorporated into the document.

== Governance  ==
The Protocol is governed by a multi-stakeholder body, the Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Council (HSA Council).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hydrosustainability.org/Governance.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission of the Council is to ensure multi-stakeholder input and confidence in the Protocol's content and application.

All individuals and organisations engaged in hydropower are welcome and encouraged to join the Council. This approach to governance ensures that all stakeholder voices are heard in the shaping of the use of the Protocol and its future development.

The Council consists of a series of Chambers, each representing a different segment of hydropower stakeholders. Each chamber elects a chair and alternate chair for a two-year term. The chamber chairs come together regularly to form the decision-making Protocol Governance Committee. The current Governance Committee (elected May 2015) is shown in the table below.

An '''insular area''' of the [[United States]] is a [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territory]] that is neither a part of one of the 50 [[U.S. state|states]] nor of a [[Federal district]]. [[Article Four of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: Property Clause|Article IV, Section 3, Clause 2]] of the [[United States Constitution]] grants to [[United States Congress]] the responsibility of overseeing these territories,{{efn|Although an [[archaism]], some older federal statutes and regulations still in force refer to insular areas as ''possessions''.}} of which there are currently 14—three in the [[Caribbean Sea]] and 11 in the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref name=USDoI&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.doi.gov/oia/islands/politicatypes| title=Definitions of Insular Area Political Organizations| publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior| location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=March 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These territories are classified by whether they are incorporated (by Congress extending the full body of the Constitution to the territory as it applies to the several states), and whether they have an organized territorial government established by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] through an [[Organic Act]].&lt;ref name=DotI&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.doi.gov/oia/islands/politicatypes| title=Definitions of Insular Area Political Organizations| publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior| location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=March 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; All territories but one are [[Unincorporated territories of the United States|unincorporated]], and all but four are considered to be [[Unorganized territory|unorganized]]. Five U.S. territories have a permanent, nonmilitary population. Each of them has a civilian government, a constitution, and enjoys some degree of local political [[autonomy]].

Congress has extended citizenship rights by birth to all inhabited territories except [[American Samoa]], and these citizens may vote and run for office in any U.S. jurisdiction in which they are residents. The people of [[American Samoa]] are [[United States nationality law#Nationals|U.S. nationals]] by place of birth, or they are U.S. citizens by parentage, or naturalization after residing in a State for three months.&lt;ref&gt;PBS Newshour, [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/american-samoans-dont-right-u-s-citizenship-court-rules/ "American Samoans don't have right to U.S. citizenship"], Associated Press, June 5, 2015, viewed August 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Nationals are free to move around and seek employment within the United States without immigration restrictions but cannot vote or hold office outside American Samoa.&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Interior.

==Taxation==
Residents of the five major populated insular areas do not pay U.S. federal [[income tax]]es but are required to pay other U.S. federal taxes such as import/export taxes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stanford.wellsphere.com/healthcare-industry-policy-article/puerto-rico/267827 |title=Puerto Ricans pay import/export taxes |publisher=Stanford.wellsphere.com |accessdate=August 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401034052/http://stanford.wellsphere.com/healthcare-industry-policy-article/puerto-rico/267827 |archivedate=April 1, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1952-54v03/d903| title=Foreign Relations of the United States | author=U.S. State Dept.| quote=The people of Puerto Rico will continue to be exempt from Federal income taxes on the income they derive from sources within Puerto Rico, and into their treasury, for appropriation and expenditure as their legislature may decide, will be deposited the proceeds of United States internal revenue taxes collected on articles produced in Puerto Rico and the proceeds of United States tariffs and customs collected on foreign merchandise entering Puerto Rico.| accessdate=May 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; federal commodity taxes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stanford.wellsphere.com/healthcare-industry-policy-article/puerto-rico/267827 |title=Puerto Ricans pay federal commodity taxes |publisher=Stanford.wellsphere.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401034052/http://stanford.wellsphere.com/healthcare-industry-policy-article/puerto-rico/267827 |archivedate=2010-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; social security taxes, etc. Individuals working for the federal government pay [[Income tax in the United States|federal income tax]]es while all residents are required to pay federal [[payroll tax]]es ([[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc903.html |title=Internal Revenue Service.

According to [[U.S. Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] Publication 570, income from other U.S. [[Pacific Ocean]] insular areas ([[Howland Island|Howland]], [[Baker Island|Baker]], [[Jarvis Island|Jarvis]], [[Johnston Island|Johnston]], [[Midway Islands|Midway]], [[Palmyra Atoll|Palmyra]], and [[Wake Island|Wake]] Islands, and [[Kingman Reef]]) is fully taxable as income of United States residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Publication 570 |publisher=U.S. Internal Revenue Service |year=2017 |place=Washington, D.C.|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p570.pdf |accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associated States==

The [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] uses the term insular area to refer not only to territories under the [[sovereignty]] of the United States, but also those independent nations that have signed a [[Compact of Free Association]] with the United States.  While these nations participate in many otherwise domestic programs, and full responsibility for their military defense rests with the United States, they are legally distinct from the United States and their inhabitants are not United States citizens or nationals.&lt;ref name=USDoI/&gt;

'''Isu''' is a local government area in the [[Imo State]] of [[Nigeria]].
Its headquarters are in the town of [[Umundugba]]. Other communities are [[Amandugba]], [[Ekwe Community|Ekwe]], [[Uburu Ekwe]], [[Isunjaba]], Amurie Omanze, [[Ebenator Ekwe]] and Oboro Amurie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isu.gov.ng/about/education-and-schools/|title=Education &amp; Schools|publisher=Isu LGA|accessdate=2011-06-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808234500/http://isu.gov.ng/about/education-and-schools/|archivedate=2013-08-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The name comes from the [[Isu people]], a subgroup of the [[Igbo people]].{{sfn|Olson|1996|pp=245}}

[[Amandugba]] and neighboring [[Umundugba]] used to be one town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=194|title=Africa, our times and culture, Volume 1, Part 2|editor=Egbe Ifie|publisher=Oputoru Books |year=2000|ISBN=978-35285-9-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Both communities have suffered from an unreliable water supply from streams and brooks that often dry up, and that are breeding grounds for malaria-carrying mosquitoes and sources of diseases such as cholera, diarrhea, dysentery, guinea worm, tape worm, and night blindness.

==History==
Manila was originally divided into two [[House of Representatives of the Philippines#District representation|representative districts]] from 1907 to 1949. When seats for the [[Senate of the Philippines|upper house]] of the [[Philippine Legislature]] were elected from territory-based districts between 1916 and 1935, the city formed part of the [[Senatorial districts of the Philippines#Fourth District|fourth senatorial district]] which elected two out of the 24-member senate.

In the disruption caused by the [[Second World War]], Manila was incorporated into the City of Greater Manila on January 1, 1942 through [[Manuel Quezon]]'s Executive Order No. 400 as a wartime emergency measure. Greater Manila was represented by [[#1943–1944|two delegates]] in the [[National Assembly of the Second Philippine Republic|National Assembly]] of the Japanese-sponsored [[Second Philippine Republic]]: one was the city mayor (an [[ex officio member|''ex officio'' member]]), while the other was elected through a citywide assembly of [[KALIBAPI]] members during the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]].

Upon the restoration of the [[Philippine Commonwealth]] in 1945, Manila's pre-war two-district representation was retained; this remained so until 1949. By virtue of the ''Revised Charter of the City of Manila'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Republic Act No. 409 |author=Congress of the Philippines |date=June 18, 1949 |accessdate=June 13, 2016 |url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno409.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; enacted on June 18, 1949, the city was divided into four congressional districts. The city elected four representatives from the [[Second Congress of the Philippines|2nd Congress]] up to the [[Seventh Congress of the Philippines|7th Congress]].

The city was represented in the [[Interim Batasang Pambansa]] as part of [[Interim Batasang Pambansa#Regional Representatives|Region IV]] from 1978 to 1984, and elected [[#1984–1986|six representatives]], at large, to the [[Regular Batasang Pambansa]] in [[Philippine parliamentary election, 1984|1984]].

Manila was reapportioned into six [[House of Representatives of the Philippines#District representation|congressional districts]] under the new Constitution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1987 Constitution of the Philippines - Apportionment Ordinance |url=http://www.gov.ph/constitutions/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines-ordinance/ |accessdate=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was proclaimed on February 11, 1987. It elected members to the restored House of Representatives starting [[Philippine legislative election, 1987|that same year]].

Nowadays, the liquor has adopted this name (and is no longer produced by using the containers pictured above).]] --&gt;
The following is a list of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]ic and non-alcoholic [[beverages]] that are popular among the people of [[Bolivia]]. [[Singani]] ( the Bolivian national drink) is the main [[liquor]] used to produce some of these mixed drinks. [[Pisco]] is  another liquor that is easily found in Bolivia, and is the main component of another branch of beverages  listed here.

==Singani-based==

* [[Chuflay]]
* Coctel de Tumbo
* [[Yungueño]]

==Pisco-based==
* [[Pisco Sour]] &amp;ndash; Also very popular in Chile, made from grapes and matured in wooden barrels.

==Illegal==
* Casquito &amp;ndash; A mix of pure alcohol and soft drink, mostly cola. It is often associated with poor people and prohibited due to its usage of pure alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;https://thesipadvisor.com/tag/cranberries/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://lordsofthedrinks.com/2015/05/08/fricase-a-spicy-pork-stew-from-bolivia-that-kills-all-hangovers/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-alcoholic==
* [[Mocochinchi]] &amp;ndash; Dehydrated peach cider
* Api (Morado) &amp;ndash; A maize drink, generally using purple maize but often mixed with white maize, one of them being hot.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boliviabella.com/api-morado.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* Somó &amp;ndash; Made from maize called “frangollo”.&lt;ref&gt;http://comosur.com/2014/11/07/a-locals-guide-to-drinking-on-the-streets-of-bolivia-es/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1913">The '''[[Roman Catholic]] Church in [[El Salvador]]''' (continental [[Central America]]) comprises only a Latin hierarchy, joint in the national [[episcopal conference]] (Conferencia Episcopal de El Salvador, CEDES), consisting of
* one [[ecclesiastical province]] headed by the Metropolitan [[archbishop]] (in the capital) with seven [[suffragan]] [[diocese]]s, each headed by a [[bishop]] 
* a [[military ordinariate]] for the military.

There are no Eastern Catholic or pre-diocesan jurisdictions.

There is also an [[Apostolic Nunciature]] to El Salvador, as papal diplomatic representation (embassy-level) in the national capital [[San Salvador]].

== Current Latin Dioceses ==

=== Exempt ===
* [[Military Ordinariate of El Salvador]] (Spanish: Obispado Castrense en El Salvador), a modern Army bishopric

=== Ecclesiastical province of San Salvador ===
* Metropolitan [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Salvador|Archdiocese of San Salvador]]
** [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Chalatenango]]

** [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Vicente]]
** [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Santa Ana]]
** [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Santiago de María]]
** [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sonsonate]]
** [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Zacatecoluca]]

== Defunct jurisdictions ==

An [[endangered language]] is a [[language]] that it is at risk of falling out of use, generally because it has few surviving speakers. If it loses all of its native speakers, it becomes an [[extinct language]]. [[UNESCO]] defines [[Endangered language#UNESCO definitions|four levels of language endangerment]] between "safe" (not endangered) and "extinct":&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;

[[North America]] is a [[continent]] in the [[Earth]]'s [[northern hemisphere]] and (chiefly) [[western hemisphere]]. It is bordered on the north by the [[Arctic Ocean]], on the east by the North [[Atlantic Ocean]], on the southeast by the [[Caribbean Sea]], and on the south and west by the North [[Pacific Ocean]]; [[South America]] lies to the southeast. It covers an [[area]] of about 24,709,000 square kilometers&lt;!--spelled out per WP:MOSNUM --&gt; (9,540,000 sq&amp;nbsp;mi), about 4.8% of the planet's surface or about 16.5% of its land area. As of July 2007, its [[population]] was estimated at nearly 524&amp;nbsp;million people.

Today, North America only has a total of 256 living languages. However, out of those 256 languages, 238 are in the realm of extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/region/NAM|title=Northern America|newspaper=Ethnologue|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, 92% of languages that are dying. The United States has the highest number of dying languages, 143 out of 219 languages,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/country/US/languages|title=United States|newspaper=Ethnologue|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; then Canada with 75 dying out of its 94 languages,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/country/CA|title=Canada|newspaper=Ethnologue|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lastly, Greenland has the smallest amount, 0 out of its two spoken languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/country/GL|title=Greenland|newspaper=Ethnologue|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article is a list of major '''[[pharmacy|pharmacies]]''' (also known as '''chemists''' and '''drugstores''') by country.
{{TOC right}}

==Australia==
&lt;!-- PLEASE DON'T ADD PHARMACIES THAT DO NOT HAVE ARTICLES. --&gt;

Pharmacies in Australia are mostly independently owned by [[pharmacists]], often operated as [[franchising|franchises]] of retail brands offered by the three major pharmaceutical wholesalers in Australia: [[Australian Pharmaceutical Industries]] (API) and [[Sigma Pharmaceuticals]]. A minority of pharmacies are owned by [[Friendly society|friendly societies]], particularly in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[South Australia]].

==China==
&lt;!-- PLEASE DON'T ADD PHARMACIES THAT DO NOT HAVE ARTICLES. --&gt;

The key players in the drugstore industry in China are:
*[[China Nepstar]] – Shenzhen-based; China's largest
*[[Super-Pharm]] – Israeli company; had about 65 stores in China as of 2007
*[[Watsons]]  – owned by HK-based Hutchison Whampoa

==Denmark==
&lt;!-- PLEASE DON'T ADD PHARMACIES THAT DO NOT HAVE ARTICLES. --&gt;

In Denmark, all pharmacies are owned by the [[Association of Danish Pharmacies]] and controlled by the state. There are two pharmaceutically trained groups with a [[higher education]] in the Danish pharmacies: [[pharmaconomist]]s ({{lang-da|farmakonomer}}) and [[pharmacist]]s ({{lang|da|farmaceuter}}). There are also [[pharmacy technician]]s ({{lang|da|defektricer}}) who have a [[vocational training]] and [[Laborer|unskilled laborers]]/[[Blue-collar worker|workers]] ({{lang|da|servicemedarbejdere}}) who perform [[manual labour]].

==Germany==
&lt;!-- PLEASE DON'T ADD PHARMACIES THAT DO NOT HAVE ARTICLES. --&gt;

Germany is the biggest pharmacy market in Europe with €35 billion, or $46 billion, of revenue each year. In Germany, pharmacies are known as "apotheken". Like France, they are all independently-owned by pharmacists, and like France, there are no pharmacy chains. In hindsight to consumer protection, German law bans chains of apotheken, but generally allows self-employed pharmacists to individually operate a maximum of four outlets, all of which must be in close proximity.

Other types of retailing are strongly opposed to offering the same types of services as an apotheke. These retailers would not have the necessary expertise to provide proper patient care and this has been upheld by the European Court of Justice in its ruling of May 2009. Traditionally in Germany, drugs were not discountable and the entire trade with pharmaceuticals was limited to the single channel of the Apotheke. In 2004 however, the health care reform law GMG ([[:de:GKV-Modernisierungsgesetz]]) allowed free pricing of [[Over-the-counter drug|OTC]] products. This led to a significant decrease of OTC prices in competitive areas. Internet and mail-order purchasing of drugs has also become an alternative, but only accounts for about 5% of German pharmaceutical trade.

Online pharmacy [[Celesio#2003 onwards|DocMorris]] has been introducing the first licence based [[chain pharmacy]] model in Germany in 2007 (as opposed to the current [[independent pharmacy]] model). Alongside their brand, they are offering standardized services in their pharmacies, whilst they do not operate or own them. They also offer discounted OTC products. Besides this model, German pharmacies are for the most part organized in [[wholesaler]]-based cooperations like [[LINDA (cooperative)|LINDA]], {{Interlanguage link multi|gesund leben-Apotheken|de}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|meine apotheke|de}} or [[vivesco]]. These cooperations are offering discounts in purchasing and support e.g. in marketing.

Many pharmacy chains in the United States are owned and operated by regional [[supermarket]] brands, or national [[big-box store]] brands such as [[Walmart]]. These pharmacies are located within their larger chain stores. The three largest free-standing pharmacy chains in the United States are [[Walgreens]], [[CVS Pharmacy|CVS]], and [[Rite Aid]].

Although not a pharmacy chain, many of the fairly ubiquitous Costco stores include a pharmacy and - in California at least - the pharmacy is available to non-members.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17083">The [[music of Australia]] and most particularly the [[Rock music|rock]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[Hip hop]] and [[indie rock]] music of Australia has had a long fascination with the local environment be it urban or rural. This is a list of songs which mention or are about [[Melbourne]] the capital city of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Australia, the suburbs of Melbourne and nearby locations. In 2004, an article by Michael Dwyer published in ''[[The Age]]'' discussed songs written about Melbourne. A list of twenty-five songs about Melbourne were also published.&lt;ref name=Dwyer&gt;{{cite news

'''Location intelligence''' ('''LI'''), or '''spatial intelligence''', is the process of deriving meaningful insight from [[geographic data and information|geospatial data]] relationships to solve a particular problem.&lt;ref&gt;Data Resources For Real Estate And Business Geography Analysis. Thrall,G.,I.,Ph.D.(2009)/Professor, Department of Geography, College of Liberal Arts And Sciences and Miller Center For Retail, College of Business, University of Florida&lt;/ref&gt; It involves layering multiple data sets spatially and/or chronologically, for easy reference on a map, and its applications span industries, categories and organizations.

Maps have been used to represent information throughout the ages, but what might be referenced as the first example of true location 'intelligence' was in London in 1854 when [[John Snow]] was able to debunk theories about the spread of cholera by overlaying a map of the area with the location of water pumps and was able to narrow the source to a single water pump. This layering of information over a map was able to identify relationships between different sets of geospatial data.

Location or [[geographical information  system]] (GIS) tools enable spatial experts to collect, store, [[data analysis|analyze]] and [[data visualization|visualize data]]. Location intelligence experts can use a variety of spatial and business analytical tools to measure optimal locations for operating a business or providing a service. Location intelligence experts begin with defining the [[business ecosystem]] which has many interconnected economic influences. Such economic influences include but are not limited to culture, lifestyle, labor, healthcare, cost of living, crime, economic climate and education.

==Further definitions==
The term "location intelligence" is often used to describe the people, data and technology employed to geographically "map" information. These mapping applications can transform large amounts of data into color-coded visual representations that make it easy to see trends and generate meaningful intelligence. The creation of location intelligence is directed by [[domain knowledge]], formal frameworks, and a focus on decision support. Location cuts across through everything i.e. devices, platforms, software and apps, and is one of the most important ingredient of understanding context in sync with social data, mobile data, user data, sensor data.

Location intelligence is also used to describe the integration of a geographical component into [[business intelligence]] processes and tools, often incorporating [[spatial database]] and spatial [[OLAP]] tools.

In 2012, Wayne Gearey from the [[real estate industry]] ([[JLL (company)|JLL]]) offered the first applied course on location intelligence at the University of Texas at Dallas in which he defined location intelligence as the process for selecting the optimal location that will support workplace success and address a variety of business and financial objectives.&lt;ref name="RealViews 2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jllrealviews.com/trends/why-location-intelligence-is-a-game-changer-for-the-property-industry/|title=Why location intelligence is a ‘game changer’ for real estate|last=Avery|first=Lois|date=2015-05-20|website=RealViews|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019164338/https://www.jllrealviews.com/trends/why-location-intelligence-is-a-game-changer-for-the-property-industry/|archive-date=2016-10-19|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=W.M. Gearey, N.M.Trodd, A. Fobes|title=Utilizing Location Intelligence for the Placement of Corporate Services|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_401758_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pitney Bowes]] MapInfo Corporation describes location intelligence as follows: "Spatial information, commonly known as "Location", relates to involving, or having the nature of where. Spatial is not constrained to a geographic location however most common business uses of spatial information deal with how spatial information is tied to a location on the earth. Miriam-Webster® defines Intelligence as "The ability to learn or understand, or the ability to apply knowledge to manipulate one`s environment." Combining these terms alludes to how you achieve an understanding of the spatial aspect of information and apply it to achieve a significant competitive advantage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=George Moon |publisher=Pitney Bowes |url=http://www.pbinsight.com/files/resource-library/resource-files/LocationIntell_WP_2-27Final.pdf |format=PDF |language=en |title=Location Intelligence – Meeting IT Expectation |date=c. 2008 |access-date=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Definition by [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] is as follows: "Location Intelligence is defined as the capacity to organize and understand complex data through the use of geographic relationships. LI organizes business and geographically referenced data to reveal the relationship of location to people, events, transactions, facilities, and assets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=ESRI |url=https://www.esri.com/~/media/files/pdfs/library/whitepapers/pdfs/using-location-intelligence.pdf |format=PDF |language=en |title=Using Location Intelligence to Maximize the Value of BI |access-date=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Definition by [[Yankee Group]] within their White Paper "Location Intelligence in Retail Banking: "...a business management term that refers to spatial data visualization, contextualization and analytical capabilities applied to solve a business problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Marcus Torchia |publisher=Pitney Bowes |url=http://www.pbinsight.com/files/resource-library/resource-files/yankee-group.pdf |format=PDF |language=en |title=Location Intelligence in Retail Banking |date=c. 2009 |access-date=2015-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Near (company)|Near]] defines location intelligence as the gamut of geo-spatial analytic models, algorithms, techniques and tools that harness location-indexed streaming and static data to provide requisite answers to questions around location such as the attributes of i) a place, ii) people visiting a place, and iii) products consumed at a place. Location intelligence platforms encapsulate these technologies, ingest relevant data sources, and provide it as data-as-a-service, or use it to power data-driven products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmaglobal.com/articles/location-intelligence-next-frontier |title= Location Intelligence: The Next Frontier|publisher=Mobile Marketing Association, Inc|date=May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instarea defines location intelligence as "Using [[machine learning]] algorithms to uncover trends that would be otherwise unknown using human based rules in a large location data set."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/3795764|title=Market Trends: Ways CSPs Can Exploit Location Data|last=|first=|date=|website=Gartner.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial applications==

'''Martakert Province''' ({{lang-hy|Մարտակերտ}}) is a [[Administrative divisions of the Republic of Artsakh|province]] of the ''de facto'' [[Republic of Artsakh]]. The Republic has [[Political status of Nagorno-Karabakh|limited international recognition]]. It is ''de jure'' part of the Republic of [[Azerbaijan]]. The population is mainly Armenian. Martakert Province has 43 communities of which 1 is considered urban and 42 are rural.

== Cultural sites==
The [[Gandzasar monastery]], the [[Yeghishe Arakyal Monastery]] and the 17th century Armenian monastery [[Yerits Mankants]] are located in this province. The [[Vankasar Monastery]] is just outside the town of [[Aghdara (town)|Martakert]]. The archaeological site of the town of [[Tigranakert of Artsakh|Tigranakert]] is also located here. Thought to have been founded in the 2nd-1st century B.C, it has been undergoing excavation since 2005. Some of the walls of the city, with Hellenistic-style towers, as well as Armenian basilica dating to fifth to seventh centuries have been uncovered.

'''Minette''' is a type of mineral deposit, consisting of [[iron ore]] of [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] origin, found in the south of [[Luxembourg]] and in [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]]. Minette ore was deposited in the [[Early Jurassic]] and [[Middle Jurassic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hallam, Anthony]]. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=TUGq5n2lxkoC&amp;dq= Jurassic Environments]''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975. p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The term "Minette" came from French miners. It is a diminutive form of "la mine", and might be translated as "little mine, little colliery" or "little vein", referring to its relatively poor iron content of between 28% and 34%.&lt;ref name="Merriam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/minette|title=minette|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other uses, "Minette" is also an archaic rock term used to locally describe a particular type of [[lamprophyre]].&lt;ref name="Merriam" /&gt;

==History==

The deposit is one of the largest iron reserves in the world. The reserves have been estimated at 6 billion tons, with an iron content of 2 billion tons. The phosphorus content of Minette rendered its industrial processing impossible for a long time, which changed with the introduction of the [[Sidney Gilchrist Thomas|Thomas]]-[[Percy Gilchrist|Gilchrist]] procedure.

After the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870-1871, large parts of Lorraine were annexed by Germany. The borders were determined such that much of the known Minette reserves were in German territory. The geologist [[Wilhelm Hauchecorne]], a member of the border commission, had argued for this.&lt;ref name="Frühauf"&gt;{{cite book|last=Frühauf|first=Helmut|title=Eisenindustrie und Steinkohlenbergbau im Raum Neunkirchen / Saar|publisher= Zentralausschuss für deutsche Landeskunde|location=Trier|year=1980|series=Forschungen zur deutschen Landeskunde|volume=217|isbn=3-88143-010-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the German authorities awarded significantly more mining concessions than the French had, iron ore production hardly increased until 1879. This changed in the 1880s, due to a greater number of railway lines in the Minette area and the construction of a railway line from [[Thionville]] in France to [[Völklingen]] in Germany, which from 1883 enabled a direct link with the [[Saarland]] industrial area.&lt;ref name="Frühauf" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van de Kerkhof|first=Stefanie|title=Die Industrialisierung europäischer Montanregionen im 19. Jahrhundert|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JgMGm3lZpgkC&amp;lpg=PA267&amp;dq=Minette%20Lothringen&amp;pg=PA269#v=onepage&amp;q=Minette%20Lothringen&amp;f=false|editor=Toni Pierenkemper|chapter=Die Industrialisierung der lothringisch-luxemburgischen Minette-Region|year=2002|publisher=Steiner|location=Stuttgart|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Explorations in the 1880s showed that the Minette reserves reached further to the West than had previously been assumed, and increased in volume and iron content the deeper they went. By 1909, 16 mines had been dug in the French part of Lorraine, the département [[Meurthe-et-Moselle]], especially in the basin of [[Briey]], which mined Minette through mine shafts.

After [[World War I]], Lorraine belonged completely to France again. In 1919, yearly production went over 41 million tons, 21 million tons of these in the département Moselle and 20 million tons in the département Meurthe-et-Moselle. Lorraine was, after the United States, the second-largest iron producer in the world. The high point of ore production was reached with 62 million tons in France and 6 million tons in Luxembourg in 1960. Currently, after 150 years of mining, approximately 3 billion tons of ore have been produced. The relatively low iron content, however, meant that Lotharingian Minette-ore was successively replaced by more highly concentrated imported ores (with iron contents around 60%). As a consequence, more and more mins were closed down. The last pit in Luxembourg, [[Differdange]], closed in 1981, the last French one, at [[Audun-le-Tiche]] in the Moselle department did so in 1997.

'''Nations: A Simulation Game in International Politics''' is a case study available from the [[Georgetown University]] Institute for the Study of Diplomacy. In the game, students are divided into countries, and they compete against other by trading resources and making treaties. The game takes place on the fictional continent of Lostralia. The students are provided with rules. Each country has resources and secrets. Each country has a series of problems that they must solve and a certain amount of resources that they must get.

==Setting==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Lostralia.jpg|thumb|A map of Lostralia]] --&gt;
The game is set on the fictional continent of Lostralia. It consists of seven countries and a neutral zone. The seven states are Spartonia, Bampff, Holy Zott, Pyrote, Libertania, Zamboni, and Crock. Each of the countries have specified resources, cities, and problems. Lostralia is fraught with diplomatic issues and players that all dominate in varying fields: Spartonia-military, Pyrote-religious, Crock-diplomatic, Zamboni-food, and Libertania-freedom.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Lostralia is known for its problems, but also for its ability to overcome them, much like the real world had done between [[World War I]] and the end of the [[Cold War]].

'''Natural landscaping''', also called '''native gardening''', is the use of [[native plants]], including [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s, [[groundcover]], and [[grasses]] which are [[endemic (ecology)|indigenous]] to the geographic area of the garden. 

[[Image:Natural Landcaping01.jpg|thumb|right|Natural landscaping with pine [[leaf litter]] mulch]]

==Benefits==

===Maintenance===
Natural landscaping is adapted to the [[climate]], [[geography]] and [[hydrology]] and should require no [[pesticide]]s, [[fertilizer]]s and watering to maintain, given that native plants have [[adaptation|adapted]] and evolved to local conditions over thousands of years.&lt;ref name=Art/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tallamy, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; However, these applications may be necessary for some preventive care of trees and other vegetation in areas of degraded or [[invasive weed|weedy landscapes]].

Native plants suit today's interest in "low-maintenance" gardening and landscaping, with many species vigorous and hardy and able to survive winter cold and summer heat. Once established, they can flourish without irrigation or fertilization, and are resistant to most pests and diseases.

Many [[municipality|municipalities]] have quickly recognized the benefits of natural landscaping due to [[government budget|municipal budget]] constraints and reductions and the [[general public]] is now benefiting from the implementation of natural landscaping techniques to save water and create more personal time.

===Ecology and habitat===
[[Image:Banksia spinulosa claret styles Georges River NP email.jpg|thumb|''[[Banksia spinulosa]]'', a [[Sydney, Australia]] local plant which attracts wildlife]]
Native plants provide suitable habitat for native species of butterflies, birds, [[pollinator]]s, and other wildlife.  They provide more variety in gardens by offering myriad alternatives to the often planted [[introduced species]], [[cultivar]]s, and [[invasive species]]. The indigenous plants have co-evolved with animals, fungi and microbes, to form a complex network of relationships. They are the foundation of their native [[habitat]]s and [[ecosystem]]s, or natural communities.&lt;ref name=Tallamy/&gt;

Such gardens often benefit from the plants being evolved and habituated to the local climate, pests and herbivores, and soil conditions, and so may require fewer to no [[soil amendments]], [[irrigation]], [[pesticide]]s, and [[herbicide]]s for a beautiful, lower maintenance, and more [[Sustainable design|sustainable]] landscape.

====Habitat challenges====
However, while local [[provenance]] plants have adapted to local conditions (which includes climate, soil, and other native plants and animals), there will often be instances, especially in cities, where one or more of these will have been radically altered.

Examples include:
*Building rubble used as landfill may raise soil pH (i.e. create [[alkaline]] soil), which can be problematic in regions of acidic soils (with local plants adapted to acid soils).
*Buildings cast a substantial shade, this may give rise to conditions substantially shadier than needed by local plants.
*Soil which is high in organic material and nutrients is often introduced into gardens, or many gardeners will have used [[fertilizer]]s. Plants from some areas may not thrive under these conditions. For example, many Australian plants are particularly sensitive to phosphorus.
*Many native plants are adapted to, and benefit from, periodic [[wildfires]] that occurred before and during pre-modern settlement. These fires can be simulated in the garden by either "high mowing" or a [[controlled burn]] every few years.

Many [[weed]]s in an area are usually the result of imported plants. These plants become invasive because there are no natural controls such as disease, weather, or fauna in their new environment. They take over native habitats, reducing shelter and food for local fauna. Using local provenance plants increases the [[biodiversity]] of and is important for the health of a region's overall [[ecology]]. 

Much of the wild areas have been destroyed to make room for [[Urban sprawl|urban development]].  Housing developments have replaced native habitats with [[ornamental plant]]s and [[lawn]]s, pushing the [[wildland-urban interface]] further out.  While development won't be stopped, gardeners can keep wild areas and green spaces filled with native species on their lots and in their communities.

Despite this, there are usually plenty of indigenous or native plants which will grow and thrive in the area one is trying to establish a native garden.

== Types ==

===In general===
Native gardens include the following kinds:

* Fully [[forest]]ed with [[plant litter|leaf debris]] on the [[forest floor]], including [[coarse woody debris]] if possible;
* [[Desert]] with arid loving plants and succulents;
* Grassy [[meadow]] with a variety of [[wildflowers]] and water features;
* Lowland [[savanna]] with grasses and native trees; and
* Oceanic [[dunescape]] with tall, salt tolerant grasses.

===Wildflower gardens===
"Wildflower" in some nations denominates the numerous showy flowers from some drier climates, most notably southwest [[Western Australia]], southern [[Africa]], and [[North America]].

Some wildflower gardens attempt to recreate a [[prairie]], including native [[grass]]es along with flowering plants, i. e. [[forb]]s. Such gardens benefit the local wildlife, often attracting [[bird]]s, [[butterfly|butterflies]], and small [[mammal]]s. By carefully choosing the plants for the garden, some of these animals can be encouraged to visit the garden. One popular type of wildflower garden specializes in attracting butterflies and is thus denominated a "[[butterfly garden]]".

The native plants cultivated in wildflower gardens often have deep [[root]]s, and therefore are effective selections for absorbing [[surface runoff]] and allowing the water to infiltrate into the local [[water table]].&lt;ref name="Steiner and Domm"/&gt; Wildflower gardens cultivated for capturing runoff in this mode are denominated "rain gardens".

===Rain gardens===
[[Rain garden]]s absorb rainwater from gutters &amp; [[impervious surface]]s and function much better when planted with native plants which tolerate the alternation of flooding and drying.

== Advantages ==
* no fertilization required
* no additional water
* more water available for other uses and other people
* zero to near zero work needed for maintenance
* no lawn mowing
* erosion reduced to a minimum
* natural landscaped plants take full advantage of rainfall
* when water restrictions are implemented, natural landscaped plants will survive, while more traditional plants may not
* increased habitat for native flora and fauna
* increased beneficial insect population reduces pests
* where heavily forested, provides shade on homes and businesses saving energy
* native plants rarely become invasive

== Disadvantages ==
* not good for outdoor games that require a manicured turf.
* increased wild animal intrusion
* in certain areas, wildfires or brushfires may be of great concern.
* may look less attractive due to reduced available range of plants to choose from.
* may be hard to find native plants which produce adequate quantities of edible matter.

== Effect of new construction ==
In new construction, builders can either avoid [[clear cutting]] or clearing an entire property and disturbing other large flora or builders can completely clear an area of all flora to save construction time and replace the clearing with juvenile specimens once the job is complete. The downside to this is additional costs involved with purchasing replacements. The builder may also choose to plant additional native trees and other flora after construction to help the property blend with natural surroundings.

In some [[private community|planned developments]], natural landscaping is the requirement. Builders may not remove trees larger than a specific diameter and owners may not arbitrarily cut trees without a permit.

== Land reclamation ==
Throughout the world, forested areas were turned into [[cattle]] [[grazing]] or [[Farmland (farming)|farmland]]. Often this land is then turned into residential or commercial use property. By returning the land back to its original state prior to human disturbance, vast amounts of energy usage and increasing pollution can be reduced. Natural landscaping costs less to install than traditional landscaping and, after the initial few years, reduces maintenance costs, combats [[erosion]], and accommodates storm and flood waters better.

==Native plant societies==
In many parts of the world there are societies, clubs or local groups, such as [[Bushcare Group|Bushcare]] or [[Association of Societies for Growing Australian Plants|ASGAP]] in Australia, the [[North American Native Plant Society]], or the [[California Native Plant Society]], which are made up of gardeners interested in growing plants local to their area, state or country. In the United States, Wild Ones--Native Plants, Natural Landscapes &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildones.org]&lt;/ref&gt; is a national organization with local chapters in many states. New England Wildflower Society,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newfs.org New England Wildflower Society]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildflower.org Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center]&lt;/ref&gt; provide information on native plants and promote natural landscaping.  These organizations can be the best resources for learning about and obtaining local native plants. Many members have spent years or decades cultivating local plants or bushwalking in local areas.

[[File:03242012Taller sostenibilidad lore037.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Rainwater capture and storage system at the [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Mexico City]]]]
'''Rainwater harvesting''' is the accumulation and storage of rainwater for reuse on-site, rather than allowing it to run off.

== History of rain water harvesting ==

The construction and use of [[cistern]]s to store rainwater can be traced back to the [[Neolithic|Neolithic Age]], when waterproof lime plaster cisterns were built in the floors of houses in village locations of the [[Levant]], a large area in Southwest Asia, south of the [[Taurus Mountains]], bound by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in the west, the [[Arabian Desert]] in the south, and [[Mesopotamia]] in the east. By the late 4000 BC, cisterns were essential elements of emerging water management techniques used in [[dry-land farming]].&lt;ref name=":74"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mays |first=Larry |last2=Antoniou |first2=George |date=21 November 2013 |title=History of Water Cisterns: Legacies and Lessons |url= |journal=Water - Open Access Journal |volume= |pages= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many ancient cisterns have been discovered in Jerusalem and the entire Land of Israel. At the site believed by some to be that of the biblical city of Ai (Khirbet et-Tell), a large cistern dating back to around 2500 BC was discovered that had a capacity of nearly {{Convert|1,700|m3|cuft|abbr=on}}. It was carved out of solid rock, lined with large stones, and sealed with clay to keep from leaking.&lt;ref name=":74"/&gt;

[[File:Chidambaram_Nataraja_temple_Shivaganga_tank_porch.jpg|thumb|Shivaganga Tank in Tamil Nadu]]
The Greek island of [[Crete]] is also known for its use of large cisterns for rainwater collection and storage during the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] period from 2,600 BC - 1,100 BC. Four large cisterns have been discovered at [[Myrtos Pyrgos|Myrtos–Pyrgos]], [[Archanes]], and Zakroeach. The cistern found at Myrtos-Pyrgos was found to have a capacity of more than 80 m3 and date back to 1700 BC.&lt;ref name=":74"/&gt;

Around 300 BCE, farming communities in [[Balochistan]] (now located in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran), and [[Kutch]], India, used rainwater harvesting for agriculture and many other uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tn.gov.in/dtp/rainwater.htm |title=Rain water Harvesting |work= |publisher=[[Tamil Nadu State Government]], India |accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; rainwater harvesting was done by [[Chola dynasty|Chola kings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2010/07/17/stories/2010071754460800.htm |title=Believes in past, lives in future |date=17 July 2010 |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |accessdate= |location=India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rainwater from the [[Brihadeeswarar temple]] (located in Balaganpathy Nagar, [[Thanjavur]], India) was collected in Shivaganga tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/2003/08/04/stories/2003080402510500.htm |title=Rare Chola inscription found near Big Temple |date=24 August 2003 |newspaper=The Hindu |accessdate= |location=India}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the later Chola period, the Vīrānam tank was built (1011 to 1037 CE) in the Cuddalore district of [[Tamil Nadu]] to store water for drinking and irrigation purposes. Vīrānam is a 16-km-long tank with a storage capacity of {{Convert|1,465,000,000|cuft|m3|abbr=on}}.

Rainwater harvesting was also common in the [[Roman Empire]]. While Roman Aqueducts are well-known, [[List of Roman cisterns|Roman cisterns]] were also commonly used and their construction expanded with the Empire.&lt;ref name=":74"/&gt; For example, in Pompeii, rooftop water storage was common before the construction of [[Aqua Augusta (Naples)|the Aqueduct]] in the 1st century BC.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://archserve.id.ucsb.edu/courses/arthistory/152k/water.html |title=Water Supply Systems: Cisterns, Reservoirs, Aqueducts {{!}} Roman Building Technology and Architecture, University of California Santa Barbara |website=ArchServe |language=en-US |access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This history continued with the Byzantine Empire, for example the [[Basilica Cistern]] in Istanbul.

Though little-known, for centuries the town of Venice depended on rainwater harvesting. The lagoon which surrounds Venice is brackish water, which is not suitable for drinking. The ancient inhabitants of Venice established a system of rainwater collection which was based on man-made insulated collection wells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.venicebackstage.org/en/159/i-pozzi-veneziani|title=Venetian wells}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water percolated down the specially designed stone flooring, and was filtered by a layer of sand, then collected at the bottom of the well. Later, as Venice acquired territories on the mainland, it started to import water by boat from local rivers, but the wells remained in use, and were especially important in time of war when access to the mainland water could be blocked by an enemy.

=== Current uses ===

==== Canada ====

{{Main|Rainwater harvesting in Canada}}

A number of Canadians have started implementing rainwater harvesting systems for use in stormwater reduction, irrigation, laundry, and lavatory plumbing. Substantial reform to Canadian law since the mid-2000s has increased the use of this technology in agricultural, industrial, and residential use, but ambiguity remains amongst legislation in many provinces. Bylaws and local municipal codes often regulate rainwater harvesting.

==== India ====

* [[Tamil Nadu]] was the first state to make rainwater harvesting compulsory for every building to avoid [[Overdrafting|groundwater depletion]]. The scheme was launched in 2001 and has been implemented in all rural areas of Tamil Nadu. Posters all over Tamil Nadu including rural areas create awareness about harvesting rainwater [http://www.tn.gov.in/dtp/rainwater.htm TN Govt site]. It gave excellent results within five years, and slowly every state took it as a role model. Since its implementation, [[Chennai]] had a 50% rise in water level in five years and the water quality significantly improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tamil-nadu-praised-for-its-good-rainwater-harvesting-model/article2495647.ece |title=Tamil Nadu praised as role model for Rainwater Harvesting |journal=The Hindu |date=2011-09-29 |accessdate=2012-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Karnataka]]: In [[Bangalore]], adoption of rainwater harvesting is mandatory for every owner or the occupier of a building having the site area measuring {{Convert|60|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} × {{Convert|40|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} and above and for newly constructed building measuring {{Convert|30|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} × {{Convert|40|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} and above dimensions. In this regard, [[Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board]] has initiated and constructed “Rain Water Harvesting Theme Park” in the name of Sir [[M. Visvesvaraya]] in {{Convert|1.2|acre|m2|abbr=on}} of land situated at [[Jayanagar, Bangalore]]. In this park, 26 different type of rainwater harvesting models are demonstrated along with the water conservation tips.

* [[Maharashtra]]: At present, in [[Pune]], rainwater harvesting is compulsory for any new housing society to be registered.
* In [[Mumbai]], [[Maharashtra]], rainwater harvesting is being considered as a good solution to solve the water crisis.

The Mumbai City council is planning to make rainwater harvesting mandatory for large societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mid-day.com/articles/bmc-to-make-rainwater-harvesting-mandatory-for-large-societies/17110192 |title=BMC to make rainwater harvesting mandatory for large societies|date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Israel ====

The Southwest Center for the Study of Hospital and Healthcare Systems in cooperation with Rotary International is sponsoring a rainwater harvesting model program across the country. The first rainwater catchment system was installed at an elementary school in Lod, Israel. The project is looking to expand to Haifa in its third phase. The Southwest Center has also partnered with the Water Resources Action Project of Washington, DC, which currently has rainwater harvesting projects in the West Bank.   Rainwater harvesting systems are being installed in local schools for the purpose of educating schoolchildren about water conservation principles and bridging divides between people of different religious and ethnic backgrounds, all while addressing the [[water scarcity]] issue that the Middle East faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/rainwater-collection-system-saves-water-money-for-schools-1.8233 |title=Rainwater Collection System Saves Water, Money for Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== New Zealand ====

Although New Zealand has plentiful rainfall in the West and South, for much of the country, rainwater harvesting is the normal practice for most rural housing and is encouraged by most councils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gw.govt.nz/rainwater-tanks// |title=Rainwater tanks |date=28 April 2016 |publisher=Greater Wellington Regional Council |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414164122/http://www.gw.govt.nz/rainwater-tanks// |archivedate=14 April 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |access-date=21 March 2017 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sri Lanka ====

Rainwater harvesting has been a popular method of obtaining water for agriculture and for drinking purposes in rural homes. The legislation to promote rainwater harvesting was enacted through the Urban Development Authority (Amendment) Act, No. 36 of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lankarainwater.org/rwhsl/act_36_2007_e.pdf |title=Parliament Of The Democratic Socialist  Republic of Sri Lanka}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lanka rainwater harvesting forum&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lankarainwater.org/ |title=Lanka Rain Water Harvesting forum (LRWHF)}}&lt;/ref&gt; is leading the Sri Lanka's initiative.

==== South Africa ====

The South African Water Research Commission has supported research into rainwater harvesting. Reports on this research are available on their "Knowledge Hub".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wrc.org.za/Pages/KH_DocumentsList.aspx?dt=1&amp;su=8&amp;ct=2&amp;ms=4;7; |title=Rainwater harvesting |website=www.wrc.org.za |publisher=South African Water Research Commission |accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies in arid, semiarid, and humid regions have confirmed that techniques such as mulching, pitting, ridging, and modified run-on plots are effective for small-scale crop production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.wrc.org.za/Knowledge%20Hub%20Documents/Research%20Reports/1465-1-11.pdf |title=Sustainable techniques and practices for water harvesting and conservation and their effective application in resource-poor agricultural production through participatory adaptive research : report to the Water Research Commission |vauthors=Everson C, Everson TM, Modi AT, Csiwila D, Fanadzo M, Naiken V, Auerbach RM, Moodley M, Mtshali SM, Dladla R |date=2011 |publisher=Water Research Commission |isbn=978-1-4312-0185-3 |location=Gezina [South Africa] |page=89 |accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hydraulic fracturing|hydrofracturing]] has regularly been used to improve the performance of water [[boreholes]].

==== United Kingdom ====

{{Main|Rainwater harvesting in the United Kingdom}}

In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Rainwater tank|water butts]] are often found in domestic gardens and on [[Allotment (gardening)|allotments]] to collect rainwater, which is then used to water the garden. However, the British government's [[Code For Sustainable Homes]] encouraged fitting large underground tanks to newly built homes to collect rainwater for flushing toilets, watering, and washing. Ideal designs had the potential to reduce demand on mains water supply by half. The code was revoked in 2015.

==== Other countries ====

* In China, Argentina, and Brazil, [[wikiversity:Rainwater harvesting/Rooftop rainwater harvesting|rooftop rainwater harvesting]] is being practiced for providing drinking water, domestic water, water for livestock, water for small irrigation, and a way to replenish groundwater levels. [[Gansu]] province in China and semiarid [[Northeast Region, Brazil|northeast Brazil]] have the largest rooftop rainwater harvesting projects going on.
* [[Thailand]] has the largest fraction of the population in the rural area relying on rainwater harvesting (currently around 40%).&lt;ref name="JMP 2016"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.wssinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/resources/Thailand.xls/ |title=Joint Monitoring Programme Thailand Data |last=JMP |date=2016 |website= |language=en-gb |access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rainwater harvesting was promoted heavily by the government in the 1980s. In the 1990s, after government funding for the collection tanks ran out, the private sector stepped in and provided several million tanks to private households, many of which continue to be used.&lt;ref name="saladin20162"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://rural-water-supply.net/en/resources/details/759 |title=Rainwater Harvesting in Thailand - learning from the World Champions |last=Saladin |first=Matthias |date=2016 |website= |language=en-gb |access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the largest examples of [[Self-supply of water and sanitation|self-supply of water]] worldwide.

A Dutch invention called the [[Groasis Waterboxx]] is also useful for growing trees with harvested and stored dew and rainwater.

Traditionally, stormwater management using [[detention basins]] served a single purpose. However, [[OptiRTC|optimized real-time control]] lets this infrastructure double as a source of rainwater harvesting without compromising the existing detention capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.high-profile.com/rainwater-harvesting-controls-in-cloud-by-steve-roy-marcus-quigley-and-chuck-raymond/ |title=Rainwater Harvesting - Controls in the Cloud |work=SmartPlanet |accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been used in the [[EPA]] headquarters to evacuate stored water prior to storm events, thus reducing wet weather flow while ensuring water availability for later reuse.

Generally, [[check dam]]s are constructed across the streams to enhance the percolation of surface water into the [[subsoil]] strata. The water percolation in the water-impounded area of the check dams can be enhanced artificially manyfold by loosening the subsoil strata and [[overburden]] using [[ANFO]] explosives as used in [[open cast mining]]. Thus, local [[aquifer]]s can be recharged quickly using the available surface water fully for use in the dry season.

=== Nontraditional ===

In 1992, American artist [[Michael Jones McKean]] created an artwork in Omaha, Nebraska, at the [[Bemis Center for Contemporary Art]] that created a fully sustainable rainbow in the Omaha skyline.

=== Rainwater harvesting by freshwater-flooded forests ===

[[File:Ratargul, Sylhet.jpg|thumb|[[Ratargul Swamp Forest|Ratagul Freshwater Flooded Forest]], [[Bangladesh]]]]
Rainwater harvesting is possible by growing [[Freshwater swamp forest|freshwater-flooded forests]] without losing the income from the used, submerged land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/58789361/Rain-Water-Harvesting-by-Freshwater-Flooded-Forests |title=Rain Water Harvesting by Freshwater Flooded Forests}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main purpose of the rainwater harvesting is to use the locally available rainwater to meet water requirements throughout the year without the need of huge capital expenditure. This would facilitate the availability of uncontaminated water for domestic, industrial, and irrigation needs.

=== Rainwater harvesting by solar power panels ===

Good quality water resource, closer to populated areas, is becoming scarce and costly for the consumers. In addition to solar and wind energy, rain water is major [[renewable resource]] of any land. Vast area is being covered by [[Photovoltaics|solar PV panels]] every year in all parts of the world. Solar panels can also be used for harvesting most of the rain water falling on them and drinking quality water, free from bacteria and suspended matter, can be generated by simple [[Water purification|filtration and disinfection]] processes as rain water is very low in [[salinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.windpowerengineering.com/environmental/wind-solar-powered-offgridbox-useful-hurricane-passes/ |title=Rain fed solar powered water purification systems. |accessdate=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://cleantechnica.com/2017/12/04/inverted-umbrella-brings-clean-water-clean-power-india/ |title=Inverted Umbrella Brings Clean Water &amp; Clean Power To India |accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=inh&gt;{{cite web |url=https://inhabitat.com/new-rooftop-solar-hydropanels-harvest-drinking-water-and-energy-at-the-same-time/  |title=New rooftop solar hydro panels harvest drinking water and energy at the same time |accessdate=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exploitation of rain water for value added products like bottled drinking water, makes solar PV power plants profitable even in high rainfall/ cloudy areas by the augmented income from value added drinking water generation.

== Advantages ==

Rainwater harvesting provide the independent water supply during regional water restrictions, and in developed countries, is often used to supplement the main supply. It provides water when a drought occurs, can help mitigate flooding of low-lying areas, and reduces demand on wells which may enable groundwater levels to be sustained. It also helps in the availability of potable water, as rainwater is substantially free of salinity and other salts. Applications of rainwater harvesting in [[Integrated urban water management|urban water system]] provides a substantial benefit for both [[water supply]] and [[wastewater]] subsystems by reducing the need for [[clean water]] in water distribution systems, less generated [[stormwater]] in [[sewer system]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Behzadian |first=k |last2=Kapelan |first2=Z |date=2015 |title=Advantages of integrated and sustainability based assessment for metabolism based strategic planning of urban water systems |url= |journal=Science of the Total Environment |publisher=Elsevier |volume=527-528 |pages=220–231 |doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.04.097 |pmid= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a reduction in stormwater runoff polluting freshwater bodies.

A large body of work has focused on the development of life cycle assessment and its costing methodologies to assess the level of environmental impacts and money that can be saved by implementing rainwater harvesting systems.&lt;ref name=inh/&gt;

=== Independent water supply ===

Rainwater harvesting provides an independent water supply during water restrictions. In areas where clean water is costly, or difficult to come by, rainwater harvesting is a critical source of clean water. In developed countries, rainwater is often harvested to be used as a supplemental source of water rather than a main source, but the harvesting of rainwater can also decrease a household's water costs or overall usage levels.Rainwater is safe to drink. Rainwater is also independent of salinity or pollutants found in ground water, increasing the quantity of portable drinking water available when rainwater harvesting is utilized.

=== Supplemental in drought ===

When drought occurs, rainwater harvested in past months can be used. If rain is unpredictable, the use of a rainwater harvesting system can be critical to capturing the rain when it does fall. Many countries, especially those with arid environments, use rainwater harvesting as a cheap and reliable source of clean water. To enhance [[irrigation]] in arid environments, ridges of soil are constructed to trap and prevent rainwater from running down hills and slopes. Even in periods of low [[rainfall]], enough water is collected for crops to grow. Water can be collected from roofs, dams and ponds can be constructed to hold large quantities of [[rainwater]] so that even on days when little to no rainfall occurs, enough is available to irrigate crops.

In addition, rainwater harvesting decreases the demand for water from wells, enabling groundwater levels to be further sustained rather than depleted.

=== Life-cycle assessment ===

[[Life-cycle assessment]] is a methodology used to evaluate the environmental impacts of a system from cradle-to-grave of its lifetime. Devkota et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Devkota |first1=J. |last2=Schlachter |first2=H. |last3=Anand |first3=C. |last4=Phillips |first4=R. |last5=Apul |first5=Defne |date=November 2013 |title=Development and application of EEAST: A lifecycle-based model for use of harvested rainwater and composting toilets in buildings |journal=Journal of Environmental Management |volume=130 |pages=397–404 |doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.09.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Devkota 20152"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Devkota |first1=Jay |last2=Schlachter |first2=Hannah |last3=Apul |first3=Defne |date=May 2015 |title=Life cycle based evaluation of harvested rainwater use in toilets and for irrigation |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production |volume=95 |pages=311–321 |doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.02.021}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed such a methodology for rainwater harvesting, and found that the building design (e.g., dimensions) and function (e.g., educational, residential, etc.) play critical roles in the environmental performance of the system. The Economic and Environmental Analysis of Sanitations Technologies, [https://defneapul.wikispaces.com/Water+sustainability EEAST] model evaluates the greenhouse gas emissions and cost of such systems over the lifetime of a variety of building types.

To address the functional parameters of rainwater harvesting systems, a new metric was developed - the demand to supply ratio (D/S) - identifying the ideal building design (supply) and function (demand) in regard to the environmental performance of rainwater harvesting for toilet flushing. With the idea that supply of rainwater not only saves the potable water, but also saves the stormwater entering the combined sewer network (thereby requiring treatment), the savings in environmental emissions were higher if the buildings are connected to a combined sewer network compared to separate one.&lt;ref name="Devkota 20152"/&gt;

== System setup ==

Rainwater harvesting systems can range in complexity, from systems that can be installed with minimal skills, to automated systems that require advanced setup and installation. The basic rainwater harvesting system is more of a plumbing job than a technical job, as all the outlets from the building's terrace are connected through a pipe to an underground tank that stores water.

Systems are ideally sized to meet the water demand throughout the dry season, since it must be big enough to support daily water consumption. Specifically, the rainfall capturing area such as a building roof must be large enough to maintain adequate flow of water. The water storage tank size should be large enough to contain the captured water. 
For low-tech systems, many low-tech methods are used to capture rainwater: rooftop systems, surface water capture and pumping the rainwater that has already soaked into the ground or captured in reservoirs and storing it in tanks (cisterns).

Before a rainwater harvesting system is built, use of digital tools is useful. For instance, to detect if a region has a high rainwater harvesting potential, rainwater-harvesting GIS maps can be made using an [http://www.rainfoundation.org/tools/map-your-rain.html online interactive tool], or , to estimate how much water is needed to fulfill a community's water needs, the Rain is Gain tool helps. Tools like these can save time and money before a commitment to build a system is undertaken, in addition to making the project sustainable and long lasting.

== Applications of rainwater harvesting ==

=== Agriculture ===

Missions to six Caribbean countries have shown that the capture and storage of rainwater runoff for later use is able to significantly reduce the risk of losing some or all of the year's harvest because of soil or water scarcity. In addition, the risks associated with flooding and soil erosion during high rainfall seasons would decrease. Small farmers, especially those farming on hillsides, could benefit the most from rainwater harvesting because they are able to capture runoff and decrease the effects of soil erosion.&lt;ref name=":83"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fletcher-Paul |first=Dr. Lystra |date= |title=Feasibility Study of Rainwater Harvesting for Agriculture in the Caribbean Subregion |url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-bq747e.pdf |journal=FAO |volume= |pages= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries, especially those with arid environments, use rainwater harvesting as a cheap and reliable source of clean water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Rainwater Harvesting for Agriculture and Water Supply |last=Zhu |first=Qiang |publisher=Springer |year=2015 |isbn=978-981-287-964-6 |location=Beijing |pages=20 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; To enhance [[irrigation]] in arid environments, ridges of soil are constructed to trap and prevent rainwater from running down hills and slopes.

=== Domestic use ===

* In China, Argentina, and Brazil, rooftop rainwater harvesting is used to provide drinking water, domestic water, water for livestock, water for small irrigation, and a way to replenish groundwater levels. [[Gansu]] province in China and semiarid [[Northeast Region, Brazil|northeast Brazil]] have the largest rooftop rainwater harvesting projects going on.
* About 40% of Thailand's rural population utilizes rainwater harvesting.&lt;ref name="JMP 2016"/&gt; Rainwater harvesting was promoted heavily by the government in the 1980s. In the 1990s, after government funding for the collection tanks ran out, the private sector stepped in and provided several million tanks to private households, many of which continue to be used today.&lt;ref name="saladin20162"/&gt; This is one of the largest examples of [[Self-supply of water and sanitation|self-supply of water]] worldwide.
* Rainwater harvesting is mandatory for new homes built in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=SANTA FE COUNTY Ordinance No. 2003-6: An Ordinance Amending Ordinance 1996-10, the Santa Fe County Land Development Code, Article III, Section 4.4.1 and Article III, Section 2.4.1 to require rainwater catchment systems for all commercial and residential development. |last= |first= |publisher= |year=2003 |isbn= |location= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Texas]] offers a sales tax exemption for the purchase of rainwater harvesting equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.twdb.texas.gov/publications/shells/RainwaterHarvesting.pdf |title=Rainwater Harvesting |last=Texas Water Development Board |first= |date=February 2018 |website=Water for Texas |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Rainwater tank|water butts]] are often found in domestic gardens and on [[Allotment (gardening)|allotments]] to collect rainwater, which is then used to water the garden.

=== Industry ===

Frankfurt Airport has the biggest rainwater harvesting system in Germany. The system helps save approximately 1 million cubic metres of water per year. The cost of the system was 1.5 million dm (US $63,000) in 1993. The system collects water from roofs of the new terminal which has an area of 26,800 square metres. The water is collected in the basement of the airport in six tanks with a storage capacity of 100 cubic metres. The water is mainly used for toilet flushing, watering plants and cleaning the air conditioning system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rainwaterharvesting.org/international/germany.htm |title=The Rainwater Harvesting System at Mira Model School |website=www.rainwaterharvesting.org |access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rainwater harvesting was adopted at The Velodrome – The [[Olympic Park, London|London Olympic Park]] – in order to increase the sustainability of the facility. A 73% decrease in potable water demand by the park was estimated. Despite this, it was deemed that rainwater harvesting was a less efficient use of financial resources to increase sustainability than the park's blackwater recycling program.&lt;ref name=":93"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://learninglegacy.independent.gov.uk/documents/pdfs/sustainability/154-rainwater-harvesting-sust.pdf |title=Learning legacy: Lessons learned from the London 2012 Games construction project |last= |first= |date=2011 |website=Olympic Delivery Authority |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quality ==

Rainwater may need to be analyzed properly, and used in a way appropriate to its safety. In the [[Gansu]] province for example, [[solar water disinfection]] is used by boiling harvested rainwater in parabolic solar cookers before being used for drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90781/6248934.html |last=Chen |first=Xuefei |title=Rainwater harvesting benefits farmers in Gansu |work=People's Daily Online |date=27 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These so-called "[[appropriate technology]]" methods provide low-cost disinfection options for treatment of stored rainwater for drinking.

While rainwater itself is a clean source of water, often better than groundwater or water from rivers or lakes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hatch |first1=Jacob |title=The Many Benefits of Rainwater Harvesting |url=https://hydrationanywhere.com/the-many-benefits-of-rain-water-harvesting/ |website=Hydration Anywhere |publisher=Hydration Anywhere |accessdate=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the process of collection and storage often leaves the water polluted and non-potable. Rainwater harvested from roofs can contain human, animal and bird [[feces]], [[moss]]es and [[lichen]]s, windblown dust, particulates from urban pollution, pesticides, and inorganic [[ion]]s from the sea ([[Calcium|Ca]], [[Magnesium|Mg]], [[Sodium|Na]], [[Potassium|K]], [[Chlorine|Cl]], [[sulfate|SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]), and dissolved gases ([[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[nitrogen oxide|NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[sulfur oxide|SO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;]]). High levels of pesticide have been found in rainwater in Europe with the highest concentrations occurring in the first rain immediately after a dry spell;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last1=Pearce |first1=Fred |last2=Mackenzie |first2=Debora |date=3 April 1999 |title=It's raining pesticides |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg16221803-100-its-raining-pesticides/ |magazine=New Scientist |issue=2180 |access-date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the concentration of these and other contaminants are reduced significantly by diverting the [[First flush|initial flow]] of run-off water to waste. Improved water quality can also be obtained by using a floating draw-off mechanism (rather than from the base of the tank) and by using a series of tanks, withdraw from the last in series. Prefiltration is a common practice used in the industry to keep the system healthy and ensure that the water entering the tank is free of large sediments.

Conceptually, a water supply system should match the quality of water with the end use. However, in most of the developed world, high-quality potable water is used for all end uses. This approach wastes money and energy and imposes unnecessary impacts to the environment. Supplying rainwater that has gone through preliminary filtration measures for nonpotable water uses, such as toilet flushing, irrigation and laundry, may be a significant part of a sustainable water management strategy.

{{for|the cryptocurrency platform|RootStock}}A '''rootstock''' is part of a plant, often an underground part, from which new above-ground growth can be produced. It could also be described as a stem with a well developed root system, to which a bud from another plant is grafted. It can refer to a [[rhizome]] or underground stem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hickey |first=M. |last2=King |first2=C. |year=2001 |title=The Cambridge Illustrated Glossary of Botanical Terms |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-79080-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[grafting]], it refers to a plant, sometimes just a stump, which already has an established, healthy [[Root|root system]], onto which a cutting or a bud from another plant is grafted. In some cases, such as vines of grapes and other berries, cuttings may be used for rootstocks, the roots being established in nursery conditions before planting them out. The plant part grafted onto the rootstock is usually called the '''scion'''. The [[Scion (grafting)|scion]] is the plant that has the properties that [[Plant propagation|propagator]] desires above ground, including the photosynthetic activity and the fruit or decorative properties. The rootstock is selected for its interaction with the [[soil]], providing the roots and the stem to support the new plant, obtaining the necessary soil water and minerals, and resisting the relevant pests and diseases. After a few weeks the tissues of the two parts will have grown together, eventually forming a single plant. After some years it may be difficult to detect the site of the graft although the product always contains the components of two genetically different plants.

The use of rootstocks is most commonly associated with [[fruit]]ing plants and trees, and is useful for mass propagating many other types of plants that do not breed true from [[seed]], or are particularly susceptible to [[disease]] when grown on their own roots.

Although grafting has been practiced for many hundreds of years, even in Roman times, most [[orchard]] rootstocks in current use were developed in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mudge |first=K. |last2=Janick |first2=J. |last3=Scofield |first3=S. |last4=Goldschmidt |first4=E. E. |year=2009 |chapter=A history of grafting |editor-last=Janick |editor-first=J. |title=Horticultural Reviews |volume=35 |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=437–493 |url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/janick-papers/c09.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of rootstocks may be used for a single [[species]] or [[cultivar]] of scion because different rootstocks impart different properties, such as vigour, fruit size and [[wiktionary:precocious|precocity]]. Rootstocks also may be selected for traits such as resistance to [[drought]], root pests, and [[disease]]s.  [[Grape]]vines for commercial planting are most often grafted onto rootstocks to avoid damage by [[phylloxera]], though vines available for sale to back garden viticulturists may not be.

The rootstock may be a different species from the scion, but as a rule it should be closely related, for example, many commercial [[pear]]s are grown on [[quince]] rootstock. Grafting can also be done in stages; a closely related scion is grafted to the rootstock, and a less closely related scion is grafted to the first scion. Serial grafting of several scions may also be used to produce a tree that bears several different fruit [[cultivar]]s, with the same rootstock taking up and distributes water and minerals to the whole system. Those with more than three varieties are known as 'family trees'.

When it is difficult to match a plant to the soil in a certain field or orchard, growers may graft a scion onto a rootstock that is compatible with the soil. It may then be convenient to plant a range of ungrafted rootstocks to see which suit the growing conditions best; the fruiting characteristics of the scion may be considered later, once the most successful rootstock has been identified. Rootstocks are studied extensively and often are sold with a complete guide to their ideal soil and climate. Growers determine the [[pH]], mineral content, [[nematode]] population, [[salinity]], water availability, [[pathogen]] load and [[sand]]iness of their particular soil, and select a rootstock which is matched to it. [[Genetic testing]] is increasingly common, and new cultivars of rootstock are always being developed.

==AxR1==
'''AxR1''' is a [[grape]] rootstock once widely used in [[California]] [[viticulture]]. Its name is an abbreviation for "Aramon Rupestris Ganzin No. 1", which in turn is based on its parentage: a cross (made by a French grape hybridizer named Ganzin) between [[Aramon (grape)|Aramon]], a ''[[Vitis vinifera]]'' cultivar, and Rupestris, an American grape species, ''[[Vitis rupestris]]''—also used on its own as rootstock, "Rupestris St. George" or "St. George," referring to a town in the South of France, Saint Georges d'Orques, where it was popular.

It achieved a degree of notoriety in California when, after decades of recommendation as a preferred rootstock—despite repeated warnings from France and South Africa about its susceptibility (it had failed in Europe in the early 1900s), it ultimately succumbed to phylloxera in the 1980s, requiring the replanting of most of Napa and Sonoma, with disastrous financial consequences.  Those who resisted the urge to use AxR-1, such as [[David R. Bennion|David Bennion]] of [[Ridge Vineyards]], saw their vineyards spared from phylloxera damage.

Most current day grape rootstocks were and are originally imported from Texas. These were taken from the native wild mustang grapes that grow across Texas.
This rootstock also saved France's grape industry in the early 1900s when [[Great French Wine Blight|phylloxera decimated]] the wine and vineyards of Europe.

== Apple rootstock ==
Apple rootstocks are used for apple trees and are often the deciding factor of the size of the tree that is grafted on to the root. Dwarfing, semi-dwarf, semi-standard and standard are the size benchmarks for the different sizes of roots that will be grown, with standard being the largest and dwarf being the smallest.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/00-007.htm|title=Apple Rootstocks|website=www.omafra.gov.on.ca|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the world's apple production is now using dwarf rootstocks to improve efficiency, increase density and increase yields of fruit per/acre.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The following is a list of the dwarfing rootstock that are commonly used today in apple production:

Malling 9 rootstock is the most common and well known dwarfing rootstock. This rootstock should be planted in a well drained site, and requires staking for the duration of its life.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://extension.psu.edu/plants/tree-fruit/commercial-tree-fruit-production/cultivars-and-rootstocks/apple-rootstocks|title=Apple Rootstocks (Tree Fruit Production)|website=Tree Fruit Production (Penn State Extension)|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rootstock is also very susceptible to fireblight and burr knots.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There have been many clones made of this rootstock, including M.9 NAKB 337, M.9EMLA and M.9. Pajam.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Malling 26 rootstock will grow a larger tree than the M9 rootstock will, and is about 40-50% the size of a standard tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vanwell.net/varieties/apple-rootstocks|title=Fruit Tree Nursery Van Well Trees Nursery East Wenatchee Washington - Apple Rootstocks|website=www.vanwell.net|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This root is considered very productive and early bearing, and requires staking in the first few years of its life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boyernurseries.com/rootstocks.html|title=Rootstocks for Fruit Trees|website=www.boyernurseries.com|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malling 7 rootstock is slightly bigger than an M26 rootstock, and also requires staking in the first several years to establish a centre leader.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thenewfruitgrower.com/new_page_1.htm|title=Apple Rootstocks|website=www.thenewfruitgrower.com|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rootstock is moderately susceptible to blight and collar rot.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The fruit size that M7 produces is good but not as large as an M26, or M9 rootstock.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This root is highly susceptible to suckering and leaning over in its later years of life, which is very annoying and causes issues for the producer.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Malling 111 rootstock is one of the biggest and vigorous rootstock that is used today in commercial orchards, and is about 80-90% the size of a standard sized tree.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.extension.org/pages/60915/apple-rootstock-info:-mm111-emla|title=Apple Rootstock Info: MM.111 EMLA - eXtension|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally quite winter hardy and produces few burr knots and root suckers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This rootstock is much less popular than it once was, because many commercial producers are now planting higher density orchards, which M111 is not conducive to.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

Malling 106 rootstock is slightly smaller than M111, but is a very productive tree and early fruiting abilities.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bighorsecreekfarm.com/rootstock-information-2/|title=Rootstock Information|website=bighorsecreekfarm.com|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a great rootstock to be used in a variety of soil conditions because it is very hardy with moderate vigour.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This rootstock must be planted in well drained soils as it is susceptible to collar rot.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

A '''slip lane''' is a road traffic lane provided at an intersection to allow vehicles to turn at the intersection without actually entering it and interfering with through traffic. It is therefore not controlled by any traffic signals at that intersection. There are two types of slip lane - those where the lane continues into its own lane in the road which it turns into and those where the lane terminates at the point where it enters the road turned into.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au/Documents/pedestrian%20crossing%20slip%20lanes.u_2052703r_1n_D08%5E23180753.PDF|title=Pedestrians crossing slip lanes|publisher=Main Roads Western Australia|date=September 2002|accessdate=8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slip lanes may need to be removed if considerations such as pedestrian safety grow to a point where they over-ride the desire to facilitate free passage for cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://participate.melbourne.vic.gov.au/application/files/8214/4168/3004/City-Road-Draft-Master-Plan-Action3.pdf|title=City Road Draft Master Plan|publisher=Melbourne City Council|date=July 2015|accessdate=8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transportblog.co.nz/2015/10/02/slip-lanes-be-gone/|title=Slip Lanes be gone|publisher=Matt L|date=2 October 2015|accessdate=8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]] cars exiting a slip lane must give way to all other traffic even when that traffic is faced with a give-way or other traffic controls.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cota-act.org.au/Livedrive/road_rules.html&lt;/ref&gt;

To minimise risks of collision, slip lanes can be shaped to enter the traffic flow at a higher angle than the 45 degrees shown in the first sketch. Such lanes are called high entry angle slip lanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nzta.govt.nz/assets/resources/road-traffic-standards/docs/rts-09.pdf|title=Guidelines for the signing and layout of slip lanes|publisher=NZ Transport Agency|date=November 1993|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beach sign Île du Levant 03886.JPG|220px|right|thumb|Board at the trail to the beach]]

'''Île du Levant''' ({{IPA-fr|il dy ləvɑ̃|pron}}; [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]]: ''Illa dau Levant''), sometimes referred to as '''Le Levant''', is a [[List of islands of France|French island]] in the [[Mediterranean]] off the coast of the [[French Riviera|Riviera]], near [[Toulon]]. It is one of the four that constitute the [[Îles d'Hyères]].

== Geography ==

The island is {{convert|8|by|2|km}}, and located in the [[Gulf of Lion]].  About 90% of the island is reserved for a [[Military of France|military]] [[missile]] test center (the Centre d'Essais de Lancement de Missiles) which has launched numerous research and testing rockets since its establishment in 1948. The remaining 10% is open to civilians.

[[File:Ile du Levant.jpg|thumbnail|left|The military zone is shown in red on the map of the island.]]

[[File:Île du Levant - sandy beach.jpg|thumb|Plage des Grottes at Île du levant]]

== History ==

Monks lived on the island beginning in the 15th century; the ruins of their [[monastery]] still exist on the island. From 1861 until 1878, the island was a penitentiary for young offenders and orphans, of whom 89 died here. A plaque (located on the military part of the island) commemorates them.

In 1931, [[Gaston Durville|Gaston]] and [[André Durville]], both doctors, established Héliopolis, Europe's first village dedicated to [[naturism]], on the island. As the doctors Durville said in 1931 {{quote|Heliopolis should not be a city or village, not an agglomeration of houses or luxury villas with garages, casinos, theaters, factories, business houses, but a simple rustic city where air and sunlight lovers come in the quiet of a beautiful nature, rest from the fatigue of artificial civilisation of cities, and enjoy simple and healthy holiday, with the only luxury of high ideals and the only concern for a more robust health.&lt;ref name="iled_Heli" /&gt;}}

The village was built on hillsides and is dominated by Fort [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]. The village has a post office, a city hall, a chapel and a police station as well as a grocery, a bakery, and two galleries. In 2017 a pizzeria will be opening. The port area houses the office of the Capitaine du Port, a clothing store and small general store. In between there is a bazaar (Le Bazar d'Héliopolis) offering food, hardware, a tabac and cafe bar. There are a number of hotels and bed-and-breakfasts, and eight restaurants (Le Gecko, La Fourmi, La Palmeraie, La Gambaro, Héliotel, Le Minimum, La Pomme d'Adam, La Bohème), all catering for naturists.

== Culture ==

The Bain de Diane and the Plage des Grottes (a [[nude beach]]) are reserved for naturists; nudity is formally obligatory there. Being nude is allowed (and expected) everywhere on the public area of the island, except in the immediate vicinity of the harbour and on the village square.&lt;ref&gt;Arrêté Municipal Hyères N° 25, 14 March 1978 (http://www.aln.fr/html/documents/Arr%EAt%E9_1978_03_14_Mairie_Hy%E8res_Naturisme_au_Levant.pdf); modified 20 April 2005 (http://www.aln.fr/html/documents/Arr%EAt%E9_2005_04_28_modif-arr%EAt%E9-1978-naturisme-Levant.pdf). In August 2015, the Mayor of Hyeres has informed the French Naturist Association that simply traversing the Village Square and its surroundings nude will henceforth be tolerated. ({{cite web |url=http://www.ile-du-levant.net/blog-naturiste/traverser-nu-la-place-du-village.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327165910/http://ile-du-levant.net/blog-naturiste/traverser-nu-la-place-du-village.html |archivedate=2016-03-27 |df= }}).&lt;/ref&gt; On these locations, it is formally necessary to wear what the French jokingly call {{lang-fr|le minimum|The minimum}},{{efn|''Le minimum'' is the term jokingly used by [[naturist]]s on the island, for the tiny coverage required by regulations on a few locations. On the village square, near the harbour and inside shops and restaurants, the genitals have to be covered. As a good-humoured protest against this regulation, some naturists wear in these locations a tiny string, a transparant pareo or a [[loincloth]] that fulfils the legal requirement but does little to preserve modesty.}}&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; often a [[pareo]] or a [[G-string|string]]. In conformance with the relaxed atmosphere of the island, this rule is not really enforced, but generally well observed. Inside restaurants outside the village centre, some clothing, although often flimsy, is usually worn but [[toplessness]] (for women and men) is quite accepted there and ''le minimum'' considered sufficient attire; on the outside terraces, nudity is common, especially at lunch time. At least two restaurants, La Fourmi and Heliotel, actively encourage nude use, even at dinner. In August 2015 it became permitted to walk naked through the village square but ''le minimum'' is required if stopping. 

[[File:Île du Levant.jpg|thumb|A nudist sculpture on the Île du Levant.]]
The island sees a number of scuba divers; these generally do not partake in the nudist lifestyle.

The non-military part of the island is private property. The owners form the Association Syndicale Libre des Propriétaires à l'Île du Levant.

Outside Héliopolis naturist village, the other main tourist attraction is the Domaine des Arbousiers, a voluntary natural reserve of {{convert|19|ha}}, established on 3 December 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Décision du Préfecture du Var, 3 December 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

The island can be reached by boat from [[Hyères]] and from [[Le Lavandou]]. As no cars are allowed on the island (except for some four utility cars), these ferries do not take cars.

==In popular culture==

A 1956 film by [[Werner Kunz]] was called ''[[Isle of Levant]]'' and featured so-called "nudist camp" footage.

The island is used as a setting in the [[Robert A. Heinlein]]  novel ''[[Glory Road]]'' and in the [[Mario Reading]] novel ''The Music Makers''.

The island was mentioned in ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'' episode "Hoorah for the Holidays" as a presumed destination for [[Captain Peacock]]'s annual vacation. Miss Brahms calls it "a nudist colony" but Captain Peacock insists it's a "nature camp".

The island, and a nod to its nudist history, was also featured in the French film ''Nos Futurs'' (Our Futures).
