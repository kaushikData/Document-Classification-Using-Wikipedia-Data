The '''6th [[Micronesian Games]]''' were held on [[Saipan]], Northern Mariana Islands from June 23-July 2, 2006. The Games featured competition in 15 different sports/disciplines.

In February 2006, the Games were canceled by the Governor of the Northern Marianas, [[Benigno R. Fitial]], due to a financial crisis and a lack of planning. However, after pleas from athletes, coaches and parents, and the creation of a financial plan, the Games were allowed to go on.

On June 23, 2006, the games were officially opened by the [[List of Governors of the Northern Mariana Islands|Governor of the Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Benigno R. Fitial]].  
The torch lighter was swimmer [[Xenavee Pangelinan|Xenavee Torwal]].  She has won 22 gold medals in past Micronesian Games as Xenavee Pangelinan.&lt;ref name=saipan_02&gt;

'''[[Bahrain]]''' made its [[Paralympic Games]] début the same year as its Olympic début, at the [[1984 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Stoke Mandeville]] and [[New York City]], sending a delegation to compete in [[Athletics at the Summer Paralympics|athletics]]. The country has participated in every subsequent edition of the [[Summer Paralympics]], but has never taken part in the [[Winter Paralympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paralympic.org/Sport/Results/search.html?npc=BRN&amp;gender=all&amp;medal=all&amp;sport=all&amp;games=all Bahrain at the Paralympics], [[International Paralympic Committee]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahraini competitors have won a total of ten Paralympic medals, all of them in athletics: two gold, three silver and five bronze. The country's first inaugural participation in the Games in 1984 yielded two bronze medals: K. Alqatam finished third in the men's javelin (category 5), and [[Adel Sultan]] finished third in the men's 100m sprint (category 5). Bahrain won its first gold medal four years later, with [[Khaled Al Saqer]] winning the men's slalom in the 1A category. His compatriot [[Ali Alhasan]] took bronze in the same event, while Adel Sultan took a silver medal in the 100m sprint (categories 5-6). In 1992, Al Saqer won the country's only medal, a bronze in the discus (THW2-3). There was no medals in 1996, but in 2000 [[Ayman Al Heddi]] and [[Ahmed Kamal (athlete)|Ahmed Kamal]] obtained a silver and a bronze, respectively, in the discus and the shot put. [[Ahmed Meshaima]]'s silver in the shot put (F37) in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paralympic.org/Sport/Results/search.html?npc=BRN&amp;gender=all&amp;medal=all&amp;sport=all&amp;games=all Bahrain at the Paralympics], International Paralympic Committee&lt;/ref&gt;

Three women have represented Bahrain at the Paralympics: M. Alkhinna and S. Mohamed in sprinting and slalom, [[Fatema Nedham]] was the first woman to win a gold medal for Bahrain in the shot put in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paralympic.org/Sport/Results/search.html?npc=BRN&amp;gender=all&amp;medal=all&amp;sport=all&amp;games=all Bahrain at the Paralympics], International Paralympic Committee&lt;/ref&gt; Bahraini women's participation in the Paralympics thus predates their participation in the Olympics, which began in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=1887619 "Running into History"], ESPN, September 25, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bruno-Plache-Stadion''' is a multi-use [[stadium]] in [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]].  It is currently used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches and is the home stadium of [[Lokomotive Leipzig]]. Fans only call it  "das Bruno" (the Bruno).  The stadium has a capacity of 15,600 people, but it is only accredited for 7,000 people at the moment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lok-leipzig.com/de/info/aktuell/news/2009-08-12-stadion-umbau-fertig.html Plache-Stadion nun wieder für 7.000 Zuschauer zugelassen] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415043915/http://www.lok-leipzig.com/de/info/aktuell/news/2009-08-12-stadion-umbau-fertig.html |date=April 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was built in 1922. When it was opened, it was the largest stadium owned by a club in Germany, with a proposed capacity of over 40,000 people. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bruno-plache-stadion.de/sites/geschichtliches.htm&lt;/ref&gt; After the Second World War, the stadium was home to SC Rotation Leipzig, until 1990. In 1992, the [[German Football Association]] prohibited games to be held for the [[2. Fußball-Bundesliga]] due to security requirements not being met. Since 2004, football matches are being held again at the stadium, which is now the home ground of [[1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig]]. The city of Leipzig has full ownership of the stadium.

On June 13, 1999 [[Bruce Springsteen]] played a concert at the venue during his [[Reunion Tour]].  &lt;ref&gt;[http://brucebase.wikispaces.com/1999 Bruce Springsteen setlists, articles, multimedia and much more]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''C.O. Brown Stadium''' is a [[baseball]] [[stadium]] in the United States located in [[Battle Creek, Michigan]].  The stadium was built in 1990 and is a part of Bailey Park, a longtime home of amateur baseball.  C.O. Brown Stadium is the former home of the [[Michigan Battle Cats]], [[Battle Creek Yankees]] and the [[Southwest Michigan Devil Rays]] of the Class A [[Midwest League]]. The stadium has a [[seating capacity]] of 2,193. C.O. Brown Stadium is the current home of the [[Northwoods League]]'s [[Battle Creek Bombers]].

==Name origin==
The stadium was named for Cooper Othniel Brown, a baseball entrepreneur who helped make Battle Creek a hub for amateur tournament baseball in the 1930s and served as the first president of the American Amateur Baseball Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mwlguide.com/cities/battlecreek/park.html "C.O. Brown Stadium in Bailey Park"], MWLguide.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.littleballparks.com/Stadium/2006/Battle_Creek/Battle_Creek.htm "C.O. Brown Stadium"], Ball Parks of the Minor Leagues&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other events==
On August 31, 2008, shortly after accepting the democratic nomination, [[Barack Obama]] and [[Joe Biden]] held a rally at C.O. Brown Stadium drawing an estimated 15,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/kzgazette/news/index.ssf/2008/08/barack_obama_draws_a_crowd_of.html "Barack Obama draws a crowd of 15,000 in Battle Creek"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916224656/http://www.mlive.com/kzgazette/news/index.ssf/2008/08/barack_obama_draws_a_crowd_of.html# |date=2008-09-16 }}, by Jane C. Parikh, ''[[Kalamazoo Gazette]]'', August 31, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also hosted postseason baseball tournaments.  Until 2013, the MHSAA used the stadium to host the Michigan Baseball State Championships for all four divisions where they have been moved to [[Drayton McLane Baseball Stadium at John H. Kobs Field]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mhsaa.com/DesktopModules/MHSAA-Tournaments-Brackets/PrintableBrackets/2010-BA-M-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freep.com/article/20131211/HSS/312110138/Baseball-softball-finals-moving-Michigan-State&lt;/ref&gt;  The stadium also hosted the 1993 and 1994 [[Big Ten Conference Baseball Tournament]]s.&lt;ref name=bigtenrb2012&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Big Ten Baseball Record Book |url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/big10/genrel/auto_pdf/2011-12/misc_non_event/B1GRecords11-12BASE.pdf |accessdate=27 June 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68j26i9GE?url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/big10/genrel/auto_pdf/2011-12/misc_non_event/B1GRecords11-12BASE.pdf |archivedate=2012-06-27 |page=107 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stadium renovations ==
In 2016 the team announced major ballpark renovations that will drop the seating capacity of C.O. Brown Stadium from more than 4,000 to 2,300. The marquee renovation includes the introduction of an all-new “Home Plate Club,” which will feature 10 granite half-moon tables situated directly behind home plate. Each table will also feature four stadium chairs sourced from Camden Yards. Each table will have access to its own all-inclusive upscale menu, including both beer and wine pairings. The team has already had a number of these reserved and is taking deposits for full- and half-season plans immediately. All 10 tables are expected to be sold out well before Opening Day.

“The Champions Club,” which was sold out for most of 2015, now shifts down the first and third base lines. These areas will now feature additional legroom and a food and beverage railing in front of each seat. This renovation allows for a more comfortable fan experience and gives the Bombers 98 Champions Club seats for 2016.

The bleacher area will also look quite different this summer. The team will offer reserved bleacher seats instead of general admission seating, which will guarantee ticket holders a designated seat at each game. The first-base side will now have permanent vinyl grandstand covers over the seats. These covers will eliminate seating in an area where historically the sun has tormented fans.

The Miller Lite Party Deck will also be receiving a facelift, courtesy of Heights Construction. While some general upkeep and maintenance will be performed, the team plans to stain the deck area while repurposing seats from the original C.O. Brown Stadium bowl grandstand.  Furthermore, the team has now limited the Miller Lite Party Deck to approximately 375 tickets on any given night and will allow groups to reserve their own private sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://northwoodsleague.com/battle-creek-bombers/2016/02/20/battle-creek-bombers-announce-10-year-anniversary-plans/|title=Battle Creek Bombers Announce 10-Year Anniversary Plans|date=2016-02-20|website=Battle Creek Bombers|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In November 2007, Bailey Park and C.O. Brown Stadium was awarded the 2007 USSSA [[United States Specialty Sports Association]] Complex of the Year Award presented at the USSSA National Meeting in Daytona Beach, Florida.

Presented annually to one facility in the country, there are a number of requirements that a complex must meet to qualify. Requirements for the award include: full participation with USSSA, a proven history of hosting and running quality events, a high number of participating teams, outstanding facilities, and top notch ground crews.

[[File:Cricket Partnership.jpg|thumb|right|Indian batsmen wearing helmets]]
In the sport of [[cricket]], [[batsmen]] often wear a '''helmet''' to protect themselves from injury or concussion by the [[cricket ball]], which is very hard and can be bowled to them at speeds over {{convert|90|mph}}.  Cricket helmets cover the whole of the head, and have a grill or [[perspex]] visor to protect the face. Often constructed with a [[Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon fibre]] and [[Kevlar]] shell, the helmet is designed to deflect cricket balls as well as shield the wearer from impact, and its liner includes an inflatable element to tightly fit the helmet to its wearer's head.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

[[Fielding (cricket)|Fielders]] who are positioned very close to the batsman (e.g. silly point or short leg) often wear a helmet and shin guards.   Nowadays it is almost unheard of for a professional cricketer to face a [[fast bowling|fast bowler]] without a helmet. Some batsmen prefer not to wear a helmet when facing [[spin bowling]].

==History==
There are recorded instances of cricketers using scarves and padded caps to protect themselves throughout cricket history.  [[Patsy Hendren]] was one of the first to use a self designed protective hat in the 1930s.  Helmets were not in common use until the 1970s.  The first helmets were seen in [[World Series Cricket]], with [[Dennis Amiss]] being the first player to consistently wear a helmet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Briggs |first=Simon |title= Amiss unearths helmet that changed the game|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/2358790/Amiss-unearths-helmet-that-changed-the-game.html |website=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="econ2014"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.economist.com/blogs/gametheory/2014/11/safety-cricket | title=  The bravery of the batsman| publisher=[[The Economist]] | date=26 November 2014| quote=until the late 1970s helmets were unheard of; batsmen wore nothing to protect their noggins except a cloth cap. When they began to creep into the game—Dennis Amiss, an English batsman, is usually cited as the first to wear one regularly during the 1978 World Series Cricket tournament—they were essentially adapted motorcycle helmets. Batsmen who donned them were sometimes mocked as cowards. |accessdate= 26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Brearley]] was another player who wore his own design. [[Tony Greig]] was of the opinion that they would make cricket more dangerous by encouraging bowlers to bounce the batsmen. [[Graham Yallop]] of Australia was the first to wear a protective helmet to a [[Test cricket|test match]] on 17 March 1978, when playing against [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] at [[Bridgetown]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/cricket/england-opener-michael-carberrys-spaceage-helmet-turns-heads/story-fni2fnmo-1226766113541|title=England opener Michael Carberry's space-age helmet turns heads|date=22 November 2013|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)]]|publisher=[[News Corp Australia]]|accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Dennis Amiss of England popularised it in Test cricket. 
Helmets began to be widely worn thereafter.

The last batsmen at the highest (Test match) level to never wear a helmet throughout his career was [[Viv Richards]], who retired from the international game in 1991.

== Modern day cricket helmets ==
Modern day cricket helmets are made in compliance recent safety standards of ICC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci-icc/content/story/1077774.html|title=ICC announces new regulations for helmet safety|work=Cricinfo|access-date=2017-04-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Materials used for making cricket helmets are impact resistance materials like ABS Plastic, Fibreglass, carbon fibre, titanium, steel and high density foam etc. Main parts of a cricket helmets are grill (made with steel or carbon fibre), chin strap, inner foam material, outer impact resistant shell etc. Sometimes, a batsman can be seriously injured or killed by a fast ball while not wearing a helmet, but some fatalities have occurred even when the batsman was wearing a helmet, like the fate of [[Phillip Huges]].

==Legislation==
As of 2017, the [[International Cricket Council]] has refused to pass laws requiring the wearing of helmets, rather leaving the decision to each test nation to decide for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/news/311699|title=ICC introduces new helmet regulations|website=Icc-cricket.com|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, although it is not obligatory for a batsman to wear a helmet, should he chose to do so, the helmet must comply with specific safety requirements, a rule all the test playing nations have agreed to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/18479717/icc-announces-new-regulations-helmet-safety|title=ICC announces new regulations for helmet safety|website=Espncricinfo.com|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In first class cricket, as of 2016, the [[England and Wales Cricket Board]] requires all batsmen, wicketkeepers and fielders closer than 8 yards from the wicket to wear helmets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/story/944579.html|title=ECB confirms professional cricketers must wear helmets|website=Espncricinfo.com|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/27/helmets-professional-cricketers-england-wales|title=Helmets must be worn by professional cricketers in England next season|date=27 November 2015|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is mandatory even when facing medium-pace and spin bowling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/34940416|title=Helmet use to be made mandatory in first-class cricket in England|date=26 November 2015|accessdate=13 August 2018|website=Bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[New Zealand Cricket]] and the [[Board of Control for Cricket in India]] do not require batsmen to wear helmets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/cricket/80228221/new-zealand-cricket-to-bring-in-new-safety-measures-but-helmets-set-to-stay-optional|title=New Zealand Cricket to bring in new safety measures, but helmets set to stay optional|website=Stuff.co.nz|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketwellington.co.nz/helmet-policy/|title=CRICKET WELLINGTON - New Zealand Cricket's Helmet Policy|date=17 November 2016|website=Cricketwellington.co.nz|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/sports-news/cricket-is-game-life-isnt-bcci-learn-from-john-ward-make-helmets-compulsory-at-all-levels-2591892.html|title=Cricket is a game but life isn't: BCCI must learn from the past to make helmets compulsory at all levels|website=Firstpost.com|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition from players==
Many players refused to wear helmets, either believing that they obstructed their vision when batting, or, just as in the similar debate in ice hockey, feeling helmets were unmanly, a view held by many spectators. Englishman [[Dennis Amiss]] was the first player to wear a helmet in the modern game, during a [[World Series Cricket]] match, for which both the crowd and other players mocked him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.redbull.com/in-en/a-brief-history-of-helmets-and-cricket |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206155345/https://www.redbull.com/in-en/a-brief-history-of-helmets-and-cricket |archive-date=2017-12-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Australian captain [[Graham Yallop]] was booed when he wore one in a 1978 match against the West Indies (the first time a helmet was worn in a test match) and West Indian captain [[Viv Richards]] viewed such protection as cowardly.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/cricket-helmets/cricket-batsmans-death-turns-attention-on-helmets-idUKL3N0TI2H520141128|title=Cricket-Batsman's death turns attention on helmets|first=Julian|last=Linden|website=Uk.reuters.com|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; India captain [[Sunil Gavaskar]] believed that helmets slowed down a batsman's reflexes and refused to wear one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/Gavaskar+didnt+wear+helmets+because+of+reading+habit/1/70728.html|title=Gavaskar didn't wear helmets because of reading habit|website=India Today|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In more recent times, many batsmen have felt that modern helmet designs have become increasingly obstructive. Most notably, England captain [[Alastair Cook]] for a time refused to wear a new helmet complying to ICC safety regulations since he felt it was distracting and uncomfortable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/apr/15/alastair-cook-batting-helmet-ecb|title=Alastair Cook treads a fine line with his batting helmet stubbornness - Mike Selvey|first=Mike|last=Selvey|date=15 April 2016|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His England teammate [[Jonathan Trott]] also refused for similar reasons, and teammate [[Nick Compton]] (a close friend of [[Phillip Hughes]]) felt that the new regulations were overzealous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2016/04/18/jonathan-trott-joins-alastair-cook-in-rejecting-new-safety-appro/|title=Jonathan Trott joins Alastair Cook in rejecting new safety approved helmet|first=Nick|last=Hoult|date=18 April 2016|accessdate=13 August 2018|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dan Law Field at Rip Griffin Park''', nicknamed "The Law", is the home stadium of the [[Texas Tech Red Raiders baseball]] team in [[Lubbock, Texas]]. It is located on the [[Texas Tech University]] campus, adjacent to [[Jones AT&amp;T Stadium]] and [[Fuller Track]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.dailytoreador.com/media/storage/paper870/news/2002/02/22/Sports/Pirates.Invade.The.Law.Raiders.Seek.Justice-1273726.shtml Pirates invade The Law, Raiders seek justice - Sports]&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Law Field was rated as one of the top three places to watch a college baseball game by ''[[Sports Illustrated]] On Campus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/text/sports/m-basebl/auto_pdf/2008mediaguide.pdf|title=2008 Baseball Media Guide|accessdate=2008-07-09|publisher=Texas Tech Athletics|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name and capacity==
From 1988 through 2011, the ballpark was named Dan Law Field after former Texas Tech baseball player Dan Law who was instrumental in the stadium's renovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://texastech.cstv.com/trads/hoh-il.html |title=Texas Tech Hall of Honor |publisher=Texas Tech Official Athletic Site |accessdate=2009-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321191410/http://texastech.cstv.com/trads/hoh-il.html |archivedate=2009-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Law played for the [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football|Red Raider football]] team from 1955–56 and baseball from 1956-57.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://texastech.cstv.com/trads/text-hall-of-honor.html |title=Hall of Honor |publisher=Texas Tech Official Athletic Site |accessdate=2009-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706202301/http://texastech.cstv.com/trads/text-hall-of-honor.html |archivedate=2008-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 2012 season, the ballpark has been known as Dan Law Field at Rip Griffin Park. An anonymous donor to the 2012 renovation requested the field be named after Rip Griffin, a long-time supporter of Red Raider baseball and Texas Tech athletics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.texastech.com/sports/m-basebl/spec-rel/101311aad.html&lt;/ref&gt; The ballpark has a permanent [[seating capacity]] of 4,368. Renovated in 1996 and 2001, the stadium underwent another upgrade in 2007 and its latest in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.dailytoreador.com/media/storage/paper870/news/2007/09/20/Sports/Tech-Baseball.Begins.Fall.Practice.At.Lubbock.Christian-2979278.shtml Tech baseball begins fall practice at Lubbock Christian - Sports&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the Red Raiders ranked 13th among [[List of NCAA Division I baseball programs|Division I baseball programs]] in attendance, averaging 3,665 per home game.&lt;ref name=14att&gt;{{cite web|last=Cutler|first=Tami|title=2014 Division I Baseball Attendance - Final Report|url=http://www.sportswriters.net/ncbwa/news/2014/attendance140331.pdf|work=Sportswriters.net|publisher=NCBWA|accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A record attendance of 4,898 was set on June 12, 2016 when Texas Tech hosted East Carolina University in the Lubbock Super Regional matchup.

==History==
While baseball had been practiced in the city prior to this, baseball in Ponce started in earnest upon the arrival of the [[United States|Americans]] to the island after the [[Spanish–American War]] of 1898.  The first non-professional baseball leagues played at [[Campo Atlético Charles H. Terry]]. However, after the formation of the ''Liga de Béisbol Semiprofesional de Puerto Rico'' (Puerto Rico Semiprofessional Baseball League) in 1938,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas E. Van Hyning. ''Puerto Rico's Winter League: A History of Major League Baseball's Launching Pad.'' Page 7. (Jefferson, N.C. : McFarland &amp; Co., 1995) {{ISBN|0786401281}}. {{ISBN|9780786401284}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the sport had mature enough that it became necessary to plan on building a new stadium. This need was further exacerbated on 14 September 1941 when the League became a professional-level league.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas E. Van Hyning. ''Puerto Rico's Winter League: A History of Major League Baseball's Launching Pad.'' Page 9. (Jefferson, N.C. : McFarland &amp; Co., 1995) {{ISBN|0786401281}}. {{ISBN|9780786401284}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the stadium began in 1947 and it opened two years later on October 15, 1949.&lt;ref name="periodicolaperla.com"/&gt; In addition to baseball, the stadium had other uses. In particular, it was also used for basketball games. These were played on a convertible basketball court that was stowed away when the basket games were over.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.periodicolaperla.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4336:de-vuelta-el-baloncesto-al-paquito-montaner&amp;catid=91:noticias&amp;Itemid=317 ''Vuelve el baloncesto al Paquito Montaner.''] Junior Lugo Marrero.

==Uses==
The PRPBL's regular playing season runs from November through January. From February to August, the venue is transformed into a [[track and field]] stadium, and also serves as a venue for other activities such as a host of the Mustang Auto Daredevils. It has also been used for [[intramural]] competitions and other academic sporting events.  The track is completely covered during baseball season and then it is elevated via a hydraulic system for the track and field events. The stadium is also used for winter training by many [[Major League Baseball|United States Major Baseball League]] players.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldca.org/newsstoryDec001.htm ''Europipes UK - Going Way Beyond Europe.'' Land Drainage Contractors Association.] Retrieved May 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''exhibition game''' (also known as a '''friendly''', a '''scrimmage''', a '''demonstration''', a '''preseason game''', a '''warmup match''', or a '''preparation match''', depending at least in part on the sport) is a [[sports|sporting event]] whose prize money and impact on the player's or the team's rankings is either zero or otherwise greatly reduced. In team sports, matches of this type are often used to help coaches and managers select and condition players for the competitive matches of a [[Season (sports)|league season]] or tournament. If the players usually play in different teams in other leagues, exhibition games offer an opportunity for the players to learn to work with each other. The games can be held between separate teams or between parts of the same team.

An exhibition game may also be used to settle a challenge, to provide professional entertainment, to promote the sport, to commemorate an anniversary or a famous player, or to raise money for [[Charitable organization|charities]]. Several sports leagues hold [[all-star game]]s to showcase their best players against each other, while other exhibitions games may pit participants from two different leagues or countries to unofficially determine who would be the best in the world. International competitions like the [[Olympic Games]] may also hold exhibition games as part of a [[demonstration sport]].

==Association football==
[[File:Дриблинг Валерия Кечинова.JPG|thumb|228px| Exhibition game]]
In the early days of football, friendlies were the most common type of match. However, since the development of [[The Football League]] in England in 1888, league tournaments became established, in addition to lengthy derby and cup tournaments. By the year 2000, national leagues were established in almost every country throughout the world, as well as local or regional leagues for lower level teams; thus the significance of friendly matches has seriously declined since the 19th century.

===Club football===
Since the introduction of league football, most club sides play a number of friendlies before the start of each season (called pre-season friendlies). Friendly football matches are considered to be non-competitive and are only used to "warm up" players for a new season/competitive match. There is generally nothing competitive at stake and some rules may be changed or experimented with (such as unlimited substitutions, which allow teams to play younger, less experienced, players, and no cards). Frequently such games take place between a large club and small clubs that play nearby, such as those between [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and [[Gateshead F.C.|Gateshead]].

Although most friendlies are simply one-off matches arranged by the clubs themselves, in which a certain amount is paid by the challenger club to the incumbent club, some teams do compete in short tournaments, such as the Community Shield,  [[Emirates Cup]], [[Teresa Herrera Trophy]], [[International Champions Cup]] and the [[Amsterdam Tournament]]. Although these events may involve sponsorship deals and the awarding of a trophy and may even be broadcast on television, there is little prestige attached to them.

===International football===
International teams also play friendlies, generally in preparation for the qualifying or final stages of major tournaments. This is essential, since national squads generally have much less time together in which to prepare. The biggest difference between friendlies at the club and international levels is that international friendlies mostly take place during club league seasons, not between them. This has on occasion led to disagreement between national associations and clubs as to the availability of players, who could become injured or fatigued in a friendly.

International friendlies give team managers the opportunity to experiment with team selection and tactics before the tournament proper, and also allow them to assess the abilities of players they may potentially select for the tournament squad. Players can be booked in international friendlies, and can be suspended from future international matches based on red cards or accumulated yellows in a specified period. [[Cap (sport)|Caps]] and goals scored also count towards a player's career records. In 2004, [[FIFA]] ruled that [[Substitute (football)|substitutions]] by a team be limited to six per match in international friendlies in response to criticism that such matches were becoming increasingly farcical with managers making as many as 11 substitutions per match.

Matches that are being played in multinational football tournaments like [[King's Cup]], [[Kirin Cup]], [[China Cup]] are mostly considered international friendlies by FIFA.

===Fundraising game===
In the UK and Ireland, "exhibition match" and "friendly match" refer to two different types of games. The types described above as friendlies are not termed exhibition matches, while annual [[All-star game|all-star matches]] such as those held in the US [[Major League Soccer]] or Japan's [[J. League|Japanese League]] are called exhibition matches rather than friendly matches. A one-off match for charitable fundraising, usually involving one or two all-star teams, or a match held in honor of a player for contribution to his/her club, may also be described as exhibition matches but they are normally referred to as [[Charity Football Match|charity matches]] and [[testimonial match]]es respectively.

===Bounce game===

[[Exhibition fight]]s were once common in boxing. [[Jack Dempsey]] fought many exhibition bouts after retiring. [[Joe Louis]] fought a charity fight on his rematch with [[Buddy Baer]], but this was not considered an exhibition as it was for Louis' world Heavyweight title.{{relevance inline|date=May 2016}} [[Muhammad Ali]] fought many exhibitions, including one with [[Lyle Alzado]]. In more modern times, [[Mike Tyson]], [[Julio Cesar Chavez Sr.]] and [[Jorge Castro (boxer)|Jorge Castro]] have been involved in exhibition fights.

Although not fought for profit, amateur bouts (usually) and sparring sessions are not considered to be exhibition fights.

==Ice hockey==
Prior to the [[1917–18 NHL season]], an exhibition game was played on December 15, between the [[Montreal Canadiens]] and the [[Montreal Wanderers]]. The game was played as a benefit to aid victims of the [[Halifax Explosion|Halifax explosion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zawadzki|first=Edward|title=The Ultimate Canadian Sports Trivia Book, Volume 1|year=2001|publisher=Dundurn Press|location=Canada|isbn=9780888822376|pages=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[1995–96 NHL season|1995]]–[[2003–04 NHL season|2004]] [[National Hockey League]] [[NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement|collective bargaining agreement]], teams were limited to nine [[preseason]] games. From [[1975–76 NHL season|1975]] to [[1990–91 NHL season|1991]], NHL teams sometimes played exhibition games against teams from the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Super Series]], and in 1978, played against [[World Hockey Association]] teams also in preseason training. Like the NFL, the NHL sometimes schedules exhibition games for cities without their own NHL teams, often at a club's minor league affiliate (e.g. [[Carolina Hurricanes]] games at [[Time Warner Cable Arena]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], home of their AHL affiliate the [[Charlotte Checkers]]; [[Los Angeles Kings]] games at [[Citizens Business Bank Arena]] in [[Ontario, California]], home of their AHL affiliate the [[Ontario Reign]]; [[Montreal Canadiens]] games at [[Colisée Pepsi]] in [[Quebec City]], which has no pro hockey but used to have an NHL team until 1995; [[Washington Capitals]] at [[1st Mariner Arena]] in the [[Baltimore]] Hockey Classic; various Western Canada teams at [[Credit Union Centre]] in [[Saskatoon]], a potential NHL expansion venue). Today, all teams must play six, seven, or eight preseason games. Each preseason game must have at least eight veterans dressed, except during the World Cup of Hockey.

Since the 2000s, some preseason games have been played in Europe against European teams, as part of the [[NHL Challenge]] and NHL Premiere series. In addition to the standard preseason, there also exist prospect tournaments such as the [[Vancouver Canucks]]' YoungStars tournament and the [[Detroit Red Wings]]' training camp, in which NHL teams' younger prospects face off against each other under their parent club's banner.

In [[1992–93 NHL season|1992]], [[goaltender]] [[Manon Rhéaume]] played in a preseason game for the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]], becoming the first woman to suit up for an all-male pro sports team in North America.

The [[Flying Fathers]], a [[Canadians|Canadian]] group of [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priests]], regularly toured North America playing exhibition hockey games for charity. One of the organization's founders, [[Les Costello]], was a onetime NHL player who was ordained as a priest after retiring from professional hockey. Another prominent exhibition hockey team is the [[Buffalo Sabres Alumni Hockey Team]], which is composed almost entirely of retired NHL players, the majority of whom (as the name suggests) played at least a portion of their career for the [[Buffalo Sabres]].

American college hockey teams occasionally play exhibition games against Canadian college teams as well as against USA or Canadian national teams. (In men's hockey, the senior national teams are selected from NHL and other pro players, and college teams would be overmatched against those teams even if they were allowed to play them. However, the [[USA Hockey National Team Development Program|national under-18 teams]] are made up of amateurs, allowing college squads to play them.)

==Baseball==
The [[Major League Baseball]]'s preseason is also known as [[spring training]]. All MLB teams maintain a spring-training base in [[Arizona]] or [[Florida]]. The teams in Arizona make up the [[Cactus League]], while the teams in Florida play in the [[Grapefruit League]]. Each team plays about 30 preseason games against other MLB teams. They may also play exhibitions against a local college team or a [[minor league baseball|minor-league]] team from their farm system. Some days feature the team playing two games with two different rosters evenly divided up, which are known as "split-squad" games.

Several MLB teams used to play regular exhibition games during the year against nearby teams in the other major league, but regular-season [[interleague play]] has made such games unnecessary. The two Canadian MLB teams, the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] of the [[American League]] and the [[Montreal Expos]] of the [[National League]], met annually to contest the [[Pearson Cup]]; this tradition ended when the Expos moved to Washington DC for the [[2005 in baseball|2005 season]]. Similarly, the [[New York Yankees]] played in the [[Mets–Yankees rivalry#Background and formation of Mets|Mayor's Trophy Game]] against various local rivals from 1946 to 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Mayor's_Trophy_Game Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;

It also used to be commonplace to have a team play an exhibition against Minor League affiliates during the regular season, but worries of injuries to players, along with travel issues, have made this very rare. Exhibitions between inter-city teams in different leagues, like Chicago's [[Cubs–White Sox rivalry|Crosstown Classic]] and New York's [[Subway Series]] which used to be played solely as exhibitions for bragging rights are now blended into interleague play. The annual [[MLB All-Star Game]], played in July between players from AL teams and players from NL teams, had long been considered an exhibition match, though between 2003 and 2016 this status was questioned because the league whose team won the All-Star game has been awarded [[home field advantage]] for the upcoming [[World Series]] (prior to 2003 the leagues alternated which one of them had home field advantage; starting in 2017 the team with the better regular season record would be given home field advantage).

Another exhibition game, the [[Doubleday Field#Hall of Fame Game/Classic|Hall of Fame Game/Classic]] which was played in [[Cooperstown, New York]] on the weekend of inductions to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]], was also ended in 2008 due to interleague play and teams playing only substitutes.

==Basketball==

===Professional basketball===
[[National Basketball Association]] teams usually play eight preseason games per year, with the number rarely being lower than seven. Today, NBA teams almost always play each other in the preseason, but often at neutral sites within their market areas in order to allow those who can't usually make a trip to a home team's arena during the regular season to see a game close to home; for instance the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] will play games in arenas in [[North Dakota|North]] and [[South Dakota]], while the [[Phoenix Suns]] schedule one exhibition game outdoors at [[Indian Wells Tennis Garden]] in [[Indian Wells, California]] yearly, the only such instance an NBA game takes place in an outdoor venue.  Exhibition games have been also been held on occasion outside the U.S. and Canada.

However, from 1971 to 1975, NBA teams played preseason exhibitions against [[American Basketball Association (1967-1976)|American Basketball Association]] teams. In the early days of the NBA, league clubs sometimes challenged the legendary [[Barnstorm (sports)|barnstorming]] [[Harlem Globetrotters]], with mixed success. The NBA has played preseason games in Europe and Asia. Beginning in 2015, the league has scheduled [[NBA Africa Game (disambiguation)|NBA Africa Game]]s with players of direct African descent against players from the rest of the league; the NBA has also played against teams in Australia's [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]]. In the 2006 and 2007 seasons, the NBA and the primary European club competition, the [[Euroleague]], conducted [[NBA versus EuroLeague games|a preseason tournament]] featuring two NBA teams and the finalists from that year's Euroleague. In the [[1998–99 NBA season|1998–99]] and [[2011–12 NBA season|2011–12]] seasons, teams were limited to only two preseason games due to lockouts.

The annual [[NBA All-Star Game]] is an exhibition game. 

[[Women's National Basketball Association]] teams play up to three preseasons games per year. WNBA teams will play each other and will also play women's national basketball teams.  Most years, the WNBA also stages an [[WNBA All-Star Game|All-Star Game]], but this game is canceled if pre-empted by major international competitions such as the [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]].

===College basketball===
Traditionally, major [[college basketball]] teams began their seasons with a few exhibition games. They played traveling teams made up of former college players on teams such as [[Athletes in Action]] or a team sponsored by [[Marathon Petroleum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2110667/|title=Crossed Off – They're God's favorite basketball team…of course nobody wants to play them|last=Levin|first=Josh|date=3 December 2004|publisher=Slate|accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion before 1992, when [[International Basketball Federation|FIBA]] allowed professional players on foreign national teams, colleges played those teams in exhibitions. However, in 2003, the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] banned games with non-college teams. Some teams have begun scheduling exhibition games against teams in [[NCAA Division II]] and [[NCAA Division III]], or even against [[list of colleges in Canada|colleges]] and [[list of universities in Canada|universities located in Canada]]. Major college basketball teams still travel to other countries during the summer to play in exhibition games, although a college team is allowed one foreign tour every four years, and a maximum of ten games in each tour.

==American football==

===Professional football===
{{main|National Football League preseason}}
Compared to other team sports, the [[National Football League]] preseason is very structured. Every [[NFL]] team plays exactly four preseason games a year, two at home and two away, with the exception of two teams each year who play a fifth game, the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame Game]]. These exhibition games, most of which are held in the month of August, are played for the purpose of helping coaches narrow down the roster from the offseason limit of 90 players to the regular-season limit of 53 players. While the scheduling formula is not as rigid for preseason games as they are for the regular season, there are numerous restrictions and traditions that limit the choices of preseason opponents; teams are also restricted on what days and times they can play these games. Split-squad games, a practice common in baseball and hockey, where a team that is scheduled to play two games on the same day splits their team into two squads, are prohibited. The NFL has played exhibition games in [[Europe]], [[Japan]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] (including the [[American Bowl]] in 1999) and [[Mexico]] to spread the league's popularity (a game of this type was proposed for [[China]] but, due to financial and logistical problems, was eventually canceled). The league has tacitly forbidden the playing of non-league opponents, with the last interleague game having come in 1972 and the last game against a team other than an NFL team (the all-NFL rookie [[Chicago College All-Star Game|College All-Stars]]) was held in 1976. Exhibition games are quite unpopular with many fans, who resent having to pay regular-season prices for two home exhibition games as part of a season-ticket package. Numerous lawsuits have been brought by fans and classes of fans against the NFL or its member teams regarding this practice, but none have been successful in halting it.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} The [[Pro Bowl]], traditionally played after the end of the NFL season (since 2011 played the week prior to the Super Bowl), is also considered an exhibition game.
 
The [[Arena Football League]] briefly had a two-game exhibition season in the early 2000s, a practice that ended in 2003 with a new television contract. Exhibition games outside of a structured season are relatively common among [[indoor American football]] leagues; because teams switch leagues frequently at that level of play, it is not uncommon to see some of the smaller leagues schedule exhibition games against teams that are from another league, about to join the league as a probational franchise, or a semi-pro outdoor team to fill holes in a schedule.

===College and high school football===
Many [[college football]] teams, particularly larger organizations, play a public intramural exhibition game in the spring mainly to promote the team and give new recruits an early chance at public game action. Many of these intramural games are nationally televised, though not to the same level of prominence as intercollegiate play. In college sports the commonly used term for the major scrimmage at the end of spring practice is the "Spring Game."

True exhibition games between opposing colleges at the highest level do not exist in college football; due to the importance of [[Mythical national championship|opinion polling]] in the top level of college football, even exhibition games would not truly be exhibitions because they could influence the opinions of those polled. Intramural games are possible because a team playing against itself leaves little ability for poll participants to make judgments, and at levels below the [[NCAA Division I#Football Bowl Subdivision|Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS)]], championships are decided by objective formulas and thus those teams can play non-league games without affecting their playoff hopes.

[[High school football]] teams frequently participate in controlled scrimmages with other teams during preseason practice, but full exhibition games are rare because of league rules and concerns about finances, travel and player injuries, along with enrollments not being registered until the early part of August in most school districts under the traditional September–June [[academic term]]. Some states hold preseason events known as "jamborees" in which several pairs of high school football squads take turns playing one half (usually 24 minutes of game time) to give players some experience before the first official game. Another high school football exhibition contest is the [[all-star game]], which usually brings together top players from a region. These games are typically played by graduating seniors after the regular season or in the summer. Many of these games, which include the [[U.S. Army All-American Bowl]] and [[Under Armour All-America Game]], are used as showcases for players to be seen by colleges and increase their [[college recruiting]] profile.

==Canadian football==
Teams in the [[Canadian Football League]] play two exhibition games each year, in June. Exhibition games in the CFL have taken on great importance to coaching staff and players alike in that they are used as a final stage of training camp and regular season rosters are finalized after the exhibition games, which are generally referred to as "pre-season" play.

==Rugby union==

During the amateur era, there were no [[rugby union]] competitions between national teams. Therefore, matches between national teams are never considered "exhibitions" or "friendlies," as they always have [[Test match (rugby union)|Test match]] status.

National teams sometimes play exhibition matches versus invitational teams like the [[Barbarian F.C.]] and [[Barbarian Rugby Club]]. Also, rugby union clubs sometimes play preseason matches.

==Australian rules football==
{{main|Australian rules football exhibition matches}}
{{see also|NAB Cup}}
[[Australian rules football]] has been introduced to a wide range of places around Australia and the world since the code originated in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in 1859. Much of this expansion can be directly attributed to exhibition matches by the major leagues in regions and countries where the code has been played as a [[demonstration sport]].

==Auto racing==
Various auto racing organizations hold exhibition events; these events usually award no championship points to participants, but they do offer prize money to participants. The [[NASCAR Cup Series]] holds two exhibition events annually – the [[Advance Auto Parts Clash]], held at [[Daytona International Speedway]] at the start of the season, and the [[Monster Energy NASCAR All-Star Race|All-Star Race]], held at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] midway through the season. Both events carry a hefty purse of over US$1,000,000. NASCAR has also held exhibition races at [[Suzuka Circuit]] and [[Twin Ring Motegi]] in Japan and [[Calder Park Thunderdome]] in Australia.

Other historical examples of non-championship races include the [[Marlboro Challenge]] in [[Champ Car|IndyCar]] racing and the TOCA Touring Car Shootout in the [[British Touring Car Championship]]. Until the mid-1980s there were a significant number of non-championship [[Formula One]] races.

The [[National Hot Rod Association]] [[Pro Stock]] teams will have a preseason drag meet held before the traditional start in Pomona. The Pro Stock Showdown is a preseason drag meet held for the Pro Stock teams held at The Strip at [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]].

In various sports, a '''forfeit''' is a method in which a match automatically ends and the forfeiting team loses.

There are two distinct forms of forfeiture. One occurs when a team is unable to meet the basic standards for playing the game, either before the game begins or as a result of actions that happen during the match. In such a case, the team not forfeiting wins the match. The other is ''punitive forfeiture'', in which a team has been found to have broken the rules of a sanctioning body during a match they have won and must have the results stricken from the record; whether or not the other team receives a win in such a case depends on the rules of that body.

== Association football ==
Both teams must have at least seven players at the beginning of the match per the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]]. When a team has fewer than seven players, the match cannot start or continue.&lt;ref&gt;[[IFAB]]: [http://www.theifab.com/#!/laws/the-players/chapters/number-of-players ''Laws of the Game 2016/2017''], Law 3&lt;/ref&gt; When the number of players in a team falls definitely below seven (e.g. by five players sent off with [[penalty card#Red card|red cards]], or by injured players with no substitutions left, or a combination of both), the match is forfeited. Forfeits are also used as ''ex post'' disciplinary sanctions by governing bodies.

A forfeited match is handled differently in various competitions; FIFA Disciplinary Code punishes the team sanctioned with a forfeit with a 3–0 loss (but the result on the pitch is upheld if the goal difference at the end of the match was greater than three).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/50/02/75/discoinhalte.pdf|title = FIFA Disciplinary Code|last =|first =|date = 2011|website = FIFA|publisher =|page = 21|access-date = 2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Baseball ==
{{Main|Forfeit (baseball)}}
In rare cases, [[baseball]] games are forfeited, usually in the event when a team is no longer able to play.

{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2014}}

== Basketball ==
In [[basketball]] rules published by FIBA, a forfeit and default are two different things. A team will forfeit if:
* Fifteen minutes after the scheduled starting time, the team is not present or is unable to field five players ready to play.
* Its actions prevent the game from being played.
* It refuses to play after being instructed to do so by the referee.
A forfeit results in loss for the offending team, a score of 20−0, and in tournaments that use the [[FIBA]] points system for standings, 0 points. Furthermore, in FIBA tournaments that use a two-game home-and-away series ([[two-legged tie]]) or a [[best-of-three playoff]] format, a team that forfeits any of the games loses the series by forfeit.

In FIBA tournaments, a forfeit is different from a default, a situation if during the game, the team has fewer than two players (e.g. one or zero players) on the playing court ready to play with no replacements on the bench remaining. In this case, the opponents are awarded with a win, and if they are leading, the score at the time of stoppage will be the final score; if they are not leading, they are awarded with a 2−0 win. Furthermore, in FIBA tournaments that use a two-game home-and-away series, a team that defaults in either game loses the series by default.

In tournaments and leagues that use [[winning percentage]] to rank teams, the difference between a forfeit and a default is negligible; however, for those that use the FIBA points system, a default is treated like an ordinary loss, as the team earns one point. Meanwhile, a team that forfeited earns no points. It is also more detrimental in tiebreaking situations as a defaulting team's worst result is the actual score if they were trailing when the game was stopped, or a 2–0 loss if they were trailing. A forfeit costs a 0–20 loss, and drags down a team's [[goal average]] worse than a 0–2 loss would.

In U.S. [[NCAA]] basketball, a referee decides a game is to be forfeited when any of these criteria are satisfied:
* Any player, squad member or bench personnel fails to comply with any technical-foul penalty or makes a travesty of the game.
* When conditions warrant.
* A team refuses to play after being instructed to do so by an official.
The forfeiting team loses the game 2−0, unless 30 minutes have lapsed in the game clock; in this case, the score at the end of play shall stand. When the team that is behind in the scorebook is to be declared the winning team, that score shall be marked with an asterisk in the official statistics; and it shall be noted that the game was won by forfeit.

The rules of the [[National Basketball Association]] do not mention how forfeitures are dealt with, but mention it is a possible sanction on a player or coach who violates the rules on [[ejection (sports)|ejections]]. Also, in the NBA, defaulting is virtually impossible, unless ejections bring a team to fewer than five players.  When five players remain in a game, and one fouls out, a technical foul is called when a player who has fouled out is forced to remain in the game, or when, after an injury, a player who fouled out of the game previously returns to the game. These technical fouls are declared non-unsportsmanlike conduct fouls, for which no player or coach may be ejected.

== Chess ==
As well as [[checkmate]], [[chess]] games can be [[Rules_of_chess#Resigning|resigned]] or lost on [[Time control|time]], but the term "forfeit" generally has a narrower meaning in the game.

A forfeit occurs when a player does not appear at the match, and is generally a rare occurrence. A notable instance of forfeiture happened in the [[World_Chess_Championship_1972#Game_2:_Fischer_forfeits|second game]] of the [[World_Chess_Championship_1972|1972 World Chess Championship]]. [[Bobby Fisher]], due to disputes over the organisation of the match, refused to show, and the game was recorded as a win for his opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bobby Fischer Forfeits Second Chess Game {{!}} News {{!}} The Harvard Crimson |url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1972/7/14/bobby-fischer-forfeits-second-chess-game/ |accessdate=23 August 2018 |work=The Harvard Crimson |date=14 July 1972 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Additionally, a player caught [[cheating in chess|cheating]] will lose by forfeit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=FIDE/ACP Anti-Cheating Committee |title=Anti-Cheating Guidelines |url=https://www.fide.com/FIDE/handbook/Anti%20Cheating%20Guidelines.pdf |accessdate=23 August 2018 |pages=13 |date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cricket ==
{{Main|Declaration and forfeiture}}
In the sport of [[cricket]] a forfeiture occurs when a captain chooses to forfeit one of his side’s innings.

==Gaelic games==

In the [[Gaelic games]] of [[hurling]], [[Gaelic football]], [[camogie]] and [[ladies' Gaelic football]], a forfeit is called a ''walkover'' ({{Lang-ga|bua gan choimhlint}}). As well as losing the game, the team that gives a walkover in a competition may receive further punishment, such as a fine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leitrimobserver.ie/news/sport/227792/board-to-investigate-increasing-fines-for-clubs-failing-to-field-teams-in-the-league.html|title=Board to investigate increasing fines for clubs failing to field teams in the League|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://meath.gaa.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Rialach%C3%A1in-2016_Regulations.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; deduction of league points or automatic [[relegation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.celbridgegaa.com/gaa/images/pdf/2016-d/Football-League-Rules-2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous walkover in [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] history came in the [[1910 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final]]; the match was scratched and Louth were awarded the championship as Kerry refused to travel to [[Dublin]] for the final because the [[Great Southern and Western Railway]] would not grant fans, players and officials discounted fares for the trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terracetalk.com/articles/Memories/103/The-Kerry-Footballers-Strike-of-1910|title=The Kerry Footballers Strike of 1910|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dundalkdemocrat.ie/news/home/250281/historic-louth-all-ireland-winning-medals-set-to-go-under-the-hammer.html|title=Historic Louth All Ireland-winning medals set to go under the hammer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gridiron football ==
In [[American football]], a team must begin with at least eleven people ready to play; a forfeiture occurs if a team does not have that many. It can also occur when the number of able players drops to below seven (the number legally required to man a [[line of scrimmage]]) at any point during game time, as a result of an [[palpably unfair act|unfair act]], or punitive retroactive sanctions against a team from a governing body such as the [[NCAA]].

In the event the team forfeiting the game is already losing at the time of the forfeit, the score at the time stands as is. Otherwise, forfeits result in a 2-0 score in the [[National Football League]] or a 1-0 score in [[high school football]], [[NCAA]] and [[Canadian football]]. 

In the case of high school and the NCAA, the forfeit is one of only two ways to finish with a score of only one point (the other is if a team's only score comes from a botched [[conversion (gridiron football)|conversion attempt]] that results in their opponent getting backed all the way back into their own end zone).

The [[National Football League]] rulebook has a provision for forfeiture but has never used it (there was at least one alleged "forfeit" in the [[1921 NFL season]], but because league schedules were so fluid in the 1920s and it was never clear who was at fault for the game not being played, the league now considers it a cancellation, which was very common at the time). Former NFL commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] noted that he had never used the league's forfeit provisions and would never change the result of a game after the fact, a stance that prevented the result of the [[Snowplow Game]], a game that had been decided on an acknowledged but unpunished unfair act, from being forfeited. It was briefly discussed as a potential punishment during [[2007 National Football League videotaping controversy|Spygate]] but never implemented. 

The NCAA also uses punitive forfeiture in other sports. The [[Arena Football League]] has had one forfeit in its history, which came in [[2012 Arena Football League season|2012]] as a result of a player's strike. In another case in [[2015 Arena Football League season|2015]], two teams ceased operations prior to the end of the season, and because they were both slated to play each other, the game was recorded as a scoreless tie.

A related concept is the ''vacation'', in which the team's wins are stricken from the record, but no loss is put in its place, and a team that lost in a game where the win was later vacated is still counted as a loss. The NCAA bylaws allow wins to be vacated as a form of punishment; the NFL does not.

== Poker ==
In cases where a poker game is arranged but an opponent drops out, that person forfeits and remaining players win at that player's expense.

The final of the '''women's artistic team all-around''' competition at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] was held at the [[North Greenwich Arena 1|North Greenwich Arena]], London on 31 July 2012. Eight teams of five gymnasts competed in the final from a total of twelve teams which have qualified for the Games.

The '''Inverness Highland Games''' (official name: ''City of Inverness Highland Games''), is a [[Highland games]] event in the city of [[Inverness]] in the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]]. The modern Games at Inverness have their origin in meetings held in 1821. That year, the ''[[Inverness Courier]]'' reported that fundraising was taking place in the town by members of the [[Northern Meeting|Northern Meeting Society]] in order to revive the ancient traditions and to bring a Highland games event to the capital of the Highlands. The Games took place in October 1822 at the end of a summer which saw numerous Highland Gatherings taking place across Scotland as part of the celebrations that were being held to mark the visit by King George IV. The 1822 Games held in Inverness were called a "True Highland Games" and featured three cows killed by sledgehammer in order for a competition to take place between teams of men to see who could pull a leg off one of the unfortunate animals the fastest and win a prize of five guineas. The 1822 Games also featured an unknown Stonemason pushing a 252 pound weight over a bar suspended 5 feet above the ground; and this unique challenge was revived in 2013 much to the delight of the modern crowd of Games fans

In 2006 Inverness hosted the Masters World Championships which was being held in Europe for the first time. In 2007 Inverness hosted the [[World Highland Games Heavy Championships]] which was being staged on Scottish soil for the first time since it was staged in [[Kilmarnock]] in 1995. The World Championship was won by [[Gregor Edmunds]] of Scotland with [[Larry Brock]] and [[Ryan Vierra]] of the USA finishing in second and third positions. In 2009 the Masters World Championships returned to Inverness for the second time and took place the week before "The Gathering" celebrations organised as the centre piece of Scotland's Year of Homecoming.

==Organisation==

From 1822 to 1938 the Highland Games staged in Inverness were organised by the members of Northern Meeting.

Northern Meeting Park was the venue for Highland Games organised in Inverness by the Northern Meeting Society from 1864 to 1938. In July 1939 the Northern Meeting Society decided that they wished to stop organising the Games after losing money for nine years. It was agreed that the Inverness Shopkeepers Association would be invited to take over the running of the Games but plans for a September 1939 event was abandoned as a result of the outbreak of the Second World War. The Games were staged in Northern Meeting Park for a final time in 1948 before it was decided that they would be moved to Bught Park. Today the Games are organised by the Highland Council in partnership with a Committee of volunteers. In 2010 the Games returned to the smaller Northern Meeting Park in preparation for celebrations to mark the 150th Anniversary of the World's oldest Highland Games stadium in 2014.

The 2014 celebrations featured two Highland Games in the same year for the first time with the regular Games staged in July and the Masters World Championships hosted in September. The September Games featured more Heavies than any other Games in history with 157 athletes from 14 countries taking part. The September Games ended with a Guinness World Record for Simultaneous Caber Tossing being established with 66 of the 110 Cabers thrown being successfully launched into the air at the same time and turning correctly. The return to Northern Meeting Park was a huge success but the following year the Games returned to Bught Park where it is now based.

'''Kansas Coliseum''' was an entertainment complex in the [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] suburb of [[Valley Center, Kansas]]. It is located southeast of [[I-135]] and 85th Street North in the north Wichita metro area.

It hosted sporting events, concerts, shows, and consisted of four pavilions, one RV park and the 9,686-seat '''Britt Brown Arena''', named for Harry Britton (Britt) Brown Jr., of Wichita, the former owner of ''[[The Wichita Eagle]]'' newspaper. Arena capacity could be configured for up to 12,200 people.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.360wichita.com/Attractions/KansasColiseum.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansas.com/news/local/news-local-obituaries/article8570324.html Britt Brown, former publisher of The Wichita Eagle, dies; The Wichita Eagle; January 29, 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It was opened in 1977. Two brass plaques (one located on the lower level, by the box office windows and the other up on the main concourse) read:

"Dedicated September 1978, for the promotion of agricultural educational and cultural benefits, in behalf of the people of the world, by the citizens of Sedgwick County, the board of the county commissioners, the [[Kansas State Park and Resources Authority]], the [[Economic Development Administration]] and the ozark regional commission of the United States Department of Commerce and the Kansas Coliseum Corporation."

It hosted NCAA Men's Basketball tournament first and second-round games in 1981 and 1994. The [[Wichita State University]] basketball teams played the 2002-03 season there while the Shockers' on-campus home, [[Charles Koch Arena]], was undergoing major renovations.

It was the home of the now-defunct [[Wichita Wings]] indoor soccer team, who played in the MISL and NPSL between 1979 and 2001. The Kansas Coliseum was the home venue for the [[Wichita Stealth]], [[Wichita Aviators]], and [[Wichita Wild]] indoor/arena football teams between 2001-2008. It also was home to the [[Wichita Thunder]] ice hockey team that played in the Coliseum from 1992 to 2009. The Wichita Thunder now plays in the [[INTRUST Bank Arena]] in downtown Wichita, Kansas.

The last Wichita Thunder hockey game ever played at the Kansas Coliseum was on January 9, 2010 in front of a home crowd of 5,556.  The Thunder lost the game 3-1 to the Odessa Jackalopes.  Brent Ottmann would be the last Thunder player to score a goal in the building at 2:05 of the 1st period, and Kenny Bernard of Odessa scoring the last goal ever at 19:53 of the 3rd period.

The final event to take place inside the Arena was the RV and Boat show on February 20, 2010.   As of February 22, 2010, The Britt Brown Arena closed its doors.  The neighboring [[Kansas Pavilions]] will remain open until at least 2016, but the arena will no longer host events.  Power will remain to the building, but water has been shut off and the pipes drained.

On January 10, 2012 the entire Coliseum complex was sold by Sedgwick County to aviation research developer Johnny Stevens for a sum of $1,462,487.12.  The Britt Brown Arena will be transformed into an aerospace testing facility, and surrounding Pavilions and RV park will continue to be operated until January 1, 2016 and possibly beyond should the events be profitable.  The complex is now privately owned and all Sedgwick County signing has been removed.  The complex will now operate as Kansas Coliseum LLC.

'''Kolodruma''' ({{lang-bg|Колодрума}}) is a [[velodrome]] and a multifunctional [[indoor arena]] located in [[Plovdiv]], Bulgaria. It has a [[seating capacity]] of 4,800 to 7,500 spectators depending on its use. It is built on the place of the former track cycling velodrome in [[Plovdiv]] and currently is the only indoor velodrome in [[Bulgaria]] and the largest one on the [[Balkans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sofiaecho.com/2008/11/27/665101_most-modern-velodrome-in-balkans-to-be-built-in-plovdiv Most modern velodrome in Balkans to be built in Plovdiv]&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides cycling events the arena can host additional 22 types of sports and can serve as concert's hall. The complex has also [[underground parking]] facility for 300 vehicles, a modern press centre, dressing rooms, coaching facilities, a sports-recreational centre, restaurants and a large commercial centre for a wide variety of sports merchandise and kit.

The architect of the project is the Dutch [[Sander Douma]], who has previously created the largest-known velodromes in Europe, notably the facilities in [[Athens]], [[Monte Carlo]], [[Palma de Majorca]], and [[Manchester]] amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://metalstroy-ams.com/en/project/sport-hall-covered-velodrome Sport hall – covered Velodrome]&lt;/ref&gt;

The arena was officially opened on 30 August 2015 by the presence of numerous government officials and Bulgarian sports celebrities.

This page gives an overview of well-known [[Go professional|professional]] and amateur '''players''' of the '''[[Go (game)|game of Go]]''' throughout the ages. The page has been divided into sections based on the era in which the Go players played and the country in which they played. As this was not necessarily their country of birth, a flag of that country precedes every player's name. For a complete list of player articles, see [[:Category:Go players]].

The important dates that this separation is based on are:
* The establishment of the [[Four go houses]] at the start of the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]].
* The demise of the houses in the [[Meiji Period]] (end 19th century) followed by their replacement by the [[Nihon Kiin]] in 1924.
* The start of international tournament Go in 1989

A Japanese census on Go players performed in 2002 estimates that over 24 million people worldwide play Go,&lt;ref name=census&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fin.ne.jp/~igo/census.htm  | title = Census of Go players worldwide (in Japanese) |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20021217041220/http://www.fin.ne.jp/~igo/census.htm |archivedate = 2002-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of whom live in Asia. Most of the players listed on this page are professionals, though some top level amateurs have been included. Players famous for achievements outside Go are listed in their own section.

==17th through 19th century==
In the 17th, 18th and 19th century, Go was popular in both Japan ([[Edo period]]) and China (period of the [[Qing Dynasty]]). In Korea, a Go variant called [[Go variants#Sunjang Baduk|Sunjang baduk]] was played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/orient/go/history/sunjang.html |title=Historic: Sunjang Go |author=John Fairbairn |accessdate=2007-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060305195431/http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/orient/go/history/sunjang.html |archivedate=2006-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
At the start of the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]], four [[Four go houses|Go academies]] were established. This table lists all heads of these houses, as well as some that were appointed heir but died before they became head of the house. Tokugawa also established the post of [[Godokoro]] (minister of Go), which was awarded to the strongest player of a generation. Such players were dubbed [[Meijin]] (brilliant man), which was considered equal to a 9 dan professional grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://senseis.xmp.net/?HistoricMeijin | author = Sensei's Library | title = Historic Meijins | accessdate = 2007-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the 300-year period covered here, only ten players received the title of Meijin. Several other players (16 total) received the title of [[Jun-Meijin]] (half-Meijin), which is considered to equal an 8 dan professional grade and listed as such below. In some houses it was the custom that the head of the house was always named the same according to the [[iemoto]] system (家元). All heads of the house [[Inoue]] (井上) were named Inseki (因碩), heads of the house [[Yasui house|Yasui]] (安井 ) were named [[Yasui house|Senkaku]] (仙角) from the 4th head onward, and heads of the house [[Hayashi]] (林) were named [[Monnyu]] (門入) from the second head onward. To distinguish between these players, the names listed below are the names they had before becoming head of their house, or after their retirement. The house [[Honinbo]] (本因坊) had no such tradition, although heads would often take one character from the name of their predecessor into their own name, notably the character Shu (秀) from the 14th head onward.

&lt;small&gt;*Players could achieve the level of [[Guoshou]] (literally National Hand), which is best in the nation and ranked 1 pin 品. This title is a derivation of Mencius description of Yi Qiu (弈秋), Qiu the Yi player in 《孟子·告子章句上》: 今夫弈之为数，小数也。不专心致志，则不得也。弈秋，通国之善弈者也。使弈秋诲二人弈，其一人专心致志，惟弈秋之为听；一人虽听之，一心以为有鸿鹄将至，思援弓缴而射之，虽与俱学，弗若之矣！as being "通国之善弈者", literally the finest Yi player of the whole nation. It is considered to be equal to the Japanese title of [[Meijin]]. 
The term Qi Sheng (棋圣) was first mentioned by Ge Hong (葛洪) in 《抱朴子》：“棋之无敌者，则谓之棋圣。” The literal meaning is the Invincible Qi player is called the Saint of Qi (Qi Sheng). 
Note that both Guoshou and Qisheng were not tournament winner titles; instead they were honorific titles used by Wei Qi players and historians respectively to refer to the best players who were invincible in highest graded tournaments. Guoshou was the normal term used to refer to the promo player while he was alive, whereas Qisheng was used more as posthumous fame. 
The ranking of players began in [[West Han Dynasty]] (2nd century BCE) and formally recognized by the Governments during the [[North and South Dynasties Period]] (3rd to 6th century CE). There were 9 ranks called pin 品 in the system,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} the same as the ranking system for government officials. The lowest rank was 9 pin, then 8 pin, etc. up to 1 pin.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The difference of the lower 5 pin was about 1 zi (子, piece or stone), and the difference between the top 4 pin was half zi.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}  &lt;/small&gt;

The '''Long Branch Stakes''' is an American [[Thoroughbred horse race]] held annually at [[Monmouth Park Racetrack]] in [[Oceanport, New Jersey]]. Open to three-year-olds, it is contested on dirt over a distance of {{frac|1|1|16}} miles (8.5 [[furlong]]s). Raced in mid July, the Long Branch Stakes is a prep race for the $1 million [[Haskell Invitational Handicap]] in early August.

First run in 1878, it was raced annually through 1893 after which the race track closed its gates.  The race was revived in 1947 as the '''Long Branch Handicap''' following the 1946 reopening of the new Monmouth Park.  There was no race from 1959 to 1962. In 1963 it was restarted as the Long Branch Stakes.  In 2013 the race will be in its 79th running.

[[Fort Marcy (horse)|Fort Marcy]] won this race in 1967, the [[filly]] [[De La Rose]] in 1981.

'''Masters Rugby League''' is a derivative of [[rugby league]] for a wide age range of older, semi-retired and non-competitive players and officials.&lt;ref name="Masters of Rugby League - Introduction"&gt;{{cite news| title = Masters of Rugby League - Introduction| url = http://www.mastersrugbyleague.com/index.htm| publisher = Masters of Rugby League New Zealand Inc.| date = | accessdate = 18 June 2008| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080705202819/http://www.mastersrugbyleague.com/index.htm| archivedate = 5 July 2008| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Masters Rugby League started in Brisbane Australia (South East Queensland Masters Rugby League inc which is still played today) and [[New Zealand]] in 1992 and has since grown in popularity, spreading to Australia and more recently to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Derivatives: Masters Rugby League"&gt;{{cite news| title = Derivatives: Masters Rugby League| url = http://www.therfl.co.uk/community/page.php?id=388&amp;areaid=140| publisher = The Rugby Football League| date = | accessdate = 18 June 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
The Masters of Rugby League New Zealand states, "Masters Rugby League is the game for a lifetime, for semi-retired players and officials".&lt;ref name="Masters of Rugby League - Introduction" /&gt; The Masters derivative of rugby league aimed to extend the playing, and officiating, life of people.

In 2008, in the United Kingdom the [[Rugby Football League]] (RFL) noted that there were only 2,000 registered club players aged 30 or over.&lt;ref name="Derivatives: Masters Rugby League" /&gt; This illustrates how the physical nature of competitive rugby league lends itself to being a young person's sport.&lt;ref name="Derivatives: Masters Rugby League"/&gt;

==History==
Masters Rugby League started in [[New Zealand]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="Derivatives: Masters Rugby League"/&gt; Masters Rugby League in New Zealand has seen a growth in the number of teams since then as clubs became more aware of this grade. [[Sport and Recreation New Zealand|SPARC's]] Push Play campaign, promoting the benefits of physical activity has also had an impact.&lt;ref name="Masters of Rugby League - Introduction" /&gt;

Participants must be aged over 35 and have retired from competitive rugby.

==Rule modifications==
Rugby league's ''[[Laws of rugby league|Laws of the Game]]'' apply except for amendments made by the governing bodies. There are slight differences between those adopted in New Zealand and the United Kingdom and the rules operated in Australia but the general modifications are the same and aim to reduce the physicality of the game, with "Rough and over vigorous play" not being condoned, and to reduce the amount of running, for example the defence must only retreat 5 metres at the play-the-ball and there is no running from dummy half.&lt;ref name="Masters of Rugby League Rules"&gt;{{cite news|title=Masters of Rugby League Rules |url=http://www.mastersrugbyleague.com/rules.htm |publisher=Masters of Rugby League New Zealand Inc. |date= |accessdate=18 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705202731/http://www.mastersrugbyleague.com/rules.htm |archivedate=5 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Masters players are divided by age, this being signified through the use of different coloured shorts. Physical contact is restricted or removed in both attack and defence for individual players based on these colours. The younger players can tackle normally, if older players are involved in the tackle it may be completed by a two-handed hold or by a touch.

'''Nikolai Nikolayevich Ozerov''' ({{lang-ru|Николай Николаевич Озеров}}; 11 December 1922 – 2 June 1997) was a Soviet tennis player and actor, who was best known as a leading sports commentator of the Soviet Union in the 1950s–80s.&lt;ref name=tennis/&gt; He was awarded the [[Olympic Order]] in 1992 and inducted to the [[IIHF Hall of Fame]] in 2016.

==Biography==
[[File:Vvedenskoye - Nikolai Ozerov 02.jpg|thumb|Nikolai and Yuri Ozerov's tombstone.]]
Ozerov was born to the opera singer [[:ru:Озеров, Николай Николаевич (певец)|Nikolai Ozerov Sr.]]; his mother Nadezhda trained as a stage actress, but abandoned her career to raise her two sons. His elder brother [[Yuri Ozerov (director)|Yuri]] became a prominent film director, and his great-grandfather [[:ru:Виноградов, Михаил Александрович|Mikhail Vinogradov]] was a notable 19th century composer. In the 1930s–60s Ozerov was a leading Soviet tennis player, and won 24 Soviet titles in singles and doubles between 1940 and 1963.&lt;ref name=tennis/&gt; During [[World War II]], when the German army approached Moscow, Ozerov and a few remaining in Moscow tennis players were commissioned to play a long series of exhibition matches in various parts of the city. Those matches were enthusiastically covered by radio reports to raise the people's spirit.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

In 1941 Ozerov enrolled to the acting department of [[GITIS]], and after graduating in 1946 joined the [[Moscow Art Theater]], where he played more than 20 roles. He was also featured as a sports commentator in 13 movies, such as [[The Hockey Players (film)|''The Hockey Players'']] and ''[[O, Sport, You – the Peace!]]''&lt;ref name=family/&gt;&lt;ref name=imdb/&gt;

His sports commentator career began on 29 August 1950, when he had his first solo report of the association football match [[Dynamo Moscow]] vs. [[PFC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]]. The report was met with a positive feedback from the radio listeners, and in the early 1950s Ozerov semi-retired from tennis to devote himself to commentator's work;&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; though he continued to win Soviet titles until 1963.&lt;ref name=tennis/&gt; As a commentator Ozerov covered [[ice hockey]] at 15 Olympics and 30 world championships, and football at 8 World Cups and 6 European championships, visiting approximately 50 countries.&lt;ref name=family/&gt; He also trained newcoming sports commentators such as [[Vladimir Maslachenko]], [[Vladimir Pereturin]], [[Yevgeni Mayorov]] and [[Anna Dmitrieva]].&lt;ref name=bio2/&gt;&lt;ref name=tennis/&gt;

Ozerov was forced to retire in 1988 as a result of competition on the Soviet television and radio. After that between 1992 and 1996 he served as chairman of the sports society [[Spartak (sports society)|Spartak]],&lt;ref name=tennis/&gt; for which he previously played tennis and football.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;&lt;ref name=tennis/&gt; In the 1990s, he had his foot amputated after a [[scorpion]] bite, and rarely left his house after that. Leg inflammation due to the bite, combined with [[diabetes]], eventually resulted in his death on 2 June 1997. He was buried at the [[Vvedenskoye Cemetery]] in Moscow.&lt;ref name=family/&gt;&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

==Personal life==
Ozerov married aged 47, though he knew his wife since the age of 31. They had twins Nikolai and Nadezhda. Nikolai was a promising tennis player, but had to retire after a leg injury, which he received in a failed parachute jump while serving in the Soviet Army.&lt;ref name=family/&gt; Nadezhda received the IIHF Hall of Fame awards on behalf of her deceased father in 2016.&lt;ref name=bio2/&gt;

[[File:Tims toyota center az.jpg|thumb|alt=Tim's Toyota Center|Tim's Toyota Center before an Arizona Sundogs hockey game]]The '''Prescott Valley Event Center''' (formerly '''Tim's Toyota Center''' and originally built as the '''Prescott Valley Convention &amp; Events Center''') is a 5,100-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] located at 3201 North Main Street in [[Prescott Valley, Arizona]].

Since opening in November 2006, it is home to a variety of [[Arizona Interscholastic Association]] basketball and wrestling competitions; for instance, in 2011, it hosted the 1A and 2A Conference semifinal and finals games and the 3A Conference quarterfinals. It has also hosted a few [[monster truck]] shows.

The arena hosted the [[American Indoor Football]]'s [[Arizona Outlaws (AIF)|Arizona Outlaws]] in 2012 and the [[Central Hockey League]]'s [[Arizona Sundogs]] from 2006 to 2014.

Tim's Toyota, a [[Toyota]] dealership in Prescott with used car lots in Prescott Valley and Chino Valley, paid an undisclosed sum to be [[naming rights|the corporate sponsor and namesake]] of the arena.  That deal expired on September 30, 2014, with the arena reverting to the Prescott Valley Event Center name.&lt;ref name="byetim"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dcourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=1&amp;SubSectionID=1086&amp;ArticleID=136713 | title=Event center name change takes effect | publisher=The Daily Courier | date=October 1, 2014 | accessdate=November 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The only arena of its size between [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], other than the [[Walkup Skydome]] in Flagstaff, it is northern Arizona's sports and entertainment venue.

Among its amenities are 24 luxury suites (including two party suites), 400 club seats and parking for 3,000 cars. The arena accommodates up to 6,200 for concerts.

==Events==
The venue has hosted well-known bands such as [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], [[Godsmack]], [[Breaking Benjamin]], [[Three Doors Down]], and [[ZZ Top]]. It hosted its first-ever [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] event on July 29, 2007. Also, when the fair comes, the inside of the arena is used as a display.

The venue also hosted a high-profile college basketball game on November 30, 2011, when Brigham Young University faced Northern Arizona.

On April 11, 2016, it was announced that the [[Phoenix Suns]] would own their affiliate in the [[NBA G League|NBA Development League]], the [[Northern Arizona Suns]], after the purchasing the Bakersfield Jam, relocating the team from [[Bakersfield, California]], to [[Prescott Valley, Arizona|Prescott Valley]] for the 2016–17 season.

On October 4, 2016, presidential candidate and eventual president [[Donald Trump]] gave a speech at the Prescott Valley Event Center.

[[File:Petanque-marseille-2017.jpg|427x427px|The sport of Pétanque being played in Marseille|alt=|thumb]]
'''Pétanque''' ({{IPA-fr|petɑ̃k}}; {{lang-oc|petanca}} {{IPA-oc|peˈtaŋkɔ|}}) is a sport that falls into the category of [[boules]] sports, along with [[Raffa (boules)|raffa]], [[bocce]], boule lyonnaise, [[Bowls|lawn bowls]] and [[Crown green bowls|crown green bowling]]. All of these sports share something in common, in that players or teams play their boules/balls towards a target ball. 

In Pétanque the objective is to score points by having boules closer to the target than your opponent after all boules have been thrown. This is achieved by projecting boules closer to the target, called a cochonnet,&lt;ref&gt;The cochonnet is also sometimes called a ''bouchon'' (literally "little ball", from the [[Occitan]] ''bochon'') or ''le petit'' ("the small one").&lt;/ref&gt; or by hitting the opponents' boules away from the target, while standing inside a circle with both feet on the ground. 

The game is normally played on hard dirt or gravel.  It can be played in public areas in parks, or in dedicated facilities called ''boulodromes''.

[[File:Dscn0054-boules-in-action 600x800.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Pétanque players on the beach in [[Nice]].]]

The current form of the game originated in 1907 or 1910 in [[La Ciotat]], in [[Provence]], France. The French name ''pétanque'' (borrowed into English, with or without the acute accent) comes from ''petanca'' in the [[Provençal dialect]] of the [[Occitan]] language, deriving from the expression ''pès tancats'' {{IPA|[ˈpɛs taŋˈkats]}}, meaning 'feet fixed' or 'feet planted' (on the ground).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://petanque.wordpress.com/2014/09/20/origin-of-word-petanque/|title=Terminology – Origin of the word pétanque|date=21 September 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Invention of the game ===
Boules games has [[Boules#Boules_games_in_history| a very long history]], dating back through the Middle Ages to ancient Rome, and before that to ancient Greece and Egypt.

In France in the second half of the 19th century a form of boules known as [[Jeu Provençal|''jeu provençal'']] (or ''boule lyonnaise'') was extremely popular.  In this form of the game players rolled their boules or ran three steps before throwing a boule.  Pétanque originally developed as an offshoot or variant of  ''jeu provençal'' in 1910, in what is now called the ''Jules Lenoir Boulodrome'' in the town of [[La Ciotat]] near Marseilles.  A former ''jeu provençal'' player named Jules Lenoir was afflicted by  rheumatism so severe that he could no longer run before throwing a boule.  In fact, he could barely stand. A good friend named Ernest Pitiot was a local café owner.  In order to accommodate his friend Lenoir, Pitiot developed a variant form of the game in which the length of the pitch or field was reduced by roughly half, and a player, instead of running to throw a boule, stood, stationary, in a circle. They called the game ''pieds tanqués'', "feet planted" (on the ground), a name that eventually evolved into the game's current name, ''pétanque''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Charles |last=Giol |title=La pétanque |work=Historia |date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first pétanque tournament was organized by Ernest Pitiot, along with his brother Joseph Pitiot, in 1910 in La Ciotat. After that the game spread quickly and soon became the most popular form of boules in France.

Before the mid-1800s, European boules games were played with solid wooden balls, usually made from boxwood root, a very hard wood. The late 1800s saw the introduction of cheap mass-manufactured nails, and wooden boules gradually began to be covered with nails, producing ''boules cloutées'' ("nailed boules").  After World War I, cannonball manufacturing technology was adapted to allow the manufacture of hollow, all-metal boules.   The first all-metal boule, ''la Boule Intégrale'', was introduced in the mid-1920s by Paul Courtieu.  The ''Intégrale'' was cast in a single piece from a bronze-aluminum alloy.  Shortly thereafter Jean Blanc invented a process of manufacturing steel boules by stamping two steel blanks into hemispheres and then welding the two hemispheres together to create a boule.  With this technological advance, hollow all-metal balls rapidly became the norm.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://petanque.wordpress.com/2012/08/26/the-birth-of-petanque The Birth of Petanque]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global spread of the game ===
After the development of the all-metal boule, pétanque spread rapidly from Provence to the rest of France, then to the rest of Europe, and then to Francophone colonies and countries around the globe. Today, many countries have their own national governing bodies.

[[Image:Pétanque players in Cannes (France) 2003.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Pétanque players in [[Cannes]]]]In France, the ''Fédération Française de Pétanque et Jeu Provençal'' ([https://web.archive.org/web/20180306223901/http://ffpjp.net/  FFPJP]) has more than 300,000 licensed members.

There are strong national federations in [http://www.petanque-dpv.de/ Germany], [http://www.fepetanca.com/ Spain], and [http://www.englishpetanque.org.uk/ England].  Petanque is actively played in many nations with histories of [[French colonialism|French colonial]] influence, especially in [[Southeast Asia]], including [[Laos]], [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Puducherry, India]], as well as some parts of Africa.  Today, some of the strongest players in the world come from [http://www.kanetystar.com/ Madagascar] and [http://www.pongpansport.com/index.php%3Fmo%3D59%26id%3D962324&amp;usg=ALkJrhiOtnRRHigbCgbcyCzWZSqsht8TDQ Thailand].

Pétanque was featured at the [[2015 All-Africa Games]], which were hosted by the [[Republic of Congo]], a former French colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Okamba|first1=Louis|last2=Imray|first2=Gerald|title=All Africa Games return to roots in Republic of Congo|url=http://www.timesunion.com/sports/article/All-Africa-Games-return-to-roots-in-Republic-of-6486997.php|website=Times Union|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petanque is not widely played in the Americas.  There is a [http://www.petanquecanada.com/ Canadian petanque federation] based in [[Québec]]. In the United States the Federation of Petanque USA [http://www.fpusa.org (FPUSA)] reports that about 30,000 play nationwide. As of December 1, 2015, FPUSA counted 2141 members in the US, in 52 affiliated clubs.&lt;ref&gt;FPUSA 2015/16. Annual Publication of the Federation of Petanque, USA&lt;/ref&gt;

On the international level, the [[Sport governing body|governing body]] of petanque is the ''Fédération Internationale de Pétanque et Jeu Provençal'' ([http://www.fipjp.com FIPJP]).  It was founded in 1958 in [[Marseille]] and has about 600,000 members in 52 countries {{as of|2002|lc=y}}.

'''In popular culture''': The game makes an appearance in the 1966 French crime film ''Le deuxieme souffle''.

=== National and international competitions ===
There are a number of important world championship tournaments.

The [[Pétanque World Championships|FIPJP world championships]] take place every two years.  Men's championships are held in even-numbered years, while Women's and Youth championships are held in odd-numbered years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fipjp.com/en/world-championships ''Les Championnats du Monde de Pétanque ''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215041507/http://www.fipjp.com/en/world-championships |date=2012-12-15 }} at the FIPJP web site.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the best-known international championship is the ''[[Mondial la Marseillaise à Pétanque]]'', which takes place every year in [[Marseille, France]], with more than 10,000 participants and more than 150,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.flyprovence.com/en/Mondial_La_Marseillaise_a_Petanque_-agenda-sports-215-13.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-03-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323224900/http://www.flyprovence.com/en/Mondial_La_Marseillaise_a_Petanque_-agenda-sports-215-13.html |archive-date=2014-03-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest annual tournament in the United States is the [http://ameliaisland.com/petanque Petanque Amelia Island Open] (formerly the Petanque America Open), held in each year in November at [[Amelia Island, Florida]].

[http://labritishopenpetanque.uk/ La British Open] is a major Pétanque tournament held in the North of England, in the [[United Kingdom]]. So far, this attracts players from across the UK and Europe.  

Pétanque is not currently an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] sport, although the [[Confédération Mondiale des Sports de Boules]] &amp;mdash; which was created in 1985 by several international boules organizations specifically for this purpose &amp;mdash; has been lobbying the Olympic committee since 1985 to make it part of the summer Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fipjp.com/en/modern_history History of the FIPJP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810000056/http://www.fipjp.com/en/modern_history |date=2012-08-10 }} at the FIPJP web site.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://petanque.wordpress.com/cmsb/|title=CMSB|date=7 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing the game==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}

===Equipment ===
Pétanque is played by two teams, where each team consists of one, two, or three players.

In the singles and doubles games each player plays with three metal boules.  In triples each player uses only two.

The area where a pétanque game is played is called a ''terrain''.  A game can be played in an open area like a public park, where the boundaries of the terrain are not marked, or more formally on a "marked terrain" where the terrain boundaries are marked (traditionally, by strings tightly strung between nails driven into the ground).

[[File:Petanque - throwing from the circle.jpg|thumb|Pétanque player throwing from a prefabricated circle]]
In pétanque, players throw while standing in a circle.  Traditionally, the circle was simply scratched in the dirt.  Starting around 2005, red plastic "prefabricated" circles were introduced and are now widely used in formal games.  A circle drawn on the ground must be {{Convert|35-50|cm||abbr=on}} in diameter, while a plastic circle must have an inside diameter of {{Convert|50|cm||abbr=on}}.

===The "ends"===
A game consists of several ''mènes''.  The French word ''mène'' is usually translated into English as "end" or "round".

An end consists of the throwing out of the jack (the little wooden target ball), followed by the two teams throwing their boules.

After both teams have thrown all of their boules, the team with the boule closest to the jack wins the end.  The winning team scores one point for each of its boules that is closer than the opposing team's closest boule.  That means that the winning team could in theory score as many as six points in an end, although a score of one or two points is more typical.

As the game progresses, each team accumulates points until one of the teams reaches 13, the winning number of points.

===Order of play===

A game begins with a coin toss to determine which team plays first.  The team that wins the toss begins the game by placing the circle, then standing in the circle and throwing the jack to a distance of {{Convert|6-10|m|}}. A player from the team that threw the jack, throws the first boule. Then a player from the opposing team throws a boule.

From that point on, the team with the boule that is closest to the jack is said to "have the point". The team that does not have the point, throws the next boule. That team continues to throw boules until it either gains the point, or runs out of boules.

If at any point the closest boules from each team are equidistant from the jack, then the team that threw the last boule throws again. If the boules are still equidistant then the teams play alternately until the tie is broken. If the boules are still equidistant at the end of the ''mène'' then neither team scores any points.

The team that won the end, starts the next end. A player from the winning team places (or draws) a circle around the jack. He/she then picks up the jack, stands in the circle, and throws the jack to start the next end.

===Scoring=== 
[[Image:Petanque scoring example 1 point.png|thumb|left|Team Red has the boule closest to the jack, but the second-closest boule belongs to Team Blue.  Red scores one point.  Blue scores nothing.]][[Image:Petanque scoring example 2 points.png|thumb|right|Team Red has two boules closer than Team Blue's closest boule.  Red scores two points. Blue scores nothing.]] An end is complete when both teams have played all of their boules, or when the jack is knocked out of play (goes "dead").

If the end finishes in the usual way—with the jack still alive and one team with the closest boule—then the team with the closest boule wins the end and scores one point for each of its boules that is closer to the jack than other team's closest boule.

If the jack is alive but there is an "equidistant boules" situation at the end of the mène, then neither team scores any points.  If the jack is dead at the finish of the end, then if one (and only one) team still has boules left to play, that team scores one point for each boule that it still has in hand. Otherwise neither team scores any points in the end (like an inning in baseball in which neither team scores any runs).

{{clear}}

===Miscellaneous rules===

*Boules can be thrown in any way that the player wishes, but the traditional way is to hold the boule with the palm of the hand downwards, and then to throw with an under-arm swing of the arm ending in an upward flick of the wrist.  Throwing this way puts backspin on the boule and gives the player the maximum amount of control and flexibility when throwing.
*The boule can be rolled, thrown to a moderate height, or even thrown to a great height (a high lob or ''portée'').
*Players usually carry a tape measure for measuring close points.
*At the beginning of an end, before throwing the jack, if there isn't enough room for the player to throw the jack to the maximum legal distance of {{Convert|10|m|}}, then the player is allowed to move the circle back to a point where there ''is'' enough room.
*On a terrain with boundaries marked with strings, a boule or jack must ''completely'' cross the boundary string before it is considered to be out-of-bounds and dead.

=== Boules ===
'''Leisure boules''' are boules that do not meet the FIPJP standards for competition boules, but are less expensive than competition boules and completely adequate for "backyard" games.  Unlike competition boules, leisure boules are a "one size fits all" affair &amp;mdash; they come in one weight and size.

'''Competition boules''' must meet specifications set by the FIPJP.  They must be hollow and made of metal (usually steel) with a diameter between {{Convert|70.5 and 80|mm||abbr=on}} and a weight between {{Convert|650 and 800|g||abbr=on}}. When purchasing competition boules, a purchaser has a choice of a number of characteristics of the boules, including the size, weight, and hardness of the boules, as well as the striations (patterned grooves on the surface of the boules).

=== Cochonnet ===
The jack, or target ball, is a small ball made of wood, traditionally boxwood or beechwood, {{Convert|30|mm||abbr=on}} in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;In 2002 the FIPJP began certifying non-wooden "synthetic" or "resin" jacks, and in 2013 began certifying synthetic jacks capable of being picked up by a magnet.  In 2016, however, synthetic jacks were effectively outlawed because of their weight. For a review of the evolution of the rules governing the jack, see https://petanquerules.wordpress.com/2015/02/15/evolution-of-the-jack/&lt;/ref&gt;  In the past jacks were often left "natural"—unfinished or with a clear finish—but nowadays they are often painted in bright colors.  In French, the jack is known by a variety of names, including ''but'' (goal or target), ''cochonnet'' (piglet), ''bouchon'' ("little ball" in [[provençal language]], not related to the french word "bouchon" that designate a bottle stopper), ''le petit'' (the little one), and ''gari'' ("[[Rat|rat]]", also in provençal language).

===Playing area===

Pétanque can be played on almost any flat, open space. The ground may be irregular and interrupted by trees or rocks, and the surface is likely to be uneven, with some areas hard and smooth and other areas rough and stony. When an area is constructed specifically for the purposes of playing petanque, the playing surface is typically loose gravel, decomposed granite, brick grog or crushed sea shell.   Sandy beaches are not suitable, although light plastic boules are sometimes used to adapt the game for the beach. There is no requirement for backboards or sideboards (as in bocce), but dedicated playing areas are often enclosed in boards or some other structural barrier.

In France, village squares and park pathways are often used as pétanque playing areas.  In addition, many towns have recreational facilities (''boulodromes'') constructed especially for playing pétanque.

An area where a single pétanque game is played is called a 'piste'.  A ''terrain'' is an area where one or more petanque games are being played. At any given time a ''terrain'' may be hosting one or more ''pistes''.

For tournaments, a large playing area is subdivided and marked off (typically using nails and string) into rectangular ''marked terrains'' (also known as "lanes" (''cadres'') or "pistes") so that multiple games may be carried on simultaneously. For tournament play, a marked terrain is a rectangle at least {{Convert|4|m|}} wide and {{Convert|15|m|}} long.

In the United States, proponents of pétanque such as author Byron Putman often urge the use of non-dedicated public terrains &amp;ndash; public walking paths, playground areas, dirt/gravel parking lots, and baseball infields &amp;ndash; as terrains.

== Strategy ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}

=== Pointing and shooting ===
Generally speaking, a player throws a boule with one of two objectives.
* To make his boule come to rest in a particular spot, usually as close as possible to the jack. This is called ''pointing''. 
* To make his boule directly hit an opponent's boule with the goal of knocking it away from the jack.  This is called ''shooting''.
The best throw of all is called a ''carreau''.  It is a shot that knocks away the opponent's boule, leaving the thrown boule exactly in its place.

Players who are skillful enough to shoot effectively are called ''shooters''; players who usually point are called ''pointers''.  (The French terms are ''tireur'' and ''pointeur'', respectively.)  As a matter of strategy, pointers play first and shooters are held in reserve in case the opponents place well.  Good pointing is what scores points, but national and international championships are usually dominated by skillful shooters, who target any opposing boule that comes close to scoring.

===Throwing a boule===
Some strategic considerations involved in the throw of a boule include:

* Traditionally, a fundamental rule of petanque is ''boule devant, boule d'argent'' ("A ball in front is a money ball."). A boule located in front of the jack is much more valuable than one behind the jack.  A boule in front blocks the opposing team from easy access to the jack, and it may also (intentionally or accidentally) be hit and pushed closer to the jack.
* As a pointer, if you point a boule ''very'' close to the jack, you force the opposing shooter to shoot it immediately.  That may be a bad thing if you really wanted to keep that boule.  Or it may be a good thing if you're trying to force the opposing shooter to exhaust his supply of boules.
* Generally speaking, it is a bad idea to shoot with your team's last boule.  In most cases, the better strategy is to "limit the damage" by pointing your team's last boule close enough to the jack to limit the opposing team to winning only one point.

===Throwing the jack===
Strategic considerations involved in the throw of the jack include:

* Throw the jack to a distance at which your own shooter is most comfortable, or the opposing shooter is least comfortable. 
* Aim for a location on the terrain that your own pointers favor, or that might be difficult for the opposing team's pointers.
* Disorient the opposing team by refusing to get in a rut.  At each opportunity, throw the jack to a new position on the terrain, and alternate long and short distances.

== Glossary of special terms ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
*'''to have the point'''
:A team is said to "have the point" if one of its boules is closer to the jack than any of the opposing team's boules.  A team that has the point is basically in a winning position, so the team that does NOT have the point throws the next boule and attempts to gain the point.

*'''''boule devant, boule d'argent'''''
:Roughly "A ball in front is a money ball". This maxim reminds players that when pointing, the most valuable place for a boule is in front of the jack.  In that location, it prevents opponents from throwing directly toward the jack, and hitting it will push it even closer to the jack.

*'''to point'''
:To throw one's boule with the intent of stopping near the jack (also known as placing).

*'''to shoot'''
:To throw one's boule at an opponent's boule (or at the jack) in an attempt to knock it out of play.  When the opposing team has a boule positioned very close to the jack, often the best strategy is to attempt to shoot it.  A team in a desperate situation may attempt to save itself by shooting the jack out of bounds.

*'''to lob'''
: (French: ''une portée'') To throw one's boule in a high arc so that when it lands it only rolls minimally. Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxrMy9XFLXE Marco Foyot demonstrates the high lob.]

*'''''carreau'''''
:(pronounced ''care-ROW'').  A shot that knocks an opposing boule away from the jack and replaces it (in very nearly the same spot) with the thrower's own boule.  Basically, the perfect shot.  Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm9MoYTqwHY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m48s Diego Rizzi demonstrates a perfect carreau.]

[[File:Fanny Le Rituel.jpg|thumb|right|A man kissing Fanny.]]

*'''to fanny''' (''mettre fanny'' in French)
:To win a game without the opposing team scoring any points; a shutout game.  When a player loses 13 to 0, he is said to ''fanny'' ("''il est fanny''", he's fanny, or "''il a fait fanny''", he made fanny) and must kiss the bottom of a girl named Fanny.  Virtually everywhere in Provence where pétanque is played, you will find a picture, woodcarving, or pottery figure of a bare-bottomed lass named Fanny.  Often, the team that made "fanny" has to buy a round of drinks for the winning team ("''Fanny paie à boire!''", "the fanny pays for the drinks!").

'''Scandinavium''' ({{IPA-sv|skandɪˈnɑːvɪ.ɵm}}) is an [[indoor arena]] located in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden. Construction on Scandinavium began in 1969 after decades of setbacks, and was inaugurated on 18 May 1971.

Scandinavium has been selected as a championship arena at least fifty times, hosting events such as World Championships in handball and ice hockey, European championships, [[Davis Cup]] finals, and in 1985 the [[Eurovision Song Contest, 1985|Eurovision Song Contest]]. Scandinavium is the home arena for [[Frölunda HC]] of [[Swedish Hockey League]], and venue for the annual [[Göteborg Horse Show]].

== History ==
Plans to build an arena at the site were part of a proposal originating from 1931 to build a swimming hall and other municipally owned facilities for sport and recreation next to the exhibition center [[Svenska Mässan]]. In 1936 a preplanning process for the swimming hall and the adjunct area started, but was put on hold due to the precarious situation in Europe at the time and eventually canceled following the outbreak of World War II. In 1948 an architectural design competition was announced for an indoor arena with the project name '''Valhalla Inomhusarena''' ({{lang-en|Valhalla indoor arena}}), the winning design was presented by a work group led by architect [[Poul Hultberg]], who was working for [[Nils Olsson]]'s architect firm in Gothenburg. Financing for the arena and other proposed facilities became a subject of public and political debate, the plans to build the arena were postponed indefinitely. The [[Valhalla Swimming Hall]], which was the primary building in the 1931 proposal, was the only proposed facility to be built during the 1950s due to capacity problems at other central swimming facilities.

In the 1962 election campaign the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] guaranteed that they would build the arena if they won the election. The Social Democrats won the election and a pre-planning process was started but financing was still an issue and the plans were yet again put on hold. In 1968 a committee assigned to plan the 350th year celebration of Gothenburg considered that it was a good idea to build the arena in time for the celebrations in 1971, making it a lasting memory of the anniversary. A company responsible for the construction was formed by the municipality and private investors, while Hultberg was asked to revise his 23-year-old designs. An estimated construction cost of twenty-three million SEK caused wild protests and intense debates but did not delay the progress. In May 1969 it was discovered that there was no construction permit for the arena, delaying the start of construction for a few weeks. When [[tartan track]]s were installed near the end of construction, the concentration of flammable gases in the building was so high that one spark could have potentially blown up the entire structure. When construction was completed in May 1971, Scandinavium stood as the largest covered arena in northern Europe with an attendance capacity of 14,000 spectators. The construction cost totaled thirty-one million SEK, which resulted in an eight million SEK budget deficit.

== Structure and facilities ==
[[File:Vy över Scandinavium och Valhallabadet.JPG|thumb|left|Scandinavium with [[Valhalla Swimming Hall]] in the foreground]]
Scandinavium's "sweeping appearance" comes from the [[Paraboloid|hyperbolic paraboloid]] shaped [[saddle roof]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Caldenby|first=Claes|title=Guide till Göteborgs arkitektur|publisher=Arkitektur Förlag AB|year=2006|pages=&amp;#8202;102|isbn=978-91-86050-67-2|oclc=162409429|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roof is supported by a [[Prestressed structure|prestressed]] cable net, with a nearly constant spacing of four meters in both directions, anchored in a space curved [[reinforced concrete]] ring beam with a rectangular cross-section of 3.5&amp;nbsp;meters&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;1.2&amp;nbsp;meters (11.5&amp;nbsp;ft&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;ft). The hanging cables rise ten meters to the top from the saddle point and the bracing cables fall four meters to the valley of the ring beam. The building is 14&amp;nbsp;meters (46&amp;nbsp;ft) tall, from the event floor to the pinnacle of the roof. The ring beam is supported by forty circular columns and four stiff pylons, all visible in the arenas facade. The pylons consist of radially oriented concrete walls, with a length of 3.5&amp;nbsp;meters (11.5&amp;nbsp;ft), which stores ventilation equipment. The video board, lights, and sound system is suspended in a radially oriented cable system anchored in the four pylons. It was not consider stable enough for colour telecasting to attach these components directly to the roof. The cable system also serves as tension rods for the ring beam.

The seating in Scandinavium is arranged in a one-level monolithic grandstand. The round design of the structure and the symmetric oval shape of the 4,100&amp;nbsp;m² (44,100&amp;nbsp;ft²) arena floor results in more rows along the length of the floor. The first six rows are telescopic seating which can be electrically retracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kerkosport.com/en/products/data/attachments/Telescopic_net.pdf |title=KERKO – telescopic seating |accessdate=2008-09-16 |format=PDF |publisher=Kerko Sport Group |pages=4}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are forty-four executive boxes in the arena, located between the two northern pylons.

The [[ice hockey rink]] measures 61&amp;nbsp;meters&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;30&amp;nbsp;meters (200&amp;nbsp;ft&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;98.5&amp;nbsp;ft) which is standard international size. New double frame half boards were installed in 2001, designed to switch to NHL rink dimensions or to be easily removed when other events than ice hockey take place.&lt;ref name="Gotevent01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gotevent.goteborg.se/PDF/Arsredovisning_2001.pdf |title=Verksamheten 2001 Got Event |accessdate=2008-07-10 |year=2001 |format=PDF |publisher=[[Got Event]] |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; To maximize the view for spectators, a seamless protective glass barrier consisting of tempered glass panels clipped together at their top corners with clear plastic brackets is used instead of traditional [[Plexiglas]] with metal dividers.&lt;ref name="Gotevent01" /&gt;

For the 2011 [[Göteborg Horse Show]] a new equestrian surface was purchased for 2 million SEK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gp.se/sport/1.865800-ridsand-for-miljoner|title=Ridsand för miljoner|last=Olofsson|first=Carina|date=2012-02-20|work=[[Göteborgs-Posten]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=2012-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location and transportation ==
[[File:Gothia Towers, Mässan och Scandinavium 02.JPG|thumb|right|Scandinavium with the [[Swedish Exhibition and Congress Centre]] and [[Gothia Towers]] in the background]]
Scandinavium is located in central Gothenburg, in the [[Heden]] district of the [[Boroughs and districts of Gothenburg|borough]] Centrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www5.goteborg.se/prod/stadsbyggnad/dalis2.nsf/vyFilArkiv/Centrum.pdf/$file/Centrum.pdf |title=CENTRUM — Beskrivning av stadsdelen |accessdate=2008-07-27 |date=March 2008 |format=PDF |publisher=[[Gothenburg Municipality]] |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scandinavium is one of the center pieces of the event district called Evenemangsstråket, with [[Ullevi|Ullevi Stadium]], [[Liseberg]], [[Universeum]], the [[Museum of World Culture]], and [[Bergakungen]] nearby. Public transport is easily accessible; Just outside there is a tram stop named after the arena, which serves tram lines six, eight, thirteen, and fourteen. Tram lines four and five stops 250&amp;nbsp;meters from the arena at [[Korsvägen]], a major public transport hub, which serves more than fifteen different bus lines, and will have an underground rapid transit station once [[Västlänken]] is completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.banverket.se/pages/4341/UR_17_Sociala_konsekvenser_72dpi.pdf |title=Västlänken — en tågtunnel under Göteborg |accessdate=2008-07-26 |date=2006-02-09 |format=PDF |publisher=[[Banverket]], [[Gothenburg Municipality]], [[Göteborgsregionens kommunalförbund|GR]], [[Västra Götaland Regional Council]], and [[Västtrafik]] |pages=16–18 |language=Swedish }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately one and one half kilometer north west from Scandinavium is the [[Gothenburg Central Station]] and the [[Nils Ericson Terminal]], one half kilometer south east is the [[Liseberg station]] serving the [[Gothenburg commuter rail]].

When Frölunda and the Ottawa Senators played an exhibition game on 2 October 2008, spectators could use their game tickets for free travel with public transportation within Gothenburg's municipality, before and after the game. Extra trams and buses were in traffic during this time. The campaign was a test to see if it would be possible to include a public transportation fee on tickets to future events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gp.se/nyheter/goteborg/1.107932-ak-gratis-och-kolla-in-alfie-|title=Åk gratis – och kolla in "Alfie"|last=Sahlberg|first=Anders|date=2008-09-17|work=[[Göteborgs-Posten]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=2008-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Scandinavium's central location the arena site itself does not have any public parking spaces, parking is only provided for sponsors, the press, and event personnel at a guard-gated parking lot next to [[Valhalla IP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.frolundaindians.com/archive/dokument/Partnerbroschyr%2008_Web.pdf |title=Partner 08/09 |accessdate=2008-07-26 |year=2008 |format=PDF |publisher=[[Frölunda HC]] |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors are guided to eighteen nearby parking lots and parking garages—with a total of 7,000 parking spaces—by the event districts parking guidance and information system.&lt;ref name="parking"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www22.vv.se/filer/17918/P-evenemang_2-2005_mini.pdf |title=Så prioriteras evenemangen som syns på skyltarna |accessdate=2008-07-08 |date=May 2005 |format=PDF |publisher=[[Swedish Road Administration]] |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017100544/http://www22.vv.se/filer/17918/P-evenemang_2-2005_mini.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The system has a total of 130 digital signs, located on motorways with information about which exit to use, and on streets in the city with more detailed information about directions and number of available parking spaces.&lt;ref name="parking"/&gt;

The arena has also hosted a semifinal of [[Melodifestivalen]] every year since the introduction of the current format, except for 2002 itself. It was also considered to host the final of [[Melodifestivalen 2010]], but scheduling conflicts ruled this out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/musik/schlagerstaderna-for-nasta-ar-klara-1.939332|title=Schlagerstäderna för nästa år klara|last=Forsell|first=Mikael|date=2009-08-27|work=[[Dagens Nyheter]]|accessdate=2009-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arena hosts the annual [[Göteborg Horse Show]] every year since 1977.

The arena has hosted concerts by many famous artists, spanning many different genres. Some of the first major concerts to take place at the venue were performed by [[The Who]], [[Deep Purple]] and [[Led Zeppelin]] during their 1972 and 1973 European Tours respectively.  [[Iron Maiden]] have performed at the arena the most with a total of nine times with the latest being in 2006.

The arena was among one of the four potential candidate venues to host the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2013]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gustavsson|first=Rikard|title=The bidding has started!|url=http://www.esctoday.com/?p=36444|publisher=ESCToday.com|accessdate=28 May 2012|date=28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, the [[Malmö Arena]] was chosen to host the contest.

{{Globalize |date = December 2009|discuss=Talk:Scout (sport)#Globalize }}

In [[professional sports]], '''scouts''' are experienced talent evaluators who travel extensively for the purposes of watching athletes play their chosen sports and determining whether their set of skills and talents represent what is needed by the scout's organization. Some scouts are interested primarily in the selection of ''prospects'', younger players who may require further development by the acquiring team but who are judged to be worthy of that effort and expense for the potential future payoff that it could bring, while others concentrate on players who are already polished professionals whose rights may be available soon, either through [[free agent|free agency]] or trading, and who are seen as filling a team's specific need at a certain position.  ''Advance scouts'' watch the teams that their teams are going to play in order to help determine [[strategy]].

Many scouts are former [[coach (sport)|coaches]] or retired players, while others have made a career just of being scouts. Skilled scouts who help to determine which players will fit in well with an organization can be the major difference between success and failure for the team with regard to wins and losses, which often relates directly to the organization's financial success or lack thereof as well.

==Kinds of scouts==
Scouts tend to have to perform one of two tasks, either scouting opposition teams to research the opposition's players and tactics, or scouting individual players to identify their level of skill and to keep track of potential new signings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Owen|first=Gareth|title=Scouting missions broaden horizons during injury absence|url=http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/Gareth-Owen-Scouting-missions-broaden-horizons/story-14165404-detail/story.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130505113709/http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/Gareth-Owen-Scouting-missions-broaden-horizons/story-14165404-detail/story.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 May 2013|accessdate=17 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Sentinel (Staffordshire)|The Sentinel]]|date=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary [[Major League Baseball]] teams usually classify scouts and their differing responsibilities as follows:
*'''Advance scouts''' follow the MLB clubs that their team is scheduled to play and file reports on trends and tendencies that influence pitching, defensive, offensive and game strategy.
*'''Major League scouts''' and '''professional scouts''' (the most senior of whom are sometimes called "special assignment scouts" or "special assistants to the [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]]") typically track active players under contract to other teams for potential acquisition.  They also may support advance scouts or evaluate competing minor league organizations. Per their designation, the former follow players in MLB, while "pro scouts" work [[minor league baseball|minor league]] and [[independent league baseball]].
*'''Amateur scouts''' evaluate [[high school]] and [[college baseball]] players and prepare their MLB teams for the [[Major League Baseball Draft|June amateur draft]].  To ensure that players are seen by multiple evaluators, amateur scouts are usually divided into area scouts, regional cross-checkers and national cross-checkers.
*'''International scouts''' cover players not from the [[United States]], [[Puerto Rico]] and other [[insular areas|U.S. territories]], or [[Canada]]. These players are signed as international [[free agent]]s and are not subject to the June draft, although bonus amounts and signing regulations are governed by the collective bargaining agreement between MLB and its [[Major League Baseball Players Association|players' union]].  In addition to the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Venezuela]], [[Mexico]], and other [[Latin America]]n and [[Caribbean]] countries, where MLB teams have had a scouting presence since the mid-20th century, the growth in international baseball has compelled most teams to station scouts in [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and other [[Asia]]n countries, [[Australia]], and [[Europe]].

According to [[Tony Lucadello]], considered by some to be the greatest scout ever,&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Mike (2004). ''Ninety Feet from Fame: Close Calls With Baseball Immortality''. Pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, David M. (2004). ''Occasional Glory: The History of the Philadelphia Phillies''. Pp. 163–164.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spivak, Jeffrey (2005). ''Crowning the Kansas City Royals: Remembering the 1985 World Series Champs''. P. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, Gare. ''Wall of Dreams.''&lt;/ref&gt; the four kinds of scouts start with the letter 'P':

* '''Poor''' – wastes time looking for games rather than having a planned itinerary
* '''Picker''' – emphasizes a player's one weakness to the neglect of all strengths and ignores the potential within
* '''Performance''' – bases his evaluation on what a player does in his presence
* '''Projector''' – envisions what a player will be able to do in two or three years

Lucadello estimated that five percent of scouts were poor, five percent pickers, 85 percent performance scouts and five percent projectors.&lt;ref&gt;Winegardner, Mark (1990). ''Prophet of the Sandlots: Journeys with a Major League Scout''. P. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer-aided scouting==
{{Main|Computer-aided scouting}}

Modern day scouts are becoming more and more reliant on computer programs to aid and assist in the evaluation of talent being scouted.{{cn|date=October 2016}} Many professional sport clubs now use computers to organize their collected information and data.{{cn|date=October 2016}} Most sports still depend on human management to decide which players their organization will draft or sign.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

'''Tout Wars''' is the most high-profile fantasy baseball experts league and was the focus of the 2006 best selling book ''Fantasyland''. It was created in 1997 by [[Ron Shandler]] who was fed up with the lack of promotion USA Today gave its annual [[LABR]] fantasy baseball experts league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Sam | last=Walker | coauthors= | title=Fantasyland | date=2006 | publisher=Viking | url=http://www.fantasylandthebook.com/ | work = | pages =145 | accessdate = 2007-07-17 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The drafts are conducted each year in late March shortly before the MLB season and include a 12 team AL-only league, a 13-team NL-only league and a 12-team mixed league (added in 2005). Tout Wars was featured as the subject of a 2010 documentary called "Fantasyland" based on the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Will | last=Leitch | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Are There Still People Who Think Fantasy Baseball Is Strange? | date=2010-03-30 | publisher= | url =http://nymag.com/daily/sports/2010/03/fantasy_baseball_is_becoming_more_important_than_real_baseball.html | work =New York Magazine | pages = | accessdate = 2010-03-31 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3933">'''Volata''' ("flow") is a [[code of football]] developed and promoted by [[Italian fascists]] for a brief period during the late 1920s and early 1930s, in an attempt to displace sports with non-Italian origins, such as [[association football]] (soccer) and [[rugby union]].

Association football was popular in [[Italy]] when the fascists came to power in 1921. [[Rugby union]] was a new and relatively minor sport, but also growing in popularity.

Although the fascists idealized association football for its contribution to physical fitness, it was also seen at the time as an "English game" (because the rules had been codified by the English [[Football Association]] and the first organized matches had taken place in England). The fascists generally  distanced themselves from cultural practices with foreign roots.

Conversely, rugby was seen as having links to the extinct Ancient Roman game of ''[[harpastum]]''. By 1927, fascist propaganda actively promoted rugby – which it referred to as ''palla ovale'' ("oval ball"). However, the ''[[Federazione Italiana Rugby]]'' proved resistant to manipulation and the fascists quickly ceased their support.

The national secretary of the Fascist Party, [[Augusto Turati]], devised volata. Officially, the rules were based on long-extinct codes of football indigenous to Italy, especially the Roman [[harpastum]] and the medieval ''[[calcio Fiorentino]]''. Volata was contested by eight-member sides, with rules that were described by a 1929 propaganda newsreel from ''[[Istituto Luce]]'' as a "synthesis of the essential elements of the games of ''calcio'' and rugby" (''sintesi di elementi essenziali del giuoco del calcio e del "rugby"'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ie7y2DSkfW0 ''Istituto Luce'', 1929, ''Partita di "volata" allo stadio del P.N.F. di Roma''] (1 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the word "''calcio''" was ambiguous, as it was the usual name of association football, as well as ''calcio Fiorentino'', which in 1930 was also revived at the fascists' behest.

Promoted by Fascist sporting and cultural organizations, Volata enjoyed a brief phase of popularity. More than 100 Volata clubs and a league were reportedly formed.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} However, the enduring popularity of association football caused the fascists to change their attitude toward the sport.

In 1933, volata organizations and competitions were officially abandoned. Afterwards the fascists encouraged association football; Italy hosted and won the [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934 World Cup]].

The popularity of rugby and its place within Italian sporting culture appear to have been reduced by the changing policies of the fascists, as well as the invention of volata. Nevertheless, rugby survived the fascist period and began to grow when Italy was occupied by British Commonwealth forces during 1943–47.

'''The Wall Stadium''' (also nicknamed "The Laptop") is an underground [[stadium]], currently under construction in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]].

Designed by architecture firm MZ Architects / MZ &amp; Partners, the Wall Stadium is a one of a kind football stadium, unique in its form and revolutionary in its design, emerging from a green shallow dune. Its main stand sits upright, the majority of its height emerging from the underground pitch. 
A lawn and stand will be built in the basement of the stadium. It has an advantage of having fresh air beneath the feet, thus adding to the overall speed of the game as players are fresh throughout the game. Another innovative feature is that there will be no traditional floodlights or light towers as normally seen around sports stadiums around the world, as all lights will be embedded within the surrounding architecture, adding to the stadium’s mystical feel.
