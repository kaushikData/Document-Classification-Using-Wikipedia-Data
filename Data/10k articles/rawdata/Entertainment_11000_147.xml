'''''Age of Empires: The Age of Kings''''' is a [[turn-based strategy]] [[video game]] developed by [[Backbone Entertainment]] and published by [[Majesco Entertainment]] for the [[Nintendo DS]] [[Handheld game console|handheld]] [[video game console]].

''The Age of Kings'' allows the player to command any one of five historical civilizations: the [[Britons (historical)|Briton]]s, [[Franks]], [[Mongols]], [[Saracens]] and [[Japan]]ese. It has a [[single-player]] campaign and scenario mode, as well as a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] [[wireless]] and [[Hotseat (multiplayer mode)|hotseat]] mode.

==Gameplay==
''The Age of Kings'' is turn-based. As a derivative of the ''[[Age of Empires]]'' series, other games of which are [[real-time strategy]] as opposed to turn-based strategy, ''The Age of Kings'' incorporates several features and mechanics commonly associated with real-time strategy, including technology advancement and resource and building management.

The playing field is divided into a grid, with the player having an overhead perspective of the map. Units are able to move a certain amount of spaces in the four cardinal directions, with how far they can go affected by several variables, including the unit's natural movement abilities and terrain. Each unit type is given a specific amount of spaces that it can move, with some having better movement capabilities than others. There are a variety of terrain types, such as roads, forests and grass. Roads are best for movement, while some terrains slow the player down but can provide other advantages, such as extra range or defense.

Each of the five civilizations has its own hero, which is stronger than other units. The Japanese hero is [[Minamoto no Yoshitsune]]; the Saracens' hero is [[Saladin]]; the Mongols' hero is [[Genghis Khan]]; the Franks' heroine is [[Joan of Arc]]; and the Britons' hero is King [[Richard the Lionheart]]. Each hero has special abilities which are unique to them. Each civilization is also unique in the sense that they have different Unit Art (the [[Franks]] and Britons share art, and the Mongols and the Saracens share art), different Special Units (powerful civilization-specific units trainable from castles), and different high- and low-cost units.

Most units are divided into four main categories: Infantry, cavalry, ranged and siege units. Infantry and cavalry units are only able to attack an enemy unit or structure in any adjacent square (with the exception of squares which are diagonally adjacent), while ranged units and some siege units are able to attack from a greater distance. Each unit has movement, attack, defense, range and vision values. Some units may have additional defensive bonuses against certain types of enemy units or abilities.

There are many variables to be taken into account before battling an enemy. Before entering the battle, the game will display the statistics of both units, which consists of the units' health points, attack power, and defensive capabilities. This screen shows an adviser, who predicts the chance a given attack has of being successful. The attack power and defensive capabilities of the attacking unit vary depending on the opposing unit's special abilities. When the units enter into battle, many warriors are seen, which begin to battle each other. The attacking units usually do more damage as they get the first strike. As a unit's HP drops, their attack power does as well.

The player can advance their civilization by researching new units, technologies and other advancements. Once the player advances far enough in research or completes certain conditions, a new age is made available. Players usually start in the first age, the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Age]], and progress through later ages, including the [[Feudalism|Feudal]], [[Castle]] and [[Imperialism|Imperial ages]]. Advancing in age unlocks new subjects for the player to research, makes additional buildings and units available, and upgrades existing units to their equivalent in the new age.

===Campaign===
''The Age of Kings'' includes a campaign divided into five sections, one for each civilization. Each section contains five or six missions. The first section of the campaign, following Joan of Arc, acts as a tutorial and educates the player about the basics of the game. Campaign missions vary widely in characteristics. Some contain a field effect known as the [[fog of war]], and in some missions the player starts out with some buildings while in others the player may start without any. By playing to earn "Empire Points", the player can buy powerful units to use in-game from the Bonus Items Shop, as well as new maps to play on in Single Scenario (freeplay) mode. Each mission has main goals as well as secondary goals, the latter of which increase the amount of Empire Points gained when the mission is completed.

===Multiplayer===
''The Age of Kings'' contains a multiplayer mode which can support up to four players. Multiplayer can be played on a single DS in [[Hotseat (multiplayer mode)|hotseat]] mode, or in wireless multi-card mode, where each player has a DS and a copy of the game.

==Development==
The vast majority of content from ''Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings'' was ported to the DS, in what ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]'' described as a huge task. The sole exception was said to be the political scheming in the PC version, though there was still some contained in the DS counterpart.&lt;ref name=ONMprev&gt;{{cite news|title=Age of Empires: The Age of Kings preview|magazine=[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]|page=38|date=July 5, 2008}}&lt;!-- [[WP:VG/M]] --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Age of Empires: The Age of Kings'' has received an average score of 80.0% at [[GameRankings]] (based on 45 reviews),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/ds/927039-age-of-empires-the-age-of-kings/index.html|title=Age of Empires: The Age of Kings Reviews|website=[[GameRankings]]|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an average score of 80/100 at [[Metacritic]] (based on 38 reviews).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ds/age-of-empires-the-age-of-kings|title=Age of Empires: The Age of Kings (ds: 2006): Reviews|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] gave it an 8.2/10, saying that the gameplay was solid, although they stated that it should have had more civilizations and online play.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Both IGN and [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] each gave it a Game of the Month award.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} It received an award for "Best Game Design" Elan award in the inaugural [[Canadian Awards for the Electronic &amp; Animated Arts]] on September 14, 2006.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} It was also nominated for 2006 BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Award): Best Strategy Game.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Technical issues===
Some players have experienced technical issues which can impair gameplay or damage the data on the cartridge. The game data can become corrupted during a save and quit operation, preventing the cartridge from booting afterwards. A term for this is called a "bricked cartridge". The game may sometimes freeze in a battle involving [[Ballista|scorpion]] units and after the end of a mission. Majesco released claims that they were investigating the issue but no official solution or replacements have ever become available, only workarounds.

Majesco has determined that using a short profile name (two to three characters in length) may be causing some issues and has suggested users change their profile name to at least four characters as a temporary workaround. Majesco eventually began inserting a slip of paper into all copies of ''The Age of Kings'' they produced, which warned users of the problem and provided the workaround.

Also the "Longswordsman" unit, when selected, doesn't display a "unit name".

Due to financial difficulties, Majesco has restructured their website and removed their forums. The original information regarding the technical issues is no longer directly available. However, the glitches are mentioned in a review from Mygamer.com: "The game also has a number of bugs that freeze the game up during battles or when you save."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stan|url=http://www.mygamer.com/the-age-of-mediocre/ |title=The Age of Mediocre|publisher=Mygamer|date=March 13, 2006|accessdate=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''An Evening with Champions''' (EWC) is an annual benefit [[figure skating]] show organized by students of [[Harvard University]]. The event is a two-day skating show generally in October, which regularly attracts world-class skaters, thousands of spectators, hundreds of Harvard students, special guests, and donors. The show is entirely student-run and is managed completely by volunteer work. All profits go to the [[Jimmy Fund]], one of New England's most cherished charities, and EWC is one of the oldest continually-running fundraising events for the charity. The Jimmy Fund supports pediatric and adult cancer research and treatment at [[Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]]. After the 45th show in 2015, An Evening with Champions has donated over $2.9 million for the Jimmy Fund.

The show was originally conceived in 1970 by [[John Misha Petkevich]], the two-time Olympic competitor who was at that time a junior at Harvard living in [[Eliot House]], which became (and has remained) the official host of the show. The show has been continually produced every fall since 1970, with the exception of a special spring show in April 2010, commemorating the 40th anniversary of EWC.

[[Image:2007ewc-protopopovs.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Ludmila Belousova|Ludmila]] and [[Oleg Protopopov]] in the 2007 show.]]

Many current and former U.S. and international champions and Olympic competitors have appeared in the show over the years. The show usually features a mix of up-and-coming elite competitors and established champions. Past shows' skaters have included [[Michelle Kwan]], [[Brian Boitano]], [[Yuna Kim]], [[Scott Hamilton (figure skater)|Scott Hamilton]], [[Kristi Yamaguchi]], [[Ekaterina Gordeeva]], and the Haydenettes synchronized skating team who have made EWC their opening appearance for many years. [[Paul Wylie]], himself a former resident of Eliot House, has generally hosted the show since 1998. Beginning in 2011, Wylie has been joined by [[Emily Hughes]] as Co-Host. [[Ludmila Belousova]] and [[Oleg Protopopov]], two-time Olympic Champions, have also had a particularly long association with the show and continue to make annual appearances.

The show was formerly televised each year on [[PBS]], but the broadcast ended in 2001.  More recently, it had been televised on the [[Comcast Network]] cable channel CN8.

Beginning in 2012, EWC launched "Skating with Champions," a fundraising initiative in which fans can fundraise solo or in a team to win an invitation to perform in the show alongside the main cast.

==40th An Evening with Champions==
The 2010 show of An Evening with Champions celebrated the 40th anniversary of the charity with a special spring show taking place on April 16 and 17, 2010, as opposed to a show in the fall. The main cast included Olympians [[Mark Ladwig]] and [[Amanda Evora]], two-time Olympic champions [[Ludmila Belousova]] and [[Oleg Protopopov]], and Olympian (and Harvard student) [[Emily Hughes]]. Many former Olympians and national champions joined the main cast to celebrate the anniversary, including [[Sarah Hughes]], [[Paul Wylie]], and [[Dorothy Hamill]]. The show was co-hosted by [[Peggy Fleming]] and [[Dick Button]], who temporarily replaced Wylie.

==1994 embezzlement scandal==

Chas Lee pleaded guilty to charges of [[embezzlement|embezzling]] over $100,000 from the show in 1991 and 1992, when he was co-chair of the event as an Eliot House undergraduate. [[David Sword]], another Harvard undergraduate who was the event's treasurer during that time, was also convicted of embezzling a lesser amount. The scandal received considerable press coverage when the theft was uncovered in 1994.

It concerned the constitutional validity of Part IIID of the ''Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act'' 1991,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|num_act|pbapda1991438|Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act 1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which regulated political advertising during election campaigns, and required broadcasters to broadcast political advertisements free of charge at other times. The High Court found the laws to be invalid, since they contravened an [[implied freedom of political communication]] in the [[Australian Constitution]].

==Background to the case==

In 1992, the [[Government of Australia]] ("the Commonwealth") under Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] passed the ''Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act 1991'', which inserted part IIID into the ''Broadcasting Act 1942''. The changes had a number of effects, the most important of which prohibited the broadcasting of politically related material on electronic media such as radio and television during the period leading up to a [[Elections in Australia|State or Federal election]] (except in news, [[current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] or talkback programs). The laws also obliged broadcasters to provide "free time" to political parties to air advertisements. [[Kim Beazley]], then the Minister for Transport and Communications, said that the changes were designed to limit corruption, and prevent donors to political parties from exerting undue influence, by restricting the amount of political advertising that could be broadcast.&lt;ref name="bill_reading"&gt;{{cite hansard |jurisdiction=Commonwealth of Australia |house=House of Representatives |date=9 May 1991 |pages=3477–3483 |speaker=Kim Beazley |position=Minister for Transport and Communications |title=Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991: Second Reading |url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansardr%2F1991-05-09%2F0125%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that due to the practical cost of advertising, it was only the major parties and very wealthy individuals who could afford to broadcast advertisements. The Government said they had wanted to avoid a situation such as that in the United States, where it is virtually impossible for anyone but the very rich to participate in the political process.

With some exceptions, the laws prohibited broadcasters from broadcasting matter for or on behalf of the government or government agencies, and from broadcasting political advertisements ("matter intended or likely to affect voting in the election", or matter explicitly referring to the election) on behalf of themselves or other individuals during an election period. The "free time" would be divided between the parties based on the amount of representation they had in [[Parliament of Australia|the Parliament]], with only five percent available to other groups, who had to apply for an allocation of free time.

The eight [[plaintiff]]s in the case were commercial television broadcasters who held broadcasting licences under the ''Broadcasting Act''. They asked the High Court to declare that Part IIID of the act was invalid. In a related action which was heard at the same time, the [[Government of New South Wales]] also challenged the laws, particularly their application to by-elections. The [[Government of South Australia]] intervened in the case in support of the Commonwealth.

==The case==

The most important argument made by the plaintiffs was that the new laws interfered with a right to free political speech which was implied in the Constitution. They also argued that the parts of the Act requiring that broadcasters give "free time" to certain people was an unjust acquisition of property. The Government of New South Wales argued that the laws were discriminatory against the states and they interfered with the proper business of State Governments.

===Freedom of speech===

The principal argument from the plaintiffs was that the changes to the ''Broadcasting Act'' contravened an implied right to freedom of participation and communication in political processes. They argued that this right to free political speech arose from the system of [[representative government]] which is provided by the Constitution, or alternatively, it arose from the "common citizenship of the Australian people." Sir [[Maurice Byers]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], who acted for the plaintiffs, paraphrasing former Justice [[Isaac Isaacs]] argued that the principle that governments are responsible to the citizens who elect them "permeates the Constitution, forming part of the fabric on which the written words of the Constitution are superimposed," and as such, all voters should be entitled to make comment on political issues.

The plaintiffs argued that since a right to free political communication was recognised in other parliamentary [[democracy|democracies]], such as in the United States by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], and in Canada by the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], it should be recognised in Australia. They said that because the provisions in Part IIID limited the allocation of "free time" to people or groups already represented in the Parliaments, new parties or people not in the Parliament would not be able to express their views.

The Commonwealth argued that the laws enhanced rather than diminished the electoral process, because they prevented corruption, and allowed parties which did not have large amounts of money to have access to radio and television broadcasting. They said that the Parliament has valid powers to protect the integrity of the electoral process under sections 10, 29, 31, 51(36) and 51(39) of the Constitution. Furthermore, they argued that even if there was some implied right to freedom of political communication, this could not override valid legislation. The Commonwealth also pointed out that similar laws operated in countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Norway and Sweden, and that countries such as Canada, Germany, Japan and New Zealand had a system of allocating free broadcasting time for political purposes during election periods.

The Government of South Australia, who intervened in support of the Commonwealth, said that if the framers of the Constitution had intended to include provisions for a right of free speech as in the United States Constitution, they would have done so. They said that although some freedom of communication could reasonably be implied into the Constitution, the parts of the Act in question did not have the effect of preventing "free and meaningful elections" from taking place, and so the laws were not invalid.

The High Court agreed that the new part IIID of the ''Broadcasting Act'' had the effect of limiting the freedoms previously enjoyed by citizens to publicly discuss political matters. However, the question remained as to whether there was some sort of Constitutional basis for these freedoms, or whether the Commonwealth was justified in restricting them. While the court agreed that similar laws had been put in place overseas, that did not change the fact that the laws impaired freedom of communication, and privileged those political parties or interest groups who were already represented in the Parliament. The laws would not only disadvantage candidates challenging sitting members, but would severely hinder groups such as trade unions, charities or employers' groups, who may very well have a legitimate desire to make political statements.

===Acquisition of property===

The plaintiffs also argued that to force broadcasters to give portions of "free time" to the represented political parties and members of parliament had the effect of taking away their right to charge money for broadcasting advertisements. They suggested that taking away their advertising time and in effect giving it to the legislators constituted an acquisition of property by the Commonwealth, which according to [[Section 51(xxxi) of the Australian Constitution|section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution]], has to be done "on just terms."

The Commonwealth argued that the laws made no unjust acquisition of property, since broadcasting licences were not immune to being modified by the Parliament. They said that it was fair and just to require broadcasters to provide a limited amount of free service in the public interest. In any event, the Commonwealth suggested that "free time" granted by the Act was not a form of property anyway, since it could not be transferred to other people, one of the essential features of any form of property.

Ultimately the court did not decide on this issue, although [[Gerard Brennan|Justice Brennan]] said that he agreed with the Commonwealth's argument that the "free time" was not a form of property.

===Interference with State rights===

The Government of New South Wales, in addition to supporting the claims of the other plaintiffs, also argued that Part IIID of the ''Broadcasting Act'' was invalid because it interfered with the executive functions of [[States and territories of Australia|the States]], and contravened sections 106 and 107 of the Constitution which protects the individual State Constitutions. They said that to interfere with the right of State Governments to make political advertisements went far beyond any legitimate power given to the [[Parliament of Australia]] by the Constitution. They also said that in any event, the changes to the Act should not apply to by-elections.

The Commonwealth argued that Part IIID of the Act did not single out the States, nor interfere with their proper activities, since State elections were treated in exactly the same way as Federal elections were.

==The decision==

The court decided that a right to freedom of political communication was essential to the system of representative government provided for in the Constitution.&lt;ref name="LoC"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|45|1992|litigants=Australian Capital Television v Commonwealth |parallelcite=(1992) 177 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 106}} at 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The court expressed the view that the reason why Australia does not have a bill of rights is because the framers of the Constitution believed that since Australia had a system of representative government, which gave all voters an equal share in political power, laws to protect rights were simply not necessary. To undermine the system of representative government was contrary to this trust which the people gave to the Parliaments, and was not permitted by the Constitution. Although this right is not an absolute one, it is still a right which allows for free and public political discussion.

The court also decided that the relevant laws, contained in Part IIID of the ''Broadcasting Act'', were invalid because there was no reasonable justification for the way they restricted the freedom of political communication. The court decided that the laws also impaired certain functions of the States in terms of their rights to make political advertisements, and so the laws were also invalid for that reason.

==Consequences==

The case was one of the earliest in a series of cases in which the High Court found implied rights in the Constitution. This trend reached a High-point in ''[[Theophanous v Herald &amp; Weekly Times Ltd]]'',&lt;ref name="Theophanous HCA"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|46|1994|litigants=[[Theophanous v Herald &amp; Weekly Times Ltd]] |parallelcite=(1994) 182 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 104}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which found that the implied right to freedom of political communication could be used as a defence in a defamation action. Although that is no longer the case, the limited right to freedom of communication remains. It was emphasised in later cases like ''[[Lange v ABC]]'',&lt;ref name="Lange HCA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|25|1997|litigants=[[Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |parallelcite=(1997) 189 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 520}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that political communication was not a personal right, rather a constitutional restriction on legislative power.

In discussing the nature of representative government, [[Anthony Mason (judge)|Chief Justice Mason]] expressed the view that although the Constitution originally drew its authority from the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Imperial Parliament]], it would indeed be appropriate in modern times to recognise that Australian sovereignty derives its force from the Australian people.

==Plot==
The plot is set in a old family house of the Mujumdars in Kolhapur, where the family members have gathered to celebrate the annual ''Navratri Pooja''. The gathered family include a Grandmother - Anandi Mujumdar (played by Rama Joshi), her daughter in law and three grand children. The Mujumdars have a family history of having performances by various artists for the annual Navratri Pooja. But, due to some inauspicious  proceedings it has been stopped and the goddess has jinxed. The grandmother insists on starting the tradition once again. 

While the family members are trying to handle the situation caused as the artist who was supposed to perform this year ''Panditjee'' has backed out at the last moment, the local village performer Sadaa (''[[Prashant Damle]]'') enters their house. They misunderstand him to be the famous actor ''Prashant Damle'' due to the similarity in their looks and let him stay at their house. Sadaa lets them believe that he is the actor and takes on the character. Meanwhile, he tries to explain them time and again about their misunderstanding. But, the family members ignore him.

The grandmother plans to have the year's ''Navmi Pooja'' done by the famous actor and hopes that it would get them out of the year old jinx. The elder son plans to organize a commercial event with the actor and expects to kick start his career. After a series of preaching,  song and dances Sadaa finally confesses that he is a street performer and not the actor Prashant Damle. On understanding the truth the elder son hits Sadaa and chases him out of the house. While the things unfold, the story of the Mujumdars starting an event with the famous actor reaches the actor himself. As he is unaware of any such commitment he blasts the producer of the proposed event.

The actor Prashant Damle visits the Mujumdars in their Kolhapur house and inquires about their plan to organize the event. The Mujumdar brothers have already chalked out a plan for TV Reality Show which will have the famous actor and street performer visit various families and the people will have to guess the difference between the original and the duplicate. Prashant agrees to work with them after initial glitches and also agrees to perform the ''Navmi Pooja''. The grandmother realizes that Prashant is more inclined towards monetary gains instead of actual performances and objects the pooja being done by the actor. The elder son thinks that the actor will be annoyed if not given a chance to perform the pooja and might cancel the reality show project.

Sadaa returns to the Mujumdars house to return the shawl presented to him. The grandmother insists him to perform in front of the goddess. Sadaa performs a bharud on Sant Chokhamela. The grandmother realizes that they have been jinxed as they had chased away a Muslim Prostitute years ago and not allowed her to perform in front of the Goddess. The elder son realizes his fault and refuses Prashant Damle for the reality show and plans to organize an event with Sadaa overseas. The drama ends on a note where Sadaa is felicitated as per the Mujumdars tradition.

A '''box bass''' is an acoustic instrument that is indigenous to [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. It is mostly used in [[Parang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.triniview.com/blog/?p=347|title=Origins and Nature of Parang Music : TriniView.com|website=www.triniview.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The instrument consists of a wooden box that is attached to a taut string. The string/chord is thrummed and the box creates a heavy acoustic sound. The pitch of the sound is changed by altering the tension of the string, which changes the pitch of the sound. The instrument is used to keep tempo of the Parang Band.

The game is the fifth entry in the ''[[Bubsy]]'' series, and the first new entry in 21 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-06-08-accolade-brand-returns-with-a-new-bubsy-game|title=Accolade brand returns with a new Bubsy game|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rockpapershotgun.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/06/09/bubsy-the-woolies-strike-back-announced/|title=What could possibly go wrong?

==Gameplay==
The game returns to the 2D side-scrolling [[platform game|platformer]] gameplay found in the first ''[[Bubsy]]'' games, ''[[Bubsy in Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind]]'', ''[[Bubsy 2]]'' and ''[[Bubsy in Fractured Furry Tales]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/06/08/bubsy-is-returning-from-mascot-platformer-hell-to-torment-us-all/|title=Bubsy is returning from mascot platformer hell to torment us all|date=8 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; albeit now with 3D character models, a first for the side-scrolling entries in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/nostalgia-mining-reaches-perilous-low-return-bubsy-256536|title=Nostalgia mining reaches perilous low with the return of Bubsy The Cat|date=8 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
The game sees Bubsy going against the "Woolies", the antagonistic race of creatures from the first ''Bubsy'' game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gematsu.com/2017/06/accolade-returns-announces-bubsy-woolies-strike-back-ps4-pc|title=Accolade returns, announces Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back for PS4, PC - Gematsu|date=8 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The game was first announced on June 8, 2017, as a brand new game in the ''[[Bubsy]]'' series of video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-06-08-bubsy-returns-in-his-first-game-in-21-years|title=Bubsy returns in his first game in 21 years|first=Jeffrey|last=Matulef|date=8 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entry is the first one in the series in 21 years, following 1996's ''[[Bubsy 3D]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2017/06/09/bubsy-makes-return-videogames-first-time-21-years/|title=Bubsy Makes His Return To Videogames For The First Time In 21 Years|date=9 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was announced as the first of many game franchise revivals of [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]] games (which, along with ''Bubsy'', is a brand name now operated by [[Hong Kong]] company [[Billionsoft]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billionsoftware.com/|title=Billionsoft|website=Billionsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;), including potential revivals of ''[[HardBall!]]'', ''[[Slave Zero]]'', ''[[Deadlock: Planetary Conquest]]'', ''[[Eradicator (video game)|Eradicator]]'', and ''[[Redline (1999 video game)|Redline]]''.&lt;ref name="rockpapershotgun.com"/&gt; The game was published by [[Tommo]]'s subsidiary [[UFO Interactive Games]], and developed by [[Black Forest Games]], who previously worked on reviving the dormant ''[[The Great Giana Sisters|Giana Sisters]]'' series with ''[[Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/08/bubsy-the-woolies-strike-back-announced|title=Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back Announced|first=Evan|last=Campbell|date=8 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''Twisted Dreams'', the game was developed using the [[Havok (software)|Havok]] physics engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://za.ign.com/bubsy-the-woolies-strike-back/107377/news/bubsy-the-woolies-strike-back-announced|title=Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back Announced|date=9 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, a limited edition, called the ''Purrfect Edition'', was announced for the PlayStation 4 release, which contains a physical copy of the game, a soundtrack CD, a copy of Bubsy's official "business card", and a "Mystery Bubsy Movie Poster postcard".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.accoladegame.com/single-post/2017/08/23/Bubsy-annouces-October-31th-release-date-for-regular-and-limited-edition-version|title=Bubsy announces October 31st release date for regular and limited edition version|date=22 August 2017|publisher=Official Accolade Game website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game announcement was generally not well received by video game journalists, whose reactions ranged from indifference to irritation.&lt;ref name="VG247"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2017/06/09/bubsys-back-and-even-sonic-is-being-mean-about-it/|title=Bubsy’s back, and even Sonic is being mean about it|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/6/8/15762950/a-new-bubsy-video-game|title=Bubsy ... they’re making another one of those|first=Michael|last=McWhertor|date=8 June 2017|website=Polygon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/06/09/bubsy-the-bobcat-is-back-but-not-even-sonic-the-hedgehog-knows-why-6698329/|title=Bubsy The Bobcat is back, but not even Sonic The Hedgehog knows why|first=GameCentral for|last=Metro.co.uk|date=9 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accolade seemed to expect this, taking an approach similar to [[Sega]] with promoting ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' on [[social media]]; a dedicated [[Twitter]] account for the character that makes self-deprecating and aware comments about the franchise's negative reception of some past titles was created.&lt;ref name="VG247"/&gt;

==Reception==
The game was met with a negative reception, with [[Review aggregator|review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]] giving the PC version a [[Weighted average|weighted average]] score of 44 out of a possible 100&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/bubsy-the-woolies-strike-back|title=Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back - PC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the PS4 version a score of 45 out of 100,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/bubsy-the-woolies-strike-back|title=Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back - PS4}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating "generally unfavorable reviews". Brian Shea of ''[[Game Informer]]'' panned the game, calling it "an unnecessary resuscitation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shea|first=Brian|date=1 November 2017|title=Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/bubsy_the_woolies_strike_back/b/playstation4/archive/2017/11/01/bubsy-the-woolies-strike-back-game-informer-review.aspx|website=gameinformer.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Hancock of ''[[Destructoid]]'' questioned why the character of Bubsy was brought back and made note of its release in the same year as other more well received platformers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hancock|first=Patrick|date=2 November 2017|title=Review: Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back|url=https://www.destructoid.com/review-bubsy-the-woolies-strike-back-470439.phtml|website=destructoid.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heidi Kemps of [[IGN]] dismissed the game as "an extremely short and completely forgettable platformer based on nothing but irony and nostalgic notoriety".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kemps|first=Heidi|date=3 November 2017|title=BUBSY: THE WOOLIES STRIKE BACK REVIEW|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/11/03/bubsy-the-woolies-strike-back-review|website=IGN|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Donlan of ''[[Eurogamer]]'' wrote "Bubsy's return is more than a little underwhelming".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Donlan|first=Christian|date=3 November 2017|title=Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back review|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-11-03-bubsy-the-woolies-strike-back-review|website=Eurogamer|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, ''[[Hardcore Gamer]]'' gave the game 3.5 out of 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2017/11/03/review-bubsy-the-woolies-strike-back/277861/|title=Review: Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back - Hardcore Gamer|website=www.hardcoregamer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was a runner-up for the "Worst Game (That We Played)" award at [[Giant Bomb]]'s Game of the Year 2017 Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Giant Bomb staff |date=29 December 2017 |title=Game of the Year 2017 Day Five: Best, Worst, Cast, and Capture |url=https://www.giantbomb.com/articles/game-of-the-year-2017-day-five-best-worst-cast-and/1100-5708/ |publisher=Giant Bomb |accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Sequel==
In October 2018, a sixth ''Bubsy'' title, ''Bubsy: Paws on Fire!'', was announced for release in 2019 for [[PlayStation 4]], [[Personal computer|PC]] and [[Nintendo Switch]]. The game was developed by [[Choice Provisions]], who previously worked on the [[Bit.Trip]] Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://comicbook.com/gaming/2018/10/31/bubsy-returning-2019-paws-on-fire-nintendo-switch-playstation-4/|title='Bubsy' Returning In 2019 With 'Paws on Fire!'

'''Cabo Wabo''' is a nightclub and restaurant located in [[Cabo San Lucas|Cabo San Lucas, BCS, Mexico]].  [[Franchising|Franchise]]s exist in [[Harvey's Lake Tahoe]] in [[Stateline, Nevada|Stateline]], [[Nevada]], the [[Las Vegas Strip]], and on Hollywood Boulevard in [[Hollywood, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[LA Weekly]]|title=Cabo Wabo|url=http://www.laweekly.com/location/cabo-wabo-cantina-2615214|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704073310/http://www.laweekly.com/location/cabo-wabo-cantina-2615214|archivedate=2015-07-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a popular brand of [[tequila]].  All were founded by rock musician [[Sammy Hagar]].

==Cantina==
[[File:Sammy Hagar.jpg|thumb|left|Hagar performing at the Cabo Wabo]]
Hagar, already a successful [[rock musician]], visited the [[Mexico|Mexican]] town of Cabo San Lucas in the early 1980s. Hagar joined [[Van Halen]] in July 1985 after the departure of their former singer, [[David Lee Roth]]. Seeking a place for himself and his friends to relax and play music, he convinced the Van Halen members to partner in opening a large bar, restaurant, and performance space.  Launched in April 1990, the [[cantina]] was initially a financial failure, leading Hagar to [[buyout|buy out]] his bandmates. Under new management, the bar became popular with both locals and tourists as the town quickly grew into a major resort. In 2004, after plans fell through to open in Las Vegas, Hagar opened a second location in the basement of the historic Harvey's casino on the south shore of Lake Tahoe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hagar Brings 'Cabo' To Tahoe|date= 2004-03-18|accessdate=2007-11-28|publisher=Billboard|author=Barry A. Jeckell|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000465641}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Sioux City Journal|accessdate=2007-11-28|title=There's life after Van Halen|author=Bruce R.

Cabo Wabo Las Vegas opened in The Miracle Mile shopping center at Planet Hollywood in November 2009. The club typically attracts an older adult clientele with its mostly rock music selection.&lt;ref name="Cabo San Lucas Nightlife"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cabo San Lucas Nightlife|url=http://www.luxuryvillacollections.com/cabo-san-lucas-nightlife.htm|publisher=Luxury Villa Connections|accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hagar claims he coined the name after watching a man walk unsteadily along a local beach after a heavy night's partying. Using the town's nickname, Cabo (which means "cape" in Spanish), and shortening "wobble" to "wabo" he said of the man that he was doing the "Cabo wabo."  Hagar later used the phrase in his lyrics and title for the Van Halen song.  In 1990 he hired Noel Vestri, an innovator in computer graphic designs (including work on [[Vans]] Tennis Shoes) to design a logo for the brand, which is still used today.

==Tequila==
[[File:InteriorCaboWabo.JPG|thumb|Patrons drinking in a portion of the cantina]]
In the late 1990s, Hagar began selling his patrons a house brand of hand-made tequila he commissioned from a family-owned distillery in the state of [[Jalisco]]. In 1999, a wine importer from [[Napa Valley]] began to import the tequila into the United States. An instant success, sales rose from 37,000 cases the first year to 140,000 cases in 2006, making it the second-best selling premium tequila in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Business Week]]|author=Perman, Stacy|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_18/b4032082.htm|title=Tequila With A Rock 'n' Roll Chaser: How Sammy Hagar took Cabo Wabo from a vanity hangout to a $60 million business|accessdate=2007-11-28|date=2007-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the Cabo Wabo offerings have performed quite well at international [[spirit ratings]] competitions. The [[wikt:añejo|añejo]] offering received three silver, one gold and one double gold medal at the [[San Francisco World Spirits Competition]] between 2008 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Proof66.com|author=Proof66.com|url=http://www.proof66.com/tequila/cabo-wabo-anejo-tequila.html|title=Proof66.com Ratings Summary Page for Cabo Wabo anejo|accessdate=2012-10-21|date=2012-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its reposado tequila received a score of 92 from the 2008 Beverage Testing Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Proof66.com|author=Proof66.com|url=http://www.proof66.com/tequila/cabo-wabo-reposado-tequila.html|title=Proof66.com Ratings Summary Page for Cabo Wabo reposado|accessdate=2012-10-21|date=2012-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007 it was announced that Hagar would sell an 80% interest in Cabo Wabo Tequila to [[Davide Campari - Milano|Gruppo Campari]], the world's sixth-largest spirits company, for $80 million. [[Skyy Spirits]] of San Francisco, a vodka producer and subsidiary of Gruppo Campari, planned to market Cabo Wabo globally, with continued participation by Hagar. Gerry Ruvo, president and chief executive of Skyy Spirits, said, "Sammy has done a fantastic job building the brand, so we are going to obviously spend time with him and work with him to continue our efforts to take the brand to an even larger level, both here in the US and, more important, globally." Ruvo said [[Great Britain]], [[Spain]], [[Australia]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[Japan]], [[Germany]] and [[Italy]] are considered key expansion markets for tequila.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''''Cinematic''''' is a nighttime show at [[Parque Warner Madrid]], that features [[fireworks]], characters, live actors, water effects, [[pyrotechnics]], lasers, music, searchlights, decorated boat floats, and mist screen projections. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.parquewarner.com/en/node/20315|title=This has been our 2015 season}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Synopsis==
''Cinematic'' transpires on the waters of the Warner Bros. Studios lake at [[Parque Warner Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.parquewarner.com/en/node/22188|title=Cinematic in Warner Park ... Action!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show begins with an announcer welcoming the guests, as he speaks jets of water shoot up in the center of the lake and a projection of the park logo appears on the wall of water. The music of the ''Hollywood Film Music Orchestra'' swells as the water changes from purple to red and all of the water jets are shooting in every which way. Just then scenes from iconic [[Warner Bros.]] films such as [[Free Willy]], and [[Speed Racer (film)|Speed Racer]] play out on the massive wall of water. The water shoots higher and continuously changes colors, until more projections appear of films such as [[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]], [[The Great Gatsby (2013 film)|The Great Gatsby]], and [[Beetlejuice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pa-community.com/parques/parque-warner/espectaculos/hollywood-fantasy|title=Warner Cinematic|publisher=PA Community}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Rorvik was born in [[Circle, Montana]].  He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from the University of Montana in 1966 and a [[Master of Science|M.S.]]  ''[[summa cum laude]]'' from the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]] in 1967.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} He worked as a science writer and a medical reporter for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and contributed articles to numerous publications, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', and wrote several books.

In a 1969 magazine article, Rorvik outlined the [[Shettles Method]] to influence the sex of a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Rorvik |first= David Michael |authorlink= David Rorvik |date= 1969-05-19 |title= Your Baby's Sex: Select, Don't Settle |journal= [[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]] |volume=2 |issue= 20 |pages= 37–38 |publisher= New York Media Holdings |accessdate= 2011-02-22 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=d90CAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=David+Rorvik+%22columbia+university%22#v=onepage&amp;q=David%20Rorvik%20%22columbia%20university%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, he and [[Landrum B. Shettles]] co-authored the bestselling book ''Your Baby's Sex: Now You Can Choose''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Rorvik |first1= David Michael |last2= Shettles |first2= Landrum Brewer  |authorlink2= Landrum Brewer Shettles |title= Your Baby's Sex: Now You Can Choose|year= 1980 |origyear= 1971 |publisher= [[Bantam Books]] |location= [[New York City]] |isbn= 978-0-553-14277-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, Rorvik was awarded an [[Alicia Patterson Foundation]] Fellowship for investigatory reporting on the politics of cancer research worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aliciapatterson.org/users/david-m-rorvik Alicia Patterson Foundation Fellow David M. Rorvik] Profile page. Fellowship title: "Cancer Research".&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of his findings from this investigation were reported on in Harper's Magazine, the Washington Post and other publications.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Earlier in his career, he was the recipient of a Pulitzer Traveling Fellowship for investigation of the effects of apartheid politics in Africa on press freedoms.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==''In his Image''==

In ''In his Image'', Rorvik claimed that in 1973 a wealthy businessman he dubbed "Max" had contacted him and recruited him to find scientists willing to create a clone of him. Rorvik claims to have formed a scientific team that was taken to a lab at a secret location.  After a few years of experimentation they managed to implant a specially prepared body cell [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] into the [[cytoplast]] of a human [[ovum]] (a technique known as [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]]) and, in turn, succeeded in implanting  this egg into the [[uterus]] of a surrogate mother, a local resident called "Sparrow." A healthy child, it was claimed,  was born nine months later. He stated in the book that he was able to tell the story only on the condition that he safeguard the identities of all involved and cautioned his readers that the book did not provide proof that the cloning had occurred, although he stated he was convinced that it had.

Before the book was published, the ''[[New York Post]]'' learned of the story and made it front-page news on March 3, 1978. Soon after, [[NBC]]'s [[Tom Brokaw]] interviewed Rorvik on ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]''. The book was very popular and caused much discussion about the [[ethics of cloning]]. However, scientists including [[Yale University]] professor [[Clement Markert]] generally disbelieved Rorvik's claims. Efforts to clone mammals had not been undertaken at that time and it was widely assumed that there would be enormous obstacles to achieving successful mammalian cloning.

British scientist [[Derek Bromhall]] filed a $7,000,000 defamation suit against Rorvik's publisher, [[J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co.|J. B. Lippincott]], alleging that the book was a hoax, that it incorporated parts of his [[dissertation|doctoral thesis]] as the theoretical basis for the cloning process, and that it had used his name without permission. When Rorvik refused to reveal the identity of "Max" or provide proof of the existence of the clone, judge John Fullam found that the book was a "fraud and a hoax" in a pretrial ruling. The case went to trial in 1982, with the charges being reduced to invasion of privacy. The publisher soon entered into an out-of-court settlement that included a payment of $100,000 and a public representation that the book was a hoax. No evidence, however, was presented in pre-trial proceedings, during the trial, or thereafter that established either the truthfulness or the falsity of the book. Rorvik himself denied that there had been any hoax, and refused either to be party to the out-of-court settlement or to contribute to it financially.&lt;ref&gt;Broad, William J. "Publisher Settles Suit, Says Clone Book Is a Fake." ''Science'', Vol. 216. April 23, 1982. p.391. {{doi| 10.1126/science.216.4544.391-a}} {{PMID|11643742}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote an article defending ''In his Image'' for ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]'' in 1997.

Rorvik has since written, ghost-written, edited and agented several books on diet and nutrition, psychology and other topics, including the ''Physician Desk Reference for Nutritional Supplements'' (2001). &lt;!-- His most recent book is ''Brave New Baby: Promise and Peril of the Biological Revolution'', published in 2003. (this is a reprint of a 1978 book) --&gt; In 2006, a sixth edition of ''Your Baby's Sex: Now You Can Choose'' was published, marking nearly 40 years of continuous print.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4182">In [[literature]], the '''deuteragonist''' or '''secondary main character''' (from {{lang-grc|δευτεραγωνιστής}}, ''deuteragōnistḗs'', second actor) is the second most important  character, after the [[protagonist]] and before the [[tritagonist]].&lt;ref name="deut1"&gt;Bartleby.com (2006). [http://www.bartleby.com/61/56/D0175600.html Deuteragonist]&lt;/ref&gt; The deuteragonist may switch between supporting and opposing the protagonist, depending on the deuteragonist's own conflict or plot.

==History==
[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[drama]] began with simply one actor, the protagonist, and a [[Greek chorus|chorus]] of dancers. The playwright [[Aeschylus]] introduced the deuteragonist; Aristotle says in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'':

{{Quote
|1={{lang|grc|Καὶ τό τε τῶν ὑποκριτῶν πλῆθος ἐξ ἑνὸς εἰς δύο πρῶτος Αἰσχύλος ἤγαγε καὶ τὰ τοῦ χοροῦ ἠλάττωσε καὶ τὸν λόγον πρωταγωνιστεῖν παρεσκεύασεν}}

''{{lang|grc-Latn|Kai to te tōn hypokritōn plēthos ex enos eis duo prōtos Aiskhilos ēgage kai ta tou khorou ēlattōse kai ton logon prōtagōnistein pareskeuasen}}''

Thus, it was Aeschylus who first raised the number of the actors from one to two. He also curtailed the chorus and made the dialogue be the leading part.
|2=[[Aristotle]]
|3=[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]] (1449a15)&lt;ref name="deut2"&gt;Perseus Digital Library (2006). [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Poet.+1449a Aristotle, ''Poetics'']&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Aeschylus' efforts brought the dialogue and interaction between characters to the forefront and set the stage for other playwrights of the era, like [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], to produce many iconic plays.&lt;ref name="deut3"&gt;TheatreHistory.com (2006). [http://www.theatrehistory.com/ancient/aeschylus001.html "Aeschylus and his Tragedies"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drama==
Because [[Ancient Greek drama]] involved only three actors (the protagonist, deuteragonist, and tritagonist) plus the chorus, each actor often played several parts. For instance, in Sophocles' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', the protagonist would be [[Oedipus]], who is on stage in most acts, the deuteragonist would be [[Jocasta]] (Oedipus' mother and wife), as well as the Shepherd and Messenger. This would be because Jocasta is certainly a major role&amp;mdash;acting opposite Oedipus many times and occupying a central part of the story&amp;mdash;and because the Shepherd and Messenger are onstage when Jocasta is offstage.&lt;ref name="deut4"&gt;Wayne S. Turney (2006). [http://www.wayneturney.20m.com/oedipus.htm Sophokles' ''Oedipus Rex'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
In literature, the deuteragonist often assumes the role of "[[sidekick]]" to the protagonist. In [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'', the protagonist is [[Huckleberry Finn (character)|Huck]] and the deuteragonist, his constant companion, is [[Jim (Huckleberry Finn)|Jim]]. In this story the tritagonist would be [[Tom Sawyer]].&lt;ref name="deut5"&gt;Dr. L. Kip Wheeler (2006). [http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms_T.html Literary Vocabulary]&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the deuteragonist could also be a particularly visible [[antagonist]], normally whom the actual antagonist hides behind. In some cases, the deuteragonist is a sidekick who is also used as a foil for the protagonist, in order to more greatly enhance the powers or strengths of the main character. [[Doctor Watson|Dr. John Watson]], for example, in the [[Sherlock Holmes]] series by [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], is an educated and intelligent gentleman of professional standing, and yet his own intelligence is of too rigid a stance to embrace fully the kind of possibilities of which the more maverick [[Sherlock Holmes]] is capable.

A '''double bass array''' (DBA) is a specific layout of [[Subwoofer|subwoofers]] within a rectangular listening space. It removes unwanted room related resonances ([[Room modes|modes]]) over a wide listening area.

== Preface ==
A DBA requires at least two subwoofers (preferably same make and model) that are placed at opposing walls in a specific layout. The subwoofer array on the back wall is inverted and delayed based on the distance to the frontal subwoofer array. This will actively "absorb" any reflected sound.

== Design ==
=== Array layout ===
[[File:DBA4.PNG|thumb|Common configuration with 4 subwoofer]]
Modes between side walls, floor and ceiling are suppressed by arranging the subwoofer in a specific grid:

&lt;math&gt;p_x {=} \frac{(2 \cdot n + 1) \cdot w_x}{2 \cdot a_x}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;p_y {=} \frac{(2 \cdot n + 1) \cdot w_y}{2 \cdot a_y}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;w_x&lt;/math&gt;: Wall width

&lt;math&gt;w_y&lt;/math&gt;: Wall height

&lt;math&gt;p_x&lt;/math&gt;: Horizontal distance from wall (&lt;math&gt;d_x/2&lt;/math&gt; for n=0 in picture)

&lt;math&gt;p_y&lt;/math&gt;: Vertical distance from wall (&lt;math&gt;d_y/2&lt;/math&gt; for n=0 in picture)

&lt;math&gt;a_x&lt;/math&gt;: Number of subwoofers horizontally

&lt;math&gt;a_y&lt;/math&gt;: Number of subwoofers vertically

Counter &lt;math&gt;n = {0, 1, 2, 3,..., (a - 1)}&lt;/math&gt;
[[File:DBA Wellenfront.png|thumb|Top view of an array with 2 subwoofer. The walls create mirror sources which results in a plane wave.]]
With this specific grid layout reflections from the walls act as mirror sources. Interference of the subwoofers and mirror sources create a plane wave up to a certain frequency. The more sources the higher the frequency. This cutoff frequency &lt;math&gt;f_c&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated for each dimension as follows:

&lt;math&gt;f_c {=} \frac{c}{2 \cdot d}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;: [[Speed of sound]]

&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;: Distance between subwoofers

Example: A 4 × 4 array on a wall measuring 4 × 3 m would work up to 86Hz horizontally and up to 114Hz vertically.

=== Active Absorption ===
[[File:DBA Wellenfront2.png|thumb|Schematic of active absorption. The bass signal is shown as a  transversal wave. The frontal wave is reflected at the back wall. At the same time the back array sends out an inverted wave which cancels the reflection.]]
Due to the specific grid layout of the subwoofer array most modal effects are suppressed. The length modes on the other hand get fully excited. The array on the back wall will emit a polarity inverted wave at the very same moment the wave from the front wall hits the back wall. Reflection and inverted wave will interfere with each other destructively so the reflection is canceled. This is also known as "active absorption".

The necessary delay &lt;math&gt;t_d&lt;/math&gt; of the back array is based on the length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; of the room:

&lt;math&gt;t_d {=} \frac{l}{c} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;: [[Speed of sound]]

The necessary delay required for a DBA is available in most digital equalizers or digital crossovers. Polarity of the back array can easily be achieved by inverting the signal coming from the amps or by swapping the cables going to the driver. Most active subwoofers also offer a polarity switch.

== Pros ==
* Sound pressure level throughout the room is very even.
* Modal resonances are reduced to a minimum.
* Subwoofers should be placed as close as possible on the wall where they easily can be made invisible.
* No bulky acoustic room treatments or even structural modifications necessary.
* Simple setup.

== Cons ==
* Rooms properties and furniture can interfere with the propagation of the plane wave.
* Frequency range of the plane wave depends on the number of drivers which can be quite high in large rooms.
* As the back wall array is only used to cancel the energy of the frontal array the overall efficiency isn't good.
* SPL throughout the room is virtually constant which might affect tonal balance with satellite speakers that fall off with listening distance.

== Notes ==
A DBA just requires two opposing walls so it's possible to have one array on the floor and the other on the ceiling or one on the left wall and the other on the right. Low frequencies become localizable at a specific frequency though so in most cases it's probably a good idea to use the front wall and the back wall.

It largely depends on the room how good a DBA will work.
* The room should be rectangular
* Walls should be rigid
* Measuring equipment helps to dial in the necessary delay

==Story==
The game centers around the character Yangus, who is a main character in ''[[Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King|Dragon Quest VIII]]'', as a child.&lt;ref name="source"&gt;{{cite web| title=Four million Dragon Quest VIIIs shipped| url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/four-million-dragon-quest-viiis-shipped-6143340| author=Hirohiko Niizumi| work=[[GameSpot]]| date=January 30, 2006| accessdate=2012-08-04| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106212938/http://www.gamespot.com/news/four-million-dragon-quest-viiis-shipped-6143340| archivedate=November 6, 2012| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described as a "plump bandit", he becomes involved with his father Yampa's gang of thieves when a mysterious jug is brought home.&lt;ref name="IGNS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dragon Quest Yangus: Import Playtest|url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/702/702444p1.html|author=Anoop Gantayat|work=[[IGN]]|date=April 24, 2006|accessdate=2012-08-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927153002/http://ps2.ign.com/articles/702/702444p1.html|archivedate=September 27, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jump"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jump Fest 2005: Square Enix and Mistwalker show upcoming titles|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/jump-fest-2005-square-enix-and-mistwalker-show-upcoming-titles-6141529|author=Staff|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=December 19, 2005|accessdate=2012-08-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103011229/http://www.gamespot.com/news/jump-fest-2005-square-enix-and-mistwalker-show-upcoming-titles-6141529|archivedate=November 3, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though instructed not to touch the jug, Yangus does, and is sucked inside the bottle into another world called "Bottle Land".&lt;ref name="IGNS"/&gt;

[[File:Tontdue2.jpg|thumb|''[[James Tont operazione D.U.E.]]'' (1966) film poster spoofs the 007 hit ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]''.]]

'''Eurospy film''', or '''Spaghetti spy film''' (especially when referring to Italian-produced films in the genre),&lt;ref name="chapman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chapman|first1=James|title=Licence to Thrill: A Cultural History of the James Bond Films|date=2000|publisher=Columbia University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TiRjccIsxzIC&amp;pg=PA120#v=onepage&amp;q=%22spaghetti%20spy%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="parish"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parish|first1=James Robert|last2=Pitts|first2=Michael R.|title=The Great Spy Pictures|date=1974|publisher=Scarecrow Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EdkdAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22spaghetti+spy%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nbrm"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Films in Review|journal=National Board of Review of Motion Pictures|date=1974|volume=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FBBCAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22spaghetti+spy%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a genre of [[spy film]]s produced across [[Europe]], especially in [[Italy]], [[France]], and [[Spain]], that either imitated or parodied the British [[James Bond in film|James Bond]] series. The first wave of Eurospy films were released in 1964, two years after the first James Bond film, ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', and in the same year as the premiere of what many consider to be the apotheosis of the Bond series, ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]''. For the most part, the Eurospy craze lasted until around 1967 or 1968. In [[Italy]], where most of these films were produced, this trend replaced the declining [[sword and sandal]] genre.

[[Christopher Frayling]], who estimated the number of Eurospy films at 50, felt that they passed on such traits to the [[Spaghetti Western]] as emphasis on the technology of death, such as special weapons, the anonymity of the [[protagonist]], the "money = power" equation of the villains and humorous asides that released the audience's laughter after a violent sequence.&lt;ref&gt;p. 92 Frayling, Christopher. ''Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone'', I.B. Taurus, 2006. See [[Karl May]] and [[Sergio Leone]].&lt;/ref&gt;

For additional verisimilitude, these films often featured American and British stars in the lead roles.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, Matt &amp; Deal, David. ''The Eurospy Guide'', Luminary Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The heroes of the films were secret agents who were often given a name similar to "James Bond" (including "Charles Bind", "Charles Vine" and "James Tont"), and/or a code name matching, or similar to, James Bond's "007". Other Eurospy films made use of existing literary fictional spies, including [[Bulldog Drummond]], [[Harry Palmer]], Hubert Bonisseur de La Bath, AKA [[OSS 117]] (who was not based on James Bond but rather had helped to inspire James Bond), [[Francis Coplan]] and [[Rolf Torring]].

==Examples==
Some European stars and their films were renamed and retitled to cash in on the [[superspy]] craze. For example, [[Jesus Franco]]'s or "Jess Frank"'s 1962 ''La Muerte silba un Blues'' was later retitled ''077 Operation Jamaica'' or ''077 Operation Sexy'' with star [[Conrado San Martín]] rechristened "Sean Martin" to evoke images of [[Sean Connery]] and [[Dean Martin]] (who played [[Matt Helm]]). Germany's fictional hero [[Rolf Torring]]'s film ''[[13 Days to Die|Der Fluch des Schwarzen Rubin]]'' was retitled ''Agente S3S Operazione Uranio''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0058883|Der Fluch des schwarzen Rubin (1965)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continental Europe===
So many French and Italian films used "007" that [[United Artists]] told the Italian film industry that only James Bond could be 007, and threatened legal action.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, James. ''Licence to Thrill: A Cultural History of the James Bond Films'', I. B. Tauris, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Working around this restriction, many films were given similar, but legally acceptable, three-digit numbers in their titles such as the Italian-Spanish ''A 001, operazione Giamaica'' a.k.a. ''[[Our Man in Jamaica]]'' (1965) and the [[Secret Agent 077]] trilogy starring [[Ken Clark (actor)|Ken Clark]] (''[[Agent 077 – Mission Bloody Mary]]'', ''[[Agent 077 From the Orient with Fury]]'', and ''[[Special Mission Lady Chaplin]]''). ''[[008: Operation Exterminate]]'' (1965) from director [[Umberto Lenzi]] features the first female Bond-type hero. Lenzi also made three films starring [[Roger Browne]], ''[[Superseven chiama Cairo]]'' (1965), ''[[Last Man to Kill]]'' (1966), and ''[[The Spy Who Loved Flowers]]'' (1966). Browne was also in ''[[Password: Kill Agent Gordon]]'' (1966).

Director [[Bruno Corbucci]]'s James Tont series starring [[Lando Buzzanca]]&lt;ref&gt;p. 126 Biederman, Danny. ''The Incredible World of Spy-Fi: Wild and Crazy Spy Gadgets, Props and Artifacts from TV and the Movies'', Chronicle Books, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; is the earliest Italian comedy series based on 007. ''[[James Tont operazione U.N.O.]]'' (1965) features a female character named "Goldsinger" and underwater sequences that echo ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]''. This was quickly followed by the sequel ''[[James Tont operazione D.U.E.]]'' a.k.a. ''The Wacky World of James Tont'' (1965). Corbucci also wrote the screenplays for ''[[Kiss Kiss...Bang Bang]]'' (1966) and the [[Derek Flint]] parody ''[[Il vostro super agente Flit]]'' (1966). Another Bond spoof, ''[[Two Mafiosi Against Goldfinger]]'', also known as ''The Amazing Dr. G'' (1965), features [[Fernando Rey]] as a criminal mastermind named Goldginger.

[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent Bob Fleming is featured in a trio of Italian films, ''[[Secret Agent Fireball]]'' also titled ''Da 077: le spie uccidono a Beirut'' (1965), ''Killers are Challenged'' a.k.a. ''[[A 077, sfida ai killers]]'' (1966), directed by [[Antonio Margheriti]], and ''[[Fury in Marrakesh]]'', a.k.a. ''Furia a Marrakech'' (1966). Margheriti made one other spy film, ''[[Lightning Bolt (film)|Lightning Bolt]]'', a.k.a. ''Operazione Goldman'' (1966).

Other notable examples include ''[[Berlin, Appointment for the Spies]]'', a.k.a. ''Spy in Your Eye'' (Italy, 1965), the French ''[[OSS 117]]'' [[André Hunebelle]] series based on the [[Jean Bruce]] character &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fr&amp;u=http://www.oss117.org/&amp;oi=translate&amp;prev=/search?q=%2522oss+117%2522|title=Google Translate|author=|date=|website=translate.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Claude Chabrol]]'s ''[[Le Tigre aime la chair fraiche|Tiger]]'' trilogy (''[[Le Tigre aime la chair fraiche]]'', ''[[Le Tigre se parfume à la dynamite]]'', and ''Blue Panther'', a.k.a. ''Marie Chantal contre Dr.''), and the German ''[[Kommissar X]]'' and ''[[Jerry Cotton]]'' series. France's [[Eddie Constantine]] [[Nick Carter (literary character)|Nick Carter]] and [[Lemmy Caution]] series moved into espionage with several films, including [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s ''[[Alphaville (film)|Alphaville]]'' (1965).

The French [[Francis Coplan]] novels resulted in six films including ''[[Coplan Saves His Skin]]'' (1968). [[Jean Marais]] starred in the French-Italian ''The Reluctant Spy'' (1963) and ''Killer Spy'' (1965). [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]] was in the French spy spoof ''[[That Man From Rio]]'' (1964). American actor [[Ray Danton]] made two French films, ''[[Code Name: Jaguar]]'' (1965), ''[[Secret Agent Super Dragon]]'' (1966), and the Spanish-Italian 007 parody ''[[Lucky, el intrépido]]'' a.k.a. ''Lucky, the Inscrutable'' (1966) directed by [[Jesús Franco]]. Franco also made ''[[The Girl from Rio]]'' (1969) with ''Goldfinger'''s [[Shirley Eaton]] in the title role.

[[Dino De Laurentiis]]'s [[international co-production]] ''[[Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die]]'' (1966) was filmed in [[Rio de Janeiro]] using an American director and an Anglo-American cast ([[Mike Connors]], [[Terry-Thomas]], et al.) and a higher budget than most Eurospy films. A [[Touchstone (metaphor)|touchstone]] of this series of films was ''[[OK Connery]]'', a.k.a. ''Operation Kid Brother'' (1967) starring [[Neil Connery]], brother of the then-James Bond actor [[Sean Connery]], plus several actors from the official James Bond series. The director, [[Alberto De Martino]], also made ''[[Special Mission Lady Chaplin]]'' (1966) and ''[[The Spy with Ten Faces]]'' (1966) with [[Karin Dor]]. She was the first German Bond girl, appearing in ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' (1967).
	
British actor [[Stewart Granger]] starred in ''[[Red Dragon (1965 film)|Red Dragon]]'' (1965), ''[[Target for Killing]]'' (1966) with [[Adolfo Celi]] from ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', and ''[[Requiem for a Secret Agent]]'' (1966) in Italy along with [[Daniela Bianchi]]. In addition to the James Bond film ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' (1963), Bianchi made the Italian spy films ''[[Le Tigre aime la chair fraiche|Code Name: Tiger]]'' (1964), ''Special Mission Lady Chaplin'' (1966), and two 007 parodies: ''Balearic Caper'' (1966), and the previously mentioned ''[[O.K. Connery]]'' (1967). [[Sergio Sollima]], who directed ''[[Requiem for a Secret Agent]]'', also helmed two Bond-like films starring [[George Ardisson]], ''[[Agent 3S3: Passport to Hell]]'' (1965), and ''[[Agent 3S3, Massacre in the Sun]]'' (1966). Ardisson made a third Italian spy film, ''[[Operation Counter Spy]]'' (1965).

[[Marilù Tolo]] was in seven Italian/French-Italian productions: ''[[Espionage in Lisbon]]'' (1965), ''Balearic Caper'' (1966), ''[[Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die]]'' (1966), ''[[Perry Grant, agente di ferro]],'' a.k.a. ''[[The Big Blackout]]'' (1966), ''[[To Skin a Spy]]'' (1966), ''[[Judoka-Secret Agent]]'' (1966), and ''[[Casse-tête chinois pour le judoka]]'' (1967). And [[Luciana Paluzzi]] from ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' (1965) also made the French-Italian ''[[OSS 117 – Double Agent]]'' (1968).

Canadian-American actor [[Lang Jeffries]] played a secret agent in ''[[Agente X 1-7 operazione Oceano]]'' (Italy, 1965), ''[[Z7 Operation Rembrandt]]'' (Germany–Italy, 1966), ''[[Spies Strike Silently]]'' (Italy, 1966), ''[[The Beckett Affair]]'' (France-Italy, 1966), ''[[The Killer Lacks a Name]]'' (Spain–Italy, 1966), and ''[[Mexican Slayride (1967 film)|Mexican Slayride]]'' (Spain–Italy, 1967).

A post 1960s pair of films based on French author [[Gérard de Villiers]] [[Son Altesse Sérénissime|SAS]] series appeared in the 1980s, ''[[S.A.S. à San Salvador]]'' (1982) starring [[Miles O'Keeffe]] as Malko and ''[[Eye of the Widow]]'' (1989) with [[Richard Young (actor)|Richard Young]] as Malko.

===British films===

[[Daliah Lavi]], best known for her two American 007 spoofs ''[[The Silencers (film)|The Silencers]]'' (1966) and ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (1967), was in ''Shots in 3/4 Time,'' a.k.a. ''Spy Hunt in Vienna'' and ''Operation Solo'' (Germany, 1965) and British films ''[[The Spy with a Cold Nose]]'' (1966) and ''[[Some Girls Do]]'' (1969), starring [[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]]. He starred in ''[[Danger Route]]'' (1967) and ''[[Deadlier Than the Male]]'' (1967), the latter with [[Sylva Koscina]]. She made two other British films, ''[[Agent 8 3/4]]'' a.k.a. ''Hot Enough for June'' (1964), that featured a mention of Agent 007 and ''[[Our Man in Marrakesh]]'' a.k.a. ''Bang! Bang! You're Dead!'' (1966) and two Italian productions, ''[[That Man in Istanbul]]'' (1965) and ''[[Agent X-77 Orders to Kill]]'' (1966).

Other British-made films include ''Master Spy'' (1964), ''[[The Quiller Memorandum]]'' (1966), and ''[[Subterfuge (film)|Subterfuge]]'' (1968) starring [[Gene Barry]]. [[Michael Caine]] played the spy [[Harry Palmer]] in ''[[The Ipcress File (film)|The Ipcress File]]'' (1965), and four sequels. The semi-parody ''[[Licensed to Kill (1965 film)|Licensed to Kill]]'' a.k.a. ''The Second Best Secret Agent in the Whole Wide World'' (1965), directed by [[Lindsay Shonteff]], featured Bond-like agent Charles Vine. This was followed by two sequels: ''[[Where the Bullets Fly]]'' (1966), directed by [[John Gilling]], and an obscure Spanish production ''[[O.K. Yevtushenko]]'' a.k.a. ''Somebody's Stolen Our Russian Spy'' (1968). Shonteff went on to direct three more films with a similar spy named "Charles Bind": ''[[Number One of the Secret Service]]'' (1970), ''[[Licensed to Love and Kill]]'' a.k.a. ''The Man from S.E.X.'' (1979), and ''Number One Gun'' (1990).

===Post-sixties parodies===
Two French films starring [[Jean Dujardin]], 2006's ''[[OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies]]'' (set in 1955) and 2009's ''[[OSS 117: Lost in Rio]]'' (set in 1967) both recreate the style of the period and parody the spy genre for a new audience.

The American [[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]] series (1997–2002) of three comedies starring [[Mike Myers]] are set in the 1960s and 1970s. The trio parodies [[James Bond]] and other Eurospy films. [[Michael Caine]], as a character similar to his Harry Palmer role (''[[The Ipcress File (film)|The Ipcress File]]'', et al.), plays Powers' father in the third film, ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'' (2002).

The Spanish film ''[[Anacleto: agente secreto]]''/''Spy Time'' (2015) reimagines the 1964 comic hero for the screen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17534">'''Fair division''' is the problem of dividing a set of [[resources]] among several people who have an [[entitlement]] to them, such that each person receives his/her due share. This problem arises in various real-world settings, such as: division of inheritance, partnership dissolutions, [[divorce settlement]]s, electronic [[frequency allocation]], airport traffic management, and exploitation of [[Earth Observation Satellite]]s. This is an active research area in [[Mathematics]], [[Economics]] (especially [[Social choice theory]]), [[Game theory]], [[Dispute resolution]], and more. The central tenet of fair division is that such a division should be performed by the players themselves, maybe using a [[mediation|mediator]] but certainly not an [[arbitration|arbiter]] as only the players really know how they value the goods.

The archetypal fair division [[algorithm]] is [[Divide and choose|'''Divide and choose''']]. It demonstrates that two agents with different tastes can divide a cake such that each of them believes that he got the best piece. The research in fair division can be seen as an extension of this procedure to various more complex settings.

There are many different kinds of fair division problems, depending on the nature of goods to divide, the criteria for fairness, the nature of the players and their preferences, and other criteria for evaluating the quality of the division.

== Things that can be divided ==

Formally, a fair division problem is defined by a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and a group of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; players. A '''division''' is a partition of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; disjoint subsets: &lt;math&gt;X = X_1 \sqcup X_2 \sqcup\cdots \sqcup X_n&lt;/math&gt;, one subset per player.

The set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; can be of various types:

* X may be a finite set of '''indivisible''' items, for example: &lt;math&gt;X = \{piano, car, apartment\}&lt;/math&gt;, such that each item should be given entirely to a single person.
* X may be an infinite set representing a '''divisible''' resource, for example: money, or a cake. Mathematically, a divisible resource is often modeled as a subset of a real space, for example, the section [0,1] may represent a long narrow cake, that has to be cut into parallel pieces. The [[unit disk]] may represent an apple pie.

Additionally, the set to be divided may be:

* '''homogeneous''' – such as money, where only the amount matters, or
* '''heterogeneous''' – such as a cake that may have different ingredients, different icings, etc.

Finally, it is common to make some assumptions about whether the items to be divided are:

* '''goods''' – such as a car or a cake, or
* '''bads''' – such as house chores.

Based on these distinctions, several general types of fair division problems have been studied:

* '''[[Fair item assignment]]''' - dividing a set of ''indivisible and heterogeneous'' goods.
* '''Fair resource allocation''' - dividing a set of ''divisible and homogeneous'' goods. A special case is [[fair division of a single homogeneous resource]].
* '''[[Fair cake-cutting]]''' - dividing a ''divisible, heterogeneous good''. A special case is when the cake is a circle; then the problem is called [[Fair pie-cutting|'''fair pie-cutting''']].
* '''Fair [[chore division]]''' - dividing a ''divisible, heterogeneous bad.''

Combinations and special cases are also common:

*[[housemates problem|'''Rental harmony''']] (aka the '''housemates problem''') - dividing a set of ''indivisible heterogeneous goods'' (e.g., rooms in an apartment), and simultaneously a ''homogeneous divisible bad'' (the rent on the apartment).
*[[fair river sharing|'''Fair river sharing''']] - dividing waters flowing in an international river among the countries along its stream.
*[[Fair random assignment|'''Fair random assignment''']] - dividing lotteries over divisions - is especially common when allocating indivisible goods.

== Definitions of fairness ==

Most of what is normally called a fair division is not considered so by the theory because of the use of [[arbitration]]. This kind of situation happens quite often with mathematical theories named after real life problems. The decisions in the [[Talmud]] on [[entitlement (fair division)|entitlement]] when an estate is [[bankrupt]] reflect some quite complex ideas about fairness,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aumann | first1 = Robert J. | last2 = Maschler | first2 = Michael | year = 1985 | title = Game Theoretic Analysis of a bankruptcy Problem from the Talmud | url = http://www.elsevier.com/framework_aboutus/Nobel/Nobel2005/nobel2005pdfs/aum16.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Economic Theory | volume = 36 | issue =  | pages = 195–213 | doi = 10.1016/0022-0531(85)90102-4 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060220022042/http://www.elsevier.com/framework_aboutus/Nobel/Nobel2005/nobel2005pdfs/aum16.pdf | archivedate = 2006-02-20 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and most people would consider them fair. However they are the result of legal debates by rabbis rather than divisions according to the valuations of the claimants.

According to the [[Subjective theory of value]], there cannot be an objective measure of the value of each item. Therefore, ''objective fairness'' is not possible, as different people may assign different values to each item. Empirical experiments on how people define the concept of fairness&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Yaari | first1 = M. E. | last2 = Bar-Hillel | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1007/BF00297056 | title = On dividing justly | journal = Social Choice and Welfare | volume = 1 |page=1 | year = 1984 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; lead to inconclusive results.

Therefore, most current research on fairness focuses on concepts of ''subjective fairness''. Each of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; people is assumed to have a personal, subjective ''utility function'' or ''value function'', &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt;, which assigns a numerical value to each subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Often the functions are assumed to be normalized, so that every person values the empty set as 0 (&lt;math&gt;V_i (\empty) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all i), and the entire set of items as 1 (&lt;math&gt;V_i (X) = 1&lt;/math&gt; for all i) if the items are desirable, and -1 if the items are undesirable. Examples are:

* If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the set of indivisible items {piano, car, apartment}, then [[Alice and Bob|Alice]] may assign a value of 1/3 to each item, which means that each item is important to her just the same as any other item. [[Alice and Bob|Bob]] may assign the value of 1 to the set {car, apartment}, and the value 0 to all other sets except X; this means that he wants to get only the car and the apartment together; the car alone or the apartment alone, or each of them together with the piano, is worthless to him.
* If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a long narrow cake (modeled as the interval [0,1]), then, Alice may assign each subset a value proportional to its length, which means that she wants as much cake as possible, regardless of the icings. Bob may assign value only to subsets of [0.4, 0.6], for example, because this part of the cake contains cherries and Bob only cares about cherries.

Based on these subjective value functions, there are a number of widely used criteria for a fair division. Some of these conflict with each other but often they can be combined. The criteria described here are only for when each player is entitled to the same amount:

* A [[proportional division|'''proportional''' division]] means that every person gets at least his due share ''according to his own value function''. For instance if three people divide up a cake each gets at least a third by their own valuation, i.e. each of the ''n'' people gets a subset of ''X'' which he values as at least 1/''n'':
**&lt;math&gt;V_i(X_i) \ge 1/n&lt;/math&gt; for all i.
* A [[Super-proportional division|'''super-proportional''' division]] is one where each player receives strictly more than 1/''n'' (such a division exists only if the players have different valuations):
**&lt;math&gt;V_i(X_i) &gt; 1/n&lt;/math&gt; for all ''i''.
*An [[envy-free|'''envy-free''']] division guarantees that no-one will want somebody else's share more than their own, i.e. every person gets a share that he values at least as much as all other shares:
**&lt;math&gt;V_i(X_i) \ge V_i(X_j)&lt;/math&gt; for all i and j.
*A [[Group-envy-free|'''group-envy-free''']] division guarantees that no subset of agents envies another subset of the same size; it is much stronger than envy-freeness.
* An [[Equity (economics)|'''equitable''']] division means every person feels exactly the same happiness, i.e. the proportion of the cake a player receives by their own valuation is the same for every player. This is a difficult aim as players need not be truthful if asked their valuation:
**&lt;math&gt;V_i(X_i) = V_j(X_j)&lt;/math&gt; for all i and j.
*An [[exact division|'''exact division''']] (aka '''consensus division''') is one where all players agree on the value of each share :
**&lt;math&gt;V_i(X_i) = V_j(X_i)&lt;/math&gt; for all i and j.
**

All the above criteria assume that the participants have equal [[Entitlement (fair division)|entitlement]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. If different participants have different entitlements (e.g., in a partnership where each partner invested a different amount), then the fairness criteria should be adapted accordingly. See [[Proportional cake-cutting with different entitlements]].

== Additional requirements ==
In addition to fairness, it is sometimes desired that the division be [[Pareto optimal|'''Pareto optimal''']], i.e., no other allocation would make someone better off without making someone else worse off. The term efficiency comes from the [[economics]] idea of the [[efficient market]]. A division where one player gets everything is optimal by this definition so on its own this does not guarantee even a fair share. See also [[Efficient cake-cutting|'''efficient cake-cutting''']] and the [[Price of fairness|'''price of fairness''']].

[[Image:Berlin Blockade-map.svg|thumb|200px|right|Berlin divided by the [[Potsdam Conference]] ]]

In the real world people sometimes have a very accurate idea of how the other players value the goods and they may care very much about it. The case where they have complete knowledge of each other's valuations can be modeled by [[game theory]]. Partial knowledge is very hard to model. A major part of the practical side of fair division is the devising and study of procedures that work well despite such partial knowledge or small mistakes.

An additional requirement is that the fair division procedure be a [[truthful mechanism]], i.e., it should be a dominant strategy for the participants to report their true valuations. This requirement is usually very hard to satisfy in combination with fairness and Pareto-efficiency. 

A generalization of the problem is to allow each interested party to consist of several players who share the same set of resources but have different preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manurangsi|first1=Pasin|last2=Suksompong|first2=Warut|year=2017|title=Asymptotic Existence of Fair Divisions for Groups|journal=Mathematical Social Sciences|volume=89|pages=100–108|doi=10.1016/j.mathsocsci.2017.05.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suksompong|first1=Warut|year=2018|title=Approximate Maximin Shares for Groups of Agents|journal=Mathematical Social Sciences|volume=92|pages=40–47|doi=10.1016/j.mathsocsci.2017.09.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedures ==

A fair division [[Algorithm|procedure]] lists actions to be performed by the players in terms of the visible data and their valuations. A valid procedure is one that guarantees a fair division for every player who acts rationally according to their valuation. Where an action depends on a player's valuation the procedure is describing the [[strategy]] a rational player will follow. A player may act as if a piece had a different value but must be consistent. For instance if a procedure says the first player cuts the cake in two equal parts then the second player chooses a piece, then the first player cannot claim that the second player got more.

What the players do is:

* Agree on their criteria for a fair division
* Select a valid procedure and follow its rules

It is assumed the aim of each player is to maximize the minimum amount they might get, or in other words, to achieve the [[minimax|maximin]].

Procedures can be divided into ''discrete'' vs. ''continuous'' procedures. A discrete procedure would for instance only involve one person at a time cutting or marking a cake. Continuous procedures involve things like one player [[moving-knife procedure|moving a knife]] and the other saying "stop". Another type of continuous procedure involves a person assigning a value to every part of the cake.

For a list of fair division procedures, see [[:Category:Fair division protocols]].

== History ==

According to [[Sol Garfunkel]], the cake-cutting problem had been one of the most important open problems in 20th century mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;Sol Garfunkel. More Equal than Others: Weighted Voting. For All Practical Purposes. COMAP. 1988&lt;/ref&gt; when the most important variant of the problem was finally solved with the [[Brams-Taylor procedure]] by [[Steven Brams]] and [[Alan D. Taylor|Alan Taylor]] in 1995.

[[Divide and choose]]'s origins are undocumented. The related activities of [[bargaining]] and [[barter]] are also ancient. [[Negotiation]]s involving more than two people are also quite common, the [[Potsdam Conference]] is a notable recent example.

The theory of fair division dates back only to the end of the second world war. It was devised by a group of [[Poland|Polish]] mathematicians, [[Hugo Steinhaus]], [[Bronisław Knaster]] and [[Stefan Banach]], who used to meet in the [[Scottish Café]] in Lvov (then in Poland). A [[proportional (fair division)]] division for any number of players called 'last-diminisher' was devised in 1944. This was attributed to Banach and Knaster by Steinhaus when he made the problem public for the first time at a meeting of the [[Econometric Society]] in Washington D.C. on 17 September 1947. At that meeting he also proposed the problem of finding the smallest number of cuts necessary for such divisions.

[[Envy-free cake-cutting#Short history|envy-free cake-cutting]].

== Fair division in popular culture ==

* In ''[[Numb3rs]]'' season 3 episode "One Hour", Charlie talks about the cake-cutting problem as applied to the amount of money a kidnapper was demanding.
* [[Hugo Steinhaus]] wrote about a number of variants of fair division in his book ''Mathematical Snapshots''. In his book he says a special three-person version of fair division was devised by G. Krochmainy in Berdechów in 1944 and another by Mrs L Kott.&lt;ref&gt;Mathematical Snapshots. H.Steinhaus. 1950, 1969 {{ISBN|0-19-503267-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Martin Gardner]] and [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] have both published books with sections about the problem.&lt;ref&gt;aha! Insight. Martin. Gardner, 1978. {{ISBN|978-0-7167-1017-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;How to cut a cake and other mathematical conundrums. Ian Stewart. 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-19-920590-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Gardner introduced the chore division form of the problem. Ian Stewart has popularized the fair division problem with his articles in ''[[Scientific American]]'' and ''[[New Scientist]]''.
* A ''[[Dinosaur Comics]]'' strip is based on the cake-cutting problem.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=1345&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the Israeli movie [[Saint Clara (film)|Saint Clara]], a Russian immigrant asks an Israeli math teacher, how a circular cake can be divided fairly among 7 people? His answer is to make 3 straight cuts through its middle, making 8 equal pieces. Since there are only 7 people, one piece should be discarded, in the spirit of communism.

==Banned films==
Films banned in the aftermath the 11th Plenum of the [[Central Committee|ZK]]-[[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]]  include:

*''[[Der Frühling braucht Zeit|Spring Takes Its Times]]''
*''[[Trace of Stones]]''
*''[[Denk bloß nicht, ich heule|Just Don't Think I'll Cry]]''
*''[[Jahrgang '45|Born in 1945]]''

*''[[Karla (1965 film)|Karla]]''
*''[[Der verlorene Engel|The Lost Angel]]''
*''[[Wenn du gross bist, lieber Adam|When You're Older, Adam]]''
*''[[Fräulein Schmetterling|Mademoiselle Butterfly]]''
*''[[Hands Up or I'll Shoot]]''
*''[[Berlin um die Ecke|Berlin, Around the Corner]]''

== FSK and Film Regulation ==
While censorship was, on the surface, officially banned by the GDR constitution, in practice, it was used extensively,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; particularly when it came to the censorship of American and Western films. During the immediate post [[World War II|WWII]] period, while the GDR was still working to establish legitimacy, direct censorship was not a viable option.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Millington|first=Richard|year=|title=The Limits of Control: The Public Discourse About the June 17th 1953 Uprisings in Novels and Films in the German Democratic Republic.|url=|journal=German History|volume=31|pages=42–60|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GDR worked hard to separate its own ideal from American and Western Ideals, which they viewed as a threat to the [[Communism|Communist]] ideals &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hollywood Behind the Wall: The Cinema of East Germany|last=Berghahn|first=Daniela|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=Manchester, UK|pages=13|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early years of the Republic, between the 1950s and 1970s the East German government employed what they called ''[[Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft]]'', (FSK) which roughly translates to the Voluntary Self-Regulatory Body of the Film Industry. Though the name would suggest the organization was made up of volunteers, the actual members of the organization were appointed by the GDR government. Many of these members worked in the film industry prior to the split of East and [[West Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Anastasia|year=2016|title=East Or West, Rodina is Best: Shaping a Socialist 'Heimat' In German and Soviet Film Of the Occupation Period.|url=|journal=German Life and Letters|volume=69|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These members were tasked with screening each film before it was released to the public. This organization censored numerous American and Western films claiming them to be unfit for public viewing. Although approval of the FSK was not supposed to be explicitly required, many theaters in the GDR refused to show films that were not on the FSK approved list. The inner workings of the FSK were kept mostly secret from German citizens. The GDR's government did not want the average citizen to know they were being censored, in an effort to distance itself from its recent fascist past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ehrig|first=Stephan|year=2016|title=Rereading East Germany: The Literature and Film of the GDR.|url=|journal=Modern Language Review|volume=111|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keil|first=Andre|year=2016|title=The Preußenrenaissance Revisited: German-German Entanglements, the Media and the Politics of History in the Late German Democratic Republic.|url=|journal=German History|volume=32|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film Production In Germany ==
Germans in the pre WWII period were avid cinema goers. Over a billion cinema tickets were sold in 1943 alone in Germany.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After Germany’s surrender during the second world war, German citizens continued to flock to cinemas in large numbers; cinemas re opened even before Germany officially surrendered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Before the official split of East and West Germany, [[Allied leaders of World War II|Allied]] films were shown. As the rift between East and West became deeper and deeper, fewer Allied films were shown and were replaced with Soviet films. German citizens became well acquainted with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] accomplishments and the pitfalls of [[fascism]]. As the Soviets began to withdraw, the East German Government re-vamped an old Nazi era film production company. They centralized all the former Germany film production companies in and around Berlin into one monopolized film company, [[DEFA (film studio)|DEFA ]]. This company held a monopoly on every stage of film production in the GDR and was responsible for all film production released to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boyer|first=Dominic|year=2003|title=Censorship as a Vocation: The Institutions, Practices, and Cultural Logic of Media Control in the German Democratic Republic.|url=|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|volume=45|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geoff Peterson''' was an [[Animatronics|animatronic]] human skeleton that served as the [[sidekick]] on the late-night talk show ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]''. He was voiced and operated by [[Josh Robert Thompson]] and first appeared on ''The Late Late Show'' on April 5, 2010. Often referred to as a "robot skeleton", Peterson is a radio-controlled [[Animatronics|animatronic]] robot puppet designed and built by [[Grant Imahara]] of ''[[MythBusters]]''.&lt;ref name="Myth Busters"/&gt; He has glowing blue eyes, a metal [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]] (which is sometimes covered by a [[Santa Claus]] hat in December) and wears an oversized suit with his name scrawled on a contestant's name tag from ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' on his jacket, as well as [[Mardi Gras]] beads and a [[Super Bowl XLVII]] press pass around his neck. He serves as a co-host of sorts and Ferguson refers to him as "my gay robot pal". He was most visible during the first half of the show (the cold openings, monologues, and Tweets and Emails segments) and the final segment, "What Did We Learn on the Show Tonight, Craig?".

According to a Tweet from Imahara dated on December 23, 2016, Ferguson took the robot home as a souvenir after his run on ''The Late Late Show'' ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet |user=GrantImahara|number=812360026215960576|date = December 23, 2016 |title=For everyone who's asked me "What happened to Geoff?" I can report that he is safely with Craig in his personal office! }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
The idea came from [[Craig Ferguson]]'s repeated complaints that his show suffered due to its lack of a [[house band]] or [[sidekick]]&lt;ref name="tucker2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt; and his expressed desire to have his own "Robot Skeleton Army". Robot Skeleton Army is Ferguson's name for his [[Twitter]] followers, a reference to the [[cybernetic]] creatures from the [[Terminator (franchise)|''Terminator'' franchise]].&lt;ref name="tucker2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="npr"/&gt; ''MythBusters''{{'}} Grant Imahara volunteered to create the robot if Ferguson could get him 100,000 Twitter followers, which he achieved within 24 hours.&lt;ref name="tucker2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRY-5"/&gt; On the idea and development of Geoff:

{{quote|Initially, I wanted something which represented some kind of [[deconstruction]]ist contempt for the late-night genre and the idea of a sidekick, but [Josh Thompson] became so good at it, he just became a sidekick.|Craig Ferguson|April 2012&lt;ref name="Cordova2012"/&gt;}}

According to Imahara, he worked on it weekends and in his spare time, creating a "plastic skeleton with aluminum bones and torso" that "shares a lot with [[R2-D2]] and the [[Energizer Bunny]]" (both of which Imahara had previously worked on).&lt;ref name="tucker2010"/&gt; Ferguson was directly involved and "very into the design of it"; he and the show's writers "think they may want to send Geoff out into the world, interview people—things like that".&lt;ref name="tucker2010"/&gt; Imahara says the name "Geoff Peterson" was chosen by Ferguson:

{{quote|There was sort of a Twitter online poll as to what the name for the robot would be. And some people were saying "Roboskelly," some people were "Fergbot," there was probably about half a dozen names that people were talking about. And Craig just said, "No, the name is Geoff Peterson."|Grant Imahara|April 2010&lt;ref name="npr"/&gt;}}

Initially, the robot was able to say seven pre-recorded phrases, triggered by buttons under Craig's desk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2hhIFTla9w |title=Geoff Peterson 1.0 Intro|author=Grant Imahara|publisher=YouTube.com |date=August 2012 |accessdate=March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later upgraded to wireless control by one of the show's writers offstage using an [[iPad]].&lt;ref name="AutoRY-6"/&gt; Peterson was upgraded again in July 2010, allowing him to shake his head, keep his mouth open, and move his right hand up and down. Ferguson noted that this is because his "wise ass" chip was activated.&lt;ref name="AutoRY-7"/&gt; On September 2, 2013, new upgrades were debuted as the right arm now has an elbow and the previously motionless left arm now has full movement as well, although his left hand fell off during that night's episode. He can also now turn his eye lights off and on to simulate closing and opening his eyes.

==Role==
Peterson made occasional comments throughout the show and helped with the [[Twitter]] and [[email]] segment of the show. His comments where broad and often said as a segue to another joke or to make fun of something else, including Peterson himself, or as humorous [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non sequitur]]s. He was featured in numerous videos of "Tweets and E-mails" jingles. The first three were a parody of a [[Bollywood]] [[Filmi]] musical performance, a parody of an 80's [[glam metal]] performance,&lt;ref name="AutoRY-1"/&gt; and a [[Rick James]] parody.&lt;ref name="AutoRY-2"/&gt; [[Terminator (character)|Terminator]]-esque robot skeletons, which pre-date Peterson, appeared in jingles that parody the musical performances of artists such as [[Kraftwerk]], [[David Bowie]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Gary Glitter]], and [[Johnny Cash]]. Peterson didn't interact with the guests unless "they want to play around with him."&lt;ref name="Cordova2012"/&gt;

For Peterson's first anniversary, ''The Late Late Show'' filmed a [[Sketch comedy|sketch]] in Las Vegas that aired on the April 14, 2011 show. The segment depicted Ferguson, Peterson, and T.J. the [[Leprechaun]] partaking of "hallucinogenic frozen custard" with comedian [[Carrot Top]] and their subsequent gallivanting around Vegas. The sketch also featured appearances by Grant Imahara, [[Donny Osmond]], [[Secretariat (Craig Ferguson)|Secretariat]] (the show's [[pantomime horse]], voiced by Josh Thompson impersonating [[Morgan Freeman]]), and Wavy and Sid (Ferguson's [[alligator]] and [[rabbit]] puppets), which culminated in Ferguson and Peterson marrying one another at a typical Vegas chapel. For the episode, Peterson's voice was performed live for the first time by Thompson.&lt;ref name="AutoRY-3"/&gt;

Peterson's [[backstory]] was depicted during an episode which originally aired on January 3, 2012, opening with a skit purporting to be from Ferguson's first episode.&lt;ref name="OriginsOfGeoff"&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00uj405-I9s&amp;t=0m15s |title=The Man Behind Geoff the Robot|publisher=YouTube.com |date=June 7, 2012 |accessdate=August 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality==
Although generally amicable and friendly, Peterson could be defensive and easily angered if provoked by Ferguson or a guest, usually exclaiming "What the Hell man?!" if he was called out for his behavior or comments. A [[running gag]] on the show involved Craig making fun of how Geoff can only move one arm, and is unable to walk away from his podium, although he is somehow able to play an invisible harmonica. Geoff can now move both arms. On numerous occasions he taunted Geoff's requests, questions, and comments with his various inabilities, (e.g. when Geoff complained about how Craig got to be the host and do most of the talking while he stood at the [[lectern]], Craig retorted by saying Geoff could take his place as host "the day [he] was able to walk over [to his desk]").{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} Geoff's cause of death varies from a skydiving accident, a bar fight with [[Wilford Brimley]], being massively overweight, choking on a bird's foot, and a methamphetamine overdose. He is extremely rich and owns houses and laundromats all over the country.

Geoff has a mock feud with frequent guest [[Kristen Bell]], who claims that she had wanted to be Craig's sidekick and was upset when Geoff was selected.&lt;ref name="AutoRY-4"/&gt; Geoff typically gives her a lukewarm, sometimes nasty greeting, and she feels very uncomfortable around him.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; As of August 2011, Geoff and Kristen had supposedly reconciled while in [[Paris]] shooting ''Le Late Late Show avec Craig Ferguson à Paris''. [[Josh Robert Thompson]] referred to Geoff as a homosexual skeleton robot during a live stand-up routine, opening for Craig Ferguson in Hershey, PA on October 9, 2012.

==Voice==
[[File:Cigar night black.jpg|right|thumb|187px|[[Josh Robert Thompson]] performed the voice of Geoff Peterson.|alt=]]
Peterson's voice was originally performed by Ferguson in a loud, monotone, English accent;&lt;ref name="npr"/&gt; but this was soon changed. Starting on April 20, 2010, [[Josh Robert Thompson]] voiced Geoff Peterson using prerecorded clips of a vaguely [[George Takei]] sounding voice. From April 14, 2011 on, Thompson began to occasionally voice and perform Geoff live in-studio, and on May 16, 2011, in a possible backdoor audition, Thompson performed Geoff in an actual guest spot. From June 29, 2011 onward,&lt;ref name="AutoRY-8"/&gt; Thompson voiced and performed Geoff in-person for virtually every episode, including those filmed in [[Paris, France]] and [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name="AutoRY-9"/&gt; In April 2012, shortly after the news that Ferguson would continue his show until at least 2014, Ferguson told one interviewer that as far as he was concerned, Thompson "has a home" portraying Peterson for "as long as he wants to do it".&lt;ref name="Cordova2012"/&gt;

Thompson described Peterson's voice as "one part [[Snagglepuss]], one part [[Vincent Price]], two parts [[George Takei]]".&lt;ref name="AutoRY-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoRY-12"/&gt; Thompson says his live segments are "100% unscripted and improvised".&lt;ref name="AutoRY-13"/&gt; Since Thompson began voicing Geoff Peterson live, he has incorporated several of his own impressions into the character's repertoire. He also performed his [[Morgan Freeman]] impression for Freeman himself on June 10, 2011, asking the amazed actor "Would you like to hear my Morgan Freeman voice?" and "What would you like to say to yourself?". Freeman called the impression "outstanding".&lt;ref name="AutoRY-14"/&gt;

When Thompson was unavailable for two weeks starting with the November 7, 2011 show, Peterson was voiced by several celebrities: [[Alfred Molina]], [[Dominic Monaghan]], [[Thomas Lennon (actor)|Thomas Lennon]], [[Larry King]], [[Louie Anderson]], [[Lauren Graham]], [[Paula Poundstone]], [[Angela Kinsey]], [[Jason Schwartzman]], and [[Shadoe Stevens]] each for a single episode.&lt;ref name="guest"/&gt; During Thompson's absence in November 2011 and on December 19 for Christmas week, [[Thomas Lennon (actor)|Thomas Lennon]] again provided the voice of Peterson, in an alternate [[persona]] for Peterson known as Khloe Banderas.

==Reception==
Dorsey Shaw of [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]]'s Vulture blog described Peterson as "the ''de facto'' [[Animatronics|animatronic]] [[Henny Youngman|'King of the One-Liners']] for this generation".&lt;ref name="vulture"/&gt; Jaime Weinman of ''[[Maclean's]]'' said: "I think my favorite part of that is just the decision to give this mohawked skeleton robot a name as prosaically normal as Geoff Peterson."&lt;ref name="macleans"/&gt; Tom Jicha of ''[[Sun-Sentinel]]'' said that "some nights he's ridiculous, verbally jousting with the robot he [Ferguson] created and named, Geoff Peterson".&lt;ref name="sun-sentinel"/&gt; [[Linda Holmes (writer)|Linda Holmes]] of [[NPR]]'s Monkey See blog listed Peterson on her list of "50 Wonderful Things From 2010", writing: "Ferguson continues to be wonderful at what he does, and this was a marvelous marriage of the sensibility of his show with the sensibility of ''Mythbusters''."&lt;ref name="monkeysee"/&gt; ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked Peterson as one of their favorite robots in film and television.&lt;ref name="tvguide"/&gt;

Guests have often praised the chemistry between Ferguson and Peterson during their interviews on ''The Late Late Show''. [[Regis Philbin]] said "Y'know the robot? I've actually {{Sic|fell}} in love. I wasn't sure of the robot but he's grown on me. I think it's a great combination. You [Ferguson] say something funny, you turn around and look at him, and he [Peterson] says something funnier!"&lt;ref name="AutoRY-15"/&gt;

[[File:Gerard Croiset (1976).jpg|thumb|Gerard Croiset (1976)]]
'''Gerard Croiset''' born '''Gerard  Boekbinder''' (March 10, 1909{{spaced ndash}}July 20, 1980) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[parapsychology|parapsychologist]], [[Psychometry (paranormal)|psychometrist]] and [[psychic]]. He was often asked to help police detectives trace [[missing person]]s, though authenticated successes were few, and compared against the failures, his success rate was ruled no better than chance.

==Biography==
Croiset was born in [[Laren, North Holland|Laren]], [[North Holland]], in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inghist.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/BWN/lemmata/bwn5/boekbinder Boekbinder, Gerard (1909-1980)], [[Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands]]&lt;/ref&gt; He said he began to become aware of his gifts while a youth working for a watch repairer, and that on one occasion he held a ruler belonging to his employer and saw events which he related to his employer and which his employer confirmed were accurate.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Early work==
After [[World War II]], Croiset was sometimes consulted by Dutch police authorities for cases involving [[missing person]]s, or [[murder]]. On one occasion he was said to have examined the property of a murdered woman, and provided accurate information relating to her murder, and also gave the name of her murderer. The name matched a man who was being held in connection with the [[crime]]. He gained a reputation as a reliable consultant in the area of missing persons, and his fame extended beyond the Netherlands, as anecdotes about his abilities came to be discussed in other countries.  He also gained a reputation as a [[Energy (spirituality)|psychic healer]], and would allow people to visit him in his clinic for healing sessions.

==Missing children cases==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}
In 1966, he was invited to Australia to aid in an investigation relating to the disappearance of the three [[Beaumont children disappearance|Beaumont children]], who had disappeared without trace from a beach in Adelaide, South Australia. Although police were skeptical, his expenses were paid by the wealthy property tycoon Con Polites who was interested in the case, and publicity was such that Croiset's ideas were thought to be worthy of consideration. During his brief stay in Australia he attracted widespread publicity but failed to find any trace of the missing children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/clairvoyant-gerard-croiset-failed-to-crack-the-beaumont-case-but-gave-rise-to-the-psychic-detective/news-story/a953da44448792736481f0f1b445c4ad|title=Clairvoyant Gerard Croiset failed to crack the Beaumont case but gave rise to the ‘psychic detective’|author=Troy Lennon|date=25 January 2016|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1970, Croiset assisted in the investigation of the kidnapping of Muriel McKay in England. Mrs McKay was the wife of publishing tycoon Rupert Murdoch's Deputy Chairman Alick McKay. Croiset was asked by a McKay family friend, Eric Cutler, to help locate her. Croiset said that she was in a white farmhouse in the north or north east of London and that nearby to her was another farm and an abandoned aerodrome and that if she was not found within 14 days she would be dead. Her body was never found. Brothers Arthur and Nazimoodeen Hosein were convicted of her murder&amp;mdash;the first case in British history for a murder conviction without a body.

During the mid 1970s, he was invited to Puerto Rico to find the two missing children of a local businessman. He concluded that the children were no longer on an "earthly plane" and could offer no clues. Also, he was asked to locate a missing woman in Scotland, and once again failed to provide any clues.

Croiset's reputation became tarnished during his later years by his well publicised failures. However, he claimed to have achieved one more notable success when he was invited to Tokyo, Japan during the 1970s to locate a missing child. As he claimed, he had provided a description of the location in which her body could be found within 24 hours. When her body was found after following his instructions, all details seemed to match exactly with his prediction. There are no known independent sources for this claim.

In 1973, two little children were kidnapped by their father in Haute-Savoie (France). In 1976, Gérard Croiset declared briefly by phone: "They are in Italy". But the father doesn’t speak Italian, observed the mother. During a second phone call, Croiset’s secretary said that he couldn’t do anything more in this case. After having lived with his girls in Spain and Germany, the father was arrested in France in 1979. Some time later, the children told of their visit to friends in Italy just at that time when their mother telephoned with Gérard Croiset.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In another apparently successful case during May 1976, Croiset was flown from the Netherlands to Japan by a Japanese television station to see if he could help locate a missing seven-year-old girl. After being shown a picture of the missing girl, Miwa Kikuchi, Croiset stated that she was dead “on the surface of a lake near her home and near a quay for boats near a yellow protruding structure”.  The girl’s body was later recovered floating in the reservoir near a quay for rowing boats and a water supply tower, which was painted yellow. Although the press were astounded at Croiset’s paranormal abilities, some policemen stated that they would have found the girl’s body without Croiset’s help.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

He died in Utrecht in 1980, aged 71.

==Evaluation==
Croiset claimed he helped to solve the case of an assault of a girl in [[Wierden]], the Netherlands. The Chief of Police of Wierden stated however, that the information by Croiset was inaccurate and his communications were not used in the case.&lt;ref&gt;Neher, Andrew. (2011). ''Paranormal and Transcendental Experience: A Psychological Examination''. Dover Publications. p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; He was investigated under controlled conditions by The Belgian Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Phenomena Reputed to be Paranormal and they did not find any evidence of psychic ability.&lt;ref&gt;Clement, Stone and Browning, Norma. (1964). ''The Other Side of the Mind''. Prentice-Hall. p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/clairvoyant-gerard-croiset-failed-to-crack-the-beaumont-case-but-gave-rise-to-the-psychic-detective/news-story/a953da44448792736481f0f1b445c4ad|title=Clairvoyant Gerard Croiset failed to crack the Beaumont case but gave rise to the ‘psychic detective’|author=Troy Lennon|date=25 January 2016|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The skeptic James Lett has written:

{{blockquote|The truth is that the overwhelming majority of Croiset’s predictions were either vague and nonfalsifiable or simply wrong. Given the fact that Croiset made thousands of predictions during his lifetime, it is hardly surprising that he enjoyed one or two chance “hits”.&lt;ref name="Hoebens"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hoebens |first=Piet Hein |date=1981 |title='Gerard Croiset: Investigation of the Mozart of ‘Psychic Sleuths’ – Part I.'

The '''[[Grammy Award]]''' for '''Best Pop Instrumental Performance''' was awarded between 1969 and 2011.

*In 1969 it was awarded as '''Best Contemporary-Pop Performance, Instrumental'''
*From 1970 to 1971 it was awarded as '''Best  Contemporary Instrumental Performance''' 
*In 1972 it was awarded as '''Best Pop Instrumental Performance'''
*In 1973 it was awarded as '''Best Pop Instrumental Performance by an Instrumental Performer''' 
*From 1974 to 1975 it was again awarded as '''Best Pop Instrumental Performance'''
*From 1986 to 1989 it was awarded as '''Best Pop Instrumental Performance (Orchestra, Group or Soloist)'''
*Since 1990 it has again been awarded as '''Best Pop Instrumental Performance'''
*The award was discontinued from 2011 in a major overhaul of Grammy categories. From 2012, all instrumental performances in the pop category (solo or with a duo/group) were shifted to either the newly formed '''[[Best Pop Solo Performance]]''' or '''[[Best Pop Duo/Group Performance]]''' categories.

A similar award for [[Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Performance|Best Instrumental Performance]] was awarded from 1965 to 1968.  This was also in the pop field, but did not specify pop music.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2428">In [[mathematics]], and in particular the study of [[game theory]], a [[function (mathematics)|function]] is '''graph continuous''' if it exhibits the following properties.  The concept was originally defined by [[Partha Dasgupta]] and [[Eric Maskin]] in 1986 and is a version of [[continuous function|continuity]] that finds application in the study of [[continuous game]]s.

==Notation and preliminaries==
Consider a [[game]] with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; agents with agent &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; having strategy &lt;math&gt;A_i\subseteq\Bbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;; write &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; for an N-tuple of actions (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\in\prod_{j=1}^NA_j&lt;/math&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_{-i}=(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{i-1},a_{i+1},\ldots,a_N)&lt;/math&gt; as the vector of all agents' actions apart from agent &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;U_i:A_i\longrightarrow\Bbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be the payoff function for agent &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

A '''game''' is defined as &lt;math&gt;[(A_i,U_i); i=1,\ldots,N]&lt;/math&gt;.
If a graph is continuous you should connect it if it's not then don't connect it.

==Definition==

Function &lt;math&gt;U_i:A\longrightarrow\Bbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is '''graph continuous''' if for all &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\in A&lt;/math&gt; there exists a function &lt;math&gt;F_i:A_{-i}\longrightarrow A_i&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;U_i(F_i(\mathbf{a}_{-i}),\mathbf{a}_{-i})&lt;/math&gt; is continuous at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_{-i}&lt;/math&gt;.

Dasgupta and Maskin named this property "graph continuity" because, if one plots a graph of a player's payoff as a function of his own strategy (keeping the other players' strategies fixed), then a graph-continuous payoff function will result in this graph changing continuously as one varies the strategies of the other players.

The property is interesting in view of the following theorem.

If, for &lt;math&gt;1\leq i\leq N&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A_i\subseteq\Bbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; is non-empty, [[Convex function|convex]], and [[compact set|compact]]; and if &lt;math&gt;U_i:A\longrightarrow\Bbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is [[quasi-concave function|quasi-concave]] in &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt;, [[upper semi-continuous]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;, and graph continuous, then the game &lt;math&gt;[(A_i,U_i); i=1,\ldots,N]&lt;/math&gt; possesses a [[pure strategy]] [[Nash equilibrium]].

The '''ILA Berlin Air Show''' ([[German language|German]]: '''Internationale Luft- und Raumfahrtausstellung''' ('''ILA''')) combines a major trade exhibition for the [[Aerospace industry|aerospace]] and [[defence industry|defence]] industries with a public [[airshow]].
It is held every even year at the new [[Berlin ExpoCenter Airport]] near [[Schönefeld]], [[Brandenburg]] 18&amp;nbsp;km southeast of [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. The [http://www.ila-berlin.com most recent ILA Berlin Air Show] was held in April 2018.

Established in 1909, it claims to be world's oldest [[air show]], and it is among the largest and most important [[aerospace]] trade fairs today. According to the organisers Messe Berlin GmbH, in 2012 the Berlin Air Show attracted 125,000 professional visitors and 105,000 members of the general public, with 3,600 journalists from 65 countries also attending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ila-berlin.com/ila2012/aussteller/fakten_e.cfm |title=ILA statistics at a glance |accessdate=20 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317173031/http://www.ila-berlin.com/ila2012/aussteller/fakten_e.cfm |archivedate=17 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The format is similar to the [[Paris Air Show]] in France and the [[Farnborough Airshow|Farnborough International Airshow]] in Britain, the other major events in the European air show calendar. The Berlin event starts with three professional days closed to the general public, and then on Friday, Saturday and Sunday the public are allowed in.

The main display sections planned for 2014 include commercial air transport, space, military aviation, helicopters and both civil and military unmanned aircraft systems, also known as [[UAVs]].

==History==
It was first held in [[Frankfurt am Main]] in 1909, and as such can lay claim to being the oldest [[Airshow|aviation show]] in the world. After the first ILA, following the idea of the aircraft constructor [[August Euler]], numerous flying clubs combined to form the German Pilots' Association in April 1910. Shortly after, the Association of German Aircraft Makers was founded in Frankfurt/Main, establishing close ties between the ILA and the future Federal Association of the Aerospace Industry (BDLI), an organisation that exists today.

Before the [[First World War]], the ILA was held in [[Berlin]] (1912 and later on in 1928). When Germany regained air sovereignty after the [[Second World War]], the foundations were laid in 1955 for an "International Show for Travel by Air", which in 1957 took place at [[Langenhagen Airport]] as part of the [[Hanover Trade Fair]], the first in a run of ILA shows in [[Hanover]] that was to last over 30 years.

Known initially as the ''German Aviation Show'', the fair was increasingly attracting participants from abroad, and in 1978 the symbolic three letters ILA from 1909 were revived. In 1992, the far-reaching political and economic changes which had taken place in [[Europe]] since the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] opened the way for the ILA to return to its birthplace in Berlin. The ILA’s main display sections include commercial aviation, aerospace, military aviation and military technology, equipment and engines, and general aviation and helicopters.

The new multi-purpose exhibition area, called [[Berlin ExpoCenter Airport]] adjacent to the BER was finished in time for ILA 2012. The main section of the grounds cover approximately 250,000 square metres.

The site is situated {{convert|18|km|abbr=on}} southeast of Germany's capital city [[Berlin]].

==ILA 2006==

All previous attendance records had been broken at ILA2006. More than 250,000 visitors (2004: 201,500, +25%) were recorded at the ILA2006 between 16 and 21 May, including 115,000 trade visitors (2004: 105,000). Events on the southern section of Berlin-Schönefeld airport were dominated by the signing of sales contracts and joint venture agreements worth billions, a display featuring some 340 aircraft, many of them making their first public appearance, and the largest number of delegations and conferences ever. 1,014 exhibitors from 42 countries (2004: 987 from 42 countries) presented products, systems and processes from every area of the aerospace industry. Several thousand experts from all over Europe and from overseas attended the more than 90 accompanying conferences in search of information. Some 4,100 media representatives from 70 countries provided comprehensive coverage of the main technical themes and the attractions for the public at the ILA2006.

[[File:Eurocopter Tiger.gif|thumb|[[Eurocopter Tiger]] of the [[German Army]] during the ILA 2006]]

ILA 2006 emphasised the importance of this sector for Germany in its role as a centre for the aerospace industry. Hans-Joachim Gante, Chief Executive of the BDLI, stated: "We have become one of the few sectors with sustainable growth in Germany, due above all to our innovative strengths." This was clearly demonstrated at the ILA2006, which is acquiring an increasingly international dimension, thereby strengthening its role as one of the world’s major meeting places for the industry. This was an ideal opportunity for the German aerospace industry to demonstrate that it is among the world leaders." Exhibitors expressed their satisfaction with the discussions and contacts and with the business deals that were finalised at this event. "In particular the decision to make Russia the partner country proved highly effective. Russia was very strongly represented and was able to establish numerous contacts and business links."

At the close of the event Stefan Grave, Project Director for Messe Berlin GmbH, summed up: "The ILA2006 underlined its major importance as a European marketing platform for this sector as well as again demonstrating its many attractions for the public. Trade visitors and the general public alike were fascinated by the high-tech products on display. Unprecedented numbers of people attended to see the [[Airbus A380]], an outstanding international flying display and the Space Hall.

Many high-ranking delegations attended, especially during the three Trade Visitors’ Days. In addition to the Federal Minister of Economics Michael Glos, the ILA 2006 also received visits from the Defence Minister Franz-Josef Jung, Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble, Transport Minister Wolfgang Tiefensee, the Minister at the Chancellor’s Office Dr. Thomas de Maizière and the heads of the regional governments in Brandenburg and Berlin, Matthias Platzeck and Klaus Wowereit. Germany’s armed forces, the Bundeswehr, were very strongly represented: the Chief of the Armed Forces Wolfgang Schneiderhan attended the ILA 2006, as did the Chiefs of Staff of the Air Force and Army, Klaus-Peter Stieglitz and Hans-Otto Budde. A number of ministers from other countries also visited this event, accompanied by high-ranking delegations, thereby underlining the international importance of the ILA 2006. Among them were, from the partner country Russia, the Minister of Disaster Relief Sergei Schoigu, the Minister of Defence of the Netherlands, Henk Kamp, the Greek Defence Minister Evangelos Meimarakis, the French Transport Minister Dominique Perben, the Slovenian Defence Minister Karl Erjavec, the Albanian Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu and the Ukrainian Industry Minister [[Volodymyr Shandra]]. In addition 70 parliamentarians from 17 European countries were welcomed at the ILA2006.

The ILA2006 was organised jointly by the association representing the German aerospace industry, Bundesverband der Deutschen Luft- und Raumfahrtindustrie (BDLI) e.V., Berlin, and by Messe Berlin GmbH.

==ILA 2008==

ILA 2008 was held between 27 May and 1 June 2008 on the southern section of Berlin-Schönefeld Airport, which has been designated as the future Berlin Brandenburg International Airport (BBI). [[Chancellor of Germany (1949–)|Chancellor of Germany]] [[Angela Merkel]] attended the opening ceremony and welcomed international guests, among which a special place was dedicated to Indian operators, as India was chosen as 2008 edition's partner country. Special events were planned as part of 60th Anniversary of the [[Berlin Blockade|Berlin Airlift]] celebration. UK and US veterans from the cold war age Berlin airlift were invited as ILA's special guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ila-berlin.com/ila2008/presse/presse_volltext_e.cfm?id_nr=137 |title=ILA2008 Berlin Air Show Update |accessdate=13 June 2008 |publisher=ILA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604013341/http://www.ila-berlin.com/ila2008/presse/presse_volltext_e.cfm?id_nr=137 |archivedate=June 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other guests were the US Air Force with a B-1B Lancer, the Poland Air Force and the Slovak Air Force with MiG-29 Fulcrum, Airbus with the A380 and the Patrouille Suisse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jc-images.de/blog/aviation/46-berlin-eddb-30-05-2008-ila|title=ILA 2008 Berlin Air Show|accessdate=5 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140405151348/http://www.jc-images.de/blog/aviation/46-berlin-eddb-30-05-2008-ila|archivedate=5 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kurier Wileński''''' (literally: ''Vilnian Courier'') is the main [[Polish language|Polish-language]] [[newspaper]] in [[Lithuania]]. Printed in [[Vilnius]], it is the only Polish-language [[daily newspaper]] published east of Poland. A direct descendant of both the 19th-century newspaper of the same name and the ''Czerwony Sztandar'' newspaper, created by the Soviet authorities in 1953 as a means of [[Sovietization]] of the Polish diaspora left in the [[Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union]]. The newspaper is a member of the [[European Association of Daily Newspapers in Minority and Regional Languages (MIDAS)]]. According to TNS Gallup media research, ''Kurier Wileński'' 36,800 people or 1.4% of Lithuania's population read at least one issue out of the last six in summer 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gzi.lt/ci.admin/Editor/assets/Spaudos%20auditorija%20vasara%202008.pdf |title=Spaudos auditorija 2008 m. vasara |year=2008 |page=15 |publisher=TNS Gallup |language=lt |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206172338/http://gzi.lt/ci.admin/Editor/assets/Spaudos%20auditorija%20vasara%202008.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but that measure dropped to 0.3% in spring 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.media-house.com/media-house-naujienos/2010/9/3/artras-kokokinas-tns-skaiiai-kelia-nerim-dl-popierins-spaudo.html |title=Artūras Kokoškinas: TNS skaičiai kelia nerimą dėl popierinės spaudos ateities |date=2010-09-03 |publisher=Media House |language=lt |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125035859/http://www.media-house.com/media-house-naujienos/2010/9/3/artras-kokokinas-tns-skaiiai-kelia-nerim-dl-popierins-spaudo.html |archivedate=2010-11-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early history===
The newspaper was first founded under the name of ''Kurier Litewski'' in 1796 in Grodno (modern [[Hrodna]]). The following year it moved to Vilna (modern Vilnius, Lithuania), where it became one of the principal sources of information for the local population. After the [[November Uprising]] of 1831, the newspaper was ordered to prepare a [[Russian language]] version as well, and served the role of the official newspaper of the Russian authorities of [[Vilna Governorate]]. However, it also fulfilled an important role in countering the [[Russification]] of local Poles. 

In 1840 the newspaper was renamed to ''Kurier Wileński'' and attracted many notable Polish writers and journalists of the era as one of the very few relatively free newspapers in the lands ruled by the [[Russian Empire]]. Among them was [[Władysław Syrokomla]] and [[Antoni Odyniec]]. The newspaper was closed down and banned after the failed [[January Uprising]] of 1863. 

It was relaunched under the title of ''Kurier Litewski'' after the [[Revolution of 1905]]. Headed by [[Eliza Orzeszkowa]], it promoted Polish literature and culture, for which it was closed down several times by the Tsarist authorities. The title remained until the outbreak of [[World War I]] and the German occupation of Vilna in 1915. 

During the [[interbellum]] the Polish press was no longer persecuted by the local authorities and the title was continued as one of several newspapers, the most important local newspapers being ''[[Słowo]]'' (headed by [[Stanisław Cat Mackiewicz]]), ''Robotnik Wileński'' and ''Express Wileński''. Altogether, there were 114 newspapers published in Wilno in late 1930s, among them 17 dailies. 74 titles were being published in the [[Polish language]], 16 in [[Yiddish]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], 12 in Belarusian, 9 in Lithuanian and 3 in Russian. 

After the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|Invasion of Poland of 1939]] and the Soviet annexation of Vilna, ''Kurier Wileński'' was closed down (the last issue was dated September 18, 1939). The only newspaper that was allowed by the Soviet authorities was Belarusian-language ''Vilenskaya Prauda (Віленская праўда)''. After the city was transferred to [[Lithuania]], ''Kurier Wileński'' was allowed to be published, this time under heavy control of the Lithuanian authorities and [[censorship]]. It was again closed down after the city was annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] and its role was taken over by roughly 73 [[Polish_culture_during_World_War_II#Print|underground newspapers]] published in the city during the rest of [[World War II]].

===''Czerwony Sztandar''===
After the war most of the local inhabitants of Vilnius [[Polish population transfers (1944–1946)|were expelled from the city]]. However, a sizeable [[Polish minority in Lithuania]] remained. The Polish language newspaper ''Czerwony Sztandar'' (''Red Banner''), edited by Antoni Fiedorowicz, was established.&lt;ref name=kronika&gt;{{cite book |first=Jan |last=Sienkiewicz |title=Kronika na gorąco pisana: "Czerwony Sztandar" - ''Kurier Wileński'' 1953-2003 |publisher=Kurier Wileński |location=Wilno |year=2003  |isbn=9955-9628-1-X |page=258|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, [[Leonid Romanowicz]] became the new editor in chief. Although Russian himself, Romanowicz was fascinated by the Polish culture and started to attract many notable journalists and writers.{{dubious|date=January 2012}} He also promoted the newspaper and it became the only daily newspaper in Polish language available to many Poles in the Soviet Union. With time Russian staff was replaced by Poles and in 1984 [[Stanisław Jakutis]] became the new editor in chief.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===In independent Lithuania===
On November 1, 1988, Stanisław Jakutis was replaced by [[Zbigniew Balcewicz]], who wanted to rename the newspaper back to ''Kurier Wileński'' to reflect the historic traditions. The first attempt to rename the daily was dismissed at the 20th Assembly of the Bureau of the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of Lithuania]] as a "newspaper with such name was being published during the period between World Wars, when Vilnius region was under Polish occupation". Only after second attempt, made after publication by Lithuanian scientist about the roots of ''Kurier Wileński'' and the history of Lithuanian press, ''Czerwony Sztandar'' ceased to exist and was replaced by ''Kurier Wileński'' on February 9, 1990.

On February 23, 1990, the Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Lithuania and Chair of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR]] issued a statement, of which 3rd point stated, that "In order to reflect the opinions of representatives of various nationalities and social classes of the Republic, we state that ''[[Sovietskaya Litva]]'' and ''Kurier Wileński'' are the newspapers of the Supreme Soviet of Lithuania and the Council of Ministers of Lithuania".{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} On May 2, special issue of the newspaper was issued and ''Dziennik KC KP Litwy'' (''The daily of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Lithuania'') was removed from the paper's front page.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In 1995, the newspaper was privatised by its staff and in upcoming turmoil almost went bankrupt. It was taken over by UAB "Klion", and, after being reorganised and modernised, was moved to the new quarters. In 2000 it was passed to non-profit publisher Vilnijos Žodis.

==Structure==
The newspaper does not financially sustain itself and relies on support from the [[Polish Senate]]. According to press reports in 2007, the daily received approximately 120,000 [[Lithuanian litas|litas]] annually to cover paper and printing costs from the Polish Senate and 4,000 litas monthly from [[Vilnius city municipality]] for advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.delfi.lt/archive/article.php?id=12731505 |title= Lietuvius juodinantį straipsnį išspausdinęs "Kurier Wilenski" savo nuomonę ketina ginti teisme |first=Rasa |last=Lukaitytė |publisher=[[Delfi.lt]] |date=2007-04-02 |quote=„Kurier Wilenski” kasmet iš Lenkijos senato gauna 120 000 litų dotaciją, už kurią perka popierių bei dengia dalį spausdinimo išlaidų. 4 tūkst. litų „Kurier Wilenski” kas mėnesį skiria ir Vilniaus miesto savivaldybė, už tai leidinyje gaunanti keturis puslapius reklaminio ploto.|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the daily suffered large financial losses due to increased postage costs, shrinking readership, and overall economic downturn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/lithuania/kurier-wilenski-bus-leidziamas-tik-triskart-per-savaite.d?id=51104615 |title="Kurier Wilenski" bus leidžiamas tik triskart per savaitę |author=[[Baltic News Service]] |date=2011-10-26 |publisher=[[Delfi.lt]]|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt; It considered publishing only three issues a week, but [[Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] promised to find enough funding to keep the newspaper on a daily schedule. The Polish support during the first ten months amounted to 328,000 [[Polish zloty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/lithuania/laikrasti-kurier-wilenski-gelbes-lenkijos-urm.d?id=51183459 |title=Laikraštį "Kurier Wilenski" gelbės Lenkijos URM |date=2011-10-28 |publisher=[[Delfi.lt]]|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kurier Wileński'' has its own printing shop, which proved to be more cost effective. Its current circulation is between 2,500 and 3,500, issued Tuesday through Saturday. Daily issues have 16 pages, while Saturday issues have 24 pages and a TV supplement. ''Gazeta Harcerska'' (''Scout's gazette'') is a weekly page about [[Polish Scouting and Guiding Association|Polish scouts]] is written exclusively by the scouts.

The staff consists of 24 people, including printing-shop's workers and management. There are four full-time journalists, four half-time journalists and seven freelancers.

==Other activities==
During the [[Perestroika]] and the dissolution of the USSR, ''Czerwony Sztandar'' and later ''Kurier Wileński'' led numerous social campaigns. Among them were campaigns against demolition of the [[Rasos Cemetery]] and for creation of Polish kindergartens to prevent the growing [[Lithuanization]] of Polish children. 

''Kurier Wileński'' is also, along with ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]'', responsible for media coverage of the festival Kaziuki Wilniuki (inspired by [[Kaziuko mugė]] in Vilnius) held annually on March 3 to 6 in [[Lidzbark Warmiński]].&lt;ref name=kaziuki&gt;{{cite web |url=http://miasta.gazeta.pl/olsztyn/1,35186,2581345.html |title= Kaziuki Wilniuki w weekend |first=Norbert |last=Kaczan |date=2005-03-02|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 5, 2005, journalists of ''Kurier Wileński'', together with colleagues from newspapers ''[[Tygodnik Wileńszczyzny]]'' and ''[[Magazyn Wileński]]'', radio station [[Znad Wilii]], quarterly ''Znad Wilii'' and TV program ''[[Album Wileńskie]]'' organised a protest in front of the [[Belarus]]ian embassy in Vilnius against repressions of Polish journalists in Belarus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.delfi.lt/archive/article.php?id=7228826 |title= Baltarusijos ambasadai įteiktas spaudos laisvę Baltarusijoje ginantis kreipimasis |author=[[ELTA]] |date=2005-08-05 |publisher=[[Delfi.lt]]|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 17, 2008, the daily switched to the [[F4 (paper)|F4]] format&lt;ref name=format&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archiwumkw.lt/2008/10/KW_2008_10_17.pdf |title=Kurier Wileński w nowym formacie|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; (before that ''Kurier Wileński'' was published in the [[Tabloid (paper size)|tabloid]] format).

==Controversies==
Much of controversy surrounds the daily regarding its financial status and takeover by UAB "Klion". Also, there are conflicts with Lithuanian nationalists who regard Lithuanian Poles as merely [[Polonisation|polonised]] Lithuanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www3.lrs.lt/docs2/KMKLLMMH.PDF |journal=Varpas |volume=06 |issue=152 |year=2007 |first=Antanas R. |last=Šakalys |title=Kur tautiškumo ir valstybės tapatybės krizė |page=3 |format=PDF |issn=1648-0244|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Article by Krzysztof Buchowski===
In November 2006, ''Kurier Wileński'' published an article by [[Krzysztof Buchowski]], Polish historian from the [[Białystok University]], about Polish and Lithuanian relations between the world wars ({{lang-pl|Jak Polak widział Litwina w okresie międzywojennym}}). It was a reprint of a thesis presented during a Polish–Lithuanian historical conference ({{lang-pl|Stosunki polsko-litewskie na przestrzeni wieków}}) at [[Vilnius University]].

In January 2007 (before municipal elections, in which Polish party also participated), Lithuanian TV program ''Savaitės komentarai'' on the [[TV3 Lithuania|TV3 station]] sparked a scandal claiming that the article was insulting the Lithuanians. Information about the article was passed on to the Lithuanian Ethics Committee of Journalists and Publishers ({{lang-lt|Lietuvos žurnalistų ir leidėjų etikos komisija}}), which decided on March 19, 2007, that ''Kurier Wileński'' acted unethically publishing an article that was derogatory and insulting to the Lithuanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.delfi.lt/archive/article.php?id=12561787 |title="Kurier Willenski" už lietuvių juodinimą – žurnalistų etikos sargų kirtis |date=2007-03-19 |first=Mindaugas |last=Jackevičius |publisher=[[Delfi.lt]]|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The daily lost the appeal with the Committee and sued in the Lithuanian courts. The court rejected the appeal in April 2011. ''Kurier Wileński'' then submitted the case to the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/lithuania/kurier-wilenski-skundzia-lietuva-eztt.d?id=50779706 |title="Kurier Wilenski" skundžia Lietuvą EŽTT |date=2011-10-17 |publisher=[[Delfi.lt]]|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main characters==
===Ruth Wilder===
'''Ruth Wilder''' ([[Alison Brie]]) is an actress struggling to land a role on film and television. Originally from [[Omaha, Nebraska]], and having studied the works of [[August Strindberg]], Ruth relies heavily on [[method acting]]. One day, she is given an invitation for an audition which turns out to be for the fledgling women's wrestling promotion [[Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling]] (GLOW). Ruth initially has personality conflicts with director Sam Sylvia due to her tendency to overact in the ring. Aside from her acting style, Sam often questions her looks, unsure whether or not he finds her attractive. Making matters worse is her affair with Mark Eagan, the husband of her best friend Debbie. Because of this, she is known by the other women as a "[[homewrecker]]". After several weeks of struggling to come up with a character, she creates the in-ring persona of '''Zoya the Destroya''', a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] based on the real GLOW wrestler Colonel Ninotchka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/08/alison-brie-star-glow-netflix-wrestling-comedy-series-jenji-kohan-1201810007/|title=Alison Brie To Star In Netflix Comedy Series ‘G.L.O.W.’ From Jenji Kohan|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=August 29, 2016|accessdate=June 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Season 2, Ruth directs the show's opening sequence without Sam's approval, resulting in tensions between the both of them. She also develops a relationship with new cameraman Russell Barroso. While Ruth settles her differences with Sam, she falls victim to a drunk and cocaine-induced Debbie, who breaks her ankle during their match. The injury sidelines her for eight weeks, resulting in a heated argument between her and Debbie over past issues with each other. After the duo reconcile with each other, Ruth continues to provide story ideas for the show and also portrays a non wrestling character, '''Olga''', twin sister of her Zoya character in numerous skits. Sam rewards her by having her win the GLOW Crown in the show's final episode.

===Debbie Eagan===
'''Debbie Eagan''' ([[Betty Gilpin]]) is a former actress and Ruth's best friend. She is best known for her role as Laura Morgan in the [[soap opera]] ''Paradise Cove'' until she was fired due to her pregnancy. Her friendship with Ruth is severely strained when she discovers that Ruth had an affair with her husband Mark during and after her pregnancy, sparking a cat fight during practice that inspires Sam to cast Debbie as GLOW's leading lady. While trying to convince her to join GLOW, Sam theorizes that despite her popularity in ''Paradise Cove'', she was being held back by the show's writers and her character was put in a coma for a whole season as punishment for improvising too many lines before she was eventually replaced by another actress. Originally oblivious to the professional wrestling business, Debbie's mindset changes when she watches a local wrestling show and sees its similarities to soap opera before having a one-night-stand with male wrestler Steel Horse. She later on realizes that wrestling is a liberating experience, as her body is not constrained by Mark or her son Randy in the ring. Debbie's in-ring persona is '''Liberty Belle''', a patriotic [[Southern belle]] based on the real GLOW wrestlers Americana and The Southern Belles: Scarlet and Tara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/08/glow-betty-gilpin-cast-netflix-1980s-wrestling-comedy-series-jenji-kohan-1201810731/|title=‘G.L.O.W.’: Betty Gilpin To Co-Star In Netflix’s 1980s Wrestling Comedy Series|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=August 30, 2016|accessdate=June 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Season 2, Debbie divorces Mark after realizing he never took her acting career seriously. When the ladies are given new contracts by K-DTV, Debbie and Mark have her contract amended to make her a producer of the show. Her new position puts a strain on her already fragile friendship with Ruth, especially when she prevents Ruth from going out on a date with cameraman Russell Barroso by making her work overtime to finish editing the show's material. After Debbie discovers that Mark is seeing someone, she finds cocaine stashed in a pack of Sam's cigarettes and snorts it, causing her to become aggressive during the main event and break Ruth's ankle.

===Cherry Bang===
'''Cherry Bang''' ([[Sydelle Noel]]) is a former stuntwoman who becomes GLOW's head trainer. She previously worked in Sam's exploitation films in the 1970s and had a threesome with him and her husband. Prior to GLOW, Cherry had not worked with Sam since 1978 and she had been out of work since 1979, as the [[blaxploitation]] subgenre went on a decline toward the 1980s. She also suffered a miscarriage two years before joining GLOW. Cherry's in-ring persona is '''Junkchain''', a female rapper.&lt;ref name="Petski"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/09/britney-young-sydelle-noel-cast-netflix-comedy-series-g-l-o-w-jenji-kohan-1201812963/|title=Britney Young &amp; Sydelle Noel Join Netflix Comedy Series 'G.L.O.W.' From Jenji Kohan|last=Petski|first=Denise|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=September 17, 2016|accessdate=September 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Season 2, Cherry quits GLOW for a starring role in K-DTV's new female detective series ''Chambers and Gold'', but she struggles with remembering her lines in front of the camera. This results in director Rick Hollander cutting her lines and forcing her to change her hair. After analyzing footage of the pilot episode, Sam deduces that Cherry's background in stunt work never prepared her for acting, and he talks K-DTV producer Glen Klitnick to release her from the show so she can return to GLOW. After losing her Junkchain gimmick to Yolanda Rivas in her return match, Cherry reinvents herself as '''Black Magic''', a voodoo practitioner loosely based on the real GLOW wrestler Big Bad Mama.

===Carmen Wade===
'''Carmen Wade''' ([[Britney Young]]) is a 25-year-old woman who is part of a professional wrestling family. Her father, legendary wrestler Goliath Jackson, disapproves of her desire to become a wrestler, as he sees women's wrestling as a cheap sideshow. While she has wrestling skills and helps Cherry train the other ladies, Carmen suffers from [[stage fright]]. Carmen's in-ring persona is '''[[Machu Picchu]]''', a gentle [[Peruvians|Peruvian]] giant loosely based on the real GLOW wrestler [[Emily Dole|Mount Fiji]].&lt;ref name="Petski"/&gt;

===Sam Sylvia===
'''Sam Francis Sylvia''' ([[Marc Maron]]) is a [[Sicilian Americans|Sicilian American]] [[exploitation film]] director hired to direct GLOW. He had directed eight films in the 1970s and claims that two of them are taught in colleges. In addition, his film ''Gina the Machina'' was deemed so controversial that it was banned in 49 states. Sam has a chronic drug and alcohol addiction that has led to one divorce and multiple affairs with other women; his habits continue in GLOW when he has an affair with wrestler Rhonda Richardson. He often has conflicts with GLOW's producer Sebastian "Bash" Howard over the creative direction of the promotion, with Sam going for a dystopian sci-fi theme and Bash incorporating colorful stereotypes. Sam is loosely based on [[Matt Cimber]], the director of the original GLOW series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/08/marc-maron-to-star-netflix-comedy-series-g-l-o-w-jenji-kohan-1201811458/|title=Marc Maron To Co-Star In Netflix Comedy Series ‘G.L.O.W.’ From Jenji Kohan|last=Petski|first=Denise|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=August 31, 2016|accessdate=June 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Season 2, Sam goes paranoid over his role as director when he learns that Bash talked K-DTV out of replacing him with another director named Rick Hollander. This is exacerbated when he discovers that Ruth directed the show's main title sequence without his approval. After firing Reggie Walsh for defending Ruth, Sam punishes Ruth by keeping her off the next episode's taping. He subsequently settles his difference with Ruth, admitting to his insecurity.

===Justine Biagi===
'''Justine Victoria Biagi''' ([[Britt Baron]]) is a 17-year-old punk rock girl who uses the in-ring name '''Scab'''. On the first day of auditions, she claims to be 19 years old. She is a fan of Sam's exploitation films and has a romantic relationship with pizza boy Billy Offal. Later in the series, Justine reveals herself to be Sam's illegitimate daughter, as he had a one-night-stand with her mother Rosalie after being kicked out of a [[Black Panther Party]] rally in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] nearly two decades ago. Her sole purpose of joining GLOW was to meet him.&lt;ref name="Recur"/&gt;

In Season 2, Justine no longer participates in GLOW as a wrestler; instead, she plays small parts in the show as a teenage girl named Lisa. She also goes back to school at the insistence of Sam. One day, Rosalie spots her on an episode of the show and storms in Sam's house to bring her back to Sacramento. After being allowed to attend the school dance, Justine is talked out of moving out to New York with Billy and decides to go home with her mother.

Rhonda becomes romantically involved with Sam, but he becomes concerned when she makes their affair obvious in front of the other ladies.&lt;ref name="Recur"/&gt;

In Season 2, Rhonda adds a male store window mannequin named Thomas as part of her Britannica persona; in the GLOW storyline, Britannica is working on bringing Thomas to life using her knowledge of science. When GLOW faces cancellation due to its new time slot, Rhonda reveals that she has been working without a [[Social Security (United States)|social security number]], which poses a problem for her as the ladies prepare for job openings. Not wanting to return to her drunk and abusive parents in [[Bromley]], she takes Jenny's advice and visits the [[List of Consuls-General of the United Kingdom in Los Angeles|British Consulate]] to secure a [[Work permit|work visa]], but her request is denied and she is marked as an [[Alien (law)#United States|illegal alien]]. Carmen proposes for Rhonda to marry her fan Cupcake so she can secure a [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]]. The wedding is the focus of GLOW's final episode on K-DTV, but it falls through when Bash objects the marriage and confesses his love for Rhonda before marrying her.

===Sheila the She-Wolf===
'''Sheila the She-Wolf''' ([[Gayle Rankin]]) is an asocial woman who wears heavy black eye makeup and has a savage personality. She claims to have an acute sense of smell and hearing, hence being a light sleeper. She also says that she is [[Otherkin|spiritually a wolf]] and has been using her persona for at least five years. Sheila actually has blond hair underneath her thick black wig, but she refuses to break [[kayfabe]] even in everyday life. Aside from wrestling, Sheila is in charge of audio production. She can play the keyboard, but is limited to "[[Exodus (soundtrack)|Theme of Exodus]]".&lt;ref name="Recur"/&gt;

===Tammé Dawson===

She is initially concerned with her gimmick, as her son Ernest is studying at [[Stanford University]]. Prior to joining GLOW, Tammé worked as an extra in several TV shows such as ''[[Knots Landing]]'' and ''[[Gimme a Break!]]'' and as an audience coordinator for some game shows such as ''[[Family Feud]]''.&lt;ref name="Recur"/&gt;

In Season 2, Tammé pays Ernest a visit for parents' weekend. When Ernest hears that she is in GLOW, he goes with her to L.A. to attend the next taping, where she defends the GLOW crown against Debbie. Tammé loses to Debbie and is further humiliated when Debbie gives her an apron and a broom, causing her to walk out of the ring in disgust while the crowd boos Debbie. Later on she talks to Ernest, who admits he found the portrayal offensive but the sight of his mother wrestling amusing, and Tammé is able to make peace with her son watching GLOW.

===Melanie Rosen===
'''Melanie Danielle "Melrose" Rosen''' ([[Jackie Tohn]]) is a "party girl" and [[chauffeur]] who worked as an extra in several films and music videos. She initially is at odds with Cherry Bang, who sees through her as an attention-starved [[Stereotypes of Jews#Jewish-American princess|Jewish-American princess]] who has never had a real job. Melrose introduces herself as "Melanie Rose," even though her real last name is Rosen. Her in-ring personality is based on the real GLOW wrestler [[Jeanne Basone|Hollywood]].&lt;ref name="Recur"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/09/g-l-o-w-jenji-kohan-netflix-comedy-series-britt-baron-jackie-tohn-1201824469/|title=‘G.L.O.W.’: Jenji Kohan Netflix Comedy Series Adds Britt Baron, Jackie Tohn &amp; Five More|last=Petski|first=Denise|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=September 22, 2016|accessdate=September 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://jwa.org/blog/wrestling-with-womens-relationships-in-glow |title=Wrestling with Women's Relationships in GLOW |author=Lebow, Sara |publisher=Jewish Women's Archive |date=June 27, 2017 |accessdate=July 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recurring characters==
===Dawn and Stacey===
'''Dawn Rivecca''' ([[Rebekka Johnson]]) and '''Stacey Beswick''' ([[Kimmy Gatewood]]) are hairstylists who pull practical jokes on the other GLOW women. Their in-ring personas are '''Edna and Ethel Rosenblatt: The Beatdown Biddies''' - a geriatric tag team based on the real GLOW wrestlers The Housewives: Arlene and Phyllis. In GLOW's first show, Dawn are Stacey are put on a bind when they are scheduled to face Cherry and Tammé, as two black women beating up two elderly white women looks bad on all sides. As a compromise, The Beatdown Biddies wear [[Ku Klux Klan]] outfits (somewhat inspired by original GLOW characters The Hicks: Sara and Mabel) to completely put the match in favor of their opponents. Aside from wrestling, Dawn and Stacey are in charge of the wrestlers' hair and make-up.&lt;ref name="Recur"/&gt;

In Season 2, Dawn and Stacey evolve their characters into '''The Toxic Twins: Nuke and Ozone''', based on The Housewives' other persona The Heavy Metal Sisters: Chainsaw and Spike.

===Arthie Premkumar===
'''Arthie Premkumar''' ([[Sunita Mani]]) is an [[Indian Americans|Indian-American]] [[Pre-medical|pre-med student]] who takes the in-ring persona of '''Beirut the Mad Bomber''', a Middle Eastern terrorist based on the real GLOW wrestler Palestina. She is also the backstage medic for the wrestlers. During her match with Rhonda in GLOW's pilot episode, Arthie's gimmick is met with extreme hostility from some male fans, who spit at her and yell racist insults at her. One fan throws a beer can at her, but she blocks it and hits Rhonda in the head. While tending to Rhonda's head wound backstage, Arthie shows concern about the fan reaction to her gimmick.&lt;ref name="Recur"/&gt;

In Season 2, Arthie plans to kill off her Beirut gimmick and introduce a new persona, but her idea is stolen by Dawn and Stacey, causing a rift between them. Arthie also reveals that she failed med school, but she is more committed to GLOW than ever before. In addition, she slowly becomes attracted to newcomer Yolanda Rivas.

===Reggie Walsh===
'''Reggie Walsh''' ([[Marianna Palka]]) is an Olympic medalist. She is originally given the "Liberty Belle" gimmick in the persona test, but because of a lack of personality, the gimmick is given to Debbie instead, and Reggie becomes '''Vicky the Viking''' due to her tall, athletic stature and blond hair. Her in-ring persona is loosely based on the real GLOW wrestler Brunhilda.&lt;ref name="Recur"/&gt;

In Season 2, Reggie is fired by Sam after defending Ruth over her decision to direct GLOW's title sequence and the show's pilot episode. When GLOW is relegated to a 2:00 a.m. time slot, Reggie is rehired by Sam to help complete the season.

Bash also coordinates with K-DTV for broadcast rights and Patio Town for sponsorship. However, he is in a bind when his mother Birdie freezes his assets after having spent over $600,000 on GLOW. Bash is loosely based on GLOW creator [[David McLane]] and his dealings with financier/owner [[Meshulam Riklis]].&lt;ref name="Recur"/&gt;

In Season 2, Bash has the boxing gym converted into the official GLOW arena, but is once again strapped for cash due to Birdie funding him on a bi-monthly basis. Because of this, his butler Florian walks out on him due to a bounced check. When K-DTV relegates the show to a 2:00 a.m. time slot, Bash and Debbie go to a TV network convention and persuade several network producers to attend the final episode's taping in hopes for at least one of them to buy the show's rights. However, he is devastated upon hearing that Florian has died. While coping with his friend's death, Bash marries Rhonda on the show's final episode to help her secure a green card.

===Mark Eagan===

Eventually, Justine breaks up with him and decides to move back with her mother to Sacramento.

===Goliath Jackson===
'''Goliath Jackson''' (Winston James Francis) is a veteran wrestler and Carmen's father.

===Big Kurt Jackson and Mighty Tom Jackson===
'''Big Kurt Jackson''' ([[Carly Colón|Carlos Edwin]])&lt;!--This is Carlito's credited name in the series.

===Patrick O'Towne===
'''Patrick O'Towne''' ([[Andy Umberger]]) is the CEO of Patio Town, an indoor/outdoor lifestyle store chain.

In Season 2, Patio Town withdraws its sponsorship of GLOW after Tammé hits Debbie with a breakable chair that is implied to be one of the store's products. Furthermore, Patrick is said to have been offended by the show's [[Public service announcement|PSA]] on teenage pregnancy, as his mother was 15 when she gave birth to him.

The production proves disastrous due to Cherry's inexperience in acting, causing Hollander to try another narrative direction by cutting her lines and making her change her hair.

===Ray===
'''Ray''' ([[Horatio Sanz]]) is the owner of a strip club chain that Yolanda used to work for. He befriends Sam during a high school dance attended by Justine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8513">Television broadcasting in Greece began in 1966. Nevertheless, the first TV series was aired in 1970 and was the series ''[[To Spiti me ton Foinika]]'', aired by [[YENED]].&lt;ref name=tovima45years&gt;{{cite web|title=45 χρόνια ελληνική τηλεόραση: Τα σίριαλ της ζωής μας|url=http://www.tovima.gr/celebrities/article/?aid=662284|publisher=tovima.gr|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next series was ''[[O Kyrios Synigoros]]'' in the same year. The first years of television there were only [[Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation|public channels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100 στιγμές στην ιστορία της ελληνικής τηλεόρασης|url=http://www.tovima.gr/relatedarticles/article/?aid=116540|publisher=tovima.gr|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first channels were the channel EIR and the TED, the channel of armed forces. Few years later TED renamed to YENED and EIR became EIRT. The public channels renamed again after the coming of [[PASOK]] in the power and they became ERT1 and ERT2. Famous series of the period of public television are ''[[O Agnostos Polemos]]'', ''[[I Geitonia Mas]]'', ''[[To Louna Park (TV series)|Louna Park]]'', ''[[Christ Recrucified (TV series)|Christ Recrucified]]'', ''[[Methoriakos Stathmos]]'', ''[[oi Pantheoi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Το ασπρόμαυρο κουτί που μας πήγε στα αστέρια|url=http://www.thetoc.gr/media/article/to-aspromauro-kouti-pou-mas-pige-sta-asteria|publisher=thetoc.gr|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Greek television entered in a new period, the period of private television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1989, ιδιωτική τηλεόραση: Παράθυρα στον κόσμο|url=http://www.tovima.gr/society/article/?aid=248337|publisher=tovima.gr|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first private TV channels started to broadcast in 1989. After the creation of private channels the most series were played by them. The period 1995–2009 is the best period of the Greek television and frequently characterized as the golden age of the Greek TV. Then, many series were shot with expensive productions. After 2010, the [[Greek debt crisis]] affected the Greek television and the productions decreased dramatically. On the 28th of October 2018 the channel closed down at exactly 2:10 am. Viewers were tuned in to watch the channel's last transmission, which was an episode from the 90's hit series 'Oi Aparadehtoi'.

Comic book superheroes and professional wrestling characters have long been viewed in the same vein of entertainment as colorful characters that are larger than life, and numerous wrestlers have appeared or been referenced in comic books.

[[Spider-Man]]'s first costumed appearance was the result of Peter Parker's need for a colorful gimmick, as he planned to enter and win a wrestling challenge.

==Comics in wrestling==
*"Arachnaman" (portrayed by [[Brad Armstrong (wrestler)|Brad Armstrong]]) appeared in [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) in the early 1990s wearing a costume resembling that of [[Spider-Man]]'s aside from its yellow coloration instead of red. His gimmick included shooting 'webs' upon his ring entrance.
*[[Steve Borden|Sting]] changed from a colorful flamboyant performer to a dark brooding figure after being falsely accused of betrayal in the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] storyline in late 1996. As a result, he adopted a black and white look and brooded in the rafters of the arenas, mimicking ''[[The Crow]]'' by [[James O'Barr]] in appearance to the point of actual birds appearing as well. [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Scott Hall]] suggested the idea to Sting, knowing of the concept but not having seen or read any of the materials himself.
*[[Tiger Mask]] was originally a popular Japanese [[manga]] character; as a result, [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW) decided to capitalize on this by employing the young [[Satoru Sayama]] to play the character as an actual wrestler. The resultant success led to the character being reassigned, following Sayama's retirement, to other wrestlers, namely the now high-profile [[Mitsuharu Misawa]] and [[Koji Kanemoto]]. The current incarnation is the fourth, played by [[Tiger Mask IV|Yoshihiro Yamazaki]].
*[[Gangrel (Old World of Darkness)|Gangrel]] was a [[vampire]] character from the White Wolf brand of comics and role-playing games. [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE) employed a wrestler previously known as the [[Gangrel (wrestler)|Vampire Warrior]] (real name: David Heath) to play the character, as the leader of a cult-like faction called [[The Brood]], which also consisted of the wrestlers [[Adam Copeland|Edge]] and [[Jason Reso|Christian]].
*[[Gregory Helms]] wrestles as The Hurricane, a superhero gimmick with elements of [[Green Lantern|The Green Lantern]].

==Other connections==
*[[Rob Van Dam]] is an avid collector, who cites [[Ghost Rider]] as his favorite character, and operates his own store, ''RVD's Five Star Comics'', in California, and plans to write his own series.
*[[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]] wrote an issue of ''Spider-Man: Tangled Web'' for Marvel Comics. The issue featured a partial rewrite of Spider-Man's history, and focused on Crusher Hogan, the wrestler whom Spider-Man first tested his powers on.
*[[CM Punk]] has also been hired as a writer for Marvel Comics.

'''The Locations Managers Guild International (LMGI)''' is a professional organization of [[Location Manager]]s, [[Location scouting|Location Scouts]], Assistant Location Managers, and affiliated business members, such as film commissions, location services, vendors, and filming venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Location Managers Guild International|url=http://ingledoddmedia.com/client/lmga/|website=IngleDodd Media|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 2003 as the '''Location Managers Guild of America''', the membership voted to rename the organization as the Location Managers Guild International in 2016 to recognize the global aspect of film-making and reflect the growing international presence of its membership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://locationmanagers.org/presenting-location-managers-guild-international-lmgi-2/ "Presenting LMGI"] ''Location Managers Guild International'' Retrieved 2016-01-21&lt;/ref&gt;

The LMGI is not a [[trade union|labor union]] in that it does not represent Location Managers in wages or working conditions, leaving this responsibility to the respective local unions such as [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Teamsters Local 399]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ht399.org "Our Members"] ''Teamsters Local 399'' Retrieved 2016-01-21&lt;/ref&gt; Teamsters Local 390 in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], and the [[Directors Guild of America]] in [[New York City, New York|New York City]] and [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;Pope, Naomi Elizabeth [https://books.google.com/books?id=3uzlnRonEDgC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;lpg=PA223&amp;dq=dga+location+managers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UH3aFJTGJN&amp;sig=gphFi7ZNk8QEOGyL0HXnieUcbdc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwicjY2YpL7KAhURx2MKHSNLDmA4ChDoAQgiMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=dga%20location%20managers&amp;f=false "Unionization"] ''Beyond Hollywood'' Retrieved 2016-01-21&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has both union and non-union member professionals. 

==Membership==

While the majority of the membership of the LMGI are based in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] where the guild was first established, many members began traveling to secondary production centers such as [[Film industry in Georgia (U.S. state)|Atlanta]], [[Film industry in Louisiana|New Orleans]], and [[Hollywood North|Vancouver]] with the increasing dependence of [[Movie production incentives in the United States|production incentives]],&lt;ref&gt;Blair, Ian [https://variety.com/2012/film/features/10-location-managers-sound-off-1118055350/ "Location Managers Sound Off"] ''Variety'' Retrieved 2016-01-21&lt;/ref&gt; introduced their crews to the guild, and developed local location professional communities who in turn were invited to become members. 

Foreign membership followed the increasing recognition of international locations such as [[Cinema of Iceland|Iceland]], [[Cinema of Jordan|Jordan]], and [[Cinema of New Zealand|New Zealand]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmnz.com/news-features/new-zealand-voted-worlds-top-film-tourism-destination "New Zealand tops worlds film tourism destination"] ''Film New Zealand'' Retrieved 2016-01-21&lt;/ref&gt; through films such as [[Interstellar (film)|Interstellar]], [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Martian (film)|The Martian]], [[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]], and [[Zero Dark Thirty]]. The merger of the former LMGA partner organization in the United Kingdom, '''Guild of Location Managers''', into the '''Production Guild of Great Britain''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cooper|first1=Sarah|title=UK Guild of Location Managers to become part of Production Guild|url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/guild-of-location-managers-to-join-production-guild/5057932.article|accessdate=2016-10-22|publisher=Screen Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; also resulted in a number of British Location Managers seeking an organization that represented the craft exclusively.

Active Membership is limited to professional location scouts and managers.  Business Membership consists of affiliated businesses with professional references.

==Projects==

The LMGI regularly mounts large-scale, educational art projects in partnership with community groups.

'''Last Looks: The Ambassador Hotel'''

Over the weekend of 20 March 2005, just before demolition began on the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]], the LMGA organized an outreach event wherein Location Scouts could photograph the historic location one last time, while mentoring students from [[Jefferson High School (Los Angeles)|Jefferson High School]] (located in the [[Central-Alameda, Los Angeles|Central-Alameda neighborhood]] of Los Angeles) in the skills of script breakdown and location scouting.  The student photographs were judged by a jury that included respected Hollywood luminaries [[Shane Black]] (writer, [[Lethal Weapon]]), Alice West (co-executive producer, [[Ugly Betty]]), and Missy Stewart (production designer, [[Good Will Hunting]]).  The awards ceremony was held in June 2005 at the [[The Beverly Hilton|Beverly Hilton Hotel]].&lt;ref&gt;MacIntyre, April [http://www.btlnews.com/community/location-managers-guild-of-america-lmga-student-project/ "LMGA Student project"] ''Below The Line'' Retrieved 2016-01-21&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the LMGA produced a photographic exhibit of images from the Ambassador Project at the [[Los Angeles City Hall]], in the office of the City Attorney.  Student photographs were hung side by side with those of the pros to remarkable result.  The exhibit was featured on the front page of the Los Angeles Times calendar as an article accompanied by four full-color images.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Christopher [http://articles.latimes.com/2005/dec/16/entertainment/et-ambass16 "Remains of the Day"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Los Angeles, 16 December 2005. Retrieved on 13 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Concentric Circles: Metro L.A. Revealed'''

In 2008, the LMGA, in conjunction with the [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority]], produced a photo essay entitled "Concentric Circles: Metro L.A. Revealed," exhibited at Beady Minces Art Gallery in [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice]], California.&lt;ref&gt;Kit, Borys [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/double-shots-guild-metro-click-105875 "Double Shots: Guild Metro"] ''Hollywood Reporter'' Retrieved 2016-01-21&lt;/ref&gt;  Accompanied by Metro personnel, dozens of scouts rode bus and train lines across the city during the course of several weeks capturing unique images of Metro properties.

The resulting images provide a "scout's eye" view of various aspects of the Los Angeles Metro in the early 21st century. A book-bound catalog of film-friendly locations was created from this project as a marketing piece for the industry.

'''Lottery games with "lifetime" prizes''', known by names including ''[[Cash4Life]], [[Lucky for Life]],'' and ''Win for Life,'' comprise two types of United States [[lottery]] games in which the top prize is advertised as a lifetime [[Annuity (US financial products)|annuity]]; unlike annuities with a fixed period (such as 25 years), lifetime annuities often pay (sometimes for [[decade|decades]]) until the winner's death.

==Scratch games==
Most U.S. lotteries offer at least one [[scratchcard|scratch game]] with lifetime prizes.

These games vary; some lotteries offer multiple price points for "lifetime" games, with the top prize ranging from $50 daily to $1,000,000 yearly. Play for each game varies.

Increasingly, American lotteries have introduced a [[present value|cash option]] for winners of scratch games with such prizes (as they had begun in the 20th century with fixed annuities in almost all games, drawing or scratchcard.)  

==Draw games==
{{main2|Cash4Life|Lucky for Life}}

The "Win for Life" game (which replaced "[[Lotto South]]") began in 2006 in [[Georgia Lottery|Georgia]], [[Kentucky Lottery|Kentucky]], and [[Virginia Lottery|Virginia]]. Kentucky dropped out in 2011, and Georgia in 2014, leaving Virginia as its only member. "Win for Life" was retired following the September 13, 2014 drawing; it was replaced by $1,000,000 Moneyball.

Players chose six numbers from 1 through 42; seven numbers were drawn, including the "Free Ball". Top prize was $1000-per-week; there was a cash option of $1 million (offered when WFL became a Virginia-only game; when WFL began Virginia offered a $520,000 cash option, but the choice was eliminated the following year as neither Georgia nor Kentucky offered winners a cash option.) Second prize was $52,000 cash.

When Kentucky dropped WFL, Georgia, Kentucky, and Virginia began "[[Decades of Dollars]]", which later added [[Arkansas Lottery|Arkansas]]. On October 19, 2014, Decades of Dollars no longer was available in Arkansas, Georgia, or Kentucky; the three lotteries participated in the launch of "[[Monopoly Millionaires' Club]]", whose sales were suspended in December. Decades of Dollars held its final drawing on April 30, 2015; Virginia then joined the multi-state "[[Cash4Life]]".

In 2015, Kentucky joined Lucky for Life (which began in 2009 as a Connecticut-only game, "Lucky-4-Life") and Virginia joined the rival "Cash4Life". On August 28, 2016, Georgia joined [[Cash4Life]]; both games mentioned here have ''two'' lifetime prize tiers; winners of a "lifetime" prize can choose cash in lieu of annuity payments.

In [[game theory]] a '''move by nature''' is a ''decision'' or ''move'' in an [[extensive form game]] made by a player who has no strategic interests in the outcome.  The effect is to add a player, 'Nature', whose practical role is to act as a [[random number generator]].  For instance, if a game of [[Poker]] requires a [[Poker dealer|dealer]] to choose which cards a player is dealt, the dealer plays the role of the '''Nature player'''.

Fig. 1 shows a [[signaling game]] which begins with a move by nature.  Moves by nature are an integral part of games of [[incomplete information]].

'''''My Dinner with Andre''''' is a 1981 American [[comedy-drama]] film directed by [[Louis Malle]], and written by and starring [[Andre Gregory]] (Andre) and [[Wallace Shawn]] (Wally). The actors play fictionalized versions of themselves sharing a conversation at [[Café des Artistes]] in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.courant.com/1999-06-20/entertainment/9906200314_1_peter-sellers-dr-strangelove-two-great-films Johnson, Malcolm, "Cinestudio Salutes Columbia", ''Hartford Courant'' (June 20, 1999)]&lt;/ref&gt; The film's dialogue covers such things as [[experimental theatre]], the nature of theatre, and the nature of life, and contrasts Wally's modest [[humanism]] with Andre's spiritual experiences.

==Structure==
Andre Gregory is the focus of the first hour of the film, when he describes some of his experiences since giving up his career as a theatre director in 1975. These include working with his friend, director [[Jerzy Grotowski]], and a group of Polish actors in a forest in [[Poland]], his visit to [[Findhorn Ecovillage|Findhorn]] in Scotland, and his trip to the [[Sahara]] to try to create a play based on ''[[The Little Prince]]'' by [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry|St.-Exupéry]]. He worked with a group in a small piece of [[performance art]] on [[Long Island]], which resulted in Andre's being (briefly) [[Premature burial#Voluntary burial|buried alive]] on [[Halloween]] night.

The rest of the film is a conversation as Wally Shawn tries to argue that living life as Andre has done for the past five years is simply not possible for most people. He relates ordinary pleasures, like having a cup of coffee. Andre responds that what passes for normal life in New York in the late 1970s, is more akin to living in a dream than it is to real life. The movie ends without a clear resolution to the conflict in worldviews articulated by the two men. Wally reminisces during a taxi ride about his childhood and mentions that when he arrives at home, he tells his girlfriend Debbie about his dinner with Andre. [[Erik Satie]]'s ''[[Gymnopédies|Gymnopédie No. 1]]'' plays in the background.

==Cast==
*[[Andre Gregory]] as Andre
*[[Wallace Shawn]] as Wally
*Jean Lenauer as waiter
*Roy Butler&lt;!--- not the politician ---&gt; as bartender

==Production==
The idea for the film arose from Gregory's effort to work with a biographer on his life story, and Shawn's simultaneously coming up with an idea for a story about two people having a conversation.&lt;ref name="Criterion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AVClub"/&gt; Gregory and Shawn, who had become friends through theatre work, decided to collaborate on the project. They agreed that it should be filmed rather than produced as a play.&lt;ref name=Criterion/&gt; Although the film was based on events in the actors' lives, Shawn and Gregory denied (in an interview by film critic [[Roger Ebert]]) that they were playing themselves. They said that if they remade the film, they would swap the two characters to prove their point. In an interview with [[Noah Baumbach]] in 2009, Shawn said, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;I actually had a purpose as I was writing this: I wanted to destroy that guy that I played, to the extent that there was any of ''me'' there. I wanted to kill that side of myself by making the film, because that guy is totally motivated by fear.&lt;ref name="wally"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The screenplay went through numerous developmental changes in location; in the final version, it was set during a dinner at a restaurant. While Shawn was trying to find someone to direct the film, he received a phone call from French director [[Louis Malle]]. He had read a copy of the screenplay via a mutual friend and insisted that he work on the project, saying he wanted to direct, produce the film, or work on it in any capacity.&lt;ref name=Criterion/&gt;&lt;ref name=AVClub/&gt; Shawn initially thought that the call was a prank, due to Malle's stature in film. Malle later suggested that the dinner setup would not work, based on a rehearsal where Gregory was talking while eating.&lt;ref name=Criterion/&gt; Shawn argued throughout screenplay development for more scenes, which would have resulted in a three-hour film. Malle won many script cuts, but lost two arguments over scenes that were kept in the film.&lt;ref name=Criterion/&gt;

''My Dinner with Andre'' was filmed in the [[Jefferson Hotel (Richmond, Virginia)|Jefferson Hotel]], which was then vacant, in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. (The hotel has since been restored and reopened as a luxury venue.) [[Lloyd Kaufman]] was the production manager on the film, and [[Troma Entertainment]] provided production support.&lt;ref name="damn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fifty"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spin"/&gt; The filming was done over a period of two weeks, and edited to appear as if occurring in real time. The set was created to look like the iconic [[Café des Artistes]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1178-my-dinner-with-andre-long-strange-trips Taubin, Amy, "My Dinner with Andre: Long Strange Trips", ''The Criterion Collection'' (June 26, 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Roger Ebert]] and [[Gene Siskel]] gave high praise to the film on ''[[Sneak Previews]]''; the producers told Ebert that their praise helped keep the film in theaters for a year.&lt;ref name="barnes20130404"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/roger-ebert-dies-film-critic-406274 | title=Critic Roger Ebert Dies at 70 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | date=2013-04-04 | accessdate=April 4, 2013 | author=Barnes, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert later named it as the best film of the year. In 1999, he added it to his ''Great Movies'' essay series. He said, "Someone asked me the other day if I could name a movie that was entirely devoid of clichés. I thought for a moment, and then answered, ''My Dinner with Andre''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-my-dinner-with-andre-1981 "My Dinner with Andre."] ''Chicago Sun-Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Boston Society of Film Critics Awards]] ranked it as the "Best American Film" in 1982, and awarded Gregory and Shawn its prize for Best [[Screenplay]].

== Notes ==
Throughout the film, Andre references his wife "Chiquita"; in real life he was married to Mercedes "Chiquita" Nebelthau, who died in 1992.&lt;ref name=Chiquita&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/12/arts/mercedes-gregory-film-maker-dead-documentarian-56.html |title=Mercedes Gregory, Film Maker, Dead; Documentarian, 56 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 12, 1992 |accessdate=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nebelthau was a documentary filmmaker whose credits include three films about [[Jerzy Grotowski]], whom Wally and Andre talk about in this film.&lt;ref name=Chiquita/&gt;

Throughout the film, Wally references his "girlfriend Debbie". Though not actually identified, Debbie is the acclaimed short story writer [[Deborah Eisenberg]], although she had not begun publishing stories at the time of the film. Eisenberg is also an extra in the film, a dark-haired diner Shawn glances at as he scans the restaurant while standing at the bar waiting for Andre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1178-my-dinner-with-andre-long-strange-trips |title=My Dinner with André: Long, Strange Trips |first=Amy |last=Taubin |work=[[The Criterion Collection]] |date=2009 |accessdate=2018-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ovits family (dwarfs) 300x178.jpg|260px|thumb|right|The Ovitz siblings]]

The '''Ovitz family''' was a family of [[Romanian Jew]]ish actors/traveling musicians who survived imprisonment at the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] during [[World War II]]. Most of them were [[Dwarfism|dwarfs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Yehuda|last=Koren|first2=Eilat|last2=Negev|title=In Our Hearts We Were Giants: The Remarkable Story of the Lilliput Troupe|location=New York|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf|year=2004|isbn=0-7867-1555-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were the largest family of dwarfs ever recorded and were the largest family to enter Auschwitz and survive intact; the family of twelve ranged from a 15-month-old baby to a 58-year-old woman.&lt;ref name=USHMM/&gt;

==Origin==
The Ovitz family originated from [[Maramureş County]], [[Romania]]. They were descended from Shimson Eizik Ovitz (1868–1923), a ''[[badchen]]'' entertainer, itinerant [[rabbi]] and himself a dwarf.&lt;ref name=USHMM&gt;[http://resources.ushmm.org/inquery/uia_doc.php/photos/12452?hr=null The Ovitz Family on the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] website], resources.ushmm.org; accessed 15 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; He fathered ten children in total, seven of them dwarfs (afflicted with [[pseudoachondroplasia]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leroi|first=Armand Marie|title=Mutants: On the Form, Varieties and Errors of the Human Body|publisher=[[Harper Perennial]]|year=2003|pages=149–54|isbn=0-00-653164-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; from two marriages.

The children from his first marriage to Brana Fruchter (she was of average height), Rozika (1886–1984) and Franzika (1889–1980), were both dwarfs. Shimson's second wife, Batia Bertha Husz, also of average height, produced the following children: Avram (1903–1972; dwarf), Freida (1905–1975; dwarf), Sarah (1907–1993; average height), Micki (1909–1972; dwarf), Leah (1911-1987; average height), Elizabeth (1914–1992; dwarf), Arie (1917–1944; average height), and Piroska (a.k.a. "Perla"; 1921–2001; dwarf).

==Lilliput Troupe==
{{unsourced|section|date=January 2018}}
The children founded their own ensemble, the ''[[Lilliput and Blefuscu|Lilliput]] Troupe''. They sang and played music using small instruments and performed all over Romania, [[Hungary]] and [[First Republic of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]] in the 1930s and 1940s. The taller relatives helped backstage. The Ovitzes sang in [[Yiddish]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[German language|German]]. When they were not touring, they lived in a single house with their spouses.

At the start of [[World War II]], there were 12 family members, seven of them dwarfs. When Hungary seized [[Northern Transylvania]] in September 1940, the new racial laws banned Jewish artists from entertaining non-Jews. Though the Ovitzes were observant Jews, they obtained papers which omitted the fact that they were Jewish and continued going on their tours until 1944. On 12 May 1944,&lt;ref name=USHMM/&gt; all twelve family members were deported to Auschwitz. One average sized brother, Arie, escaped the round up but was later arrested and executed in 1944.

==Auschwitz==
{{unsourced|section|date=January 2018}}
Once in the camp, the Ovitzes attracted the attention of the [[Nazi Germany|German]] camp doctor [[Josef Mengele]] (known as the ''Angel of Death''), who collected curiosities for pseudoscientific experiments on [[heredity]]. He separated the Ovitzes from the rest of the camp inmates to add them to his collection of test subjects. He was curious about the fact that the family included both dwarfs and taller members. Eleven other prisoners claimed to be their relatives, and Mengele moved all of them accordingly.

Wanting to spare the group of dwarfs (because they were harder to find than other kinds of test subjects, such as [[twin]]s), Mengele arranged to have special living quarters built for them, so they could be monitored. To keep them healthy for his [[Nazi human experimentation|human experimentation]], he arranged for them to have more hygienic living conditions, better food and their own bedclothes. Mengele allowed them to keep their own clothes, and forced the taller members of the group to carry the dwarfs to the experimentation sites.

The Ovitzes—like many other camp inmates—were subjected to various tests. Mengele's physicians extracted [[bone marrow]] and pulled out teeth and hair to find signs of [[hereditary disease]]. They poured hot and cold water in their ears and blinded them with chemical drops. [[Gynecologist]]s inspected the married women.  

Eighteen-month-old Shimshon Ovitz was put through the worst ordeals because he had taller parents and was prematurely born; Mengele drew blood from the veins behind his ears and from his fingers on a daily basis often causing weakness. The Ovitzes also witnessed two newcomer dwarfs being killed and boiled so their bones could be exhibited in a museum. Mengele also filmed them; this film was not found after the war, and it is possible that he kept it when he fled.

They expected to be killed after Mengele had finished his experiments, but they lived to see the liberation of Auschwitz on 27 January 1945. The [[Red Army]] took them to the [[Soviet Union]] where they lived in a [[refugee camp]] for some time before they were released.

==Aftermath==
{{unsourced|section|date=January 2018}}
The Ovitzes traveled on foot for seven months to their home village. They found their home looted, moved first to the town of [[Sighet]] and later to [[Belgium]]. In May 1949, they immigrated to [[Israel]], settled in [[Haifa]], and began their tours again, being quite successful and packing large concert halls. In 1955, they retired and bought a [[Movie theater|cinema]] hall.

Descendants of the dwarf men of the family were born taller; the women did not become pregnant due to their small pelvises. The firstborn of the dwarfs, Rozika Ovitz, died in 1984 at the age of 98. The last adult dwarf survivor of the family, Perla Ovitz, died in 2001.

==Media==
{{unsourced|section|date=January 2018}}
In March 2013, [[Warwick Davis]] presented an episode of the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] series ''Perspectives'', entitled "Warwick Davis - The Seven Dwarfs of Auschwitz". He explored the historical story of the Ovitz family, including an interview with Perla Ovitz recorded in 1999 recounting how they survived the Nazi concentration camp of Auschwitz and Mengele's experiments. The interview from the film comes from a documentary, ''Liebe Perla'' (German for ''Dear Perla'').

'''Ozploitation''' films are [[exploitation film]]s – a category of [[low-budget film|low-budget]] [[horror film|horror]], [[comedy film|comedy]], and [[action film]]s – made in [[Australia]] after the introduction of the [[Motion picture rating system#Australia|R rating]] in 1971.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The year also marked the beginnings of the [[Australian New Wave]] movement, and the Ozploitation style peaked within the same time frame (early [[Australian films of the 1970s|1970s]] to late [[Australian films of the 1980s|1980s]]). Ozploitation is often considered a smaller wave within the New Wave, "a time when break-neck-action, [[:wikt:schlock|schlock]]-horror, [[ocker]] comedy and frisky sex romps joined a uniquely antipodean wave in exploitation cinema".{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Background==
The origin of the term "Ozploitation" is credited to the documentary ''[[Not Quite Hollywood: The Wild, Untold Story of Ozploitation!]]''. This 2008 feature explores Ozploitation films made during the Australian New Wave. The film includes interviews with numerous figures involved in Ozploitation, as well as fans of the genre, including American director [[Quentin Tarantino]], who coined the phrase "Aussiesploitation", which director [[Mark Hartley]] then shortened to "Ozploitation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bazuraproject.com/2008/10/30/304-interview/|title=The Bazura Project 3.04 – Interview : The Bazura Project|website=www.bazuraproject.com|access-date=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian horror film production trebled from less than 20 films in the 1990s to over 60 films between 2000 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/entertainment/film/horror-brings-film-industryback/2008/10/13/1223749911909.html-AAP "Horror brings film industry back from the grave"] (13 October 2008), ''[[The Age]]''. Retrieved 25 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one researcher, "global forces and emerging production and distribution models are challenging the 'narrowness' of cultural policy – a narrowness that mandates a particular film culture, circumscribes certain notions of value and limits the variety of films produced domestically. Despite their low-culture status, horror films have been well suited to the Australian film industry's financial limitations, they are a growth strategy for producers, and a training ground for emerging filmmakers".&lt;ref&gt;Ryan , Mark David (2009) [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/29127/1/c29127.pdf 'Whither culture? Australian horror films and the limitations of cultural policy']. Media International Australia incorporating Culture and Policy(No 133). pp. 43-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''party political broadcast''' (also known, in pre-election campaigning periods, as a '''party election broadcast''') is a television or radio [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] made by a political party.

In the United Kingdom the [[Communications Act 2003]] prohibits [[political advertising]] on television or radio; parties are instead allocated broadcast slots (usually around five minutes long) free of charge on broadcast channels using a formula set by Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cap.org.uk/Advertising-Codes/Broadcast/CodeItem.aspx?cscid={85344a94-8673-4fbf-9890-195a4ac1a093}#.WCOa9XV970o|title=07 Political and controversial matters|work= [[BCAP code]]|publisher=[[Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice]] (BCAP)|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cap.org.uk/Advertising-Codes/Broadcast/CodeItem.aspx?cscid={9bbcc79f-2faa-4e64-b14b-39c1b3cd263b}#.WCOaiXV970o|title=10 Prohibited categories|work= BCAP code|publisher=Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice (BCAP)|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar format exists in the [[Republic of Ireland]], though for smaller parties, because a greater number of them are represented in the [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]], their allocated time may be as little as one or two minutes each.

In [[Canada]], the [[Canada Elections Act]] includes provisions for free-time election broadcasts (in addition to paid advertising) during Canadian federal elections, on all licensed terrestrial television and radio networks; notably, however, none of Canada's main English-language private television networks ([[CTV Television Network|CTV]], [[Global Television Network|Global]] and [[City (TV network)|City]]) actually operates under a network license anymore, meaning that in actual practice in the 2010s this provision applies only to [[CBC Television]] and the French-language networks in [[Quebec]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=abo&amp;dir=bra/fre&amp;document=index&amp;lang=e "Allocation of Free Broadcasting Time"]. [[Elections Canada]].&lt;/ref&gt; CBC Television formerly broadcast the regular weekly series ''[[The Nation's Business]]'', in which Members of Parliament from all parties could give a short speech on a political issue, but this series no longer airs. 

In Asia, party political broadcasts have existed in [[Singapore]] since 1980, where they are known as ''political party broadcasts''. In Japan, party political broadcasts are known as {{nihongo|政見放送|''seiken hōsō''}}. In Brazil, party political broadcasts are known as ''Horário político''. In Chile, party political broadcasts are known as ''Franja Electoral''.

In [[economics]], '''perfect information''' is a feature of [[perfect competition]]. With perfect information in a market, all consumers and producers have perfect and instantaneous knowledge of all market prices, their own utility, and own cost functions.

In [[game theory]], a [[sequential game]] has '''perfect information''' if each player, when making any decision, is perfectly informed of all the events that have previously occurred, including the "initialization event" of the game (e.g. the starting hands of each player in a card game).&lt;ref name="OsbRub94-Chap6"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Course in Game Theory|last2=Rubinstein|first2=A.|publisher=The MIT Press|year=1994|isbn=0-262-65040-1|location=Cambridge M.A.|chapter=Chapter 6: Extensive Games with Perfect Information|last1=Osborne|first1=M.

&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic literature has not produced consensus on a standard definition of perfect information which defines whether games with chance, ''but no secret information'', and games with [[Simultaneous game|''simultaneous moves'']] are games of perfect information.&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;[https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/1998-99/game-theory/psr.html https://cs.stanford.edu] Game Theory: Rock, Paper, Scissors (Chen, Su-I Lu, Vekhter).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ucla"&gt;[https://www.math.ucla.edu/~tom/Game_Theory/mat.pdf https://www.math.ucla.edu] Game Theory (Ferguson).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aaai"&gt;[https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8407/8476 https://www.aaai.org] Solving Imperfect Information Games Using Decomposition (Burch, Johanson, Bowling).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SE"&gt;[https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/845380/complete-vs-perfect-infomation-in-combinatorial-game-theory https://math.stackexchange.com] Complete vs Perfect information in Combinatorial game theory.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mycielski"&gt;[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6b10/22cb68df1918513948830734be796e052fe2.pdf https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org] Games with Perfect Information (Mycielski).&lt;/ref&gt;

Games which are [[Sequential game|sequential]] (players alternate in moving) and which have chance events (with known probabilities to all players) but ''no secret information'', are sometimes considered games of perfect information. This includes games such as [[backgammon]] and [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]. But there are some academic papers which do not regard such games as games of perfect information because the results of chance themselves are unknown prior to them occurring.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ucla"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aaai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mycielski"/&gt;

Games with ''simultaneous moves'' are generally not considered games of perfect information. This is because each of the players holds information which is secret, and must play a move without knowing the opponent's secret information. Nevertheless, some such games are [[Symmetric game|symmetrical]], and fair. An example of a game in this category includes [[rock–paper–scissors]].&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ucla"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aaai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mycielski"/&gt;

[[File:Poi Sang Long Festiva03.JPG|thumb|350px|Poy Sang Long in [[Mae Hong Son]], northern Thailand]]

'''Poy Sang Long''' ([[Shan language|Shan]]: {{my|ပွႆးသၢင်ႇလွင်း}}; lit. "Festival [of the] Crystal Sons") is a [[rite of passage]] ceremony among the [[Shan people]]s, in [[Myanmar]] and in neighbouring northern [[Thailand]], undergone by boys at some point between seven and fourteen years of age. It consists of taking novice monastic vows and participating in monastery life for a period of time that can vary from a week to many months or more. Usually, a large group of boys are ordained as [[Śrāmaṇera|sāmaṇera]] (novitiate monk) at the same time.

In neighbouring Thailand, where Shan immigrants have brought over the traditions from Myanmar, the ceremony goes on for three days, as the boys (dressed like princes in imitation of [[Gautama Buddha]], who was himself a prince before setting out on the religious path) spend the entire time being carried around on the shoulders of their older male relatives. On the third day, they are ordained, and enter the [[vihara|monastery]] for a period of at least one week, and perhaps many years.

'''''Presto''''' is a 2008 American [[Pixar]] [[Computer animation|computer animated]] [[Short subject|short film]] shown in theaters before their feature-length film ''[[WALL-E]]''. The short is about a magician trying to perform a show with his uncooperative rabbit and is a gag-filled homage to classic cartoons such as ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' and ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', as well as the work of [[Tex Avery]]. ''Presto'' was directed by veteran Pixar animator [[Doug Sweetland]], in his directorial debut.

The original idea for the short was a magician who incorporated a rabbit into his act who suffered  from [[stage fright]]. This was considered to be too long and complicated, and the idea was reworked. To design the theater featured in ''Presto'', the filmmakers visited several opera houses and theaters for set design ideas. Problems arose when trying to animate the theater's audience of 2,500 patrons; this was deemed too expensive, and was solved by showing the back of the audience.

Reaction to the short was positive, and reviewers of WALL-E's movie home media release considered it to be an enjoyable special feature. There is also a book. ''Presto'' was nominated for an [[Annie Award]] and [[Academy Award]]. It was included in the [[Animation show of shows|Animation Show of Shows]] in 2008.

==Plot==
[[Vaudeville]] era magician Presto DiGiotagione{{ref label|name1|a|}} is famous for a [[hat-trick (magic trick)|hat trick]] wherein he pulls his [[rabbit]] Alec Azam{{ref label|name2|b|}} out of his [[top hat]]. A hungry and irritated Alec is locked in a cage, unable to reach his [[carrot]].&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt; After Presto returns from eating a meal, he begins practicing his act with Alec, revealing that his top hat is magically connected to a wizard's hat kept backstage with Alec. Anything that passes into either hat will emerge from the other.

Intending to feed Alec, Presto realizes that his show is starting and rushes onstage instead. Alec refuses to cooperate with the act and turns the hats against Presto in a variety of ways that lead to escalating degrees of humiliation, such as letting him catch his finger in a mousetrap, hit himself in the eye with a raw egg, and get his head sucked into a ventilation shaft. Presto continues to antagonize Alec at the same time, first turning the carrot into a flower and later smashing it to pulp with a club. 

Fed up with Alec's behavior, Presto storms backstage after him, but accidentally releases a set of hanging stage props and gets his foot caught in a rigging rope. He is yanked up into the [[fly system|fly space]] above the stage; when his foot comes loose, he falls again and finds himself in danger of being crushed by both the props and a falling piano. Alec uses the hats' magic to save him, earning the audience's wild approval for him and Presto, who gratefully gives him a fresh carrot and starts to give him second billing on the posters advertising the act.

==Production==

The table has various jars on it, and posters for the magic show can be seen on the wall in the background.|In the opening shot, Alec is shown desperately stretching for an out of reach carrot. In order to get to the conflict quickly, viewers are shown what the rabbit wants almost immediately.&lt;ref name=AWN&gt;{{cite news|last=Desowitz|first=Bill|title=Presto Change-O for Pixar|url=http://www.awn.com/animationworld/presto-change-o-pixar|accessdate=April 21, 2012|newspaper=Animation World Network|date=May 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Doug Sweetland]] made his directorial debut with ''Presto''. Sweetland provides the dialogue-free voice acting for both of the movie's characters.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://disney.go.com/vault/supplement.pdf |title=Supplement to Dave Smith's 2006 book ''Disney A to Z: The Official Encyclopedia'' |accessdate=December 22, 2008 |publisher=[[Disney.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pitched the film at the start of 2007 and began production late in the year, completing it in May 2008.&lt;ref name="Douglas"/&gt; ''Presto''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; gag based format was heavily influenced by classic cartoons. ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoons directed by [[Tex Avery]] were a major influence, with Alec being easily compared to [[Bugs Bunny]]. Other influences include ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'', the [[Marx Brothers]], and [[Charlie Chaplin]]. The character design for Presto was based on [[William Powell]].&lt;ref name="Douglas"&gt;{{cite web|author=Douglas, Edward|title=Presto Director Doug Sweetland|publisher=ComingSoon.net|date=February 6, 2009|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=52513|accessdate=February 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Suite"&gt;{{cite web|date=September 25, 2008 |url=http://hollywood-animated-films.suite101.com/article.cfm/interview_doug_sweetland_on_presto |title=Interview: Doug Sweetland on Presto |author=Von Riedemann, Dominic |publisher=Suite101.com |accessdate=December 6, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113173609/http://hollywood-animated-films.suite101.com/article.cfm/interview_doug_sweetland_on_presto |archivedate=January 13, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original scenario for the short involved a magician who incorporates an autograph seeking rabbit into his act after his previous rabbit leaves him. Complications arise as the new rabbit suffers from stage fright. Sweetland compared it to the plot of ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star Is Born]]''. The idea was reworked due to being too long and complicated, taking an estimated three minutes longer to tell.&lt;ref name="Suite" /&gt;

To achieve the highly formal environment, the filmmakers looked at the [[Royal Opera House]] in London, the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Opera House]] and classic [[vaudeville]] theaters like the Geary in [[San Francisco]]—which the crew took a tour through—for set design ideas. Animating the theater's audience of 2,500 patrons proved an expensive proposition, even with the help of the crowd-generating ''[[MASSIVE (software)|MASSIVE]]'' software. 

Early suggestions were to show cutaways of just a small portion of the audience, but the full effect was achieved by only showing the back of the audience.&lt;ref name=AWN /&gt; To save time, most of the audience models were borrowed from the previous Pixar film, [[Ratatouille (film)|''Ratatouille'']]. Additionally, Presto's body (from the neck down) is [[Ratatouille (film)#Main characters|Skinner]]'s lawyer, and the carrot was one of the many food props from that film.

==Reception==
Reaction to the short film was positive. Carl Cortez of ''[[If (magazine)|If]]'' called ''Presto'' a "winner through and through".&lt;ref name="carlreview"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ifmagazine.com/review.asp?article=2932 |title=DVD Review: ''Wall-E'' - 3-Disc Special Edition |accessdate=December 22, 2008 |author=Cortez, Carl |date=November 28, 2008 |publisher=''[[If (magazine)|If]]'' | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210134355/http://ifmagazine.com/review.asp?article=2932 | archivedate=February 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jake Coyle of the ''[[Associated Press]]'' found ''Presto'' to be "a delightful and cartoonish appetizer" which kept the tradition of short pre feature films alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Coyle|first=Jake|title=Pixar whips up magic with 5-minute ‘Presto’|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/25378152/ns/today-entertainment/t/pixar-whips-magic--minute-presto/|accessdate=April 21, 2012|newspaper=msnbc.com|date=June 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darren Bevan of [[Television New Zealand]] thought that although ''WALL-E'' was a "delightful tale" and "truly gorgeous", ''Presto'' "very nearly stole ''Wall-E's'' thunder".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/2342571/425828/article.html |title=2008 cinema review: July to September |accessdate=January 2, 2009 |author=Bevan, Darren |date=December 31, 2008 |publisher=[[Television New Zealand]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Sanford of the ''[[Kalamazoo Gazette]]'' called the short a superb and hilarious curtain raiser, describing it as a Bugs Bunny ''Looney Tunes'' version of ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mlive.com/movies/index.ssf/2008/06/pixars_walle_has_humor_suspens.html |title=Pixar's ''WALL-E'' has humor, suspense, romance&amp;nbsp;- and show tunes? |accessdate=January 2, 2009 |author=Sanford, James |date=June 26, 2008 |publisher=[[Booth Newspapers]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928204033/http://www.mlive.com/movies/index.ssf/2008/06/pixars_walle_has_humor_suspens.html |archivedate=September 28, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Presto'' was nominated for the [[36th Annie Awards|36th]] [[Annie Award]] for Best Animated Short Subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/env-annie-awards-1dec2008,0,3047769.htmlstory |title=''Kung Fu Panda'', ''Bolt'' and ''Wall-E'' lead Annie Award nominees |accessdate=December 22, 2008 |author=King, Susan |date=December 1, 2008 |publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204084017/http://theenvelope.latimes.com/env-annie-awards-1dec2008%2C0%2C3047769.htmlstory |archivedate=December  4, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The short was also nominated for the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]], but lost to ''[[La Maison en Petits Cubes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nominees &amp; Winners for the 81st Academy Awards|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/81academyawards/nominees.html|publisher=The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=April 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1854">In [[broadcasting]], '''program test authority''' ('''PTA''') is an authorization to conduct [[Broadcasting|on-air]] testing of [[Radio station|broadcast station]] facilities authorized to be built under a [[construction permit]].  Once this testing is successfully completed, and all measured [[parameter]]s match what was authorized in the permit, the permittee can apply to the [[broadcasting authority]] for a [[broadcast license]] to cover the permit.  PTA lasts until the license is issued (or, rarely, denied).

"Program" refers to the permission to broadcast regular [[radio program]]ming or [[TV program]]ming, instead of just a test transmission such as a [[test card]] or [[bars and tone]] (TV only), [[broadcast callsign]] or other required [[station identification]], or [[dead air]] (which may not be permissible).  Otherwise, only brief tests are allowed without PTA, in order to verify proper installation and functioning of all transmission equipment, such as the [[transmitter (radio)|transmitter]] components (exciter and [[amplifier]]), [[feedline]], [[antenna (radio)|antenna]], and any [[diplexer]]s that may be used.

In the [[United States]], the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) gives most stations automatic program test authority if they are using an [[omnidirectional antenna]].  For stations with a [[directional antenna]], PTA is only for half of regular [[effective radiated power|power]], and is not granted until the permittee's [[broadcast engineer]] certifies that the antenna is installed properly so that the station's [[radiation pattern]] is correct.  Stations must apply for a license within 30 days of starting broadcasts under program test authority.  Upon issuance of the license, directional stations then commence full-power operation.

[[File:The first miles of the Tweed - geograph.org.uk - 831574.jpg|thumbnail|The first miles of the Tweed further upriver than the burn that carries the name Tweed, this is a confluence of the Powskein and Whitehope Burns. The Whitehope Burn is probably the branch of the system furthest from Berwick. The hill is Chalk Rig and it carries the Dumfriesshire/Peeblesshire march and the East-West watershed of Scotland.]]
The '''Scottish watershed''' is the [[drainage divide]] in [[Scotland]] that separates river systems that flow to the east into the North Sea from those that flow to the west and north into the Atlantic Ocean. At a point on the summit of [[Ben Lomond]] for example, looking west all water flows to the [[Firth of Clyde]], and looking east all water flows into the [[Firth of Forth]]. 
Similarly [[Cumbernauld]] is a point on this line and arguably its Gaelic name has, for hundreds of years, reflected this fact. There is some dispute however about interpretation of the Gaelic phrase. The line joining all such points in Scotland is the Scottish watershed.
[[File:Shed1.jpg|thumb|Dave Hewitt en route back to the watershed route after a rest day in Shiel Bridge in 1987.]]
Although the concept of geographical watersheds is common, the first unequivocal reference to the Scottish watershed is to be found in Groome's Ordnance Gazetteer of 1884, in which the entry defines the northern terminus as being at [[Duncansby Head]]. This was followed in 1912 with the Bartholomew Atlas Survey (NLS) which shows the entire geographic feature, from the border with England to Duncansby Head. The first popular delineation of the Scottish watershed took place as recently as 1986.  It was mapped out in that year by [[Dave Hewitt]], who in 1987 then walked the line of the watershed from south to north.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Dave (1988) ''Walking the Watershed' 'Glasgow: TACit Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Scottish Geographical Society (RSGS) reviewed Wright`s `Ribbon of Wildness` in 2011, and in acknowledging the significance of the route, stated that "Ribbon of Wildness gives a vivid introduction to this hitherto largely unknown geographic feature". Eight people have now done versions of this route:

*Hewitt walked from the [[Anglo-Scottish border]] to [[Cape Wrath]] in a single push, April–June 1987
*the late Mike Allen walked from [[Land's End]] to Cape Wrath in numerous mainly short sections, April 1988–October 1994
*Martin Prouse walked from [[Rowardennan]] to [[Ben Hope]] in one go, July–August 1994
*[http://Peter%20Wright Peter Wright] walked from the Anglo-Scottish border to [[Duncansby Head]] in eight sections, Jan–Oct 2005 &lt;ref&gt;Wright, Peter. (2010) ''Ribbon of Wildness – Discovering the Watershed of Scotland''. Luath Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Malcolm Wylie completed a 131-day traverse of the UK, in 14 sections - Scottish sections 1996 and 2,000 - Peel Fell to Duncansby Head.
*Colin Meek completed watershed run in 27 days in summer 2012 - Peel Fell to Duncansby Head.
*[[Chris Townsend (writer)|Chris Townsend]] completed a traverse from Peel Fell to Duncansby Head in 2013, 28 May – 22 July
*Elspeth Luke ran the entire Watershed in a continuous 34-day epic from 13 July to 15 August 2015. She is the first woman to complete this journey.

The first of the leaks were distributed on May 30 at around 8pm where five songs from the track list were available on the internet. Hours later on May 31 at 12am-1am the whole album was leaked and posted on various websites for free download. The DJ responsible for the leaks was DJ Chuck T who retaliated for an interview conducted by Wayne, where he discredited all DJs and the mixtape scene days before.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Lil Wayne later called [[DJ Drama]]'s radio show Shade 45 Sirius Satellite Radio to explain that his comments were meant specifically for DJ Empire who leaked his materials periodically without his permission, consent, or knowledge; he also apologized for any misunderstandings between him and the numerous DJs that have aided him in the mixtape industry. He made it clear, however, that he wished for any feelings of dislike or resentment to remain.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Hale (May 31, 2008).

''Tha Carter III'' received universal acclaim from [[music criticism|music critic]]s.

Originally a proposed remake of ''The Mummy'' would have been directed by horror filmmaker/writer [[Clive Barker]]. Barker’s vision for the film was violent, with the story revolving around the head of a contemporary art museum who turns out to be a cultist trying to reanimate mummies.&lt;ref name=Slotek&gt;{{cite news | last = Slotek | first = Jim | title = Unwrapping ''The Mummy''| publisher = [[Toronto Sun]] | date = May 2, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cinescape&gt;The Mummy That Wasn't", Cinescape (May 3, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Barker's take was "dark, sexual and filled with mysticism",&lt;ref name=Hobson&gt;Hobson, Louis B (May 1, 1999). "Universal rolls out new, improved Mummy", Calgary Sun.&lt;/ref&gt; and that, "it would have been a great low-budget movie".&lt;ref name=Slotek/&gt;

In 1999, [[Stephen Sommers]] wrote and directed a remake of ''The Mummy'', loosely based on the original film of 1932.  This film switches genres from the emphasis on horror to adventure, concentrating more on action sequences, special effects, comedy, and a higher element of Egyptian lore. The film became a box office success spawning two sequels, several video games, a [[The Scorpion King|spin-off series]], and an animated television series. The first two films received mixed reviews, while the third one received mostly negative reviews.

Two video game adaptations of ''The Mummy'' (1999) were developed by [[Rebellion Developments]] and published by [[Konami]] in 2000: an [[action-adventure game]] for the [[PlayStation]] and [[Personal computer|PC]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psx.ign.com/objects/014/014640.html|title=The Mummy (PSX)|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a [[Game Boy Color]] [[puzzle game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gbc/action/mummy/index.html|title=The Mummy (GBC)|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dreamcast]] version was announced but later cancelled in the late 2000. ''The Mummy Returns'' released in late 2001 for the [[PlayStation 2]] and developed by [[Blitz Games]], the [[Game Boy Color]] version was developed by GameBrains, both versions were published by [[Universal Interactive]]. ''[[The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (video game)|The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor]]'' was released in 2008, developed by [[Eurocom]] for the [[PlayStation 2]] and the [[Wii]], the [[Nintendo DS]] released was developed by [[Artificial Mind and Movement|A2M]], all versions were published by [[Sierra Entertainment]]. In March 2012, a massive multiplayer online game known as ''The Mummy Online'' was released.

In May 2001, [[Chaos! Comics]] released the first of a three-issue series inspired by the film, titled ''The Mummy: Valley of the Gods''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comiccollectorlive.com/LiveData/CoverTitle_List.aspx?id=c8d5397b-9fe6-4997-9966-9d903720bdcc|title=The Mummy Valley of the Gods (Issue List)|publisher=Comic Collector Live Database|accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plot was supposed to take place between the first film and ''The Mummy Returns''. Rick and Evelyn are on their honeymoon in Egypt and end up embarking on yet another adventure where they must unravel the mysteries of the Orb of Destiny and discover the location of the Valley of the Gods hidden beneath the sands. However, the second and third issues were never published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comiccollectorlive.com/LiveData/Issue.aspx?id=c842164c-db3d-4971-9e13-3bda3d8e555a|title=The Mummy Valley of the Gods (Issue #2)|publisher=Comic Collector Live Database|accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This was most likely due to Chaos later filing bankruptcy in 2002 and selling the rights to all their titles at that time.
Years later in 2008, another Mummy comic series was released by [[IDW Publishing]], spanning four issues. This series was titled ''The Mummy: The Rise and Fall of Xango's Ax''. Unlike the preceding comic series, all of the planned issues were published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comiccollectorlive.com/LiveData/CoverTitle_List.aspx?id=b72be0fe-3d59-4755-8aae-5922674ad4d8|title=The Mummy: the Rise and Fall of Xango's Ax (Issue List)|publisher=Comic Collector Live Database|accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2001 until 2003, an animated series simply titled ''[[The Mummy (TV series)|The Mummy]]'' was made by [[Universal Animation Studios]] where it was based on the Stephen Sommers series of films. The series was later renamed in the second season as ''The Mummy: Secrets of the Medjai''.

The film also inspired a [[roller coaster]] ride named ''[[Revenge of the Mummy|Revenge of the Mummy: The Ride]]'' in [[Universal Parks &amp; Resorts|Universal Studios Theme Parks]], [[Revenge of the Mummy#Universal Studios Florida|Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universalstudioshollywood.com/attr_rotm.html|title=Universal Studios Hollywood - Revenge of the Mummy - the Ride|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018222516/http://www.universalstudioshollywood.com/attr_rotm.html|archivedate=2008-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar rides can also be found in [[Revenge of the Mummy#Universal Studios Hollywood|Hollywood]] and [[Revenge of the Mummy#Universal Studios Singapore|Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universalorlando.com/usf_attr_mummy.html|title=Revenge of the Mummy: The Ride at Universal Orlando Resort|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="747">{{unreferenced|date=December 2015}}In [[comics]], the term '''two-ply''' refers to pre-bordered boards of 11 inches by 17 inches, commonly used by a comic book [[penciller]] in the creating of the individual pages for comic books. They often have a marked off art area which is 10 inches by 15 inches, which is the actual size of original comic book art. This format is larger than a printed comic page, and will get scaled down before it sees publication in a comic book.

The term 'ply' comes from the fact that the drawing board consists of two interwoven layers, resulting in a thickness made up of two layers or strands. It is sometimes referred to as a [[Bristol board]] or as Bristol paper.

'''''U.S. Marshals''''' is a 1998 American [[action film|action]] [[crime film|crime]] [[thriller film]] directed by [[Stuart Baird]]. The storyline was conceived from a screenplay written by [[Roy Huggins]] and [[John Pogue]]. The film is a spin-off to the 1993 motion picture ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'', which in turn was based on the [[The Fugitive (TV series)|television series of the same name]], created by Huggins. The story does not involve the character of [[Dr. Richard Kimble]], portrayed by [[Harrison Ford]] in the initial film, but instead the plot centers on United States Deputy Marshal [[Sam Gerard]], once again played by [[Tommy Lee Jones]]. The plot follows Gerard and his team as they pursue another fugitive, Mark Sheridan, played by [[Wesley Snipes]], who attempts to escape government officials following an international conspiracy scandal. The cast features [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Joe Pantoliano]], [[Daniel Roebuck]], [[Thomas Mills Wood|Tom Wood]], and [[LaTanya Richardson]], several of whom portrayed Deputy Marshals in the previous film.

The film was a co-production between the motion picture studios of [[Warner Bros.]] and Kopelson Entertainment. Theatrically, it was commercially distributed by Warner Bros. and by the Warner Home Video division for home media markets. On March 10, 1998, the original motion picture soundtrack was released by the [[Varèse Sarabande]] music label. The soundtrack was composed and orchestrated by musician [[Jerry Goldsmith]].

''U.S. Marshals'' premiered in theaters in the United States on March 6, 1998, grossing $57 million in its domestic run. The film took in an additional $45 million through international release for a worldwide total of $102 million. The film was generally met with mixed critical reviews. The film was released on home video on July 21, 1998.

==Plot==
In New York, security cameras in a [[United Nations]] parking garage record two [[Diplomatic Security Service]] (DSS) agents attempting to intercept a briefcase exchange between two men. One man kills the agents; the other escapes with top secret information.

In Chicago, months later, and after a horrible car crash, police arrest tow truck driver Mark Warren for possession of an illegal handgun and discover that he is federal fugitive Mark Roberts, wanted for a double homicide. Roberts boards a prisoner transport aircraft back to New York, sharing the flight with Deputy [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]] Samuel Gerard, who is escorting another prisoner to the transport's first stop in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]. A Chinese prisoner armed with a [[improvised firearm|zip gun]] tries to kill Roberts mid-flight but in the struggle, the bullet pierces a window, depressurizing the cabin and sending the prisoner and another Marshal to their deaths. The plane makes an emergency crash landing in Southern Illinois, where Roberts flees and Gerard issues a manhunt for the escapee. DSS Director Bertram Lamb reveals that Roberts' fingerprints ID him as the killer of his DSS agents and assigns DSS Special Agent John Royce to join Gerard's team to hunt Roberts. Gerard inspects Royce's firearm and dismissively insists Royce replace it with a Glock.

After traveling to New York City and securing money, weapons and fake identification, Roberts surveilles Chinese diplomat Xiang Chen, the other man from the parking garage. In Chicago, Gerard and the Marshals pursue several leads, including Roberts' girlfriend Marie Bineaux. Roberts secretly contacts Bineaux to explain that he secretly worked for the government and was ambushed during a routine exchange, killing the men before realizing they were DSS agents. The Marshals track the airplane mechanic who was bribed to hide the zip gun and discover too late that he has been murdered by Chen.

Gerard acquires the surveillance footage of the murders and discover Roberts killed the agents in self-defense and was wearing gloves; thus he could not have been identified by fingerprints at the scene as Lamb claimed. Confronted with the evidence, Lamb admits that Mark Roberts is in fact Mark Sheridan, a former [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] Marine, who was working as an [[Non-official cover|unofficial operative]] for the government. The DSS is investigating a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] within the U.S. State Department selling covert secrets to China, believed to be Sheridan. The agents were tailing Chen, a Chinese intelligence agent who was the contact between China and the mole, but when they tried to intercept the exchange, Sheridan killed them and fled.

Eventually, Gerard and his team catch up with Sheridan in Queens Hill Cemetery where he ambushes DSS Special Agent Frank Barrows, who conspired with the mole to frame Sheridan by duping him into making the exchange. As Sheridan holds Barrows hostage to try and clear his name, Chen inadvertently kills Barrows while trying to shoot Sheridan. Marshals Savannah Cooper and Bob Biggs apprehend Chen, while Sheridan flees to a retirement home followed by Gerard, Royce and Marshal Noah Newman. During a struggle, Royce disarms Sheridan and holds him at gunpoint. Before Royce can kill Sheridan, Newman walks into the room and Royce shoots Newman, giving Sheridan the opportunity to jump off the roof and onto a moving subway. Royce gives false information to Gerard, claiming that Sheridan shot Newman, who later dies of his injuries before he can reveal the truth.

Gerard, out for revenge, abandons his team and takes Royce along while following up on a new lead. They track Sheridan to a loading dock in [[Bayonne, New Jersey]] where he is stowing away on a freighter bound for Canada. Gerard confronts, fights and nearly kills Sheridan but lets his guard down, enabling Sheridan to get the upper hand. Royce unloads his new Glock at Sheridan, hitting him in the shoulder, and the marshals take Sheridan into custody.

At the hospital, Gerard recognizes the gun that killed Newman as Royce's old firearm. He leaves Royce alone and Royce goes in the hospital room, revealing himself to Sheridan as the mole who set him up just when Gerard walks in and questions Royce about killing Newman. Royce admits to being the mole, and to killing Newman since he witnessed Royce trying to kill Sheridan, then tells Gerard that he's doing the same thing with him, but Gerard is revealed to have emptied Royce's Glock beforehand. When Royce attempts to draw his backup firearm, Gerard shoots and kills him first.

Sheridan is publicly exonerated at a government hearing and makes peace with Gerard, who then gives his team a backhanded apology before they depart to honor Newman's memory.

The result is unconvincing and disorganized. Yes, there are some spectacular stunts and slick special effects sequences. Yes, Jones is right on the money, and Snipes makes a sympathetic fugitive. But it's the story that has to pull this train, and its derailment is about as definitive as the train crash in the earlier film.|source=—Roger Ebert, writing for the ''Chicago Sun-Times''&lt;ref name="ebert" /&gt;|align=left|width=40%|fontsize=85%|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|quoted=2}}
Barbara Shulgasser, writing in ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]'', commented in positive sentiment about the acting, saying, "The film's pacing is unimpeachable and good performances are delivered by Jones, Snipes, Irene Jacob as Sheridan's loyal girlfriend and, for brief moments, Kate Nelligan as Gerard's tough but lovable boss."&lt;ref&gt;Shulgasser, Barbara (6 March 1998).

Ergo, we can't be expected to give a rat's ass what happens to him — and don't."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Russell (6 March 1998).

The film however, was not without its detractors. Writing for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]], giving the film two and a half stars out of four, observed, "I didn't expect ''U.S. Marshals'' to be the equal of ''The Fugitive'', and it isn't. But I hoped it would approach the taut tension of the 1993 film, and it doesn't. It has extra scenes, needless characters, an aimless plot and a solution that the hero seems to keep learning and then forgetting."&lt;ref name="ebert"&gt;{{cite web | last = Ebert | first = Roger | date = 6 March 1998 | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19980306/REVIEWS/803060306/1023 | title = U.S. Marshals | work = Chicago Sun-Times | accessdate = 2012-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a primarily negative review, [[Mick LaSalle]], writing for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', called the film "a bad idea to begin with." He noted his confusion with the plot, remarking, "the movie tells us from the beginning that the fugitive is not quite innocent. He killed two fellow agents in self-defense. All this does is muddy the moral waters, making us queasy about the one guy we like. At no point is there ever a compelling reason to keep watching."&lt;ref&gt;LaSalle, Mick (6 March 1998).

As re-invented here, Gerard is a generic action hero; most of the quirks that made him interesting (and that earned Jones an Oscar) are absent. With a few minor re-writes, John McClane from the ''[[Die Hard (film series)|Die Hard]]'' movies could have been plugged into this role."&lt;ref&gt;Berardinelli, James (6 March 1998).

Dissatisfied with the film's quality, [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' said that it was "Not so much a sequel to ''The Fugitive'' as a lazy spin-off that imitates only what was boring and artificially frenetic about that earlier thriller; the little that kept it interesting—Tommy Lee Jones's Oscar-winning inflections, better-than-average direction—is nowhere in evidence."&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum, Jonathan (March 1998).

'''''Live at the Purple Onion''''' is the first special and [[DVD]] by American stand-up comedian [[Zach Galifianakis]] directed by Michael Blieden. The show was recorded at the San Francisco club [[The Purple Onion]] in June 2005.

== Synopsis ==
Galifianakis's routine features his trademark dry humor and a large portion of it is accompanied by a light piano piece played by him as bed music. It ends with him tearing off pages of a large pad of paper which contain pre-written, and largely self-deprecating, jokes, while the [[Pacific Boychoir]] sings "[[The Greatest Love of All]]". The DVD contains two separate sections which are cut to throughout the routine, often at times where the content of the routine may have to do with the content of the other portions. One of the sections is an unscripted roadtrip to The Purple Onion in a [[Volkswagen bus]] with Galifianakis and his friend Joe Wagner. The banter and happenings that occur seem to provide insights to where Galifianakis gets some of his comedy. The bus ends up breaking down just short of their goal so they finish the trip in a [[GoCar Tours|GoCar]], a small rental vehicle meant for tourists. The second section is a loosely scripted interview of Galifianakis's brother "Seth Galifianakis" (played by Galifianakis) by [[Brian Unger]].
