'''AWB Limited''' was a major [[grain]] marketing organisation based in [[Australia]]. It was a government body known as the '''Australian Wheat Board''' until 1 July 1999, when the AWB was transformed into a private company, owned by wheat growers. In 2010, AWB was acquired by the Canadian firm [[Agrium]], and in 2011 the company changed its name to Agrium Asia Pacific Limited. In 2011, Cargill Australia acquired the AWB Commodity Management business from Agrium. This follows the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission|ACCC]]'s decision on March 17, 2011 not to oppose the acquisition.

==History of the company==
The AWB was founded in the late 1930s, to regulate the wheat market after the excesses of the [[Great Depression]]. The ''single desk'' dates to this period. This type of arrangement was not unique to Australia, as the [[Canadian Wheat Board]] was created in 1935 in a similar fashion (but its history dates back to an earlier wheat marketing board created during the Great War, and also includes the experience of cooperative [[wheat pools]] during the 1920s).

For much of its early history, it was a government-run and owned company. However, from July 1999, its board was restructured into a private company. It offered "class A" shares to those who meet its definition of "growers" and who had the ability to elect the majority of its board and chairperson,&lt;ref name="AWB Constitution"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rural/wa/content/2006/s2138065.htm AWB Constitution]", [[ABC Rural]], 14 January 2008. Retrieved 25 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and from August 2001, 'class B' were publicly traded on the [[Australian Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref name="AWB Ltd Corporate History"&gt;"[http://www.awb.com.au/aboutawb/corporate/history/ Corporate History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310081725/http://www.awb.com.au/aboutawb/corporate/history |date=2010-03-10 }}", AWB Limited. Retrieved 25 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, constitutional amendments were passed. Despite resistance from several wheat lobbies and industry groups,&lt;ref name="AWB Constitution"/&gt; it consolidated ownership of AWB into one type of share, giving growers no special consideration. This change was proposed by the AWB management as necessarily to having a simpler, lower-risk business model.&lt;ref name="AWB Ltd 2009 Annual Review"&gt;"[http://www.awb.com.au/NR/rdonlyres/C38AADA3-48DE-430B-A05E-0291CDB647DE/0/2009_Annual_Review.pdf AWB Ltd 2009 Annual Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706101901/http://www.awb.com.au/NR/rdonlyres/C38AADA3-48DE-430B-A05E-0291CDB647DE/0/2009_Annual_Review.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}", AWB Limited. Retrieved 25 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Since privatisation, AWB has grown to incorporate a number of subsidiaries to diversify its income away from its wheat exports. Its subsidiary businesses include GrainFlow to manage collection of grain from farmers to ports, companies to ship the grain overseas to customers, and Landmark rural services.

By its own estimation, AWB is now a "grower owned and controlled company".&lt;ref name="AWB Ltd Corporate History"/&gt;

==Corporate structure==
AWB Limited was a holding company owning a number of subsidiaries. Its shares were freely traded on the Australian Stock Exchange.

AWB Limited had a number of subsidiaries. Some of these subsidiaries existed due to legislative requirements relating to the operation of the single desk; others exist for the purpose of controlling credit risk. As of early 2006, they were:
*AWB Limited - the holding company
*AWB (International) Limited - the corporation authorised by federal legislation to export wheat under the monopsony
*AWB (Australia) Limited - domestic wheat trading and export of non-wheat grains
*AWB Services Limited - provides services (e.g. financial services, IT services, asset management) to the rest of the AWB group
*AWB Harvest Finance Limited, AWB Commercial Funding Limited, and AWB Riskassist Limited - provide finance and financial risk management for wheat export transactions
*AWB GrainFlow Pty Ltd - provides bulk grain handling and transport facilities
*Landmark (comprised Landmark Operations Limited and Landmark (Qld) Limited) provides finance, insurance, real estate, commodities trading, farming equipment sales, etc. to Australian farmers (including other agricultural sectors such as wool and livestock)

AWB announced a new strategy in 2009 to simplify and de-risk the business. This resulted in the divestment of the financial services loan book to ANZ in December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Completion of Landmark Financial Services sale to ANZ |url=http://www.awb.com.au/investors/companyannouncements/current/ASX_Completion_of_Landmark_Financial_Services_Sale_to_ANZ.htm |publisher=ASX |accessdate=24 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312095710/http://www.awb.com.au/investors/companyannouncements/current/ASX_Completion_of_Landmark_Financial_Services_Sale_to_ANZ.htm |archivedate=12 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, AWB announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding to sell the Geneva business and to joint venture the local grain trading business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AWB and Gavilon sign MoU regarding Commodities Management |url=http://www.awb.com.au/investors/companyannouncements/current/ASX_AWB_and_Gavilon_sign_Memorandum_of_Understanding_regarding_Commodities_Management.htm |publisher=ASX |accessdate=24 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312095043/http://www.awb.com.au/investors/companyannouncements/current/ASX_AWB_and_Gavilon_sign_Memorandum_of_Understanding_regarding_Commodities_Management.htm |archivedate=12 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oil for food scandal==
{{main|AWB oil-for-wheat scandal}}
Previously a low profile organisation, the AWB made headlines in late 2005 when it was alleged that it had knowingly paid kickbacks to the [[Iraq]] Government, in violation of [[United Nations]] [[Sanctions against Iraq|sanctions]] and Australian law. Following the Iraqi [[invasion of Kuwait]] in 1990, the United Nations had imposed a financial and trade embargo on Iraq. However, after facing criticism over the humanitarian impacts of the sanctions, the UN from 1995 until late 2003 allowed Iraq to [[Oil-for-Food Programme|trade oil]] on the world market in exchange for food, medicine and other humanitarian needs.

Despite this, at the insistence of the Iraq government of dictator [[Saddam Hussein]], the AWB agreed to pay "transportation fees" of around $[[Australian dollar|A$]]290 million. This money was paid to a Jordanian transportation company, Alia. Alia kept a small percentage of the fees, and paid the remainder onto Saddam's government. This breached the sanctions placed on the Iraqi regime.

The government-sanctioned [[Cole Inquiry]] into the company's role in the scandal has been completed and was tabled by [[Attorney-General of Australia|Attorney-General]] [[Philip Ruddock]] on 27 November 2006.&lt;ref name="Cole Recommends Criminal Probe"&gt;"[https://archive.is/20121230202003/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,20828605-2,00.html Cole Recommends Criminal Probe]", [[News Limited]], 2006. Retrieved 27/11/06&lt;/ref&gt; The report found that, from mid-1999, AWB had knowingly entered into an arrangement that involved paying kickbacks to the Iraqi government, in order to retain its business.&lt;ref name="27 November 2006"&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary, Recommendations and Background |url=http://www.ag.gov.au/agd/WWW/unoilforfoodinquiry.nsf/Page/RWP2A85EEC3CD2DFAF0CA257264000046AE#SummaryRecommendations |work=Cole Inquiry |publisher=Australian Department of the Attorney-General |accessdate=24 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110323160931/http://www.ag.gov.au/agd/WWW/unoilforfoodinquiry.nsf/Page/RWP2A85EEC3CD2DFAF0CA257264000046AE |archivedate=23 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Inquiry recommended that 12 people be investigated for possible criminal and corporations offences over the scandal.&lt;ref name="Cole Recommends Criminal Probe"/&gt;

At the height of the investigation, the single-desk arrangement from which AWB benefits came under criticism. In 2006, the Australian Grain Exporters Association asked the Government to remove AWB's monopoly export powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Clifford|first=Catherine|title=Grain exporters wants AWB monopoly removed|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rural/tas/content/2006/s1555197.htm|accessdate=25 May 2010|newspaper=ABC Rural News|date=25 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oil-for-wheat scandal cast doubt among some grain exporters over the trust placed in the company, especially as they lost the ability to export to Iraq during the length of the Cole Inquiry, losing one of their biggest markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCutcheon|first=Peter|title=Wheat farmers consider the future of single desk policy|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2006/s1571832.htm|accessdate=25 May 2010|newspaper=ABC News, 7.30 Report|date=16 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scandal resulted in international condemnation and litigation. On 11 July 2006, North American farmers claimed $1 billion in damages from AWB at [[Washington DC]], alleging the Australian wheat exporter used bribery and other corrupt activities to corner grain markets. The growers claimed that AWB used the same techniques to secure grain sales in other markets in Asia and other countries in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US wheat farmers sue AWB|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200607/s1683396.htm|accessdate=24 May 2010|newspaper=ABC News Online|date=11 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was dismissed in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US court dismisses AWB lawsuit|url=http://www.theage.com.au/business/us-court-dismisses-awb-lawsuit-20080327-21sv.html|accessdate=24 May 2010|newspaper=The Age|date=27 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, the [[Australian Federal Police]] dropped their investigation into any criminal actions undertaken by AWB and others in this matter. This decision came after Paul Hastings QC declared the prospect of convictions was limited and "not in the public interest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Overington|first=Caroline|author-link=Caroline Overington|title=Federal police drop AWB investigation|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/news/federal-police-drop-awb-investigation/story-e6frg90f-1225767255737|accessdate=24 May 2010|newspaper=The Australian|publisher=News Limited|date=29 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]] then proceeded with several civil cases against six former directors and officers of AWB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ASIC launches civil penalty action against former officers of AWB |url=http://www.asic.gov.au/asic/asic.nsf/byheadline/07-332+ASIC+launches+civil+penalty+action+against+former+officers+of+AWB?openDocument |work=ASIC Media Centre |publisher=ASIC |accessdate=24 May 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510115536/http://www.asic.gov.au/asic/asic.nsf/byheadline/07-332%2BASIC%2Blaunches%2Bcivil%2Bpenalty%2Baction%2Bagainst%2Bformer%2Bofficers%2Bof%2BAWB?openDocument |archivedate=2010-05-10 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two have been against [[Andrew Lindberg]], AWB's former head. Both are still in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ASIC to push ahead with AWB case|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/02/19/2824879.htm|accessdate=24 May 2010|newspaper=ABC News|date=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another civil case was brought by shareholders of AWB, and was settled out of court for $39.5 million in February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Casben|first=Liv|title=AWB to pay shareholders $40m|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/02/15/2820113.htm|accessdate=24 May 2010|newspaper=ABC News|date=15 Feb 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia's government has distanced itself from the payments to Saddam Hussein's regime, given Australia's contribution to military action against Hussein in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. Andrew Lindberg resigned as managing director on 9 February 2006 and from the board of directors on 22 February 2006 under intense public and media pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=AAP|title=Kickbacks: AWB boss quits|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/business/kickbacks-awb-boss-quits/2006/02/09/1139379621332.html|accessdate=24 May 2010|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=9 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business performance post Cole Inquiry==
In the years immediately following the Cole Inquiry, AWB continued to be dogged by bad performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Leyonhjelm|first=David|title=Was the old AWB better?|url=http://www.businessspectator.com.au/bs.nsf/Article/AWBs-dull-new-leaf-pd20100318-3N3NR?opendocument&amp;src=rss|accessdate=24 May 2010|newspaper=Business Spectator|date=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company remains liable in several civil cases being completed, and has not always been successful in its attempts to find new markets.

Following the publication of the Cole Inquiry, a new management team was installed under the leadership of Gordon Davis who was recruited from [[Orica]] in August 2006. Davis successfully reformed the constitution and the shareholder structure to consolidate into 1 class of shareholder.&lt;ref name="AWB Ltd 2009 Annual Review"/&gt;

This new management team has not been entirely without controversy. On 26 April 2007, Yahoo News reported that AWB also breached US sanctions on Iran. These sanctions prohibit American citizens and companies using American currency from trading with Iran. In 2006, AWB’s US subsidiary (which trades using American currency) attempted to pay an Iranian transport company approximately $1 million, in clear breach of the US sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=AAP|title=AWB 'breaches UN sanctions on Iran|url=http://news.smh.com.au/national/awb-breaches-un-sanctions-on-iran-20070426-9k7.html|accessdate=24 May 2010|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=26 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the company faced difficulties in another new market, when it was forced to recapitalise the balance sheet after the company produced significant losses from the expansion of trading activities into Brazil under Davis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hopkins|first=Philip|title=AWB closes Brazil ops after $65m loss|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/awb-closes-brazil-ops-after-65m-loss-20090722-dtk2.html|accessdate=24 May 2010|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=23 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite making a small profit in 2009,&lt;ref name="AWB still paying a high price for Iraq kickbacks"&gt;{{cite news|last=Brindal|first=Ray|title=
AWB still paying a high price for Iraq kickbacks|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/awb-still-paying-a-high-price-for-iraq-kickbacks/story-e6frg8zx-1225868886899|accessdate=20 May 2010|newspaper=The Australian|date=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in March 2010, the company announced a profit downgrade from domestic trading activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brindal|first=Ray|title=AWB falls sharply on profit downgrade|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/industry-sectors/awb-falls-sharply-on-profit-downgrade/story-e6frg95o-1225841925516|accessdate=24 May 2010|newspaper=The Australian|date=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, it reported a half-year loss of $64.8 million, which it claimed due to the cost of settling the shareholder class action for $39.5m, and a loss of $65.4m on restructuring costs associated with its sale of the Landmark Financial Services loan and deposit books.&lt;ref name="AWB still paying a high price for Iraq kickbacks"/&gt;

== Acquisition ==
In 2010, AWB accepted a takeover bid from [[Agrium]] at A$1.50 a share, or $1.2 billion in total, which was later approved by Australia's [[Foreign Investment Review Board]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/article/2010/11/01/251781_business-news.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Cargill Australia acquired the AWB Commodity Management business from Agrium. This follows the ACCC's decision on March 17, 2011 not to oppose the acquisition.

Accessed 19 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Business career===
In 1972 Bakrie joined PT Bakrie &amp; Brothers Tbk known today as the [[Bakrie Group]], the conglomerate founded by his late father {{Interlanguage link multi|Achmad Bakrie|id}}, which prospered much like the rest of the Indonesian economy during the [[Soeharto]] presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/mud-flung-at-minister-in-wake-of-java-disaster/2006/06/22/1150845316233.html|author=Mark Forbes |title=Mud flung at minister in wake of Java disaster| date=23 June 2006|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bakrie Group conducts business in agriculture, real estate, trade, shipping, banking, insurance, media, manufacturing, construction, and mining.  Aburizal Bakrie, the eldest of four siblings was the chairman of the family enterprise from 1999 to 2004. In 1998 the [[Asian economic crisis]] challenged Bakrie's control of the conglomerate, from which he emerged victorious after a successful refinancing process in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.ibonweb.com/webarticle.asp?num=525 |title=Bakrie's Restructuring of Debts Completed|work=IBonWeb.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518001056/http://articles.ibonweb.com/webarticle.asp?num=525|archivedate=18 May 2006 |date=30 November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public offices===
From 1991 to 1995 Bakrie served two consecutive terms as the President of the [[ASEAN]] Business Forum and two consecutive terms from 1994 to 2004 as the President of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (aka [[:id:Kadin|Kadin]]).&lt;ref name="minister"/&gt; As a member of the [[Golkar]] party Bakrie was running to become Golkar's candidate for the presidency in 2004.

====Coordinating Minister for Economy====
In 2004 Bakrie retired from [[:id:Bakrie &amp; Brothers|PT Bakrie &amp; Brothers Tbk]] before being named Coordinating Minister for Economy.&lt;ref name="minister"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cacci.org.tw/CACCI%20Profile/2004%20Nov/Bakrie.pdf |title=Mr. Aburizal Bakrie now economic minister of Indonesia |author=CACCI Profile, 2004 |accessdate=15 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227200709/http://www.cacci.org.tw/CACCI%20Profile/2004%20Nov/Bakrie.pdf |archivedate=27 December 2005 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment by President [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] was initially viewed with some reservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/3756870.stm |author=BBC News |date=20 October 2004 |title=Indonesian leader sets out goals}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after being named to the cabinet of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Bakrie set in motion a new government policy calling for a 3% reduction of Indonesians living in poverty, by reducing fuel subsidies in exchange for financial support to approximately 6 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Government to Maintain Increased Fuel Prices |url=http://www.tempo.co.id/hg/nasional/2005/03/16/brk,20050316-03,uk.html |accessdate=17 April 2012 |newspaper=- TEMPO Interactive |date=16 March 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324022704/http://www.tempo.co.id/hg/nasional/2005/03/16/brk%2C20050316-03%2Cuk.html |archivedate=24 March 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakrie argued the government's need to gradually increase fuel prices to keep fuel subsidies from busting its budget, while bringing the cost of fuel closer to international levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indonesia Min: New Fuel Prices To Remain Below International Prices|url=http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Soc/soc.culture.cambodia/2005-09/msg00205.html|accessdate=17 April 2012|newspaper=Dow Jones|date=29 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; By October 2005 and after two price hikes, the cost of fuel increased by 126%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indonesia raises fuel prices by 126%|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/103aebc0-3219-11da-9c7f-00000e2511c8.html|accessdate=17 April 2012|newspaper=Financial Times|date=1 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] rated the hike as an encouraging move to relieve immediate pressure on the country's fiscal position and external balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indonesia's donors support latest fuel price hike, Bakrie|url=http://www.finanznachrichten.de/nachrichten-2005-10/1964829-indonesia-s-donors-support-latest-fuel-price-hike-bakrie-020.htm|accessdate=17 April 2012|newspaper=AFX News|date=3 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a move to stem Indonesia's declining output of crude oil, Bakrie weighed in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Exxon Claims Right To Run Cepu Oil|url=http://www.shana.ir/newsprint.aspx?lang=en&amp;newsid=71985|accessdate=17 April 2012|newspaper=Shana News|date=17 November 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924102330/http://www.shana.ir/newsprint.aspx?lang=en&amp;newsid=71985|archive-date=24 September 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; to end a standoff between [[ExxonMobil Corporation]] and [[:id:PT Pertamina|PT Pertamina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indonesia: ExxonMobil Cepu oil field to begin full production|url=http://www.energy-pedia.com/news/indonesia/exxonmobil-cepu-oil-field-to-begin-full-production|accessdate=17 April 2012|newspaper=energy-pedia news|date=29 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The companies had been at odds for many years, following their dispute over operational and profit sharing issues in the [[:id:Blok Cepu|Cepu Block]] oil fields project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cepu Block|url=http://cepublock.com/about/eng/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501004057/http://cepublock.com/about/eng/|archivedate=1 May 2011 |accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[OPEC]] member's biggest oil discovery on Java in decades. The previous year Bakrie pledged that the new government wanted to resolve the Cepu and other disputes involving international companies, in a show of its commitment to improving Indonesia's investment climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jakarta plans to resolve dispute over giant oilfield|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ff341a28-36aa-11d9-b856-00000e2511c8.html#axzz1omKwyLiE|accessdate=17 April 2012|newspaper=Financial Times|date=15 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare====
After a reshuffling of the cabinet in 2005, Bakrie was appointed Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare. In May 2008 Bakrie announced the handout of $1.52 billion to nearly 19 million low income households as part of a direct cash relief program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.balidiscovery.com/messages/printmessage.asp?Id=4528|title=Fuel prices to increase after May 23.

====Chairman of Golkar party====
In 2009 Bakrie was elected as the Chairman of [[Golkar]] party at Golkar Party Congress in [[Pekanbaru]], [[Riau]], [[Indonesia]] after defeating [[Surya Paloh]], Yuddy Chrisnandi and [[Hutomo Mandala Putra]]. In May 2010, he successfully formed and was elected the leader of a majority parliamentary coalition with President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's party.

===Sidoardjo mudflow disaster===
Bakrie's name has been mentioned in reference with the [[Sidoarjo mud flow]] that erupted on 29 May 2006 in [[Sidoarjo]], a regency of Eastern [[Java]], causing significant devastation to the environment and loss of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Catastrophic Mud Eruption Had Natural Causes |author=Charles Choi |url=http://news.discovery.com/earth/weather-extreme-events/mud-eruption-caused-by-earthquake-130722.htm |newspaper=[[Discovery News]] |date=22 July 2013 |accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists are divided over the cause that triggered the mud flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mud Eruption in Indonesia: Was Disaster Blamed On Drilling Activity Actually Caused By Quake? |author=LiveScience |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/22/mud-eruption-indonesia-disaster-drilling-quake_n_3634361.html |newspaper=[[Huffington Post]] |date=22 July 2013 |accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One side is claiming it was a natural occurrence caused by a [[2006 Yogyakarta earthquake|6.3-magnitude earthquake]] that occurred two days earlier near [[Yogyakarta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Study starts debate over Indonesia volcano |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/study-starts-debate-over-indonesia-volcano/story-fn3dxix6-1226683627179 |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |date=23 July 2013 |accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the other side and government confirmed  the drilling practices of the [[PT Lapindo Brantas]], a company in which Bakrie's family was a controlling shareholder, triggered the mudflow. The media coverage as a result remains mixed.&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;{{cite news |title=Indonesia's Teflon tycoon |author=[[Staff writer]] |url=http://www.economist.com/node/15278524 |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=14 January 2010 |accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although environmental groups urged Indonesia's government to revoke the drilling license of PT Lapindo Brantas for environmental mismanagement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shut Lapindo well, arrest management, government told |author=Arie Rukmantara |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2006/06/14/shut-lapindo-well-arrest-management-government-told.html |newspaper=[[The Jakarta Post]] |date=14 June 2006 |accessdate=20 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010150605/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2006/06/14/shut-lapindo-well-arrest-management-government-told.html |archivedate=10 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; a three-year police investigation into the incident ended with the case being dropped. According to the ''[[Jakarta Globe]]'', [[Effendi Simbolon]], a legislator from the [[Indonesian Democratic Party – Struggle|Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle PDI-P]] and deputy chairman of House of Representatives Commission VII, which oversees mines and energy affairs, said that "the criticism of Bakrie, whose family controls the company that is widely blamed for the disaster, was unwarranted, politicized and based largely on jealousy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Politicians Defend Bakrie, Say Sidoarjo Victims Are Better Off |author=Fidelis E Satriastanti, Ezra Sihite &amp; Markus Junianto Sihaloho |url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/nvironment/politicians-defend-bakrie-say-sidoarjo-victims-are-better-off/520981 |newspaper=[[The Jakarta Globe]] |date=30 May 2012 |accessdate=30 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601232820/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/nvironment/politicians-defend-bakrie-say-sidoarjo-victims-are-better-off/520981 |archivedate=1 June 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 report indicated that for nearly seven years the mudflow had been wreaking havoc in the livelihoods of Porong residents in particular and on the Sidoarjo economy as a whole. The mudflow had also buried more than 600 hectares of land, displacing 39,700 people and submerging three subdistricts, 12 villages, 11,241 buildings and 362 hectares of rice fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mudflow Erupting After Seven Years |author=Hans David Tampubolong |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/03/05/mudflow-erupting-after-7-years.html |date=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidential elections 2014===
In the fall of 2010 media coverage started to indicate that Bakrie was seeking to become the [[Golkar Party]]'s presidential candidate in [[Indonesian presidential election, 2014|Indonesia's 2014 Presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/aburizal-in-2014-if-the-polls-are-right/398615 |author=Markus Junianto Sihaloho |title=Aburizal in 2014, if the Polls Are Right |date=29 September 2010 |work=The Jakarta Globe |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922151120/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/aburizal-in-2014-if-the-polls-are-right/398615 |archivedate=22 September 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/SEAsia/Story/STIStory_712180.html|author=AFP |title= Indonesian tycoon Aburizal Bakrie to run for president | date=12 September 2011|work=The Straits Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Bakrie repeatedly expressed his desire to be nominated as Golkar's presidential candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/politics/im-ready-for-2014-bakrie/499072 |author=JG |title=I'm Ready For 2014 |date=19 February 2012 |work=The Jakarta Globe |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221055332/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/politics/im-ready-for-2014-bakrie/499072 |archivedate=21 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Media reports also suggested the Golkar Party had already commenced its search for a [[running mate]] to team up with Bakrie,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/78744/golkar-seeking-running-mate-for-aburizal-as-presidential-candidate|author=ANTARA |title= Golkar seeking running mate for Aburizal as presidential candidate | date=28 December 2011|work=[[Antara (news agency)|Antara]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; introducing names like [[Hamengkubuwana X|Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwana X]] the current Governor of Yogyakarta,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Golkar Party Yogyakarta branches declare Sultan as VP candidate |author=Slamet Susanto |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/06/24/golkar-party-yogyakarta-branches-declare-sultan-vp-candidate.html |newspaper=[[The Jakarta Post]] |date=24 June 2012 |accessdate=4 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627061759/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/06/24/golkar-party-yogyakarta-branches-declare-sultan-vp-candidate.html |archivedate=27 June 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:id:Pramono Anung|Pramono Anung]] the Secretary General of the [[Indonesian Democratic Party]] and Deputy House Speaker, [[Dahlan Iskan]] the State Enterprises Minister, as well as [[:id:Edhie Baskoro Yudhoyono|Edhie Baskoro Yudhoyono]] the youngest son of Indonesia's current President [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bakrie Considers Unlikely Pairing with SBY's Son |author=Ezra Sihite |url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/politics/bakrie-considers-unlikely-pairing-with-sbys-son/525725 |newspaper=[[The Jakarta Globe]] |date=21 June 2012 |accessdate=4 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625143723/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/politics/bakrie-considers-unlikely-pairing-with-sbys-son/525725 |archivedate=25 June 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''anti-globalization movement''', or '''counter-globalisation movement''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Derrida]] (May 2004) ''[http://mondediplo.com/2004/11/06derrida Enlightenment past and to come]'', speech at the party for 50 years of ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]''&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[social movement]] critical of [[economic globalization]]. The movement is also commonly referred to as the [[global justice movement]],&lt;ref name=DDP&gt;{{cite book | editor-last = Della Porta | editor-first = Donatella | editor-link = Donatella della Porta | title = The Global Justice Movement: Cross-national And Transnational Perspectives | publisher = Paradigm | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-1-59451-305-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[alter-globalization]] movement, anti-globalist movement, [[anti-corporate activism|anti-corporate]] globalization movement,&lt;ref name=Juris&gt;{{cite book | last = Juris | first = Jeffrey S. | title =

Participants base their criticisms on a number of related ideas.&lt;ref&gt;No Logo: No Space, No Choice, No Jobs by Canadian journalist Naomi Klein.&lt;/ref&gt;  What is shared is that participants oppose large, [[multinational corporation]]s having unregulated political power, exercised through [[trade agreements]] and deregulated financial markets. Specifically, corporations are accused of seeking to maximize profit at the expense of work safety conditions and standards, labour hiring and compensation standards, environmental conservation principles, and the integrity of national legislative authority, independence and sovereignty. {{as of|2012|January}}, some commentators have characterized changes in the global economy as "turbo-capitalism" ([[Edward Luttwak]]), "[[market fundamentalism]]" ([[George Soros]]), [[Casino Capitalism|"casino capitalism"]] ([[Susan Strange]]),&lt;ref&gt;Strange, Susan: Casino Capitalism. Oxford: Blackwell, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; and as "McWorld" ([[Benjamin Barber]]).

Many anti-globalization activists do not oppose [[globalization]] in general and call for forms of global integration that better provide [[democratic representation]], advancement of [[human rights]], [[fair trade]] and [[sustainable development]] and therefore feel the term "anti-globalization" is misleading.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Douglas ''[http://www3.fis.utoronto.ca/research/iprp/c3n/CI/DMorris.htm Globalization and Media Democracy: The Case of Indymedia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304030415/http://www3.fis.utoronto.ca/research/iprp/c3n/CI/DMorris.htm |date=2009-03-04 }}'' (pre-publication version)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Podobnik, Bruce, ''[http://convention.allacademic.com/asa2003/view_paper_info.html?pub_id=179&amp;part_id1=13161 Resistance to Globalization: Cycles and Evolutions in the Globalization Protest Movement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228081453/http://convention.allacademic.com/asa2003/view_paper_info.html?pub_id=179&amp;part_id1=13161 |date=2008-02-28 }}'', p. 2.

The term 'anti-globalization' is in many ways a misnomer, since the group represents a wide range of interests and issues and many of the people involved in the anti-globalization movement do support closer ties between the various peoples and cultures of the world through, for example, aid, assistance for refugees, and global environmental issues.")&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology and causes==
{{Main|Criticisms of globalization}}
Supporters believe that by the late 20th century those they characterized as "ruling elites" sought to harness the expansion of world markets for their own interests; this combination of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]] institutions, states, and multinational corporations has been called "[[globalization]]" or "globalization from above." In reaction, various social movements emerged to challenge their influence; these movements have been called "anti-globalization" or "globalization from below."&lt;ref&gt;Korzeniewicz, Roberto Patricio &amp; Smith, William C., 2001, ''Protest and Collaboration: Transnational Civil Society Networks and the Politics of Summitry and Free Trade in the Americas'', pp. 4-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to international financial institutions and transnational corporations===
People opposing globalization believe that international agreements and global financial institutions, such as the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Trade Organization]], undermine local decision-making. Corporations that use these institutions to support their own corporate and financial interests, can exercise privileges that individuals and small businesses cannot,&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph E., "Globalism's Discontents", The American Prospect, 13, 1, January 2002, PP. 1-14&lt;/ref&gt; including the ability to:
# move freely across borders.
# extract desired [[natural resources]].
# use a wide variety of [[human resources]].
The movement aims for an end to the legal status of "[[Juristic person|corporate personhood]]" and the dissolution of [[free market fundamentalism]] and the radical economic privatization measures of the [[World Bank]], the IMF, and the World Trade Organization.
[[File:Antiglob rostock 2 6 07.jpg|thumb|left|Protest against the [[33rd G8 summit|G8-meeting]] in [[Heiligendamm]], 2007.]]

Activists are especially opposed to the various abuses which they think are perpetuated by globalization and the international institutions that, they say, promote [[neoliberalism]] without regard to ethical standards or environmental protection.&lt;ref name="Bakari13"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bakari|first=Mohamed El-Kamel|title=Globalization and Sustainable Development: False Twins?|journal=New Global Studies|volume=7|issue=3|pages=23–56|issn=1940-0004|doi=10.1515/ngs-2013-021|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common targets include the [[World Bank]] (WB), [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and [[free trade]] treaties like the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] (FTAA), the Trans Pacific Trade Agreement (TPPA), the [[Multilateral Agreement on Investment]] (MAI) and the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]] (GATS). In light of the economic gap between rich and poor countries, adherents of the movement claim that free trade without measures to protect the environment and the health and wellbeing of workers will merely increase the power of industrialized nations (often termed the "North" in opposition to the developing world's "South"). Proponents of this line of thought refer to the process as polarization and argue that current neo-liberal economic policies have given wealthier states an advantage over developing nations, enabling their exploitation and leading to a widening of the global wealth gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Byrne, Hensby|first=Darren J., Alexander|title=Theorizing Global Studies|year=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=UK|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by [[Jean Ziegler]], [[UN Special Rapporteur]] on the [[right to food]], notes that "millions of farmers are losing their livelihoods in the developing countries, but small farmers in the northern countries are also suffering" and concludes that "the current inequities of the global trading system are being perpetuated rather than resolved under the WTO, given the unequal balance of power between member countries."&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, Jean, 2004, [http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/34441bf9efe3a9e3c1256e6300510e24/$FILE/G0410777.pdf ''Economic, social and cultural rights - The right to food''], page 9&lt;/ref&gt;  Activists point to the unequal footing and power between developed and developing nations within the WTO and with respect to global trade, most specifically in relation to the protectionist policies towards agriculture enacted in many developed countries. These activists also point out that heavy subsidization of developed nations' agriculture and the aggressive use of export subsidies by some developed nations to make their agricultural products more attractive on the international market are major causes of declines in the agricultural sectors of many developing nations.

===Global opposition to neoliberalism===
Through the [[Internet]], a movement began to develop in opposition to the doctrines of [[neoliberalism]] which were widely manifested in the 1990s when the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) proposed liberalization of cross-border investment and trade restrictions through its [[Multilateral Agreement on Investment]] (MAI). This treaty was prematurely exposed to public scrutiny and subsequently abandoned in November 1998 in the face of strenuous protest and criticism by national and international [[civil society]] representatives.

Neoliberal doctrine argued that untrammeled [[free trade]] and reduction of public-sector regulation would bring benefits to poor countries and to disadvantaged people in rich countries. Anti-globalization advocates urge that preservation of the natural environment, human rights (especially workplace rights and conditions) and democratic institutions are likely to be placed at undue risk by globalization unless mandatory standards are attached to liberalization. [[Noam Chomsky]] stated in 2002 that
{{quote|The term "globalization" has been appropriated by the powerful to refer to a specific form of international economic integration, one based on investor rights, with the interests of people incidental. That is why the business press, in its more honest moments, refers to the "free trade agreements" as "free investment agreements" (Wall St. Journal). Accordingly, advocates of other forms of globalization are described as "anti-globalization"; and some, unfortunately, even accept this term, though it is a term of [[propaganda]] that should be dismissed with ridicule. No sane person is opposed to globalization, that is, international integration. Surely not the left and the workers movements, which were founded on the principle of international solidarity—that is, globalization in a form that attends to the rights of people, not private power systems.&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky Znet May 07, 2002 / The Croatian Feral Tribune April 27, 2002 {{cite web|url=http://www.zmag.org/content/TerrorWar/chomskygab.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070807064137/https://www.zmag.org/content/TerrorWar/chomskygab.cfm |archivedate=August 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Anti-war movement===
{{Main|Anti-war movement}}
By 2002, many parts of the movement showed wide opposition to the impending [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]]. Many participants were among those 11 million or more protesters that on the weekend of February 15, 2003, participated in global [[February 15, 2003 anti-war protest|protests against the imminent Iraq war]]. Other anti-war demonstrations were [[Community organizing|organized]] by the antiglobalization movement: see for example the large demonstration, organized against the impending war in Iraq, which closed the first [[European Social Forum]] in November 2002 in [[Florence]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/1109-01.htm |title="Half-A-Million March in Anti-War Rally in Italy", ''Reuters'', November 9, 2002, Luke Baker |publisher=Commondreams.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK20uY9X?url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/1109-01.htm |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-globalization militants worried for a proper functioning of democratic institutions as the leaders of many democratic countries ([[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Poland]] and the [[United Kingdom]]) were acting against the wishes of the majorities of their populations in supporting the war.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, 2003, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/29/spain.iraq .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, 2003, https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/feb/18/politics.iraq&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky asserted that these leaders "showed their contempt for democracy". Critics of this type of argument have tended to point out that this is just a standard criticism of [[representative democracy]] — a democratically elected government will not always act in the direction of greatest current public support — and that, therefore, there is no inconsistency in the leaders' positions given that these countries are [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracies]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The [[economics|economic]] and [[war|military]] issues are closely linked in the eyes of many within the movement.

===Appropriateness of the term===
Many participants (see Noam Chomsky's quotes above) consider the term "anti-globalization" to be a [[misnomer]]. The term suggests that its followers support [[protectionism]] and/or [[nationalism]], which is not always the case - in fact, some supporters of anti-globalization are strong opponents of both nationalism and protectionism: for example, the [[No Border network]] argues for unrestricted migration and the abolition of all national border controls. S. A. Hamed Hosseini (an Australian sociologist and expert in global social movement studies), argues that the term anti-globalization can be ideal-typically used only to refer to only one ideological vision he detects alongside three other visions (the [[anti-globalist]], the [[alter-globalist]] and the [[alter-globalization]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hosseini|first=S A Hamed|title=Alternative globalizations: an integrative approach to studying dissident knowledge in the global justice movement|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-49476-2|url=http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415494762/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the three latter ideal-typical visions can be categorized under the title of [[global justice movement]]. According to him, while the first two visions (the alter-globalism and the anti-globalism) represent the reconstructed forms of old and new left ideologies, respectively, in the context of current globalization, only the third one has shown the capacity to respond more effectively to the intellectual requirements of today's [[global complexities]]. Underlying this vision is a new conception of justice, coined [[accommodative justice]] by Hosseini,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hosseini|first=S A Hamed|title=Global Complexities and the Rise of Global Justice Movement: A New Notion of Justice|journal=The Global Studies Journal|year=2009|volume=2|issue=3|pages=15–36|url=http://gsj.cgpublisher.com/product/pub.184/prod.118}}&lt;/ref&gt; a new approach towards cosmopolitanism ([[transversal cosmopolitanism]]), a new mode of [[activist knowledge]] ([[accommodative consciousness]]), and a new format of solidarity, [[interactive solidarity]].

Some activists, notably [[David Graeber]], see the movement as opposed instead to [[neoliberalism]] or "[[corporate globalization]]". He argues that the term "anti-globalization" is a term coined by the media, and that radical activists are actually more in favor of globalization, in the sense of "effacement of borders and the free movement of people, possessions and ideas" than are the IMF or WTO. He also notes that activists use the terms "globalization movement" and "anti-globalization movement" interchangeably, indicating the confusion of the terminology. The term "alter-globalization" has been used to make this distinction clear.

While the term "anti-globalization" arose from the movement's opposition to [[free-trade]] agreements (which have often been considered part of something called "[[globalization]]"), various participants contend they are opposed to only certain aspects of globalization and instead describe themselves, at least in French-speaking organizations, as "[[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]]", "anti-[[plutocracy]]," or "anti-[[corporation|corporate]]." ''[[Le Monde Diplomatique]]'' 's editor, [[Ignacio Ramonet]]'s, expression of "the one-way thought" (''[[pensée unique]]'') became slang against [[neoliberal]] policies and the [[Washington consensus]].&lt;ref name="ramonet"&gt;{{cite news|title=La pensée unique |publisher=Le Monde Diplomatique |date=January 1995 |url=http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/1995/01/RAMONET/1144 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK21qVRY?url=http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/1995/01/RAMONET/1144 |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civic and Racial Nationalist opposition against globalization===

[[File:Donald Trump Victory Speech.webm|thumb|[[Donald Trump]] was elected President of the United States on November 8, 2016.]]

The term "anti-globalization" does not distinguish the international [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] anti-globalization position from a strictly nationalist anti-globalization position. Many nationalist movements, such as the [[France|French]] [[National Front (France)|National Front]], [[Freedom Party of Austria|Austrian Freedom Party]], the Italian [[Lega Nord]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Zaslove | first = Andrej | title = Exclusion, community, and a populist political economy: the radical right as an anti-globalization movement | journal = [[Comparative European Politics]] | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–189 | doi = 10.1057/palgrave.cep.6110126 | date = July 2008 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Greece|Greek]] [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/the-golden-dawn-a-love-of-power-and-a-hatred-of-difference-on-the-rise-in-the-cradle-of-democracy-8210724.html|title=The Golden Dawn: A love of power and a hatred of difference on the|date=14 October 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[National Democratic Party of Germany]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-g8-summit-protests-idUSL0720733520070607 | title=German police capsize protesters' boats at G8| newspaper=Reuters| date=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; are opposed to globalization, but argue that the alternative to globalization is the protection of the [[nation-state]]. Other groups, influenced by the [[Third Position]], are also classifiable as anti-globalization. However, their overall world view is rejected by groups such as [[Peoples Global Action]] and [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] groups such as [[Antifa (United States)|ANTIFA]]. In response, the nationalist movements against globalization, argue that the [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] anti-globalization position is actually a support to [[alter-globalization]].

===Influences===

[[File:Anti WEF graffiti Lausanne.jpg|thumb|Anti-[[World Economic Forum|WEF]] graffiti in [[Lausanne]]. The writing reads: ''La croissance est une folie'' ("Growth is madness").]]

Several influential critical works have inspired the anti-globalization movement. ''[[No Logo]]'', the book by the Canadian journalist [[Naomi Klein]] who criticized the production practices of multinational corporations and the omnipresence of brand-driven marketing in [[popular culture]], has become "manifesto"&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Gaby. "[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/nov/12/globalisation.politicsphilosophyandsociety Look, no brands...]", ''The Observer'', November 12, 2000. Retrieved on December 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; of the movement, presenting in a simple way themes more accurately developed in other works. In India some intellectual references of the movement can be found in the works of [[Vandana Shiva]], an ecologist and feminist, who in her book ''[[Biopiracy]]'' documents the way that the [[natural capital]] of [[indigenous peoples]] and [[ecoregions]] is converted into forms of [[intellectual capital]], which are then recognized as [[exclusive right|exclusive]] commercial property without sharing the private utility thus derived. The writer [[Arundhati Roy]] is famous for her anti-nuclear position and her activism against India's massive hydroelectric dam project, sponsored by the [[World Bank]]. In France the well-known monthly paper ''[[Le Monde Diplomatique]]'' has advocated the antiglobalization cause and an editorial of its director [[Ignacio Ramonet]] brought about the foundation of the association [[ATTAC]]. [[Susan George (political scientist)|Susan George]] of the Transnational Institute has also been a long-term influence on the movement, as the writer of books since 1986 on hunger, debt, international financial institutions and capitalism. The works of [[Jean Ziegler]], [[Christopher Chase-Dunn]], and [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] have detailed underdevelopment and dependence in a world ruled by the capitalist system. Pacifist and anti-imperialist traditions have strongly influenced the movement. Critics of [[United States foreign policy]] such as [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Susan Sontag]], and anti-globalist pranksters [[The Yes Men]] are widely accepted inside the movement.

Although they may not recognize themselves as antiglobalists and are pro-capitalism, some economists who don't share the neoliberal approach of international economic institutions have strongly influenced the movement. [[Amartya Sen]]'s ''Development as Freedom'' ([[The Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|Nobel Prize in Economics]], 1999), argues that third world development must be understood as the expansion of human capability, not simply the increase in national income per capita, and thus requires policies attuned to health and education, not simply GDP. [[James Tobin]]'s (winner of the [[The Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|Nobel Prize in Economics]]) proposal for a tax on financial transactions (called, after him, the [[Tobin tax]]) has become part of the agenda of the movement. Also, [[George Soros]], [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] (another Economic Sciences Nobel prize winner, formerly of the World Bank, author of [[Globalization and Its Discontents]]) and [[David Korten]] have made arguments for drastically improving [[transparency (humanities)|transparency]], for [[debt relief]], [[land reform]], and restructuring [[corporate accountability]] systems. Korten and Stiglitz's contribution to the movement include involvement in [[direct action]]s and street protest.

In some Roman Catholic countries such as [[Italy]] there have been religious influences, especially from missionaries who have spent a long time in the [[Third World]] (the most famous being [[Alex Zanotelli]]).

Internet sources and free-information websites, such as [[Indymedia]], are a means of diffusion of the movement's ideas. The vast array of material on spiritual movements, [[anarchism]], [[libertarian socialism]] and the [[Green politics|Green Movement]] that is now available on the Internet has been perhaps more influential than any printed book.

==Organization==
[[File:EdinburghProtests5.jpg|thumb|Anti-globalization protests in [[Edinburgh]] during the start of the [[31st G8 summit]].]]

Although over the past years more emphasis has been given to the construction of grassroots alternatives to (capitalist) globalization, the movement's largest and most visible mode of organizing remains mass decentralized campaigns of direct action and civil disobedience. &lt;!-- These often coincide with meetings of organizations they object to. It wasn't us, Guv? Speculation - activists form a spectrum of views --&gt; This mode of organizing, sometimes under the banner of the [[Peoples' Global Action]] network, tries to tie the many disparate causes together into one global struggle.
&lt;!-- In the process, it also helps to focus global attention both on the institutions of global capitalism (whose policies most movement members feel people would object to if they knew about them) as well as bring attention to the movement itself. Rewrite needed. --&gt;
In many ways the process of organizing matters overall can be more important to activists than the avowed goals or achievements of any component of the movement.

At corporate summits, the stated goal of most demonstrations is to stop the proceedings. Although the demonstrations rarely succeed in more than delaying or inconveniencing the actual summits, this motivates the mobilizations and gives them a visible, short-term purpose. This form of publicity is expensive in police time and the public purse. Rioting has occurred at some protests, for instance in Genoa, Seattle and London - and extensive damage was done to the area, especially targeting corporations, including [[McDonald's]] and [[Starbucks]] restaurants.

Despite, or perhaps because of, the lack of formal coordinating bodies, the movement manages to successfully organize large protests on a global basis, using [[information technology]] to spread information and organize. Protesters organize themselves into "[[affinity group]]s," typically non-hierarchical groups of people who live close together and share a common political goal. Affinity groups will then send representatives to planning meetings. However, because these groups can be infiltrated by law enforcement intelligence, important plans of the protests are often not made until the last minute. One common tactic of the protests is to split up based on willingness to break the law. This is designed, with varying success, to protect the risk-averse from the physical and legal dangers posed by confrontations with law enforcement. For example, in [[Prague]] during the [[Anti-globalization Protests in Prague|anti-IMF and World Bank protests in September 2000]] demonstrators split into three distinct groups, approaching the conference center from three directions: one engaging in various forms of civil disobedience (the Yellow march), one (the Pink/Silver march) advancing through "[[tactical frivolity]]" (costume, dance, theatre, music, and artwork), and one (the Blue march) engaging in violent conflicts with the baton-armed police, with the protesters throwing cobblestones lifted from the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vidal |first1=John |last2=Connolly |first2=Kate |url=https://www.theguardian.com/imf/story/0,7369,373703,00.html |title=Barricades burn in battle of Prague |publisher=Guardian |date=2000-09-27 |accessdate=2010-09-20 |location=London |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK23lvLX?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/imf/story/0%2C7369%2C373703%2C00.html |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Most police forces of developed nations do not have water cannons --&gt;
These demonstrations come to resemble small societies in themselves. Many protesters take training in first aid and act as medics to other injured protesters. In the US, some organizations like the [[National Lawyer's Guild]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], provide legal witnesses in case of law enforcement confrontation. Protesters often claim that major media outlets do not properly report on them; therefore, some of them created the [[Independent Media Center]], a collective of protesters reporting on the actions as they happen.

===Paris89===
A counter summit against G7 was organized in Paris in July 1989. The event was called "ça suffit comme ça" ("that is enough") and principally aimed at cancelling the debt contracted by southern countries. A demonstration gathered 10,000 people and an important concert was held in la Bastille square with 200 000 people. It was the first anti-G7 event, fourteen years before that of Washington. The main political consequence was that France took position to favor debt cancellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Japan and the G7/8: 1975-2002 | publisher=Routledge | author=Dobson, Hugo | pages=79–80 | isbn=978-0-415-64933-9| date=2013-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Madrid94===
The 50th anniversary of the IMF and the [[World Bank]], which was celebrated in [[Madrid]] in October 1994, was the scene of a protest by an ad-hoc coalition of what would later be called anti-globalization movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1994/1003/03041.html | title=IMF and World Bank 50th Birthday Bash: Critics Crash Party | journal=Christian Science Monitor | date=October 3, 1994 | accessdate=13 July 2013 | author=Francis, David R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from the mid-1990s, Annual Meetings of the IMF and the World Bank Group have become center points for anti-globalization movement protests. They tried to drown the bankers' parties in noise from outside and held other public forms of protest under the motto "50 Years is Enough". While Spanish [[King Juan Carlos]] was addressing the participants in a huge exhibition hall, two [[Greenpeace]] activists climbed to the top and showered the attendants with fake dollar bills carrying the slogan "No $s for [[Ozone Layer]] Destruction". A number of the demonstrators were sent to the notorious [[Carabanchel prison]].

===J18===&lt;!-- This section is linked from 1999 --&gt;
One of the first international anti-globalization protests was organized in dozens of cities around the world on June 18, 1999, with those in [[London]] and [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]], [[Oregon]] most often noted. The drive was called the [[Carnival Against Capital]], or [[Carnival Against Capital|J18]] for short. The day coincided with the 25th G8 Summit in Cologne, Germany. The protest in Eugene turned into a riot where local [[anarchist]]s drove police out of a small park. One anarchist, [[Robert Thaxton]], was arrested and convicted of throwing a rock at a [[police officer]].&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous, [http://www.daysofdissent.org.uk/j18.htm ''J18 1999 Our resistance is as transnational as capital''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301100633/http://www.daysofdissent.org.uk/j18.htm |date=2007-03-01 }}, ''Days of Dissent'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seattle/N30===
{{Main|World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity}}
The second major mobilization of the movement, known as N30, occurred on November 30, 1999, when protesters blocked delegates' entrance to WTO meetings in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[United States|USA]]. The protests forced the cancellation of the opening ceremonies and lasted the length of the meeting until December 3. There was a large, permitted march by members of the [[AFL-CIO]], and other unauthorized marches by assorted affinity groups who converged around the Convention Center.&lt;ref&gt;de Armond, Paul, ''Storming Seattle'' &amp; ''Netwar in the Emerald City: WTO Protest Strategy and Tactics''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillham, Patrick F. &amp; Marx, Gary T., 2000, ''Complexity and Irony in Policing and Protest: The World Trade Organization in Seattle''.&lt;/ref&gt; The protesters and Seattle riot police clashed in the streets after police fired [[tear gas]] at demonstrators who blocked the streets and refused to disperse. Over 600 protesters were arrested and thousands were injured.&lt;ref&gt;"Orpheus," ''Battle of Seattle'', part 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Three policemen were injured by [[friendly fire]], and one by a thrown rock. Some protesters destroyed the windows of storefronts of businesses owned or franchised by targeted corporations such as a large [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] shop and many [[Starbucks]] windows. The mayor put the city under the municipal equivalent of [[martial law]] and declared a [[curfew]]. {{as of|2002}}, the city of Seattle had paid over $200,000 in settlements of lawsuits filed against the [[Seattle Police Department]] for assault and wrongful arrest, with a class action lawsuit still pending.

===Law enforcement reaction===
Although local police were surprised by the size of N30, law enforcement agencies have since reacted worldwide to prevent the disruption of future events by a variety of tactics, including sheer weight of numbers, infiltrating the groups to determine their plans, and preparations for the use of force to remove protesters.

At the site of some of the protests, police have used tear gas, pepper spray, concussion grenades, rubber and wooden bullets, night sticks, water cannons, [[police dog|dogs]], and horses to repel the protesters. After the November 2000 [[G20]] protest in [[List of demonstrations against corporate globalization#2000|Montreal]], at which many protesters were beaten, trampled, and arrested in what was intended to be a festive protest, the tactic of dividing protests into "green" (permitted), "yellow" (not officially permitted but with little confrontation and low risk of arrest), and "red" (involving direct confrontation) zones was introduced.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

On June 15 and 16, 2001, a strong demonstration took place in [[Göteborg]] during the meeting of the European Council in the Swedish town. Clashes between police and protesters were exacerbated by the numerous vandalism of the extreme fringes of the demonstrators, the so-called [[black-bloc]]s. Images of devastation bounced through the mass media, putting a negative shadow on the movement, and increasing a sense of fear through common people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.de/umleitung/2002/deu03/107?lang=de&amp;mimetype=text/html&amp;destination=node%2F3006%3Fpage%3D1|title=Schweden - Amnesty International Deutschland|work=amnesty.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genoa===
{{Main|27th G8 summit#Protests}}
The [[Genoa Group of Eight Summit protest]] from July 18 to July 22, 2001 was one of the bloodiest protests in Western Europe's recent history, as evidenced by the wounding of hundreds of policemen and civilians forced to lock themselves inside of their homes and the death of a young Genoese [[anarchist]] named [[Carlo Giuliani]]—who was shot while trying to throw a fire extinguisher on a policeman—during two days of violence and rioting by groups supported by the nonchalance of more consistent and peaceful masses of protesters, and the hospitalization of several of those peaceful demonstrators just mentioned. Police have subsequently been accused of brutality, torture and interference with the non-violent protests as a collateral damage provoked by the clash between the law enforcement ranks themselves and the more violent and brutal fringes of protesters, who repeatedly hid themselves amongst peaceful protesters of all ages and backgrounds. Several hundred peaceful demonstrators, rioters, and police were injured and hundreds were arrested during the days surrounding the G8 meeting; most of those arrested have been charged with some form of "criminal association" under Italy's anti-[[mafia]] and anti-[[terrorism|terrorist]] laws.

===International social forums===
:{{main|Social forum|European Social Forum|Asian Social Forum|World Social Forum}}
The first [[World Social Forum]] (WSF) in 2001 was an initiative of {{ill|Oded Grajew|pt}}, [[Chico Whitaker]], and [[Bernard Cassen]]. It was supported by the city of [[Porto Alegre]] (where it took place) and the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Brazilian Worker's Party]]. The motivation was to constitute a counter-event to the [[World Economic Forum]] held in [[Davos]] at the same time. The slogan of the WSF is "Another World Is Possible". An ''International Council'' (IC) was set up to discuss and decide major issues regarding the WSF, while the local organizing committee in the host city is responsible for the practical preparations of the event.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/main.php?id_menu=3_2&amp;cd_language=2 International Council]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/main.php?id_menu=4_1&amp;cd_language=2 |title=Fórum Social Mundial |publisher=Forumsocialmundial.org.br |date=2005-10-26 |accessdate=2010-05-18 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK2Yzw4g?url=http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/main.php?id_menu=4_1&amp;cd_language=2 |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2001, the IC adopted the World Social Forum Charter of Principles, which provides a framework for international, national, and local Social Forums worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/main.php?id_menu=4&amp;cd_language=2 |title=World Social Forum Charter of Principles |publisher=Forumsocialmundial.org.br |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK2ZvbQY?url=http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/main.php?id_menu=4&amp;cd_language=2 |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WSF became a periodic meeting: in 2002 and 2003 it was held again in Porto Alegre and became a rallying point for worldwide protest against the American invasion of Iraq. In 2004 it was moved to [[Mumbai]], [[India]]), to make it more accessible to the populations of Asia and Africa. This Forum had 75,000 delegates. In 2006 it was held in three cities: [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]], [[Bamako]], [[Mali]], and [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]]. In 2007, the Forum was hosted in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], in 2009 it was in [[Belém]], Brazil, and in 2011 it was in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]]. In 2012, the WSF returned to Porto Alegre.

The idea of creating a meeting place for organizations and individuals opposed to [[Neoliberalism]] was soon replicated elsewhere. The first [[European Social Forum]] (ESF) was held in November 2002 in [[Florence]]. The slogan was "Against the war, against racism and against neo-liberalism". It saw the participation of 60,000 delegates and ended with a huge demonstration against the war (1,000,000 people according to the organizers). The following ESFs took place in [[Paris]] (2003), [[London]] (2004), [[Athens]] (2006), [[Malmö]] (2008), and the latest ESF in [[Istanbul]] (2010).

In many countries Social Forums of national and local scope were also held.

Recently there has been some discussion behind the movement about the role of the social forums. Some see them as a "popular university", an occasion to make many people aware of the problems of globalization. Others would prefer that delegates concentrate their efforts on the coordination and organization of the movement and on the planning of new campaigns. However it has often been argued that in the dominated countries (most of the world) the WSF is little more than an 'NGO fair' driven by Northern NGOs and donors most of which are hostile to popular movements of the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pambazuka.org/en/category/features/39464 |title=Pambazuka News |publisher=Pambazuka.org |date=2007-01-26 |accessdate=2010-09-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK2b4Eev?url=http://www.pambazuka.org/en/category/features/39464 |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North Korea ===
After the Second World War, North Korea followed a policy of  Anti-Globalization. However, in recent decades have shown a distinctive rise in globalization movements in North Korea. Under the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, Pyongyang(2002), introduced a number of reforms in areas such as technology and trade. The reform that had the most significance to North Korea was trade. North Korea saw a change in trading partnerships. They now not only traded with themselves but also with South Korea and China. North Korea introduced these reforms because they were lacking in areas of technology and trade and they realized that they could not maintain themselves as a society without help from other. But even with these new reforms North Korea still remains the most isolated society in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Chanlett-Avery and Nanto, Dick North Korea: Economic Leverage and Policy Analysis.Congressional Research Service ,2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
The anti-globalization movement has been criticized by politicians, members of [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[think tank]]s, and many mainstream [[economists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sofi.su.se/wp/WP06-7.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625032200/http://www.sofi.su.se/wp/WP06-7.pdf |date=June 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of evidence===
Critics assert that the empirical evidence does not support the views of the anti-globalization movement. These critics point to statistical trends which are interpreted to be results of globalization, capitalism, and the economic growth they encourage.
* There has been an absolute decrease in the percentage of people in developing countries living below $1 per day in east Asia (adjusted for inflation and purchasing power). Sub Saharan Africa, as an area that felt the consequences of poor governance and was less responsive to globalization, has seen an increase in poverty while all other areas of the world have seen no change in rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/jsp/index.jsp |title=Welcome to PovcalNet |publisher=Iresearch.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK2dxCfz?url=http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/jsp/index.jsp |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The increase in [[universal suffrage]], from no nations in 1900 to 62.5% of all nations in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=70&amp;release=74 |title=End of Century Survey Finds Dramatic Gains for Democracy |publisher=Freedomhouse.org |date=1999-12-07 |accessdate=2010-09-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK2edQkc?url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=70&amp;release=74 |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There are similar trends for electric power, cars, radios, and telephones per capita as well as the percentage of the population with access to clean water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VC6-4F02KWN-8&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=01%2F01%2F2005&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=full&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_cdi=5946&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;_artOutline=Y&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=273c9d354f2f52b3b14606a5a3b2d69f#bfn25 |title=Why Are We Worried About Income?

Members of the anti-globalization movement argue that positive data from countries which largely ignored neoliberal prescriptions, notably China, discredits the evidence that pro-globalists present. For example, concerning the parameter of per capita income growth, development economist [[Ha-Joon Chang]] writes that considering the record of the last two decades the argument for continuing neo-liberal policy prescriptions are "simply untenable." Noting that "It depends on the data we use, but roughly speaking, per capita income in developing countries grew at 3% per year between 1960 and 1980, but has grown only at about 1.5% between 1980 and 2000. And even this 1.5% will be reduced to 1%, if we take out India and China, which have not pursued liberal trade and industrial policies recommended by the developed countries."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpif.org/pdf/papers/SRtrade2003.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709044054/http://www.fpif.org/pdf/papers/SRtrade2003.pdf |date=July 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jagdish Bhagwati]] argues that reforms that opened up the economies of China and India contributed to their higher growth in 1980s and 1990s. From 1980 to 2000 their GDP grew at average rate of 10 and 6 percent respectively. This was accompanied by reduction of poverty from 28 percent in 1978 to 9 percent in 1998 in China, and from 51 percent in 1978 to 26 percent in 2000 in India.&lt;ref&gt;Jagdish N. Bhagwati. ''In Defense of Globalization.'' (2004). Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-517025-2}} p.65&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Joseph E. Stiglitz, speaking not only on China but East Asia in general, comments "The countries that have managed globalization...such as those in East Asia, have, by and large, ensured that they reaped huge benefits..."&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph E., "Globalism's Discontents," The American Prospect, 13, 1, January 2002, pp. 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[The Heritage Foundation]], development in China was anticipated by [[Milton Friedman]], who predicted that even a small progress towards economic liberalization would produce dramatic and positive effects. China's economy had grown together with its [[economic freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/Research/TradeandForeignAid/upload/wm_1375.pdf wm_1375.fm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626175616/http://www.heritage.org/Research/TradeandForeignAid/upload/wm_1375.pdf |date=June 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of corporate-led globalization have expressed concern about the methodology used in arriving at the World Bank's statistics and argue that more detailed variables measuring poverty should be studied.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.columbia.edu/~sr793/truth.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/trade_2004_11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Center for Economic and Policy Research]] (CEPR), the period from 1980–2005 has seen diminished progress in terms of economic growth, life expectancy, infant and child mortality, and to a lesser extent education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/development_2005_09.pdf |title=trade_2004_01_08-1 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK2mRYrK?url=http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/development_2005_09.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disorganization===
One of the most common criticisms of the movement, which does not necessarily come from its opponents, is simply that the anti-globalization movement lacks coherent goals, and that the views of different protesters are often in opposition to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Takis Fotopoulos, ''The Multidimensional Crisis and Inclusive Democracy'', ch. 4 ''[http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/fotopoulos/english/brbooks/multi_crisis_id/ch4.htm 'Globalisation' and the Left]''&lt;/ref&gt; Many members of the movement are also aware of this, and argue that, as long as they have a common opponent, they should march together - even if they don't share exactly the same political vision. Writers [[Michael Hardt]] &amp; [[Antonio Negri]] have together in their books (''Empire'' &amp;'' Multitude'') expanded on this idea of a disunified [[multitude]]: humans coming together for shared causes, but lacking the complete sameness of the notion of 'the people'.

===Lack of effectiveness===
One argument often made by the opponents of the anti-globalization movement (especially by ''[[The Economist]]''), is that one of the major causes of poverty amongst third-world farmers are the trade barriers put up by rich nations and poor nations alike. The [[WTO]] is an organization set up to work towards removing those trade barriers. Therefore, it is argued, people really concerned about the plight of the third world should actually be encouraging free trade, rather than attempting to fight it. Specifically, commodities such as sugar are heavily distorted by subsidies on behalf of powerful economies (the United States, Europe, and Japan), who have a disproportionate influence in the WTO. As a result, producers in these countries often receive 2-3x the world market price. As Amani Elobeid and John Beghin note, the world price might decline by as much as 48% (by 2011 / 2012 baselines) were these distortions to be removed&lt;ref&gt;Elobeid, Amani; Beghin, John. "Multilateral Trade and Agricultural Policy Reforms in Sugar Markets", Journal of Agricultural Economics, 57, 1, 23-48, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many supporters of globalization think that policies different from those of today should be pursued, although not necessarily those advocated by the anti-globalization movement. For example, some see the World Bank and the IMF as corrupt bureaucracies which have given repeated loans to dictators who never do any reforms. Some, like [[Hernando de Soto (economist)|Hernando De Soto]], argue that much of the poverty in the Third World countries is caused by the lack of Western systems of laws and well-defined and universally recognized [[property rights]]. De Soto argues that because of the legal barriers poor people in those countries can not utilize their assets to produce more wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Hernando De Soto. ''The Mystery of Capital''. Basic Books. (2003). {{ISBN|978-0-465-01615-0}} p.210-211&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of widespread "Third World" support===
Critics have asserted that people from poor (the [[Developing country|Developing countries]]) have been relatively accepting and supportive of globalization while the strongest opposition to globalization has come from wealthy "[[First World]]" activists, unions and NGOs. Alan Shipman, author of "The Globalization Myth" accuses the anti-globalization movement of "defusing the Western class war by shifting alienation and exploitation to developing-country sweatshops." He later goes on to claim that the anti-globalization movement has failed to attract widespread support from poor and working people from the developing nations, and that its "strongest and most uncomprehending critics had always been the workers whose liberation from employment they were trying to secure."&lt;ref&gt;Shipman, Alan "The Globalization Myth" Icon Books, 2002, p. 12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

These critics assert that people from the Third World see the anti-globalization movement as a threat to their jobs, wages, consuming options and livelihoods, and that a cessation or reversal of globalization would result in many people in poor countries being left in greater poverty. [[Jesús F. Reyes Heroles]] the former Mexican Ambassador to the US, stated that "in a poor country like ours, the alternative to low-paid jobs isn't well-paid ones, it's no jobs at all."&lt;ref&gt;Johan Norberg. ''In Defense of Global Capitalism''. {{ISBN|978-1-930865-47-1}} p.194&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt's Ambassador to the UN has also stated "The question is why all of a sudden, when third world labor has proved to be competitive, why do industrial countries start feeling concerned about our workers? When all of a sudden there is a concern about the welfare of our workers, it is suspicious."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Veseth, [[Louis Uchitelle]]. ''The Rise of the Global Economy''. {{ISBN|978-1-57958-369-9}} p. 558&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there have been notable protests against certain globalization policies by workers in developing nations as in the cause of Indian farmers protesting against patenting seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twnside.org.sg/title/pro-ch.htm |title=Indian farmers protest against pro-liberalization agricultural policy |publisher=Twnside.org.sg |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK2o10S7?url=http://www.twnside.org.sg/title/pro-ch.htm |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last few years, many developing countries (esp. in Latin America and Caribbean) created alter-globalization organizations as economic blocs [[Mercosur]] and [[Union of South American Nations|Unasur]], political community [[Community of Latin American and Caribbean States|CELAC]] or [[Bank of the South]] which are supporting development of low income countries without involvement from [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] or [[World Bank]].

'''Arif Ali Durrani''' (born c. 1949 in [[Pakistan]]) is a Pakistani businessman who has twice been convicted by US courts of selling arms to Iran.

==Background==
Durrani was the son of a [[Pakistani Army]] officer with responsibility for military procurement. Durrani moved to the United States in 1973, settling in [[California]].&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 3 October 1998, [http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/03/local/me-28832 Inquiry Aims at Convicted Arms Dealer]&lt;/ref&gt; He gained an [[MBA]] from the [[University of Southern California]].&lt;ref name=AP&gt;[[Associated Press]], 12 December 1986, [http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1986/Documents-Reveal-Arms-Dealer-Lived-The-Good-Life/id-a66ce4f983f8c400f12d0419bf600d95 Documents Reveal Arms Dealer Lived The Good Life]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In February 1984 Durrani formed a company, Merex Corp, which traded in parts for military and commercial aircraft, and by his own account reached sales of $16m in 1986.&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt;&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; He was arrested in October 1986 and subsequently convicted of trading [[Hawk missile]] parts to Iran, in what Durrani maintained were actions authorised by leading US government figures (specifically, [[Oliver North]]) as part of the [[Iran-Contra affair]] with the specific aim of his shipment leading to the freeing of US hostages held in Lebanon.&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;''[[New York Times]]'', 4 December 1987, [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/04/world/court-rejects-appeal-of-pakistani-who-cited-north-in-arms-deals.html Court Rejects Appeal of Pakistani Who Cited North in Arms Deals]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press]], 5 February 1987, [http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1987/Pakistani-Arms-Dealer-Claims-He-Worked-To-Free-Hostages/id-7cd65fec1890a412fb29580b265870a2 Pakistani Arms Dealer Claims He Worked To Free Hostages]&lt;/ref&gt; In denying Durrani bail, the judge described him as "enjoy[ing] an exorbitant lifestyle replete with material luxuries and one which causes him to travel the globe to meet with his business associates."&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; Durrani was sentenced to 10 years (and a $2m fine), and released after five years, in September 1992.&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyn Bixby, ''[[Hartford Courant]]'', 28 October 1992, [http://articles.courant.com/1992-10-28/news/0000110653_1_foreigner-engine-parts-prison-term/3 Life In The Fast Lane, Then Slow Years In Jail]&lt;/ref&gt; Durrani said that many of his deals were financed via [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International]].&lt;ref&gt;''TIME'', 24 June 2001, [http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,157768,00.html Scandals: Not Just a Bank]&lt;/ref&gt; Durrani continued to protest his innocence after his release, arguing that he was working on transactions approved by the US and Israeli governments.&lt;ref&gt;Alan A.

==History==

=== Early history ===
In 1922, three men—William Baird, Wade Kurtz and Claire Dobson—decided to start their own firm with offices in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] and [[Joplin, Missouri]], after the disbandment of the Montgomery Firm, where the three had been employed. On January 2, 1923, the men took the $1,700 they had in the bank and opened their business:  Baird, Kurtz &amp; Dobson.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|title=A History of Unmatched Client Service  |url=http://www.bkd.com/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the firm looked to expand to [[St. Louis]] and [[Chicago]], but the 1929 stock market crash and subsequent [[Great Depression]] curtailed growth, forcing the firm to build its clientele and reputation in Kansas City and Joplin.

After [[World War II]], a growth period began. A third office opened in [[Springfield, Missouri]], in July 1948, and a uranium boom led the firm to purchase a tax practice in [[Grand Junction, Colorado]].

The 1960s represented a period of significant change. In 1964, the firm drafted its formal partnership agreement, which still exists today. The passage of the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] Act in 1965 led the firm to focus on growing its health care practice, which today constitutes the firm’s largest industry focus.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Expansion continued throughout the 1970s and 1980s, with the firm opening new offices in [[Arkansas]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Missouri]], [[Texas]], [[Nebraska]] and [[Kentucky]].

=== Recent history ===
Since that time, steady growth has continued. The firm created its first wholly owned subsidiary, BKD Corporate Finance, LLC, in 1994 and passed the $100 million revenue mark in 1999. The firm created its charitable arm, the BKD Foundation, in 2000; since making its first charitable gift in February 2000, the foundation has given more than $9 million to qualifying 501(c)(3) organization.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guidestar.org/profile/43-1866948|title=Bkd Foundation - GuideStar Profile|website=www.guidestar.org|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, BKD has been known to play an active role in the charities "Fighting Hunger... Feeding Hope." and the Ronald McDonald House.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=The Dolan Media Holding Company, a Delaware corporation|first=|year=2016|title=Beacon Profile: BKD CPAs and Advisors|url=|journal=Journal Record|volume=|pages=|via=General Reference Center Gold}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm undertook its largest merger in 2001, combining with Olive LLP to create BKD, LLP, which was the eighth-largest U.S. accounting firm at the time. That year also marked a name change for BKD Investment Advisors, founded in 1998, to BKD Wealth Advisors, LLC.

On October 1, 2013 BKD officially acquired Malin Bergquist &amp; Co, LLP, a firm that was previously based in Erie, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accountingtoday.com/news/BKD-Acquires-Malin-Bergquist-Co-68017-1.html|title=BKD Acquires Malin Bergquist &amp; Co.|last=Cody|first=Tamika|date=|website=Accounting Today News|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 1, 2014, Wolf &amp; Company officially became a part of BKD through the result of a merger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.accountingtoday.com/news/mergers-acquisitions/bkd-and-wolf-company-to-merge-72131-1.html|title=BKD and Wolf &amp; Company to Merge|last=Cody|first=Tamra|date=29 September 2014|work=|access-date=16 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, BKD launched women's initiatives, sales training that spanned the entire firm, and a national enterprise risk solutions practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hood|first=Daniel|year=2015|title=2015 Firm Highlights|url=http://cdn.accountingtoday.com/pdfs/accountingtoday_Top100Firms_0415.pdf|journal=Accounting Today (Supplement)|volume=|pages=28|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the firm claims 34 offices in 15 states, including Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Texas, making it one of the largest accounting firms in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accountingedu.org/bkd.html|title=BKD CPAs &amp; Advisors|website=www.accountingedu.org|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BKD is a member of the Praxity alliance, an association of global, independent accountancy, tax, business, and consulting firms. BKD is the largest member of the Praxity group from the United States. The firm's affiliation with Praxity enables interaction with international clients, as well as provides global support and resources .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.praxity.com/about-us/Pages/About-Us.aspx|title=Praxity|website=www.praxity.com|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, BKD was named 13th on the list of the Top 100 Firms published by Accounting Today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hood|first=Daniel|year=2015|title=The 2015 Accounting Today Top 100 Firms|url=http://cdn.accountingtoday.com/pdfs/accountingtoday_Top100Firms_0415.pdf|journal=Accounting Today (Supplement)|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Accounting Today also ranked BKD as the #1 firm in the Midwest Region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hood|first=Daniel|year=2015|title=New names, more M&amp;A lead to strong regional growth|url=http://cdn.accountingtoday.com/pdfs/accountingtoday_Top100Firms_0415.pdf|journal=Accounting Today (Supplement)|volume=|pages=20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bird City''' is a private [[wildfowl]] [[wildlife refuge|refuge]] or [[Animal sanctuary|bird sanctuary]] located on [[Avery Island]] in coastal [[Iberia Parish]], [[Louisiana]].

It was founded by [[Tabasco sauce]] heir and [[conservation movement|conservationist]] [[Edward Avery McIlhenny]], whose family owned Avery Island.  McIlhenny established the refuge around 1895 on his own personal tract of the {{convert|2200|acre|km2|sing=on}} island, an approximately {{convert|175|acre|km2|sing=on}} [[Estate (house)|estate]] known eventually as [[Jungle Gardens]] because of its lush tropical [[flora]].

By the late 19th century, [[Plume hunting|plume hunter]]s had nearly wiped out the [[snowy egret]] population of the [[United States]] in pursuit of the [[bird]]'s delicate [[feathers]], which were commonly used by [[Hatmaking|milliners]] for the adornment of ladies' [[hat]]s.

Alarmed by this trend, McIlhenny searched the [[Gulf Coast]] and located several surviving egrets, which he took back to his estate on Avery Island.  There he turned the birds loose in a type of [[aviary]] he called a "flying cage," where the birds soon adapted to their new surroundings.  In the fall McIlhenny set the birds loose to [[bird migration|migrate]] south for the winter.

As he hoped, the birds returned to Avery Island in the spring, bringing with them even more snowy egrets.  This pattern continued until, by 1911, the refuge served as the summer [[nest]]ing ground for an estimated 100,000 egrets.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Avery McIlhenny, ''Bird City'' (Boston: Christopher Publishing House, 1935), passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its early founding and example to others, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], father of American [[conservationism]], once referred to Bird City as "the most noteworthy reserve in the country."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/57/10.html Theodore, Roosevelt, "Bird Reserves at the Mouth of the Mississippi River," A Book-Lover’s Holidays in the Open (1916), n.p.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, snowy egrets continue to return to Bird City each spring to nest until resuming their migration in the fall.

'''''Black Gold''''' (also known as ''Oil Imperium'') is a [[video game]] of the [[strategy game|strategy]] genre released in 1989 by [[reLINE Software]].

==Summary==
The goal of the game is to promote and sell oil and defeat competitors using a number of fair and unfair strategies. A game move always takes a month, and each action in the game costs one or more days.

The game is designed for four players, either human (using a hot seat method) or computer-controlled. Players take on the management of one of four corporations: "Interoil", "All American", "Transoil" or "Explora Inc."

There are four different game objectives to choose from: to play a three-year game, to survive the longest of all the game companies, to receive an 80% market share or to reach 60 million dollars. There are some game mechanic variations between the missions. For example, when playing to the first 60 million dollars, drilling a borehole takes longer than in the other missions.

There are eight oil-producing regions to choose from where players must acquire licenses, tankers and oil fields: Alaska, North America, Central America, South America, Europe, USSR, the Gulf region and Indochina.

The player can request an expert opinion of an oil field's probable yield before purchase. Once a field has been bought, the player may drill manually or pay game money for automatic drilling. Enemies in the game can disrupt play using sabotage. This can be done by igniting the oil fields, destroying tankers, manipulating balance sheets, etc. To protect against such moves, a player can hire a security company.

In the course of the game there are three action sequences. Oil sales can lead to delays, and the player must manually lay pipeline. Manual drilling requires the player to correct the deviation of the drill head. Finally, burning oil wells must be deleted using dynamite. The latter can be carried out by a specialist called "Ted Redhair" (inspired by the famous [[Red Adair]]).

{{Contract law}}
'''Breach of contract''' is a [[legal]] [[cause of action]] and a type of [[civil wrong]], in which a [[binding agreement]] or bargained-for exchange is not honored by one or more of the parties to the contract by non-performance or interference with the other party's performance. Breach occurs when a party to a contract fails to fulfill his or her obligation as described in the contract, or communicates an intent to fail the obligation or otherwise appears not to be able to perform his or her obligation under the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breach of Contract|url=http://thelawdictionary.org/breach-of-contract/|website=The Law Dictionary|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minor breaches==
In a "minor" breach (a partial breach or immaterial breach or where there has been substantial performance), the non-breaching party cannot sue for [[specific performance]], and can only sue for actual [[damages]].

Suppose a homeowner hires a contractor to install new plumbing and insists that the pipes, which will ultimately be hidden behind the walls, must be red. The contractor instead uses blue pipes that function just as well. Although the contractor breached the literal terms of the [[contract]], the homeowner cannot ask a court to order the contractor to replace the blue pipes with red pipes. The homeowner can only recover the amount of his or her actual damages. In this instance, this is the difference in value between red pipe and blue pipe. Since the color of a pipe does not affect its function, the difference in value is zero. Therefore, no damages have been incurred and the homeowner would receive nothing (see ''[[Jacob &amp; Youngs v. Kent]]''.)

However, had the pipe colour been specified in the agreement as a ''[[covenant (law)|condition]]'', a breach of that condition would constitute a "major" breach. For example, when a contract specifies [[time is of the essence]] and one party to the contract fails to meet a contractual obligation in a timely fashion, the other party could sue for damages for a major breach.

==Material breach==
A ''material breach'' is any failure to perform that permits the other party to the contract to either compel performance, or collect damages because of the breach. A breach of contract will constitute a material breach if the term of the contract that has been breached is a '''condition'''. A term is a condition if it satisfies the test of essentiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWStRp|37|1938|litigants=Tramways Advertising Pty Ltd v Luna Park |parallelcite=(1938) 38 [[State Reports New South Wales|SR (NSW)]] 632 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The test of essentiality requires that the promise (term) was of such importance to the promisee that he or she would not have entered into the contract unless he had been assured of strict or substantial performance of the promise and this ought to have been apparent to the promisor. This is an objective test of the parties' intention at the time of formation of the contract. 

If the contractor in the above example had been instructed to use copper pipes, and instead used iron pipes that would not last as long as the copper pipes would have lasted, the homeowner can recover the cost of actually correcting the breach – taking out the iron pipes and replacing them with copper pipes.

There are exceptions to this. Legal scholars and courts often state that the owner of a house whose pipes are not the specified grade or quality (a typical hypothetical example) cannot recover the cost of replacing the pipes for the following reasons:

# '''Economic waste'''. The law does not favor tearing down or destroying something that is valuable (almost anything with value is "valuable"). In this case, significant destruction of the house would be required to completely replace the pipes, and so the law is hesitant to enforce damages of that nature. See ''[[Peevyhouse v. Garland Coal &amp; Mining Co.]]''.
# '''Pricing in'''. In most cases of breach, a party to the contract simply fails to perform one or more terms. In those cases, the breaching party should have already considered the cost to perform those terms and thus "keeps" that cost when they do not perform. That party should not be entitled to keep those savings. However, in the pipe example the contractor never considered the cost of tearing down a house to fix the pipes, and so it is not reasonable to expect them to pay damages of that nature.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Most homeowners would be unable to collect damages that compensate them for replacing the pipes, but rather would be awarded damages that compensate them for the ''loss of value'' in the house. For example, say the house is worth $125,000 with copper and $120,000 with iron pipes. The homeowner would be able to collect the $5,000 difference, and nothing more.


In the United States, the [[Restatement (Second) of Contracts]] lists the following criteria to determine whether a specific failure constitutes a material breach:&lt;ref&gt;[[American Law Institute]], Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 241 (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In determining whether a failure to render or to offer performance is material, the following circumstances are significant:

:(a) the extent to which the injured party will be deprived of the benefit which he reasonably expected;
:(b) the extent to which the injured party can be adequately [[payment|compensated]] for the part of that benefit of which he will be deprived;
:(c) the extent to which the party failing to perform or to offer to perform will suffer forfeiture;
:(d) the likelihood that the party failing to perform or to offer to perform will cure his failure, taking account of all the circumstances including any reasonable assurances;
:(e) the extent to which the behavior of the party failing to perform or to offer to perform comports with standards of good faith and fair dealing.}}

==Fundamental breach==
A ''[[fundamental breach]]'' (or ''repudiatory breach'') is a breach so fundamental that it permits the aggrieved party to terminate performance of the contract. In addition, that party is entitled to [[lawsuit|sue]] for damages.

==Anticipatory breach==
A ''breach by [[anticipatory repudiation]]'' (or simply ''anticipatory breach'') is an unequivocal indication that the party will not perform when performance is due, or a situation in which future non-performance is inevitable. An anticipatory breach gives the non-breaching party the option to treat such a breach as immediate, and, if repudiatory, to terminate the contract and sue for damages (without waiting for the breach to actually take place).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|14|1985|litigants=Progressive Mailing House v Tabali Pty Ltd |parallelcite=(1985) 157 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 17 at p. 48 |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|51|1989|litigants=Foran v Wight |parallelcite=(1989) 168 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 385 at pp 416, 441-2 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, A contracts with B on January 1 to sell 500 quintals of wheat and to deliver it on May 1. Subsequently, on April 15, A writes to B and says that he will not deliver the wheat. B may immediately consider the breach to have occurred and file a suit for damages for the scheduled performance, even though A has until May 1 to perform. However, a unique feature of anticipatory breach is that if an aggrieved party chooses not to accept a repudiation occurring before the time set for performance, not only will the contract continue on foot, but also there will be no right to damages unless and until an actual breach occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paterson|first1=Jeannie|last2=Robertson|first2=Andrew|last3=Duke|first3=Arlen|title=Principles of Contract Law|date=2012|publisher=Thomson Reuters (Professional) Australia Limited|location=Sydney|page=440|edition=Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--  Rm as there are four major links --&gt;[[File:Chimney sweep's cancer Wellcome L0062113.jpg|alt=A large wart on the scrotum covered with a thick, dry, black scab.|thumb|Watercolour drawing of a case of chimney sweep's cancer. Drawn by Horace Benge Dobell, physician, whilst a student at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College|St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical School.]]]]
'''Chimney sweep's cancer''', also called '''soot wart''', is a [[squamous cell carcinoma]] of the skin of the [[scrotum]]. It has the distinction of being the first reported form of [[occupational disease|occupational cancer]], and was initially identified by [[Percivall Pott]] in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;General Surgery Lecture notes, H.Ellis, Wiley Blackwell, 12th edition&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially noticed as being prevalent amongst [[chimney sweep]]s.

==Pathogenesis==
Chimney sweeps' carcinoma is a [[squamous cell carcinoma]] of the skin of the [[scrotum]]. [[Wart]]s caused by the irritation from soot particles, if not excised, developed into a scrotal cancer. This then invaded the [[dartos]], enlarged the [[testicle]], and proceeded up the [[spermatic cord]] into the [[abdomen]] where it proved fatal.

==History==
Chimney sweeps' carcinoma was first described by [[Percivall Pott]] in 1775 who postulated that the cancer was associated with [[occupational exposure]] to soot.&lt;ref name="RSC"&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Dronsfield |first= Alan |date= 1 March 2006 |title= Percivall Pott, chimney sweeps and cancer |url= https://eic.rsc.org/feature/percivall-pott-chimney-sweeps-and-cancer/2020205.article |magazine= [[Education in Chemistry]] |volume= 43 |issue= 2 |pages= 40–42, 48 |publisher= [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] |access-date= 19 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cancer primarily affected chimney sweeps who had been in contact with soot since their early childhood. The median age of onset of symptoms in one review was 37.7 years, although boys as young as 8 years old were found to have the disease.&lt;ref name="Waldron"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Waldron|first1=H. A.|title=A brief history of scrotal cancer.|journal=British Journal of Industrial Medicine|date=1 November 1983|volume=40|issue=4|pages=390–401|doi=10.1136/oem.40.4.390|url=http://oem.bmj.com/content/40/4/390|accessdate=11 December 2016|language=en|issn=1470-7926|pmc=1009212}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was proposed by W.G. Spencer in 1890 that sweat running down their bodies had caused soot to accumulate in the [[rugae]] of the inferior surfaces of the scrotum, with the resulting chronic irritation causing scrotal cancer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spencer|first1=WG|title=Soot in cells of chimney-sweepers' cancer.|journal=Medico-Chirurgical Transactions|date=1890|volume=1|issue=74|pages=59–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this was shown to be an incorrect artifact of the method used to stain his microscope slides.&lt;ref name="Waldron"/&gt;

In 1922, R.D. Passey, a research physician at [[Guy's Hospital]] in London produced malignant skin tumors in mice exposed to an extract made from soot, demonstrating the presence of carcinogenic substances in soot which were the likely cause of cancer of the scrotum in chimney sweeps.&lt;ref name="Waldron"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Passey"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Passey|first1=R. D.|title=Experimental Soot Cancer|journal=The British Medical Journal|date=1 January 1922|volume=2|issue=3232|pages=1112–1113|jstor=20421879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

in the 1930s [[Ernest Kennaway]] and James D. Cook of the Research Institute of the Cancer Hospital, London, (later known as the [[Royal Marsden]] Hospital) discovered several [[polycyclic hydrocarbon]]s present in soot that were potent [[carcinogens]]: 1,2,5,6-dibenzanthracene; 1,2,7,8-dibenzanthracene; and 1,2-benzpyrene (3) benzo[α]pyrene. [[DNA]] consists of sequences of four bases – [[adenine]], [[thymine]], [[cytosine]] and [[guanine]] – bound to a [[deoxyribonucleic]] backbone. Benzo[α]pyrene interacts with [[deoxyguanosine]] of the DNA, damaging it and potentially starting the processes that can lead to cancer.&lt;ref name="RSC"/&gt;

===Social context===
The disease was principally a British phenomenon; in Germany, for example, sweeps wore tight-fitting protective clothing{{sfn|Waldron|1983|p=393}} which prevented the soot from accumulating on the lower surface of the scrotum, whereas boys in the UK were once sent up the chimneys wearing only trousers and shirt, and occasionally naked.{{sfn|Waldron|1983|p=390}} 
In the United Kingdom before the flexible brush was introduced, the master sweeps took apprentices, who were boys from the [[workhouse]] or bought them from their parents and trained them to climb chimneys. In the [[States of the German Confederation|German States]], master sweeps belonged to [[trade guild]]s{{sfn|Strange|1982|p=40}} and did not use climbing boys. In Italy, Belgium, and France climbing boys were used. Boys as young as four climbed hot [[flue]]s that could be as narrow as 230&amp;nbsp;mm square. Work was dangerous and they could get jammed in the flue, suffocate or burn to death. The boys slept under the soot sacks and were rarely washed.  From 1775 onwards there was increasing concern for the welfare of the boys, and [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]] were passed to restrict, and in 1875 to stop this usage.{{sfn|Strange|1982|p=80}} [[Lord Shaftesbury]], a [[philanthropist]], led the later campaign. In the United States, black children were hired from their owners and used in the same way, and were still climbing after 1875.{{sfn|Strange|1982|p=93}}

===Sir Percivall Pott===
[[Sir Percivall Pott]] (6 January 1714 – 22 December 1788)  London, England) was an English [[surgery|surgeon]], one of the founders of [[orthopedy]], and the first scientist to demonstrate that a cancer may be caused by an environmental [[carcinogen]].
In 1765 he was elected Master of the Company of Surgeons, the forerunner of the [[Royal College of Surgeons]]. It was in 1775 that Pott found an association between exposure to [[soot]] and a high incidence of chimney sweeps' carcinoma, a scrotal cancer (later found to be [[squamous cell carcinoma]]) in [[chimney sweep]]s. This was the first [[occupational disease|occupational]] link to cancer, and Pott was the first person to demonstrate that a malignancy could be caused by an environmental [[carcinogen]]. Pott's early investigations contributed to the science of [[epidemiology]] and the [[Chimney Sweepers Act 1788]].{{sfn|Gordon|1994|p=128}}

Pott describes chimney sweeps' carcinoma thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is a disease which always makes it first attack on the inferior part of the [[scrotum]] where it produces a superficial, painful ragged ill-looking sore with hard rising edges.....in no great length of time it pervades the skin, [[dartos]] and the membranes of the scrotum, and seizes the [[testicle]], which it inlarges,{{sic}} hardens and renders truly and thoroughly distempered. Whence it makes its way up the [[Spermatic cord|spermatic process]] into the [[abdomen]].{{sfn|Waldron|1983|p=391}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He comments on the life of the boys:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The fate of these people seems peculiarly hard ... they are treated with great brutality ... they are thrust up narrow and sometimes hot chimnies,{{sic|nolink=y}} where they are bruised burned and almost suffocated; and when they get to [[puberty]] they become ... liable to a most noisome, painful and fatal disease.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The carcinogen was thought to be [[coal tar]], possibly containing some [[arsenic]].{{sfn|Waldron|1983|p=390}}{{sfn|Schwartz|2008|p=55}}

Though Pott wrote no further papers on the subject, clinical reports began to appear suggesting that others had seen it without realising what it was and like Pott had said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[as it occurs after puberty]....it is generally taken, both by patient and surgeon  for venereal and treated with mercurial [salts].{{sfn|Waldron|1983|p=391}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The disease was usually preceded by the development of hyperkeratotic [[lesion]]s on the scrotum, which was what the sweeps called soot warts.{{sfn|Waldron|1983|p=392}} These could be benign; sweeps often removed them themselves by trapping them in a split cane and cutting them off with a pocket knife. For instance:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"he... seized with a split stick and cut off with a razor. He remarked that it was not very painful. He resumed work the following day."{{sfn|Waldron|1983|p=392}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But if the lesion had become malignant it was far more serious. Patients frequently delayed seeking medical opinion, and when they did many were in a dreadful state. A 28-year-old sweep approached Jefferies in 1825, who describes his condition:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The sore occupies the whole of the left side of the [[scrotum]] and the inner angle of the [[thigh]], extending from the [[anus]] to the [[posterior inferior spinous process]] of the [[ileum]], presenting a surface as large as a man's open hand, with hard indurated edges and irregular margins, discharging a thin [[sanies]], which is extremely offensive; the left [[testicle]] is entirely denuded, and projects from its centre; in the left [[groin]] is a mass of [[indurated glands]], the size of a goose's egg, which appears to suppurate in the right groin: there is likewise an [[Genital ulcer|ulceration]], of the same [[malignant]] nature, about the size of a [[Half crown (British coin)|half-crown]]  (5 cm)..."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Despite the appearance of this growth, the man was in no pain and his only complaint was that about 10 days before his admission he had bled from his groin and lost about a pint of blood. Even this, however, had not unduly affected his constitution.{{sfn|Waldron|1983|p=392}}

===Treatment===
Treatment was by surgery, where all the diseased flesh was cut out. Before the introduction of [[anaesthetic]]s this was a simple process for the surgeon but terrifying for the patient. Alternative treatments were also proposed including the application of an [[arsenic]] paste poultice. The real cause of this cancer was unproved until the discovery of weak carcinogens in soot by Passley in 1922.{{sfn|Waldron|1983|p=393}}  Until then the most popular theory was that soot got trapped in the [[rugae]] of the scrotum and this caused a general irritation. Sweeps were not known for their attention to bodily hygiene and it was assumed they never washed their genitals. The youngest victim, recorded in 1790 by James Earle (Pott's son-in-law), was 8 years old.{{sfn|Waldron|1983|p=391}}

==Related diseases==
Decades later, it was noticed to occur amongst gas plant and [[oil shale]] workers, and it was later found that certain constituents of tar, soot, and oils, known as [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]], were found to cause cancer in laboratory animals. The related cancer, [[mule spinners' cancer|mule spinners' carcinoma]], was blamed on the carcinogenic content of [[shale oil]] that was used to lubricate the rapidly revolving [[Spinning mule|mule spindles]].

The '''''College National Fed Challenge''''' competition is an academic competition similar to the [[National Fed Challenge]] high school competition.  The College Fed Challenge is a yearly team competition for undergraduate college students inspired by the working of the [[Federal Open Market Committee]]. The competition is intended to encourage students to learn more about the U.S. macro economy, the [[Federal Reserve System]] and the implementation of monetary policy. The College Fed Challenge also aims at promoting interest in economics and finance as subjects for advanced study and as the basis for a career.&lt;ref name="ramapo"&gt;“Ramapo College of New Jersey EEA:Fed Challenge 2010 Competition,” Ramapo.edu, 8 November 2010, [http://www.ramapo.edu/eea/challenge/index.html.]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==

'''College Fed Challenge Mission'''

	- The College Federal Reserve Challenge of the Federal Reserve System is a yearly academic competition sponsored by several reserve banks and is administered by the Eastern Economic Association. The College Federal Reserve Challenge consists of teams of three to five students from nearby colleges and universities.  Each team is responsible for creating a presentation 20 minutes in length to be delivered in front of a panel of judges consisting of academics and professional economists.  Concluding the presentation, a 15-minute question and answer session ensues between the collegiate group and the panel. By advancing through three rounds of local competition, successful teams win recognition, with the first place team continuing to [[Washington, D.C.]] to compete against other regional winners at the Board of Governors.&lt;ref name="ramapo"/&gt;
In addition to the educational benefits and confidence arising through rigorous competition, students benefit from opportunities to apply their economic experiences in the real world.  These skills learned can be applied to acquire internships, discover potential career paths, and hone skills of public speaking, logical thinking, writing, and analysis. Instructors of undergraduate institutions benefit through the use of a venue to develop enthusiasm for the study of economics and to integrate their curriculum with an active learning experience.&lt;ref name="ramapo"/&gt;

'''Goals'''
	
* To develop an understanding of the components of a modern economy and their long-term contribution to economic growth and development, while appreciating the short-run fluctuations which lead to business cycle activity.
* To comprehend the role of the Federal Reserve System in creating monetary policy designed to promote economic stabilization in furtherance of achieving the dual mandate of price level stability and maximum employment while assuring moderate long-term interest rates and financial system stability.
* To understand the short-run and long-run interactions of monetary policy with regard to unemployment, inflation, economic growth, fiscal policy, and exchange rate stability.
* To promote an understanding of current political and economic issues which impact on overall economic and financial system activity.
* To increase students' awareness and understanding of the unique role of the Federal Reserve in the economy.
* To develop students' research, cooperation, presentation, and critical thinking skills.&lt;ref name="ramapo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;“The College Fed Challenge Handbook,” The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, 30 May 2007, {{cite web |url=http://www.richmondfed.org/education/for_teachers/academic_competitions/college_fed_challenge/participants_resources/pdf/handbook.pdf. |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609181213/http://www.richmondfed.org/education/for_teachers/academic_competitions/college_fed_challenge/participants_resources/pdf/handbook.pdf. |archivedate=2012-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==

	Teams of 3–5 students present current macroeconomic and financial information to a panel compiled of professional economists, bankers, financial analysts, and academics.  Each team is afforded 15 minutes to analyze and present various macroeconomic theories which if implemented, could lead to economic prosperity.  At the end of the 15-minute presentation the team must formulate a monetary plan for the Federal Reserve Bank to implement.  A 15-minute question and answer session involving the presenting team and the panel follows the 15-minute presentation.  Panel members quiz the students on current events, economic definitions, and macroeconomic policy during the 15-minute session.&lt;ref name="ramapo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="harvardfc"&gt;[http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~fed/college.html “Harvard College Fed Challenge,” hcs.harvard.edu, 8 November 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
	Teams compete in two rounds at the regional competition which takes place at a nearby Federal Reserve Bank.  Winners of the regional competition advance to the final round in the national competition, held in Washington, DC.&lt;ref name="laf"&gt;“Lafayette, Reigning National Champion in College Fed Challenge, Will Host Regional Competition,” Lafayette.edu, 8 November 2010, [http://www.lafayette.edu/about/news/2010/10/13/college-fed-challenge/.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scoring==

	The panel of judges score each team after the 15-minute question and answer session.  A maximum of 50 points are awarded accordingly.  Judges use a scoring rubric which analyzes the team's “Knowledge of the Fed, current state of the economy, and monetary policy”, “Responses to Judges questions”, “Quality of the presentation”, “Research and analysis”, and “Teamwork and cooperation”.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

'''Harry Lewiston''' (April 2, 1900 – June 1, 1965; legal name '''Israel Harry Jaffe''') was an American [[showman]], [[freak show]] director, and [[Barker (occupation)|barker]]. He wrote his memoirs under his stage name, published posthumously in 1968 as ''Freak Show Man: the Autobiography of Harry Lewiston, as told to Jerry Holtman''.

__TOC__

==Early life and name change==
Harry Lewiston was born Israel Harry Jaffe in [[Lithuania]] on April 2, 1900, and emigrated to the United States with his family in 1906. The eldest of four siblings, he was raised in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] in a strict [[Orthodox Jewish]] household. In 1914, he ran away from home and joined the combined [[Sells Floto Circus]] / [[Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show]]. He claimed that he was seventeen years old in order to be allowed to stay with the circus, and was renamed "Lewiston," reportedly assigned based on the first major city he worked in, [[Lewiston, Maine]]. While the circus toured the United States, Lewiston worked as a pony groomer and led the animals in the parade, wearing what he called an "Arab costume" as part of that year's "East Meets West" theme.

==World War I==
After [[World War I]] broke out, Lewiston left the circus to enlist. After briefly being attached for training with the [[Canadian Army]] (serial number S-4147), he proceeded to the United Kingdom and was posted to the 40th Battalion of Britain's [[Royal Fusiliers]] in the [[Jewish Legion]] in 1918, serving as a camp cook (regimental number J5873).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor = Rev. Michael Adler | title = British Jewry Book of Honour | publisher = Caxton Publishing Company, Ltd. | year = 1922 | page = 270}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography, he mentions serving with [[David Ben-Gurion]], who was in the 38th; those units were stationed together in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and other sites. Throughout the war, he was stationed in [[Taranto, Italy]]; [[Port Said, Egypt]]; [[Al Qantarah El Sharqiyya|Kantara]], [[Egypt]]; [[Lod]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]; and [[Damascus, Syria]]. He noted that while in Damascus he was promoted to lance corporal; his actual service records show him being discharged at the rank of private. After the war ended, he traveled to South Africa to see relatives, as well as [[Rhodesia]], [[India]], and [[Burma]], and eventually shipped back to England. In December 1919, he was officially discharged from military service, sailed from [[Liverpool]] to New York City aboard the ''S.S. Cedric'', and from there returned to Massachusetts.

==Return to the United States==
Lewiston stayed with his family in Worcester for a short period of time, working as a shophand in a [[machine shop]]. Subsequently, he worked various jobs in New York City, then rode the rails to a few towns. In his autobiography, he mentions being arrested for vagrancy in eastern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and working on a [[chain gang]] for six days. He then went to [[Cleveland]] and briefly worked in a restaurant.

==Return to circus life==
In 1920, Lewiston went to [[Peru, Indiana]], the winter quarters of five railroad circuses. He was hired by the [[John Robinson Shows]], where he first worked as an [[Usher (occupation)|usher]], then as a "candy butcher," selling [[Concession stand|concessions]] during the show as well as during the concert after the show. After the circus season ended for the winter, he worked as a candy butcher for the [[Union News Company]] on their train the West Point Railroad, which traveled back and forth from [[Atlanta]] to [[Jacksonville]].

In 1921 and 1922, Lewiston worked as a candy butcher and concessions buyer for [[Howes Great London Circus]]. In his autobiography, he mentions that this is when he learned [[Confidence trick|conning]], [[Political corruption#Graft|grafting]], and short-changing techniques. He then wintered with [[Christy Brothers Circus]] in [[Houston]] and worked in their ticket booth the following season, where he began to practice his short-changing technique. Over the next few years, he worked as assistant manager of concessions and as the purchasing agent with [[Gollmar Bros. Circus]], then as a ticket seller for [[Gentry Brothers]] circus, where he dated a [[hoochie coochie]] dancer. Subsequently, he switched to [[Golden Brothers Circus]], where he ran the hamburger stand, sold balloons and novelties, and also served as the substitute announcer. This was his first experience as a [[Barker (occupation)|barker]], referred to as a "talker" in the circus community (though "barker" will be used throughout this entry for ease of understanding).

In early 1925, he worked with the newly formed [[Carolina Minstrels]], an all-[[Black people|black]] troupe based in [[Shelbyville, Kentucky]]. He "strutted downtown at the head of the band to make announcements," and also sold reserved tickets, supervised equipment unloading and setup, and sold prize candy. Later that year, he switched to [[Miller Brothers 101 Ranch]] show, where he worked as a ticket seller and sideshow announcer. He worked for Miller Brothers again the following year, but was fired by Joe Miller for short-changing patrons. Lewiston was hired by the [[Boyd and Linderman Shows]] to organize and hire performers and musicians for a [[hoochie coochie]] show. After the touring season ended, he ran a ([[Match fixing|fixed]]) [[roulette|betting wheel]] for [[Pollack's 20 Big Shows]]. In early 1927, he worked as a candy butcher and a fill-in performer for Pat Whale's Traveling Burlesque Show, and then briefly ran a [[brothel]]/[[speakeasy]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] before the police shut it down.

==Marriage and continued circus career==
In fall 1927, Lewiston was hired as the assistant to Arthur Hoffman of the [[Morris and Castle carnival]]. He prepared the opening of [[Singer's Midgets]] show at the [[Mississippi Valley Fair]] in [[Davenport, Iowa]], where he also talked up the show on the [[Midway (fair)|midway]] and sold tickets. It was at this time that he met his future wife Rose Adelstein, who was working with Morris and Castle as a mentalist/fortuneteller under the name "Lady Zindra." Lewiston stayed on with Morris and Castle the following year, and was named the manager of the "Broadway review" show. He began dating Rose, who was also raised as an [[Orthodox Jew]], and they married on November 26, 1928 in [[Cook County, Illinois]]. She took his legal last name and became Rose Jaffe, but continued to perform as a fortune teller under her stage name and was known socially as Rose Lewiston.

In 1929, they both worked for the [[Al G. Barnes Circus]] sideshow. Lewiston worked again as an assistant to Arthur Hoffman, and Rose was a fortune teller. In 1930, they initially worked for the [[Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus]]. Lewiston managed the sideshow, and Rose was a fortune teller, but the show closed in late August from poor sales due to the [[Great Depression]]. Subsequently, they returned to Morris and Castle, and Lewiston brought several [[circus freaks]] with him. They stayed with Morris and Castel in 1931, and Lewiston and Rose also added a duo mindreading act to their performance at several state fairs. In 1932, he switched to the [[John T. Wortham Carnival]], where he ran the privilege car and managed a fortune telling booth, while Rose returned to fortunetelling for the Al. G. Barnes Circus that season.

==Chicago World's Fair==
In late 1932, Lewiston was hired by sideshow impresario [[Duke Mills]] to organize a freak show for the upcoming "[[Century of Progress]]" [[World's Fair]] in Chicago, and to serve as the barker and managing director. The freak show opened in 1933, but competed poorly with [[Ripley’s Odditorium#Museums|Ripley's Believe It Or Not]] located just down the midway, and closed early after approximately six weeks. Lewiston was soon hired by showmen Lew Dufour and Joe Rogers to design the "Darkest Africa" show on the [[Midway (fair)|Midway]] at the World's Fair, featuring Africans from [[Nigeria]], [[Uganda]], [[Belgian Congo]], and [[French Congo]], and representing the Ubangi, Karamojo, and [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] ethnic groups. Sometimes calling himself "Major Lewiston" or "Captain Lewiston," ranks above what he had earned, he worked as a barker for this show as well:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Another of the lecturers, Capt. Harry Lewiston, formerly of the British army, also spoke of the blacks with genuine respect, adding, apropos of the Nigerians, "You know, those men have eyesight about 300 per cent better than ours. Brave and strong! Look at the play of muscles on those backs! Give me a hundred thousand such men, trained in the use of modern arms, and I'll conquer the moon -- as the German officers used to say." "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Africa Speaks at Fair with Jungle Drums | journal = [[Chicago Daily Tribune]] | author = James O'Donnell Bennett | page = 9 | date = September 18, 1933}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
That winter, Lewiston and Rose did their duo mindreading act for [[Morris Miller's Traveling Museum]].

==Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus==
While working at the World's Fair in 1933, Lewiston was approached by [[Clyde Ingalls]] and hired to work at [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]] the following year. He started in the sideshow ticket booth and the bally stand next to it in 1934, but was promoted as Ingalls' chief assistant on his second day. Lewiston also served as the sideshow pay master, and did special announcements. In his autobiography, he proudly notes that he adapted the circus [[slogan]], coining the phrase "The Greatest Side Show On Earth." While the circus was closed that winter, Lewiston and Rose did their duo mindreading act for the [[Gus Sun]] Circuit.

In 1935, Lewiston started at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus opening at [[Madison Square Garden]], where he directed the "Parade of the Freaks" from the center ring / [[hippodrome]]. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' noted that he was "assistant manager of Clyde Ingalls' Side Show" and "has been alternating with latter on big show announcements," meaning that Lewiston was the chief announcer for the main circus acts, not just the sideshow. The magazine also noted that Lewiston would "also present a mental act on road tour," which was a first for that circus; Ringling Bros. had previously distanced itself from acts traditionally associated with defrauding the public. Rose was hired to perform as "Madam Zindra," the circus' first-ever [[mentalist]]. The couple continued to work with this circus for the next two years.

==Harry Lewiston's Traveling Museum==
[[Image:HarryLewiston-freaks.jpg|thumb|400px|Rose Lewiston (far left), Eli Lewiston (child on left), Harry Lewiston (far right), and several of their performing "freaks." Identified performers include Grace McDaniels the "Mule-Faced Woman" (just left of center in the back row; most of her face is hidden) and Tony Marino the sword swallower (in suit and tie).]]
In late 1937, Lewiston and Rose left Ringling Bros. to form their own organization, and brought several circus freaks with them, including [[Grace McDaniels]] the "Mule-Faced Woman," tattooed girl Stella Grassman, Clico the African pygmy, "Human Balloon" Art Hubbell, Disco the magician, Lady Johanna the mentalist, sword swallowers John and Vivian Dunning, and Mel Burkhart the "Anatomical Wonder," who subsequently developed his "Human Blockhead" act while working in this show. Harry Lewiston's Traveling Museum (also known as "Lewiston's Big Circus Sideshow," "World's Fair Freaks," and "Palace of Oddities") featured a variety of sideshow and freak performers, a "girlie show," and [[snakes]]. Additionally, Rose managed several fortune tellers and served as the entire organization's treasurer. They initially paired up with the [[Conklin and Garret Shows]] and performed at venues throughout the United States and Canada, including the [[Canadian National Exhibition]]. Their son Eli was born in Illinois in February 1938, and later became part of the act. He was billed as the baby of two [[Dwarfism|dwarfs]], with advertisements featuring teasers including "Midget Couple and Normal Baby, 10-mo. old son."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | journal = [[Rochester Democrat &amp; Chronicle]] | page = 9D | date = December 11, 1938}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewiston's [[Pythonidae|python]] display, which included a wrestling act, was featured in a full-column article with two more columns of photos in ''[[The Charlotte Observer]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Big Python Fed Like Bad Child: 30-Foot Reptile Pumped Full of Eggs and Meat Like Boy Taking Castor Oil | journal = [[The Charlotte Observer]] | date = March 26, 1939 | page = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an excerpt of the story even received national attention:
[[Image:HarryLewiston ad.jpg|thumb|left|A typical newspaper ad placed by Harry Lewiston to solicit customers]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[[Charlotte]], N.C., March 25 (AP) - Pete, a thirty-foot python, had a late luncheon today - six months late. Pythons, Harry Lewiston, keeper of the reptile, explained, eat only about once every three months. Pete hurt his throat nine months ago and had to pass up two meals. Today, with an eight-foot rubber hose, he was fed a snack of thirty pounds of chopped meat, fifteen dozen eggs and fifteen pounds of crushed bone. It took eighteen men to hold Pete while they fed him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Python Eats, Six Months Late | journal = [[New York Times]] | date = March 26, 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
While Rose ran her "Palace of Knowledge" at the [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]] in 1939 and 1940, Lewiston continued to bring his museum on tour, traveling with organizations including truck carnival [[William Glick Shows]] and [[Johnny J. Jones Carnival]]. He ran an enlarged side show, including his snakes, plus a freak animal show. While traveling with Jones in [[Warren, Pennsylvania]] during the summer of 1940, Lewiston's sword swallower Lady Vivian Dunning was profiled in the local paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Jones Carnival Attracts Many On First Night | journal = Warren Times-Mirror ([[Warren, PA]]) | date = July 2, 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewiston also claims to have been the first showman to buy and repurpose the "headless girl" display, transforming it from a simple illusion act to fooling audiences by pretending she was real. He rigged the exhibit with flowing liquids and medical equipment, and created the story of "Olga Hess," who had been decapitated on a train but was kept alive by a doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = A.W. Stencell | title = Seeing Is Believing: America's Sideshows | publisher = [[ECW Press]] | year = 2002 | isbn= 1-55022-529-4 | pages = 145–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:LewistonEnterprises.jpg|thumb|250px|One of the "Lewiston Enterprises" trucks used to transport the Traveling Museum]]
Throughout the early to mid-1940s, the Museum continued to perform successfully, typically contracting with amusement parks and state fairs during the summers and touring during the winters. In 1941, Harry Lewiston's Traveling Museum joined the Happy Land Shows for summer events in [[Michigan]]. Later that season, they performed at the [[Cambria County]] Fair in [[Ebensburg, Pennsylvania]]. He notes in his autobiography that due to the lewd nature of part of the show, he was sentenced to nine months jail in [[Eastern State Penitentiary]], as were several [[hoochie coochie]] girls, though they were all released after six days. In 1942, while the Museum was in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], Harry Lewiston's performing "stone man" Charles Porter visited a famous local resident also suffering from the disease (likely ''[[Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva]]''), and they were profiled in the local paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Bedfast By Rare Malady, Pair Hold Short Visit | journal = [[Erie Times-News|Erie Daily Times]] | date = March 10, 1942 | page = 13 &amp; 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:HarryLewiston advertisement.jpg|thumb|600px|Harry Lewiston placed this ad in the May 27, 1944 issue of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' to solicit new acts]]
In 1944, while the Museum was installed for a month in [[Pittsburgh]], the two legal guardians of Bobo and Kiki, the show's "[[Microcephaly|pinheads]]," arrived to take the pair back home to Texas. After Rose objected that their contract had not yet expired, a fight broke out, and a local patrolman arrested all five of them. Charges were later dismissed, and the pinheads stayed on with the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Pinheads' Labors Cut, Peace Reigns at 635 | journal = [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | date = December 13, 1944 | page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1945, he formed a partnership called Gayer &amp; Lewiston Enterprises with Archie Gayer, operator of Archie's Playland Arcade in Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Lewiston and Gayer Form Amusement Partnership | journal = [[Boxoffice (magazine)|Boxoffice]] | date = October 13, 1945 | page = 70}}&lt;/ref&gt; They co-ran the Monroe Theatre, and a new annex was added to the back of the arcade, where Lewiston managed a variety of attractions for several years, including an exhibit titled "Crime Does Not Pay," bazaars, and sideshow acts.

[[Image:HarryLewiston-TonyMarino.jpg|thumb|150px|Harry Lewiston and sword swallower Tony Marino]]
In 1947, while working for Lewiston over July 4 weekend, sword swallower Tony Marino "gulped a two-foot length of lighted neon tube, glowed at his appreciative audience, bowed, thereupon went out like a light, [and] was hustled to a hospital for removal of the shattered tube."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Miscellany: Something He Ate | journal = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = July 7, 1947 | page = 96}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two weeks of recuperation, including treatment with a [[stomach pump]], [[milk of magnesia]], and [[oatmeal]], Marino continued performing with Lewiston's Museum. In 1950, Lewiston ran sideshows at Edgewater Park, Eastwood Park, and Jefferson Beach in Detroit, the first time that any single show operator had attractions at all three parks at once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Edgewater Bows To Upped Gross Despite Strike | journal = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | date = May 13, 1950 | page = 66}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, he leased sideshow and concert operation rights from Mills Bros. for their 32-week season. He noted in his autobiography that he was bitten in the face by a [[South American]] [[boa constrictor]] during this time.

==Post-performance life==
[[Image:Freak Show Man.jpg|thumb|Harry Lewiston's autobiography]]
In the early 1950s, Harry (now calling himself "Jaffe" again) and Rose retired from performance and management life, and moved to Florida, where they invested in several hotel properties. Rose died from cancer in April 1954, and was buried in [[Cook County, Illinois]]. In December 1955, he married a woman named Leona Decker in [[Monroe County, Florida]].

In 1957, the couple moved to the Los Angeles area. Harry's health, especially his eyesight, had deteriorated badly. In his autobiography, he speculates that this might have been due to his heavy drinking. They invested in several properties, and a local daily newspaper ran a profile article of the famous circus man who had bought a hotel. He began writing a weekly column for a paper in [[Fontana, California]]. Concurrently, he started an employment agency, and also worked to help recent [[parole]]es reintegrate into society. His service was lauded by the state board of corrections at a testimonial dinner.

As his health waned, he began working on his memoirs. ''Freak Show Man: the Autobiography of Harry Lewiston, as told to Jerry Holtman'', was published posthumously in 1968 by [[Holloway House]] Publishing Co.

Harry Jaffe died on June 1, 1965 in [[San Bernardino County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = In the Shadows (obituaries) | journal = The Daily Sun (San Bernardino) | page = E-10 | date = June 3, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean Kane Foulke du Pont''' (May 21, 1891&amp;ndash;November 6, 1985) was an American [[suffragette]], [[prison reform]] activist and philanthropist.

==Biography==

Foulke du Pont was born in [[Lenape, Pennsylvania]] to parents George Rhyfedd Foulke and Jean Kane Foulke.&lt;ref name="papers"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dehistory.cuadra.com/starweb9/l.skca-catalog/servlet.starweb9 |title=Jean Kane Foulke duPont papers, 1886-1975 |publisher=[[Delaware Historical Society]]|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the granddaughter of [[William Parker Foulke|William Foulke]], who discovered the first full dinosaur skeleton in North America (''[[Hadrosaurus]] foulkii''), in [[Haddonfield, New Jersey]], in 1858. 

She grew up in Philadelphia and attended the Misses Hebb's School in [[Wilmington, Delaware]].&lt;ref name="papers"/&gt; She married industrialist [[E. Paul du Pont|Éleuthère Paul du Pont]] on June 9, 1910. Her husband was a member of the prominent [[Du Pont family]] and the founder of [[Du Pont Motors]]. They had six sons: ; Éleuthère Paul, Jr. (1911); Francis George (1913); Stephen (1915); Robert Jacques (1923);Benjamin Bonneau (1919), and Alexis Irénée (1928). Their son Stephen, an aviation enthusiast, was inducted into the [[Soaring Hall of Fame]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/delawareonline/obituary.aspx?pid=158794013 |title=Stephen DuPont Obituary|work=The News Journal |date=July 29, 2012 |accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==

Foulke du Pont was a progressive woman for her era, and her passion was prison reform; in 1919 she helped found [[The Prisoners' Aid Society of Delaware]] as well as Bridge House, a detention home for [[juvenile offender|juvenile offenders]] in the Browntown section of Wilmington, that was open until 1989.&lt;ref name="udel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.udel.edu/PR/duPontFamily/internal_pages/personal_index.html |title=Familial Relations: The Du Ponts &amp; the University of Delaware |publisher=[[The University of Delaware]] |accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foulke du Pont was exceedingly active in the [[women's suffrage]] movement; in 1916 she picketed the [[White House]] with a troop of Delaware women in an effort to persuade President [[Woodrow Wilson]] to become active in the cause. 

During [[World War I]], Foulke du Pont was a leader in the Women's [[Auxiliaries|Auxiliary]] for the Delaware Committee, as well as the [[Council of National Defense]].  She was also responsible for several "Save the Babies" stations, which resulted in Delaware's "Pure Milk Legislation" intended to protect milk sold for babies, and also led to child welfare programs in Delaware. Foulke du Pont also played an important role in the creation of Delaware's present Family Court. There is a plaque in her honor at the Family Court in Wilmington, dedicated in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech|event=Dedication of Plaque Honoring Jean Kane Foulke du Pont |title=Hagley Museum and Library Archive |author=Judge Elwood Melson |date=1963 |location=Wilmington, Delaware |url=http://h92010.eos-intl.net/H92010/OPAC/Details/Record.aspx?IndexCode=-1&amp;TaskCode=1435140&amp;HitCount=7&amp;CollectionCode=2&amp;SortDirection=Descending&amp;CurrentPage=1&amp;CurrentLinkCode=MH92010%7c75458584%7c1%7c15270771&amp;SelectionType=0&amp;SearchType=2&amp;BibCode=MH92010%7c3153586%7c4%7c15270774 |accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, she contacted the [[University of Delaware]] seeking a training and educational program for the Delaware's correctional workers, to benefit those "working in probation, parole, family court, and youth services, as well as the guards in state prisons."&lt;ref name="udel" /&gt;  She created a $400,000 endowment (equivalent of $3 million in 2014) in honor of her husband, the "E. Paul du Pont Endowment for the Study of Crime, Delinquency, and Corrections," if the university agreed to train the correctional personnel. She also donated a 10-year grant to encourage the university faculty to study prison reform and prisoner rehabilitation issues through the sociology department. This eventually led to the university's [[criminal justice]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.udel.edu/PR/munroe/chapter12.html |title=The University of Delaware: A History - Chapter 12 |publisher=[[The University of Delaware]]| |accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also made additional yearly donations to the sociology department to study social welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.udel.edu/PR/munroe/chapter11.html |title=The University of Delaware: A History - Chapter 11 |publisher=[[The University of Delaware]]| |accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffrey Cheah moved to Australia to pursue a business degree at [[Victoria University, Australia|Victoria University]] (then Footscray Institute of Technology) in [[Melbourne]] and after graduating, returned to Malaysia to take a job as an accountant in a motor assembly plant. He soon left this employment, and in 1974, he started his own company, a small tin-mining company with a startup capital of RM100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www1.channelnewsasia.com/premier/2015/08/21/from-wasteland-to-wonderland/|title=From Wasteland To Wonderland|last=|first=|date=21 August 2015|website=www1.channelnewsasia.com|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Sunway Group is one of Malaysia's most formidable property-construction conglomerate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2014/09/28/enriching-lives-building-the-future-tan-sri-dr-jeffrey-cheah-leads-by-example-in-his-quest-to-inspir/|title=Enriching lives, building the future  - Nation {{!}} The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sunway Group and Bandar Sunway ==
The [[Sunway Group]] grew from a gradual conglomeration of Jeffrey Cheah's business interests. At its heart is the {{convert|350|ha|acre sqmi|adj=on}} development [[Bandar Sunway]], in the [[Petaling, Selangor|Petaling]] district of the state of [[Selangor]]. This derelict mining estate was 'resurrected' as a new township, twenty minutes' drive from the centre of [[Kuala Lumpur]], focused around the [[Sunway Lagoon]] theme park and the [[Sunway Pyramid]] shopping mall, both of which are Sunway Group holdings. Cheah's investment in Malaysian higher education is represented by the two universities of Bandar Sunway: the Malaysian campus of the Australian [[Monash University]] and the local [[Sunway University]]. The rehabilitation and transformation of the landscape has won the township international awards, including being recognised as Malaysia's first fully integrated green township as certified by the Green Building Index (GBI) of Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldfinance.com/infrastructure-investment/driving-real-estate-development-in-malaysia|title=Driving real estate development in Malaysia|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The township, Sunway City (formerly known as Sunway Resort City) also clinched the Low Carbon City award from the Malaysian Institute of Planners for implementing low carbon initiatives within the township.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/metro/smebiz/news/2017/01/04/developer-wins-lowcarbon-city-award-for-sunway-city/|title=Developer wins low-carbon city award for Sunway City - SMEBiz News {{!}} The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Educational investment ===
In 1987, Jeffrey Cheah established [[Sunway University|Sunway College]] in [[Bandar Sunway]] as a private tertiary educational institute. A major phase in the college's early development was its partnership with [[Monash University]] in [[Melbourne]], Australia. The partnership allowed Malaysian students to pursue a preparatory year at Sunway College before being admitted to study at Monash. In 1997, the college has proved financially viable, and Cheah transferred ownership to the Sunway Educational Trust Fund (which was later renamed the Jeffrey Cheah Foundation). This move paved the way for the Monash partnership to take the next step. In 1998, the [[Monash University Malaysia Campus]] was opened in [[Bandar Sunway]], in partnership with the trust fund. On 12 August 2004, the Minister for Education granted the institution the status of a [[university college]]. In 2006, the [[Sultan of Selangor]] installed Jeffrey Cheah as Foundation [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the university college. In appreciation of his contribution to Monash University Malaysia Campus, the Monash University School of Medicine was named after him in 2007. In January 2011, the institution was further upgraded to a fully independent university.&lt;ref name="Sunway Uni history"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sunway.edu.my/university/why-sunway/the-university/our-story | title=Sunway University: Our story | accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Jeffrey Cheah's leadership, the Sunway Safe City Initiative was implemented. This initiative, which was launched in 2001, has proven extremely effective in combating crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/community/2008/02/16/bandar-sunway-a-safe-city-success-story/|title=Bandar Sunway a safe city success story - Community {{!}} The Star Online|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A partnership between the [[Royal Malaysia Police]], [[Malaysia Crime Prevention Foundation]] (MCPF), the Selangor State Government and the Sunway Group, it has reduced the crime rate and infused the township with a spirit of togetherness and neighbourliness that now serves as an example for other residents' association throughout [[Selangor]]. In recognition of Tan Sri Jeffrey's meritorious contribution in the field of social safety and security, he was appointed the Chairman of MCPF Selangor Chapter by the Minister of Unity, Culture, Arts &amp; Heritage in Aug 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://2014.forbesglobalceoconference.com/speaker/jeffrey-cheah|title=Speakers {{!}} Forbes Global CEO Conference|website=2014.forbesglobalceoconference.com|access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Key person insurance''', also commonly called '''keyman insurance''' and '''key man insurance''' or 'key employee insurance', is an important form of [[business insurance]]. There is no legal definition of "key person insurance". In general, it can be described as an [[insurance policy]] taken out by a business to compensate that business for financial losses that would arise from the death or extended incapacity of an important member of the business. To put it simply, key person insurance is a standard life insurance or trauma insurance policy that is used for business succession or business protection purposes. The policy's term does not extend beyond the period of the key person’s usefulness to the business. Key person policies are usually owned by the business and the aim is to compensate the business for losses incurred with the loss of a key income generator and facilitate business continuity.  Key person insurance does not [[Indemnity|indemnify]] the actual losses incurred but compensates with a fixed monetary sum as specified in the insurance policy.&lt;ref name="ind"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/money/insurance/how-would-your-business-cope-if-a-key-person-fell-ill-1870065.html|title=How would your business cope if a key person fell ill?|date=17 January 2010|publisher=[[The Independent]]|language=English|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many businesses have a key person who is responsible for the majority of profits or has a unique and hard to replace skill set such as Intellectual Property that is vital to the organisation. An employer may take out a key person insurance policy on the life or health of any employee whose knowledge, work, or overall contribution is considered uniquely valuable to the company.  The employer does this to offset the costs (such as hiring temporary help or recruiting a successor) and losses (such as a decreased ability to transact business until successors are trained) which the employer is likely to suffer in the event of the loss of a key person.&lt;ref name="jstor"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nicholson, Jack E. &amp; Corbett|first=Richard B.|date=January 1987|title=Key Man Insurance and Market Reaction: A Comment|journal=The Journal of Insurance Issues and Practices|publisher=Western Risk and Insurance Association|volume=10|issue=1|pages=53–61|jstor=41943220|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insurable losses==
There are four categories of loss for which key person insurance can provide compensation:

#Losses related to the extended period when a key person is unable to work, to provide temporary personnel and, if necessary to finance the recruitment and training of a replacement.
#Insurance to protect profits. For example, offsetting lost income from lost sales, losses resulting from the delay or cancellation of any business project that the key person was involved in, loss of opportunity to expand, loss of specialised skills or knowledge.
#Insurance to protect [[shareholders]] or [[partnership]] interests. Typically this is insurance to enable shareholdings or partnership interests to be purchased by existing shareholders or partners.
#Insurance for anyone involved in guaranteeing business loans or banking facilities. The value of insurance coverage is arranged to equal the value of the guarantee.

==Key person definition==
Key people are individuals whose skills, knowledge, experience or leadership are important to a business’ continued financial success. Should something happen to one of these individuals it is likely that their loss will have a detrimental impact on the profitability of the business and will cause financial strain. Examples of a key individual include, but are not limited to: company directors, sales directors, IT specialist, managing directors and heads of product development.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Worth attribution==
{{expand section|date=June 2017}}
Deciding on the sum of money to ensure the key person is dependent on the company and the reason for insuring that individual. It can be to cover a loan or investment amount, or it can be dependent on working out the worth of the person to the company. It is recommended that you think about potential loss of profits, the cost of replacement and any debts that would need to be covered to keep the company running without that person.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Loss of profits can be caused as a result of the loss of company reputation, the loss of clients or a decline in sales. For example, if a key sales manager had built up a relationship with key clients, they may no longer want to work with the business if that key person were no longer around. This can cause them to go elsewhere and cause a dip in sales figures. In addition to this, the cost of training, recruitment and temporary cover to find a replacement can be high. This also needs to be factored into the amount of cover that is taken out. The company would need to consider how they would be impacted as a result of a loss of a key person in different ways to determine how much that individual is worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Key Man Insurance|url=https://businesscoverexpert.com/key-man-insurance/|website=businesscoverexpert.com/|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy ownership==
Key person insurance policies can be owned in a number of ways depending on the needs of the business. It is common for a business to own the policy with claim proceeds being paid directly to the business. There is no legislative or insurable requirement for a policy to be owned by a specific party or entity and there may be circumstances be it for taxation or policy continuation purposes where policies may be owned and paid for by the insured person directly or owned by another individual.

==Advantages==
# In case of death of a keyman the company is paid money to cope up with the loss.
# In the USA, any business concern buying keyman insurance for its employee can claim a deduction for the premium paid for the policy as a business expense under Section 37(1) of the [[Individual Income Tax Act of 1944|Income Tax Act]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}{{disambiguation needed|date=February 2018}} Tax deductions may also apply in other countries. 
# This policy can be used as either an extra superannuation benefit or an ex-gratia payment to the key employee during the service period. If the company receives the proceeds on maturity, then they may be taxable. (With recent changes in rules, only Term Plan is available under Key  Man Insurance. Hence, there will not be any maturity benefit)
# No need of giving advanced intimation to the income tax authorities.
# The company can also raise loans on the policy from LIC. (On Term Plan,  no loan is available)
# For the executives earning high salaries, this policy can be given as a hike in salary and saves income tax.
# It becomes a great help to the business for their [[tax planning]].
# The directors can also safeguard their immediate family from getting affected by the vagaries of the industry and the various business cycles that the business has to encounter.
# Key person insurance policy helps to improve the retention of key human resources of the business.

==Disadvantages==
# The amount on claim or maturity under a key person insurance policy is not exempt under Section 10 (10D) of the [[Individual Income Tax Act of 1944|Income Tax Act]] if the company is paying the premiums unless the policy is assigned to the key person who himself/herself pay the premium.
# If the policy is surrendered then the amount endorsed is taxable in the hands of key man as profit in lieu of salary.

==Taxation==
The tax treatment for premiums paid for key person insurance and the treatment of monies received from a claim vary among countries.

Premiums are generally not tax deductible in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Sec264"&gt;{{cite book |title=IRC Sec. 264(a)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the COLI Best Practices Act within the [[Pension Protection Act of 2006]], key person insurance proceeds for policies owned by employers can be taxable if certain conditions are not met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Taxation of Key Man Insurance|url=https://www.keypersoninsurance.com/taxation/|website=KeyPersonInsurance.com|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, Key person insurance policies are generally not deductible unless used specifically for business revenue protection purposes. Claim proceeds in Australia if used for revenue purposes may be taxable and depending on the ownership of the policy, may trigger a [[Capital Gains Taxation Event]]. In the UK the main principles of key person insurance taxation were outlined by the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in 1944, [[Sir John Anderson]]. The "Andersen Rules" state "Treatment for taxation purposes would depend upon the facts of the particular case and it rests with the assessing authorities and the Commissioners on appeal, if necessary, to determine the liability by reference to these facts. I am, however, advised that the general practice in dealing with insurances on the lives of employees is to treat the premiums as admissible deductions, and any sums received under a policy as trading receipts, if (i) the sole relationship is that of employer and employee; (ii) the insurance is intended to meet loss of profit resulting from the loss of services of the employee; and (iii) it is an annual or short-term insurance. Cases of premiums paid by companies to insure the lives of Directors are dealt with on similar lines."&lt;ref name="taxation"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.taxation.co.uk/Articles/2011/05/11/24242/key-people|title=Key people|last=Durrant-Walker|first=Rob|date=11 May 2011|publisher=taxation.co.uk|language=English|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UK taxation for key man insurance is normally taken from the guidance set out by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1944. In answer to a parliamentary question Sir John Anderson made the following statement:
“Treatment for taxation purposes would depend upon the facts of the particular case and it rests with the assessing authorities and the Commissioners on appeal, if necessary, to determine the liability by reference to these facts. I am, however, advised that the general practice in dealing with insurances on the lives of employees is to treat the premiums as admissible deductions, and any sums received under a policy as trading receipts, if (i) the sole relationship is that of employer and employee; (ii) the insurance is intended to meet loss of profit resulting from the loss of services of the employee; and (iii) it is an annual or short-term insurance. Cases of premiums paid by companies to insure the lives of Directors are dealt with on similar lines.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Key Man Insurance Taxation How It Works|url=https://www.mykeymaninsurance.com/key-man-insurance-taxation/|website=MyKeyManInsurance.com|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK tax office, HMRC, has the view that key man insurance is tax-efficient if it is taken out 'solely for the purposes of the business'. Specifically, if the company takes out a key man insurance policy to protect the business from any loss of profits that have stemmed from the loss of the employee, then the premiums are not taxable. If a key employee has a substantial number of shares, then the key man insurance could potentially be seen as being taken out for their own interests, instead of the business. This is particularly the case if critical illness cover is added to the policy. Essentially, key man insurance can be tax-efficient, but it is always best to check with a financial advisor or the local tax office before making assumptions.

'''KlickEx''' is a [[Polynesia]]n payments system for low value electronic [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] transactions using an [[Interbank foreign exchange market|interbank]] [[smart market]] retail system.  It provides low cost electronic foreign exchange [[Clearing (finance)|clearing]] services to clients in the [[Pacific Islands]] avoiding the usual foreign transfer fees and [[Bid–offer spread|spreads]] by matching up individuals sending payments to and from the islands.

Payments can be made between the Pacific Islands and Australia, New Zealand and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.klickex.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The system also allows users to transfer directly to [[Mobile payment|mobile wallets]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fletcher|first=Hamish|title=Tech firm scores Pacific money transfer deal|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/connect/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501833&amp;objectid=10757041|accessdate=31 August 2013|newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bank accounts.

The system is an electronic alternative to informal [[Hawala]] systems, traditional [[Electronic funds transfer|international bank transfers]] and older [[remittance]] networks where the minimum transfer fees would often make it uneconomical to send low value payments that are typical for [[migrant worker]]s and relatives of the island communities.

The company has won a number of awards and support from NZ government development agencies for providing a service that enables rapid low value payments [[cross-border|Foreign Exchange]] a lower cost, and reaching a much larger number of impoverished (but vibrant) communities in the South Pacific islands.

==History==
The company name is derived from the title: ''The Klick Exchange Trading Company''.  The company was resident of the [[ICEHOUSE (incubator)|ICE-house incubator]] innovation centre in Auckland.

The KlickEx system is based on trading technology that has been operational since 2002.

Through a regional partnership with the [[United Nations Development Program]], and the Australian and New Zealand Governments in 2011; KlickEx continued to build services and by providing the platform for Mobile Carriers ([[MNO]]) to integrate mobile wallet platforms into the established banking system; thereby accelerating the penetration of financial services to the [[unbanked]] in the [[Pacific]], particularly focusing on Rural communities, and [[financial inclusion]] for women in developing economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pfip.org/media-centre/press-releases/digicel-klickex-launch-web-to-mobile-wallet-remittance-transfer.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502190010/http://www.pfip.org/media-centre/press-releases/digicel-klickex-launch-web-to-mobile-wallet-remittance-transfer.html |archivedate=2012-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* multi-regional clearing, verification, and order forwarding, this allows the proceeds of multi-currency settlements to be forwarded on electronically at bank-bank exchange rates, providing end users efficient access to overhead-free FX rates.
* cashflow tracking services and wealth management systems enable enhanced transparency and consumer security across a multi-currency platform.

KlickEx operates a [[straight-through processing]] settlement system that enables individuals and partnership banks to gain access to cross-border foreign currency clearing facilities and rapid settlement between accounts, delivering cleared funds across currencies in seconds. The system micro-manages standing orders for foreign exchange as little as NZ$1.00.  With retail clients in New Zealand, Australia, Tonga and Samoa having immediate access following a short approval and [[Anti-money laundering]] process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3286">This is a '''list of [[production function]]s''' that have been used in the [[economics]] literature. Production functions are a key part of modelling [[national output]] and [[national income]].

The production functions listed below, and their properties are shown for the case of two factors of production, [[capital (economics)|capital]] (K), and [[labor economics|labor]] (L), mostly for heuristic purposes. These functions and their properties are easily generalizable to include additional factors of production (like land, natural resources, entrepreneurship, etc.)

==Technology==

There are three common ways to incorporate technology (or the efficiency with which factors of production are used) into a production function (here ''A'' is a scale factor, ''F'' is a production function, and ''Y'' is the amount of physical output produced):
* [[Hicks-neutral technical change|Hicks-neutral technology]], or "factor augmenting": &lt;math&gt;\ Y = AF(K,L)&lt;/math&gt; 
* Harrod-neutral technology, or "labor augmenting": &lt;math&gt;\ Y = F(K,AL)&lt;/math&gt; 
* Solow-neutral technology, or "capital augmenting": &lt;math&gt;\ Y = F(AK,L)&lt;/math&gt;

==Elasticity of substitution==

The elasticity of substitution between [[factors of production]] is a measure of how easily one factor can be substituted for another. With two factors of production, say, ''K'' and ''L'', it is a measure of the curvature of a production [[isoquant]]. The mathematical definition is:

:&lt;math&gt;\ \epsilon=\left[\frac {\partial(slope)} {\partial(L/K)} \frac {L/K} {slope}\right]^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where "slope" denotes the slope of the isoquant, given by

:&lt;math&gt;\ slope=-\frac {\partial F(K,L)/ \partial K} {\partial F(K,L)/ \partial L}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Returns to scale==

[[Returns to scale]] can be
* Increasing returns to scale: doubling all input usages more than doubles output. 
* Decreasing returns to scale: doubling all input usages less than doubles output.
* Constant returns to scale: doubling all input usages exactly doubles output.

==Some widely used forms==
* [[Constant elasticity of substitution]] (CES) function: 
::&lt;math&gt; Y = A[\alpha K^\gamma + (1-\alpha) L^\gamma]^{\frac{1}{\gamma}} &lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\gamma \isin [-\infty,1]&lt;/math&gt; 

::which includes the special cases of:

::*Linear production (or perfect substitutes) 
::::&lt;math&gt;\ Y=A[\alpha K+ (1-\alpha) L]&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\ \gamma=1&lt;/math&gt;
::*[[Cobb&amp;ndash;Douglas production function ]] (or imperfect complements) 
::::&lt;math&gt;\ Y=AK^\alpha L^{1-\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\gamma \to 0&lt;/math&gt;
::*[[Leontief production function]] (or perfect complements) 
::::&lt;math&gt;\ Y=\text{Min}[K,L]&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\gamma \to -\infty&lt;/math&gt;

*[[Translog]], a linear approximation of CES via a [[Taylor series|Taylor polynomial]] about &lt;math&gt;\gamma = 0&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\ln(Y)=\ln(A)+a_L \ln(L)+a_K \ln(K)+b_{LL}\ln^2(L) + b_{LK} \ln(L) \ln(K) + b_{KK} \ln^2(K)&lt;/math&gt;

*Stone-Gerry,a variation of the Cobb-Douglas production function that considers existence of a threshold factor requirement (represented by &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;) of each output 
::&lt;math&gt;Y=A\prod_{i=1}^n(x_i-z_i)^\alpha_{i}&lt;/math&gt;

*Zellener-Revankar Production Function (ZRPF)
::&lt;math&gt;\ln Y+\alpha Y=\beta_0+\beta_1 \ln K+ \beta_2 \ln L &lt;/math&gt;

Elmes was born on 5 May 1908 in [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] to [[chemist]] Edward Elmes and Elizabeth (née Waters).  Edward Elmes was originally from [[Waterford]], and moved to Cork after qualifying as a pharmacist, to run a pharmacy on Winthrop Street, while Waters grew up in Cork.&lt;ref name="IrishExaminer1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IrishTimes3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IrishTimes4"/&gt; She had one brother, John, who later took over the family business.&lt;ref name="IrishExaminer1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CorkChamber"/&gt;

Elmes attended Rochelle School in Cork and then in 1928 enrolled at [[Trinity College, Dublin]] where she was [[List of Scholars of Trinity College, Dublin|elected a Scholar]], and gained a first in Modern Literature (French and Spanish).&lt;ref name="IrishTimes2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Butler|first1=Patrick|title=Cork woman receives first Irish honour for saving Jewish victims of the Holocaust|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/cork-woman-receives-first-irish-honour-for-saving-jewish-victims-of-the-holocaust-1.1393486|website=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=22 April 2017|date=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IrishTimes3"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Butler|first1=Paddy|title=Corkwoman helped Jewish brothers and many others avoid Auschwitz|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/corkwoman-helped-jewish-brothers-and-many-others-avoid-auschwitz-1.454767|website=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=22 April 2017|language=en-IE|date=31 Jan 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IrishTimes4"/&gt; In 1935, as a result of her academic achievements, Elmes was awarded a scholarship in International Studies to study at [[London School of Economics]].

===Spanish Civil War===
In February 1937, after the completion of her studies, Elmes joined the [[University of London]] Ambulance Unit and was sent to a children's hospital in Almeria in then war-torn Spain.&lt;ref name="ToulouseQuakers"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crossey|first1=Ciaran|title=Irish non-combatants in Spain during the SCW|url=http://irelandscw.com/docs-NonCom.htm|website=irelandscw.com|accessdate=23 April 2017|language=en-IE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CorkChamber"/&gt;

===Imprisonment===
In January&lt;ref name="IrishTimes2"/&gt; (or February&lt;ref name="WestCorkTimes"/&gt;) 1943, Elmes was arrested on suspicion of aiding the escape of Jews&lt;ref name="IrishTimes2"/&gt; and was imprisoned in [[Toulouse]],&lt;ref name="WestCorkTimes"/&gt; later being moved to the notorious [[Fresnes Prison]] near [[Paris]], where she spent six months.&lt;ref name="WestCorkTimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IrishTimes2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IrishTimes4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ellis|first1=Fiona|title=Meet the 'Irish Oskar Schindler' who saved countless Jews from Nazis|url=https://www.thesun.ie/archives/irish-news/226012/meet-the-irish-oskar-schindler-who-saved-countless-jews-from-nazis/|website=[[The Irish Sun]]|accessdate=23 April 2017|language=en-IE|date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CorkChamber"/&gt;

==Honours==

'''''Mediaweek''''' was a New York–based [[trade magazine]] owned by [[e5 Global Media]]. It is part of Adweek Media Group, which in October 2008 announced the merging of its three separate editorial teams (''[[Adweek]]'', ''[[Brandweek]]'' and Mediaweek) into one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/aw/content_display/news/media/e3ic7f8e4e0a6055a53d49919f58b2acd22|title=AdweekMedia Announces Reorganization|last=Adweek Media Group|date=2008-10-21|work=Adweek|publisher=[[Nielsen Company]]|accessdate=2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, ''Mediaweek'' and ''Brandweek'' were merged into Adweek.

The chief editor was Michael Burgi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/21/AR2008102101690.html?nav=hcmodule|title=Nielsen Reorgs Adweek, Brandweek, Mediaweek; Layoffs; Why Three Anymore?|last=Ali|first=Rafat|date=2008-10-21|work=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Katharine Weymouth]]|accessdate=2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mediaweek'' was founded in January 1991 by BPI Publications, parent company of ''Billboard''. The founding editors were Craig Reiss and Bill Gloede. Reiss became the editor-in-chief of parent Adweek Magazines in April of that year. Gloede became editor and remained until 2002, at which time Brian Moran, the magazine's former executive editor, moved up to editor. He was succeeded by Burgi in 2004. The magazine was initially focused on the media buying and selling communities but in 1993–94 was expanded to cover all aspects of media. Circulation was roughly half paid (the media), and half controlled (to the advertising buying community), with a total of approximately 22,000 subscribers. A two-person Washington D.C. bureau was established in 1994 and a four-person bureau was opened in Los Angeles to cover the television production studios. Ten reporters and editors were based in the New York headquarters. Until the middle 2000s, each weekly edition of the magazine featured the "Media Person" column by Lewis Grossberger, which began its life in ''7 Days'' magazine, which was printed at the time by the publisher of the ''[[Village Voice]]'' in order to compete against ''New York Magazine''.

In 1981, at the age of 30, Shamir purchased 50% of the company's shares and changed its name to Mivtach Shamir Holdings Ltd. In 1992 Shamir went on to purchase the remaining shares of the company, thus becoming its sole owner and director. In the following years, Shamir sold the company's insurance business,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.themarker.com/magazine/1.2302699|title=מפת הקשרים של מאיר שמיר|work=TheMarker|access-date=2017-08-20|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt; turning it into an internationally active Israel-based investment company that invests mainly in technology and communications, real estate and industrial companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=MISH.TA|title=${Instrument_CompanyName} ${Instrument_Ric}  Company Profile {{!}} Reuters.com|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|website=U.S.|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Shamir's leadership the company's market value in the stock exchange grew from 20 million NIS (approx. $5.6&amp;nbsp;million) in 1992 to 830&amp;nbsp;million NIS (approx. $230&amp;nbsp;million) by Jun/2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tase.co.il/Heb/General/Company/Pages/companyHistoryData.aspx?subDataType=0&amp;companyID=000127&amp;shareID=00127019|title=אתר הבורסה – נתונים היסטורים|website=www.tase.co.il|language=he-il|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Institutes of Health''' ('''NIH''') ({{IPAc-en|ɛ|n|aɪ|ˈ|eɪ|tʃ}}; each letter separately) is the primary agency of the [[United States government]] responsible for [[biomedical]] and [[public health]] research. It was founded in the late 1870s and is now part of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]. The majority of NIH facilities are located in [[Bethesda, Maryland]]. The NIH conducts its own scientific research through its [[NIH Intramural Research Program|Intramural Research Program]] (IRP) and provides major biomedical research funding to non-NIH research facilities through its Extramural Research Program.

{{As of| 2013}}, the IRP had 1,200 [[principal investigator]]s and more than 4,000 [[postdoctoral]] fellows in basic, translational, and clinical research, being the largest biomedical research institution in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://irp.nih.gov/about-us/organization-and-leadership |title=Organization and Leadership &amp;#124; NIH Intramural Research Program |publisher=Irp.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-04-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424005609/http://irp.nih.gov/about-us/organization-and-leadership |archivedate=April 24, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while, as of 2003, the extramural arm provided 28% of biomedical research funding spent annually in the U.S., or about US$26.4 billion.&lt;ref name="Medical Research Spending Doubled Over Past Decade"&gt;{{cite web |first=Neil |last=Osterweil |url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/HealthPolicy/1767 |title=Medical Research Spending Doubled Over Past Decade |website=MedPage Today |date=September 20, 2005 |accessdate=2015-09-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016073042/http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/HealthPolicy/1767 |archivedate=October 16, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NIH comprises [[List of institutes and centers of the National Institutes of Health|27 separate institutes and centers]] of different biomedical disciplines and is responsible for many scientific accomplishments, including the discovery of fluoride to prevent [[tooth decay]], the use of [[lithium]] to manage [[bipolar disorder]], and the creation of vaccines against [[hepatitis]], ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' (HIB), and [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV).&lt;ref&gt;NIH Sourcebook {{cite web |url=http://sourcebook.od.nih.gov/oir/IRP_transition.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105120850/http://sourcebook.od.nih.gov/oir/IRP_transition.pdf |archivedate=January 5, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NIH's roots extend back to the [[Marine Hospital Service]] in the late 1790s that provided medical relief to sick and disabled men in the U.S. Navy. By 1870, a network of marine hospitals had developed and was placed under the charge of a medical officer within the Bureau of the Treasury Department. In the late 1870s, Congress allocated funds to investigate the causes of epidemics like cholera and yellow fever, and it created the National Board of Health, making [[medical research]] an official government initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|NIH Almanac|2011|loc=[http://www.nih.gov/about/almanac/historical/chronology_of_events.htm#eighteenhundred History: Chronology of Events: 1800–]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1887, a laboratory for the study of bacteria, the Hygienic Laboratory, was established at the Marine Hospital in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.nih.gov/exhibits/history/index.html |title=A Short History of the National Institutes of Health (1 of 13) |publisher=history.nih.gov |accessdate=2011-05-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515022655/http://history.nih.gov/exhibits/history/index.html |archivedate=May 15, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/industries/Public-Administration/Administration-Public-Health-Programs.html |title=SIC 9431 Administration of Public Health Programs |publisher=Referenceforbusiness.com |accessdate=2011-05-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510114137/http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/industries/Public-Administration/Administration-Public-Health-Programs.html |archivedate=May 10, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1900s, Congress began appropriating funds for the Marine Hospital Service. By 1922, this organization changed its name to Public Health Services and established a Special Cancer Investigations laboratory at [[Harvard Medical School]]. This marked the beginning of a partnership with universities. In 1930, the Hygienic Laboratory was re-designated as the National Institute of Health by the [[Ransdell Act]], and was given $750,000 to construct two NIH buildings. Over the next few decades, Congress would increase funding tremendously to the NIH, and various institutes and centers within the NIH were created for specific research programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|NIH Almanac|2011|loc=[http://www.nih.gov/about/almanac/historical/chronology_of_events.htm#nineteenten History: Chronology of Events: 1900–]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, the [[Public Health Service Act]] was approved, and the [[National Cancer Institute]] became a division of NIH. In 1948, the name changed from National Institute of Health to National Institutes of Health.

In the 1960s, virologist and cancer researcher [[Chester M. Southam]] injected [[HeLa]] cancer cells into patients at the Jewish Chronic Disease Hospital.&lt;ref name="Broadway Paperbacks"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skloot|first1=Rebecca|title=The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks|date=2010|publisher=Broadway Paperbacks|location=New York|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|130}} When three doctors resigned after refusing to inject patients without their consent, the experiment gained considerable media attention.&lt;ref name="Broadway Paperbacks"/&gt;{{rp|133}} The NIH was a major source of funding for Southam’s research and had required all research involving human subjects to obtain their consent prior to any experimentation.&lt;ref name="Broadway Paperbacks"/&gt;{{rp|135}} Upon investigating all of their grantee institutions, the NIH discovered that the majority of them did not protect the rights of human subjects. From then on, the NIH has required all grantee institutions to approve any research proposals involving human experimentation with review boards.&lt;ref name="Broadway Paperbacks"/&gt;{{rp|135}}

In 1967, the Division of Regional Medical Programs was created to administer grants for research for heart disease, cancer, and strokes. That same year, the NIH director lobbied the White House for increased federal funding in order to increase research and the speed with which health benefits could be brought to the people. An advisory committee was formed to oversee further development of the NIH and its research programs. By 1971 cancer research was in full force and President Nixon signed the [[National Cancer Act]], initiating a National Cancer Program, President's Cancer Panel, National Cancer Advisory Board, and 15 new research, training, and demonstration centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=History of the National Cancer Institute| publisher=National Cancer Institute{{snd}}National Institutes of Health| url=https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/overview/history#1971| accessdate=June 29, 2017| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628185858/https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/overview/history#1971| archivedate=June 28, 2017| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for the NIH has often been a source of contention in Congress, serving as a proxy for the political currents of the time. In 1992, the NIH encompassed nearly 1 percent of the federal government's operating budget and controlled more than 50 percent of all funding for health research, and 85 percent of all funding for health studies in universities.&lt;ref name="Laurie J. Price 1992 128–146"&gt;{{cite journal|title= A Medical Anthropologist's Ruminations on NIH Funding|author=Laurie J. Price |journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly, New Series| volume= 6| issue= 2| year=1992 | pages= 128–146 |jstor=649307}}&lt;/ref&gt; While government funding for research in other disciplines has been increasing at a rate similar to inflation since the 1970s, research funding for the NIH nearly tripled through the 1990s and early 2000s, but has remained relatively stagnant since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Trends in Federal R&amp;D|url=https://www.aaas.org/page/historical-trends-federal-rd|website=AAAS - The World's Largest General Scientific Society|language=en|date=11 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180110055211/https://www.aaas.org/page/historical-trends-federal-rd|archivedate=January 10, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1990s, the NIH committee focus had shifted to DNA research, and launched the [[Human Genome Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.genome.gov/25520329/online-education-kit-1990-launch-of-the-human-genome-project/|title=Online Education Kit: 1990: Launch of the Human Genome Project|website=National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations and campuses==
Intramural research is primarily conducted at the [[National Institutes of Health campus|main campus]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland]] and [[Rockville, Maryland]], and the surrounding communities.

The Bayview Campus in [[Baltimore]], Maryland houses the research programs of the [[National Institute on Aging]], [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]], and [[National Human Genome Research Institute]] with nearly 1,000 scientists and support staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://irp.nih.gov/about-us/research-campus-locations/bayview-campus|title=Bayview Campus|author=|date=May 8, 2013|website=nih.gov|accessdate=May 7, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905035824/https://irp.nih.gov/about-us/research-campus-locations/bayview-campus|archivedate=September 5, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Frederick National Laboratory]] in [[Frederick, MD]] and the nearby Riverside Research Park, houses many components of the [[National Cancer Institute]], including the Center for Cancer Research, Office of Scientific Operations, Management Operations Support Branch, the division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics and the division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCI at Frederick: About the NCI at Frederick|url=https://ncifrederick.cancer.gov/about/|website=ncifrederick.cancer.gov|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180110054811/https://ncifrederick.cancer.gov/about/|archivedate=January 10, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences]] is located in the [[Research Triangle]] region of [[North Carolina]].

Other ICs have satellite locations in addition to operations at the main campus. The [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]] maintains its Rocky Mountain Labs in [[Hamilton, Montana]],&lt;ref name="NIAD Overview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/about/organization/dir/overview.htm |title=Division of Intramural Research Overview |publisher=National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases |date=September 1, 2010 |accessdate=2015-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308040208/https://www3.niaid.nih.gov/about/organization/dir/overview.htm |archivedate=March 8, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an emphasis on [[Biosafety level|BSL3]] and BSL4 laboratory work. NIDKK operates the Phoenix Epidemiology and Clinical Research Branch in [[Phoenix, AZ]].

As of 2017, 153 scientists receiving financial support from the NIH have been awarded a [[Nobel Prize]] and 195 have been awarded a [[Lasker Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lasker Awards|url=https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/nih-almanac/lasker-awards|website=National Institutes of Health (NIH)|language=en|date=5 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705023514/https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/nih-almanac/lasker-awards|archivedate=July 5, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intramural research ===
NIH devotes 10% of its funding to research within its own facilities (intramural research). The institution gives 80% of its funding in [[research grant]]s to extramural (outside) researchers. Of this extramural funding, a certain percentage (2.8% in 2014) must be granted to small businesses under the [[Small Business Innovation Research|SBIR/STTR]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garland|first=Eva|title=Winning SBIR/STTR Grants: A Ten Week Plan for Preparing Your NIH Phase I Application|date=2014|isbn=978-1494784447}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The extramural funding consists of about 50,000 grants to more than 325,000 researchers at more than 3000 institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIH Budget|url=http://www.nih.gov/about/budget.htm|website=National Institutes of Health|publisher=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=2011-08-26|date=May 23, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826201557/http://www.nih.gov/about/budget.htm|archivedate=August 26, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2010|alt=In [[fiscal year|FY]] 2010}}, NIH spent {{US$|10.7bn}} (not including temporary funding from the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]) on [[clinical research]], {{US$|7.4bn}} on [[genetics]]-related research, {{US$|6.0bn}} on prevention research, {{US$|5.8bn}} on cancer, and {{US$|5.7bn}} on [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref name=researchfunding&gt;{{cite web|title=Estimates of Funding for Various Research, Condition, and Disease Categories (RCDC) |url=http://report.nih.gov/rcdc/categories/Default.aspx |website=Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools |publisher=National Institutes of Health |accessdate=2011-08-26 |date=March 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813065343/http://report.nih.gov/rcdc/categories/Default.aspx |archivedate=August 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public Access Policy===
{{main|NIH Public Access Policy}}
In 2008 a Congressional mandate called for investigators funded by the NIH to submit an electronic version of their final manuscripts to the [[National Library of Medicine]]'s research repository, [[PubMed Central]] (PMC), no later than 12 months after the official date of publication.&lt;ref name="NIH Public Access Policy"&gt;{{cite web|last=National Institutes of Health|title=NIH Public Access Policy Details|url=http://publicaccess.nih.gov/policy.htm|publisher=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=January 30, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62vO48RCv?url=http://publicaccess.nih.gov/policy.htm|archivedate=November 3, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[NIH Public Access Policy]] was the first public access mandate for a U.S. public funding agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suber|first=Peter|title=An open access mandate for the National Institutes of Health|journal=Open Medicine|date=April 16, 2008|volume=2|issue=2|pages=e39–41|pmc=3090178|pmid=21602938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NIH Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee===
On February 13, 2012, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced a new group of individuals assigned to research pain. This committee is composed of researchers from different organizations and will focus to "coordinate pain research activities across the federal government with the goals of stimulating pain research collaboration… and providing an important avenue for public involvement" ("Members of new," 2012). With a committee such as this research will not be conducted by each individual organization or person but instead a collaborating group which will increase the information available. With this hopefully more pain management will be available including techniques for arthritis sufferers.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Economic return===
In 2000, the Joint Economic Committee of Congress reported NIH research, which was funded at $16 billion a year in 2000, that some econometric studies had given a rate of return of 25 to 40 percent per year by reducing the economic cost of illness in the US. It found that of the 21 drugs with the highest therapeutic impact on society introduced between 1965 and 1992, public funding was "instrumental" for 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=U.S. Joint Economic Committee |date=May 2000 |url=http://www.faseb.org/portals/2/pdfs/opa/2008/nih_research_benefits.pdf |title=The Benefits of Medical Research and the Role of the NIH |accessdate=2011-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412003136/http://www.faseb.org/portals/2/pdfs/opa/2008/nih_research_benefits.pdf |archivedate=April 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011 NIH-supported research helped to discover 153 new FDA-approved drugs, vaccines, and new indications for drugs in the 40 years prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stevens |first=A.

===Notable discoveries and developments ===
Since its inception, the NIH intramural research program has been a source of many pivotal scientific and medical discoveries. Some of these include:
* 1908 – [[George W. McCoy]]'s discovery that rodents were a reservoir of [[bubonic plague]].
* 1911 – George W. McCoy, Charles W. Chapin, William B. Wherry, and B. H. Lamb described the previously-unknown [[tularemia]].
* 1924 – Roscoe R. Spencer and Ralph R. Parker developed a vaccine against [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]].
* 1930 – Sanford M. Rosenthal developed a treatment for [[mercury poisoning]] used widely before the development of dimercaptoethanol.
* 1943 – Wilton R. Earle pioneered the [[cell culture]] process and published a paper describing the production of malignancy in vitro, Katherine K. Sanford developed the first clone from an isolated cancer cell, and Virginia J. Evans devised a medium that supported growth of cells in vitro.

====NIH Toolbox====
In September 2006, the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research started a contract for the [[NIH Toolbox]] for the Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function to develop a set of state-of-the-art measurement tools to enhance collection of data in large cohort studies. Scientists from more than 100 institutions nationwide contributed. In September 2012, the NIH Toolbox was rolled out to the research community. NIH Toolbox assessments are based, where possible, on [[Item Response Theory]] and adapted for testing by computer.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

To allocate funds, the NIH must first obtain its budget from Congress. This process begins with institute and center (IC) leaders collaborating with scientists to determine the most important and promising research areas within their fields. IC leaders discuss research areas with NIH management who then develops a budget request for continuing projects, new research proposals, and new initiatives from the Director. NIH submits its budget request to the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS), and the HHS considers this request as a portion of its budget. Many adjustments and appeals occur between NIH and HHS before the agency submits NIH's budget request to the [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB).  OMB determines what amounts and research areas are approved for incorporation into the President's final budget. The President then sends NIH's budget request to Congress in February for the next fiscal year's allocations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Funding|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33695.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060502/http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33695.pdf|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees deliberate and by fall, Congress usually appropriates funding. This process takes approximately 18 months before the NIH can allocate any actual funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Funding|url=http://officeofbudget.od.nih.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111207114012/http://officeofbudget.od.nih.gov/|archivedate=December 7, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Historical funding ====
Over the last century, the responsibility to allocate funding has shifted from the OD and Advisory Committee to the individual ICs and Congress increasingly set apart funding for particular causes. In the 1970s, Congress began to earmark funds specifically for cancer research, and in the 1980s there was a significant amount allocated for AIDS/HIV research.&lt;ref name="Funding" /&gt;

Funding for the NIH has often been a source of contention in Congress, serving as a proxy for the political currents of the time. During the 1980s, President Reagan repeatedly tried to cut funding for research, only to see Congress partly restore funding. The political contention over NIH funding slowed the nation's response to the AIDS epidemic; while AIDS was reported in newspaper articles from 1981, no funding was provided for research on the disease. In 1984 National Cancer Institute scientists found implications that "variants of a human cancer virus called HTLV-III are the primary cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)," a new epidemic that gripped the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|NIH Almanac|2011|loc=[http://www.nih.gov/about/almanac/historical/chronology_of_events.htm#nineteeneighty History: Chronology of Events: 1980–]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1992, the NIH encompassed nearly 1 percent of the federal government's operating budget and controlled more than 50 percent of all funding for health research and 85 percent of all funding for health studies in universities.&lt;ref name="Laurie J. Price 1992 128–146"/&gt; From 1993 to 2001 the NIH budget doubled. Since then, funding essentially remained flat, and during the decade following the financial crisis, the NIH budget struggled to keep up with inflation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/nih-almanac/appropriations-section-1 NIH Appropriations (Section 1)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170507125120/https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/nih-almanac/appropriations-section-1 |date=May 7, 2017 }} and [https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/nih-almanac/appropriations-section-2 NIH Appropriations (Section 2)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105133440/https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/nih-almanac/appropriations-section-2 |date=January 5, 2018 }} 7 April 2016, retrieved 4 May 2016, U.S. Department of Health and Human Service&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extramural research===
{{main|NIH grant}}
Researchers at universities or other institutions outside of NIH can apply for [[NIH grants|research project grants]] (RPGs) from the NIH. There are numerous funding mechanisms for different project types (e.g., basic research, clinical research etc.) and career stages (e.g., early career, postdoc fellowships etc.). The NIH regularly issues "requests for applications" (RFAs), e.g., on timely medical problems (such as [[Zika virus]] research in early 2016). In addition, researchers can apply for "investigator-initiated grants" whose subject is determined by the scientist.

The total number of applicants has increased substantially, from about 60,000 investigators who had applied during the period from 1999 to 2003 to slightly less than 90,000 in who had applied during the period from 2011 to 2015.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2016/05/31/how-many-researchers/|title=How Many Researchers?|last=Lauer|first=Mike|date=31 May 2016|website=Open Mike|publisher=NIH|access-date=6 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825174823/https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2016/05/31/how-many-researchers/|archivedate=August 25, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, the "cumulative investigator rate," that is, the likelihood that unique investigators are funded over a 5-year window, has declined from 43% to 31%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

R01 grants are the most common funding mechanism and include investigator-initiated projects. The roughly 27,000 to 29,000 R01 applications had a funding success of 17-19% during 2012 though 2014. Similarly, the 13,000 to 14,000 R21 applications had a funding success of 13-14% during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2015/04/10/looking-at-recent-data-on-r21-and-r01-equivalent-grants/|title=Looking at Recent Data on R21 and R01-equivalent Grants|last=Rockey|first=Sally|date=10 April 2015|website=Rock Talk|publisher=NIH|access-date=2 Oct 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008215446/https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2015/04/10/looking-at-recent-data-on-r21-and-r01-equivalent-grants/|archivedate=October 8, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In FY 2016, the total number of grant applications received by the NIH was 54,220, with approximately 19% being awarded funding.&lt;ref name=2016funding&gt;{{cite web|title=NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools (RePORT)|url=https://report.nih.gov/success_rates/Success_ByIC.cfm|website=report.nih.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202133251/https://report.nih.gov/success_rates/Success_ByIC.cfm|archivedate=February 2, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Institutes have varying funding rates. The National Cancer Institute awarded funding to 12% of applicants, while the National Institute for General Medical Science awarded funding to 30% of applicants.&lt;ref name=2016funding/&gt;

===Funding criteria===
NIH employs five broad decision criteria in its funding policy. First, ensure the highest quality of scientific research by employing an arduous peer review process. Second, seize opportunities that have the greatest potential to yield new knowledge and that will lead to better prevention and treatment of disease. Third, maintain a diverse research portfolio in order to capitalize on major discoveries in a variety of fields such as cell biology, genetics, physics, engineering, and computer science. Fourth, address public health needs according to the disease burden (e.g., prevalence and mortality). And fifth, construct and support the scientific infrastructure (e.g., well-equipped laboratories and safe research facilities) necessary to conduct research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Statement on Funding Allocation for Disease Research by Harold Varmus, M. D., Director, National Institutes of Health |publisher=Assistant Secretary for Legislation, Department of Health and Human Services |url=https://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/t990506a.htm |date=May 6, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advisory committee members advise the Institute on policy and procedures affecting the external research programs and provide a second level of review for all grant and cooperative agreement applications considered by the Institute for funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/find_people/nands/index.htm |title=National Advisory Neurological Disorders and Stroke Council (NANDSC) |publisher=Ninds.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-04-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428004009/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/find_people/nands/index.htm |archivedate=April 28, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender and sex bias====

In 2014, it was announced that the NIH is directing scientists to perform their experiments with both female and male animals, or cells derived from females as well as males if they are studying cell cultures, and that the NIH would take the balance of each study design into consideration when awarding grants.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |first=Roni Caryn |last=Rabin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/15/health/nih-tells-researchers-to-end-sex-bias-in-early-studies.html |title=Labs Are Told to Start Including a Neglected Variable: Females |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 14, 2014 |accessdate=2015-09-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906202122/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/15/health/nih-tells-researchers-to-end-sex-bias-in-early-studies.html |archivedate=September 6, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement also stated that this rule would probably not apply when studying sex-specific diseases (for example, ovarian or testicular cancer).&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

===Government shutdown===

When a [[government shutdown in the United States|government shutdown]] occurs, the NIH continues to treat people who are already enrolled in [[clinical trial]]s, but does not start any new clinical trials and does not admit new patients who are not already enrolled in a clinical trial, except for the most critically ill,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/10/health/in-shutdown-clinical-trial-enrollment-slows-but-doesnt-halt.html|title=Clinical Trials Continue, but Only at a Crawl|author=Sabrina Tavernese|publisher=New York Times|date=October 9, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027053456/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/10/health/in-shutdown-clinical-trial-enrollment-slows-but-doesnt-halt.html|archivedate=October 27, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lauran|last=Neergaard|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/10/09/nih-admits-a-dozen-critic_n_4073447.html|title=NIH admits a dozen critically ill, making exceptions to no-new-patient policy during shutdown|work=Huffington Post|agency=[[The Associated Press]]|date=October 9, 2013|accessdate=2015-09-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301013202/http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/10/09/nih-admits-a-dozen-critic_n_4073447.html|archivedate=March 1, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2013/10/02/government-slimdown-blocks-some-seeking-nih-research-treatment/|title=Government slimdown blocks some seeking NIH research treatment|work=[[Fox News Channel]]|agency=The Associated Press|date=October 2, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005124430/http://www.foxnews.com/health/2013/10/02/government-slimdown-blocks-some-seeking-nih-research-treatment/|archivedate=October 5, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as determined by the NIH Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/budget/fy2014/fy2014contingency_staffing_plan-rev6.pdf |title=Department of Health and Human Services Fiscal Year 2014 Contingency Staffing Plan for Operations in the Absence of Enacted Annual Appropriations |format=pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028125958/http://www.hhs.gov/budget/fy2014/fy2014contingency_staffing_plan-rev6.pdf |archivedate=October 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stakeholders===

====General public====
One of the goals of the NIH is to "expand the base in medical and associated sciences in order to ensure a continued high return on the public investment in research."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stakeholders|url=http://www.nih.gov/about/mission.htm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125135014/http://www.nih.gov/about/mission.htm|archivedate=November 25, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Taxpayer dollars funding NIH are from the taxpayers, making them the primary beneficiaries of advances in research. Thus, the general public is a key stakeholder in the decisions resulting from the NIH funding policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stakeholders |url=http://acd.od.nih.gov/Roster.asp |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114231545/http://acd.od.nih.gov/Roster.asp |archivedate=November 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some in the general public do not feel their interests are being represented, and individuals have formed patient advocacy groups to represent their own interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stakeholders|url=https://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/t990506a.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104113818/http://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/t990506a.html|archivedate=November 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Extramural researchers and scientists====
Important stakeholders of the NIH funding policy include researchers and scientists. Extramural researchers differ from intramural researchers in that they are not employed by the NIH but may apply for funding. Throughout the history of the NIH, the amount of funding received has increased, but the proportion to each IC remains relatively constant. The individual ICs then decide who will receive the grant money and how much will be allotted.

Policy changes on who receives funding significantly affects researchers. For example, the NIH has recently attempted to approve more first-time NIH R01 applicants, or the research grant applications of young scientists. To encourage the participation of young scientists, the application process has been shortened and made easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Science |year=2008 |volume=322 |issue=5905 |pages=1187–8 |doi=10.1126/science.322.5905.1187c |title=Changes to NIH grant system may backfire |vauthors=Karp PD, Sherlock G, Gerlt JA, Sim I, Paulsen I, Babbitt PC, Laderoute K, Hunter L, Sternberg P, Wooley J, Bourne PE |pmid=19023064}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, first-time applicants are being offered more funding for their research grants than those who have received grants in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Acad Med |date=May 2010 |volume=85 |issue=5 |pages=775–9 |doi=10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181d74256 |pmid=20520024 |title=Perspective: is NIH funding the "best science by the best scientists"? A critique of the NIH R01 research grant review policies |author=Costello LC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial partnerships==
In 2011 and 2012, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General published a series of audit reports revealing that throughout the fiscal years 2000–2010, institutes under the aegis of the NIH did not comply with the time and amount requirements specified in appropriations statutes, in awarding federal contracts to commercial partners, committing the federal government to tens of millions of dollars of expenditure ahead of appropriation of funds from Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region3/31003120.pdf | title = Appropriations Funding for National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Contract N01-AI-15416 With the University of California at San Francisco Audit (A-03-10-03120) | accessdate = 2011-06-25 | date = June 2011 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111015190017/http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region3/31003120.pdf | archivedate = October 15, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}

[[File:Norwest Lake.jpg|thumb|Norwest Lake, Norwest Business Park]]
The '''Norwest Business Park''' is a [[business park]] in the suburb of [[Norwest, New South Wales|Norwest]] in [[Local government areas of New South Wales|local government area]] of [[The Hills Shire]] in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. Norwest Business Park is bordered by [[Windsor Road (Sydney)|Windsor Road]] to the East, and Old Windsor Road to the West, with Norwest Boulevard stretching the length of the park between the two main arterial roads. It is growing every day with new companies moving in to serve the people of the [[Hills District]]. Over 400 companies are located in the park employing more than 25,000 people. The complex consists of a mix of Commercial, Professional &amp; Health care Services and several office buildings.

Australia's largest ice-skating rink, a [[Shopping mall|shopping centre]], [[Novotel]] hotel, two [[Filling station|service stations]], [[Hillsong Church]], [[Virgin Active]] gym, alternative health services, medical centre, commercial law firm [[HWL Ebsworth]], banks, child care centres, drive-through post office, waterways and landscaped public open spaces are all located within the Business Park. Projected employment is 32,000 by 2031. The park is 172 Hectares in area and currently has 800 businesses. Occupied space is currently 500,000m² with Potential for a total of 1.7 million m².

==History==
The park was established in 1983, during the Sydney housing boom. Farms had previously occupied the area.  The park grew with the expanding population of the area, and the first business to be constructed was the Baulkham Hills Coles supermarket, known as Norwest Markettown.

The expansion of the Hillsong Church in the area saw a corresponding expansion in the businesses of the area. In 2005, the [[Woolworths Limited]] head office was constructed, and now employs several thousand staff. Cafes and restaurants also serve the park.

Other large scale corporations in the Norwest Business Park include ResMed, [[Australian Associated Motor Insurers Limited|AAMI Insurance]], [[Fitness First]] gym, and one of the [[Reserve Bank of Australia]]'s data centers.

[[Subaru]] Australia has an office in Baulkham Hills part of this business area.

Norwest also houses Australia's largest law firm (by partner numbers), [[HWL Ebsworth|HWL Ebsworth Lawyers]], being the only national firm with a presence in Greater Western Sydney.

The park was conceived &amp; developed by Douglas Boyd Lanceley.

==Transport==
The main form of transport to the business park is by bus or by cycling on the off-road Old Windsor Road Cycleway. In late 2005, the [[Westlink M7]] Motorway opened up with an exit at the western end of Norwest Boulevard; this gave the business park greater exposure for businesses in Southern and Western Sydney with motorway exits at the M5 at Prestons and the M4 at Eastern Creek respectively.  The [[M2 Hills Motorway]] (which connects with the M7 near Old Windsor Road) also provides travel connections to the Sydney CBD and airport. However the increase of traffic flow from the motorways brought traffic congestion. Norwest Boulevard, Windsor and Old Windsor Roads often suffer traffic jams during morning and afternoon peak times.

===North-West T-Way===
{{Main|North-West T-way}}
In late March 2007, the North West T-Way opened, providing relief to the traffic congested business park. The T-Way runs from [[Parramatta]] to Rouse Hill. The T-Way provides frequent bus services between Parramatta and Rouse Hill, promoting the use of public transport in and around Sydney. The route runs primarily along Old Windsor Road with several stops. Three T-way bus stations serve Norwest Business Park; Norbrik (near the corner of Old Windsor Road and Norbrik Drive), Meurants (near the corner of Old Windsor Road and Norwest Boulevard and Celebration (near the corner of Old Windsor Road and Celebration Drive). [[Hillsbus]] Route T64 between Parramatta and Rouse Hill travels through the business park seven days a week. Hillsbus also operate route 618 from the [[Sydney CBD]] via [[Lane Cove]] and route 628 from [[Macquarie Park]] via the M2, Windsor Road through Norwest Boulevard to Lexington Drive. Busways operate Route T70 through Norwest Business Park, linking with Castle Hill and Blacktown.

The North West T-Way also runs from Blacktown to Rouse Hill, running along Sunnyholt Road before joining the Parramatta - Rouse Hill T-Way at Burns Road. Until the [[North West Rail Link]] is constructed, the T-Way is the only form of public transport linking the park with Blacktown and Parramatta train stations.

The EIS for the construction of two underground railway stations for [http://northwestrail.com.au North West Rail]
was released in April 2012 with construction expected to start in 2014. Construction of the rail link commenced in 2014, with two railway stations being built in the Norwest Business Park area - Bella Vista Station and Norwest Station. The North West Rail Link is scheduled to open to the public in the first half of 2019.&lt;ref&gt;http://nwrail.transport.nsw.gov.au/The-Project/Project-Overview&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Playboy: The Mansion''''' is a [[simulation game|simulation]] [[video game]] for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] consoles, developed by [[Cyberlore Studios]], published by [[Groove Games]] and [[Arush Entertainment]] and licensed by [[Playboy Enterprises]].

==Gameplay==

''Playboy: The Mansion'' puts players in the role of [[Hugh Hefner]], the founder of ''[[Playboy]]'' Magazine and [[Playboy Enterprises]], referred to in the game as 'Hef'. The aim of the game is to build the famed Playboy Empire from scratch, starting from a humble magazine to celebrity endorsements to home entertainment to Internet websites to merchandise.

The player can mold the famed [[Playboy Mansion]] to their own needs and wants, and has the option of experiencing the infamous ''Playboy'' [[Playboy Playmate|Playmate]] parties in locations such as the Grotto and the Clubhouse. Hef, as well as all other characters in the game, can build three types of relationships with other characters: casual, business, and romantic.  Each month, the player has to print an issue of the magazine.  To do that the player needs a cover shoot, a centerfold, an essay from a celebrity, interview with a celebrity, a pictorial about a subject and an article about a subject.  The player must hire photographers and writers to create each issue.  All the characters have interests, such as sports and music, and writers on those topics will produce higher-quality articles. In the game, the player is the photographer during photo shoots. The game contains many sexual references, including sexual relationships.

There are twelve missions in total. Some of the goals include making and/or fixing relationships with people, publishing certain magazine content, and throwing parties. Players can also choose not to achieve goals, as there is no time limit, and do other things such as parties, mansion renovations and playing with the mansion's variety of games; however, magazines must continue to be published as that is the player's income source.

==Music==
{{Main|Playboy: The Mansion Soundtrack}}

A soundtrack to the game, mixed by [[United States|American]] [[Disc Jockey|DJ]] and [[record producer]] [[Felix da Housecat]] has been released. It features house tracks by many renowned producers like [[Armand Van Helden]], [[DJ Sneak]] or [[Kaskade]].

==Expansion pack==
''Playboy: The Mansion -  Private Party Expansion Pack'' is the expansion pack. It adds extra features such as parties like [[Playboy Mansion#Midsummer Night's Dream Party|Midsummer Night's Dream]], world-famous celebrities and [[Playboy Playmate|Playmate]]s, new animations, enhanced character editing and party-themed music.

===Features===
The expansion adds many new features to the game. When characters engage in sexual activities, they now remove their underwear and their [[Sex organ#Genitals|genitals]] are blurred, much like ''[[The Sims]]'' characters. Another feature is the ability to throw "theme parties", which consist of Halloween, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Hef's Birthday, Tropical, Playmate of the Year and more.

[[GameRankings]] and [[Metacritic]] gave it a score of 60% and 59 out of 100 for the PC version,&lt;ref name=GRPC/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCPC/&gt; 59.97% and 59 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version,&lt;ref name=GRPS2/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCPS2/&gt; and 62.14% and 61 out of 100 for the Xbox version.&lt;ref name=GRXB/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCXB/&gt;

[[Eurogamer]] noted that the game was similar to ''The Sims'' series but was unfortunately less entertaining.  It was considered "a little too slight a proposition for a full game."&lt;ref name=EuroG/&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' gave it a mixed review and stated, "Sex and nudity often work well in movies, but video games laced with sex never rise above mediocrity, and ''Mansion'' seems decidedly underbaked."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/17/technology/circuits/17game.html?ex=1109307600&amp;en=c4214af930777332&amp;ei=5070&amp;_r=0|title=Underneath It All, Substance Sells|last=Herold|first=Charles|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=2005-02-17|accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' gave it two-and-a-half stars out of five and called it "A frisky concept with limited thrills and not enough depth to challenge gamers."&lt;ref name=Sydney&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Games/Playtime-cut-short/2005/03/23/1111525214598.html|title=Playtime cut short|last=Wilcox|first=Mike|publisher=''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''|date=2005-03-25|accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' gave it two stars out of four and stated, "I flipped on the game expecting a world of champagne, roses and frequent wisps of steam.

'''PreTesting Company''' is a full-service [[Market research]] company founded in 1985 that specializes in print, television, and radio ad [[copy testing]].

==History==
PreTesting Company was founded in 1985 by American inventor and market researcher Lee Weinblatt. After beginning his career at Perception Research, Weinblatt started Telcom Research, a company that manufactured recorders that used an infrared beam to track a viewer as he watched a commercial in a research setting. Weinblatt sold the company in 1983.&lt;ref name=NYT1990&gt;Andrews, Edmund L. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0D8163BF931A15754C0A966958260 "Technology;  Delving Into the Consumer Unconscious"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 22, 1990. Accessed December 23rd, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Weinblatt started PreTesting Company in order to provide advertising companies with insights into the effectiveness of their print, radio, and TV ads.&lt;ref&gt;Dougherty, Philip H. [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50E1EFC3B5F167493C0A91789D85F438785F9&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=%22lee%20weinblatt%22%20teaneck&amp;st=cse "Advertising; Approaches to Personnel Search"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 2, 1977. Accessed July 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The company tests subjects in situations where they are unaware of how - and why - they're being tested, ensuring authentic, unbiased results. &lt;ref name=LATIMES1990&gt;Horowitz, Bruce [http://articles.latimes.com/1990-05-15/business/fi-300_1_advertising-research "Advertising Message Often Lost in the Medium, Researchers Say"], ''[[LA Times]]'', May 15th, 1990. Accessed December 23rd, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saccadic Eye Movement==
PreTesting Company’s most advanced innovation to date has been a recording device that tracks movements of the eye, called [[saccade]]s. Through saccadic eye tracking, Pretesting Company can determine not only where a viewer is looking as he’s watching an ad, but also how visually stimulating the ad is.&lt;ref name=CNNMONEY&gt;Wasserman, Todd [http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2007/03/01/8401029/ "An Eyeball Test for Better Ads"], ''[[CNN]]'', April 3rd, 2007. Accessed December 23rd, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; These results can help companies gauge whether their ads are visually stimulating enough to keep the viewers attention, or in contrast, whether they're so visually stimulating that no actual information is absorbed. &lt;ref name=CNNMONEY/&gt;

'''Robert Emmet Brennan''' (born 1944) is an [[United States|America]]n businessman who built the infamous [[penny stock]] brokerage firm, First Jersey Securities. The firm specialized in promoting "[[Pump and dump]]" penny stocks to unsuspecting investors, many of them elderly, who lost their entire investments when the stocks inevitably crashed.

==First Jersey Securities Fraud==

As a result of this penny stock scheme, Brennan became a target of the United States [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]. First Jersey itself went bankrupt in 1987 and Brennan was found guilty of securities fraud in 1994. The US Government ordered him to pay $75 million to settle the fraud claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/25/weekinreview/ideas-trends-hubris-and-the-artifice-of-a-dealer.html | work=The New York Times | title=Ideas &amp; Trends; Hubris And the Artifice of A Dealer | first=Matthew | last=Purdy | date=1995-06-25 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brennan declared bankruptcy in 1995 but committed another fraud when he did not declare all of his assets to the court. Brennan withheld from the bankruptcy court that he held $500,000 in casino chips that he had purchased (and later cashed out of after his bankruptcy) and $4 million in municipal bonds he kept in his basement. He then directed an associate to liquidate the bonds overseas and invest them in stocks, which netted him $16 million in ill-gotten gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/06/sports/sports-of-the-times-greed-and-sheer-gall-catch-up-to-brennan.html | work=The New York Times | title=Sports of The Times; Greed and Sheer Gall Catch Up to Brennan | first=George | last=Vecsey | date=2000-08-06 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/13/nyregion/ex-financier-used-code-names-and-dummy-firms-witness-says.html | work=The New York Times | title=Ex-Financier Used Code Names and Dummy Firms, Witness Says | first=Robert | last=Hanley | date=2001-03-13 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Money Laundering==

In 2001 Brennan was found guilty of [[money-laundering]] and bankruptcy fraud and sentenced to a [[prison]] term of nine years and two months. [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/27/nyregion/jail-term-for-former-penny-stock-tycoon.html] On appeal, in 2003 the sentence was upheld. Brennan served part of his sentence at the US Bureau of Prison's [[Fort Dix#Federal Correctional Institution|Fort Dix Federal Correctional Institution]] in Fort Dix, New Jersey.  He was released on January 14, 2011 from Fort Dix and was sent to another less harsh prison until July which is when he was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.harnessracing.com/news/gspsbobbrennanreleasedfromprison.html  | title=GSP's Bob Brennan is released from prison | work=harnessracing.com | date=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Brennan grew up in [[Newark, New Jersey]], one of nine children. His first wife, Cecelia, was his childhood sweetheart. He attended St Leo's Roman Catholic School in Irvington, and was taught by the School Sisters of Notre Dame, and [[St. Benedict's Preparatory School]] in Newark and in 1973 donated $10 million to the school which allowed it to significantly upgrade its facilities. [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/21/business/us-ruling-may-undercut-brennan-s-other-projects.html] A major benefactor to [[Seton Hall University]], following his conviction the university's Board of Governors had Brennan's name removed from a recreation center on its campus in [[South Orange, New Jersey]].  Brennan is an alumnus of [[Seton Hall University]] and sat on its Board of Regents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/sep2002/nf20020920_9297.htm Business Week article 'Seton Hall of Shame']&lt;/ref&gt;

Brennan was also a [[Certified Public Accountant]] but his license was revoked as a result of his criminal  conviction. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

==Thoroughbred racing==
International Thoroughbred Breeders, Inc., a publicly held company founded and chaired by Brennan, financed the reconstruction of [[Garden State Park]] race track in Cherry Hill, New Jersey after it was taken out by a 1977 fire.  The grandstand reopened in 1985, closed in 2001, was demolished, and the property redeveloped. Brennan also owned and raced [[Thoroughbred]]s under the name Due Process Stable. The best known of his horses were [[Eclipse Award]] winners [[Deputy Minister (horse)|Deputy Minister]] and his son [[Dehere]], who was bred by Brennan. [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DN&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI|DN&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB2A0B810A38D15&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM]

Brennan also built and owned the Due Process Stable Golf Club in [[Colts Neck Township, New Jersey]], where he lived until his arrest in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE5D91E30F931A35752C1A9669C8B63 "Metro Business Briefing; Ex-financier Indicted Again"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 2, 2000.

{{copy edit|for=improvement of English: clearly not written by a native speaker.|date=August 2018}}
In global optimization, a '''state transition algorithm (STA)''' is an [[iterative method]] that generates a sequence of improving approximate solutions for an [[optimization problem]]. Due to its intrinsic properties, an STA has the ability to find a global optimal solution in probability and can guarantee an optimal solution.

The state transition algorithm &lt;ref name=Zhou2012State/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zhou2014Nonlinear/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zhou2016Optimal/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zhou2016Discrete/&gt; was first proposed by Zhou et al. It is a stochastic global optimization method and aims to find a possible global or approximate optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time. In the context of the STA, a solution to an optimization problem is regarded as a state, and updating a solution can be regarded as a state transition. Using the state-space representation,&lt;ref name=Friedland2005Control/&gt; it describes solutions updating in a unified framework, and the execution operators to update solutions are expressed as state transition matrices, which make it easy to understand and flexible to implement:
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k+1} = A_k \mathbf{x}_k + B_k \mathbf{u}_k&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y}_{k+1} = f(\mathbf{x}_{k+1})&lt;/math&gt;
where:
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt; stands for a current state, corresponding to a solution to an optimization problem;
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}_k &lt;/math&gt; is a function of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; and historical states;
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y}_k &lt;/math&gt; is the fitness value at &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k} &lt;/math&gt;;  
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A}_k, \mathbf{B}_k &lt;/math&gt; are state transformation matrices, which can be considered as execution operators; 
:  &lt;math&gt; f(\cdot) &lt;/math&gt; is the objective function or evaluation function. 
As a stochastic global optimization method, STA has the following properties:
* globality, STA has the ability to search the whole space;
* optimality, STA can guarantee to find an optimal solution; 
* convergence, the sequence generated by STA is convergent;
* rapidity, inherent advantages existing in STA to reduce the computational complexity;
* controllability, STA can control the search space flexibly.

== Continuous state transition algorithm (CSTA) ==
In continuous STA, &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_k \in \mathbb{R}^n  &lt;/math&gt; is a continuous variable, and four special state transformation operators are designed to generate new candidate solutions.

=== State transformation operators ===
(1) Rotation transformation (RT)
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_k + \alpha \frac{1}{n\|\mathbf{x}_k\|_2} R_r \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; is a positive constant, called the rotation factor, &lt;math&gt; R_r \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} &lt;/math&gt; is a random matrix with its entries being uniformly distributed random variables defined on the interval [-1,1], and &lt;math&gt; \|\cdot\| &lt;/math&gt; is the 2-norm of a vector. 
The rotation transformation has the functionality to search in a hypersphere with maximal radius &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; , that is to say, &lt;math&gt; \|\mathbf{x}_{k+1} - \mathbf{x}_{k}\|_2 \leq \alpha &lt;/math&gt;.

(2) Translation transformation (TT)
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_k + \beta R_t \frac{\mathbf{x}_k - \mathbf{x}_{k-1}}{\|\mathbf{x}_k - \mathbf{x}_{k-1}\|_2} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; is a positive constant, called the translation factor, and &lt;math&gt; R_t \in  \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;
is a uniformly distributed random variable defined on the interval [0,1]. The translation transformation has the functionality to search along a line from &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k-1} &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt; at the starting point &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt; with maximal length &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt;.

(3) Expansion transformation (ET)
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_k + \gamma R_e \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; is a positive constant, called the expansion factor, and &lt;math&gt; R_e \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} &lt;/math&gt; is a random diagonal matrix with its entries obeying the Gaussian distribution. The expansion transformation has the functionality to expand the entries in  &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt; to the range of &lt;math&gt; [-\infty, +\infty] &lt;/math&gt;, searching in the whole space.

(4) Axesion transformation (AT)
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{x}_k + \delta R_a \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; is a positive constant, called the axesion factor, and &lt;math&gt; R_a \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} &lt;/math&gt; is a random diagonal matrix with its entries obeying the Gaussian distribution and with only one random position having nonzero value. The axesion transformation aims to search along the axes.

=== Regular neighbourhood and sampling ===
For a given solution &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_k &lt;/math&gt;, a candidate solution &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{k+1} &lt;/math&gt; is generated by using one time of the aforementioned state transformation operators. Since the state transition matrix in each state transformation is random, the generated candidate solution is not unique. Based on a given point, it is not difficult to imagine that a '''regular neighbourhood''' will be automatically formed when using certain state transformation operators.

Since the entries in state transition matrix obey certain stochastic distribution, for any given solution, the new candidate becomes a random vector and its corresponding solution (the value of a random vector) can be regarded as a '''sample'''. Considering that any two random state transition matrices in each state transformation operator are independent,
several times of state transformation (called the degree of search enforcement, &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; for short) based on the given solution are performed for certain state transformation operator, yielding &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples.

=== An update strategy ===
As mentioned above, based on the incumbent best solution, a total number of ''SE'' candidate solutions are sampled. A new best solution is selected from the candidate set by virtue of the evaluation function, denoted as &lt;math&gt; newBest &lt;/math&gt;. 
Then, an update strategy based on '''greedy criterion''' is used to update the incumbent best solution:

: &lt;math&gt; \text{Best} = \text{newBest} &lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt; f(\text{newBest}) &lt; f(\text{Best}), &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \text{Best} = \text{Best} &lt;/math&gt; , otherwise

=== Algorithm procedure of the basic continuous STA ===
With the state transformation operators, sampling technique and update strategy, the basic continuous STA can be described as follows:

Step 1: Initiate a random solution &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt; and set &lt;math&gt; \alpha = \alpha_{\max} = 1, \alpha_{\min} = 10^{-4}, &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \beta = 1, \gamma = 1, \delta = 1, fc = 2, k = 0; &lt;/math&gt;

Step 2: Generate &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples based on incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt; using '''Expansion Transformation''', and then update the incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt;  using greedy criterion incorporating &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples and incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt; . Let us denote &lt;math&gt; newBest &lt;/math&gt; the best solution in &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples, if &lt;math&gt; f(newBest) &lt; f(Best) &lt;/math&gt;, then perform the '''Translation Transformation''' similarly to update the incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt;;

Step 3: Generate &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples based on incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt; using '''Rotation Transformation''', and then update the incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt;  using greedy criterion incorporating &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples and incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt; . If &lt;math&gt; f(newBest) &lt; f(Best) &lt;/math&gt;, then perform the '''Translation Transformation''' similarly to update the incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt;;

Step 4: Generate &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples based on incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt; using '''Axesion Transformation''', and then update the incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt;  using greedy criterion incorporating &lt;math&gt; SE &lt;/math&gt; samples and incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt; . If &lt;math&gt; f(newBest) &lt; f(Best) &lt;/math&gt;, then perform the '''Translation Transformation''' similarly to update the incumbent &lt;math&gt; Best &lt;/math&gt;;

Step 5: set &lt;math&gt; k = k + 1 &lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt; \alpha_{\min} &lt;/math&gt;, set  &lt;math&gt; \alpha = \alpha_{\max} &lt;/math&gt;, else set  &lt;math&gt; \alpha = \alpha /fc &lt;/math&gt;, and return to Step 2 until the maximum of iterations is met.

=== Philosophy behind the continuous STA ===
* The '''expansion transformation''' contributes to the globality since it has the functionality to search the whole space; 
*  The '''rotation transformation''' benefits the optimality since when &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; is sufficiently small, the incumbent best solution becomes a local optimal solution;
* The update strategy based on '''greedy criterion''' contributes to the convergence, that is to say, the sequence &lt;math&gt; \{f(\text{Best}_k)_{k=1}^\infty \}&lt;/math&gt; is convergent due to &lt;math&gt; f(\text{Best}_{k+1}) \leq f(\text{Best}_k) &lt;/math&gt; and the [[monotone convergence theorem]];
* The '''sampling technique''' (it can avoid complete enumeration) and the '''alternate use''' of state transformation operators help to reduce computational complexity;
* The parameters like &lt;math&gt; \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta &lt;/math&gt; can be adjusted to control the search space.

==Applications of STA==

STA has found a variety of applications, like image segmentation,&lt;ref name=Han2015multi/&gt; 
task assignment,&lt;ref name=Dong2015discrete/&gt; energy consumption in the alumina evaporation process,&lt;ref name=Wang2016Optimization/&gt; resolution of overlapping linear
sweep voltammetric peaks,&lt;ref name = Wang2016State/&gt; PID controller design,&lt;ref name = Saravanakumar2015Tuning/&gt;&lt;ref name = Saravanakumar2016Lagrangian/&gt; volterra series identification,&lt;ref name = Wang2016Volterra/&gt; and system modeling,&lt;ref name = Xie2016new/&gt; and it is shown that STA is comparable to most existing global optimization methods.

=== Strategic Management System ===
To develop a strategic management system, Haines (2000) suggested using the "Systems Thinking Approach" and its five-phased (ABCDE) Systems Thinking model that invites the leader to ask and answer five important questions:&lt;ref&gt;Carrie Regenstein, Barbara I. Dewey (2003). ''Leadership, higher education, and the information age: a new era for information technology and libraries''. Neal-Schuman Publishers. {{ISBN|1-55570-455-7}}. p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SGH002"&gt;Stephen G. Haines (2000). ''The systems thinking approach to strategic planning and management''. pp.43-44&lt;/ref&gt; 
:(A) Where do we want to be?
:(B) How will we know when we get there?
:(C) Where are we right now?
:(D) How do we get there from here?, and
:(E) What is changing in the future external environment, that we need to take into account?
These five questions "align directly with the five phases of a system: (1) output, (2) feedback loop, (3) input, and (4) throughput/actions (5) within the dynamic and changing environment".&lt;ref name="SGH002"/&gt;

'''Swansea city centre''' in [[Swansea]], [[Wales]], contains the main shopping, leisure and nightlife district in Swansea.  The city centre covers much of the [[Castle, Swansea|Castle]] ward including the area around Oxford Street, Castle Square, and the [[Quadrant Shopping Centre]]; Alexandra Road, High Street, Wind Street and the Castle; Parc Tawe; and the [[Maritime Quarter]] extending down to the seafront.&lt;ref name="CCSF"&gt;[http://www4.swansea.gov.uk/SCCStrategicFramework/media/pdf/6/o/strategic_framework_final_proofred_may07.pdf Swansea city centre Strategic Framework]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|History of Swansea}}

Swansea's early 18th century industrial development shaped the development of today's city centre.&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt; However, the heart of the city centre was bombed severely in 1941 in what is now termed the "Three Nights Blitz".&lt;ref name="SwanseaAnIllustratedHistory"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many local businesses had to be relocated just outside the area of devastation. The small area of [[Georgian era|Georgian]] streets around the Old Town Hall (now the [[Dylan Thomas Centre]]) and later buildings including the former Head Post Office on Wind Street, Swansea Harbour Trust Office (now [[Morgans Hotel, Swansea|Morgans Hotel]]), the [[Castle cinema]] and the Carlton Cinema on Oxford Street (now a [[Waterstone's]] bookshop) are rare survivors of the former streets and buildings.&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt;

The bombing necessitated the complete rebuilding of the city centre, a task which fell upon the [[county borough]] of Swansea.  Preliminary plans were drawn up in 1943, a Compulsory Purchase order was obtained in 1946 and reconstruction work began in 1947.  The reconstruction task took over thirty years to accomplish.&lt;ref name="SwanseaAnIllustratedHistory" /&gt;

The new centre was planned on a grid-pattern of roads including the main thoroughfares of Kingsway, Princess Way, West Way and Oystermouth Road. At the time of the initial post-war rebuilding, the River Tawe riverfront and the South Dock (now the Maritime Quarter) were still port and industrial areas, separated from the commercial district
by railway viaducts and roads.&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt; With the old shopping centre on High Street flattened, Swansea's main shopping district was rebuilt around the new Kingsway.

Redevelopment continued into the 1980s, including the construction of the [[Quadrant Shopping Centre]], [[St. David's Shopping Centre (Swansea)|St. David's Shopping Centre]], [[Civic Centre, Swansea|County Hall]], Parc Tawe and the demolition of railway viaducts at Victoria Road. These developments reinforced the city centre as a largely retail centre with only limited office accommodation and housing.&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt; In recent years, a greater mix of uses has been encouraged in the city centre with the regeneration of the Maritime Quarter, Wind Street and Salubrious Place,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swansea.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=15698 City and County of Swansea - Salubrious Place] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606025319/http://www.swansea.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=15698 |date=6 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the opening of the [[National Waterfront Museum]] and the refurbishment of [[Swansea Leisure Centre]].&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt;

==Economy==
{{see also|Economy of Swansea}}

Swansea city centre provides about 24,000 jobs, or about 18% of jobs in the wider urban area.&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt; This is a low figure when compared to many other UK cities, which often have around a quarter, a third or even more of their employment in the city centre.&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt; Retail, hotel and restaurant jobs are strongly represented in Swansea city centre, and there is a growing finance and business services sector, but much of the employment that would normally be found in a city centre has instead been located in outer areas of Swansea.&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt;

===Retail===
The city centre currently features {{convert|89650|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} of comparison goods floorspace (clothing, furniture, electrical goods etc.) and {{convert|22950|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} of convenience goods floorspace (food and groceries).&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt; According to an analysis cited in the City Centre Strategic Framework, Swansea is the eighteenth largest retail centre in the UK, relatively large for its population. However, the general quality, range and size of city centre shops is poor, so Swansea is usually ranked outside the top 50 retail centres in the UK on various industry listings.&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt; The poor retail performance is believed to be the result of several factors, including poor urban design, lack of recent development and competition from [[retail park|out-of-town]] shops at [[Fforestfach]] and [[Morfa, Swansea|Morfa]].&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt;

===Offices===
Swansea city centre is not a major office location, although there are office premises including the [[BT Tower, Swansea|BT Tower]] near [[Swansea Castle]], Oldway House/Alexandra House on High Street/Alexandra Road and the [[JobCentre Plus]] building near the [[St. David's Shopping Centre]].&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt; In 2002, there was {{convert|147960|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} of office space in the city centre as a whole, and {{convert|30360|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} in the retail core.&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt; Relatively low rents, generally less than £86 per m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (£8 per sq. ft), underline the weakness of the city centre office market.&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt; However, an additional {{convert|65000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} is planned at [[SA1 Swansea Waterfront]], adjacent to the city centre, and rents of £140 per m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (£13 per sq. ft) have been achieved here.&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt; The City Centre Strategic Framework notes that this demonstrates that a commercially viable office market can eventually be developed in Swansea city centre.&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt;

==Areas==
[[File:Swansea from kilvey hill.jpg|thumb|right|Swansea city centre and [[Swansea Bay]] seen from [[Kilvey Hill]]]]

===Swansea Market/Quadrant Centre vicinity===
[[Swansea Market]], the [[Quadrant Shopping Centre]] and the St. David's Shopping Centre are situated in the middle of the city centre.  The Quadrant Centre opened in the late 1970s and dominated by chain stores. It includes an adjacent [[multi-storey car park]] that opens directly into [[Debenhams]] on one floor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swansea.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=2901 City and County of Swansea - Quadrant MSCP details]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swansea bus station]] is located on the western side of the centre, and [[Swansea Grand Theatre]] is next door to the station on Singleton Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swansea.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1836 City and County of Swansea - Directions to the Grand]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Tesco]] superstore is located immediately south-east of the Quadrant.

===High Street===
High Street was once the main shopping street in Swansea and formed the central axis of the shopping centre.  It was completely destroyed in [[World War II]].  Leaving just a few buildings standing gutted including half of the now demolished Woolworth Building, the Elysium Cinema building, the New Castle Buildings and smaller stores to the northern end including the historical Bush Inn (demolished in 2013).
The High Street has a large indoor arcade filled with small local business including a Cafe (Arcade Cafe) a crafty shop, a hair extensions shop, a barbers, Army surplus store, A sewing training store, an clothing alterations shop, kids clothing shop (which used to be 2nds clothing)
[[Swansea Castle]] is to be found at the southern end of the street.  Opposite the castle is the Castle Square.  Towards the northern end is [[Swansea railway station]] and the Swansea Grand Hotel.  The stretch between the castle and railway station is dominated by local retailers, discount retailers and a few pubs, restaurants, fast-food outlets and 2 of Swansea's gay bars, Pulse and The Kings.  The street becomes mainly residential, north of the railway station.  In this residential stretch, there is one wedged shaped building on the corner with Prince of Wales Street.  This is the [[Palace theatre, Swansea|Palace theatre]], the venue where [[Anthony Hopkins]] staged his first professional performance, the oldest theatre in Wales, one of only 2 remaining purpose built music halls left in the United Kingdom and the first place in Wales to screen a moving picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_west/3239364.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Oldest theatre under hammer | date=26 November 2003 | accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was once used as a nightclub but is now mostly derelict.

===The Kingsway===
Until the development of Wind Street as a nightlife zone, the Kingsway was the centre of night life in Swansea.  While many of the bars have shut down due to competition from Wind Street bars, the largest night clubs in Swansea are still located here.  Apart from the night life venues, The Kingsway has a number of banks, shops, fast food outlets and branch of the [[YMCA]].  Swansea's former main Post Office was located on this road too but recently moved to [[WH Smith]] inside the Quadrant Shopping Centre about {{convert|250|yd|m}} away.

In 2006, the Kingsway was re-engineered to become a one-way street for cars.  The southern traffic lanes are now dedicated two way bus lanes developed in conjunction with the [[First Cymru]]'s new [[Swansea Metro]] bus route.  At the eastern end of the Kingsway was a large roundabout incorporating a pedestrian subway.  The subway has now been filled in and the roundabout replaced with a traffic light crossroad and wider pedestrian walkways.

===Oxford Street===
Oxford Street is the main shopping street in Swansea which includes major retailers such as Marks and Spencer, Next and BHS. The eastern end of the street, close to Castle Square, is pedestrianised and dominated by chain stores. The western end features mass-market/down-market multiple stores and links to two arcades of very small independent retailers.&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt; Further west, the street enters the [[Sandfields, Swansea|Sandfields]] area and is mainly residential. Street markets are held on Oxford Street, Princess Way and Castle Square over Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swanseachristmas.com/|publisher=City and County of Swansea|accessdate=30 June 2010|title=Swansea Christmas home}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wind Street/Salubrious Place===
[[File:TheNewYorkPubSwansea.jpg|thumb|right|The New York Pub on Princess Way, parallel to Wind Street]]
Wind Street ({{lang-cy|Stryd y Gwynt}}) has a name which nowadays means different things in the two languages. The local English pronunciation has shifted from {{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɪ|n|d}} Street (i.e. with a meaning matching the Welsh name) to {{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|aɪ|n|d}} Street (which doesn't). Wind Street was once a haunt of the poet [[Dylan Thomas]] and location of the covered alleyway 'Salubrious Passage'. It became a backwater in the second half of the 20th century when the commercial centre of Swansea shifted.  It boasts the highest concentration of listed buildings in Swansea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.swansea.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1524 | title=Listed Building Index | publisher=City and County of Swansea | year=2007 | accessdate=28 July 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809215656/http://www.swansea.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1524 | archivedate=9 August 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second World War]], the pubs of Wind Street saw the visit of a young star-to-be.  A group of American GIs stationed in Swansea entered the Adelphi pub.  An Australian soldier also stationed in Swansea saw this and proceeded to taunt the young GI, who was drinking milk, that he was not strong enough to drink alcohol.  Unfortunately for him he had picked on the young [[Rocky Marciano]] who went on to become one of the world's greatest heavyweight boxers.  Rocky floored him with one punch.  Marciano himself confirmed this story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_west/3100929.stm | title=Rocky's pub fight tribute | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=18 May 2009 | date=27 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following redevelopment at the beginning of the 21st century it is now known for its pubs, bars, clubs and restaurants, including the No-Sign Wine Bar and The Olde Cross Keys pub. The street developed a reputation for drunkenness and bad behaviour, leading to the local council introducing a curb on new pub and club licences in the city centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-23547201 | title=Swansea's 'debauched' Wind Street defended by businesses | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=27 January 2015 | date=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2010 Wind Street had the second highest number of reported crimes in the whole of England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/Swansea-s-Wind-Street-second-violent-England-Wales/story-12454496-detail/story.html | title=Swansea's Wind Street tops list of crime-hit areas in England and Wales | work=South Wales Evening Post | accessdate=27 January 2015 | date=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the development of the street's lower, south-eastern end was completed, as 'Salubrious Place',{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} including an Aspers Casino, a Vue Cinema, a [[Premier Inn]] hotel, parking and additional eating and drinking venues. The casino closed in 2012 and Salubrious Place went into receivership in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Sion Barry | url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/business/business-news/swanseas-salubrious-place-scheme-receivership-5390710 | title=Swansea's Salubrious Place scheme in receivership  |work=Wales Online | accessdate=27 January 2015 | date=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; though in 2014 new plans were announced to re-invent the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/Continental-revamp-leisure-quarter/story-22761904-detail/story.html | title='Continental' revamp submitted for Salubrious Place | work=South Wales Evening Post | accessdate=27 January 2015 | date=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Princess Way===
[[File:St Marys Church Swansea.JPG|thumb|left|[[St Mary's Church, Swansea|St. Mary's Church]]]]
[[File:SwanseaCastlePlaza.jpg|thumb|right|Castle Square]]
Princess Way ({{lang-cy|Ffordd y Dywysoges}}) links Kingsway Circle to the north with Oystermouth Road to the south. The northern section of the street is fully pedestrianised and is fronted with shops. The southern section is fronted with pubs, restaurants and offices and has a [[Travelodge]] hotel, a [[Vue (cinema)|Vue]] cinema and [[Aspers]] casino. The central portion of Princess Way opens onto two [[town square]]s.

Castle Square links Princess Way with Castle Street. Castle Square is a concreted square that slopes upwards towards steps to [[Swansea Castle]] to the east forming an [[amphitheatre]]-like space. It has grass verges and a few trees on its sides, and two fountains. The square is faced to the south by Caer Street which is lined with shops in buildings with a [[Tudorbethan architecture|mock Tudor]] facade. In July 2008, a new permanent [[BBC]] TV big screen was constructed on the southern corner of Castle Square, which will show BBC coverage of [[Beijing 2008]] and [[London 2012]] as well as local content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2002/05_may/29/swansea_bigscreen.shtml BBC Press Office: Swansea gets Big Screen spectacular]&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Mary's Square links Princess Way with Whitewalls. [[St Mary's Church, Swansea|St. Mary's Church]] sits in the middle of the square. It is fronted by the [[Quadrant Centre]] to the east; a clothes shop to the north; and offices and shops to the south.

===Parc Tawe===
[[Parc Tawe]] is an area on the west bank of the [[River Tawe]] in the [[Lower Swansea valley]]. The area includes several "out-of-town" style stores and entertainment units. There are car parking spaces in this area, but at peak periods it is subject to traffic congestion. A highly visible building is the [[Plantasia]] - a large triangular tropical plant house. Entertainments in the area include a 10 screen cinema and a [[ten pin bowling]] alley.

===Alexandra Road vicinity===
Alexandra Road is in an area to the north of the city centre at the foot of Townhill.  It is home to a campus [[University of Wales Trinity Saint David]] which has several premises in the area.  Swansea College of Art's main centre is located in a building that once housed the Dynevor Secondary school.  The [[Glynn Vivian Art Gallery]] is located here as is [[Swansea Central police station]] is located here in a new building on the site that was once occupied by a fire station.  It was relocated from an older building that stood on the corner of Orchard Street/Alexandra Road.  The building next to the old police station, opposite the Glynn Vivian gallery once housed the [[old Swansea Central Library|old library]], which has now been relocated to the [[Civic Centre, Swansea|Civic Centre]]. The old police station has been converted into student flats for students of UWTSD. The old library is now part of Swansea College of Art and houses its Stained Glass, Product Design, Automotive Design, Games Design, 3D Computer Animation and Foundation courses. The [[BBC]] has two radio studios, a newsroom and general office at 32 Alexandra Road. It sub-lets part of its former building from the [[University of Wales Trinity Saint David]] which now owns the building and hosts its Music Technology and Performing Arts courses. The Swansea Magistrates Court is located opposite of the police station.  The Mount Pleasant Baptist Church sits in the far south of the area on the Kingsway.

==Entry and exit roads==

===St Helen's Road and Oystermouth Road===
St Helens Road is the main route to the city centre from the south west of Swansea. The south side of the street is dominated by fast food outlets, restaurants, ethnic grocery stores and ethnic restaurants. Bryn-y-mor Road links to St. Helen's where many student bars and more restaurants can be found. The north side of the street has a number of solicitors and health centres.  The road continues past the Guildhall and connects with Oystermouth Road. Oystermouth Road begins near the [[Swansea Leisure Centre|Leisure Centre]] and separates the shopping area of the city centre with the [[Maritime Quarter]]. It continues along the coast of [[Swansea Bay]] towards [[Mumbles]]. The north of the road has a number of [[Bed and Breakfast]] establishments near the city centre area.

===Walter Road===
Walter Road is the main route from the city centre to the west, including the [[Uplands, Swansea|Uplands]] district. Most of the road is lined with substantial three-storey town houses, many of which have been converted for use by small professional practices like accountants, solicitors, estate agents, civil engineers and surveyors. A few properties are still residential, nearly all divided into flats and bedsits.

The side streets around Walter Road are mainly residential, with mostly three bedroomed properties, mainly occupied by families. A number of properties have been converted into bedsits for use by students of [[Swansea University]] south of Walter Road and the University of Wales Trinity Saint David north of Walter Road.

===Carmarthen Road===
Carmarthen Road is a dual carriageway stretch of the [[A483 road|A483]] which runs NW from the Dyfatty traffic junction in the city centre. Carmarthen Road has a mix of developments including residential, retail and commercial parks and industrial units.

===Fabian Way===
Fabian Way, a stretch of the A483, departs the city centre to the east. It bypasses [[St. Thomas, Swansea|St. Thomas]] and [[Port Tennant]] to the north; and [[Swansea Docks]] and the [[SA1 Swansea Waterfront]] development to the south. It continues through [[Crymlyn Burrows]] where it connects with the [[M4 Motorway]] at the Earlswood junction (M4 Junction 42). This is considered as the main gateway to the city centre from the east, because of the connection to the M4 and [[Neath Port Talbot]].

==Plans==

In January 2007, developers [[Hammerson]] and [[Urban Splash]] were chosen for a £1&amp;nbsp;billion redevelopment of the city centre.  The two developers previously collaborated on [[Birmingham]]'s [[Bull Ring, Birmingham|Bullring]] development.  The plan by architects BDP,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bdp.com/en/News/2008/BDPs-masterplan-for-Swansea-wins |title=BDP's £1bn masterplan for Swansea wins |accessdate=28 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006084938/http://www.bdp.com/en/News/2008/BDPs-masterplan-for-Swansea-wins/ |archivedate=6 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; includes more than {{convert|60000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} of additional retail space; 1,000 homes; new leisure, office, hotel and conference facilities;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_west/7174815.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Developers chosen for £1bn revamp | date=7 January 2008 | accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "European Boulevard" incorporating Oystermouth Road and Quay Parade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.swansea.gov.uk/SCCStrategicFramework/index.cfm?articleid=23582 Swansea City Centre Strategic Framework - European Boulevard] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606025220/http://www4.swansea.gov.uk/SCCStrategicFramework/index.cfm?articleid=23582 |date=6 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former [[House of Fraser|David Evans]] department store has been replaced with a new development incorporating five stores trading over two floors, providing {{convert|58000|sqft|m2|abbr=on|disp=flip}} of retail space. [[Zara (clothing)|Zara]], [[Slater Menswear|Slater's Menswear]] and JT Morgan have signed up for the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swansea.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=10844 |title=Re-development of the Former David Evans Department Store |accessdate=28 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805170611/http://www.swansea.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=10844 |archivedate=5 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2011 The Gym Group opened a gym on the first floor of the development.

In December 2008, the Council sought expressions of interest from contractors for the redevelopment of the [[Quadrant bus station]]. The Council said that it hopes to award the contract in May 2009, with work starting soon after. The project was planned to take around 15 months to complete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swansea.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=26546 City and County of Swansea - Countdown to construction work on Quadrant Interchange begins]&lt;/ref&gt; The new bus station duly opened on 6 December 2010, though with many finishing touches not added until early 2011.

==Transport==
The city centre is served by buses at the [[Swansea bus station]] and by trains at [[Swansea railway station]] at the northern end of High Street.  Additional bus stops are located on the Kingsway and on St. Mary's Square. A single [[bus rapid transit]] route marketed as ''[[Swansea Metro]]'' runs through the centre.

[[File:Cathedral of Our Lady of Angels, Los Angeles.JPG|thumb|[[Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels]] as seen from [[Hill Street (Los Angeles)|Hill Street]] bridge by Temple Street]]
'''Temple Street''' is a street in the City of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]].  The street is an east-west thoroughfare that runs through [[Downtown Los Angeles]] parallel to the [[Hollywood Freeway]] between Virgil Avenue past [[Alameda Street]] to the banks of the Los Angeles River.  It was developed as a simple one-block long lane by [[Jonathan Temple]], a mid-19th Century Los Angeles cattle rancher and merchant.  

Originally, Temple terminated at the intersection of [[Main Street (Los Angeles)|Main]] and Spring streets and, for decades, extended west only from that point.  Later, Temple was extended eastward into the industrial district of town, while Main and Spring were rerouted so that they did not conjoin at Temple. From the late 1860s, as development pushed westward from the older downtown, Temple Street became a fashionable residential thoroughfare and remained so into the 1880s.  When the county courthouse, hall of records, and other civic structures were built along or near the road, it became more of a civic roadway and remains so today with the federal court, hall of records and city hall all adjoining the street. Until the 1920s, Temple Street, as the city continued to grow west towards the ocean, was extended all the way to [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]].  With, however, the creation of Beverly Boulevard, Temple Street was terminated at its current location at Virgil Avenue, near Silver Lake Boulevard.  From that point, the roadway is Beverly Boulevard to [[Santa Monica Boulevard]].  Eastward, Temple Street terminates just east of Center Street and just west of Los Angeles River and railroad switch yards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3470">A '''Terminal Operating System''', or TOS, is a key part of the supply chain and primarily aims to control the movement and storage of various types of [[Cargo]] in and around a [[Container terminal]] or [[Port]]. The systems also enables you to make better use of your assets, labour and equipment, plan your workload, and get up to the minute information which allows for more timely and cost-effective decision making.

Terminal Operating Systems often utilize other technologies such as internet, [[Electronic data interchange|EDI processing]], mobile computers, wireless LANs and Radio-frequency identification (RFID) to efficiently monitor the flow of products in, out and around the terminal. Data is either a batch synchronization with, or a real-time wireless transmission to a central database. The database can then provide useful reports about the status of goods, locations and machines in the terminal.

The objective of a terminal operating system is to provide a set of computerized procedures to manage cargo, machines and people within the facility to enable a seamless link to efficiently and effectively manage the facility.

Terminal operating systems can be stand alone systems, managed as a service or utilize cloud technologies.

In its simplest form, the TOS can data track cargo in and out of a terminal.

== Functions ==
A Terminal Operating System may be used to do some or all of the following functions:

=== Shipping ===
Terminals requiring various types of [[ship transport]]
&lt;br /&gt;
[[Container terminal]]s using [[Containerization]] for LO-LO (lift on Lift Off) operations such as [[List of container terminals|these]] require plans for efficiently loading and unloading [[Container ship]]s docked within their Terminal.

A [[port]] using [[Roll-on/roll-off|RO-RO]] [[ships]] require plans for efficiently loading automobiles, trucks, semi-trailer trucks, trailers or railroad cars that are driven on and off the ship on their own wheels.

=== Rail ===
Terminals that require the arrival and departure of [[cargo]] on [[Rail transport|trains]] such as [[Containerization|container trains]] or [[Bulk material handling|bulk cargo]].

=== Road ===
Handle the receival and release of [[Cargo]] for [[transshipment]] from other modes of transport or storage.

=== Yard management ===
Creating [[Shipping list]] or keeping track of [[Warehouse]] levels. Tracking machine moves around the terminal.

=== Invoicing/Reporting ===
[[Invoice|Invoicing]] and providing reports for internal and external use.

=== Inventory ===
Keeping track of [[Inventory]] and storing its movements.

=== Cargo Type ===
Various types of [[cargo]] can be managed dependent of terminal type.  [[Containerization|Containers]], [[Logging|Logs]], [[bulk material handling|Bulk Cargo]]. The ability to [[Pick and pack]] containers.

==External Clients==
Terminals may wish to communicate with the following through their Terminal Operating System:
*Terminal Operators
*Freight forwarder
*Shipping line or shipping agent
*Container Operators
* Port Authority
* Customs Office

'''''The Opening Bell on Fox Business''''' was an American business news program airing on the [[Fox Business Network]] at 9:00am [[Eastern Time]] and was hosted by [[Alexis Glick]] until December 23, 2009. [[Jenna Lee]] and two other FBN anchors were in the running to fill the role until its abrupt cancellation on January 15, 2010, when it was replaced on the 18th by an extension of ''[[Imus in the Morning]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2009/12/no-immediate-successor-for-fox-business-networks-glick-whose-ratings-were-in-red.html&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Debuting on December 17, 2007, this program offered a daily glimpse of what is expected to happen on [[Wall Street]] for the business day, reaction to the opening of the markets, and covered the first 30 minutes of the trading day.  Contributors and reporters included [[Robert Gray (TV reporter)|Robert Gray]], [[Shibani Joshi]], [[Connell McShane]], [[Charles Payne (journalist)|Charles Payne]], [[Nicole Petallides]] (NYSE), and [[Ashley Webster]] (London).

==Segments==
Some of these segments below included:

*'''Round 1 (and so on):''' In these segments, which were seen several times during the show, Glick, the reporters and a weekly guest host talked about the business news and hot topics of the day.
*'''Trading Places:''' This was the segment in which traders from [[Chicago]] and [[New York City|New York]] give their outlook on the business day ahead.
*'''Capital Corner:''' A Washington, D.C.-based reporter for the network (either [[Peter Barnes (journalist)|Peter Barnes]], [[Rich Edson]], or [[Adam Shapiro (television reporter)|Adam Shapiro]]) joined the program to give his/her take on the [[United States Congress|Congressional]] and political side of business.
*'''Before the Bell Whip:''' In this segment, market reporters narrated a brief rundown on the day's pre-market business headlines in turn before the opening bell.
*'''Opening Bell:''' As the name suggested, this was the key segment of the show in which the opening bells are rung at the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and at the [[NASDAQ]].
*'''7 Early Movers:''' Fox Business Network contributor Charles Payne reported on the day's 7 early movers in the opening minutes of the trading day.  Seen right after the ringing of the opening bells at the NYSE and NASDAQ.
*'''Turn the Page:''' Glick, Robert Gray, Ashley Webster, Connell McShane and a weekly guest host followed the day's stories beyond the newspaper headlines.
*'''The Weigh-In:''' Seen at the end of the program (if time permitted), with Glick, Gray, Webster, McShane, Payne and a guest host weighing in on the day's business and other headlines.

==Facts==
This program replaced the fourth hour of ''[[Money for Breakfast]]'', which was reduced from four hours to three on December 17, 2007, but ''Money for Breakfast'' contracted to two hours on May 12, 2008 as the first hour of that program was replaced by the second hour of the expanded ''[[Fox Business Morning]]''.  ''Money for Breakfast'' is now off the air. 

Following the success of this program, Fox Business Network debuted ''[[Countdown to the Closing Bell]]'' on May 12, 2008.  That program, which is hosted by [[Liz Claman]], follows a format that is very similar to this one.

''The Opening Bell on Fox Business'' moved to a new set in Studio G on 2009-04-20.  This program, along with ''Money for Breakfast'' (also hosted by Alexis Glick), ''Countdown to the Closing Bell'', ''Fox Business Bulls &amp; Bears'' and ''Cavuto'' all shared that same set in the new Studio G until October 2, 2009.  The show moved back to its old studio (the same studio that was originally used for the now-cancelled ''Money for Breakfast'') on October 5, 2009.

==Cancellation==
''The Opening Bell on Fox Business'' was canceled January 15, 2010.  Fox Business Network expanded ''[[Imus in the Morning]]'' by 20 minutes on January 18, 2010, when ''[[Varney &amp; Company]]'', hosted by [[Stuart Varney]], debuted.

He is the founder and executive chairman of Svani Group, an automotive conglomerate, as well as a founder and Chairman of the Advisory Board of Fidelity Bank, a growing international financial institution.

Svanikier has been at the forefront of Ghana’s economic modernization over the past 25 years, most notably in the automobile and financial sectors.

==Business story==
Thomas Svanikier’s first venture was an automotive import business. Svani Limited, established in 1990, supplied Russian-made Lada cars to Ghanaian industry, NGOs and government agencies, and consumers throughout West Africa. In response to the notable absence of North American automobiles, Svani Limited reintroduced Ford and Lincoln Mercury cars to the Ghanaian market in 1994.

Svanikier quickly expanded his company and renamed it Svani Group. The company imports vehicles, leases, rents and sells cars, and is a distributor of generators and other heavy-duty equipment throughout West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.svanigroup.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=section&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=4&amp;Itemid=54|title = About Svani Limited|date = |accessdate = 24 August 2015|website = Svani Limited|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Svani has sold armored vehicles to the Office of the President of Ghana, the U.S. Secret Service in Nigeria, the Governor of Lagos State, and the governments of Liberia and Togo. The group also provides automotive maintenance and specialized equipment to the U.S. Department of State in Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://government-contractors.insidegov.com/l/555873/Svani-Ltd-in-Accra|title = Svani Ltd. in Accra - Contracting Profile|date = |accessdate = 20 August 2015|website = InsideGov.com|publisher = Graphiq, Inc.|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Svani currently controls about 20% of the global vehicles market in Ghana and has service centers in Accra, Takoradi, Koforidua and Kumasi. Svani is also the sole importer and distributor of Mahindra vehicles, as well as the largest distributor of Toyota Land Cruisers and Ford vehicles in Ghana. In partnership with Svanikier’s company, Mahindra built a motorcycle and pickup truck assembly plant in Accra, Ghana.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://artismc.com/index.php/news/article/view/54/988/|title = Mahindra to open auto assembly plant in Ghana|date = 12 August 2013|accessdate = 20 August 2015|website = Artis.com|publisher = Artis Management Consultants Private Limited|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two companies are currently working on the development of a 9.6 acre car assembly and servicing center along the Accra-Tema motorway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Obour|first1=Samuel K.|title=Svani Motors to establish vehicle assembly plant|url=http://graphic.com.gh/business/business-news/9878-svani-motors-to-establish-vehicle-assembly-plant.html|website=Graphic Online|accessdate=28 August 2015|date=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Svani-distributed vehicles have received nominations in Ghana’s Auto Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nominees|url=http://www.ghanaautoawards.com/nominees|website=Ghana Auto Awards|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Svanikier ventured into private equity with the creation of Africa Capital LLC, which invests in transportation, energy, finance, and real estate projects.  As a result, Svanikier is well known in Ghana as a job creator and investor responsible for a significant portion of the economic expansion and modernization between the 1980s and late 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Key events in African history : a reference guide|last = Falola|first = Toyin|publisher = Greenwood Press|year = 2002|isbn = 9780313361227|location = Westport, Conn.|pages = 321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Africa Capital’s energy subsidiary, Atholl Energy, was lauded by then President John Evans Atta Mills for its joint project with the Siemens group to construct a 180-megawatt power generation plant that greatly augmented Ghana’s power supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=President lauds Siemens, Atholl power project|url=http://edmingle.blogspot.com/2010/12/president-lauds-siemens-atholl-power.html|website=Mingle's base|accessdate=28 August 2015|date=13 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Africa Capital is the largest shareholder of Fidelity Bank in both Ghana and Malaysia. Fidelity is currently the fourth largest bank in Ghana, and is growing rapidly. Fidelity Bank has 98 branches in Ghana and plans to increase that number significantly in the coming years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dzawu|first1=Moses|title=Rothschild-Backed Fidelity of Ghana to Double Branches|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-09-01/rothschild-backed-fidelity-of-ghana-to-double-branches|accessdate=28 August 2015|work=BloombergBusiness|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, the bank’s total assets also stood at GHC 3.135 billion.

In July 2015, Svanikier and his wife were invited to be part of U.S. President Barack Obama’s delegation during his official visit to Kenya. Svanikier was also asked to take part in the Global Entrepreneurship Summit organized in Nairobi, Kenya by the U.S. Department of Commerce, at which the president met with leading figures in African business circles.

As of 2015, Svanikier serves as the senior adviser for Africa for the Transnational Strategy Group,&lt;ref name="team"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Transnational Strategy Group Team|url=http://transnationalstrategy.com/team/|website=Transnational Strategy Group|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Washington, D.C.-based&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://transnationalstrategy.com/contact/|title = Contact - Transnational Strategy Group|date = |accessdate = 20 August 2015|website = Transnational Strategy Group|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; company that provides consultancy services for governments and companies on economic and political issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://transnationalstrategy.com/|title = Transnational Strategy Group - Home|date = |accessdate = 20 August 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It attracted about 8000 footfalls over 3&amp;nbsp;days and participation from 400+ students from over 70 business schools and 200 of India's best postgraduate and undergraduate colleges.&lt;ref name="coolavenues2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coolavenues.com/bschools/100524/iimb_vista_3.php3|title=VISTA 2005 @ IIM Bangalore|publisher=coolavenues.com|accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vista 2003===
"Beyond Vision Statements-Mission Execution" was the theme of Vista 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Business Standard |url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/iim-b-to-hold-vista-2003/139726/ |title=IIM-B to hold Vista 2003 |publisher=Business-standard.com |date=2003-10-29 |accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; which focussed on the practical issues faced by the companies in translating their vision into reality. Corporate Partnerships included enduring alliances with leading companies like Tata Sons, ITC, Tata Motors, Sify and Hutch. There was participation not only from premier B-Schools in India but also from prominent international schools like [[London Business School]], Graduate School of Business, University of Chicago, McGill, UCLA and NYU Stern. Activities ranging from presentations by academic experts and senior managers in the panel discussion being conducted by CNBC, to the business quiz being hosted by Siddhartha Basu, Vista gave the participants an opportunity to actively discuss their experiences, contribute insights on the issues faced by corporate India and challenge their intellect in stimulating informal sessions.&lt;ref name="coolavenues3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coolavenues.com/bschools/iimb_press_vista2003.php3|title=bschools/iimb_press_vista2003|publisher=coolavenues.com|accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vista 2002===
VISTA 2002 was flagged off by Mr. [[Kumar Mangalam Birla]], Chairman, [[Aditya Birla Group]]. The fest attracted a host of corporate sponsors including HUL, ITC, Standard Chartered, Tata Group and Colgate Palmolive. A host of events –Ad-Age, Manifestations, Money Matters, Bizarre were conducted and there was participation from premier B-Schools in the country including IIMA, IIMC, NITIE and S. P. Jain. Three days of action and learning were aided by the synergy of the corporate world, management students from around the country and academia. It truly lived up to its theme for the year, "Making the Connection".&lt;ref name="coolavenues4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coolavenues.com/bschools/iimb_vista.php3|title=bschools/iimb_vista|publisher=coolavenues.com|accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Walter Andrew Shewhart''' (pronounced like "shoe-heart"&lt;!-- according to http://www.distributive.com/D3_Documents/WhitePapers/SPC_All_904.pdf --&gt;,
March 18, 1891 &amp;ndash; March 11, 1967) was an [[United States|American]] [[physicist]], [[engineer]] and [[statistician]], sometimes known as the ''father of [[Statistical process control|statistical quality control]]'' and also related to the [[PDCA|Shewhart cycle]].

[[W. Edwards Deming]] said of him:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As a statistician, he was, like so many of the rest of us, self-taught, on a good background of physics and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deming|first1=W. Edwards|title=Walter A. Shewhart, 1891-1967|journal=The American Statistician|date=1967|volume=21|issue=2|pages=39–40|jstor=1401495}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Born in [[New Canton, Illinois]] to Anton and Esta Barney Shewhart, he attended the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] before being awarded his doctorate in [[physics]] from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1917. He married Edna Elizabeth Hart, daughter of William Nathaniel and Isabelle "Ibie" Lippencott Hart on August 4, 1914 in Pike County, Illinois.

==Work on industrial quality==
[[Bell Telephone Company|Bell Telephone]]’s engineers had been working to improve the reliability of their [[transmission system]]s.  In order to impress government regulators of this natural monopoly with the high quality of their service, Shewhart's first assignment was to improve the voice clarity of the carbon transmitters in the company's telephone handsets.  Later he applied his statistical methods to the final installation of central station switching systems, then to factory production. When Shewhart joined the [[Western Electric|Western Electric Company]] Inspection Engineering Department at the [[Hawthorne Works]] in 1918, [[Quality (business)|industrial quality]] was limited to inspecting finished products and removing defective items. That all changed on May 16, 1924. Shewhart's boss, [[George D. Edwards]], recalled: "Dr. Shewhart prepared a little memorandum only about a page in length. About a third of that page was given over to a simple diagram which we would all recognize today as a schematic [[control chart]]. That diagram, and the short text which preceded and followed it, set forth all of the essential principles and considerations which are involved in what we know today as process quality control."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.porticus.org/bell/westernelectric_history.html#Western%20Electric%20-%20A%20Brief%20History |title=Western Electric&amp;nbsp;— A Brief History |publisher=The Porticus Centre |accessdate=2009-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wDkkOkcj?url=http://www.porticus.org/bell/westernelectric_history.html |archivedate=2011-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shewhart's work pointed out the importance of reducing variation in a manufacturing process and the understanding that continual process-adjustment in reaction to non-conformance actually increased variation and degraded quality.

Shewhart framed the problem in terms of [[Common cause and special cause (statistics)|assignable-cause]] and [[Common cause and special cause (statistics)|chance-cause]] variation and introduced the control chart as a tool for distinguishing between the two. Shewhart stressed that bringing a production process into a state of [[Statistical process control|statistical control]], where there is only chance-cause variation, and keeping it in control, is necessary to predict future output and to manage a process economically. Dr. Shewhart created the basis for the control chart and the concept of a state of statistical control by carefully designed experiments. While Dr. Shewhart drew from pure mathematical statistical theories, he understood data from physical processes never produce a "[[normal distribution]] curve" (a Gaussian distribution, also commonly called a "bell curve"). He discovered that observed variation in manufacturing data did not always behave the same way as data in nature ([[Brownian motion]] of particles). Dr. Shewhart concluded that while every process displays variation, some processes display controlled variation that is natural to the process, while others display uncontrolled variation that is not present in the process causal system at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Neave |first=Henry R. |author2=British Deming Association  |title=Why SPC?  |publisher=SPC Press |location=Knoxville, Tennessee |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-945320-17-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shewhart worked to advance the thinking at [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] from their foundation in 1925 until his retirement in 1956, publishing a series of papers in the ''[[Bell System Technical Journal]]''.

His work was summarized in his book ''Economic Control of Quality of Manufactured Product'' (1931).

Shewhart’s charts were adopted by the [[ASTM International|American Society for Testing and Materials]] (ASTM) in 1933 and advocated to improve production during [[World War II]] in American War Standards Z1.1-1941, Z1.2-1941 and Z1.3-1942.

==Later work==
From the late 1930s onwards, Shewhart's interests expanded out from industrial quality to wider concerns in [[science]] and [[statistical inference]]. The title of his second book, ''Statistical Method from the Viewpoint of Quality Control'' (1939), asks the audacious question: "What can [[statistical]] practice, and [[science]] in general, learn from the experience of industrial quality control?"

Shewhart's approach to [[statistics]] was radically different from that of many of his contemporaries. He possessed a strong [[Operationalization|operationalist]] outlook, largely absorbed from the writings of [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] philosopher [[Clarence Irving Lewis]], and this influenced his statistical practice. In particular, he had read Lewis' ''Mind and the World Order'' many times. Though he lectured in [[England]] in 1932 under the sponsorship of [[Karl Pearson]] (another committed operationalist) his ideas attracted little enthusiasm within the English statistical tradition. The [[British Standards]] nominally based on his work, in fact, diverge on serious philosophical and methodological issues from his practice.

His more conventional work led him to formulate the statistical idea of [[tolerance interval]]s and to propose his data presentation rules, which are listed below:

# Data have no meaning apart from their context.
# Data contain both signal and noise. To be able to extract information, one must separate the signal from the noise within the data.

Walter Shewhart visited [[India]] in 1947–1948 under the sponsorship of [[Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis|P. C. Mahalanobis]] of the [[Indian Statistical Institute]]. He toured the country, held conferences and stimulated interest in statistical quality control among Indian industrialists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isical.ac.in/history.html "A Brief History of the Indian Statistical Institute"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618065244/http://www.isical.ac.in/history.html |date=2006-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died at [[Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey|Troy Hills, New Jersey]] in 1967.

==Influence==

In 1938 his work came to the attention of [[physicist]]s [[W. Edwards Deming]] and [[Raymond T. Birge]]. The two had been deeply intrigued by the issue of measurement error in science and had published a landmark paper in ''Reviews of Modern Physics'' in 1934. On reading of Shewhart's insights, they wrote to the journal to wholly recast their approach in the terms that Shewhart advocated.

The encounter began a long collaboration between Shewhart and [[W. Edwards Deming|Deming]] that involved work on [[productivity]] during [[World War II]] and [[W. Edwards Deming|Deming]]'s championing of Shewhart's ideas in [[Japan]] from 1950 onwards. [[W. Edwards Deming|Deming]] developed some of Shewhart's methodological proposals around [[scientific inference]] and named his synthesis the [[Shewhart cycle]].

To celebrate his quasquicentennial (125th) birth Anniversary, the Quality Technology and Quantitative Management&lt;ref&gt;http://web.it.nctu.edu.tw/qtqm/&lt;/ref&gt; (QTQM) ({{ISSN|1684-3703}}) journal plans to produce a special issue in early 2017 on "Advances in the Theory and Application of Statistical Process Control".&lt;ref&gt;http://web.it.nctu.edu.tw/qtqm/qtqmindex/CFP_QTQM_ASPC_Shewhart.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The special issue will be edited by Prof. Min Xie of [[City University of Hong Kong]] and Dr. Amitava Mukherjee of [[XLRI - Xavier School of Management]], Jamshedpur, India.

==Achievements and honours==

In his obituary for the [[American Statistical Association]], [[W. Edwards Deming|Deming]] wrote of Shewhart:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As a man, he was gentle, genteel, never ruffled, never off his dignity. He knew disappointment and frustration, through failure of many writers in mathematical statistics to understand his point of view.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He was founding editor of the ''Wiley Series in Mathematical Statistics'', a role that he maintained for twenty years, always championing [[freedom of speech]] and confident to publish views at variance with his own.

His honours included:

* Founding member, fellow and president of the [[Institute of Mathematical Statistics]];
* Founding member, first honorary member and first [[Shewhart Medal]]ist of the [[American Society for Quality]];
* Fellow and [[President of the American Statistical Association]];
* Fellow of the [[International Statistical Institute]];
* Honorary fellow of the [[Royal Statistical Society]];
* [[Holley medal]] of the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]];
* Honorary Doctor of Science, [[Indian Statistical Institute]], [[Calcutta]].
