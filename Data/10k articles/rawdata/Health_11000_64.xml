The European Commissions' [[Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed]] (RASFF) has reported 10 notifications of aflatoxin B1 in maize of European origin since the last maize harvest in autumn 2012. In the 10 years prior to the last harvest—between 2001 and 2011—a total of nine cases of aflatoxins were reported in maize. Aflatoxins have been mainly an "import problem" up to now. However, global warming is increasingly affecting the mycotoxin map in Europe, producing "tropical toxins" within Europe's borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romerlabs.com/en/company/latest-news/detail/article/aflatoxins-pose-new-risk-to-european-maize-production|title=Page not found|website=www.romerlabs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Serbia the contamination turned into a political scandal after the government raised the internal milk contamination standards to tenfold of those from the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/wissen/umwelt/2013-03/milch-schimmelpilzgift-aflatoxine-serbien|title=Milch-Skandal: Grenzwerte erhöht, Problem gelöst|first=Thomas|last=Roser|date=6 March 2013|publisher=|via=Die Zeit}}&lt;/ref&gt; This higher limit however is the one practiced in the United States and two-thirds of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stern.de/gesundheit/futtermittel-skandal-so-gefaehrlich-ist-das-schimmelpilz-gift-1978347.html|title=So gefährlich ist das Schimmelpilz-Gift|date=1 March 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/serbian-scandal-highlights-fungal-poison-danger/1613913.html|title=Serbian Scandal Highlights Fungal Poison Danger|first=Steve|last=Baragona|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 22, The Iowa Department of Agriculture found elevated Aflatoxin concentrations in dog food manufactured at a Pro-Pet facility in Kansas City, KS. The [[corn]] component of the dog food was reportedly contaminated with aflatoxins, though the contributing corn load passed screening at the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-corn-aflatoxin-idUSL1N0BP9SP20130225|title=Dog food recall underscores toxic danger in drought-hit U.S. corn|date=25 February 2013|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/hy-vee-issues-recall-of-several-dog-food-products-due-to-aflatoxin-58717/|title=Hy-Vee issues recall of several dog food products due to aflatoxin|website=www.theglobaldispatch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no reports of milk infestation in Iowa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radioiowa.com/2013/03/04/testing-for-aflatoxin-in-milk-ends/|title=Testing for aflatoxin in milk ends|date=4 March 2013|website=Radio Iowa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3540">'''Abortion law in Saint Kitts and Nevis''', a country in the West Indies and a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], is modelled on [[British legislation]]. [[Abortion]] is permitted in circumstances where a woman's life is threatened by pregnancy.

==Legislation==
Abortion law in [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], as in numerous other Commonwealth member countries, is based on the British [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]].&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite book|title=Abortion Policies: A Global Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3iNmQIP7S2AC&amp;pg=63|volume=3|year=2001|publisher=United Nations|isbn=978-92-1-151365-3|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abortion is addressed in Part IX of Saint Kitts and Nevis's own Offences against the Person Act, in Sections 53 and 54, which state that any woman who unlawfully attempts to procure an abortion is guilty of [[felony]] and can be imprisoned for up to ten years with or without hard labour. A third party who administers an unlawful abortion is subject to the same penalty while the supplier of an instrument or substance with the knowledge that it will be used to cause an unlawful abortion is guilty of [[misdemeanour]] and faces a penalty of up to two years in prison.&lt;ref name=harvard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/population/abortion/Stkitts.abo.html|title=Saint Kitts and Nevis|publisher=[[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]], Harvard University|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Infant Life (Preservation) Act, which was adapted from the British [[Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929]], permits abortion at any stage of pregnancy so long as the procedure is performed "in good faith for the purpose only of preserving the life of the mother". It states that a person who causes an abortion after 28 weeks of pregnancy is guilty of "child destruction", a felony, and is punishable with life imprisonment with or without hard labour.&lt;ref name=harvard/&gt; Saint Kitts and Nevis also follows precedents set in British abortion law, such as ''Rex v. [[Aleck Bourne|Bourne]]'' (1938), in which the court ruled that an abortion performed on a teenage rape victim was lawful as it prevented harm to the victim's physical and mental health.&lt;ref name=UN/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ceped.org/cdrom/avortement_ameriquelatine_2007/en/chapitre1/page3.html|publisher=CEPED|title=Abortion in Latin America and the Caribbean: A Review of the Literature from 1990 to 2005|chapter=Specific Characteristics of Abortion Legislation in Some Countries in the Region|year=2007|first1=Agnès|last1=Guillaume|first2=Susana|last2=Lerner|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access to abortion services==
A three-year study of abortion practices in the northeast Caribbean, published in 2005, noted that women from Saint Kitts and Nevis who are seeking abortions often travel to nearby Caribbean countries in order to remain anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pheterson|first1=G.|last2=Azize|first2=Y.|title=Abortion practice in the northeast Caribbean: "Just write down stomach pain" |journal=Reproductive Health Matters |volume=13 |issue=26 |pages=44–53 |year=2005 |pmid=16291485 |doi=10.1016/S0968-8080(05)26201-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6808">'''Abraham Low''' (1891–1954), was a [[Jewish]]-[[United States|American]] [[Neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatrist]] noted for his work establishing self-help programs for the mentally ill, and criticism of [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref name="KEOGH1979"&gt;{{cite book | author = Keogh, C.B. | authorlink = Cornelius Keogh | url = http://publishing.yudu.com/Freedom/Actiz/GROWcomesofageaceleb/resources/ | title = GROW Comes of Age: A Celebration and a Vision! | year = 1979 | publisher = GROW Publications | location = [[Sydney, Australia]] | isbn = 978-0-909114-01-5 | oclc = 27588634 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090221091901/http://publishing.yudu.com/Freedom/Actiz/GROWcomesofageaceleb/resources/ | archivedate = 2009-02-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SAGARINMENTAL1969"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sagarin |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward Sagarin |title=Odd Man In: Societies of Deviants in America |year=1969 |publisher=Quadrangle Books |location=[[Chicago, Illinois]] |isbn=978-0-531-06344-6 |oclc=34435 |pages=210–232 |chapter=Chapter 9. Mental patients: are they their brothers' therapists?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Low was born February 28, 1891, in [[Baranów Sandomierski]], [[Congress Poland|Poland]].&lt;ref name="SARNIA2000"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sarnia.com/groups/recoveryinc/drlow.htm |title=Biography of Dr. Abraham A. Low |accessdate=2007-10-15 |date=2000-03-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024043303/http://www.sarnia.com/groups/recoveryinc/drlow.htm |archivedate=2007-10-24 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low attended [[grade school]], [[high school]] and medical school in France from 1910 to 1918. He continued his medical education in [[Austria]], serving in the Medical Corps of the [[Military of Austria|Austrian Army]]. He graduated with a medical degree in 1919, after his military service, from the [[University of Vienna]] Medical School. After serving an [[internship]] in [[Vienna, Austria]] from 1919 to 1920, he immigrated to the United States, obtaining his U.S. citizenship in 1927.

==Career==
From 1921 to 1925 he practiced medicine in both [[New York, New York]] and [[Chicago, Illinois]]. In 1925 he was appointed as an instructor of [[neurology]] at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]] Medical School and became an associate professor of psychiatry.&lt;ref name="SARNIA2000"/&gt; In 1931 Low was appointed Assistant Director and in 1940 became Acting Director of the University's Neuropsychiatric Institute.&lt;ref name="GROSZ1971"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Self-help through Recovery, Inc |last=Grosz |first=H. J. |journal=Current Psychiatric Therapies |volume=11 |year=1971 |pages=156–160 |pmid=5113142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1931 to 1941 he supervised the Illinois State Hospitals. During this time he conducted demanding seminars with the staff and interviewed the most severe mental patients in the wards. In 1936, Low's ''Studies in Infant Speech and Thought'' was published by the University of Illinois Press.&lt;ref name="SARNIA2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LOW1936"&gt;{{cite book |last=Low |first=Abraham A. |title=Studies in infant speech and thought |publisher=[[University of Illinois]] |location=[[Urbana, Illinois]] |year=1936 |oclc=14752937}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sixty papers are by Low dealing variously with such topics as: [[Histopathology]] of brain and spinal cord, studies on speech disturbances ([[aphasias]]) in brain lesions, clinical testing of psychiatric and neurological conditions, studies in [[shock therapy (psychiatry)|shock treatment]], laboratory investigations of mental diseases; and several articles on [[group psychotherapy]] had been published in medical periodicals.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

==Death and legacy==
In 1954 Low died at the [[Mayo Clinic]] in [[Rochester, Minnesota]]. His contributions to the psychiatric and mental health communities are often not well known, but his work has and continues to assist numerous individuals in the area of mental health.&lt;ref name="SARNIA2000"/&gt;

==Recovery International==
{{Main|Recovery International}}
In 1937, Low founded [[Recovery International|Recovery, Inc.]] He served as its medical director from 1937 to 1954.  During this time he presented lectures to relatives of former patients on his work with these patients and the before and after scenarios. In 1941, Recovery Inc. became an independent organization. Low's three volumes of ''The Technique of Self-help in Psychiatric Aftercare'' (including "Lectures to Relatives of Former Patients") were published by Recovery, Inc. in 1943.&lt;ref name="LOW1943"&gt;{{cite book |last = Low |first=Abraham A. |title=Lectures to Relatives of Former Patients |year=1967 |publisher=The Christopher Publishing House |location=[[Boston, MA]] |isbn=978-0-8158-0139-9 |oclc=1410817}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RECOVERY1943"&gt;{{cite book |title=The techniques of self-help in psychiatric after-care |last=Low |first=Abraham A. |author2=Recovery, Inc. |location=[[Chicago, Illinois]] |year=1943 |oclc=42198367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recovery's main text, ''Mental Health Through Will-Training'', was originally published in 1950.&lt;ref name="LOW1950"&gt;{{cite book |last=Low |first=Abraham |title=Mental Health Through Will Training |year=1984 |publisher=Willett Pub |isbn=978-0-915005-01-7 |oclc=9878531 |url=https://archive.org/details/mentalhealththro002066mbp |lccn=57012246}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the organization's annual meeting in June 2007 it was announced that Recovery, Inc. would thereafter be known as [[Recovery International]].&lt;ref name="REPORTER2007"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Recovery Reporter |title=Annual Meeting |year=2007 |origyear=2nd Quarter |volume=70 |issue=2 |oclc=22518904 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5962">'''Agricultural expansion''' describes the growth of [[agricultural land]] ([[arable land]], [[pastures]], etc.) in the 21st century as a direct consequence of [[human overpopulation]] with an estimated 10 to 11 billion humans by end of this century and the required [[food security|food]] and [[energy security]]. It is foreseen that most nonagricultural [[terrestrial ecosystem|terrestrial]] and [[aquatic ecosystem]]s of the world will be [[environmental impact|affected adversely]] ([[habitat loss]], [[land degradation]]). The intensified [[food production|food]] and [[biofuel]] production will particularly affect [[tropical]] regions.

Most modern agriculture relies on [[intensive agriculture|intensive]] methods. Further expansion of the predominant farming types that rest on a small number of [[High-yielding variety|highly productive crops]] has led to a significant [[loss of biodiversity]] on a global scale already.&lt;ref name="Grantham Research Institute on climate change and the environment 2018"&gt;{{cite web | title=The expansion of modern agriculture and global biodiversity decline: an integrated assessment | website=[[Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment]] | date=2018-02-19 | url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/publication/running-with-the-red-queen-an-integrated-assessment-of-agricultural-land-expansion-and-global-biodiversity-decline/ | access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the light of the already occurring and potential massive ecological effects, the need for [[sustainable agriculture|sustainable]] practices is more urgent than ever.

The [[FAO]] predicts that global [[arable land]] use will continue to grow from a {{convert | 1.58 | e9ha}} in 2014 to {{convert|1.66 |e9ha}} in 2050, with most of this growth projected to result from [[developing countries]]. At the same time, arable land use in [[developed countries]] is likely to continue its decline.&lt;ref name="Our World in Data"&gt;{{cite web | title=Yields and Land Use in Agriculture | website=Our World in Data | url=https://ourworldindata.org/yields-and-land-use-in-agriculture | access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known example of already ongoing agricultural expansion is the proliferation of [[palm oil]] production areas or the [[land conversion]]/[[deforestation]] for [[soy bean]] production in [[South America]]. Today's [[land grabbing]] activities are often a consequence of the strive for agricultural land by [[economic growth|growing]] economies.&lt;ref name="Ceddia Bardsley Gomez-y-Paloma Sedlacek pp. 7242–7247"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ceddia | first=M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2996">The '''Apothecaries Act 1815''' was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] (citation 55 Geo.lll, c.194) with the [[long title]] "An Act for better regulating the Practice of [[Apothecaries]] throughout [[England and Wales]]". The Act introduced compulsory apprenticeship and formal qualifications for apothecaries, in modern terms [[general practitioner]]s, under the license of the [[Society of Apothecaries]]. It was the beginning of regulation of the [[medicine|medical profession]] in the [[UK]]. The Act required instruction in [[anatomy]], [[botany]], [[chemistry]], ''[[materia medica]]'' and "[[wiktionary:physic|physic]]", in addition to six months' practical [[hospital]] experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | pages=316–317 | last=Porter |first=Roy |authorlink=Roy Porter | title=The Greatest Benefit to Mankind: A Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present | publisher=W.

Despite the Act, training of medical people in Britain remained disparate. Thomas Bonner, in part quoting M. Jeanne Peterson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Medical Profession in Mid-Victorian London |first=M. Jeanne |last=Peterson |publisher=University of California Press |year=1978 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes that "The training of a practitioner in Britain in 1830 could vary all the way from classical university study at Oxford and Cambridge to a series of courses in a provincial hospital to 'broom-and-apron apprenticeship in an apothecary's shop'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Becoming a Physician : Medical Education in Great Britain, France, Germany, and the United States, 1750-1945 |first=Thomas Neville |last=Bonner |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1995 |isbn=9780195362657 |page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aspergillomarasmine A''' is an polyamino acid naturally produced by the mold ''[[Aspergillus versicolor]]''. The substance has been reported to inhibit two [[antibiotic resistance]] [[carbapenemase]] proteins in bacteria, [[New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1]] (NDM-1) and [[Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase]] ([[VIM-2]]), and make those antibiotic-resistant bacteria susceptible to antibiotics.&lt;ref name="King2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=King|first=Andrew M.|author2=Sarah A.

The molecule is a tetra[[carboxylic acid]] with four -COOH groups.  One section of the molecule is the amino acid [[aspartic acid]]. This has two [[alanine]]{{contradict-inline|date=February 2016}}&lt;!-- not true according to diagram (or at best unusual terminology); this implies usual amine/carboxyl linking from alanine that would have its "CH3" sidechain intact, not an "aminomethyl" amino-acid side-chain --&gt; molecules attached. [[Aspergillomarasmine B]] differs in that the last alanine is replaced by [[glycine]].

The crystalline substance was first isolated in 1956, but its name was given until 1965.&lt;ref name="Haenni1965"/&gt;

In addition to ''Aspergillus versicolor'', aspergillomarasmine A is also produced by the ascomycete ''[[Pyrenophora teres]]'' where it acts as a toxin in the barley [[net-spot blotch disease]].

Aspergillomarasmine A takes the form of colourless crystals.  The chemical is insoluble in common [[organic solvent]]s, but can dissolve in water under either basic or strongly acidic conditions.&lt;ref name="Haenni1965"/&gt;

The relative amount of these two toxins is dependent upon the pH of the growth medium, with lower pH favouring the lactam form.&lt;ref name="Weiergang2002"/&gt;  The lactam can be hydrolyzed to aspergillomarasmine A by treating it with [[trifluoroacetic acid]].&lt;ref name="Weiergang2002"/&gt;

'''Associationism''' is the idea that mental processes operate by the [[Association (psychology)|association]] of one mental state with its successor states.

==History==

The idea is first recorded in [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], especially with regard to the succession of memories. Members of the principally British "''Associationist School''", including [[John Locke]], [[David Hume]], [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]], [[Joseph Priestley]], [[James Mill]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Alexander Bain]], and [[Ivan Pavlov]], asserted that the principle applied to all or most mental processes.&lt;ref name="Boring"&gt;Boring, E. G. (1950) "A History of Experimental Psychology" New York, Appleton-Century-Crofts&lt;/ref&gt; Later members of the school developed very specific principles elaborating how associations worked and even a physiological mechanism bearing no resemblance to modern [[neurophysiology]].&lt;ref&gt;Pavlov, I.P. (1927, 1960) "Conditioned Reflexes" New York, Oxford (1927) Dover (1960)&lt;/ref&gt;  For a fuller explanation of the intellectual history of associationism and the "Associationist School", see ''[[Association of Ideas]]''.

Some of the ideas of the Associationist School anticipated the principles of [[Classical conditioning|conditioning]] and its use in [[behaviourism|behavioral psychology]].&lt;ref name="Boring"/&gt;

'''CanniMed Therapeutics Inc.''' is a Canadian public licensed producer of [[medical cannabis]].  It is primarily focused on [[cannabis oil]]. The company's predecessor, Prairie Plant Systems, was established in 1988 and is located in [[Saskatoon]], Saskatchewan.  In 2013 CanniMed became the first cannabis producer to be licensed under [[Health Canada]] regulations that were issued that year. It went public in 2016, and in March 2018 almost all of its stock was acquired by a rival producer, [[Aurora Cannabis]], following a [[hostile takeover]] to which company management finally consented.

==History==
The predecessor to CanniMed, Prairie Plant Systems, was established in 1988.  PPS began its business by providing fruit trees to orchards.&lt;ref name=DFP2012&gt;{{cite news|last1=Egan|first1=Paul|title=Part 1: Company wants to grow quality medical marijuana in old mine|url=http://archive.freep.com/article/20120422/NEWS15/204220533/Company-wants-grow-quality-medical-marijuana-old-mine|work=Detroit Free Press|date=April 22, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008151217/http://archive.freep.com/article/20120422/NEWS15/204220533/Company-wants-grow-quality-medical-marijuana-old-mine|archivedate=October 8, 2015}} {{cite news|last1=Egan|first1=Paul|title=Part 2: Underground pot farm could breathe new life into U.P. mining town|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20120423/NEWS15/204230351/Underground-pot-farm-could-breathe-new-life-into-U-P-mining-town|work=Detroit Free Press|date=April 23, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425211500/http://www.freep.com/article/20120423/NEWS15/204230351/Underground-pot-farm-could-breathe-new-life-into-U-P-mining-town|archivedate=April 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fruit products include [[Saskatoon berries]], [[haskap]] (blue honeysuckle) and dwarf [[sour cherries]].  In 1990, it entered a joint venture with [[Hudbay Minerals|Hudson Bay Mining]] to establish an underground growth chamber in the Trout Lake mine in [[Flin Flon]], Manitoba.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 2000, PPS received a contract from Health Canada to grow medical cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.histmodbiomed.org/witsem/vol40|title=The Medicalization of Cannabis.Wellcome Witnesses to Twentieth Century Medicine, vol. 40.|date=2010|publisher=Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at UCL|isbn=9780854841295|editor1-last=Crowther|editor1-first=S M|location=London|editor2-last=Reynolds|editor2-first=L A|editor3-last=Tansey|editor3-first=E M}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It used its facility in Flin Flon for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/medical-marijuana-operation-halted-in-flin-flon-1.780494|title=Medical marijuana operation halted in Flin Flon|work=CBC News|access-date=2018-01-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From that time until 2013, PPS was the only company given a Health Canada license to grow cannabis, although as of 2012 only 12% of medical cannabis users used PPS, with most of the rest growing their own cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/m/touch/health/story/1.799488|title=CBC News - Marijuana's journey to legal health treatment: the Canadian experience|website=www.cbc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2000 PPS set up a US subsidiary called SubTerra, and in 2003, it acquired the [[White Pine mine]] in Michigan, for use in bio-pharmaceutical research.&lt;ref name=DFP2012/&gt;  In 2009, PPR lost its lease to the Flin Flon facility when a deposit of zinc was discovered below it, and so the company built its first above-ground cannabis growing facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clean Innovation in Focus: Prairie Plant Systems Inc.|url=http://cetacwest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Prairie-Plant-Systems-CetacWest-SuccessStory.pdf|publisher=CETAC-WEST|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/opinion/analysis/high-times-over-for-marijuana-mine-161407325.html|title=High times over for marijuana mine|last=Naylor|first=Jonathon|date=2012-07-05|work=Winnipeg Free Press|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Health Canada changed its medical cannabis regulations, banning in-home production and opening up commercial production to additional companies, and that year PPS and its new subsidiary '''CanniMed Ltd.''' became first producers to be certified under the regulations.&lt;ref name=GandM&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/veteran-medical-marijuana-provider-seizing-canadas-open-market/article14694198/|title=Veteran medical marijuana provider seizing Canada's open market|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ottawa awards first medical pot licences under new rules to Saskatoon firm|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/health/ottawa-awards-first-medical-pot-licences-under-new-rules-to-saskatoon-firm-1.1466653|publisher=CTV News|first=Jennifer |last=Graham|date=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Authorized Licensed Producers under the Marihuana for Medical Purposes Regulations|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/marihuana/info/list-eng.php|publisher=Health Canada|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Capital punishment in New Zealand''' first appeared in a codified form when it became a British territory in 1840, and was first employed in 1842.&lt;ref name="TVNZ_History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/a-history-capital-punishment-in-nz-2423716|title=A history of capital punishment in NZ|date=17 December 2008|publisher=TVNZ|accessdate=10 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was last used in 1957, abolished for murder in 1961, and abolished altogether, including for treason, in 1989. During the period that it was in effect, 85 people were [[execution (legal)|executed]].

==Method==
The method of execution was always by [[hanging]]. At first, there were many possible execution sites all around the country, but later, the only two cities where hangings were carried out were [[Wellington]] (the capital) and [[Auckland]] (now the largest city). Initially, there was no professional hangman employed—the executioner was simply chosen from among any who were deemed qualified. On occasion, convicted criminals were employed as hangmen, often in exchange for reduced sentences or monetary reward. In 1877, the sheriff of [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]] recommended that a professional executioner be hired. [[Tom Long (hangman)|Tom Long]], an [[Ireland|Irishman]] who claimed to have been an executioner in [[Australia]], was hired as the first official hangman. He was the only official hangman to be publicly known; others remained anonymous.

==History==
The first person to be sentenced to death was a [[Māori people|Māori]] youth named Maketu, who was found guilty of murdering a [[Pākehā|pakeha]] shepherd. However, he died of [[dysentery]] before the sentence could be carried out. The first person to be executed was [[Wiremu Kingi Maketu]], who was found guilty of murdering five people on [[Motuarohia Island]], in the [[Bay of islands|Bay of Islands]]. The people killed were Thomas Bull, employed by Elisabeth Roberton, who was also murdered along with her son aged eight, her daughter of two, and a girl of nearly three named Isabella Brind, the natural daughter of one Captain Brind by a Maori woman, the daughter of Rewa, chief of Ngapuhi in that area. Mrs Roberton's husband, Captain John Roberton, had drowned prior in Paroa Bay, just opposite the island. Thomas Bull had a reputation for strength and brutality. He seemed at all times to have made a set at Maketu and had on several occasions struck, thrown, or otherwise maltreated him. Maketu, was unable to defend himself against such an opponent; nor indeed did it conform with his notions of dignity to do so, he being by virtue of his chiefly rank above combat with one who was a servant and whom he therefore regarded on the same plane as a slave. Maketu, therefore, bided his time for revenge. Maketu then killed Thomas Bull in the night with an axe; he then brutally murdered Mrs Roberton, who was shouting abuse at him and then went to murder the two girls (ransacking the house and then burning Mrs Roberton and the two children within it). The boy ran up Pa Hill, where Maketu chased him and threw him off the {{convert|200|ft|-1|adj=on}} cliff. He was sentenced to death by an [[all-white jury]] (his defence had wanted a half-white, half-Māori jury) in an Auckland court, and executed in March 1842.

All the people executed were men, except [[Minnie Dean]], found guilty of [[infanticide]] in 1895, and all were convicted of murder, except for [[Hamiora Pere]], convicted of [[treason]]. However, before Dean's trial, imprisonment and execution, several other women had been found guilty of [[Infanticide in nineteenth-century New Zealand]], but had had their death sentences commuted to life imprisonment. These were [[Caroline Whitting]] (1872), [[Phoebe Veitch]] (1883) and [[Sarah-Jane and Anna Flannagan]] (1891).  The last person to be executed was [[Walter James Bolton]], for poisoning his wife, on 18 February 1957.&lt;ref name="TVNZ_History"/&gt;

==Abolition: 1949–1961==
When the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] formed its first government following the [[New Zealand general election, 1935|1935 general election]], it commuted all death sentences to [[Life imprisonment in New Zealand|life imprisonment]]. In 1941, the Crimes Amendment Act changed the penalty for murder from death to life imprisonment with [[hard labor|hard labour]]. The only crimes for which the death penalty still applied were [[treason]] and [[piracy]].

The Labour Party lost power to the more conservative [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]], which had pledged to reintroduce capital punishment, in 1949. During that earlier period, support and opposition for capital punishment were clearly delineated on partisan grounds. The National Party supported the restoration and maintenance of the death penalty, while the Labour Party opposed it.&lt;ref&gt;Yska, 1996: 33&lt;/ref&gt; During debate over the Capital Punishment Act 1950, Labour expressed concern about the constitutional implications of the concentration of executive power in this context, while National Party Attorney-General Clifton Webb referred to the alleged "deterrent" value of the death penalty as potential threat and punitive severity.&lt;ref&gt;Yska, 1996: 34&lt;/ref&gt; However, Webb was relatively sparing in his use of the death penalty, while his successor, Attorney-General Jack Marshall (1955–1958), was a hardliner on that issue and the number and pace of executions accelerated, arousing debate.

During the time that the National Party was in office (1949–1958), 36 people were convicted of murder, and 22 of those were sentenced to death. The final decision on executions rested with [[New Zealand Cabinet|Cabinet]], and only eight of the condemned were executed. The rest were commuted to life imprisonment. Even then, professional opinion was divided. Film censor Gordon Mirams did not regard spectacles of hanging as appropriate content within crime dramas and western films and excised such content and dialogue on the basis of family propriety.&lt;ref&gt;Yska, 1996: 116&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Department of Justice historian Pauline Engel, the British Royal Commission on Capital Punishment (1953) may have heavily influenced the rise of abolitionism, as did the controversies that surrounded the executions of Harry Whiteland and [[Edward Thomas Te Whiu|Edward Te Whiu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{DNZB|Young|Sherwood|5T11|Te Whiu, Edward Thomas 1935–1955|9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which raised questions about post-war trauma, intellectual and developmental disability as factors for leniency.

Social historian Redmer Yska has argued that such concern arose much earlier. When the National Party restored capital punishment in 1950, it became an administrative ordeal for civil servants involved, particularly those within correctional facilities like Mount Eden Prison in Auckland, law enforcement and the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;Yska, 1996: 154&lt;/ref&gt; Corrections staff needed to maintain suicide watch for the convicted felon, conduct regular health checks and provide pastoral care for the condemned individual's relatives, as well as insure prison security during executions.&lt;ref name="Yska, 1996: 164"&gt;Yska, 1996: 164&lt;/ref&gt;

Official requirements mandated the presence of a magistrate, doctor and sheriffs.&lt;ref name="Yska, 1996: 165"&gt;Yska, 1996: 165&lt;/ref&gt; During the late fifties, Attorney-General Jack Marshall accelerated the pace of executions and post-traumatic stress disorder, alcoholism and duodenal haemorrhaging developed amongst two of the three staff obliged to participate during execution procedures.&lt;ref name="Yska, 1996: 165"/&gt; In cases of political import, prudent reprieves and commuted penalties did occur, as happened when three Niue Islanders were sentenced to death after killing a manifestly brutal and oppressive Resident Commissioner. On that occasion, the Public Questions Committee of the Presbyterian Church of New Zealand became involved in strenuously lobbying against the verdict.&lt;ref name="Yska, 1996: 165"/&gt;

Class differences were also seen to affect the verdict. Dr. Senga Wintringham was convicted of manslaughter, rather than murder, in February 1955, after shooting and killing Dr Bill Saunders. Wintringham claimed that she had only meant to intimidate him, rather than kill him. ''The Peoples Voice'', newspaper of the Communist Party of New Zealand, criticised the perceived "double standard" in this context, as the courts had just convicted and sentenced nineteen-year-old British migrant and itinerant labourer Frederick Foster to death, despite questions about mental illness and intellectual impairment in his context, as well as appeals from his mother.&lt;ref&gt;Yska, 1996: 166&lt;/ref&gt; Foster had shot and killed Sharon Skeffington, his former girlfriend. Although Foster was sentenced to death and executed, defence counsel Dr Martyn Finlay succeeded in raising questions about the limited intellectual capabilities and mental health of the condemned person in this context.&lt;ref&gt;Yska, 1996: 161&lt;/ref&gt; Similar questions would arise in the trial, conviction and execution of Albert Webb. The ''New Zealand Listener'' editorialised against the death penalty in July 1955, and received supportive feedback from its letters page correspondents.&lt;ref&gt;Yska, 1996: 187&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Thomas Te Whiu|Eddie Te Whiu]] was hanged in August 1955, after he had killed an elderly widow in [[Whangarei|Ngararatunua]], near [[Kamo, New Zealand|Kamo]], when an attempted burglary went wrong.&lt;ref name="DNZB Te Whiu"&gt;{{DNZB|title=Edward Thomas Te Whiu|first= Sherwood|last= Young|id=5t11|accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abolitionist sentiment grew again, as, with the Foster and Black cases, there was perceptible anxiety about the failure of "deterrence" value in the context of violent homicides, and whether Te Whiu should have been convicted of manslaughter instead, due to his dysfunctional family origins and limited intellectual capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Yska, 1996: 188&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a National Committee for Abolition of the Death Penalty was formed in November 1956, with branches in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin.

Engel and Maureen Garing have drawn attention to the involvement of Protestant Christian opposition to capital punishment. In 1941 and 1951, the Christian Social Justice League, Christchurch Anglican Diocesan Synod and Methodist Public Questions Committee supported abolition, as did individual Catholics, although their hierarchy remained neutral in this debate. The New Zealand Theosophical Society also opposed capital punishment, and the Churches of Christ and Baptist Union declared its opposition in the late fifties. As religious opposition grew, it provided opponents of capital punishment with an organisational base that was used to good effect. Redmer Yska notes that clergy often refused to participate in legitimising executions through their presence, of whatever denomination.&lt;ref name="Yska, 1996: 164"/&gt;

As a consequence of controversy over the perceived escalation in use of capital punishment, abolitionist petitions started to circulate as well. In 1956, a proposal for a referendum on capital punishment was put forward by the [[Minister of Justice (New Zealand)|Minister of Justice]], [[Jack Marshall]]. This referendum was to be voted on during the [[New Zealand general election, 1957|1957 general election]], but the proposal was defeated.

Meanwhile, [[Walter James Bolton]] (1888–1957) was executed at [[Mount Eden Prison]] in [[Auckland]] in February 1957, after he had allegedly poisoned his wife with arsenic. Given that the National Party lost that election, there were to be no further executions within New Zealand. However, while the election saw a short-lived Labour government elected, capital punishment was not debated in Parliament again before the National party regained power after the [[New Zealand general election, 1960|1960 election]].

In 1961, the National Party reaffirmed its support for the death penalty, although restricted its use to premeditated murders, and those committed during another crime or during an escape from custody. The issue of capital punishment generated intensive debate within the National Party—the Minister of Justice in the [[Second National Government of New Zealand|Second National Government]], who was responsible for introducing the Crimes Bill 1961, [[Ralph Hanan]], strongly opposed the death penalty, while Jack Marshall, the [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand|Deputy Prime Minister]], had condoned its use while serving as Minister of Justice and Attorney General, as noted above.

==Abolition and its aftermath: 1961 onwards==

Aware of growing public opposition to capital punishment, the National Party allowed its MPs to exercise a [[conscience vote]] in Parliament, and ten National MPs subsequently voted in favour of abolition. The result was a majority of 11 against capital punishment, 41-30. The ten National MPs were Rev. [[Ernest Aderman]], [[Gordon Grieve]], [[Ralph Hanan]], [[Duncan MacIntyre (New Zealand politician)|Duncan MacIntyre]], [[Robert Muldoon]], [[Herbert Pickering]], [[Logan Sloane]], [[Brian Talboys]], Mrs [[Esme Tombleson]] and [[Bert Walker (politician)|Bert Walker]]. The death penalty was therefore abolished for murder, being retained only for treason and other similar acts in theory. In principle, this meant that de facto abolition had occurred from that point onward.&lt;ref name="TVNZ_History"/&gt;

These last theoretical vestiges of capital punishment were abolished under the Palmer Labour cabinet in November 1989 with the passage of the ''Abolition of the Death Penalty Act 1989'', and there were no further executions during the interim period.&lt;ref name="TVNZ_History"/&gt; Passage of the ''Abolition of the Death Penalty Act'' ended all capital punishment in New Zealand. The [[Cook Islands]], which based its statutes on New Zealand law, formally retained the death penalty for treason until it was abolished in 2007.

Occasional calls to reinstate capital punishment still occur, but no major political party has made capital punishment an element of any of their election manifestos since the 1989 Abolition act.

A 2004 [[1 News]] Colmar Brunton  poll found 28% were in favour of bringing back the death penalty, 67% did not want to bring the death penalty back, and 5% were undecided. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=3578428 |title=Poll shows 28pc want death penalty back – National – NZ Herald News |website=Nzherald.co.nz |date=15 July 2004 |accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 Curia poll for [[Three (New Zealand)|TV3]]’s ''The Nation'', 38% of New Zealanders were in favour of the death penalty—a nominal increase from the 28% in 2004—while 55% were opposed it, and 7% were undecided. Also in the poll, 35% of Labour voters favoured the death penalty and National voters' support polled at 44%. Least likely to be in favour were Green Party voters at 19%, but the strongest support came from New Zealand First voters at 84%. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbr.co.nz/article/sizeable-support-reintroduction-death-penalty-ck-144558 |title=Sizeable support for reintroduction of death penalty &amp;#124; The National Business Review |website=Nbr.co.nz |date=18 August 2013 |accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.curia.co.nz/2013/08/death-penalty-poll/ |title=Death Penalty poll – Curia Market Research Ltd |website=Curia.co.nz |date=24 August 2013 |accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Leone was told by Windsor Essex County Health Unit workers that he was HIV-positive.&lt;ref name="canada.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=94c9ce73-79de-402b-803b-404846830d22 |title=Carl Leone: Trolling for sex partners |work=canada.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630191745/http://www.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=94c9ce73-79de-402b-803b-404846830d22 |archivedate=2014-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven years later on June 6, 2004, he was arrested. On June 10, police issued a public safety advisory that resulted in more than 100 people seeking HIV tests for having been a partner of Leone or possibly being linked to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

&lt;/ref&gt;  Under [[Criminal law in Canada|Canadian criminal law]], people knowing they are HIV positive have a legal duty to disclose their HIV status before engaging in behaviors that put another person at significant risk of serious bodily harm.  This is the result of the 1998 ruling by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in [[R. v. Cuerrier]], which held that a partner cannot truly give informed consent if the other fails to disclose their HIV status.

Complainants said they would not have been Leone's partner had he been truthful about his status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six of the 22 complainants tested positive for HIV (three of them learned of their condition after his arrest) with the same rare strain that Leone was infected with. The strain is extremely rare in Canada, and the number of local cases represented an unusually high concentration for the country and constituted a public health issue for the [[Public Health Agency of Canada]]. Dr. Paul Sandstrom, director of the National HIV &amp; Retrovirology Laboratories, testified that "Windsor cluster" was unique in North America because it is a different HIV strain infection than the one that began spreading across North America in the early-1980s and is more commonly found in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leone's HIV a rare strain |work=Windsor Star |date= |url=http://www.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=74d9fe08-c526-431e-a6b9-5b321cd686d1 |accessdate=2007-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109112306/http://www.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=74d9fe08-c526-431e-a6b9-5b321cd686d1 |archivedate=2012-11-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Leone was refused bail but turned to well-known criminal defence lawyer [[Edward Greenspan]] who successfully appealed the decision. Leone was released after posting bail of nearly $800,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | title = Man gets bail in HIV sex-assault case

  | accessdate = 2007-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the trial, Leone was represented by Andrew Bradie. On April 27, 2007, prior to any of the complainants testifying, Leone agreed to plead guilty. The agreement spared the complainants the experience of testifying and also marked the first time he publicly acknowledged his HIV-positive status.

On October 23, 2007, the [[Attorney General of Ontario|Deputy Attorney General of Ontario]] approved the [[Crown attorney]]'s motion to pursue a [[dangerous offender]] designation for Leone.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Chris. [http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=2082c57f-689a-434a-8752-a39da304f39b&amp;k=3463 Leone to face dangerous offender designation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027024554/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=2082c57f-689a-434a-8752-a39da304f39b&amp;k=3463 |date=October 27, 2007 }}, ''[[Windsor Star]]'', October 25, 2007. Accessed December 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]], a person designated a dangerous offender may be indefinitely incarcerated so that they do not get released into society if there is a fear they may re-offend due to their violent tendencies.

At the time of sentencing, the [[Windsor Star]] interviewed detectives Pat Keane and Bill Stibbard, who investigated the case, and a pair of Leone's victims who were 17 and 18 at the time of Leone's offences.  The detectives and women described how Leone lured the teenage girls (under the drinking age) through internet chatrooms and online messengers to night clubs, drugged them, took them to other locations, and engaged in unprotected sex with their unconscious bodies.&lt;ref name="canada.com"/&gt;  The detectives said that at least four victims claimed that Leone had raped them while unconscious.  The detectives also told of a 16-year-old girl and another woman, who was a virgin when she met Leone, whom he infected with HIV.  In trial, Leone's parole officer claimed that Leone informed her that he had purchased date rape drugs from drug dealers.&lt;ref name="canada.com"/&gt;

Leone was sentenced to 18 years in prison in April 2008, with eligibility for parole in six years. The judge said he was unable to designate him a dangerous offender because there was insufficient evidence that he would commit similar offences if released.

The '''Chesapeake Regional Information System for our Patients''' (CRISP) is a nonprofit organization created to function as Maryland’s state-designated [[health information exchange]] (HIE), by the Maryland Health Care Commission. CRISP currently serves as the HIE for Maryland and the District of Columbia. CRISP is advised by a wide range of stakeholders who are responsible for healthcare throughout the region.

Health information exchange allows clinical information to move electronically among disparate health information systems. The goal of the HIE is to deliver the right health information to the right place at the right time – providing safer, timelier, efficient, effective, equitable, patient centered care. In doing so, CRISP offers a suite of tools aimed at improving the facilitation of care for their service region’s providers. CRISP was created by [[Johns Hopkins Medicine]], [[MedStar Health]], the [[University of Maryland Medical System]] and [[Erickson Retirement Communities]],&lt;ref name=Sentementes2009&gt;{{Citation

== History ==
In 2006, CRISP began at a Spring meeting between John Erickson and the CIOs of Maryland’s three largest hospital systems, asking how to make medical records for seniors available when they visited the hospital. By 2008, CRISP had partnered with MHCC to plan an HIE for Maryland, the processed engaged dozens of healthcare stakeholders. CRISP received $10 million in seed funding through an adjustment in the reimbursement rates for participating hospitals.&lt;ref name="Goedert2009"&gt;{{Citation|title=Maryland OKs $10 Million for State HIE|url=http://www.healthdatamanagement.com/issues/2009_71/39023-1.html|year=2009|author=Goedert, Joseph|accessdate=2009-11-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023085559/http://www.healthdatamanagement.com/issues/2009_71/39023-1.html|archivedate=2009-10-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Office of the National Coordinator awarded Maryland $9.3 million to implement statewide health information exchange through CRISP.&lt;ref name="Finney2010"&gt;{{Citation|title=Maryland Receives $9.3 Million in Health Information Exchange Funding|url=http://www.audaciousinquiry.com/tabId/75/itemId/493/Maryland-Receives-93-Million-in-Health-Informati.aspx|year=2010|author=Finney, David|accessdate=2010-07-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707184805/http://www.audaciousinquiry.com/tabId/75/itemId/493/Maryland-Receives-93-Million-in-Health-Informati.aspx|archivedate=2011-07-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 2009 legislative session, Governor [[Martin O'Malley|Martin O’Malley]] signed into law House Bill 706, which gives the Maryland Health Care Commission (MHCC) the authority to regulate the state’s insurance industry to provide incentives for doctors to connect their practices to CRISP’s health information exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=HOUSE BILL 706|url=http://mlis.state.md.us/2009rs/billfile/HB0706.htm|accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maryland's Health IT Extension Center became a reality in 2010 with a grant from the department of Health and Human Services for $5.5 million.&lt;ref name="Horst2010"&gt;{{Citation|title=Maryland's Health IT Extension Center Becomes a Reality|url=http://www.audaciousinquiry.com/tabId/75/itemId/501/Marylands-Regional-Extension-Center-Becomes-A-Rea.aspx|year=2010|author=Horst, Rob|accessdate=2010-05-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707184819/http://www.audaciousinquiry.com/tabId/75/itemId/501/Marylands-Regional-Extension-Center-Becomes-A-Rea.aspx|archivedate=2011-07-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, CRISP has connected with all of the acute care hospitals in Maryland and DC, and has rolled out several new services, and dozens of new features. CRISP has even expanded their connectivity through partnerships with neighboring HIEs.

== Governance ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
At CRISP’s inception, an HIE Policy Board was convened by the MHCC. The board has oversight authority for establishing the policies that govern the statewide HIE. For more information about the Policy Board click here. Additionally, CRISP, in coordination with the MHCC, has developed a governance model that includes a Board of Advisors to provide guidance and input to the CRISP Board of Directors on certain key decisions during the development and operations of the HIE. The Board of Advisors is intended to be broad-based to ensure that a breadth of interested organizations have the opportunity to participate and represent their constituencies. There are currently over 30 organizations represented.

The Board of Advisors is organized into five committees:
; Clinical Advisory Board
: Committee reviews and provides guidance surrounding CRISP’s plan for exchange service implementations. This includes providing a clinical perspective on CRISP activities, and helping to prioritize HIE service deployments. The committee also assists in gathering information and perspectives from the broader stakeholder community pertaining to HIE services, assists in garnering support and use of HIE services, and assists in assessing the value associated with various CRISP service offerings in terms of clinical relevance and service value in various care settings.
; Technology Advisory Board
: Committee reviewed and commented on the exchange technology request for proposal, participated in the RFP response evaluation and selection process, and provided guidance and expertise on infrastructure and other technology related decisions. Responsibilities also include: providing guidance on network security and data encryption best practices; providing oversight of the performance of technology solutions, once deployed; assessing specific technology solutions surrounding areas such as single sign-on, audit protocols, role-based access, and master patient indexing; and assisting in the development of strategies for integrating end-point.
; Finance Advisory Board
: Committee reviews and provides guidance on CRISP revenue and pricing models. It is refining and modifying assumptions associated with the CRISP revenue model, evaluating how federal funding requirements impact existing revenue planning, evaluating how federal funding opportunities tie into CRISP financing, and assessing specific HIE services with regards to financial sustainability.
; Privacy &amp; Security Advisory Board
: The Committee provides guidance on privacy and security issues related to clinical data managed through CRISP and works regularly with the Privacy &amp; Security Officer (PSO) who is responsible for all such matters as they pertain to CRISP’s daily operation. Additionally, the Committee serves as a resource for best practices and recommended policies for HIPAA data security, data use, and data sharing, and provides continual guidance on internal and external HIPAA audits as well as any HIPAA security-related incidents that may occur within CRISP.
; Reporting &amp; Analytics Advisory Board
: The Committee develops, guides and prioritizes reporting and analytics services designed to support statewide efforts of improving care and reducing costs. Additional Committee responsibilities include assessing the value and relevance of reports for a wide array of users, providing guidance on data tools for report dissemination, such as user guides and other information to enhance understanding of the analysis, and to provide direction and vision in short, mid, and long-term planning of services. CRISP has developed basic reports to support initial hospital needs in monitoring performance on readmission goals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23730">'''Childbirth practices in India''' are shaped by the prevalence of [[Hinduism]]&lt;ref&gt;Aiyar, M. S. (2007). Politics and Religion in India. India International Centre Quarterly, 34, 1st ser., 42-50. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/23006045&lt;/ref&gt; and joint-family living, India's young average population, the lower national average age at marriage, and disparities in social status and literacy between men and women. Inadequate maternal health care services in India are a result of poor organization, the huge rural-urban divide, and large interstate disparities coupled with stringent social-economic and cultural constraints.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Social structure and organization ==

The [[Extended family|joint-family system]] is one of the basic features of [[Hindu]] social organization. Therefore, since Hinduism is the primary practiced religion in India, the joint-family system constitutes the majority of family structures in India.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Driver, E. D. (1963). Differential fertility in Central India. Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The joint-family system is described as follows:
“In structure, it comprises a married man, his father, his grandfather and his collaterals within three generations. The different kinsmen along with their spouses and children occupy the same dwelling, eat and worship together, and enjoy property in common. They cooperate in economic activity and, even if the members are differentiated occupationally, pool their earnings. The joint-family provides nursing care for the sick and afflicted, social security for the unemployed, and support for the aged”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
“They share the various routines, problems, and joys of social living, have strong feelings of mutual obligation during crises, and regard self-interest as being identical with family welfare. Their respect for the wisdom and justice of the eldest male permits him and his spouse to render decisions which affect each and every member of the unit”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Marriage ===

“The median ages at marriage for women and men in [[Central India]] are slightly lower than the national averages. Early age at marriage is especially rampant in the villages, and among couples belonging to the Hindu and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] faiths”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Moreover, the age at which males and females get married in India have remained constant for several decades. In the 1960s, it was reported that the median ages at marriage in India are 16.4 years for urban women, 14.6 years for rural women, 23.0 years for urban men, and 20.2 years for rural men.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Literacy ===

The [[Literacy|literacy rate]] in India has improved considerably over time. The rate has increased from 43.56 percent in 1981 to 52.11 percent in 1991.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Dutt, A. K., &amp; Sen, A. (n.d.). Provisional census of India 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Literacy rates do vary significantly among different regions of the nation. For example, the literacy rate is higher in south India than in the north. Also, a significant literacy gap exists between men and women. In 1991, the male literacy rate reached 62.86 percent and the female literacy rate was only 39.42 percent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Female and male relationships ===

Two thousand years ago, the position of women in the Hindu society was described as, “a woman should never be independent. Her father has authority over her in childhood, husband in her youth, and in old age her son has authority over her”.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Nayyar, R. (1987). Female Participation Rates in Rural India. Economic and Political Weekly, 22, 2207-2216. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/4377889&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, following post-independence in India, there has been some change in the status of women, however it seems that change only exists among women who are wealthier and have had opportunities for education and employment. The older societal male dominated views regarding women still prevails in rural areas.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Economic context ==

Farming is the largest single occupation in India.  Approximately 28 percent of the Indian population lives below the poverty line with large inter-state variations.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Pathak, P. K., Singh, A., &amp; Subramanian, S. V. (2010). Economic Inequalities in Maternal Health Care: Prenatal Care and Skilled Birth Attendance in India, 1992–2006. PLoS ONE, 5(10). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0013593&lt;/ref&gt; Poverty in India is concentrated in the central and eastern states, therefore, poverty levels are significantly higher than the nation's average in these areas. The central and eastern states of India account for 55 percent of the total poor population in India.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Coincidentally, these poor states also contributed to half of the maternal deaths in India. This is most likely due to the fact that the use of maternal care services are very limited in these states.

Alternatively, the western and southern states of India are economically and demographically more advanced than the northern and eastern states. Subsequently, these states account for only 17 percent of maternal deaths most likely due to a higher use of maternal care services in these areas. Studies indicate that there is a negative association between the use of maternal care and maternal mortality ratio.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 2011, 69 percent of India’s population was rural. Many citizens live in villages and are involved in agriculture, which to a westerner seems similar to small town. The rural areas often have inhabitants that live below the poverty line. Alternatively, a portion of the population lives in cities, which is noted as the wealthiest portion of the population. However, the urban population includes many poor people from the countryside who often live in slums that contain a fifth of India’s city dwellers. This portion of the population often works as laborers or in services. India has a huge urban middle class as well that are businessmen and professionals.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;McLeod, J. (2015). The History of India (2nd ed.). California.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health context ==
In India deaths due to [[malnutrition]], [[Famine|famines]], and [[Gastrointestinal disease|gastro-intestinal ailments]] are being decreased through improved agricultural production and distribution and the purification of water supplies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In addition, the [[Government of India]] and the [[World Health Organization]] have launched national programs of medical care and preventive medicine which, on the basis of recent surveys, appear effective in lowering the incidence of smallpox, cholera, plague, malaria, filariasis, tuberculosis, and venereal diseases.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In regard to maternal healthy theories, age at marriage and fertility have been shown to be correlated. Also, poor states in India contributed to half of the maternal deaths in India. Therefore, there is a negative association between the use of maternal care and [[Maternal Mortality Ratio|maternal mortality ratio]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Health statistics ===
The percent of women in India who had an unmet need for family planning is 21 percent. 75 percent of women have one visit covered  by insurance for antenatal visits. 50 percent of women have at least 4 antenatal visits covered by their insurance. 67 percent of women in India have their births attended by a skilled medical professional. Only 8 percent of births resulted in a [[Caesarean section|cesarean section]]. 48 percent of woman went to their [[Postpartum period|postnatal]] visits 2 days after their birth.

The total fertility rate per woman in India is 2.5.

The average life expectancy in India is 66 years old. For women, it is specifically 68 years old and for men it is 64 years old.

In 2015, India’s [[Maternal death|maternal mortality]] was 174 per 100,000 live births. In 2005, it was estimated that the maternal mortality ratio in India is 16 times higher than that of Russia, 10 times that of China and 4 times higher than Brazil. Among developing countries, India contributes to the largest amount of births in the world a year, averaging 27 million births. However, unfortunately India also accounts for 20 percent of global maternal deaths in year.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Pregnancy behaviors and beliefs ==

=== Prenatal Care ===
Prenatal care access and utilization is largely affected by [[socioeconomic status]], geographic location, and maternal education and [[autonomy]]. Use of prenatal care increased 12 percent from 1992 to 2006, but this increase was due to greater utilization by non-poor women. Poor women’s utilization of prenatal care remained relatively stagnant, at only 6.3 percent. Geographically, some Indian states have significantly lower rates of prenatal care. For example, according to 2006 studies in [[Uttar Pradesh]], only 9 percent of women receive prenatal care, as opposed to 72 percent in [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Higher rates in Tamil Nadu could be a result of the [[Janani Suraksha Yojana]] program, which financially incentivizes women to have birth in a health facility and receive a [[tubal ligation]] after 1 to 2 births.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Corbett, C. A., &amp; Callister, L. C. (2012). Giving Birth. MCN, The American Journal of Maternal/Child Nursing, 37(5), 298-305. doi:10.1097/nmc.0b013e318252ba4d&lt;/ref&gt; This program has also resulted in lower maternal mortality rate (MMR), lower fertility rate, and higher female literacy rate.

=== Views of pregnancy, birth, and infertility ===
Pregnancy is perceived positively in India, and most married women are extremely happy to learn of their pregnancy. Fertility is highly valued, and community members may begin to look negatively upon a woman if she is married for a year without any sign of pregnancy. If a couple is [[Infertility|infertile]], they will often seek out a piece of dried skin from the [[umbilical cord]] of a friend’s baby. Eating this is believed to improve fertility.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Preparation for birth ===
In preparing for birth, Indian women who live with their husbands generally seek counsel from their mothers-in-law. The advice of maternal figures is highly valued, and expectant mothers will follow the childbearing rituals passed down to them by their mother-in-law. Sleep positions, eating habits, and level of activity are all influenced by the views of older women of the family. Aside from what is told to them, women receive very little knowledge regarding birth itself. Often, women are very fearful for their birth, as they have only been told of the pain from others.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The maternal figures of the family, especially the mothers-in-law, pass on customs regarding nutrition, hygiene, and daily activities during pregnancy. Frequently, “cold” foods such as fruit are avoided during pregnancy for fear of causing sickness or stillbirth. In some traditions, women may only drink hot tea and rice milk.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The older women of the family determine each expectant mother’s activity level and sleep habits, following family tradition. Some women are told to increase their activity levels in order to prepare the body for the hard work of labor, while other rest throughout pregnancy to save energy. Sleeping may also be regulated, and some women never sleep on their back or turn over during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Labor and birth ==

=== Support During Labor ===
Pain is expected during labor and is seen as part of the natural labor process. There is little knowledge about options such as [[Epidural administration|epidurals]] in some communities.&lt;ref&gt;Hug, I., Chattopadhyay, C., Mitra, G. R., &amp; Kar Mahapatra, R. M. (2008). Maternal expectations and birth-related experiences: A survey of pregnant women of mixed parity from calcutta, india. International Journal of Obstetric Anesthesia, 17(2), 112; 112-117; 117.&lt;/ref&gt;  Depending on birth location, some women receive pain relief from warm water and massage, while other receive little support or even human touch. In hospital births, private hospitals have a higher rate of pain relief. One study found the rate for [[Private hospital|private hospitals]] to be 9.9 percent while the [[Public hospital|public hospitals]] had a rate of 0.9 percent.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Nagpal, J., Sachdeva, A., Sengupta Dhar, R., Bhargava, V., &amp; Bhartia, A. (2015). Widespread non-adherence to evidence-based maternity care guidelines: A population-based cluster randomised household survey. BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology, 122(2), 238-247. doi:10.1111/1471-0528.13054&lt;/ref&gt;

During labour, the mother and child both needs adequate monitoring. Inadequate monitoring during labour can increase the chances of the baby going into distress which can potentially lead to the death of child before birth. It is also known as still birth. Its an unfortunate scenario that the largest number of stillbirths, more than 330,000 every year, happen only in India. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sankalpforum.com/enterprises/brun-healthcare/&lt;/ref&gt;

Female relatives and neighbors may support the mother by serving tea, heating water, and helping with wrapping the newborn after birth.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Iyengar, S. D., Iyengar, K., Martines, J. C., Dashora, K., &amp; Deora, K. K. (2008). Childbirth practices in rural rajasthan, india: Implications for neonatal health and survival. Journal of Perinatology : Official Journal of the California Perinatal Association, 28, S23-S30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Birth location often determines the amount and type of supportive behavior. Women who give birth in hospitals are generally supported by nurses, although the extent of this support varies. Some express dissatisfaction with the lack of physical touch and comfort in the hospital.  At home, women are supported by the “wise women” of the family with massage and warm water, although this also varies by family.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Birth Attendants and Health Care Providers ===
On average, 83.1 percent of births are attended by skilled health personnel. However, this varies greatly by region. Traditional birth assistants (TBAs) attend 37 percent of home births in India. These TBAs often lack knowledge and literacy regarding safe birthing practices, but could have a large influence in reducing maternal mortality if properly trained. If educated properly on [[Childbirth positions|birthing positions]], sanitary practices, weighing of the baby, maintaining adequate newborn body temperature, and handling [[Postpartum bleeding|postpartum hemorrhage]], maternal and infant health in India could improve dramatically.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Saravanan, S., Turrell, G., Johnson, H., Fraser, J., &amp; Patterson, C. (2011). Traditional birth attendant training and local birthing practices in India. Evaluation and Program Planning, 34(3), 254-265. doi:10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2011.02.012&lt;/ref&gt; The other 63 percent of home births are unattended, and women who deliver in a health facility or hospital are cared for by nurses and doctors.

The majority of TBAs, who attend 37 percent of home births in India, are married and have not been to school. They may be trained or untrained, but the trained TBAs are generally younger with less work experience, and are paid for their services. The untrained TBAs are older, more experienced, and are generally unpaid.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Most TBAs entered the field after either attending several family births, birthing their own child, or following the footsteps of a family member.

=== Location of birth ===
The decision about where the birth is to take place is made by the woman’s father or brother.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 61 percent of births in India take place at home, and the majority of these are not attended by a skilled birthing assistant. Seventy-six percent of mothers reported using the [[sitting]] or [[squatting position|squatting]] position for their last birth. The remaining 24 percent birthed in the [[supine position]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Eating and drinking customs, as well as rest, activity, and movement during labor, are determined by the mother-in-law or other older maternal figure in the family.

=== Placental delivery ===
After the placenta is delivered, the cord is cut and an herbal oil, face powder, or ash mixture is rubbed on the cut section. The placenta is buried near the home, or in some communities burned. Nine days after birth, a ceremony is conducted at the placental burial site to announce the name of the baby.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  At home births, the baby is sometimes not caught after being delivered and remains lying on the floor until the placenta is delivered.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Technology in birth ===
The cesarean section rate in India was 8.2 percent in 2008, which is below the WHO’s recommended 10-15 percent.  However, this number is higher in some private hospitals. The use of interventions such as [[Episiotomy|episiotomies]], induction, and cesarean section varies between private and public hospitals. A study of women in Delhi found that the cesarean rate in private hospitals was 53.8 percent while the rate at public hospitals was 23.7 percent. The same study reported that the episiotomy rate in private hospitals was 74.9 percent compared to the public hospital rate of 57.8 percent. The rates of induction of labor were found to be 30.8 percent and 20.6 percent.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Postpartum ==

=== The Postpartum Period ===
The [[postpartum period]] begins after the delivery of the placenta. In Hindu communities, a “sutak” or “pollution confinement” period, which is a length of time for which the mother and baby are considered unclean, follows the birth. The mother and baby are in a place of confinement, usually a room in the home, during the “sutak” period. This can range in length from 3 to 10 days, and no family or community members may interact with the mother and baby during this time. At the end of this period, a “kuan pujan” or “ceremony at the well” occurs, in which the mother and baby are purified and considered clean.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Bhattacharya, A., Dwivedy, R., Nandeshwar, S., Costa, A. D., &amp; Diwan, V. (2008). ‘To weigh or not to weigh?’ Socio-cultural practices affecting weighing at birth in Vidisha, India. Journal of Neonatal Nursing, 14(6), 199-206. doi:10.1016/j.jnn.2008.07.009&lt;/ref&gt; In Muslim communities, this period does not exist. The baby is sprinkled with holy water in a ritual bath.

=== Rites of passage ===
Women receive a [[Mehndi|henna tattoo]] after birth, which is meant to prevent depression and sickness and promote bonding between mother and baby. A ceremony is conducted on the ninth day postpartum to announce the name of the baby at the placental burial site. Additionally, the “kuan pujan” ceremony is performed around the same time to signify the cleanliness of mother and baby.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Hindu women may follow the “hot” and “cold” balanced diet. “Hot” foods are those high in protein, sodium, and acid, while “cold” foods are those that are sweet or starchy. Many women are advised to avoid cold foods to avoid sickness, and have more hot foods during the postpartum period to relieve stomach pain.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Other women in India generally continue to heed the advice of their mothers-in-law regarding the postnatal period.

=== Contraception ===
According to the World Health Organization, 54.8 percent of women utilized [[Birth control|contraception]] in 2008. Female sterilization constitutes two-thirds of contraception use in Southern India, and is popular [[Family planning in India|throughout the country]]. In some areas, there are financial incentives for undergoing tubal ligation after [[Family planning in India|one or two children]]. Women who are Muslim, educated, or of higher socioeconomic status are more likely to choose more traditional, temporary methods of contraception instead of sterilization. Poor women typically experience more unwanted pregnancies, and therefore worse birth outcomes, due to lack of contraception access.  Sterilization is less common for women who have not yet had a son.&lt;ref&gt;Oliveira, I.T. d., Isabel Tiago de Oliveira, Jose G. Dias, and Sabu S Padmanas. (2014). PLoS ONE: Dominancy of sterilization and alternative choices of contraception in India: an appraisal of the socioeconomic impact. Public Library of Science. Doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0086654.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Newborns ==

=== Rites of passage ===
Many women mark their babies’ faces with “bindi” and tie small threads around the baby's’ wrists, ankles, and neck to ward off evil spirits. On the ninth day postpartum, a ceremony to name the child is conducted at the site of the placental burial.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

A male baby is considered preferable in Indian culture. Despite laws prohibiting [[Sex-selective abortion|sex-selective abortions]], they still occur, and have caused an unbalanced male to female sex ratio in India.&lt;ref&gt;Jha, P., Kumar, R., Vasa, P., Dhigra, N., Thiruchelvam, D., &amp; Moineddin, R. (2006). Low male to female sex ratio of children born in India. The Lancet, 367(9506), 211–218.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their higher status, it is custom in some areas to wait until the male baby is at least 1 year old before cutting his hair. In this ceremony, done at a Hindu temple, the family offers thanks for the blessing of a son.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== The first bath ===
If delivered by a TBA, the baby will most likely be bathed with warm water immediately by the assistant.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In some communities, women report waiting at least 9 days before bathing their baby, with some waiting as long as 3 months. It is believed to cause sickness and fever in a young baby. Incense is also frequently used after bathing the baby, as it is believed to kill germs and dry the hair more quickly.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Food and drink ===
Newborns are given warm water, honey, mustard oil, tea, or goat’s/cow’s milk after birth, before breastfeeding is initiated. Most women initiate breastfeeding within a few hours after birth, and continue to exclusively breastfeed for 6–7 months.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The newborn is typically not weighed after birth in India. Several factors contribute to the absence of weighing, such as lack of access to scales at home, lack of knowledge of scale usage in the hospital, belief that the “evil eye” will come upon the baby, and cultural tradition passed on through the generations. Due to this factor, most babies are simply said to be 2.5 to 3&amp;nbsp;kg, even when they have not been weighed.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; As India accounts for 40 percent of the world’s low birth weight newborns, this is a large area of focus for improvement.

=== Circumcision ===
Circumcision is linked to both outdated hygiene practices and religious beliefs. Among the Muslim community, it is seen as a mandatory ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Sahay, S., Seema Sahay, Karikalan Nagarajan, Sanjay Mehendale, &amp; Sibnath Deb. (03). Community and healthcare providers' perspectives on male circumcision: A multi-centric qualitative study in india. PLoS ONE, 9(3), e91213; e91213.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mortality rates ===
The [[Infant mortality|infant mortality rate]] is 47 per 1000 live births and the [[Perinatal mortality|neonatal mortality rate]] is 32 per 1000 live births.&lt;ref&gt;Sinha, L. N., Kaur, P., Gupta, R., Dalpath, S., Goyal, V., &amp; Murhekar, M. (2014). Newborn care practices and home-based postnatal newborn care programme - mewat, haryana, india, 2013. Western Pacific SurveillanFce and Response Journal : WPSAR, 5(3), 22-29. doi:10.5365/WPSAR.2014.5.1.006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dysgammaglobulinemia''' is a type of [[immune disorder]] characterized by a reduction in some types of [[gamma globulin]]s, resulting in heightened susceptibility to some infectious diseases where primary immunity is antibody based.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|three/000033050|Dysgammaglobulinemia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emedicinehealth.com/script/main/srchcont_dict.asp?src=Dysgammaglobulinemia Dysgammaglobulinemia] at [[eMedicine]] Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

It is distinguished from [[hypogammaglobulinemia]], which is a reduction in ''all'' types of gamma globulins.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|four/000051615|hypogammaglobulinemia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hyper IgM syndrome]] can be considered a form of dysgammaglobulinemia, because it results from a failure of transformation from [[IgM]] production to production of other antibodies, and so the condition can be interpreted as a reduction of the other types.

The order included a directive to federal agencies to end rules forbidding employers from using [[Health Reimbursement Account|health reimbursement arrangements]] (HRAs) to pay individual insurance premiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/12/news/economy/trump-health-care-executive-order/|title=What's in Trump's health care executive order?|first=Tami|last=Luhby|work=[[CNN]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]]|location=[[Atlanta]]|date=October 13, 2017|accessdate=October 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a separate announcement made shortly after the order was signed, Trump announced that he would end subsidies to health insurance companies that sell to low-income consumers through the state [[health insurance marketplace]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/12/politics/obamacare-subsidies/index.html|title=Trump will end health care cost-sharing subsidies|first=Kevin|last=Liptak|work=[[CNN]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]]|location=[[Atlanta]]|date=October 12, 2017|accessdate=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/us/politics/trump-obamacare-executive-order-health-insurance.html|title=Trump to Scrap Critical Health Care Subsidies, Hitting Obamacare Again|publisher=New York Times|author=Robert Pear, Maggie Haberman and Reed Abelson|date=October 12, 2017|accessdate=October 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources have described the effect of these executive actions as replacing Obamacare with a new healthcare regime; several days after signing the order, Donald Trump himself stated in a press conference that reporters should no longer refer to "Obamacare" because "it's gone, there is no such thing as Obamacare anymore".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2017/10/16/trump-no-such-thing-as-obamacare-anymore-sot-ip.cnn|title=Trump: No such thing as Obamacare anymore|author=&lt;!--- Not stated ---&gt;|work=[[CNN]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]]|location=[[Atlanta]]|date=October 16, 2017|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nonpartisan [[Congressional Budget Office]] projected that the AHCA would increase the number of uninsured people by 23 million over 10 years, but would decrease the federal budget deficit by $119 billion over the same period (about 1%), mainly by cutting [[Medicaid]] coverage for lower income Americans.

===Execution of the Executive Order===
Following the failure of Congress to repeal the ACA through legislation, Trump issued the new order. Both supporters and critics asserted that the provisions of the order were intended to redefine the American health care market and effectively replace Obamacare with a new health care regime.&lt;ref name="Klein"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schallhorn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/12/trump-clears-way-for-obamacare-alternatives-in-new-executive-order-goes-around-stalled-congress.html|title=Trump clears way for ObamaCare 'alternatives' in new executive order, goes around stalled Congress|first1=Kaitlyn|last1=Schallhorn|first2=Serafin|last2=Gomez|work=[[Fox News]]|publisher=[[Fox Entertainment Group]]|location=[[New York City]]|date=October 12, 2017|accessdate=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|"Replacing" Obamacare?|date=October 2017}} Trump briefly forgot to sign the order before leaving the signing ceremony, but was ushered back to the table by Vice President [[Mike Pence]] to complete this step.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-forget-sign-executive-order-healthcare-obamacare-mike-pence-a7997661.html|title=Donald Trump almost forgets to sign executive order before reminder from Mike Pence|first=Alexandra|last=Wilts|work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=Independent Print Limited|location=[[London]]|date=October 12, 2017|accessdate=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Rand Paul]], who attended the signing, described the order as "the biggest free market reform of health care in a generation".&lt;ref name="Schallhorn"/&gt;

==Provisions==
The order reverses a number of aspects of Obamacare upon which that regime had relied.

Section 1, title "Policy", lays out the policies supporting the provisions of the order, noting that the order directs that the government "facilitate the purchase of insurance across State lines" and prioritizes "[[America's Health Insurance Plans|association health plans]] (AHPs), [[Short-term health insurance|short-term, limited-duration insurance]] (STLDI), and [[Health Reimbursement Account|health reimbursement arrangements]] (HRAs)". Whereas Obamacare had prohibited insurance companies from selling low-cost short term health insurance plans "that can circumvent some of the mandates created under Obamacare",&lt;ref name="Klein"/&gt; such as requiring coverage for persons with preexisting conditions, and requiring coverage for various medical services. The order reversed this prohibition, and also directs the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Treasury to ease access to "association health plans", which also need not provide the coverage that had been mandated by Obamacare, and expands health savings accounts.&lt;ref name="Klein"/&gt;

Section 2, titled "Expanded Access to Association Health Plans", directs the Secretary of Labor to take steps to "expand access to health coverage by allowing more employers to form AHPs".

Section 3, titled "Expanded Availability of Short-Term, Limited‑Duration Insurance", directs the Secretaries of the Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services to take steps to "expand the availability of STLDI".

Section 4, titled "Expanded Availability and Permitted Use of Health Reimbursement Arrangements", directs the Secretaries of the Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services to take steps to "increase the usability of HRAs, to expand employers' ability to offer HRAs to their employees, and to allow HRAs to be used in conjunction with nongroup coverage".

==Impact==
{{Main|Cost sharing reductions subsidy}}
A separate decision on the same day commonly associated with the executive order resulted in no longer paying the cost sharing reduction (CSR) subsidies, which are payments to insurers to keep premiums down for low-income persons. The [[Congressional Budget Office]] reported in August 2017 that not making the CSR payments could increase health insurance premiums on the ACA exchanges by as much as 20% and add nearly $200 billion to the budget deficit over a decade. The deficit increase is because the premium tax credit subsidy (the largest Affordable Care Act subsidy) increases to offset increases in health insurance premium amounts, far outweighing savings from not paying the smaller CSR subsidy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53009|title=The Effects of Terminating Payments for Cost-Sharing Reduction|work=[[Congressional Budget Office]]|publisher=[[Federal Government of the United States|United States Government]]|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|date=August 15, 2017|accessdate=October 17, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/reports/53009-costsharingreductions.pdf|archivedate=October 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Critics described the Executive Order as another part of an ongoing strategy to sabotage the ACA by enabling insurance companies to circumvent ACA mandates and sell insurance that does not cover mandated conditions, and excludes individuals with [[pre-existing condition]]s. Other elements alleged to be part of the sabotage strategy include denying funding not mandated by law for cost sharing reduction (CSR) subsidies, significantly reducing funding for enrollment advertising and support efforts, asserting that the ACA exchanges are in a "death spiral" (contrary to CBO conclusions), and conducting negative advertising campaigns, among other measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/12/16070724/trump-cost-sharing-reductions-pulled|title=Trump will pull Obamacare subsidies in another attack on health law|first=Dylan|last=Scott|work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|location=United States|date=October 12, 2017|accessdate=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/opinion/editorials/congress-cant-let-mr-trump-undo-obamacare-on-his-own.html?_r=0|author=Editorial Board|title=Congress Shouldn't Let Mr. Trump Kill Obamacare on His Own|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=[[New York City]]|date=October 12, 2017|accessdate=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, President Trump tweeted on October 13, 2017 that: "The Democrats ObamaCare is imploding. Massive subsidy payments to their pet insurance companies has stopped. Dems should call me to fix!". Journalist [[Ezra Klein]] wrote that: "Trump has long held the view that if he can inflict sufficient damage to the Affordable Care Act, Democrats will have no choice but to cut a deal — on Trump’s terms — to save it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/16/16480438/obamacare-trump-csrs|title=On Obamacare, Donald Trump is sabotaging himself|first=Ezra|last=Klein|authorlink=Ezra Klein|work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|location=United States|date=October 16, 2017|accessdate=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Journalist [[Sarah Kliff]] wrote that: "Trump announced last week he would stop making [CSR] payments. But let's be clear: That decision will cause the federal government to spend billions more subsidizing insurance companies, not less." That is because the savings from reducing CSR payments is less than increases in the insurance premium tax credits, which rise along with sizable (20%+) premium increases for 2018 caused by Trump's threats to the CSR payments during 2017. Kliff used the CBO estimate of $194 billion in higher budget deficits from stopping CSR payments as an estimate of the net impact over a decade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vox.com/health-care/2017/10/18/16499806/trump-insurance-bailouts-completely-incoherent Vox-Sarah Kliff-Trump's stance on insurance "bailouts" is completely incoherent-October 18, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist [[David Leonhardt]] wrote on October 15, 2017: "Last week, the administration took several steps to deprive people of health insurance. In doing so, it has both a short-term goal (have the federal government do less to help vulnerable citizens) and a long-term goal (sabotage Obamacare, so that Congress can more easily repeal the law)". He continued: "When [the executive order] takes full effect, it will most likely allow a variety of cheap insurance plans that don’t cover many treatments. These plans will siphon healthy families from the normal markets, raising prices on the sick. It will work nicely for healthy families, until it doesn’t. If they get sick and want insurance that pays for their treatments, they will be out of luck".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/15/opinion/columnists/how-to-fight-the-new-trumpcare.html|title=How to Fight the New Trumpcare|first=David|last=Leonhardt|authorlink=David Leonhardt|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=[[New York City]]|date=October 15, 2017|accessdate=October 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to &lt;i&gt;[[The Economist]]&lt;/i&gt;, Trump’s plans "are likely to end up inflicting the most pain on self-employed, middle- to upper-income folk—in other words, on a Republican constituency".&lt;ref name="Economist" &gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2017/10/poor-pain-management|author=H.C.|title=Donald Trump's health-care orders will hurt middle-class, self-employed Americans|magazine=[[The Economist]]|publisher=[[The Economist Group]]|location=[[City of Westminster|Westminster]], [[London]]|issn=0013-0613|date=October 13, 2017|accessdate=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Murray—Alexander Individual Market Stabilization Bill====

{{Main|Murray—Alexander Individual Market Stabilization Bill}}

Senator [[Lamar Alexander]] and Senator [[Patty Murray]] reached a compromise to amend the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]] to fund cost cost-sharing reductions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/us/politics/alexander-murray-deal-obamacare-subsidies.html?_r=0|title=2 Senators Strike Deal on Health Subsidies That Trump Cut Off|first1=Thomas|last1=Kaplan|first2=Robert|last2=Pear|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=[[New York City]]|date=October 17, 2017|access-date=October 18, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Trump had stopped paying the cost sharing subsidies and the [[Congressional Budget Office]] estimated his action would cost $200 billion, cause insurance sold on the exchange to cost 20% more and cause one million people to lose insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/2017/8/15/16153094/voxcare-cbo-trump-obamacare-sabotage-premiums|title=CBO says Trump's Obamacare sabotage would cost $194 billion, drive up premiums 20%|first=Sarah|last=Kliff|work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|location=United States|date=August 15, 2017|access-date=October 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan will also provide more flexibility for state waivers, allow a new "Copper Plan" or catastrophic coverage for all, allow interstate insurance compacts, and redirect consumer fees to states for outreach.

Although Trump initially expressed support for the compromise, he later reversed course by [[Twitter|tweeting]] a dismissive tweet about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/us/politics/trump-obamacare-subsidies-tweet-opposition.html|title=Trump Pulls Back From Senate Deal to Fund Health Subsidies|first1=Thomas|last1=Kaplan|first2=Tobert|last2=Pear|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=[[New York City]]|date=October 18, 2017|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13727">{{short description|United States healthcare designation}}
A '''Federally Qualified Health Center''' ('''FQHC''') is a reimbursement designation from the [[Bureau of Primary Health Care]] and the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]. This designation is significant for several health programs funded under the [[Health Center Consolidation Act]] (Section 330 of the [[Public Health Service Act]]).

FQHC is a community-based organization that provides comprehensive [[primary care]] and [[preventive care]], including [[health]], [[Oral hygiene|oral]], and [[mental health]]/[[substance abuse]] services to persons of all ages, regardless of their ability to pay or [[Health insurance in the United States|health insurance status]]. Thus, they are a critical component of the health care safety net.&lt;ref name=Doty_et_al-2010&gt;{{cite web|title=Enhancing the Capacity of Community Health Centers to Achieve High Performance|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Publications/Fund-Reports/2010/May/Enhancing-the-Capacity-of-Community-Health-Centers-to-Achieve-High-Performance.aspx?page=all|publisher=The Commonwealth Fund|author=Michelle M. Doty|author2=Melinda K. Abrams |author3=Susan E. Hernandez |author4=Kristof Stremikis |author5=Anne C. Beal |date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; FQHCs are called Community/Migrant Health Centers (C/MHC), Community Health Centers (CHC), and 330 Funded Clinics. FQHCs are automatically designated as [[Healthcare shortage area|health professional shortage facilities]].

==Funded programs==
Health programs funded include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bphc.hrsa.gov/about/|title=About the Health Center Program|website=bphc.hrsa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Community health centers in the United States|Community Health Centers]] which serve a variety of federally designated [[Healthcare shortage areas|Medically Underserved Area/Populations]] (MUA or MUP). 
*Migrant Health Centers which provide culturally competent and primary preventive medical care to migrant and seasonal agricultural workers,&lt;ref name=specialpopulations/&gt;
*Health Care for the Homeless Programs which reach out to homeless individuals and families and provide primary and preventive care and substance abuse services,&lt;ref name=specialpopulations/&gt; and
*Public Housing Primary Care Programs that serve residents of public housing and are located in or adjacent to the communities they serve.&lt;ref name=specialpopulations/&gt;

==Leadership==
FQHCs operate under a consumer Board of Directors governance structure and function under the supervision of the [[Health Resources and Services Administration]] (HRSA), which is part of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS). FQHCs were originally meant to provide comprehensive health services to the medically underserved to reduce the patient load on hospital [[emergency room]]s.

Their mission has changed since their founding. Their mission now is to enhance primary care services in underserved urban and rural communities.&lt;ref name=cms201111&gt;{{cite web|title=Federally Qualified Health Center|url=https://www.cms.gov/site-search/search-results.html?q=federally%20qualified%20health%20centers%20medicare|publisher=Department of Health and Human Services.

FQHCs provide their services to all persons regardless of ability to pay, and charge for services on a community board approved [[Sliding scale fees|sliding-fee scale]] that is based on patients' family income and size. FQHCs must comply with Section 330 program requirements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In return for serving all patients regardless of ability to pay, the centers receive from the Federal government cash grant, cost-based reimbursement for their Medicaid patients, and malpractice coverage under the [[Federal Tort Claims Act]] (FTCA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bphc.hrsa.gov/ftca/about/index.html|title=About the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA)|website=bphc.hrsa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Look-Alikes==
The government also designates a category of health centers as "FQHC Look-Alikes."  These health centers do not receive grants under Section 330 but are determined by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to meet the requirements for receiving a grant based on the Health Resources and Services Administration recommendations.&lt;ref name=cms201111/&gt; Also, FQHC Look-Alikes receive cost-based reimbursement for their Medicaid services, but do not receive malpractice coverage under FTCA or a cash grant. Look-Alikes also qualify as health professional shortage areas (HPSA) automatically.

==Services under Medicare==
FQHC benefit under [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] became effective October 1, 1991, when Section 1861(aa) of the [[Social Security Act]] was amended by Section 4161 of the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990]].&lt;ref name=cms201111/&gt; FQHCs provide Medicare beneficiaries with preventive primary health services such as immunizations, visual acuity and hearing screenings, and prenatal and post-partum care.&lt;ref name=cms201111/&gt; However, eyeglasses, hearing aids, and preventive dental services are not covered under the FQHC preventive primary services. A FQHC [[Prospective payment system|Prospective Payment System]] (PPS) was scheduled to be implemented in 2014.&lt;ref name=cms201111/&gt; The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandates that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) collect and analyze health services data prior to developing and implementing the new payment system. This requires that the appropriate revenue code and [[Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System]] (HCPCS) code be listed with each service provided.&lt;ref name=cms201111/&gt; Currently,{{when|date=May 2017}} Medicare pays FQHC directly based on an all-inclusive per visit payment.&lt;ref name=cms201111/&gt;

==Advanced Primary Care Practice demonstration project==
In June 2011, the Department of Health and Human Services announced the Federally Qualified Health Center Advanced Primary Care Practice (FQHC APCP) demonstration project.&lt;ref name=hhs20110606a&gt;
{{cite web

|date=June 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This demonstration project is conducted under the authority of Section 1115A of the Social Security Act, which was added by section 3021 of the ACA and establishes the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (Innovation Center).&lt;ref name=CMS1230557&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CMS and Innovation Center in partnership with HRSA will operate the demonstration.&lt;ref name=cms201111/&gt;&lt;ref name=CMS1230557/&gt; This initiative was designed to evaluate the impact of the advanced primary care practice (APCP) model, also referred to as the [[Patient centered medical home|patient-centered medical home]] (PCMH) on improving health, quality of care and lowering the cost of care provided to Medicare beneficiaries.&lt;ref name=cms201111/&gt;&lt;ref name=CMS1230557/&gt; The ACA will pay an estimated $42 million over three years (November 1, 2011 to October 31, 2014) to 500 FQHCs to coordinate care for 195,000 Medicare patients.&lt;ref name=cms201111/&gt;&lt;ref name=hhs20110606a/&gt;&lt;ref name=CMS1230557/&gt; Participating FQHCs agree to adopt care coordination practices set by the [[National Committee for Quality Assurance]] (NCQA) and are expected to achieve Level 3 patient-centered medical home recognition.&lt;ref name=cms201111/&gt;&lt;ref name=hhs20110606a/&gt;

President Bush launched the [[Health Centers Initiative]] to significantly increase access to primary health care services in 1,200 communities through new or expanded health center sites. Between 2001 and 2006, the number of patients treated at health centers increased by over 4.7 million, representing a nearly 50 percent increase in just five years. In 2006 the number of patients served topped the 15 million mark for the first time.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Throughout the United States there are over 1,000 health centers that operate approximately 6,000 sites.&lt;ref name=Doty_et_al-2010/&gt; In 2010, the health centers served an estimated 20 million patients.&lt;ref name=specialpopulations&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, during 2010 health centers served 862,775 migrant and seasonal farm workers and their families; more than 1 million individuals experiencing homelessness; and 172,731 residents of public housing.&lt;ref name=specialpopulations/&gt;

==Impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act==
The health center program's annual federal funding has grown from $1.16 billion in fiscal year 2001 to $1.99 billion in fiscal year 2007. The passage of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (ACA) in March 2010 resulted in provisions that increased federal funding to FQHCs to help them meet the anticipated health care demand of millions of Americans who will gain health care coverage as result of the health reform law.&lt;ref name=kff201104&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary of New Health Reform Law|url=http://www.kff.org/healthreform/8061.cfm|publisher=The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACA set aside $11 billion for community health centers over a period of five years to meet this goal.&lt;ref name=kff201104/&gt;

'''Foodborne illness''' (also '''foodborne disease''' and colloquially referred to as '''food poisoning''')&lt;ref&gt;
{{DorlandsDict|nine/000952820|food poisoning}}
&lt;/ref&gt; is any [[illness]] resulting from the food spoilage of [[Food contaminant|contaminated food]], [[pathogen]]ic [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, or [[parasite]]s that contaminate food,&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[toxin]]s such as [[poisonous mushrooms]] and various species of [[Bean#Toxins|beans that have not been boiled]] for at least 10 minutes.

Symptoms vary depending on the cause, and are described below in this article.  A few broad generalizations can be made, e.g.:  The [[incubation period]] ranges from hours to days, depending on the cause and on how much was consumed.  The incubation period tends to cause sufferers to not associate the symptoms with the item consumed, and so to cause sufferers to attribute the symptoms to [[gastroenteritis]] for example.

Symptoms often include vomiting, fever, and aches, and may include diarrhea. Bouts of vomiting can be repeated with an extended delay in between, because even if infected food was eliminated from the stomach in the first bout, [[microbe]]s (if applicable) can pass through the [[stomach]] into the [[intestine]] and begin to multiply. Some types of microbes stay in the intestine, some produce a [[toxin]] that is absorbed into the [[blood]]stream, and some can directly invade deeper body tissues.

==Causes==
{{see also|Pathogen}}
[[File:Foodinfridgetext.jpg|thumb|Poorly stored food in a refrigerator]]
Foodborne illness usually arises from improper handling, preparation, or [[food storage]]. Good [[hygiene]] practices before, during, and after food preparation can reduce the chances of contracting an illness. There is a consensus in the public health community that regular hand-washing is one of the most effective defenses against the spread of foodborne illness. The action of monitoring food to ensure that it will not cause foodborne illness is known as [[food safety]]. Foodborne disease can also be caused by a large variety of toxins that affect the environment.&lt;ref&gt;For foodborne illness caused by chemicals, see [[Food contaminants]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, foodborne illness can be caused by [[pesticide]]s or [[medicine]]s in food and natural toxic substances such as [[mushroom poisoning|poisonous mushrooms]] or [[tetrodotoxin|reef fish]].

===Bacteria===
[[Bacteria]] are a common cause of foodborne illness. In the [[United Kingdom]] during 2000, the individual bacteria involved were the following: ''[[Campylobacter jejuni]]'' 77.3%, ''[[Salmonella]]'' 20.9%, [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|''Escherichia coli'' O157:H7]] 1.4%, and all others less than 0.56%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  In the past, bacterial infections were thought to be more prevalent because few places had the capability to test for [[norovirus]] and no active surveillance was being done for this particular agent. Toxins from bacterial infections are delayed because the bacteria need time to multiply. As a result, symptoms associated with intoxication are usually not seen until 12–72 hours or more after eating contaminated food. However, in some cases, such as Staphylococcal food poisoning, the onset of illness can be as soon as 30 minutes after ingesting contaminated food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/diseases/staphylococcal.html |title=Staphylococcal Food Poisoning |accessdate=3 July 2016 |publisher=U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most common bacterial foodborne pathogens are:
*''[[Campylobacter|Campylobacter jejuni]]'' which can lead to secondary [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]] and [[periodontitis]]&lt;ref name=cazp&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2007.01.006 | pmid=17368847 | volume=117 | issue=3 | title=Campylobacters as zoonotic pathogens: a food production perspective |date=2007  |vauthors=Humphrey T, O'Brien S, Madsen M | pages=237–57 | journal=International Journal of Food Microbiology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Escherichia coli O157:H7]]'' enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) which can cause [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]]

Other common bacterial foodborne pathogens are:

*''[[Actinobacteria|Corynebacterium ulcerans]]''
*''[[Q fever|Coxiella burnetii]]'' or Q fever
*''[[Plesiomonas shigelloides]]''

==== Enterotoxins ====
{{see also|Botulism}}

In addition to disease caused by direct bacterial infection, some foodborne illnesses are caused by [[enterotoxin]]s ([[exotoxin]]s targeting the intestines). Enterotoxins can produce illness even when the microbes that produced them have been killed. Symptom appearance varies with the toxin but may be rapid in onset, as in the case of enterotoxins of ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' in which symptoms appear in one to six hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/food-poisoning/DS00981/DSECTION=causes Food poisoning: Causes]. Mayo Clinic.&lt;/ref&gt; This causes intense [[vomiting]] including or not including diarrhea (resulting in [[staphylococcal enteritis]]), and staphylococcal enterotoxins (most commonly [[staphylococcal enterotoxin A]] but also including [[staphylococcal enterotoxin B]]) are the most commonly reported enterotoxins although cases of poisoning are likely underestimated.&lt;ref name=Staph&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Argudín MÁ, Mendoza MC, Rodicio MR |title=Food poisoning and Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins |journal=Toxins (Basel) |volume=2 |issue=7 |pages=1751–73 |date=2010 |pmid=22069659 |pmc=3153270 |doi=10.3390/toxins2071751 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs mainly in cooked and processed foods due to competition with other biota in raw foods, and humans are the main cause of contamination as a substantial percentage of humans are persistent carriers of ''S. aureus''.&lt;ref name=Staph/&gt; The CDC has estimated about 240,000 cases per year in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ohioline.osu.edu/hyg-fact/5000/pdf/5564.pdf Staphylococcus aureus: A Problem When Food Is Left Out Too Long]. Ohio State University Extension HYG-5564-11].&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Clostridium botulinum]]''
*''[[Clostridium perfringens]]''
*''[[Bacillus cereus]]''

The rare but potentially deadly disease [[botulism]] occurs when the [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] bacterium ''[[Clostridium botulinum]]'' grows in improperly canned low-acid foods and produces [[botulin]], a powerful paralytic toxin.

''Pseudoalteromonas tetraodonis'', certain species of [[Pseudomonas]] and [[Vibrio]], and some other bacteria, produce the lethal [[tetrodotoxin]], which is present in the [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] of some living animal species rather than being a product of [[decomposition]].

====Emerging foodborne pathogens====
Many foodborne illnesses remain poorly understood.

*''[[Aeromonas hydrophila]]'', ''Aeromonas caviae'', ''Aeromonas sobria''

====Preventing bacterial food poisoning====
[[File:Kingfish great south bay.jpg|thumb|Proper storage and [[refrigeration]] of [[food]] help in the prevention of food poisoning]]
Prevention is mainly the role of the state, through the definition of strict rules of [[hygiene]] and a [[public services]] of [[veterinary medicine|veterinary]] surveying of animal products in the food chain, from [[farming]] to the transformation industry and delivery (shops and [[restaurant]]s). This regulation includes:
* [[traceability]]: in a final product, it must be possible to know the origin of the ingredients (originating farm, identification of the harvesting or of the animal) and where and when it was processed; the origin of the illness can thus be tracked and solved (and possibly penalized), and the final products can be removed from the sale if a problem is detected;
* enforcement of hygiene procedures such as [[HACCP]] and the "[[cold chain]]";
* power of control and of law enforcement of [[veterinarian]]s.

In August 2006, the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved [[Phage therapy]] which involves spraying meat with viruses that infect bacteria, and thus preventing infection. This has raised concerns, because without [[mandatory labelling]] consumers would not be aware that meat and poultry products have been treated with the spray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/business/healthcare/feeds/ap/2006/08/18/ap2959720.html |title=FDA Says Viruses Safe for Treating Meat |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825040502/http://www.forbes.com/business/healthcare/feeds/ap/2006/08/18/ap2959720.html|archivedate=August 25, 2006|accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At home, prevention mainly consists of good [[food safety]] practices. Many forms of bacterial poisoning can be prevented by cooking it sufficiently, and either eating it quickly or refrigerating it effectively.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt; Many toxins, however, are not destroyed by heat treatment.

Techniques that help prevent food borne illness in the kitchen are hand washing, rinsing [[produce]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2010/11/09/good-question-does-washing-fruit-do-anything/|title=Good Question: Does Washing Fruit Do Anything?|last=DeRusha|first=Jason|access-date=2016-09-18|date=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; preventing cross-contamination, proper storage, and maintaining cooking temperatures. In general, freezing or refrigerating prevents virtually all bacteria from growing, and heating food sufficiently kills parasites, viruses, and most bacteria. Bacteria grow most rapidly at the range of temperatures between {{convert|40|and|140|°F|°C}}, called the "danger zone". Storing food below or above the "danger zone" can effectively limit the production of toxins. For storing leftovers, the food must be put in shallow containers
for quick cooling and must be refrigerated within two hours. When food is reheated, it must reach an internal temperature of {{convert|165|F|C}} or until hot or steaming to kill bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/safe-food-handling/how-temperatures-affect-food/ct_index How Temperatures Affect Food]. U.D. Department of Agriculture&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mycotoxins and alimentary mycotoxicoses ===
The term [[alimentary mycotoxicosis]] refers to the effect of poisoning by [[mycotoxin]]s through food consumption.  The term mycotoxin is usually reserved for the toxic chemical products produced by fungi that readily colonize crops. Mycotoxins sometimes have important effects on human and animal health.  For example, an outbreak which occurred in the UK in 1960 caused the death of 100,000 turkeys which had consumed [[aflatoxin]]-contaminated peanut meal.  In the [[USSR]] in [[World War II]], 5,000 people died due to [[alimentary toxic aleukia]] (ALA).&lt;ref name=fam&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The common foodborne [[Mycotoxins]] include:
* [[Aflatoxin]]s – originating from ''[[Aspergillus parasiticus]]'' and ''[[Aspergillus flavus]]''. They are frequently found in tree nuts, peanuts, maize, sorghum and other oilseeds, including corn and cottonseeds. The pronounced forms of [[Aflatoxins]] are those of B1, B2, G1, and G2, amongst which Aflatoxin B1 predominantly targets the liver, which will result in [[necrosis]], [[cirrhosis]], and [[carcinoma]].&lt;ref name=afltx&gt;

===Viruses===
[[Virus|Viral]] infections make up perhaps one third of cases of food poisoning in developed countries. In the US, more than 50% of cases are viral and [[Norwalk virus group|noroviruses]] are the most common foodborne illness, causing 57% of outbreaks in 2004. Foodborne viral infection are usually of intermediate (1–3 days) [[incubation period]], causing illnesses which are self-limited in otherwise healthy individuals; they are similar to the bacterial forms described above.
* [[Enterovirus]]
* [[Hepatitis A]] is distinguished from other viral causes by its prolonged (2–6 week) [[incubation period]] and its ability to spread beyond the stomach and intestines into the [[liver]]. It often results in [[jaundice]], or yellowing of the skin, but rarely leads to chronic liver dysfunction. The virus has been found to cause infection due to the consumption of fresh-cut produce which has fecal contamination.&lt;ref name=ivcma&gt;

===Natural toxins===
Several foods can naturally contain [[toxins]], many of which are not produced by bacteria. Plants in particular may be toxic; animals which are naturally poisonous to eat are rare. In evolutionary terms, animals can escape being eaten by fleeing; plants can use only passive defenses such as poisons and distasteful substances, for example [[capsaicin]] in [[chili pepper]]s and pungent [[sulfur]] compounds in [[garlic]] and [[onion]]s. Most animal poisons are not synthesised by the animal, but acquired by eating poisonous plants to which the animal is immune, or by bacterial action.
* [[Alkaloid]]s
* [[Ciguatera poisoning]]
* [[Grayanotoxin]] ([[honey]] intoxication)
* [[Mushroom poisoning|Mushroom toxins]]
* [[Phytohaemagglutinin]] (red [[kidney bean]] poisoning; destroyed by boiling)
* [[Pyrrolizidine alkaloid]]s
* Shellfish toxin, including [[paralytic shellfish poisoning]], diarrhetic shellfish poisoning, neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, [[domoic acid|amnesic shellfish poisoning]] and [[ciguatera]] fish poisoning
* [[Scombrotoxin]]
* [[Tetrodotoxin]] ([[fugu fish]] poisoning)

Some plants contain substances which are toxic in large doses, but have therapeutic properties in appropriate dosages.
* [[Foxglove]] contains [[cardiac glycosides]].
* Poisonous hemlock ([[conium]]) has medicinal uses.

===Other pathogenic agents===
* [[Prion]]s, resulting in [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] (CJD) and its variant (vCJD)

==="Ptomaine poisoning" {{anchor|ptomaine}}===
In 1883, the Italian, Professor Salmi, of Bologna, introduced the generic name ''{{linktext|ptomaine}}'' (from Greek ''ptōma'',  "fall, fallen body, corpse") for [[alkaloid]]s found in decaying animal and vegetable matter, especially (as reflected in their names) [[putrescine]] and [[cadaverine]].&lt;ref name="oed"
&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|date=1933|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=London|page=1557|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1892 ''Merck's Bulletin'' stated, "We name such products of bacterial origin ptomaines; and the special [[alkaloid]] produced by the [[Vibrio|comma bacillus]] is variously named Cadaverine, Putrescine, etc."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uEBYAAAAMAAJ ''Merck's Bulletin'', Volume 5], William Henry Porter, 1892.&lt;/ref&gt; While ''[[The Lancet]]'' stated, "The chemical ferments produced in the system, the... ptomaines which may exercise so disastrous an influence."&lt;ref&gt;Lancet, 3 Oct 1891, page 752&lt;/ref&gt; It is now known that the "disastrous... influence" is due to the direct action of [[bacteria]] and only slightly to the alkaloids. Thus, the use of the phrase "ptomaine poisoning" is now obsolete.

Tainted [[potato salad]] sickening hundreds at a [[Communist Party, USA|Communist]] political convention in [[Massillon, Ohio]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/image/10618541/ "Report Next Week,"] ''Evening Independent'' (Massillon, OH), July 22, 1932, pg. 6&lt;/ref&gt; and aboard a Washington DC cruise boat in separate incidents during a single week in 1932 drew national attention to the dangers of so-called "ptomaine poisoning" in the pages of the American news weekly, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]].''&lt;ref&gt;"Medicine: Potato Salad," ''Time,'' August 1, 1932.&lt;/ref&gt;
Another newspaper article from 1944 told of more than 150 persons being hospitalized in Chicago with ptomaine poisoning apparently from [[rice pudding]] served by a chain of restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Poisoning Hits 150 in Chicago|url=http://ken.stparchive.com/Archive/KEN/KEN05271944p01.php|work=Kenosha Evening News|date=May 27, 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==

===Incubation period===
The delay between the consumption of contaminated food and the appearance of the first [[symptom]]s of illness is called the [[incubation period]]. This ranges from hours to days (and rarely months or even years, such as in the case of [[listeriosis]] or [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]]), depending on the agent, and on how much was consumed. If symptoms occur within one to six hours after eating the food, it suggests that it is caused by a bacterial toxin or a chemical rather than live bacteria.

The long incubation period of many foodborne illnesses tends to cause sufferers to attribute their symptoms to [[gastroenteritis]].

During the incubation period, [[microbe]]s pass through the [[stomach]] into the [[intestine]], attach to the [[cell (biology)|cells]] lining the intestinal walls, and begin to multiply there. Some types of microbes stay in the intestine, some produce a [[toxin]] that is absorbed into the [[blood]]stream, and some can directly invade the deeper body tissues. The symptoms produced depend on the type of microbe.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|work=US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/food/index.htm |title=Food-Related Diseases|date=2018-03-29 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infectious dose===
The [[infectious dose]] is the amount of agent that must be consumed to give rise to symptoms of foodborne illness, and varies according to the agent and the consumer's age and overall health. Pathogens vary in minimum infectious dose; for example, ''[[Shigella sonnei]]'' has a low estimated minimum dose of &lt; 500 [[colony-forming unit]]s (CFU) while ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' has a relatively high estimate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greig|first=Judy D|date=|title=Infective Doses and Pathogen Carriage|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265305465|journal=|publisher=Public Health Agency of Canada|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of ''[[Salmonella]]'' a relatively large inoculum of 1 million to 1 billion organisms is necessary to produce symptoms in healthy human volunteers,&lt;ref&gt;Owens, Michael D (January 2014) [http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic515.htm Salmonella Infection in Emergency Medicine]. emedicine.com&lt;/ref&gt; as ''Salmonellae'' are very sensitive to acid. An unusually high stomach [[pH]] level (low acidity) greatly reduces the number of bacteria required to cause symptoms by a factor of between 10 and 100.

==Epidemiology==
Asymptomatic [[subclinical infection]] may help spread these diseases, particularly ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', ''[[Campylobacter]], [[Salmonella]], [[Shigella]], [[Vibrio cholerae|V. cholerae]],'' and [[Yersinia pestis|''Yersinia'']].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, as of 1984 it was estimated that in the United States, 200,000 people were asymptomatic carriers of ''Salmonella''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Infants===
{{Main | Infant food safety}}
Globally, infants are a population that are especially vulnerable to foodborne disease. The World Health Organization has issued recommendations for the preparation, use and storage of prepared formulas.

===Australia===

A study by the Australian National University,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kirk|first1=Martyn|title=Foodborne illness in Australia: Annual incidence circa 2010 pp7-9|url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-foodborne-illness-aust|website=Australia Department of Health|publisher=Australian National University|accessdate=13 September 2015|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in November 2014, found in 2010 that there were an estimated 4.1 million cases of foodborne gastroenteritis acquired in Australia on average each year, along with 5,140 cases of non-gastrointestinal illness. The study was funded by the Australian Department of Health, Food Standards Australia New Zealand and the NSW Food Authority.

The main causes were Norovirus, pathogenic Escherichia coli, Campylobacter spp. and non-typhoidal Salmonella spp., although the causes of approximately 80% of illnesses were unknown. Approximately 25% (90% CrI: 13%–42%) of the 15.9 million episodes of gastroenteritis that occur in Australia were estimated to be transmitted by contaminated food. This equates to an average of approximately one episode of foodborne gastroenteritis every five years per person. Data on the number of hospitalisations and deaths represent the occurrence of serious foodborne illness. Including gastroenteritis, non-gastroenteritis and sequelae, there were an estimated annual 31,920 (90% CrI: 29,500–35,500) hospitalisations due to foodborne illness and 86 (90% CrI: 70–105) deaths due to foodborne illness circa 2010. This study concludes that these rates are similar to recent estimates in the US and Canada.

A main aim of this study was to compare if foodborne illness incidence had increased over time. In this study, similar methods of assessment were applied to data from circa 2000, which showed that the rate of foodborne gastroenteritis had not changed significantly over time. Two key estimates were the total number of gastroenteritis episodes each year, and the proportion considered foodborne. In circa 2010, it was estimated that 25% of all episodes of gastroenteritis were foodborne. By applying this proportion of episodes due to food to the incidence of gastroenteritis circa 2000, there were an estimated 4.3 million (90% CrI: 2.2–7.3 million) episodes of foodborne gastroenteritis circa 2000, although credible intervals overlap with 2010. Taking into account changes in population size, applying these equivalent methods suggests a 17% decrease in the rate of foodborne gastroenteritis between 2000 and 2010, with considerable overlap of the 90% credible intervals.

This study replaces a previous estimate of 5.4 million cases of food-borne illness in Australia every year, causing:&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
* 18,000 hospitalizations
* 120 deaths (0.5 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants)
* 2.1 million lost days off work
* 1.2 million doctor consultations
* 300,000 prescriptions for antibiotics.

Most foodborne disease outbreaks in Australia have been linked to raw or minimally cooked eggs or poultry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Astridge, K |author2=McPherson, M |author3=Kirk, M|title=Foodborne disease outbreaks in Australia 2001-2009|journal=Food Australia|date=2011|volume=63 |issue=12|pages=44–50|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian Food Safety Information Council]] estimates that one third of cases of food poisoning occur in the home&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Hygiene|url=https://www.bupa.com.au/health-and-wellness/health-information/healthy-living/nutrition/eating/doc/food-hygiene|website=BUPA|accessdate=13 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211131645/https://www.bupa.com.au/health-and-wellness/health-information/healthy-living/nutrition/eating/doc/food-hygiene|archivedate=December 11, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outbreaks===
{{Main article|Deadliest foodborne illness incidents}}
The vast majority of reported cases of foodborne illness occur as individual or sporadic cases. The origin of most sporadic cases is undetermined. In the United States, where people eat outside the home frequently, 58% of cases originate from commercial food facilities (2004 FoodNet data).   An outbreak is defined as occurring when two or more people experience similar illness after consuming food from a common source.

Often, a combination of events contributes to an outbreak, for example, food might be left at room temperature for many hours, allowing bacteria to [[multiplication|multiply]] which is compounded by inadequate cooking which results in a failure to kill the dangerously elevated bacterial levels.

Outbreaks are usually identified when those affected know each other. However, more and more, outbreaks are identified by [[public health]] staff from unexpected increases in laboratory results for certain strains of bacteria. Outbreak detection and investigation in the United States is primarily handled by local health jurisdictions and is inconsistent from district to district. It is estimated that 1–2% of outbreaks are detected.

==Society and culture==

===United Kingdom===

In postwar Aberdeen (1964) a large-scale (&gt;400 cases) outbreak of [[typhoid]] occurred, caused by contaminated [[corned beef]] which had been imported from [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;
Smith, David F.; Diack, H. Lesley and Pennington, T. Hugh (2005) ''Food Poisoning, Policy and Politics : Corned Beef and Typhoid in Britain in the 1960s''. Boydell Press. {{ISBN|1-84383-138-4}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The corned beef was placed in cans and because the cooling plant had failed, cold river water from the [[Río de la Plata|Plate estuary]] was used to cool the cans. One of the cans had a defect and the meat inside was contaminated. This meat was then sliced using a meat slicer in a shop in Aberdeen, and a lack of cleaning the machinery led to spreading the contamination to other meats cut in the slicer. These meats were then eaten by the people of Aberdeen who then became ill.

Serious outbreaks of foodborne illness since the 1970s prompted key changes in UK [[food safety]] law. These included the death of 19 patients in the Stanley Royd Hospital outbreak&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://briandeer.com/social/stanley-royd.htm|title=Food poison deaths probe may reveal NHS flaws|date=February 24, 1985|author=Brian Deer|work=The Sunday Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE, mad cow disease) outbreak identified in the 1980s. The death of 21 people in the [[1996 Wishaw outbreak]] of ''E. coli'' O157&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/154107.stm|title=BBC News - Health - Sheriff criticises E. coli butcher|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2869700/pdf/11467789.pdf|title=Epidemiological investigation of the Central Scotland outbreak of Escherichia coli O157 infection, November to December 1996|year=2001|volume=126|issue=3|pages= 335–341|journal=Epidemiol.

In May 2015, for the second year running, England’s Food Standards Agency devoted its annual Food Safety Week to – “The Chicken Challenge”. The focus was on the handling of raw chicken in the home and in catering facilities in a drive to reduce the worryingly high levels of food poisoning from the ''campylobacter'' bacterium. Anne Hardy argues that widespread public education of food hygiene can be useful, particularly through media (T.V cookery programmes) and advertisement. She points to the examples set by [[Scandinavia]]n societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/food-poisoning-an-on-going-saga|title=Food Poisoning: An On-going Saga|last=Hardy|first=Anne|date=13 January 2016|website=History and Policy|publisher=History and Policy|access-date=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In 2001, the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]] petitioned the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] to require meat packers to remove [[spinal cord]]s before processing cattle carcasses for human consumption, a measure designed to lessen the risk of infection by variant [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]]. The petition was supported by the [[American Public Health Association]], the [[Consumer Federation of America]], the [[Government Accountability Project]], the [[National Consumers League]], and Safe Tables Our Priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2004/01/12/04-626/meat-produced-by-advanced-meatbone-separation-machinery-and-meat-recovery-amr-systems#footnote-10 |accessdate=3 July 2016 |title=Meat Produced by Advanced Meat/Bone Separation Machinery and Meat Recovery (AMR) Systems |website=Federal Register |publisher=U.S. National Archive and Records Administration|date=2004-01-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was opposed by the [[National Cattlemen's Beef Association]], the National Renderers Association, the [[National Meat Association]], the Pork Producers Council, sheep raisers, milk producers, the Turkey Federation, and eight other organizations from the animal-derived food industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.organicconsumers.org/old_articles/madcow/stauber011503.php |accessdate=3 July 2016 |title=Livestock Industry Opposed to Stricter Laws on Mad Cow Prevention |date=January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the US Department of Health and Human Services targets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthypeople.gov|title=Healthy People 2010 Home Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; regarding incidence of foodborne infections were reached in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Preliminary FoodNet data on the incidence of infection with pathogens transmitted commonly through food—10 states, 2007 |journal=MMWR Morb.

A report issued in June 2018 by NBC's Minneapolis station using research by both the CDC and the Minnesota Department of Health concluded that foodborne illness is on the rise in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kare11.com/article/news/why-are-we-seeing-so-many-food-recalls/89-564858966|title=Why are we seeing so many food recalls?|publisher=KARE 11|first1=Gordon|last1=Severson|date=June 15, 2018|access-date=June 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC has reported approximately four thousand cases of food poisoning annually in the last few years. Experts cite increased handling of food by humans as a major contributor, leading to outbreaks of parasites such as ''E. coli'' and cyclospora which can only come from human fecal matter.

===Organizations===

The [[World Health Organization]] Department of Food Safety and Zoonoses (FOS) provides scientific advice for organizations and the public on issues concerning the safety of food. Its mission is to lower the burden of foodborne disease, thereby strengthening the health security and sustainable development of Member States. Foodborne and waterborne diarrhoeal diseases kill an estimated 2.2 million people annually, most of whom are children. WHO works closely with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to address food safety issues along the entire food production chain—from production to consumption—using new methods of risk analysis. These methods provide efficient, science-based tools to improve food safety, thereby benefiting both public health and economic development.

===International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN)===

The International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) is a joint program of the WHO and FAO. INFOSAN has been connecting national authorities from around the globe since 2004, with the goal of preventing the international spread of contaminated food and foodborne disease and strengthening food safety systems globally. This is done by:

# Promoting the rapid exchange of information during food safety events;
# Sharing information on important food safety issues of global interest;
# Promoting partnership and collaboration between countries; and
# Helping countries strengthen their capacity to manage food safety risks.

Membership to INFOSAN is voluntary, but is restricted to representatives from national and regional government authorities and requires an official letter of designation. INFOSAN seeks to reflect the multidisciplinary nature of food safety and promote intersectoral collaboration by requesting the designation of Focal Points in each of the respective national authorities with a stake in food safety, and a single Emergency Contact Point in the national authority with the responsibility for coordinating national food safety emergencies; countries choosing to be members of INFOSAN are committed to sharing information between their respective food safety authorities and other INFOSAN members. The operational definition of a food safety authority includes those authorities involved in: food policy; risk assessment; food control and management; food inspection services; foodborne disease surveillance and response; laboratory services for monitoring and surveillance of foods and foodborne diseases; and food safety information, education and communication across the [[farm-to-table]] continuum.

===Prioritisation of food-borne pathogens===

Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and The World Health Organization published have made a global ranking of food-borne parasites using a multicriteria ranking tool concluding that ''Taenia solium'' was the most relevant, followed by ''Echinococcus granulosus'', ''Echinococcus multilocularis'', and ''Toxoplasma gondii''&lt;ref name=fao&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=FAO, WHO |title=Multicriteria-based ranking for risk management of food-borne parasites. Microbiological Risk Assessment Series No. 23 |journal= |volume= |issue= |pages=324 p |date=2014 |pmid= |pmc= |doi=  |url=http://www.fao.org/publications/card/en/c/ee07c6ae-b86c-4d5f-915c-94c93ded7d9e/}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The same method was used regionally to rank the most important food-borne parasites in Europe ranking ''Echinococcus multilocularis'' of highest relevance, followed by ''Toxoplasma gondii'' and ''Trichinella spiralis''&lt;ref name=eur&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bouwknegt M, Devleesschauwer B, Graham H, Robertson LJ,  WB van der Giessen J, ((the Euro-FBP workshop participants)) |title=Prioritisation of food-borne parasites in Europe, 2016 |journal=Euro Surveill |volume=23 |issue=9 |pages= | year=2018 | pmid=29510783 |pmc= 5840924|doi=10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2018.23.9.17-00161 | url=https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2018.23.9.17-00161#r1}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Regulatory steps===

Food may be contaminated during all stages of food production and retailing. In order to prevent viral contamination, regulatory authorities in Europe have enacted several measures:

* European Commission Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 of November 15, 2005
* [[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN): Standard method for the detection of norovirus and hepatitis A virus in food products (shellfish, fruits and vegetables, surfaces and bottled water)
* CODEX Committee on Food Hygiene (CCFH): Guideline for the application of general principles of food hygiene for the control of viruses in food&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/international_affairs/standard_setting_bodies/codex/organisations/eupositions/ccfh/index_en.htm "Codex Committee on Food Hygiene (CCFH)"], European Commission, Retrieved April 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Grim Reaper commercial''' is a 1987 [[Australia]]n [[television commercial]] aimed at raising public awareness on the dangers of [[AIDS]]. Created as part of a $3 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/photo_search.php?photo_id=552&amp;page=hivpictures.htm&amp;gallery_id=9&amp;page_type=photo |title=Aids Photo Library: Grim Reaper |accessdate=2008-11-09 |publisher=Avert }}&lt;/ref&gt; education campaign by the National Advisory Committee on AIDS (NACAIDS), the advertisement depicted the [[Grim Reaper]] [[bowling]] in a bowling alley and knocking over men, women, and child "pins" which represented AIDS victims. The commercial first screened on 5 April 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/photos/2007/07/23/1985594.htm|title=The Grim Reaper from AIDS ads |accessdate=2008-11-09 |date= 2007-10-23 |publisher=ABC }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was highly controversial, one reason being that the Grim Reaper became identified with gay men.&lt;ref name="pr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebody.com/content/art18128.html |title=Pioneer Regrets "Grim Reaper" Demonization of Gay Men |accessdate=2008-11-09 |date=2002-10-03 |publisher=The Body }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the commercial was regarded as highly successful in educating the Australian public about the issue. The commercial was created by Siimon Reynolds and spoken by [[voice-over artist]] [[John Stanton (actor)|John Stanton]].&lt;ref name="gnz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaynz.com/articles/publish/25/article_5442.php |title=New 'Grim Reaper' ad targets gay Aussies |accessdate=2013-10-03 |date=2008-01-10 |publisher=Gay NZ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Siimon Reynolds on the idea of the commercial:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/talkingheads/txt/s2371209.htm|title=Talking Heads - Siimon Reynolds |accessdate=2008-11-09 |date= 2008-09-22 |publisher=ABC }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...bowling was in my head. I was bowling every week. And I used to love the animation at Christmas with... for Scrooge, where the Grim Reaper came and visited Scrooge. And I thought, "Well, maybe the Grim Reaper could machine-gun them." Then I thought, no, that'll be a five-second ad and it'll be too short. What's another way he could kill them? He could bowl balls at them. And those two things came together.

Of course, back then, the data was unclear. In some countries - for instance, Italy - almost as many women who had AIDS as men. I think there was also a bit of a political fear that there'll be a backlash against gays if everybody thinks it's some kind of gay plague. But, you know, other countries had failed in their AIDS education because heterosexuals weren't listening. We really had to wake people up. There was a lot of information about how to stop AIDS out there, but no-one was reading it. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Controversy==
The commercial became controversial for offending some members of the gay community. Australian AIDS pioneer Ron Penny regretted the fact this occurred:&lt;ref name="pr" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The downside was that the Grim Reaper became identified with gay men rather than as the Reaper. That was what we had unintentionally produced - [the belief] by some that the Reaper was people with HIV infection, rather than the Reaper harvesting the dead.

I think there's never been anything on television or any media that has ever matched it in terms of impact, but no advertising can be without some downside, and that was never intended. But it at least made people aware and probably did change sexual practices of heterosexuals.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Ikatan Naturopatis Indonesia''' (Indonesian Naturopath Association, or I.N.I.) is the national organisation for traditional [[Chinese medicine]] practitioners (known as ''sin she'') in [[Indonesia]]. Address: Jln Hayam Wuruk no: 114.

Like modern medical organisations, the I.N.I. maintains a code of ethics for its members, and represents the interests of the traditional Chinese medical profession when dealing with the Indonesian government. It also promotes knowledge about Chinese medicine, not only within the [[Indonesian Chinese]] community, but also amongst the Indonesian population in general.

The I.N.I. is notable for launching a legal action in the Indonesian High Court (Makhamah agung), and for lobbying the Indonesian Attorney General (Jaksa agung), securing an exemption from [[Anti-Chinese legislation in Indonesia|a law banning the use of Chinese language in Indonesia]], allowing traditional Chinese herbalists to write prescriptions in the Chinese language, with a promise that the I.N.I. does not intend to rebel or overthrow the Indonesian government.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3101">The '''International Federation of Associations of Anatomists''' ('''IFAA''') is an umbrella scientific organization of national and multinational Anatomy Associations, dedicated to [[anatomy]] and biomorphological sciences.

==Origins and objectives==
In 1903, Prof. Nicolas, from [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], [[France]], was successful in founding the International Federation of Associations of Anatomists.

The first International Congress of Anatomy was held in [[Geneva]] in 1905 and started as a committee to organize five yearly conferences.

56 member Associations of the International Federation of Associations of Anatomists. The IFAA is the only international body representing all aspects of anatomy and anatomical associations.

Since 1989 the [[Federative International Committee on Anatomical Terminology]] (FICAT) under IFAA auspices, has met to analyze and study the [[International Morphological Terminology|international morphological terminology]] ([[Anatomy]], [[Histology]] and [[Embryology]]), releasing updated ''[[Terminologia Anatomica]]'' in 1998 and ''[[Terminologia Histologica]]'' in 2008.

==Biography==
Born into a wealthy, [[history of the Jews in Egypt|Jewish]], family in [[Cairo]], his father was a realtor and tile factory owner, he was, nonetheless, educated in a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] school, and, upon turning 18, travelled to [[Paris]] and [[Switzerland]], in order to study art at the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]], eventually, in 1960, immigrating to [[Israel]], where, after serving in the [[Artillery Corps (Israel)|Artillery Corps]], taking part in the [[Six-Day War]], during the 1960s and 1970s, he gathered, around himself, a group of artists and intellectuals, calling itself "The Third Eye," a [[commune]], dedicated to [[lysergic acid diethylamide]] and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], the ideas of [[Timothy Leary]], and, bands such as [[Pink Floyd]], [[The Moody Blues]], and, [[Grateful Dead]], which, included, amongst others, filmmakers and artists such as {{ill|Yael Aviv|he|יעל אביב}}, {{ill|Helit Yeshurun |he|הלית ישורון}}, [[Amnon Salomon]], {{ill|Daphna Arod|he|דפנה ערוד}}, {{ill|Ika Yisraeli|he|איקא ישראלי}}, and, {{ill|David Greenberg (director)|lt=David Greenberg|he|דוד גרינברג}}. He considered himself to be strongly influenced by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and the [[Marquis de Sade]], as well as, by [[surrealism]]'s artists such as [[André Masson]] and [[Hans Bellmer]], [[Dada]], the [[Situationist International]]'s artists such as [[Guy Debord]], the [[Beat Generation]], [[Bernard Malamud]], the band [[Faust (band)|Faust]], and, [[lettrism]], and, eventually, changed his last name, on [[Avoth Yeshurun]]'s suggestion, into a phonetic rendering of ''quatre mortes'', [[French language|French]] for "four deaths." His apartment, located at [[Dizengoff Street]] 40 in [[Tel Aviv]], where, eventually, his only film was shot, was a cornerstone of city life, during that time. He married translator, model, and, editor {{ill|Helit Yeshurun|he|הלית ישורון}}, daughter of poet [[Avoth Yeshurun]], while, working on his highly avant-garde [[1969 in film|1969]] film ''[[A Woman's Case]]'', in which, she starred, a time, during which, he met, and, casted into his film, model and [[it girl]] Ann Tochmeyer, most famous, during that period, for, appearing on the covers of magazines such as ''[[HaOlam HaZeh]]'', which, he married, after divorcing his wife, after he finished the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Slavick|first=Jean|script-title=he:הערב עם ז׳אק מורי־קתמור|trans-title=Tonight, with Jacques Mory-Katmor|date=30 October 1969|url=http://jpress.org.il/Olive/APA/NLI_Heb/SharedView.Article.aspx?parm=%2FZBcyTM2efPLRDKhPPbd2rV2nYdsaSQH9%2Fa3GO3vj8KEQHwqXyqQ86Nuk9%2FfrauOYw%3D%3D&amp;mode=image&amp;href=MAR%2f1969%2f10%2f30&amp;page=20&amp;rtl=true|language=Hebrew|work=[[Davar]]|location=Tel Aviv|access-date=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a commercial failure, and, hindered his ability to pursue his career as a filmmaker. Other works included creating television programs showcasing the works of artists such as [[Moshe Gershuni]], [[Yosl Bergner]] (1971), [[Yaacov Agam]] (1973), and, [[Michail Grobman]] (1974).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=he:'''מקרה אישה''' + '''מסע'''|trans-title=''[[A Woman's Case]]'' + ''Masa''|url=http://www.cinema.co.il/movies/movie.aspx?movieId=7730|language=Hebrew|work=[[Tel Aviv Cinematheque]]|access-date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some years later, around 1974, he left [[Israel]] for [[Cambodia]], [[Canada]], and, [[Thailand]], with Tochmeyer leaving for [[San Francisco]], and, finally, later, around 1975, for [[Amsterdam]], together with Tochmeyer, returning in 1991. Reportedly, while abroad, they both became addicted to [[cocaine]] and [[heroin]], while, [[squatting]] in abject poverty, forcing him to work in [[pornography]], and, Tochmeyer, to work as a stripper, while, essentially, living in a sort of [[open relationship]], together with artist {{ill|Buki Greenberg|he|בוקי גרינברג}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderman|first=Nirit|date=30 December 2011|script-title=he:מקרה איש: עשר שנים למותו של ז'אק קתמור|trans-title=A Man's Case: A Decade Since Jacques Katmor's Death|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/1.1604723|language=Hebrew|work=[[Haaretz]]|location=Tel Aviv|access-date=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Barry|date=13 January 2012|title=Keeping an Eye Open|url=http://www.jpost.com/Arts-and-Culture/Music/Keeping-an-eye-open|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|location=Jerusalem|access-date=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sangbleumagazine.com/2014/03/24/jacques-katmor/|title=Jacques Katmor|last=Sharpe|first=Zoe|website=[[Sang Bleu]]|date=24 March 2014|access-date=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/features/reopening-third-eye|title=Reopening the Third Eye|last=Sélavy|first=Virginie|last2=Shani|first2=Tal|date=24 November 2016|website=''[[British Film Institute]]''|access-date=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grossman|first=Hagit|date=22 March 2012|script-title=he:הוזה אל האינסוף|trans-title=Hallucinating Infinitely|url=https://musaf-shabbat.com/2012/03/22/%D7%94%D7%95%D7%96%D7%94-%D7%90%D7%9C-%D7%94%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A3-%D7%97%D7%92%D7%99%D7%AA-%D7%92%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%9E%D7%9F/|language=Hebrew|work=[[Makor Rishon]]|location=Jerusalem|access-date=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, the cause of his death was listed as [[alcoholism]]-related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Frosh|first=Tahel|date=17 August 2009|script-title=he:ז׳אק קתמור, מקרה גבר|trans-title=Jacques Katmor, a Man's Case|url=http://www.mouse.co.il/gallery/1.3338888|language=Hebrew|work=[[Ha'ir]]|location=Tel Aviv|access-date=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MUMPS''' (''Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System''), or '''M''', is a general-purpose computer [[programming language]] originally designed in 1966 for the healthcare industry. Its differentiating feature is its "built-in" database, enabling high-level access to disk storage using simple symbolic program [[variable (computer science)|variables]] and subscripted [[Array data structure|arrays]]; similar to the variables used by most languages to access main memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/george.james/mumps-the-internet-scale-database-presentation|title=Mumps the Internet scale database|first=|last=george.james|date=22 August 2008|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It continues to be used today by many large hospitals and banks to provide high-throughput transaction data processing.

== History ==
{{For |context |Timeline of programming languages}}

===Genesis===
MUMPS was developed by [[Neil Pappalardo]], Robert Greenes, and Curt Marble in Dr. Octo Barnett's animal lab at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] (MGH) in [[Boston]] during 1966 and 1967.

The original MUMPS system was, like [[Unix]] a few years later, built on a spare [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-7]]. Octo Barnett and Neil Pappalardo were also involved with MGH's planning for a Hospital Information System, obtained a [[backward compatible]] [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP-9]], and began using MUMPS in the admissions cycle and laboratory test reporting. MUMPS was then an [[interpreted language]], yet even then, incorporated a [[hierarchical database]] file system to standardize interaction with the data.

Some aspects of MUMPS can be traced from [[Rand Corporation]]'s [[JOSS]] through [[BBN Technologies|BBN]]'s [[TELCOMP]] and [[STRINGCOMP]]. The MUMPS team deliberately chose to include portability between machines as a design goal. Another feature, not widely supported for machines of the era, in [[operating system]]s or in [[computer hardware]], was [[computer multitasking|multitasking]], which was also built into the language itself.{{Citation needed|reason=What sort of multitasking are we talking about? Timesharing was already spreading rapidly by the time MUMPS was being created|date=April 2014}}

The portability was soon useful, as MUMPS was shortly adapted to a DEC [[PDP-15]], where it lived for some time. MUMPS was developed with the support of a government research grant, and so MUMPS was released to the public domain (no longer a requirement for grants), and was soon ported to a number of other systems including the popular DEC [[PDP-8]], the [[Data General Nova]] and the DEC [[PDP-11]] and the [[Artronix]] [[PC12 minicomputer]]. Word about MUMPS spread mostly through the medical community, and by the early 1970s was in widespread use, often being locally modified for their own needs.

===1970s===
By the early 1970s, there were many and varied implementations of MUMPS on a range of hardware platforms. The most widespread was DEC's MUMPS-11 on the PDP-11, and [[MEDITECH]]'s [[MIIS (programming language)|MIIS]].  In 1972, many MUMPS users attended a conference which standardized the then-fractured language, and created the '''MUMPS Users Group''' and '''MUMPS Development Committee''' (MDC) to do so. These efforts proved successful; a standard was complete by 1974, and was approved, on September 15, 1977, as [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] standard, X11.1-1977.  At about the same time DEC launched DSM-11 (Digital Standard MUMPS) for the PDP-11.  This quickly dominated the market, and became the reference implementation of the time. Also, [[InterSystems]] sold ISM-11 for the PDP-11 (which was identical to DSM-11).

===1980s===
During the early 1980s several vendors brought MUMPS-based platforms that met the ANSI standard to market. The most significant were:
* Digital Equipment Corporation with '''DSM''' (Digital Standard MUMPS). DSM-11 was superseded by '''VAX/DSM''' for the VAX/VMS platform, and that was ported to the [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] in two variants: '''DSM for OpenVMS''', and as '''DSM for Ultrix'''.
* [[InterSystems]] with '''ISM''' (InterSystems M) on VMS (M/VX), M/11+ on the PDP-11 platform, M/PC on MS-DOS, M/DG on [[Data General]], M/VM on IBM VM/CMS, and M/UX on various Unixes.

Other companies developed important MUMPS implementations:
* Greystone Technology Corporation with a compiled version called [[GT.M]].
* DataTree Inc. with an Intel PC based product called '''DTM'''.
* Micronetics Design Corporation with a product line called '''MSM''' for UNIX and Intel PC platforms (later ported to IBM's VM [[operating system]], VAX-VMS platforms and Alpha-VMS platforms).
* Computer Consultants (later renamed MGlobal), a [[Houston]]-based company originally created '''CCSM''' on 6800, then 6809, and eventually a port to the 68000, which later became '''MacMUMPS''', a [[Classic Mac OS|Mac OS]] based product. They also worked on the '''MGM''' MUMPS implementation. MGlobal also ported their implementation to the DOS platform. MGlobal MUMPS was the first commercial MUMPS for the IBM PC and the only implementation for the classic Mac OS. 
* [[Tandem Computers]] developed an implementation for their fault-tolerant computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://h17007.www1.hp.com/docs/enterprise/servers/nonstop/SPML_20_January_2012_final.pdf

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This period also saw considerable MDC activity. The second revision of the ANSI standard for MUMPS (X11.1-1984) was approved on November 15, 1984.

===1990s===
* On November 11, 1990 the third revision of the ANSI standard (X11.1-1990) was approved.
* In 1992 the same standard was also adopted as [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard 11756-1992. Use of '''M''' as an alternative name for the language was approved around the same time.
* On December 8, 1995 the fourth revision of the standard ([[X11.1-1995]]) was approved by ANSI, and by [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] in 1999 as [http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=29268 ISO 11756:1999].  The MDC finalized a further revision to the standard in 1998 but this has not been presented to ANSI for approval.
* InterSystems' Open M for Windows/NT was released, as well as Open M for Alpha/OSF and Alpha/VMS (their first 64-bit implementations, for the 64-bit Alpha processor).
* In 1997 Unicode support was added in InterSystems’ Caché 3.0

===2000s===
* By 2000, the [[Middleware (distributed applications)|middleware]] vendor InterSystems had become the dominant player in the MUMPS market with the purchase of several other vendors. Initially they acquired DataTree Inc. in the early 1990s. And, on December 30, 1995, InterSystems acquired the DSM product line from DEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.mumps/msg/d4509328a7930487 |title=Google Discussiegroepen |publisher=Groups.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; InterSystems consolidated these products into a single product line, branding them, on several hardware platforms, as '''OpenM'''. In 1997, InterSystems launched a new product named [[Caché (software)|Caché]]. This was based on their ISM product, but with influences from the other implementations. Micronetics Design Corporation assets were also acquired by InterSystems on June 21, 1998. InterSystems remains the dominant MUMPS vendor, selling Caché to MUMPS developers who write applications for a variety of operating systems.
* Greystone Technology Corporation's GT.M implementation was sold to Sanchez Computer Associates (now part of [[Fidelity National Information Services|FIS]]) in the mid-1990s. On November 7, 2000 Sanchez made GT.M for Linux available under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] license&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanchez.com/news_2000/nr_001107.asp |title=Sanchez to Explore New Business Opportunities for Its Database Technology |publisher=Sanchez Computer Associates, Inc. |date=November 7, 2000 |accessdate=2013-08-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040428215120/http://www.sanchez.com/news_2000/nr_001107.asp |archivedate=28 April 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on October 28, 2005 GT.M for [[OpenVMS]] and [[Tru64 UNIX]] were also made available under the AGPL license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/fis-gtm/files/ |title=GT.M High end TP database engine - Browse Files at |publisher=Sourceforge.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; GT.M continues to be available on other [[UNIX]] platforms under a traditional license.
* During 2000, Ray Newman and others released MUMPS V1, an implementation of MUMPS (initially on FreeBSD) similar to DSM-11.  MUMPS V1 has since been ported to [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] (using cygwin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/mumps/files/ |title=MUMPS Database and Language - Browse Files at |publisher=Sourceforge.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially only for the x86 CPU, MUMPS V1 has now been ported to the Raspberry Pi.
* The newest implementation of MUMPS, released in April 2002, is an '''MSM''' derivative called '''M21''' from the Real Software Company of Rugby, [[UK]].
* There are also several open source implementations of MUMPS, including some research projects. The most notable of these is [http://www.cs.uni.edu/~okane Mumps/II], by Dr. Kevin O'Kane (Professor Emeritus, [[University of Northern Iowa]]) and students' project. Dr. O'Kane has also ported the interpreter to Mac OS X.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rychannel.com/mumps |title=Mumps/Mii |publisher=Rychannel.com |date=2012-11-08 |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* One of the original creators of the MUMPS language, Neil Pappalardo, early founded a company called [[MEDITECH]]. They extended and built on the MUMPS language, naming the new language MIIS (and later, another language named MAGIC). Unlike InterSystems, MEDITECH no longer sells middleware, so MIIS and MAGIC are now only used internally at MEDITECH.
* On 6 January 2005, and later again on 25 June 2010, ISO re-affirmed its MUMPS-related standards: [http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=29268&amp;ICS1=35&amp;ICS2=60&amp;ICS3=&amp;scopelist ISO/IEC 11756:1999, language standard], [http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=29269&amp;printable=true ISO/IEC 15851:1999, Open MUMPS Interconnect] and [http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?printable=true&amp;CSNUMBER=29270 ISO/IEC 15852:1999, MUMPS Windowing Application Programmers Interface].

==Current users of MUMPS applications==
The US Department of Veterans Affairs (formerly the Veterans Administration) was one of the earliest major adopters of the MUMPS language.  Their development work (and subsequent contributions to the free MUMPS application codebase) was an influence on many medical users worldwide. In 1995, the Veterans Affairs' patient Admission/Tracking/Discharge system, [[Decentralized Hospital Computer Program]] (DHCP) was the recipient of the Computerworld [[Smithsonian Award]] for best use of Information Technology in Medicine. In July 2006, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) / [[Veterans Health Administration]] (VHA) was the recipient of the Innovations in American Government Award presented by the Ash Institute of the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]] for its extension of DHCP into the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture ([[VistA]]). Nearly the entire VA hospital system in the United States, the [[Indian Health Service]], and major parts of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] [[CHCS]] hospital system use MUMPS databases for clinical data tracking. In 2015 the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] awarded a 10 year contract to [[Leidos]], [[Cerner]], and [[Accenture]] to replace [[CHCS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/dod-names-ehr-contract-winner|title=DoD awards Cerner, Leidos, Accenture EHR contract|date=29 July 2015|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) announced that it would replace [[VistA]] with [[Cerner]] by 2024 or 2025. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthexec.com/topics/health-it/cerner-ehr-implementation-va-take-%E2%80%9C7-8-years%E2%80%9D|title=Cerner EHR implementation at VA to take '7 to 8 years'|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; That contract did not affect the 2015 VHA contract for an online appointment scheduling from [[Epic Systems|Epic]], so the VHA will continue to use MUMPS. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ehrintelligence.com/news/epic-keeps-va-scheduling-contract-despite-cerner-decision|title=Epic Keeps VA Scheduling Contract Despite Cerner Decision|first=|last=EHRIntelligence|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other healthcare IT companies using MUMPS include [[Epic Systems|Epic]], [[MEDITECH]], [[GE Healthcare]] (formerly [[IDX Systems Corporation|IDX]] Systems and [[Centricity]]), AmeriPath (part of Quest Diagnostics), Care Centric, [[Allscripts]], [[Coventry Healthcare]], [[EMIS Health|EMIS]], and [[Sunquest Information Systems]] (formerly Misys Healthcare&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/sunquest-emerges-misys-shadow |title=SunQuest emerges from Misys' shadow |publisher=Healthcare IT News |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Many reference laboratories, such as DASA, [[Quest Diagnostics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/george.james/missioncritical-ajaxmaking-test-ordering-easier-and-faster-at-quest-diagnostics?type=powerpoint |title=Mission-critical Ajax: Making Test Ordering Easier and Faster at Qu |publisher=Slideshare.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dynacare, use MUMPS software written by or based on Antrim Corporation code. Antrim was purchased by Misys Healthcare (now [[Sunquest Information Systems]]) in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Sunquest+acquires+Antrim+Corp.-a018916869 |title=Sunquest acquires Antrim Corp. - Free Online Library |publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |date=1996-11-26 |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MUMPS is also widely used in financial applications. MUMPS gained an early following in the financial sector and is in use at many banks and credit unions. It is used by [[Ameritrade]], the largest online trading service in the US, with over 12 billion transactions per day, as well as by the [[Bank of England]] and [[Barclays Bank]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m21.uk.com/newtom.php|title=Welcome to M21 -- the database for the 21st Century|publisher=M21.uk.com|accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intersystems.com/industry/financial/intersystems-in-financial.html|title=Caché-based Financial Systems|publisher=Intersystems.com|accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idea.cz/company/references|title=IDEA Turn-Key banking and ERP applications|publisher=Idea.cz|accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005, the use of MUMPS has been either in the form of GT.M or InterSystems Caché. The latter is being aggressively marketed by InterSystems and has had success in penetrating new markets, such as telecommunications, in addition to existing markets. The European Space Agency announced on May 13, 2010 that it will use the [[InterSystems Caché]] database to support the [[Gaia mission]].  This mission aims to map the [[Milky Way]] with unprecedented precision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realwire.com/release_detail.asp?ReleaseID=18645|title=European Space Agency Chooses InterSystems Caché Database For Gaia Mission to Map Milky Way|publisher=Realwire.com|accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
MUMPS is a language intended for and designed to build database applications.  Secondary language features were included to help programmers make applications using minimal computing resources.  The original implementations were [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreted]], though modern implementations may be fully or partially [[Compiler|compiled]]. Individual "programs" run in memory [[Memory management (operating systems)#Partitioned allocation|"partitions"]].  Early MUMPS memory partitions were limited to 2048 bytes so aggressive abbreviation greatly aided multi-programming on severely resource limited hardware, because more than one MUMPS job could fit into the very small memories extant in hardware at the time. The ability to provide multi-user systems was another language design feature. The word "'''M'''ulti-'''P'''rogramming" in the acronym points to this. Even the earliest machines running MUMPS supported multiple jobs running at the same time. With the change from mini-computers to micro-computers a
few years later, even a "single user PC" with a single 8-bit CPU and 16K or 64K of memory could support multiple users, who could connect to it from (non-[[GUI|graphical]]) [[Computer terminal|video display terminals]].

Since memory was tight originally, the language design for MUMPS valued very terse code. Thus, every MUMPS command or function name could be abbreviated from one to three letters in length, e.g. Quit (exit program) as Q, $P = $Piece function, R = Read command, $TR = $Translate function. Spaces and end-of-line markers are significant in MUMPS because line scope promoted the same terse language design. Thus, a single line of program code could express, with few characters, an idea for which other programming languages could require 5 to 10 times as many characters.  Abbreviation was a common feature of languages designed in this period (e.g., [[FOCAL-69]], early BASICs such as [[Tiny BASIC]], etc.).  An unfortunate side effect of this, coupled with the early need to write minimalist code, was that MUMPS programmers routinely did not comment code and used extensive abbreviations.  This meant that even an expert MUMPS programmer could not just skim through a page of code to see its function but would have to
analyze it line by line.

Database interaction is transparently built into the language. The MUMPS language provides a [[hierarchical database model|hierarchical database]] made up of [[persistence (computer science)|persistent]] [[sparse array]]s, which is implicitly "opened" for every MUMPS application.  All variable names prefixed with the caret character ("^") use permanent (instead of RAM) storage, will maintain their values after the application exits, and will be visible to (and modifiable by) other running applications.  Variables using this shared and permanent storage are called ''Globals'' in MUMPS, because the scoping of these variables is "globally available" to all jobs on the system. The more recent and more common use of the name "global variables" in other languages is a more limited scoping of names, coming from the fact that [[Variable scoping|unscoped variables]] are "globally" available to any programs running in the same process, but not shared among multiple processes. The MUMPS Storage mode (i.e. Globals
stored as persistent sparse arrays), gives the MUMPS database the characteristics of a [[document-oriented database]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gradvs1.mgateway.com/download/extreme1.pdf|title=Extreme Database programming with MUMPS Globals|publisher=Gradvs1.mjgateway.com|accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All variable names which are not prefixed with caret character ("^") are temporary and private. Like global variables, they also have a hierarchical storage model, but are only "locally available" to a single job, thus they are called "locals".  Both "globals" and "locals" can have child nodes (called ''subscripts'' in MUMPS terminology).  Subscripts are not limited to numerals—any [[ASCII]] character or group of characters can be a subscript identifier. While this is not uncommon for modern languages such as Perl or JavaScript, it was a highly unusual feature in the late 1970s. This capability was not universally implemented in MUMPS systems before the 1984 ANSI standard, as only canonically numeric subscripts were required by the standard to be allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://71.174.62.16/Demo/AnnoStd?Frame=Main&amp;Page=a202005&amp;Edition=1977 |title=The Annotated M[UMPS&amp;#93; Standards |publisher=71.174.62.16 |date=2011-11-29 |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the variable named 'Car' can have
subscripts "Door", "Steering Wheel" and "Engine", each of which can contain a value and have subscripts of their own.  The variable ^Car("Door") could have a nested variable subscript of "Color" for example. Thus, you could say

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
SET ^Car("Door","Color")="BLUE"
&lt;/source&gt;

to modify a nested child node of ^Car.  In MUMPS terms, "Color" is the 2nd subscript of the variable ^Car (both the names of the child-nodes and the child-nodes themselves are likewise called subscripts).  Hierarchical variables are similar to objects with properties in many [[Object-oriented programming|object oriented]] languages.  Additionally, the MUMPS language design requires that all subscripts of variables are automatically kept in sorted order.  Numeric subscripts (including floating-point numbers) are stored from lowest to highest.  All non-numeric subscripts are stored in alphabetical order following the numbers.  In MUMPS terminology, this is ''canonical order''.  By using only non-negative integer subscripts, the MUMPS programmer can emulate the [[Array data type|arrays]] data type from other languages.  Although MUMPS does not natively offer a full set of [[Database Management System|DBMS]] features such as mandatory schemas, several DBMS systems have been built on top of it that provide
application developers with flat-file, relational and network database features.

Additionally, there are built-in operators which treat a delimited string (e.g., [[comma-separated values]]) as an array. Early MUMPS programmers would often store a structure of related information as a delimited string, parsing it after it was read in; this saved disk access time and offered considerable speed advantages on some hardware.

MUMPS has no data types. Numbers can be treated as strings of digits, or strings can be treated as numbers by numeric operators (''coerced'', in MUMPS terminology). Coercion can have some odd side effects, however. For example, when a string is coerced, the parser turns as much of the string (starting from the left) into a number as it can, then discards the rest.  Thus the statement &lt;code&gt;IF 20&lt;"30 DUCKS"&lt;/code&gt; is evaluated as &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; in MUMPS.

Other features of the language are intended to help MUMPS applications interact with each other in a multi-user environment. Database locks, process identifiers, and [[atomicity (database systems)|atomicity]] of database update transactions are all required of standard MUMPS implementations.

In contrast to languages in the C or [[Niklaus Wirth#Programming languages|Wirth]] traditions, some space characters between MUMPS statements are significant. A single space separates a command from its argument, and a space, or newline, separates each argument from the next MUMPS token. Commands which take no arguments (e.g., &lt;code&gt;ELSE&lt;/code&gt;) require two following spaces. The concept is that one space separates the command from the (nonexistent) argument, the next separates the "argument" from the next command. Newlines are also significant; an &lt;code&gt;IF&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ELSE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;FOR&lt;/code&gt; command processes (or skips) everything else till the end-of-line. To make those statements control multiple lines, you must use the &lt;code&gt;DO&lt;/code&gt; command to create a code block.

=="Hello, World!" example==

A simple [[Hello world program]] in MUMPS might be:
	
&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
hello()
  write "Hello, World!",!
  quit
&lt;/source&gt;

and would be run from the MUMPS command line with the command &lt;code&gt;do ^hello&lt;/code&gt;. Since MUMPS allows commands to be strung together on the same line, and since commands can be abbreviated to a single letter, this routine could be made more compact:

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
hello() w "Hello, World!",! q
&lt;/source&gt;

The '&lt;code&gt;,!&lt;/code&gt;' after the text generates a newline.

==Summary of key language features==
{{Main|MUMPS syntax}}
ANSI X11.1-1995 gives a complete, formal description of the language; an annotated version of this standard is available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://71.174.62.16/Demo/AnnoStd|title=The Annotated M[UMPS] Standards|website=71.174.62.16|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Data types''': There is one universal [[datatype]], which is implicitly [[Type conversion|coerced]] to string, integer, or floating-point datatypes as context requires.

'''Booleans''' (called ''truthvalues'' in MUMPS): In IF commands and other syntax that has expressions evaluated as conditions, any string value is evaluated as a numeric value, and if that is a nonzero value, then it is interpreted as True.  &lt;code&gt; a&amp;lt;b &lt;/code&gt; yields 1 if a is less than b, 0 otherwise.

'''Declarations''': None. All variables are dynamically created at the first time a value is assigned.

'''Lines''': are important syntactic entities, unlike their status in languages patterned on C or Pascal. Multiple statements per line are allowed and are common. The scope of any IF, ELSE, and FOR command is "the remainder of current line."

'''Case sensitivity''': Commands and intrinsic functions are case-insensitive. In contrast, variable names and labels are case-sensitive.  There is no special meaning for upper vs. lower-case and few widely followed conventions. The percent sign (%) is legal as first character of variables and labels.

'''Postconditionals''': execution of almost any command can be controlled by following it with a colon and a truthvalue expression. &lt;code&gt;SET:N&lt;10 A="FOO"&lt;/code&gt;  sets A to "FOO" if N is less than 10; &lt;code&gt;DO:N&gt;100 PRINTERR,&lt;/code&gt; performs PRINTERR if N is greater than 100. This construct provides a conditional whose scope is less than a full line.

'''Abbreviation''': You can abbreviate nearly all commands and native functions to one, two, or three characters.

'''Reserved words''': None.  Since MUMPS interprets source code by context, there is no need for reserved words. You may use the names of language commands as variables. There has been no contest such as the [[International Obfuscated C Code Contest]] for MUMPS, despite the potential of examples such as the following, perfectly legal, MUMPS code:

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
GREPTHIS()
       NEW SET,NEW,THEN,IF,KILL,QUIT SET IF="KILL",SET="11",KILL="l1",QUIT="RETURN",THEN="KILL"
       IF IF=THEN DO THEN
       QUIT:$QUIT QUIT QUIT ; (quit)
THEN  IF IF,SET&amp;KILL SET SET=SET+KILL QUIT
&lt;/source&gt;

MUMPS can be made more obfuscated by using the contracted operator syntax, as shown in this terse example derived from the example above:

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
GREPTHIS()
       N S,N,T,I,K,Q S I="K",S="11",K="l1",Q="R",T="K"
       I I=T D T
       Q:$Q Q Q
T  I I,S&amp;K S S=S+K Q
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Arrays''': are created dynamically, stored as [[B-trees]], are sparse (i.e. use almost no space for missing nodes), can use any number of subscripts, and subscripts can be strings or numeric (including floating point). Arrays are always automatically stored in sorted order, so there is never any occasion to sort, pack, reorder, or otherwise reorganize the database. Built in functions such as $DATA, $ORDER, $NEXT(deprecated) and $QUERY functions provide efficient examination and traversal of the fundamental array structure, on disk or in memory.

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
for i=10000:1:12345 set sqtable(i)=i*i
set address("Smith","Daniel")="dpbsmith@world.std.com"
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Local arrays''': variable names not beginning with caret (i.e. "^") are stored in memory by process, are private to the creating process, and expire when the creating process terminates. The available storage depends on implementation. For those implementations using partitions, it is limited to the partition size, (A small partition might be 32K). For other implementations, it may be several megabytes.

'''Global arrays''': &lt;code&gt;^abc, ^def&lt;/code&gt;. These are stored on disk, are available to all processes, and are persistent when the creating process terminates. Very large globals (for example, hundreds of gigabytes) are practical and efficient in most implementations. This is MUMPS' main "database" mechanism. It is used instead of calling on the operating system to create, write, and read files.

'''Indirection''': in many contexts, &lt;code&gt;@VBL&lt;/code&gt; can be used, and effectively substitutes the contents of VBL into another MUMPS statement. &lt;code&gt;SET XYZ="ABC" SET @XYZ=123&lt;/code&gt; sets the variable ABC to 123. &lt;code&gt;SET SUBROU="REPORT" DO @SUBROU&lt;/code&gt; performs the subroutine named REPORT. This substitution allows for [[lazy evaluation]] and late binding as well as effectively the operational equivalent of "pointers" in other languages.

'''Piece function''': This breaks variables into segmented pieces guided by a user specified separator string (sometimes called a "delimiter"). Those who know [[awk]] will find this familiar. &lt;code&gt;$PIECE(STRINGVAR,"^",3)&lt;/code&gt; means the "third caret-separated piece of STRINGVAR." The piece function can also appear as an assignment (SET command) target.

&lt;code&gt;$PIECE("world.std.com",".",2)&lt;/code&gt; yields "std".

After
&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
SET X="dpbsmith@world.std.com"
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;SET $P(X,"@",1)="office"&lt;/code&gt; causes X to become "office@world.std.com" (note that $P is equivalent to $PIECE and could be written as such).

'''Order function''': This function treats its input as a structure, and finds the next index that exists which has the same structure except for the last subscript. It returns the sorted value that is ordered after the one given as input. (This treats the array reference as a content-addressable data rather than an address of a value)

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
Set stuff(6)="xyz",stuff(10)=26,stuff(15)=""
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;$Order(stuff(""))&lt;/code&gt; yields 6, &lt;code&gt;$Order(stuff(6))&lt;/code&gt; yields 10, &lt;code&gt;$Order(stuff(8))&lt;/code&gt; yields 10, &lt;code&gt;$Order(stuff(10))&lt;/code&gt; yields 15, &lt;code&gt;$Order(stuff(15))&lt;/code&gt; yields "".

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
Set i="" For  Set i=$O(stuff(i)) Quit:i=""  Write !,i,10,stuff(i)
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, the argument-less ''For'' repeats until stopped by a terminating ''Quit''.  This line prints a table of i and stuff(i) where i is successively 6, 10, and 15.

For iterating the database, the Order function returns the next key to use.

&lt;source lang="text"&gt;
GTM&gt;S n=""
GTM&gt;S n=$order(^nodex(n))
GTM&gt;zwr n
n=" building"
GTM&gt;S n=$order(^nodex(n))
GTM&gt;zwr n
n=" name:gd"
GTM&gt;S n=$order(^nodex(n))
GTM&gt;zwr n
n="%kml:guid"
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Multi-User/Multi-Tasking/Multi-Processor''': MUMPS supports multiple simultaneous users and processes even when the underlying operating system does not (e.g., MS-DOS).  Additionally, there is the ability to specify an environment for a variable, such as by specifying a machine name in a variable (as in &lt;code&gt;SET ^|"DENVER"|A(1000)="Foo"&lt;/code&gt;), which can allow you to access data on remote machines.

==Criticism==
Some aspects of MUMPS syntax differ strongly from that of more modern languages, which can cause confusion. Whitespace is not allowed within expressions, as it ends a statement: &lt;code&gt;2 + 3&lt;/code&gt; is an error, and must be written &lt;code&gt;2+3&lt;/code&gt;. All operators have the same precedence and are [[Operator associativity|left-associative]] (&lt;code&gt;2+3*10&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to 50). The operators for "less than or equal to" and "greater than or equal to" are &lt;code&gt;'&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;'&lt;&lt;/code&gt; (that is, the boolean negation operator &lt;code&gt;'&lt;/code&gt; plus a strict comparison operator).

MUMPS lacks a while statement; a GOTO statement can be used to simulate one. By default, the IF, ELSE, and FOR statements use the rest of the line as their block. The DO statement allows one of them to span multiple lines; periods (&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;) are used to indent the lines in a DO block. The ELSE statement does not need a corresponding IF, as it operates by inspecting the value in the builtin system variable &lt;code&gt;$test&lt;/code&gt;.

MUMPS [[Scope (computer science)|scoping]] rules are more permissive than other modern languages. Declared local variables are scoped using the stack. A routine can normally see all declared locals of the routines below it on the call stack, and routines cannot prevent routines they call from modifying their declared locals. By contrast, undeclared variables (variables created by using them, rather than declaration) are in scope for all routines running in the same process, and remain in scope until the program exits.

=="MUMPS" vs. "M" naming debate==
{{Cite-section|date=October 2018}}
All of the following positions can be, and have been, supported by knowledgeable people at various times:
*The language's name became M in 1993 when the M Technology Association adopted it.
*The name became M on December 8, 1995, with the approval of ANSI X11.1-1995
*Both M ''and'' MUMPS are officially accepted names.
*M is only an "alternative name" or "nickname" for the language, and MUMPS is still the official name.

Some of the contention arose in response to strong M advocacy on the part of one commercial interest, InterSystems, whose chief executive disliked the name MUMPS and felt that it represented a serious marketing obstacle. Thus, favoring M to some extent became identified as alignment with InterSystems. The dispute also reflected rivalry between organizations (the M Technology Association, the MUMPS Development Committee, the ANSI and ISO Standards Committees) as to who determines the "official" name of the language. Some writers have attempted to defuse the issue by referring to the language as ''M[UMPS]'', square brackets being the customary notation for optional syntax elements. A leading authority, and the author of an open source MUMPS implementation, Professor Kevin O'Kane, uses only 'MUMPS'.

The most recent standard (ISO/IEC 11756:1999, re-affirmed on 25 June 2010), still mentions both M and MUMPS as officially accepted names.

=== Trademark status ===
[[Massachusetts General Hospital]] registered "MUMPS" as a trademark with the USPTO on November 28, 1971, and renewed it on November 16, 1992 - but let it expired on August 30, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=72382020&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=statusSearch|title=Trademark Status &amp; Document Retrieval|website=tsdr.uspto.gov|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to Pick==
MUMPS invites comparison with the [[Pick operating system]].&lt;ref&gt;A 1980's "shootout" had Pick "still going after 30" minutes whereas MUMPS had 
finished sort 100,000 "in less than a minute."{{cite web
|url=http://www.mail-archive.com/hardhats-members@lists.sourceforge.net/msg04639.html |title=BIG NEWS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities include:

* Both systems are built on the efficient implementation of large, sparse, string-indexed arrays;
* Both historically commingled the language and the OS;
* Both have a similar domain of applicability.

The '''Medical University of Vienna''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Medizinische Universität Wien'') is a public [[university]] located in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. It is the direct successor to the [[faculty of medicine]] at the [[University of Vienna]], founded in 1365 by [[Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria]]. As one of the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|oldest medical schools in the world]], it is the oldest in the German-speaking countries, and was the second medical faculty in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], after the [[Charles University of Prague]].

The Medical University of Vienna is the largest medical organisation in Austria, as well as one of the top-level research institutions in [[Europe]] and provides Europe's largest hospital, the [[Vienna General Hospital]], with all of its medical staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.meduniwien.ac.at/homepage/1/content/general-information/medical-university-of-vienna-research-institution-of-international-acclaim/largest-and-longest-standing-medical-research-institution-in-austria/ |title=Largest and longest-standing medical research institution in Austria |publisher=Medical University of Vienna |date= |accessdate=2014-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It consists of 31 university clinics and clinical institutes, and 12 medical-theoretical departments, which perform around 48,000 [[Surgery|operations]] each year. The Vienna General Hospital has about 100,000 [[patients]] treated as inpatients and 605,000 treated as outpatients each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.meduniwien.ac.at/homepage/1/content/general-information/facts-figures/ |title=Facts &amp; Figures |publisher=Medical University of Vienna |date= |accessdate=2014-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been seven [[Nobel prize]] laureates affiliated with the medical faculty, and fifteen in total with the University of Vienna. These include [[Robert Bárány]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1914/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1914 – Robert Bárány |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Wagner-Jauregg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1927/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1927 – Julius Wagner-Jauregg |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Karl Landsteiner]], the discoverer of the ABO [[blood type]] system and the [[Rhesus factor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1930/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1930 – Karl Landsteiner |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author= Landsteiner K|title = Zur Kenntnis der antifermentativen, lytischen und agglutinierenden Wirkungen des Blutserums und der Lymphe|journal=Zentralblatt Bakteriologie|year = 1900|volume=27|pages = 357–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]] qualified as a doctor at the medical faculty and worked as a doctor and lecturer at the General Hospital,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fifty Key Thinkers in Psychology|author = Noel Sheehy, Alexandra Forsythe|chapter = Sigmund Freud| publisher=Routledge |year = 2013| isbn= 1134704933}}&lt;/ref&gt; carrying out research into cerebral palsy, aphasia and microscopic neuroanatomy.&lt;ref&gt;Eric R. Kandel  ''The Age of Insight: The Quest to Understand the Unconscious in Art, Mind and Brain, from Vienna 1900 to the Present''. New York: Random House 2012, pp. 45-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2014–15 Times Higher Education Rankings, the Medical University of Vienna is listed among the top 15 medical schools in [[Europe]] and  49th in the world. (Clinical, Pre-Clinical and Health).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2014-15/subject-ranking/subject/clinical-pre-clinical-health |title=Top 100 universities for Clinical, pre-clinical and health 2014-15 |publisher=Times Higher Education |date= |accessdate=2014-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, there were 6,093 applicants for 660 places in medicine proper and 80 in dentistry, which corresponds to an admission rate of about 12.14%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meduniwien.ac.at/homepage/news-und-topstories/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=6725&amp;cHash=c556b659fd35a50c2af5f1cf77d650f3|title=Gemeinsame Aufnahmetests zum Medizinstudium in Österreich: Insgesamt 12.160 InteressentInnen nahmen teil|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Medical University of Vienna|access-date=July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admission is based upon ranking in an admission test called "MedAT", which is carried out every summer in conjunction with the three other public medical schools of Austria: the [[Medical University of Graz]], the [[Medical University of Innsbruck]] and the Medical Faculty at the [[Johannes Kepler University Linz]].

==History==

===Founding===

[[File:Muw herbst.jpg|thumb|right|Department of studies, Medical University of Vienna.]]

[[File:AKH Wien MedUniWien.JPG|thumb|View of Vienna, Austria at dusk from the roof of the Vienna General Hospital (AKH Wien).]]

====From the middle ages to the [[Age of Enlightenment]]====
As the founding member of the ''Alma mater Rudolfina'' ([[University of Vienna]]) founded in 1365, the medical faculty was already widely renowned in [[medieval]] times as an authority in medicine. Faculty records from as far back as 1399 document its mediation in disputes between barber surgeons, midwives, and local landowners. During the reign of [[Maria Theresia]], Viennese medicine first attained international significance. The Habsburg Monarch summoned the Dutch physician, [[Gerard van Swieten]], to Vienna. He in turn laid the foundation for the Vienna Medical School and paved the way for other leading figures. [[Anton de Haen]], [[Maximilian Stoll]], [[Lorenz Gasser]], [[Anton von Störck]], and the discoverer of the [[percussion]] technique, [[Leopold Auenbrugger]], all taught and conducted research in the imperial city. Based on longstanding traditions, what now is referred to as "bedside teaching" also became the paradigmatic educational method during this period.

When the Vienna General Hospital opened in 1784, physicians acquired a new facility that gradually developed into the most important research center. During the 19th century, the "Second Viennese Medical School" emerged with the contributions of physicians such as [[Karl Rokitansky]], [[Josef Skoda]], [[Ferdinand von Hebra]] and [[Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis]]. Basic medical science expanded and specialization advanced. Furthermore, the first [[dermatology]], [[eye]], as well as [[otolaryngology]] clinics in the world were founded in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.meduniwien.ac.at/homepage/1/content/general-information/history-of-the-medical-university-of-vienna/glorious-peaks-and-painful-depths-viennese-medicine/ |title=History of the Medical University of Vienna |publisher=Medical University of Vienna |date= |accessdate=2014-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wien-Alsergrund,-Spitalgasse-4,-Pathologisch-Anatomisches-Institut-(1898).jpg|thumb|right|The Pathological–Anatomical Institute in 1898.]]

====At the height of the [[Austro–Hungarian Empire]]====
At the beginning of the 20th century, Viennese Medicine belonged to the first class internationally. [[Clemens von Pirquet]] defined the concepts of "allergy" and "serum sickness," [[Ernst Peter Pick]] conducted significant experiments on the chemical specificity of immunological reactions, and the Vienna School of Dentistry (founded by [[Bernhard Gotlieb]]) reached its zenith in the 1920s. All four Nobel Prizes, which were granted to (former) Viennese physicians during the next decades [[Robert Bárány]] (1914), [[Julius Wagner-Jauregg]] (1927), [[Karl Landsteiner]] (1930), and [[Otto Loewi]] (1936)], were the result of work undertaken at this time. The excellent tradition and research extended well into the [[First Austrian Republic]]. Under the auspices of the Medical Association of Vienna, which was founded in Vienna, well-received postgraduate courses for doctors worldwide were organized into the 1930s.

====During the Second World War====
With the annexation of Austria by [[National Socialist Germany]] on 13 March 1938 the darkest phase in Viennese medicine began. More than half of the University medical instructors, mostly those of [[Jewish]] descent, and 65% of Viennese physicians were dismissed. Many renowned researchers, physicians, and students were forced to [[emigrate]] or died in [[concentration camps]] and under other tragic circumstances.

====After the Second World War====

In the aftermath of [[World War II]] difficult years lay ahead of the University. The past glory had faded considerably. Moreover, 75% of all university medical instructors had to be dismissed because of their moderate to heavy involvement with the National Socialist regime. They were gradually replaced by a newly trained generation of educators. This double rupture in Viennese Medicine, which occurred in just a few years, caused repercussions that lasted for long after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.meduniwien.ac.at/homepage/1/content/general-information/history-of-the-medical-university-of-vienna/glorious-peaks-and-painful-depths-viennese-medicine/ |title=History of the Medical University of Vienna |publisher=Medical University of Vienna |date= |accessdate=2014-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====From the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Vienna to the Medical University of Vienna====

[[File:University Vienna Oct. 2006 002.jpg|thumb|right|The Medical University of Vienna was the University of Vienna's faculty of medicine during 639 years before becoming a wholly independent university.]]

After the independence of the medical faculty as an independent institution the newly founded pure medical university could reposition itself in international research and regain international recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2013-14/subject-ranking/subject/clinical-pre-clinical-health |title=Top 100 universities for Clinical, pre-clinical and health 2013-14 |publisher=Times Higher Education |date= |accessdate=2014-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the fields of [[bionic reconstruction]], some notable results could be achieved. A [[United Kingdom|British]] soldier who lost his arm during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan war]] received a bionic reconstruction at the department of surgery of the [[Vienna General Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-tyne-25320455 |title=Soldier Andrew Garthwaite moves bionic arm by thoughts |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2014-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.meduniwien.ac.at/homepage/fileadmin/HP-Relaunch/pdforganisation/oeffentlichkeitsarbeit/presse/PA_Bionik_CD-Labor.pdf |title=MedUni Wien und AKH Wien bauen internationale Top-Position für die Versorgung mit bionischen Hi-Tech-Prothesen aus  |publisher=Department of surgery, Medical University of Vienna |date= |accessdate=2014-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, the Vienna General Hospital and Medical University of Vienna are the largest centre for lung transplantation in Europe and the second-largest lung transplantation centre worldwide after the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. Up until 2009, over 1,000 lung transplants had been performed and currently about 100 transplantations are carried out per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ehltf.info/joomla/index.php/en/news/archives/373-4d87705002e01 |title=20 Years of Lung Transplantation in Austria |publisher=European Heart and Lung Transplant Federation |date= |accessdate=2014-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502131608/http://www.ehltf.info/joomla/index.php/en/news/archives/373-4d87705002e01 |archivedate=2014-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Medical University of Vienna is the reference center of [[Siemens]] for the seven [[Tesla (unit)|Tesla]] [[magnetic resonance imaging]] scanner "MAGNETOM 7T". Founded in 2003, the High Field MR Centre (HFMR) acts today as a core research facility for the Medical University of Vienna. It combines basic research and development of methods with a strong focus on applications in neuroscience, musculoskeletal research, oncology and metabolism. The declared goal is to validate the potential of ultra-high field (UHF) MRI in clinical applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthcare.siemens.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging/reference-center/medical-university-vienna |title=Medical University of Vienna MAGNETOM 7T Siemens International Reference Center   |publisher=Siemens Healthcare |date= |accessdate=2014-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==
Currently, there are five eligible programmes:

* [[Medicine]]
* [[Dentistry]]

Medicine and dentistry both are of a duration of six years and require higher education entrance qualification. In [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]] this would correspond to a [[Matura]], in [[Germany]] the [[Abitur]] or similar qualifications from other [[European Union|EU]] countries.
Language of instruction is [[German language|German]], but usually students are expected to be able to be fluent in [[English language|English]]. A diploma thesis is required to graduate and can be written in German or English.

The courses of study lead to the degree of "Dr. med. univ." for medical doctors and "Dr. med. dent." for dentists, which correspond to [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] in the [[United States]] or MBBS or MBChB in the [[United Kingdom]].
Graduates have the right to move freely within the [[European Union]] and to start a specialty training.

* Medical informatics

Medical informatics is a master's degree and requires a bachelor's degree ([[Bologna Process]]) for application.

* Programme of Applied medical science
* PhD

Applied medical science and PhD both are postdoc programmes i.e. require a medical degree or similar.
For students of the university, possibility is given to start the PhD-programme during the medical programme.

== Museum ==

[[File:Josephinum P2.JPG|thumb|right|The early-classicistic Josephinum was built in 1785 under [[Joseph II of Austria]]. It now houses the museum for anatomical wax models and, along with the Florentine Library, is among the largest in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.meduniwien.ac.at/homepage/1/content/general-information/medical-university-of-vienna-research-institution-of-international-acclaim/cultural-heritage-the-worlds-largest-collection-of-medical-history/ |title=Cultural heritage |publisher=Medical University of Vienna |date= |accessdate=2014-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Museum of the Medical University is mainly housed in the "Josephinum", designed and built in 1783-1785 to house the medical-surgical academy.
The building includes a six-room collection of 1,192 wax anatomical and obstrectical models made in Florence by [[Clemente Susini]] under the supervision of [[Paolo Mascagni]] between 1784 and 1788.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv |url=http://www.wien.info/en/sightseeing/sights/from-g-to-k/museum-medical-university |title=Museum of the Medical University |publisher=WienTourismus |accessdate=2013-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Multiple Myeloma Research Consortium logo.jpg|right|140px]]

The mission of the '''Multiple Myeloma Research Consortium''' (MMRC) is to champion collaboration with and integration across academia and industry and to focus on speed and innovation to bring the most promising [[multiple myeloma]] treatments to patients faster. It was founded by [[Kathy Giusti]], a myeloma patient and founder and chief executive officer of the [[Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation]] (MMRF).

==MMRC model==
The MMRC comprises 14 member institutions nationwide that form its [[clinical trials]] network. It is led by an executive committee in [[Norwalk, Connecticut]], and a steering committee and progress review committee composed of researchers from MMRC Member Institutions. The MMRC also includes a shared tissue bank of annotated tissue and peripheral blood samples from multiple myeloma patients.

==MMRC member institutions==
The MMRC currently comprises fourteen world-renowned academic institutions: [[Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]], [[H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center &amp; Research Institute]], [[Mayo Clinic]], [[City of Hope National Medical Center]], [[Emory University]], [[Indiana University]], [[Hackensack University Medical Center]], [[Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center]], [[Saint Vincent Catholic Medical Center]], [[University Health Network]] ([[Princess Margaret Cancer Centre]]), [[University of California, San Francisco Medical Center]], [[University of Chicago]], [[University of Michigan]], and the [[Alvin J. Siteman Cancer Center]] at [[Barnes-Jewish Hospital]] and [[Washington University School of Medicine]].

==MMRC Tissue Bank==
The MMRC Tissue Bank serves as a “bridge” between laboratory and clinical research conducted by the MMRC and is a resource to advance the MMRC Multiple Myeloma Genomics Initiative.

==MMRC clinical trials==
The MMRC is focused on advancing Phase I and Phase II clinical trials of novel compounds and combination approaches. To date, the MMRC has opened through its clinical trials network 22 clinical trials with industry partners – including [[Novartis]], [[Celgene]], [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]], and [[Proteolix]]. MMRC clinical trials are also designed to include correlative studies to better understand what drugs are most effective in treating various sub-groups of patients with myeloma, laying the foundation for the development of [[personalized medicine]].

==MMRC Multiple Myeloma Genomics Initiative==
The MMRC Multiple Myeloma Genomics Initiative comprehensive genomic analysis program. It was designed to rapidly accelerate progress made against multiple myeloma by significantly improving the understanding of the biology of the disease. It is spearheaded by the MMRC and in collaboration with the [[Broad Institute]] and the [[Translational Genomics Research Institute]] (TGen).

The '''NIA rhesus macaque calorie restriction study''' was a study started in 1987 by the [[National Institute of Aging]]. It  showed that [[calorie restriction]] did not extend years of life or reduce age-related deaths in [[Rhesus macaque|rhesus monkeys]].&lt;ref name="MyUser_Https:_May_17_2016c"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-study-finds-calorie-restriction-does-not-affect-survival |title=NIH study finds calorie restriction does not affect survival |newspaper= |date=  |author= |accessdate= May 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It did improve certain measures of health, however.&lt;ref name="MyUser_The_New_York_Times_May_17_2016c"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/02/science/a-new-salvo-in-debate-over-caloric-restrictions-and-longevity.html |title=Diet's Link to Longevity: After 2 Studies Diverge, a Search for Consensus |newspaper=The New York Times |date= April 1, 2014 |author= |accessdate= May 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Such as?}}

These results were publicized as being different from the Wisconsin rhesus macaque calorie restriction study, which also started in 1987 and showed an increase in the lifespan of rhesus macaques following calorie restriction.

'''Nurse education''' consists of the theoretical and practical training provided to [[nurse]]s with the purpose to prepare them for their duties as [[nursing care]] professionals.  This education is provided to nursing students by experienced nurses and other medical professionals who have qualified or experienced for educational tasks. Most countries offer nurse education courses that can be relevant to general nursing or to specialized areas including [[mental health]] nursing, [[pediatric]] nursing and post-operatory nursing. Courses leading to autonomous registration as a nurse typically last four years. Nurse education also provides post-qualification courses in specialist subjects within nursing.

==Historical background==
During past decades, the changes in education have replaced the more practically focused, but often ritualistic, training structure of conventional preparation. Nurse education integrates today a broader awareness of other disciplines allied to medicine, often involving inter-professional education, and the utilization of research when making clinical and managerial decisions. Orthodox training can be argued to have offered a more intense practical skills base, but emphasized the handmaiden relationship with the physician. This is now outmoded, and the impact of nurse education is to develop a confident, inquiring graduate who contributes to the care team as an equal. In some countries, not all qualification courses have graduate status.

Traditionally, from the times prior to [[Florence Nightingale]], nursing was seen as an [[apprenticeship]], often undertaken in [[religious institute]]s such as convents by young women, although there has always been a proportion of male nurses, especially in mental health services. In 1860 Nightingale set up the first nurse training school at [[St Thomas' Hospital]], [[London]]. Nightingale's [[curriculum]] was largely base around [[nursing practice]], with instruction focused upon the need for hygiene and task competence. Her methods are reflected in her ''[[Notes on Nursing]]'', (1898).

Some other nurses at that time, notably [[Ethel Gordon Fenwick]], were in favor of formalized nursing registration and curricula that were formally based in [[higher education]] and not within the confines of hospitals.

Nurse education in the United States is conducted within university schools, although it is unclear who offered the first degree level program. So far as known [[Yale School of Nursing]] became the first autonomous school of nursing in the United States in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nursing.yale.edu/about-ysn|title=About YSN|last=|first=|date=2015|website=|publisher=Yale School of Nursing|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1955, a [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) study group on the education of nurses met in Brussels and made several recommendations, including that "At least one experimental school of nursing be set up in each country."&lt;ref name="BMJ 14Jan1956"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Medical News. Education of nurses. |journal=British Medical Journal |date=14 January 1956 |volume=1 |pages=122 |doi=10.1136/bmj.1.4958.121}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, the first department of [[Nursing Studies University of Edinburgh|Nursing Studies]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]] was established in 1956, with a five-year integrated degree programme introduced in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edit.ed.ac.uk/articles/issue/3/history-makers-nursing-ambition/|title=History makers: nursing ambition {{!}} Edit|last=Hookson|website=edit.ed.ac.uk|access-date=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other universities across the UK during the 1960s. In 1974 La Trobe University commenced the very first nursing course in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latrobe.edu.au/courses/nursing|title=Nursing|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|publisher=La Trobe University|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nursing qualifications==
There are multiple entry levels into nursing.  This has led to confusion for the public, as well as other healthcare professionals.  The earliest schools of nursing offered a [[Diploma in Nursing]] and not an actual academic degree. [[Community colleges]] began offering an [[Associate of Science in Nursing]] degree, and some diploma programs switched to this model.  [[Universities]] then began to offer [[Bachelor of Science in Nursing]] and [[Bachelor of Nursing]] degrees, followed by [[Master of Science in Nursing]] degrees, and  [[Doctor of Nursing Practice]] degrees.

===Nursing degrees in the UK===
Pre-registration nurse training and education in the UK is now via a bachelor's degree (a UK Level 6 qualification)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/compare-different-qualification-levels|title=Compare different qualifications|last=|first=|date=2015|website=|publisher=GOV.UK.|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the phasing-out of the Diploma of Higher Education (a UK Level 5 qualification)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in Nursing which was previously offered at universities and colleges.

To become a student nurse, individuals must apply through the University and Colleges Admissions Service (commonly referred to as "UCAS") to their nursing degree choices, choosing from one of the four nursing fields: Adult, Children, Mental Health and Learning Disabilities. Requirements for entry to a pre-reg nursing degree are usually five GCSEs (including mathematics, English language and at least one science subject) at Grade C or above, along with three A-Level subjects (preferably but not essentially science-based) at Grade C or above, although the majority of universities will seek higher grades due to the competition for places. Key Skills courses are generally no-longer accepted as an alternative to GCSEs, however science or healthcare-based BTEC Level 3 Extended Diplomas and Access courses are most oftem accepted in lieu of A-Level qualifications.

If successful following interview, the student will study a "core" first year, learning basic nursing competencies essential to all four of the above fields. It is then from second year and onwards that the degree will begin to focus on the student's chosen field. Following completion of the degree, the applicant will be registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) as a Registered Nurse in their field of practice, using the post-nominal RNA, RNC, RNMH or RNLD as appropriate to their degree qualification.

=== Nursing degrees in Western Australia ===
There are two specific pathways individuals can take if they wish to become a nurse in Western Australia (WA). They can decide to study at university to become a registered nurse (RN), alternatively they can study at Technical and Further Education (TAFE) to become an enrolled nurse (EN). Both pathways require a variety of entry requirements whether it be passing year 12 Maths, English and Human Biology along with receiving a specific Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) also known as a score for university or providing prior learning experiences and legal clearances for TAFE.  Either way individuals need to be aware these requirements can vary year to year and that is why they are recommended to contact each university or institute to find out entry requirements.

In WA there are four universities where individuals can choose to attend if they are wanting to complete a nursing degree.

Edith Cowan University (ECU) is located at Joondalup and South West (Bunbury) campus. ECU offers the Bachelor of Science (Nursing) degree which individuals can choose to study for three years full time or six years part time both on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecu.edu.au/degrees/courses/bachelor-of-science-nursing|title=Bachelor of science (nursing)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Edith Cowan University|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curtain University is located in Bently, WA. This university offers an Undergraduate Nursing degree additionally referred to as Bachelor of Science (Nursing). This degree runs on campus for three and a half years full time however, students can request to study this degree part time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://courses.curtin.edu.au/course_overview/undergraduate/nursing|title=Undergraduate nursing|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Curtin University|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murdoch University also offers offer a Bachelor of Nursing degree with a three year completion date. The university offers this degree at Peel or South Street campus in Murdoch, WA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.murdoch.edu.au/Courses/Nursing/Details-and-fees/|title=Nursing bachelor of Nursing (BNurs)|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|publisher=Murdoch University|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final university that offers a nursing degree in WA is located throughout Fremantle and is known as the University of Notre Dame. This university offer a Bachelor of Nursing degree which will take three years to achieve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nd.edu.au/fremantle/courses/undergraduate/nursing/bonursing.shtml|title=Nursing|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|publisher=The University of Notre Dame|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When students graduate from one of the four universities listed above they will be fully qualified as an RN and have a wide variety of job opportunities available. However, if individuals discover that university is not for them or can not gain entry into university, it is not the end of the world because there are alternative pathways available.

Attending TAFE is an alternative career pathway for individuals that still wish to pursue this profession. There are six institutes spread across WA which offer a Diploma of Nursing (Enrolled-Division 2 Nursing). These institutes include C.Y.O’Connor Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cyoc.wa.edu.au/courses/health-and-nursing/HLT51612|title=Diploma of nursing (enrolled-division 2 nursing)|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|publisher=Government of Western Australia Central Regional TAFE|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Great Southern Institute of Technology,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gsit.wa.edu.au/courses/course-detail/diploma-of-nursing-(enrolled-division-2)|title=Nursing (enrolled/division 2) (diploma)|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|publisher=Government of Western Australia South Regional TAFE|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldfields Institute of Technology,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goldfields.wa.edu.au/courses/nursing/nursing/diploma-of-nursing-enrolleddivision-2-nursing/|title=Diploma of nursing (enrolled/division 2 nursing)|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|publisher=Government of Western Australia Central Regional TAFE|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pilbara Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pilbara.wa.edu.au/courses-at-pi/diploma-of-nursing-enrolled-division-2-nursing|title=Diploma of nursing (enrolled-division 2 nursing)|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|publisher=Government of Western Australia North Regional TAFE|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; South West Institute of Technology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swit.wa.edu.au/courses/Pages/Diploma-of-Nursing-(Enrolled-Division-2-Nursing).aspx|title=Diploma of nursing (enrolled-division 2 nursing)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Government of Western Australia South Regional TAFE|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and West Coast Institute of Training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wcit.wa.edu.au/courses/study-area/community/nursing/nursing/diploma-of-nursing-(enrolled-division-2-nursing)|title=Diploma of nursing (enrolled-division 2 nursing)|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|publisher=Government of Western Australia North Metropolitan TAFE|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All institutes in WA roughly take eighteen months to complete the diploma when studying full time. Once a student successfully graduates from the Diploma of Nursing (Enrolled-Division 2 Nursing) they will be qualified as an EN.

Overall, there are alternative pathways available however an RN holds higher qualifications than an EN. There are key similarities of an RN and an EN as they both desire to fulfil their dreams of becoming a nurse and they must be registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nursingmidwiferyboard.gov.au/Registration-and-Endorsement.aspx|title=Regulation &amp; Endorsement|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|publisher=Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by complying with the Board’s registration standards.

== Scope ==
Nursing education includes instruction in topic areas. These are [[nursing assessment]], [[nursing diagnosis]], and [[nursing care plan]]ning.  
In the United States, nursing students learn through traditional classroom and lab instruction.  Nursing education also involves clinical rotations and simulation, throughout their schooling, to develop care planning and clinical reasoning.   At the end of schooling, nursing students in the US and Canada, must take and pass the NCLEX, National Council of Licensure Examination to practice.

== Nursing specialties ==
There are a variety of areas where nurses can specialise in and they may decide they want to be qualified in one or several specialities over the course of their career. Here are an array of some of the nursing specialty fields available:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ww2.health.wa.gov.au/Careers/Occupations/Nursing-and-midwifery/Specialising-information-for-nurses-and-midwives|title=Specialising – information for nurses and midwives|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Government of Western Australia Department of Health|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present aims==
Among nurse educators, arguments continue about the ideal balance of practical preparation and the need to educate the future practitioner to manage healthcare and to have a broader view of the practice. To meet both requirements, nurse education aims to develop a lifelong learner who can adapt effectively to changes in both the theory and practice of nursing.

While it is clear that the use of [[Medical simulation]] in nursing education is important for improving practice, patient safety, and [[Interprofessional education|interprofessional team skills]], the balance of simulation to clinical time remains in the hands of the institutions.&lt;ref name="NCSBNsimGuidelines"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Alexander M, [[Carol Fowler Durham|Durham CF]], Hooper JI, Jeffries PR, Goldman N, Kardong-Edgren S, Kesten KS, Spector N, Tagliareni E, Radtke B, Tillman C |title=NCSBN Simulation Guidelines for Prelicensure Nursing Programs. |journal=Journal of Nursing Regulation |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=39–42 |year=2015 |pmid= |pmc= |doi= 10.1016/s2155-8256(15)30783-3|url=http://www.journalofnursingregulation.com/article/S2155-8256%2815%2930783-3/pdf |accessdate=2015-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11129">Occupational noise is the amount of acoustic energy received by an employee's auditory system when they are working in the industry. Occupational noise, or industrial noise, is often a term used in [[occupational safety and health]], as sustained exposure can cause permanent hearing damage.

"Twenty-two million workers are exposed to potentially damaging noise at work each year. Last year, U.S. business paid more than $1.5 million in penalties for not protecting workers from noise." - OSHA&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/noisehearingconservation/index.html|title=Safety and Health Topics {{!}} Occupational Noise Exposure {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occupational noise is considered an [[occupational hazard]] traditionally linked to loud industries such as [[ship-building]], [[mining]], railroad work, [[welding]], and [[construction]], but can be present in any workplace where hazardous noise is present.

In the United States, the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) and the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) work together to provide standards and regulations for noise in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/noisehearingconservation/standards.html|title=Occupational Noise Exposure: Standards|website=Occupational Safety and Health Administration|access-date=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH), [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA), [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] (MSHA), [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA) have all set standards on hazardous occupational noise in their respective industries. Each industry is different, as workers'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''' tasks and equipment differ, but most regulations agree that noise becomes hazardous when it exceeds 85 [[Decibel|decibels]], for an 8-hour time exposure (typical work shift). This relationship between allotted noise level and exposure time is known as an [[Exposure action value]] (EAV) or [[Permissible exposure limit]] (PEL). The EAV or PEL can be seen as equations which manipulate the allotted exposure time according to the intensity of the industrial noise. This equation works as an inverse, exponential, relationship. As the industrial noise intensity increases, the allotted exposure tie, to still remain safe, decreases.

The above calculations of PEL and EAV are based on measurements taken to determine the intensity of that particular industrial noise. [[A-weighting|A-weighted]] measurements are commonly used to determine noise levels that can cause harm to the human ear. There are also special exposure meters available that integrate noise over a period of time to give an [[Sound level meter#LAT or Leq: Equivalent continuous sound level|L&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;]] value (equivalent sound pressure level), defined by standards.

== Risks of Occupational Hearing Loss ==
[[File:Temporary threshold shift (hearing loss) after noise exposure.jpg|thumb|Temporary hearing loss after loud noise exposure. If such exposure is long enough, this temporary threshold shift may become permanent.&lt;ref name="Измеров-2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Izmerov|first1=Nikolai|last2=Suvorov|first2=Herman|last3=Prokopenko|first3=Ludmila|title=The man and the noise (Человек и шум)|year=2001|publisher=ГЕОТАР-МЕД|location=Moscow|language=ru|isbn=5-9231-0057-6|page=103|chapter=Chapter 4. Occupational hearing loss}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Occupational noise, if experienced repeatedly, at high intensity, for an extended period of time, can cause [[noise-induced hearing loss]] (NIHL) which is then classified as [[occupational hearing loss]].

Noise, in the context of industrial noise, is hazardous to a person's hearing because of its loud intensity through repeated long-term exposure. In order for [[noise]] to cause [[hearing impairment]] for the worker, the noise has to be close enough, loud enough, and sustained long enough to damage the [[Hair cell|hair cells]] in the auditory system. Please see [[Occupational hearing loss]] or [[Noise-induced hearing loss]] for more information regarding the physiology of hearing loss. These factors have been taken into account by the governing occupational health and safety organization to determine the unsafe noise exposure levels and durations for their respective industries.

Noise can also affect the safety of the employee and others. Noise can be a causal factor in [[Work accident|work accidents]] as it may mask hazards and warning signals and impede concentration. High intensity noise interferes with vital workplace communication which increases the chance of accidents and decreases productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://soundcontroltech.com/effects-of-noise-on-the-individual-in-the-workplace/|title=Effects of Noise on The Individual in the Workplace {{!}} Sound Control|website=soundcontroltech.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noise may also act synergistically with other hazards to increase the risk of harm to workers. In particular, toxic materials (e.g. some [[Solvent|solvents]], metals, asphyxiants and pesticides) have some [[Ototoxicity|ototoxic properties]] that may affect hearing function.

Modern thinking in [[occupational safety and health]] further identifies noise as hazardous to workers' safety and health. This hazard is experienced in various places of employment and through a variety of sources.

Noise, in the context of industrial noise, is hazardous to a persons hearing because of its loud intensity through repeated long-term exposure. In order for [[Noise]] to cause [[Hearing impairment]] for the worker, the noise has to be close enough, loud enough and the listener has to be exposed for long enough. These factors have been taken into account by the governing occupational health and safety organizations as they determine the unsafe noise exposure levels and durations for their respective industries.

[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH), [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA), [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] (MSHA), [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA)  have all set standards on hazardous occupational noise in their respective industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-126/pdfs/98-126.pdf|title=Criteria for Recommended Standard: Occupational Noise Exposure|last=|first=|date=|website=Center for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each industry is different, as workers tasks and equipment differ, but most regulations agree that noise becomes hazardous when it exceeds 85 [[Decibel]], for an 8-hour exposure (typical work shift).

[[File:Hierarchy of Controls (By NIOSH).jpg|thumb|Hierarchy of Controls guideline]]
There are several ways to limit your exposure to hazardous occupational noise. The [[Hierarchy of hazard controls|hierarchy of controls]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hierarchy/|title=CDC - Hierarchy of Controls - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a guideline for reducing hazardous noise. First, the company can eliminate the noise source. If the noise source cannot be eliminated, the company must try to reduce the noise with alternative methods. This process is called acoustic quieting.  

[[Acoustic quieting]] is the process of making machinery quieter by damping vibrations to prevent them from reaching the observer. The company can isolate the certain piece of machinery by placing materials on the machine or in between the machine and the worker to decreases the signal intensity that reaches the worker's ear.

To decrease an employee's exposure to hazardous noise, the company can also take [[Administrative controls|administrative control]] by limiting the employee's exposure time. This can be done by changing work shifts and switching employees out from the noise exposure area. Lastly, to decrease occupational noise exposure, [[hearing protection]] should be used. There are several types of [[Earplug|earplugs]] and earmuffs that can be used to attenuate the noise to a safe level.

'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''

For a more detailed description of the hierarchy of controls, please see [[Occupational hearing loss]]. 

== Initiatives ==
Since the hazards of occupational noise exposure were realized, programs and initiatives such as the US [[Buy Quiet]] program have been set up to regulate or discourage noise exposure. The Buy Quiet initiative promotes the purchase of quieter tools and equipment and encourages manufacturers to design quieter machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet/default.html|title=Buy Quiet|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[Safe-In-Sound Award]] was created to recognize successes in hearing loss prevention programs or initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.safeinsound.us/|title=Safe-in-Sound:Excellence in Hearing Loss Prevention Award|website=Safe-in-Sound|access-date=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921''' ([[Title 7 of the United States Code|7 U.S.C.]] §§ 181-229b; '''P&amp;S Act''') was enacted following the release in 1919 of the Report of the [[Federal Trade Commission]] on the [[meatpacking]] industry.

==History and passage==
As the outbreak of [[World War I]] occurred and the [[cost of living]] rose, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] ordered the FTC to investigate the industry from the "hoof to the table" to determine whether or not there were any "manipulations, controls, [[Trust (19th century)|trusts]], [[Price fixing|combinations]], or [[restraint of trade|restraints]] out of harmony with the law or the public interest."

The FTC reported packers were manipulating markets, restricting flow of foods, controlling the price of dressed meat, defrauding producers and consumers of food and crushing competition.  The FTC, in fact, recommended governmental ownership of the stockyards and their related facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Food investigation : report of the Federal trade commission on the meat-packing industry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vuuBAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA76|year=1919|pages=76–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meat packing industry had also become a prime concern of Wilson's [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Alexander Mitchell Palmer]].  After threatening an antitrust suit, in February 1920 Palmer managed to force the "Big Five" packers ([[Armour and Company|Armour]], Cudahy, Morris, Swift and Wilson) to agree to a [[consent decree]] under the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] which drove the packers out of all non-meat production, including stockyards, warehouses, wholesale and retail meat.

Agitation for legislation to regulate the packers persisted into the [[Warren Harding]] administration despite the decree.  The [[United States Congress]] sought to protect farm profits through the [[Emergency Tariff of 1921]] on May 27.  Congress passed the Packers and Stockyards Act on August 15, 1921 as '''H.R. 6320''' and the law went into effect in September 1921.  Congress would go on to pass the [[Future Trading Act]] the next week and granted farmers' co-ops broad antitrust immunity in the [[Capper-Volstead Act]] on February 18, 1922.

The Act's purpose at the time it was passed was to "regulate [[Commerce Clause|interstate and foreign commerce]] in live stock, live-stock produce, dairy products, poultry, poultry products, and [[Egg (food)|eggs]], and for other purposes." It prohibited packers from engaging in unfair and deceptive practices, giving undue preferences to persons or localities, apportioning supply among packers in restraint of commerce, manipulating prices, creating a [[monopoly]] or conspiring to aid in unlawful acts. The Act also made stockyards quasi-public utilities and required yard officers, agents and employees to register with the government. Stockyards were forbidden from dealing in the livestock they handled, and required them to maintain accurate weights and measures and pay shippers promptly. However, not all stockyards were under the jurisdiction of the Act. Only those with pen space larger than twenty thousand square feet were regulated.

Today, the Act's scope has expanded to regulate the activity of livestock dealers, market agencies, live poultry dealers and swine contractors as well as meatpackers.

==Interpretation==
===Court interpretation===
The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] upheld the act in ''Stafford v. Wallace'' (1922).&lt;ref name=drake10&gt;[http://aglawjournal.wp.drake.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2016/09/agVol15No3-RobertsShively.pdf John D. Shively, and Jeffrey S. Roberts, ''Competition under the Packers and Stockyards Act: What Now,''] 15 Drake J. Agric. L. 419 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Chief Justice [[William Howard Taft]] reasoned the act was a valid exercise under the interstate [[Commerce Clause]] because it addressed the same problem as the injunction upheld in ''[[Swift &amp; Co. v. United States]]'' (1905).

In 1996, a group of cattle feeders brought a class action lawsuit under the P&amp;S Act against [[Iowa Beef Packers]] for [[captive supply]] agreements.&lt;ref name=drake10/&gt;  In 2004, a jury delivered a verdict for the plaintiffs, finding damages of $1.2 billion.&lt;ref name=drake10/&gt;  The verdict was then thrown out by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] in ''Pickett v. Tyson Fresh Meats Inc.'' (2005) because it found the meatpacker had a legitimate business reason to limit competition.&lt;ref name=drake10/&gt;

In 2008, a federal district court found that [[Pilgrim's Pride]] had given undue advantages to [[Lonnie "Bo" Pilgrim]], its founder and chairman.&lt;ref name=drake10/&gt;  Judge [[Emilio M. Garza]] of [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] affirmed, over a dissent by Judge [[Thomas Morrow Reavley]].&lt;ref name=drake10/&gt;  The Fifth Circuit [[en banc]] then reversed, voting 9-7 in ''Wheeler v. Pilgrim's Pride Corp.'' (2009).&lt;ref name=drake10/&gt;  Judge Reavley wrote that all claims under the P&amp;S Act must prove adverse impact to competition, over a dissent by Judge Garza.&lt;ref name=drake10/&gt;

===Agency interpretation===
The P&amp;S Act is administered by the [[Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration]] (GIPSA) of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]].  In 2010, GIPSA Administrator J. Dudley Butler and [[United States Assistant Attorney General]] for Antitrust [[Christine A. Varney]] held a series of hearing on [[monopsony]], [[market manipulation]], and [[market concentration]] in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.justice.gov/atr/events/public-workshops-agriculture-and-antitrust-enforcement-issues-our-21st-century-economy-10 United States Department of Justice, ''Public Workshops: On Agriculture and Antitrust Enforcement in our 21st Century Economy ''], Last updated: February 5, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  On June 22, 2010, GIPSA published a proposed rule that would have reduced the legal standard for [[anti-competitive practices]], forbidden unfair practices and undue advantages even without harm to competition, and ensured producers had access to arbitration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://federalregister.gov/a/2010-14875 ''Implementation of Regulations Required Under Title XI of the Food, Conservation and Energy Act of 2008; Conduct in Violation of the Act''], 75 Fed. Reg. 35338 (proposed June 22, 2010) (to be codified at 9 C.F.R. pt. 201).&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the proposed rule sought to combat [[price fixing]] by prohibiting packers from selling to other packers and preventing multiple packers from using a single buyer.&lt;ref name=CRS&gt;[[Congressional Research Service]] Report R41673, USDA's "GIPSA Rule" on Livestock and Poultry Marketing Practices, by Joel L. Greene (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed rule was supported by the [[National Farmers Union (United States)|National Farmers Union]] and the U.S. Cattlemen's Association but opposed by the [[National Cattlemen's Beef Association]] and the [[National Chicken Council]].&lt;ref name=CRS/&gt;  USDA estimated the rule would cost between $21.3 million to $72.1 million.&lt;ref name=CRS/&gt;  The [[American Meat Institute]] estimated the rule would cost $14 billion.&lt;ref name=CRS/&gt;

On November 3, 2011, GIPSA announced it would publish the final rule, but without the controversial price fixing measures.&lt;ref name=CRS/&gt;  On November 18, 2011, Congress defunded USDA's implementation of most of the rest of the rule.&lt;ref name=CRS/&gt;  Assistant AG Varney and Administrator Butler had both resigned by the end of January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morris|first1=Frank|title=Antitrust Official Gets Stampeded By Big Beef|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2012/01/25/145846326/an-antitrust-official-gets-pounded-by-big-beef|accessdate=23 June 2016|work=[[All Things Considered]]|agency=[[NPR]]|date=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress continued defunding the rule in riders to the 2013, 2014, and 2015 appropriation bills.&lt;ref name=CRS/&gt;  An amendment to permanently repeal the GIPSA rule in the [[Agricultural Act of 2014]] failed after meatpackers' opposition to the rule was lampooned on [[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Vanessa|title=John Oliver 1, Big Chicken 0?|url=https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2015/07/john-oliver-1-big-chicken-0/|accessdate=24 June 2016|work=OpenSecrets Blog|agency=[[Center for Responsive Politics]]|date=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amendment==
The Act has been updated several times to keep pace with a changing and dynamic industry.

The first major amendment to the Act was in 1958, when Congress expanded the [[jurisdiction]] of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) to include all [[auction]] markets operating in commerce. Before 1958, only auction markets with an area of 20,000 square feet (1,858 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) or more were covered. In addition, jurisdiction over market agencies and dealers was expanded to include all of their livestock activities in commerce, including those away from stockyards.

In 1976, the Act was amended to increase financial protection to livestock producers and to expand USDA jurisdiction.  This amendment:
#required meat packers with annual livestock purchases of over $500,000 to be [[Surety bond|bond]]ed;
#provided trust protection for producers in the event of nonpayment for livestock by a meat packer;
#expanded USDA's jurisdiction over wholesale brokers, dealers, and distributors marketing meat in commerce and 
#authorized the Agency to assess civil penalties of not more than $10,000 per violation.

In subsequent legislation that amount was increased to $11,000 for packers, swine contractors, stockyard owners, market agencies, or dealers, and $27,000 for live poultry dealers.

In 1987, the Act was amended to provide trust protection to live poultry sellers and contract growers in the event of nonpayment for poultry by live poultry dealers and in 2000 it was amended to require P&amp;SP to perform an annual assessment of the cattle and hog industries.

The [[Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002]] (2002 [[United States farm bill|Farm Bill]]) amended the Act to regulate certain activities of swine contractors who enter into swine production contracts with contract growers.

In general, the amendment made swine contractors subject to certain provisions of the Packers and Stockyards Act. The amendment prohibited certain activities of swine contractors, required swine contractors to maintain certain records, and held them responsible for the acts of their employees, officers, and agents. The amendment also gave swine production contract growers the right to sue swine contractors in [[United States district court|federal district court]].  The amendment did not impose any new bonding or registration requirements, establish a trust for swine production contract growers, or establish any prompt payment requirements for swine contractors.

The '''Problem Gambling Foundation of New Zealand''' (PGF) is a national non-profit organisation in [[New Zealand]] predominantly funded by the [[Ministry of Health (New Zealand)|Ministry of Health]] with funds received from the [[gambling]] levy.

PGF is the largest single treatment provider for problem gambling in [[Australasia]], with over 60 locations throughout New Zealand and a staff of 70.  Qualified counselors provide free, professional and confidential counseling services for gamblers and others affected by gambling; a dedicated public health team works on problem-gambling issues in the community with a [[health promotion]] approach.

PGF's Asian Family Services provides professional counseling and advice in [[Cantonese]], [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[Khmer language|Khmer]] and [[Thai language|Thai]].

The PGF began as the Compulsive Gambling Society (CGS) in 1988 with funding from the [[New Zealand Lottery Grants Board]]. Psychiatrist Fraser McDonald helped three men who were experiencing problems with gambling establish the CGS because, at that time, there were no services available for gambling problems.  CGS started out as a telephone service, with the first national hotline of its type beginning in 1992.  As the need grew, services expanded to include face-to-face services; a second clinic was opened in [[Manurewa]] in 1993.

In 2001 The PGF succeeded the CGS, moving from an addictions and medical-based philosophy to a public-health approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10775867 Michael Dickison and Adam Bennett, "NZ's $926m Lotto gamble".

'''Pseudoachondroplasia''' is an inherited disorder of bone growth&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/pseudoachondroplasia|title=pseudoachondroplasia|last=Reference|first=Genetics Home|website=Genetics Home Reference|language=en|access-date=2017-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  It is a genetic [[autosomal dominant]] disorder. It is generally not discovered until 2-3 years of age, since growth is normal at first. Pseudoachondroplasia is usually first detected by a drop of linear growth in contrast to peers, a curious, [[waddling gait]] or arising lower limb deformities.&lt;ref name=gamal2017/&gt; 

Pseudoachondroplasia (also known as PSACH, Pseudoachondroplastic dysplasia, and Pseudoachondroplastic spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia syndrome) is an [[osteochondrodysplasia]] that results in mild to severely [[short stature]] due to the inhibition of skeletal growth primarily in the limbs.&lt;ref name=gamal2017/&gt;  Though similarities in nomenclature may cause confusion, Pseudoachondroplasia should not be confused with [[achondroplasia]], which is a clinically and genetically distinct [[skeletal dysplasia]].  Pseudoachondroplasia is caused by a heterozygous mutation in the gene encoding cartilage oligomeric matrix protein COMP. Mutation in the COMP gene can also multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. Despite the radioclinical similarities between pseudoachondroplasia and [[multiple epiphyseal dysplasia]], the latter is less severe.[https://www.omim.org/entry/132400 132400] 

==Clinical features==
Disproportionate [[short stature]], deformity of the lower limbs, short fingers, and 
ligamentous laxity give pseudoachondroplasia its distinctive features. The average height of adult males with the condition is around 120 centimeters (3 ft, 11 in), while adult females are typically around 116 cm (3ft, 9in).  Affected individuals are not noticeably short at birth. Patients with pseudoachondroplasia present with gait abnormalities, lower limb deformity, or a retarded growth rate that characteristically appear at age 2-3 years.  Disproportionate [[short stature]] is characterized by shortening of proximal limb segments (humeri and femora) also called rhizomelic shortening. Other known clinical features include, genu valgum/varum, brachydactyly (short fingers), supple flexion deformity of the hips, knees, hyperlordosis of lumbar spine, rocker bottom feet and broadening of the metaphyseal ends of long bones especially around the wrists, knees and ankles. Patients with pseudoachondroplasia have normal intelligence and craniofacial features, [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pseudoachondroplasia_01.jpg “Figure 1”], [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pseudoachondroplasia_02.jpg “Figure 2”],  [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pseudoachondroplasia_03.jpg “Figure 3”]. &lt;ref name=gamal2017&gt;Gamal R, Elsayed SM, EL-Sobky TA, Elabd HS (2017).

''Hum. Mutat''. '''33''': 144–57. doi:10.1002/humu.21611. {{PMID|21922596}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inheritance== 
Pseudoachondroplasia is inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]] manner, though one case of a very rare [[autosomal recessive]] form has been documented.  The offspring of affected individuals are at 50% risk of inheriting the mutant allele.  Prenatal testing by molecular genetic examination is available if the disease-causing mutation has been identified in an affected family member (Hecht et al. 1995). 

==Pathophysiology==  
COMP is an extracellular calcium binding protein directly involved in chondrocyte migration and proliferation.  It is observed at a high frequency in chondrocytes in developing bone and tendon.  In pseudochondroplasia, COMP is not secreted, but instead collects in the chondrocytes, ultimately poisoning and killing them.  Though some chondrocytes do manage to survive, growth is significantly reduced, resulting in the characteristically short limbs and seemingly unaffected face and torso of those inflicted with the disorder (OMIM 2008).  Mutations in COMP result in a phenotypic spectrum that varies from pseudochondroplasia (at the most extreme end) to multiple epiphyseal dysplasia or MED (a genetically similar, though milder skeletal dysplasia).&lt;ref name=jackson2012/&gt;    

Studies conducted by Hetch et al. suggest that type IX collagen, a collagen active specifically in the construction of cartilage, plays a key role in pseudoachondroplasia.  The researchers found that IX collagen was amassed within the pseudoachondroplasia chondrocytes.  This discovery suggests that the pathogenesis of pseudoachondroplasia involves the interactions of the mutant COMP gene products with specific cartilage components, such as type IX collagen, and that it is not solely the result of the effects of mutant molecules on the production and secretion of COMP (OMIM 2008).

===Molecular biology===
The COMP gene is located on chromosome 19p13.1; its precise locus is P49747.  COMP contains 19 exons. The cartilage oligomeric matrix protein is 757 aa (OMIM 2008). COMP protein is found in the [[extracellular matrix]], a complex web of proteins and other molecules that form in the spaces between the cells that make up ligaments and tendons.  It is also found near [[chondrocytes]] (cartilage-forming cells). Chondrocytes play a vital role in [[osteogenesis]] (the formation of bone), particularly in the spine, hips, and limbs where osteogenesis begins with the formation of cartilage, which is then calcified and transformed into bone.  We do not yet fully understand the normal function of COMP protein, though it is believed to play a part in cellular growth, division and [[apoptosis]] (self-destruction) of cells, as well as participating in the regulation of cell movement and attachment (OMIM 2008).  

Nearly 60 mutations in the COMP gene have been identified in individuals with pseudoachondroplasia.  However, the mutation responsible for the most common allele is a deletion of one codon within a very short triplet repeat (GAC), in which the 469th amino acid, an aspartic acid, is deleted (OMIM 2008).

==Diagnosis==

Lesions are bilateral and symmetrical.]]

Exact diagnosis remains widely built on precise history taking, with the characteristic clinical and radiographic skeletal features.&lt;ref name= gamal2017/&gt;&lt;ref name= moosa2013/&gt; Genetic diagnosis is based on DNA sequencing. Because plasma COMP levels are significantly reduced in patients with COMP mutations, such as pseudoachondroplasia, measuring plasma COMP levels has become a reliable means of diagnosing this and pathopysiologically similar disorders.&lt;ref&gt;AC Tufan, NL Satiroglu-Tufan, GC Jackson, CN Semerci, S Solak, B Yagci (2007).

===Skeletal radiography===
Accurate assessment of plain radiographic findings remains an important contributor to diagnosis of pseudoachondroplasia. It is noteworthy that vertebral radiographic abnormalities tend to resolve over time. Epiphyseal abnormalities tend to run a progressive course. Patients usually suffer early-onset arthritis of hips and knees. Many unique skeletal radiographic abnormalities of patients with pseudoachondroplasia have been reported in the literature.&lt;ref name=gamal2017&gt;Gamal R, Elsayed SM, EL-Sobky TA, Elabd HS (2017).

==Treatment==
There is currently no cure for pseudoachondroplasia.  However, management of the various health problems that result from the disorder includes medications such as analgesics (painkillers) for joint discomfort, osteotomy for lower limb deformities, and the surgical treatment of scoliosis.  Prevention of some related health problems includes physical therapy to preserve joint flexibility and regular examinations to detect degenerative joint disease and neurological manifestations (particularly spinal cord compression).  Additionally, healthcare providers recommend treatment for psychosocial issues related to [[short stature]] and other physical deformities for both affected individuals and their families (OMIM 2008).   

==Epidemiology==
Pseudoachondroplasia is one of the most common skeletal dysplasias affecting all racial groups.  However, no precise incidence figures are currently available (Suri et al. 2004).  

==History== 
In 1995 the gene responsible for Pseudoachondroplasia was identified by a research team led by Dr. Jacqueline Hecht of The University of Texas-Houston, Health Science Center.  This discovery additionally shed light on the COMP protein, which the team recognized as somehow involved in skeletal growth and height determination (Hetch et al. 1995).&lt;ref name="Adelson2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Adelson|first=Betty M. |title=Dwarfism: Medical and Psychosocial Aspects of Profound Short Stature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_lR1e5sBkd8C&amp;pg=PT39|year=2011|publisher=The John Hopkins University Press|isbn=0-8018-8121-8 |page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

In 1997, Hetch and her colleagues from the Research Department at Shriners Hospital for Children in Portland, Oregon conducted further research, which led to their discovery that the intracellular fate of mutant COMP is determined by the environment of individual chondrocytes, contrary to the previous notion that COMP activities leading to Pseudoachondroplasia were determined by structural effects of the mutation on COMP; this meant that COMP activities are cell-specific (Hetch et al. 1995). 

Hetch et al. also discovered type IX collagen accumulated within the Pseudoachondroplasia chondrocytes.  This discovery indicated the pathogenesis of Pseudoachondroplasia results from the interactions of the products of the mutant COMP allele with certain “cartilage components,” particularly with type IX collagen (Hetch et al. 1995).

[[File:REGI Base Svémyslice.jpg|thumb|258px|The REGI Base facility, in July 2012, currently under construction within the town of [[Svémyslice]].]]

The '''REGI Base Foundation''' is a [[nonprofit organization]] based in [[Prague, Czech Republic]], which provides medical treatment for veterans of foreign wars.

With a facility currently being constructed in [[Svémyslice|Svémyslice, Czech Republic]].

The intent is to provide a location where wounded warriors can receive year-round care if they cannot be treated at home or by the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Velinger|first=Jan|title=REGI Base|date=August 30, 2011|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/new-prague-medical-facility-to-help-military-veterans-suffering-from-serious-long-term-injuries|publisher=Radio Prague|accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The inspiration for REGI Base Foundation came after Chief Warrant Officer Jiří (Regi) Schams was severely wounded during a suicide attack in March 2008 in the Helmand province of Afghanistan. Regi himself had little chance for survival after the attack, but showed signs of improvement after several months of treatment. Regi was confined to a wheelchair due to his brain injury that had affected his motor skills and coordination. Regi died on January 7, 2015 due to complications from cancer. His legacy and inspiration live on to continue the treatment and care for wounded veterans from across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ve Svémyslicích vzniká privátní centrum pro válečné veterány|date=August 29, 2011|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/tema/zpravy/ve-svemyslicich-vznika-privatni-centrum-pro-valecne-veterany/680648|publisher=Ceske Noviny|accessdate=27 July 2012|language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Projects==

===Project Svémyslice===
The aim of the Foundation is to build a facility in the Czech Republic with equipment to provide care and rehabilitation to veterans with disabilities. This will provide for social, health, and cultural rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The construction of REGI Base I. started in 2011|date=June 1, 2011|url=http://www.regibase.cz/en/regi-base-svemyslice/|publisher=Foundation REGI Base I.|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon completion, the complex will include a dedicated medical section and provide housing units for long-term therapy clients and hotel-type rooms (for the accommodation of visitors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The construction of REGI Base I. started in 2011|date=June 1, 2011|url=http://www.regibase.cz/en/regi-base-svemyslice/|publisher=Foundation REGI Base I.|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The center will be open to veterans from both NATO member states and other international armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The construction of REGI Base I. started in 2011|date=June 1, 2011|url=http://www.regibase.cz/en/regi-base-svemyslice/|publisher=Foundation REGI Base I.|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
In addition to its original location, REGI Base is also pursuing an expansion of the foundation in [[San Antonio, Texas]], to serve wounded veterans within the United States.

The '''Royal Institute of Health Sciences''' (RIHS) is one of two main medical education centers in [[Bhutan]], the other being the [[Institute of Traditional Medicine Services (Bhutan)|Institute of Traditional Medicine Services]]. The RIHS was established in [[Thimphu]] in 1974 as a member college of the [[Royal University of Bhutan]], and is associated with the [[National Referral Hospital (Thimphu)|National Referral Hospital]].  The RIHS offers diploma and certificate programmes for nurses, medical technicians and other primary health care workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rub.edu.bt/path.php?action=rihs "Royal Institute of Health Sciences (RIHS), Thimphu"] The Royal University of Bhutan. Retrieved 7 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The institute received the [[World Health Organization]]'s 50th Anniversary Award for Primary Health Care in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whobhutan.org/EN/Section4/Section16_28.htm "Prevention and Control of Communicable Diseases"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728175432/http://www.whobhutan.org/EN/Section4/Section16_28.htm |date=2011-07-28 }} World Health Organization.

'''Sarcopenic obesity''' is a medical condition which is defined as the presence of both [[sarcopenia]] and [[obesity]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cruz-Jentoft|first=Alfonso J.|last2=Baeyens|first2=Jean Pierre|last3=Bauer|first3=Jürgen M.|last4=Boirie|first4=Yves|last5=Cederholm|first5=Tommy|last6=Landi|first6=Francesco|last7=Martin|first7=Finbarr C.|last8=Michel|first8=Jean-Pierre|last9=Rolland|first9=Yves|date=2010-07-01|title=Sarcopenia: European consensus on definition and diagnosis: Report of the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People|journal=Age and Ageing|volume=39|issue=4|pages=412–423|doi=10.1093/ageing/afq034|issn=1468-2834|pmc=2886201|pmid=20392703}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sarcopenia]] refers to the presence of low muscle mass and either low muscular strength or low physical performance. When this is accompanied by a high fat mass the condition is known as sarcopenic obesity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Symptoms==
The symptoms are similar to those of [[sarcopenia]] and [[obesity]]. The individual may show a [[Body mass index|BMI]] that is appropriate and healthy to his or her age but will look fat in appearance.

==Causes==
The disease is caused due to a variety of reasons:
*It can be due to [[aging]], wherein [[muscles]] become weak due to a lack of [[exercise]], and the individual gains weight due to the same reason.
*In other cases, the cause is [[gene]]tic, wherein the individual is born with a reduced ability to grow muscle mass.

==Diagnosis==
The problem of diagnosing a person with the condition is hard as there is no [[reference value]] for the appropriate lean mass. This is because healthy people tend to show variations in their composition due to their [[body types]].

==Treatment==
An appropriate [[weight training]] and [[weight loss]] program can help to improve the patient's condition.
==Etymology==
The term is a mix of two different words- [[Sarcopenia]] and [[Obesity]]. "Sarcopenia" meaning loss of muscle and "Obesity" which is the increase in fat percentage.

{{citation style|date=April 2012}}
In [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]], a '''schema''' (plural ''schemata'' or ''schemas'') describes a pattern of thought or behavior that organizes categories of information and the relationships among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = DiMaggio | first1 = P | year = 1997 | title = Culture and cognition | url = | journal = Annual Review of Sociology | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 263–287 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.soc.23.1.263 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be described as a mental structure of preconceived ideas, a framework representing some aspect of the world, or a system of organizing and perceiving new information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary|url=http://www.psyctherapy.com/Enrolled/glossaryBody1.htm|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schemata influence attention and the absorption of new knowledge: people are more likely to notice things that fit into their schema, while re-interpreting contradictions to the schema as exceptions or distorting them to fit. Schemata have a tendency to remain unchanged, even in the face of contradictory information. Schemata can help in understanding the world and the rapidly changing environment.&lt;ref name="Nadkarni" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nadkarni | first1 = S. | last2 = Narayanan | first2 = V. K. | year = 2007 | title = Strategic schemas, strategic flexibility, and firm performance: The moderating role of industry clockspeed | url = | journal = Strategic Management Journal | volume = 28 | issue = 3| pages = 243–270 | doi = 10.1002/smj.576 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People can organize new perceptions into schemata quickly as most situations do not require complex thought when using schema, since automatic thought is all that is required.&lt;ref name="Nadkarni" /&gt;

People use schemata to organize current knowledge and provide a framework for future understanding. Examples of schemata include [[Rubric (academic)|academic rubrics]], [[Social cognition#Social schemas|social schemas]], stereotypes, [[social role]]s, [[Behavioral script|scripts]], [[worldview]]s, and [[archetype]]s. In [[Piaget's theory]] of development, children construct a series of schemata, based on the interactions they experience, to help them understand the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Georgeon | first1 = O.R. | last2 = Ritter | first2 = F.E. | year = 2011 | title = An intrinsically motivated schema mechanism to model and simulate emergent cognition | doi=10.1016/j.cogsys.2011.07.003 | journal = Cognitive Systems Research | volume = 15–16 | issue = | page = 75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before psychology separated from philosophy, the term "schema" was prominently discussed in philosophy by [[Schema (Kant)|Immanuel Kant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nevid | first1 = J. S. | year = 2007 | title = Kant, cognitive psychotherapy, and the hardening of the categories | url = | journal = Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice | volume = 80 | issue = 4| pages = 605–615 | doi = 10.1348/147608307X204189 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early developments of the idea in psychology emerged with the [[Gestalt psychology|gestalt psychologists]] and [[Jean Piaget]]: the term "schema" was introduced by Piaget in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, J. (1923). {{cite web|url=http://www.fondationjeanpiaget.ch/fjp/site/textes/VE/JP23_Langag_pensee_chap1_fonctionslang.pdf|title=Langage et pensée chez l'enfant}} (3e éd. 1948 revue et avec un nouvel avant-propos et un nouveau chapitre II inséré  utgave  bind). Neuchâtel: Delachaux et Niestlé, p. 43f.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was popularized in psychology and education through the work of the British psychologist [[Frederic Bartlett]],&lt;ref name="bartlett"&gt;{{cite book |last= Bartlett |first=F.C. |year=1932 |title=Remembering: A Study in Experimental and Social Psychology |location=Cambridge, England |publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/727e/7f158dc0839ef789e3cb99f3fc3f2e38e017.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; who drew on the term [[body schema]] used by neurologist [[Henry Head]]. It was expanded into schema theory by educational psychologist Richard C. Anderson.&lt;ref name=lingualinks&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/ImplementALiteracyProgram/SchemaTheoryOfLearning.htm|title=Schema theory of learning|work=LinguaLinks Library|publisher=SIL International|date=2 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, other terms have been used to describe schema such as "frame", "scene" and "script".

==Schematic processing==
Through the use of schemata, a [[heuristic]] technique to encode and retrieve memories, the majority of typical situations do not require much strenuous processing. People can quickly organize new perceptions into schemata and act without effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kleider | first1 = H.

However, schemata can influence and hamper the uptake of new information ([[proactive interference]]), such as when existing [[stereotype]]s, giving rise to limited or [[bias]]ed discourses and expectations ([[prejudice]]s), lead an individual to "see" or "remember" something that has not happened because it is more believable in terms of his/her schema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tuckey | first1 = M. | last2 = Brewer | first2 = N. | year = 2003 | title = The influence of schemas, stimulus ambiguity, and interview schedule on eyewitness memory over time | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 101–118 | doi = 10.1037/1076-898X.9.2.101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a well-dressed businessman draws a knife on a vagrant, the schemata of onlookers may (and often do) lead them to "remember" the vagrant pulling the knife. Such distortion of memory has been demonstrated. (See {{section link||Background research}} below.)

Schemata are interrelated and multiple conflicting schemata can be applied to the same information. Schemata are generally thought to have a level of activation, which can spread among related schemata. Which schema is selected can depend on factors such as current activation, accessibility, [[priming (psychology)|priming]] and emotion.

''Accessibility'' is how easily a schema comes to mind, and is determined by personal experience and expertise. This can be used as a cognitive shortcut; it allows the [[availability heuristic|most common explanation to be chosen for new information]].

With priming, a brief imperceptible stimulus temporarily provides enough activation to a schema so that it is used for subsequent ambiguous information. Although this may suggest the possibility of [[subliminal message]]s, the effect of priming is so fleeting that it is difficult to detect outside laboratory conditions. Furthermore, the [[mere exposure effect]]—which requires consciousness of the stimuli—is far more effective than priming.

==Background research==
The original concept of schemata is linked with that of reconstructive memory as proposed and demonstrated in a series of experiments by Bartlett.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;Bartlett, F.C. (1932). [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/727e/7f158dc0839ef789e3cb99f3fc3f2e38e017.pdf Remembering: A study in experimental and social psychology]. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; By presenting participants with information that was unfamiliar to their cultural backgrounds and expectations and then monitoring how they recalled these different items of information (stories, etc.), Bartlett was able to establish that individuals' existing schemata and stereotypes influence not only how they interpret "schema-foreign" new information but also how they recall the information over time. One of his most famous investigations involved asking participants to read a Native American folk tale, "The War of the Ghosts", and recall it several times up to a year later. All the participants transformed the details of the story in such a way that it reflected their cultural norms and expectations, i.e. in line with their schemata. The factors that influenced their recall were:
* Omission of information that was considered irrelevant to a participant;
* Transformation of some of the details, or of the order in which events, etc., were recalled; a shift of focus and emphasis in terms of what was considered the most important aspects of the tale;
* Rationalization: details and aspects of the tale that would not make sense would be "padded out" and explained in an attempt to render them comprehensible to the individual in question;
* Cultural shifts: the content and the style of the story were altered in order to appear more coherent and appropriate in terms of the cultural background of the participant.

Bartlett's work was crucially important in demonstrating that long-term memories are neither fixed nor immutable but are constantly being adjusted as schemata evolve with experience. In a sense it supports the [[existentialism|existentialist]] view that people construct the past and present in a constant process of narrative/discursive adjustment, and that much of what people "remember" is actually confabulated (adjusted and rationalized) narrative that allows them to think of the past as a continuous and coherent string of events, even though it is probable that large sections of memory (both episodic and semantic) are irretrievable at any given time.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt;

An important step in the development of schema theory was taken by the work of D.E. Rumelhart describing the understanding of narrative and stories.&lt;ref&gt;Rumelhart, D.E. (1980) [https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781351607247/chapters/10.4324%2F9781315107493-4 Schemata: the building blocks of cognition]. In: R.J. Spiro et al. (Eds) Theoretical Issues in Reading Comprehension, Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. See also: Mandler, J. M. (1984). Stories, scripts, and scenes: Aspects of schema theory. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Further work on the concept of schemata was conducted by W.F. Brewer and J.C. Treyens, who demonstrated that the schema-driven expectation of the presence of an object was sometimes sufficient to trigger its erroneous recollection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brewer | first1 = W. F. | last2 = Treyens | first2 = J. C. | title = Role of schemata in memory for places | journal = Cognitive Psychology | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages= 207–230 | year = 1981 | doi=10.1016/0010-0285(81)90008-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; An experiment was conducted where participants were requested to wait in a room identified as an academic's study and were later asked about the room's contents. A number of the participants recalled having seen books in the study whereas none were present. Brewer and Treyens concluded that the participants' expectations that books are present in academics' studies were enough to prevent their accurate recollection of the scenes.

In the 1970s, computer scientist [[Marvin Minsky]] was trying to develop machines that would have human-like abilities. When he was trying to create solutions for some of the difficulties he encountered he came across Bartlett's work and decided that if he was ever going to get machines to act like humans he needed them to use their stored knowledge to carry out processes. To compensate for that he created what was known as the frame construct, which was a way to represent knowledge in machines. His frame construct can be seen as an extension and elaboration of the schema construct. He created the frame knowledge concept as a way to interact with new information. He proposed that fixed and broad information would be represented as the frame, but it would also be composed of slots that would accept a range of values; but if the world didn't have a value for a slot, then it would be filled by a default value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Minsky|first=Marvin|title=A Framework for Representing Knowledge|year=1975|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|edition=The Psychology of Computer Vision|editor=Patrick H. Winston}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of Minsky's work, computers now have a stronger impact on psychology. In the 1980s, [[David Rumelhart]] extended Minsky's ideas, creating an explicitly psychological theory of the [[mental representation]] of complex knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rumelhart|first=David E.|title=Schemata: The Building Blocks of Cognition|year=1980|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Hillsdale, NJ|edition=Theoretical Issues in Reading Comprehension|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781351607247/chapters/10.4324%2F9781315107493-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger Schank and Robert Abelson developed the idea of a script, which was known as a generic knowledge of sequences of actions. This led to many new empirical studies, which found that providing relevant schema can help improve comprehension and recall on passages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schank|first1=Rodger C.|title=Scripts, Plans, Goals and Understanding|year=1977|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Hillsdale, NJ|last2=Abelson|first2=Robert P.|url=https://content.taylorfrancis.com/books/download?dac=C2007-0-06021-9&amp;isbn=9781134919666&amp;format=googlePreviewPdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modification==
New information that falls within an individual's schema is easily remembered and incorporated into their [[worldview]]. However, when new information is perceived that does not fit a schema, many things can happen. The most common reaction is to simply ignore or quickly forget the new information.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S. E., &amp; Crocker, J. (1981). Schematic bases of social information processing. In E. T. Higgins, C. A. Herman, &amp; M. P. Zanna (Eds.), Social cognition: The Ontario Symposium on Personality and Social Psychology (pp. 89-134). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; This can happen on a deep level— frequently an individual does not become conscious of or even perceive the new information. People may also interpret the new information in a way that minimizes how much they must change their schemata. For example, Bob thinks that chickens don't lay eggs. He then sees a chicken laying an egg. Instead of changing the part of his schema that says "chickens don't lay eggs", he is likely to adopt the belief that the animal in question that he has just seen laying an egg is not a real chicken. This is an example of [[disconfirmation bias]], the tendency to set higher standards for evidence that contradicts one's expectations.&lt;ref name="taberandlodge"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taber | first1 = Charles S. | last2 = Lodge | first2 = Milton | title = Motivated Skepticism in the Evaluation of Political Beliefs | journal = American Journal of Political Science | publisher = Midwest Political Science Association | volume = 50 | number = 3 | pages= 755–769 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00214.x | issn = 0092-5853}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the new information cannot be ignored, existing schemata must be changed or new schemata must be created (accommodation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Sullivan | first1 = Chris S. | last2 = Durso | first2 = Francis T. | year = 1984 | title = Effect of schema-incongruent information on memory for stereotypical attributes | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 47 | issue = 1| pages = 55–70 | pmid = 6747816 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.47.1.55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Piaget]] (1896–1980) was known best for his work with development of human knowledge. He believed knowledge was constructed on cognitive structures, and he believed people develop cognitive structures by accommodating and assimilating information. Accommodation is creating new schema that will fit better with the new environment or adjusting old schema. Accommodation could also be interpreted as putting restrictions on a current schema. Accommodation usually comes about when assimilation has failed. Assimilation is when people use a current schema to understand the world around them. Piaget thought that schemata are applied to everyday life and therefore people accommodate and assimilate information naturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Piaget|first=Jean|title=Studies in Reflection Abstraction|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|location=Sussex|isbn=1-84169-157-7|editor=Robert L. Campbell}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if this chicken has red feathers, Bob can form a new schemata that says "chickens with red feathers can lay eggs". This schemata will then be either changed or removed, in the future.

[[Assimilation (psychology)|Assimilation]] is the reuse of schemata to fit the new information. An example would be, when an unfamiliar dog is seen, a person will probably just integrate it into their dog schema. However, if the dog behaves strangely, and in ways that doesn't seem dog-like, there will be [[Accommodation (psychology)|accommodation]] as a new schema is formed for that particular dog. With Accommodation and Assimilation comes the idea of equilibrium. Piaget describes equilibrium as a state of cognition that is balanced when schema are capable of explaining what it sees and perceives. When information is new and cannot fit into existing schema this is called disequilibrium and this is an unpleasant state for the child's development. When disequilibrium happens, it means the person is frustrated and will try to restore the coherence of his or her cognitive structures through accommodation. If the new information is taken then assimilation of the new information will proceed until they find that they must make a new adjustment to it later down the road, but for now the child remains at equilibrium again. The process of equilibration is when people move from the equilibrium phase to the disequilibrium phase and back into equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLeod|first=S.

==Self-schema==
{{Main|Self-schema}}
Schemata about oneself are considered to be grounded in the present and based on past experiences. Memories are framed in the light of one's self-conception. For example, people who have positive self-schemata (i.e. most people) selectively attend to flattering information and selectively ignore unflattering information, with the consequence that flattering information is subject to deeper encoding, and therefore superior recall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sedikides | first1 = C. | last2 = Green | first2 = J. D. | year = 2000 | title = On the self-protective nature of inconsistency/negativity management: Using the person memory paradigm to examine self-referent memory | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 79 | issue = | pages = 906–92 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.6.906 | pmid=11138760}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when encoding is equally strong for positive and negative feedback, positive feedback is more likely to be recalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sanitioso | first1 = R. | last2 = Kunda | first2 = Z. | last3 = Fong | first3 = G. T. | year = 1990 | title = Motivated recruitment of autobiographical memories | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = 2| pages = 229–41 | pmid = 2213492 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, memories may even be distorted to become more favorable, for example, people typically remember exam grades as having been better than they actually were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bahrick | first1 = Harry P | last2 = Hall | first2 = Lynda K | last3 = Berger | first3 = Stephanie A | year = 1996 | title = Accuracy and Distortion in Memory for High School Grades | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 7 | issue = 5| pages = 265–271 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00372.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when people have negative self views, memories are generally biased in ways that validate the negative self-schema; people with low self-esteem, for instance, are prone to remember more negative information about themselves than positive information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Story | first1 = A. L. | year = 1998 | title = Self-esteem and memory for favorable and unfavorable personality feedback | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 51–64 | doi=10.1177/0146167298241004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, memory tends to be biased in a way that validates the agent's pre-existing self-schema.

There are three major implications of self-schemata. First, information about oneself is processed faster and more efficiently, especially consistent information. Second, one retrieves and remembers information that is relevant to one's self-schema. Third, one will tend to resist information in the environment that is contradictory to one's self-schema. For instance, students with a particular self-schema prefer roommates whose view of them is consistent with that schema. Students who end up with roommates whose view of them is inconsistent with their self-schema are more likely to try to find a new roommate, even if this view is positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Swann | first1 = W. B. | last2 = Jr | first2 =  | last3 = Pelham | first3 = B. W. | year = 2002 | title = Who wants out when the going gets good? Psychological investment and preference for self-verifying college roommates | url = | journal = Journal of Self and Identity | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 219–233 | doi=10.1080/152988602760124856}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of self-verification.

As researched by [[Aaron T. Beck|Aaron Beck]], automatically-activated negative self-schemata are a large contributor to depression. According to Cox, [[Lyn Yvonne Abramson|Abramson]], [[Patricia Devine|Devine]], and Hollon (2012), these self-schemata are essentially the same type of cognitive structure as stereotypes studied by prejudice researchers (e.g., they are both well-rehearsed, automatically activated, difficult to change, influential toward behavior, emotions, and judgments, and bias information processing).&lt;ref name="Cox et al. (2012)"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Cox |first1= William T. L. |last2= Abramson |first2= Lyn Y. |last3= Devine |first3= Patricia G. |last4= Hollon |first4= Steven D. |year= 2012 |title= Stereotypes, Prejudice, and Depression: The Integrated Perspective |journal= [[Perspectives on Psychological Science]] |volume= 7 |issue= 5 |pages= 427–449 |publisher= |doi= 10.1177/1745691612455204 |url= http://pps.sagepub.com/content/7/5/427.abstract |accessdate= |pmid=26168502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The self-schema can also be self-perpetuating. It can represent a particular role in society that is based on stereotype, for example: "If a mother tells her daughter she looks like a tom boy, her daughter may react by choosing activities that she imagines a tom boy would do. Conversely, if the mother tells her she looks like a princess, her daughter might choose activities thought to be more feminine." This is an example of the self-schema becoming self-perpetuating when the person at hand chooses an activity that was based on an expectation rather than their desires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychology Glossary|url=http://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition.php?term=Self-Schema|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schema therapy==
{{Main article|Schema therapy|List of maladaptive schemas}}
Schema therapy was founded by [[Jeffrey Young]] and represents a development of [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) specifically for treating [[personality disorders]].&lt;ref&gt;Young, J. E. (1999) Cognitive therapy for personality disorders: A schema-focused approach. (rev ed.) Sarasota, FL: Professional Resources Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="young"&gt;Young, Klosko &amp; Weishaar (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vScjGGgJEZgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Schema Therapy: A Practitioner's Guide]. New York: The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Early maladaptive schemata'' are described by Young as broad and pervasive themes or patterns made up of memories, feelings, sensations, and thoughts regarding oneself and one's relationships with others. They are considered to develop during childhood or adolescence, and to be dysfunctional in that they lead to self-defeating behavior. Examples include schemata of abandonment/instability, mistrust/abuse, emotional deprivation, and defectiveness/shame.&lt;ref name="young" /&gt;

Schema therapy blends CBT with elements of [[Gestalt therapy]], [[object relations]], [[Constructivism (psychological school)|constructivist]] and [[psychoanalytic]] therapies in order to treat the characterological difficulties which both constitute personality disorders and which underlie many of the chronic depressive or anxiety-involving symptoms which present in the clinic. Young said that CBT may be an effective treatment for presenting symptoms, but without the conceptual or clinical resources for tackling the underlying structures (maladaptive schemata) which consistently organize the patient's experience, the patient is likely to lapse back into unhelpful modes of relating to others and attempting to meet their needs. Young focused on pulling from different therapies equally when developing schema therapy. The difference between cognitive behavioral therapy and schema therapy is the latter "emphasizes lifelong patterns, affective change techniques, and the therapeutic relationship, with special emphasis on [[Schema therapy#Limited reparenting|limited reparenting]]".&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;{{cite web|last=Young|first=Jeffery|title=Schema Therapy|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/videos/4310804.aspx|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recommended this therapy would be ideal for clients with difficult and chronic psychological disorders. Some examples would be [[eating disorder]]s and personality disorders. He has also had success with this therapy in relation to depression and substance abuse.&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt;

The '''Singapore Red Cross''' (SRC) began on  30 September 1949 as part of the [[British Red Cross|British Red Cross Society]]. On 6 April 1973, the Singapore Red Cross was officially incorporated by the [[Politics of Singapore#Parliament|Parliament of Singapore]]. It was appointed as the National Blood Donor Recruiter by the [[Health Sciences Authority]] (HSA) in 2001.

==Organisation==
The governing of SRC is done by a 27- to 33-member council headed by a chairperson who is appointed by the president of the Republic of Singapore, the patron of the SRC. The council is responsible for pursuing the objectives of the SRC as laid down by the act of Parliament and its constitution. The council consults three appointed commissions providing expertise: the Finance Commission, the Legal Commission and the Medical Commission.

The general management is overseen by the executive committee, with operation responsibilities vested in the Red Cross Youth Division, the Adult Volunteer Division, the Chapters Division, and various standing committees, task forces and resource panels. Implementation of the policies and directives laid down by the council is done by the secretariat, which is headed by the secretary general. Volunteers and staff work together in organising and implementing the activities and programmes of the SRC.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

'''St. Vincent's Medical Center''' is a 397-bed acute care [[Catholicism|Catholic]] hospital in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[Connecticut]].

The hospital is now controlled by [[Ascension Health]], the nation's largest Catholic and largest nonprofit [[health system]], which is in turn controlled by several [[Religious orders#Catholic tradition|religious orders]], including the [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul]] which founded St. Vincent's Medical Center.

==Size and services==
The hospital has a medical staff of 450 physicians and has a total of more than 1,800 employees.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stvincents.org/aboutus/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902005712/http://www.stvincents.org/aboutus/ |archivedate=2006-09-02 |df= }} St. Vincent's Medical Center Web site, web page titled "About Us," accessed September 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:StVincentsHospitalBridgeportPostcard.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Early postcard picture of the hospital]]
The hospital was founded by the [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul|Daughters of Charity]] religious order and incorporated on May 19, 1903.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;[http://www.stvincents.org/about-us/history About Us: History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317035751/http://www.stvincents.org/about-us/history |date=2016-03-17 }},  St. Vincent's Medical Center (accessed March 27, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Its first building had 75 beds and was built at a cost of $250,000.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;  It opened its doors on June 28, 1905; more than 70 patients were treated by the end of that first day.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

On Easter Sunday, April 17, 1976, a new hospital building opened just behind the original one. That day, William J. Riordan, then president and chief executive officer of the hospital, directed the transfer of 209 patients to the new structure, a {{convert|440000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} building nearly twice the size of the old one.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

When the move was made to the new building, the hospital's name was changed from St. Vincent's Hospital to St. Vincent's Medical Center.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

A '''staff (head) gauge''' is calibrated scale which is used to provide a visual indication of [[liquid level]].  When used on an inclined or sloped surface, a staff gauge is usually calibrated so that the indicated level is the true vertical level.

Staff gauges are commonly installed at [[stream gauging]] stations to indicate the [[water stage]].  They are also used to indicate the [[water level]] (and hence flow rate) in open channel primary devices (flumes or weirs).

'''Street workout''' is a physical activity performed mostly in outdoor parks or public facilities. It originated in Ancient Greece, but became a popular movement in Russia, Eastern Europe, and the [[United States]], especially in [[New York City]], Baltimore's urban neighborhoods and Myanmar.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}  It has now spread all over the world. It is a combination of [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]], [[calisthenics]], and [[sports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CALISTHENICS - Street Workout Academy|url = http://streetworkoutacademy.com/calisthenics/#|website = Street Workout Academy|access-date = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=May 2017}} Street workout is a modern name for bodyweight workouts in outdoor parks. Street workout teams and organized competitions exist.

== Overview ==
A typical street workout routine often consists of [[physical exercises]] such as pull-ups, chin-ups, push-ups, dips, muscle-ups, sit-ups and squats. Street workout also involves some static (isometric) holds such as the human flag, front lever, back lever and planche.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Isometric exercises - Street Workouts|url = https://www.street-workouts.com/tag/isometric-exercises/|website = Street Workouts|access-date = 2016-01-15|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=May 2017}}

Street workout is divided in two main branches, the first one being strength training and the second dynamics. Strength training includes the isometric holds like: planche, front lever, back lever, etc. Also, strength training includes single arm pull ups, hefestos, muscle-ups and many others. Dynamics includes movements like 360s and its variations, switchblades, and an incredible variety of tricks developed by the athletes which are connected with other moves in order to create routines or sets.

Some of the main benefits of street workout activities are:

* It promotes healthy living, and a desirable physique can be attained with it;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Effect of Calisthenics Exercises at Various Intensity on Girl Students' Figure and Cardiorespiratory Functions--《Journal of Guangzhou Physical Education Institute》2003年06期|url = http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-GZTX200306018.htm|website = en.cnki.com.cn|access-date = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is a social event.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

At the beginning of the 21st century, [[bodyweight exercise|classic exercises]] were modified and combined with elements from other sports. The starting point of the whole was New York. Through the sports parks there, people could do their workout without fitness studios. Sport or workout parks consist mostly of different pull-up bars, bars and hammocks, so that training is mainly with one's own body weight.

Different groups developed their own style by combining classical calisthenics with exercises from gymnastics, break dance, hip hop and freerunning, or to develop new movements themselves. These groups presented videos of the novel form of calisthenics on the internet and thus triggered a regular boom, especially in Eastern Europe.

In 2011 the first World Championship for Calisthenics / Street Workout in Riga was held. The WSWCF is the World Street Workout and Calisthenics Federation. Since then, a world championship has been held every year.

Among the best-known representatives of the modern calisthenics are the groups Barentaz, Baristi, Barstarzz, Bar-Barians and Street Workout Ukraine, and individuals such as Hannibal for King and Frank Medrano.

==Basics of street workout==
A typical street workout routine&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.street-workouts.com/street-workout-programs/|title = Street Workout Programs|date = |access-date = 2016-01-16|website = Street Workouts|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of:
* [[Athletics (sport)|Athletics]] exercising – a system of exercises with various levels of exertion provided for health strengthening, development of strength and stamina, as well as for shaping an athletic constitution. Athletics exercising is used to increase strength level, develop physical shape and for rehabilitation.
* [[Isometric exercise]]s – a type of strength training whereby you hold a static position.
* [[Calisthenics]] (Kalestenos) – is a complex of many simple exercises which are performed using purely body weight. The aim of these exercises is to train muscular strength and to evolve comprehensive fitness.
* [[Calisthenics|Urban calisthenics]] – a form of body weight exercise performed with no or little apparatus. Individuals and/or groups train and exercise in urban areas and spaces. Advanced urban calisthenics skills include muscle ups, typewriter pull-ups and both front and back levers.
Street workouts are usually performed outdoor or in specifically designed street workout parks. A typical street workout park looks like a playground with a soft underground and consists of several bars, poles and other objects used for body weight exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://imgarcade.com/1/street-workout-park/|title = IMG Arcade - Street Workout Parks|date = |access-date = 2015-01-15|website = IMG Arcade|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Street workout Slovenija 3.JPG|thumb|Street workout in [[Slovenia]]]]
In street workout, people often create teams.

The '''Swedish Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency''' ({{lang-sv|Tandvårds- och läkemedelsförmånsverket}}, TLV) is an agency of the [[government of Sweden|Swedish government]]. It was founded in 2002, and is located on Fleminggatan in [[Stockholm]]. TLV's remit is to determine which pharmaceutical products, care-related medical devices and dental care procedures shall be subsidized by the state. It also determine retail margins for all pharmacies in Sweden, regulate the substitution of medicines at the pharmacies and supervise certain areas of the pharmaceutical market.

The fact that a central government agency has the decision on which pharmaceutical products and medical devices are to be subsidized is partly the result of a goal to make pharmaceutical benefits equal across Sweden.

It is the Government that decides, via the [[Ministry of Health and Social Affairs (Sweden)|Ministry of Health and Social Affairs]], which activities TLV shall undertake.

== Decisions on pharmaceutical subsidies ==
Pharmaceutical companies submit applications for their products to be subsidized and covered by the high-cost threshold, which TLV then makes a decision on. TLV also reviews the pharmaceuticals already covered by the high-cost threshold to see whether or not they should remain so. TLV bases its decisions on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act and takes into account three fundamental principles:
* the human value principle - the health care system should respect the equal value of all human life
* the need and solidarity principle - those with the most pressing medical needs should have more of the health care system's resources than other patient groups
* the cost-effectiveness principle - the cost of using a medicinal product should be reasonable from a medical, humanitarian and socioeconomic perspective

== Reference prices and high-cost threshold for dental care ==
TLV decides on the high-cost threshold for dental care and is responsible for determining which rules apply to dental care benefits. This involves deciding on what is to be subsidized and the reference prices that will apply to various dental treatments. The reference prices are used to calculate the subsidy the patient will receive for various treatments.

== Regulation of the pharmacy market ==
TLV is responsible for the regulations concerning how pharmacies exchange more expensive medicines for ones with the same active ingredients but a lower price; the generic exchange. The exchange results in price competition on pharmaceuticals, which frees up several billions of [[Swedish krona|kronor]] every year. TLV also determines the level of compensation that pharmacies receive for handling prescription products; the pharmacies' trade margin.

== Acts and ordinances that govern TLV's activities ==
In the matter of whether a medicine or medical device is to be covered by the high-cost threshold, TLV bases its decision on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act. For dental treatment, TLV works from the National Dental Care Subsidy Act.

TLV's own regulations [http://www.tlv.se/tlv/regelverk/foreskrifter/ TLVFS] are a supplement to the acts and ordinances that govern its activities.

== Collaboration with other actors ==
TLV collaborates with expert parties in the fields of medicine, dentistry and finance, as well as with county councils and other authorities active in the sector. There is also an extensive collaboration with various patient organisations and relevant trade organisations.

'''''The Free Market Cure''''' is a series of four short [[documentary film]]s, each of which tells a separate story about the failure of [[socialized medicine]] in each of the subjects' lives.  The films focus on the "[[Single-payer health care|single-payer]]" system as seen [[Health care in Canada|in Canada]], the likes of which has been advocated by other filmmakers, like [[Michael Moore]] in his film [[Sicko]].&lt;ref name=Hannity&gt;{{cite video |people= |date=29 March 2009 |title=Stuart Browning on Hannity's America |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_PK_YGt0Xw |format=flash video |medium=Television production |language= |trans_title= |publisher=Fox News |location= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=2 December 2011 |time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The series is meant to offer examples of cautionary tales which give cause to question the nature of the effectiveness of socialized medicine, particularly for individuals in the United States, whose government is gradually taking steps towards socializing medicine.&lt;ref name="market cure"&gt;{{cite web|last=Browning|first=Stuart|title=The Coming Death of Private Health Insurance|url=http://freemarketcure.com/|publisher=Free Market Cure|accessdate=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Content==
===''Uninsured in America''===
This film challenges what the filmmaker calls the "myth" of the suffering [[Health insurance coverage in the United States|uninsured in America]].  The film gives several pieces of evidence to support its claims.  The film claims that according to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]]'s 2007 data, 17 million (38%) of the approximately 45 million uninsured people in the U.S. live in households that have incomes greater than $50,000 per year, an amount that Devon Herrick of the [[National Center for Policy Analysis]] asserts is high enough that one could reasonably assume that the members of such a household should be able to afford some degree of health insurance coverage.&lt;ref name=Uninsured&gt;{{cite video |people= |date=26 May 2007 |title=Uninsured in America |url=http://freemarketcure.com/uninsuredinamerica.php |format=flash video |medium=Television production |language= |trans_title= |publisher=Free Market Cure |location= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=2 December 2011 |time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, 9 million (20%) of the uninsured, make more than $75,000 per year.  Additional demographics that make up a significant portion of the uninsured are the 18 million 18- to 34-year-olds that the film refers to as the "[[young invincibles]]", who spend four times as much money on alcohol, tobacco, entertainment, and dining out as on out-of-pocket healthcare, as well as the estimated 12 million [[Illegal immigration to the United States|undocumented immigrants in the U.S.]] that the film asserts receive healthcare without being insured.

In addition to the undocumented immigrants, citizens of other nations can request "compassionate entry" at the U.S. border, and be picked up by American ambulances and taken to American hospitals to receive treatment.

Herrick later says that uninsured people in the United States tend to receive 50-60% of the amount of care that insured people do.  He says that, effectively, the country is disincentivizing people from paying for their health insurance.

===''Two Women''===
The short follows a Canadian woman named Janice Fraser, who suffers from a bladder disease that has caused her bladder to be incapable of functioning properly, leading to near constant pain, frequent infections and accompanying high [[fevers]].  Janice needed an operation to insert an [[Sacral anterior root stimulator|electrical implant]] which would stimulate her bladder to function.  However, the Canadian specialist that consulted her explained that he was only allowed to perform 12 such operations per year, and that Janice was number 32 on the list and would likely have to wait nearly 3 years for the operation.  Janice and her mother offered to pay for the procedure to get it done more quickly, but were turned downed, as this is against Canadian law in the single-payer system.  They received little help from their parliamentary representative, nor from [[George Smitherman]], the Ontario Minister of Health, who the film describes as the "ultimate healthcare gatekeeper for the 12.5 million citizens of Ontario." 

Meanwhile, Susan Gapka, a [[Trans woman|male-to-female transsexual]], was able to enlist the help of Smitherman and the government in paying for her [[Sex reassignment surgery (male-to-female)|sex change operation]].

While she waited for her implant, Janice's constant infections eventually worsened to the point that necessitated the removal of her bladder completely in order to save her life.

===''A Short Course in Brain Surgery''===
Lindsay McCreith is a Canadian man who began having serious headaches and eventually suffered a seizure in January 2006.  His doctor suspected a brain tumor may be the cause, and recommended that Mr. McCreith get an [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], but was told that he would have to wait 4 months to get one.  Instead of waiting, private medical broker Rick Baker of Timely Medical Alternatives directed McCreith to get an MRI done in the U.S.; he was able to obtain an MRI in Buffalo, NY one day later, and learned that he did indeed have a golf ball-sized mass in his brain.  He proceeded with his medical treatments in the U.S. instead of waiting for it in Canada.  Baker says that they were able to compress the entire process, from MRI to consultation to biopsy to surgery to 4.5 weeks, and estimated that McCreith might have waited as long as 8 months in Canada - a potentially life-threateningly long wait.

McCreith attempted to gain reimbursement from the Canadian government of the $28,000 of medical expenses, but was denied because he didn't have the proper permission from the Canadian government to seek treatment abroad, a process of applications and appeals that can last 8 months.

Baker goes on to state that he is weary of the attempts by some Americans to duplicate the Canadian single-payer healthcare system, saying, "where will I send my clients...you people will be waiting two and three years for surgery, I'll have nowhere to send Canadians."

===''The Lemon''===
''The Lemon'' draws parallels between collectivized healthcare systems and the [[East Germany|East German]] [[Trabant]], a noisy, inefficient, underpowered automobile that remained a symbol of communist inefficiency and lack of ingenuity, mostly unchanged for nearly thirty years.  East Germans would typically have to wait 8 years to receive their own Trabant, an unappealing vehicle that lacked even basic features, like [[fuel gauge]]s. 

Like East Germans waiting for their Trabants, the movie implies, so too do Canadians like Shirley Healey wait for life-saving treatment.  Ms. Healey suffered from [[mesenteric ischemia]], and was unable to obtain prompt treatment, being told she'd have to wait about 2 months.  Her doctor, Robert W. Ellett, M.D., having seen another patient with the same condition die after waiting 3 months, urged Ms. Healey to seek medical treatment in the U.S.  Dr. Ellett explained that while there were a sufficient number of rooms in the local [[Intensive-care unit|ICU]] near her in [[British Columbia]] to receive her and other patients after surgery, many of them sit empty, because "they're not funded rooms."

Ms. Healey did pay for her operation in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and doctors there found that her artery was nearly completely blocked, a life-threatening condition that would have caused her intestines to [[Perfusion|perfuse]] inadequately, leading her to, in essence, starve to death.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1520">'''Water banking''' is the practice of forgoing water deliveries during certain periods, and “banking” either the right to use the forgone water in the future, or saving it for someone else to use in exchange for a fee or [[delivery in kind]].  It is usually used where there is significant storage capacity to facilitate such transfers of water.

In Spain water banking was given a legislative basis by the 1999 Water Law. The socialist government elected in 2004 planned to create a public water bank in each hydrographical [[River basin|basin]] as part of its AGUA programme.&lt;ref&gt;There are a total of 15 Basin Agencies in Spain for rivers that flow through more than one [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]].&lt;/ref&gt; This would allow historical water resources to be re-allocated according to "criteria of equity, efficiency, and sustainability".&lt;ref&gt;Font, N., and J. Subirats. 2010. Water management in Spain: the role of policy entrepreneurs in shaping change. [[Ecology and Society]] 15(2): 25. [online] URL: http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol15/iss2/art25/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, water banking is typically regulated and managed at the state level.

There is a long history of '''women in dentistry'''.

==Timeline==
===16th century===
* Unknown, 16th century: In an early copper engraving by [[Lucas Van Leyden]], a traveling dentist can be seen along with a woman acting as his assistant.&lt;ref name="smile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesmilecenterusa.com/blog/i-am-woman-hear-us-roar-and-see-us-do-teeth/#more-165 |title=

===19th century===
* 1814: [[Josephine Serre]] became the first dentist to receive a dentistry degree from the [[University of Tartu]].&lt;ref&gt;The National Archives of Estonia. Serre, J, student file nr EAA.402.2.23142&lt;/ref&gt; Her daughter [[Marie-Louis Serre]] graduated with a dentistry degree in 1829 from the same university.&lt;ref&gt;The National Archives of Estonia. Serre, Marie Louis student file nr. EAA.402.2.23143&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1852: [[Amalia Assur]] became the first female dentist in Sweden; she was given special permission from the [[:sv:Medicinalstyrelsen|Royal Board of Health]] (''Kongl.
