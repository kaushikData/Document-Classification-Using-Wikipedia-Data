The '''1947 Chatham Cup''' was the 20th annual nationwide knockout [[association football|football]] competition in [[New Zealand]].

The competition was run on a regional basis, with regional associations each holding separate qualifying rounds. Teams taking part in the final rounds are known to have included [[North Shore United]], [[Waterside (Wellington)]], [[Wanganui Old Boys]], [[St. Andrews FC|St. Andrews]] (Manawatu), [[Christchurch Technical|Technical Old Boys]] (Christchurch), [[Northern Hearts]] (Timaru), [[Mosgiel (soccer)|Mosgiel]], and [[Invercargill Thistle]].

==The 1947 final==
Bob Bolton, Toby Janes, and Tom Walker became the first players to play in four winning sides, having previously played for Waterside in the [[1938 Chatham Cup|1938]], [[1939 Chatham Cup|1939]], and [[1940 Chatham Cup|1940]] finals. Waterside dominated the final, but no goals were scored in the first period. In the second half, Mark Bell scored for Waterside, only to have Colin Bailey equalise before the final whistle. The only goal of extra time came through Waterside's Toby Janes.&lt;ref&gt;{{HiltonNZAssoc}} p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playoffs==
The Flames met their arch-rivals, the defending [[Stanley Cup]] champion [[Edmonton Oilers]] in the first round of the playoffs.  Despite finishing 20 points ahead of Edmonton in the regular season, the Flames fell to the Oilers in seven games.  Calgary's game six victory featured Theoren Fleury's memorable dash down the length of the ice following his overtime winning goal. {{As of|2015}}, it was the last time the two rivals met in the playoffs.

References to English [[cricket]] matches in the [[1727 English cricket season|1727 season]] between the [[Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond|2nd Duke of Richmond]] and Mr [[Alan Brodrick, 2nd Viscount Midleton|Alan Brodrick]] mention that they drew up '''Articles of Agreement''' between them to determine the rules that must apply in their contests. This may be the first time that rules were formally agreed, although rules as such definitely existed. In early times, the rules would be agreed orally and subject to local variations.&lt;ref name=LTL/&gt;

==The Articles==

[[Articles of Agreement]] by and between [[Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond|his Grace the Duke of Richmond]] &amp; [[Alan Brodrick, 2nd Viscount Midleton|Mr. Brodrick]] for two [[Cricket]] Matches concluded the Eleventh of July 1727:&lt;ref name=LTL/&gt; 

* Imprimis 'Tis by the aforesaid Parties agreed that the first Match shall be played some day of this Instant July in the county of [[Surrey|Surry]] (''sic''); the Place to be named by Mr Brodrick; the second match to be played in August next in the County of [[Sussex]], the Place to be named by the Duke of Richmond. 
* 2d: That the wickets shall be pitched in a fair &amp; even place, at twenty three yards distance from each other. 
* 3d: A Ball caught, cloathed or not cloathed, the Striker is out. 
* 4th: When a Ball is caught out, the Stroke counts nothing. 
* 5th: Catching out behind the Wicket allowed. 
* 6th: That 'tis lawfull (''sic'') for the Duke of Richmond to choose any Gamesters, who have played in either of His Grace's two last Matches with [[Sir William Gage, 7th Baronet|Sir William Gage]]; and that 'tis lawfull (''sic'') for Mr. Brodrick to choose any Gamesters within three Miles of [[Peper Harow|Pepperhara]], provided they actually lived there last [[Lady Day]]. 
* 7th: that twelve Gamesters shall play on each side. 
* 8th: that the Duke of Richmond &amp; Mr. Brodrick shall determine the Ball or Balls to be played with. 
* 9th: if any of the Gamesters shall be taken lame or sick after the Match is begun, their Place may be supplied by any one chose conformably to the sixth Article, or in Case that can not be done, the other side shall be obliged to leave out one of their Gamesters, whomsoever They please. 
* 10th: that each match shall be for twelve Guineas of each Side; between the Duke &amp; Mr. Brodrick. 
* 11th: that there shall be one Umpire of each side; &amp; that if any of the Gamesters shall speak or give of their opinion, on any Point of the Game, they are to be turned out, &amp; Voided in the Match; this not to extend to the Duke of Richmond &amp; Mr. Brodrick. 
* 12th: If any Doubt or Dispute arises on any of the aforemd (''sic'') Articles, or whatever else is not settled therein, it shall be determined by the Duke of Richmond &amp; Mr. Brodrick on their Honours; by whom the Umpires are likewise to be determined on any Difference between Them. 
* 13th: The Duke of Richmond's umpire shall pitch the Wickets when they play in Sussex; &amp; Mr. Brodrick's when they play in Surry (''sic''); and each of Them shall be obliged to conform Himself strictly to the Agreements contained in the second Article. 
* 14th: The Batt (''sic'') Men for every one they count are to touch the Umpires Stick. 
* 15th: that it shall not be lawfull (''sic'') to fling down the Wicket: &amp; that no Player shall be deemed out by any Wicket put down, unless with the Ball in Hand. 
* 16th: that both the Matches shall be played upon, and determined by, these Articles. 

The Articles were signed "Richmond" and "A. Brodrick".&lt;ref name=LTL/&gt;

==Comparison with 1744 Laws of Cricket==

Comparison of the Articles to the [[Laws of Cricket|Laws of 1744]], which were widely adopted at that time, reveal that:&lt;ref name=LTL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1701.html#1727 |title=From Lads to Lord's – 1727 |publisher=John Leach |date=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140522/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1701.html#1727 |archivedate=29 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* twelve a side, though this may include an umpire apiece, would have been difficult for Richmond if his matches against Gage were eleven a side and he fielded the same team in both matches. 
* the pitch length of 23 yards may be an error in the original document because the chain (22 yards) was definitely a used measure in 1727. 
* no run outs were allowed unless the fielder had the ball in his hand when breaking the wicket. 
* runs were only completed if the batsman touched the umpire's stick (which was probably a bat). 
* there is no mention of batsmen not being allowed to hit the ball twice.

In [[Harry Altham]]'s history, he discusses the possibility of a so-called "popping hole" being in use in the early 18th century but disclaims it as "a local and transitory variety of the regulation game". Altham pointed out, as evidence, that the fielder had to have the ball in his hand when breaking the wicket.&lt;ref&gt;Altham, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Derek Birley]] in his social history comments upon the significance of Lady Day in the articles as "the usual hiring day for new servants", given that Richmond and Brodrick had servants in their teams.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Richmond's regular players was [[Thomas Waymark]] whom he ostensibly employed as a groom.&lt;ref name=LTL/&gt;

[[Rowland Bowen]] in his history comments on the 23-yard pitch length and says the 1744 Laws "expressly refer to twenty-two yards".&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original document==
In [[Timothy J. McCann]]'s ''Sussex Cricket'', the original handwritten articles document is pictured in one of the plates. It is sourced to the West Sussex Record Office (WSRO) re a [[Goodwood House]] manuscript which the WSRO acquired in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;McCann, plate 1 facing page lxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6528">[[File:Oddrun Hokland, Dianne Gerace, Irina Press, Ulla Flegel 1964.jpg|thumb|250px|Hurdles event at the first Olympic women's pentathlon in 1964]]
[[File:Eero Lehtonen 1920.jpg|thumb|[[Eero Lehtonen]], Olympic pentathlon champion in 1920]]
In the [[sport of athletics]], '''[[pentathlon]]s''' have taken various forms over the history of the sport, typically incorporating five [[track and field]] events. The only version of the event to remain at a high level of contemporary competition is the [[women's indoor pentathlon]], which is present on the programme for the [[IAAF World Indoor Championships]].

==Olympic athletics pentathlon==
The athletics pentathlon featured on the [[Athletics at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games schedule]] in two separate periods. During the early history of the event, an [[Combined events at the Olympics|Olympic men's pentathlon]] was held and was present at the 1912, 1920 and 1924 games.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/sports/ATH/mens-pentathlon.html Athletics Men's Pentathlon Medalists]. Sports Reference. Retrieved on 2016-06-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The men's event was dropped, with the [[decathlon]] becoming the international standard. As women's events increasingly were contested internationally, the [[women's outdoor pentathlon]] was added and held for five straight editions from 1964 to 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/sports/ATH/womens-pentathlon.html Athletics Women's Pentathlon Medalists]. Sports Reference. Retrieved on 2016-06-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[women's heptathlon]] superseded that event at international level in the early 1980s.

==Women's pentathlon==
{{main|Women's pentathlon}}
The [[International Women's Sports Federation]] was established in 1921 and the first reported women's pentathlon was in the [[1922 Women's Olympiad]] in [[Monte Carlo]].&lt;ref name="Matthews2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Matthews|first=Peter|title=Historical Dictionary of Track and Field|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=dQFHe9RwE0wC&amp;pg=PA164|accessdate=11 May 2016|year=2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810867819|pages=164–5|chapter=Pentathlon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events were 60&amp;nbsp;m, 300&amp;nbsp;m, high jump, [[Two-handed throwing|two-hand]] javelin, and two-hand shot.&lt;ref name="Matthews2012"/&gt; In the late 1920s, the events were: shot and long jump on the first day, and 100&amp;nbsp;m, high jump, and javelin on the second day.&lt;ref name="Matthews2012"/&gt; The first world record recognised by the [[IAAF]] was set at the [[1934 Women's World Games]] by [[Gisela Mauermayer]].&lt;ref name="Matthews2012"/&gt; Prior to Olympic incorporation, the women's pentathlon featured at the [[AAA Championships]], [[USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships]] and the [[Soviet Athletics Championships]] from the 1950s onwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gbrathletics.com/bc/bc3.htm British Athletics Championships 1945–1959].

==Youth athletics==
The outdoor pentathlon is in common usage at [[youth athletics|lower age categories of the sport]], allowing for easier training and event scheduling, and avoiding over-training of young athletes. For example, the lower division of the English Schools Combined Events Championships has pentathlons for both boys and girls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gbrathletics.com/bc/eso.htm English Schools Championships]. GBR Athletics. Retrieved on 2016-06-18.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[high school athletics]] in North America, boys' and girls' pentathlons are held, consisting of the [[sprint hurdles]], long jump, shot put, high jump, and an [[800 metres|800&amp;nbsp;m run]] ([[1500 metres|1500&amp;nbsp;m run]] for men).  The pentathlon is used because it is less stressful on the athletes than a full multi and because many high school meets only last one day, it allows the event to be contested in the time limit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brianmac.co.uk/pent/index.htm Pentathlon]. Brian Mac. Retrieved on 2016-06-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Throws pentathlon==
{{main|Throws pentathlon}}
Less common, but standardised internationally is the [[throws pentathlon]]. This contains field [[throwing events]] only: [[hammer throw]], [[shot put]], [[discus throw]], [[javelin throw]], and [[weight throw]]. Although it does not have a position in high-profile global athletics competitions, it is present on the programme for the [[World Masters Athletics Championships]] for both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-masters-athletics.org/records/outdoor-men WMA Championships Records Men] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903223836/http://www.world-masters-athletics.org/records/outdoor-men |date=2011-09-03 }}.

'''Balmoor''' (also known as '''Balmoor Stadium''') is an [[association football]] [[stadium|ground]] in the [[Scotland|Scottish]] town of [[Peterhead]], [[Aberdeenshire]]. It is home to [[Scottish League One|Scottish League]] Two side [[Peterhead F.C.|Peterhead]]. The stadium has a capacity of {{SPFL-stadiums|peterhead}}&lt;ref name="capacity"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spfl.co.uk/clubs/peterhead/ |title=Peterhead Football Club|publisher=Scottish Professional Football League |accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; spectators of which 1,000 can be seated.&lt;ref name = "BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18735027|title=Rangers: Life in Scottish Division Three beckons|accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The record attendance at Balmoor is 4,855, for a [[Scottish Football League Third Division]] match against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] on 20 January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rangers.co.uk/match/match-reports/item/3172-peterhead-0-1-rangers|title=Peterhead   0 - 1   Rangers|publisher=Rangers FC|date=20 January 2013|accessdate=20 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107232633/http://www.rangers.co.uk/match/match-reports/item/3172-peterhead-0-1-rangers|archivedate=7 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This broke the previous record crowd of 4,505.

The nearest railway station to Balmoor is [[Aberdeen railway station]], which is {{convert|32|mi}} away.&lt;ref name = "guide"/&gt; This is the greatest distance between a senior league football ground and its nearest railway station in [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref name = "guide"/&gt; Balmoor is located on the [[A982 road]], just north of Peterhead town centre.&lt;ref name = "guide"/&gt;

A '''bell [[tent]]''' is a human shelter for [[Dwelling|inhabiting]], traveling or leisure. The design is a simple structure, supported by a single central pole, covered with cotton [[canvas]]. The stability of the tent is reinforced with tension by [[Guy-wire|guy ropes]] connected around the top of the walls and being held down by pegs around the circumference to the ground. It has a circular floor plan of some 10&amp;nbsp;ft and larger.&lt;br/&gt;
The multiple sizes of bell tents can be suited to their use or preference and most have a spacious interior, with room to sleep a number of people.

==History==
Indigenous people from around the world have used canvas as a natural breathable material, with suitable properties for use in the elements. Canvas is durable and versatile. Today's modern canvas can be [[waterproof]], [[Rot-proof|mildew resistant]], and [[flame retardant]].

A version of the bell tent, the [[sibley tent]] was invented by [[Henry Hopkins Sibley]], who had studied the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[tipi]] during the expeditions he carried out in the [[American Old West]]. He patented his tent design in 1858.

The bell tent is characteristically differentiated from the sibley tent by its walls, raised larger entrance and guy ropes, without the extendable tripod or smoke hole, which were characteristics of the tipi.

Bell tents have become the classic type of accommodation used in modern luxury camping, or [[glamping]], often kitted out with electricity hook-up, double beds, carpeting, refrigeration units and even coffee machines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dorsetcountryholidaysandevents.co.uk/bell-tent-glamping.php Bell Tent glamping in Dorset]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australian rules football]], the '''followers''' are the players in the three positions- '''[[Ruckman (Australian rules football position)|ruckman]]''', '''ruck rover''', and '''rover'''. These three players are known as followers because they have traditionally been used as players that follow the ball all around the ground, as opposed to playing in a set position. In recent years, there has been a decreased emphasis on set positions in Australian football. Followers still cover more ground than any other player on the field.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Ruckman==
The ruckman's job is to contest with the opposing ruckman at centre-bounces that take place at the start of each quarter or after each goal, and at stoppages (i.e., boundary throw ins, ball ups). The ruckman usually uses his height (typically players are over 195&amp;nbsp;cm tall) to palm/tap the ball down so that a ruck rover or rover can run onto it.

Notable ruckmen in Australian football over the years include:

==Ruck rover==
Before the 1950s, the role of the ruck-rover was known as the ''follower''. His role was to assist the ruckman and rover at centre bounces by blocking and shepherding them from opposition players.&lt;ref name="Pascoe-p41"&gt;Pascoe, 1995, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; This position disappeared in the 1950s with the success of [[Ron Barassi, Jr.]] in a role designated for him by Melbourne coach [[Norm Smith]].&lt;ref name="Pascoe-p41" /&gt; The closest equivalent of the follower position in today's game is known as a [[Australian rules football positions#Taggers|tagger]].&lt;ref name="Pascoe-p41" /&gt;

The ruck rover's job is to be directly beneath the flight of the ball when a ruckman taps the ball down, allowing an easy take away, or clearance, from a stoppage. Typically players are not as tall as the ruckman, typically ranging from 170–190&amp;nbsp;cm in height.

Notable followers and ruck-rovers in Australian football over the years include:
* [[Ron Barassi, Jr.]] ({{AFL Mel}} and {{AFL Car}}, 1953-1969)&lt;ref name="Pascoe-p41" /&gt;

==Rover==
The rover is a player who lurks around centre bounces and stoppages to receive the ball from a ruck rover and complete a clearance. Rovers are typically the smallest player on the ground.

Notable rovers in Australian football over the years include:
* [[Harry Collier]] ({{AFL Col}}, 1926-1940),&lt;ref name="Pascoe-p40"&gt;Pascoe, 1995, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Brownlow Medallist 1930

'''Madison Square Garden''' (1879-1890) was an [[arena]] in [[New York City]] at the northeast corner of [[26th Street (Manhattan)|East 26th Street]] and [[Madison Avenue (Manhattan)|Madison Avenue]] in [[Manhattan]].  The first venue to use that name, it [[seating capacity|seated]] 10,000 spectators. It was replaced with a [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|new building]] on the same site.

==Origins==
[[File:Barnums Hippodrome.jpg|thumb|right|287px|[[P. T. Barnum]]'s Roman Hippodrome, a predecessor to Madison Square Garden]]
The site upon which Madison Square Garden was eventually established was originally occupied by a small passenger depot of the [[New York and Harlem Railroad]]. The site was vacated by the railroad in 1871 when it moved operations uptown to 42nd Street.&lt;ref name=ballp&gt;[http://hockey.ballparks.com/NHL/NewYorkRangers/1stoldindex.htm "Madison Square Garden I"] on Ballpark.com&lt;/ref&gt; The site was vacant until 1874 when it was leased to [[P. T. Barnum]] who converted it into an open oval arena {{convert|270|ft|m}} long, with seats and benches in banks, which he named the ''Great Roman Hippodrome''&lt;ref name=ballp /&gt; where he presented circuses and other performances. The roofless building was also called ''Barnum's Monster Classical and Geological Hippodrome'' and measured {{convert|420|ft|m}} by {{convert|200|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=ballp /&gt;

In 1876 the open-air arena was leased to band leader [[Patrick Gilmore]], who renamed it ''Gilmore's Garden'' and presented flower shows, [[beauty contests]], music concerts, [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]] and [[revival meetings]], walking marathons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gopnik|first1=Adam|authorlink=Adam Gopnik|title=Heaven’s Gaits|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/01/heavens-gaits|accessdate=29 August 2014|newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]|date=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first [[Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show]], called at the time (1877) the "First Annual N.Y. Bench Show."&lt;ref name=ballp /&gt; Gilmore also presented [[boxing]], but since competitive boxing matches were technically illegal at the time, he called them "exhibitions" or "illustrated lectures."&lt;ref name=ballp /&gt;

The next to lease the space was W. M. Tileston, who was an official of the dog show. He attempted to attract a more genteel crowd with [[tennis]], a riding school and an ice carnival;&lt;ref name=ballp /&gt; the arena had one of the first indoor ice rinks in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/ice-rink1.html|title=How Ice Rinks Work|author=Russell-Ausley, Melissa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming==
After the death of [[Commodore Vanderbilt]], who owned the site, his grandson [[William Kissam Vanderbilt]] took back control and announced on May 31, 1879 that the arena was to be renamed "Madison Square Garden."&lt;ref name=ballp /&gt; Vanderbilt presented sporting events such as indoor [[track and field]] meets, a convention of [[Elks]], the [[Horse show|National Horse Show]] and more boxing, including some bouts featuring [[John L. Sullivan]], who began a four-year series of exhibitions in July 1882, drawing over-capacity crowds.&lt;ref name=ballp /&gt; P.T. Barnum also used the Garden to exhibit [[Jumbo]], the elephant he had bought from the [[London Zoo]]; he drew sufficient business to recover the $10,000 pricetag.&lt;ref name=ballp /&gt;

Another notable use of the first Garden was as a [[velodrome]], an oval bicycle racing track with banked curves.  At the time, bicycle racing was one of the biggest sports in the country. "[T]he top riders [were] among the sports stars of their day. The bike races at Madison Square Garden were all the rage around the turn of the 20th century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/29/nyregion/thecity/29gear.html| title =Unstoppable |last=Weyland|first=Jocko|date=2007-04-29|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madison Square Garden was the most important bicycle racing track in the United States and the Olympic discipline known as the [[Madison (cycling)|Madison]] is named after the original Garden.

However, the roofless Garden was hot in the summertime and freezing in the wintertime. Vanderbilt eventually sold what ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' called his "patched-up, grimy, drafty, combustible old shell" to a syndicate that included [[J. P. Morgan]], [[Andrew Carnegie]], [[James Stillman]] and [[W. W. Astor]], who closed it to build a new arena designed by noted architect [[Stanford White]].  Demolition began in July 1889,&lt;ref name=ballp /&gt; and the [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|second Madison Square Garden]], which cost more than a half-million dollars to build, opened on June 6, 1890. It was demolished in 1926, and the [[New York Life Building]], designed by [[Cass Gilbert]] and completed in 1928, replaced it on the site.

It was also the host venue of the [[Sultan Ibragimov]] versus [[Evander Holyfield]] World Heavyweight Title Fight, on October 13, 2007. On 23 January 2008, [[PBC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]] hosted a [[EuroLeague]] [[Euroleague 2007-08 Regular Season Group A|regular season]] game against [[Saski Baskonia|TAU Cerámica]] in the arena, in front of a near sellout 13,000 attendance crowd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euroleague.net Euroleague.net]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229045851/http://www.euroleague.net/ |date=December 29, 2016 }}, [http://www.euroleague.net/main/results/showgame/report?gamecode=146 GAME REPORT CSKA Moscow 70 -62 Tau Ceramica]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818080013/http://www.euroleague.net/main/results/showgame/report?gamecode=146 |date=August 18, 2016 }}, January 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Megasport Arena was rumored to be the venue for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009|54th Eurovision Song Contest]] in 2009, but instead the competition was held at the [[Olympic Stadium (Moscow arena)|Olympic Indoor Arena]], in Moscow. On March 24, 2011, the International Skating Union (ISU) relocated the [[2011 World Figure Skating Championships]] to the Megasport Arena, in Moscow.&lt;ref name=bbc324&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/winter_sports/9435021.stm | title = Moscow to host of Figure Skating World Championships  | last =  | first =  |date = March 24, 2011 | work = [[BBC News]]  | accessdate = March 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision followed the cancellation of the championships in Tokyo, Japan, due to the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. The championships were staged from April 24 to May 1, 2011. The [[2011 European Curling Championships]] were also hosted at the arena, in December 2011.

In 2016, the arena became the home arena of the [[VTB United League]] club [[PBC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]], for [[EuroLeague]] games.

[[Mental health]] refers to a person's mental state, well-being,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = the definition of mental health|url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mental+health|website = Dictionary.com|accessdate = 2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ability to cope with the daily stresses of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - Mental Health Basics - Mental Health|url = https://www.cdc.gov/mentalhealth/basics.htm|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Good mental health also means that one has the ability to be mentally resilient, have a good life balance, having an absence of [[mental disorder]]s and the ability to enjoy life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Life skills and mental health - ProQuest|url = http://search.proquest.com/openview/7b94b087f3c54c7872f86ff0cd41d98f/1?pq-origsite=gscholar|website = search.proquest.com|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elite athletes such as those competing in the [[Australian Football League]](AFL), are at higher risk of developing a mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, social anxiety, panic attacks and eating disorders.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = BMC Psychiatry {{!}} Full text {{!}} Barriers and facilitators to mental health help-seeking for young elite athletes: a qualitative study|url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/12/157|website = www.biomedcentral.com|accessdate = 2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 16–34 years olds are also in the high risk category, which is the average age of a football player and extends to those who are being [[Australian Football League draft|drafted]],&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Manage Your Mind Wellbeing Program|url = http://www.aflplayers.com.au/article/inside-football-feature-manage-your-mind-wellbeing-program/|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; this puts AFL players in both high risk categories.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://ac.els-cdn.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/S1440244014000759/1-s2.0-S1440244014000759-main.pdf?_tid=e074c530-5122-11e5-89ad-00000aacb35e&amp;acdnat=1441164774_11d2198e0d4052867715256b5f24b9b8|title = The mental health of Australian elite athletes|author1=Gulliver.

== Society and culture ==

AFL players are often forced to conform to the norms but also have high expectations placed on them such as extraordinary behavior, appearance and performance.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1469029215000758|title=A subculture of mental toughness in an Australian Football League club|first1=Tristan J.|last1=Coulter|first2=Clifford J.|last2=Mallett|first3=Jefferson A.|last3=Singer|date=1 January 2016|publisher=|journal=Psychology of Sport and Exercise|volume=22|pages=98–113|doi=10.1016/j.psychsport.2015.06.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are perceived to be tough, and mentally tough, if they conform to these norms and display qualities such as having self-belief, mental and emotional resilience and a tough attitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Towards an Understanding of Mental Toughness in Australian Football|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10413200801998556|journal = Journal of Applied Sport Psychology|date = 2008-07-18|issn = 1041-3200|pages = 261–281|volume = 20|issue = 3|doi = 10.1080/10413200801998556|first = Daniel F.|last = Gucciardi|first2 = Sandy|last2 = Gordon|first3 = James A.|last3 = Dimmock}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also expected to be extremely masculine and not show signs of emotional stress and upset, if they show these signs they are then perceived as weak and tend to be dropped from the team or squad.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Usually only 35% of elite athletes will seek help from a professional as they tend to believe they are alright and can get better by themselves. They tend to be worried about others finding out about these issues as there seems to be a [[social stigma]] that they are weak if they suffer from any of these problems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The masculine stereotypes associated with AFL players is a potential barrier for players to come out and talk about their mental health problems.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Proactive approach to mental health|url = http://www.aflplayers.com.au/article/proactive-approach-to-mental-health/|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a player exaggerates their negative performances or situations it often leads to mental health problems.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Media has a big role in all of this. Players are constantly scrutinized about performance, the way they act, the way they look, etc., and the players then see this and tend to dwell on all of the negatives. This messes with the players psychologically and places an added pressure on them to perform and act better.  
[[File:Barry hall.jpg|thumb|Barry Hall]]

== History ==
There have been a few cases made public of AFL players suffering from mental health problems. In 2015 it was noted that [[Mitch Clarke]] from [[Geelong Football Club]] has been suffering from mental health problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/mitch-clark-dealing-with-ongoing-mental-health-issues-chris-scott-20150508-ggxr89.html|title = The Age|last = Pierk &amp; Niall|date = 2015|work = |access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; When questioned it was not spoken about very much and all quite hidden. He was withdrawn from the team even after a huge win which sparked conversation in the community but Mitch Clarke never spoke much about it.

Also in 2015 [[Adam Goodes]] took a week off training and playing because of the 'emotional toll'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.smh.com.au/afl/sydney-swans/sydney-swans-veteran-adam-goodes-will-not-play-this-weekend-against-adelaide-20150729-gin6du.html|title = Sydney Morning Herald|last = Wu|first = Andrew|date = 2015|work = |access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; he was put under during the season, receiving boos and racist comments from the crowd. He was also under analyses by the media which was all too much for him so it led to him taking time off and away from the sport.

[[Barry Hall]] was also seen to be suffering mental health problems, admitting he had been suffering depression throughout his AFL career and that he "had nothing to get out of bed for" (Hall, 2011). [[Simon Hogan]] was another player who came out about their depression and had contemplated killing himself during his career. [[Lance Picioane]] who played for Adelaide, Hawthorn and the Kangaroos said how he struggled to understand that he was actually suffering from depression and that it wasn't him just feeling a little bit down.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

[[Wayne Schwass]], [[Nathan Thompson (Australian footballer)|Nathan Thompson]] and [[Heath Black]] are other players who have come out and spoken about their struggle with anxiety and depression throughout their football careers.

== Causes ==
There are many factors that lead to bad mental health in AFL players.

=== Pressures and expectations ===

Pressure to win and to perform well week in and week out contributes to the bad mental state of some AFL players. Having such a heavy burden on their shoulders impacts their state of mind, and when they do under perform this can negatively affect a players mental health.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There are also pressures from society to act professionally and look the part,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; be fit, strong and well groomed. They have high expectations on them as players and are encouraged to be the ideal male who is masculine, athletic, strong etc.. and this pressure is coming from within the club as well.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If a player has a bad game it is written all over the media and it is hard for it not to affect the player emotionally.

=== Injuries ===

[[Injury]] and the risk of injury also contributes to this lack of mental health because if a player does become injured they will have a lower or no income and their position in next season is on the rocks so knowing this makes them stress. Being injured also means they cannot exercise as much and this sudden drop in physical activity levels makes the player more likely to become anxious or depressed as physical activity is a mood enhancer.&lt;ref&gt;Eriksson, S., &amp; Gard, G. (2011). Physical exercise and depression. ''Physical Therapy Reviews'', ''16''(4), 261-268. doi:10.1179/1743288X11Y.0000000026&lt;/ref&gt; On average a total of 40 players miss a total of 142 games a season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Epidemiology of injuries in the Australian Football League, seasons 1997–2000|journal = British Journal of Sports Medicine|date = 2002-02-01|issn = 0306-3674|pmc = 1724448|pmid = 11867491|pages = 39–44|volume = 36|issue = 1|doi = 10.1136/bjsm.36.1.39|first = J|last = Orchard|first2 = H|last2 = Seward}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a huge number and a constant lingering concern for players. The whole process of finding out about their injury to [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation]] and returning to the sport is an emotional roller-coaster for players as they have strong negative feelings when they find out about their diagnosis, to struggling through rehab then having the pressure to perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Psychological Impact of Long-Term Injury on Australian Football League Players|url = http://www.tandfonline.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/doi/full/10.1080/10413200.2014.897269#abstract|doi = 10.1080/10413200.2014.897269| journal=Journal of Applied Sport Psychology|volume=26|issue=4|pages = 377|year=2014|last1 = Ruddock-Hudson|first1 = Mandy|last2 = o'Halloran|first2 = Paul|last3 = Murphy|first3 = Greg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Head injuries in the Australian Football League|Head injuries]] may affect the mind more directly.

[[File:Afl ruckwork.jpg|thumb|Australian football [[Ruckman (Australian rules football)|ruck contests]], a common cause of injury]]

=== Other ===

The pressure of location and relocation is another toll on players. When [[Australian Football League draft|drafting]] comes around young players are unsure what team will draft them.Having to relocate their entire lives to go train and play with a team is such a stress on the young players and can cause anxiety.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Starting in a new team with new people, a new training structure and lifestyle can be a big shock to some players and they may experience social anxiety and exclusion which could lead to negative thoughts.

During the week each player is critiqued by coaching staff to see where they can improve in their game, but constantly being under the pump can be mentally exhausting for players.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The environment in which they live and train in impacts a players mental health as it can affect the mental resilience which they build and creates their personality which could affect if they fit in or not.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It also affects their natural resiliency to tough situations and how they handle things that come their way. If they do not have support from either family or friends everything can fall apart.

== Prevention and treatment ==
Prevention, intervention and treatment for mental health has been neglected for quite some time and has never been a high priority to create groups to support this.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;World, H. O. (2010). Mental Health Development : Targeting People with Mental Health Conditions as a Vulnerable Group. Albany, NY, USA: World Health Organization (WHO). Retrieved from http://www.ebrary.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 844 000 people commit suicide every year&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; in the world so it is vital something is done to help the AFL players. It is shown that organised programs are one of the most effective ways to help treat mental illnesses such as depression and having a full-time staff member to facilitate this would be a greater benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Should Mental Health Interventions Be Locally Grown or Factory-Farmed?|url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org.ipacez.nd.edu.au/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.13010043|journal = American Journal of Psychiatry|date = 2013-01-01|pmc = 4249622|pmid = 23545790|volume = 170|issue = 4|pages = 362–5|doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.13010043|first = Gregory E.|last = Simon|first2 = Evette J.|last2 = Ludman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== AFL mental health framework ===

AFL has put a framework in place to ensure the best mental health of the players and it encourages early identification and intervention. They hope to remove any stigmas from society and the people involved in AFL about mental health disorders. They aim to educate their players on mental health issues with online, face to face and peer to peer programs. They are hoping to create a space where the industry is able to recognize symptoms and to aid in early intervention.

=== "Manage Your Mind" well-being program ===

This is a program set up by the [[AFL Players Association]], teaching players about the signs and symptoms of mental illness so they can better understand the difference between feeling a bit sad one day and depression. Through a three session course players are exposed to realizing their own values, different mental health stories and how these both relate back to their lives and then being able to change anything they aren't happy with. They are also taught about different emotions and ways to surface them and talk about them to other people.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== AFL Players Association programs ===

The AFL Players Association also have two other programs similar to the Manage Your Mind Well-being Program. Practical Mindfulness is another which is a hands on course that helps the players to be able to manage stress and build resilience to all the negative influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mind Mechanics|url = http://www.aflplayers.com.au/article/wellbeing-programs/|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Team wise is the third program they offer which is targeted  at coaching staff, captains and influential players to develop skills in aiding other players to speak up and to be positive role models.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18332">The '''National Lacrosse League dispersal draft''' is a meeting where the general managers of [[National Lacrosse League]] teams choose players from teams that are ceasing operations. The NLL has seen a lot of team changes over the years (the [[1993 MILL season|1993 season]] was the last time the league had no team changes over the previous season&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nllblog.com/2010/12/stability-in-nll.html|work=The NLL Blog|last=Perrow|first=Graeme|date=December 16, 2010|accessdate=2011-09-09|title=Stability in the NLL}}&lt;/ref&gt;), so dispersal drafts have been commonplace. Recent dispersal drafts have occurred in 2011 ([[Boston Blazers]]), 2010 ([[Orlando Titans]]), 2009 ([[Portland LumberJax]]), 2008 ([[Arizona Sting]], [[Chicago Shamrox]]), 2007 ([[Arizona Sting]], [[Boston Blazers]]), 2005 ([[Anaheim Storm]]), 2004 ([[Vancouver Ravens]]), 2003 ([[Ottawa Rebel]]), and 2002 ([[Montreal Express|Montréal Express]]).

==2008 Draft results==
There were two separate dispersal drafts in 2008. In June, the [[Arizona Sting]] announced that they would not be returning as promised after they decided not to play in the 2008 season. Then just weeks before the 2009 season started, the [[Chicago Shamrox]] suspended operations, requiring a second draft.

'''Newcastle Racecourse''' is a [[horse racing]] course located at [[Gosforth Park]] near [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[England]], owned by [[Arena Racing Company]]. It stages both [[Flat racing|flat]] and [[National Hunt racing]], with its biggest meeting being the [[Northumberland Plate]] held annually in June.

==History==
Horseracing began in the North East over 350 years ago, beginning in [[Killingworth]] in the early 17th century. A King's Plate for 5 year olds, run in 3 mile heats was instigated by [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] in 1753.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Whyte |first=James Christie |authorlink= |title=History of the British turf, from the earliest period to the present day, Volume I | url=http://openlibrary.org/books/OL6544990M/History_of_the_British_turf |accessdate=1 May 2013 |year=1840 |publisher=H. Colburn |location=[[London]]|page=402}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Town Moor, Newcastle upon Tyne|Town Moor]] hosted the first recorded Northumberland Plate in 1833 and did so until 1881 when the race transferred to [[Gosforth Park|High Gosforth Park]]. 1882 saw the first running of the Plate at Gosforth Park with a new flat and chase course, new stand and stabling for 100 horses.

In April, 2002 the [[Scotland|Scottish]] businessman [[David Williamson (businessman)|David Williamson]] joined Newcastle Racecourse as managing director and during a six-year period he transformed their fortunes and helped boost turnover from £2.5m to £6.5m. The Northumberland Plate weekend now brings in £30m to the regional economy and he also introduced Ladies' Day which now attracts over 15,000 racegoers. In April, 2008 he was headhunted by [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and appointed Executive Director (Operations).&lt;ref&gt;

In December 2013 Newcastle's owners, [[Arena Racing Company]], announced plans to change the flat turf course into an all-weather track while retaining a turf jump racing course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/horse-racing/25266074 |title=Newcastle Racecourse plans all-weather floodlit track |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new tapeta track was completed in early 2016 with the first meeting held on 17 May of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newcastle-racecourse.co.uk/about-us/news-details.php?newsid=270|title=News {{!}} Newcastle Racecourse Racing &amp; Events|website=www.newcastle-racecourse.co.uk|access-date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3525">The '''Professional Cricketers' Association''' is the representative body of past and present [[first-class cricket]]ers in England and Wales, founded in 1967 by former England fast bowler [[Fred Rumsey]] (when it was known as the Cricketers' Association).  In the 1970s, the PCA arranged a standard employment contract and minimum wage for professional cricketers in first-class cricket in England and Wales.

==History==
Former Somerset and England fast bowler Fred Rumsey founded the Professional Cricketers’ Association in 1967.&lt;ref name = arlott/&gt; Before the creation of the PCA English cricket players had little to no say in the administration of the game in England and Wales. Rumsey's creation of a players union was recognised when the PCA recently appointed him honorary life founder member and a vice-president.

[[John Arlott]] became the first president in 1968. ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'' noted that his &lt;blockquote&gt;"democratic views and wise counsel earned him much respect in the cricket world and among the players. His moderation and tact helped in some tight corners, notably at the time of the [[World Series Cricket|Packer Affair]], when he strove to keep the Cricketers' Association neutral."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/8522.html|title=Profile: John Arlott|work=Wisden Cricketer's Almanack obituary|publisher=CricInfo|accessdate=29 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Mike Edwards (cricketer)|Mike Edwards]] was appointed the first treasurer in 1968, and was elected chairman in 1970. He subsequently resigned the post following a majority decision by the membership to accept a donation from the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] in [[apartheid]]-era South Africa.&lt;ref name = arlott/&gt;

Harold Goldblatt is a chartered accountant who was asked by Arlott to assist the PCA. It was he who negotiated the minimum wage, the standard contract and insurance cover for all players.{{cn|date=June 2013}} He utilized the over-rate fines to form the Cricket Association Charity, for the benefit of former County players who had fallen on hard financial times, and the charity has helped over 80 such players to date. He was appointed senior vice president for life in appreciation of the 30 years of service he gave to the association.{{cn|date=January 2014}} In an article about the PCA originally published in the March 1979 issue of ''[[The Cricketer]]'', Arlott wrote that Goldblatt was "invaluable as financial adviser".&lt;ref name = arlott&gt;''[[John Arlott|Arlott]] on Cricket'', edited by [[David Rayvern Allen]], Fontana/Collins, 1985 edition, {{ISBN|0-00-637007-1}}, pp217-220.&lt;/ref&gt;

The PCA holds an annual awards dinner, with the Reg Hayter Cup for the [[PCA Player of the Year]] award being one of the more prestigious awards in the domestic game.

The '''Sussex Senior Cup''' is an annual [[association football]] knock-out cup competition for men's football clubs in the English county of [[Sussex]] and is the county senior cup of the [[Sussex County Football Association|Sussex FA]].  Its official name is the '''Sussex Senior Challenge Cup'''.  For sponsorship purposes, from 2012 to 2018 it is also known as the '''Parafix Sussex Senior Cup''' after a new three-year sponsorship deal was agreed in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sussexexpress.co.uk/sport/local-football/parafix-agree-new-deal-to-sponsor-sussex-senior-cup-1-6914679|title=Parafix Agree New Deal to Sponsor Sussex Senior Cup|publisher=Sussex Express|date=20 August 2015|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First played in the 1882-83 season, shortly after the founding of the [[Sussex County Football Association]] in 1882, the first winners of the cup were Brighton Rangers. Other teams who won the cup in its early history are [[Burgess Hill Town F.C.|Burgess Hill]], [[Lancing College]] and [[Eastbourne Town F.C.|Eastbourne]].

The team with most title wins in the competition's history are [[Worthing F.C.|Worthing]] but teams who have been successful in the cup recently are Sussex's two [[Football League]] teams, [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] and [[Crawley Town F.C.|Crawley Town]]. [[Bognor Regis Town]] won the competition a record five times in succession between 1980 and 1984.

Winners also qualify for a place in the Sussex FA Community Shield match, traditionally the opening match each season in Sussex football. [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]] are the current holders of the Sussex Senior Cup, having beaten [[Crawley Town F.C.|Crawley Town]] 2–1 in the 2018 final in a repeat of the 2017 final.

==History==
Shortly after the [[Sussex County Football Association]] was founded in 1882 the inaugural competition of the Sussex Senior Club took place for the 1882-83 season.  Brighton Rangers won the final of the first competition 3-0. Founder members of Sussex County FA include the [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public schools]] of [[Lancing College]], [[Brighton College]] and [[Ardingly College]] and their old-boy teams dominated the cup early on, along with clubs such as [[Burgess Hill Town F.C.|Burgess Hill]] and [[Eastbourne Town F.C.|Eastbourne]], whose teams were made up of upper and middle class players.&lt;ref name="Carder-Rogers"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Tim|last1=Carder|first2=Roger|last2=Harris|title=Seagulls! The Story of Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|year=1993|publisher=Goldstone Books|isbn=0952133709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cup was initially contested only by amateur clubs.  At the time Sussex's only professional club, [[Brighton and Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton and Hove Albion]] tried to enter the competition in 1905 but had to withdraw because of clashing dates.&lt;ref name="Carder-Rogers"/&gt;  Albion won the Sussex Wartime Cup in 1943 but only entered the normal competition in 1946.&lt;ref name="Carder-Rogers"/&gt;  Albion entered the competition again in 1975-76 following the abolition of the distinction between amateur and professional clubs in the English game.&lt;ref name="Carder-Rogers"/&gt;

Following the 1913–14 competition, the cup was suspended due to the [[First World War]], and resumed in 1919–20.&lt;ref name="Carder-Rogers"/&gt;  During the Second World War the winners of the Sussex Wartime Cup were awarded the Sussex Senior Cup.  The Sussex Wartime Cup took place on a league basis and a competition was held in every year during the Second World War except for 1940-41 when no competition for the Sussex Senior Cup was held.

Under Jack Pearce, [[Bognor Regis Town F.C.|Bognor Regis Town]] dominated the Sussex Senior Cup in the 1980s, winning the cup six times, including a record five times in succession, and finishing runners-up once.

From 1950–51 the cup final took place at the [[Goldstone Ground]] every year until 1995 when Brighton sold their ground to developers.  A crowd of over 7,000, the cup's highest attendance in recent years, saw the 2010–11 season final take place at Brighton's new [[American Express Community Stadium]] on 16 July 2011.  It was the first competitive match to be played there. Brighton won the game 2–0 with [[Gary Hart (footballer)|Gary Hart]] scoring the first ever goal at the new ground. The cup final has taken place there every year since 2011.

==Eligibility==
The Sussex Senior Cup is open to all men's senior clubs in the historic county of [[Sussex]] that are affiliated to the [[Sussex County Football Association]].  In 2016–17 this was 50 clubs that play in the top ten tiers of the [[English football league system]] (Premier League, English Football League, National League, National League South, Isthmian League, Southern Combination Football League Premier Division, Southern Combination Football League Division One and Southern Counties East Premier Division).

==Competition format==
===Overview===
Beginning in September, the competition proceeds as a [[knockout tournament]] throughout its duration, consisting of three rounds, then quarter-finals, semi-finals and final, usually in May.  A system of byes ensures that the highest placed 14 clubs in Sussex enter the competition in the second round.  For reasons of fairness to other clubs,{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} the Brighton &amp; Hove Albion reserve team competes in the Sussex Senior Cup as, depending on season, the main squad are up to [[Football Championship]] level, many stages of the football league pyramid ahead of other teams.

===Distribution===
The tournament is organised so that 32 clubs remain by the second round. 35 of the 37 clubs in the Southern Combination League Premier Division and Division One (tiers 9 and 10 of the [[English football league system]]) and one club from the [[Southern Counties East Football League|Southern Counties East Premier Division]] (tier 9) enter in the first round. In the second round, the two highest ranked Southern Combination League Premier Division clubs from [[2015-16 in English football|2015–16]] ([[Eastbourne Town F.C.|Eastbourne Town]] and [[Peacehaven &amp; Telscombe F.C.|Peacehaven &amp; Telscombe]]) enter the cup, as well as [[Bognor Regis Town F.C.|Bognor Regis Town]], [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]], [[Burgess Hill Town F.C.|Burgess Hill Town]], [[Crawley Town F.C.|Crawley Town]], [[East Grinstead Town F.C.|East Grinstead Town]], [[Eastbourne Borough F.C.|Eastbourne Borough]], [[Hastings United F.C.|Hastings United]], [[Horsham F.C.|Horsham]], [[Lewes F.C.|Lewes]], [[Three Bridges F.C.|Three Bridges]], [[Whitehawk F.C.|Whitehawk]] and [[Worthing F.C.|Worthing]] who all receive a bye to the second round.

* Sussex-based clubs from the [[English Football League]], [[National League South]] and [[Isthmian League]] together with the two highest ranked [[Southern Combination Football League|Southern Combination Football League Premier Division]] clubs enter at the second round.
* The remaining Sussex-based Southern Combination Premier Division clubs and Sussex-based clubs from Southern Combination Division One and Southern Counties East Premier Division enter at the first round.

[[Image:Amex Stadium Pitch panorama - geograph.org.uk - 2859086.jpg|thumb|200px|The final of the Sussex Senior Cup has been played at [[Falmer Stadium]] since 2011]]
For rounds before the semi-final stage, the venue of each match is determined when the fixtures are drawn; the first club drawn in a fixture is usually the home team and matches are played at the club's home ground.  The semi-finals are played at a neutral venue, usually at the Sussex FA at Culver Road in [[Lancing, West Sussex|Lancing]].

The final of the Sussex Senior Cup was held at [[Preston Park, Brighton|Preston Park]] in Brighton for the first four competitions, from 1883 to 1886.  It was then held at the [[County Cricket Ground, Hove|County Cricket Ground]] in Hove for 18 editions of the cup, with the exception of the 1891 season, which was held on a league basis.  In 1906 the first cup final took place to have been played at the [[Goldstone Ground]] in Hove.  At the time the Goldstone Ground was the home stadium of Brighton and Hove Albion, which for some time was Sussex's only professional football club.  The Goldstone Ground was known to have hosted the final of the Sussex Senior Cup a record 55 times between 1906 and 1995.  Other stadiums to have hosted the Susssex Senior Cup include [[The Dripping Pan]] in Lewes (held 14 times between 1920 and 1947), The [[Newhaven F.C.|Trafalgar Ground]] in Newhaven (held twice in 1931 and 1932), [[Worthing F.C.|Woodside Road]] in Worthing (held 7 times between 1934 and 1997), [[The Saffrons]] in Eastbourne (held once in 1936), [[Horsham F.C.|Queen Street]] in Horsham (held once in 1949), [[Broadfield Stadium]] in [[Crawley]] (held twice in 1998 and 1999) and [[Priory Lane]] in [[Eastbourne]] (held 11 times between 2000 and 2010).  Since 2011 the final of the Sussex Senior Cup has been played at the [[Falmer Stadium]] in [[Brighton]].

'''Team North America''' was a [[Ice hockey|hockey]] team created for the [[2016 World Cup of Hockey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wch2016.com/north-america|title=Team North America News, Video, and Roster|website=WCH2016.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It represented players aged 23-and-under from [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].

A "Team North America" was also assembled for the [[National Hockey League All-Star Game]] from [[48th National Hockey League All-Star Game|1998]] to [[52nd National Hockey League All-Star Game|2002]], and consisted of NHL players of any age from Canada and the United States.

==2016 World Cup of Hockey==
Team North America played its first pre-tournament game on September 8, 2016. They defeated [[Team Europe (ice hockey)|Team Europe]] 4–0 at the [[Centre Vidéotron|Videotron Centre]], in [[Quebec City]]. They then played 2 more pre-tournament games, defeating Team Europe 7–4, and conceding to [[Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team|Czech Republic]] 3–2.

The team played only 3 official tournament games; a 4–1 win over [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]], a 4–3 loss against [[Russia men's national ice hockey team|Russia]], and a 4–3 [[Overtime (ice hockey)|overtime]] win against [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]]. Despite finishing in a tie with Russia for the final spot in the knockout round, Team North America did not advance as their head-to-head loss to Russia broke the tie. 

Team North America finished the tournament in 5th place with a record of 2–1–0. They scored 11 goals and allowed 8 for a +3 differential.

'''The Eilan''', also known as "Eilean Bheannchair", in [[Scots Gaelic]], is a [[shinty]] stadium in the town of [[Newtonmore]], [[Scotland]].  It is the home of [[Newtonmore Camanachd]] and has been a shinty venue since at least 1877.

==Location==

The park is situated near a confluence between the River Calder and the [[River Spey]] on the outskirts of [[Newtonmore]]. It takes its name from Eilean Bheannchair which sits in the confluence.

==History==

Shinty is recorded as being first played at the Eilan in 1877.[http://www.newtonmore.com/want-to-know-more/history.html]

The ground was redeveloped in 1993[http://www.ambaile.org.uk/en/item/item_photograph.jsp?item_id=142182] and has hosted several junior finals, including the 2010 Sutherland Cup final.  The club has still to be granted the [[Camanachd Cup]] Final.

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:The Gladiators 1963.png|thumb|250px|''The Gladiators'', John O'Gready's famous photograph of the two opposing captains, [[Norm Provan]] and [[Arthur Summons]], taken after the match.]] --&gt;
'''''The Gladiators''''' is a 1963 photograph by John O'Gready of [[Norm Provan]] and [[Arthur Summons]]. A memorable sporting image from Australia, the award winning photo later became the model for the [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership|NSWRL premiership]] Winfield Cup trophies from 1982 to 1995 the [[National Rugby League|NRL]] trophy since 1998.

The [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1963#Grand Final|1963 NSW Rugby League Premiership Grand Final]] between long term rivals Western Suburbs and St George was played in a torrential downpour on Saturday, 24 August. This, combined with the fact that the centre cricket pitch area of Sydney Cricket Ground was notoriously muddy in such conditions, ensured that the players were not only saturated but also caked in mud from head to toe.  At the conclusion of the hard fought match which was won by St George, the captains of the two teams, the tall [[Norm Provan]] and more diminutive Summons respectively, embraced in appreciation of each other's stoic efforts. The moment was captured by a newspaper photographer, John O'Gready, and published in the following day's ''[[Sun Herald]]''. Subsequently the image won several awards, becoming known as ''The Gladiators''. Summons has recently said that ''The Gladiators'' actually shows him complaining about the referees decision to Norm Provan.&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[Image:Winfield Cup plus The Gladiators.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Norm Provan and Arthur Summons with the [[Winfield Cup]] trophy at the [[NSWRL season 1991#Grand Final|1991 Grand Final]]]] --&gt; This image was the inspiration for the current premiership trophy's bronze statue.

In 2008 the Western Suburbs Magpies celebrated their centenary by inducting six inaugural members into the club's Hall of Fame. These six included Summons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Provan-Summons Trophy is the NRL's main prize, awarded to the team that wins the premiership.

[[File:2016 Illinois-Northwestern game IMG 0347.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Welsh–Ryan Arena exterior]]

'''Welsh–Ryan Arena''' is an 7,039-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Evanston, Illinois]], United States, near the campus of [[Northwestern University]]. It is home to four [[Northwestern Wildcats]] athletic teams: [[Northwestern Wildcats men's basketball|men's basketball]], [[Northwestern Wildcats women's basketball|women's basketball]], women's volleyball, and wrestling. It is located inside '''McGaw Memorial Hall''', to the north of [[Ryan Field (stadium)|Ryan Field]].

The building opened in 1952 as a replacement for [[Patten Gymnasium]], and was the site of the [[Final Four]] for the [[1956 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]]. It was extensively renovated in 1983, at which time the main arena was renamed Welsh–Ryan Arena. At the conclusion of the 2016–17 basketball season, plans are to renovate and upgrade the arena as part of a $110 million project scheduled to be completed by late 2018. The renovation will displace the athletic programs that use the arena for the 2017–18 season.

For years, Welsh–Ryan Arena was the smallest arena in the [[Big Ten Conference]] and the only conference facility that did not seat at least 10,000. With [[Rutgers University]] joining the conference in 2014, Welsh–Ryan became the second-smallest arena after the [[Louis Brown Athletic Center]] at Rutgers, which has a listed capacity of 8,000. Welsh–Ryan will once again become the smallest arena in the Big 10 Conference in 2018, with the listed capacity decreasing to 7,500 after renovations.

==History==
McGaw Memorial Hall was built through the generosity of Northwestern University trustee and donor Foster G. McGaw, founder of the American Hospital Supply Corporation. The building, named in memory of McGaw's father, Presbyterian minister and missionary Francis A. McGaw, to house sporting events and large-scale meetings. With a [[seating capacity]] of about 13,000, McGaw Memorial Hall was one of the three largest auditoriums in the Chicago area at the time of its construction. Designed by the architectural firm of Holabird &amp; Root &amp; Burgee and built of reinforced concrete, McGaw Memorial Hall contained 54,000 square feet of interior space. The lighting system, consisting of 180 mercury vapor lights, was said to simulate "pure daylight."

Partitions, portable bleachers, and a removable basketball floor made the building suitable for a wide variety of uses. While the intent was to provide a space large enough to hold the entire student body of Northwestern University at once during convocations and other such campus occasions, the auditorium was also used by the North Shore Music Festival and, soon after its opening, by the Second Assembly of the World Council of Churches. This event, held August 15–30, 1954, featured a convocation address by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

In 1983 Northwestern completed extensive renovations on the interior of the McGaw Hall. The main arena was renamed Welsh–Ryan Arena in honor of the project's principal donor, insurance magnate [[Pat Ryan (executive)|Patrick G. Ryan]], president of the Board of Trustees, and of his wife's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Robert J. Welsh, Sr. The lobby was renamed Ronald J. Chinnock Lobby after real estate tycoon Ronald Chinnock.

The McGaw Fieldhouse is a practice facility within the building, which in 1997 was renovated to allow practice space for basketball and volleyball.

In 2007, the Brown Family Basketball Center was constructed within the McGaw Fieldhouse to include new locker rooms and team  lounges for the men's and women's basketball teams, as well as offices for their respective coaching staffs.

In 2016, Northwestern announced plans for a $110 million arena renovation, shuttering the facility for the 2017–18 season (the Wildcat men will play at the [[Allstate Arena]] in [[Rosemont, Illinois|Rosemont]], with the women playing out of [[Evanston Township High School]]'s Beardsley Gym that season). Capacity is expected to be reduced to around 7,500 by replacing the bleachers with chairback seats. The renovated facility will also have wider concourses, balconies behind the baskets, and suites. Before then, one of the few significant changes since the 1983 renovation had been the replacement of the arena's 1980s-vintage scoreboards with a modern video board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greenstein|first1=Teddy|title=Northwestern's Welsh–Ryan Arena to receive long-overdue overhaul|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/college/ct-northwestern-welsh-ryan-renovation-20160613-column.html|accessdate=22 December 2016|agency=Chicago Tribune|date=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3547">'''Winger''', in the [[Ice hockey|game of ice hockey]], is a [[forward (ice hockey)|forward]] position of a player whose primary zone of play on the ice is along the outer playing area. They typically work by [[Flanking maneuver|flank]]ing the [[centre (ice hockey)|centre]] forward. Originally the name was given to forward players who went up and down the sides of the rink. Nowadays, there are different types of wingers in the game — out-and-out goal scorers, checkers who disrupt the opponents, and forwards who work along the boards and in the corners. They tend to be bigger than centreman and smaller than defenseman.

This position is commonly referred to by the side of the rink that the winger normally takes, i.e. "left wing" or "right wing."

== Defensive zone play ==
[[File:Defensive Winger (Ice hockey).PNG|thumb|right|Typical winger positioning in the defensive zone.]]

The wingers' responsibilities in the [[hockey rink#Zones|defensive zone]] include the following:
*getting open for a pass from their teammates
*intercepting a pass to the opposing [[defenceman]]
*attacking the opposing defencemen when they have the puck

Wingers should typically not:
*play deep in their defensive zone
*help out their teammates along the boards
*

== Offensive zone play ==
Wingers should be playing high in the zone, and always be vigilant for a breakout pass or a chance to chip the puck [[Offside (ice hockey)|past the blue line]]. When wingers receive a pass along the boards, they can exercise a number of options:

*Bank the puck off the boards or glass to get it out of the zone
*Redirect or softly pass the puck to a rushing forward
*Shoot the puck out to the centre line to another forward who can either set up an attack, or dump the puck into the offensive zone to summon a line change
*Carry the puck themselves into the offensive zone to attempt a [[Breakaway (ice hockey)|breakaway]] or an odd man rush

==Backchecking==
Wingers are usually the last players to [[checking (ice hockey)|backcheck]] out of the offensive zone.  On the backcheck, it is essential that they cover the last free opposing player rushing in. Once the puck is controlled by the opposing team in the defensive zone, however, wingers are responsible for covering the defenceman on their side of the ice.

==Face-offs==
Prior to the puck being dropped for a [[face-off]], players other than those taking the face-off must not make any physical contact with players on the opposite team, nor enter the face-off circle (where marked). After the puck is dropped, it is essential for wingers to engage the opposing players to prevent them from obtaining possession of the puck.

Once a team has established control of the puck, wingers can set themselves up into an appropriate position.

Some wingers are also employed to handle faceoffs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/dallas-stars/headlines/20131018-heika-stars-jamie-benn-taking-skills-learned-while-playing-center-into-new-lw-role.ece Heika: Faceoff skills learned playing center paying dividends for Stars' Jamie Benn in new position]&lt;/ref&gt;

Course distances are set on the day of the event to achieve a winning time of around 80–90 minutes, after taking account of the snow conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.triathlon.org/multisports/winter_triathlon/ |title=Winter Triathlon |publisher=International Triathlon Union |accessdate=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2013 the [[International Triathlon Union]] created a new version of the sport, which consist of 5 km of snowshoeing, 12km of ice skating and 8km of cross-country skiing. It is called winter triathlon S3, because the three sports start with an S (snowshoes, skate, ski). The first ITU event was held in Quebec, Canada in February 2015. However, the Canadian national winter triathlon championships have been running for over 30 years. The Winterlude Triathlon is the oldest established winter triathlon in Canada. {{Cn|date=June 2017}}

[[Image:2005 WSOP gold bracelet.jpg|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Non-Main Event gold bracelets given to the event winners during the [[2005 World Series of Poker]] &lt;/center&gt;]]

The '''World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelet''' is considered the most coveted non-monetary prize a [[poker]] player can win. Since 1976, a bracelet has been awarded to the winner of every event at the annual [[World Series of Poker|WSOP]].  Even if the victory occurred before 1976, WSOP championships are now counted as "bracelets".  During the first years of the WSOP only a handful of bracelets were awarded each year.  In 1990, there were only 14 bracelet events.  By 2000, that number increased to 24.  As the popularity of poker has increased during the 2000s, the number of events has likewise increased.  In 2011, 58 bracelets were awarded at the WSOP, seven at the [[World Series of Poker Europe]] (WSOPE), and one to the WSOP National Circuit Champion.&lt;ref name="CNC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsop.com/news/2011/May/3329/SAM-BARNHART-WINS-INAUGURAL-WSOP-CIRCUIT-NATIONAL-CHAMPIONSHIP.html|title=Sam Barnhart Wins Inaugural WSOP Circuit National Championship|accessdate=June 5, 2011|date=May 29, 2001|publisher=Caesars Interactive Entertainment, Inc.|work=WSOP.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602153754/http://www.wsop.com/news/2011/May/3329/SAM-BARNHART-WINS-INAUGURAL-WSOP-CIRCUIT-NATIONAL-CHAMPIONSHIP.html|archivedate=June 2, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This brought the total number of bracelets awarded up to 959.&lt;ref name = "CNC" /&gt; Five additional bracelets were awarded for the first time in April 2013 at the inaugural World Series of Poker Asia-Pacific (WSOP APAC) in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="WSOP APAC"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.wsop.com/news/2012/May/3761/WSOP-ANNOUNCES-PARTNERSHIP-WITH-CROWN-FOR-APRIL-2013-EVENT-IN-MELBOURNE-AUSTRALIA.html |title=WSOP Announces Partnership With Crown for April 2013 Event in Melbourne, Australia |publisher=World Series of Poker |date=April 30, 2012 |accessdate=May 10, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504203339/http://www.wsop.com/news/2012/May/3761/WSOP-ANNOUNCES-PARTNERSHIP-WITH-CROWN-FOR-APRIL-2013-EVENT-IN-MELBOURNE-AUSTRALIA.html |archivedate=May 4, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2017, 74 for bracelets were awarded at the WSOP and an additional 11 will be awarded at the WSOPE in Czech Republic.

After the conclusion of the [[2014 World Series of Poker Asia Pacific|2014 WSOP APAC]], there have been 1083 bracelets awarded, 500 of which were won by 170 players who have won at least two bracelets, with all of the other bracelets being won by one-time winners. This includes (up to this point) 17 [[List of World Series of Poker Main Event champions|Main Event winners]]: [[Hal Fowler]], [[Bill Smith (poker player)|Bill Smith]], [[Mansour Matloubi]], [[Brad Daugherty (poker player)|Brad Daugherty]], [[Jim Bechtel]], [[Russ Hamilton]], [[Noel Furlong]], [[Robert Varkonyi]], [[Chris Moneymaker]], [[Greg Raymer]], [[Joe Hachem]], [[Jamie Gold]], [[Jerry Yang (poker player)|Jerry Yang]], [[Peter Eastgate]], [[Pius Heinz]], [[Ryan Riess]] and [[Martin Jacobson]].

Since Chris Moneymaker won the 2003 Main Event, (through the completion of Event {{abbr|No.|number}}&amp;nbsp;74 in 2017) only three players have won and followed it up with a win in another bracelet event, [[Jonathan Duhamel]], [[Joe Cada]] and [[Joe McKeehen]] .

The 1976 bracelet looked "like gold nuggets kind of hammered flat".&lt;ref name = "becky" /&gt; The bracelet in 1976 cost approximately $500. In the 1980s, [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] jeweler Mordechai Yerushalmi became the exclusive manufacturer of WSOP bracelets until Harrah's Entertainment bought the rights to the WSOP in 2004.&lt;ref name = "becky" /&gt;  According to 2003 WSOP Champion [[Chris Moneymaker]], the design of the bracelet remained relatively unchanged under Yerushalmi.&lt;ref&gt;ESPN's coverage of the 2007 World Series of Poker Episode 13&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, Gold and Diamond International based in Memphis, TN won the bid from Harrah's Entertainment to manufacture the 2005 World Series of Poker bracelets. The company also manufactures the WSOP circuit rings.&lt;ref&gt;CardPlayer Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Frederick Goldman, Inc. made the WSOP bracelets while luxury watch maker Corum introduced some commemorative watches as part of the prize package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldseriesofpoker.com/tourney/updates.asp?tid=3461&amp;grid=309|title=Limit Hold'em (Event 34)|work=World Series of Poker|publisher=Harrah's Entertainment|accessdate=June 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokerpages.com/tournament/result20309.htm|title=39th World Series of Poker 2008|work=Poker Tournament Results|publisher=PokerPages|accessdate=June 14, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314054501/http://www.pokerpages.com/tournament/result20309.htm|archivedate=March 14, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the Champion's bracelet had 259 stones including 7.2 carats (1.4 g) of diamonds, 120 grams of white and yellow gold.  It also used rubies to represent the heart and diamond suits, a sapphire to represent the spade and three black diamonds to represent the clubs.&lt;ref name = "becky" /&gt;

In 2007, Corum became the official bracelet manufacturer for the WSOP. Some of the 2007 World Series of Poker champions received both a watch and a bracelet from Corum. Corum designed four variations for the 2007 World Series of Poker Bracelets.  The standard version that is presented to 53 winners features 53 diamonds.&lt;ref name="corum"&gt;[http://www.globeinvestor.com/servlet/story/BWIRE.20070605.20070605006220/GIStory CORUM Introduces New World Series of Poker(R) Bracelets] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091211213804/http://www.globeinvestor.com/servlet/story/BWIRE.20070605.20070605006220/GIStory |date=December 11, 2009 }} June 5, 2007.

In 2010, an Australian-based company OnTilt Designs Pty Ltd won a multi-year contract to become the official bracelet manufacturer for the WSOP. OnTilt jewelers decided that the 2010 bracelet design would return to the tradition of the 1970s and 1980s where the bracelet was a heavy piece of unadorned metal. American jewelry designer [[Steve Soffa]] was chosen to design and manufacture the entire set of bracelets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pokernewsdaily.com/wsop-bracelet-designer-steve-soffa-interview-11316/ | title=WSOP Bracelet Designer Steve Soffa Interview | publisher=Poker News Daily | date=14 May 2010 | accessdate=29 April 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429193034/http://www.pokernewsdaily.com/wsop-bracelet-designer-steve-soffa-interview-11316/ | archivedate=April 29, 2014 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was to create a bracelet that somebody would actually want to wear every day. In 2011, OnTilt has also been chosen to manufacture the [[World Series of Poker Circuit events|WSOP Circuit]] rings.

In 2012, Jason Arasheben, famed jewelry designer and owner of Jason of Beverly Hills was chosen as the official bracelet manufacturer of the WSOP. Arasheben had designed the championship rings for the 2009 and 2010 Los Angeles Lakers and the 2011 Green Bay Packers, among others. The Main Event bracelet will feature each suit in the deck in either rubies or black diamonds. In terms of sheer mass, it weighs in at over 160 grams of 14 karat gold and over 35 carats of flawless diamonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bluff.com/news/wsop-reveals-new-bracelet-design-by-jason-of-beverly-hills-26967/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706124628/http://www.bluff.com/news/wsop-reveals-new-bracelet-design-by-jason-of-beverly-hills-26967/ |archivedate=July 6, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A special platinum bracelet was awarded at the 2012 WSOP to the winner of The [[Big One for One Drop]], Antonio Esfandiari. The event was a $1 million buy-in tournament created as a fundraiser for the [[One Drop Foundation]], a charity established by [[Cirque du Soleil]] founder [[Guy Laliberté]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/poker/story/_/id/7804846/world-series-poker-offer-1-million-buy-tournament |title=WSOP to offer $1 million buy-in |author=Associated Press |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=April 12, 2012 |accessdate=April 13, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413123408/http://espn.go.com/poker/story/_/id/7804846/world-series-poker-offer-1-million-buy-tournament |archivedate=April 13, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prestige==
At first, the bracelets did not have much prestige. Ten-time bracelet winner [[Doyle Brunson]] said that his first bracelet "didn't mean anything" to him and that he did not even pick up two of them.&lt;ref name = "WSOP2007" /&gt;

Some professional poker players believe that there are two types of poker players; those who have won a bracelet and those who have not. Those who have belong to an exclusive club.&lt;ref name = "WSOP2007" /&gt; "It's impossible to overstate the value of a World Series of Poker gold bracelet to anyone who takes the game seriously," stated World Series of Poker Commissioner [[Jeffrey Pollack]] during the 2006 bracelet unveiling. "It is the equivalent of winning the [[Stanley Cup]] in [[ice hockey|hockey]] or the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy|Lombardi Trophy]] in [[American football]]."&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Earl.

Many professional poker players desire the recognition that is associated with the bracelet. Former [[Celebrity Poker Showdown]] host and poker star [[Phil Gordon]] said, "I want that bracelet more than anything."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pokerlistings.com/phil-gordons-quest-for-a-wsop-bracelet-continues-734 Phil Gordon's Quest for a WSOP Bracelet Continues] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927193038/http://www.pokerlistings.com/phil-gordons-quest-for-a-wsop-bracelet-continues-734 |date=September 27, 2007 }}. (June 10, 2005). ''Pokerlistings.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freddy Deeb]] said that he did not appreciate his first bracelet because he did not recognize what it meant. He said his 2007 bracelet, however, "means everything to me".&lt;ref&gt;Press Release.

When the [[World Poker Tour]] decided to offer a prize to its event champions, they decided to present them with [[World Poker Tour bracelet|WPT Bracelets.]]  In so doing, WPT Founder, President and CEO Steve Lipscomb said, "The championship bracelet has become synonymous with poker as a symbol of achievement and respect, and we are honored to continue the tradition that [[Benny Binion]] [the founder of the WSOP] began over 30 years ago."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS132757+08-Apr-2008+BW20080408|title=Six Seasons of Champions to Receive WPT Championship Bracelet|date=April 8, 2008|work=Reuters|accessdate=February 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Bracelets have not always been awarded for winning events. In 1970, the first WSOP Champion received nothing but a silver cup and whatever cash he won during the event.&lt;ref&gt;The first WSOP was not a freeze out tournament, but rather a collection of the top players playing against one another and the eventual winner was determined by a vote. [http://www.pokerplayerpress.com/Gallery-JohnnyMoss.html Johnny Moss Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811165953/http://www.pokerplayerpress.com/Gallery-JohnnyMoss.html |date=August 11, 2007 }} ''PokerPlayerPress.com''&lt;/ref&gt; From 1971–1974, according to Becky Behnen (the daughter of WSOP founder [[Benny Binion]]), the winner received an undescribed "corny trophy".&lt;ref name="becky"&gt;Associated Press [http://www.abqtrib.com/news/2006/jul/28/pokers-glory-is-about-the-bracelet-not-the-money/?printer=1/ Poker's glory is about the bracelet, not the money] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422062532/http://www.abqtrib.com/news/2006/jul/28/pokers-glory-is-about-the-bracelet-not-the-money/?printer=1%2F |date=April 22, 2009 }} ''Albuquerque Tribune''. (July 28, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, the winners received a sterling plate. The following year, 1976, the WSOP started the tradition of issuing bracelets to the event winners.

In 1980 and 1981, one did not have to win a WSOP event to win a gold bracelet. In 1980 and 1981, H.D. "Oklahoma Johny" Hale and [[Chip Reese]] received a gold bracelet for being the "Best All Around Player" at the WSOP, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;"Oklahoma Johnny" Hale.[http://gaming.unlv.edu/WSOP/Hale.pdf "Oklahoma Johnny" Hale.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208025543/http://gaming.unlv.edu/WSOP/Hale.pdf |date=December 8, 2006 }} '''The Life and Times of a Gentleman Gambler.''' Las Vegas: Poker Plus Publications, 1999. 127–132. Accessed July 12, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; These bracelets, however, are not considered in the count of WSOP championship bracelets.

In 2007, [[Thomas Bihl]] became the first person to ever win a WSOP bracelet outside [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], Nevada.  Bihl won the £2,500 World Championship H.O.R.S.E. at the [[World Series of Poker Europe]] in London, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokerlistings.com/poker-player-interviews/wsop/2007/send-the-bills-to-bihl-thomas-bihl-wins-wsope-event-1|title=Send the bills to Bihl! – Thomas Bihl wins WSOPE Event 1|work=Poker Listing|date=August 7, 2007|accessdate=June 15, 2009|last=Crowson|first=Authur|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080717001619/http://www.pokerlistings.com/poker-player-interviews/wsop/2007/send-the-bills-to-bihl-thomas-bihl-wins-wsope-event-1|archivedate=July 17, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Days later, [[Annette Obrestad]] became the youngest player to ever win a WSOP bracelet at 18 years, 364 days, also becoming the first woman to win a World Series Main Event (WSOPE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokernews.com/news/2007/09/wsope-event-3-final-table-annette-obrestad-wins.htm|work=Pokernews.com|title=£10,000 NLHE, Final Table: Annette Obrestad Makes History|accessdate=May 9, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530144034/http://www.pokernews.com/news/2007/09/wsope-event-3-final-table-annette-obrestad-wins.htm|archivedate=May 30, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Caesars Entertainment (known until 2010 as Harrah's Entertainment), the owner of the WSOP, considers the WSOP Europe bracelet to be the same in prestige as those awarded every year in Las Vegas.

In 2008, [[Jesper Hougaard]] became the first person to have won both a WSOP and WSOPE bracelet.

In 2011, a World Series of Poker bracelet was awarded for the first time to the [[World Series of Poker Circuit events|WSOP Circuit National Championship]] winner in the 100-qualifier event from May 27–29.&lt;ref name="CNC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsop.com/tourney/tourneydetails.asp?groupID=812|title=$1,000,000 WSOP Circuit NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP|accessdate=June 5, 2011|date=May 29, 2001|publisher=Caesars Interactive Entertainment, Inc.|work=WSOP.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717160438/http://www.wsop.com/tourney/tourneydetails.asp?groupID=812|archivedate=July 17, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the Circuit National Championship moved to [[Harrah's New Orleans|New Orleans]],&lt;ref name="Feldman"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/poker/story/_/id/6800493/2011-12-world-series-poker-circuit-schedule-feature-16-tour-stops |title='11-'12 WSOP Circuit to feature 16 stops |first=Andrew |last=Feldman |publisher=''[[ESPN.com]]'' |date=July 29, 2011 |accessdate=July 28, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223115328/http://espn.go.com/poker/story/_/id/6800493/2011-12-world-series-poker-circuit-schedule-feature-16-tour-stops |archivedate=December 23, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; where it will also be held in 2013.&lt;ref name="espn.go.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/poker/story/_/id/8192752/2012-13-world-series-poker-circuit-schedule-feature-20-tour-stops |title=WSOP Circuit expands for 2012–13 |first=Andrew |last=Feldman |publisher=''[[ESPN.com]]'' |date=July 23, 2012 |accessdate=July 28, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726014645/http://espn.go.com/poker/story/_/id/8192752/2012-13-world-series-poker-circuit-schedule-feature-20-tour-stops |archivedate=July 26, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2013, bracelets are also awarded in [[Australia]] at the World Series of Poker Asia-Pacific, held at [[Crown Casino and Entertainment Complex|Crown Melbourne]].&lt;ref name="WSOP APAC"/&gt;

==Bracelet legacy==
Of the three top WSOP bracelet winners, only [[Johnny Chan (poker player)|Johnny Chan]] still has them all. He keeps them locked in a vault because they are worth, according to him, "millions".&lt;ref name = "becky" /&gt; Brunson did not pick up two of his. Fifteen-time bracelet winner [[Phil Hellmuth]] gave away ten of his. "To me," Hellmuth said, "the bracelets have always been a really huge deal, to me more than the other guys, because I knew that they represented history."&lt;ref name = "becky" /&gt;

Three-time WSOP Bracelet winner [[Hamid Dastmalchi]] and six-time winner [[Ted Forrest]] had been playing for four days non-stop at [[the Mirage]] when Hamid started to complain about the 1992 Main Event Championship Bracelet he received. Bitter about a dispute with the [[Binion's Horseshoe]], the owners of the WSOP at the time, Hamid told the table that the Binion's "say it's worth $5,000, but I'd take $1,500 for it." To which Forrest responded "Sold" and immediately tossed Hamid $1,500 in chips. Dastmalchi mailed Forrest his bracelet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokernewsdaily.com/ted-forrest-141/|title=Ted Forrest|work=Player Profiile|publisher=Poker News Daily|accessdate=June 20, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223231015/http://www.pokernewsdaily.com/ted-forrest-141/|archivedate=February 23, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fulltiltpoker.com/poker-blog/2009/06/767_2009_wsop_25_ghost_series_3_39_champions_part_iii.php|title=#767 – 2009 WSOP No. 25 – Ghost Series No. 3 – 39 Champions, Part III|last=Wilson|first=Craig|date=June 9, 2009|accessdate=June 20, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612052656/http://www.fulltiltpoker.com/poker-blog/2009/06/767_2009_wsop_25_ghost_series_3_39_champions_part_iii.php|archivedate=June 12, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ted Forrest also reported that three of his five bracelets have been stolen over the years, and that he gave his daughter one.&lt;ref&gt;Administrator [http://www.ixgames.com/ted_forrest/ Ted Forrest Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928141633/http://www.ixgames.com/ted_forrest/ |date=September 28, 2007 }} ''IXGames'' Accessed July 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

(bold = won [[List of World Series of Poker Main Event champions#World Series of Poker Main Event|Main Event]])

[[Johnny Moss]], with a win at the [[1971 World Series of Poker|1971 WSOP]], became the first person to have won multiple lifetime WSOP "bracelets" (as mentioned above, the first actual bracelet was given in 1976).

Moss also was the first person to win five lifetime WSOP bracelets, with a win at the [[1975 World Series of Poker|1975 WSOP]].

[[Johnny Chan (poker player)|Johnny Chan]], with a win in Event No. 25 at the [[2005 World Series of Poker]], became the first person to win 10 lifetime WSOP bracelets, just a few days before [[Doyle Brunson]] won his 10th bracelet in Event No. 31 of that same WSOP.

The first person to win two bracelets in the same WSOP was Johnny Moss at the [[1971 World Series of Poker|1971 WSOP]].

The first person to win three bracelets in the same WSOP was [[Puggy Pearson|Walter "Puggy" Pearson]], at the [[1973 World Series of Poker|1973 WSOP]].  As of the start of the 2016 WSOP, only five other players have won three bracelets in a single WSOP.

[[Bill Boyd (poker player)|Bill Boyd]] and Doyle Brunson are the only players to have won bracelets in four consecutive years (Boyd from 1971 to 1974, and Brunson from 1976 to 1979).

==WSOP rings==
In 2005, the WSOP started hosting [[World Series of Poker Circuit events|Circuit Events]] at many of their casinos around the country.  In order to differentiate these events and to ensure the prestige of the WSOP Bracelet, the circuit events present a ring to the winners.  In 2011, the WSOP awarded a bracelet to the winner of the Circuit Event National Championship.  The Circuit Event National Championship was an invitation only event that used the standings of players from the various circuit events in determining who was invited.

==Circuit National Championship==
Starting with the [[2011 World Series of Poker Circuit|2011 WSOP Circuit]], the Circuit National Championship was held as a closed event for participants of various circuit events.

Starting in [[2011–12 World Series of Poker Circuit|2012]], qualification for the Circuit National Championship was significantly changed. A total of 100 players now receive automatic seats in the National Championship. The winners of each Circuit main event and the highest point earner at each circuit stop receive seats, with the remaining automatic seats filled by the top points earners throughout the Circuit season who are not already qualified. Additionally, the top 100 players in the "WSOP World Rankings", a points race determined on results in open events of the previous two WSOPs, are eligible to enter. The Circuit qualifiers play the National Championship on a freeroll, while the WSOP World Rankings qualifiers must pay a $10,000 buy-in.&lt;ref name="Feldman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="espn.go.com"/&gt;

The winner of the Circuit National Championship wins a World Series of Poker bracelet.
