'''Abstinence''' is a self-enforced restraint from indulging in bodily activities that are widely experienced as giving [[pleasure]]. Most frequently, the term refers to [[sexual abstinence]], or abstinence from [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] or [[food]]. The practice can arise from religious prohibitions and practical considerations.
Abstinence may also refer to drugs. For example, one can abstain from smoking.
Abstinence has diverse forms. Commonly it refers to a temporary or partial abstinence from food, as in [[fasting]]. In the [[twelve-step program]] of [[Overeaters Anonymous]] abstinence is the term for refraining from compulsive eating, akin in meaning to sobriety for alcoholics. Because the regimen is intended to be a conscious act, freely chosen to enhance life, abstinence is sometimes distinguished from the psychological mechanism of [[repression (psychological)|repression]]. The latter is an unconscious state, having unhealthy consequences. [[Freud]] termed the channeling of sexual energies into other more culturally or socially acceptable activities, "[[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]]".

==Abstinence in religion==
Abstinence may arise from an [[ascetic]] over indulgent, hasidic point of view in natural ways of procreation, present in most faiths, or from a subjective need for spiritual discipline. In its religious context, abstinence is meant to elevate the believer beyond the normal life of desire, to a chosen ideal, by following a path of renunciation.

For [[Jew]]s, the principal day of fast is [[Yom Kippur]], the Day of Atonement.

For [[Muslim]]s, the period of fasting lasts during the whole month of [[Ramadan]], from dawn to dusk.

Both Jews and Muslims abstain from [[pork]] in their regular diet.

In both Christianity and Islam, amongst others, [[pre-marital sex]] is prohibited.

Also, [[Catholic]] Christians abstain from food and drink for an hour prior to taking [[Holy Communion]], and abstain from meat on [[Ash Wednesday]] and on Fridays during [[Lent]]. Many [[Traditionalist Catholics]] abstain from eating meat all Fridays in the year. In the [[Anglican Communion]], the [[Book of Common Prayer]] prescribes certain days as days for fasting and abstinence, "consisting of the 40 days of Lent, the ember days, the three rogation days (the Monday to Wednesday following the Sunday after Ascension Day), and all Fridays in the year (except Christmas, if it falls on a Friday)."&lt;ref name="Buchanan2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=Colin|title=Historical Dictionary of Anglicanism|date=27 February 2006|publisher=Scarecrow Press|language=English |isbn=9780810865068|page=182|quote=In the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, there is a list of "Days of Fasting, or Abstinence," consisting of the 40 days of Lent, the ember days, the three rogation days (the Monday to Wednesday following the Sunday after Ascension Day), and all Fridays in the year (except Christmas, if it falls on a Friday).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orthodox Christians abstain from food and drink from midnight on the day they receive Holy Communion, and abstain from meat and dairy on Wednesdays and Fridays throughout the year, as well as during Great Lent. Catholics distinguish between [[Fasting and abstinence in the Roman Catholic Church|fasting and abstinence]]; the former referring to the discipline of taking one full meal a day, and the latter signifying the discipline of eating no meat (fish is allowed). Some [[Protestant]]s, especially [[Methodist]]s and [[Baptist]]s, have preferred to abstain from drinking alcohol and the use of tobacco.

[[Mormons]] abstain from certain foods and drinks by combining spiritual discipline with health concerns. Mormons also fast one day a month, for both spiritual and charitable reasons (the money saved by skipping meals is donated to the needy). The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] encourages the consumption of only clean meats as specified in [[Leviticus]] and strongly discourages the consumption of alcohol, smoking, and the use of [[narcotics]].&lt;ref name="adventist"&gt;{{cite web

In [[India]], [[Buddhist]]s, [[Jain]]s, [[Sikhs]] and [[Hinduism|Hindus]]{{cn|date=October 2015}} abstain from eating meat and fish (basically, all living animals) on the grounds both of health and of reverence for all sentient forms of life. Total abstinence from feeding on the flesh of cows is a hallmark of [[Hinduism]]. In addition, lay and monastic Buddhists refrain from killing any living creature and from consuming intoxicants, and [[bhikkhu]]s keep vows of chastity. In [[Theravada]] Buddhism, bhikkhus also refrain from eating in the afternoon, and cannot accept money. Jains abstain from violence in any form, and will not consume living creatures or kill bugs or insects.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ahimsa in Jainism]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medicine==
{{medref|section|date=November 2017}}
In medicine, abstinence is the discontinuation of a drug, often an [[drug addiction|addictive]] one. This might, in addition to craving after the drug, be expressed as [[withdrawal syndromes]]. In the Basic Text of Narcotics Anonymous, a large fellowship following the 12-steps outlined by AA, NA is outlined to be "a program of complete abstinence from all mood or mind-altering substances."{{cn|date=November 2017}} This description includes alcohol, because alcohol is a drug, and is widely known to include any kind of prescription narcotics, like pain-killers (opiates), anti-anxiety medicine (benzodiazepines) or diet pills (amphetamines). The practice of abstinence is a learned behavior, and comes slowly over time - time spent listening and sharing in NA and AA meetings, behavioral health psychology group or individualized therapies, and hanging out with people in the recovery support community.

==Types of abstinence==

===Food===
{{Further|Fasting|Vegetarianism|Veganism}}
[[File:Womans-Holy-War.jpg|thumb|"Woman's Holy War. Grand Charge on the Enemy's Works". An allegorical 1874 political cartoon print, which somewhat unusually shows temperance campaigners (alcohol prohibition advocates) as virtuous armored women warriors (riding sidesaddle), wielding axes Carrie-Nation-style to destroy barrels of Beer, Whisky, Gin, Rum, Brandy, Wine and Liquors, under the banners of "In the name of God and humanity" and "Temperance League". The foremost woman bears the shield seen in the [[Seal of the United States]] (based on the U.S. flag), suggesting the patriotic motivations of temperance campaigners. The shoe and pants-leg of a fleeing male miscreant are seen at lower right.]]

''Fasting'' is primarily the act of willingly abstaining from some or all food, [[drink]], or both, for a period of time. A fast may be total or partial concerning that from which one fasts, and may be prolonged or intermittent as to the period of fasting.  Fasting practices may preclude sexual activity as well as food, in addition to refraining from eating certain types or groups of foods; for example, one might refrain from eating [[meat]].
A complete fast in its traditional definition is abstinence of all food and liquids except for water.

''Vegetarianism'' is the practice of a diet that excludes meat (including [[Game (food)|game]], marine mammals and slaughter by-products), [[poultry]], fowl, [[fish]], [[shellfish]] and other sea creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title = Vegetarian
| url = http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/vegetarian?
| publisher = [[Compact Editions of the Oxford English Dictionary|Compact Oxford English Dictionary]]
| accessdate = 2008-06-15
| quote = a person who does not eat meat for moral, religious, or health reasons. ['meat' is [http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/meat? defined] as 'the flesh of an animal as food']
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are several variants of the diet, some of which also exclude [[egg (food)|eggs]] or products produced from animal labour such as [[dairy product]]s and [[honey]].

===Tobacco smoking===
{{Further|Smoking cessation}}
''Smoking cessation'' is the action leading towards the discontinuation of the consumption of a smoked substance, mainly tobacco, but it may encompass [[cannabis smoking|cannabis]] and other substances as well.

===Alcohol===
{{Further|Teetotalism}}
''Teetotalism'' is the practice and promotion of complete abstinence from [[alcoholic beverage]]s.

Some common reasons for choosing teetotalism are [[religion|religious]], [[health]], [[family]], [[philosophical]] or [[society|social]] reasons, and, sometimes, as simply a matter of taste preference.  When at [[bar (establishment)|drinking establishments]], they either abstain from drinking or consume non-alcoholic beverages such as tea, coffee, water, juice, and [[soft drink]]s.

Contemporary and [[colloquial]] usage has somewhat expanded teetotalism to include strict abstinence from most "recreational" [[intoxicants]] (legal and illegal, see [[controlled substances]]). Most teetotaller organizations also demand from their members that they do not promote or produce alcoholic intoxicants.

===Pleasure===
{{Further|Work-life balance}}
A general abstinence from pleasures or [[leisure]], either partial or full, may be motivated by ambition, [[career]] or general self-respect (excluding the point of view that even the latter examples may be regarded as sources of pleasure).

It is widely accepted that abstinence from [[drug addiction|addictive drugs]] gives successful outcome.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} However, it is not certain whether a general abstinence from pleasures of leisure yields higher productivity. Too much work generates [[Stress (biological)|stress]] and its potential adverse effects. Furthermore, the effort itself to achieve abstinence may consume willpower from its ultimate purpose. Total abstinence from pleasure or leisure is practically impossible and instead an individual [[work-life balance]] is necessary.

[[File:Jerusalem Holy Sepulchre BW 7.JPG|The Aedicule|thumb|200px|The Aedicula where, according to [[Christianity|Christian religious tradition]], the body of [[Jesus]] was buried]]
[[File:Cathedral of exeter.jpg|thumb|275px|Gothic facade of [[Exeter Cathedral]], with rows of figures in aedicular or tabernacle frames above the door, and two above the [[crenellation]]s]]

In [[religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], an '''''aedicula''''' (plural '''''aediculae''''') is a small [[shrine]]. The word ''aedicula'' is the [[diminutive]] of the [[Latin]] ''[[aedes (Roman)|aedes]]'', a temple building.

Many aediculae were household [[shrine]]s that held small [[altar]]s or [[statue]]s of the [[Lares]] and [[Penates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Aedicula|volume=1|page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lares were [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman deities]] protecting the house and the family household gods. The Penates were originally [[patron gods]] (really [[genius (mythology)|genii]]) of the storeroom, later becoming household gods guarding the entire house.

Other aediculae were small shrines within larger [[temple]]s, usually set on a base, surmounted by a pediment and surrounded by columns. In Roman architecture the aedicula has this representative function in the society. They are installed in public buildings like the [[Triumphal arch]], [[City gate]], or [[Therm]]es. The [[Celsus]] Library in [[Ephesus]] (2. c. AD) is a good example. From the 4th century Christianization of the Roman Empire onwards such shrines, or the framework enclosing them, are often called by the Biblical term [[tabernacle]], which becomes extended to any elaborated framework for a niche, window or picture.

==Gothic aediculae==
As in [[Classical architecture]], in [[Gothic architecture]], too, an aedicule or  tabernacle frame is a structural framing device that gives importance to its contents, whether an inscribed plaque, a [[cult object]], a bust or the like, by assuming the tectonic vocabulary of a little building that sets it apart from the wall against which it is placed. A tabernacle frame on a wall serves similar hieratic functions as a free-standing, three-dimensional architectural [[baldaquin]] or a [[Ciborium (architecture)|ciborium]] over an [[altar]].

In Late Gothic settings, [[altarpiece]]s and [[devotional image]]s were customarily crowned with [[gable]]s and canopies supported by clustered-column piers, echoing in small the architecture of Gothic churches.  Painted ædicules frame figures from sacred history in initial letters of [[illuminated manuscript]]s.

==Renaissance aediculae==
[[File:Palazzo medici riccardi finestre inginocchiate.JPG|thumb|Two "tabernacle windows" in the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi]] in Florence.  These are of the type known as "inginocchiata", "kneeling" on two brackets.]] 
Classicizing architectonic structure and decor ''all'antica'', in the "ancient [Roman] mode", became a fashionable way to frame a painted or bas-relief portrait, or protect an expensive and precious mirror&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/fram/ho_1975.1.1638.htm Metropolitan Museum: tabernacle frame, Florence, ca 1510]&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[High Renaissance]]; Italian precedents were imitated in France, then in Spain, England and Germany during the later 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/tabernacleinfo.shtm National Gallery of Art: Tabernacle frames from the Samuel H. Kress collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Renaissance classicism==
Aedicular door surrounds that are architecturally treated, with pilasters or columns flanking the doorway and an [[entablature]] even with a [[pediment]] over it came into use with the 16th century.  In the [[neo-Palladian]] revival in Britain, architectonic aedicular or tabernacle frames, carved and gilded. are favourite schemes for English [[Palladian]] mirror frames of the late 1720s through the 1740s, by such designers as [[William Kent]].

==Other aedicula==
Similar small shrines, called ''[[naiskos|naiskoi]]'', are found in [[Religion in ancient Greece|Greek religion]], but their use was strictly religious.

Aediculae exist today in Roman [[cemeteries]] as a part of funeral architecture.

Presently the most famous aedicule is situated inside the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in city of [[Jerusalem]].

Contemporary American architect [[Charles Moore (architect)|Charles Moore]] uses the concept of aediculae in his work to create spaces within spaces and to evoke the spiritual significance of the home.

'''Al-Arqam''' is a [[Malaysia]]n-based Islamic religious sect, founded by [[Ashaari Mohammad]]. The sect was banned by the Malaysian [[Politics of Malaysia|federal government]] on 21 October 1994. More than 5 Al-Arqam members including [[Ashaari Mohammad]] (leader of movement) were arrested under [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]] (ISA) in [[Thailand]] and were flown back to Malaysia to be detained.

Two books written by Khadijah Aam,  [[Ashaari Mohammad]]'s wife, have been banned on religious grounds, including the claim that Ashaari Mohammad ''had been empowered by Allah with supernatural powers.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v3/news_lite.php?id=235079 |title=Books Proof Ashaari Still Believes In Al-Arqam Teachings, Says Ex-Follower  |work=bernama.com |year=2011 |quote='It contains 36 items that can sway the faith of Muslims including claims that he had been empowered by Allah with supernatural powers, was able to contact Prophet Muhammad and Imam Mahdi (Jesus Christ) and had been appointed by God as the leader of his time. |accessdate=21 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110628221027/http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v3/news_lite.php?id=235079| archivedate= 28 June 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

The movement, also known as Darul Arqam, started life as a relatively small group that withdrew into its own fairly remote peasant-style, self-contained community that practised strict adherence to an Islamic code and developed a home-based economy.&lt;ref name="Means"&gt;{{cite book|last=Means|first=Gordon P.|title=Political Islam in Southeast Asia|year=2009|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|isbn=978-1-58826-678-1|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, when Ashaari, who was an ex-government religious teacher, commenced a low profile ''halaqah'' (study group circle) at Datok Keramat, a Malay suburb of Kuala Lumpur.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam99"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamarulnizam|first=Abdullah|title=The Politics of Islam in Contemporary Malaysia|year=2003|publisher=Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia|isbn=978-967-942-592-5|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the group was better known as the Rumah Putih since the house where they met was painted white.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam99"/&gt; In the initial two years of its existence, the group received negative and sometimes apprehensive public response as the members stood out in their attire of white robes.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam99"/&gt; At one stage, the group was accused by its neighbourhood of being dakwah songsang which meant deviating from orthodox Islamic teachings and hence to be confronted.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam99"/&gt;  Yet the group grew and was attracting an increasing number of young Malays.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam99"/&gt;

On 28 February 1971, the group decided to change its name to Darul Arqam, in memory of a companion to Prophet Muhammad, Arqam ibn Abi Arqam, who allowed his house in Makkah to be used as the early meeting place for Muslims.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam99"/&gt;  Ashaari and his followers attempted to join other dakwah groups such as the Jamaat al-tabligh and ABIM.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam99"/&gt;  They attempted to join the former but withdrew due to methodological and philosophical differences.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam99"/&gt;  Later they joined [[Angkatan Belia Islam Malaysia|ABIM]] of which they enjoyed a cordial and friendly relationship.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam99"/&gt;  For instance, Ashaari himself was even offered a post as ABIM chief in [[Selangor]] of which he declined.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam99"/&gt;  He was later appointed ABIM chief of the dakwah bureau in the same state.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam99"/&gt;

==Sungai Pencala==

1975 marked a new and significant chapter in Al-Arqam's history when the movement moved to a new and permanent premise in five-hectare land at [[Sungai Pencala]], twenty kilometres northeast of [[Kuala Lumpur]].&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam100"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamarulnizam|first=Abdullah|title=The Politics of Islam in Contemporary Malaysia|year=2003|publisher=Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia|isbn=978-967-942-592-5|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Arqam village at Sungai Pencala did not only become the main base but also became a model of an ideal Islamic village.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam100"/&gt;  The five-hectare land encompassed a mosque, a lecture hall, domitories, offices, a school, houses and shops.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam100"/&gt;  The movement's dakwah mission became more organised and were subsequently augmented by the publication of books, magazines, newspapers, and production of audio-visual materials.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam100"/&gt;

==Membership and Structure==

Al-Arqam was an urban based movement and its membership was heavily drawn from educated [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]].&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam100"/&gt;  There was no official membership as members need not fill a form or pay a fee for one can be accepted into the fold as long as one subscribed to the rules of Islamic teachings, participated in the movement's programs and sacrificed oneself for the sake of religion, one automatically became an Arqam member.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam100"/&gt;  Hence, it is very difficult to give an accurate estimation of the membership numbers although it was estimated that prior to its ban the group had between 10,000 and 12,000 members excluding sympathies and associate members.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam100"/&gt;  It was also estimated that the movement had as many as 200,000 sympathizers.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam100"/&gt;

Many of those who joined the group were from peasant origins but it also attracted support from middle-class urban Malays, including those from the government service.&lt;ref name=Means /&gt;

Al-Arqam's organisational structure was called the Majlis Syuyukh.&lt;ref name="Kamarulnizam 2003 101"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamarulnizam|first=Abdullah|title=The Politics of Islam in Contemporary Malaysia|year=2003|publisher=Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia|isbn=978-967-942-592-5|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The administration was headed by Amir Muhammadiah, who was Ashaari himself whom in turn, was assisted by two deputies called Amir Representative One and Amir Representative Two.&lt;ref name="Kamarulnizam 2003 101" /&gt;  His three sons, Fakrul Razi (Amir's Representative 2), Mohd Nizamuddin (Assistant Representative of Principal Amir 1), Mohd Nasrullah (Deputy Amir 2) and his son-in-law Khairul Anuar Ujang (Vice Principal Amir 2) were securely placed in important positions.&lt;ref name="Kamarulnizam 2003 101" /&gt;

==Arqamnomics==

The movement was perhaps famous for its approach to economics. Arqamomics refers to Al-Arqam approach to the economy – an approach that embraces Islamic philosophies, theories and practices.&lt;ref name="Kamarulnizam 2003 101"/&gt;  The three principles undergirding Arqamnomics were not to seek excessive profits or accumulate wealth, an Islamic economy were based on human energy, natural resources, expertise, knowledge, economic thinking, effort, consistency and prayers and finally, an economy free from riba (interest), monopoly, haram (forbidden sources), unpaid loans, fraud and deception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamarulnizam|first=Abdullah|title=The Politics of Islam in Contemporary Malaysia|year=2003|publisher=Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia|isbn=978-967-942-592-5|pages=104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement attempted to build a chain of business activities locally and abroad and it was considered successful in integrating its principles in almost every aspect of its economic activities.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam106"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamarulnizam|first=Abdullah|title=The Politics of Islam in Contemporary Malaysia|year=2003|publisher=Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia|isbn=978-967-942-592-5|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Al-Arqam's main emphasis was on producing halal (permissible) food which was managed by its Department of Economic Affairs.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam106"/&gt;  For almost 16 years from 1977 to 1994, Al-Arqam's economic activities were centred on the fardu kifayah economy which included halal food and beverages, retail outlets such as mini markets, groceries and book shops and a distribution centre.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam106"/&gt;

The Arqam Group of Companies was officially launched in 1993, the movement expanded its economic activities to include commercial and strategic interests.Its technology industry, managed by the Science and Technology Department, ventured into the advanced technology by establishing Spectra Technology, a company which provided maintenance service to oil companies such as Esso Production, Shell Oil Refinery, Petronas Group of Companies and also a semi-government state utility company, Tenaga Nasional.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam106"/&gt;

Arqam's Department of Agriculture acquired 20&amp;nbsp;acres of land to set up its Agricultural Complex Training Centre at Batu Hampar, Perak.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam106"/&gt;  The Department also owned a 20-acre paddy field in Penang and a 120-acre plantation in Sabah. It land assets were valued at RM 8.9 million whereas the value of its vehicle and machinery equipment reached RM 3.7 million.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam106"/&gt;  The movement also operated businesses and own properties in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Central Asia.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam106"/&gt; In Indonesia, the movement set up soya and shoe factories at Tasik Malaya, hairdressing saloon and grocery stores in Jakarta and Medan and in Singapore, the movement ran a chain of grocery shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamarulnizam|first=Abdullah|title=The Politics of Islam in Contemporary Malaysia|year=2003|publisher=Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia|isbn=978-967-942-592-5|pages=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socio-religious Activities==

Al-Arqam was focused on missionary activities and they were pursued domestically and internationally.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam107"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamarulnizam|first=Abdullah|title=The Politics of Islam in Contemporary Malaysia|year=2003|publisher=Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia|isbn=978-967-942-592-5|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their missionary activities were performed in the form of religious discourse or talk which members or sympathizers of the movement would organise the religious discourse in their house.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam107"/&gt;  They would invite the people in the neighbourhood to attend it.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam107"/&gt;  Al-Arqam's base at Sungai Pencala would be another place to stage such religious discourses.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam107"/&gt;

The main attraction of Arqam's religious talks was it leaders’ ability, especially Ashaari, to deliver lectures which attracted thousands of people all over Peninsular Malaysia.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam107"/&gt;  Arqam's missionary activities also expanded abroad as one of their goals was to open as many branches as possible.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam107"/&gt;  According to Muhammad Syukri Salleh (1995), Al-Arqam branches were set up with largely indigenous membership in Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Brunei, Britain, France, Germany, United States of America, Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Jordan, Egypt, Uzbekistan and China.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam107"/&gt;

As technology improved, Al-Arqam's religious lectures were recorded and distributed by the movement's two companies – Tele-Video Arqam and Audio-Video-Arqam.&lt;ref name="Kamarulnizam 2003 108"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamarulnizam|first=Abdullah|title=The Politics of Islam in Contemporary Malaysia|year=2003|publisher=Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia|isbn=978-967-942-592-5|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its cassettes and videos were sold in the thousands and prior to the ban, Al-Arqam nasyid (religious songs) group, Nada Murni, were regularly screened on the government-controlled television and radio station- Radio and Television Malaysia (RTM).&lt;ref name="Kamarulnizam 2003 108" /&gt;  With regards to the print media, Al-Arqam's official newspaper was first published in July 1977 in the Jawi script with the circulation of 25,000.&lt;ref name="Kamarulnizam 2003 108" /&gt;  All these media activities were administered by the movement's Department of Information.&lt;ref name="Kamarulnizam 2003 108" /&gt;

Education was another important aspect of Al-Arqam's social activities.&lt;ref name="Kamarulnizam 2003 108" /&gt;  Administered by its Department of Guidance and Education, Al-Arqam's primary and secondary schools drew controversies as they were not formally registered with the state and had a different syllabus from the official national curriculum.&lt;ref name="Kamarulnizam 2003 108" /&gt;  It only emphasised on religious education. In 1994, the movement had 257 schools throughout Malaysia with an enrolment of 9541 students and 696 teachers.&lt;ref name="Kamarulnizam 2003 108" /&gt;  The movement also set up its own ‘university’ at Pekan Baru, Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamarulnizam|first=Abdullah|title=The Politics of Islam in Contemporary Malaysia|year=2003|publisher=Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia|isbn=978-967-942-592-5|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Arqam's social welfare model was premised on the concept of maasy (equality of income distribution based on needs).&lt;ref name="Kamarulnizam 2003 108"/&gt;  In this socialist-style arrangement, all members regardless of occupation received a salary based on needs.&lt;ref name="Kamarulnizam 2003 108"/&gt;  The nature of the job and qualification were not a factor in determining one's salary as the movement's maasy concept was based on the needs of the person concerned.&lt;ref name="Kamarulnizam 2003 108"/&gt; For example, an electrician with five children would receive a higher income than a doctor with no children.&lt;ref name="Kamarulnizam 2003 108"/&gt;  Ashaari himself articulated that the movement was trying to maintain the ukhwah Islamiah (a bond of brotherhood) which aimed to distribute resources to the underprivileged and needy.&lt;ref name="Kamarulnizam 2003 108"/&gt;

==Challenges to the state==

In 1986, the religious authorities was alarmed by Ashaari's book Aurad which claimed that Prophet Muhammad and the four caliphs not only could be met in a dream but also could be confronted physically and consciously in the real world.&lt;ref name="Kamarulnizam 2003 111"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamarulnizam|first=Abdullah|title=The Politics of Islam in Contemporary Malaysia|year=2003|publisher=Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia|isbn=978-967-942-592-5|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government's Islamic Developmental Department (Jakim) argued that some facts and arguments were misleading and could jeopardise the beliefs of the Malaysian Muslims.&lt;ref name="Kamarulnizam 2003 111" /&gt;  The National Fatwa Committee proscribed the book in 1998.&lt;ref name="means131"&gt;{{cite book|last=Means|first=Gordon P.|title=Political Islam in Southeast Asia|year=2009|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|isbn=978-1-58826-678-1|pages=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban turned into a political controversy when Ashaari refused to abide by it and challenged the decision.&lt;ref name="Kamarulnizam 2003 111"/&gt;

Ashaari decided to leave the country when the issue was debated between the religious establishments and the mainstream media.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam167"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamarulnizam|first=Abdullah|title=The Politics of Islam in Contemporary Malaysia|year=2003|publisher=Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia|isbn=978-967-942-592-5|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a tug-of-war between Al-Arqam and JAKIM as the foreign-based Ashaari challenged the religious authority to prove that he was wrong.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam167"/&gt; Although he was based abroad, several of Ashaari's books were published and circulated in Malaysia by Al-Arqam to defend the movement's position.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam167"/&gt; The movement also presented an official clarification from Islamic scholars to justify their claim and amongst the scholars were the former Mufti of Brunei, a lecturer in Islamic Studies from [[Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia]] and several religious leaders from the pondok and madrasah systems.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam167"/&gt;

The banning of the book Aurad was the beginning of a series of allegations against the movement. Accusations were also made on the widespread malpractice by the movements. According to a publication by Kedah Islamic Affairs Department, the alleged ‘unIslamic practices included the claim of Prophet Muhammad's attendance at the movement's spiritual healing service, Ashaari's claim that he could identify which member would go to heaven and Ashaari could act as the middle man to communicate with Syeikh Muhammad As-Suhaimi and in turn, the Syeikh can communicate with Prophet Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamarulnizam|first=Abdullah|title=The Politics of Islam in Contemporary Malaysia|year=2003|publisher=Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia|isbn=978-967-942-592-5|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authorities were most concerned with his ability to disseminate the idea that he was the great iman and had the ability to use magical power against the people opposing him.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam167"/&gt; To strengthen his position in the movement and to win the admiration and respect from members of Al-Arqam, Ashaari made indirect self-proclamations that he was the direct descendent of Prophet Mohammed through the Bani Tamin tribe and his followers should address him as Syeikh Abuya Iman Ashaari Muhammad At-Tamini.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam167"/&gt;

The absolute loyalty paid to Ashaari by his followers meant the leader was given a free hand to chart the social and religious discourse of the movement.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam167"/&gt; The authorities were also particularly concerned by Ashaari's alleged interpretation of the Quran that a man was initially allowed to have two, then three and finally four wives.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam169"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamarulnizam|first=Abdullah|title=The Politics of Islam in Contemporary Malaysia|year=2003|publisher=Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia|isbn=978-967-942-592-5|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was compared with the establishment's interpretation that a man was allowed to marry more than one wife only when the man was materially and physically stable and the man must love all his wives equally.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam169"/&gt; Ashaari himself had four wives and reportedly fathered nearly forty children.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam169"/&gt; The movement was also accused of performing marriages without the approval from the state Islamic affairs department.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam169"/&gt;

On a more serious note, it has been claimed that Ashaari planned to form an Islamic government in Malaysia.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam169"/&gt; The plan, according to close associates of Ashaari, was conceived from Ashaari's claims that he had regular contact with Mohammad and according to Ashaari, the prophet advised him on the eventual arrival of the Mahdi in Makkah with a caliph from Malaysia.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam169"/&gt; Ashaari saw himself as the caliph in the region's empire and divided the administration of the region into Malaysia 1 and Malaysia 2.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam170"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamarulnizam|first=Abdullah|title=The Politics of Islam in Contemporary Malaysia|year=2003|publisher=Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia|isbn=978-967-942-592-5|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysia 1 would comprise Peninsula Malaysia and the Borneo states of Sabah and Sarawak and Malaysia 2 covered Indonesia, Brunei, the Philippines and Singapore.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam170"/&gt;

Ashaari himself created further political controversy with his claim that the Prophet and himself also discussed Malaysian politics, forecasting the eventual downfall of the Mahathir government within six months to six years.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam170"/&gt; He also predicted if Malaysians go to a referendum, he would be more popular than the Prime Minister himself.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam170"/&gt; However, Ashaari denied harnessing his movement toward anti-government activities and argued that everything he did was politics and all he wanted was to see a Malaysian society which loves God and is always mindful of the hereafter.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam170"/&gt;

To add more complexities into the issue, some UMNO politicians were involved in the movement and as a result, the ruling party decided to conduct an investigation on several party leaders and members who were known to be Al-Arqam sympathizers. One MP, Tamrin Ghafar who is a son of former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Ghafar Baba, admitted he was a member of the group.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam170"/&gt; From the UMNO-led government's point of view, these revelations proved that the movement was able to penetrate into the core of the Malaysian political system and garnered considerable sympathy inside the establishment.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam170"/&gt; The government itself estimated that about 7000 civil servants were involved in the movement itself and after assessing the situation, the government decided to take action against the movement before the situation became beyond the authorities’ control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamarulnizam|first=Abdullah|title=The Politics of Islam in Contemporary Malaysia|year=2003|publisher=Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia|isbn=978-967-942-592-5|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in 1994, the National Fatwa Committee issued a religious decree against the organisation, citing the organisation as ‘deviant’ and ‘deviationist'.&lt;ref name="means132"&gt;{{cite book|last=Means|first=Gordon P.|title=Political Islam in Southeast Asia|year=2009|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|isbn=978-1-58826-678-1|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible Existence of a Revolutionary Army==

The movement's apparent radicalism first alarmed the authorities when nineteen Malaysian students of Al-Arqam were arrested in [[Cairo]] for being allegedly associating with Islamic extremist groups in Egypt and further evidence revealed that the movement was preparing for armed rebellion.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam172"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamarulnizam|first=Abdullah|title=The Politics of Islam in Contemporary Malaysia|year=2003|publisher=Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia|isbn=978-967-942-592-5|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The plan was revealed by former member Abdul Aziz Wahab who was also an ex-Malaysian Navy Assistant Chief. According to the plan, Ashaari planned to stage a coup d’état in the country and Abdul Aziz Wahab would be appointed the Minister of Defence if their plan succeeded.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam172"/&gt; Abdul Aziz Wahab developed misgivings about the plan when Ashaari suddenly decided to go for the umrah (small haj) to Mecca and he suspected should the plan fail, he would become the scapegoat while Ashaari escaped. Thus he decided to disclose the evidence to the police.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam173"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamarulnizam|first=Abdullah|title=The Politics of Islam in Contemporary Malaysia|year=2003|publisher=Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia|isbn=978-967-942-592-5|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authorities also disclosed that the movement had set up a 313-strong army called Tentera Badar believed to be trained in [[Thailand]].&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam173"/&gt;  However, Al-Arqam fiercely denied the allegations in a letter which highlighted that the accusation of the armed group being trained in Thailand implied that Thailand was supporting such an army and would undermine Thai-Malaysian relations.   The letter also stated there was no physical evidence of this claim. The Thai government, through its Ambassador to Malaysia categorically denied the existence of the alleged army.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam173"/&gt;  Yet the Malaysian government countered the denials by revealing confessions from an Al-Arqam member Irshadi Abdullah who stated that he and several other Arqam members were among the first to undergo commando training.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam173"/&gt;  In an unusual twist, a deputy minister in the Prime Minister's Department Abdul Hamid Othman later admitted that the Army of Badar did not exist in physical terms but rather it was a psychological game inculcated in the mind of the movement's members to believe it actually existed.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam173"/&gt;

The Malaysian government was able to convince the public of the danger posed by the movement by labelling Al-Arqam as a militant group and was actively exposing the deviant activities and teachings via the government-controlled media.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam174"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamarulnizam|first=Abdullah|title=The Politics of Islam in Contemporary Malaysia|year=2003|publisher=Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia|isbn=978-967-942-592-5|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was labelled a [[cult]] and was compared with the [[David Koresh]] group.&lt;ref name="kamarulnizam174"/&gt;

==Arrest of Leaders==

Finally, in September 1994, eighteen leaders were detained under the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)]].

==Attempts at Revival==

According to governmental and news reports, it was believed that former members might be trying at reviving the movement via the ‘Rufuqa’ corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malaysia: The Al-Arqam sect and its relationship with the government |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,IRBC,,MYS,3df4be7624,0.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130416025121/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,IRBC,,MYS,3df4be7624,0.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-16 |publisher=UNHCR }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This group was founded by Ashaari in Rawang in spite of being under close surveillance by the state. It had 80 businesses under its wing in Malaysia: mini markets, cafetarias, herbal products, tourism, advertising, furniture, clinics, electronic and multimedia, childcare centres and publishing.&lt;ref name="HereticalCult"&gt;"Malaysia: Heretical Islamic cult returns".

In November 2006, the Malaysian government raided the upper floor of a bakery and arrested more than 100 people believed to be attempting to revive Al-Arqam.&lt;ref name="100people" /&gt; The authorities subsequently outlawed the group in December the same year.&lt;ref&gt;"Malaysia cracks down on Islamic sect" (22 December 2006).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15416">[[Aniconism]] in [[Judaism]] covers a number of areas. The portrayal of [[YHWH]] in any kind of human or concrete form is not encouraged.
== The Tanakh ==
A number of verses in the [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Tanakh]]) refer to prohibitions against the creation of various forms of images, invariably linked directly with [[idolatry]]. The strongest over-all source is based on what [[Judaism]] counts as the second of the [[Ten Commandments]]:

:Do not have any other gods before Me. ''Do not represent [such] gods by any carved statue or picture of anything in the heaven above, on the earth below, or in the water below the land''. Do not bow down to [such gods] or worship them. I am God your Lord, a God who demands exclusive worship. Where My enemies are concerned, I keep in mind the sin of the fathers for [their] descendants, to the third and fourth [generation]. But for those who love Me and keep My commandments, I show love for thousands [of generations]. ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 20:3-6)

This prohibition is widespread. For instance, [[Leviticus]] 26:1 reads:

:[Therefore,] do not make yourselves false gods. ''Do not raise up a stone idol or a sacred pillar for yourselves.'' Do not place a kneeling stone in your land so that you can prostrate yourselves on it. I am God your Lord.

Similar injunctions appear in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 33:52, [[Deuteronomy]] 4:16, and 27:15; in all cases, the creation of the image is associated with idolatry, and indeed, the words commonly translated as "image" or some variant thereof (פסל ''pesel'', שקוץ ''shikuts'') are generally used interchangeably with words typically translated as "idol" (e.g., אליל ''elil''). (An important exception is צלם ''tselem'', used in such verses as Genesis 1:26: "let us make man in our image"; this word was not associated with idols.)

Based on these prohibitions, the Hebrew prophets, such as [[Isaiah]], [[Jeremiah]], [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]], and others, preached very strongly against idolatry. In many of their sermons, as recorded in the biblical books bearing their names, the prophets regarded the use of religious images as a negative sign of assimilation into the surrounding [[pagan]] cultures of the time. The Torah permits drawing of humans as long as they are not used for idolatry.

== The Halakha ==
Despite the semantic association with idols, [[Halakha]] ("Jewish law") as taught by the [[Shulkhan Arukh]] ("Code of Jewish Law") and practiced and applied by [[Conservative Judaism]] and [[Orthodox Judaism]] today, interprets the verses as prohibiting the creation of certain types of graven images of people, angels, or astronomical bodies, whether or not they are actually used as idols. The Shulkhan Arukh states: "It is forbidden to make complete solid or raised images of people or angels, or any images of heavenly bodies except for purposes of study".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torah.org/advanced/shulchan-aruch/classes/chapter11.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000421052058/http://www.torah.org/advanced/shulchan-aruch/classes/chapter11.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2000-04-21 |title=Shulchan-Aruch - Chapter 11 |publisher=Torah.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ("Heavenly bodies" are included here because the stars and planets were worshipped by some religions in human forms. Astronomical models for scientific purposes are permitted under the category of "study.")

[[File:Daiyyeinu manuscript.jpg|thumb| Detail of ''[[Dayenu]]'' in the [[Birds' Head Haggadah]]]]
An authoritative breakdown can be found in the ''Shulkhan Arukh,'' section ''yoreh deah'' which takes the literal meaning of פסל ''pesel'' as "graven image" (from the root פסל P-S-L, "to engrave." See Exodus 34:1, 4; Deuteronomy 10:1, 3.) The prohibition is therefore seen as applying specifically to certain forms of sculpture and depictions of the human face. In keeping with this prohibition, some illustrations from the [[Middle Ages]] feature [[fantasy|fantastic]] creatures&amp;mdash;usually animal-headed [[humanoid]]s, even when the depictions are quite clearly meant to be those of historical or [[mythology|mythological]] humans. The most well-known is the [[Birds' Head Haggadah]] (Germany, circa 1300). Because such creatures as [[Griffin|gryphons]], [[harpy|harpies]], [[sphinx|sphinxes]], and the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] do not actually exist, no violation of the prohibition is perceived in such depictions. This is based on the fact that the Second Commandment, as stated in Exodus, refers specifically to "anything in the heaven above, on the earth below, or in the water below the land." However, it is forbidden to make the four faces on the Divine Chariot (Ezekiel× I) or the ministering angels, because these are believed to be real beings that actually exist "in the heaven above." (''Kitzur Shulkhan Arukh'' 168:1)

== Differences across media ==
Although the prohibition applies mainly to sculpture, there are some authorities who prohibit two-dimensional full-face depictions. Some base this upon their understanding of the [[Talmud]], and others based it upon [[Kabbalah]]. Of note is the portrait of Rabbi [[Tzvi Ashkenazi]] (known as "the Hakham Tzvi"), which is housed in the Jewish Museum in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishmuseum.org.uk/ jewishmuseum.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Based his interpretation of this prohibition, the Hakham Tzvi refused to sit for his portrait. However, the London Jewish Community wanted a portrait, so they commissioned the portrait to be done without the Hakham Tzvi's knowledge. The Hakham Tzvi's son, Rabbi [[Jacob Emden]], says it was a perfect likeness.

Additionally, there is one type of representation, namely, [[bas-relief]] or raised representation on a flat surface, that is particularly problematic. Rabbi [[Jacob Emden]] discusses a medal struck in honor of Rabbi [[Eliezer Horowitz]] that features Horowitz's portrait. Emden ruled this violated the injunction against depictions. Furthermore, many hold that such representations in the synagogue either violate this injunction or are not permitted, as they give the appearance of violating this injunction. Most notably, Rabbi David ibn Zimra and Rabbi [[Joseph Karo]] hold that carvings of lions (e.g., representing the [[Lion of Judah]]) are inappropriate in synagogues.

On the other hand, some authorities hold that Judaism has no objection to photography or other forms of two-dimensional art, and depictions of humans can be seen in religious books such as the [[Passover]] [[Haggadah]], as well as children's books about biblical and historical personages. Although most Hasidic Jews object to having televisions in their homes, this is not related to prohibitions against idolatry, but, rather, to the content of network and cable programming. Hasidim of all groups regularly display portraits of their [[Rebbe]]s, and, in some communities, the children trade "rabbi cards" that are similar to baseball cards. In both [[Hasidic]] and [[Orthodox Judaism]], taking photographs or filming are forbidden on the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] and [[Jewish holiday|Jewish holy days]], but this prohibition has nothing to do with idolatry. Rather, it is related to the prohibition against [[39 categories of activity prohibited on Shabbat|working or creating]] on these days.

== In historical periods ==
[[File:Dura Europos fresco Jews cross Red Sea.jpg|thumb|''Crossing the Red Sea'', from [[Dura Europos synagogue]], with two [[Hand of God (art)|Hands of God]], 3rd century]]

In practice, many Jews throughout history have either accepted more permissive interpretations of the prohibition, or partly ignored it. Many [[art historian]]s have long believed that there was a tradition in antiquity, with no surviving examples, of luxury [[illuminated manuscript]] [[scroll]]s of books from the Tanakh among [[Hellenized]] Jews. The evidence for this is Christian works of the [[Late Antique]] and [[Early Medieval]] periods whose [[iconography]] is thought to derive from works in this tradition. Examples of the later works include the [[Joshua Roll]] and, more controversially, the [[Utrecht Psalter]].

Nonetheless, the discovery in 1932 of the 3rd century [[Dura-Europos synagogue]] in [[Syria]] came as a considerable surprise, as it has large areas of wall-paintings with figures of the prophets and others, and narrative scenes. There are several representations of the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]], suggesting that this motif reached [[Christian art]] from Judaism. A virtually unique Christian [[mosaic]] depiction of the ''[[Ark of the Covenant]]'' (806) at [[Germigny-des-Prés]], which includes the hand, is believed also to be derived from Jewish iconography; the Ark also appears at Dura-Europos.&lt;ref&gt;The only ancient Jewish image of the Ark appears to be at Dura-Europos though it also appears as the oldest Jewish bible illustrations surviving, from the 10th century (see Beckwith) {{cite book| last = Beckwith| first = John| title = Early Medieval Art| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JswUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA291| year = 1988| publisher = Brill Archive| isbn = 90-04-08115-1| pages = 14–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several ancient synagogues in [[Israel]] have also been excavated, revealing large floor-mosaics with figurative elements, especially animals and Hellenistic representations of the [[Zodiac]]. However, some of these, notably that at [[Naaran]] in the [[West Bank]], have had the living figures removed, leaving inanimate symbols such as the [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] intact.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, 1018-1021&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that this was done by the Jewish community in the 6th or early 7th century, as part of a controversy within Judaism over images that paralleled that within Christianity leading to the [[Byzantine iconoclasm]], leading to a stricter attitude towards images, at least in synagogues. There is also evidence that from about 570 new synagogue mosaics were aniconic. An alternative explanation for the removals is that they were done after the Muslim Conquest, and related to the decree of Caliph [[Yazid II]] in 721 (although this referred to Christian images).&lt;ref&gt;Barber, throughout.&lt;/ref&gt; The decoration of the cave walls and [[sarcophagi]] at the Jewish cemetery at [[Beit She'arim National Park|Beit She'arim]] also uses images, some drawn from Hellenistic pagan mythology, in the 2nd to 4th centuries CE.

There are many later Jewish illuminated manuscripts from the Middle Ages, and some other works with human figures. The "Birds Head [[Haggadah]]" (German, now in Jerusalem) gives all the human figures the heads of birds, presumably in an attempt to mitigate any breach of the prohibition.

== In modern times ==
Although, in biblical times, Jews were actively [[iconoclasm|iconoclasts]], physically tearing down and destroying idols of other religions located within their political jurisdiction, today there is more tolerance for other cultures. In the state of [[Israel]], all religious sites, Jewish and non-Jewish alike, are protected by law. Even though Jewish Law teaches that idolatry is forbidden to all of humanity as one of the seven [[Noahide Laws]], Jews today combat it through discussion, debate, and education, rather than the physical destruction of statues and shrines. However, most traditional Jews still follow the prohibitions against entering places of idolatry, and will not attend functions held in buildings where there are religious statues.

== Recent scholarship ==
In a refutation of the belief in an aniconic Judaism, and more generally in an underestimation of Jewish visual arts, the historian of ideas Kalman Bland recently proposed that the phenomenon is a modern construction, and that "Jewish aniconism crystallized simultaneously with the construction of modern Jewish identities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/chapters/i6833.pdf |title=(Bland 2001:8) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have also argued that the notion of a total prohibition of figural representation in the Biblical and Hellenistic-Roman periods is untenable.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Gutmann: "The 'Second Commandment' and the image in Judaism." In ''[[Hebrew Union College Annual]]'' 32 (1961) 161-174. [= Id.: ''Sacred images: Studies in Jewish art from Antiquity to the Middle Ages.'' [Collected studies series, CS 303]. Northampton 1989. II. 161-174].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Gutmann: "Recent literature on Jewish art: a critical appraisal." In ''Jewish Book Annual'' 25 (5728/1967-1968) 167-169. See also Gabrielle Sed-Rajna’s contribution to this volume.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 20th century, Judaism was believed always to have been aniconic. The view was probably first challenged by [[David Kaufmann|Dávid Kaufmann]], who marshalled a large and comprehensive corpus of data in order to prove it untenable. He was the first to use the term “Jewish art” in an article published in 1878, and is regarded as the founder of the scholarly discipline of [[Jewish culture#Visual arts and architecture|Jewish art history]]. His disciple Dr. Samuel Krauss wrote in 1901:

{{quote|As late as ten years ago it would have been absurd to speak about a Jewish art. It is Kaufmann's own merit to have uncovered this art. Not only did he have to prove that such an art existed, he also had to prove that it could exist, as he showed that the idea that the prohibition of images would obstruct the development of such an art was mistaken, and even established it as an irrefutable fact that the art in wide areas was not prohibited insofar as no worship was associated with it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kaufmann.mtak.hu/en/study01.htm Dávid Kaufmann and his collections] Library of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Original source: Dr. Samuel Krauss: ''David Kaufmann. Eine Biographie,'' p. 45. Berlin 1901 (1902). "Noch vor zehn Jahren wäre es absurd gewesen, von einer jüdischen Kunst zu sprechen. Diese Kunst entdeckt zu haben, ist Kaufmann's eigenstes Verdienst. Nicht nur mußte er beweisen, daß eine solche Kunst existire, er mußte auch beweisen, daß sie existiren könne, indem er die Meinung, als stehe das Bilderverbot der Kunstentfaltung im Judenthum im Wege, als irrig erwies, er es vielmehr als unwiderlegbare Thatsache hinstellte, daß die Kunst auf flachem Raume nie verboten war, insofern kein Götzendienst sich daran knüpfte."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1965, he was appointed as a first-division clerk in the social welfare department but he quit the job and moved to [[Shikaripura]] where he joined as a clerk at Veerabhadra Shastri's Shankar rice mill. In 1967, Yeddyurappa married Mythradevi, the daughter of the rice mill owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Fascinating journey of a reformist | date = 27 February 2010 | url = http://hindu.com/2010/02/27/stories/2010022754460400.htm | work = [[The Hindu]] | accessdate=23 October 2010 | location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later set up a hardware shop in [[Shivamogga]].

==Political career==

Having been associated with the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] from his college days, Yeddyurappa's public service began when he was appointed as Karyavaha (Secretary) of the Sangh's Shikaripur unit in 1970. In 1972, he was elected to the Shikaripura Town Municipality and was also appointed as the President of the Taluk unit of the [[Jana Sangh]].&lt;ref name="family"/&gt; In 1975, he was elected President of the Town Municipality of Shikaripura. He was imprisoned during the [[Emergency in India]] and lodged in the [[Bellary]] and [[Shimoga]] jails. In 1980, he was appointed President of the Shikaripura taluk unit of the BJP and later went on to become the president of BJP's [[Shimoga district]] unit in 1985. In 1988, he became the State President of the BJP in [[Karnataka]]. He was first elected to the lower house of the Karnataka Legislature in 1983 and has since represented the [[Shikaripura]] constituency six times. He has been a member of the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, Twelfth and Thirteenth Legislative Assemblies (lower house) of Karnataka. Following the 1994 state assembly elections, he became the Leader of Opposition in the [[Karnataka Legislative Assembly]]. In 1999, he lost the elections but was nominated by the BJP to become a member of the legislative council (upper house) of Karnataka.&lt;ref name="legis"/&gt; Again, he was re-elected in 2004 and became the [[Leader of Opposition]] in the [[Karnataka Legislative Assembly]] during the chief ministership of [[Dharam Singh]].&lt;ref name="bsy1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Yediyurappa elected BJP leader in Assembly|url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/06/10/stories/2004061009290400.htm|newspaper=The Hindu|date=10 June 2004|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first stint in power when he helped was [[Janata Dal (Secular)]] leader [[H. D. Kumaraswamy]] to bring down the coalition government headed by [[Dharam Singh]] and form an alternative government with BJP. An agreement was made between the JD(S) and BJP, which specified that H. D. Kumaraswamy would be the Chief Minister for the first 20 months, after which Yeddyurappa would become the Chief Minister for the remaining 20 months. Yeddyurappa became the Deputy Chief Minister as well as the finance minister in Kumaraswamy's Government.&lt;ref name="bsy5"&gt;{{cite news|title=JD(S), BJP form coalition Government in Karnataka|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/02/04/stories/2006020412230100.htm|newspaper=The Hindu|date=3 February 2006|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in October 2007, when it was Yeddyurappa's turn to become [[Chief Minister]], Kumaraswamy refused to relinquish his post. This forced Yeddyurappa and all the ministers from his party to resign and on 5 October, the BJP formally withdrew the support to the Kumaraswamy government.&lt;ref name="bsy2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kumaraswamy not to step down; BJP Ministers submit resignations|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/10/03/stories/2007100359470100.htm|newspaper=The Hindu|date=3 October 2007|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karnataka came under President's rule which was revoked on 7 November as the JD(S) and the BJP decided to bury their differences and this paved the way for Yeddyurappa to become the Chief Minister of Karnataka. Yeddyurappa was sworn in as the 25th Chief Minister of Karnataka on 12 November 2007.&lt;ref name="bsy3"&gt;{{cite news|title=Yeddyurappa sworn in Chief Minister|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/11/13/stories/2007111353640100.htm|newspaper=The Hindu|date=12 November 2007|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, JD(S) refused to support his government over disagreement on sharing of ministries which resulted in his resignation as [[Chief Minister]] on 19 November 2007.&lt;ref name="bsy4"&gt;{{cite news|title=Yeddyurappa quits rather than face trust vote|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/11/20/stories/2007112058950100.htm|newspaper=The Hindu|date=November 20, 2007|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Karnataka's [[Karnataka state assembly elections, 2008|2008 Assembly election]]s, Yeddyurappa contested from [[Shikaripura]] against former Chief Minister [[S. Bangarappa]] of the [[Samajwadi Party]]. The [[Indian National Congress]] and JD(S) backed Bangarappa, but despite this, Yeddyurappa won the seat by a margin of more than 45,000 votes.&lt;ref name="bsy7"&gt;{{cite news|title=Yeddyurappa humbles Bangarappa|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/05/26/stories/2008052656080300.htm|newspaper=The Hindu|date=26 May 2008|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also led the BJP to a historic victory in the state and [[Karnataka]] became the gateway for the BJP in south India.&lt;ref name="bsy6"&gt;{{cite news|title=BJP set to form government in Karnataka|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/05/26/stories/2008052657700100.htm|newspaper=The Hindu|date=26 May 2008|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took the oath of office as Chief Minister on 30 May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abclive.in/abclive_regional/yeddyurappa-karnataka-cm.html ABC Live – Online News, Breaking News, World News, National News, India News, Abc News – Yediyurappa Takes Oath as Karnataka CM]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, BJP re-appointed him as the President of Karnataka state [[BJP]] unit. He was BJP's CM candidate in [[Karnataka Legislative Assembly election, 2018]].

During the aftermath of the [[Karnataka Legislative Assembly election, 2018|2018 Karnataka Legislative assembly elections]], Yeddurappa was invited to form the government and become the Chief Minister by the Governor citing that his party was the single largest in the house with 104 seats(8 short of majority in the assembly).

==Controversies ==

Court cases and Outcome :-

In five cases issued in 2011, Yeddyurappa was alleged to be responsible for Illegal de-notification of land. He was jailed during this term and was convicted of corruption.The Karnataka High-court in 2015 set aside this order, thereby quashing the cases against him. After the high court quashed former governor HR Bhardwaj’s sanction to prosecute BS Yeddyurappa, a special Lokayukta court struck down four other FIRs against him. In a major relief to Yeddyurappa and BJP, Karnataka High Court had set aside the sanction given by then Governor HR Bhardwaj for his prosecution in several cases of alleged illegal de-notification of land, and asked the incumbent Vajubhai Vala to have a fresh look at it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151125/nation-current-affairs/article/karnataka-high-court-quashes-land-case-against-b-s-yeddyurappa|title=Karnataka High Court quashes land case against B S Yeddyurappa|date=2015-11-25|work=deccanchronicle.com/|access-date=2017-12-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The High Court said{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}:"Non-consideration of the relevant matters made the order of sanction illegal and resulted in failure of justice. We are thus of the opinion that the exercise of the power by the Governor was not in accordance with well-settled principles for sanctioning prosecution. We accordingly set aside the order of sanction, dated January 21, 2011, and remit the matter back to his Excellency, the Governor for reconsideration in the light of our discussions above."

Yeddyurappa was arrested&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icarelive.com/exclusive/news.php?cat_id=2&amp;article_id=32929 |title=Bangalore : Yeddyurappa arrested for corruption, sent to jail |publisher=ICARE Live |date=15 October 2011 |accessdate=7 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021075553/http://www.icarelive.com/exclusive/news.php?cat_id=2&amp;article_id=32929 |archive-date=21 October 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the evening of 15 Oct 2011, hours after the Lokayukta court issued an arrest warrant in two cases of corruption for illegally denotifying land in and around Bangalore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-Karnataka chief minister of BS Yeddyurappa surrenders|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/nation/ex-karnataka-chief-minister-bs-yeddyurappa-surrenders-in-jail/articleshow/10369523.cms|publisher=Economic Times|accessdate=16 October 2011 |date=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-10-16/india/30286160_1_bs-yeddyurappa-b-y-vijayendra-yeddyurappa-denotifying | work=The Times of India |title=Before surrendering, Yeddyurapp |date=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he was granted bail on 8 November 2011 after spending 23 days in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/yeddyurappa-gets-bail-will-leave-jail-soon-147825 |title=Yeddyurappa gets bail, will leave jail soon |publisher=Ndtv.com |date=8 November 2011 |accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in March 2012, the [[High Court of Karnataka]] quashed the FIR registered against him regarding the Mining . A division bench of high court of Karnataka passed the order stating that "Suspicion cannot be a ground to tarnish the image and reputation of a person who is holding a Constitutional post. Even during the course of argument, a specific question was put to Lokayukta counsel to produce any material to connect the petitioner for alleged offences, but he was mum and did not indicate any favours shown by Yeddyurappa as the chief minister to any mining company".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/bangalore/report_big-relief-for-yeddyurappa-as-hc-quashes-fir-in-mining-case_1659579 |title=Big relief for Yeddyurappa as HC quashes FIR in mining case – Bangalore – DNA |publisher=Dnaindia.com |date=7 March 2012 |accessdate=8 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In May 2012, the Supreme Court, temporarily stayed the case on this matter and ordered an official CBI enquiry, to be completed within three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3407658.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Probe Yeddyurappa's role in illegal mining, Supreme Court tells CBI | date=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Phase==

===`Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan===
[[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book ''[[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]''. The eighth and twelfth of the tablets mentioned [[Africa]] and were written on April 19, 1916 and February 15, 1917, respectively. Publication however was delayed in the United States until 1919—after the end of the [[World War I|First World War]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. The tablets were translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on April 4, 1919, and published in ''[[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]]'' magazine on December 12, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Abbas | first = `Abdu'l-Bahá |others=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab (trans. and comments) | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url =http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá mentions Bahá'ís traveling "...especially from America to Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia, and travel through Japan and China. Likewise, from Germany teachers and believers may travel to the continents of America, Africa, Japan and China; in brief, they may travel through all the continents and islands of the globe"&lt;ref name="ToDP8"/&gt; and " ...the anthem of the oneness of the world of humanity may confer a new life upon all the children of men, and the tabernacle of universal peace be pitched on the apex of America; thus Europe and Africa may become vivified with the breaths of the Holy Spirit, this world may become another world, the body politic may attain to a new exhilaration...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1991 |title = Tablets of the Divine Plan |edition = Paperback |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, IL |isbn = 0-87743-233-3 |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/TDP/tdp-12.html.iso8859-1 | pages = 82–89 |origyear = 1916-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shoghi Effendi]], head of the religion after the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá, and his wife, [[Rúhíyyih Khanum]] may have been the first Bahá'ís to visit Congo when they drove across the eastern part of the country in 1940.&lt;ref name="50th"/&gt;

===Establishment of the community===
In 1953 [[Shoghi Effendi]] planned an international teaching plan termed the [[Ten Year Crusade]]. This was during a period of wide scale growth in the religion across [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] near the end of the period of [[Colonisation of Africa]].&lt;ref name="UofC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview Of World Religions |work=General Essay on the Religions of Sub-Saharan Africa |publisher=Division of Religion and Philosophy, [[University of Cumbria]] |url=http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/sub/geness.html |accessdate=2008-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209082606/http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/sub/geness.html |archivedate=2007-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1953, colonial authorities of what was then the [[Belgian Congo]] did not permit the promotion of religion by Bahá'í [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] however [[Ali Nakhjavani]] and his wife, Violette, driving across Africa from the growing Bahá'í community in Uganda, were able to take a Ugandan Bahá'í Samson Mungongo to the city of [[Kamina]] where he settled and began to teach the religion&lt;ref name="50th"/&gt; while suffering hostility, suspiciousness and superstition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Victories Outweigh Hardships as Faith Advances in Central and East Africa |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1962 | issue = 371 |pages=8–9 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first converts were Louis Selemani, Remy Kalonji, and Valerien Mukendi - they, with a dozen pioneers from Europe, North America and other parts of Africa, and Congolese who had become Bahá'ís in Rwanda and Burundi who moved back to their home provinces - all these formed the basis of the quickly growing community.&lt;ref name="50th"/&gt;

In April 1956 the Bahá'í Faith was present in small numbers across countries of middle Africa. To administer these communities a regional National Spiritual Assembly was elected in Central and East Africa to cover them.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt;  The first [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] was elected in 1957.&lt;ref name="50th"/&gt;

===Growth and opposition===
The Eastern Belgian Congo, as part of the experience across central Africa west to east and to the south began to have qualities of mass conversion. In the areas under the jurisdiction of the regional National Assembly of South and West Africa, south of Congo, there was a gain of over sixty percent in the total number of adherents of the Faith just in 1959, and rates like this continued for a few more years. [[Pygmies]] in Congo were among the converts in 1961, one of whom was a delegate to the election of the regional assembly in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Khanum | first = Rúhíyyih | authorlink = Rúhíyyih Khanum | title = The Ministry of the Custodians | publisher = World Centre Publications | year = 1992 | location = Haifa, Israel | pages = 188, 220, 305, 361, 366 | url = http://bahai-library.com/uhj_ministry_custodians | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-85398-350-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Circa 1961 Bahá'í sources indicate about 1000 members. By the spring of 1962 there was widespread knowledge of many more Bahá'ís and about November 1962 the National Spiritual Assembly of Central and West Africa was claiming over 14,000 people had converted to the religion.&lt;ref name="mass"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Mass Conversion in the Congo |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1962 | issue = 380 |pages=8–9 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1963 local assemblies were in 143 localities.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; The majority of growth happened in the province of [[Kivu]]&lt;ref name="report"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Report from Zaire |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1973 | issue = 512 |pages=5–9 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major growth was announced as early as 1962. Later some also occurred in the province of [[Katanga Province|Shaba]] in the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Around the World; Zaire; Pioneers lead active life in Lubumbashi |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1977 | issue = 559 |pages=10–11 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the community grew from about 5 individuals to enough to support 25 local assemblies in 1973.

Following the death of Shoghi Effendi, the elected [[Universal House of Justice]] was head of the religion and began to re-organized the Bahá'í communities of Africa by splitting off national communities to form their own National Assemblies from 1967 though the 1990s.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; From January to March 1970 [[Hand of the Cause]] [[Rúhíyyih Khanum]] crossed Africa from east to west visiting many of these country's communities including the Congo, meeting with individuals and institutions both Bahá'í and civic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Hand of the Cause of God Rúhíyyih Khanum Travels Six Thousand Miles Across Africa |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1970 | issue = 209 |pages=3–18 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first National Spiritual Assembly of Zaire (current name of the country) formed in 1970 during this trip.&lt;ref name="50th"/&gt; Rúhíyyih Khanum's second visit was in January 1972 and traveled almost 3,000 miles through central and southern Zaire by river boat and automobile.

====Kivu====
Members of the Bahá'í Faith first entered the Province of [[Kivu]] about November 1959&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title =Teacher Promulgates Faith in Belgian Congo |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1960 | issue = 512 |pages=5–9 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Bahá'í Faith in Uganda|Uganda]] where the religion had grown quickly.&lt;ref name="report"/&gt; Whole villages turned out to listen to presentations on the religion and growth continued through the 1960s. After visiting Zaire a couple times in the 1970s a third visit by Rúhíyyih Khanum in late 1972 focused on the province of Kivu where the majority of Bahá'ís of Zaire were to be found - some 600 assemblies being elected across some 30,000 Bahá'ís in 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title =From Nairobi to Kabimba; The Great Safari part twenty-two |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1973 | issue = 512 |pages=5–9 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; (compared to about 3000 Bahá'ís in the rest of the Congo at the same time.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = News of Zaire by Pioneer |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1972 | issue = 498 | page =18 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact most of these Bahá'ís in Kivu were in the southern half of the province, or modern day [[South Kivu]].&lt;ref name="report"/&gt; In the Kivu region in a five-year period in the 1970s there were 9 women's conferences under the authority of assemblies or committees of assemblies, institutes were developed to train over 100 teachers for [[Bahá'í schools]] that were sanctioned by the government educational bureau.

====Restricted and freedom====
However, as part of a sweep across several [[Sub-Saharan]] countries, the Bahá'í Faith was banned in the 1970s in several countries: [[Burundi]], 1974; [[Mali]] 1976; [[Bahá'í Faith in Uganda|Uganda]] 1977; Congo&lt;!-- while this source simply states Congo see below for reformation of National Assembly--&gt;, 1978; [[Bahá'í Faith in Niger|Niger]], 1978.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"This was principally the result of a campaign by a number of Arab countries. Since these countries were also by this time providers of development aid, this overt attack on the Baha'is was supported by covert moves such as linking the aid money to a particular country to the action that it took against the Baha'is. This was partially successful and a number of countries did ban the Baha'is for a time. However, the Baha'is were able to demonstrate to these governments that they were not agents of [[Zionism]] nor [[Islamophobia|anti-Islamic]] and succeeded in having the ban reversed in all of these countries except Niger."&lt;ref name="survey"/&gt; See also [[Allegations of Bahá'í involvement with other powers]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Baraat''' ({{lang-hi|बरात}}; {{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|برات}}}}) is a groom's [[wedding]] procession in [[North India]], [[West India]] and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="thehindu2009jsd"&gt;{{Citation | title=The marriage parties | date=2009-07-03 | accessdate=2010-06-17 | isbn= | publisher= | newspaper=The Hindu | url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/life/2009/07/03/stories/2009070350020100.htm| quote=''... bands are routinely hired for the baraat&amp;nbsp;— a tradition in India where the groom rides a decorated horse to the wedding ceremony, accompanied by relatives and friends dancing to the music of the band ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="malik2006"&gt;{{Citation | title=Culture and customs of Pakistan | author=Iftikhar Haider Malik | year=2006 | isbn=0-313-33126-X | publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GQTABKAGaVgC| quote=''... The groom comes back again with a procession (baraat) and at this time the bride finally departs with him ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North Indian communities, it is customary for the [[groom|bridegroom]] to travel to the wedding venue (often the [[bride]]'s house) on a [[mare]], accompanied by his family members.&lt;ref name="thehindu2009jsd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pandita2003"&gt;{{Citation | title=Jammu &amp; Kashmir (Volume 25 of People of India: State Series) |author1=K.

The ''baraat'' can become a large procession, with booking its own [[musical band|band]], [[dance]]rs, and [[budget]]. The groom and his horse are covered in finery and do not usually take part in the dancing and singing; that is left to the "''baraatis''" or people accompanying the procession. The groom usually carries a sword.&lt;ref name="pandita2003"/&gt; The term ''baraati'' is also more generically used to describe any invitee from the groom's side. Traditionally, ''baraatis'' are attended to as guests of the bride's family.

The ''baraat'', headed by a display of fireworks and accompanied by the rhythm of the [[dhol]], reaches the meeting point, where the elders of both the families meet. In North Indian Hindu weddings, the groom is greeted with garlands and [[aarti]]. In traditional North Indian weddings, ''baraats'' are welcomed at the wedding venue with the sound of ''[[shehnai]]s'', which are considered auspicious at weddings by Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs alike.&lt;ref name="falzon2004"&gt;{{Citation | title=Cosmopolitan connections: the Sindhi diaspora, 1860-2000 | author=Mark-Anthony Falzon | year=2004 | isbn=90-04-14008-5 | publisher=BRILL | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ljbS-I5Y8WMC | quote=''... the shehnai (a wind instrument widely used by musicians at weddings and such auspicious occasions) ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Punjabi baraat==
Both men and women participate in the procession of a [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] ''baraat''. Close male relatives of both the bride and groom always wear turbans, which indicates honor. When the ''baraat'' arrives at the wedding venue, a ceremony known as the ''milni'' (literally, ''meeting'' or ''merger'') is carried out, in which equivalent relatives from the groom and bride's sides greet each other.&lt;ref name="matane2004"&gt;{{Citation | title=India: a splendour in cultural diversity |author1=Paulias Matane |author2=M.L.

==Rajput baraat==
A [[Rajput]] ''baraat''  was consisted entirely of male members but now female members also give company. The bridegroom is usually dressed in a gold [[achkan]], with an orange [[turban]] and a [[churidar]] or [[jodhpurs]] with [[jooti]]s. The baraat members also must wear [[achkan]]s or [[sherwani]]s with jodhpurs and safas (colorful turbans). The procession to the bride's house looks rather regal as there is absolutely no dancing on the streets by the baraatis. In fact, all members, including the groom who rides an elephant or a female horse, carry swords. The horse is important for the Rajputs.
The Milni

A simple ceremony takes place and both families exchange well wishes on meeting each other. This is followed by light snacks and tea before the religious ceremony begins.

A mother &amp; daughter enjoy the moment. 	
One by one designated family members exchange garlands and a hug.

The groom distributes Karah Prashad (ceremonial sacremental pudding) to his family.

Everyone then enjoys a grand feast.

A '''''bhikkhu''''' ([[Pali]]; [[Sanskrit]]: '''''bhikṣu''''') is an ordained male monastic ("[[monk]]") in [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="buddhanet"&gt;[http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhistworld/layguide.htm Lay Guide to the Monks' Rules]&lt;/ref&gt; Male and female monastics ("[[nun]]", ''[[bhikkhuni]]'', Sanskrit ''bhikṣuṇī'') are members of the [[Sangha|Buddhist community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buswell|first=Robert E., ed.|title=Encyclopedia of Buddhism (Monasticism)|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|year=2004||isbn=0-02-865718-7|page=556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lives of all Buddhist monastics are governed by a set of rules called the [[prātimokṣa]] or [[patimokkha|pātimokkha]].&lt;ref name="buddhanet"/&gt; Their lifestyles are shaped to support their spiritual practice: to live a simple and meditative life and attain [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.dhammadana.org/sangha/monks.htm What is a bhikkhu?]&lt;/ref&gt;

A person under the age of 20 cannot be ordained as a bhikkhu or bhikkhuni but can be ordained as a [[samanera|śrāmaṇera or śrāmaṇērī]].

==Definition==
''Bhikkhu'' literally means "[[beggar]]" or "one who lives by [[dāna|alms]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Buddhist Dictionary, Manual of Buddhist Terms and Doctrines'' by [[Nyanatiloka]] Mahathera.&lt;/ref&gt; The historical Buddha, Prince Siddhartha, having abandoned a life of pleasure and status, lived as an alms [[mendicant]] as part of his [[śramaṇa]] lifestyle. Those of his more serious students who renounced their lives as householders and came to study full-time under his supervision also adopted this lifestyle. These full-time student members of the [[sangha]] became the community of ordained monastics who wandered from town to city throughout the year, living off alms and stopping in one place only for the [[Vassa]], the rainy months of the monsoon season.

In the ''[[Dhammapada]]'' commentary of [[Buddhaghoṣa]], a bhikkhu is defined as "the person who sees danger (in samsara or cycle of rebirth)" (Pāli: {{IAST|''Bhayaṃ''}} ''ikkhatīti: bhikkhu''). He therefore seeks [[ordination]] to obtain release from it.&lt;ref name="vows"&gt;[http://www.palyul.org/eng_about_monasticvows.htm Resources: Monastic Vows]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Dhammapada]]'' states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Buddharakkhita|first=Acharya|title=Dhammapada XIX&amp;nbsp;— Dhammatthavagga: The Just|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/dhp/dhp.19.budd.html|publisher=Access To Insight|accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|[266-267] He is not a monk just because he lives on others' alms. Not by adopting outward form does one become a true monk.  Whoever here (in the Dispensation) lives a holy life, transcending both merit and demerit, and walks with understanding in this world&amp;nbsp;— he is truly called a monk.}}
For historical reasons, the full [[bhikkhuni|ordination of women]] has been unavailable to [[Theravada]] and [[Vajrayana]] practitioners, although recently the full ordination for women has been reintroduced to many areas.

==Historical terms in Western literature==
[[File:Xbonzefarmer.jpg|thumb|A bonze farmer]]
In [[English language|English]] literature before the mid-20th century, Buddhist monks were often referred to by the term ''bonze'', particularly when describing monks from East Asia and French Indochina. This term is derived [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[French language|French]] {{etymology|ja|bonsō|priest, monk}}. It is rare in modern literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=bonze Dictionary.com: bonze]&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhist monks were once called ''talapoy'' or ''talapoin'' {{etymology|fr|talapoin}}, itself {{etymology|pt|talapão}}, ultimately {{etymology|mnw|tala pōi|our lord}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wordreference.com/definition/talapoin |title= talapoin |accessdate= June 23, 2013 |author=  |date=  June 23, 2013 |format=  |work= Collins Concise English Dictionary © HarperCollins Publishers |publisher= WordReference.com |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= Etymology: 16th Century: from French, literally: Buddhist monk, from Portuguese talapão, from Mon tala pōi our lord ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Roberts|1837|p=237}}{{quote|The Talapoys cannot be engaged in any of the temporal concerns of life; they must not trade or do any kind of manual labour, for the sake of a reward; they are not allowed to ''insult'' the earth by digging it. Having no tie, which unites their interests with those of the people, they are ready, at all times, with spiritual arms, to enforce obedience to the will of the sovereign.| [[Edmund Roberts (diplomat)|Edmund Roberts]], ''Embassy to the eastern courts of Cochin-China, Siam, and Muscat''{{sfn|Roberts|237}}}}

The [[talapoin]] is a monkey named after Buddhist monks just as the [[capuchin monkey]] is named after the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin]] (who also are the origin of the word [[cappuccino]]).

Theravada monasticism is organized around the guidelines found within a division of the [[Pāli Canon]] called the ''[[Vinaya Pitaka]]''. Laypeople undergo ordination as a novitiate (śrāmaṇera or sāmanera) in a rite known as the "going forth" (Pali: ''[[pabbajja]]''). Sāmaneras are subject to the [[Five Precepts#Ten Precepts|Ten Precepts]]. From there full ordination (Pali: ''[[upasampada]]'') may take place. Bhikkhus are subject to a much longer set of rules known as the [[Patimokkha in Theravada Buddhism|Pātimokkha]] (Theravada) or [[Prātimokṣa]] (Mahayana and [[Vajrayana]]).

===Mahayana===
[[File:Young monks of Drepung.jpg|thumbnail|250px|Tibetan monks engaging in a traditional monastic debate.]]
In the Mahayana monasticism is part of the system of "vows of individual liberation".&lt;ref name="vows"/&gt; These vows are taken by monks and nuns from the ordinary sangha, in order to develop personal ethical discipline.&lt;ref name="vows"/&gt;  In [[Mahayana]] and Vajrayana, the term "sangha" is, in principle, often understood to refer particularly to the ''aryasangha'' ({{bo|w=mchog kyi tshogs}}), the "community of the noble ones who have reached the first [[Bhūmi (Buddhism)|bhūmi]]". These, however, need not be monks and nuns.

The vows of individual liberation are taken in four steps. A lay person may take the five [[Upāsaka and Upāsikā|upāsaka and upāsikā]] vows ({{bo|w=dge snyan (ma)}} "approaching virtue"). The next step is to enter the [[pabbajja]] or monastic way of life (Skt: ''pravrajyā'', {{bo|w=rab byung}}), which includes wearing monk's or nun's robes. After that, one can become a samanera or samaneri "novice" (Skt. ''śrāmaṇera'', ''śrāmaṇeri'', {{bo|w=dge tshul, dge tshul ma}}). The last and final step is to take all the vows of a bhikkhu or bhukkhuni "fully ordained monastic" (Sanskrit: ''bhikṣu, bhikṣuṇī'', {{bo|w=dge long (ma)}}).

Monastics take their vows for life but can renounce them and return to non-monastic life&lt;ref name="howto"&gt;[http://en.dhammadana.org/sangha/monks/become.htm how to become a monk?]&lt;/ref&gt; and even take the vows again later.&lt;ref name="howto"/&gt; A person can take them up to three times or seven times in one life, depending on the particular practices of each school of discipline; after that, the sangha should not accept them again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ddc.shengyen.org/cgi-bin/ccdd/show.py?s=05-05p0064 05-05《律制生活》p. 0064]&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, Buddhism keeps the vows "clean". It is possible to keep them or to leave this lifestyle, but it is considered extremely negative to break these vows.

In [[Tibet]], the upāsaka, pravrajyā and bhikṣu ordinations are usually taken at ages six, fourteen and twenty-one or older, respectively.

===Robes===
{{main|Kasaya (clothing)}}
[[File:Ta Prohm Monk - Siem Reap.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Cambodia]]n monk in his robes]]
[[File:Jardin des Plantes May 2009.jpg|thumb|250px|Two monks in orange robes]]

The special dress of ordained people, referred to in English as [[robe]]s, comes from the idea of wearing a simple durable form of protection for the body from weather and climate. In each tradition there is uniformity in the colour and style of dress. Colour is often chosen due to the wider availability of certain pigments in a given geographical region. In Tibet and the Himalayan regions (Kashmir, Nepal and Bhutan) red is the preferred pigment used in the dying of robes. In Burma, reddish brown; In India, Sri Lanka and South-East Asia various shades of yellow, ochre and orange prevail. In China, Korea, Japan and Vietnam grey or black is common. Monks often make their own robes from cloth that is donated to them.&lt;ref name="buddhanet"/&gt;

The robes of Tibetan novices and monks differ in various aspects, especially in the application of "holes" in the dress of monks. Some monks tear their robes into pieces and then mend these pieces together again. [[Upāsaka and Upāsikā|Upāsakas]] cannot wear the "chö-göö", a yellow tissue worn during teachings by both novices and full monks.

In observance of the [[Kathina|Kathina Puja]], a special Kathina robe is made in 24 hours from donations by lay supporters of a temple. The robe is donated to the temple or monastery, and the resident monks then select from their own number a single monk to receive this special robe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/kariyawasam/wheel402.html#ch6 Buddhist Ceremonies and Rituals of Sri Lanka], A.G.S. Kariyawasam&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additional vows in the Mahayana and Vajrayana traditions===
In Mahayana traditions, a Bhikṣu may take additional vows not related to ordination, including the [[Bodhisattva vow]]s, [[samaya]] vows, and others, which are also open to laypersons in most instances.

==Japan and Korea==
[[Saichō]] petitioned for a [[Mahayana]] ordination platform to be built in Japan. Permission was granted seven days after his death.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism, Soka Gakkai, 'Dengyo'&lt;/ref&gt; and the platform was completed in 827 by his disciple, Gishin.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Saichō believed the 250 precepts were for the [[Śrāvakayāna]] and that ordination should use the [[Bodhisattva Precepts#Brahma Net Sutra|Mahayana precepts]] of the ''[[Brahmajala Sutra (Mahayana)|Brahmajala Sutra]]''. He stipulated that monastics remain on [[Mount Hiei]] for twelve years of isolated training and follow the major themes of the 250 precepts: celibacy, non-harming, no intoxicants, vegetarian eating and reducing labor for gain. After twelve years, monastics would then use the Vinaya precepts as a provisional, or supplemental, guideline to conduct themselves by when serving in non-monastic communities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Tendai]] monastics followed this practice.

During Japan's [[Meiji Restoration]] during the 1870s, the government abolished celibacy and vegetarianism for Buddhist monastics in an effort to secularise them and promote the newly created [[State Shinto]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/shinto/history/history_1.shtml#section_4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buddhanet.net/nippon/nippon_partII.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese Buddhists]] won the right to proselytize inside cities, ending a five-hundred year ban on clergy members entering cities.&lt;ref name="clark"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Donald N.|title=Culture and customs of Korea|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2000|isbn=978-0-313-30456-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2016}}

Currently, priests (lay religious leaders) in Japan choose to observe vows as appropriate to their family situation. Celibacy and other forms of abstaining are generally "at will" for varying periods of time.

After the [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910]], when Japan annexed Korea, Korean Buddhism underwent many changes. [[Jōdo Shinshū]] and [[Nichiren Buddhism|Nichiren schools]] began sending missionaries to [[Korea under Japanese rule]], and new sects formed there such as [[Won Buddhism]]. The Temple Ordinance of 1911 ({{korean|hanja=寺刹令|hangul=사찰령}}) changed the traditional system whereby temples were run as a collective enterprise by the Sangha, replacing this system with Japanese-style management practices in which temple abbots appointed by the [[Governor-General of Korea]] were given private ownership of temple property and given the rights of inheritance to such property.&lt;ref name="soren"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sorensen|first=Henrik Hjort|title=Asian perceptions of nature|editor=Ole Bruun |editor2=Arne Kalland |editor3=Henrik Hjort Sorensen|publisher=Nordic Institute of Asian Studies|year=1992|isbn=978-87-87062-12-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, monks from pro-Japanese factions began to adopt Japanese practices, by marrying and having children.&lt;ref name="soren"/&gt;

In Korea, the practice of celibacy varies. The two sects of [[Korean Seon]] divided in 1970 over this issue; the [[Jogye Order]] is fully celibate while the [[Taego Order]] has both celibate monastics and non-celibate Japanese-style priests.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7231">{{About||the 2014 film|Boychoir (film)}}
A '''boys' choir''' is a [[choir]] primarily made up of [[choirboy]]s who have yet to begin [[puberty]] or are in the early to middle stages of [[puberty]] and so retain their more highly pitched childhood [[voice type]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Herbert |last=Moller |title=Voice Change in Human Biological Development |journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary History |year=1985 |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=239–253 |doi=10.2307/204176 |pmid=11617364 |publisher=The MIT Press |jstor=204176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of a boys' choir are technically known as ''trebles'' and often termed [[boy soprano]]s," although occasionally some boys sing in the [[alto]] range. Some boys' choirs of churches or cathedrals are further supported by older male voices singing [[tenor]] and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]]; these singers are sometimes former choirboys.

==Middle ages &amp; early development==
[[Image:Wiltener Saengerknaben Rochuskirche Wien 2008.jpg|thumb|The [[Wilten Boys' Choir]], one of the oldest boys' choirs in Europe. Six boys from this choir were used to found the Vienna Boys' Choir by Maximilian I.]]
Boys' choirs, as a [[Western World]] cultural tradition, developed in the [[Middle Ages]]. Boys were then responsible for contributing a treble sound to [[Anglican church music|church music]], since women were typically barred from the performance of [[sacred music]] in a public (gender mixed) context. Some of the oldest existing boys' choirs&amp;mdash;such as the [[Vienna Boys' Choir]]&amp;mdash;trace their roots back to this time.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In 1498, more than half a millennium ago, [[Emperor Maximilian I]] moved his court and his court musicians from [[Innsbruck]] to [[Vienna]]. He gave specific instructions that there were to be six boys among his musicians. For want of a foundation charter, historians have settled on 1498 as the official foundation date of the Vienna Hofmusikkapelle and&amp;mdash;in consequence&amp;mdash;the Vienna Boys' Choir. Until 1918, the choir sang exclusively for the court, at mass, at private concerts and functions and on state occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Vienna Boys' Choir |url=http://www.wsk.at/jart/prj3/wsk_website/main.jart?rel=en&amp;content-id=1184916523214&amp;reserve-mode=active |access-date=2008-05-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927143916/http://www.wsk.at/jart/prj3/wsk_website/main.jart?rel=en&amp;content-id=1184916523214&amp;reserve-mode=active# |archive-date=2011-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==20th century==
Today, church traditions with strong roots in the Middle Ages (in particular, [[Anglican]], [[Catholic]], [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] and [[Lutheran]] churches) continue to host many boys' choirs. The Anglican church is particularly well known for its contributions to choral [[work of art|works]] and [[arrangement]]s for boys' voices. However, the general inclusion of female voices in church music since the mid-1800s has significantly reduced the importance of boys' choirs as church institutions. Many present boys' choirs were either founded or reconstituted during the first half of the 20th century as independent concert choirs. In 1917 an article in ''[[The Musical Quarterly]]'' identified - and criticized - a trend toward the foundation of many boys' choirs in the USA, which the author derided as the "boy choir fad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=N. Lindsay |last=Norden |title=The Boy Choir Fad |journal=The Musical Quarterly |year=1917 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=189–197 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |jstor=738084 |doi=10.1093/mq/iii.2.189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 }}

==Contemporary developments==
Various factors contributed to a subsequent decline of boys' choirs.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} A general societal tendency away from choral singing was certainly a contributing factor.{{According to whom|date=November 2014}} More specifically, gender exclucivism has led to certain reservations about "males only" choirs{{According to whom|date=November 2014}} &amp;mdash; as have instances of [[sexual misconduct]] in some choirs and [[choir school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/Story?id=1779814&amp;page=1 |title=Sex Abuse Scandal Haunts Harlem Boys Choir |accessdate=2009-03-01 |publisher=[[ABC news]] |date=2006-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Choirboy |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/features/12061/ |accessdate=2009-03-02 |publisher=[[New York Magazine]] |date=2005-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Irrelevant citation|date=November 2014}} Moreover, since the age of onset of puberty has sunk, boys' choirs can no longer expect to retain a majority of their singers through the age of 16 or 17&amp;mdash;as was the case when [[Bach]] wrote complex [[cantata]]s for the male treble. Boys' voices now break, on average, by the age of 13.5,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Disorders of Puberty |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/990700ap/209.html |accessdate=2009-03-02 |publisher=[[AAFP]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to higher choir turnover rates and limiting the complexity of a choir's musical repertoire. This (early) loss of the singer's treble voice has proven frustrating for successful boy singers and contributes to negative perceptions of the boys' choir experience{{According to whom|date=November 2014}}{{Speculation-inline}}, for example as popularized by the 1960s Disney film ''[[Almost Angels]]''.

Boys' choirs offer boys and their families with an active point of entrance into [[music education|music and vocal training]]. They can also help to foster discipline, high standards and cultural awareness, as well as providing strong [[peer group]]s oriented around children who identify themselves with a choir's cultural and ethical values.&lt;ref&gt;cf. [http://www.boyschoirofharlem.org/CAH/studentachieve.htm The Choir Academy of Harlem], displaying outstanding student achievement&lt;/ref&gt; A greater awareness of the value of gender-specific youth work may also support the positive contributions of boys choirs.

Many choirs also provide choir alumni with extensive opportunities - often coupled with continued [[vocal coach]]ing - to support their vocal transition to altos, tenors and basses and to stimulate their continued artistic development.

[[Image:Buddhist Monk Window Bhutan.jpeg|thumb|upright|right|Bhutanese Buddhist monk looking out the window of a monastery.]]
{{MahayanaBuddhism}}
'''Buddhism''' is the most widely practiced religion in '''Bhutan'''. [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhism]] is the [[state religion]] of [[Bhutan]], and Buddhists comprise two-thirds to three-quarters and Hinduism one-quarter of its [[Demographics of Bhutan|population]].&lt;ref name="State department"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| title =International Religious Freedom Report 2007 - Bhutan| work =| publisher =[[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]]| date =2007-09-14| url =https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90227.htm| accessdate =2008-01-06  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Buddhism practiced in Bhutan originated in [[Tibetan Buddhism]], it differs significantly in its [[ritual]]s, [[liturgy]], and [[Buddhist monastery|monastic]] organization. The state religion has long been supported financially by the government through annual subsidies to [[Buddhist monastery]], [[Buddhist shrine|shrines]], [[Buddhist monk|monks]], and [[nuns]]. In the modern era, support of the state religion during the reign of [[Jigme Dorji Wangchuck]] includes the manufacture of 10,000 gilded bronze images of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], publication of elegant calligraphied editions of the 108-volume [[Kangyur]] (Collection of the Words of the Buddha) and the 225-volume [[Tengyur]] (Collection of Commentaries), and the construction of numerous ''chorten'' ([[stupa]]s) throughout the country. Guaranteed representation in the National Assembly and the Royal Advisory Council, Buddhists constitute the majority of society and are assured an influential voice in public policy.

== Organizations ==

In 1989 some 1,000 [[monk]]s (''lam'', or ''gelong'', novices) belonged to the [[Dratshang Lhentshog|Central Monastic Body]] in [[Thimphu]] and [[Punakha]], and some 4,000 monks belonged to district monastic bodies. The hierarchy is headed by the [[Je Khenpo]], who was assisted by five ''lopons'' or masters, each in charge of religious tradition, liturgy, lexicography, or logic and university. The ''lonpon'', one of whom, the Dorji Lonpon, normally succeeded the current Je Khenpo, had under them religious administrators and junior monastic officials in charge of art, music, and other areas. [[Gelugpa]] monks were celibate, but [[Nyingmapa]]s consist of not only monks but also householders, allowing them to marry, raise families, and work in secular occupations while performing liturgical functions in temples and homes. In all, there were some 12,000 monks in Bhutan in the late 1980s. There were also active congregations of nuns, but no figures were readily available. The majority of Bhutan's Buddhists are adherents of the [[Drukpa Lineage|Drukpa]] subsect of the [[Kagyu|Kargyupa]] (literally, oral transmission) school, one of the four major schools of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

Since July 2002, Menjong Chöthün Tshogpa, currently a nationwide non-profit organization in Bhutan, has been formed by Truku Jigme Chödrag Rinpoche 70th Kyabje Dorjechang, known as the Supreme Dharma King or His Holiness of Bhutan, mainly to preserve the indigenous Buddha's Teachings as their age-old culture and tradition. Subsequently Trizin Tsering Rimpoche was enthroned as the chairman by Truku Jigme Chödrag Rinpoche since June 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhadordenma.org/founder.php Founder of the Buddha Dordenma Image Foundation: His Eminence Trizin Tsering His Eminence Bhutan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hHepCbeJjI His Eminence Trizin Tsering Rimpoche - YouTube&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2004, Trizin Tsering Rimpoche founded the Buddha Dordenma Image Foundation, under the patronage of Truku Jigme Chödrag Rinpoche, with an aim to fulfill a former prophecy in a [[Terma (Buddhism)|terma]] of Guru [[Padmasambhava]] to bestow blessings on world peace and glorious happiness through the currently running [[Buddha Dordenma statue|Buddha Dordenma]] Project.

===The Zhabdrung===

Prior to 1907, the highest Buddhist leader in [[Bhutan]] was the [[Zhabdrung Rinpoche|Zhabdrung]], a [[tulku]] who is seen as the reincarnation of Bhutan's founder. His formal activity to benefit all sentient beings is destined to occur in seven lives, each with his own prophecy.

== Monasteries ==

[[Monasteries]] and [[convents]] are common in Bhutan. Both monks and nuns keep their heads shaved and wear distinguishing maroon robes. Their days are spent in study and meditation but also in the performance of rituals honoring various [[bodhisattvas]], praying for the dead, and seeking the intercession of bodhisattvas on behalf of the ill. Some of their prayers involved [[Buddhist chant|chants]] and singing accompanied by [[conch shell]] trumpets, trumpets made from human thighbones, metal horns up to three meters long, large standing drums and cymbals, hand bells, temple bells, gongs, and wooden sticks. Such monastic music and singing, not normally heard by the general public, has been reported to have "great virility" and to be more melodious than its Tibetan monotone counterparts. Common people do practice the religion in their own ways: day to day works, in their speech, in their thought and visiting the holy place and persons on holy dates (holy dates are the 8, 10, 15, 25, 28 and 30th day in a month in Bhutanese calendar).

== Buildings and objects ==

To bring Buddhism to the people, numerous symbols and structures are employed. Religious [[monument]]s, prayer walls, [[prayer flag]]s, and sacred [[mantra]]s carved in stone hillsides are prevalent. Among the religious monuments are [[chorten]], the Bhutanese version of the Indian stupa. They range from simple rectangular "house" chorten to complex edifices with ornate steps, doors, domes, and spires. Some are decorated with the Buddha's eyes that see in all directions simultaneously. These earth, brick, or stone structures commemorate deceased kings, Buddhist saints, venerable monks, and other notables, and sometimes they serve as [[reliquaries]]. Prayer walls are made of laid or piled stone and inscribed with Tantric prayers. Prayers printed with woodblocks on cloth are made into tall, narrow, colorful prayer flags, which are then mounted on long poles and placed both at holy sites and at dangerous locations to ward off demons and to benefit the spirits of the dead. To help propagate the faith, itinerant monks travel from village to village carrying portable shrines with many small doors, which open to reveal statues and images of the Buddha, bodhisattavas, and notable [[lama]]s.

== Bön in Bhutan ==

Before the introduction of Buddhism, [[Bön]] religion was prevalent in Bhutan. Imported from Tibet and India, perhaps in the eighth century, Bön doctrine became so strongly reinvigorated by Buddhism that by the eleventh  and twelfth century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism|page=235|first=Bibhuti|last=Baruah}}&lt;/ref&gt; it reasserted itself as an independent school apart from Buddhism. Bön continues to be practiced in modern Bhutan.

'''Saint Catherine of Siena''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Third Order of Saint Dominic|TOSD]]}} (25 March 1347 – 29 April 1380), was a [[Third order|tertiary]] of the [[Dominican Order]] and a [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] [[philosopher]] and [[theologian]] who had a great influence on the [[Catholic Church]]. She is declared a saint and a doctor of the Church.

Born in [[Siena]], she grew up there and wanted very soon to devote herself to [[God]], against the will of her parents. She joined the Sisters of the Penance of [[St. Dominic]] and made her vows. She made herself known very quickly by being marked by mystical phenomena such as [[stigmata]] and [[mystical marriage]].&lt;ref name="Classen2012p86"&gt;{{cite book|author=Constance Classen|title=The Deepest Sense: A Cultural History of Touch|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c1RC8kSUfgEC&amp;pg=PA86 |year=2012|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-09440-8|pages=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She accompanied the chaplain of the Dominicans to the pope in [[Avignon]], as ambassador of [[Florence]], then at war against the pope. Her influence with [[Pope Gregory XI]] played a role in his decision to leave Avignon for [[Rome]]. She was then sent by him to negotiate peace with Florence. After Gregory XI's death and peace concluded, she returned to Siena. She dictated to secretaries her set of spiritual treatises ''The Dialogue of Divine Providence''.

The [[Western Schism|Great Schism of the West]] led Catherine of Siena to go to Rome with the pope. She sent numerous letters to princes and cardinals to promote obedience to [[Pope Urban VI]] and defend what she calls the "vessel of the Church." She died on 29 April 1380, exhausted by her penances. Urban VI celebrated her funeral and burial in the [[Basilica of Santa Maria sopra Minerva]] in Rome.

The devotion around Catherine of Siena developed rapidly after her death. She was canonized in 1461, declared [[patron saint]] of Rome in 1866, and of [[Italy]] in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haegen|first1=Anne Mueller von der|last2=Strasser|first2=Ruth F.|title=Art &amp; Architecture: Tuscany|date=2013|publisher=H.F.Ullmann Publishing|location=Potsdam|isbn=978-3-8480-0321-1|page=334|chapter=St. Catherine of Siena: Mystic, Politician, and Saint}}&lt;/ref&gt; First woman declared "doctor of the Church" on 4 October 1970 by [[Pope Paul VI]] with [[Teresa of Ávila]], she was proclaimed patron saint of [[Europe]] in 1999 by [[Pope John Paul II]]. She is also the patron saint of journalists, media, and all communication professions, because of her epistolary work for the papacy.

Catherine of Siena is one of the outstanding figures of medieval Catholicism, by the strong influence she has had in the history of the papacy. She is behind the return of the Pope from Avignon to Rome, and then carried out many missions entrusted by the pope, something quite rare for a simple nun in the [[Middle Ages]].

Her writings—and especially ''The Dialogue'', her major work which includes a set of treatises she would have dictated during ecstasies—mark theological thought. She is one of the most influential writers in Catholicism, to the point that she is one of only four women to be declared a doctor of the Church. This recognition by the Church consecrates the importance of her writings.

Since 18 June 1939, Catherine of Siena has been one of the two patron saints of Italy, together with [[Francis of Assisi]].&lt;ref name=Vatican&gt;{{it icon}} [[Pope Pius XII]], [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/briefs/documents/hf_p-xii_brief_19390618_patroni-italia_it.html ''Pontifical Brief'', 18 June 1939].&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 October 1970, she was proclaimed a [[Doctor of the Church]] by Pope Paul VI,&lt;ref name=Vatican1&gt;{{it icon}} [https://w2.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/it/homilies/1970/documents/hf_p-vi_hom_19701003.html ''Proclamation to Doctor of the Church'', Homily, 4 October 1970].&lt;/ref&gt; and on 1 October 1999, Pope John Paul II named her as one of the six patron saints of Europe, together with [[Benedict of Nursia]], [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]], [[Bridget of Sweden]] and [[Edith Stein]].&lt;ref name=Vatican2&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/motu_proprio/documents/hf_jp-ii_motu-proprio_01101999_co-patronesses-europe_en.html ''Proclamation of the Co-Patronesses of Europe'', Apostolic Letter, 1 October 1999]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141120054044/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/motu_proprio/documents/hf_jp-ii_motu-proprio_01101999_co-patronesses-europe_en.html |date=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vatican3&gt;[https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:EQVninoe8UwJ:https://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/homilies/1999/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_13111999_st-bridget.html++%22Saint+Bridget,+whom+I+recently+chose+to+proclaim+a+Co-Patroness+of+Europe,+together+with+Saint+Catherine+of+Siena+and+Saint+Teresa+Benedicta+of+the+Cross%22&amp;hl=en ''Liturgical Feast of St. Bridget'', Homily, 13 November 1999].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
[[File:House Catherine Siena Apr 2008.jpg|thumb|left|The house of Saint Catherine in [[Siena]]]]

Caterina di Giacomo di Benincasa was born on 25 March 1347 in [[Black Death]]-ravaged [[Siena]], Italy, to Lapa Piagenti, the daughter of a local poet, and Giacomo di Benincasa, a cloth dyer who ran his enterprise with the help of his sons.&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;{{cite web |URL=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03447a.htm |title=St. Catherine of Siena |publisher=newadvent.org |accessdate=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The house where Catherine grew up is still in existence. Lapa was about forty years old when she gave premature birth to twin daughters Catherine and Giovanna. She had already borne 22 children, but half of them had died. Giovanna was handed over to a [[wet-nurse]] and died soon after.  Catherine was nursed by her mother and developed into a healthy child. She was two years old when Lapa had her 25th child, another daughter named Giovanna.{{sfn|Skårderud|2008|p=411}} As a child Catherine was so merry that the family gave her the pet name of "Euphrosyne", which is Greek for "joy" and the name of an [[Euphrosyne of Alexandria|early Christian saint]].&lt;ref name=crawley&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/CATSIENA.HTM ''Lives of Saints''], John J. Crawley &amp; Co., Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catherine is said by her confessor and biographer [[Raymond of Capua]] [[Dominican Order|O.P.]]'s ''Life'' to have had her first vision of Christ when she was five or six years old: She and a brother were on the way home from visiting a married sister when she is said to have experienced a vision of [[Christ in Majesty|Christ seated in glory]] with the [[Apostles]] [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]], and [[John the Apostle|John]]. Raymond continues that at age seven, Catherine vowed to give her whole life to God.&lt;ref name=crawley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raymond of Capua, ''Legenda Major'' I, iii.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Catherine was sixteen, her older sister Bonaventura [[death in childbirth|died in childbirth]]; already anguished by this, Catherine soon learned that her parents wanted her to marry Bonaventura's widower. She was absolutely opposed and started a strict fast. She had learned this from Bonaventura, whose husband had been far from considerate but his wife had changed his attitude by refusing to eat until he showed better manners. Besides fasting, Catherine further disappointed her mother by cutting off her long hair as a protest against being overly encouraged to improve her appearance to attract a husband.&lt;ref name=foley&gt;[http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/saint.aspx?id=1368 Foley O.F.M., Leonard. ''Saint of the Day, Lives, Lessons, and Feast''], (revised by Pat McCloskey O.F.M.), Franciscan Media, {{ISBN|978-0-86716-887-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Св Екатерина сиенская Ораторио Санта Катерина Neroccio.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Statuette]] by [[Neroccio di Bartolomeo de' Landi]], (1475)]] 
Catherine would later advise Raymond of Capua to do during times of trouble what she did now as a teenager: "Build a cell inside your mind, from which you can never flee." In this inner cell she made her father into a representation of Christ, her mother into the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], and her brothers into the [[Apostle (Christian)|apostles]]. Serving them humbly became an opportunity for spiritual growth. Catherine resisted the accepted course of marriage and motherhood on the one hand, or a [[nun]]'s veil on the other. She chose to live an active and prayerful life outside a convent's walls following the model of the Dominicans.&lt;ref name=bellitto&gt;[http://www.americancatholic.org/Messenger/Nov1999/feature2.asp#F5 Bellitto, Christopher M., "10 Great Catholics of the Second Millennium", ''St. Anthony Messenger'']&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually her father gave up and permitted her to live as she pleased.

A vision of [[Saint Dominic]] gave strength to Catherine, but her wish to join his Order was no comfort to Lapa, who took her daughter with her to the baths in [[Bagno Vignoni]] to improve her health. Catherine fell seriously ill with a violent rash, fever and pain, which conveniently made her mother accept her wish to join the "Mantellate", the local association of Dominican [[Third order|tertiaries]].&lt;ref name="Siena. Available Means 2001"&gt;Catherine of Siena. Available Means. Ed. Joy Ritchie and Kate Ronald. Pittsburgh, Pa.: University of Pittsburgh Press, 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Lapa went to the Sisters of the Order and persuaded them to take in her daughter. Within days, Catherine seemed entirely restored, rose from bed and donned the black and white habit of the [[Third Order of Saint Dominic]]. Catherine received the habit of a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] tertiary from the [[friar]]s of the order after vigorous protests from the tertiaries themselves, who up to that point had been only widows. As a tertiary, she lived outside the convent, at home with her family like before. The Mantellate taught Catherine how to read, and she lived in almost total silence and solitude in the family home.&lt;ref name="Siena. Available Means 2001"/&gt;

Her custom of giving away clothing and food without asking anyone's permission cost her family significantly, but she requested nothing for herself. By staying in their midst, she could live out her rejection of them more strongly. She did not want their food, referring to the table laid for her in Heaven with her real family.{{sfn|Skårderud|2008|pp=412–413}} 
[[File:Giovanni di Paolo The Mystic Marriage of Saint Catherine of Siena.jpg|thumb|left|[[Giovanni di Paolo]], ''The Mystic Marriage of Saint Catherine of Siena'']]

According to [[Raymond of Capua]], at the age of twenty-one (c. 1368), Catherine experienced what she described in her letters as a "[[Bridal theology|Mystical Marriage]]" with [[Jesus]],{{sfn|Raymond of Capua|2003|pp=99–101}} later a popular subject in art as the ''[[Mystic marriage of Saint Catherine]]''. [[Caroline Walker Bynum]] explains one surprising and controversial aspect of this marriage that occurs both in artistic representations of the event and in some early accounts of her life: "Underlining the extent to which the marriage was a fusion with Christ's physicality [...] Catherine received, not the ring of gold and jewels that her biographer reports in his bowdlerized version, but the ring of [[Holy Prepuce|Christ's foreskin]]."&lt;ref name="Bynum"&gt;{{cite book|title=Holy Feast and Holy Fast.

Her early pious activities in Siena attracted a group of followers, women and men, who gathered around her.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;

As social and political tensions mounted in Siena, Catherine found herself drawn to intervene in wider politics. She made her first journey to [[Florence]] in 1374, probably to be interviewed by the Dominican authorities at the General Chapter held in Florence in May 1374, though this is controverted (if she was interviewed, then the absence of later evidence suggests she was deemed sufficiently orthodox).&lt;ref name=foley/&gt; It seems that at this time she acquired Raymond of Capua as her confessor and spiritual director.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 5}}

After this visit, she began travelling with her followers throughout northern and central Italy advocating reform of the clergy and advising people that repentance and renewal could be done through "the total love for God."{{sfn|Hollister|Bennett|2002|p=342}} In Pisa, in 1375, she used what influence she had to sway that city and [[Lucca]] away from alliance with the anti-papal league whose force was gaining momentum and strength. She also lent her enthusiasm towards promoting the launch of a new crusade. It was in Pisa in 1375 that, according to Raymond of Capua's biography, she received the [[stigmata]] (visible, at Catherine's request, only to herself).{{sfn|Noffke, p. 5}}
{{Christian mysticism}}
Physical travel was not the only way in which Catherine made her views known. From 1375{{sfn|Noffke, p. 5}} onwards, she began dictating letters to scribes.&lt;ref name="Siena. Available Means 2001"/&gt; These letters were intended to reach men and women of her circle, increasingly widening her audience to include figures in authority as she begged for peace between the republics and principalities of Italy and for the return of the [[Papacy]] from [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon]] to [[Rome]]. She carried on a long correspondence with [[Pope Gregory XI]], asking him to reform the [[clergy]] and the administration of the [[Papal States]].

Towards the end of 1375, she returned to Siena, to assist a young political prisoner, Niccolò di Tuldo, at his execution.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 5}}&lt;ref&gt;Letter T273, written by Catherine to Raymond, probably in June 1375, describes the event.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1376 Catherine went to [[Avignon]] as ambassador of the [[Republic of Florence]] to make peace with the Papal States (on 31 March 1376 Gregory XI had placed Florence under interdict). She was unsuccessful and was disowned by the Florentine leaders, who sent ambassadors to negotiate on their own terms as soon as Catherine's work had paved the way for them.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 5}} Catherine sent an appropriately scorching letter back to Florence in response.&lt;ref&gt;Letter 234 in Tommaseo's numbering.&lt;/ref&gt; While in Avignon, Catherine also tried to convince Pope Gregory XI, the last [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon Pope]], to return to Rome.{{sfn|Hollister|Bennett|2002|p=343}} Gregory did indeed return his administration to Rome in January 1377; to what extent this was due to Catherine's influence is a topic of much modern debate.&lt;ref&gt;See Bernard McGinn, ''The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism'', (Herder &amp; Herder, 2012), p561.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catherine returned to Siena and spent the early months of 1377 founding a women's monastery of strict observance outside the city in the old fortress of Belcaro.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 6}} She spent the rest of 1377 at Rocca d'Orcia, about twenty miles from Siena, on a local mission of peace-making and preaching. During this period, in autumn 1377, she had the experience which led to the writing of her ''Dialogue'' and learned to write, although she still seems to have chiefly relied upon her secretaries for her correspondence.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This experience is recorded in Letter 272, written to Raymond in October 1377.&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in 1377 or early in 1378 Catherine again travelled to Florence, at the order of Gregory XI, to seek peace between Florence and Rome. Following Gregory's death in [[Western Schism|March 1378 riots]], the revolts of the [[Ciompi]], broke out in Florence on 18 June, and in the ensuing violence she was nearly assassinated. Eventually, in July 1378, peace was agreed between Florence and Rome; Catherine returned quietly to Florence.

In late November 1378, with the outbreak of the [[Western Schism]], the new Pope, [[Urban VI]], summoned her to Rome. She stayed at Pope Urban VI's court and tried to convince nobles and cardinals of his legitimacy, both meeting with individuals at court and writing letters to persuade others.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 6}}

For many years she had accustomed herself to a rigorous abstinence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/CSIENA.HTM Butler, Alban. ''The Lives or the Fathers, Martyrs and Other Principal Saints'', Vol. IV, D. &amp; J. Sadlier, &amp; Company, (1864)]&lt;/ref&gt; She received the Holy [[Eucharist]] almost daily. This extreme fasting appeared unhealthy in the eyes of the clergy and her own sisterhood. Her confessor, Blessed Raymond, ordered her to eat properly. But Catherine claimed that she was unable to, describing her inability to eat as an ''infermità'' (illness). From the beginning of 1380, Catherine could neither eat nor swallow water. On February 26 she lost the use of her legs.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 6}}

Catherine died in Rome, on 29 April 1380, at the age of thirty-three,&lt;ref name=dictionary&gt;{{cite book |last=Farmer|first=David Hugh|title=The Oxford dictionary of saints|year=1997|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=0-19-280058-2|pages=93|edition=4.}}&lt;/ref&gt; having eight days earlier suffered a massive stroke which paralyzed her from the waist down. Her last words were, "Father, into Your Hands I commend my soul and my spirit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caffarini|first1=Tommaso|title=Libellus de supplemento: legende prolixe virginis beate Catherine de Senis|url=https://books.google.fr/books/about/Libellus_de_supplemento.html?id=2SIGHAAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of her life==
There is some internal evidence of Catherine's personality, teaching and work in her nearly four hundred letters, her ''Dialogue'', and her prayers.

Much detail about her life has also, however, been drawn from the various sources written shortly after her death in order to promote her cult and canonisation. Though much of this material is heavily [[Hagiography|hagiographic]], it has been an important source for historians seeking to reconstruct Catherine's life. Various sources are particularly important, especially the works of Raymond of Capua, who was Catherine's spiritual director and close friend from 1374 until her death, and himself became [[Master of the Order of Preachers|Master General]] of the Order in 1380. Raymond began writing what is known as the ''Legenda Major'', his ''Life'' of Catherine, in 1384, and completed it in 1395.

Another important work written after Catherine's death was ''Libellus de Supplemento'' (''Little Supplement Book''), written between 1412 and 1418 by Tommaso d'Antonio Nacci da Siena (commonly called Thomas of Siena, or Tommaso Caffarini): the work is an expansion of Raymond's ''Legenda Major'' making heavy use of the notes of Catherine's first confessor, Tommaso della Fonte (notes that do not survive anywhere else). Caffarini later published a more compact account of Catherine's life, entitled the ''Legenda Minor''.

From 1411 onwards, Caffarini also co-ordinated the compiling of the ''Processus'' of Venice, the set of documents submitted as part of the process of [[canonisation]] of Catherine, which provides [[Christian testimony|testimony]] from nearly all of Catherine's disciples. There is also an anonymous piece entitled "Miracoli della Beata Caterina" (''Miracle of Blessed Catherine''), written by an anonymous Florentine. A few other relevant pieces survive.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 2}}

==Works==
[[File:Caterina - Libro della divina dottrina, circa 1475 - 2367969.jpg|thumb|'' Libro della divina dottrina'' (commonly known as ''The Dialogue of Divine Providence''), c.1475]]
[[File:L'epistole della serafica vergine s. Caterina da Siena.tif|thumb|''L'epistole della serafica vergine s. Caterina da Siena'' (1721)]]

Three genres of work by Catherine survive:
* Her major treatise is ''The Dialogue of Divine Providence''. This was probably begun in October 1377, and was certainly finished by November 1378. Contemporaries of Catherine are united in asserting that much of the book was dictated while Catherine was in ecstasy, though it also seems possible that Catherine herself may then have re-edited many passages in the book.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 13}} It is a dialogue between a soul who "rises up" to God and God himself.
* Catherine's letters are considered one of the great works of early Tuscan literature. Many of these were dictated, although she herself learned to write in 1377; more than 300 have survived. In her letters to the Pope, she often addressed him affectionately simply as ''Babbo'' ("Daddy"), instead of the formal form of address  "Your Holiness". Other correspondents include her various confessors, among them [[Raymond of Capua]], the kings of France and Hungary, the infamous mercenary [[John Hawkwood]], the Queen of Naples, members of the [[Visconti family]] of Milan, and numerous religious figures. Approximately one third of her letters are to women.
* 26 prayers of Catherine of Siena also survive, mostly composed in the last eighteen months of her life.

==Theology==
Catherine's theology can be described as [[Christian mysticism|mystical]], and was employed towards practical ends for her own spiritual life or those of others.&lt;ref&gt;Noffke, Suzanne. "Catherine of Siena." In Medieval Holy Women in the Christian Tradition c. 1100-c. 1500. Alastair J. Minnis and Rosalynn Voaden, eds. Turnhout: Brepols, 2010. 613.&lt;/ref&gt; She used the language of medieval [[scholastic philosophy]] to elaborate her experiential mysticism.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Kenelm. "St Catherine's Teaching on Christ." Life of the Spirit (1946–1964) 16, no. 187 (1962): 313. {{JSTOR|43705923}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Interested mainly with achieving an incorporeal union with God, Catherine practiced extreme fasting and [[Ascetical theology|asceticism]], eventually to the extent of living solely off the Eucharist every day.&lt;ref&gt;Finnegan, Mary Jeremy. "Catherine of Siena: The Two Hungers." Mystics Quarterly 17, no. 4 (1991): 173–80. {{JSTOR|20717082}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For Catherine, this practice was the means to fully realize her [[Agape|love of Christ]] in her mystical experience, with a large proportion of her [[Religious ecstasy|ecstatic visions]] relating to the consumption or rejection of food during her life.&lt;ref&gt;Noffke, Suzanne. "Catherine of Siena." In Medieval Holy Women in the Christian Tradition c. 1100-c. 1500. Alastair J. Minnis and Rosalynn Voaden, eds. Turnhout: Brepols, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; She viewed Christ as a "bridge" between the soul and God and transmitted that idea, along with her other teachings, in her book The Dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine of Siena. The Dialogue. Translated by Suzanne Noffke. The Classics of Western Spirituality. Paulist Press, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dialogue is highly systematic and explanatory in its presentation of her mystical ideas; however, these ideas themselves are not so much based in reason or logic as they are based in her ecstatic mystical experience.&lt;ref&gt;Noffke, Suzanne. "Catherine of Siena." In Medieval Holy Women in the Christian Tradition c. 1100-c. 1500. Alastair J. Minnis and Rosalynn Voaden, eds. Turnhout: Brepols, 2010. 601–615.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Veneration==

She was buried in the (Roman) cemetery of [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]] which lies near the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]]. After miracles were reported to take place at her grave, Raymond moved her inside the [[Basilica]] of Santa Maria sopra Minerva,&lt;ref name=grave&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=Catherine+of+Siena&amp;GSbyrel=in&amp;GSdyrel=in&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=19919&amp; |title=Catherine of Siena |publisher=findagrave.com |accessdate=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she lies to this day.

Her head however, was parted from her body and inserted in a gilt bust of [[bronze]]. This bust was later taken to Siena, and carried through that city in a procession to the Dominican church. Behind the bust walked Lapa, Catherine's mother, who lived until she was 89 years old. By then she had seen the end of the wealth and the happiness of her family, and followed most of her children and several of her grandchildren to the grave. She helped Raymond of Capua write his biography of her daughter, and said, "I think God has laid my soul athwart in my body, so that it can't get out."{{sfn|Skårderud|2008|loc="Jeg tror at Gud har gjort det slik at sjelen ligger på tvers i kroppen min og ikke kan komme ut."}} The incorrupt head and thumb were entombed in the [[Basilica of San Domenico (Siena)|Basilica of San Domenico]] at Siena, where they remain.&lt;ref name=grave/&gt;

[[Pope Pius II]], himself from Siena, [[canonized]] Catherine on 29 June 1461.&lt;ref name=beckwith&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060422131354/http://www.americancatholic.org/Messenger/Apr2006/Feature1.asp Beckwith, Barbara. "St. Catherine of Siena: A Feisty Role for Sister Nancy Murray", ''St. Anthony Messenger'']&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 October 1970, [[Pope Paul VI]] named Catherine a [[Doctor of the Church]];&lt;ref name=Vatican1/&gt; this title was almost simultaneously given to [[Teresa of Ávila|Saint Teresa of Ávila]] (27 September 1970),&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/homilies/1970/documents/hf_p-vi_hom_19700927_it.html ''Proclamation of Saint Teresa of Ávila to Doctor of the Church'', Homily, 27 September 1970].&lt;/ref&gt; making them the first women to receive this honour.&lt;ref name=beckwith/&gt;

Initially however, her [[feast day]] was not included in the [[General Roman Calendar]]. When it was added in 1597, it was put on the day of her death, April 29; however, because this conflicted with the feast of Saint [[Peter of Verona]] which also fell on the 29th of April, Catherine's feast day was moved in 1628 to the new date of April 30.&lt;ref&gt;''"Calendarium Romanum"'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Mysterii Paschalis|1969 revision]] of the calendar, it was decided to leave the celebration of the feast of St Peter of Verona to local calendars, because he was not as well known worldwide, and Catherine's feast was restored to April 29.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Calendarium Romanum |publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana |year=1969 |page= 121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patronage===
In his decree of 13 April 1866, [[Pope Pius IX]] declared Catherine of Siena to be a co-patroness of Rome. On 18 June 1939 [[Pope Pius XII]] named her a joint [[patron saint]] of [[Italy]] along with [[Saint Francis of Assisi]].&lt;ref name=Vatican/&gt;

On 1 October 1999, [[Pope John Paul II]] made her one of Europe's [[patron saint]]s, along with [[Edith Stein|Saint Teresa Benedicta of the Cross]] and [[Bridget of Sweden|Saint Bridget of Sweden]].&lt;ref name=Vatican2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vatican3/&gt; She is also the patroness of the historically Catholic American woman's fraternity, [[Theta Phi Alpha]].

===Attribute===
The people of Siena wished to have Catherine's body. A story is told of a miracle whereby they were partially successful: knowing that they could not smuggle her whole body out of Rome, they decided to take only her head which they placed in a bag. When stopped by the Roman guards, they prayed to Catherine to help them, confident that she would rather have her body (or at least part thereof) in Siena. When they opened the bag to show the guards, it appeared no longer to hold her head but to be full of rose petals. Once back at Siena, as they reopened the bag her head was visible once more. Due to this story, Catherine is often seen holding a [[lily]].

==Legacy==
Catherine ranks high among the mystics and spiritual writers of the Church.&lt;ref name=foley/&gt; She remains a greatly respected figure for her spiritual writings, and political boldness to "speak truth to power"—it being exceptional for a woman, in her time period, to have had such influence in politics and on world history.

==Main sanctuaries==
The main churches in honor of Catherine of Siena are:

* [[Basilica of Santa Maria sopra Minerva]] in Rome: place where her body is preserved.
* [[Basilica of San Domenico, Siena|Basilica of San Domenico]] in Siena: in this church the incorrupt head of Catherine of Siena is preserved.

Giuliana Cavallini (Siena: Cantagalli, 1995). [1st edn, 1968] [Cavallini demonstrated that the standard division of the ''Dialogue'' in into four treatises entitled the 'Treatise on Discretion', 'On Prayer', 'On Providence', and 'On Obedience', was in fact a result of a misreading of the text in the 1579 edition of the ''Dialogue''. Modern editors and translators, including Noffke (1980), have followed Cavallini in rejecting this fourfold division.]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2736">The '''Central Spiritual Board of Buddhists of the USSR''' ('''TsDUB''') was the authorized organization for Buddhists in the Soviet Union.

The organization was founded at a congress of Buddhist believers on May 21–23, 1946 in [[Ulan-Ude, Russia|Ulan-Ude]], [[Buryat-Mongol ASSR]]. There "Law of Spiritual Administration of Buddhists and a Regulation for Buddhist Clergy of the USSR", making it imperative for Buddhists to honor the workers fatherland and put its interests on par with their faith.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.buddhistdoor.net/features/a-history-of-buddhism-in-russia-the-sangha-and-the-soviets A History of Buddhism in Russia: The Sangha and the Soviets]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chairman of the new organization was given the title [[Bandido Khambo Lama]], and the headquarters was at a new temple located near Ulan-Ude, Khambin sume, now known as [[Ivolginsky datsan]]. Soon a second temple was built, the [[Agin datsan]] in [[Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai|Chita]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.buddhistdoor.net/features/a-history-of-buddhism-in-russia-the-sangha-and-the-soviets A History of Buddhism in Russia: The Sangha and the Soviets]&lt;/ref&gt; A permanent office was established in [[Moscow]], which mainly dealt with external relations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhismtoday.com/english/world/country/028-russia.htm Buddhism in Russia]&lt;/ref&gt;

A congress of clergy and laity met quadrennially to elect members of the Board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhismtoday.com/english/world/country/028-russia.htm Buddhism in Russia]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chinese Manichaeism''' is the form of [[Manichaeism]] (摩尼教 ''Móníjiào'' or 明教 ''Míngjiào'', "bright religion") transmitted and practiced in [[China]]. 

Chinese Manichaeism identifies as a teaching with the purpose of awakening (佛 ''fú''), and it is a [[monotheism]] worshipping the universal [[God]] (''[[Shangdi]]'', ''Míngzūn'' 明尊 "Radiant Lord" or ''Zhēnshén'' 真神 "True God"). Creation is the Living Spirit (淨活風 ''Jìnghuófēng'') of God, of whom there have been many manifestations in human form, including [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] (摩尼 ''Móní'').&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Char Yar. "[https://www.academia.edu/1963810/Monijiao_Manichaeism_in_China Monijiao (Manichaeism) in China]". academia.edu. Lecture presented at the ''Worldwide Conference for Historical Research'', 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Jinjiang Cao'an 20120229-11.jpg|thumb|right|262px|[[Cao'an]] ("Thatched Hut") in [[Jinjiang, Fujian|Jinjiang]], [[Quanzhou]], [[Fujian]].]]
Manichaeism was introduced into China in the [[Tang dynasty]],{{sfnb|Ma|2011|p=55-56}} through [[Central Asia]]n communities.{{sfnb|Ma|2011|p=55-56}} It never rose to prominence, and was officially banned and persecuted through the [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution|suppression of non-Chinese religions]] started by the [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang]].

Since its introduction, Manichaeism was deeply [[sinicised]] in its style, adapting to the Chinese cultural context.{{sfnb|Ma|2011|p=56}} After the Tang, Manichaeism survived among the population and had a profound influence on the tradition of the [[Chinese folk religious sects]] integrating with the [[Maitreya teachings|Maitreyan beliefs]] such as the [[White Lotus Sect]].{{sfnb|Ma|2011|p=19-56}}

==Present-day Manichaeism==
In modern China, Manichaean groups are still active in southern provinces, especially in [[Quanzhou]]&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Marie Dan. ''[http://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1529&amp;context=utk_chanhonoproj Manichaeism and its Spread into China]''. University of Tennessee, 2002. pp. 17-18&lt;/ref&gt; and around the [[Cao'an]], the only Manichaean temple that has survived until today.{{sfnb|Wearring|2006|p=260}} There is a Chinese Manichaean Council with representatives in [[Tibet]] and [[Beijing]].

Today 84% of the population in '''[[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]''' practices [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox '''Christianity''']], primarily the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]]. Of these, around 2% follow the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], around 5.9% (almost all of whom are ethnic Armenians) follow the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] and 0.8% are  [[Catholics]] and are mainly found in the south of Georgia but with a small number in its capital, [[Tbilisi]].

A [[Pew Center]] study about [[ Religiosity and education|religion and education]] around the world in 2016, found that between the various [[World Christianity|Christian communities]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] ranks as the third highest nation in terms of [[Christians]] who obtain a [[university degree]] in institutions of [[higher education]] (57%).&lt;ref name="Pew2016"&gt;{{cite web |date=December 19, 2011 |title=Religion and Education Around the World |url=http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/12/21094148/Religion-Education-ONLINE-FINAL.pdf |publisher=Pew Research Center |accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Raising of Lazarus.jpg|150px|thumb|A page from a rare Georgian [[bible]], dating from AD 1030, depicting the Raising of Lazarus]]
According to Orthodox tradition, Christianity was first preached in Georgia by the [[Apostles]] Simon and Andrew in the 1st century. It became the state religion of [[Caucasian Iberia|Kartli (Iberia)]] in 319.&lt;ref name="Toumanoff1963"&gt;[[Cyril Toumanoff|Toumanoff, Cyril]], "Iberia between Chosroid and Bagratid Rule", in ''Studies in Christian Caucasian History'', Georgetown, 1963, pp. 374-377. Accessible online at {{cite web|url=http://rbedrosian.com/Ref/Toumicb/toumicb.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208043427/http://rbedrosian.com/Ref/Toumicb/toumicb.html |archivedate=2012-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rapp2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rapp|first=Stephen H., Jr|title=The Blackwell Companion to Eastern Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fWp9JA3aBvcC&amp;pg=PA137|accessdate=11 May 2012|year=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-3361-9|page=138|chapter=7 - Georgian Christianity}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The conversion of Kartli to Christianity  is credited to a [[Greeks|Greek]] lady called [[St. Nino]] of [[Cappadocia]]. The [[Georgian Orthodox Church]], originally part of the [[Church of Antioch]], gained its [[autocephaly]] and developed its doctrinal specificity progressively between the 5th and 10th centuries. The [[Bible]] was also translated into Georgian in the 5th century, as the [[Georgian alphabet]] was developed for that purpose. As was true elsewhere, the Christian church in Georgia was crucial to the development of a written language, and most of the earliest written works were religious texts. The Georgians' new faith, which replaced [[paganism|pagan]] beliefs and [[Zoroastrianism]], was to place them permanently on the front line of conflict between the Islamic and Christian worlds. Georgians remained mostly Christian despite repeated invasions by Muslim powers, and long episodes of foreign domination. After Georgia was annexed by the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] took over the Georgian church in 1811.

The Georgian church regained its autocephaly only when Russian rule ended in 1917. The [[Soviet Union|Soviet regime]] that ruled Georgia from 1921 did not consider revitalization of the Georgian church an important goal, however. Soviet rule brought severe purges of the Georgian church hierarchy and frequent repression of Orthodox worship. As elsewhere in the Soviet Union, many churches were destroyed or converted into secular buildings. This history of repression encouraged the incorporation of religious identity into the strong nationalist movement and the quest of Georgians for religious expression outside the official, government-controlled church. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, opposition leaders, especially [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]], criticized corruption in the church hierarchy. After Ilia II became the patriarch (catholicos) of the Georgian Orthodox Church in the late 1970s, Georgian Orthodoxy experienced a revival. In 1988 Moscow permitted the patriarch to begin consecrating and reopening closed churches, and a large-scale restoration process began. The Georgian Orthodox Church has regained much power and full independence from the state since the restoration of Georgia's independence in 1991.

==Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church==
{{main|Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church}}
The '''Georgian Orthodox Church''' (full title '''Georgian Apostolic Autocephalous Orthodox Church''', or in the [[Georgian language]], საქართველოს სამოციქულო მართლმადიდებელი ავტოკეფალური ეკლესია ''Sakartvelos Samocikulo Martlmadidebeli Avt'ok'epaluri Ek'lesia'') is one of the world's most ancient Christian Churches, and tradition traces its origins to the mission of [[Twelve Apostles|Apostle]] [[Saint Andrew|Andrew]] in the 1st century. It is an [[autocephaly|autocephalous]] (self-headed) part of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].  Georgian Orthodoxy has been a [[state religion]] in parts of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] since the 4th century, and is the majority religion in that country.

The [[Constitution of Georgia (country)|Constitution of Georgia]] recognizes the special role of the Georgian Orthodox Church in the country's history but also stipulates the independence of the church from the state. The relations between the State and the Church are regulated by the [[Concordat of 2002|Constitutional Agreement]] of 2002.

==Oriental Orthodoxy==
{{main|Armenian Apostolic Church in Georgia (country)}}
Adherents of [[Oriental Orthodox Christianity]] in Georgia are mainly ethnic [[Armenians in Georgia|Armenians]]. Communities of [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] in Georgia are under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the [[Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin]], and its [[eparchy]] (diocese), centered in the [[Saint George's Church, Tbilisi]]. The head of the ''Armenian Apostolic Diocese'' in Georgia is bishop Vazgen Mirzakhanyan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://armenianchurch.ge/en/component/content/article/442-bishop-vazgen-mirzakhanyan The Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church in Georgia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Catholicism==
{{main|Georgian Catholic Church}}
The Georgian Catholic Church (or Catholic Church in Georgia) has always, since the [[East-West Schism]], been composed mainly of [[Latin Rite]] Catholics. Since the 18th century, there has also been a significant number of [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian Rite]] Catholics.  [[Georgian Byzantine-Rite Catholics]] have always been few, and do not constitute an autonomous ("sui iuris") [[particular Church|Church]], since [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/_PR.HTM canon 27] of the ''[[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]]'' defines these Churches as under a hierarchy of their own and recognized as autonomous by the supreme authority of the Church.

A small number, estimated at 500 worldwide,[https://web.archive.org/web/20060713000246/http://www.damian-hungs.de/Unierte%20Ostkirchen%20I..html#Georgisch-Katholische_Kirche] of Byzantine or "Greek" Rite Georgian Catholics do exist. However, "no organized Georgian Greek Catholic Church ever existed", though, outside of Georgia, "a small Georgian Byzantine Catholic parish has long existed in Istanbul. Currently{{when|date=October 2013}} it is without a priest. Twin male and female religious orders 'of the Immaculate Conception' were founded there in 1861, but have since died out."[https://web.archive.org/web/20070302171843/http://www.cnewa.org/ecc-bodypg.aspx?eccpageID=77&amp;indexview=toc%3A] This was never established as a recognized [[particular Church]] of any level (exarchate, ordinariate etc.), within the communion of Catholic Churches, and accordingly has never appeared in the list of [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] published in the [[Annuario Pontificio]].

The '''Church of Wells''' (formerly the '''Church of Arlington''', or '''You Must Be Born Again (YMBBA) Ministries''') is an American religious group considered by some to be a cult&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; located in [[Wells, Texas|Wells]], [[Texas]] ([[United States]]). The group is led by Sean Morris, Jacob Gardner, and Ryan Ringnald, former [[Open-air preaching|street preachers]] who are all in their early thirties. It has approximately two hundred members, many being young adults and children.

==Beliefs==
According to their website, the Church of Wells promotes a [[Christian revival|revivalist]] approach to [[Christianity]]. They believe that most of Christian America is a "darkened generation" buried under a "mountain of apostasy". They place a high emphasis on [[the new birth]], denying many forms of entertainment and leisure in favor of prayer (with sessions often lasting several hours a day), fasting, and deep loathing for their own sin.  Only by demonstrating the correct "fruits" of salvation to the elders' approval can a Church of Wells member know that he has truly been saved.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thechurchofwells.com/ |title=Home |publisher=The Church of Wells |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They feature this verse prominently in their belief system: "If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciple]]" (Luke 14:26). The group uses this verse to justify its members cutting all ties with those outside the group, leaving their homes and families behind. Members express outright rejection of everybody outside the Church of Wells, including the media, all other pastors and spiritual leaders, and their own loved ones. [[Testimonies]] of members can be viewed on the church website.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3/&gt;

==Controversies==
In May 2012, a member's three-day-old infant died. Instead of seeking medical attention, the Elders carried the infant's body from house to house, praying for the baby to be resurrected for more than fifteen hours before calling 911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Austin |first=Anthony |url=http://www.cbs19.tv/story/18660945/ba |title=Baby's death bringing attention to religious group |publisher=Cbs19.tv |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Washington |first=Francesca |url=http://www.ktre.com/story/18659226/babys-death-draws-attention-to-wells-religious-group |title=Baby's death draws attention to Wells religious group |publisher=KTRE.com |date=2012-05-30 |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, Catherine Grove, 26, disappeared from her home in Arkansas without notice, abandoning her car and belongings, only to resurface weeks later under heavy guard at the Church of Wells. She said that she is not being held against her will, and was only "seeking the Lord",&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Sonia |url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/story/is-the-church-of-wells-a-cult |title=Sinners in the Hands |publisher=Texas Monthly |date=2014-01-22 |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hughes |first=Leigha |url=http://www.kltv.com/story/24429745/nacogdoches-authorities-respond-to-911-call-at-church-of-wells-elders-wedding |title=Catherine Grove spotted in public after police respond to 'Churc - KLTV.com-Tyler, Longview, Jacksonville, Texas &amp;#124; ETX News |publisher=Kltv.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the accounts of several other members who have cut off nearly all contact with their friends and family.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Based on these incidents, the Church of Wells has often been called an emerging [[cult]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; On April 2, 2015 Grove left the church and returned to her family in Arkansas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Osiadacz |first=Alex |url=http://www.ktre.com/story/28713546/breaking-catherine-grove-escapes-church-of-wells |title=Catherine Grove leaves controversial Church of Wells - KTRE.com &amp;#124; Lufkin and Nacogdoches, Texas |publisher=KTRE.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she returned to the church only twelve days later (April 14, 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beames |first=Caleb |url=http://www.kltv.com/story/28813130/catherine-grove-returns-to-wells |title=Catherine Grove returns to Wells - KLTV.com-Tyler, Longview, Jacksonville, Texas &amp;#124; ETX News |publisher=Kltv.com |date=2015-04-03 |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, Sean Morris and member Taylor Clifton were injured following a physical altercation during the Wells community homecoming parade. Witnesses report the two men caused a disturbance by "preaching harshly and screaming 'You're going to hell' to children, parents and parade-goers."&lt;ref name=knbc-injured&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413131729/http://www.ketknbc.com/news/update-church-of-wells-members-injured-following-p |title=Home &amp;#124; East Texas – Tyler, Longview, Jacksonville &amp;#124; MyEastTex &amp;#124; KETK and Fox51 |publisher=Ketknbc.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the recorded video of the preaching of Taylor Clifton, he can be heard saying of God, "He loves you. He cares for you." The injured members did not fight back, nor did they press charges.&lt;ref name=knbc-injured/&gt;

Members of the Church of Wells contend that the information projected in the media is unsubstantiated, and rebuttals to all incidents can be viewed on the church website.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3/&gt;

On June 28, 2015, six members of the Church of Wells interrupted a service of [[Lakewood Church]] in Houston, heckling Pastor [[Joel Osteen]] and calling him a liar.&lt;ref name="Lakewood"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://abc13.com/religion/video-hecklers-escorted-out-of-joel-osteens-lakewood-church/812485/ | title=Hecklers escorted out of Joel Osteen's Lakewood Church in SW Houston | publisher=ABC Inc., KTRK-TV Houston | date=28 June 2015 | accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016 four of the members of the Church of Wells involved in the incident were tried and acquitted of disturbing a public meeting by a Texas jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Joel-Osteen-headed-to-court-8318493.php | title=Men cleared in heckling case at Joel Osteen's Lakewood Church | work=Chron.com (Houston Cronicle) | date=23 June 2016 | accessdate=23 June 2016 | author=Rogers, Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March, 2016 members of the church disrupted a [[Baptist]] church service in Saranac Lake, NY.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.click2houston.com/news/investigates/arrests-mount-for-members-of-controversial-church&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Damjing''' ([[Korean language|in modern Korean]]) or '''Donchō''' (in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]) was a Buddhist priest who was sent to ancient Japan from [[Goguryeo]] around 610. How his name was pronounced in the [[Goguryeo language]] is unknown.

Almost nothing has come down about him besides a few lines in the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' (720 A.D.), which is almost the only reliable source.

{{quotation|In the Spring, March, the 19th year [of [[Empress Suiko]]],&lt;ref&gt;610 A.D.&lt;/ref&gt; the king of Koma&lt;ref&gt;Koma（高麗） is Goguryeo in this context. The king was [[Yeong-yang of Goguryeo|Yeong-yang]].&lt;/ref&gt; offered up [the] priest[s] Donchō and Hōjō&lt;ref&gt;法定. Beopjeong in modern Korean.&lt;/ref&gt; as tribute [to Japan]. Donchō was familiar with [[Four_Books_and_Five_Classics#Five_Classics|the Five Classics]]. He produced colors, paper and ink well, moreover made watermill.&lt;ref&gt;To be exact, 碾磑 is a mortar to grind grain by water power.&lt;/ref&gt; Has making watermill presumably started ever since?"|''Nihon Shoki'', Vol. 22　&lt;ref&gt;Original text : 十八年春三月 高麗王貢上 僧曇徵・法定 曇徵知五經 且能作彩色及紙墨 并造碾磑 蓋造碾磑始于是時歟.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the grounds that this is the first appearance about the manufacture of paper, it has been said, all in all, from the [[Edo period]], that he brought papermaking skills to Japan first.  However, there is no sufficient grounds to say so from the text; as to the watermill, it is mentioned that he probably introduced it first, while papermaking is not mentioned. If he had done so, it should have been mentioned along with the mention of the watermill. B. Jugaku, in his study ''The Japanese Paper'', making a comparative review of surviving ancient documents, concludes the text is a compliment for the Buddhist priest who was also familiar with [[Confucianism]], what is more, never ignorant of crafts; and if properly read, it does not state that he was the first person to bring the methods for color, ink and papermaking, rather that he was quite a craftsman for producing them.&lt;ref&gt;寿岳文章(JUGAKU, Bunshō), ''日本の紙 (The Japanese Paper)'', 日本歴史叢書 新装版, 吉川弘文館, (1967, 1996), pp. 1-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, at that time, maintenance of the state apparatus, which required enormous amounts of paper such as for family registers, had been started.&lt;ref&gt;柳橋真(YANAGIBASHI Shin), "''和紙 (Washi)''" in [[Heibonsha World Encyclopedia]], Kato Shuichi(ed.), Tokyo: Heibonsha, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The facts of the time support such a reading.

''Biography of Prince Shōtoku''(written in 917 or maybe 992) tells that [[Prince Shōtoku]] invited him to Ikaruga-no-miya Palace, and afterward kept him at [[Hōryū-ji]].&lt;ref&gt;From 聖徳太子伝暦, "十八年春三月 高麗僧曇徴・法定二口來 太子引入斑鳩宮 問之以昔身微言 二僧百拜 啓太子曰 我等學道年久 未知天眼 今遙想昔 殿下弟子而遊衡山者也 太子命曰 師等遲來 宜住吾寺 即置法隆寺."&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is not regarded as an historical fact since the book is a grand sum of mythical biographies about him.&lt;ref&gt;坂本太郎 (SAKAMOTO Tarō), the article on ''Prince Shōtoku'', in 国史大辞典 (The Grand Dictionary of Japanese History), 吉川弘文館, (1979-1997).　Additionally, any precedent biographies never tell the episode.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Korea, in recent years, some people have claimed that the wall painting in the Kondō of Hōryū-ji was made by Damjing,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. articles on Damjing at [http://ko.wikisource.org/wiki/%EA%B8%80%EB%A1%9C%EB%B2%8C_%EC%84%B8%EA%B3%84_%EB%8C%80%EB%B0%B1%EA%B3%BC%EC%82%AC%EC%A0%84/%ED%95%9C%EA%B5%AD%EC%82%AC/%EA%B3%A0%EB%8C%80%EC%82%AC%ED%9A%8C%EC%9D%98_%EB%B0%9C%EC%A0%84/%EC%82%BC%EA%B5%AD%EC%9D%98_%EC%84%B1%EB%A6%BD%EA%B3%BC_%EB%B0%9C%EC%A0%84/%EA%B3%A0%EB%8C%80%EB%AC%B8%ED%99%94%EC%9D%98_%EB%B0%9C%EC%A0%84#.EB.8B.B4.EC.A7.95 글로벌 세계 대백과사전] {{ko}} and [http://100.empas.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=289933&amp;v=43 EncyKorea]{{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is not based on any surviving documents. Furthermore, the original temple was burned around 670 and the current one is a reconstruction from the late 7th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1240">In [[Aboriginal mythology]], '''Erathipa''' is a boulder that has the shape of a [[Pregnancy|pregnant woman]]; contained within Erathipa are the souls of dead children which can inhabit the bodies of fertile young women. This was known only by the supreme ones of the ancient aborigines, also known as the Chockolia. The fertility stone has an opening on one side.  

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The tribes of [[central Australia]] have... a huge rock known as Erathipa, which has an opening in one side from which the souls of the children imprisoned in it watch for a woman to pass by so that they may be reborn in her.  When women who do not want children go near the rock, they pretend to be old, and walk as if leaning on a stick, crying; "Don't come to me, I am an old woman!"
The idea implicit in all these rites, is that certain stones have the power to make sterile women fruitful, either because of the spirits of the ancestors that dwell in them, or because of their shape (the pregnant woman, "woman stone"), or because of their origin ("autogenesis").&lt;ref&gt;Excerpt from the World of Myth: An Anthology By David Adams Leeming,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''First Church of Cannabis''' is a [[cannabis]]-based registered church in the U.S. state of [[Indiana]] founded in March 2015 by Bill Levin.

==History==
The First Church of Cannabis was founded in March 2015 by Bill Levin, who attended [[Indianapolis Hebrew Congregation]], a Reform Judaism synagogue, as a child, and titles himself Grand Poobah of the church.&lt;ref name=TimesOfIsrael2015/&gt; He said it was a direct response to the state's [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act (Indiana)|Religious Freedom Restoration Act]] (RFRA).&lt;ref name=WP2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=HuffPo2015/&gt; Monthly dues are $[[420 (cannabis culture)|4.20]].&lt;ref name=ABC2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyMail2015/&gt; Levin said that the church was granted [[IRS]] tax-exempt status less than 30 days after he applied.&lt;ref name=TimesOfIsrael2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC2015/&gt;

Bill Levin - the self-appointed "Grand Poobah" or highest holy official of the church, claimed that he had the idea to found the church while watching the popular television series: ''[[The Flintstones]]''. Grand Poobah is a term derived from the name of the haughty character Pooh-Bah in ''[[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'''s ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1885), and used recurringly in 
''The Flintstones'' as the name of a high-ranking elected position in a secret society, the Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes.

Media interest in the church is high, with thousands of reported print articles and features on [[CNN]] and [[Fox News]].&lt;ref name=TimesOfIsrael2015/&gt; The group planned to test RFRA on July 1, 2015, with a service in Indiana including the [[Entheogenic use of cannabis|use of cannabis]].&lt;ref name=CP2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=MirrorUK/&gt; However, legal threats from the city forced the first service to not use marijuana at all.  The service went without any arrests, even with a heavy police presence, although there were protesters from a nearby Christian church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/news/2015/06/26/officials-hold-church-cannabis-press-conference/29327331/|title=Cops warn of arrests at Church of Cannabis|date=June 26, 2015|work=Indianapolis Star|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Parking was restricted, as the police argued that they were enforcing a city law on parking on a street less than 24 feet wide.  Nearby residents also restricted parking on their property, although at least one person allowed parking for a small fee.  The service featured a comedian, live music, and dancing.  [[Food truck]]s were outside along with a merchandise table selling [[t-shirt]]s and [[sticker]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/news/2015/07/01/humor-police-presence-mixed-cannabis-church-site/29561919/|title=Humor, love, police a strange mix at Cannabis Church|author=Mark Alesia and GabFerreira|date=July 1, 2015|work=Indianapolis Star|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[security camera]] was installed outside of the church on the first day of service.  City officials argued that the camera was installed to ensure public safety. Levin retorted by saying "I find it flattering. If you think we are important enough to install a camera so you can have a guy watch us 24 hours a day, good! Good! You're spending our [[Hoosier]] tax money proper."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wishtv.com/2015/07/01/security-cameras-go-up-at-first-church-of-cannabis/|title=Security camera goes up outside First Church of Cannabis|work=WISH-TV|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church has a list of twelve [[Ten Commandments|commandments]] called the "Deity Dozen", which includes abstention from [[Internet troll]]ing.&lt;ref name=TimesOfIsrael2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyMail2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=CP2015/&gt;

The group's meetinghouse is located at a former Christian church building on South Rural Street in Indianapolis.&lt;ref name=IndyStar2015/&gt; Services are held every Wednesday at 7.

The legal status of the Church of Cannabis' use of marijuana in a jurisdiction where it is illegal, but the Religious Freedom Restoration Act holds, has been debated by legal experts. The Supreme Court case set forth certain criteria in ''U.S. v. Meyers'' that may or may not match fourteen criteria listed by the Internal Revenue Service in granting tax-exempt status.&lt;ref name=Wood2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Michaelson2015/&gt;  Several days after its first service, the Church sued both the state of Indiana and the city of Indianapolis, claiming that the present marijuana laws infringed on their religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fox59.com/2015/07/08/first-church-of-cannabis-founder-sues-indiana-and-marion-county-over-marijuana-laws/|title=First Church of Cannabis founder sues Indiana and Marion County over marijuana laws|work=Fox 59|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deity Dozen==
The Deity Dozen are a set of guidelines put forth by the Church.

#Don't be an asshole. Treat everyone with Love as an equal.
#The day starts with your smile every morning. When you get up, wear it first.
#Help others when you can. Not for money, but because it's needed.
#Treat your body as a temple. Do not poison it with poor quality foods and sodas.
#Do not take advantage of people. Do not intentionally hurt anything.
#Never start a fight…only finish them.
#Grow food, raise animals, get nature into your daily routine.
#Do not be a "troll" on the internet, respect others without name calling and being vulgarly aggressive.
#Spend at least 10 mins a day just contemplating life in a quiet space.
#Protect those who can not protect themselves.
#Laugh often, share humor. Have fun in life, be positive.
#Cannabis, "the Healing Plant" is our sacrament. It brings us closer to ourselves and others. It is our fountain of health, our love, curing us from illness and depression. We embrace it with our whole heart and spirit, individually and as a group.

'''Franz Schmidberger''' (born 19 October 1946 in [[Riedlingen]], [[Württemberg-Hohenzollern]], [[Allied-occupied Germany|Germany]]) is a priest of the [[Society of St. Pius X]], founded by Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]].

==Biography==
Graduated in 1972 in the University of [[Munich]], in the same year he entered the seminary of [[Écône]] where he was ordained priest on 8 December 1975. Later he taught in the seminary of [[Weissbad]], the first German speaking seminary of the Society.

In 1978 he founded the seminary of [[Zaitzkofen]] in [[Germany]], where he was appointed district superior from 1979.

In 1982 Schmidberger was appointed superior general of the society of St Pius X (quitting the post of district superior). In 1994, he was succeeded by Bishop [[Bernard Fellay]]. He subsequently served as 1st General Assistant (1994-2006), Austrian (1996-2000) and again German (2006-2013) district superior as well as regent of the Zaitzkofen seminary (2003-2005 and since 2013).

With Fellay, he is alleged to be part of a faction that favours reconciliation with Rome on the basis of the [[Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney|Campos precedent]], a program which is reportedly opposed by the other bishops of the SSPX.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/word/word090205.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter that he addressed to the Catholic bishops of Germany in October 2008, Schmidberger rejected the description that [[Pope John Paul II]] had applied to the Jews: "our older brothers in the faith", and declared that "for as long as they do not distance themselves from their forefathers' guilt through the avowal of Christ's divinity and baptism, they are complicit in the deicide".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/28/world/europe/28vatican.html New York Times: Group Says It Doesn’t Share Views of Holocaust Denier]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,603770,00.html Der Spiegel: German Far-Right Hails Holocaust Denier Williamson]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Chinese|t=黃飛虎|s=黄飞虎|p=Huáng Fēihǔ|w=Huang Fei-hu}}

'''Huang Feihu''' is a fictional character in the Chinese epic fantasy novel ''[[Fengshen Bang]]''. Originally known as '''Prince Wucheng''' ({{zh|c=武成王|p=Wǔchéng Wáng}}) of the [[Shang Dynasty]], he defects to Xiqi (西岐; the precursor to the [[Zhou Dynasty]]), a vassal state under Shang, after the tyrannical [[King Zhou of Shang]] caused the death of his wife. He brings along his two younger brothers, three sons, four close friends, and hundreds of followers loyal to him. Huang Feihu later participates in the campaign led by [[King Wu of Zhou|King Wu]] of the Zhou Dynasty to overthrow King Zhou of Shang. He is killed in action during a battle against the Shang general [[Zhang Kui]] (張奎).

== Biography ==
Huang Feihu is born in a family of officials who have served the [[Shang Dynasty]] for seven generations. Huang Feihu's father [[Huang Gun]] is a Shang general tasked with defending the border. Huang Feihu himself is granted the title of "Prince Wucheng Who Guards the Kingdom" (鎮國武成王; usually shortened to "Prince Wucheng"). Huang Feihu's younger sister, Consort Huang, is also a concubine of [[King Zhou of Shang|King Zhou]], the last ruler of the Shang Dynasty.

Near the end of the Shang Dynasty, King Zhou becomes obsessed with his concubine [[Daji]], who is actually a [[Huli Jing|vixen spirit]] in disguise as a woman. King Zhou is a ruthless and bloodthirsty tyrant who uses cruel means to torture and kill those who oppose him, including his own ministers who dared to speak up to him. At one point, King Zhou lusts for Huang Feihu's wife, Lady Jia, and attempts to seize her for himself. Lady Jia commits suicide to preserve her dignity. Consort Huang scolds King Zhou for his wicked ways and the king kills her by throwing her off Zhaixing Tower in anger.

Huang Feihu is furious when he learns the truth and he defects to Xiqi (西岐; the precursor to the [[Zhou Dynasty]]), a vassal state under Shang, bringing along his family and loyal followers. Huang Feihu receives a warm welcome in Xiqi and is treated with respect. His title is changed to "Prince Wucheng Who Founds the Kingdom" (開國武成王).

After the death of [[King Wen of Zhou|Ji Chang]] (Western Duke and lord of Xiqi), his son Ji Fa (later [[King Wu of Zhou]]) leads a campaign to overthrow King Zhou of Shang. Huang Feihu dedicates the rest of his life to assisting Ji Fa in toppling the Shang Dynasty, participating in various battles against Shang. He is eventually killed in a battle at Mianchi (澠池; present-day [[Mianchi County]], [[Henan]]) against the Shang general Zhang Kui (張奎).

During the investiture of the gods of Heaven at the end of the novel, [[Jiang Ziya]] grants Huang Feihu the post of "Dongyue Taishan Tianqi Rensheng Dadi" (東嶽泰山天齊仁聖大帝), the leader of the rulers of the [[Five Sacred Mountains]]. Huang Feihu oversees the fortunes and fates of mortals, and the [[Diyu|Eighteen Levels of Hell]].&lt;ref&gt;Xu Zhonglin. ''Fengshen Bang'', Chapter 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the beginning of the internet, many ministries began posting informational and sermon-like messages to visitors. Through the years this method of teaching has evolved in the form of video, audio podcasts and blogs.

Many of today's internet churches are descendants of brick-and-mortar churches, offering members an alternative to the traditional physical meetings within a church building.&lt;ref&gt;Nils Smith, "[http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/religion/Faith_groups_should_embrace__not_fear__social_media_99158984.html Faith groups should embrace — not fear — social media]" ''San Antonio Express'' (Accessed August 16, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="3_News_169062"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/OMGod-The-Worlds-first-online-church/tabid/423/articleID/169062/Default.aspx |title=OMGod: The World's first online church |date=August 5, 2010 |work=[[3 News]] |accessdate=October 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some, such as the Church of Fools, offer church experiences through entirely 3D virtual reality environments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Recent statistics have shown an increasing exodus of young people from churches, especially after they leave home and live on their own. In a 2007 study, Lifeway Research determined that 70% of young Protestant adults between 18–22 stop attending church regularly.&lt;ref&gt;BRETT MCCRACKEN, "[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704111704575355311122648100 The Perils of 'Wannabe Cool' Christianity]" ''Wall Street Journal'' (Accessed August 13, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet churches now exist all around the world; however, they are still criticized for their lack on “human connection”.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon MacDonald "Who Stole My Church?: What to Do When the Church You Love Tries to Enter the 21st Century" (Thomas Nelson Inc, 2008, {{ISBN|0-7852-2601-X}}, 9780785226017)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

Internet church is a gathering of religious believers facilitated through the use of online video stream, audio stream and/or written messages whose primary purpose is to allow the meeting of a church body of parishioners using the internet.

It includes different aspects of Christian community online, especially by those who view this phenomenon as a subset of [[emerging church]], the developing expressions of the faith in relation to culture change. A cyberchurch is a ministry that exists primarily as a private website, an interactive space on a public website or social networking site.

An internet church describes an institution that teaches and practices its religious beliefs entirely or primarily through online methods. Though there are hundreds of internet churches available online, the term "internet church" is generally reserved for churches that have a majority of its members meet, connect or congregate by way or use of the internet; where religious services are conducted through Internet technology. The internet churches differ/contrasts from the traditional church through the physical media that links pastors, teachers and believers. Many churches in the United States have their own internet church campus, and many of them have members numbering in the hundreds.

Members keep in contact with pastors and ministers and collaborate with other believers through web communication tools provided. In some cases members communicate by phone with ministers.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Wynne-Jones, "[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/7908263/Church-minister-to-tweet-Holy-Communion-to-the-faithful.html Church minister to tweet Holy Communion to the faithful]" ''Telegraph'' (Accessed August 16, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

As Internet usage continues to thrive, Christians are using [[websites]], [[blogs]], [[social network]]ing sites, media services, [[chatrooms]], [[discussion boards]], and other electronic means to provide social connection, education, and enrichment of their faith.

===Online churches===
The word ''cyberchurch'' was used by web-developer Tim Bednar's paper "We Know More Than Our Pastors" which detailed the blogging movement's influence on the experience of faith.&lt;ref name="bednar-paper"&gt;Tim Bednar, "[https://www.scribd.com/doc/47331/We-Know-More-Than-Our-Pastors We Know More Than Our Pastors: Why Bloggers Are the Vanguard of the Participatory Church]" PDF (Accessed September 5, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Religious pollster and author George Barna used the term in his book Revolution to describe "the range of spiritual experiences delivered through the Internet".&lt;ref name='barna'&gt;George Barna, "Revolution" (Tyndale House, 2005, {{ISBN|1-4143-1016-1}} )&lt;/ref&gt; Barna sees Cyberchurch as one of the future  "macro-expressions" (large scale forms) of church in the future; one that will soon account for one-third of American spirituality, together with other "revolutionary" forms of church.&lt;ref name='barna'/&gt;

===Social networking sites===
Christians, like many Internet users, are increasingly using social networking sites like [[Facebook]].  These sites incorporate much of the technology of blogging but forge more concrete connections between users, allowing them to "message" each other within the system, connect officially as "friends", rate and rank each other, etc.  These connections may or may not materialize in the real world, but many people now consider on-line relationships a significant part of their lives, increasing the potential influence of a Christian presence in these environments.  Criticism of Christian use of these sites has grown, however, due to prevalence of questionable content and issues of safety.&lt;ref&gt;John Kuhn, "[http://www.breakawaymag.com/AllTheRest/A000000536.cfm Should Myspace be Yourspace?]" ''Breakaway [http://www.breakawaymag.com http://www.breakawaymag.com]'' (Accessed September 5, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, several Christian alternatives for social networking have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.dittytalk.com Ditty Talk], [http://www.yourchristianspace.com Your Christian Space], [http://www.xianz.com Xianz], [http://www.mypraize.com MyPraize], [http://www.faithfreaks.com Faith Freaks], [http://www.christunion.com Christ Union]&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, some advocate a missional stance, using social networking sites and networking components of other Internet mediums like blogging, chat, and instant messaging to proselytize new converts and spread the Gospel.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Careaga, "[http://www.next-wave.org/dec99/embracing_the_cyberchurch.htm Embracing the cyberchurch]" ''Next-Wave [http://www.next-wave.org http://www.next-wave.org]'' (Accessed September 5, 2007);  Kevin D. Hendricks, "[http://www.churchmarketingsucks.com/archives/2006/04/how_your_church_1.html How Your Church Can Use MySpace]" ''Church Marketing Sucks [http://www.churchmarketingsucks.com http://www.churchmarketingsucks.com]'' (Accessed September 5, 2007); and Rev. Arne H. Fjeldstad, D. Min, "[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/1541/survey1.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+09:44:27 Communicating the Gospel on the Internet]" ''Communicating Christ 
on the Internet [https://web.archive.org/web/20091026213354/http://geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/1541/ http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/1541/]'' (Accessed September 5, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some speculation and experimentation with the idea of starting churches within such "virtual environments".  [[LifeChurch.tv]] is at the forefront of developing a platform to support the Online "Church Online" Campus offering their platform to other churches. For instance, a quick google search will reveal their platform is being utilized at [http://online.eastlakechurch.com East Lake Church] in Chula Vista, CA   [http://live.theridgecc.com The Ridge Community Church] in Milwaukee, WI and [http://live.seacoast.org Seacoast Church] in Charleston, South Carolina. True, LifeChurch does not limit themselves and has also used other platforms to plant a cyberchurch within the Facebook community using an "Internet Campus" technology.&lt;ref&gt;Bobby Gruenewald, "[http://swerve.lifechurch.tv/2007/08/02/facebook-church/ Facebook Church]" ''Swerve [http://swerve.lifechurch.tv http://swerve.lifechurch.tv]'' (Accessed September 5, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, churches are beginning to appear in the [[Second Life]] [[virtual world]] where people can attend as avatars and worship together.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Wright, "[http://www.dokimos.org/secondlife/ CyberChurch in Second Life]" ''Dokimos.org [http://www.dokimos.org http://www.dokimos.org]'' (Accessed September 5, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these churches retain elements that can be found in traditional churchgoing, such as sermons. However, they also attempt to adapt to the unique social norms of digital media; users attending these churches are often referred to by their online usernames and there are sometimes chat sessions before, after, and even during services.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Hutchings. (2011) "Contemporary Religious Community And The Online Church." ''Information, Communication &amp; Society.'' 1118-1135.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On-line multimedia ===
[[Podcasting]], streaming audio and video, media downloads, and self-broadcasting websites have made it possible to share the sights and sounds of belief.  While religious recordings of different types have certainly existed before, it is the Internet's ability to make these files public for millions of users that has led to the growth and influence of this component of cyberchurch.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Jones, "[http://www.relevantmagazine.com/god_article.php?id=7041 Linking to Cyberchurch]" ''[[Relevant Magazine]]'' (Accessed September 5, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Now there are millions of audio sermons, conference and seminar recordings, home videos, documentaries, faith-themed films and more accessible on the World Wide Web.

Tech-savvy bloggers can use multimedia to create audioblogs and videoblogs that present experiences, opinions, dialogs, stories, and teachings, creating a more live feel to the blogging experience.  Many prominent thinkers, authors, and leaders have blogs that present a podcast or streaming audio of speeches, lectures, or sermons.  Video sharing sites like [[YouTube]] and [[Google Video]] allow anyone with a web camera to post video alongside professional religious movie producers and make it available to millions of users.  This allows believers to share ideas about faith in new and creative ways. Most of these sites allow people to embed video hosted remotely onto their blog or website, powering video-based communication across the Internet.  Christian-specific sites have also recently sprung up to provide faith-based video sharing services.

{{nihongo|'''Koyasan Beikoku Betsuin'''|高野山米国別院|Kōyasan Beikoku Betsuin|"Koyasan United States Branch Temple"}}, also known as '''Koyasan Buddhist Temple''', is a Japanese Buddhist temple in the [[Little Tokyo, Los Angeles|Little Tokyo]] district of [[Downtown Los Angeles]], [[California]], United States. Founded in 1912, it is one of the oldest existing Buddhist temples in the North American mainland  region. The temple is a branch of [[Koyasan]] [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]] [[Buddhism]] and is the  North America regional headquarters for the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.littletokyohs.org/naming.html|title= Naming  |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |work=|publisher= Little Tokyo Historical Society|accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://koyasan.org/KoyasanNA/northamerica.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The temple was founded by the Reverend Shutai Aoyama, a native of [[Toyama Prefecture]], who was sent by the Koyasan headquarters to establish a global link in Shingon Buddhism in America. Initially facing personal hardship in establishing a temple in his inaugural  arrival, he founded the temple in 1912 with the assistance of [[Issei]] and [[Nisei]] temple members, and established its first location in a storefront in 1912 near [[Elysian Park]]. In 1920, the temple was moved to a larger building on [[Central Avenue (Los Angeles)|Central Avenue]]. A tree was planted in front of the new building by Koyasan Temple members to commemorate the move. The Aoyama Tree is a notable landmark in Little Tokyo was given historical status by the [[Los Angeles City Council]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preservela.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=281&amp;Itemid=37]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Japanese American National Museum]] stands at Koyasan's second location.

The third and current building located on East 1st Street was built in 1940. One year after its establishment, [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japan attacked Pearl Harbor]], sparking the United States' involvement in [[World War II]]. The new temple was closed while its members were [[Japanese-American internment|forcibly relocated]] in the various internment camps. During the time period of [[World War II]], the temple was mostly used for storage space for internees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/nikkeialbum/items/339/]&lt;/ref&gt; The temple was re-opened in 1946 and the temple had to rebuild its congregational base after families and residents of Little Tokyo were scattered outside Los Angeles.

Over the years, the temple began opening cultural and religious programs and classes for the local community. Prior to redevelopment in Little Tokyo, Koyasan served as the main hub of Japanese cultural events.  In 1987, the temple hosted the Kechien Kanjo ritual, a service rarely conducted outside Japan. Two years later the temple was designated the keeper of the Hiroshima Peace Flame, brought over from Japan by Los Angeles Mayor [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]]. Starting in 1999, the temple underwent a ten-year renovation of the old facilities to meet with the city building codes; the building was especially retrofitted to fit the needs for the monthly Goma fire ritual service. In November 2012, the temple celebrated its centennial anniversary, hosting a special goma fire ritual service presided over by Bishop [[Ekan Ikeguchi]] from Kagoshima.

==Bishops==
The temple has had eight head bishops since its inception in 1912. The fourth and fifth bishop, Reverends Seytsu Takahashi and Ryosho Sogabe, pioneered the founding the temple building as it stands today; Takahashi was later appointed the Ho-in (equivalent of  deputy abbot) of [[Kongobu-ji]] in [[Mount Koya]], serving until his death in 1984. Reverend Taido Kitagawa was a co-organizer of the temple's Boy Scout Troop 379, one of the oldest Boy Scout troops in the United States. Kitagawa's son is [[Johnny Kitagawa]],  founder of Japanese production agency [[Johnny &amp; Associates]]. Reverend Taisen Miyata, the seventh bishop and translator of Esoteric Buddhist texts, served from 1993 to 2007 and was acting bishop from 2011 to 2013.

==Boy Scout Troop 379==
[[File:Kobo Daishi Statue at Koyasan Buddhist Temple, Los Angeles.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Kōbō Daishi ([[Kūkai]])]]
The temple also hosts [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] Troop 379, formed in 1931, one of the oldest troops in existence in California. Future actor and gay rights activist [[George Takei]] was one of the troop's members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmnLYVNO5EE&amp;NR=1|title=George Takei - Boy Scouts of America Public Service Announcement|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://corpsreps.com/corpsreps.cfm?view=corpshist&amp;corps=534&amp;corpstype=Junior|title=History for Commodore Perry Scouts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other names for the troop include AL Post 525, Koyasan, and Green Giant. The Commodore Perry Scouts were a junior marching and maneuvering corps based in Los Angeles, California. They were sponsored by the Commodore Perry American Legion Post 525 and the Koyasan Buddhist Temple.
Associated with the Los Angeles Boy Scout Troop 379, the Scouts boasted 164 Eagle Scouts among their ranks in 1935. Among the corps' awards were the state American Legion Championships in 1955, 1956, 1962, and 1963. The corps' colors are green, black, and white.

The troop was also featured in the 1953 movie, ''[[Mister Scoutmaster]]'', with [[Clifton Webb]] and [[George Winslow|George "Foghorn" Winslow]]. In the film he mobilized the Troop, played by members of Koyasan Troop 379, to search for Foghorn as he was missing.  

Later in 1971, the Drum &amp; Bugle Corps, upon the request of the members, changed the name to Third Generation, as they were not nisei or issei generation Japanese Americans.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1908">The '''(Roman) Catholic Church in [[Montenegro]]''' only comprises two Latin [[diocese]]s, one of which is an exempt archdiocese, which has no [[ecclesiastical province]]. 

It has no national [[episcopal conference]], but its episcopate partakes in the ''Balkanic International Episcopal Conference of Saints Cyril and Methodius'', jointly with fellow former-[[Yugoslavia]]n [[Balkan]]ic countries [[Kosovo]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Serbia]] (not Croatia or Slovenia, which have a national conference each).

There is no [[Eastern Catholic]] or pre-diocesan jurisdiction.

There is also an [[Apostolic Nunciature]] to Montenegro as papal diplomatic representation (embassy level), which is however vested in the Apostolic Nunciature to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (in its capital [[Sarajevo]]).

== Current Latin dioceses ==
* [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bar]], now non-Metropolitan and Exempt, i.e. immediately subject to the [[Holy See]]
* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Kotor]], suffragan of the ([[Croatia]]n) Metropolitan [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Split–Makarska]]

== Titular sees ==
All six defunct dioceses in Montenegro have been nominally restored as Latin [[Titular see]]s :

; A Metropolitan [[Titular archbishopric]] 
* [[Archdiocese of Doclea|Doclea]]

; Five [[Titular bishopric]]s : 
* [[Diocese of Budua|Budua]]
* [[Diocese of Novi|(Herceg) Novi]]
* [[Diocese of Risinium|Risinium]] (Risinio)
* [[Diocese of Suacia|Suacia]] (Svač)
* [[Diocese of Ulcinj|Ulcinj]] (Dulcigno, Ulcinium).

In 2018 there were 31 '''states of the United States that had a significant [[Amish]] population'''. Following are populations by state per the results.

The data for 1992 are from "Amish Studies - The Young Center".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://groups.etown.edu/amishstudies/files/2015/08/Population_Change_1992-2013.pdf/ |title=Amish Population Change 1992-2013 (Alphabetical Order)

* The settlement in [[Pinecraft (Sarasota)]], Florida is very atypical and its population varies a lot according to the season.

According to Albrecht Powell, the Pennsylvania Amish are not the largest group of U.S. Amish as is commonly thought. The Amish have settled in as many as twenty-four states and [[Canada]], and [[Central America]], though about 65% are located in [[Pennsylvania]], [[Ohio]] and [[Indiana]]. The greatest concentration of Amish is in [[Holmes County, Ohio|Holmes]] and adjoining counties in northeast Ohio, about 78 miles south of Cleveland. Next in size is a group of Amish people in Elkhart and surrounding counties in northeastern Indiana. Then comes the Amish settlement in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The Amish population in the U.S. numbers more than 270,000 and is growing rapidly, due to large family size (seven children on average) and a church-member retention rate of approximately 80%."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Powell|first=Albrecht|title=Amish 101 - Amish Beliefs, Culture &amp; Lifestyle, History of the Amish in America,|url=http://pittsburgh.about.com/cs/pennsylvania/a/amish.htm|publisher=about.com|accessdate=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was an Amish settlement in [[Honduras]] from about 1968 to 1978 but the settlement failed.&lt;ref&gt;Cory Anderson and Jennifer Anderson. [http://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1811/78020/JAPAS_Anderson-Anderson_vol4-issue1_pp1-50.pdf "The Amish Settlement in Honduras, 1968-1978"] in ''Journal of Amish and Plain Anabaptist Studies'' 4,1, pages 1-50.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 new settlements of [[New Order Amish]] were founded in [[Argentina]] and [[Bolivia]]. In Canada new settlements were founded in [[New Brunswick]] in 2015 and on [[Prince Edward Island]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://amishamerica.com/2016-amish-population/ ''2016 Amish Population: Two New Settlements In South America''] at amishamerica.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of tallest Orthodox church buildings''' in the world, all those higher than 70 metres.

Traditionally, an [[Orthodox church (building)|Orthodox church building]] is crowned by one or several [[dome]]s with [[Orthodox cross]]es on the top of each. The overall height of the temple is measured by the highest point of the cross above the main temple.

The number of domes is symbolical. One dome is a symbol of [[Christ]] or God, three domes are symbolic of [[Trinity]], five domes symbolize Christ and [[Four Evangelists]], seven domes are often used because seven is a holy number, and thirteen domes correspond to Christ and his twelve [[Apostles]]. Other numbers are also encountered.

An Orthodox church building may also have a [[bell tower]] or [[zvonnitsa]], either a part of the main church building, or standalone structure. Typically, bell tower is higher than the main temple.

This list is divided into two sections, one listing the highest temples and the other listing the highest bell towers or [[zvonnitsa]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10154">[[File:Codex Borgia page 22.jpg|thumb|right|The Naguals, shapeshifting creatures.]]
In [[Mesoamerican folk religion]], a '''''nagual''''' or '''''nahual''''' (both pronounced [na'wal]) is a human being who has the power to transform either spiritually or physically into an animal form: most commonly [[jaguar]], [[Cougar|puma]] and [[wolf]], but also other animals such as [[donkey]]s, [[bird]]s, [[dog]]s or [[coyote]]s.{{sfn|Nutini|Roberts|1993|page=43}}

Such a nagual is believed to use their powers for good or evil according to their personality.{{sfn|Stratmeyer|Stratmeyer|1977}} Specific beliefs vary, but the general concept of nagualism is pan-Mesoamerican. Nagualism is linked with pre-Columbian shamanistic practices through Preclassic Olmec depictions which are interpreted as human beings transforming themselves into animals. The system is linked with the [[Mesoamerican calendars|Mesoamerican calendrical system]], used for divination rituals. The birth date often determines if a person will be a nagual. Mesoamerican belief in [[Tonal (mythology)|tonalism]], wherein every person has an animal counterpart to which his life force is linked, is also part of the definition of nagualism.{{sfn|Stratmeyer|Stratmeyer|1977}}{{sfn|Kaplan|1956}} In English the word is often translated as "transforming witch", but translations without the negative connotations of the word [[witch]] would be "transforming [[trickster]]" or "[[shape shifter]]".{{sfn|Nutini|Roberts|1993|page=43}}

== History ==
[[File:Jaguarnagual.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A pre-Columbian [[Chatino]] stela possibly depicting a nagual transforming into a jaguar. His name is inscribed in [[Mesoamerican writing systems#Zapotec writing|Zapotec glyphs]] on his abdomen and translates to "5 Alligator".]]

The word ''nagual'' derives from the [[Nahuatl]] word ''nahuālli'' {{IPA-nah|naˈwaːlːi|}}, an indigenous religious practitioner, identified by the Spanish as a 'magician'. The nagual is acquired along with the other characteristics of a person's birth day at birth. Each day is associated with an animal which has strong and weak aspects. A person born on "The Dog Day" would have both strong and weak 'Dog' aspects. In Nahuatl the word ''[[tonalli]]'' was used to refer both to a day and to the animal associated with that day. The nagual is different, where the ''tonal'' is the day spirit proper, the nagual is the spirit familiar of the day. It is probable that the tonal represents the daytime aspect and the nagual the nighttime aspect of the tonalli, 'the things of the day'. Because practitioners of powerful magic were normally born on certain days related to animals with a strong or harmful aspect they would often have specific tonals such as the jaguar or puma. In Aztec mythology the God [[Tezcatlipoca]] was the protector of nagualism, because his tonal was the jaguar and he governed the distribution of wealth.

In modern rural Mexico, ''nagual'' is sometimes synonymous with ''brujo'' ("wizard"): one who is able to shapeshift into an animal at night, (normally into a [[dog]], [[owl]], [[bat]], a big [[wolf]], or [[turkey (bird)|turkey]]) drink blood from human victims, steal property, cause disease, and the like.

In some indigenous communities the position of nagual is integrated into the religious hierarchy. The community knows who is a ''nagual'', tolerating, fearing and respecting them. ''nagualli'' are hired to remove curses cast by other ''nagualli''.

In other communities the accusation of nagualism may result in violent attacks by the community towards the accused.

The Western study of [[Nagualism]] was initiated by archaeologist, linguist and ethnologist [[Daniel Garrison Brinton]] who published ''Nagualism: A Study in Native-American Folklore and History'',{{sfn|Brinton|1894}} which chronicled historical interpretations of the word and those who practiced Nagualism in Mexico in 1894. He identified various beliefs associated with nagualism in some modern Mexican communities such as the [[Mixe]], the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]], the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]] and the [[Mixtec]].

Subsequently, many studies have described Nagualism in different Mesoamerican cultures such as the [[Zoque people|Zoques]] and the [[Jakaltek people|Jakaltek]], [[K'iche' people|K'iche']], [[Q'eqchi' people|Q'eqchi']], and [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltal Maya]]. Among the Jacaltec, naguals reinforce indigenism by punishing those who collaborate with non-indigenous 'ladinos''.{{sfn|Stratmeyer|Stratmeyer|1977}}

In 1955, Gustavo Correa, suggested Nagualism is not [[pre-Columbian]], arguing that it was wholly imported from Europe, where he compared it to the medieval belief in [[werewolves]].{{sfn|Correa|1955}} However, [[shapeshifting]] folklore is far from limited to Europe, nor is it limited to the Middle Ages; for example, some of earth's oldest literature, the [[Bronze Age]] Eastern Semitic [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], and East Asia's [[Huli Jing]] (origin of this folklore is of unknown date, but eighteenth century at the latest; see main article), contain shapeshifters.  The werewolf ([[lycanthropy]]) is also far from the only, or the earliest, form of folklorical [[therianthropy]] (shapeshifting from human to animal, or vice versa).{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

A solid consensus of authors and curators today interpret pre-Columbian art as expressing a belief in therianthropic shapeshifting, often citing hallucinogenic drugs as the root of the Mesoamerican and Desert Southwest shapeshifter folktales.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KnI6_IP06K4C&amp;pg=PA194&amp;lpg=PA194&amp;dq=zapotec+therianthropy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Nw0C0EDE-h&amp;sig=j9mYDE6EkNtTar5YyV8QYiCbbXk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-u72-25_JAhUIaT4KHc2xA6IQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=therianthropes&amp;f=false], [https://books.google.com/books?id=PCIIJ2e3IcsC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=zapotec+therianthropy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lFcjPEgZOd&amp;sig=NXm9omE3mPr6gm7eymMxmnRiwAQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-u72-25_JAhUIaT4KHc2xA6IQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=therianthropes&amp;f=false], [http://barakatgallery.com/store/index.cfm/FuseAction/ItemDetails/cmdNextItem/8489/ItemID/8489/SubCatID/418/userid/PBDxISz1XvnkaB9.htm], [https://books.google.com/books?id=eDk5AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT155&amp;lpg=PT155&amp;dq=olmec+therianthropy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Yvn4FSy3fG&amp;sig=qscTZQmRr3F_3-M8Q6n-T-Fhlkc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbipah15_JAhUCZD4KHRkxC9MQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=therianthropy&amp;f=false], [https://books.google.com/books?id=FpMhxNgf97YC&amp;pg=PT272&amp;lpg=PT272&amp;dq=olmec+therianthropy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wMOTocqVUi&amp;sig=kGTaBX1MFmd484DTCPJ9w2sZBCc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbipah15_JAhUCZD4KHRkxC9MQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=therianthropy&amp;f=false], [http://scholarlyrepository.miami.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1336&amp;context=oa_theses]&lt;/ref&gt;{{synthesis inline|date=March 2016}}

Kaplan concludes that, in Oaxaca, the belief in naguals as evil shape shifting witches is common in both indigenous and mestizo populations. According to Kaplan, the belief in animal spirit companions is exclusively indigenous. These is certain for some groups and communities, but for others, as the Mixes, Chinantecos, Triquis or Tacuates, those who can control their nahual or alterego are also protectors of the people and the natural resources and culture of the community, and highly revered but also feared.{{sfn|Kaplan|1956}}

in 1887, [[Sargeant Oscar Francisco Gimenez]]{{dead link|date=February 2018}} {{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}  Nava was found to be one of this witches, some villagers says they saw him transfrom into a [[wolf]] they chased after him but witness say he was way too fast to overrun him and he escaped.

The term ''nagual'' was popularized in books by author [[Carlos Castaneda]], although he had come up with a different meaning for the term, with very little relation to the [[Nahuatl]] definition.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The '''Oxford Movement''' was a movement of [[High Church]] members of the [[Church of England]] which eventually developed into [[Anglo-Catholicism]]. The movement, whose original devotees were mostly associated with the [[University of Oxford]], argued for the reinstatement of some older Christian traditions of faith and their inclusion into Anglican liturgy and theology. They thought of [[Anglicanism]] as one of [[Branch Theory|three branches]] of the [[Four Marks of the Church|One, Holy, catholic, and Apostolic Church]].

The movement's philosophy was known as '''Tractarianism''' after its series of publications, the ''[[Tracts for the Times]]'', published from 1833 to 1841. Tractarians were also disparagingly referred to as "Newmanites" (before 1845) and "Puseyites" (after 1845) after two prominent Tractarians, [[John Henry Newman]] and [[Edward Bouverie Pusey]]. Other well-known Tractarians included [[John Keble]], [[Charles Marriott (Tractarian)|Charles Marriott]], [[Richard Froude]], [[Robert Wilberforce]], [[Isaac Williams]] and [[William Palmer (theologian)|William Palmer]].

==Origins and early period==
In the early nineteenth century, different groups were present in the Church of England.  Many, particularly in high office, saw themselves as [[latitudinarian]] (liberal) in an attempt to broaden the Church's appeal.  Conversely, many clergy in the parishes were [[Evangelicals]], as a result of the revival led by [[John Wesley]] (who had, however, a highly sacrificial doctrine of the Holy Eucharist, which is reflected in his brother Charles' hymns, and unusual for an 18th century Anglican he took communion 90 times a year on average) and others.  Alongside this, the universities became the breeding ground for a movement to restore liturgical and devotional customs which [[syncretism|borrowed heavily]] from traditions before the [[English Reformation]] as well as contemporary Roman Catholic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Church of England (the Anglican Church)|url = http://victorianweb.org/religion/denom1.html|website = victorianweb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate impetus for the Tractarian movement was a perceived attack by the [[Reform Act 1832|reforming]] [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] administration on the structure and revenues of the [[Church of Ireland]] (the [[established church]] in Ireland), with the [[Church Temporalities (Ireland) Act 1833|Irish Church Temporalities Bill]] (1833). This bill not only legislated administrative changes of the hierarchy of the church (for example, with a reduction of bishoprics and archbishoprics) but also made changes to the leasing of church lands, which some (including a number of Whigs) feared would result in a secular appropriation of ecclesiastical property. John Keble criticised these proposals as "[[National Apostasy]]" in his Assize Sermon in Oxford in 1833. The Tractarians criticised theological [[Liberal Christianity|liberalism]]. Their interest in Christian origins caused some of them to reconsider the relationship of the Church of England with the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

The Tractarians postulated the [[Branch Theory]], which states that Anglicanism along with [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodoxy]] and Roman Catholicism form three "branches" of the historic Catholic Church. Tractarians argued for the inclusion of traditional aspects of liturgy from medieval religious practice, as they believed the church had become too "plain". In the final tract, "[[Tract 90]]", Newman argued that the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church, as defined by the [[Council of Trent]], were compatible with the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of the 16th-century Church of England. Newman's eventual reception into the Roman Catholic Church in 1845, followed by [[Henry Edward Manning]] in 1851, had a profound effect upon the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mocavo.com/A-Short-History-of-the-Oxford-Movement-2/104802/164|title=A Short History of the Oxford Movement|work=Mocavo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Apart from the ''Tracts for the Times'', the group began a collection of translations of the Church Fathers, which they termed the ''[[Library of the Fathers]]''. The collection eventually comprised 48 volumes, the last published three years after Pusey's death. They were issued through Rivington's company with the imprint of the Holyrood Press. The main editor for many of these was [[Charles Marriott (Tractarian)|Charles Marriott]]. A number of volumes of original Greek and Latin texts was also published. One of the main contributions that resulted from Tractarianism is the hymnbook entitled [[Hymns Ancient and Modern]] which was published in 1861.

==Influence and criticism==
[[File:Keble College, Oxford (472712547).jpg|thumb|[[Keble College, Oxford]], founded in 1870, was named after [[John Keble]], a Tractarian, by the influence of [[Edward Pusey]], another Tractarian]]
The Oxford Movement was criticised for being a mere "[[Anglican Papalism|Romanising]]" tendency, but it began to influence the theory and practice of Anglicanism more broadly. Paradoxically, the Oxford Movement was also criticised for being both secretive and collusive.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Walter [https://archive.org/stream/secrethistoryofo00walsuoft#page/n5/mode/2up ''The Secret History of the Oxford Movement, with a New Preface Containing a Reply to Critics''], London Church Association, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oxford Movement resulted in the establishment of [[Anglican religious orders]], both of men and of women. It incorporated ideas and practices related to the practice of [[liturgy]] and ceremony to incorporate more powerful emotional [[Christian symbolism|symbolism]] in the church. In particular it brought the insights of the [[Liturgical Movement]] into the life of the church. Its effects were so widespread that the [[Eucharist]] gradually became more central to [[worship]], [[vestments]] became common, and numerous Roman Catholic practices were re-introduced into worship. This led to controversies within churches that resulted in court cases, as in the [[ritualism in the Church of England|dispute about ritualism]].

Partly because bishops refused to give livings to Tractarian priests, many of them began working in [[slum]]s. From their new ministries, they developed a critique of [[Poor relief|British social policy]], both local and national. One of the results was the establishment of the [[Christian Social Union (U.K.)|Christian Social Union]], of which a number of bishops were members, where issues such as the just wage, the system of property renting, [[infant mortality]] and industrial conditions were debated. The more radical Catholic Crusade was a much smaller organisation than the Oxford Movement. Anglo-Catholicism – as this complex of ideas, styles and organisations became known – had a significant influence on global Anglicanism.

==End of Newman's involvement and receptions into Roman Catholicism==
One of the principal writers and proponents of Tractarianism was [[John Henry Newman]], a popular Oxford priest who, after writing his final tract, "[[Tract 90]]", became convinced that the Branch Theory was inadequate. Concerns that Tractarianism was a disguised Roman Catholic movement were not unfounded; Newman believed that the Roman and Anglican churches were wholly compatible. He was received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1845 and was ordained a priest of the Church the same year. He later became a cardinal (but not a bishop). Writing on the end of Tractarianism as a movement, Newman stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;I saw indeed clearly that my place in the Movement was lost; public confidence was at an end; my occupation was gone. It was simply an impossibility that I could say any thing henceforth to good effect, when I had been posted up by the marshal on the buttery-hatch of every College of my University, after the manner of discommoned pastry-cooks, and when in every part of the country and every class of society, through every organ and opportunity of opinion, in newspapers, in periodicals, at meetings, in pulpits, at dinner-tables, in coffee-rooms, in railway carriages, I was denounced as a traitor who had laid his train and was detected in the very act of firing it against the time-honoured Establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Tractarian Movement|url = http://victorianweb.org/religion/herb7.html|website = victorianweb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Newman was one of a number of Anglican clergy who were received into the Roman Catholic Church during the 1840s who were either members of, or were influenced by, Tractarianism.

Other people influenced by Tractarianism who became Roman Catholics included:
*[[Thomas William Allies]], ecclesiastical historian and Anglican priest.
*[[Edward Badeley]], ecclesiastical lawyer.
*[[Robert Hugh Benson]], son of the Archbishop of Canterbury, novelist and [[monsignor]].
*[[John Chapman (priest)|John Chapman]], [[Patristics|patristic]] scholar and Roman Catholic priest.
*[[Augusta Theodosia Drane]], writer and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] prioress.
*[[Frederick William Faber]], theologian, hymn writer, Oratorian and Roman Catholic priest.
*[[Robert Stephen Hawker]], poet and Anglican priest (became a Roman Catholic on his deathbed).
*[[James Hope-Scott]], barrister and Tractarian (received with Manning).
*[[Gerard Manley Hopkins]], poet and [[Jesuit]] priest.
*[[Ronald Knox]], Biblical text translator and Anglican priest.
*[[Thomas Cooper Makinson]], Anglican priest.
*[[Henry Edward Manning]], later Cardinal [[Archbishop of Westminster]].
*[[St. George Jackson Mivart]], biologist (later interdicted by Cardinal [[Herbert Vaughan]]).
*[[John Brande Morris]], Orientalist, eccentric and Roman Catholic priest.
*[[Augustus Pugin]], architect.
*Richard Sibthorp, Anglican (and sometime Roman Catholic) priest (the first to convert; later reconverted)

{{History of Iran}}
The '''Paduspanids''' or '''Baduspanids''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: پادوسبانیان) were a local dynasty of [[Tabaristan]] which ruled over [[Royan, Iran|Royan]], [[Nur, Iran|Nur]] and Rostamdar. The dynasty was established in 665,&lt;ref&gt;''The Political and Dynastic History of the Iranian World (A.D. 1000-1217)'', C.E. Bosworth, '''The Cambridge History of Iran''', Volume 5, ed. J. A. Boyle, John Andrew Boyle, (Cambridge University Press, 2001), 29.&lt;/ref&gt; and ended in 1598 when the [[Safavids]] invaded their domains.&lt;ref name="iranicaonline.org"&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/baduspanids ''BADUSPANIDS'', W. Madelung, '''Encyclopaedia Iranica''']&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The founder of the Paduspanid dynasty was Paduspan I, (also known by the Arabicized form ''Baduspan''), who was the son of [[Gil Gavbara]],&lt;ref name="iranicaonline.org"/&gt; the founder of the [[Dabuyid dynasty]]. Thus making the Paduspanids of [[Sasanian]] descent like the Dabuyids.

'''Purusha Mruga''' was renowned as one of the biggest devotees of Lord [[Shiva]]. As the name suggests, he was half man and half animal.He was also called " Vyaghrapada". In the [[Mahabharata]], the [[Pandavas]] were performing the [[Rajasuya]] Yagna. [[Yudhishthira]] suggested that Purusha Mruga's presence in the Rajasuya Yagna would be most auspicious and assigned [[Bhima]] to invite the revered guest. Bhima, on his way, is said to have met an old monkey who was [[Hanuman]] in disguise. After inquiring about the purpose of Bhima's journey, Hanuman plucked three strands of hair from his tail and handed them to him, saying it would be of help later. Taking blessings of Hanuman, Bhima continued on the journey. On meeting Purusha Mruga, Bhima introduced himself and requested the kind devotee's presence in the Rajasuya Yagna. Purusha Mruga calmly stated that he would attend the ceremony only on one condition. Bhima would have to run towards [[Hastinapur]] and he would try to catch him. In the event that Bhima was caught outside the boundary of Hastinapur, Purusha Mruga would eat him. Since Yudhishthira was very keen on Purusha Mruga's attendance, Bhima accepted the challenge.

Bhima ran very fast and was confident that he could not be caught. He turned back, though, only to find Purusha Mruga gaining on him and almost about to catch him. Bhima remembered about the three hair strands which Hanuman gave him. He dropped one of them and found it was replaced by millions of Shiva [[Lingam]]. Purusha Mruga, being a Shiva [[Bhakta]], stopped to pay his respects to each of these. Bhima, pleased by the boon, nevertheless continued running, but soon he found Purusha Mruga trailing him closely after worshipping all the Shiva Lingams. He dropped the second hair. The same process ensued. Similarly, Bhima dropped the third hair too. Finally, when nearing the door of Hastinapur and almost crossing it, Purusha Mruga got hold of Bhima's leg. Purusha Mruga told Bhima that he would eat him. Bhima, though, claimed to have entered Hastinapur. At that moment, Yushishthira and [[Krishna]] arrived on the scene. After narrating the entire incident to Yudhishthira, Purusha Mruga demanded justice. Yudhishthira pointed out that Bhima's leg was the only part outside the boundary of Hastinapur and therefore, legally Purusha Mruga could eat his leg only. Pleased by the impartial and thoughtful justice imparted by Yushishthira (Dharmaraja), Purusha Mruga showered lavish praise on him and let Bhima go. He blessed the Rajasuya Yagna and the Pandavas by attending the ceremony.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7710">The '''religious views of Fidel Castro''' are a matter of public interest. According to the ''[[Washington Post]]'', former President of [[Cuba]] [[Fidel Castro]]'s letters from prison suggest that he "was a man of unusual spiritual depth – and a fervent believer in God."&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost2007"/&gt; Writing to the father of a fallen comrade, Castro writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;
I will not speak of him as if he were absent, he has not been and he will never be. These are not mere words of consolation. Only those of us who feel it truly and permanently in the depths of our souls can comprehend this. Physical life is ephemeral, it passes inexorably. . . . This truth should be taught to every human being – that the immortal values of the spirit are above physical life. What sense does life have without these values? What then is it to live? Those who understand this and generously sacrifice their physical life for the sake of good and justice – how can they die? God is the supreme idea of goodness and justice.&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost2007"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/23/AR2007022301723.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Letters From Prison: Castro Revealed | date=February 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Castro was [[baptized]] and raised a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] as a child but did not practice as one. In [[Oliver Stone]]'s documentary ''[[Comandante_(film)|Comandante]]'', Castro states "I have never been a believer", and has total conviction that there is only one life.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|WLUcOqeoKck|Comandante – Fidel Castro &amp; Oliver Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope John XXIII]] [[excommunication|excommunicated]] Castro in 1962 after Castro suppressed Catholic institutions in Cuba.&lt;ref name="Pope Excommunicates Castro"&gt;{{cite news|date= January 3, 1962|title= Pope Excommunicates Castro|publisher=Chronicle Telegram|url = https://www.nytimes.com/library/world/012698pope-cuba-rdp.html|id= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Castro has publicly criticized what he sees as elements of the [[Bible]] that have been used to justify the oppression of both women and people of African descent throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cas09|Castro and Ramonet 2009]]. pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Castro agreed to loosen restrictions on religion and even permitted church-going Catholics to join the [[Communist Party of Cuba]]. He began describing his country as "[[Secularism|secular]]" rather than "[[atheist]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Pope John Paul II's visit to Cuba|journal=The New York Times -on the Web|url= https://www.nytimes.com/library/world/cuba-pope-index.html|ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Cuba in 1998, the first visit by a reigning pontiff to the island. Castro and the Pope appeared side by side in public on several occasions during the visit. Castro wore a dark blue business suit rather than fatigues in his public meetings with the Pope and treated him with reverence and respect.&lt;ref name="Pope Condemns Embargo"&gt;{{cite news|first= Larry|last= Rother|date= January 28, 1998|title= Pope Condemns Embargo; Castro Attends Mass|work=The New York Times|url = https://www.nytimes.com/library/world/012698pope-cuba-rdp.html|id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In December 1998, Castro formally re-instated Christmas Day as the official celebration for the first time since its abolition by the Communist Party in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=5 December 1998|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/228764.stm|title = Castro ratifies Christmas holiday|publisher=BBC News |accessdate =May 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cubans were again allowed to mark [[Christmas]] as a holiday and to openly hold religious processions. The Pope sent a telegram to Castro thanking him for restoring Christmas as a public holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=28 December 1998|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/243705.stm|title = Pope's Christmas message for Castro|publisher=BBC News |accessdate =May 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Castro attended a Roman Catholic convent blessing in 2003. The purpose of this unprecedented event was to help bless the newly restored convent in [[Old Havana]] and to mark the fifth anniversary of the Pope's visit to Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=9 March 2003|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2833699.stm|title = Castro attends convent blessing|publisher=BBC News |accessdate =May 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The senior spiritual leader of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] faith arrived in Cuba in 2004, the first time any Orthodox Patriarch has visited Latin America in the Church's history: [[Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I]] consecrated a cathedral in Havana and bestowed an honor on Fidel Castro.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wcc-coe.org/wcc/what/mission/evlet1-2004.html A new Greek Orthodox Cathedral consecrated in Havana, Cuba] www.wcc-coe.org March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; His aides said that he was responding to the decision of the Cuban Government to build and donate to the Orthodox Christians a tiny Orthodox cathedral in the heart of old Havana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Gibbs|first = Stephen|date=22 January 2004|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3418733.stm|title = Castro greets Orthodox patriarch|publisher=BBC News |accessdate =May 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Pope John Paul II]]'s death in April 2005, an emotional Castro attended a [[funeral mass|mass]] in his honor in Havana's cathedral and signed the Pope's condolence book at the Vatican Embassy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Newman|first = Lucia |date=April 6, 2005|url = http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/americas/04/04/pope.castro/|title = Castro signs pope's condolence book|publisher=CNN  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had last visited the cathedral in 1959, 46 years earlier, for the wedding of one of his sisters. Cardinal [[Jaime Lucas Ortega y Alamino]] led the mass and welcomed Castro, who was dressed in a black suit, expressing his gratitude for the "heartfelt way to the death of our Holy Father John Paul II was received (in Cuba)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Batista|first = Carlos|date= April 5, 2005|url = http://www.caribbeannewsnow.com/caribnet/2005/04/05/mourns.shtml|title = Fidel Castro mourns pope at Havana cathedral|publisher=Caribbean Net News|accessdate =May 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2009 spoken autobiography, Castro said that Christianity exhibited "a group of very humane precepts" which gave the world "ethical values" and a "sense of social justice", before relating that "If people call me Christian, not from the standpoint of religion but from the standpoint of social vision, I declare that I am a Christian."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cas09|Castro and Ramonet 2009]]. p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 28, 2012, Castro had a 30-minute meeting with [[Pope Benedict XVI]], during the Pope's three day visit to Cuba. The Pope had previously called for an end to the U.S. embargo on Cuba, and the Pope made statements encouraging a more open Cuban society, while Castro asked the Pope about his role and about the changes the Church had experienced over the last century.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-pope-idUSBRE82Q18W20120329&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-17542469&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/the-pope/9172463/Pope-Benedict-XVI-meets-frail-looking-Fidel-Castro-in-Cuba.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 20, 2015, Castro met with [[Pope Francis]] during the Pope's three day visit to Cuba. where they discussed protecting the environment and the problems of the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;https://nypost.com/2015/09/20/pope-francis-meets-fidel-castro/&lt;/ref&gt;

The supporters of Islamisation on the other hand assert that Pakistan was founded as a Muslim state and that in its status as an [[Islamic republic]], it must thereby implement Islamic laws, known as [[Shariat]].

One of Pakistan's most popular media outlets, [[Dawn (newspaper)]], was originally founded by Jinnah and still identifies as secular.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dawn.com/news/1398695&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dawn.com/news/1334995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://aurora.dawn.com/news/1140996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dawn.com/news/659634&lt;/ref&gt; Other popular media outlets like [[Express Tribune]], [[Daily Times (Pakistan)]], and [[Pakistan Today]] also identify on a liberal and progressive platform. 

==History==
Although Pakistan was founded as a separate state for Muslims in the [[Indian subcontinent]] in 1947, it remained a [[Dominion of Pakistan|Dominion]] in the [[British Commonwealth]] and did not immediately become an [[Islamic state]]. Although the 1949 [[Objectives Resolution]] envisaged an official role for [[Islam]] as the state religion, the state retained the most of the laws that were inherited from the secular British legal code that had been enforced by the [[British Raj]] since the 19th century.

In 1956, the state adopted the name of the "Islamic Republic of Pakistan", declaring Islam as the official religion, but did not take any further measures to adopt Islamic laws. The country's military rulers General [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1958–1969) and General [[Yahya Khan]] (1969–1971) continued a secularist tradition and repressed much of Islamist political activism.

==Jinnah's address==
{{See also|Freedom of religion in Pakistan}}
There are diverse opinions in Pakistan about whether [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah|Jinnah]] envisioned Pakistan to be a secular state or an Islamic state. His views as expressed in his policy speech on 11 August 1947 said:

{{Quotation|There is no other solution. Now what shall we do? Now, if we want to make this great State of Pakistan happy and prosperous, we should wholly and solely concentrate on the well-being of the people, and especially of the masses and the poor. If you will work in co-operation, forgetting the past, burying the hatchet, you are bound to succeed. If you change your past and work together in a spirit that everyone of you, no matter to what community he belongs, no matter what relations he had with you in the past, no matter what is his colour, [[caste]] or creed, is first, second and last a citizen of this State with equal rights, privileges, and obligations, there will be no end to the progress you will make.

I cannot emphasize it too much. We should begin to work in that spirit and in course of time all these angularities of the majority and minority communities, the [[Hindu]] community and the [[Muslim]] community, because even as regards Muslims you have [[Pashtun people|Pathans]], [[Punjabi people|Punjabis]], [[Shi'a Islam|Shia's]], Sunnis and so on, and among the Hindus you have [[Brahmins]], Vashnavas, [[Khatris]], also Bengalis, Madrasis and so on, will vanish. Indeed if you ask me, this has been the biggest hindrance in the way of India to attain the freedom and independence and but for this we would have been free people long long ago. No power can hold another nation, and specially a nation of 400&amp;nbsp;million souls in subjection; nobody could have conquered you, and even if it had happened, nobody could have continued its hold on you for any length of time, but for this. Therefore, we must learn a lesson from this. &lt;u&gt;You are free; you are free to go to your [[Hindu temple|temples]], you are free to go to your mosques or to any other place or worship in this state of Pakistan. You may belong to any religion or caste or creed that has nothing to do with the business of the state.&lt;/u&gt; As you know, history shows that in England, conditions, some time ago, were much worse than those prevailing in India today. The Roman Catholics and the Protestants persecuted each other. Even now there are some states in existence where there are discriminations made and bars imposed against a particular class. Thank God, we are not starting in those days. We are starting in the days where there is no discrimination, no distinction between one community and another, no discrimination between one caste or creed and another. &lt;u&gt; We are starting with this fundamental principle that we are all citizens and equal citizens of one state.&lt;/u&gt; The people of England in course of time had to face the realities of the situation and had to discharge the responsibilities and burdens placed upon them by the government of their country and they went through that fire step by step. Today, you might say with justice that Roman Catholics and Protestants do not exist; what exists now is that every man is a citizen, an equal citizen of Great Britain and they are all members of the nation.

&lt;u&gt;Now I think we should keep that in front of us as our ideal and you will find that in course of time Hindus would cease to be Hindus and Muslims would cease to be Muslims, not in the religious sense, because that is the personal faith of each individual, but in the political sense as citizens of the state.&lt;/u&gt; ''Jinnah, August 11, 1947 –chairing the constituent assembly.''}}

“….Religion should not be allowed to come into Politics….Religion is merely a matter between man and God”. [Jinnah, Address to the Central Legislative Assembly, 7 February 1935]

“….in the name of Humanity, I care more for them [the Untouchables] than for Mussalmans. ” [Jinnah, Speaking about the Shudras or Untouchables, during his address at the All India Muslim League session at Delhi, 1934 ]

“….I am not fighting for Muslims, believe me, when I demand Pakistan.” [Jinnah, Press Conference, 14 November 1946]

”But make no mistake : Pakistan is NOT a theocracy or anything like it.” [ Jinnah, Message to the people of Australia, 19 February 1948 ]

{{Quotation|The [[constitution of Pakistan]] has yet to be framed by the Pakistan Constituent Assembly. I do not know what the ultimate shape of this constitution is going to be, but I am sure that it will be of a democratic type, embodying the essential principle of Islam. Today, they are as applicable in actual life as they were 1,300 years ago. Islam and its idealism have taught us democracy. It has taught equality of man, justice and fairplay to everybody. We are the inheritors of these glorious traditions and are fully alive to our responsibilities and obligations as framers of the future constitution of Pakistan. &lt;u&gt;In any case Pakistan is not going to be a theocratic State to be ruled by priests with a divine mission. We have many non-Muslims—Hindus, Christians, and Parsis — but they are all Pakistanis. They will enjoy the same rights and privileges as any other citizens and will play their rightful part in the affairs of Pakistan.&lt;/u&gt; '' Broadcast talk to the people of the United States on Pakistan recorded February, 1948.''}}

It has been argued by secularists that in this speech Jinnah wanted to point out that Pakistan would be a secular state. But Islamists argue that associating an Islamic state with a theocratic state is wrong and a true Islamic state would also be giving the said rights to the minorities and hold them in equal status and this statement was rather to distinguish it from a religious oligarchy.
{{Rquote|right| The words are Jinnah’s; the thought and belief are an inheritance from the [[Muhammad|Prophet]] who said thirteen centuries before, "All men are equal in the eyes of [[Allah|God]]. And your lives and your properties are all sacred: in no case should you attack each other’s life and property. Today I trample under my feet all distinctions of [[caste]], colour and [[nationality]]" |, [[Hector Bolitho]], &lt;small&gt;remarks about Jinnah's address to the Constituent Assembly (1947)&lt;/small&gt;}}

[[Islamist]]s use these statements of Jinnah for [[Counterpropaganda]]:

* I have one underlying principle in mind: the principle of '''[[Islamic democracy|Muslim democracy]]'''. It is my belief that our salvation lies in following the golden rules of conduct set for us by our great lawgiver, the [[Muhammad|Prophet of Islam]].
** In 1948, Address to [[Sibi]] Darbar
* I cannot understand the logic of those who have been deliberately and mischievously propagating that the Constitution of Pakistan will not be based on '''[[Sharia|Islamic Sharia]]'''. Islamic principles today are as much applicable to life as they were 1300 years ago.
** Address to [[Karachi]] Bar Association on 25 January 1948
* Pakistan not only means freedom and independence but '''[[Two-nation theory|Muslim ideology]]''' which has to be preserved which has come to us a precious gift and treasure and which we hope, others will share with us.
** Address to Frontier Muslim Students Federation on 18 June 1945
* It is extremely difficult to appreciate why our [[Hindu]] friends fail to understand the real nature of [[Islam]] and [[Hinduism]]. They are not religions in the strict sense of the word, but are, in fact, different and distinct social orders, and it is a dream that the Hindus and Muslims can ever evolve a common nationality, and this misconception of one Indian nation has troubles and will lead India to destruction if we fail to revise our notions in time. The Hindus and Muslims belong to two different religious philosophies, social customs, litterateurs. They neither intermarry nor interdine together and, indeed, they belong to two different civilizations which are based mainly on conflicting ideas and conceptions. Their aspect on life and of life are different. It is quite clear that Hindus and Mussalmans (Muslims) derive their inspiration from different sources of history. They have different epics, different heroes, and different episodes. Very often the hero of one is a foe of the other and, likewise, their victories and defeats overlap. To yoke together two such nations under a single state, one as a numerical minority and the other as a majority, must lead to growing discontent and final destruction of any fabric that may be so built for the government of such a state.
** Presidential Address to [[All India Muslim League]]'s Session on 22 March 1940
* I have full faith in my people that they will rise to every occasion worthy of our' past '''[[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic history, glory and traditions]]'''.
** Message to the Nation on the occasion of the first Anniversary of Pakistan on 14 August 1948
* Islam lays great emphasis on the social side of things. Every day, the rich and the poor, the great and the small living in a locality are brought five times in a day in the mosque in the terms of perfect equality of mankind and thereby the foundation of a healthy social relationship is laid and established through prayer. At the end of Ramazan comes the new moon, the crescent as a signal for a mass gathering on the ‘Id day again in perfect equality of mankind which effects the entire [[Muslim world]].
** Message on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr in October 1941
*  The '''[[Quran]]''' is the general code for the Muslims, a religious, social, civil, commercial, military, judicial, criminal and penal code. It regulates every thing, from the ceremonies of religion to those of daily life, from the salvation of the soul to the health of the body, from the rights of all to those of each individual from morality to crime; from punishment here to that in the life to come, and the Holy Prophet [[Mohammad]]  has enjoined on Muslims that every Musalman should possess a copy of the Quran '''and be his own priest'''. Therefore, Islam is not merely confined to the spiritual tenets and doctrines or ritual and ceremonies. It is a complete code regulating the whole Muslim society, every department of life, collective and individual.
** Eid-ul-Fitar message in September 1945
* As you may be aware, the Government has been making genuine efforts to allay the fears and the suspicions of the minorities and if their (Hindu minority's) exodus from [[Sindh]] still continues, it is Not because they are not wanted here, but because they are more prone to listen to people across the border who are interested in pulling them out. I am sorry for those misguided people for nothing but disillusionment awaits them in their 'PROMISED LAND'.
** Reply to an address of the Welcome Note presented by the [[Parsi]] Community of Sindh, Karachi on 3 February 1948
* I shall watch with keenness the work of your Research Organization in evolving [[Islamic banking|banking practices compatible with Islamic ideas of social and economic life]]. The economic system of the West has created almost insoluble problems for humanity and to many of us it appears that only a miracle can save it from disaster that is not facing the world. It has failed to do justice between man and man and to eradicate friction from the international field. On the contrary, it was largely responsible for the two world wars in the last half century. The [[Western world]], in spite of its advantages, of mechanization and industrial efficiency is today in a worse mess than ever before in history. The adoption of Western economic theory and practice will not help us in achieving our goal of creating a happy and contended people. We must work our destiny in our own way and present to the world an economic system based on true Islamic concept of equality of manhood and social justice. We will thereby be fulfilling our mission as Muslims and giving to humanity the message of peace which alone can save it and secure the welfare, happiness and prosperity of mankind.
** Address on occasion of opening of [[State Bank of Pakistan]] (1 July 1948)
* When we say '''This flag (Muslim League's flag) is the flag of Islam''' they think we are introducing religion into politics - '''a fact of which we are proud'''. Islam gives us a complete code. It is not only religion but it contains laws, philosophy and politics. In fact, it contains everything that matters to a man from morning to night. When we talk of Islam we take it as all embracing word. We do not mean any ill. The foundation of our Islamic code is that we stand for liberty, equality and fraternity.
** Address to the Gaya Muslim League Conference in January 1938

==Objectives resolution==
Early in the history of the state of Pakistan (12 March 1949), a parliamentary resolution (the [[Objectives Resolution]]) was adopted :

{{Quote|[[Sovereignty]] belongs to [[Allah]] alone but He has delegated it to the State of Pakistan through its people for being exercised within the limits prescribed by Him as a sacred trust.
*The State shall exercise its powers and authority through the elected representatives of the people.
*The principles of democracy, freedom, equality, tolerance and social justice, as enunciated by Islam, shall be fully observed.
*Muslims shall be enabled to order their lives in the individual and collective spheres in accordance with the teachings of Islam as set out in the Quran and Sunnah.
*Provision shall be made for the religious minorities to freely profess and practice their religions and develop their cultures.}}

This resolution later became key source of inspiration for writers of [[Constitution of Pakistan]] and is included in constitution as preamble.

==Islamization==
{{verify-section|date=October 2017}}
As a reaction to the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|bifurcation of Pakistan]] (due to the rise of [[Bangladesh Awami League|secularist forces]] in [[East Pakistan]]) in 1971, Islamic political parties began to see an increase in popular support. In the 1970s, the populist and elected [[Prime minister of Pakistan|Prime minister]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] caved in to a major demand of the Islamic parties by declaring the [[Ahmadiyya Community]] to be non-Muslims. Under the [[Constitution of Pakistan|constitution]] of 1973, Bhutto also banned alcohol, gambling and night clubs.

Bhutto was [[Operation Fair Play|overthrown]] in 1977 by [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of Army Staff]] General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]], who went considerably further with the formal campaign of [[Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization|Islamization of Pakistan]] (1977–1988). However, [[Pakistan]] is still a semi-[[secular]] state and [[Islamist]]s and [[Islamic democracy|Islamic democratic]] parties in [[Pakistan]] are relatively less influential then democratic Islamists of other Muslim democracies. (''See also'': [[Islam and secularism]])

==Secularization==
{{Verify-section|date=October 2017}}
Pakistan elected [[Muslim world]]'s first female prime minister [[Benazir Bhutto]] in 1988 (and again in 1993). She did not repeal most of the Islamic laws of [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]] (her father) and General (later president) [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]], but promoted secularism through media, cultural policies, general policy making and style of governance, etc. Military ruler [[Pervez Musharraf]] promoted secularism under the banner of ''[[Enlightened Moderation]]'' during his nine years long military rule (1999–2008).

Benazir Bhutto's assassination in 2007 and the murder of [[Salman Taseer]], a Pakistani politician calling for the removal of the blasphemy laws, have provoked secularists in Pakistani politics, media and civil society. Government led by Bhutto's [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] has followed the legacy of [[Benazir Bhutto]]'s secular style of governance during five years long democratic period (2008–2013).

'''''{{transl|he|Shituf}}''''' ({{lang-he|שִׁתּוּף}}; also [[Romanization of Hebrew|transliterated]] as ''{{transl|he|shittuf}}'' or ''{{transl|he|schituf}}''; literally "association") is a term used in [[Judaism|Jewish]] sources for the worship of [[God in Judaism|God]] in a manner which [[Judaism]] does not deem to be pure [[monotheism|monotheistic]]. The term connotes a [[theology]] that is not outright [[polytheism|polytheistic]], but also should not be seen as purely monotheistic. The term is primarily used in reference to the Christian [[Trinity]] by Jewish legal authorities who wish to distinguish Christianity from full-blown polytheism. Though a Jew would be forbidden from maintaining a ''shituf'' theology, non-Jews would, in some form, be permitted such a theology without being regarded as [[idolatry|idolaters]] by Jews. That said, whether Christianity is ''shituf'' or formal polytheism remains a debate in [[Jewish philosophy]].

''Shituf'' is first mentioned in the commentary of [[Tosafot]] on the [[Talmud#Babylonian Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 63b&lt;/ref&gt; in a passage concluding with a lenient ruling regarding non-Jews. Later authorities are divided between those who view Tosfot as permitting non-Jews to swear by the name of God even if they associate other deities with that name,&lt;ref&gt;[[Yechezkel Landau|Noda B'Yehuda]], YD 148&lt;/ref&gt; and those who view Tosfot as permitting non-Jews to actually worship such deities.

Though ''shituf'' is primarily used as a means of determining how to relate to Christians, it is applied to other religions as well.&lt;ref&gt;''The Path of the Righteous Gentile: An Introduction to the Seven Laws of the Children of Noah'', Chaim Clorfene and Yaakov Rogalsky&lt;/ref&gt; It is frequently used as a reason to justify [[interfaith dialogue]] with Christians.&lt;ref&gt;David Novak, ''Jewish Christian Dialogue: A Jewish Justification'', page 49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval Jewish views==
Jewish views, as codified in [[halakha|Jewish law]], are split between those who see Christianity as outright idolatry&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, ''Mishneh Torah'', Laws of Forbidden Foods 11:7, Laws of Idolatry 9:4; Commentary on Mishnah, Avodah Zarah 1:3&lt;/ref&gt; and those who see Christianity as ''shituf''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; While Christians view their worship of a trinity as monotheistic,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10499a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia, Monotheism]&lt;/ref&gt; Judaism generally rejects this view.

The Talmud warns against causing an idolater to take oaths. The commentators living in Christian Germany in the 12th century, called [[Tosafists]], permitted Jews to bring a Christian partner to court in partnership during a breakup even though the Christian would take an oath by God, which to Christians would include Jesus, by saying that so long as another deity is not mentioned explicitly, there is no forbidden oath taking place, but only an association. Although all of the Tosafists agreed that partnerships that may lead to such an oath may not be entered into originally, they disagree as to once such a partnership exists whether or not one may go to court in order to not to lose his portion of the partnership and even though such an oath is a side-effect. In a terse comment, they wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is permissible to [cause a gentile's oath through litigation with one's non-Jewish partner because] today all swear in the name of the saints to whom no divinity is ascribed. Even though they also mention God's name and have in mind another thing, in any event no idolatrous name is actually said, and they also have the Creator of the world in mind. Even though they associate (''shituf'') God's name with "something else", we do not find that it is forbidden to cause others to associate (''shituf''), and there is no issue of placing a stumbling block before the blind (see Leviticus {{Bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|19:14|HE}}) [by entering into litigation with the non-Jewish business partner, thereby causing him to take an oath] because [[Noachides]] were not warned about it.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 16th Century, the terse comment is explained as follows by [[Moses Isserles]], where it is seemingly expanded to allowing partnerships in the first place:
{{quote|Today, it is permitted [to form a partnership with Christians], because when they swear on their holy scriptures called the Evangelion, they do not hold it to be divine. Even though when they mention God they mean Jesus, they do not mention idolatry since they really mean the Creator of heaven and earth. 
Even though they mention jointly (''shituf'') God's name and another name, there is no prohibition to cause someone to jointly mention [or associate] (''shituf)'' God with another... since this association is not forbidden to gentiles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Moses Isserles]] Darkhei Moshe OH 156&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==18th-century views==

[[Moses Mendelssohn]], the 18th century [[Haskalah|Jewish Enlightenment]] thinker, used the concept of ''shituf'' as cited in Tosafot to justify any form of association of God with another entity. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[However,] the nations of the world though they recognize the entity of God ... they nevertheless worship another entity besides Him. A few worship the angels above believing that God apportioned to each one of them a nation or country ... to rule, and they have the power to do good or bad as they please.
And these are called "other gods" in the Torah.... And a few [of the nations of the world] worship the stars in the sky ... or people ... and bow down to them, as is known. And the judgment of the intellect does not require to forbid such worship to a Son of Noah if he does not intend to remove himself from the realm of God because by what [obligation] must he offer service and prayer to God alone? And if he hopes for good and fears bad from an entity besides Him and acknowledges that also that entity is subject to God, it is not beyond the intellect for him to offer sacrifices, incense, and libation and to pray to this entity be it an angel, demon, or person.... And who would say to us [Jews] that such offerings are appropriate for God only had He not warned us against [offering to other gods] in His Torah.&lt;ref&gt;MENDELSSOHN'S RELIGIOUS PERSPECTIVE OF NON-JEWS. Journal of Ecumenical Studies, Summer/Fall2004, Vol. 41, Issue 3/4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Modern views==
Some contemporary Orthodox commentators have stated the allowance for ''shituf'' extends only to belief in multiple or complex deity, but not to worship of such a thing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One contemporary view of Shituf holds that in Judaism there is allowance for Gentile belief that there are other gods besides the Creator, but forbidding actual worship of them:

So long as ascribing power to a deity other than the Creator remains conceptual, it is permissible to the Children of Noah according to many authorities. But worship of this independent being is clearly idolatry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moshiach.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=227&amp;Itemid=64 Idolatry]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, other 20th century explanations differ. Rabbi [[Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz]] (the Chazon Ish) wrote that Jewish law considers Christianity to be idolatry, and that the entire concept of ''shituf'' in Jewish law was only an ''ad hoc'' permission applying solely to oaths in court.

This position was explained by Orthodox historian of halakha Rabbi [[David Berger (professor)|David Berger]], as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Even medieval Jews understood very well that Christianity is ''[[avodah zarah]]'' of a special type. The tosafists assert that although a Christian pronouncing the name of Jesus in an oath would be taking the name of "another god," it is nonetheless the case that when Christians say the word "God," they have in mind the creator of heaven and earth. Some later authorities took the continuation of that ''Tosafot'' to mean that this special type of avodah zarah is forbidden to Jews but permissible to gentiles, so that a non-Jew who engages in Christian worship commits no sin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccjr.us/dialogika-resources/documents-and-statements/analysis/286-dabru-emet-berger Dabru Emet - Some Reservations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Still other Orthodox historians have stated that ''shituf'' may not be forbidden to non-Jews, but present this more softly. Rabbi [[Walter Wurzburger]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
With all our appreciation of Christianity as an avenue to God available to the non-Jewish world, we must not gloss over the fact that the Trinitarian faith still falls short of our universal religious ideals. While the belief in the Trinity - classified by the Halakhah as Shituph - may not be regarded as downright prohibited to the non-Jew, we still cannot recommend it as the ideal way in which the non-Jew should relate himself to God."&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.yucommentator.com/media/storage/paper652/news/2005/03/08/Features/Justification.And.Limitations.Of.Interfaith.Dialogue-880693.shtml Justification and Limitations of Interfaith Dialogue]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Conservative Rabbi [[Louis Jacobs]] took a more conciliatory approach:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Christian thinkers frequently assert that Jewish polemics against trinitarianism are based on an inadequate understanding of what the doctrine really means. It is no doubt true that crude attacks on Christianity as tritheism are unfounded (tritheism is, in fact, heresy from the Christian point of view) and there are subtleties in the doctrine which Christians have tried to uncover. But the fact remains that all Jewish thinkers have rejected trinitarianism as Judaism understands it.&lt;ref&gt;L. Jacobs 1973 ''A Jewish Theology'' p. 26 N.Y.: Berman House&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Center confronts anti-Semitism, hate and terrorism, promotes human rights and dignity, stands with Israel, defends the safety of Jews worldwide, and teaches the lessons of the Holocaust for future generations."&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&amp;b=4441471 |title=Understand Simon Wiesenthal Center's Mission|publisher=Wiesenthal.com|date=2018-11-25|accessdate=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center is headquartered in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. It is accredited as a [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) at the [[United Nations]], the [[UNESCO]], and the [[Council of Europe]].

The Center closely interacts on an ongoing basis with a variety of public and private agencies, meeting with elected officials, the [[United States]] and foreign governments, diplomats and heads of state. The Center promotes the prosecution of [[Nazism|Nazi]] war criminals, and fights against extremist groups, [[neo-Nazism]], and hate on the [[Internet]]. The Center is also involved in Holocaust and tolerance education. Its "Campus Outreach" division is part of the [[Israel on Campus Coalition]] (ICC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Campus Outreach {{!}} Simon Wiesenthal Center |url=http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&amp;b=4442075 |work=www.wiesenthal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center is named after Nazi hunter [[Simon Wiesenthal]]; Hier’s relationship with Wiesenthal deteriorated during the 1980s, and in 1993 Wiesenthal unsuccessfully petitioned the Board of Directors for Hier’s removal.&lt;ref name="Segev2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Segev|first=Tom|title=Simon Wiesenthal: The Life and Legends|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R63DQKQkye8C&amp;pg=PA361|year=2010|publisher=Jonathan Cape|isbn=978-0-224-09104-6|page=361, 455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name and leadership==
[[File:Simon Wiesenthal (1982).jpg|thumb|upright 0.8|Simon Wiesenthal]]
The organization is named after [[Simon Wiesenthal]], a famous [[Nazi hunter]]. Simon Wiesenthal had nothing to do with the operation or activities of the SWC other than giving it its name.

The SWC is headed by Rabbi [[Marvin Hier]], its dean and founder. Rabbi Abraham Cooper is the associate dean and Rabbi Meyer May is the executive director. The organization publishes a seasonal magazine, ''Response''.

==Museum of Tolerance==
{{Main|Museum of Tolerance}}

The Center's educational arm, Museum of Tolerance, was founded in 1993 and hosts 350,000 visitors annually. Some of the programs sponsored by the Museum include:
* Tools for Tolerance
* Teaching Steps to Tolerance
* Task Force Against Hate
* National Institute Against Hate Crimes
* Tools for Tolerance for Teens

[[File:Simon Wiesenthal Tolerance Center NY.JPG|thumb|Simon Wiesenthal Tolerance Center in New York City]]

New York Tolerance Center is a professional development multi-media training facility targeting educators, law enforcement officials, and state/local government practitioners.

The Simon Wiesenthal Center and its [[Museum of Tolerance]] is one of many partner organizations of the [[Austrian Service Abroad]] ([[Auslandsdienst]]) and the corresponding [[Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service]] (Gedenkdienst).

In April 2016, the [[New York City Council]] stopped funding for the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s Museum of Tolerance following the arrest of a former board member who has been accused of raising $20 million from a city correctional officers' union through kickbacks. The Simon Wiesenthal Center issued a statement saying that the member had resigned from its board on June 15, and that the Centre was unaware of any alleged unethical or illegal activities regarding its donors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/world-news/americas/1.725664 museum trustee and hedge-fund manager implicated in a union kickback scheme&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moriah Films==
Moriah Films, also known as the Jack and Pearl Resnick Film Division of the SWC, was created to produce theatrical documentaries to educate both national and international audiences, with a focus on contemporary human rights and ethical issues and Jewish experience. Two films produced by the division, [[Genocide (1981 film)|Genocide (film)]] and [[The Long Way Home (1997 film)]] have received the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moriahfilms.com |title=Moriah Films |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moriah films has worked with numerous actors to narrate their productions. Including but not limited to [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Michael Douglas]], [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Patrick Stewart]], and [[Sandra Bullock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moriahfilms.com/site/c.ahJKKYMGJjL2H/b.8079533/k.C7FD/About_Us.htm|title=About Us  -  Moriah Films  -Division of Simon Wiesenthal Center|website=www.moriahfilms.com|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Office locations==
[[File:Simon Wiesenthal Center, Los Angeles.JPG|thumb|Simon Wiesenthal Center, [[Los Angeles]]]]
The headquarters of the Simon Wiesenthal Center is in [[Los Angeles]]. However, there are also international offices located at the following cities: [[New York City]], [[Miami]], [[Toronto]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Paris]], [[Chicago]], and [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&amp;b=4441473|title=Offices Worldwide {{!}} Simon Wiesenthal Center|website=www.wiesenthal.com|access-date=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through its national and international offices the Center carries out its above mentioned mission of preserving the memory of the Holocaust.

==Simon Wiesenthal Center Annual==

Between 1984 and 1990 the Center published seven volumes of '''''Simon Wiesenthal Center Annual''''', focusing on the scholarly study of the [[Holocaust]], broadly defined.  This series is {{ISSN|0741-8450}}.

==Library and archives==
The [[Library]] and [[Archives]] of the center in L.A. has grown to a collection of about 50,000 volumes and non-print materials. Moreover, the Archives incorporates [[photographs]], [[diary|diaries]], [[Letter (message)|letters]], [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], [[Visual arts|artwork]] and rare [[books]], which are available to [[researchers]], [[students]] and the [[general public]].

== Search for Nazi war criminals ==
[[Efraim Zuroff]], director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center office in Jerusalem, is the coordinator of Nazi war crimes research worldwide for the Wiesenthal Center and the author of its annual (since 2001) "Status Report" on the worldwide investigation and prosecution of Nazi war criminals which includes a [[List of Most Wanted Nazi War Criminals according to the Simon Wiesenthal Center|"most wanted" list of Nazi war criminals]].

In November 2005, the Simon Wiesenthal Center gave the name of four suspected former Nazi criminals to German authorities. The names were the first results of [[Operation Last Chance]], a drive launched that year by the center to track down former Nazis for World War II-era crimes before they die of old age.

==References in pop culture==
The center is featured in the real-life-story-based ''[[Freedom Writers]].''  An exterior view of the center is given, and there are scenes inside the museum, showing simulation entrances to [[gas chambers]] in [[death camps]].

==Official statements==
{{Synthesis|section|date=July 2010}}

===Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)===
In 2013, the SWC released a comprehensive report on the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] (BDS) movement, which is a global campaign promoting various forms of boycott against Israel. The report analyzed the campaign throughout its various outlets and asserted that the BDS movement is a "thinly-disguised effort to coordinate and complement the violent strategy of Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim 'rejectionists' who have refused to make peace with Israel for over six decades, and to pursue a high-profile campaign composed of anti-Israel big lies to help destroy the Jewish State by any and all means". The report also noted that the BDS campaign attacks Israel's entire economy and society, holding all (Jewish) Israelis as collectively guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiesenthal.com/atf/cf/%7B54d385e6-f1b9-4e9f-8e94-890c3e6dd277%7D/REPORT_313.PDF |title=Simon Wiesenthal Center Report |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
On March 8, 2007, the head of international relations for the Simon Wiesenthal Center, Stanley Trevor Samuels, was convicted (and later acquitted in an appeal) of [[defamation]] by a [[Paris]] courthouse for accusing the French-based [[Committee for Charity and Support for the Palestinians (CBSP)]] of sending funds to the families of [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] suicide bombers.&lt;ref name="afp"/&gt;

In its filing of the suit, the CBSP labelled the accusations "ridiculous", stating that its charitable work consisted of providing aid to some 3,000 Palestinian orphans. The court ruled that documents produced by the Wiesenthal Center established no "direct or indirect participation in financing terrorism" on the part of the CBSP, and that the allegations were "seriously defamatory".&lt;ref name="afp"&gt;Nazi-hunting centre convicted for defamation. [[Agence France Presse]] (March 8, 2007). Available [http://www.expatica.com/actual/article.asp?subchannel_id=25&amp;story_id=37453 here.] Accessed 12 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wiesenthal Center appealed the court ruling, and the appeal was granted in July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&amp;b=4441467&amp;ct=7242947&amp;printmode=1 SWC news release].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran===
After a Canadian newspaper reported upon the  [[2006 Iranian sumptuary law controversy]] (based on a report written by Iranian exiles on [[Iran]]ian religious minorities being forced to wear badges identifying them to [[Muslims]]), the dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, Rabbi Marvin Hier, wrote to United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan urging the international community to pressure Iran to drop the measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iranian MPs deny report Jews will be forced to wear badges |author=Yossi Melman |newspaper=Haaretz |date=19 May 2006 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/iranian-mps-deny-report-jews-will-be-forced-to-wear-badges-1.188128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous other sources, including [[Maurice Motamed]], the Jewish member of the [[Iranian parliament]] and the [[Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Ottawa|Iranian Embassy in Canada]], refuted the report as untrue. The ''National Post'' later retracted the original article ("Iran eyes badges for Jews: Law would require non-Muslim insignia") and published an article, to the contrary ("Experts say reports of badges for Jews in Iran is untrue"). However, the Simon Wiesenthal Center refused to admit any mistake on their part and insisted that the widely debunked allegations were true.&lt;ref name=iran_refutation&gt;{{cite news|author= |title=Experts say report of badges for Jews in Iran is untrue |work=National Post |location=Canada |date=19 May 2006 |url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=6626a0fa-99de-4f1e-aebe-bb91af82abb3 |accessdate=30 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060528095512/http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=6626a0fa-99de-4f1e-aebe-bb91af82abb3 |archivedate=28 May 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
In January 2004, the [[Paris]] branch of the center asked the President of Ireland, [[Mary McAleese]], to suspend the 'Irish Museum of the Year Award' given to the [[Hunt Museum]] in [[Limerick]], until the conclusion of a demanded inquiry into the provenance of a significant number of items in the collection. He argued that this was needed due to the close ties of the founders, John and Gertrude Hunt to the head of the Nazi Party (NSDP-AO) in Ireland, among others, and British suspicions during the war of espionage activity on the part of the couple. The center also claimed, 'The "Hunt Museum Essential Guide" describes only 150 of the over 2000 objects in the Museum's collection and, notably, without providing information on their provenance - data that all museums are now required to provide in accordance with international procedure.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ria.ie/pdfs/Hunt%20Museum%20Final%20Report%20June%2006.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119093416/http://www.ria.ie/pdfs/Hunt%20Museum%20Final%20Report%20June%2006.pdf |date=November 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This essentially accused the [[Hunt Museum]] in Limerick of keeping art and artifacts looted during the Second World War, which was described as "unprofessional in the extreme" by the expert Lynn Nicholas that cleared the museum of wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;''Associated Press''(IHT September 2007)[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/09/28/europe/EU-GEN-Ireland-Nazi-Loot.php U.S. expert condemns Simon Wiesenthal Center's claims of Nazi loot in Irish museum] Retrieved 29 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/topics/Lynn+Nicholas |title=Lynn Nicholas links |publisher=Independent.ie |date=2010-11-18 |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim was taken so seriously that the examination was supervised by the prestigious [[Royal Irish Academy]], whose 2006 report is available on line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ria.ie/getmedia/c7eeb36f-5121-4ac4-9171-8fa1c9731e13/The-Hunt-Report---Final-Report.pdf.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217032055/http://www.ria.ie/getmedia/c7eeb36f-5121-4ac4-9171-8fa1c9731e13/The-Hunt-Report---Final-Report.pdf.aspx |archivedate=2013-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; McAleese, who had been written to by the center, then criticized a Dr. Samuels of the center for "a tissue of lies", adding that the center had diminished the name of Simon Wiesenthal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/0121/hunt.html |title=RTÉ News - ''President criticises claims against museum'' |publisher=Rte.ie |date=2008-01-22 |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The center said that it had prepared its own 150-page report in May 2008 that would be published after vetting by its lawyers, but had not done so as of November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Irish Times]] 7 November 2008, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; The report was finally made on 12 December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/apps/s/content.asp?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&amp;b=4442915&amp;ct=6455433 Simon Weisenthal Center Accessed 8 November 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
A branch museum in Jerusalem, expected to be completed in 2009, sparked protests from the city's Muslim population.  The museum is being built on what Rabbi Marvin Hier described as "derelict land": a thousand-year-old Muslim graveyard called the [[Mamilla Cemetery]], much of which has already been paved over.  The complaints were rejected by Israel's Supreme Court, leading to a demonstration by hundreds of people in November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patience |first=Martin |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4721336.stm |title=Row over Israeli tolerance museum |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-02-17 |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davies |first=Wyre |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7715921.stm |title=Row over Jerusalem Muslim cemetery |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-11-08 |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 19, 2008 a group of US Jewish and Muslim leaders sent a letter to the Wiesenthal Center urging it to halt the construction of the museum on the site.

As of February 2010, the Museum of Tolerance's plan for construction has been fully approved by Israeli courts and is proceeding at the compound of Mamilla Cemetery. The courts ruled that the compound had been neglected as a spiritual site by the Muslim community, in effect not functioning as a cemetery for decades (while simultaneously used for other purposes), and was thus ''mundra'', i.e. abandoned, under Muslim laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Marvin |last= Hier |url= http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-hier12-2010feb12,0,1420998.story |title=A proper site for a Museum of Tolerance |publisher=Latimes.com |date=2010-02-12 |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
The  Centre faults the [[Government of Canada]]'s efforts to investigate and prosecute Nazi war criminals,  and claims that approximately 2,000 Nazi war criminals obtained Canadian citizenship by providing false information.&lt;ref name="Yahoo"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mertl |first=Steve |url=http://ca.news.yahoo.com/blogs/dailybrew/ottawa-agrees-revisit-case-suspected-nazi-war-criminal-190942698.html |title=Ottawa agrees to revisit case of suspected Nazi war criminal Vladimir Katriuk |publisher=Ca.news.yahoo.com |date=2011-04-20 |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The Simon Wiesenthal Center opposed the construction of [[Park51]], a Muslim community center, two blocks from [[Ground Zero]]. The executive director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Museum of Tolerance in Manhattan, Rabbi Meyer May said it was "insensitive" to locate the centre there. ''[[The Jewish Week]]'' noted that the Center itself was once accused of intolerance when it built a museum in Jerusalem on land that was once a [[Mamilla Cemetery|Muslim cemetery]], after gaining approval from Israeli courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news|author=Adam Dickter |url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/breaking_news/wiesenthal_center_opposes_ground_zero_mosque |title=Wiesenthal Center Opposes Ground Zero Mosque |work=The Jewish Week |date=2010-08-06 |accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vatican===
The Simon Wiesenthal Center welcomed the news that the [[Holy See|Vatican]] has demanded that Bishop [[Richard Williamson (bishop)|Richard Williamson]] recant his views denying the Holocaust before being re-admitted to the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Williamson was one of the four priests from the Society of St. Pius X who were excommunicated 20 years ago for taking part in the consecration of Bishops contrary to Canon Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/apps/s/content.asp?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&amp;b=4442915&amp;ct=6712401 |title=Wiesenthal Center Welcomes Vatican's Call for Controversial Bishop to Recant His Denial of the Holocaust |publisher=Wiesenthal.com |date=2009-02-04 |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venezuela===
The Simon Wiesenthal Center criticized [[Hugo Chávez]] for various statements, including his January 2006 statement that "[t]he world is for all of us, then, but it so happens that a minority, the descendants of the same ones that crucified Christ, the descendants of the same ones that kicked [[Simon Bolívar|Bolívar]] out of here and also crucified him in their own way over there in [[Santa Marta]], in [[Colombia]].

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Simon Wiesenthal Center omitted the reference to Bolívar without ellipsis, stated that Chávez was referring to [[Jew]]s, and denounced the remarks as [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] by way of his allusions to wealth. Meanwhile, according to ''Forward.com'', the [[American Jewish Committee]], the [[American Jewish Congress]], and the Confederation of Jewish Associations of Venezuela defended Chávez, stating that he was speaking not of Jews, but of South America's white [[oligarchy]].  The Wiesenthal Center's representative in Latin America replied that Chávez's mention of [[Christ-killer]]s was "ambiguous at best" and that the "decision to criticize Chávez had been taken after careful consideration".&lt;ref&gt;Perelman, Marc.

===Japan===

===="Sunday Project" controversy====
The Simon Wiesenthal Center strongly denounced politician-journalist [[Soichiro Tahara]] for his remarks against former Prime Minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]] and his daughter, former Foreign Minister [[Makiko Tanaka]] on his [[TV Asahi]] program "[[Sunday Project]]" in March 2009.

In the live broadcast, Tahara told Tanaka that her father, former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka was "done in by America, by the Jews and [[Ichiro Ozawa|(Ichiro) Ozawa]], (then-leader of the [[Democratic Party of Japan]]) too, was done in (by America and/or the Jews)." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&amp;b=4441467&amp;ct=6823949|title=WIESENTHAL CENTER DENOUNCES JAPANESE TV NEWS PERSONALITY FOR BLAMING POLITICAL SCANDALS ON AMERICA AND THE JEWS|publisher=Simon Wiesenthal Center|date=March 9, 2009|accessdate=November 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kishidan Nazi outfit controversy====
SWC's associate dean, Rabbi Abraham Cooper, condemned the Japanese band [[Kishidan]] for wearing uniforms resembling those of the SS, the armed wing of the Nazi party. The band wore military-inspired uniforms, adorned with the German medal Iron Cross and Nazi insignia such as the death skull and SS eagle on [[MTV Japan]]'s primetime program "Mega Vector." Cooper said in a written protest to the band's management company [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan|Sony Music Artists]], MTV Japan and the Japanese entertainment group [[Avex Group|Avex]] (Kishidan's label at the time being and also the current one) that "there is no excuse for such an outrage" and that "many young [[Japanese people|Japanese]] are "woefully uneducated" about [[War crimes during World War II|the crimes against humanity committed by]] [[Nazi Germany]] and [[empire of Japan|Japan]] during [[World War II|the second world war]], but [[multinational corporation|global entities]] like MTV and Sony Music should know better".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/02/kishidan-nazi-uniforms-japan-aplogy|title=Japanese pop group Kishidan's 'Nazi' outfits force Sony to apologise|author=Justin McCurry|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2 March 2011|accessdate=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Soviet Union Muslim Population 1979.jpg|thumb|400px|This map shows the 1979 demographic distribution of Muslims within the Soviet Union as a percentage of the population by administrative division.]]The '''Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia and Kazakhstan (SADUM)''' ({{lang-ru|Духовное управление мусульман Средней Азии и Казахстана (САДУМ)}}; {{lang-uz|Ўрта Осиё ва Қозоғистон мусулмонлари диний бошқармаси}}) was the official governing body for [[Islam]]ic activities in the five [[Central Asia]]n republics of the [[Soviet Union]]. Under strict state control, SADUM was charged with training clergy and publishing spiritual materials, among other tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Olcott 1995, p.197&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was headquartered in [[Tashkent]], [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|Uzbekistan]]. Established in 1943, SADUM existed for nearly 50 years.

==History==

===Background===
The first spiritual assembly in the [[Russian Empire]] was established in 1788 in Orenberg. Like SADUM, the [[Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly]] was governed by a supreme mufti, and oversaw the appointment of imams and management of [[mosque]]s throughout the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Khalid 2007, p.36-37&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian administrators had been involved in the religious hierarchy of [[Russian Turkestan|Central Asia]] since the initial conquest in the 1860s, though the level of government interference varied throughout the region. Some district chiefs were directly responsible for the appointment of instructors at the local [[madrasah]]s, as well as naming the overseers of religious endowments (''[[waqf]]s''). Other chiefs retained oversight privileges, but allowed the local community to run affairs autonomously, stepping in only when disputes arose.&lt;ref name=crews&gt;Crews 2006, p.265&lt;/ref&gt;

The official attitude towards religion changed drastically under the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]]. Initially the Soviets supported religious activity, specifically that of the [[Jadid]]s, young Muslim reformers who sought to "modernize" Islam - a goal which fit nicely into Soviet ideals. In 1922 the Soviets even allowed the creation of local religious boards throughout Central Asia. These boards had many of the same functions which SADUM would inherit (though on a more limited scale) in the 1940s. The boards also were charged to be "the link between the government and the people, to conduct the reform of religious affairs and to struggle with very unnecessary superstructures of Islam and the incorrect interpretations of Islam." &lt;ref&gt;Khalid 2007, p.61&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1920s, however, the situation had changed. Having consolidated their power in the region, the Soviets began to show their true attitude towards religion. Over the next several years hundreds of mosques were closed or destroyed. The year 1927 saw the initiation of the ''[[hujum]]'', an effort to forcibly remove Muslim women's veils. By 1927 all madrasahs were shut down, and 1928 saw the elimination of [[waqf]]s. A 1929 law against religious practices effectively ended open religious activity in the country. Many Islamic leaders, including many Jadids, were "liquidated" during [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]].&lt;ref&gt;Khalid 2007, pp.71-77&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation of SADUM===
[[Image:Bukhara03.jpg|thumb|200px|Mir-i-Arab madrasah in Bukhara]]

The creation of SADUM occurred in the midst of the [[World War II|Second World War]] (known in the Soviet Union as the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]]). The [[Soviet government]], fighting for its survival and requiring the support of all its citizens, relaxed restrictions against religion.&lt;ref&gt;Khalid 2007, p.77&lt;/ref&gt; As religious persecution subsided and mosques began to re-open, the Central Asian [[ulema]] saw an opportunity to push for concessions.

In June 1943, several prominent members of the ulema petitioned [[Mikhail Kalinin]], the Chairman of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]], to permit a conference of the Central Asian religious elite in Tashkent. At this conference they planned to lay the foundations for a central Islamic organization.&lt;ref name=nizh&gt;{{cite web |last=Ziyavuddinov |first=Marazhan  | script-title=ru:Вклад династии Муфтиев Бабахановых в возрождение Ислама в Средней Азии и Казахстане |publisher=Islam in Nizhny Novgorod |date=May 14, 2007 |url=http://www.islamnn.ru/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1761 |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ulema argued that this organization would allow them to better organize the regional war effort.&lt;ref&gt;Khalid 2007, p.78&lt;/ref&gt; Desiring to shore up Muslim support for the war, the Presidium approved a plan for the creation of the Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia and Kazakhstan, to be headquartered in Tashkent. For the first kurultai, a preparation committee was formed which included notable theologists of Uzbekistan, led by [[Eshon Babakhan ibn Abdulmajidkhan]], of Kazakhstan, led by sheikh Abdul Gaffar Shamsutdin, of Tajikistan, led by sheikh Salekh Babakalon, of Kyrgystan, led by sheikh Olimkhon Tura Shakir and of Turkmenia, led by sheikh Anna Ishan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.islamnn.ru/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=print&amp;sid=1761&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization was formally established on October 20, 1943.&lt;ref name=fond&gt;{{cite web |last=Khasanov |first=Andrei  | script-title=ru:В Нижнем Новгороде учреждён Фонд имени муфтиев Бабахановых |publisher=Muslim Uzbekistan |date=November 17, 2007 |url=http://muslimuzbekistan.net/ru/centralasia/featured/story.php?ID=14328 |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its first chairman was [[Eshon Babakhan ibn Abdulmajidkhan]].

SADUM moved quickly after its founding to re-open local Islamic institutions and re-establish ties with the wider [[Muslim world]]. In 1945 a meeting was held with the [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] king [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abdul Aziz ibn Saud]], after which Soviet Muslims were allowed to participate in the [[Hajj]]. The following year, 1946, saw the reopening of the [[Mir-i-Arab madrasah]] in [[Bukhara]].&lt;ref name=fond/&gt;

A second center of Islamic learning, the Imam al-Bukhari Islamic Institute, was founded in Tashkent in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Babakhan 1980, p.73&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fracture of SADUM===

In 1990 [[Kazakhstan]] removed its ''qaziyat'' from SADUM and established an independent Muftiate for the Muslims of Kazakhstan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Religion in Kazakh politics |publisher=neweurasia |date=May 22, 2006 |url=http://kazakhstan.neweurasia.net/?p=107 |accessdate=March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new organization was renamed the Religious Administration of Kazakhstan's Muslims ({{lang-kk|Қазақстан мұсылмандары діни басқармасы}}; {{lang-ru|Духовное управление мусульман Казахстана}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{kk icon}} [http://www.muftyat.kz/ The Religious Administration of Kazakhstan's Muslims - Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[kurultai]] (or meeting) of the Muslims of Kazakhstan was held in January 1990, at which time [[Ratbek hadji Nysanbayev]], the top SADUM figure in Kazakhstan, was appointed Kazakhstan's new mufti. The president of Kazakhstan, [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]], also opened an Islamic institute in [[Almaty]] to train mullahs.&lt;ref&gt;Olcott 1995, p.262&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon independence in 1991, Uzbekistan's branch of SADUM was renamed the Muslim Board of Uzbekistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Memorandum to the U.S. Government Regarding Religious Persecution in Uzbekistan |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=August 10, 2001 |url=https://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/eca/uzbek-aug/islam.htm |accessdate=May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was placed within the responsibilities of the Committee on Religious Affairs, which is under the Cabinet of Ministers.&lt;ref name=ICG/&gt;

==Structure==

SADUM oversaw the Islamic activities in the five Soviet republics of Central Asia. The headquarters of SADUM was located in Tashkent, where the chairman of SADUM (known as the ''mufti'') held office.&lt;ref&gt;Babakhan 1980, p.57&lt;/ref&gt; The mufti was elected at a gathering of all the regional Islamic clergy, which was called a [[kurultai]]. At the kurultai a presidium was also elected, which was known as the Council of the Ulama.&lt;ref name=akb&gt;{{cite journal |last=Akbarzadeh |first=Shahram |title=Islamic Clerical Establishment in Central Asia |journal=South Asia |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=73–102 |publisher=Carfax Publishing, Taylor &amp; Francis |location=Oxfordshire, UK |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SADUM was a strict hierarchical organization.&lt;ref name=akb/&gt; Each republic had a SADUM representative office, which was headed by a [[qadi|qazi]] (except for Uzbekistan, which was headed by the mufti himself).&lt;ref&gt;Naumkin 2005, p.39&lt;/ref&gt;  Every qazi was appointed by and subordinate to the mufti in Tashkent, and within each republic all religious personal (such as [[imam]]s and [[muezzin]]s) were subordinate to their respective qazis.&lt;ref name=akb/&gt; The four ''qaziyats'' were transformed into independent spiritual boards after the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991.

Major theological questions were considered by the mufti and the Council of the Ulama, whose decisions were then related to the people through local mosques.&lt;ref&gt;Babakhan 1980, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The directorate's economic department managed the organization's finances. It also saw to the management and upkeep of all mosques and Islamic architectural monuments of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Babakhan 1980, pp.66.&lt;/ref&gt;

SADUM's center in Tashkent also included a library.&lt;ref name="KemperKalinovsky2015"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Michael Kemper |author2=Artemy M. Kalinovsky |title=Reassessing Orientalism: Interlocking Orientologies During the Cold War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sr2gBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date=February 11, 2015 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-63670-0 |pages=87–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by Ishan Babakhan, the first mufti of SADUM, shortly after the organization's creation. He donated over 2,000 of his own books to the library, and by 1980 the library had more than 30,000 works, including 2,000 manuscripts. Notable works in the collection include the first word-by-word translation of the Qur'an from Arabic to Persian, completed in 1267, and an original draft of a collection of [[hadith]]s from the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;Babakhan 1980, pp.74-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Muftis of SADUM==
The [[mufti]] of SADUM was the leader of the organization. Since SADUM was responsible for more Muslims than any other Muslim directorate in the USSR, their mufti was often referred to as the Supreme Mufti, or Grand Mufti.&lt;ref name=crews/&gt; The Babakhan family held this role for three generations, spanning nearly the entire length of SADUM's existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peyrouse |first=Sebastien |title=The Rise of Political Islam in Soviet Central Asia |journal=[[Current Trends in Islamist Ideology]] |volume=5 |pages=40–54 |publisher=Hudson Institute - Center on Islam, Democracy, and The Future of the Muslim World |location=Washington, D.C. |date=May 23, 2007 |url=http://www.futureofmuslimworld.com/research/pubID.68/pub_detail.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ziyaudin Babakhan removed [[Muhammadjan Hindustani]] from the Council of [[Ulema]] after Hindustani denounced him as a "Wahhabist". "Wahhabist" was a derogatory term used in the [[Ferghana Valley]] region for scholars whose ''fatwas'' deviated from traditional [[Hanafi]] interpretations.&lt;ref name=olcott&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Brookings Institution Press| isbn = 978-0-87003-301-8| last = Olcott| first = Martha Brill| title = In the Whirlwind of Jihad| chapter=4. Religious Leaders of the Soviet Era |date = July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1989 an internal coup was organized against the last Babakhan mufti by Muhammad-Sodiq Muhammad Yusuf, a foreign-educated imam from [[Andijon]]. After the fall of the Soviet Union and the fracture of SADUM into independent state-run organizations, Muhammad Yusuf became the first mufti of [[Uzbekistan]], but was removed from office in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Olcott |first=Martha Brill |title=A Face of Islam: Muhammad-Sodiq Muhammad-Yusuf |journal=Carnegie Papers |volume=82 |publisher=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace |location=Washington, D.C. |date=March 2007 |url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/cp_82_olcott2_final.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structural evil''' or '''systemic evil''' is [[evil]] which arises from structures within human society, rather than from individual [[wickedness]] or religious conceptions such as [[original sin]]. One example of Structural evil within a society would be [[slavery]].

Structural evil arises within human societies because of the way humans act. Multiple individuals have commented and theorized on the subject of structural evil. Among these early thinkers are [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] and [[Robespierre]]. However, more modern thinkers on this subject are [[Thomas Nagel]], [[Claudia Card]], Cynthia D. Moe-Lobeda, and John Langan.

== Early Thinkers ==

=== Jean-Jacques Rousseau ===
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] proposed that the structures of human society were the main source of evil in his works such as the [[Discourse on Inequality]] (''Discours sur l'origine et les fondements de l'inégalité parmi les hommes'').&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rousseauan Revolution and the Problem of Evil", Naming Evil, Judging Evil|last=Grant|first=Ruth|publisher=Chicago Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0226306742|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that humans are good by nature, but are rendered corrupt by society.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/rousseau/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Bertram|first=Christopher|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rousseau's reasoning is as follows: if society is supposedly composed of entirely naturally good human beings, then how can evil come about? It must come about because of the structures that are present in human society.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These ideas were influential upon French revolutionaries such as [[Robespierre]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Modern Thinkers ==

=== Thomas Nagel ===
[[Thomas Nagel]] is a modern philosopher who has argued that the great evils of the 20th century, such as [[genocide]], required extensive structural support from the societies in which they occurred.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jtPdAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=thomas+nagel+on+structural+evil&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iOMjXrXD3Y&amp;sig=5ybw96hRjJxEi11i5wZZuK0aVso&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi35JbsoMXQAhVBNpQKHS0yA3UQ6AEINjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=thomas%20nagel%20on%20structural%20evil&amp;f=false|title=Exploring Religion and Ethics: Religion and Ethics for Senior Secondary Students|last=Goldburg|first=Peta|last2=Blundell|first2=Patricia|last3=Jordan|first3=Trevor|date=2011-04-01|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521187169|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that while a few individuals have the capacity to hurt other individuals, the capacity needed to deliver the amount of destructiveness found in the great evils of the 20th century requires extensive organizational structure.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Individuals, such as Adolf Hitler, Josef Stalin, and Pol Pot, he noted may have been able to influence a whole society; however, they achieved this through manipulation of a wider social structure.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Claudia Card&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Resisting structural evil : love as ecological and economic vocation|last=Moe-Lobeda|first=Cynthia|publisher=Fortress Press|year=2013|isbn=0664252850|location=Minneapolis, Minnesota|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
[[Claudia Card]] is another modern theorist who has defined structural evil as being intolerable harm which results from the normal operation of social structures.&lt;sup&gt;[[Structural evil#cite note-FOOTNOTECard2010-4|[4]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Her list of such institutions is controversial as it includes marriage and motherhood.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Confronting Evils: Terrorism,Torture, Genocide|last=Card|first=Claudia|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=9781139491709|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== John Langan ===
John Langan, an American author, criticized and summarized Pope John Paul II ideas of how structural evil arises.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ethics, Religion, and the Good Society: New Directions in a Pluralistic World|last=Runzo|first=Joseph|publisher=Westminster/John Knox Press|year=1992|isbn=0664252850|location=Louisville, Kentucky|pages=148|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Langan states, "Institutions, structures, and societies are not the subject of moral acts, ... 'social sins are the result of the accumulation and concentration of many personal sins.'" After stating this, he points out a few criticisms in Pope John Paul II's theory.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Cynthia D. Moe-Lobeda ===
Cynthia D. Moe-Lobeda proposed that structural evil is seen in everyday life and disguised through good, inevitability, divine mandate, and social necessity.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In her book ''Resisting Structural Evil'' Moe-Lobeda states that structural evil consists of "chains that bind us into systemic exploitation of others and of the Earth" which are intricate and cleverly hidden. These "chains" come from the outside forces that include: power arrangements, ideologies, values, practices, and policies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; According to Moe-Lobeda, structural evil may go beyond the physical power of individuals to counter, but it is composed of power arrangements and other forces that are humanly constructed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Structural Evil in Western Society ==
According to Andrew Basden, a professor of Human Factors and Philosophy in Information Systems at Salford Business School at the University of Salford: Manchester, structural evil builds up and prevails because individuals contribute to its creation, accept it without protest to it and done so over a long period of time.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.basden.demon.co.uk/xn/discussion/structural.evil.html|title=Evil In The Structure of Society|website=www.basden.demon.co.uk|access-date=2016-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also puts for that there is not just one kind of structural evil, but rather that there are many.

When viewing Western society, structural evil can be found in the following aspects of reality:&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
* Biotic
* Sensitive
* Analytical
* Formative
* Lingual
* Social
* Economic
* Aesthetic
* Juridical
* Ethical
* Pistic

'''Sujata Stupa''', also '''Sujata Kuti stupa''' or '''Sujata Garh''', is a Buddhist [[stupa]] located in the village of Senanigrama ([[Bakraur]]) slightly east of [[Bodh Gaya]] in the state of [[Bihar]], [[India]]. It lies directly across the [[Phalgu]] River from the town of [[Bodh Gaya]], where [[Gautama Buddha]] is said to have attained enlightenment. It is a walk of about 20 minutes, from Bodh Gaya to Sujata Stupa. It was initially built in the 2nd century BCE as confirmed by finds of Dark Grey polished wares and a punch-marked coin in the monastery nearby.&lt;ref name=DGS/&gt;

The stupa was dedicated to the [[milkmaid]] [[Sujata (milkmaid)|Sujata]], from the village of Bakraur, who is said to have fed [[Gautama Buddha]] milk and rice at this spot as he was sitting under a [[Banyan tree]], thereby ending his seven years of fasting and [[ascetism]], and allowing him to attain illumination through the [[Middle Way]].&lt;ref name=prasoon07&gt;{{cite book |last1=Prasoon|first1=Shrikant |title=Knowing Buddha : [life and teachings] |date=2007 |publisher=Hindoology Books|location=[Delhi] |isbn=9788122309638 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Us9wbjmvXfgC&amp;pg=PT32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Planet |first1=Lonely |last2=Blasi |first2=Abigail |title=Lonely Planet India |date=2017 |publisher=Lonely Planet |isbn=9781787011991 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLU7DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1251 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dwivedi06&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dwivedi |first1=Sunita |last2=Lama |first2=Dalai (foreword) |authorlink2=14th Dalai Lama |title=Buddhist heritage sites of India|date=2006 |publisher=Rupa &amp; Co. |location=New Delhi |isbn=8129107384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stupa was originally adorned with a [[pillar of Ashoka]], which was quarried in part for building material in the 1800s, then placed at the Gol Pather intersection of Gaya, and finally moved to [[Bodh Gaya]] in 1956.&lt;ref name=DG/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=O'malley |first1=L.

The stupa was an integral part of the original landscape at Bodh Gaya, and it was reinforced and enlarged several times over the centuries.&lt;ref name=DGS&gt;{{cite book |last1=Geary |first1=David |last2=Sayers |first2=Matthew R. |last3=Amar |first3=Abhishek Singh |title=Cross-disciplinary Perspectives on a Contested Buddhist Site: Bodh Gaya Jataka |date=2012 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781136320675 |page=35-36 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f56437oiblUC&amp;pg=PA35|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Archaeological Survey of India made excavations in 1973-74 and 2001-06.&lt;ref name=ASI&gt;[http://ttnotes.com/sujata-stupa.html#gal_post_8310_sujata-stupa-bodhgaya-4.jpg ASI notice]&lt;/ref&gt; A plaque found in the excavation has an inscription from the 8th-9th century CE that reads "Devapala Rajasya Sujata Griha", [[Devapala (Pala dynasty)|Devapala]] being interpreted as the 9th century [[Pala Empire|Pala dynasty]] king, hence meaning "Sujata House, of King Devapala".&lt;ref name=BPP&gt;{{cite book |last1=Parishad |first1=Bihar Purāvid |title=The Journal of the Bihar Purävid Parishad |date=1977 |publisher=Bihar Puravid Parishad. |page=136 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BeC1AAAAIAAJ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ASI/&gt; This suggests that the last phase of construction of the stupa dates to Devapala in the 9th century CE, to commemorate the house where Sujata lived.&lt;ref name=BPP/&gt;

Before the discovery of this inscription, it was thought that this stupa had been dedicated to "Gandha-hasti", the "Perfumed elephant", and was therefore named "Gandha-hasti stupa". This interpretation was based on a description made by the 7th century Chinese pilgrim [[Hiuen Tsiang]] (in 大唐西域記: Buddhist Records of the Western World)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=大唐西域記: Buddhist Records of the Western World |date=1994 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishe |isbn=9788120811072 |page=138 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X27HtHUsLSkC&amp;pg=RA1-PA138 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; who recounted that when he crossed the river (Niranjana) and went to Bakraur, he encountered a stupa and a stone column at the place where Gandha-hasti used to dwell (referring to the place where the Buddha, in a previous life, was reborn as the offspring of a Perfumed elephant).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=O'malley |first1=L.

[[File:Salão interno.jpg|thumb|The interior of Casa das Minas, a temple of Tambor de Mina]]
'''Tambor de Mina''' is an [[Afro-Brazilian religion|Afro-Brazilian religious tradition]], practiced mainly in [[Brazil]]ian states of [[Maranhão]], [[Piauí]], [[Pará]] and the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazônia]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espiritualidades.com.br/Artigos/P_autores/PRANDI_Reginaldo_tit_Nas_pegadas_do_Voduns_um_terreiro_de_tambor-de-mina.htm|title=Reginaldo Prandi     &gt;     Nas pegadas do Voduns : um terreiro de tambor-de-mina em São Paulo   &gt;   Artigos, teses e publicações ... Espiritualidade e Sociedade ...:::|website=www.espiritualidades.com.br|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
Tambor ís [[drum]] in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and is very importance for the rhythm of worship. Mina derives from black-mina, from [[Elmina Castle|São Jorge da Mina]], denomination given to the slaves coming from "the coast located east of the Castle of São Jorge da Mina (Elmina Castle)", now [[Togo]], [[Benin]] and [[Nigeria]], which were denominate mainly as black mine-jejes and mine-nagôs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmfolclore.ufma.br/site/index.php/encantados-e-encantarias-do-tambor-de-mina/|title=Encantados e Encantarias do Tambor de Mina {{!}} Comissão Maranhense de Folclore - CMF|website=www.cmfolclore.ufma.br|language=pt-BR|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Slavery in Maranhão was concentrated on the Capital ([[São Luís, Maranhão|São Luís]]), the [[Itapecuru River|Itapecuru Valley]] and the [[Baixada Maranhense Environmental Protection Area|Baixada Maranhense]]. cotton and sugar cane plantations, which contributed to the development of a large city, the grandeur of the colonial houses, built with slave labor, and the harmony, beauty and choreography of songs of African origin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Beliefs ==
[[File:Atrio principal.jpg|thumb|The interior of Casa das Minas, with a photo of the last complete initiation ceremony (boat), in 1914. The floor is made of clay]]
Tambor of Mina worships vodums, [[Orisha|orixás]], and entities (also called Encantados, spirits of people) who are called gentis (if they are of European origin, like [[Sebastianism|King Sebastian of Portugal]]) or caboclas (if they are of native origin, like João da Mata, and Sultão das Matas).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Tambor de Mina is a mixture of of [[Dahomean religion|Dahomey Religion]], [[Fon people|fon]] (jeje), [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba Religion]] (nagô), [[Fante people|fanti]]-[[Ashanti people|ashanti]], [[Ketu (Benin)|ketu,]] agrono or [[Cabinda Province|cambinda]] (angola-congo), Indigenous American and European traditions (Roman Catholicism).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|title=Tambor de Mina – da África para o Brasil {{!}} Retratos de Fé {{!}} TV Brasil {{!}} Notícias|url=http://tvbrasil.ebc.com.br/retratosdefe/episodio/tambor-de-mina-da-africa-para-o-brasil|language=pt-br|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of this cultural richness and syncretism present in the cult, these elements coexist in a harmonious way, being almost impossible to separate popular Catholicism, local folklore and the Encantaria, the Cure or Pajelança from the Tambor de Mina..&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the temples of Tambor de Mina it is common to hold feasts and parties of the popular culture of Maranhão that are sometimes requested by spiritual entities that like them, such as the Feast of the Divine Holy Spirit, [[Bumba Meu Boi|Bumba-meu-boi]], Tambor de Crioula and others.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Terecô is the denomination of one of the Afro-Brazilian religions of the cities of [[Codó]] (called capital of macumba, by the great number of terreiros, or temples of afrobrazilian religions) in Maranhão and [[Teresina]] in Piauí, derived from Tambor de Mina. 

== Temples and priesthood ==
[[File:Vista externa da fachada da casa.jpg|thumb|Casa das Minas, in São Luís.]]
There are two main models of Tambor de Mina in Maranhão: jeje and Nagô. The former seems to be the oldest and settled around the Casa Grande das Minas Jeje, better known as [[:pt:Casa_das_Minas|Casa das Minas]] (Querebentã de Tói Zomadônu or House of Minas), the oldest temple (terreiro), which must have been founded in São Luís in the [[1840s]]. The other, which is almost contemporary and which continues to this day, has settled around the Casa de Nagô (House of Nagô). Casa das Minas and Casa de Nagô are located in the same neighborhood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Casa das Minas (Querebentã of Tói Zomadônu) is unique, it does not have houses that are affiliated to it, therefore no other completely follows its style. It was founded by an African woman named Maria Jesuina, who came to Brazil as a slave and, according to Pierre Verger, was the Queen Nã Agontimé, Wife of King Agonglô of Daôme and mother of King Guezô. The most famous priestess (vondunsi) of the temple was Mother Andressa Maria, considered the last princess of Fon direct lineage tha headed the Casa das Minas. She was born in [[1850]] and died in [[1954]], at the age of 104.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In this house, the songs are in language jeje (Ewe-Fon) and only are worshiped deities called voduns, but although it does not have affiliated houses, the cult model of the Tambor de Mina is greatly influenced by the Casa das Minas. In the Casa das Minas, only women can command religious ceremonies. They are called vodunsis, the priestess of Tambor de Mina. The men had a special function of drum players, that is, abatás, hence the definition of "abatazeiros". The last vodunsi (Dona Deni) died in 2015, having been no full priesthood initiation rituals since [[1914]] (for reasons not clarified). There are still many festivals of popular culture in the temple, such as Feast of the Divine Holy Spirit, Tambor de Crioula, Bumba-meu-boi and others, with the Casa das Minas continuing with much cultural relevance. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Casa de Nagô (Nagon Abioton) was founded by Josefa (Zefa de Nagô) and Maria Joana Travassos, african women of yourubá tradition, helped by the founder of Casa das Minas. They worship voduns, orixás (Yoruba deities), gentis and caboclos. The House of Nagô influenced the formation of the other terreiros (temples) of São Luís.

There are hundreds of Temples of Tambor de Mina, headed by women called vodunsis and men called vodunos, in Maranhão (like Casa Fanti Ashanti), or with origin from Maranhão, in Piauí, Pará (Terreiro de Tambor de Mina Dois Irmãos), Amazonas, in the Southeastern Region, like the Casa das Minas Toya Jarina, in the [[São Paulo (state)|state of São Paulo]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Temple of Kalabsha''' (also '''Temple of Mandulis''') is an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[Egyptian temple|temple]] that was originally located at Bab al-Kalabsha (Gate of Kalabsha), approximately 50 km south of [[Aswan]].&lt;ref&gt;Lorna Oakes, Pyramids, Temples and Tombs of Ancient Egypt: An Illustrated Atlas of the Land of the Pharaohs, Hermes House:Anness Publishing Ltd, 2003. p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The temple was situated on the west bank of the [[Nile River]], in [[Nubia]], and was originally built around 30 BC during the early [[Roman empire|Roman]] era. While the temple was constructed in [[Augustus]]'s reign, it was never finished.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalie David, Discovering Ancient Egypt, Facts on File, 1993. p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;  The temple was a tribute to [[Mandulis]] (Merul), a Lower Nubian sun god.&lt;ref name="kamil"/&gt; It was constructed over an earlier sanctuary of Amenhotep II.&lt;ref&gt;David, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; 

The temple is 76 m long and 22 m wide in dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/590/hr1.htm |title=New Kalabsha at Aswan |date=June 13, 2002 |publisher=Al-Ahram Weekly |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040103010900/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/590/hr1.htm |archivedate=January 3, 2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the structure dates to the Roman period, it features many fine reliefs such as "a fine carving of Horus emerging from reeds on the inner curtain wall" of the temple.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Hobson, ''Exploring the World of the Pharaohs: A Complete Guide to Ancient Egypt'', Thames &amp; Hudson 1993 paperback, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; From Kalabsha's "sanctuary chambers, a staircase leads up to the roof of the temple" where one can see a splendid view of the temple itself and the sacred lake.&lt;ref&gt;Hobson, p.185&lt;/ref&gt;  

Several historical records were inscribed on the temple walls of Kalabsha such as "a long inscription carved by the Roman Governor Aurelius Besarion in AD 250, forbidding pigs in the temple" as well as an inscription of "the Nubian king Silko, carved during the 5th century and recording his victory over the [[Blemmyes]] and a picture of him dressed as a Roman soldier on horseback."&lt;ref&gt;Hobson, p.185&lt;/ref&gt; Silko was the Christian king of the Nubian kingdom of [[Nobatia]].&lt;ref&gt;Oakes, p.209&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Christianity]] was introduced to [[Egypt]], the temple was used as a church.&lt;ref name="kamil"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kamil, Jill |title=Upper Egypt and Nubia: The Antiquities from Amarna to Abu Simbel |publisher=Egyptian International Publishing Company |date=1996 |pages=141–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movement===
With help from [[Germany]], the temple of Kalabsha was relocated after the [[Aswan High Dam]] was built, to protect it from rising waters on [[Lake Nasser]]. The temple was moved to a [[New Kalabsha|site]], located just south of the Aswan High Dam.  The process of moving the temple took more than two years.&lt;ref name="kamil"/&gt; The temple of Kalabsha was the largest free-standing temple of Egyptian Nubia (after Abu Simbel) to be moved and erected at a new site.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Hobson, Exploring the World of the Pharaohs, Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd., 1997. p.177&lt;/ref&gt; Although the building was never completed, it "is regarded as one of the best examples of Egyptian architecture in Nubia."&lt;ref&gt;Oakes, p.208&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13857">'''Tonalli''' /to(ː)nalli/&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:International_Phonetic_Alphabet|title=Wiktionary:International Phonetic Alphabet - Wiktionary|website=en.wiktionary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also: [[Tonal (mythology)|Tonal]]) plays a multiplicity of roles; acting as a day sign, body part, and a [[symbol]] of the sun’s warmth. Ancient [[Nahuatl]] people believed that it was located in the hair and the [[fontanel]] area of one’s skull, and that the tonalli provided the “vigor and energy for growth and development”.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carrasco|first1=David|title=Religions of Mesoamerica|date=2014|publisher=Waveland Press|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; It often overlaps with the force of teyolía which was often considered both an animating force ([[soul]]) and the physical heart in various [[Mesoamerican]] [[cultures]].

== Etymology ==
The root “tona” acts as a verb to mean "to irradiate or make warm with sun”.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carrasco|first1=David|title=Religions of Mesoamerica|date=2014|publisher=Waveland Press|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythology ==
In the Ancient Nahuatl belief, the tonalli is bestowed upon a child in utero by the aged [[deities]] known as [[Ometecuhtli]] and [[Omecihuatl]], or the “Lord and Lady of Duality”.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furst|first1=Jill Leslie McKeever|title=The Natural History of the Soul in Ancient Mexico|date=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of tonalli is conducted through a process known as Fire Drilling.
[[File:Fire Drilling.JPG|thumb|Drilling with a stick on an upright base to make smoke and fire. Post classic Mixtec, Oaxaca]]
It is believed that the old deities, Ometecuhtli and Omecihuatl transferred tonalli to human fetuses by “simultaneously breath[ing] the tonalli into the child and ignit[ing] a fire in its chest”.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furst|first1=Jill Leslie McKeever|title=The Natural History of the Soul in Ancient Mexico|date=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Fire Drilling process involves an upright wooden piece being twirled rapidly on a flat base. It produces heat through friction, although this seemingly simple instrument requires considerable skill to make anything but smoke. The fire maker blows on an ignited spark to fan it into a vigorous flame, and the breathing (or blowing air) and friction in the chest animate an infant.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; The Franciscan friars connected this idea of Fire Drilling, namely, the conception of tonalli as breath, to [[Christianity]] as the infusion of breath into the body recalls the beginning of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], where God the Father breathes life into Adam.

== The human body ==
The Nahuatl people of Mesoamerica believed that the soul comprised three [[entities]]: Tonalli, Teyolía, and Ihíyotl, three souls in the body. Tonalli is located in fontanel area of the skull. Teyolía is located in the heart and Ihíyotl is in the liver. Each of these souls has its own functions and protective deities. But there are important differences. The Tonalli is the soul that enters and leaves the body. In [[Atla, Sierra de Puebla|Atla]] in the northern Sierra de Puebla, the inhabitants believe this is the soul that travels while you sleep at night, and then comes back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Montoya Briones|first1=Jose de Jesus|title=Atla: Etnografia de un Pueblo Nahuatl|date=1964|publisher=Mexico City: INAH|location=Mexico City|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the soul that leaves and comes back every time you sneeze, or whenever you yawn, or even when you are startled. The Nahua believed that it was not good to sneeze and keep talking, because it causes your tonalli to leave and once your Tonalli leaves, you have to wait for a period of time before it returns. At that moment, anything can enter your body. However, the soul of the heart (Teyolía) and the soul of the liver (Ihiíyotl) only leave your body when you die; those two souls will exit only at the exact moment of your death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Diana|last2=Constantino|first2=Roselyn|title=Holy Terrors: Latin American Women Perform.''Nahuatlismo: The Aztec Method''|date=2003|publisher=Duke University Press|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tonalli in the blood ===
Along with the heart, the ancient [[Mexica]] took blood from sacrificed prisoners and offered its fructifying force to the gods. On public and private ritual occasions, people drew blood from their ears, tongues, or calves, splattered it on pieces of native paper, and gave it to the spirits as tokens of thanks for benefits received or as requests for future favors. The gods could be coaxed or rewarded, less by the physical fluid itself than by the tonalli (life force) it carried and transferred to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furst|first1=Jill Leslie McKeever|title=The Natural History of the Soul in Ancient Mexico|date=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|pages=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among most modern Nahuatl speakers, the state of the life force may even be determined from the movement of blood in the body, whether this movement is experienced as a tic, a pulse, or a muscular movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furst|first1=Jill Leslie McKeever|title=The Natural History of the Soul in Ancient Mexico|date=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; When blood drains from its proper course, the person loses his/her life force, and, essentially, soul.

== Ritual ==
[[File:Warrior Grabbing Captive in Perceived Location of Tonalli.JPG|thumb|Warrior who has taken a captive by the hair. This is a symbolic representation of seizing the captive's tonalli. Early colonial Central Mexico.]]

=== War and human sacrifice ===
Tonalli was highly valued in society and sought after in warfare and ritual sacrifice. The hair that covered the head, especially the fontanel area, was a major receptacle of tonalli, and it was believed that hair prevented the tonalli from leaving the body. During times of war, when a warrior would take a prisoner captive, the warrior would often seize the captive by the hair (the fontanel area). It was believed that the fortitude and valor of a warrior resided, in part, in the hair, and there are many pictorial scenes showing Aztec warriors grabbing the hair of enemies. The hair of warriors captured in battle was kept by the captors in order to increase their tonalli. The severed heads of enemy warriors were a supreme prize for the city, which gained more tonalli through the ceremonial use of heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carrasco|first1=David|title=Religions of Mesoamerica|date=2014|publisher=Waveland Press|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tonalli embedded within skulls of enemy warriors and captives were also offered as gifts to the gods in the temple complexes. This was believed to be an offering to the gods in the form of a type of debt repayment.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Social practices ===
The [[essence]] of tonalli was a force that  could transcend the limits of the human body. Parts of the tonalli could reside outside the body in objects and animals. For example, tlacopatli beads were often left in the temple and represented a substitute for a child unable to go to the temple school, due to age restrictions. These beads served to contain the tonalli and do penitence for the underaged child.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=López|first1=Austin Alfredo|title=Relationship of the Essences. ''Tamoanchan, Tlalocan: Places of Mist''|date=1997|publisher=Niwot, CO: U of Colorado|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; This points to the belief of the physicality of the soul and the embodiment of the tonalli. Stones were also used as repositories of the soul in a different sense. As tonalli was considered to be an indication of destiny or fate, the possession of [[gemstones]] served as direct evidence of those with positive [[fate]]s despite low births and the auspicious destinies of members of the elite class.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;
[[File:Figure with 20 Day Signs.JPG|thumb|Figure with 20 day signs of ancient Mexica attached to parts of the body in place of the astrological signs assigned to them in Europe.]]

== Tonalli co-essences ==
The tonalli operated within a complex that involved the god of the birth date and the human. The soul of the individuality of a person, resided inside; but the god of the tonalli resided outside&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=López|first1=Austin Alfredo|title=Relationship of the Essences. ''Tamoanchan, Tlalocan: Places of Mist''|date=1997|publisher=Niwot, CO: U of Colorado|location=Colorado|pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The co-essence of tonalli in a human body is subject to the power of an external god/time that could lodge in a person’s body. The dynamics of this joint essence relationship made it necessary for humans to implore each god of birth dates for internal strength, health and good fortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=López|first1=Austin Alfredo|title=Relationship of the Essences. ''Tamoanchan, Tlalocan: Places of Mist''|date=1997|publisher=Niwot, CO: U of Colorado|location=Colorado|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Animating quality of tonalli ==
Tonalli, along with ''teyolia'' and ''ihiyotl'', was believed to direct the [[physiological]] process of the human body. It gave a person character, and was highly valued by the family and sought after in [[warfare]] and ritual [[sacrifice]]. It was believed that tonalli could be taken from a human body and either offered to the gods as a form of debt payment or acquired by the ritual person who touched the physical entity in which they resided.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The concept of tonalli was not only limited to human beings. It infiltrated animals, gods, plants, and objects used in rituals.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

=== Astrological signs ===
The tonalli also determines the sign under which a person is born and informs [[Luck|fortune]], character, and name. Tonalli conveyed [[astrological signs]] and names through birthdays, and in the [[Mexica]] [[divinatory]] system, a person’s birthday fell on one of the 260 name days in a special [[calendar]]. Individuals followed the path or code of conduct demanded by the tonalli and the day sign. This calendar was notable because it was used solely for divination and celebrating rituals in the deities’ honor. The calendrical name of a given person transmitted a character and fate to both men and women. A person born on the first day of the 260-day cycle, would be named One Crocodile and was given a positive character that would bring about authority, wealth, and fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furst|first1=Jill Leslie McKeever|title=The Natural History of the Soul in Ancient Mexico|date=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that inauspicious day signs could be ameliorated through rituals such as first baths, and life events.

== Free will ==
It was believed that individuals possess free will within the constraints imposed by their tonalli. One is born with either favorable or unfavorable tonalli and with a corresponding predetermined character. While this places certain constraints upon what one may accomplish, one freely chooses what to make of one's tonalli within these limits. Someone born with favorable tonalli may squander it through improper action; someone with unfavorable tonalli may neutralize its adverse effects through knowledge of the [[sacred]] calendar and careful selection of actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maffie|first1=James|title=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=iep.utm.edu/aztec/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Soul loss ==
As an animating force within both the human and [[Supernatural|spiritual]] world, retaining tonalli provides consciousness and personality. The concept of soul loss was inherent to the ancient Central Mexican understanding of [[aging]] and [[death]]. The loss of tonalli, in its various stages, is known by states in which the person suffers slowed, impaired, or complete loss of consciousness. As the understanding of tonalli is reliant upon conceptions of warmth, heat, and the sun, the absence of tonalli is felt as fluctuations in internal temperature. The inability to re-implant the life force leads to a decline in health and ultimately death. The modern Nahua and the Mexica have identified the tonalli’s departure as the cause of illnesses with the same general and observable symptoms as death and dying.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

as well as affiliated programs [[Narconon]], [[Criminon]] and [[World Institute of Scientology Enterprises|WISE]]. The church describes them as a way of learning to communicate effectively and to control situations. Some critics and former Scientologists claim the training routines have a strong [[hypnosis|hypnotic]] effect, causing [[hallucination]]s and an [[out-of-body experience]] known as ''exteriorization''.&lt;ref name="cooper"&gt;{{cite book|

Training routines are used in the Narconon program to overcome influences that Scientology theory considers to be relevant to drug use and recidivism. The church claims that they have achieved a success rate of about 80 percent, but critics say that rates in reality are lower than reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cowan |first1=Douglas E. |last2=Bromley |first2=David G. |title=Cults and New Religions: A Brief History |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2015 |isbn=9781118723494 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lower TRs==
These TRs, numbered 0–4, emphasize Scientology's "cycle of communication".

===OT TR-0: Operating Thetan Confronting===
Two students sit facing each other with their eyes closed. The routine ends when both students can sit for an extended period without movement or drowsiness.&lt;ref name="atack"&gt;{{cite book|
first=Jon|last=Atack|
title=A Piece of Blue Sky: Scientology, Dianetics &amp; L. Ron Hubbard Exposed|

people=Egan, Simon|
title=The Beginner's Guide to L. Ron Hubbard|
publisher=Channel Four|date=2006-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TR-0: Confronting===
In the first exercise, a student and coach face each other with eyes open. The routine ends when the student can confront the coach for at least two hours without movement, excessive blinking, or loss of attention. The second exercise is the same, except that the coach tries to distract the student both verbally and physically.&lt;ref name="cooper"/&gt;&lt;ref name="atack"/&gt;&lt;ref name="beginnersguide"/&gt;

===TR-0: Bullbait===
The coach says things to the student to try to provoke a reaction. The coach may say or do anything except leaving the chair. The student must be able to sit and watch the coach without getting distracted or reacting in any way. If he does, the coach flunks him and the TR starts over. The coach will attempt to find the student's "buttons" (things that cause a reaction). The stated purpose of this TR is to train the student to ''be there'' in a communication situation without getting distracted.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, ''Communication'' booklet, from ''[[The Scientology Handbook]]'', New Era Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

===TR-1: Dear Alice===
The student reads several lines from ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'' to the coach as if saying them himself. The coach either acknowledges the line or flunks the student according to whether the line is communicated clearly.&lt;ref name="cooper"/&gt;&lt;ref name="atack"/&gt;

===TR-2: Acknowledgements===
The coach reads the student lines from ''Alice in Wonderland'' in a reversal of TR-1. The student must acknowledge each line so as to clearly end the cycle of communication.&lt;ref name="cooper"/&gt;&lt;ref name="atack"/&gt;

===TR-3: Duplicative question===
The student repeatedly asks the coach, "Do birds fly?" or "Do fish swim?" If the coach answers the question, the student acknowledges the answer. If the coach says anything else, the student advises the coach that he will repeat the question, and then does so.&lt;ref name="cooper"/&gt;&lt;ref name="atack"/&gt;&lt;ref name="beginnersguide"/&gt;

===TR-4: Originations===
The student repeatedly asks the coach a question as in TR-3. If the coach originates a statement unrelated to the question, the student handles the origination as needed and then continues the routine.&lt;ref name="atack"/&gt;

==Upper Indoc TRs==
These TRs, numbered 6–9,&lt;!--TR5 was discontinued--&gt; emphasize the student's ability to control people and situations.

===TR-6: Body Control===
The student moves the coach's body around a room. In the first half of the routine the student "steers" the coach by silent actions. In the second half, the student uses verbal commands such as "Walk over to that wall." Each successful verbal command must be acknowledged.&lt;ref name="upperindoc"&gt;HCO Bulletin 7 May 1968: Upper Indoc TRs&lt;/ref&gt;

===TR-7: High School Indoc===
This routine is similar to TR-6, except that the coach resists the student verbally and physically. The student may use physical contact to enforce a command. The routine continues until the student can fully control the coach despite attempts to stop control.&lt;ref name="upperindoc"/&gt;

===TR-8: Tone 40 on an Object===
The student repeatedly commands an ashtray to stand up and sit down, acknowledging each action. Although the student holds the ashtray throughout the exercise, the goal is to cause the ashtray to move purely by [[Emotional tone scale|tone 40]] intention.&lt;ref name="networkfirst"/&gt;

===TR-9: Tone 40 on a Person===
As in TR-6, the student moves the coach around a room with verbal commands. The coach resists, and the student must use a combination of smooth physical control and unspoken intention to make the coach obey. The routine continues until the student can maintain exact intention despite resistance.&lt;ref name="upperindoc"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2327">The '''Unified Buddhist Sangha of Vietnam''' (UBCV) is a Buddhist organization in [[Vietnam]]. The Unified Buddhist Sangha of Vietnam was founded in 1964 in order to unify 11 of the 14 different sects of [[Buddhism in Vietnam|Vietnamese Buddhism]] which were present in the country at the time. The unification also came in response to a government that was increasingly being seen as hostile to Buddhists during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="Abuza2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Abuza, Zachary |title=Renovating Politics in Contemporary Vietnam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KXu4dQg3dXUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA191&amp;dq=may+1966+buddhist&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3vDmTPObNcSt8AaohoDEDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=may%201966%20buddhist&amp;f=false|year=2001|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|isbn=978-1-55587-961-7|pages=191–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UBSV's patriarch [[Thích Huyền Quang]], and his deputy [[Thích Quảng Độ]] have been under house arrest due to their  opposition to strict government control of religion, which was established after the communists won the war in 1975. (Times)

In 1981, six years after the communist victory, the new government consolidated all Buddhist organizations under the umbrella group [[Buddhist Sangha of Vietnam]] and placed it under government control. The Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam and all other non-sanctioned organizations were banned within Vietnam. It continues to operate in exile outside Vietnam.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28103">“'''Want of Matter'''” (in [[Hebrew]]: דלות החומר; Dalut HaHahomer) is an Israeli style of art that existed in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.  Characteristics of this style include the use of “meager” creative materials, artistic sloppiness, and criticism of the social reality and the myth of Israel society.  Among the artists identified with “Want of  Matter” are [[Raffi Lavie]], [[Yair Garbuz]], [[Michal Na'aman]], [[Tamar Getter]] and [[Nahum Tevet]].

==History==
[[File:Lavie, Raffi-Untitled, 1977 cropped~B92 1599.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|''Untitled'' (1977) by [[Raffi Lavie]]. Acrylic, colored pencil, and collage on plywood, 122 x 83 cm. The Israel Museum, Jerusalem]]
The “Want of Matter” style grew out of a historical-retrospective view of Israeli art. The name  originated in an exhibition called  “The Want of Matter: A Quality in Israeli Art” curated by [[Sara Breitberg-Semel]], which took place in March 1986 at the [[Tel Aviv Museum]]. Breitberg-Semel, then curator of Israeli art at the museum, mounted this exhibition as a summation and continuation of the exhibitions “Artist,Society,Artist” and “Different Spirit” (1981).  It was an attempt to distinguish between local art and the style of international art of this period by means of a sociological and esthetic survey of Israeli artists and their attitude toward European artistic traditions. Breitberg-Semel saw the roots of the style in [[Pop Art]], [[Arte Povera]] and [[Conceptual art]].  Another  highly significant element in Breitberg-Semel’s view was the concept “anesthetic,”  the roots of which could be found in the Jewish Talmudic tradition, which puts the text in the center of culture.

Breitberg-Semel’s attempt to trace  the development of “Want of Matter” gave rise to a clear historical line, beginning with the painting of the “New Horizons” group.  The members of this group developed  an abstract  style that came to be known as “lyrical abstract” within the framework of which the painters created an abstraction of form  influenced by Expressionism.  The artists who followed in the footsteps of these artists, [[Aviva Uri]] and [[Arie Aroch]], used the artists of the “Want of Matter” group as their esthetic model with regard to their relationship to the materials they used in their paintings, to their ascetic materialism, and to their combined use of the abstract and veiled iconography.

The first generation of artists in the “Want of Matter” group in the 1960s were partners in a number of avant-garde artistic experiments, the most important of which were the activities of a group called “[[10+]]” This group, which never had a unified political or esthetic direction, united around the influences of international art and the use of new artistic materials such as photographs to create two dimensional art, artistic “activity,” and even the use of the pioneering video art films in Israel.  
 
Visually, "The Want of Matter" style distilled its characteristics from these diverse influences, preferring painting to three-dimensional sculpture. Overall, this style can be summed up as focusing on the use of low-cost materials identified with the establishment of Israel, such as plywood, cardboard, collages,  photographs arranged as collages, industrial paints, and writing and scribbling within the work. The use of these materials reflected the “Ars Poetica” approach and  gave an intentionally humble appearance to the surface of the paintings, a look which was meant to add a dimension of criticism by the artists toward Israeli society.

==“But the word is very near you”==
The caption on the exhibit “Want of Matter” included a quotation from the [[Book of Deuteronomy]] (30:14) -- “But the word is very near you.”  This quotation captured the point of view of this group of artists, according to Breitberg-Semel, a secular, modernist point of view mixed with Jewish symbolism.  The works were pointedly free of religious symbolism, as Breitberg –Semel notes, defining the works of Raffi Lavie: “There is no Western Wall, no Old City Wall, no Augusta Victoria,” while on the other hand, the works were created “against the background of a religion whose esthetic and non-materialist point of view were its symbols.”  The development of this idea can be seen the article “Agrippas versus Nimrod” (1988), in which Breitberg-Semel expressed the desire to inculcate into their art a secular, pluralistic point of view influenced by Jewish tradition.  
The identification of Judaism with abstract art had already happened in the past, when it was based on the iconoclastic Orthodox tradition, in the spirit of the prohibition against  the making of statues or masks that appears in The Ten Commandments. In 1976 this idea appeared in the Hebrew translation of an article by the American art critic Robert Pincus Witten, published in the first issue of the art journal Musag (in Hebrew: "Concept").&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Ofrat, “[http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/art/yahadut/haisraelit.htm Israeli Art and the Jewish Tradition].” [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; The typical expression of this point of view on the Israeli artist can be found in an article on the work of [[Arie Aroch]], who is considered the model for Raffi Lavie and his generation.  The concept of “anestheticism” fueled the writings of the young artists, as an image within the works themselves, writing which relates to the relationship between the Jewish Talmudic tradition and a preoccupation with borders and national symbols as an expression of critical Zionist Judaism. In Breitberg-Semel’s writing, these artists are portrayed as the “disinherited sabra,” cut off from Jewish tradition to the same degree that they were cut off from the European Christian tradition.

In the article by Breitberg-Semel that accompanied the “Want of Matter” exhibition, the artist [[Raffi Lavie]] was presented as the typical representative of the style.  Lavie’s works put forth the idea of “The City of Tel Aviv” as a combination of European-Zionist  modernism and neglect and abandonment.  As the years passed, the image of Lavie himself, dressed sloppily in shorts, with rubber flip-flops on his feet, arrogant, “native,” and “prickly,” became the typical expression of this aesthetic school.&lt;ref&gt;The photography of Michal Heiman, for example, documented Raffi’s wanderings around the city and presented him at his most typical.  Another artist, [[Doron Rabina]], described the earthy image of this artist: “End of a summer day at [[HaMidrasha – Faculty of the Arts|HaMidrasha]].  Raffi walks into the cafeteria, sweat streaming down his face, his shirt glued to his back with sweat.  I couldn’t help thinking, “This is the Maestro.”  See: Doron Rabina, “Drawing Proper,” Hamidrasha, 2 (1999): 127.  [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Lavie’s works, which included childish scribbles, collages of magazine illustrations, advertisements of Tel Aviv cultural events,  stickers with words “head” or “geraniums” written on them, and above all the plywood sheet, sawed to a consistent size of 120&amp;nbsp;cm., and painted in whitewash,&lt;ref&gt;This format became a permanent part of the scene primarily toward the end of the 1980s.&lt;/ref&gt; became the most recognizable symbols of  “Want of Matter.”

In addition to developing a comprehensive visual style, Lavie encouraged discussion of his works on a formalist level. In interviews, Lavie refused to relate to any interpretations of his work other than “the language of art” in its modernist aesthetic incarnation.  In spite of clearly iconographic images in his works, Lavie insisted that these images were of no historical significance.  Furthermore, the use of collage and techniques that lacked an artistic “halo” were intended, according to both Lavie and Breitberg-Semel, to erode and undermine the significance of visual images.&lt;ref&gt;Sarit Shapira, “This isn’t a Cactus, it’s a Geranium,” (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 2003) 18-20.  [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Lavie’s students, however, continued to cultivate a preoccupation with form, as well as a continuing relationship with the modernist  tradition, both of which caused problems for Lavie’s didactic separation of “form” and “content.”&lt;ref&gt;Michal Na’aman, “Please Don’t Read What’s Written Here,” Hamidrasha 2 (1999): 104.  [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yair Garbuz]] formed a relationship with Lavie when he was just a young boy. For a number of years Lavie was Garbuz’s private teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Ruti Direktor, “A Little Bit Guru, a Little Bit Fake,” Hadashot [News] (April 4, 1986). [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Later Garbuz went  from being a student to being a senior instructor at the “HaMidrasha” (School of Art). His work from these years created a link between the symbols that connected  the ethos of the Zionist undertaking, as reflected in popular culture, with social and political criticism.

His two-dimensional works from the 1970s  and 1980s include a mix of newspaper photos, documentary photographs, texts and other objects, combined in compositions that have no clear hierarchy. Some of his works, such as "The Evenings (Arabs) Pass By Quietly" (1979) and "The Arab Village in Israel Very Much Resembles the Life of our Forefathers in Ancient Times" (1981), criticized stereotypes rampant in Israeli society.  For the cover he designed for No. 11 of the journal Siman Kriah [Exclamation Point] (May 1980), Garbuz inserted a photograph from the newspaper Davar  of a self-portrait of Vincent Van Gogh captioned “Van Gogh in Tel Aviv.”  Under the reproduction, Garbuz added a sort of poem, complete with nikud [vocalization] and illustrations, discussing the significance of labor. This work was one of a number of his works in which he presented his artistic activity as an artist in Israel - which he perceived as a distant and outlying place — as a kind of anarchism. Along with these two-dimensional works, Garbuz produced art videos, installations, and other forms of artistic activities in this spirit.

[[Henry Schlesnyak]], an American-born artist, juxtaposed collage with American Pop Art, and American symbolism—the most significant of which is his portrait of Abraham Lincoln – with scenes from Israeli art as reflected in various newspaper articles. Through this juxtaposition, Schlesnyak pointed out  the moral aspect  of artistic activity and his view of the place of Israeli art and the Israeli artist within it.  Another layer of his work was composed of the “Tel Aviv” aesthetic, which played the role of critic in his works. For example reproductions of famous works of art were painted over in industrial shellac to give them the feeling of paintings by the European “Old Masters.”  The “Hebrew translation” of this feeling included the devaluing of the paintings by “flashes of stains on the surface of the paintings, dirt, ‘want of matter’, thereby bringing it down to the level of what is appropriate to the experience of being here. “&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Breitberg-Semel,  “Want of Matter as a Sign of Excellence in Israeli Art,” Hamidrasha 2 (1999):267.  [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1980 collage, Schlesnyak glued onto plywood a newspaper picture of the writer Irving Stone, author of popular novels about artists, positioned at the front of the Tel Aviv Museum.  Next to him stands Marc Scheps, Director of the museum, with his head enclosed in a circle.  Above this Schlesnyak glued an article by Adam Baruch describing an exhibition of the works of Ya’acov Dorchin, a friend of Schlesnyak, with a caption composed of letterset printing.

The works of [[Michal Na'aman]] from the 1970s used photography to create collages. In these works Naaman put together various expressions emphasizing the limitations of the language of description and of vision, as well as the possibilities of imagination and the difference in visual expression. The practice of combining conflicting axioms indicated the failure or distortion of the language of description.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Breitberg-Semel, “Michal Na’aman: What Has She Done Here?” Studio 40(January 1993): 48. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Against the background of the visual dimension that reflected the aesthetic principles of “Want of Matter,” there appeared various representations and texts written in letterset printing&lt;ref&gt;Kits of ready-made stick-on letters intended for various graphic purposes.&lt;/ref&gt; or in handwriting that reflected the semiotic bankruptcy of the representation of images.  Examples of this can be found in works such as “The Fish is the End of the Bird” (1977) and “The Gospel According to the Bird” (1977) in which Na'aman joined reproduced images of a fish and a bird into a kind of hybrid monster. In “Vanya (Vajezath)" (1975) a conflict is created between the textual contents  of the work with the visual contents, along with an emphasis on sexual motifs.

In spite of her feminist connections, [[Yehudit Levin]]’s works are more personal and less intellectual than the works of most of Raffi Lavie’s students.  At the end of the 1970s and early 1980s, Levin created abstract compositions constructed from sawed and painted plywood, sometimes combined with photographs, then leaned against a wall. The names of  these works, such as “Bicycle” (1977) and  “Princess in a Palace” (1978) hint at a domestic connection.  Even though these works appear in space as three-dimensional, their main interest  lies in their complex relationship with the spaces seen within them. The “drawing” breaks out of the framework  of the platform and flows over into space.

A similar approach, without the psychological baggage, can be seen in the works of the sculptor [[Nahum Tevet]]. In his minimalist works Tevet  shows an ambivalent relationship with three-dimensional space.  In a late interview Tevet defined the motivation behind these works as a reaction to his studying  art with Lavie. “It might be that to a certain extent this is a reaction to the place where I studied painting, in Raffi Lavie’s studio.  He suggested  painting in which the main interest was built around personal tensions and relationships, and I asked about the relationship between the painting as an object  and the environment – the world.”&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Breitberg-Semel, “How Much Happiness Can Grow Out of This Reduction: a Conversation with Nahum Tevet,”  Studio 91 (March 1998): 24.  [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

His works from that period dealt with the division and organization of work surfaces. In an installation from 1973-1974, Tevet placed white-painted plywood boards on top of chairs. The work showed the influence of the aesthetic  principles of minimalist art and emphasized the temporariness of the expression of an artistic experience.  In another work, “Beds” (1974), Tevet displayed rectangular, white-painted plywood boards, with legs attached to them that turned the two-dimensional “painting” into a work of sculpture.  The interpretation of this work that grew up over the years required that, in addition to the formalistic aspect of the work, the biographical background of Tevet, as a former kibbutz member, needed to be taken into account. Relating to plywood as a “painting” and to its placement as a work of art&lt;ref&gt;This relationship is clearer in Tevet’s later installations, such as his series of works called “Painting Lessons.”&lt;/ref&gt; reflected the ambivalent relationship of Tevet to the surface of the painting.

==Hamidrasha School of Art==
{{Main|HaMidrasha – Faculty of the Arts}}
In 1966 Lavie joined the staff of Hamidrasha Art Teachers College in [[Ramat Hasharo]]n, known as “[[HaMidrasha – Faculty of the Arts|Hamidrasha School of Art]].” Around this educational institution a group of Lavie’s students, such as Michal Na’aman, Yehudit Levin, etc., grew up and began teaching there. As a group these artists formed a clear hegemony over art in the period following “New Horizons.”

The teaching method at Hamidrasha centered around the discussion  of art and modern aesthetics, demoting the more traditional  method of teaching art, which focused on drawing lessons opposite a model, to second place. The rational that gave rise to this pedagogical method sprung from the assumption that  in a world in which art was expressed in endless new ways of execution, there was no way to learn all the new artistic techniques. Therefore the school tried to educate its art students first and foremost as “artists” and assumed that they would develop their technical skills independently, in accordance with their individual needs.

A great many academic areas at Hamidrasha were subordinated to this pedagogic approach.  “I reject all academic degrees and any attempt at the academization of the study of art in any form,” Lavie stated in a dialogue between him and Pinchas Cohen Gan.  “I don’t think it’s possible to give out grades, and I don’t believe it’s possible to judge art.”&lt;ref&gt;Training Young Artists,” Muzot [Muses] 5/6 (February 1989): 20. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;  As an answer to the inability to make judgments  about art, which Lavie pointed out, the institution developed  “public” criticism.  Within the framework of this criticism, which was often dubbed “The Ceremony,” teachers were invited to a public discussion of their students’ work.

The “Criticism” demonstrated the centrality of the personality and the status of the teachers on the framework of the studies.  Tsibi Geva, who was a student in the Hamidrasha and later became a teacher there, described Lavie as a central figure in art, through which the world of art was perceived…”We received everything through Raffi Lavie.  The man controlled the flow; and he was, you could say, the authority that legislated and the authority that carried things out. He was the window onto the world; our education was acquired through the prism of his eyes.”&lt;ref&gt;Roee Rosen, “The Birth of Oil and the Life of the Machine,”  Studio 94 (June–July 1998):43.  [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the its teaching, Hamidrasha provided  favored graduates with entrance to the “Hamidrasha School.” Within this framework, Lavie encouraged exhibitions of the school’s graduates.  In May 1974 Lavie distributed a “pamphlet” in which he presented works by students who were close to him, such as Naaman, Tevet, David Ginton, etc., and aroused a storm of negative criticism.  The Ross Gallery in north Tel Aviv also consistently displayed the artists of the new School.&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Efrat, Dorit Lavita, and  Benjamin Tammuz, ''The Story of Israeli Art'' (Tel Aviv : Masada Publishers,  1980), 305-310. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Later the artists of the School began displaying their works in the [[Julie M Gallery]] and the [[Givon Gallery]] in the center of Tel Aviv as well.

==The Struggle to Be the Center: Tel Aviv and Jerusalem==
The exhibition “Want of Matter” presented the group of “Tel Aviv Artists” as the center of contemporary Israel art. In addition to representing the Socialistic-Pioneering spirit, these artists represented the secular character of Tel Aviv, under the banner of “the aesthetic, non-materialistic aspect of the Jewish tradition.”&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Breitberg-Semel,  “Want of Matter as a Sign of Excellence in Israeli Art,” ''Hamidrasha'' 2 (1999):258.  [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; The group strengthened its sense of its own identity by forming a network of personal and professional connections among themselves.  In the article, “About Raffi: Color patch, Crown. Catchup, Love” (1999), Yair Garbuz, Lavie’s student, presented his teacher in terms of his originality.  “It’s not that we suddenly became the center of art… we’ve remained the provinces [...] In a certainly respect, Raffi painted and taught like a pioneer. In order for something to flourish here, it had to be carefully disguised. You couldn’t  just say that maybe modernism was developing.”&lt;ref&gt;Yair Garbuz, “About Raffi: Color patch, Crown, Catchup, Love,”  ''Hamidrasha'' 2 (1999):37. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; The period before the existence of “Want of Matter” was perceived by this group of artists as a mixture of immature explorations of abstract modernism with overtones of the romantic aesthetic, overtones which Lavie and his followers viewed as a danger  capable of reducing art to something  lacking in the characteristics and criteria of aesthetic judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Yair Garbuz, “About Raffi: Color patch, Crown. Catchup, Love,”  ''Hamidrasha'' 2 (1999):39-43. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition that Want of Matter created for itself attempted to follow what was happening in American and European conceptual Art. However, in contrast to them, this conceptualism was seen primarily within the framework of painting. [[Ariella Azoulay]] stated, in an analysis of the Israeli artistic scene, that this choice of painting as the dominant medium in Israeli art, was not a natural process, but rather was carefully directed by certain elements such as Sarah Breitberg-Semel, the museum and the art establishment, as well as the artists themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Ariella Azoulay, “The Place of Art,” ''Studio'' 4 (January 1993):9-11. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, the choice of works by Breitberg-Semel  for the exhibition honored works from the exhibit that were created by the same group of artists she had chosen to exhibit, but they were done using techniques other than painting.&lt;ref&gt;Exceptions were the installation of  Nahum Tevet, and the objects of Pinchas Cohen Gan, Tsibi Geva, and Michael Druks, whose work, in spite of its “three-dimensionality,” included a clear affinity to painting.&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of this are the video art films of Lavie and Garbuz, the mixed media works and installations of Michal Naaman, etc. Outside the museum establishment, avant-garde art such as mixed media works, installations and other conceptual projects that couldn’t be displayed at museums continued to be produced. Criticism of this kind was also heard during the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;Itamar Levy, “There are No Child Prodigies, ''Yediot Ahronoth'' (March 28, 1986). [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Only in the 1980s, Azoulay contends, with the weakening of the status of the central museums, did these trends, that were suppressed until then, rise to the top of Israeli art.

The attempt to present “Want of Matter” as the dominant hegemony in Israeli art, as the “center” of Israeli art, pushed many Israeli artists to the periphery of this center.  Gideon Efrat, an art critic and curator set up a comparison between “Tel Aviv-ness” and the “School of New Jerusalem,” a term based on the metaphysical Christian interpretation of the city of Jerusalem.  The main difference between the definition of this group and that of the “Tel Aviv School,” according to Breitberg-Semel, lay in the difference between their definitions of the status of art in relation to public space.  While the “Tel Aviv” group strove to focus their art within the traditional definitions, the “Jerusalem artists” sought to draw an “eruv” – a ritual shared enclosed area – around art and life.  Artists such as [[Gabi Klasmer]] and [[Sharon Keren]] (“Gabi and Sharon”) appeared in a series of performances of a political nature in Jerusalem public places; [[Avital Geva]] and [[Moshe Gershuni]] met with [[Yitzhak Ben-Aharon]], Secretary General of the Histadrut, as an “activity”&lt;ref&gt;”Peulah” (activity) was the previous Hebrew term for “installation.”&lt;/ref&gt; of “art.”&lt;ref&gt;Ariella Azoulay, ''Exercising Art: a Critique of the Economics of Museum Curation'' (Tel Aviv: Kibbutz Hameuhad, 1999), 163-164. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the “Tel Avivans,” led by Lavie, developed a purist concept of art.  In his view, art should focus on the physical boundaries of the plastic arts – on color, line, stain, and their relationship to the format of the work.  In a 1973 interview, Lavie spoke about politics in art: “If an artist wants to say political things through his work, it’s his privilege. But he should know exactly what the work is called: a “placard.”&lt;ref&gt;In: Ariella Azoulay,  ''Exercising Art: a Critique of the Economics of Museum Curation'' (Tel Aviv: Kibbutz Hameuhad, 1999), 136. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the exhibition “Eyes of the Nation,” held at  the Tel Aviv Museum in 1998, Ellen Ginton  viewed the art of the period as a reaction to the political and social problems in Israeli society.  This perspective undermined the traditional dichotomy  that Efrat and Breitberg-Semel presented. Ginton held that this art was a response to the political and social crisis after the Yom Kippur War which continued into the 1980s. Eventually, the artists returned to more traditional artistic activity.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Ginton, ''The Eyes of the Nation. Visual Art in a Country without Boundaries'' (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum, 1998)  [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Sabra and the Exile==
Another kind of criticism, political in nature, was directed against “Want of Matter” and the wide acceptance of Breitberg-Semel’s thesis. In 1991 Breitberg-Semel’s article “Want of Matter” was re-published, and she wrote a new introduction for it.  In this new introduction she attempted to clarify the critical dimension of her thesis, declaring that “the generation that grew up after 1967 encountered a new ethos – the rule by occupation, with all its moral and material implications, and with all its enormous social changes, of which the bourgeois existence as the leading way of life, is only one aspect. This generation of artists, which would have difficulty freeing itself of the cultural images the exhibition bequeathed to them with regard to the dispute over local culture, would also have difficulty waving the flag of “want of matter” as the achievement that belongs to it and characterizes it. But perhaps, one day, things would change.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Breitberg-Semel, “Want of Matter,” in: Haim Losky, ed. ''The City, Utopia, and Israeli Society'' (Tel Aviv: 1989), 108. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; The division in “want of matter” between “ethos” and “aethestics”  is presented in the introduction as a fleeting moment, since the use that was made of it later cut it off from the social and political field in which it originated. 
 
In 1993, an article by [[Sarah Chinski]] entitled “Silence of the Fish: The Local versus the Universal in the Israeli Discourse on Art” was published in the journal Theory and Criticism. The article criticized the narcissistic banner-waving of the self-pitying Tel  Avivan.” Against this image of self-pity, Chinski juxtaposed the political reality that gave birth to the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]. “The ‘dispossessed sabra’,” writes Chinski, “has been so focused on self-pity for his imaginary losses, he hasn’t noticed that in his name massive expulsions of huge numbers of people have taken place throughout all the glorious history of the Palmach  and the youth movement he has created in his heart.“&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Chinski, “Silence of the Fish: The Local versus the Universal in the Israeli Discourse on Art,” ''Theory and Criticism'' 4 (Autumn 1993):105-122. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Zoroastrianism]] in [[Azerbaijan]]''' goes back to the first millennium BC [[Zoroaster#Date|or earlier]] and was the predominant religion of [[Greater Iran]] before [[Islamization of Iran|the conversion]] to [[Islam]]. The name Azerbaijan is [[Persian language|Persian]] and means "protect(or) of Fire",&lt;ref&gt;Persian Lexicons:Dehkhoda, Moin, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; which is said to have a direct link with Zoroastrianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWJdlJjGx5MC|title=Zoroastrianism|last=Hartz|first=Paula|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438117805|page=102|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the religion, culture and traditions of Zoroastrianism remains highly respected in Azerbaijan, and the new year [[Nowruz]] continues to be the main holiday in the country. Zoroastrianism has left a deep mark in the history of Azerbaijan. Traces of the religion are still visible in [[Suraxanı raion|Surakhany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ateshgahs and Zoroastrians in Azerbaijan: Good thoughts, good words, good deeds|url=http://thebriefnote.com/2012/04/06/ateshgahs-and-zoroastrians-good-thoughts-good-words-good-deeds-baku-atesgah-azerbaijan/|accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Khinalyg]], and [[Yanar Dag]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

== History ==
One of the world`s oldest religions Zoroastrianism was also practiced in the territory of [[Azerbaijan]] in ancient times. [[Zoroastrianism]], sharing its name with its founder Iranian prophet Zoroaster (also known as Zarathustra), was the first [[monotheistic]] belief in the world and the official religion in Persia from 600 BCE to 650 CE.

Zoroastrians believed that a god called Ahura Mazda (Wise Lord) created the universe.  Sacred book of Zoroastrianism [[Avesta]] consists of two main sections: the oldest section contains the [[Gathas]] including seventeen hymns and the younger Avesta containing commentaries to the older one. It also includes [[myths]], stories and details of ritual observances. Fire is the most important symbol of the Zoroastrianism. Zoroastrians worshipped fire, because they believed that the fire represented the [[Holy Spirit]] of [[Ahura Mazda]].

About the date of birth of Zoroaster, historians mostly agree upon the dates of 660-583 BC with birth place being the lands of Azerbaijan. According to the local legends, Zoroaster was born in [[Caucasian Albanian|Caucasian Albania]]. But this idea is also found in other regions under influence of Zoroastrianism.&lt;ref&gt;https://sacredsites.com/middle_east/iran/zoroastrian_sacred_sites.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 550 BC Cyrus II, also known as Cyrus the Great, integrated the area of southern Azerbaijan into the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]]. During his reign Zoroastrianism was the dominant religion in the Empire. But he did not made any attempt to impose Zoroastrianism on the people of his subject territories.

During the rule of King Darius I, Zoroastrianism was the official religion of the Achaemenid Empire including Azerbaijan. Darius I also allowed moderate religious freedom in the satrapies (provinces).

Alexander the Great, King of Macedonia defeated [[Darius III]] in 331BCE. During this period Zoroastrianism began to weaken. Many priests were killed. Many sacred texts of Zoroastrianism were destroyed and lost forever.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/zoroastrian/worship/worship.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient states in the territory of Azerbaijan ===

==== Atropatena ====
Around 328 BC, Satrap of Media and Atropates formed an independent entity [[Atropatena]]. The state was situated in [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azarbaijan]] (historic Azerbaijan, i.e. ''Iranian Azerbaijan''), and also included a minor part of the present-day [[Republic of Azerbaijan]] (i.e. [[Arran (Caucasus)|Arran]]). As Zoroastrianism was the dominant religion in Atropatena, the capital of Atropatena, Ganzak, became a religious center. Zoroastrian temples were fueled by region`s rich oil deposits. In accordance with many historian sources, the name “Azerbaijan” is attributed to the Persian word for fire “Azar”, because of the popularity of Zoroastrianism in the region.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.az/books?id=bNsEBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=zoroastrianism+in+azerbaijan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_A55ZgE3JC&amp;sig=5-vvQkh7h57PA4Nf0ZrgPdG20fI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=zoroastrianism%20in%20azerbaijan&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Albania ====
In the IV century BC, in the north of present-day Azerbaijan Republic and partially southern [[Dagestan]], the entity of [[Caucasian Albania]] was established. Under Achaemenid, Parthian and especially Sassanid influence, Zoroastrianism was the dominant religion in the country.

[[Armenians]] historian [[Movses Kaghankatvatsi]] investigating the political line of [[Yazdegerd II]] (438-457) in Albania noted that “During the reign of sinner Yezdeghird, devil instigated him to destroy [[Christian]] religion”, so he ordered to reject Christianity in Albania and obey fire-worshippers-magicians (Zoroastrianism)."

As a result of excavations on the territory of Caucasian Albania many cultural finds, indicating the spreading of Zoroastrianism in the region were found.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.az/books?id=a9SPAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=zoroastrianism+azerbaijan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kgotg4ZxxX&amp;sig=K6pIBafcgH1alGj58wXWiV-UZXs&amp;hl=az&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwii5e_uyOXWAhWMJlAKHcLTDpE4FBDoAQghMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=zoroastrianism%20azerbaijan&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

== Zoroastrian architecture ==
Zoroastrianism`s traces can be found in Baku, [[Shamakha]], [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]], [[Mingechaur]], Talysh-Mugan areas.The [[Absheron Peninsula]] and [[Baku]] were centers of Zoroastrianism in ancient times. The Absheron Peninsula was rich in natural undamped torches of natural gas on the shore and in the sea. In the Sassanid era (3rd-7th centuries), when Zoroastrianism had risen to the level of state religion, Baku entered a new stage in its urban development. The most popular architectural monument of the city the Maiden’s Tower and ancient city walls and towers that are being preserved as historian monuments, belong to that time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/temples/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ateshgah–Baku === 
Ateshgah, one of the popular ancient monuments in Azerbaijan belonging to the seventeenth century CE is located in village of Surakhani, fifteen km west of the capital Baku on the coast of the [[Caspian Sea]]. In some sources this monument is called the fire worshippers' temple. The Ateshgah monument traces its origins to Zoroastrianism, which was dominant religion in ancient Azerbaijan. Ateshgah temple has been designated as world heritage site by [[UNESCO]]. The temple is not used since 1883 CE.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Guru_Nanak_in_Azerbaijan&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Atashgah Fire Temple.jpg|thumb|Atashgah Fire Temple]]

=== Khinalig ===

== Zoroastrianism after Islam arrived in Azerbaijan ==
In the 7th century the [[Arabians]] conquered Persia including Azerbaijan. During this period many Zoroastrian temples, libraries were destroyed and burned. Many Zoroastrian texts were lost. Zoroastrians were treated as [[dhimmis]] ([[People of the Book]]) as well as [[Jews]] and [[Christians]] by the [[Arabians]]. It means that they could retain their religious practices, but must pay extra taxes. Despite all the difficulties Iranians did convert and Zoroastrianism became a minority religion in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.az/books?id=a9SPAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=zoroastrianism+azerbaijan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kgotg4ZxxX&amp;sig=K6pIBafcgH1alGj58wXWiV-UZXs&amp;hl=az&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwii5e_uyOXWAhWMJlAKHcLTDpE4FBDoAQghMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=zoroastrianism%20azerbaijan&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

== Novruz ==
The six [[Gahambar]] festivals and Novruz are the seven important Zoroastrian festivals. All Novruz traditions are rooted in Zoroastrianism. These festivals occur at the spring equinox. According to [[Mary Boyce]] "It seems a reasonable surmise that Novruz, the holiest of them all, with deep doctrinal significance, was founded by Zoroaster himself".

The Persian historian [[Gardizi]], in his work titled Zayn al-Akhbār, mentions Novruz among Zoroastrians festivals and points out that Zoroaster highly emphasized the celebration of [[Novruz]].

Usually preparation begins a month prior to Novruz holiday in Azerbaijan. People celebrate the last four Tuesdays prior to the festival being the day of one of the four elements - water, fire, earth and wind. As a tribute to Zoroastrianism beliefs, every [[Tuesday]] during four weeks children jump over small [[bonfires]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.visions.az/en/news/74/4c515f56/&lt;/ref&gt;
