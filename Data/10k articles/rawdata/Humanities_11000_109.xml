'''100.000 of niets'''  (''100,000 or nothing'') was a [[Flanders|Flemish]] TV quiz, broadcast on the Flemish [[public service]] TV station N.I.R. (nowadays the [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]]), between 1956 and 1959 on Sunday evenings. It was one of the most popular TV shows from the Flemish pioneer years.

==Concept==

"100.000 of niets" was originally part of another quiz, "Knal, wie vangt de bal?" ("Bang, who catches the ball?").&lt;ref name=manu&gt;ADRIAENS, Manu, Blijven kijken! 50 jaar televisie in Vlaanderen, Uitgeverij Lannoo, Tielt, 2003, blz. 147-148.&lt;/ref&gt; It aired on December 11, 1956 and by January 12, 1958 it became an independent weekly show. The show was hosted by Tony Corsari, Bob Van Bael and Pros Verbruggen and the jury was hosted by Mr. Van Hove, professor Lucien De Smet and Dr. A.J. Aernouts. In 1959 the show was cancelled. In 1968 it returned to the screen, presented by Pros Verbruggen, Jan Theys and Rudy Samson. Regine Clauwaert was the female guest host.&lt;ref name=manu/&gt;

Each show had three candidates and four thematical rounds. One candidate remained in the finale and had to answer one very detailed question correctly. The prize was 100.000 Belgian francs, though most of the time the winner just received a kitchen device.&lt;ref name=manu/&gt;

==Controversy==

While the show was popular quite some candidates criticized the correct answers needed. On March 9, 1958, one candidate named Van Cuyck lost after giving only one wrong answer in a series of seven correct ones. According to present-day norms many questions were phrased in an ambiguous manner and since every round the acceptance of dubious answers tended to differ at times.&lt;ref name=manu/&gt; One time a candidate complained that his answer was indeed correct, despite being told it wasn't. Host Tony Corsari personally made sure that the man received his award after all.&lt;ref name=manu/&gt;

Female host [[Liliane Taelemans]] received a lot of criticism because her clothes were considered to be "too revealing". She was eventually fired and in 1958 she went on to become the Belgian candidate for the [[Miss Universe]] election.&lt;ref name=manu/&gt;

==In popular culture==
* In ''[[The Adventures of Nero]]'' album "De Witte Parel" ("The White Pearl") (1962) [[Nero (comic book character)|Nero]] is a contestant on "100.000 of Niets". The host is a caricature of Tony Corsari.&lt;ref&gt;AUWERA, Fernand and DE SMET, Jan, "Marc Sleen", Standaard Uitgeverij, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ancient India''''' was a bi-annual and later, annual bulletin published by the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI) from 1946 to 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Aspects of Ancient Indian Technology |page=6 |first=Hari |last=C. Bharadwaj |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |isbn=8120830407|year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; It replaced the ''Annual Report'' that had previously been published by the Survey.&lt;ref name=RCM&gt;{{cite book|last1=Majumdar|first1=R.C.|title=Ancient India|date=2007|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|location=Delhi|isbn=8120804368|page=500|edition=Reprinted.|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=XNxiN5tzKOgC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Established in January 1946 by [[Sir Mortimer Wheeler]] during his tenure as Director-General of the ASI, ''Ancient India'' was published with an aim to "interest the educated Indian public in current work relating to the exploration and conservation of their great heritage of material culture" as well as to "provide technical matter primarily of interest to the archaeologist".&lt;ref name=TAJ&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=Cyril|last2=Childe|first2=V.

Some of the important archaeological discoveries reported in ''Ancient India'' include Wheeler's excavations at [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley sites]] and [[Arikamedu]] and the excavation of [[South India]]n [[Stone Age]] and [[megalithic]] sites at [[Brahmavalli]], [[Chandragiri]], [[Maski]] and [[Porkalam]] during the 1950s. The journal also contained scholarly articles on archaeology and epigraphy. On the centenary of the founding of the ASI in 1961, the journal carried a short commemorative piece on the history of the Archaeological Survey of India authored by [[Sourindranath Roy]]. The work was later expanded and published as a book the same year. After publishing 22 volumes, ''Ancient India'' was discontinued in 1966.

A new series of ''Ancient India'' was published in 2011.

In [[anthropology]], '''anthropopoiesis''' is the self-building process of social man and of a whole culture, particularly referred to what concerns modifications of socialized body. The concept found applications mainly in French and Italian contemporary literatures.

In accordance with theoretic background which supports the idea, man is an unfinished being or better his behaviour is not strongly prefixed by genetic heritage. Human beings become fully finished only by means of culture acquisition.

Anthropopoiesis is both anthropogenesis (man “reborn” as social creature) and manufacturing of ”mankind patterns and fictions”. Therefore social and cultural practices build up the man by means of ritual and institutional constraints.

An example could be circumcision, a practice widely existing in many rites of passage amongst Islamic and Jewish believers and also amongst traditional cultures and communities. Besides, Christians ascribe a clear meaning to the sacred garment and to the tonsure; they are convinced that some sacramental rites mark indelible dispositions. All that affects the body and through this one the perception of one’s own identity and social status.

'''Arabesque''' or '''Arabesk''' ({{lang-tr|Arabesk}}) is a term created by [[Turkey|Turkish]] musicologists for an Arabic style of music created in Turkey. The genre was particularly popular in Turkey in the decades from the 1960s through the 1990s. As with Arabic music itself, its aesthetics have evolved over the decades. Although melodies and rhythms are predominantly [[Byzantine music|Byzantine]] and Arabic influenced, it also draws ideas from other aspects of [[Music of Southeastern Europe|Balkan]] and [[Middle Eastern music]], including [[bağlama]] music and Ottoman forms of [[Music of Asia|oriental music]].
Arabesque music are mostly in a minor key, typically in the [[Phrygian mode]], and themes tend to focus on longing, melancholy, strife and love issues.

==Description and history==
A very small percentage of Arabesk is exclusively instrumental. For the great majority of it, a singer lies at the center of the music. Male singers dominated the genre in its early years, but female singers probably predominated during its peak years of popularity. Simultaneously with the influx of female singers, the sound grew more dancey and upbeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tarkandeluxe.blogspot.com/2004/05/turkish-music-and-artists.html#arab|title=Turkish Music and Artists: Arabesque|work=Yildirim, Ali. Tarkan DeLuxe, 2006 |accessdate=March 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Orhan Gencebay]] is generally considered the founder of the genre (though he disagrees with the usage of the term). Other well known older singers are [[Müslüm Gürses]], [[Ferdi Tayfur]] and Hakkı Bulut. One of the most prolific and commercially successful is [[İbrahim Tatlıses]], who broke all sales records in Turkey in 1978 and continues to turn out popular music to this day. He has maintained popularity in the Arabesk scene in recent years through remixing his tracks into dance-friendly club tracks. The pure Arabesk album "Acıların Kadını" (tr: woman of pains) by the singer [[Bergen (singer)|Bergen]] was the bestselling album in Turkey in 1986 and may be fairly labelled one of the classic albums of the genre. Bergen had several other hit Arabesk albums during the 1980s. Other singers include [[Gülben Ergen]], [[Ebru Gundes|Ebru Gündeş]], [[Seda Sayan]], [[Sibel Can]]. The singers [[Muazzez Ersoy]] and [[Bülent Ersoy]] designate themselves as modern exponents of [[Ottoman classical music]]. [[Zerrin Özer]] also made arabesque albums between 1982 and 1988, including her album named "Mutluluklar Dilerim" released in 1984. One of the important names of arabesque music who died in 2012 was [[Azer Bülbül]].
A common theme in Arabesque songs is the highly embellished and agonizing depiction of love and yearning, along with unrequited love, grief and pain. This theme had undertones of class differences in early 1960-70s, during which most of the genre's followers -mostly working class to lower middle class - identified themselves with. Turkish composer [[Fazıl Say]] has repeatedly condemned and criticized Arabesque genre, equating the practice of listening to Arabesque "tantamount to treason".

'''''At a Window in the Artist's Studio''''' is a drawing by the Danish painter, [[C. W. Eckersberg]]. It was done in 1852.

The drawing shows two girls by a window; these girls are probably the daughters of the artist. They are shown by a window facing [[Kongens Nytorv]] in [[Copenhagen]] but they are not watching anything on the square; they are reading a book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smk.dk/udforsk-kunsten/kunsthistorier/vaerker/vis/ved-et-vindue-i-kunstnerens-atelier-1852/ |title=At holde kaos på afstand|last1=Knudsen |first1=Vibeke Vibolt |last2= |first2= |date=2 February 2013 |work= |publisher=National Gallery of Denmark |accessdate=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bernard Lewis''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (31 May 1916 – 19 May 2018) was a [[British American]] historian specializing in [[oriental studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Bernard Lewis, Scholar and Political Advisor, Dead At 101 |url=https://www.jpost.com/Breaking-News/Bernard-Lewis-scholar-and-political-advisor-dead-at-101-557881 |work=[[Jerusalem Post]] |location=Jerusalem |date=20 May 2018 |access-date=20 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also known as a [[public intellectual]] and [[pundit (expert)|political commentator]]. Lewis was the Cleveland E. Dodge [[Emeritus|Professor Emeritus]] of Near Eastern Studies at [[Princeton University]]. Lewis' expertise was in the [[history of Islam]] and the interaction between Islam and the West. He was also noted in academic circles for his works on the [[history of the Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name="EH"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing|title=Bernard Lewis|first=Martin|last=Kramer|authorlink=|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn|location=London|year=1999|volume=1|pages=719–20|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.martinkramer.org%2Fsandbox%2Freader%2Farchives%2Fbernard-lewis%2F&amp;date=2010-11-13|url=http://www.geocities.com/martinkramerorg/BernardLewis.htm|archivedate=13 November 2010|accessdate=23 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis served as a soldier in the British Army in the [[Royal Armoured Corps]] and [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] during the [[Second World War]] before being seconded to the [[Foreign Office]]. After the war, he returned to the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] at the [[University of London]] and was appointed to the new chair in [[Near East|Near]] and Middle Eastern History.

In 2007 and 1999, respectively, Lewis was called "the West's leading interpreter of the Middle East"&lt;ref name=Abrahmson2007&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abrahmson|first1=James L.|title=Will the West – and the United States – Go the Distance?|url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/item/2007/0406/ed_distance.html|website=[[American Diplomacy]]|accessdate=16 February 2015|date=8 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "the most influential postwar historian of Islam and the Middle East".&lt;ref name="EH" /&gt; His advice was frequently sought by [[neoconservative]] policymakers, including the [[Presidency of George W.

Lewis was also notable for his public debates with [[Edward Said]], who accused Lewis and other [[orientalists]] of misrepresenting Islam and serving the purposes of imperialist domination,&lt;ref name="said"/&gt; to which Lewis responded by defending Orientalism as a facet of humanism and accusing Said of politicizing the subject.&lt;ref name="EH"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=New York Review of Books|title=Orientalism: An Exchange|authors=Edward W.

==Family and personal life==
Bernard Lewis was born to middle-class [[Jew]]ish parents, Harry Lewis and the former Jane Levy,&lt;ref name=EncyclopediaArts&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/lewis-bernard-1916|title=Lewis, Bernard 1916- - Dictionary definition of Lewis, Bernard 1916- - Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Stoke Newington]], London. He became interested in languages and history while preparing for his [[bar mitzvah]].{{sfn|Lewis|2004|pp= 1–2}}

Lewis became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1982. In 1947 he married Ruth Hélène Oppenhejm, with whom he had a daughter and a son. Their marriage was dissolved in 1974.&lt;ref name="EH"/&gt;

==Academic career==
In 1936, Lewis graduated from the School of Oriental Studies (now [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], SOAS) at the [[University of London]] with a [[bachelor's degree|BA]] in history with special reference to the [[Near East|Near]] and Middle East. He earned his PhD three years later, also from SOAS, specializing in the history of [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bernard Lewis Cleveland E. Dodge Professor of Near Eastern Studies, Emeritus |url=https://www.princeton.edu/~nes/faculty_lewis.html |website=University of Princeton |accessdate=26 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516012512/http://www.princeton.edu/~nes/faculty_lewis.html |archivedate=16 May 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis also studied law, going part of the way toward becoming a solicitor, but returned to study Middle Eastern history. He undertook post-graduate studies at the [[University of Paris]], where he studied with the orientalist [[Louis Massignon]] and earned the "Diplôme des Études Sémitiques" in 1937.&lt;ref name="EH"/&gt; He returned to SOAS in 1938 as an assistant lecturer in Islamic History.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/3602621/Profile-Professor-Bernard-Lewis.html|title=Profile: Professor Bernard Lewis|publisher=Telegraph|date=15 February 2004|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second World War]], Lewis served in the British Army in the [[Royal Armoured Corps]] and as a [[Corporal]] in the [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] in 1940–41 before being seconded to the [[Foreign Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sugarman|first1=Martin|title=Breaking the codes; Jewish personnel at Bletchley Park|url=http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/resources/filer.rhtm/595696/breaking+the+codes-+jewish+personnel+at+bletchley+park.pdf|website=Bletchley Park|accessdate=19 February 2015|date=6 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, he returned to SOAS. In 1949, at the age of 33, he was appointed to the new chair in Near and Middle Eastern History.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|pp=3–4}}

In 1974, aged 57, Lewis accepted a joint position at [[Princeton University]] and the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], also located in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]. The terms of his appointment were such that Lewis taught only one semester per year, and being free from administrative responsibilities, he could devote more time to research than previously. Consequently, Lewis's arrival at Princeton marked the beginning of the most prolific period in his research career during which he published numerous books and articles based on previously accumulated materials.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|pp=6–7}} After retiring from Princeton in 1986, Lewis served at [[Cornell University]] until 1990.&lt;ref name="EH"/&gt;

[[File:Robert Wistrich and Bernard Lewis.jpg|thumb|left|Bernard Lewis in 2007]]
In 1966, Lewis was a founding member of the [[learned society]], [[Middle East Studies Association of North America]] (MESA), but in 2007 he broke away and founded [[Association for the Study of the Middle East and Africa]] (ASMEA) to challenge MESA, which the ''[[New York Sun]]'' noted as "dominated by academics who have been critical of Israel and of America's role in the Middle East".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Karni|first1=Annie|title=Group formed to improve Middle East scholarship|url=http://www.nysun.com/new-york/group-formed-to-improve-middle-east-scholarship/66110/|accessdate=19 February 2015|work=The New York Sun|date=8 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was formed as an academic society dedicated to promoting high standards of research and teaching in Middle Eastern and African studies and other related fields, with Lewis as Chairman of its academic council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asmeascholars.org/|title=About ASMEA|publisher=ASMEA|date=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] selected Lewis for the [[Jefferson Lecture]], the U.S. federal government's highest honor for achievement in the [[humanities]]. His lecture, entitled "Western Civilization: A View from the East", was revised and reprinted in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' under the title "The Roots of Muslim Rage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jefferson Lecture|url=http://www.neh.gov/about/awards/jefferson-lecture|website=The National Endowment for the Humanities|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lewis|first1=Bernard|title=The roots of Muslim rage|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1990/09/the-roots-of-muslim-rage/304643/|website=The Atlantic|accessdate=19 February 2015|date=1 September 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 2007 [[Irving Kristol Lecture]], given to the [[American Enterprise Institute]], was published as ''Europe and Islam''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aei.org/publication/the-2007-irving-kristol-lecture-by-bernard-lewis/|title=The 2007 Irving Kristol Lecture by Bernard Lewis|publisher=AEI|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Lewis' influence extends beyond academia to the general public. He was a pioneer of the social and economic history of the Middle East and is famous for his extensive research of the [[Ottoman archives]].&lt;ref name="EH"/&gt; He began his research career with the study of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Arab, especially Syrian, history.&lt;ref name="EH"/&gt; His first article, dedicated to professional [[guild]]s of medieval Islam, had been widely regarded as the most authoritative work on the subject for about thirty years.&lt;ref name="Humphreys"&gt;{{cite journal|first=R. Stephen|last=Humphreys|journal=Humanities|title=Bernard Lewis: An Appreciation|volume= 11|issue=3|date=May–June 1990|pages=17–20|url=https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1YRNmBFbo4R32F3j9QChFTPdTi8TIa0_D6ZQ1D45vhAE|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the establishment of the state of [[Israel]] in 1948, scholars of Jewish origin found it more and more difficult to conduct archival and field research in Arab countries, where they were suspected of espionage. Therefore, Lewis switched to the study of the [[Ottoman Empire]], while continuing to research Arab history through the Ottoman archives&lt;ref name="EH"/&gt; which had only recently been opened to Western researchers. A series of articles that Lewis published over the next several years revolutionized the history of the Middle East by giving a broad picture of Islamic society, including its government, economy, and demographics.&lt;ref name="Humphreys"/&gt;

Lewis argued that the Middle East is currently backward and its decline was a largely self-inflicted condition resulting from both culture and religion, as opposed to the post-colonialist view which posits the problems of the region as economic and political maldevelopment mainly due to the 19th-century European colonization.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|pp=156–80}} In his 1982 work ''Muslim Discovery of Europe,'' Lewis argues that Muslim societies could not keep pace with the West and that "Crusader successes were due in no small part to Muslim weakness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Bernard|title=The Muslim Discovery of Europe|date=2001|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|isbn=978-0393321654|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, he suggested that as early as the 11th century Islamic societies were decaying, primarily the byproduct of internal problems like "cultural arrogance," which was a barrier to creative borrowing, rather than external pressures like the [[Crusades]].&lt;ref name="EH"/&gt;

In the wake of Soviet and Arab attempts to delegitimize Israel as a racist country, Lewis wrote a study of [[anti-Semitism]], ''Semites and Anti-Semites'' (1986).&lt;ref name="EH"/&gt; In other works he argued Arab rage against Israel was disproportionate to other tragedies or injustices in the Muslim world, such as the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] and control of Muslim-majority land in Central Asia, the bloody and destructive fighting during the [[Hama massacre|Hama uprising in Syria]] (1982), the [[Algerian Civil War]] (1992–1998), and the [[Iran–Iraq War]] (1980–1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Bernard|title=The Crisis of Islam: Holy War and Unholy Terror|date=2004|publisher=Random House Trade Paperbacks|location=New York|isbn=978-0812967852|pages=90–91, 108, 110–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his scholarly works, Lewis wrote several influential books accessible to the general public: ''The Arabs in History'' (1950), ''The Middle East and the West'' (1964), and ''The Middle East'' (1995).&lt;ref name="EH"/&gt; In the wake of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], the interest in Lewis's work surged, especially his 1990 essay ''The Roots of Muslim Rage''. Three of his books were published after 9/11: ''[[What Went Wrong?]]'' (written before the attacks), which explored the reasons of the Muslim world's apprehension of (and sometimes outright hostility to) modernization; ''[[The Crisis of Islam]]''; and ''Islam: The Religion and the People''.

===Armenian Genocide===
{{see also|Armenian Genocide denial}}

The first two editions of Lewis' ''The Emergence of Modern Turkey'' (1961 and 1968) describe the [[Armenian Genocide]] as "the terrible holocaust of 1915, when a million and a half Armenians perished".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karsh|first1=Efraim|title=Islamic Imperialism: A History|date=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Connecticut|isbn=978-0300106039|page=242|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LmZP3mixescC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Islamic+Imperialism:+A+History#v=snippet&amp;q=lewis&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later editions, this text is altered to "the terrible slaughter of 1915, when, according to estimates, more than a million Armenians perished, as well as an unknown number of [[Turkish people|Turks]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bostom|first1=Andrew G.|title=Bernard Lewis and Islam|url=http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=4127|website=FrontPageMagazine|accessdate=21 February 2015|date=6 June 2006|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709071712/http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=4127|archive-date=9 July 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this passage, Lewis argues that the deaths were the result of a struggle for the same land between two competing nationalist movements.&lt;ref name="suny"/&gt;

The change in Lewis' textual description of the [[Armenian Genocide]] and his signing of the petition against the Congressional resolution was controversial among some Armenian historians as well as journalists, who suggested that Lewis was engaging in [[historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionism]] to serve his own political and personal interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dadrian|first1=Vahakn N.|title=Warrant for Genocide: Key Elements of Turko-Armenian Conflict|date=2007|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick, N.J.|isbn=978-0765805591|pages=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis called the label "genocide" the "Armenian version of this history" in a November 1993 interview with ''[[Le Monde]]'', for which he faced a civil proceeding in a French court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Le Monde|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/europe/article/2005/04/22/l-historien-bernard-lewis-condamne-pour-avoir-nie-la-realite-du-genocide-armenien_641923_3214.html|title=L'historien Bernard Lewis condamné pour avoir nié la réalité du génocide arménien|date=22 Apr 2005|author=Nathaniel Herzberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a subsequent exchange on the pages of ''Le Monde'', Lewis wrote that while "terrible atrocities" did occur, "there exists no serious proof of a decision and of a plan of the Ottoman government aiming to exterminate the Armenian nation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Condamnation judiciaire de Bernard Lewis|url=http://www.voltairenet.org/article14133.html|website=Voltaire Network|accessdate=21 February 2015|language=French|date=8 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to both these articles, the court stated that Lewis "failed in his duty of objectivity and prudence in expressing himself without nuance on such a sensitive subject".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Condamnation judiciaire de Bernard Lewis|url=http://www.voltairenet.org/article14133.html|website=Voltaire Network|accessdate=21 February 2015|language=French|date=8 June 2004|quote=c’est en occultant les éléments contraires à sa thèse, que le défendeur a pu affirmer qu’il n’y avait pas de "preuve sérieuse" du génocide arménien ; [...] il a ainsi manqué à ses devoirs d’objectivité et de prudence, en s’exprimant sans nuance, sur un sujet aussi sensible (Translation: it is by concealing the elements contrary to his thesis that the defendant could affirm that there was no "serious proof" of the Armenian genocide; [...] he has thus failed in his duty of objectivity and prudence in expressing himself without nuance on such a sensitive subject)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was ordered to pay one [[franc (France)|franc]] as damages for his statements on the Armenian Genocide in Ottoman Turkey.&lt;ref name="Le Monde"&gt;{{cite news|title=Les actions engagées par les parties civiles arméniennes contre "le Monde" déclarées irrecevables par le tribunal de Paris|work=Le Monde|date=27 November 1994|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three other court cases against Bernard Lewis failed in the Paris tribunal, including one filed by the Armenian National Committee of France and two filed by [[Jacques Trémollet de Villers]].&lt;ref name="Le Monde"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lewis Replies|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~paw/archive_old/PAW95-96/16_9596/0605let.html#story3|website=Princeton Alumni Weekly|accessdate=21 February 2015|date=5 June 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis' views on the Armenian Genocide were criticized by a number of historians and sociologists, among them [[Alain Finkielkraut]], [[Yves Ternon]], [[Richard G. Hovannisian]], [[Robert Melson]], and [[Pierre Vidal-Naquet]].&lt;ref name=Auron&gt;{{cite book|last1=Auron|first1=Yair|title=The Banality of Denial: Israel and the Armenian Genocide|date=2005|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick, N.J.|isbn=978-0765808349|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Melson&gt;{{cite book|last1=Melson|first1=Robert|title=Revolution and Genocide: On the Origins of the Armenian Genocide and the Holocaust|date=1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226519906|page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacDonald|first1=David B.|title=''Identity Politics in the Age of Genocide: The Holocaust and Historical Representation'|date=2008|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415430616|page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finkelstein|first1=Norman G.|title=''The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering|date=2003|publisher=Verso|location=London|isbn=978-1859844885|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis has argued for his denial stance that:{{quote|The meaning of genocide is the planned destruction of a religious and ethnic group, as far as it is known to me, there is no evidence for that in the case of the Armenians. [...] There is no evidence of a decision to massacre. On the contrary, there is considerable evidence of attempts to prevent it, which were not very successful. Yes there were tremendous massacres, the numbers are very uncertain but a million may well be likely...&lt;ref name="ATA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ataa.org/reference/lewis.pdf|title=Statement of Professor Bernard Lewis, Princeton University, "Distinguishing Armenian Case from Holocaust"|publisher=Assembly of Turkish American Associations|date=14 April 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715105123/http://www.ataa.org/magazine/blewis_statement.pdf|archivedate=15 July 2006|deadurl=no|accessdate=21 February 2015|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; [and] the issue is not whether the massacres happened or not, but rather if these massacres were as a result of a deliberate preconceived decision of the Turkish government... there is no evidence for such a decision.&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt;}}

Lewis stated that he believed "to make [the Armenian Genocide] a parallel with the Holocaust in Germany" was "rather absurd".&lt;ref name="ATA"/&gt; In an interview with ''[[Ha'aretz]]'', he stated: {{quote|The deniers of Holocaust have a purpose: to prolong Nazism and to return to Nazi legislation. Nobody wants the 'Young Turks' back, and nobody wants to have back the Ottoman Law. What do the Armenians want? The Armenians want to benefit from both worlds. On the one hand, they speak with pride of their struggle against the Ottoman despotism, while on the other hand, they compare their tragedy to the Jewish Holocaust. I do not accept this. I do not say that the Armenians did not suffer terribly. But I find enough cause for me to contain their attempts to use the Armenian massacres to diminish the worth of the Jewish Holocaust and to relate to it instead as an ethnic dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Karpel|first1=Dalia|title=There Was No Genocide: Interview with Prof. Bernard Lewis|url=http://www.ataa.org/reference/karpel.html|accessdate=21 February 2015|work=Ha'aretz Weekly|publisher=Assembly of Turkish American Associations|date=23 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When Lewis received the [[National Humanities Medal]] from US President [[George W. Bush]] in November 2006, the [[Armenian National Committee of America]] objected: "The President's decision to honor the work of a known genocide denier—an academic mercenary whose politically motivated efforts to cover up the truth run counter to the very principles this award was established to honor—represents a true betrayal of the public trust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Armenian Genocide Denier Bernard Lewis Awarded National Humanities Medal |url=http://www.anca.org/press_releases/press_releases.php?prid=1024 |publisher=Armenian National Committee of America |accessdate=21 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221133530/http://www.anca.org/press_releases/press_releases.php?prid=1024 |archivedate=21 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views and influence on contemporary politics==
In the mid-1960s, Lewis emerged as a commentator on the issues of the modern Middle East and his analysis of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] and the rise of [[militant Islam]] brought him publicity and aroused significant controversy. American historian [[Joel Beinin]] has called him "perhaps the most articulate and learned Zionist advocate in the North American Middle East academic community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beinin|first1=Joel|title=Review of ''Semites and Anti-Semites: An Inquiry into Conflict and Prejudice'' by Bernard Lewis|journal=MERIP Middle East Report|date=July 1987|issue=147|pages=42–45|doi=10.2307/3011952|jstor=3011952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis's policy advice has particular weight thanks to this scholarly authority.&lt;ref name="Humphreys"/&gt; U.S. Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] remarked "in this new century, his wisdom is sought daily by policymakers, diplomats, fellow academics, and the news media".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks by Vice President Cheney at the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia Luncheon Honoring Professor Bernard Lewis |publisher=The White House|date=2 May 2006|accessdate=22 February 2015|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/05/20060501-3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A harsh critic of the [[Soviet Union]], Lewis continued the liberal tradition in Islamic historical studies. Although his early [[marxism|Marxist]] views had a bearing on his first book ''The Origins of Ismailism'', Lewis subsequently discarded Marxism. His later works are a reaction against the left-wing current of [[Third-worldism]] which came to be a significant current in [[Middle Eastern studies]].&lt;ref name="EH"/&gt;

During his career Lewis developed ties with governments around the world: during her time as Prime Minister of Israel, [[Golda Meir]] assigned Lewis' articles as reading to her cabinet members, and during the Presidency of George W. Bush, he advised administration members including Cheney, [[Donald Rumsfeld]] and Bush himself. He was also close to King [[Hussein of Jordan]] and his brother, [[Prince Hassan bin Talal]]. He also had ties to the regime of [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], the last [[Shah]] of [[Iran]], the Turkish military dictatorship led by [[Kenan Evren]], and the Egyptian government of [[Anwar Sadat]]: he acted as a go-between between the Sadat administration and Israel in 1971 when he relayed a message to the Israeli government regarding the possibility of a peace agreement at the request of Sadat's spokesman Tahasin Bashir.&lt;ref name=abukhalil /&gt;

[[File:David Horovitz interviews Bernard Lewis.jpg|thumb|left|[[David Horovitz]] interviewing Bernard Lewis in 2011]]
Lewis advocated closer Western ties with Israel and Turkey, which he saw as especially important in light of the extension of the Soviet influence in the Middle East. Modern Turkey holds a special place in Lewis's view of the region due to the country's efforts to become a part of the West.&lt;ref name="EH"/&gt; He was an Honorary Fellow of the [[Institute of Turkish Studies]], an honor which is given "on the basis of generally recognized scholarly distinction and ... long and devoted service to the field of Turkish Studies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About the Institute of Turkish Studies|url=http://www.turkishstudies.org/about/index.shtml|website=Institute of Turkish Studies |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis views [[Christendom]] and Islam as civilizations that have been in perpetual collision since the advent of Islam in the 7th century. In his essay ''The Roots of Muslim Rage'' (1990), he argued that the struggle between the West and Islam was gathering strength. According to one source, this essay (and Lewis' 1990 Jefferson Lecture on which the article was based) first introduced the term "[[Islamic fundamentalism]]" to North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haque|first1=Amber|editor1-last=Driel|editor1-first=Barry van|title=Confronting Islamophobia in Educational Practice|date=2004|publisher=Trentham Books|location=Stoke-on-Trent|isbn=978-1858563404|page=6|chapter=Islamophobia in North America: Confronting the Menace}}&lt;/ref&gt; This essay has been credited with coining the phrase "[[clash of civilizations]]", which received prominence in the eponymous book by [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]].&lt;ref name="Ajami"&gt;{{cite web|first=Fouad|last=Ajami|authorlink=Fouad Ajami|title=A Sage in Christendom: A Personal Tribute to Bernard Lewis|publisher=[[OpinionJournal]]|date=2 May 2006|accessdate=23 May 2006|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110008313}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, another source indicates that Lewis first used the phrase "clash of civilizations" at a 1957 meeting in Washington where it was recorded in the transcript.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liebowitz|first1=Ruthie Blum|title=One on One: When Defeat Means Liberation|url=http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Features/One-on-One-When-defeat-means-liberation|work=Jerusalem Post|date=6 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Lewis read in a London-based newspaper ''[[Al-Quds Al-Arabi]]'' a declaration of war on the United States by [[Osama bin Laden]]. In his essay "A License to Kill", Lewis indicated he considered bin Laden's language as the "ideology of [[jihad]]" and warned that bin Laden would be a danger to the West.&lt;ref name="Ajami"/&gt; The essay was published after the [[Clinton administration]] and the [[US intelligence community]] had begun its hunt for bin Laden in [[Sudan]] and then in [[Afghanistan]].

===Jihad===
Lewis presented some of his conclusions about [[Islamic culture]], [[Shari'a]] law, [[jihad]], and the modern day phenomenon of terrorism in his text ''Islam: The Religion and the People''.{{sfn|Lewis|Churchill|2008|pp=145–50}} He writes of jihad as a distinct "religious obligation", but suggests that "it is a pity" that people engaging in terrorist activities are not more aware of their own religion:

{{quote|Muslim fighters are commanded not to kill women, children, or the aged unless they attack first; not to torture or otherwise ill-treat prisoners; to give fair warning of the opening of hostilities or their resumption after a truce; and to honor agreements. ... At no time did the classical jurists offer any approval or legitimacy to what we nowadays call terrorism. Nor indeed is there any evidence of the use of terrorism as it is practiced nowadays."{{sfn|Lewis|Churchill|2008|pp=151}}}}

In Lewis' view, the "by now widespread terrorism practice of suicide bombing is a development of the 20th century" with "no antecedents in Islamic history, and no justification in terms of Islamic theology, law, or tradition".{{sfn|Lewis|Churchill|2008|p=153}} He further comments that "the fanatical warrior offering his victims the choice of the Koran or the sword is not only untrue, it is impossible" and that "generally speaking, Muslim tolerance of unbelievers was far better than anything available in Christendom, until the rise of secularism in the 17th century".{{sfn|Lewis|Churchill|2008|pp=146}}

This view has been criticised by [[As'ad AbuKhalil]], who noted  that: "Methodologically, [Lewis] insists that terrorism by individual Muslims should be considered Islamic terrorism, while terrorism by individual Jews or Christians is never considered Jewish or Christian terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;AbuKhalil, 2004, p. [https://www.scribd.com/document/169838430/bernard-lewis  134]&lt;/ref&gt; He also criticised Lewis' understanding of [[Osama bin Laden]], seeing Lewis' interpretation of bin Laden "as some kind of influential Muslim theologian" along the lines of classical theologians like [[Al-Ghazali]], rather than "the terrorist fanatic that he is". AbuKhalil has also criticised the place of Islam in Lewis' worldview more generally, arguing that the most prominent feature of his work was its "theologocentrism" (borrowing a term from [[Maxime Rodinson]]) - that Lewis interprets all aspects of behaviour among Muslims solely through the lens of [[Islamic theology]], subsuming the study of Muslim peoples, their languages, the geographical areas where Muslims predominate, Islamic governments, the governments of Arab countries and [[Sharia]] under the label of "Islam".&lt;ref name=abukhalil /&gt;

===Debates with Edward Said===
Lewis was known for his literary debates with [[Edward Said]], the Palestinian American [[Literary theory|literary theorist]] whose aim was to deconstruct what he called [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] scholarship. Said, who was a professor at [[Columbia University]], characterized Lewis' work as a prime example of Orientalism in his 1978 book ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' and in his later book ''[[Covering Islam]]''. Said asserted that the field of Orientalism was political intellectualism bent on self-affirmation rather than objective study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Said|first1=Edward W.|title=Orientalism|date=1979|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0394740676|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; a form of racism, and a tool of [[imperialism|imperialist]] domination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Windschuttle|first1=Keith|title=Edward Said's "Orientalism" Revisited|journal=The New Criterion|date=January 1999|volume=17|page=30|url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/Edward-Said-s--ldquo-Orientalism-rdquo--revisited-2937|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further questioned the scientific neutrality of some leading Middle East scholars, including Lewis, on the [[Arab World]]. In an interview with ''[[Al-Ahram]]'' weekly, Said suggested that Lewis' knowledge of the Middle East was so biased that it could not be taken seriously and claimed "Bernard Lewis hasn't set foot in the Middle East, in the Arab world, for at least 40 years. He knows something about Turkey, I'm told, but he knows nothing about the Arab world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Resources of Hope |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/631/focus.htm |accessdate=27 February 2015 |work=Al-Ahram Weekly |issue=631 |date=2 April 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221221020/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/631/focus.htm |archivedate=21 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Said considered that Lewis treats Islam as a monolithic entity without the nuance of its plurality, internal dynamics, and historical complexities, and accused him of "demagogy and downright ignorance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Said|first1=Edward W.|title=The Clash of Ignorance|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/clash-ignorance#|accessdate=27 February 2015|work=The Nation|date=4 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Covering Islam'', Said argued that "Lewis simply cannot deal with the diversity of Muslim, much less human life, because it is closed to him as something foreign, radically different, and other," and he criticised Lewis' "inability to grant that the Islamic peoples are entitled to their own cultural, political, and historical practices, free from Lewis' calculated attempt to show that because they are not Western... they can't be good."&lt;ref name="said"&gt;{{cite book|last=Said|first=Edward|title=Covering Islam: how the media and the experts determine how we see the rest of the world|year=1997|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-0-679-75890-7|pages=xxx–xxxi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rejecting the view that Western scholarship was biased against the Middle East, Lewis responded that Orientalism developed as a facet of European [[humanism]], independently of the past European imperial expansion.&lt;ref name="EH"/&gt; He noted the French and English pursued the study of Islam in the 16th and 17th centuries, yet not in an organized way, but long before they had any control or hope of control in the Middle East; and that much of Orientalist study did nothing to advance the cause of imperialism. In his 1993 book ''Islam and the West'', Lewis wrote "What imperial purpose was served by deciphering the ancient Egyptian language, for example, and then restoring to the Egyptians knowledge of and pride in their forgotten, ancient past?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Bernard|title=Islam and the West|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York City|isbn=978-0195090611|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Lewis accused Said of politicizing the scientific study of the Middle East (and Arabic studies in particular); neglecting to critique the scholarly findings of the Orientalists; and giving "free rein" to his biases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lewis|first1=Bernard|title=The Question of Orientalism|url=https://www.amherst.edu/media/view/307584/original/The+Question+of+Orientalism+by+Bernard+Lewis+%7C+The+New+York+Review+of+Books.pdf|publisher=New York Review of Books|accessdate=17 December 2017|date=24 June 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stance on the Iraq War===
In 2002, Lewis wrote an article for the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' regarding the buildup to the [[Iraq War]] entitled "Time for Toppling", where he stated his opinion that "a regime change may well be dangerous, but sometimes the dangers of inaction are greater than those of action".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lewis|first1=Bernard|title=Time for Toppling|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB1033089910971012713|accessdate=24 February 2015|work=Wall Street Journal|date=27 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, [[Jacob Weisberg]] described Lewis as "perhaps the most significant intellectual influence behind the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2161800|title=AEI's Weird Celebration|first=Jacob|last=Weisberg|work=Slate Magazine|date=14 March 2007|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Hirsh (journalist)|Michael Hirsh]] attributed to Lewis the view that regime change in Iraq would provide a jolt that would "modernize the Middle East" and suggested that Lewis' allegedly 'orientalist' theories about "what went wrong" in the Middle East, and other writings, formed the intellectual basis of the push towards war in Iraq. Hirsch reported that Lewis had told him in an interview that he viewed the [[September 11 attacks]] as "the opening salvo of the final battle" between Western and Islamic civilisations: Lewis believed that a forceful response was necessary. In the run up to the Iraq War, he met with Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] several times: Hirsch quoted an unnamed official who was present at a number of these meetings, who summarised Lewis' view of Iraq as "Get on with it. Don’t dither".&lt;ref name=hirsch /&gt; [[Brent Scowcroft]] quoted Lewis as stating that he believed "that one of the things you’ve got to do to Arabs is hit them between the eyes with a big stick. They respect power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/10/31/breaking-ranks|title=Breaking Ranks |last=Goldberg |first=Jeffrey|author-link=Jeffrey Goldberg|date=31 October 2005|website=[[newyorker.com]]|access-date=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As'ad AbuKhalil has claimed that Lewis assured Cheney that American troops would be welcomed by Iraqis and Arabs, relying on the opinion of his colleague [[Fouad Ajami]].&lt;ref name=abukhalil&gt;{{cite web |url=https://consortiumnews.com/2018/06/29/the-legacy-and-fallacies-of-bernard-lewis/|title=The Legacy and Fallacies of Bernard Lewis |last=AbuKhalil |first=As'ad|author-link=As'ad AbuKhalil |website=[[consortiumnews.com]] |access-date=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hirsch also drew parallels between the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]'s plans for post-invasion Iraq and Lewis' views, in particular his admiration for [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]'s [[Secularism|secularist]] and Westernising [[Atatürk's Reforms|reforms]] in the new [[History of the Republic of Turkey|Republic of Turkey]] which emerged from the collapse of the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name=hirsch&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hirsh |first1=Michael |title=Bernard Lewis Revisited |url=https://washingtonmonthly.com/2004/11/01/bernard-lewis-revisited/ |work=Washington Monthly |accessdate=24 February 2015 |date=November 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108162236/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0411.hirsh.html |archivedate=8 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 2008, Lewis did not advocate imposing freedom and democracy on Islamic nations. "There are things you can't impose. Freedom, for example. Or democracy. Democracy is a very strong medicine which has to be administered to the patient in small, gradually increasing doses. Otherwise, you risk killing the patient. In the main, the Muslims have to do it themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leibowitz|first1=Ruthie Blum|title=One on One: When Defeat Means Liberation|url=http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Features/One-on-One-When-defeat-means-liberation|accessdate=24 February 2015|work=The Jerusalem Post|date=6 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ian Buruma]], writing for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in an article subtitled "The two Minds of Bernard Lewis", finds Lewis's stance on the war difficult to reconcile with Lewis' past statements cautioning democracy enforcement in the world at large. Buruma ultimately rejects suggestions by his peers that Lewis promotes war with Iraq to safeguard Israel, but instead concludes "perhaps he loves it [the Arab world] too much":

{{quote|It is a common phenomenon among Western students of the Orient to fall in love with a civilization. Such love often ends in bitter impatience when reality fails to conform to the ideal. The rage, in this instance, is that of the Western scholar. His beloved civilization is sick. And what would be more heartwarming to an old Orientalist than to see the greatest Western democracy cure the benighted Muslim? It is either that or something less charitable: if a final showdown between the great religions is indeed the inevitable result of a millennial clash, then we had better make sure that we win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Buruma|first1=Ian|title=Lost in Translation: The Two Minds of Bernard Lewis|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/06/14/lost-in-translation-3?currentPage=all|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=24 February 2015|date=14 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Hamid Dabashi]], writing on 28 May 2018, in an article subtitled "On Bernard Lewis and 'his extraordinary capacity for getting everything wrong'",  asked: "Just imagine: What sort of a person would spend a lifetime studying people he loathes? It is quite a bizarre proposition. But there you have it: the late Bernard Lewis did precisely that." Similarly, [[Richard Bulliet]] described Lewis as "...a person who does not like the people he is purporting to have expertise about...he doesn’t respect them, he considers them to be good and worthy only to the degree they follow a Western path".&lt;ref name=hirsch /&gt; According to [[As'ad AbuKhalil]], "Lewis has poisoned the Middle East academic field more than any other Orientalist and his influence has been both academic and political. But there is a new generation of Middle East experts in the West who now see clearly the political agenda of Bernard Lewis. It was fully exposed in the Bush years."&lt;ref&gt;[https://english.al-akhbar.com/node/14409 Bernard Lewis and His Reputation] by As'ad AbuKhalil,  2012-12-17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleged nuclear threat from Iran===
In 2006, Lewis wrote that [[Iran]] had been working on a [[Iranian nuclear program|nuclear weapon]] for fifteen years. In August 2006, in an article about whether the world can rely on the concept of [[mutual assured destruction]] as a deterrent in its dealings with Iran, Lewis wrote in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' about the significance of 22 August 2006 in the [[Islamic calendar]]. The Iranian president had indicated he would respond by that date to U.S. demands regarding Iran's development of nuclear power. Lewis wrote that the date corresponded to the 27th day of the month of Rajab of the year 1427, the day Muslims commemorate the night flight of [[Muhammad]] from [[Jerusalem]] to heaven and back. Lewis wrote that it would be "an appropriate date for the apocalyptic ending of Israel and, if necessary, of the world".&lt;ref name="August 22"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lewis|first1=Bernard|title=August 22|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115500154638829470|accessdate=26 February 2015|work=Wall Street Journal|date=8 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lewis, mutual assured destruction is not an effective deterrent in the case of Iran, because of what Lewis describes as the Iranian leadership's "apocalyptic worldview" and the "suicide or martyrdom complex that plagues parts of the Islamic world today".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greene|first1=Thomas C.|title=Nuclear Holocaust Starts Today: ''WSJ''|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/08/21/iran_brings_it_on/|accessdate=26 February 2015|work=The Register|date=21 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then suggested the possibility of a nuclear strike on Israel on 22 August 2006:
{{quote|What is the significance of Aug. 22? This year, Aug. 22 corresponds, in the Islamic calendar, to the 27th day of the month of Rajab of the year 1427. This, by tradition, is the night when many Muslims commemorate the night flight of Muhammad on the winged horse [[Buraq]], first to "the farthest mosque," usually identified with Jerusalem, and then to heaven and back{{Quran-usc|17|1|q=}}. This might well be deemed an appropriate date for the apocalyptic ending of Israel and if necessary of the world. It is far from certain that Mr. [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad|Ahmadinejad]] plans any such cataclysmic events precisely for 22 Aug.. But it would be wise to bear the possibility in mind.&lt;ref name="August 22"/&gt;}}

Lewis' article received significant press coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Eslocker|first1=Asa|title=August 22: Doomsday?|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2006/08/is_tomorrow_doo/|accessdate=26 February 2015|work=ABC News|date=21 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krieger|first1=Hilary Leila|title=Apocalypse Now?|url=http://www.jpost.com/Iranian-Threat/News/Apocalypse-now|accessdate=26 February 2015|work=Jerusalem Post|date=22 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the day passed without any incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greene|first1=Thomas C.|title=Nuclear Apocalypse Milder Than Expected: Back to the Ouija Board|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/08/23/lucky_to_be_alive/|accessdate=26 February 2015|work=The Register|date=23 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gawenda|first1=Michael|title=World Survives, But Solution on Iran is No Closer|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/world-survives-but-solution-on-iran-is-no-closer/2006/08/25/1156012739245.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=26 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://foreignpolicy.com/2006/08/30/one-week-and-still-no-nuclear-apocalypse/ One week…and still no nuclear apocalypse], Aditya Dasgupta, August 30, 2006, [[Foreign Policy]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2009 book ''Engaging the Muslim World'', the American academic [[Juan Cole]] responded that there was no evidence to suggest that Iran had been working on a nuclear weapon for fifteen years. He also disagreed with Lewis' suggestion that Ahmadinejad "might deploy this weapon against Israel on 22 August 2006".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Juan|last=Cole|authorlink =Juan Cole|title=Engaging the Muslim World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GPBmXHgWWU4C|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GPBmXHgWWU4C&amp;pg=PA205 205]|year=2009 |isbn=9780230620575}}

Bernard Lewis died on 19 May 2018 at the age of 101, at an assisted-living care facility in [[Voorhees Township, New Jersey]], twelve days before his 102nd birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Murphy|first1=Brian|title=Bernard Lewis, eminent historian of the Middle East, dies at 101|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/bernard-lewis-eminent-historian-of-the-middle-east-dies-at-101/2018/05/19/4f0db6b8-5bad-11e8-8836-a4a123c359ab_story.html?noredirect=on|accessdate=19 May 2018|date=19 May 2018|newspaper=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Political anthropology|expanded=Basic concepts}}

A '''big man''' is a highly influential individual in a [[tribe]], especially in [[Melanesia]] and [[Polynesia]]. Such a person may not have formal tribal or other authority (through for instance material possessions, or inheritance of rights), but can maintain recognition through skilled persuasion and wisdom. The big man has a large group of followers, both from his [[clan]] and from other clans. He provides his followers with protection and economic assistance, in return receiving support which he uses to increase his status.

==Big man "system"==

The [[United States|American]] anthropologist [[Marshall Sahlins]] has studied the big man phenomenon. In his much-quoted&lt;ref&gt;
James Whitley ("Social Diversity in Dark Age Greece", ''The Annual of the British School at Athens'' '''86''' (1991:341-365) applied Sahlins' ethnographic model to instability in settlement patterns during the [[Greek Dark Age]], 10th-8th centuries BCE.
&lt;/ref&gt; 
1963 article  "Poor Man, Rich Man, Big Man, Chief: Political Types in [[Melanesia]] and [[Polynesia]]", Sahlins uses analytically constructed ideal-types of hierarchy and equality to compare a larger-scale Polynesian-type hierarchical society of chiefs and sub-chiefs with a Melanesian-type big-man system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |URL=http://tapera.info/textos/sahlins,hrhp.pdf |author=Marshall Sahlins |title=Poor Man, Rich Man, Big Man, Chief; Political Types in Melanesia and Polynesia |journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History |volume=5 |number=3 |pages=285-303 |date=April 1963 |archive-date=1 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101000000/http://tapera.info/textos/sahlins,hrhp.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter consists of segmented lineage groups, locally held together by faction-leaders who compete for power in the social structure of horizontally arranged and principally equal groupings (factions). Here, leadership is not ascribed, but rather gained through action and competition "with other ambitious men".

==Position==
{{main|Moka exchange}}
A big man's position is never secured in an inherited position at the top of a hierarchy, but is always challenged by the different big-men who compete with one another in an ongoing process of [[reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] and re-distribution of material and political resources. As such the big man is subject to a [[Transactional analysis|transactional]] order based on his ability to balance the simultaneously opposing pulls of securing his own renown through distributing resources to other big man groups (thereby spreading the word of his power and abilities) ''and'' redistributing resources to the people of his own faction (thereby keeping them content followers of his able leadership).

The big man concept is relatively fluid, and formal authority of such figures is very low to nonexistent. His position is not inherently heritable.

In the Island of Malaita in Solomon Islands the big man system is dying away as westernization is influencing the people,{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} but the big man system can be seen at the political level. Every four years in [[Solomon Islands]]' National Elections the system can be clearly seen among the people, especially in the Melanesian Islands.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

==System in Papua New Guinea==
The first use of the term may be found in the English-translation of Dreissig Jahre in der Sudsee (1907) by [[Richard Parkinson (explorer)|Richard Parkinson]]. The term may be often found in many historical works dealing with Papua New Guinea. Andrew J. Strathern&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, ''The Rope of Moka: big-men and ceremonial exchange in Mount Hagen, Papua New Guinea'' (Cambridge, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; applies the concept of big-men to a community in [[Mount Hagen]], Papua New Guinea.

Traditionally, among peoples of non-[[Austronesian]]-speaking communities, authority was obtained by a man (the so-called "big man") recognised as "performing most capably in social, political, economic and ceremonial activities".&lt;ref&gt;Waiko, John D. (1993). ''A Short History of Papua New Guinea'', Melbourne: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-553164-7}}, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; His function was not to command, but to influence his society through his example. He was expected to act as a negotiator with neighbouring groups, and to periodically redistribute food (generally produced by his wives). In this sense, he was seen as ensuring the well-being of his community.

Such a system is still found in many parts of [[Papua New Guinea]], and other parts of [[Melanesia]].

The '''Centre for Deaf Studies''' was a department of the [[University of Bristol]], England, in the field of [[deaf studies]], which it defines as the study of the "language, community and culture of Deaf people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bristol University Milestone for Deaf People|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2008/5924.html|publisher=University of Bristol|accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 1978, the Centre claimed to be the first higher educational Institute in Europe "to concentrate solely on research and education that aims to benefit the Deaf community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research study to examine genetics, power and Deafhood|url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/news/2010/7315.html|publisher=University of Bristol|accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre was at the forefront in establishing the disciplines of deaf studies and [[deafhood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deafhood|url=http://www.signstation.org/index.php/deafhood-studies|publisher=Signstation|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ditum|first1=Sarah|title=Deaf people's linguistic culture is being allowed to disintegrate|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/13/deaf-people-linguistic-culture-disintegrate|accessdate=9 December 2015|work=Guardian|date=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used [[British Sign Language]] (BSL), had a policy of [[bilingual]] communication in BSL and English, and employed a majority of [[deaf]] teaching staff.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;

The Centre offered [[Bachelor of Science]] (BSc) and [[Master of Science]] (MSc) courses, as well as research degrees at [[MPhil]] and PhD level. Bristol University announced plans to close the BSc course in May 2010 after a failed campaign by the centre's supporters and staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Campaign to save deaf studies degree at Bristol Uni|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/8694686.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="savedeafstudies.org.uk"&gt;http://www.savedeafstudies.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013 the Centre was being gradually shut down by the University, by means of a program of [[Redundancy in United Kingdom law|redundancies]] and staff attrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Save the Centre for Deaf Studies at University of Bristol|url=https://educationactivistnetwork.wordpress.com/2010/06/01/save-the-centre-for-deaf-studies-at-university-of-bristol/|publisher=Education Activist Network|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Centre was founded in 1978. Early research into the acquisition and usage of BSL was the first funded research into the topic in the UK.&lt;ref name=napier/&gt; In 1980, the Centre produced the first coding manual for BSL, followed by the first textbook on the language in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gertz|first1=Genie|last2=Boudreault|first2=Patrick|title=The SAGE Deaf Studies Encyclopedia|date=2016|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781506341668|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s-15CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT663&amp;lpg=PT663&amp;dq=Bristol+BSL+first+textbook&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HzUbig9az9&amp;sig=rWytS8tJolkHxM1qdwZ2OZlwjSw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi80KPhtvfKAhXDvxQKHZqPDfgQ6AEISTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Bristol%20BSL%20first%20textbook&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, the Centre ran the first National Conference on Sign Language in the UK, and the following year it hosted the first International Conference on Sign Language to be held in the UK. It also organised the first International Deaf Researchers Workshop in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kellett Bidoli|first1=Cynthia J.|last2=Ochse|first2=Elana|title=English in International Deaf Communication|date=2008|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9783039116102|page=433|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ScmVI4JwGqwC&amp;pg=PA433&amp;lpg=PA433&amp;dq=Bristol+first+International+Deaf+Researchers+Workshop+in+1985&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lYX8mBONvh&amp;sig=SygRWA7mKbMIVA8e4BnMXfV7PxI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiLh8K1t_fKAhWEPhQKHSf9ApQQ6AEIMTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Bristol%20first%20International%20Deaf%20Researchers%20Workshop%20in%201985&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the Centre coined the term "[[deaf studies]]",&lt;ref name=napier&gt;{{cite book|last1=Napier|first1=Jemina|last2=Leeson|first2=Lorraine|title=Sign Language in Action|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137309785|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ITrvCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT36&amp;lpg=PT36&amp;dq=Centre+for+Deaf+Studies,+Bristol+term+deaf+studies&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GFGLmVlDnv&amp;sig=dAm4y-mZb038OLgwtDaMsIWmpNY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQypuzrc_JAhVI7hoKHf_aB7sQ6AEIVjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Centre%20for%20Deaf%20Studies%2C%20Bristol%20term%20deaf%20studies&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2001, it established the first professorship in the discipline. Also in 2001, it employed a deaf director, the first time that the head of a European academic Centre had been deaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Linda Day - Vice Chair|url=https://www.bda.org.uk/trustees-linda-day-vice-chair|publisher=British Deaf Association|accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the book ''Understanding Deaf Culture: In Search of Deafhood'', by the Centre's researcher [[Paddy Ladd]], popularised the term "[[deafhood]]", which Ladd had coined in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Ladd P.

Research at the Centre fell into five areas: the language, linguistics and literature of [[sign language]]; acquisition of sign language; community and [[deaf culture]], known as "[[deafhood]]"; [[cognition]] and [[psychology]]; and the applications of technology, such as [[videophone|videotelephony]] and [[e-learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centre for Deaf Studies|url=http://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/organisations/centre-for-deaf-studies(2b99be39-16a6-4a03-a8c0-d3fb15992afb).html|publisher=University of Bristol|accessdate=9 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131023156/http://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/organisations/centre-for-deaf-studies%282b99be39-16a6-4a03-a8c0-d3fb15992afb%29.html|archivedate=31 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; An audio-visual phone went on trial with the [[Avon and Somerset Constabulary|Avon and Somerset Police]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/8669803.stm BBC News: Avon and Somerset Police trial new audio-visual phone (8 May 2010)] (accessed 14 May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Courses and services==
The Centre was an innovator in education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New app will help make sign language communication more accessible|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2012/8757.html|publisher=University of Bristol|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Innovations in information delivery for sign language users|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2008/212017945426.html|publisher=University of Bristol|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, it offered the first university-level certificate course in BSL for professionals. In 1985, it started a diploma course, social science in deaf studies. This was followed in 1987 by a part-time course in sign language interpretation, which became full-time in 1990. In 1992, the Centre established the earliest full-time, university-level training programme for Deaf people to be taught in sign language. In 1993, a Diploma of Higher Education was established, the earliest undergraduate course on deaf studies in the UK, and in 1999, the first BSc and MSc in deaf studies followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A history of CDS: the heritage that will be lost with closure|url=http://www.savedeafstudies.org.uk/?p=480|publisher=Save Deaf Studies|accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University of Bristol|Bristol]] was one of a handful of universities in the UK to offer an undergraduate degree in deaf studies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/student/career-planning/az-careers/deaf-studies-671539.html Atherton M. Deaf studies. ''Independent'' (1 February 2008)] (accessed 12 May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, the university announced plans to close the undergraduate course as part of a drive to save £15 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Protests-uni-plan-cut-deaf-studies/article-2139564-detail/article.html Staff and students turned out in force to protest at Bristol University's plan to cut deaf studies. ''Bristol Evening Post'' (11 May 2010)] (accessed 12 May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign against this focussed on the lack of justice in targeting staff and students with particular needs, and the aggressiveness of the University's approach to the CDS, led by the Dean, Dr Judith Squires.&lt;ref name="savedeafstudies.org.uk"/&gt; There were accusations that her Faculty saved other units only by sacrificing the CDS. The shutdown of the programme was successful and the last students from the undergraduate degree graduated in 2013.

The Centre offered until recently taught postgraduate courses: a certificate and diploma in deaf studies, and an MSc in Deaf Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World's first masters degree in Deafhood Studies|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2009/6249.html|publisher=University of Bristol|accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre also offered a range of short courses, including BSL, BSL interpreting and Deafhood studies. Deafstation, a daily news service in BSL, was run by the centre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deafstation.org/deafstationDev/showUserHomePage.do Deafstation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313123405/http://www.deafstation.org/deafstationDev/showUserHomePage.do |date=13 March 2010 }} (accessed 12 May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staff==
In 2012, close to closure, the Centre's director was Sandra Smith. The Harry Crook Professor in Deaf Studies was Jim Kyle, who was at Bristol for over 20 years and is a leading expert on Deaf policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor Jim Kyle|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/media/experts/jsp/public_view/expertDetails?personKey=zypLYsvIABGOe103PCkZjWqiyHs0sq|publisher=University of Bristol|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Survey for a new MSc in Sign Language and Deaf Studies|url=http://www.signature.org.uk/news.php?article=517|publisher=Signature|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers included a Reader, Dr [[Paddy Ladd]], a lecturer, Dr Sarah Batterbury, and several researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deaf Studies|url=http://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/searchall.html?searchall=Deaf+Studies|website=Bristol Research|publisher=University of Bristol|accessdate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of teaching staff were Deaf.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;[http://www.bris.ac.uk/deaf/english/about/ University of Bristol: Centre for Deaf Studies: About the Centre] (accessed 12 May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2012, the academic staff were offered part-time contracts only, or redundancy - to take effect in 2013. All accepted redundancy, except Prof. Kyle. The Deaf community accused Bristol University of trying to close the Centre through staff attrition; by shutting the undergraduate degree, they were able to claim that few staff were needed for teaching.&lt;ref name="savedeafstudies.org.uk"/&gt;

==Closure==
The University stopped admitting students in 2013. University Council passed a resolution with only a vote of dissent. It later emerged that the CDS building would be sold to a church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=One day after Bristol University’s Centre for Deaf Studies closes, letter reveals Bristol Deaf Centre will be sold|url=http://limpingchicken.com/2013/08/02/deaf-news-one-day-after-bristol-universitys-centre-for-deaf-studies-closes-letter-reveals-bristol-deaf-centre-will-be-sold/|publisher=Limping Chicken|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1752">The '''Deutsche Gesellschaft für Vorgeschichte (DGV)''' (German Society for Prehistory) was a society founded in 1909 by [[Gustaf Kossinna]] with the participation of [[Hans Hahne (Archaeologist)|Hans Hahne]], [[Wilhelm Ohnesorge (Historian)|Wilhelm Ohnesorge]] and others. The organization was committed to national prehistory and early history research and to providing a broad basis fo German Archeology as a discipline with a historical goal. In its first year the first edition of the magazine ''[[Mannus (Zeitschrift)|Mannus]]'' was published. In 1913, at a special general meeting, the change of name to ''Gesellschaft für Deutschen Vorgeschichte'' (GDV) was approved by a large majority. After Kossinna's death, [[Alfred Götze (prehistorian)|Alfred Götze]] initially took over the leadership of the society. In 1933, in the course of ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'', the board decided  to "expand" itself to the ''Reichsbund für Deutsche Vorgeschichte'' at the request of [[Hans Reinerth]]. This decision was confirmed a year later by the General Assembly. Also in 1934 Reinerth became leader (''Bundesführer'') of the Reichsbund.

In 1968, the society was re-founded as the ''Gesellschaft für Vor- und Frühgeschichte (Bonn)'' by [[Bolko von Richthofen]]. He again published a periodical called ''Mannus''. The members, who are mainly associated with right to far-right extremist views, included, among others the "Atlantis Researchers" Jürgen Spanuth, [[Herman Wirth]], and Haye W. Hansen. "Mannus" was discontinued in 1994 after 24 issues.

In the United States, a '''donor-advised fund''' is a charitable giving vehicle administered by a public charity created to manage charitable donations on behalf of organizations, families, or individuals. To participate in a donor-advised fund, a donating individual or organization opens an account in the fund and deposits cash, securities, or other financial instruments. They surrender ownership of anything they put in the fund, but retain advisory privileges over  how their account is invested, and how it distributes money to charities.

==Background==
A donor-advised fund provides a flexible way for donors to pass money through to charities—an alternative to direct giving or creating a [[private foundation]]. Donors enjoy administrative convenience (the sponsoring organization does the paperwork after the initial donation), cost savings (a foundation requires around 2.5% to 4% of its assets each year to run), and tax advantages (versus individual giving) by conducting their grantmaking through the fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Olk |first=Jennifer M. |first2=Wendy |last2=Richards |title=Choosing the Right Charitable Vehicle: A Comparison of Private Foundations, Supporting Organizations, and Donor Advised Funds |journal=The National Law Review |date=December 25, 2013 |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/choosing-right-charitable-vehicle-comparison-private-foundations-supporting-organiza}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A donor-advised fund has some disadvantages compared to a private foundation, and some advantages.  Both can accept donations of unusual or illiquid assets (e.g., part ownership of a private company, art, real estate, partnerships or limited partnership shares), but a donor advised fund has higher deductions for these gifts (depending on the gift). In addition, the founders or board of a private foundation have complete control over where its giving goes within broad legal bounds. In a donor-advised fund, the donor only ''advises'' the sponsoring organization where the money should go. While rare, a sponsoring organization could conceivably ignore the donor's intent. In addition, most donor-advised funds can only give to IRS certified 501(c)(3) organizations or their foreign equivalents. This rules out, for example, most kinds of donations to individuals, and scholarships—both things a private foundation can do more easily.  Donor-advised funds do reap a significant cost advantage (foundations carry a 2.5-4% of assets overhead expense to maintain, a 1-2% excise tax on NET investment earnings and a required 5% spending of assets each year) but may also have one more drawback---limited lifetime, although this varies depending on the sponsor. American Endowment Foundation for example allows successor advisors in perpetuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aefonline.org/|title=Donor Advised Funds at American Endowment Foundation|website=www.aefonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a foundation can persist for generations or in perpetuity, some sponsoring organizations impose a "sunset" on donor-advised funds, after which they collapse individual funds into their general charity pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smallfoundations.org/ |title=The Association of Small Foundations is now Exponent Philanthropy |publisher=Smallfoundations.org |accessdate=2015-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221132358/http://www.smallfoundations.org/ |archivedate=2014-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because a public charity houses the fund, donors receive the maximum tax deduction available, while avoiding [[excise tax]]es and other restrictions imposed on private foundations. Further, donors avoid the cost of establishing and administering a private foundation, including staffing and legal fees. The donor receives the maximum tax deduction at the time they donate to their account, and the foundation that administers the fund gains full control over the contribution, granting the donor advisory status. As such, the administrating fund is not legally bound to the donor, but makes grants to other public charities on the donor's ''recommendation''. Most foundations that offer donor-advised funds only make grants from these funds to other public charities, and usually perform [[due diligence]] to verify the grantee's tax-exempt status.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

[[Drexel University]] [[environmental sociology|environmental sociologist]] [[Robert Brulle]], who has studied networks of nonprofit funding, described donor-advised funds:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this type of foundation, individuals or other foundations contribute money to the donor directed foundation, and it then makes grants based on the stated preferences of the original contributor. This process ensures that the intent of the contributor is met while also hiding that contributor's identity. Because contributions to a donor directed foundation are not required to be made public, their existence provides a way for individuals or corporations to make anonymous contributions.&lt;ref name=brulle&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brulle |first1=Robert J. |authorlink=Robert Brulle |title=Institutionalizing delay: foundation funding and the creation of U.S. climate change counter-movement organizations |journal=[[Climatic Change (journal)|Climatic Change]] |date=December 21, 2013 |volume=122 |issue=4 |pages=681–694 |doi=10.1007/s10584-013-1018-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whitney Ball, co-founder and executive director of the donor-advised fund [[Donors Trust]], described donor-advised funds:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A donor-advised fund begins with a donor contributing cash or assets to a public charity, which in turn creates a separate account for the donor, who may recommend disbursements from the fund to other public charities. Technically, the charity that sponsors the fund has final say on the disbursements, and it is legally required to ensure they go only to charitable purposes, but in normal circumstances the original donor's requests will be followed.&lt;ref name=roundtable&gt;{{cite news|title=The future of donor-advised funds |url=http://www.donorstrust.org/portals/0/PDF/Roundtable_WB_Interview_2005.pdf |accessdate=February 10, 2015 |publisher=[[Philanthropy Roundtable]] |date=September 2005 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606204138/http://www.donorstrust.org/portals/0/PDF/Roundtable_WB_Interview_2005.pdf |archivedate=June 6, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nowadays, donor-advised funds are even less like traditional foundations. The simultaneous growth of DAFs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nptrust.org/daf-report/recent-growth.html|title=Trends for Donor Advised Funds in Recent Years - 2015 DAF Report|website=www.nptrust.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''and'' online giving&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/samanthasharf/2014/02/05/charitable-giving-grew-in-2013-as-online-giving-picked-up/#34d33ac814a9|title=Charitable Giving Grew 4.9% In 2013 As Online Donations Picked Up|first=Samantha|last=Sharf|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has led to some, like [https://web.archive.org/web/20160622210328/https://www.charitybox.com/ CharityBox], that are run by start-up companies through a web/mobile platform. Such companies allow donors to give directly to 501(c)(3) organizations and instantly receive tax-deductible receipts via email.

==History==
The [[New York Community Trust]] pioneered donor-advised funds in 1931. Though the second such fund was not created until 1935,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wsfoundation.org/netcommunity/page.aspx?pid=825 |title=About Us - The Winston-Salem Foundation |publisher=Wsfoundation.org |date=1919-10-14 |accessdate=2015-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; the field has greatly expanded since, as commercial sponsors, educational institutions, and independent charities started offering the service. Donor-advised funds are the fastest growing charitable giving vehicle in the [[United States of America|U.S.]]—more than 269,000 donor-advised accounts, hold over $78 billion in assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nptrust.org/daf-report/ |title=Charitable Giving Statistics |publisher=NPTrust |date=2015-02-17 |accessdate=2015-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation==
Current U.S. tax law allows the donor of appreciated securities or other assets to get a tax deduction for the market value of the donation and avoid [[capital gains]] taxes.  This double tax advantage can make donating appreciated assets to a charitable organization more attractive than selling the assets and donating cash.  By donating appreciated assets to a donor-advised fund and then advising the fund to make donations to several charities, one can reap these tax advantages without the hassle and paperwork of transferring non-cash assets to several organizations.  This combination of convenience and full tax advantage is one reason that donor-advised funds are used.

While [[private foundation]]s in the United States are heavily regulated by the [[Internal Revenue Service]], including rules on oversight and minimum annual payouts, donor-advised funds housed in public charities are not subject to the same tax restrictions.

In 1985, National Foundation, Inc. (NFI, now WaterStone), defended its standard for the management of donor-advised funds against the [[Internal Revenue Service]] in the United States tax court in National Foundation, Inc. v. United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.pgdc.com/pgdc/story/national-foundation-inc-v-united-states-america |title=National Foundation, Inc. v. The United States of America &amp;#124; Planned Giving Design Center |publisher=Pgdc.com |accessdate=2015-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court found that NFI was eligible for tax-exemption and could be classified as a [[501(c)]](3) non-profit organization based on their management of donor-advised funds. NFI had complete control and ownership of what would later be called donor-advised funds, and could exercise discretion in authorizing charitable distributions of the funds. Donors maintained advisory privileges, but NFI was not obligated to use the funds based on their recommendations, especially if the receiving party did not comply with the five standards of a [[charitable organization]], identified by the court: 1) that it be consistent with the charitable purposes specified in section 501(c)(3); (2) that it have a reasonable budget; (3) that it be adequately funded; (4) that it be staffed by competent and well trained personnel; and (5) that it be capable of effective monitoring and supervision by NFI. The outcome of this case opened the door for many other providers to launch donor-advised fund programs.
On August 17, 2006, [[George W. Bush|President George W. Bush]] signed the [[Pension Protection Act of 2006]] (H.R. 4) into law, which includes a number of changes to the regulatory framework for donor-advised funds, and follows both [[US House of Representatives|House]] and [[US Senate|Senate]] passage of H.R. 4. The [[Pension Protection Act of 2006]] established guidelines for the management of donor-advised funds, using NFI's standards as a framework. The sections dealing with donor-advised funds include:

* Legal definition of a donor-advised fund.
* A list of prohibited payments to donors and advisers to donor-advised fund.
* New rules about what grants can be made ''from'' donor-advised funds.
* The documentation required for all contributions ''to'' donor-advised funds.

==Tax efficiency example==
The following example is taken from [[The Vanguard Group|Vanguard]]'s marketing material for their plan:

Suppose you have 1,000 shares of stock that you purchased 15 years ago (thus, you're in long term [[capital gain]]s territory). Assume that you purchased the stock for $10 per share and it is now worth $100 per share. Now, let's compare the cost to the donor of making a contribution of $100,000 to a charity of your choice.  We assume a 35% income tax rate and 15% long term capital gains tax rate.

'''Option 1: Contribute cash from sale of securities'''
* Immediate cost of donation: $100,000
* Capital gains tax incurred: $13,500 (15% times ($100k minus $10k))
* Net income tax saving: ($21,500) (35% times $100k deduction, minus the capital gains amount)

Charity receives $100,000 for a net cost to donor of $78,500

'''Option 2: Contribute appreciated securities'''
* Immediate cost of donation: $100,000
* Income tax saved: ($35,000) (35% times $100k)

Charity receives $100,000 for a net cost to donor of $65,000

Thus, by donating appreciated securities rather than selling them, one can contribute the same total amount with reduced effective donor cost. This is true whether or not one uses a donor-advised fund.

If the securities increase in value after they have been given to the donor-advised fund (but before the grant recommendation is actually made), no additional tax deduction can be claimed by the taxpayer.  On the other hand, if the securities decrease in value, the taxpayer's original tax deduction (based on the value of the securities when given to the donor-advised fund) remains valid.

Even though the tax efficiency is the same, there are differences between giving directly to a charity and giving via a donor-advised fund.

* Some charities are not set up to receive gifts of securities.
* The amount that the donor wants to give to the charity may be an awkward or small number of shares (for example, it could be administratively complicated to give five shares each to 20 charities, but it is easy to give 100 shares to the donor-advised fund and then make 20 separate grant recommendations).
* Giving to a donor-advised fund lets the donor take the tax deduction when it is advantageous. For example, a taxpayer can get a tax deduction for a contribution to a donor-advised fund and decide later which charities are the ultimate beneficiaries.
* Some donor-advised funds process gifts to foreign charities.  Direct gifts to foreign charities by individuals are generally not tax deductible.

However, there is a cost to donor-advised funds.  Most donor-advised funds charge an administrative fee (e.g., 1% per year).  This is in addition to management fees that, for example, any mutual funds the donor fund is invested in.
* The donor fund administrator may also charge fees charged for every grant, especially if to a foreign charity.

[[File:Entropa-rectangular.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Entropa'' sculpture on display in the hall of the [[Justus Lipsius building]] in [[Brussels]].]]

'''''Entropa''''' is a [[sculpture]] by [[Czechs|Czech]] artist [[David Černý]]. The project was commissioned by the Czech Republic to mark the occasion of its [[presidency of the Council of the European Union]], and was originally designed as a collaboration for 27 artists and artist groups from all member countries of the [[European Union]]. However, as a [[hoax]], Černý and three of his assistants created a [[satire|satirical]] and controversial piece that depicted pointed stereotypes of the EU member nations. Fake artist profiles were also created by Černý and his accomplices, complete with invented descriptions of their supposed contributions.

The sculpture was unveiled informally on 12 January 2009, followed by its official media launch date three days later. The sculpture was originally on display in the [[Justus Lipsius building]] in [[Brussels]].  Between September 2010 and March 2012, the sculpture was on exhibit at the [[Techmania Science Center]] in [[Plzeň]]. A copy of the sculpture has also been planned for the Nová Scéna cafe in the [[National Theatre (Prague)|National Theatre]] in [[Prague]].&lt;ref name="divad"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/kultura/41687-i-slovaci-kritizuji-entropu-presto-ozdobi-narodni-divadlo/ | title=I Slováci kritizují Entropu, přesto ozdobí Národní divadlo | work=ČT24.cz | date=14 January 2009 | accessdate=14 January 2009 | language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The [[Council of the European Union]] adheres to a rotational presidency system, whereby the governments of member countries exchange leadership every six months. It is customary for the presiding country to place an exhibit in the Justus Lipsius building, with past works avoiding [[controversy]]. For example, France, which had held the presidency before the Czech Republic, simply erected a large balloon in the [[Flag of France|French national colours]] in honor of the tradition.&lt;ref name="provo"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2009/01/11/europe/brussels.php | title=Czech Republic chooses a bit of provocation to herald its EU presidency | work=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=11 January 2009 | accessdate=14 January 2009 | last=Castle | first=Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theme ==
''Entropa'' is an ironic jab at the issue of [[European integration]] and the stereotypes associated with each country within the [[European Union]]. It is subtitled '"Stereotypes are barriers to be demolished", along with the Czech European Union Presidency's motto of "Europe without barriers". According to David Černý, the sculpture's primary artist, ''Entropa'' "lampoons the socially activist art that balances on the verge between would-be controversial attacks on national character and undisturbing decoration of an official space".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7827738.stm | title=Czech EU art stokes controversy | publisher=[[BBC News Online]] | date=14 January 2009 | accessdate=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[The Times Online]]'', Černý stated that the sculpture was influenced by the [[Monty Python]] brand of humour.&lt;ref name="monty"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5518579.ece | title=David Cerny says hoax EU sculpture inspired by Monty Python | work=[[The Times Online]] | date=14 January 2009 | accessdate=14 January 2009 | location=London | first=David | last=Charter}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the launch ceremony, he added [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] and ''[[Les Guignols de l'info]]''{{'}}s portrayal of [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] as other influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/vondra-odhalil-v-bruselu-kontroverzni-plastiku-omluvil-se-urazenym-1ji-/zahranicni.asp?c=A090115_115040_zahranicni_lpo | title=Vondra odhalil v Bruselu kontroverzní plastiku, omluvil se uraženým | work=[[iDnes.cz]] | date=15 January 2009 | accessdate=15 January 2009 | language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is made of [[glass-reinforced plastic]] and the joints of [[steel]].  It covers approximately {{convert|256|m2}}, measuring {{convert|16.4|m}} high and {{convert|16.5|m}} wide.  Three-quarters of the weight comes from the frame, making up a combined total of 8 tonnes.  It resembles the parts of a [[model kit]], containing pieces in the shapes of the 27 [[member states of the EU]]. Each piece has a distinctive theme that portrays stereotypes about the country, some of which are portrayed in a particularly provocative manner. Among the pieces which have attracted the most attention are those of Bulgaria, Denmark, Germany, Poland and Slovakia.

The sculpture was installed between 5 and 11 January 2009 in the presence of David Černý, three assistants, four climbers, two technicians, two cameramen and a representative of the Czech Permanent Representation to the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vedex.cz/realizace/entropa.php?gclid=COfR2qTXpZgCFUoa3godxxX-lw |title=Entropa - Výroba rámu plastiky Davida Černého |publisher=[[VEDeX]] |date=16 January 2009 |accessdate=24 January 2009 |language=cs |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718190032/http://www.vedex.cz/realizace/entropa.php?gclid=COfR2qTXpZgCFUoa3godxxX-lw |archivedate=18 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nations included in the sculpture ===
With no clear indication made by the artist nor by the official presentation, various interpretations of a single country can be drawn, and this list is by no means definite.  Some of the physical pieces differ slightly from the form presented in the official booklet:

* '''Austria''', a known opponent of atomic energy, is depicted as a green field dominated by nuclear power plant [[cooling tower]]s with vapour coming out of them at intervals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://zpravy.ihned.cz/index.php?article[gallery][detail_id]=492030&amp;article[gallery][from]=&amp;article[gallery][id]=338530&amp;article[id]=32782980&amp;p=012000_d#fg | work=Ihned.cz | title=Nastal těžký den v Bruselu.

* '''Belgium''' is presented as a box of half-eaten [[Praline]] chocolates with the pattern of Brussels waffles.
*'''[[Bulgaria]]''' is depicted by a series of connected "Turkish" [[squat toilet]]s with neon lights connecting and illuminating them. This piece of the sculpture was later hidden with fabric.&lt;ref name="inpictures"/&gt;&lt;ref name="german-wave-bulgaria-covered"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,3961199,00.html|title=Czechs Cloak Bulgaria "Toilet" Portrait from Hoax Artwork|author=DFW staff (dfm)|date=20 January 2009|accessdate=20 January 2009|quote=The Czech EU presidency on Tuesday cloaked a segment of a controversial art installation in Brussels that portrays Bulgaria as a psychedelic Turkish squat toilet.|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Cyprus]]''' is cut in half.
* The '''[[Czech Republic]]''''s own piece is an [[LED display]], which flashes controversial quotations by Czech President [[Václav Klaus]].
* '''Denmark''' is depicted as being built out of [[Lego]] bricks, and some claim to see in the depiction a face reminiscent of the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|cartoon controversy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://aktualne.centrum.cz/kultura/umeni/clanek.phtml?id=627065 | work=Centrum.cz | title=Černý v plastice složil Dánům z lega proroka Mohammeda | date=14 January 2009 | language=Czech | accessdate=14 January 2009 | last=Wohlmuth | first=Radek}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the resemblance has been denied by Černý.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7830498.stm | title=Czechs apologise for hoax EU art | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=15 January 2009 | accessdate=15 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Finland''' is depicted as a [[Parquetry|wooden floor]] including a male with a rifle lying down, imagining an [[elephant]],  a [[hippo]] and a [[crocodile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mefeedia.com/entry/entropa-finland-with-elephant-hippo/13450994 | title=Entropa: Finland With Elephant, Hippo | work=[[mefeedia]] | date=15 January 2009 | accessdate=15 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''France''' is draped in a "{{lang|fr|GRÈVE!}}" ("[[Strike action|STRIKE]]!") banner.&lt;ref name="inpictures"/&gt;

* '''Greece''' is depicted as a forest that has been entirely burned, possibly representing the [[2007 Greek forest fires]] or the [[2008 civil unrest in Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Skai TV]], [http://www.skai.gr/master_story.php?id=107392 Καμένη η Ελλάδα σε αμφιλεγόμενο έκθεμα] ''(English Machine translation: [https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=el&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.skai.gr/master_story.php%3Fid%3D107392 Greece burnt in controversial exhibit])''.

* '''Italy''' is depicted as a [[soccer|football]] pitch&lt;ref name="inpictures"/&gt; with several players who appear to be [[Masturbation|masturbating]], possibly indicating what some see as the country's "fetish for football".&lt;ref name="rnw"/&gt;
*'''[[Latvia]]''' is shown as covered with mountains, in contrast to its actual [[Geography of Latvia#Physical environment|flat landscape]].
*'''[[Lithuania]]''' includes a series of dressed ''[[Manneken Pis]]''-style figures urinating, with the streams of urine being illuminated by yellow glass fibres.

* The '''United Kingdom''', known for its [[Euroscepticism]] and relative isolation from Europe, is "included" as a missing piece (an empty space) at the top-left of the sculpture.&lt;ref name="inpictures"/&gt;

== Reaction ==
''Entropa'' has inspired debate in Europe since the day of its first unveiling. Various commentators have noted that this is probably the first such exhibition in the history of art displays on behalf of the rotary Presidency of the EU Council that has been controversial in nature, contrasted by the fact that such pieces usually go by unnoticed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/brunowaterfield/8082531/Europe_needs_the_shocking_Czechs/ | first=Bruno | last=Waterfield | title=Europe needs the 'shocking' Czechs | publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=12 January 2009 | accessdate=14 January 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The work drew what has been described by one reporter as "a never-before-seen crowd."&lt;ref name="rnw"/&gt;  It has been praised by some viewers for being "hilarious" and for inspiring discussion about art, but has angered and offended others.&lt;ref name="rnw"/&gt;

In June 2009, David Černý himself said that he expected completely different reactions than those described below. In his opinion, Bulgaria doesn't even make it to the top three of the most provocative countries caricatured by ''Entropa''. The most provocative country is Poland, with the reference to gays. It is followed by the UK (missing) and Slovakia that, according to Mr Černý, is a bubble restricted by Hungary.

=== Political controversy ===

[[File:Entropa-Bulgaria-covered.jpg|right|thumb|The sculpture of Bulgaria on 22 January 2009 covered by black fabric]]

On 13 January 2009, the day after the exhibit was informally unveiled, [[Bulgaria]]'s ambassador to the EU registered the country's protest with the [[European Commission]], and sent a formal protest note to the Czech government. Bulgaria's depiction in the sculpture, as a series of [[squat toilet]]s, is one of the most provocative, and after the informal unveiling of ''Entropa'', the Bulgarian government demanded that the sculpture be taken down before its official launching.&lt;ref name="the times"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5517736.ece | accessdate=15 January 2009 | work=[[The Times]] | last=Hines | first=Nico |author2=David Charter | title=Hoax EU sculpture by David Cerny sparks diplomatic spat | date=14 January 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This action was never taken, but after continuing complaints, the Bulgarian depiction was covered with black fabric on 20 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/cesko-vyhovelo-bulharum-z-bruselske-plastiky-zmizel-turecky-zachod-1ia-/zahranicni.asp?c=A090120_073855_zahranicni_jte | title=Česko vyhovělo Bulharům, z bruselské plastiky zmizel turecký záchod | language=Czech| accessdate=20 January 2009&lt;!--, 11:46 CET --&gt;| work=Idnes.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals outside the government, as well, expressed outrage about the portrayal:
{{quote|It is one thing portraying, say, France as a country on strike, but quite another to show my homeland as a toilet. That is downright wrong.|Georgi Gotev, Bulgarian journalist&lt;ref name="bulga"/&gt;}}
Bulgarian news portal News.bg commented that the country's deputy was "obviously interpreting [the exhibit's] idea as an insult attempt."&lt;ref name="bulga"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://international.ibox.bg/news/id_1869166053 | title=Bulgaria is a "Turkish Toilet" in the Entropa Art Installation in Brussels | work=[[News.bg]] | date=13 January 2009 | accessdate=14 January 2009 | last=Stoykova | first=Diana}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of non-government organizations, including Polish Indeks 73, were opposed to covering part of the work and initiated online petitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indeks73.pl/en_,aktualnosci,_,79,_,575.php |title=David Černý's Entropa censored.

Jan Vytopil, the man in charge of cultural events during the Czech EU Presidency, has defended the exhibit, arguing that the presence of a "squat toilet Bulgaria" in the presence of the other patently absurd depictions made it clear that the piece seeks to demolish stereotypes rather than cause controversy. Czech Deputy Prime Minister [[Alexandr Vondra]] also frequently stressed that the government committee which authorized the piece wanted to avoid [[censorship]]:

On 14 January 2009, the [[Slovak National Party]] called on Foreign Affairs Minister [[Ján Kubiš]] to demand the removal of the sculpture, calling it an offence to the Slovak nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slovakia protests its "sausage map" in official EU artwork|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605104351/http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/1232046128.0/|archivedate=5 June 2011 |url=http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/1232046128.0/|work=EU Business|date=15 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sme.sk/c/4262486/sns-ziada-kubisa-aby-protestoval-proti-salame-s-madarskou-trikolorou.html | title=SNS žiada Kubiša, aby protestoval proti saláme s maďarskou trikolórou | language=Slovak | accessdate=14 January 2009&lt;!--, 11:46 CET --&gt;| work=[[SME (newspaper)|SME]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 January 2009, Kubiš complied and lodged a formal protest, but did not demand the removal of the sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/index_view.php?id=355071|title= Po Bulharsku protestuje proti Entropě i Slovensko|accessdate=15 January 2009 |work= České noviny news portal |publisher= Neris |date= 15 January 2009 | language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the controversial nature of the portrayals of other countries, Czech diplomats expected protests from other countries as well. However, {{as of|2009|01|14}} these had yet to materialize. In fact, the public in Poland appeared to be largely in favour of Poland's portrayal, with 64% considering it "spot on" and only 13% thinking it "an insult to Polish people", according to an online poll by news portal [[TVN24]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tvn24.pl/1001670,1,1,czy-uwazasz--ze-rzezba-dobrze-oddaje-stereotypy-dotyczace-polski,sondy.html | title=Czy uważasz, że rzeźba dobrze oddaje stereotypy dotyczące Polski? | language=Polish | accessdate=14 January 2009&lt;!--, 10:46 CET --&gt;| work=[[TVN 24]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ole Molesby, the Danish Ambassador to the Czech Republic, stated that he did not expect the Mohammed caricature protests to begin anew, and that Denmark did not intend to complain. Černý denied that the similarity was intentional.&lt;ref name="danes"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://aktualne.centrum.cz/zahranici/evropa/clanek.phtml?id=627106 | title=Dánové v Černého díle vidí Mohameda.

=== Authorship controversy ===
On 13 January 2009, the authorship of ''Entropa'' came into question. Officially, the artwork was to have been an international collaboration between David Černý and artists from the other 26 EU countries. However, on that day, Alexandr Vondra announced the work was probably created by a smaller group of people, explaining that Černý did not inform him about this until the evening before. The original news article in ''[[Lidové noviny]]'' pointed out that some of the artists' names did not seem to exist in their countries' citizen records and had no Internet footprint.&lt;ref name="nepra"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lidovky.cz/plastika-v-bruselu-muze-byt-cela-dilem-cerneho-f4r-/ln_eu.asp?c=A090113_125326_ln_eu_ter | title=Na Černého díle nepracovalo 27 lidí, řekl Vondra LN | work=lidovky.cz | accessdate=14 January 2009 | date=13 January 2009 | language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt; Černý himself admitted on 13 January that the artists' names had been fabricated.&lt;ref name="the times"/&gt;

The official booklet provided summaries of past expositions for most of the alleged authors, some of which matched those of known artists. For example, Austria's "Sabrina Unterberger" had a résumé that apparently belonged to Ernst Logar.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Many of these "artists" had their own websites (designed by Tomáš Pospiszyl, [[Krištof Kintera]] and Libor Svoboda), but the contact information listed was false (other than the e-mail addresses, which were functional).{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

''Lidové noviny'' originally listed Belgium, Germany, Greece, Ireland, and the UK as countries for which fictitious artists' identities were given. These specific claims were later retracted and replaced by general charges that some of the names in the booklet are non-existent, their résumés erroneous, or that the artists denied knowing David Černý or having cooperated with him.

On the evening of 13 January 2009, Černý officially admitted that the piece was actually created entirely by him and two friends, and that all the officially supplied artists' identities had been fabricated.&lt;ref name="the times"/&gt; In a prepared statement, Černý offered an apology to [[Prime Minister of the Czech Republic|Prime Minister]] [[Mirek Topolánek]], Deputy Prime Minister Alexandr Vondra, and the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Czech Republic)|Czech Minister of Foreign Affairs]] [[Karel Schwarzenberg]] "and their offices" for deceiving them, stating he did not want them to be responsible for his fabulations.&lt;ref name="omluv"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/domov/index_view.php?id=354661 | title=David Černý se omluvil vládě za mystifikaci se svým dílem | work=ceskenoviny.cz | accessdate=14 January 2009 | date=13 January 2009 | language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement went on to point out: "We knew the truth would come out. But before that we wanted to find out if Europe is able to laugh at itself."

The names of Černý's collaborators were given as Tomáš Pospiszyl and Krištof Kintera.&lt;ref name="spust"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/svet/index_view.php?id=354933 | title=V případě protestů proti Entropě Černý sporné makety odstraní | work=[[České noviny]] | date=15 January 2009 | accessdate=15 January 2009 | language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors maintained that a larger international team of people was involved in the project's execution. They explained that they originally wanted to contact artists from all 27 member countries of the EU, but failed due to limited time and financing.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Alexandr Vondra responded with an official statement expressing his disappointment and stressed that Černý would bear responsibility for deceiving the government.&lt;ref name="vondra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eu2009.cz/en/news-and-documents/news/statement-by-alexandr-vondra-concerning-new-information-abou-5844/index.html/ |title=Statement by Alexandr Vondra concerning new information about Entropa |work=eu2009.cz |date=13 January 2009 |accessdate=14 January 2009 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the sculpture's potential for controversy, the point that each country's piece was designed by an artist from that country was strongly stressed by the Czech government. According to [[Lidové noviny]], Czech Prime Minister Alexandr Vondra remarked: "The fact remains that we have provided a platform for free artistic expression and that is how ''Entropa'' must be viewed. But, had I known the circumstances were different than we had thought for a year and a half, I would not have authorized it."&lt;ref name="nepra"/&gt;  Vondra attempted to distance the Czech government from Černý's work early on, saying,&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a piece of art&amp;mdash;nothing else... If Europe is not strong enough to look at this, it would be a tragedy. It is Europe through the eyes of 27 artists. It is not Europe through the eyes of the Czech presidency.&lt;ref name="provo"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Fraud accusation ===
The sculpture reportedly cost 12 million [[Czech koruna|CZK]] to make, of which 10 million was contributed by [[New World Resources]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] mining company which owns [[OKD]] in the Czech Republic, and 2 million CZK was paid by the Czech government, which has subsequently leased the work for an additional 1.2 million CZK until the end of June. After the fabrication came to light, Černý was accused of [[Fraud|misappropriating]] state funds. He responded that the money was not used at all, since the artists knew they would deviate from the stated project, and would be returned.&lt;ref name="spust"/&gt;

=== Response by authors ===
Černý originally stated that he meant for the sculpture to be amusing, saying, "Irony is about making fun. It is not meant to offend anybody",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/01/12/us-eu-mosaic-idUSTRE50B58320090112 | title=Czech EU mosaic pokes fun at national stereotypes | agency=Reuters| date=12 January 2009 | accessdate=14 January 2009 | last=Smith | first=Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later issuing an official statement saying, "We wanted to see if Europe is able to laugh at itself."&lt;ref name="omluv"/&gt; On 15 January, Černý reflected on the hostile reception of ''Entropa'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;I certainly don't feel like a winner. That's how I'd feel if there were a few shocked Brusselian bureaucrats walking around the piece, shaking their heads, thinking about what those Czechs have done here. We expected this to be treated as a joke, a [[happening]], a nice installation, nothing else. That we are already discussing the removal of some parts doesn't seem like a tremendous success to me. I'd be much happier if it remained whole.&lt;ref name="spust"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The authors defended their choice to use false names in creating the sculpture by stating the deception was part of the art:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Grotesque exaggeration and mystification is a hallmark of Czech culture, and creating false identities is one of the strategies of [[contemporary art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jRL-oFxUXrw4-RKvh3b8_2dm6aMg | title=Czech artist admits deception in EU art exhibit | agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] | date=13 January 2009 | accessdate=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Černý has also said that making this sculpture in this way was "more fun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lidovky.cz/ln_zahranici.asp?c=A090114_203103_ln_eu_val | title=Černý pro LN: Vláda si dílo neobjednala | work=[[Lidové noviny]] | date=14 January 2009 | accessdate=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, however, the artists apologized for the deception, saying, "We apologize to Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek, Deputy Prime Minister Alexandr Vondra, Minister Karel Schwarzenberg and their offices for not informing them about the true state of things and thus deceiving them."&lt;ref name="omluv"/&gt;  Krištof Kintera, one of the true co-authors of the sculpture, said in an interview that the mystification was supposed to last longer, but that it was untenable—both ethically, as the artists didn't want to cause more trouble for Czech diplomacy, and practically, as they couldn't keep answering e-mails using the fabricated artists' identities.

Kintera also commented that the sculpture revealed a divide between [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Eastern Europe]]: "We didn't want to defame anyone; advanced European democracies are used to many things, but the East still strives to promote itself in a positive light, so it's not as well attuned to this."&lt;ref name="kintera"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hn.ihned.cz/c4-10065240-32799250-500000_d-entropa-je-pitoma-ale-take-krotka | title=Krištof Kintera: "Entropa je pitomá, ale také krotká" | work=[[Hospodářské noviny]] | date=15 January 2009 | accessdate=15 January 2009 | language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fate of the sculpture ==
After the true authorship of the sculpture came to light, Alexandr Vondra stated its continued display was under review because Černý had violated the government's specifications of the project, which, in line with Černý's original description, called for an international collaboration of artists. On 14 January 2009, the official ''Entropa'' presentation page was withdrawn from the Czech presidency's website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eux.tv/2009/01/14/czech-eu-presidency-removes-entropa-brochure-from-its-website/ Czech EU Presidency removes ‘Entropa’ brochure from its website] at EUX.TV&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the sculpture was ceremonially launched on 15 January 2009. Alexandr Vondra again defended the piece, saying, "we consider ''Entropa'' to be art, nothing more and nothing else."&lt;ref name="spust2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/kultura/41768-alexandr-vondra-v-bruselu-entropa-je-umelecke-dilo-nic-vic-nic-min/ | title=Alexandr Vondra v Bruselu: Entropa je umělecké dílo, nic víc, nic míň | work=[[ČT24]] | date=15 January 2009 | accessdate=15 January 2009 | language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ceremony, David Černý again apologized to the Czech government and expressed regret that the sculpture was considered offensive. He said the offending pieces would be removed if officials cannot be persuaded about the authors' intentions.&lt;ref name="spust"/&gt;

== Removal ==
On 23 April 2009, Černý's intention to remove the sculpture prematurely on 10 May was published, which he presented as a protest against the way in which [[Mirek Topolánek's Second Cabinet|Topolánek's government]] had been deposed and against the prepared [[Jan Fischer's Cabinet|Fischer's cabinet]], which was eventually installed on 8 May.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/eu/ceske_predsednictvi/zpravy/cerny-chce-entropu-odstranit-z-bruselu-uz-10-kvetna/372755 Černý chce Entropu odstranit z Bruselu už 10. května], České noviny, 23. 4. 2009, ČTK {{cs icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://zpravy.idnes.cz/cerny-odstrani-entropu-drive-nelibi-se-mu-fischerova-vlada-pax-/domaci.asp?c=A090423_094010_domaci_bar Černý odstraní Entropu dříve, nelíbí se mu Fischerova vláda], iDnes.cz, 23. 4. 2009, bar (Barbora Říhová) {{cs icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://zpravy.idnes.cz/brusel-si-na-entropu-zvykl-nechte-nam-ji-az-do-cervna-zadoni-p4o-/zahranicni.asp?c=A090423_155112_zahranicni_jw Brusel si na Entropu zvykl.

The removal of the sculpture began on 11 May. Černý himself was not present, although he had earlier suggested the contrary. A crew he sent there dismantled the sculpture and on Thursday, 14 May loaded its parts into three trucks, which had to come one by one because of limitations of the Justus Lipsius building. Afterwards, the pieces were transported by road to Prague.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zpravy.idnes.cz/v-bruselu-zacala-predcasna-demontaz-kontroverzni-plastiky-entropa-11c-/domaci.asp?c=A090507_163402_domaci_bar V Bruselu začala předčasná demontáž kontroverzní plastiky Entropa], iDnes.cz, 11. 5. 2009, bar (Barbora Říhová), lpo (Lenka Poláková)&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpture was set up again in the Centre of Contemporary Art DOX in Prague-[[Holešovice]] and inaugurated on 11 June 2009, in presence of guests, including former Czech president [[Václav Havel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://zpravy.idnes.cz/kontroverzni-entropa-je-v-praze-udelal-jsem-ji-ja-s-paroubkem-rekl-havel-1an-/domaci.aspx?c=A090611_202441_praha_jba Kontroverzní Entropa je v Praze.

''Entropa'' was on display in the [[Techmania Science Center]] in [[Plzeň]] as part of an [[European Union|EU]] exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lidovky.cz/provokativni-entropa-davida-cerneho-se-prestehovala-do-plzne-puv-/ln_kultura.asp?c=A100906_131024_ln_kultura_mev Lidovky.cz]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Exclusive federal powers''' are powers within a [[federalism|federal system of government]] that each constituent political unit (such as a state or province) is absolutely or conditionally prohibited from exercising.&lt;ref name=Scardino&gt;Scardino, Frank.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=MLhxnmmtivwC&amp;pg=PA31 The Complete Idiot's Guide to U.S. Government and Politics]'', p. 31 (Penguin 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, either a constituent political unit may never exercise these powers, or may only do so with the consent of the federal government.

These powers are contrasted with [[concurrent powers]], which are shared by both the federal government and each constituent political unit.&lt;ref name=Scardino /&gt;

[[Image:1890 Gaiety Girls.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Gaiety Girls in ''[[The Geisha]]'', 1896; [[Blanche Massey]] center]]
'''Gaiety Girls''' were the chorus girls in [[Edwardian musical comedies]], beginning in the 1890s at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London]], in the shows produced by [[George Edwardes]].  The popularity of this genre of [[musical theatre]] depended, in part, on the beautiful dancing corps of "Gaiety Girls" appearing onstage in bathing attire and in the latest fashions.  The 1890s Gaiety Girls were respectable, elegant young ladies, unlike the corseted actresses from London's earlier musical [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchiveTextF/CissyFitzgerald.html Article about the Gaiety Girls in ''Pick-Me-Up'', London, 24 November 1894, p. 116], accessed March 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, even the stars of these musical comedies were referred to as Gaiety Girls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/live/gaiety.asp Description of Gaiety Girls exhibition (National Portrait Gallery)], accessed March 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

===Fashion icons===
An American newspaper reviewing ''[[A Gaiety Girl]]'' in 1894 explained the importance of the Gaiety Girls: "The piece is a mixture of pretty girls, English humor, singing, dancing and bathing machines and dresses of the English fashion. The dancing is a special feature of the performance, English burlesques giving much more attention to that feature of their attractiveness than the American entertainments of the same grade do."&lt;ref&gt;''The Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', Sunday, 23 December 1894, p.9a.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the best-known London couturiers designed costumes for stage productions  by the 1890s.  The illustrated periodicals were eager to publish photographs of the actresses in the latest stage hits, and so the theatre became an excellent way for clothiers to publicise their latest fashions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/d/designing-stage-costumes/ "Designing Stage Costumes"], Victoria and Albert Museum, accessed March 10, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:GaietyGirlDudleyHardy.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Poster for ''[[A Gaiety Girl]]'']]
Gaiety girls were polite, well-behaved young women.  They became a popular attraction and a symbol of ideal womanhood.  Edwardes arranged with Romano's Restaurant, on [[Strand, London|the Strand]], for his girls to dine there at half-price.  It was good exposure for the girls and made Romano's the centre of London's night-life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Gaiety.htm Gaiety Theatre ''Cuttings'' (Arthur Lloyd site)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080104132022/http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Gaiety.htm |date=January 4, 2008 }} accessed 01 Mar 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the Gaiety Girls, such as [[Marie Studholme]], [[Ellaline Terriss]], [[Lily Elsie]], [[Cicely Courtneidge]], [[Gladys Cooper]], [[Phyllis Dare]], [[Zena Dare]], [[Mabel Love]], [[Evelyn Laye]], [[Jennie McNulty]], [[Gaby Deslys]], [[Camille Clifford]], [[Gabrielle Ray]], [[Sylvia Grey]] and [[Constance Collier]], later enjoyed substantial acting careers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/live/gaietyexh.asp Profiles and photos of many of the best known Gaiety Girls (National Portrait Gallery], accessed March 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  One Gaiety Girl, [[Mabel Russell]], became a [[Member of Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Craig |first=F.

===Stage Door Johnnies; marriage into the upper class===

The young ladies appearing in Edwardes's shows became so popular that wealthy gentlemen, termed "Stage Door Johnnies", would wait outside the stage door hoping to escort them to dinner.  In some cases, a marriage into society and even the nobility resulted.  For example, May Gates, a chorus girl in ''[[The Beauty of Bath]]'', married a nobleman, Baron Von Ditton, of Norway.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Dramatic Mirror'', 18 July 1908, p.3b&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, Sylvia Lillian Storey (1890-1947) another chorister in the same show, married [[William Poulett, 7th Earl Poulett]].&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Dramatic Mirror'', 12 September 1908, p. 2b&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9902E5D61631E233A25755C0A96F9C946997D6CF ''NY Times'' article about the marriage and other similar matches. 6 September, 1908, p.

First, she became Lady Victor Paget (marrying in 1913 and divorcing in 1921) and then the Countess of Drogheda (marrying the 10th Earl in 1922).  The potential for such relationships was an underlying theme of many of the stories of [[P. G. Wodehouse]], particularly those set at [[Blandings Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Richard Usborne|Usborne, Richard]].

After Connie Gilchrist and Rosie Boote had started the fashion a score of [[George Edwardes|the Guv'nor's]] budding stars left him to marry peers or men of title while other Gaiety Girls settled for a banker or a stockbroker.

{{IPA notice}}
In common parlance,{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} "'''guttural R'''" is the phenomenon whereby a [[rhotic consonant]] (an "R-like" sound) is produced in the back of the [[vocal tract]] (usually [[uvular consonant|with the uvula]]) rather than in the front portion thereof and thus as a [[guttural]] consonant. Speakers of languages with guttural R typically regard guttural and [[coronal consonant|coronal]] rhotics to be alternative pronunciations of the same [[phoneme]], despite [[articulatory phonetics|articulatory]] differences. Similar consonants are found in other parts of the world, but they often have little to no cultural association or interchangeability with coronal rhotics (such as {{IPAblink|r}}, {{IPAblink|ɾ}}, and {{IPAblink|ɹ}}) and [[#Rhotic-agnostic_guttural_consonants_written_as_rhotics|are (perhaps) not rhotics at all]].

The guttural realization of a lone [[rhotic consonant]] is typical in most of what is now [[France]], French speaking [[Belgium]], most of [[Germany]], large parts of the [[Netherlands]], [[Denmark]], the southern parts of [[Sweden]] and southwestern parts of [[Norway]]; it is also frequent in [[Flanders]], and among all French- and some German speakers in [[Switzerland]] and also in eastern [[Austria]], including [[Vienna]]. German speakers who use the frontal-R now mainly live in the [[Alps]] or close by.

Outside of central [[Europe]], it also occurs as the normal pronunciation of one of two rhotic phonemes (usually replacing an older [[alveolar trill]]) in most of [[Portugal]], various parts of [[Brazil]], among minorities of other Portuguese-speaking regions, and in parts of [[Puerto Rico]], [[Cuba]] and the [[Dominican Republic]].

==Romance languages==

===French===

The French rhotic has a wide range of realizations: both the [[Voiced uvular fricative|voiced uvular fricative or approximant]] {{IPA|[ʁ]}} and the [[voiceless uvular fricative]] {{IPA|[χ]}}, the [[uvular trill]] {{IPA|[ʀ]}}, the [[alveolar trill]] {{IPA|[r]}}, and the [[alveolar tap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}}. These are all recognized as the [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/r/}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Fougeron|Smith|1993|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the trills and the tap are considered dialectal. {{IPA|[ʀ]}} was once typical of a [[working class]] [[Paris]]ian accent, and {{IPA|[r]}} is sometimes found in southern France, as well as (increasingly less) in North America.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Today in northern [[France]], {{IPA|/r/}} is commonly pronounced as a [[voiced uvular fricative]] {{IPA|[ʁ]}}, and [[voiceless uvular fricative|voiceless]] {{IPA|[χ]}} after a voiceless consonant by [[Assimilation (phonetics)|assimilation]]. {{IPA|[ʁ]}} is also the most common pronunciation in the French media. In much of southern France, this guttural R has replaced the traditional [[alveolar trill]] {{IPA|[r]}}, which can now only be heard among the oldest speakers.

It is not known when the guttural rhotic entered the French language, but it may have become commonplace in the mid or late 18th century.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} [[Molière]]'s ''[[Le Bourgeois gentilhomme]]'', published in 1670, has a professor describe the sound of {{IPA|/r/}} as an alveolar trill (Act II, Scene IV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Molière|title=Le bourgeois gentilhomme|year=1670|publisher=Imprimerie nationale|quote=Et l’R, en portant le bout de la langue jusqu’au haut du palais, de sorte qu’étant frôlée par l’air qui sort avec force, elle lui cède, et revient toujours au même endroit, faisant une manière de tremblement : Rra. [And the R, placing the tip of the tongue to the height of the palate so that, when it is grazed by air leaving the mouth with force, it [the tip of the tongue] falls down and always comes back to the same place, making a kind trembling.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Quebec French]], speakers from rural areas and older generations traditionally use an alveolar trill, as was the pronunciation that was likely retained after the [[French colonization of the Americas|French colonists]] in [[Canada]] were isolated from France. However, most urban Quebeckers and the French-language [[broadcast media]] have adopted the modern guttural rhotic pronunciation of [[Paris]], perhaps as the result of influence by modern French media from France.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Generally speaking, classical choral and operatic French pronunciation requires the use of an alveolar trill when singing, since an alveolar trill is easier to project than any guttural sound, be it a uvular trill or a uvular fricative.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===Portuguese===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Portuguese language]] --&gt;

Standard versions of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] have two rhotic phonemes, which contrast only between vowels. In older Portuguese, these were the [[alveolar flap]] {{IPA|/ɾ/}} (written {{angbr|r}}) and the [[alveolar trill]] {{IPA|/r/}} (written {{angbr|rr}}). In other positions, only {{angbr|r}} is written in Modern Portuguese, but it can stand for either sound, depending on the exact position. The distribution of these sounds is mostly the same as in other Iberian languages, i.e.:
*{{angbr|r}} represents a trill when written {{angbr|rr}} between vowels; at the beginning of a word; or following {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/z/}}, or {{IPA|/ʒ/}}.  Examples: ''ca'''rr'''o'', '''''r'''ua'', ''hon'''r'''ar'', ''Is'''r'''ael''.
*{{angbr|r}} represents a flap elsewhere, i.e. following a vowel or following any consonant other than {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/z/}}, or {{IPA|/ʒ/}}.  Examples: ''ca'''r'''o'', ''quat'''r'''o'', ''qua'''r'''to'', ''ma'''r'''''.

In the 19th century, the  [[uvular trill]] {{IPA|[ʀ]}} penetrated the upper classes in the region of Lisbon in Portugal as the realization of the alveolar trill. By the 20th century, it had replaced the alveolar trill in most of the country's urban areas and started to give way to the [[voiced uvular fricative]] {{IPA|[ʁ]}}. Many [[Northern Portuguese|northern dialects]], like [[Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro|Transmontano]], [[Douro Litoral|Portuese]] (which is heard in parts of [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]]), [[Minho Province|Minhoto]], and much of [[Beira Litoral Province|Beirão]] retain the alveolar trill, but other dialects of the inner center of Portugal have a guttural R with an uncertain origin. In the rural regions, the alveolar trill is still present, but because most of the country's population currently lives in or near the cities and owing to the mass media,the guttural {{IPA|[ʀ]}} is now dominant in Portugal.

A common realization of the word-initial {{IPA|/ʀ/}} in the Lisbon accent is a voiced uvular trill fricative {{IPAblink|ʀ̝}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Grønnum|2005|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dialect of the fishermen of [[Setúbal]] used the [[voiced uvular fricative]] {{IPA|[ʁ]}} for all instances of "r" — word start, intervocalic, postconsonantal and syllable ending. This same pronunciation is attested in people with [[Rhotacism (speech impediment)|rhotacism]], in a new developing variety of young people in São Tomean Portuguese (Bouchard, 2017), and in non-native speakers of [[France|French]] or German origin.

In Africa, the classical alveolar trill is mostly still dominant, due to separate development from European Portuguese.

In Brazil, the normal pronunciation of {{angle bracket|rr}} is voiceless, either as a [[voiceless velar fricative]] {{IPA|[x]}}, [[voiceless uvular fricative]] {{IPA|[χ]}} or a [[voiceless glottal fricative]] {{IPA|[h]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Mateus, Maria Helena &amp; d'Andrade, Ernesto (2000) ''The Phonology of Portuguese'' {{ISBN|0-19-823581-X}} [http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-823581-X.pdf (Excerpt from Google Books)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628065105/http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-823581-X.pdf |date=2007-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In many dialects, this voiceless sound not only replaces all occurrences of the traditional trill, but is also used for all {{angle bracket|r}} that is ''not'' followed by a vowel (i.e. when at the end of a syllable, which uses a flap in other dialects). The resulting distribution can be described as:
*A flap {{IPA|[ɾ]}} only for single {{angle bracket|r}} and only when it occurs either between vowels or between a preceding consonant (other than {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/z/}}, or {{IPA|/ʒ/}}) and a following vowel. Examples: ''ca'''r'''o'', ''quat'''r'''o''.
*A voiceless fricative {{IPA|[x]}} {{IPA|[χ]}} or {{IPA|[h]}} everywhere else: when written {{angle bracket|rr}}; at the beginning of a word; at the end of a word; before a consonant; after {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/z/}}, or {{IPA|/ʒ/}}. Examples: ''ca'''rr'''o'', '''''r'''ua'', ''hon'''r'''ar'', ''Is'''r'''ael'', ''qua'''r'''to'', ''ma'''r'''''.

In the three southernmost states, however, the alveolar trill {{IPA|[r]}} remains frequent, and the distribution of trill and flap is as in Portugal. Some speakers use a guttural fricative instead of a trill, like the majority of Brazilians, but continue to use the flap {{IPA|[ɾ]}} before consonants (e.g. in ''qua'''r'''to'') and between vowels (e.g. in caro). Among others, this includes many speakers in the city of [[São Paulo]] and some neighboring cities, though an [[alveolar approximant]] {{IPA|[ɹ]}} is also common, not only in the city, but the approximant is the dominant articulation in rural parts of [[São Paulo state]], the most populous state in Brazil. The [[Caipira dialect|''caipira'' dialect]] has the [[alveolar approximant]] {{IPA|[ɹ]}} in the same position.

In areas where {{angle bracket|r}} at the end of a word would be a voiceless fricative, the tendency in colloquial speech is to pronounce this sound very lightly, or omit it entirely. Some speakers may omit it entirely in verb infinitives (''amar'' "to love", ''comer'' "to eat", ''dormir'' "to sleep") but pronounce it lightly in some other words ending in {{angle bracket|r}} (''mar'' "sea", ''mulher'' "woman", ''amor'' "love"). This tendency also occurs in some African countries; but speakers in Rio often resist the tendency, pronouncing a strong fricative {{IPA|[x]}} or {{IPA|[χ]}} at the end of such words.

The voiceless fricative may be partly or fully voiced if it occurs directly before a voiced sound, especially in its weakest form of {{IPA|[h]}}, which is normally voiced to {{IPA|[ɦ]}}. For example, a speaker whose {{angbr|rr}} sounds like {{IPA|[h]}} will often pronounce ''surdo'' "deaf" as {{IPA|[ˈsuɦdu]}} or even {{IPA|[ˈsuɦ&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;du]}}, with a very slight epenthetic vowel that mimics the preceding vowel.

===Spanish===

In most [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking territories and regions, guttural or uvular realizations of {{IPA|/r/}} are considered a [[speech defect]]. Generally the single flap {{IPA|[ɾ]}}, spelled ''r'' as in ''cara'', undergoes no defective pronunciations, but the alveolar trill in ''rata'' or ''perro'' is one of the last sounds learned by children and uvularization is likely among individuals who fail to achieve the alveolar articulation. This said, back variants for {{IPA|/r/}} ({{IPA|[ʀ]}}, {{IPA|[x]}} or {{IPA|[χ]}}) are widespread in rural Puerto Rican Spanish and in the variety of Ponce,&lt;ref&gt;Navarro-Tomás, T. (1948). El español en Puerto Rico. Contribución a la geografía lingüística latinoamericana. Río Piedras: Editorial de la Universidad de Puerto Rico, p.91-93.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas they are heavily stigmatized in the variety of the capital.&lt;ref&gt;López-Morales, H. (1983). Estratificación social del español de San Juan de Puerto Rico. México: UNAM.&lt;/ref&gt; To a lesser extent, velar variants of /r/ are found in some rural Cuban (Yatera, Guantánamo Province)&lt;ref&gt;López-Morales, H. 1992. El español del Caribe. Madrid: MAPFRE, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; and Dominican vernaculars (El Cibao, eastern rural regions of the country)&lt;ref&gt;Jiménez-Sabater, M.1984. Más datos sobre el español de la República Dominicana. Santo Domingo: Universidad Autónoma de Santo Domingo, p.87.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[#Basque|Basque]]-speaking areas of Spain, the uvular articulation{{which|date=December 2015}} has a higher prevalence among bilinguals than among Spanish monolinguals.&lt;ref name="Basque"/&gt;

===Italian===
Guttural realization of {{IPA|/r/}} is mostly considered a speech defect in [[Italian language|Italian]] (cf. [[:it:Rotacismo (medicina)|rotacismo]]), but the so-called ''r moscia'' which is sometimes uvular is quite common in some northern areas, such as [[Piedmont]], [[Lombardy]] and [[Emilia Romagna]].&lt;ref&gt;Romano A. (2013). “A preliminary contribution to the study of phonetic variation of /r/ in Italian and Italo-romance”. In: L. Spreafico &amp; A. Vietti (eds.), Rhotics. New data and perspectives Bolzano/Bozen: BU Press, 209-225 [http://www.unibz.it/it/library/Documents/bupress/publications/fulltext/9788860460554.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201015208/http://www.unibz.it/it/library/Documents/bupress/publications/fulltext/9788860460554.pdf |date=2016-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occitan===

The [[uvular trill]] {{IPA|[ʀ]}} and the [[Voiced uvular fricative|voiced uvular fricative or approximant]] {{IPA|[ʁ]}} are common in some Occitan dialects ([[Provence]], [[Auvergne]], [[Alps]], [[Limousin]]). The dialects from Languedoc and Gascony also know these realizations, but it is generally considered to be an influence from French and therefore rejected from the standard versions of these dialects.

==Breton==
The [[Breton language]], spoken in [[Brittany]] (France), is a [[Celtic language]] rather than a [[Romance language]], but is heavily influenced by French. It retains an [[alveolar trill]] in some dialects, like in [[Finistère|Léon]] and [[Morbihan]], but most dialects now have the same rhotic as French, {{IPA|[ʁ]}}.

==Continental West Germanic==

The uvular rhotic is most common in [[Central German]] dialects and in [[Standard German]]. Many [[Low Franconian]], [[Low Saxon languages|Low Saxon]], and [[Upper German]] varieties have also adopted it with others maintaining the [[alveolar trill]] ({{IPA|[r]}}). The development of uvular rhotics in these regions is not entirely understood, but a common theory is that these languages have done so because of [[France|French]] influence, though the reason for uvular rhotics in modern European French itself is not well understood (see above).

The [[Frisian languages]] usually retain an alveolar rhotic.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===Dutch and Afrikaans===

In modern [[Dutch language|Dutch]], quite a few different rhotic sounds are used. In [[Flanders]], the usual rhotic is an [[alveolar trill]], but the uvular rhotic{{which|date=December 2015}} does occur, mostly in the province of [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]], in [[Ghent]] and in [[Brussels]]. In the [[Netherlands]], the uvular rhotic is the dominant rhotic in the southern provinces of [[North Brabant|Noord-Brabant]] and [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], having become so in the early twentieth century. In the rest of the country, the situation is more complicated. The uvular rhotic is  dominant, in the western agglomeration [[Randstad]], including cities like [[Rotterdam]], [[The Hague]] and [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] (the dialect of [[Amsterdam]] usually has an alveolar rhotic though, but the uvular is becoming increasingly more common). The uvular rhotic is also used in some major cities outside of the Randstad area, such as [[Zwolle]], [[Almelo]] and [[Leeuwarden]]. Outside of these uvular rhotic core areas, the [[alveolar trill]] is common. People learning Dutch as a foreign language also tend to use the alveolar trill because it contrasts better with the [[voiceless velar fricative]] {{IPA|/x/}} in Dutch{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}. The [[Afrikaans language]] of [[South Africa]] also uses an alveolar trill for its rhotic, except in the non-urban rural regions around [[Cape Town]], chiefly in the town of Malmesbury, where it is uvular (called a brei). Some Afrikaans speakers from other areas also brei, either as a result of ancestry from the Malmesbury region or from difficulty pronouncing the alveolar trill.

===Standard German===

Although the first standardized pronunciation dictionary by [[Theodor Siebs]] prescribed an alveolar pronunciation, most varieties of [[German language|Standard German]] are spoken with a uvular rhotic, now usually a fricative or approximant {{IPA|[ʁ]}}, rather than {{IPA|[ʀ]}}. The alveolar pronunciation {{IPA|[{{IPA link|r}} ~ {{IPA link|ɾ}}]}} is used in some standard German varieties of Germany, [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]]. It remains more common in non-standard varieties in many parts of the language area. Chiefly in [[Central German]], however, even the broadest rural dialects use a uvular R.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Regardless of whether a uvular or an alveolar pronunciation is used, German post-vocalic "r" is typically vocalized to {{IPA|[ɐ̯]}}, {{IPA|[ə̯]}}, or a simple lengthening {{IPA|[ː]}}. This is most common in the [[syllable coda]], as in [[non-rhotic|non-rhotic English]], but often occurs before an underlying [[schwa]], too. Vocalization of "r" is rare only in [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] and [[Swabian German|Swabian]] German.

===Yiddish===

The upper/lower distinction{{clarify|date=December 2015}} also historically influenced the development of upper and lower dialects of [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], the historic vernacular language of [[Ashkenazi]] [[Jew]]s. As these Jews migrated to Eastern Europe (and later America etc.), they brought their particular pronunciations with them.

==Insular West Germanic==

===English===
Historically, English also had an alveolar trill [r] for the letter R, but it was replaced by an alveolar approximant [ɹ].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Speakers of the traditional English dialect of [[Northumberland]] and northern [[County Durham]] use a uvular rhotic, known as the "[[Northumbrian Burr]]".&lt;ref&gt;Wells, J.C. 1982. Accents of English 2: The British Isles. Cambridge University Press. Page 368&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sounds.bl.uk/View.aspx?item=021M-C0908X0041XX-0800V1.xml Survey of English Dialects, Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sounds.bl.uk/View.aspx?item=021M-C0908X0002XX-0500V1.xml Survey of English Dialects, Ebchester, County Durham]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is no longer used by most contemporary speakers, who generally realize {{IPA|/r/}} as an [[alveolar and postalveolar approximants|alveolar approximant]], {{IPA|[ɹʷ]}}, in common with other varieties spoken in the [[English-speaking world]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sounds.bl.uk/View.aspx?item=021M-C0900X11059X-0600V1.xml Millennium Memory Bank, Alnwick, Northumberland]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sounds.bl.uk/View.aspx?item=021M-C0900X01567X-1000V1.xml Millennium Memory Bank, Butterknowle, County Durham]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hiberno-English]] of northeastern [[Leinster]] in [[Ireland]] also uses a uvular {{IPA|[ʁ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Irish English: history and present-day forms |last= Hickey |first= Raymond |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= 978-0-521-85299-9|page=320 |pages= |url= https://books.google.com/?id=p3vDuPNG7nUC&amp;lpg=PA320&amp;pg=PA320#v=onepage | accessdate= 16 December 2016 |date=8 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==North Germanic==
[[alveolar consonant|Alveolar]] rhotics predominate in northern [[Scandinavia]]. Where they occur, they affect the succeeding alveolars, turning the clusters {{IPA|/rs/}} and {{IPA|/rt/}}, {{IPA|/rd/}}, {{IPA|/rn/}}, {{IPA|/rl/}} [[retroflex]]: {{IPA|[ʂ ʈ ɖ ɳ ɭ]}}. Thus the Norwegian word "norsk" is pronounced {{IPA|[nɔʂk]}} by speakers with an alveolar flap. This effect is rare in the speech of those using a uvular R ({{IPA|[nɔʁsk]}}).

===Danish and Swedish===
The rhotic used in [[Denmark]] is a [[voiced uvular approximant]], and the nearby Swedish ex-Danish regions of [[Scania]], [[Blekinge]], southern [[Halland]] as well as a large part of [[Småland]] and on the [[Öland]] island, use a [[uvular trill]] or a [[Voiced uvular fricative|uvular fricative]].

To some extent in [[Östergötland]] and still quite commonly in [[Västergötland]], a mixture of guttural and rolling rhotic consonants{{which|date=December 2015}} is used, with the pronunciation depending on the position in the word, the stress of the syllable and in some varieties depending on whether the consonant is [[gemination|geminated]]. The pronunciation remains if a word that is pronounced with a particular rhotic consonant is put into a compound word in a position where that realization would not otherwise occur if it were part of the same stem as the preceding sound. However, in Östergötland the pronunciation tends to gravitate more towards [w] and in Västergötland the realization is commonly voiced.
Common from the time of [[Gustav III]] (Swedish king 1771-1792), who was much inspired by [[France|French]] culture and language, was the use of guttural R in the nobility and in the upper classes of [[Stockholm]]. This phenomenon vanished in the 1900s. The last well-known non-Southerner who spoke with a guttural R, and didn't have a speech defect, was [[Anders Gernandt (equestrian)|Anders Gernandt]], a popular [[equitation]] commentator on TV.

===Norwegian===
Most of Norway uses an [[alveolar flap]], but about one third of the inhabitants of Norway are now using the uvular rhotic.{{which|date=December 2015}} In the western and southern part of [[South Norway]], however, the uvular rhotic is still spreading. The origin was the city of [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]].&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, J.K. and Trudgill, P. (1998): Dialectology. Cambridge University Press, p. 173f.&lt;/ref&gt; Because [[retroflex consonant]]s are mutations of {{IPA|[ɾ]}} and other alveolar or dental consonants, the use of a uvular rhotic means an absence of most retroflex consonants.

===Icelandic===
While the use of an alveolar trill or flap is generalized among speakers of Icelandic, a uvular rhotic{{which|date=December 2015}} is a fairly common pronunciation variant in the language, although it is usually frowned upon as defective pronunciation and compared to [[stammering]] and other similar speech disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Morgunblaðið|date=6 September 1978|page=4|location=Reykjavik|language=Icelandic|title=Rætt um talgalla|trans-title=On defective pronunciation|url=http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?issId=117230&amp;pageId=1503374|accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slavic languages==
In [[Slavic languages]], the [[alveolar trill]] predominates, with the use of guttural rhotics seen as defective pronunciation.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} An exception are the languages of the [[Sorbian language|Sorbian]] minority in [[Saxony]], eastern [[Germany]], which are typically spoken with a [[uvular trill]] due to [[German language|German]] influence. The uvular rhotic may also be found in a small minority in [[Silesia]] and other German-influenced regions of [[Poland]] and also [[Slovenia]], but is overall quite rare even in these regions. It can also be perceived as an ethnic marker of Jewishness, particularly in [[Russian language|Russian]] where [[Ashkenazi Jews|Eastern European Jews]] often carried the uvular rhotic from their native [[Yiddish]] into their pronunciation of [[Russian language|Russian]].

==Semitic languages==

===Hebrew===

In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], the classical pronunciation associated with the consonant {{lang|he|ר}} ''{{transl|he|rêš}}'' was tapped {{IPAblink|ɾ}}, and was [[grammar|grammatically]] treated as an [[gemination|ungeminable]] phoneme of the language. In most dialects of Hebrew among the [[Jew]]ish [[diaspora]], it remained a tap {{IPAblink|ɾ}} or a trill {{IPAblink|r}}. However, in some Ashkenazi dialects as preserved among Jews in northern Europe it was a uvular rhotic, either a trill {{IPAblink|ʀ}} or a fricative {{IPAblink|ʁ}}. This was because many (but not all) native dialects of [[Yiddish]] were spoken that way, and their liturgical Hebrew carried the same pronunciation. Some [[Iraqi Jews]] also pronounce ''{{transl|he|rêš}}'' as a guttural {{IPAblink|ʀ}}, reflecting [[Baghdad Arabic (Jewish)|their dialect]] of Arabic.

An apparently unrelated uvular rhotic is believed to have appeared in the [[Tiberian vocalization]] of Hebrew, where it is believed to have coexisted with additional non-guttural, emphatic articulations of {{IPA|/r/}} depending on circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Khan, Geoffrey (1995), The Pronunciation of reš in the Tiberian Tradition of Biblical Hebrew, in: Hebrew Union College Annual, Vol.66, p.67-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yiddish influence====
Although an Ashkenazi Jew in the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]] based his Standard Hebrew on [[Sephardi Hebrew]], originally spoken in [[Spain]], and therefore recommended an alveolar {{IPAblink|r}}. However, just like him, the first waves of Jews to resettle in the [[Holy Land]] were Ashkenazi, and Standard Hebrew would come to be spoken with their native pronunciation. Consequently, by now nearly all Israeli Jews pronounce the consonant ר ''rêš'' as a unique uvular approximant {{IPA|[[ʁ]]}}, specifically [ʁ̞].,&lt;ref name="Zuckermann"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zuckermann|first=Ghil'ad|authorlink=Ghil'ad Zuckermann|title=[[Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew]]|year=2003|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|location=UK|isbn=978-1403917232}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|261}} which also exists in Yiddish.&lt;ref name="Zuckermann"/&gt;{{rp|262}}

The alveolar rhotic is still used today in some formal occasions, just as radio news broadcasts, and in the past was widely used in television and singing.

====Israeli Hebrew====

Many Jewish immigrants to Israel spoke a [[varieties of Arabic|variety of Arabic]] in their countries of origin and pronounced the Hebrew rhotic as an alveolar tap {{IPAblink|ɾ}}, similar to Arabic {{lang|ar|[[ر]]}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|rāʾ}}''. Gradually, many of them began pronouncing their Hebrew rhotic as a voiced uvular fricative {{IPAblink|ʁ}}, a sound similar or (depending on the Arabic dialect) identical to Arabic {{lang|ar|[[غ]]}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ġayn}}''. However, in modern [[Sephardic Jews|Sephardic]] and [[Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahi]] poetry and folk music an alveolar rhotic continues{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} to be used.

===Arabic===

While most [[varieties of Arabic|dialects of Arabic]] retain the classical pronunciation of {{lang|ar|[[ر]]}} {{transl|ar|DIN|rāʾ}} as an [[alveolar trill]] {{IPAblink|r}} or [[alveolar tap|tap]] {{IPAblink|ɾ}}, a few dialects use a [[uvular trill]] {{IPAblink|ʀ}}. These include:

* The Tigris dialects, a group among the [[Qǝltu dialects]] in [[Iraq]], for instance in [[Mosul]]&lt;ref&gt;Otto Jastrow (2007), Iraq, in: The Encyclopedia of Arabic Language and Linguistics, Vol. 2, p.414-416&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Baghdad Arabic (Jewish)|Jewish]] and [[Christian]] dialects in [[Baghdad]]
* The [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Jewish]] dialect in [[Algiers]]
* The dialect of [[Jijel]] in [[Algeria]]&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Marçais (1956), Le Parler Arabe de Djidjelli (Nord Constantinois, Algérie), Paris, 16-17; cf. also Marcel Cohen (1912), Le Parler Arabe des Juifs d’Alger (= Collection linguistique 4), Paris, p.27&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some Muslim-urban dialects of [[Morocco]] (e.g. in [[Fez, Morocco|Fes]])&lt;ref&gt;Georges-Séraphin Colin (1987), Morocco (The Arabic Dialects), in: E. J. Brill’s First Encyclopaedia of Islam: 1913-1936, Vol. 6, Leiden, 599&lt;/ref&gt;

The uvular /r/ was attested already in vernacular Arabic of the [[Abbasid period]]. Nowadays Christian Arabic of Baghdad exhibits also an alveolar trill in very few lexemes, but primarily used in loanwords from [[Modern Standard Arabic]]. Native words with an alveolar trill are rare.&lt;ref&gt;Farida Abu-Haidar (1991), Christian Arabic of Baghdad (= Semitica Viva 7), Wiesbaden, p.9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Mosul-Arabic has commonly the voiced alveolar trill in numbers instead of a uvular fricative (e.g. arbaʕiːn "forty").&lt;ref&gt;Otto Jastrow (1979), Zur arabischen Mundart von Mosul, in: Zeitschrift für arabische Linguistik, Vol. 2., p.38.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this guttural rhotic is rare in Arabic, uvular and velar sounds are common in this language. The uvular/velar fricative {{IPAblink|ʁ}}~{{IPAblink|ɣ}} is a common standard pronunciation of the letter {{lang|ar|[[غ]]}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ġayn}}'', and the uvular plosive {{IPAblink|q}} is a standard pronunciation of the letter ''{{transl|ar|DIN|qāf}}'' {{lang|ar|[[ق]]}}.

===Ethiopic===

In [[Amharic]] the alveolar trill {{IPAblink|r}} is the usual pronunciation of /r/. But there are also assertions that around [[Addis Abeba]] some dialects exhibit a uvular r. Note that this information is not very supported in Semitic Studies.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Ullendorf (1955), The Semitic Languages of Ethiopia, London, p.124-125.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in Gafat (extinct since the 1950s) a uvular fricative or trill might have existed.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Lipiński (1997), Semitic Languages: Outline of a Comparative Grammar (= Orientalia Lovaniensa Analecta 80), Leuven, p.132-133.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Akkadian===

The majority of assyriologists deem an alveolar trill or tap the most likely pronunciation. However, there are several indications to a velar or uvular fricative {{IPAblink|ɣ}}~{{IPAblink|ʁ}} particularly supported by [[John Huehnergard]].&lt;ref&gt;John Huehnergard and Christopher Woods (2004), Akkadian and Eblaite, in: Roger D. Woodard Roger (ed.), The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the World’s Ancient Languages, Cambridge, p.230-231.&lt;/ref&gt; The main arguments constitute alternations with the voiceless uvular fricative /ḫ/ (e.g. ''ruššû/ḫuššû'' "red"; ''barmātu'' "multicolored" (fem. pl.), the spelling ''ba-aḫ-ma-a-tù'' is attested).&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram von Soden (1995), Grundriß der akkadischen Grammatik (= Analecta Orientalia 33), Rom, p.44 (§ 35); see also Benno Landsberger (1964), Einige unerkannt gebliebene oder verkannte Nomina des Akkadischen, in: Die Welt des Orients 3/1, p.54.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides /r/ shows certain phonological parallelisms with /ḫ/ and other gutturals (especially the glottal stop {{IPAblink|ʔ}}).&lt;ref&gt;John Huehnergard (2013), Akkadian e and Semitic Root Integrity, in: Babel und Bibel 7: Annual of Ancient Near Eastern, Old Testament and Semitic Studies (= Orientalia et Classica 47), p.457 (note 45); see also Edward L. Greenstein (1984), The Phonology of Akkadian Syllable Structure, in: Afroasiatic Linguistics 9/1, p.30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Austronesian==

===Malay dialects===
Guttural R exist among several Malay dialects. While [[standard Malay]] commonly uses coronal r ({{IPAlink|ɹ}},{{IPAlink|r}},{{IPAlink|ɾ}}), the guttural fricative ({{IPAlink|ɣ}}~{{IPAlink|ʁ}}) are more prominently used in many dialects in [[Peninsular Malaysia]] and [[East Malaysia]] as well as some parts in [[Sumatra]] and [[East Kalimantan]]. These dialects include:

* [[Pahang Malay]]
* [[Kedah Malay]]
* [[Kelantan-Pattani Malay]]
* [[Negeri Sembilan Malay language|Negeri Sembilan Malay]]
* [[Sarawak Malay]]
* [[Terengganu Malay]]
* [[Perak Malay]]
* [[Aceh Tamiang Regency|Tamiang Malay]]
* [[Pontianak Malay]]
* [[Musi language|Palembang Malay]]

~ Perak Malay and Kedah Malay are the most notable.

These dialects mainly uses guttural fricative ({{IPAlink|ɣ}}~{{IPAlink|ʁ}}) on both /r/ and /gh/. [[Standard Malay]] includes both coronal r ({{IPAlink|ɹ}},{{IPAlink|r}},{{IPAlink|ɾ}}) and voiced guttural fricative /gh/ ({{IPAlink|ɣ}}~{{IPAlink|ʁ}}) as two different phonemes. To denotes the guttural r in the dialects, letter "r" often replaced by "gh" or "q" in informal writings {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}. [[Standard Malay]] words with [[voiced velar fricative]] ({{IPAlink|ɣ}}), such as ''loghat'' (dialect) and ''ghaib'' (invisible, mystical) are mostly [[Arabic]] loanwords spelled with letter [[غ]].

===Other Austronesian languages===
Other Austronesian languages with similar features are:

* [[Acehnese language|Acehnese]]
* [[Cham language|Cham]]
* [[Minangkabau language|Minangkabau]] (closely related to Malay that it might be dialects of the same language)
* [[Lampung language|Lampungese]]
* [[Paiwan language#Phonology|Southern Paiwan]]

==Other language families==

===Basque===
[[Standard Basque]] uses a trill for {{IPA|/r/}} (written as ''r-'', ''-rr-'', ''-r''), but most speakers of the [[Lapurdian]] and [[Low Navarrese]] dialects use a [[voiced uvular fricative]] as in French. In the [[Southern Basque Country]], the uvular articulation is seen as a [[speech defect]], but the prevalence is higher among bilinguals than among Spanish monolinguals. Recently, young speakers of Lapurdian and Low Navarrese are uvularizing the [[Flap consonant|tap]] (''-r-'') as well, thus neutralizing both rhotics.&lt;ref name="Basque"&gt;''Grammar of Basque'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Kss999lxKm0C&amp;pg=PA30 page 30], [[José Ignacio Hualde]], [[Jon Ortiz De Urbina]], [[Walter de Gruyter]], 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Khmer===
Whereas standard [[Khmer language|Khmer]] uses an alveolar trill for {{IPA|/r/}}, the colloquial [[Phnom Penh]] dialect uses a uvular pronunciation for the phoneme, which may be elided and leave behind a residual tonal or register contrast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Linguistic Diversity and National Unity: Language Ecology in Thailand |author= William Allen A. Smalley|year=1994|publisher=University of Chicago|isbn=0-226-76288-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bantu===
[[Sotho language|Sesotho]] originally used an alveolar trill {{IPA|/r/}}, which has shifted to uvular {{IPA|/ʀ/}} in modern times.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Rhotic-agnostic guttural consonants written as rhotics==
There are languages where certain indigenous guttural consonants came to be written with means used in other languages to represent rhotics, thereby giving the superficial appearance of a guttural R that may have never actually functioned as a true [[rhotic consonant]].

===Inuit languages===
The [[Inuit languages]] [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]] and [[Inuktitut]] either [[Latin alphabet|orthographize]] or [[Inuktitut syllabics|transliterate]] their [[voiced consonant|voiced]] uvular [[obstruent consonant|obstruent]] as {{angle bracket|r}}. In Greenlandic, this phoneme is {{IPA|[ʁ]}}, while in Inuktitut it is {{IPA|[ɢ]}}. This spelling was convenient because these languages do not have non-[[lateral consonant|lateral]] [[liquid consonant]]s, and guttural realizations of {{angbr|r}} are common in various languages, particularly the colonial languages [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[French language|French]]. But the [[Alaska]]n [[Inupiat language]] writes its {{IPA|[ʁ]}} phoneme instead as {{angbr|ġ}}, reserving {{angbr|r}} for its [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] {{IPA|[ʐ]}} phoneme, which Greenlandic and Inuktitut do not have.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2489">'''Heinrich Joseph Wetzer''' ([[Kirchhain|Anzefahr]], [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] (or Hesse-Cassel), 19 March 1801 &amp;ndash; [[Freiburg]], [[Baden]], 5 November 1853) was a German Orientalist. His greatest achievement was the part he took in the production of the first edition of the ''[[Kirchenlexikon]]'' for which he drew up the ''Nomenclator'' and which he edited with [[Benedict Welte]].

He studied theology and Oriental languages at the universities of [[University of Marburg|Marburg]] (1820-3), [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]] (1823), and [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]] (1824), and graduated as doctor of theology and philosophy at Freiburg in 1824. He continued the study of Arabic, Persian and Syriac for eighteen months at the [[University of Paris]], under the Orientalists [[De Sacy]] and [[Etienne Marc Quatremère]]. At the royal library of Paris he discovered an Arabian manuscript containing the history of the [[Coptic Christians]] in Egypt from their origin to the fourteenth century, which he afterwards edited in Arabic and Latin: "Taki-eddini Makrizii historia Coptorum Christianorum in Ægypto" (Sulzbach, 1828).

In 1828 he became professor-extraordinary, and in 1830 professor-ordinary, of Oriental philology at the [[University of Freiburg]]. His interest in preserving the Catholic character of Freiburg, which had been founded and endowed as a Catholic university, incurred for him the odium of the Protestant professors, who, in the majority from 1846, excluded him from all academic positions. He was appointed chief librarian of the university library in 1850.

He composed anonymously the little work "Die Universitat Freiburg nach ihrem Ursprunge..." (Freiburg, 1844). He had also begun a history of the controversy between [[Arianism]] and the Catholic Church in the fourth century, but only a small part of it was completed and published as "Restitutio verae chronologiae rerum ex controversiis Arianis, inde ab anno 325 usque ad annum 350 exortarum..." (Frankfort, 1827).

'''Humfrey Wanley''' (21 March 1672 – 6 July 1726) was an English librarian, [[palaeographer]] and scholar of [[Old English]], employed by manuscript collectors such as [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert]] and [[Edward Harley, 2nd Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Edward Harley]]. He was the first keeper of the Harleian Library,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Michael|year=1982|title=Humfrey Wanley on How to Run a Scholarly Library|journal=[[The Library Quarterly]]|volume=52|issue=2|pages=145–55|doi=10.1086/601202}}&lt;/ref&gt; now the [[Harleian Collection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/manuscripts/harleymss/harleymss.html|title=History of the Harley Library|work=Harley Manuscripts|publisher=[[British Library]]|accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life== 
[[File:Humfrey Wanley by Thomas Hill, 1722.jpg|thumb|right|Humfrey Wanley, by Thomas Hill, 1722]]
He was the son of [[Nathaniel Wanley]], born on 21 March 1672 at the Vicarage House adjoining Jesus Hall, [[Coventry]].  Starting out as a draper in his home town, he soon tired of this and moved to [[Oxford University]] to study in 1695 thanks to his patron [[William Lloyd (bishop of Worcester)|William Lloyd]], bishop of Coventry and Lichfield. There he worked as an assistant at the [[Bodleian Library]] until 1700, when he moved to London, where he gained temporary jobs as secretary to the [[SPCK]] and assistant to [[Hans Sloane]] (Sloane was secretary to the [[Royal Society]], and Wanley was elected a Fellow of it in 1706), before landing a settled job with the Harleys which he held to the end of his life.

Wanley, together with [[John Bagford]] and [[John Talman]], was one of three 'founder members' of the reconstituted [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]], which first met at the Bear Tavern on the Strand on 5 December 1707.&lt;ref&gt;Sweet, R. (2004) ''Antiquaries: the discovery of the past in eighteenth-century Britain''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Wanley married twice. He died of [[dropsy]] on 6 July 1726 and was buried at [[St Marylebone Church]].

==Importance==
Wanley's contributed to the scholarship of [[Old English literature]]. His 1705 catalog of Anglo-Saxon manuscripts, ''Antiquae literaturae septentrionalis liber alter. Seu Humphredi Wanleii ... cum totius thesauri linguarum septentrionalium sex indicibus'', was of paramount importance in the field. According to [[Neil Ripley Ker]], Wanley was a "great paleographer....His catalogue of Anglo-Saxon manuscripts is a book which scholars will continue to use, or neglect at their peril."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ker|first=Neil Ripley|authorlink=Neil Ripley Ker|title=Catalogue of manuscripts containing Anglo-Saxon|year=1957|publisher=Clarendon|location=Oxford|page=xiii}}. The quote is also given by Michael Murphy, "Humfrey Wanley on How to Run a Scholarly Library."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Greek myth (personified)}}

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Hypate''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɪ|p|ə|t|iː}} (Ὑπάτη) was one of the three [[Muses]] of the [[lyre]] who were worshipped at [[Delphi]], where the [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo]] and the [[Oracle]] were located. Her name was also the highest of the seven notes of the lyre. Her sisters who were worshipped along with her were [[Nete (mythology)|Nete]] and [[Mese (mythology)|Mese]]. These three muses were comparable to the original three, [[Aoide]], [[Melete]], and [[Mneme]]. Alternatively, they were [[Cephisso]], [[Apollonis]], and [[Borysthenis]], which portrayed them as the daughters of [[Apollo]].

==Place name==

The name of the ancient city Hypate (now [[Ypati]], a village in [[Phthiotis]] west of [[Lamia (city)|Lamia]]) is unrelated to this Muse. It has a different etymology meaning "the height of Oeta (Oiti)".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3508">The '''Institute of Archaeology''' is an [[academic department]] of the [[University of Oxford]] devoted to the teaching and research of [[archaeology]]. Together with the [[Research Laboratory for Archaeology and the History of Art]], it forms part of the [[School of Archaeology, University of Oxford|School of Archaeology]]. Its current director is [[Chris Gosden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/institute.html|title=Institute of Archaeology|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=School of Archaeology, University of Oxford|language=en|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The origins of the Institute go back to 1946, when [[Christopher Hawkes]] was appointed Oxford's first Professor of European Prehistory and [[Ian Richmond]] the first Professor of the Archaeology of the Roman Empire. Teaching facilities were set up for them at 36 Beaumont Street, which grew into the Institute. It was formerly founded in 1961, with Hawkes as its first director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/history.html|title=History of the School of Archaeology|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=School of Archaeology, University of Oxford|language=en|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/AW1.html|title=Prof Andrew Wilson|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=School of Archaeology, University of Oxford|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richmond and Hawkes were succeeded by [[Sheppard Frere]] and [[Barry Cunliffe]], in respectively 1965 and 1972, who oversaw and expansion of the Institute's research and fieldwork facilities in the 1970s. Starting in 1992, Oxford introduced an bachelor's degree in anthropology and archaeology and the Institute became the focal point for undergraduate teaching in archaeology.

'''James McBride''' (born September 11, 1957)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/11728.James_McBride Good Reads]&lt;/ref&gt; is an American writer and musician. He is the recipient of the 2013 [[National Book Award]] for fiction for his novel ''[[The Good Lord Bird]]''.

==Early life==
McBride's father, Rev. Andrew D. McBride (August 8, 1911 – April 5, 1957) was [[African-American]]; he died of cancer at the age of 45. His mother, Ruchel Dwajra Zylska (name later changed to Rachel Deborah Shilsky, and later changed again to Ruth McBride Jordan; April 1, 1921 – January 9, 2010), was a [[Jewish]] immigrant from Poland. James was raised in [[Brooklyn]]'s [[Red Hook, Brooklyn|Red Hook]] [[housing project]]s and was the last child Ruth had from her first marriage, the last child of Rev. Andrew McBride, and the eighth of 12 children.

McBride states:
{{quote|I'm proud of my Jewish history....Technically I guess you could say I'm Jewish since my mother was Jewish...but she converted (to Christianity). So the question is for theologians to answer. ... I just get up in the morning happy to be living."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sherwin|first=Elisabeth|title=One man's unique story about poverty, race, family|date=February 9, 1997|url=http://dcn.davis.ca.us/go/gizmo/mcbride.html|accessdate=March 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

His memoir, ''[[The Color of Water|The Color of Water: A Black Man's Tribute to His White Mother]]'' (1995), describes his family history and his relationship with his mother.&lt;ref name="Ruth McBride Jordan, Subject of Son’s Book ‘Color of Water,’ Dies at 88"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/16/arts/16jordan.html|publisher=''New York Times''|title=Ruth McBride Jordan, Subject of Son's Book 'Color of Water,' Dies at 88|date=January 2010|accessdate=January 28, 2010 | first=Dennis | last=Hevesi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of his older brothers, Dennis and Billy, graduated with doctorates in medicine, but that did not appeal to James McBride. He earned an undergraduate degree in music composition from [[Oberlin College]] in 1979, after which he earned a master's degree in journalism from [[Columbia University]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Career==

===Journalism===
As a journalist, McBride worked on the staffs of many well-known publications, including ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the ''[[Wilmington News Journal]]'', and ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine. Additionally, he has written pieces for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, ''[[Us (magazine)|Us]]'' magazine, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', ''[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]'' magazine, ''[[The New York Times]]'', and others.  McBride is a charter member of the Clint Harding Network, a group of well-known journalists, writers, and musicians who periodically have appeared live on a [[Missouri]] radio program for the last two decades.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Books and screenplays===
McBride is well known for his 1995 memoir, the bestselling book ''[[The Color of Water]]'', which describes his life growing up in a large, poor American-African family that was led by his white Jewish mother.  McBride's mother was strict and the daughter of an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[rabbi]]. During her first marriage to Rev. Andrew McBride, she converted to Christianity and became a devout Christian. The memoir spent over two years on ''[[The New York Times]]'' bestseller list, and has become an American classic. It is read in high schools and universities across America, has been translated into 16 languages, and sold more than 2.5&amp;nbsp;million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libwww.freelibrary.org/onebook/obop04/char04.cfm|title=Home &gt; Programs and Services &gt; One Book, One Philadelphia &gt; The Color of Water}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, he published a novel, ''Miracle at St. Anna'', drawing on the history of the overwhelmingly African-American [[92nd Infantry Division (United States)|92nd Infantry Division]] in the Italian campaign from mid-1944 to April 1945. The book was adapted into the movie ''[[Miracle at St. Anna]]'', directed by [[Spike Lee]], released on September 26, 2008.

In 2005, McBride published the first volume of ''The Process'', a CD-based documentary about life as lived by low-profile [[jazz]] musicians.

His 2008 novel, ''Song Yet Sung'', is about an enslaved woman who has dreams about the future, and a wide array of freed black people, enslaved people, and whites whose lives come together in the odyssey that surrounds the last weeks of this woman's life. [[Harriet Tubman]] served as an inspiration for the book, and it provides a fictional depiction of a code of communication that enslaved people used to help runaways attain freedom. The book, based on real-life events that occurred on Maryland's Eastern Shore, also featured the notorious criminal [[Patty Cannon]] as a villain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/02/books/review/Bell-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=July 3, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=February 3, 2008|title=Prophetic Dreams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, McBride co-wrote and co-produced ''[[Red Hook Summer]]'' (2012) with Spike Lee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aalbc.com/authors/jamesmcbride.htm|title=James McBride, Author and Musician}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, McBride co-authored ''[[Hard Listening]]'' (2013) with the rest of the Rock Bottom Remainders (published by [[Coliloquy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rockbottomremainders.com/pages/hard-listening.html|title=Hard Listening}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, ''[[The Good Lord Bird]]'', a comedy novel, was released by Riverhead Books. The work details the life of notorious abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]. For this book, McBride won the 2013 [[National Book Award]] for fiction.&lt;ref name=nbf&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 National Book Award Winner, fiction|url=http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2013_f_mcbride.html|website=National Book Foundation|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 22, 2016, President [[Barack Obama]] awarded McBride the 2015 [[National Humanities Medal]] "for humanizing the complexities of discussing race in America. Through writings about his own uniquely American story, and his works of fiction informed by our shared history, his moving stories of love display the character of the American family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=At White House, A Golden Moment For America's Great Artists And Patrons|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/22/495011305/at-white-house-a-golden-moment-for-americas-great-artists-and-patrons|publisher=NPR|accessdate=September 22, 2016|date=September 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saxophonist and composer===
McBride is the tenor saxophonist for the [[Rock Bottom Remainders]], a group of best-selling authors who are lousy musicians. "Hopefully," McBride says, "the group has retired for good." He also toured as a saxophonist with jazz legend [[Little Jimmy Scott]] and has his own band that plays an eclectic blend of music.

He has written songs for [[Anita Baker]], [[Grover Washington Jr.]], [[Pura Fé]], and [[Gary Burton]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://people.brandeis.edu/~teuber/colorofwater.html Brandeis.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907080349/http://people.brandeis.edu/~teuber/colorofwater.html |date=September 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McBride composed the theme music for the Clint Harding Network, [[Jonathan Demme]]'s New Orleans documentary ''Right to Return'', and the Off-Broadway musical ''Bobos'', written by playwright Ed Shockley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carlozo|first=Louis|title=My other passion / JAMES McBRIDE|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2008-02-26/features/0802220485_1_james-mcbride-music-passion|accessdate=July 3, 2013|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=February 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McBride was awarded the American Music Festival's [[Stephen Sondheim]] Award in 1993, the American Arts and Letters [[Richard Rodgers]] Award in 1996, and the inaugural [[ASCAP Richard Rodgers Horizons Award]] in 1996.&lt;ref name=rockbottombio&gt;{{cite web|title=James McBride (bio)|url=http://www.rockbottomremainders.com/pages/bios/james.html|website=Rock Bottom Remainders|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
McBride is currently a Distinguished Writer-in-Residence at [[New York University]]. He has three children and lives between New York City and [[Lambertville, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/25/books/james-mcbride-on-his-novel-the-good-lord-bird.html?hpw&amp;rref=books&amp;_r=0 Julie Bosman, "Traveling With John Brown Along the Road to Literary Celebrity"], ''The New York Times'', November 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean-Marie Klinkenberg'''  (born 8 October 1944) is a Belgian linguist and semiotician, professor at the State University of [[Liège]], born in Verviers ([[Belgium]]) in 1944. Member of the interdisciplinary [[Groupe µ]]. President of the [[visual semiotics|International Association for visual Semiotics]].

== Biography ==

Jean-Marie Klinkenberg, born in 1944 in [[Verviers]] ([[Belgium]]), received his Masters (1967) and his Doctorate (1971) in Romance Philology at the State University of [[Liège]]. He teaches language studies at the [[University of Liège]], focusing on [[rhetoric]] and [[semiotics]]. He also teaches French-language literature (particularly Belgian and Québécois).

His scientific activities focus on two areas: linguistics/semiotics and French-speaking cultures. In the first area, he made his mark in the late 1960s by revitalizing the field of rhetoric as a member of the interdisciplinary team known as the [[Groupe µ|µ Group]]. More recently, he has helped to steer semiotics in a social, cognitivist direction. His writings on semiotics and rhetoric have been translated into 15 or more languages.

In the second field, he has modernized the study of the arts in Belgium by casting them in a social and institutional light, an approach that can be readily transferred to the other French-speaking cultures he has studied (such as [[Quebec]]'s) and by establishing inter-university research programs. He founded and chairs Belgium's Centre d’Études des Lettres Francophones.

He is president of the International Association for [[visual semiotics]].

He is a member of the "Ordre des francophones d'Amérique" ([[Quebec]]) and [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres|Commandeur des Arts et Lettres]] ([[France]]).

Member of the "[[Académie royale de Belgique]]" (Royal Academy of [[Belgium]]).

'''Kairos''' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:καιρός#Ancient Greek|καιρός]]}}) is an [[Ancient Greek]] word meaning the right, critical, or opportune moment.&lt;ref&gt;Liddell and Scott, Greek-English Lexicon.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ancient Greeks had two words for [[time]]: [[chronos]] ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:χρόνος#Ancient Greek|χρόνος]]}}) and kairos. The former refers to [[chronology|chronological]] or sequential [[time]], while the latter signifies a proper or opportune time for action. While chronos is quantitative, kairos has a qualitative, permanent nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkairo%2Fs1 |title=(Dictionary Entry) |work=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon |accessdate=2015-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kairos'' also means ''weather'' in [[Modern Greek]]. The plural, καιροί (''kairoi'' (Ancient and Modern Greek)) means ''the times''. Kairos is a term, idea, and practice that has been applied in several fields including classical rhetoric, modern rhetoric, digital media, Christian theology, and science.

==Origins==
In [[Richard Broxton Onians|Onians']] 1951 etymological studies of the word, he traces the primary root back to the ancient Greek association with both [[archery]] and [[weaving]]. In archery, kairos denotes the moment in which an arrow may be fired with sufficient force to penetrate a target. In weaving, kairos denotes the moment in which the [[Shuttle (weaving)|shuttle]] could be passed through threads on the [[loom]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson,Hunter W. (2005) "Forecasting Opportunity: Kairos, Production, and Writing, p.4. University Press of America: Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

In the literature of the classical period, writers and orators used kairos to specify moments when the opportune action was made, often through metaphors involving archery and one’s ability to aim and fire at the exact right time on-target. For example, in [[The Suppliants (Euripides)|The Suppliants]], a drama written by [[Euripides]], [[Adrastus]] describes the ability to influence and change another person’s mind by “aiming their bow beyond the kairos.”

Kairos is also an alternate spelling of the minor Greek deity Caerus, the god of luck and opportunity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Gary|date=2012|title=Electronic Kairos|url=https://umaryland-on-worldcat-org.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/atoztitles/link?genre=article&amp;atitle=Electronic%20Kairos.&amp;title=At%20the%20Interface%20/%20Probing%20the%20Boundaries&amp;issn=15707113&amp;isbn=&amp;volume=83&amp;issue=&amp;date=20120901&amp;aulast=Thompson%2C%20Gary&amp;spage=3&amp;pages=3-13&amp;sid=EBSCO:Communication%20%26%20Mass%20Media%20Complete|journal=At the Interface / Probing the Boundaries|volume=83|pages=3–13|via=MLA International Bibliography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In classical rhetoric==
In [[rhetoric]], ''kairos'' is "a passing instant when an opening appears which must be driven through with force if success is to be achieved."&lt;ref&gt;E. C. White, ''Kaironomia'' p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Kairos was central to the [[Sophists]], who stressed the rhetor's ability to adapt to and take advantage of changing, contingent circumstances. In ''Panathenaicus'', [[Isocrates]] writes that educated people are those “who manage well the circumstances which they encounter day by day, and who possess a judgment which is accurate in meeting occasions as they arise and rarely misses the expedient course of action".

Kairos is also very important in [[Aristotle]]'s scheme of rhetoric. Kairos is, for Aristotle, the time and space context in which the [[Proof (truth)|proof]] will be delivered. Kairos stands alongside other contextual elements of rhetoric: ''The Audience'', which is the psychological and emotional makeup of those who will receive the proof; and ''To Prepon'', which is the style with which the orator clothes the proof.

In Ancient Greece, "kairos" was utilized by both of the two main schools of thought in the field of rhetoric. The competing schools were that of the [[Sophists]], and that of their opposition, led by individuals such as Aristotle and [[Plato]]. Sophism approached rhetoric as an art form. Members of the school would travel around Greece teaching citizens about the art of rhetoric and successful discourse. In his article "Toward a Sophistic Definition of Rhetoric", [[John Poulakos]] defines rhetoric from a Sophistic perspective as follows: "Rhetoric is the art which seeks to capture in opportune moments that which is appropriate and attempts to suggest that which is possible."&lt;ref name="Poulakos 1983 35–48"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poulakos|first=John|title=Toward a Sophistic Definition of Rhetoric|journal=Philosophy and Rhetoric|year=1983|volume=16|issue=1|pages=35–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle and Plato, on the other hand, viewed Sophistic rhetoric as a tool used to manipulate others, and criticized those who taught it. 
 
Kairos fits into the Sophistic scheme of rhetoric in conjunction with the ideas of prepon and dynaton. These two terms combined with kairos are their keys to successful rhetoric. As stated by Poulakos, Prepon deals with the notion that "what is said must conform to both audience and occasion."&lt;ref name="Poulakos 1983 35–48"/&gt; Dynaton has to do with the idea of the possible, or what the speaker is attempting to convince the audience of. Kairos in the Sophistic context is based on the thought that speech must happen at a certain time in order for it to be most effective. If rhetoric is to be meaningful and successful, it must be presented at the right moment, or else it will not have the same impact on the members of the audience. 
 
Aristotle and his followers also discuss the importance of kairos in their teachings. In his ''Rhetoric'', one of the ways that Aristotle uses the idea of kairos is in reference to the specificity of each rhetorical situation. Aristotle believed that each rhetorical situation was different, and therefore different rhetorical devices needed to be applied at that point in time. One of the most well known parts of Aristotle's ''Rhetoric'' is when he discusses the roles of pathos, ethos, and logos. Aristotle ties kairos to these concepts, claiming that there are times in each rhetorical situation when one needs to be utilized over the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kinneavy|first=James|author2=Catherine Eskin|title=Kairos in Aristotle's Rhetoric|journal=Written Communication|year=2000|volume=17|issue=3|pages=432–444|doi=10.1177/0741088300017003005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kairos has classically been defined as a concept that focused on "'the uniquely timely, the spontaneous, the radically particular.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paul|first1=Joanne|title=The use of Kairos in Renaissance Political Philosophy|journal=Renaissance Quarterly|date=Spring 2014|volume=67|issue=1|page=43|jstor=10.1086/676152}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ancient Pythagoreans thought Kairos to be one of the most fundamental laws of the universe.  Kairos was said to piece together the dualistic ways of the entire universe.  [[Empedocles]] was the philosopher who connect kairos to the principle of opposites and harmony.  It then became the principle of conflict and resolution and was thus inserted as a concept for rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Carter|first1=Michael |title=Stasis and Kairos: Principles of Social Construction in Classical Rhetoric|journal=Rhetoric Review|date=Autumn 1988|volume=7|issue=1|pages=101, 102|jstor=465537}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern rhetorical definition==
In his article "Critical-Rhetorical Ethnography: Rethinking the Place and Process of Rhetoric," Aaron Hess submits a definition of kairos for the present day that bridges the two classical applications. Hess addresses Poulakos’s view that, “In short, kairos dictates that what is said must be said at the right time.”&lt;ref name="Poulakos 1983 35–48"/&gt; He also suggests that in addition to timeliness kairos considers appropriateness. According to Hess, kairos can either be understood as, "the decorum or propriety of any given moment and speech act, implying a reliance on the given or known" or as, "the opportune, spontaneous, or timely."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hess|first=Aaron|title=Critical-Rhetorical Ethnography: Rethinking the place and Process of Rhetoric|journal=Communication Studies|year=2011|volume=62|issue=2|page=138|doi=10.1080/10510974.2011.529750}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these two ideas of kairos might seem conflicting, Hess says that they offer a more extensive understanding of the term. Furthermore, they encourage creativity, which is necessary to adapt to unforeseen obstacles and opinions that can alter the opportune or appropriate moment, i.e. kairos. Being able to recognize the propriety of a situation while having the ability to adapt one’s rhetoric allows taking advantage of kairos to be successful. Hess’s updated definition of kairos concludes that along with taking advantage of the timeliness and appropriateness of a situation, the term also implies being knowledgeable of and involved in the environment where the situation is taking place in order to benefit fully from seizing the opportune moment.
 
Hess's conflicting perspective on kairos is exemplified by the disagreement between Lloyd F. Bitzer and Richard E. Vatz about the rhetorical situation. Bitzer argues that rhetorical situations exist independent of human perspective; a situation invites discourse. He discusses the feeling of a missed opportunity to speak (kairos) and the tendency to later create a speech in response to that unseized moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bitzer|first=Lloyd|title=The Rhetorical Situation|journal=Philosophy and Rhetoric|date=January 1968|volume=1|pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Vatz counters Bitzer's view by claiming that a situation is made rhetorical by the perception of its interpreter and the way which they choose to respond to it, whether with discourse or not. It is the rhetor's responsibility to give an event meaning through linguistic depiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vatz|first=Richard|title=The Myth of the Rhetorical Situation|journal=Philosophy and Rhetoric|year=1983|volume=6.3|pages=155–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bitzer's and Vatz's perspectives add depth to Hess's ideas that kairos is concerned with both timeliness and appropriateness. On one hand, Bitzer's argument supports Hess's claim that kairos is spontaneous, and one must be able to recognize the situation as opportune in order to take advantage of it. On the other hand, Vatz's idea that the rhetor is responsible reinforces Hess's suggestion of the need to be knowledgeable and involved in the surrounding environment in order to fully profit from the situation.

According to Bitzer, Kairos is composed of exigence, audience, and constraints. Exigence is the inherent pressure to do something about a situation immediately, with the action required depending on the situation. The audience are the listeners who the rhetor is attempting to persuade. Constraints are the external factors that challenges the rhetors ability to influence, such as the audience’s personal beliefs and motivations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gelang|first=Marie|date=2012|title=Kairos, the Rhythm of Timing|url=|journal=Thamyris/Intersecting: Place, Sex &amp; Race|volume=26|pages=89–101|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, factors such as cultural background, previous social experiences, and current mood, can influence the capacity to see and understand the correct and opportune moment of action.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Thus, the difficulty of using kairos in a modern rhetorical setting is understanding and working within its constraints, while also carefully considering unexpected situations and encounters that arise, in order to present one’s rhetorical argument as naturally as possible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'Kairos' modern English definition is vague.  There is no one word in today's English language that completely encompasses the definition of kairos, similar to that of [[Ethos]], [[Logos]], and [[Pathos]].  In his article "The Ethics of Argument: Rereading Kairos and Making Sense in a Timely Fashion," Michael Harker says, "Like the 'points' on the rhetorical triangle, the meaning of kairos is not definitive but rather a starting point for grasping the whole of an argument."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harker|first1=Michael|title=The Ethics of Argument: Rereading Kairos and Making Sense in a Timely Fashion|journal=College Composition and Communication|date=September 2007|volume=59|issue=1|page=80|jstor=20456982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kairos' inclusion in modern composition has not been implicitly made, but there are undertones.  Various components of kairos are included in modern composition and have made profound effects on modern composition theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harker|first1=Michael|title=The Ethics of Argument: Reread Kairos and Making Sense in a Timely Fashion|journal=College Composition and Communication|date=September 2007|volume=59|issue=1|page=85|jstor=20456982}}&lt;/ref&gt;'

Kairos' purpose in modern rhetoric is mostly focused on the placement of logos, pathos, and ethos.  Kairos is used as a "starting point" in modern rhetoric.  Kelly Pender's article "'Kairos' and the Subject of Expressive Discourse" states the inclusion of kairos within discourse "would try to shift the focus of personal writing from the writer's experiences and emotions to a broader perspective that explicitly concentrates on the rhetorical situation..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pender|first1=Kelly|title="Kairos" and the Subject of Expressive Discourse|journal=Composition Studies|date=Fall 2003|volume=31|issue=2|page=96|jstor=43501556}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kairos is an expressive inclusion within the overall subject of discourse, and one that has an effect on the entire rhetoric.

==In Christian theology==
In the [[New Testament]], "kairos" means "the appointed time in the purpose of God," the time when God acts (e.g. {{bibleverse||Mark|1:15|NKJV}}: the ''kairos'' is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand). "Kairos" (used 86 times in the New Testament)&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/greek/2540.htm Strong's Greek Concordance]&lt;/ref&gt; refers to an opportune time, a "moment" or a "season" such as "harvest time," &lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|21:34|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas "chronos" (used 54 times)&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/greek/5550.htm Strong's Greek Concordance]&lt;/ref&gt; refers to a specific amount of time, such as a day or an hour (e.g. {{bibleverse||Acts|13:18|NKJV}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|27:9|NKJV}}). Jesus makes a distinction in {{bibleverse||John|7:6|NKJV}} between "His" time and "[[Brothers of Jesus|His brothers]]'" time: [[paradox]]ically, it is "always" ({{lang-gr|πάντοτε}}) his brothers' time. In the context, they can go to [[Jerusalem]] any time they wish.

In the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic]] churches, before the [[Divine Liturgy]] begins, the [[Deacon]] exclaims to the [[Priest]], 'Καιρὸς τοῦ ποιῆσαι τῷ Κυρίῳ' (''Kairos tou poiēsai tō Kyriō''), i.e. "It is time [''kairos''] for the Lord to act", indicating that the time of the Liturgy is an intersection with Eternity.

In ''The Interpretation of History,'' [[neo-orthodoxy|neo-orthodox]] [[Lutheran]] theologian [[Paul Tillich]] made prominent use of the term. For him, the ''kairoi'' are those crises in history (see [[Christian existentialism]]) which create an opportunity for, and indeed demand, an existential decision by the human subject - the coming of Christ being the prime example (compare [[Karl Barth]]'s use of ''Geschichte'' as opposed to ''Historie''). In the [[Kairos Document]], an example of [[liberation theology]] in [[South Africa under apartheid]], the term ''kairos'' is used to denote "the appointed time," "the crucial time" into which the document or text is spoken.

==In science==

In [[Hippocrates]]’ (460-357 B.C.E) major theoretical treatises on the nature of medical science and methodology, the term “kairos” is used within the first line. Hippocrates is generally accepted as the father of medicine, but his contribution to the discourse of science is less discussed. While “kairos” most often refers to “the right time,” Hippocrates also used to term when referencing experimentation. Using this term allowed him to “express the variable components of medical practice more accurately.” Here the word refers more to proportion, the mean, and the implicit sense of right measure.

Hippocrates most famous quote about kairos is “every kairos is a chronos, but not every chronos is a kairos.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sipiora|first1=Phillip|last2=Baumlin|first2=James S.|title=Rhetoric and Kairos: Essays in History, Theory, and Praxis|date=2002|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=New York|pages=97–99|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZ6r7ozilPMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''A Rhetoric of Doing: Essays on Written Discourse in Honor of James L. Kinneavy'' by Stephen Paul Witte, Neil Nakadate, Roger Dennis Cherry also discusses the art of kairos in the field of science. Citing [[John Swales]], the essay notes that the introduction sections of scientific research articles are nothing more than the construction of openings. This idea derives from the spacial aspect of kairos, or the creation of "an opening," which can be created by writers and discovered by readers. This opening is the opportune time, or kairos. Swales created what he called the "create a research space" model, wherein kairos, or an opening, was constructed. It consisted of four rhetorical moves. 1.) establishing the field. 2.) summarizing previous research. 3.) preparing for present research, and 4.) introducing the present research. The third step is one where a gap in previous research is indicated, thus creating the need for more information. The writer constructs a need, and an opening. Because kairos emphasizes change, it is an important aspect of science. Not all scientific research can be presented at the same time or in the same way, but creating an opening makes it possible to construct the right time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Witte|first1=Stephen|last2=Nakadate|first2=Neil|last3=Cherry|first3=Roger|title=A Rhetoric of Doing: Essays on Written Discourse in Honor of James L. Kinneavy|date=1992|publisher=SIU Press|pages=312–313|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=EpA3cTT6iskC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA310&amp;dq=kairos+&amp;ots=L_mQnkEhmb&amp;sig=71BXqclQo_v5Tk0uuUEfTDYZqIQ#v=onepage&amp;q=kairos&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This can easily be related back to Hippocrates statement that not every opening is an opportunity. Yet, in science, the message can be adapted in such a way that chronos becomes kairos.

The idea can also be expressed in the words of Carolyn M. Glasshoff who wrote that, specifically in the field of scientific writing, “any text must be influenced by the kairos that exists both before the text is created and during the presentation. In addition, each text helps create a new kairos for texts that come after.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Glasshoff|first1=Carolyn M.|title=Gore 's Science The Kairos Of An Inconvenient Truth And The Implications For Science Writing|url=http://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2928&amp;context=etd|website=University of Central Florida STARS|publisher=University of Central Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Kairos in digital media ==
The historical context of the definition of kairos may make the concept appear outdated. However, the relevancy of kairos is at its peak as the world has rapidly transformed into a society dependent on digital technology. In order to recognize how kairos can be applied to online media and the challenges that occur as a result, a broad definition of the term is required. One definition makes the application of kairos to digital media easy to recognize, as it states kairos can be referred to as particular moment in which success is achieved when an opening is pursued with force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=David|date=2009|title=Kairos and New Media:  Toward a Theory and Practice of Visual Activism|url=http://enculturation.net/6.2/sheridan-michel-ridolfo|journal=Enculturation|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition prompts a main issue within the application of kairos to online content: if timing is crucial to the message of communication that is being received, how can we communicate effectively online, where anything can be published at any time?

The difficulty with modern rhetoric in the digital space is that the audience is less easily influenced by the rhetor. As such, it is difficult for rhetors to utilize kairos to the best of their abilities. Due to the nature of which modern audiences in the electronic age consume media, it is highly possible that they are multi-tasking, with their attention divided among multiple sources. This difficulty is compounded with the fact that this audience can consume discourse at different times, in different places, and through varying mediums. As a result, the audience is able to assign encountered discourse at various levels of personal priority. With this, they are able to discern which discourse they think is vital or interesting, and discard those they deem trivial or unworthy of their attention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are also multiple external factors that lead to the difficulty in using kairos in a modern setting. Since computer hardware, software, and even the underlying operating system all differ between people, it is difficult for the orator to take account for every permutation possible. Couple this with the lack of a true shared community online, since such virtual “cloakroom communities” are only temporary, and the difficulties in using kairos in the digital age becomes painfully clear.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some scholars studying kairos in the modern digital sphere argue that the aspects of body/ identity, distribution/ circulation, access/ accessibility, interaction, and economics are handled differently in an online setting and therefore messages that are sent digitally need to be altered to fit the new circumstances. In order to reach online audiences effectively, scholars suggest that context of the information's use, which includes considerations of legal, health-related, disciplinary, and political factors paired with smart rhetorical thinking can solve the issue of miscommunicated messages distributed on online forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Porter|first=James|date=2009|title=Recovering Delivery for Digital Rhetoric|url=https://summitsguide.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/porter_recovering-delivery-for-digital-rhetoric.pdf|journal=Computers and Composition|volume=26|pages=207–224|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3623">'''Knut Bergsland''' (7 March 1914 – 9 July 1998) was a Norwegian linguist. Working as a professor at the [[University of Oslo]] from 1947 to 1981, he did groundbreaking research in [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] (especially [[Sami languages|Sami]]) and [[Eskimo–Aleut languages]].

==Career==
He was born in [[Oslo|Kristiania]] as a son of engineer Einar Christian Bergsland (1883–1945) and Henriette Louise Krogh Raabe (1883–1958). He was the brother of sports administrator [[Einar Bergsland]]. He [[examen artium|finished]] his secondary education in 1932, and enrolled at the [[University of Oslo]]. He also studied at the [[École des Hautes Études]] and the [[Institut Catholique de Paris|Institut Catholique]] from 1935 to 1936. He graduated with the [[cand.philol.]] degree in 1940, having specialized in [[Latin language|Latin]], but now concentrated more on the [[Sami languages]]. His first linguistic work was a grammar of the [[Southern Sami language|Southern Sámi]] language, released as ''Røros-lappisk grammatikk'' in 1946. This work earned him the [[dr.philos.]] degree,&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1999|title=Knut Bergsland|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Hanne Gram|last=Simonsen|authorlink=Hanne Gram Simonsen|volume=1|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Knut_Bergsland/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=24 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is still the reference grammar of this language.

In 1947 Bergsland was appointed professor in [[Finno-Ugric languages]] at the University of Oslo, succeeding [[Konrad Nielsen]]. He continued his work on Sami languages, and also did important research in [[Eskimo–Aleut languages]], firstly a historical grammar of [[Kalaallisut]] (or Western Greenlandic), and then a dictionary and reference grammar of [[Aleut language|Aleut]]. His interest in these languages arose during two stays as a visiting scholar; respectively at the [[University of Copenhagen]] in 1948 and the [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University at Bloomington]] in 1949&amp;ndash;1950. He continued studying Aleut after retiring as a professor in 1981.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; Bergsland's professorship was vacant until 1987, when [[Ole Henrik Magga]] replaced him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uit.no/14/4144/15 |title=Verdensborger med komager på |last=Broderstad |first=Else Grete |work=Tromsøflaket |language=Norwegian |accessdate=24 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110608073354/http://uit.no/14/4144/15 |archivedate= 8 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergsland's final works were ''Aleut dictionary – Unangam tunudgusii'' (1994), ''Aleut Grammar'' (1997) and ''Ancient Aleut Personal Names'' (1998). He died in July 1998.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

Bergsland held an [[honorary degree]] at the [[University of Helsinki]].&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Knut Bergsland|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=Henriksen, Petter|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Knut_Bergsland|language=Norwegian|accessdate=24 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[World Heritage site]] is a location that is listed by [[UNESCO]] as having outstanding [[Cultural heritage|cultural]] or [[Natural heritage|natural]] value to the common heritage of humanity.&lt;ref name="criteria"&gt;{{Cite web|author=World Heritage Committee|title=The Criteria for Selection|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria|publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|accessdate=2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Heritage Committee]] has designated 32 World Heritage sites in [[Oceania]]. These are in 11 countries, with the majority of sites being located in Australia. The first three inscriptions from the region, the [[Great Barrier Reef]], [[Kakadu National Park]] and the [[Willandra Lakes Region|Willandra Lakes]], were in 1981—three years after the list's creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Young, Emma|title=World Heritage sites of Australia|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/australias-world-heritage-sites.htm|date=29 August 2011|work=Australian Geographic|accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region contains the world's three largest sites: [[Phoenix Islands Protected Area]], [[Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument|Papahānaumokuākea]] and the [[Great Barrier Reef]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Staff writers|title=Marine Paradise Named Largest World Heritage Site|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/slideshow/marine-paradise-kiribatis-phoenix-islands-protected-area-added-11323618|newspaper=ABC News|publisher=ABC News Internet Ventures|year=2010|accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|title=Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/key_issues/conservation/heritage/world_heritage|publisher=Government of Australia|accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[Tasmanian Wilderness]] is one of only two sites in the world that meet seven out of the ten criteria for World Heritage listing ([[Mount Tai]] in China being the other).

Each year, the World Heritage Committee may inscribe new sites on the list, or delist sites that no longer meet the criteria. Selection is based on [[World Heritage site#Selection criteria|ten criteria]]: six for cultural heritage (i&amp;ndash;vi) and four for natural heritage (vii&amp;ndash;x). Some sites, designated "mixed sites", represent both cultural and natural heritage. In Oceania there are 7 cultural, 19 natural and 5 mixed sites.&lt;ref name="list"&gt;{{Cite web|author=World Heritage Committee|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/nominations/|title=World Heritage List Nominations|publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|accessdate=2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO may also specify that a site is [[List of World Heritage in Danger|in danger]], stating "conditions which threaten the very characteristics for which a property was inscribed on the World Heritage List."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=World Heritage Committee|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/158/|title=World Heritage in Danger|publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|accessdate=2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the Committee added [[East Rennell]] to the List of World Heritage in Danger because of the threat of logging activities to the site's outstanding universal value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=World Heritage Committee|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1034|title=World Heritage Committee inscribes East Rennell on the List of World Heritage in Danger|publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Maschen disc brooch''' is an [[Early Medieval]] [[fibula (brooch)|fibula]], which was found in 1958 during [[archaeological excavation]]s of the late [[Saxons|Saxon]] [[grave field]] near [[Maschen]], in the [[Lower Saxony]] district of [[Harburg (district)|Harburg]], [[Germany]]. On its face side, the fibula shows an unidentified [[saint]] with a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]. It was found in a woman's grave of the beginning of the [[Christianization]] of [[northern Germany]], and is in the permanent exhibition of the [[Archäologisches Museum Hamburg|Archaeological Museum Hamburg]] in [[Harburg, Hamburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Topic Death, Showcase no. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Articus"&gt;{{cite book | last1 =Articus | first1 =Rüdiger  | last2 =Brandt | first2 =Jochen | last3 =Först | first3 =Elke | last4 =Krause | first4 =Yvonne | last5 =Merkel | first5 =Michael | last6 =Mertens | first6 =Kathrin | last7 =Weiss | first7 =Rainer-Maria | title =Archaeological Museum Hamburg Helms-Museum: A short guide to the Tour of the Times | series = Archaeological Museum Hamburg publication | publisher = Helms-Museum  | volume =103 | edition = | year =2013 | location = Hamburg | pages =159 | isbn =978-3-931429-24-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==

The [[cemetery]] was located on the western fringes of the ''{{lang|de|Hallonen}}'', an approximately {{convert|63|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} mountain range which is running out on the {{convert|23|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} ''{{lang|de|Fuchsberg}}'' some {{convert|1200|m|ft}} southeast of the village center of Maschen. During [[sand]] extraction from the Fuchsberg for the construction of the nearby [[Bundesautobahn 1]], two [[Bronze Age]] [[Tumulus|tumuli]] were discovered in 1958. 

The following excavations revealed that both grave [[mound]]s were disturbed to the undisturbed ground. Except for a few [[ceramic]] vessel shards and a [[razor]] from several later [[burial]]s on the hill, no further [[Feature (archaeology)|findings]] were recorded. While pushing off the [[humus]]layer {{convert|20|m|ft}} north of the tumuli, the first late Saxon flat graves appeared in the ground. Additionally some soil discolorations appeared at a brim of the sand mine some {{convert|80|m|ft}} east, indicating burial pits. During the initially launched rescue excavation, the complete burial site were excavated and documented in a three-week operation. It was the first fully documented late Saxon burial site of northern Germany so far with a total of 210 examined burials. 

21 burials were oriented in south-north direction and the majority of 189 burials were created in west-east orientation. The Maschen disc brooch was found in the grave No. 54 of a wealthy woman.&lt;ref name="Wegewitz_1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wegewitz | first = Willi | title = Das Reihengräberfeld von Maschen | journal = Hammaburg N.F | volume = 8 | year = 1988 | issn = 0173-0886 | isbn = 3-529-01356-0 | pages = 161-171 (164-165) | language = German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Findings ==

The Maschen disc brooch lay with its face side down on the woman's chest. The brooch has a diameter of {{convert|30|mm|in}} and is made of different colored [[vitreous enamel]] in [[cloisonné]] technique on a [[copper]] plate. The copper base of the brooch is can shaped, and the enamel plate was fixed in the copper base on a bed of [[loam]] by [[flange|flanging]] the protruding edges of the bases wall. The needle apparatus was not preserved. The remaining hinges indicate that it was a needle with a coil spring. Both the metal parts and enamel inlays are slightly worn. A [[radiology|radiological]] examination revealed that the enamel layer has a thickness of {{convert|0.4|mm|in}}.&lt;ref name="Wegewitz_1988"/&gt; The front face of the disc brooch depicts a stylized chest portrait on a now red background. The face and neck of the portrayed person are made of now greenish white enamel. Its eyes and nose region is formed by a curved bar made of copper, ending in two loops as stylized eyes. Around the head a kind of halo is shown, made of whitish to light blue enamel. The upper body has a semi-elliptical shape. The body is decorated by two widely arced copper bars from the neck towards the shoulders, which end there in small loops. The area around the neck of the figure is made of now light blue to turquoise enamel. The lower chest area, below the copper bars, is made of a now dark blue enamel.

== Interpretation ==
[[File:Scheibenfibel Todtglüsingen.jpg|thumb|The almost identical Todtglüsingen disc brooch]]
Due to its halo-like ornament around the head, the figure on the Maschen disc brooch is interpreted as an unspecified saint, and may possibly depict [[Jesus Christ]]. The addition of the fibula as a [[grave good]] indicates that the buried woman was an early Christian. She may have promised herself a salvation effect from the depicted figure, as the brooch was found placed with its face side on her chest.&lt;ref name="Wegewitz_1988"/&gt; 

Due to the geographical orientation of the burial and its location within the cemetery, the burial has been [[Dating methodologies in archaeology|dated]] to the period between 800 and 900 AD, which marks the beginning of the thorough Christianization of Northern Germany.&lt;ref name="Articus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wegewitz_1988"/&gt; 

So far, some 100 comparison finds of fibulae of the Maschen disc brooch type were known, but they all came from stray finds or were collected from the surface without any assignment to a specific grave, and therefore a more precise dating of this type of brooches has been impossible before.&lt;ref name="Wegewitz_1988"/&gt; 

By the end of 2012 another nearly identical piece was found in a construction area at the [[Tostedt]] district of Todtglüsingen. The origin of this fibula is believed to be the [[Lower Rhine region]] and the noticeable accumulation of finds at the [[Niederelbe]] area may indicate that it has faced an increased popularity especially in this region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Brandt | first = Jochen | title = Frisch vom Acker | editors = Mitteilungen des Museums- und Heimatvereins Harburg-Stadt und -Land e.&amp;nbsp;V., Helms-Museum | journal = Helms-Museum Aktuell | number = 29 |date=March 2013 | pages = 4 | language = German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Counselor Certification ==
As part of membership, agencies agree to certify their counselors through the NFCC Certification program which focuses on empowering counselors to deliver exemplary counseling and educational services to the clients and communities they serve.  Certified counselors are able to demonstrate to the community and their colleagues that they have attained the degree of professional knowledge and skills necessary to provide quality services.

Individuals in need of financial counseling can experience confidence in knowing that by working with an NFCC member they are being assisted by a counselor who has been certified and held to a high standard of service delivery.  A typical session includes reviewing goals, completing a thorough financial analysis, and working in partnership with the individual to establish steps to improve the individual’s overall financial well-being.

The NFCC Certification program is exclusive to NFCC members and provides industry best practices in the financial management arena, to include working with people in (but not limited to):

* Establishing goals and the action steps to achieve them
* Developing and understanding a budget as well as revising a budget during times of crisis
* Working with creditors to manage unsecured debt and determine alternatives that most effectively meet the consumer’s needs and goals
* Determining affordability of potential housing options
* Examining steps needed to obtain and maintain home ownership
* Understanding consumer rights and responsibilities
* Navigating the student loan repayment process
* Identifying community resources and referrals that may assist individual’s in increasing their financial well-being
* Understanding the collection and foreclosure processes
* Establishing strategies to overcome financial hardships
* Developing techniques to effectively cope with unplanned expenditures and prepare for the future
* Understanding credit reporting and possible methods to improve credit-worthiness

The NFCC Certification program requires initial certification through comprehensive instruction on how to provide education and guidance regarding the multitude of areas listed above.  The program also requires continuing education in service related areas as well as mandatory re-certification on a bi-annual cycle for credit counseling and annual cycle for housing and student loan.

== Supporters and Funders ==
In 2018, the Suntrust [https://www.nfcc.org/suntrust-foundation-provides-250000-grant-support-hispanic-nonprofit-financial-counseling-program/ Foundation] provided funds in support of a Hispanic nonprofit financial Counseling Program.

== Client Impact and Research ==
In 2016, the NFCC unveiled the findings from a comprehensive, independent evaluation of credit counseling, which was conducted by researchers at The Ohio State University. “[https://sharpen.nfcc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/NFCC-Sharpen-Exec-Summary-2018-update.pdf The NFCC Sharpen Your Financial Focus Initiative Impact Evaluation]” assessed the long-term impact of nonprofit financial counseling by comparing financial health outcomes for Sharpen Your Financial Focus® clients with those of non-counseled individuals.

The Sharpen study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sharpen.nfcc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/NFCC-Sharpen-Exec-Summary-2018-update.pdf|title=NFCC Sharpen Executive Summary|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sharpen.nfcc.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; revealed the positive outcomes of financial counseling with an NFCC member agency. During the 18 months following counseling, Sharpen clients decreased their total debt by almost $9,000—a statistically significant reduction of $11,300 more than the comparison group, whose total debt increased slightly during the same period. The average decrease in total debt per individual at 18 months post counseling was $17,000. They also saw an average of a 50 point increase in their [[credit score]].

[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Tower of Babel (Vienna) - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The [[Tower of Babel]], a common [[symbol]] in discussions of nationalism (painting by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], 1563)]]
'''Nationalism studies''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] academic field devoted to the study of [[nationalism]] and related issues.  While nationalism has been the subject of scholarly discussion since at least the late eighteenth century, it is only since the early 1990s that it has received enough attention for a distinct field to emerge.&lt;ref name="Özkirimli 2000p15"&gt;{{cite book|last=Özkirimli|first=Umut|title=Theories of Nationalism: A Critical Introduction|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2000|pages=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lG09IwAACAAJ|isbn=0-333-77711-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors such as [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[Carlton J. H. Hayes]], [[Hans Kohn]], [[Elie Kedourie]], [[John Hutchinson (academic)|John Hutchinson]], [[Ernest Gellner]], [[Karl Deutsch]], [[Walker Connor]], [[Anthony D. Smith]], and [[Benedict Anderson]] laid the foundation for nationalism studies in the post-war period.  In the early 1990s their ideas were enthusiastically taken up by academics, journalists, and others looking to understand and explain the apparent resurgence of nationalism marked by events such as the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], the [[Rwanda genocide]], and the [[Yugoslav Wars]].

==History of the field==

The development of the field can be divided into four stages: (I) the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when nationalism first emerged, and most interest in it was philosophical; (II) the period from the [[First World War]] until the end of the [[Second World War|Second]], when nationalism became a subject of formal academic inquiry; (III) the post-war period from 1945 to the late 1980s, when several [[sociology|sociologists]] and [[political science|political scientists]] developed general theories of nationalism in the context of worldwide [[decolonisation]] and the 'ethnic revival' in the [[Western world|West]]; and (IV) the period following the [[fall of communism]] in 1989, which led to a surge of interest in nationalism and the crystallisation of nationalism studies as a field.&lt;ref name="Özkirimli 2000p15"/&gt;

===Eighteenth and nineteenth centuries===
"Up to the First World War," [[Umut Özkirimli]] explains, "interest in nationalism was largely [[ethical]] and [[philosophical]]. The scholars of this period, predominantly historians and social philosophers, were more concerned with the 'merits and defects' of the [[doctrine]] than with the origins and spread of national phenomena."&lt;ref name="Özkirimli 2000p12"&gt;{{cite book|last=Özkirimli|first=Umut|title=Theories of Nationalism: A Critical Introduction|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2000|pages=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lG09IwAACAAJ|isbn=0-333-77711-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[nation-state]] was seen as a progressive stage in the historical development of human societies, and both [[Liberalism|liberals]] and [[Marxists]] expected that nationalism would eventually give way to a [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] world order. In this context, nations and nationalism were taken for granted, and most authors who discussed them were motivated by some political concern. There were no attempts to fashion a general theory of nationalism that was applicable to all cases.&lt;ref name="Özkirimli 2000p12-13"&gt;{{cite book|last=Özkirimli|first=Umut|title=Theories of Nationalism: A Critical Introduction|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2000|pages=12–13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lG09IwAACAAJ|isbn=0-333-77711-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the important authors in this period include: [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], [[Ernest Renan]], and [[John Stuart Mill]].

==Nationalism studies as an academic field==

Several universities organize degree and non-degree courses on nationalism. Boston University, University of London (particularly the [[London School of Economics]]), Central European University (Hungary), and University of Edinburgh are among the most prominent institutions where the study of nationalism occupies a central place. The Faculty of Humanities of [[Eötvös Loránd University]] (Hungary) has recently launched a comprehensive short-term program, dedicated exclusively to the study of nationalism.

== The future of the field ==
Authors such as Michal Luczewski and Ruhtan Yalçıne believe that the field is becoming increasingly difficult to study. According to Michal Luczewski, researchers have been talking past each other for decades and there has not been valuable knowledge produced for around 50 years&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iwm.at/publications/5-junior-visiting-fellows-conferences/vol-xviii/michal-luczewski/|title=What Remains for Nationalism Studies?|last=Luczewski|first=Michal|date=|website=Institute for Human Sciences|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Since this time, the field has been stuck between contemporary scientific facts and common-sense theories. Answers to the basic questions of nationalism (What is the Nation? Why does the Nation exist?) have been answered countless times over leaving a swath of contradictory theories and a lack of consensus. The question remains whether it is even possible to construct a universal theory of nationalism. Theories previously proposed are often detached from reality, given the diverse ways in which identities form in different groups around the world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yalçıner|first=Ruhtan|date=2010-03-01|title=Political Philosophy and Nationalism|url=http://internationalstudies.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.001.0001/acrefore-9780190846626-e-276?rskey=YgklCh&amp;result=1|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.001.0001/acrefore-9780190846626-e-276}}&lt;/ref&gt; .

In order to solve for this problem Michal Luczewski recommends that scholars employ greater awareness in addressing the essential questions of nationalism studies. Scholars should produce extensive work dealing “with national phenomena in all their varieties, integrating emotions, cognitions, both the subjective and objective dimensions into one picture.” It is essential for scholars to ignore subjective experience and deal directly with reality. This can be accomplished by utilizing empirical evidence. Luczewski also recommends starting small, “consecutively from the micro level through more and more general steps to the macro one.”

==Journals==

One of the earliest journals devoted to the study of nationalism was the ''[[Canadian Review of Studies in Nationalism]]'', founded at the [[University of Prince Edward Island]] by [[Thomas Spira]] in 1973. The journal "[[Nationalities Papers]]" was founded in 1971. Journals in the field include the following:

*''[[Ethnicities (journal)|Ethnicities]]''

'''''Philosophy as Cultural Politics: Philosophical Papers: v.4''''' is a 2007 book by [[Richard Rorty]], the late Professor of Comparative Literature, Emeritus, at [[Stanford University]]. A compilation of selected philosophical papers written by Rorty between 1997 and 2007, it complements three previous selections of his papers.

==Contents==
In this book, Rorty explores the relation between [[philosophy]] and [[culture]].

Topics covered include:
# the changing role of philosophy in Western culture over the course of recent centuries,
# the role of the imagination in intellectual and moral progress,
# the notion of 'moral identity',
# Wittgenstein's claim that the problems of philosophy are linguistic in nature,
# the irrelevance of cognitive science to philosophy
# the mistaken idea that philosophers should find the 'place' of such things as consciousness and moral value in a world of physical particles.

[[File:White piscataway.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Catholic Catechism]] prayers handwritten in the Piscataway, [[Latin]], and English languages by a [[Catholicism|Catholic]] missionary to the [[Piscataway people|Piscataway]] tribe, [[Andrew White (missionary)|Andrew White]], SJ, ca. 1634—1640. [[Lauinger Library]], [[Georgetown University]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.georgetown.edu/dept/speccoll/treasures/items2new.htm "Manuscript prayers in Piscataway ."] ''Treasures of Lauinger Library.'' (retrieved 4 Jan 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Piscataway''' is an extinct [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language formerly spoken by the [[Piscataway (tribe)|Piscataway]], a dominant [[chiefdom]] in southern [[Maryland]] on the [[Western Shore of Maryland|Western Shore]] of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] at time of contact with English settlers.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond G. Gordon Jr., ed.  2005.  ''Ethnologue:  Languages of the World''.  15th edition.  Dallas:  Summer Institute of Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;  Piscataway, also known as ''Conoy'' (from the [[Iroquois]] [[ethnonym]] for the tribe), is considered a dialect of [[Nanticoke language|Nanticoke]].&lt;ref name="mithun1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mithun|first=Marianne|authorlink=Marianne Mithun|year=1999|title=The languages of Native North America|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-23228-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This designation is based on the scant evidence available for the Piscataway language. The [[Doeg (tribe)|Doeg]] tribe, then located in present-day [[Northern Virginia]], are also thought to have spoken a form of the same language. These dialects were intermediate between the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] groups of [[Lenape language|Lenape]] languages formerly spoken to the north of this area (in present-day [[Delaware]] and [[New Jersey]]) and the [[Powhatan language]], formerly spoken to the south, in what is now [[Tidewater Virginia]].

== Classification ==
Piscataway is classified as an Eastern Algonquian language:

* [http://www.ethnologue.com/subgroups/algic-1 Algic (42)]
** [http://www.ethnologue.com/subgroups/algonquian-1 Algonquian (40)]
*** [http://www.ethnologue.com/subgroups/eastern-algonquian-1 Eastern Algonquian (12)]
**** Nanticoke-Conoy (2)
***** Nanticoke [[ethnologue:nnt/19|[nnt]]] (A language of [http://www.ethnologue.com/country/US United States])
***** Piscataway [[ethnologue:psy/19|[psy]]] (A language of [http://www.ethnologue.com/country/US United State])

== History ==
The Piscataway dialect, an individual from the Eastern Algonquian family, is extinct.  According to ''The Languages of Native North America,'' Piscataway, otherwise called Conoy (from the Iroquois name for the tribe), was a dialect of Nanticoke.&lt;ref name="mithun1999" /&gt; This assignment depends on the insufficient accessible proof of both dialects. It is identified with the gathering of Delaware dialects, and all the more nearly to Powhatan, which were formerly spoken in the area of present-day Virginia. The first speakers lived on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay, today part of Maryland. In particular, they occupied the range of the lower Potomac and Patuxent River seepages.

The Piscataway dialect was a piece of the huge Algonquian dialect family. The Jesuit evangelist Father Andrew White translated the [[Catholic Catechism]] into the Piscataway language in 1610, and other English teachers gathered Piscataway-dialect materials. The original copy is a five-page Catholic instruction written in an Eastern Algonquian dialect. It is the main surviving record of the dialect which is ventured to be Piscataway (additionally called Conoy). It is identified as such due to its attribution to Father White.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:407325:5/component/escidoc:407324/piscataway_mackie2006_s.pdf|title=Fragments of Piscataway: A Preliminary Description|last=Mackie|first=Lisa|date=2006|website=|publisher=|access-date=February 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographical distribution ==
This language was only spoken in Maryland.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

=== Official status ===
Piscataway is an extinct [[ethnologue:psy|language]]{{cn|date=March 2017}}

== Grammar ==

=== Morphology ===
Both inflectional and deduction morphological procedures are clear in the questioning. A few, for example, prefixation, obviously mirror the worldview discovered for the most part in the 108 group of dialects. The confirmation for TI and TA derivational morphemes taking after the example of Delaware proposes close ties between those dialects and Piscataway. In addition, the proof of any morphological procedures, particularly the utilization of plural articulation are found on a few things.

'''Ravenser Odd''', also spelled '''Ravensrodd''', was a port in the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]], England, during the medieval period, built on the sandbanks at the mouth of the [[Humber]] estuary.

The name Ravenser comes from the [[Old Norse|Viking]] ''Hrafn's Eyr'' or "Raven's tongue" referring to the lost sandbank promontory, the modern successor of which is now known as [[Spurn Point]].&lt;ref name=yh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ourpasthistory.com/yorkshirehistory/RAVENSER/index.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611081934/http://ourpasthistory.com/yorkshirehistory/RAVENSER/index.htm |archivedate=11 June 2011|title=History of Ravenser Odd|accessdate=27 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Hull Literary Club Magazine, A Record of Transactions|issue=Session 1912–13, vol. IV., part IV|title=The Lost Towns of the Yorkshire Coast|author=T. Sheppard F.G.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The town was founded by the [[Count of Aumale]] in the mid-thirteenth century, and had more than one hundred houses and a flourishing market by 1299, when it was granted a borough charter.&lt;ref name="sheeran"&gt;George Sheeran, ''Medieval Yorkshire Towns'', p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 13th century the town was a more important port than [[Kingston upon Hull]], further up the Humber, and was represented in the [[Model Parliament]] of 1295,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} but as the sandbanks shifted the town was swept away. Storms over the winter of 1356–57 completely flooded the town, leading to its abandonment,&lt;ref name="sheeran" /&gt; and it was largely destroyed by the [[Grote Mandrenke]] storm of January 1362.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Paul|last=Simons|title=Since Records Began|location=London|publisher=Collins|year=2008|isbn=978-0-00-728463-4|pages=178–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is now completely underwater.&lt;ref name=yh/&gt;

[[File:Sommernachtskonzert Schönbrunn 2012 45 Omphale.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Statue of Omphale in the Schönbrunn Garden]]
The '''sculptures in the Schönbrunn Garden''' at [[Schönbrunn Palace]] in [[Vienna]], Austria were created between 1773 and 1780 under the direction of [[Johann Wilhelm Beyer]], a German artist and [[garden designer]]. The Great Parterre of [[Schönbrunn Garden]] is lined on both sides with 32 over life-size sculptures that represent mythological deities and virtues. The ''Neptune Fountain'' at the foot of the Gloriette hill is the crowning monument of the Great Parterre. Other sculptures are distributed throughout the garden and palace forecourt, including fountains and pools. Several sculptors were employed during the execution of these works, among them [[Johann Baptist Hagenauer]].

Oeneus instructed Meleager to bring together heroes from all over Greece to hunt the boar that was terrorizing their land. Among these heroes, Meleager chose [[Atalanta]], a fierce huntress, whom he loved. When two centaurs, [[Hylaeus and Rhaecus]], tried to rape Atalanta, Meleager killed them. During the hunt, Atalanta wounded the boar, and later Meleager killed it, awarding her the hide because she drew the first drop of blood.

Descended from [[Perseus]] and the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Alcmene|Alcmena]], Heracles was renowned for his strength and courage, as well as his good nature and compassion.&lt;ref name="howatson-269"&gt;Howatson 1989, p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; Considered a common source of help, his name was invoked on all occasions. Heracles also served as an ideal of human behavior, acting for the benefit of mankind.&lt;ref name="howatson-269"/&gt; As an infant, he killed the two snakes sent by [[Hera]] to kill him. He studied the arts from the greatest experts, including archery from Eurytus, wrestling from Autolycus, weaponry from Polydeuces, and music from Linus.&lt;ref name="howatson-269"/&gt;

|''Perseus''
|Johann Wilhelm Beyer
|[[Perseus]] was the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Danaë]]. He also killed the [[gorgon]] [[Medusa]], sister of [[Stheno]] and [[Euryale (Gorgon)|Euryale]], with [[Hermes]]' flying shoes and a [[shield]] made of reflecting metal. He needed the [[shield]] to kill the [[gorgon]], elseway he had to look at her and would have turned to [[stone]].&lt;ref name="howatson-422"&gt;Howatson 1989, p. 422.&lt;/ref&gt;

|''Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus''
|Joseph Baptist Hagenauer
|[[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus]] (c. 280 BC – 203 BC) was a Roman politician and general who was [[Roman Consul]] five times and [[Roman Dictator]] twice. As a military strategist, he became known as ''Cunctator'' (''delayer'') for the [[Fabian strategy|tactics]] he employed during the [[Second Punic War]]. He is widely considered the father of [[guerrilla warfare]] for targeting enemy supply lines while facing a vastly superior enemy—a novel strategy at the time.

|''Abduction of Helena''
|Johann Wilhelm Beyer
|[[Helen of Troy]] was the wife of King Menelaus of Sparta, the younger brother of Agamemnon.&lt;ref name="howatson-262"&gt;Howatson 1989, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; Known for her great beauty, Helen was taken to Attica in her youth by Theseus, but was rescued by her brothers and taken back to Sparta, where she was courted by the greatest men in Greece.&lt;ref name="howatson-262"/&gt; She chose Menelaus as her husband, and soon bore him a daughter, Hermione.&lt;ref name="howatson-262"/&gt; When Paris was sent as an ambassador to [[Sparta]] by his father, he fell in love and eloped with Helen, which caused the [[Trojan War]].&lt;ref name="howatson-409"/&gt; After the Spartans arrived in Troy, Menelaus, challenged Paris to a duel for Helen's return. Paris was soundly beaten by the king and was saved at the last minute by Aphrodite spirits.&lt;ref name="howatson-409"/&gt; After the war, Menelaus found Helen in Egypt and brought her back to Sparta. In Greek mythology, Helen was the daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Leda and the Swan|Leda]]. According to the myth, Zeus visited Leda in the form of a swan, producing an egg from which Helen was hatched.&lt;ref name="howatson-262"/&gt;

|''Janus and Bellona''
|Johann Wilhelm Beyer
|[[Janus]] was the god of gates, doorways, and beginnings in the Roman religion. He is often depicted having two faces because he looked to both the past and the future.&lt;ref name="howatson-304"&gt;Howatson 1989, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; The first month of the Roman calendar (''[[Ianuarius]]'' or January) was named in his honor.&lt;ref name="howatson-304"/&gt; Janus is shown standing with [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]], the Roman goddess of war, and according to various accounts the wife or sister of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]].&lt;ref name="howatson-86"&gt;Howatson 1989, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; The first temple dedicated to her was built in the [[Campus Martius]] near the [[Circus Flaminius]] by [[Appius Claudius Caecus]] in 296 BC during the war against the Etruscans.&lt;ref name="howatson-86"/&gt;

|''Amphion''
|Joseph Baptist Hagenauer
|[[Amphion and Zethus|Amphion]] was the son of [[Zeus]] by [[Antiope (mother of Amphion)|Antiope]].&lt;ref name="howatson-40-41"&gt;Howatson 1989, pp. 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt; After she was raped by Zeus, Antiope fled to [[Sicyon]] and married King [[Epopeus]]. She was later captured by [[Nycteus]] or [[Lycus (brother of Nycteus)|Lycus]] and taken back to [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]]. Along the way she gave birth to the twins and was forced to leave them on [[Mount Cithaeron]]. After being enslaved by Lycus and his wife [[Dirce]], who treated her cruelly for many years, Antiope escaped and eventually found her sons, who avenged her captivity by killing Dirce—tying her to the horns of a bull.&lt;ref name="howatson-41"&gt;Howatson 1989, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Amphion and Zethus went on to conquer Thebes, where they ruled together. Amphion became a great singer and musician after [[Hermes]] taught him to play and gave him a golden lyre. He and his brother built the walls around the [[Cadmea]], the citadel of Thebes. Amphion's musical skill was so great that when played his lyre, the stones simply moved into place.&lt;ref name="howatson-41"/&gt;

|''Gaius Mucius Scaevola'' 
|Johann Martin Fischer
|[[Gaius Mucius Scaevola]] was a legendary Roman youth known for his bravery. During the siege of Rome by King [[Lars Porsena]] of Clusium at the end of the sixth century BC, Scaevola entered the enemy's camp and attempted to kill the king. When he was taken prisoner and threatened with death, Scaevola placed his right hand into a fire to show his indifference to death. Porsena was so impressed he freed the brave youth, who took on the cognomen ''Scaevola'' meaning "left-handed".&lt;ref name="howatson-510"&gt;Howatson 1989, p. 510.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neptune Fountain==
[[File:Neptune Fountain in the Schönbrunn Garden.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|''Neptune Fountain'' in the Schönbrunn Garden]]
The ''Neptune Fountain'' at the foot of the Gloriette hill was designed to be the crowning monument of the Great Parterre.&lt;ref name="neptune"&gt;{{cite web|title=Neptune Fountain |work=Schloß Schönbrunn |url=http://www.schoenbrunn.at/en/things-to-know/gardens/tour-through-the-park/neptune-fountain.html |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commissioned by Empress [[Maria Theresa]], work on the fountain began in 1776 and was completed within four years, just prior to the death of the empress.&lt;ref name="neptune"/&gt; The overall design was done by Johann Ferdinand Hetzendorf von Hohenberg; the marble sculptural group was executed by Wilhelm Beyer.&lt;ref name="neptune"/&gt;

The retaining wall of the ''Neptune Fountain'' merges into the slope of the Gloriette hill and includes a balustrade adorned with ornate vases. From a projecting semi-oval [[plinth]], a rocky formation emerges with the sea-god [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] and his entourage. The plinth is segmented by panels decorated with masks and separated and embellished with garlands.&lt;ref name="neptune"/&gt; Neptune stands atop the grotto at the center of the figure group in a shell-shaped chariot holding a trident. A nymph is seated to his left. The sea-goddess [[Thetis]] kneels to his right, asking the sea god to favor her son [[Achilles]] on his voyage to Troy.&lt;ref name="neptune"/&gt;

Appearing at the base of the grotto are four [[Triton (mythology)|tritons]]—creatures who are half-man and half-fish—who are part of the sea-god's entourage. Each holds a conch shell trumpet with which they can inspire fear. They are restraining the sea-horses who draw Neptune's chariot across the seas.&lt;ref name="neptune"/&gt; This image of Neptune commanding the watery dominion was a common symbol in sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth-century art, to represent monarchs controlling the fate of their people.&lt;ref name="neptune"/&gt; In the nineteenth century, a bank of evergreen trees was planted behind the white figural group to provide a dark contrast.&lt;ref name="neptune"/&gt;

|The original well house at this location was built by the court gardener Steckhoven.&lt;ref name="schöner"&gt;{{cite web|title=Schöner Brunnen |work=Schloß Schönbrunn |url=http://www.schoenbrunn.at/en/things-to-know/gardens/tour-through-the-park/schoener-brunnen.html |accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1771, it was replaced by a square pavilion designed by Isidor Canevale, the court architect.&lt;ref name="schöner"/&gt; The pavilion contains open semi-circular arches at the front and back of the structure. The back arch frames the figure of [[Egeria (mythology)|Egeria]] seated above a small shell basin. She is holding a vase under her right arm, and from that vase flows spring water. Egeria was a water-nymph to whom pregnant women offered sacrifices to ensure easy births.&lt;ref name="howatson-205"&gt;Howatson 1989, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; She was also the divine consort and counselor of [[Numa Pompilius]], the second [[king of Rome]], to whom she gave laws and rituals pertaining to the [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]]. Her name is an [[eponym]] for female advisor or counselor.&lt;ref name="howatson-205"/&gt; The work was executed by Johann Wilhelm Beyer.&lt;ref name="schöner"/&gt; The corners of the room are decorated with sculpted sheaves of reeds, and the ceilings are embellished with flowers. A stone plaque bearing the initial "M" commemorates Emperor [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias]], who discovered at this site the Schöner Brunnen (''Beautiful Fountain'').&lt;ref name="schöner"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11114">The '''Second Congress on the French Language in Canada''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Deuxième Congrès de la langue française au Canada'') was held at [[Université Laval]] in [[Quebec City]] from June 27 to July 1, 1937. The 8,000 congress members&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.francoidentitaire.ca/quebec/texte/T3238.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; conclude the event with the formulation of 46 vows.

== Organization ==
[[File:Camille Roy.png|thumb|200px|[[Camille Roy]], rector of Université Laval and president of the Second Congress on the French Language in Canada.]]To commemorate the 25th anniversary of the [[First Congress on the French Language in Canada|Congress of 1912]], the [[Société du parler français au Canada|Société du parler français]] organized a second congress in Quebec City between June 27 and July 1, 1937. 

This second congress used the same formula as that of the first congress, with the exception that it was not planned to coincide with the festivities of the [[National Holiday (Quebec)|French-Canadian National Day]], but rather shortly after. The theme of the second congress was: "The French spirit in Canada, in our language, our laws, our habits" (''L'esprit français au Canada, dans notre langue, dans nos lois, dans nos mœurs'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=feBTrmnpjBEC ''Québec, 1900-2000'', p. 45]&lt;/ref&gt;

The organizing committee of the Congress, set up by the Société du parler français on May 8, 1936, was presided by Mgr [[Camille Roy]], president of the Society and rector of [[Université Laval]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3uHhO1uGh-0C Le deuil d'un pays imaginé], p. 35-36&lt;/ref&gt; It is also Camille Roy who presided the executive office of the organizing committee.&lt;ref&gt;The other officers were: [[Cyrille Gagnon]], [[Arthur Vallée]] and [[Louis-Philippe Geofrrion]], vice-presidents; [[Antonio Langlais]], secretary general; [[Aimé Labrie]], [[Roméo Blanchet]] and [[Paul-Émile Gosselin]], assistant secretaries; [[Maurice Laliberté]], treasurer; [[Oscar Bergeron]], assistant tresurer.&lt;/ref&gt; The executive office set up committees on finance, propaganda, reception, and religious ceremony as well as various sub-committees. 

An honorary committee was instituted to add to the prestige of the event. The members of this committee were the most visible State and Church officials of Quebec: the [[archbishop of Quebec]] [[Jean-Marie-Rodrigue Villeneuve]] as patron of the Congress; the [[Lieutenant Governor of Quebec]] [[Ésioff-Léon Patenaude]] as honorary president; the [[premier of Quebec]] [[Maurice Duplessis]], the federal minister of justice [[Ernest Lapointe]] and the [[List of mayors of Quebec City|mayor of Quebec]] [[Joseph-Ernest Grégoire]] as honorary vice-presidents.

The [[Académie française]] delegated the novelist and essayist [[Louis Bertrand (novelist)|Louis Bertrand]] to the event.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DxiL9miqO_EC 1902-2002, la Société du parler français au Canada cent ans après sa fondation], p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

In virtue of article III of the rules of the Congress, were invited to participate all "French Canadians, Acadians and Franco-Americans" and their various institutions, admitted as either protective members, beneficiary members, donating members, or fellow members. "Foreign persons or corporations" could also adhere to the Congress with the title of observer. Delegates from [[Haïti]] were in fact present to the event.

Upon registering, congress members received a membership card granting room access, a copy of the programme and the ribbon of the Congress. It was also possible to buy a button of the Congress for 10 cents and a badge medal (the work of [[Marius Plamondon]]) for 75 cents.

The sessions of the Congress were held at the [[Colisée de Québec]], in several buildings of Université Laval, at the [[Palais de Justice de Québec]] and the [[Palais Montcalm]].

== Progression ==
The programme of the Congress of 1937 closely resembled that of 1912, but was more sophisticated. Contained within a general programme of six days, from Sunday June 27 to Friday July 2, which included masses, breakfasts, receptions, banquets and concerts, tours, there was a programme of six public sessions, two general assemblies, 23 sessions by the four study sections, and diverse special programmes (children day, ladies day, youth day).

The seven vows of the language section expressed the desire of congress members to see that the [[phonetic]] and [[elocution]] of the students' speech improve by their methodical teaching and by the particular care which teachers must give to their own [[diction]]; that a program of studies on the spoken language of Franco-Americans be set up; that a greater number of local and regional history societies be founded; that libraries be more numerous and more furnished; that the language of advertising improve and be in proper French; that scientific reviews be better supported and encouraged; that a Board on the French language in Canada (''Office de la langue française au Canada'') be set up, with the mandate to examine and correct commercial signs, posters, and brochures.

The three vows of the arts section pertained to the promotion of art appreciation among workers by conferences, projections, etc.; that the culture of letters be developed, especially by encouraging "our own writers"; that the teaching of drawing be developed in schools.

The five wishes of the section on laws dealt with the conservation of the French spirit of laws and interpretation methods; that a commission be set up to revise all laws of Quebec to conform to the French spirit, in a concise, logical and methodical redaction; that the translation of federal laws (which were all in English) improve and that translations "no longer be restrained to literal translation"; that the rights of the French language be recognized in all of Canada and that the rights of francophone minorities to preserve their language by learning it in school be recognized in all of North America;

The other vows (from the 16th to 46th) were formulated by the section on habits and pertained to the promotion of professional associations, parish schools in the United States, the quality of French in the press and radio, solidarity among francophone groups, the organization of a Congress on Economics, the creation of a linguistic information office (terminology, translation), that Canada and Haïti establish press relations to better know each other, as well as items dear to the catholic clergy: fighting communism and discouraging marriage between Catholics and Protestants. 

The participants to the ladies session wished that taste for poetry be cultivated among the young people, that French-language feminine associations be created in Canada and the United States, that the education of women be modernized, that children literature be developed, etc. The participants to the youth session wished that libraries contain books appropriate to young age and also that youth movements develop.

On the first of July, the Permanent Committee of the Congresses on the French Language in Canada (''Comité permanent des Congrès de la langue française en Amérique''), which was inactive since 1920, was reactivated. It was composed of 20 members responsible to publish the account of the Congress's sittings and to see that the vows it has formulated become reality. In 1939, the Committee took the name of ''[[Conseil de la vie française en Amérique|Comité de la survivance française en Amérique]]'' and it is under this name that it was incorporated in 1940.

'''Tel Anafa''' ({{lang-he|תל אנפה}}, lit. "Egret hill" {{lang-ar|تل الأخضر|Tel el-Hader}}, lit. "The green hill") is an archaeological site and nature reserve in the [[Upper Galilee]], [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jposttravel.com/north_tours/monumentalnorth.0810.html|title=A monumental north|first=Aviva|last=Bar'am|publisher=JPost.com » Israel Travel Guide|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106051934/http://www.jposttravel.com/north_tours/monumentalnorth.0810.html|archivedate=2009-01-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Tel Anafa was inhabited from the Early Bronze Age through the early Roman period, but most of the significant archaeological remains are from the Hellenistic period.&lt;ref name="Kelsey"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lsa-cms1.lsa.umich.edu/umich/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=b3f08c4e0ad08110VgnVCM100000a3b1d38dRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=dab12fd8f3904110VgnVCM1000003d01010aRCRD&amp;assetNameBegin=Tel+AnafaassetNameEnd&amp;highlightChannelBegin=dab12fd8f3904110VgnVCM1000003d01010aRCRDhighlightChannelEnd&amp;linkTypeBegin=contentlinkTypeEnd|title=Tel Anafa|publisher=[[Kelsey Museum of Archaeology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ancientneareast.tripod.com/Anafa.html|title=Ancient Tel Anafa|publisher=The History of the Ancient Near East Electronic Compendium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late Hellenistic period, 125-80 BCE, the site was occupied by a large building with a central courtyard. The site was abandoned after 80 BCE and resettled in the last decade of the century. This early Roman phase continued until the mid 1st century CE when the site was abandoned once again. Coins and amphora handles from the late 4th to the 2nd century were unearthed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ancientneareast.tripod.com/Anafa.html Ancient Tel Anafa]&lt;/ref&gt;

The land on which it is situated has since 1984 been part of an 11-[[dunam]] nature reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of National Parks and Nature Reserves|url=http://parks.org.il/sigalit/muchrazim.pdf|language=Hebrew|publisher=Israel Nature and Parks Authority|accessdate=2010-10-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007095221/http://parks.org.il/sigalit/muchrazim.pdf|archivedate=2009-10-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Book of Mirdad''''' is an allegorical book of philosophy by Lebanese author [[Mikha'il Na'ima]]. The book was first published in Lebanon in 1948 and was initially written in English, with Na'ima later translating it into Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boullata|first=Issa J.|title=Mikhail Naimy: Poet of Meditative Vision|journal=Journal of Arabic Literature|date=July 1993|volume= 24|issue= 2|page=175|doi=10.1163/157006493x00041|jstor=4183302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Na'ima initially sought to have the book published in London, where it was rejected for "[advancing] a religion with 'a new dogma'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matar|first=Nabil I.|title=Adam and the Serpent: Notes on the Theology of Mikhail Naimy|journal=Journal of Arabic Literature|year=1980|volume= 11|pages=56–61|doi=10.1163/157006480x00045|jstor=4183028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 the book was adapted into a three-act play by Padukone Ramanand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramanand|first=Padukone|title=Mirdad: Mikhail Naimy's Famous Work 'The Book of Mirdad' Made Into a Play in Three Acts|year=1973|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Mirdad_Mikhail_Naimy_s_Famous_Work_The_B.html?id=DuHNiWmguwEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The book is presented as a series of dialogues between Mirdad, the abbot of a monastery, and his disciples. ''The Book of Mirdad'' draws on a variety of philosophies, including that of [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Sufi Islam]]. Through the allegories in the book presented by Mirdad, Na'ima presents several themes and calls for the unity of different people groups in universal love, as well as criticizing materialism and empty religious rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Aida Imangulieva|title=Gibran, Rihani &amp; Naimy: East-West Interactions in Early Twentieth-Century Arab Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OWH62rLHcg8C&amp;pg=PA153|year=2010|publisher=Anqa Publishing|isbn=978-1-905937-27-1|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mirdad's dialogs gives out teachings which show us how it is possible to transform our consciousness and uncover the God within, by dissolving our sense of duality. The Book of Mirdad is ranked among the great religious classics of the twentieth century and a must have constant companion of any spiritual seeker.

==Reception==
A reviewer for ''[[Philosophy East and West]]'' praised the book, citing Na'ima's "power of enthusiasm and persuasion" as a highlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scaligero|first=Massimo|title=Review: The Book of Mirdad, A Lighthouse and a Haven by Mikhail Naimy|journal=Philosophy East and West|date=March 1960|volume= 11|issue= 1|pages=54–55|jstor=29754226}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian mystic [[Rajneesh|Osho]] mentioned ''The Book of Mirdad'' in his book ''A Song Without Words'', saying that it "can be of immense help if you don't expect, and it is a book worth reading thousands of times."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Osho|title=A Song Without Words|year=2006|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books|isbn=8171827357|pages=130, 140, 143|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ii6_XQlvv3UC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=The+Book+of+Mirdad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OHCoUOnwDorn0QH--ICAAg&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Book%20of%20Mirdad&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Book of Mirdad is considered a masterpiece of spiritual wisdom to rank alongside [[The Prophet (book)|The Prophet]]. The book has been compared to [[John Bunyan|John Bunyan's]] ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' in that both stories are largely allegorical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al Maleh|first=Layla|title=Arab Voices in Diaspora: Critical Perspectives on Anglophone Arab Literature|year=2009|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=9042027185|pages=3, 61, 430|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ji1YrUwThkIC&amp;pg=PA430&amp;dq=%22The+Book+of+Mirdad%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MzgOTrydIYjIhAeH9eyADg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20Book%20of%20Mirdad%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Book of Mirdad'' has also been compared to [[Ameen Rihani|Ameen Rihani's]] ''[[The Book of Khalid]]'', with the book being believed to have had an influence on Na'ima's writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schumann|first=Christoph|title=Liberal Thought in the Eastern Mediterranean|year=2008|publisher=Brill Publishers|isbn=9004165487|page=244|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kgfVNLWuy80C&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=%22Book+of+Mirdad%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2HKoUIaSL4-40AGwrYHABQ&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Book%20of%20Mirdad%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Na'ima has described the work as the "pinnacle of his thought and a summary of his view of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Roger|title=Essays in Arabic Literary Biography III: 1850-1950|year=2010|publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=3447061413|pages=252, 260–261|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FAp1uVaBaQIC&amp;pg=PA261&amp;dq=%22The+Book+of+Mirdad%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MzgOTrydIYjIhAeH9eyADg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20Book%20of%20Mirdad%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Transit''' system, also known as '''NAVSAT''' or '''NNSS''' (for ''Navy Navigation Satellite System''), was the first [[satellite navigation system]] to be used operationally. The system was primarily  used by the [[U.S. Navy]] to provide accurate location information to its [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] [[ballistic missile submarine]]s, and it was also used as a navigation system by the Navy's [[surface ship]]s, as well as for [[hydrographic survey]] and [[geodetic surveying]]. Transit provided continuous navigation satellite service from 1964, initially for Polaris submarines and later for civilian use as well.

== History ==
[[File:Transit-o.jpg|thumb|left|Operational Transit satellite]]

The Transit satellite system, sponsored by the Navy and developed jointly by [[DARPA]] and the Johns Hopkins [[Applied Physics Laboratory]], under the leadership of Dr. Richard Kirschner at Johns Hopkins, was the first satellite-based geopositioning system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Transit to Tomorrow.

They were able to determine Sputnik's orbit by analyzing the [[Doppler shift]] of its radio signals during a single [[pass (spaceflight)|pass]].&lt;ref name=guier&gt;{{cite web |url=http://techdigest.jhuapl.edu/TD/td1901/guier.pdf |title=Genesis of Satellite Navigation |author=Guier &amp; Weiffenbach |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing the way forward for their research, their director Frank McClure, the chairman of APL's Research Center, suggested in March 1958 that if the satellite's position were known and predictable, the Doppler shift could be used to locate a receiver on Earth, and proposed a satellite system to implement this principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Legacy of Transit: Guest Editor’s Introduction by Vincent L. Pisacane, Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest, Vol 19, Number 1, 1998.| url=http://www.jhuapl.edu/techdigest/td/td1901/pisacane.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of the Transit system began in 1958, and a prototype satellite, '''Transit 1A''', was launched in September 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sd-www.jhuapl.edu/Transit/ |title=Navy Navigation Satellite System |publisher=APL}}&lt;/ref&gt; That satellite failed to reach orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=TRAN1 |title=Transit 1A - NSSDC ID: TRAN1 |publisher=NASA NSSDC}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second satellite, '''Transit 1B''', was successfully launched April 13, 1960, by a [[Thor-Ablestar]] rocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1960-003B |title=Transit 1B - NSSDC ID: 1960-003B |publisher=NASA NSSDC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first successful tests of the system were made in 1960, and the system entered Naval service in 1964.

The Chance Vought/LTV [[Scout (rocket family)|Scout]] rocket was selected as the dedicated launch vehicle for the program because it delivered a payload into orbit for the lowest cost per pound. However, the Scout decision imposed two design constraints. First, the weight of the earlier satellites was about 300&amp;nbsp;lb each, but the Scout launch capacity to the Transit orbit was about 120&amp;nbsp;lb (it was later increased significantly). A satellite mass reduction had to be achieved, despite a demand for more power than APL had previously designed into a satellite. The second problem concerned the increased vibration that affected the payload during launching because the Scout used solid rocket motors. Thus, electronic equipment that was smaller than before and rugged enough to withstand the increased vibration of launch had to be produced.
Meeting the new demands was more difficult than expected, but it was accomplished. The first prototype operational satellite (Transit 5A-1) was launched into a polar orbit by a Scout rocket on 18 December 1962.
The satellite verified a new technique for deploying the solar panels and for separating from the rocket, but otherwise it was not successful because of trouble with the power system. Transit 5A-2, launched on 5 April 1963, failed to achieve orbit. Transit 5A-3, with a redesigned power supply, was launched on 15 June 1963. A malfunction of the memory occurred during powered flight that kept it from accepting and storing the navigation message, and the oscillator stability was degraded during launch. Thus, 5A-3 could not be used for navigation. However, this satellite was the first to achieve [[gravity-gradient stabilization]], and its other subsystems performed well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://techdigest.jhuapl.edu/td/td1901/danchik.pdf |title=An Overview of Transit Development, by Robert J. Danchik. Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest, Volume 19, Number 1 (1998), pages 18–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveyors used Transit to locate remote [[Benchmark (surveying)|benchmarks]] by averaging dozens of Transit fixes, producing sub-meter accuracy{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}.  In fact, the elevation of [[Mount Everest]] was corrected in the late 1980s by using a Transit receiver to re-survey a nearby benchmark{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}.

Thousands of warships, freighters and private watercraft used Transit from 1967 until 1991. In the 1970s, the [[Soviet Union]] started launching their own satellite navigation system [[Parus (satellite)|''Parus'']] (military) / [[Tsikada]] (civilian), which is still in use today besides the next generation [[GLONASS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronautix.com/craft/tsikada.htm Encyclopedia Astronautica: Tsikada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522015121/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/tsikada.htm |date=2013-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Soviet warships were equipped with [[Motorola]] NavSat receivers.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The Transit system was made obsolete by the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS), and ceased navigation service in 1996. Improvements in electronics allowed GPS receivers to effectively take several fixes at once, greatly reducing the complexity of deducing a position. GPS uses many more satellites than were used with Transit, allowing the system to be used continuously, while Transit provided a fix only every hour or more.

After 1996, the satellites were kept in use for the Navy Ionospheric Monitoring System (NIMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jhuapl.edu/techdigest/td/td1901/tucker.pdf |title=Computerized Ionospheric Tomography, by Arnold J.

===Satellites===
The satellites (known as '''''OSCAR''''' or '''''NOVA''''' satellites) used in the system were placed in low [[polar orbit]]s, at an altitude of about 600 nautical miles (1,100&amp;nbsp;km), with an orbital period of about 106 minutes. A ''constellation'' of five satellites was required to provide reasonable global coverage. While the system was operational, at least ten satellites &amp;ndash; one spare for each satellite in the basic constellation &amp;ndash; were usually kept in orbit. Note that these ''OSCAR'' satellites were not the same as the [[OSCAR]] series of satellites that were devoted to use by [[amateur radio]] operators to use in [[satellite communications]].    
[[File:Transit-1A.jpg|thumb|right|Transit-1-Satellite Prototype]]
The orbits of the Transit satellites were chosen to cover the entire Earth; they crossed over the poles and were spread out at the equator. Since only one satellite was usually visible at any given time, fixes could be made only when one of the satellites was above the horizon. At the equator this delay between fixes was several hours; at mid-latitudes the delay decreased to an hour or two. For its intended role as an updating system for SLBM launch, Transit sufficed, since submarines took periodic fixes to reset their [[inertial guidance system]], but Transit lacked the ability to provide high-speed, real-time position measurements.

With later improvements, the system provided single-pass accuracy of roughly 200 meters, and also provided [[Time transfer|time synchronization]] to roughly 50 microseconds. Transit satellites also broadcast encrypted messages, although this was a secondary function.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

The Transit satellites used arrays of [[magnetic-core memory]] as mass data storage up to 32 kilobytes.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Determining ground location===
The basic operating principle of Transit is similar to the system used by [[emergency locator transmitter]]s, except that in the latter case the transmitter is on the ground and the receiver is in orbit.

Each Transit system satellite broadcast two UHF carrier signals that provided precise time hacks (every two minutes), plus the satellite's six [[orbital elements]] and orbit [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbation]] variables.  The orbit [[ephemeris]] and clock corrections were uploaded twice each day to each satellite from one of the four Navy tracking and injection stations.  This broadcast information allowed a ground receiver to calculate the location of the satellite at any point in time.  Use of two carrier frequencies permitted ground receivers to reduce navigation errors caused by ionospheric refraction. The Transit system also provided the first worldwide timekeeping service, allowing clocks everywhere to be synchronised with 50 microsecond accuracy.

The Transit satellite broadcast on 150 and 400&amp;nbsp;MHz.  The two frequencies were used to allow the refraction of the satellite radio signals by the ionosphere to be canceled out, thereby improving location accuracy.

The critical information that allowed the receiver to compute location was a unique frequency curve caused by the [[Doppler effect]].  The Doppler effect caused an apparent compression of the carrier's wavelength as the satellite approached the receiver, and stretching of wavelengths as the satellite receded.  The spacecraft traveled at about 17,000&amp;nbsp;mph, which could increase or decrease the frequency of the received carrier signal by as much as 10&amp;nbsp;kHz. This Doppler curve was unique for each location within line-of-sight of the satellite.  For instance, the earth's rotation caused the ground receiver to move toward or away from the satellite's orbit, creating a non-symmetric Doppler shift for approach and recession, allowing the receiver to determine whether it was east or west of the satellite's north-south [[ground track]].

Calculating the most likely receiver location was not a trivial exercise.   The navigation software used the satellite's motion to compute a 'trial' Doppler curve, based on an initial 'trial' location for the receiver.  The software would then perform a [[least squares]] curve fit for each two-minute section of the Doppler curve, recursively moving the trial position until the trial Doppler curve 'most closely' matched the actual Doppler received from the satellite for all two-minute curve segments.

If the receiver was also moving relative to the earth, such as aboard a ship or airplane, this would cause mismatches with the idealized Doppler curves, and degrade position accuracy.  However, positional accuracy could usually be computed to within 100&amp;nbsp;meters for a slow-moving ship, even with reception of just one two-minute Doppler curve.  This was the navigation criterion demanded by the U.S. Navy, since American submarines would normally expose their UHF antenna for only 2&amp;nbsp;minutes to obtain a usable Transit fix.  The U.S. submarine version of the Transit system also included a special encrypted, more accurate version of the downloaded satellite's orbital data{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} This enhanced data allowed for considerably enhanced system accuracy [not unlike [[Selective Availability]] (SA) under GPS]. Using this enhanced mode, accuracy was typically less than 20 meters, i.e. the accuracy was between that of [[LORAN C]] and GPS. Certainly, Transit was the most accurate navigation system of its day.

===Determining the satellite orbits===
A network of ground stations, whose locations were accurately known, continually tracked the Transit satellites.  They measured the Doppler shift and transferred the data to 5-hole paper tape.  This data was sent to the Satellite Control Center at Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland using commercial and military teleprinter networks. The data from the fixed ground stations provided the location information on the Transit satellite orbit.  Locating a Transit satellite in earth orbit from a known ground station using the Doppler shift is simply the reverse of using the known location of the satellite in orbit to locate an unknown location on the earth, again using the Doppler shift .

A typical ground station occupied a small [[Quonset hut]].  The accuracy of the ground station measurements was a function of the ground station master clock accuracy.  Initially a quartz oscillator in a temperature controlled [[Crystal oven|oven]] was used as the master clock.  The master clock was checked daily for drift using a VLF receiver tuned to a US Navy VLF station.  The VLF signal had the property that the phase of the VLF signal did not change from day to day at noon along the path between the transmitter and the receiver and thus could be used to measure oscillator drift.  Later [[Rubidium standard|rubidium]] and [[Caesium standard|cesium beam]] clocks were used.  Ground stations had number names; for example, Station 019 was McMurdo Station, Antarctica.  For many years during the 1970s this station was staffed by a graduate student and an undergraduate student, typically in electrical engineering, from the University of Texas at Austin. Other stations were located at New Mexico State University, the University of Texas at Austin, Sicily, Japan, Seychelles Island, Thule Greenland and a number of other locations.  The Greenland and Antarctica stations saw every pass of every Transit satellite because of their near pole location for these polar orbiting satellites.

===Portable Geoceiver=== &lt;!-- Target of Geoceiver redirect --&gt;
A portable version of the ground station was called a Geoceiver and was used to make field measurements.  This receiver, power supply, punched tape unit, and antennas could fit in a number of padded aluminum cases and could be shipped as extra cargo on an airline.  Data was taken over a period of time, typically a week, and sent back to the Satellite Control Center for processing.  Therefore, unlike GPS, there was not an immediate accurate location of the Geoceiver location.  A Geoceiver was permanently located at the South Pole Station and operated by United States Geological Survey personnel. Since it was located on the surface of a moving ice sheet, its data was used to measure the ice sheet movement.  Other Geoceivers were taken out in the field in Antarctica during the summer and were used to measure locations, for example the movement of the [[Ross Ice Shelf]].

=== The AN/UYK-1 (TRW-130) Computer ===
[[File:NNSS (5 Polarbahnen).png|thumb|left|Orbits of the five Transit Satellites (text in German.)]]
{{one source section|date=August 2015}}
Since no computer small enough to fit through a submarine's hatch existed (in 1958), a new computer was designed, named the AN/UYK-1 (TRW-130).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TRW-130 documents |url=http://bitsavers.org/pdf/trw/trw-130 |website=bitsavers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was built with rounded corners to fit through the hatch and was about five feet tall and sealed to be waterproof. The principal design engineer was then-UCLA-faculty-member Lowell Amdahl, brother of [[Gene Amdahl]]. The AN/UYK-1 was built by the [[TRW Inc.|Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://bitsavers.org/pdf/trw/trw-130/M250-2U19_AN_UYK-1_RefMan_Feb63.pdf AN/UYK-1 Machine Reference Manual]  at Bitsavers&lt;/ref&gt; (later TRW) for the [[Lafayette class submarine|''Lafayette'' class]] SSBNs. It was equipped with 8,192 words of 15-bit [[core memory]] plus [[parity bit]], threaded by hand at their Canoga Park factory. Cycle time was about one [[microsecond]]. The AN/UYK-1 weighed about {{convert|550|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/BRL64-t.html#TRW-230-130-AN/UYK-1|title=TRW 230 130 AN/UYK 1|last=Weik|first=Martin H.|date=Jan 1964|website=ed-thelen.org|series=A Fourth Survey of Domestic Electronic Digital Computing Systems|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AN/UYK-1 was a [[Microcode|microprogrammed]] machine with a 15-bit word length that lacked hardware commands to subtract, multiply or divide, but could add, shift, form [[ones' complement]], and test the carry bit. Instructions to perform standard fixed and floating point operations were software subroutines and programs were lists of links and operators to those subroutines.  For example, the "subtract" subroutine had to form the ones' complement of the subtrahend and add it.  Multiplication required successive shifting and conditional adding.

In the AN/UYK-1 instruction set, the machine-language instructions had two operators that could simultaneously manipulate the arithmetic registers—for example, complementing the contents of one register while loading or storing another.  It may have been the first computer that implemented a single-cycle indirect addressing ability.

During a satellite pass, a GE receiver would receive the orbital parameters and encrypted messages from the satellite, as well as measure the Doppler-shifted frequency at intervals and provide this data to the AN/UYK-1 computer. The computer would also receive from the ship's inertial navigation system (SINS) a reading of latitude and longitude. Using this information the AN/UYK-1 ran the [[least squares]] algorithm and provided a location reading in about fifteen minutes.

== Other satellites ==

There were 37 other satellites in the Transit series that were assigned the '''Transit''' name by NASA.&lt;ref&gt;NSSDC Master Catalog [http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/SpacecraftQuery.jsp] Search for 'Transit'&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transit 3B]] demonstrated uploading programs into the onboard computer's memory whilst in orbit.

Transit 4A, launched June 29, 1961, was the first satellite to use a [[Radioisotope thermoelectric generator|radioactive power source]] (RTG) (a [[SNAP-3]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/12118-space-nuclear-power-50-years-transit-4a.html David, Leonard "50 Years of Nuclear-Powered Spacecraft: It All Started with Satellite Transit 4A" (June 29, 2011) Space.com’s Space Insider Column] Retrieved July 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Transit 4B (1961) also had a SNAP-3 RTG. Transit 4B was among several satellites which were inadvertently damaged or destroyed in a nuclear explosion, specifically the United States [[Starfish Prime]] [[high-altitude nuclear explosion|high-altitude nuclear test]] on July 9, 1962 and subsequent [[List of artificial radiation belts|radiation belt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1961-031A |title=Transit 4B - NSSDC ID: 1961-031A |publisher=NASA NSSDC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transit 5A3 and Transit 5B-1 (1963) each had a [[SNAP-3]] [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator|RTG]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1963-022A Transit-5A3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1963-038B Transit-5B1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Transit 5B-2 (1963) had a [[SNAP-9A]] RTG.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1963-049B Transit-5B2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Transit-9 and 5B4 (1964) and Transit-5B7 and 5B6 (1965) each had "a nuclear power source".

The [[US Air Force]] also periodically launched short lived satellites equipped with radio beacons of 162&amp;nbsp;MHz and 324&amp;nbsp;MHz at much lower orbits to study [[satellite drag|orbital drag]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}  The Transit ground tracking stations tracked these satellites as well, locating the satellites within their orbits using the same principles.  The satellite location data was used to collect orbital drag data, including variations in the upper atmosphere and the Earth's gravitational field.

The '''trillion dollar coin''' is a concept that emerged during the [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011|United States debt-ceiling crisis]] in 2011, as a proposed way to bypass any necessity for the [[United States Congress]] to raise the [[United States debt ceiling|country's borrowing limit]], through the minting of very high-value [[platinum coin]]s. The concept gained more mainstream attention by late 2012 during the debates over the [[United States fiscal cliff]] negotiations and renewed debt-ceiling discussions. After reaching the headlines during the week of January 7, 2013, use of the [[trillion (short scale)|trillion]] dollar coin concept was ultimately rejected by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury.&lt;ref name="rejection" /&gt; Five days later, Senate Minority Whip [[John Cornyn]] announced that Senate Republicans would end their threat to block an increase in the debt ceiling.&lt;ref name="The Huffington Post"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/18/john-cornyn-debt-ceiling_n_2502358.html |title=John Cornyn: We Will Raise The Debt Ceiling |publisher=The Huffington Post |accessdate=February 16, 2013 |date=January 18, 2013 |first=Luke |last=Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal basis==
[[File:2005 AEPlat Proof Obv.png|thumb|Common [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] of [[American Platinum Eagle]] coins, a platinum commemorative United States coin that has been issued in denominations of up to $100 under the authority of 31 U.S.C. Section 5112.]]

The issuance of paper currency is subject to various accounting and quantity restrictions that platinum coinage is not. According to the [[United States Mint]], coinage is accounted for as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasury.gov/about/budget-performance/Documents/20%20-%20FY%202013%20US%20Mint%20CJ.pdf United States Mint FY 2013 President's Budget Submission] ''[[United States Department of the Treasury]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Since Fiscal Year (FY) 1996, the Mint has operated under the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund (PEF). As authorized by Public Law 104-52 (codified at {{UnitedStatesCode|31|5136}}), the PEF eliminates the need for appropriations. Proceeds from the sales of circulating coins to the Federal Reserve Banks (FRB), bullion coins to authorized purchasers, and numismatic items to the public and other customers are paid into the PEF and provide the funding for Mint operations. All circulating, bullion and numismatic operating expenses and capital investments incurred for the Mint's operations and programs are paid out of the PEF. By law, all funds in the PEF are available without fiscal year limitation. Revenues determined to be in excess of the amount required by the PEF are transferred to the United States Treasury General Fund as off-budget and on-budget receipts. Off-budget receipts consist of seigniorage, the difference between the receipts from the Federal Reserve System from the sale of circulating coins at face value and the full costs of minting and distributing circulating coins. Seigniorage is deposited periodically to the General Fund where it reduces the government's need to borrow.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The concept of striking a trillion dollar coin that would generate one trillion dollars in [[seigniorage]], which would be off-budget, or numismatic profit, which would be on-budget, and be transferred to the Treasury, is based on the authority granted by Section {{UnitedStatesCode|31|5112}} of the [[United States Code]] for the Treasury Department to "mint and issue platinum bullion coins" in any denominations the Secretary of the Treasury may choose. Thus, if the Treasury were to mint one trillion dollar coins, it could deposit such coins at the Federal Reserve's Treasury account instead of issuing new debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57563428/whats-up-with-the-$1-trillion-coin/ |title=What's Up With The Trillion Dollar Coin? |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=February 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington Post"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/08/former-head-of-u-s-mint-the-platinum-coin-option-would-work/ |title=Former Head of U.S. Mint: The Platinum Coin Option Would Work |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate=February 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/3-huge-myths-about-the-plan-to-save-the-economy-with-a-trillion-dollar-platinum-coin-2013 |title=13 Huge Myths About The Trillion Dollar Coin Plan To Save The Economy |publisher=Business Insider |accessdate=February 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-03/why-we-must-go-off-the-platinum-coin-cliff.html |title=Why We Must Go Off the Platinum Coin Cliff |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=February 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

31 U.S.C. 5112(k) as originally enacted by Public Law 104-208 in 1996:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Secretary may mint and issue bullion and proof platinum coins in accordance with such specifications, designs, varieties, quantities, denominations, and inscriptions as the Secretary, in the Secretary's discretion, may prescribe from time to time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2000, the word "bullion" was replaced with "platinum bullion coins".&lt;ref name="postcastle1"/&gt;

Platinum bullion coins can, by this statute, be minted in any denomination, whereas coins in any other specified metal are restricted to amounts of $50, $25, $10, $5 and $1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5112|title=31 USC 5112|publisher=Cornell Law|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the origin of the concept of minting a very high denomination coin, since the platinum clause provides the only loophole.

[[Philip N. Diehl]], former director of the [[United States Mint]] and with Republican Congressman [[Michael Castle]] co-author of the platinum coin law, has said the procedure would be permitted by the statute.&lt;ref name="Washington Post"/&gt; However, Castle says he never intended such a use. The platinum coinage provision was eventually passed by a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congress over the objections of a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Treasury in 1996.&lt;ref name="postcastle1"&gt;Matthews, Dylan (January 4, 2013).

==Emergence of the concept==
The idea for the Treasury Department to mint a coin and send it to the Federal Reserve in order to pay off the debt was first popularized by Populist Presidential Candidate [[Bo Gritz]] in 1992.

"Beowulf" would later tell ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine that the coin idea came from a December 2009 ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' article that talked about how several people were able to generate [[Frequent-flyer program|frequent-flyer]] miles at no cost by ordering coins from the U.S. Mint with a credit card offering mileage rewards and then depositing the coins at a bank to pay off the credit card debt.&lt;ref&gt;Scott McCartney (December 7, 2009), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB126014168569179245 Miles for Nothing: How the Government Helped Frequent Fliers Make a Mint] ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that he was inspired by a 2008 book, ''Web of Debt'', by Ellen Brown, which quoted a former Treasury official who said the government could order the printing of large coins to pay off the national debt. "Beowulf" said the trillion dollar coin idea is more rightly attributed to a small discussion group than to an individual, adding that the group was "just in it for the lulz" (for personal amusement).&lt;ref&gt;Ryan Tate (January 10, 2013), [https://www.wired.com/business/2013/01/trillion-dollar-coin-inventor/ Meet the Genius Behind the Trillion-Dollar Coin and the Plot to Breach the Debt Ceiling] ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis and reaction==
Some commentators have argued that although the concept may be strictly legal, it would weaken the [[checks and balances]] system of U.S. government even if the spending that the minting of the coin would allow has already been authorized by Congress. Journalist [[Megan McArdle]] wrote that "minting a $1 trillion coin neatly end-runs GOP obstructionists, but only by proving that the president himself has little respect for the institutional restraints on his office."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Should the President Mint a $1,000,000,000,000 Platinum Coin?|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/01/07/should-the-president-mint-a-1-000-000-000-000-platinum-coin.html|date=January 7, 2013|first=Megan|last=McArdle|authorlink=Megan McArdle|publisher=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=January 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another journalist, [[Felix Salmon]], wrote that the concept "would effectively mark the demise of the three-branch system of government, by allowing the executive branch to simply steamroller the rights and privileges of the legislative branch". Salmon went on to explain that he does not agree with what Congressional Republicans are doing, but they have a right to do that, and the president should not use the trillion dollar coin option to circumvent them. In Salmon's words, "Yes, the legislature is behaving like a bunch of utter morons if they think that driving the US government into default is a good idea. But it's their ''right'' to behave like a bunch of utter morons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why we won't mint a platinum coin|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2013/01/07/why-we-wont-mint-a-platinum-coin/|date=January 7, 2013|accessdate=January 9, 2013|first=Felix|last=Salmon|authorlink=Felix Salmon|publisher=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, many economists and business analysts endorsed the coin as a way to counter threats by congressional Republicans to force the country into default by refusing to raise the debt limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323706704578228072822313666?mod=rss_US_News |title=Joke Solution to Debt Clash Gets Serious Study |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=February 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-07/why-platinum-coin-opponents-are-all-wrong.html |title=Why Platinum Coin Opponents Are All Wrong |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=February 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/suddenly-lots-of-influential-people-are-talking-about-the-trillion-dollar-coin-idea-to-save-the-economy-2013-1 |title=Suddenly Lots of Influential People Are Talking about the Trillion Dollar Coin Idea to Save the Economy |publisher=Business Insider |accessdate=February 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pragcap.com/lets-end-this-debt-ceiling-debate-with-a-1-oz-1t-coin |title=Let's End this Debt Ceiling Debate with a 1 oz. 1t Coin |publisher=Pragmatic Capitalism |accessdate=February 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/01/the-trillion-dollar-coin-compromise-everybody-can-support/267002/# |title=The Trillion Dollar Coin Compromise Everybody Can Support |publisher=The Atlantic |accessdate=February 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Krugman]] said "So minting the coin would be undignified, but so what? At the same time, it would be economically harmless — and would both avoid catastrophic economic developments and help head off government by blackmail." He also declared the trillion dollar coin debate to be "the most important fiscal policy debate of our lifetimes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/rage-against-the-coin/ |title=Rage Against the Coin |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=February 16, 2013 |date=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Steel, spokesperson of House Speaker [[John Boehner]], dismissed the concept by comparing it to a ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' episode called "[[The Trouble with Trillions]]", which aired 13 years before the [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011|United States debt-ceiling crisis]], in which [[Homer Simpson]] is on a mission in search of a missing trillion dollar bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2013/01/04/john_boehner_not_entirely_convinced_by_platinum_coin_solution.html|title=John Boehner Not Entirely Convinced by "Platinum Coin" Solution|date=January 4, 2013|first=David|last=Weigel|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|authorlink=David Weigel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 7, 2013, Republican congressman [[Greg Walden]] announced he would introduce a bill to close the platinum coin loophole.&lt;ref name="polit"&gt;Cervantes, Bobby (January 7, 2013).

Rep. Walden said that the intention is to "take the proposal off the table". The bill is opposed by New York representative [[Jerry Nadler]], who says that the idea remains a valid option.&lt;ref name="marketwatch"&gt;Schroeder, Robert (January 7, 2013).

On January 12, 2013, the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]] and [[Federal Reserve]] announced they would not mint a platinum coin, and five days later, Senate Minority Whip [[John Cornyn]] (R-Texas) announced that Senate Republicans would end their threat to block an increase in the debt ceiling.&lt;ref name="rejection"&gt;{{cite news|last=Morath|first=Eric|title=Treasury Won't Mint Platinum Coin to Avoid Debt Ceiling|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324581504578238113719321432|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=January 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Huffington Post"/&gt;

==Inflation risks==
{{see also|Quantitative easing#Risks}}
The [[Federal Reserve]]'s purchase of the trillion dollar coin would be largely analogous to the securities purchases that are part of [[quantitative easing]] (QE), in both cases adding to the [[monetary base]], which is the sum of currency in circulation and bank reserves.&lt;ref name="EconomistJan12"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21569413-crackpot-idea-circumvent-americas-debt-ceiling-gains-currency-toss-coin/ |title=A crackpot idea to circumvent America's debt ceiling gains currency | work=[[The Economist]] |date=January 12, 2013 |quote=In economic terms the Fed's purchase would resemble "quantitative easing" (QE), in which it prints money to buy bonds ... does not become part of the monetary base until the Treasury spends it, and it ends up in a commercial bank's reserves at the Federal Reserve.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StLouFed"&gt;[http://research.stlouisfed.org/pageone-economics/uploads/newsletter/2011/201104_ClassroomEdition.pdf Quantitative Easing Explained] ''[[Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis]]'' April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the coin, commercial bank reserves would increase as the Treasury spent the proceeds from the coin's purchase by the Federal Reserve.&lt;ref name="EconomistJan12"/&gt; If banks loan out these reserves, the [[money supply]] increases and if the money supply increases too rapidly, the economy could [[Overheating (economics)|overheat]], adding to [[inflation]] and increasing expectations of future inflation.&lt;ref name="StLouFed"/&gt; In April 2011 a paper published by the [[Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis|St Louis Federal Reserve Bank]] said "some believe QE will sharply increase inflation rates; however, these fears are not consistent with economic theory and empirical evidence — assuming the Federal Reserve is both willing and able to reverse QE as the recovery gains momentum." The paper added that "if the public trusts that the increase in the monetary base QE creates is only temporary, then they will not expect rapid inflation in the near future. These expectations collectively influence actual pricing behavior and, in turn, actual inflation."&lt;ref name="StLouFed"/&gt; The Federal Reserve could ensure that commercial banks do not lend out excess reserves by paying interest on their reserves at the Fed so that the return commercial banks receive on them is greater than they could receive from alternative uses.&lt;ref name="EconomistJan12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StLouFed"/&gt; Finally, in the case of the coin, the Federal Reserve could also [[Sterilization (economics)|sterilize]] the government's spending of the coin by selling other assets from its balance sheet on a dollar-for-dollar basis, in which case the effect on the monetary base should net to zero.&lt;ref name="EconomistJan12"/&gt; If the debt ceiling were lifted, the Treasury could use borrowing to buy the coin back from the Federal Reserve and return it to the Mint to be melted.

===Independence of the Federal Reserve===
Although the Federal Reserve had already indicated on December 12, 2012, that it wished to expand its balance sheet by another $1.02 trillion throughout 2013 via its ongoing purchases of U.S. [[United States Treasury security|Treasuries]] and government-sponsored [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]],&lt;ref&gt;Craig Torres (January 3, 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-04/fed-debated-qe-end-in-2013-amid-concern-over-total-assets.html Fed Debated QE End in 2013 Amid Concern Over Total Assets] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''&lt;/ref&gt;{{synthesis-inline|date=January 2013}} [[Greg Ip]] has argued that if the Fed's balance sheet were expanded for ostensibly [[fiscal policy]] reasons instead of [[monetary policy]] reasons that could constitute an imposition on [[Central bank#Independence|independence of the central bank]]. Ip suggested that any such imposition could be avoided if the additional trillion in coinage were issued directly to the public (in more useful smaller denominations) instead of deposited with the Fed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/01/economics-platinum-coin-option The economics of the platinum coin option] ''[[The Economist]]'' January 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010 there was $40.4 billion in coin in circulation and about another $900 billion in [[banknote]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Louise L.

Former U.S. Mint Director [[Edmund C. Moy]] voiced doubts about whether the Federal Reserve could buy the coin to ''[[TheStreet.com]]'', which also noted that under the current system for initiating orders for coinage, the order might have to be placed by former Fed Chair [[Ben Bernanke]] or one of the 12 Presidents of the regional [[Federal Reserve Bank]]s. Former Director Diehl disagreed with Moy concerning a platinum bullion coin but agreed with Moy that a proof platinum coin would be a problem for the Fed. Diehl reiterated his view that "I certainly think [minting a trillion dollar coin] is inferior to raising or eliminating the [debt] limit but it's far better than defaulting and suffering the consequences of doing so."&lt;ref&gt;Joe Deaux (January 9, 2013), [http://www.thestreet.com/story/11808255/4/the-13-people-who-can-order-a-1-trillion-coin.html The 13 People Who Can Order a $1 Trillion Coin] ''[[TheStreet.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55100">The appearances of '''tropical cyclones in popular culture''' spans many genres of media and encompasses many different plot uses.

It includes both [[fiction]]al [[tropical cyclone]]s,{{efn|name=TropCyc}} and real ones used as the basis for a fictional work, and has proven to be of enough interest for the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] ("NOAA") to maintain a webpage on the topic.&lt;ref name="noaafaq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/J4.html|title=NOAA FAQ: What fictional books, plays, and movies have been written involving tropical cyclones?|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose in fiction and literature==
Although many forms of natural disaster appear in fiction and literature, tropical cyclones serve a number of useful literary functions because they are both extraordinarily powerful and, to those who have some experience with them, their occurrence can be portended several days in advance. The NOAA page notes that:

{{quote|There is undeniable drama to hurricanes; their massive scale affecting the lives of thousands, the foreshadowing of impending doom, and their ponderous pace as they approach the shore. This has made them ideal plot elements in many fictional works.&lt;ref name="noaafaq" /&gt;}}

The strength of the tropical cyclone has made it a device by which authors explain the upending of characters' lives, and even transformations of the personalities of those who live through such an event. Their somewhat hazy predictability also makes them a useful [[MacGuffin]], an impetus for characters to set to action. In some instances, the storm provides cover for characters to engage in covert behavior.

==Early history of tropical cyclones in literature==
One of the earliest uses of a tropical cyclone as a plot device occurs in a [[William Shakespeare]] play, ''[[The Tempest]]'', first performed in 1611 or 1612. There, a storm (raised by the sorcerer [[Prospero]]) blows key characters to the island to which Prospero had been exiled many years before. The theme is said to have been inspired by Shakespeare's knowledge of a real-life hurricane which had caused the shipwreck of the ''[[Sea Venture]]'' in 1609 on the islands of [[Bermuda]], while sailing toward [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name="noaafaq"/&gt;

[[Edgar Allan Poe]], in his 1841 story, "[[A Descent into the Maelström]]", has the main character describe how "the most terrible hurricane that ever came out of the heavens" forced the boat manned by himself and his brothers into a gigantic [[whirlpool]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource: A Descent into the Maelström]].&lt;/ref&gt; The trauma of surviving the storm and the whirlpool (and seeing the death of his brothers) is asserted to have a profound effect on the character, causing his hair to turn white. However, since the story is asserted to occur off the coast of [[Norway]], it is unlikely that the event described could have fallen within the formal definition of a hurricane, as such storms form almost exclusively in the [[Air mass#Classification|Maritime Tropical air masses]] of [[tropics|tropical]] regions of the globe.

[[Joseph Conrad]], in his acclaimed 1903 book ''[[Typhoon (novel)|Typhoon]]'', uses a tropical cyclone as a more direct element of the story, centering the plot on a ship captain's stubborn insistence on going into the heart of such a storm.&lt;ref name="noaafaq"/&gt;

'''Tulum''' ({{IPA-es|tuˈlum}}, [[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec]]: ''Tulu'um'') is the site of a [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] [[Defensive wall|walled city]] which served as a major port for [[Coba]], in the [[States of Mexico|Mexican state]] of [[Quintana Roo]].&lt;ref name="apub"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.ancient.eu/Tulum/ |title=Tulum |encyclopedia=Ancient History Encyclopedia |last=Cartwright |first=Mark |date=February 3, 2015 |access-date=January 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ruins]] are situated on {{convert|12|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} tall cliffs along the east coast of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] on the [[Caribbean Sea]] in the state of [[Quintana Roo]], Mexico.&lt;ref name=apub/&gt;  Tulum was one of the last cities built and inhabited by the Maya; it was at its height between the 13th and 15th centuries and managed to survive about 70 years after the Spanish began occupying Mexico. [[Old World]] diseases brought by the Spanish settlers appear to have resulted in very high fatalities, disrupting the society and eventually causing the city to be abandoned.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} One of the best-preserved coastal Maya sites, Tulum is today a popular site for [[Tourism|tourists]].

==History and description==
[[File:MX -Tulum.png|thumb|upright|Map of central Tulum]]

The site might have been called '''Zama''', meaning ''City of Dawn,'' because it faces the sunrise. Tulum stands on a bluff facing east toward the [[Caribbean Sea]]. ''Tulúm'' is also the Yucatán Mayan word for ''fence'', ''wall''&lt;ref name=apub/&gt; or ''trench.'' The walls surrounding the site allowed the Tulum fort to be defended against invasions. Tulum had access to both land and sea trade routes, making it an important trade hub, especially for [[obsidian]]. From numerous depictions in murals and other works around the site, Tulum appears to have been an important site for the worship of the Diving or Descending god.&lt;ref name=apub/&gt;

Tulum was first mentioned by [[Juan Díaz (Spanish conquistador)|Juan Díaz]], a member of [[Juan de Grijalva]]'s Spanish expedition of 1518, the first Europeans to spot Tulum.&lt;ref name=apub/&gt; The first detailed description of the ruins was published by [[John Lloyd Stephens]] and [[Frederick Catherwood]] in 1843 in the book ''Incidents of Travel in Yucatan''. As they arrived from the sea, Stephens and Catherwood first saw a tall building that impressed them greatly, most likely the great Castillo of the site. They made accurate maps of the site's walls, and Catherwood made sketches of the Castillo and several other buildings. Stephens and Catherwood also reported an early classic [[Tulum Stela 1|stele]] at the site, with an inscribed date of AD 564 (now in the [[British Museum]]'s collection). This has been interpreted as meaning that the stele was likely built elsewhere and brought to Tulum to be reused.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=657463&amp;partId=1&amp;place=13448&amp;plaA=13448-3-1&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

Work conducted at Tulum continued with that of [[Sylvanus Morley]] and George P. Howe, beginning in 1913. They worked to restore and open the public beaches. The work was continued by the [[Carnegie Institution]] from 1916 to 1922, Samuel Lothrop in 1924 who also mapped the site, Miguel Ángel Fernández in the late 1930s and early 1940s, [[William Sanders (archaeologist)|William Sanders]] in 1956, and then later in the 1970s by [[Arthur G. Miller]]. Through these later investigations done by Sanders and Miller, it has been determined that Tulum was occupied during the late [[Postclassic]] period around AD 1200. The site continued to be occupied until contact with the Spanish was made in the early 16th century. By the end of the 16th century, the site was abandoned completely.&lt;ref name="Maya"&gt;''The Ancient Maya'', Robert J. Sharer and Loa P. Traxler, [[Stanford University]] Press 2006. pp. 608–611.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==

[[File:Castillo Windows.JPG|thumb|Windows in the Castillo's sea-facing wall.]]
[[File:Tulum - 12.jpg|thumb|right|"Temple of the Frescos"]]

Tulum has architecture typical of Maya sites on the east coast of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]]. This architecture is recognized by a step running around the base of the building which sits on a low substructure. Doorways of this type are usually narrow with columns used as support if the building is big enough. As the walls flare out there are usually two sets of molding near the top. The room usually contains one or two small windows with an altar at the back wall, roofed by either a beam-and-rubble ceiling or being vaulted.&lt;ref name="Tulum"&gt;Muyil-Quintana Roo-Mexico. Last revised Wednesday April 2, 2008. Walter R. T. Witschey. September 17, 2008. ({{cite web |url=http://muyil.smv.org/tulum.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303170131/http://muyil.smv.org/tulum.htm |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }})&lt;/ref&gt; This type of architecture resembles what can be found in the nearby [[Chichen Itza]], just on a much smaller scale.&lt;ref name="Maya" /&gt;

==== Tulum's wall ====
Tulum was protected on one side by steep sea cliffs and on the landward side by a wall that averaged about  {{convert|3|-|5|m|ft|sp=us}} in height. The wall also was about {{convert|8|m|ft|abbr=on}} thick and {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} long on the side parallel to the sea. The part of the wall that ran the width of the site was slightly shorter and only about {{convert|170|m|ft|sp=us}} on both sides. Constructing this massive wall would have taken an enormous amount of energy and time, which shows how important defense was to the Maya when they chose this site. On the southwest and northwest corners there are small structures that have been identified as watch towers, showing again how well defended the city was. There are five narrow gateways in the wall with two each on the north and south sides and one on the west. Near the northern side of the wall a small [[cenote]] provided the city with fresh water. It is this impressive wall that makes Tulum one of the most well-known fortified sites of the Maya.&lt;ref name="Fort"&gt;"Lowland Maya Fortifications", David Webster, ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'', Vol. 120, No. 5 (Oct. 15, 1976), pp. 361–371, Published by: [[American Philosophical Society]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Most famous buildings ====
There are three major structures of interest at the Tulum archaeological site. El Castillo, the Temple of the Frescoes, and the Temple of the Descending God. 

===== Temple of the Frescoes =====
Among the more spectacular buildings here is the Temple of the Frescoes that included a lower gallery and a smaller second story gallery. The Temple of the Frescoes was used as an observatory for tracking the movements of the sun. Niched figurines of the Maya “diving god” or Venus deity decorate the facade of the temple. This “diving god” is also depicted in the Temple of the Diving God in the central precinct of the site. Above the entrance in the western wall a stucco figure of the “diving god” is still preserved, giving the temple its name. A mural can still be seen on the eastern wall that resembles that of a style that originated in highland Mexico, called the Mixteca-Puebla style, though visitors are no longer permitted to enter.

===== Temple of the Descending God =====
The Temple of the Descending God consists of a single room with a door to the west and a narrow staircase that was built on top of another temple that served as its base.

In the niche located at the top of the door stands a sculpture that’s found throughout Tulum. He has wings, a headdress and holds an object in his hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mayanpeninsula.com/tulum|title=Tulum Arqueological Site Ultimate Guide {{!}} Mayan Peninsula|work=Mayan Peninsula|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== El Castillo =====
Also in the central precinct is the Castillo, which is {{convert|7.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall. The Castillo was built on a previous building that was colonnaded and had a beam and mortar roof. The lintels in the upper rooms have serpent motifs carved into them.  The construction of the Castillo appears to have taken place in stages. A small shrine appears to have been used as a beacon for incoming canoes. This shrine marks a break in the barrier reef that is opposite the site. Here there is a cove and landing beach in a break in the sea cliffs that would have been perfect for trading canoes coming in. This characteristic of the site may be one of the reasons the Maya founded the city of Tulum exactly here, as Tulum later became a prominent trading port during the late [[Postclassic]].&lt;ref name="Maya" /&gt;

==Trading==
[[File:Tulum - God of the Winds Temple 03.JPG|thumb|Templo Dios del Viento (God of Winds Temple) guarding Tulum's sea entrance bay]]
Both coastal and land routes converged at Tulum. A number of artifacts found in or near the site show contacts with areas all over Central Mexico and Central America. Copper artifacts from the Mexican highlands have been found near the site, as have flint artifacts, ceramics, incense burners, and gold objects from all over the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]]. Salt and textiles were among some of the goods brought by traders  to Tulum by sea that would be dispersed inland. Typical exported goods included feathers and copper objects that came from inland sources. These goods could be transported by sea to rivers such as the [[Río Motagua]] and the Río Usumacincta/Pasión system, which could be traveled inland, giving seafaring canoes access to both the highlands and the lowlands.

The [[Río Motagua]] starts from the highlands of Guatemala and empties into the Caribbean. The Río Pasión/Ucamacincta river system also originates in the Guatemalan highlands and empties into the Gulf of Mexico. It may have been one of these seafaring canoes that Christopher Columbus first encountered off the shores of the Bay Islands of Honduras.&lt;ref name="carr"&gt;''The Peoples of the Caribbean: An Encyclopedia of Archeology and Traditional Culture,'' Nicholas J. Saunders, Published by ABC-CLIO, 2005. p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jade]] and [[obsidian]] appear to be some of the more valuable found here. The obsidian would have been brought from [[Ixtepeque]] in northern Guatemala, which was nearly {{convert|700|km|mi|sp=us}} away from Tulum. This huge distance, coupled with the density of obsidian found at the site, show that Tulum was a major center for the trading of obsidian.&lt;ref name="obsid"&gt;"Classic Maya Obsidian Trade", Raymond V. Sidrys, ''American Antiquity'', Vol. 41, No. 4 (Oct. 1976), pp. 449–464, Published by: Society for American Archaeology&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism==
[[Image:Caribbean near Tulum.jpg|thumb|This beach at Tulum is protected for [[nest]]ing [[sea turtles]]; [[Quintana Roo]], [[Mexico]]]]
Tulum archaeological site is relatively compact compared with many other Maya sites in the vicinity, and is one of the best-preserved coastal Maya sites. Its proximity to the modern tourism developments along the Mexican Caribbean coastline and its short distance from [[Cancún]] and the surrounding "[[Riviera Maya]]" has made it a popular Maya tourist site in the Yucatán. Daily tour buses bring a constant stream of visitors to the site. The Tulum ruins are the third most-visited archaeological site in Mexico, after [[Teotihuacan]] and [[Chichen Itza]], receiving over 2.2 million visitors in 2017.&lt;ref name=visitors&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.estadisticas.inah.gob.mx/ |title=Estadística de Visitantes |language=es |publisher=[[INAH]] |accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of [[cenotes]] are located in the Tulum area such as Maya Blue, Naharon, Temple of Doom, Tortuga, Vacaha, Grand Cenote, Abejas, Nohoch Kiin and Carwash cenotes and cave systems.

The tourist destination is now divided into four main areas: the archaeological site, the ''pueblo'' (or town), the ''zona hotelera'' (or hotel zone) and the biosphere reserve of [[Sian Ka'an]].

In 1995, tourism came to a brief halt as the powerful [[Hurricane Roxanne]] pounded into Tulum, packing 115&amp;nbsp;mph winds. Damage was moderate.

==Climate==
Considered a tropical savanna climate typically with a pronounced dry season.  The [[Köppen Climate Classification]] subtype for this climate is [[Tropical savanna climate|''Aw'']] (Tropical Savanna Climate).

In [[sociolinguistics]], a '''T–V distinction''' (from the Latin [[pronoun]]s {{lang|la|'''t'''u}} and {{lang|la|'''v'''os}}) is a contrast, within one language, between various forms of addressing one's conversation partner or partners that are specialized for varying levels of politeness, [[social distance]], courtesy, familiarity, age or insult toward the addressee. Many languages lack this type of distinction, instead relying on more explicit wording to convey these meanings. The [[morphosyntax|morphosyntactic]] T–V distinction, though, is found in a variety of languages around the world.

English does not have a T–V distinction, with the exception of a few dialects. There previously was one with the pronouns ''[[thou]]'' and ''you'', with the familiar ''thou'' disappearing from [[Early Modern English]]. Additionally British commoners have historically spoken to nobility and royalty using the third person rather than the second person, a practice that has fallen out of favor. English speakers today often employ [[semantics|semantic]] analogues to convey the mentioned attitudes towards the addressee, such as whether to address someone by [[given name|given]] or [[surname]], or whether to use ''[[sir]]''/''[[madam|ma'am]]''. Under a broader classification, '''T''' and '''V''' forms are examples of [[honorifics (linguistics)|honorifics]].

The T–V distinction is expressed in a variety of forms. Two particularly common means are
# Addressing a single individual using the second-person plural forms in the language, instead of the singular (e.g. in French).
# Addressing individuals in the third person, rather than the second (e.g. in Spanish).

== History and usage ==
The terms '''T''' and '''V''', based on the [[Latin]] pronouns {{lang|la|tu}} and {{lang|la|vos}}, were first used in a paper by the social psychologist [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|Roger Brown]] and the Shakespearian scholar [[Roger Brown (psychologist)#Personal life|Albert Gilman]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Pronouns of Power and Solidarity'' published in T.A Seboek (ed) (1960). Republished in Giglioli (1972). The pages numbers cited below are from Giglioli.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a historical and contemporary survey of the uses of pronouns of address, seen as [[semantic]] markers of social relationships between individuals. The study considered mainly [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[German language|German]]. The paper was highly influential&lt;ref&gt;Giglioli p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; and with few exceptions, the terms '''T''' and '''V''' have been used in subsequent studies.

=== Origin ===
In [[Latin language|Latin]], {{lang|la|tu}} was originally the singular, and {{lang|la|vos}} the plural, with no distinction for honorific or familiar. According to Brown and Gilman, usage of the plural to the [[Roman emperor]] began in the 4th century AD. They mention the possibility that this was because there were two emperors at that time (in [[Constantinople]] and [[Rome]]), but also mention that "plurality is a very old and ubiquitous metaphor for power". This usage was extended to other powerful figures, such as [[Pope Gregory I]] (590–604). However, Brown and Gilman note that it was only between the 12th and 14th centuries that the norms for the use of T- and V-forms crystallized. Less commonly, the use of the plural may be extended to other [[grammatical person|persons]], such as the "[[royal we|royal ''we'']]" ([[majestic plural]]) in [[English language|English]].

Brown and Gilman argued that the choice of form is governed by either relationships of 'power' and/or 'solidarity', depending on the culture of the speakers, showing that 'power' had been the dominant predictor of form in Europe until the 20th century. Thus, it was quite normal for a powerful person to use a T-form but expect a V-form in return. However, in the twentieth century the dynamic shifted in favour of solidarity, so that people would use T-forms with those they knew, and V-forms in service encounters, with [[wikt:reciprocity|reciprocal]] usage being the norm in both cases.

=== Early history: the power semantic ===
In the [[Early Middle Ages]] (the 5th century to the 10th century), the pronoun {{lang|la|vos}} was used to address the most exalted figures, emperors and popes, who would use the pronoun {{lang|la|tu}} to address a subject. This use was progressively extended to other states and societies, and down the social hierarchy as a mark of respect to individuals of higher rank, religious authority, greater wealth, or seniority within a family. The development was slow and erratic, but a consistent pattern of use is estimated to have been reached in different European societies by the period 1100 to 1500. Use of V spread to upper-class individuals of equal rank, but not to lower class individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Brown &amp; Gilman pp. 254–255&lt;/ref&gt;
This may be represented in Brown and Gilman's notation:
:{| class="wikitable"
!colspan="2"| Unequal power
!colspan="2"| Equal power
|-
| Emperor          || Father           || High-class friend || Low-class friend
|-
| T↓{{spaces|2}}↑V || T↓{{spaces|2}}↑V || ↓↑V               || T↓↑
|-
| Subject          || Son              || High-class friend || Low-class friend
|}

=== Modification: the solidarity semantic ===
Speakers developed greater flexibility of pronoun use by redefining relationships between individuals. Instead of defining the father–son relationship as one of power, it could be seen as a shared family relationship. Brown and Gilman term this the semantics of solidarity. Thus a speaker might have a choice of pronoun, depending on how they perceived the relationship with the person addressed. Thus a speaker with superior power might choose '''V''' to express fellow feeling with a subordinate. For example, a restaurant customer might use '''V''' to their favourite waiter. Similarly a subordinate with a friendly relationship of long standing might use '''T'''. For example, a child might use '''T''' to express affection for their parent.&lt;ref&gt;Brown &amp; Gilman pp. 257–258&lt;/ref&gt;

This may be represented as:
:{| class="wikitable"
!colspan="3"| Superior has choice
!colspan="3"| Subordinate has choice
|-
| Customer          || Officer           || Employer          || Parent            || Master            || Elder sibling
|-
| T↓V{{spaces|2}}↑V || T↓V{{spaces|2}}↑V || T↓V{{spaces|2}}↑V || T↓{{spaces|2}}T↑V || T↓{{spaces|2}}T↑V || T↓{{spaces|2}}T↑V
|-
| Waiter            || Soldier           || Employee          || Child             || Faithful servant  || Younger sibling
|}
These choices were available not only to reflect permanent relationships, but to express momentary changes of attitude. This allowed playwrights such as [[Jean Racine|Racine]], [[Molière]], [[Ben Jonson|Ben Johnson]], [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]] and [[Shakespeare]] to express a character's inner changes of mood through outward changes of pronoun.&lt;ref&gt;Brown &amp; Gilman pp. 278–280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, David &amp; Ben (2002) pp. 450–451. Reproduced at David Crystal's [http://www.shakespeareswords.com/thou-and-you Explore Shakespeare's Works] site&lt;/ref&gt;

For centuries, it was the more powerful individual who chose to address a subordinate either with '''T''' or with '''V''', or to allow the subordinate to choose. For this reason, the pronouns were traditionally defined as the ''pronoun of either condescension or intimacy'' ('''T''') and ''the pronoun of reverence or formality'' ('''V'''). Brown and Gilman argue that modern usage no longer supports these definitions.&lt;ref&gt;Brown &amp; Gilman p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern history ===
Developments from the nineteenth century have seen the solidarity semantic more consistently applied. It has become less acceptable for a more powerful individual to exercise the choice of pronoun. Officers in most armies are not permitted to address a soldier as '''T'''. Most European parents cannot oblige their children to use '''V'''. The relationships illustrated above have changed in the direction of the following norms:&lt;ref&gt;Brown &amp; Gilman pp. 269–261&lt;/ref&gt;
:{| class="wikitable"
!colspan="3"| Superior choice removed
!colspan="3"| Subordinate choice removed
|-
| Customer || Officer || Employer || Parent || Master           || Elder sibling
|-
| ↑↓V      || ↑↓V     || ↑↓V      || T↑↓    || T↑↓              || T↑↓
|-
| Waiter   || Soldier || Employee || Child  || Faithful servant || Younger sibling
|}
The tendency to promote the solidarity semantic may lead to the abolition of any choice of address pronoun. During the [[French Revolution]] attempts were made to abolish '''V'''. In 17th century England the [[Society of Friends]] obliged its members to use only '''T''' to everyone, and some continue to use '''T''' (''thee'') to one another.&lt;ref&gt;Brown &amp; Gilman pp. 266–268&lt;/ref&gt; In most Modern English dialects the choice of '''T''' no longer exists outside of poetry.

=== Changes in progress ===
It was reported in 2012 that use of the [[French language|French]] {{lang|fr|vous}} and the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] {{lang|es|usted}} are in decline in [[social media]].&lt;ref name="bbcnewsmag lawn 2012"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lawn |first=Rebecca |title=Tu and Twitter: Is it the end for 'vous' in French? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19499771 |accessdate=7 September 2012 |work=[[BBC News Magazine]] |date=7 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An explanation offered was that such online communications favour the philosophy of [[social equality|equality]], regardless of usual formal distinctions. Similar tendencies were observed in [[German language|German]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] as well as in [[Italian language|Italian]].&lt;ref name="bbcnewsmag lawn 2012"/&gt;

=== History of use in individual languages ===

==== English ====
The [[Old English]] and [[Early Middle English#Early Middle English|Early Middle English]] [[grammatical person|second person]] pronouns {{lang|enm|thou}} and {{lang|enm|ye}} (with variants) were used for singular and plural reference respectively with no '''T–V''' distinction. The earliest entry in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] for ''ye'' as a '''V''' pronoun in place of the singular ''thou'' exists in a [[Middle English]] text of 1225 composed in 1200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/231466#eid13732377 |title=ye, ''pron.'' and ''n.'' |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |accessdate=10 November 2018 |url-access=subscription |quote=''a''1225 (▸c1200) ''Vices &amp; Virtues'' (1888) 31 (''MED''): {{lang|enm|Hwo is þat us muȝen sceawin ða gode ðe '''ȝe''' us behoteð?}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; The usage may have started among the [[Norman French]] nobility in imitation of French. It made noticeable advances during the second half of the 13th century. During the 16th century, the distinction between the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] form ''ye'' and the [[object (grammar)|object]] form ''you'' was largely lost, leaving ''you'' as the usual '''V''' pronoun (and plural pronoun). After 1600, the use of ''ye'' in standard English was confined to literary and religious contexts or as a consciously archaic usage.&lt;ref&gt;"Interlude 12 : Choosing ''thou'' or ''you''" David Crystal (2004) pp. 307–310&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Crystal]] summarises [[Early Modern English]] usage thus:

'''V''' would normally be used
* by people of lower social status to those above them
* by the upper classes when talking to each other, even if they were closely related
* as a sign of a change (contrasting with ''thou'') in the emotional temperature of an interaction

'''T''' would normally be used
* by people of higher social status to those below them
* by the lower classes when talking to each other
* in addressing God/Jesus
* in talking to ghosts, witches, and other supernatural beings
* in an imaginary address to someone who was absent
* as a sign of a change (contrasting with ''you'') in the emotional temperature of an interaction&lt;ref&gt;Crystal (2004) p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''T–V''' distinction was still well preserved when Shakespeare began writing at the end of the 16th century. However, other playwrights of the time made less use of '''T–V''' contrasts than Shakespeare. The infrequent use of '''T''' in popular writing earlier in the century such as the [[Paston Letters]] suggest that the distinction was already disappearing from gentry speech. In the first half of the 17th century, ''thou'' disappeared from [[Standard English]], although the '''T–V''' distinction was preserved in many [[dialect|regional dialects]]. When the [[Quakers]] began using ''thou'' again in the middle of the century, many people were still aware of the old '''T–V''' distinction and responded with derision and physical violence.

In the 19th century, one aspect of the '''T–V''' distinction was restored to some English dialects in the form of a pronoun that expressed friendly solidarity, written as ''[[y'all]]''. Unlike earlier ''thou'', it was used primarily for plural address, and in some dialects for singular address as well.&lt;ref name="Schneider"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schneider |first=Edgar W. |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OqUBUgW_Ax8C&amp;pg=PA284 |chapter=The English dialect heritage of the southern United States |title=Legacies of Colonial English |editor-first=Raymond |editor-last=Hickey |year=2005 |page=284 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pronoun was first observed in the southern states of the US among [[African-American]] speakers, although its precise origin is obscure. The pronoun spread rapidly to [[White people|White]] speakers in those southern states, and (to a lesser extent) other regions of the US and beyond. This pronoun is not universally accepted, and may be regarded as either nonstandard or a regionalism.&lt;ref&gt;"Interlude 17, Tracking a change: the case of ''y'all''" Crystal (2004) pp. 449–452&lt;/ref&gt;

''Yous(e)'' (pron. {{IPAc-en|j|uː|z|}}, {{IPAc-en|j|ə|z|}}) as a plural is found mainly in [[English language in Northern England|(Northern) England]], [[Scottish English|Scotland]], parts of [[Hiberno-English|Ireland]], [[Australian English|Australia]], [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]], [[South African English|South Africa]], northern [[Nova Scotia]] and parts of [[Ontario]] in Canada and parts of the northeastern United States (especially areas where there was historically Irish or Italian immigration), including in [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], [[New York, New York|New York]], and scattered throughout working class Italian-American communities in the American [[Rust Belt]]. It also occurs in [[Scouse]] (the regional dialect of the [[Liverpool]] area).

==== French ====
In [[Old French]] texts, the pronouns {{lang|fr|tu}} and {{lang|fr|vous}} are often used interchangeably to address an individual, sometimes in the same sentence. However, some emerging pattern of use has been detected by recent scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Summarised in Fagyal et al (2006) pp. 267–268&lt;/ref&gt; Between characters equal in age or rank, {{lang|fr|vous}} was more common than {{lang|fr|tu}} as a singular address. However, {{lang|fr|tu}} was sometimes used to put a young man in his place, or to express temporary anger. There may also have been variation between [[Parisian (person)|Parisian]] use and that of other regions.

In the [[Middle French]] period a relatively stable '''T–V''' distinction emerged. ''Vous'' was the '''V''' form used by upper-class speakers to address one another, while {{lang|fr|tu}} was the '''T''' form used among lower class speakers. Upper-class speakers could choose to use either '''T''' or '''V''' when addressing an inferior. Inferiors would normally use '''V''' to a superior. However, there was much variation; in 1596 {{lang|fr|[[Étienne Pasquier]]|italic=no}} in his comprehensive survey {{lang|fr|Recherches de la France|italic=yes}} observed that the French sometimes used {{lang|fr|vous}} to inferiors as well as to superiors "{{lang|fr|selon la facilité de nos naturels}}" ("according to our natural tendencies"). In poetry, {{lang|fr|tu}} was often used to address kings or to speak to God.&lt;ref&gt;Fagyal et al p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use of names ===
The boundaries between formal and informal language differ from language to language, as well as within social groups of the speakers of a given language. In some circumstances, it is not unusual to call other people by first name and the respectful form, or last name and familiar form. For example, German teachers use the former construct with upper-secondary students, while Italian teachers typically use the latter (switching to a full V-form with university students). This can lead to constructions denoting an intermediate level of formality in T–V-distinct languages that sound awkward to English-speakers. In Italian, {{lang|it|(Signor) Vincenzo Rossi}} can be addressed with the {{lang|it|tu}} (familiar) form or the {{lang|it|Lei}} (formal) one, but complete addresses range from {{lang|it|Tu, Vincenzo}} (peer to peer or family) and {{lang|it|Tu, Rossi}} (teacher or fellow student to high-school student, as stated above) to {{lang|it|Lei, signor Vincenzo}} (live-in servant to master or master's son) and {{lang|it|Lei, Rossi}} (senior staff member to junior) and {{lang|it|Lei, signor Rossi}} (among peers).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

=== Translation issues ===
The use of these forms may be an issue for [[untranslatability#Compensation|compensating translation]] of dialogue into English if the translator does not wish to use the "thou" pronoun to translate. For example, a character in a French film or novel saying "{{lang|fr|Tutoie-moi&amp;thinsp;!}}" ("Use [the informal pronoun] {{lang|fr|tu}} when addressing me!") might be translated "Do not be so formal!" or "Call me by my first name!"

Conversely, when translating from English to a T–V language, the translator must decide again and again throughout the work which second-person form the reader would deem the more appropriate in a given situation. In the current German DVD release of ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', the translators of the dubbed soundtrack and of the subtitles sometimes make opposite decisions; the actors dubbed voices speak with the familiar form, while the subtitles for the same scene are more formal.

== Singular, plural and other ways of distinction ==
In many languages, the respectful singular pronoun derives from a plural form. Some Romance languages have familiar forms derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] singular {{lang|la|'''t'''u}} and respectful forms derived from Latin plural {{lang|la|'''v'''os}}, sometimes via a circuitous route. Sometimes, singular V-form derives from a third person pronoun; in [[German language|German]] and some [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] languages, it is the third person ''plural''. Some languages have separate T and V forms for both singular and plural; others have the same form; others have a T–V distinction only in the singular.

Different languages distinguish pronoun uses in different ways. Even within languages, there are differences between groups (older people and people of higher status tending both to use and to expect more respectful language) and between various aspects of one language. For example, in Dutch, V form {{lang|nl|u}} is slowly falling into disuse in the plural, thus one could sometimes address a group as T form {{lang|nl|jullie}} (which clearly expresses the plural) when one would address each member individually as {{lang|nl|u}} (which has the disadvantage of being ambiguous). In Latin American Spanish, the opposite change has occurred – having lost the T form {{lang|nl|vosotros}}, Latin Americans address all groups as {{lang|nl|ustedes}}, even if the group is composed of friends whom they would call {{lang|nl|tú}} or {{lang|nl|[[voseo|vos]]}} (both T forms).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} In Standard Peninsular Spanish however, {{lang|nl|vosotros}} (literally, "you others") is still regularly employed in familiar conversation. In some cases V-forms are likely to be capitalized when written.

== In specific languages ==

=== Germanic ===

==== Afrikaans ====
Modern [[Afrikaans]] rarely makes the distinction between the informal {{lang|af|jy}} and {{lang|af|jou}} ("you" subject and "your" / "you" object) and the more formal {{lang|af|u}} (or {{lang|af|U}} when addressing God), although sometimes it is upheld in a formal setting, such as in politics, business or in a polite conversation. The trend is moving towards using the informal pronoun most often.

==== Dutch ====
[[Old Dutch]] did not appear to have a T–V distinction. {{lang|odt|Thu}} was used as the second-person singular, and {{lang|odt|gi}} as the second-person plural. In early [[Middle Dutch]], influenced by [[Old French]] usage, the original plural pronoun {{lang|dum|gi}} (or {{lang|dum|ji}} in the north) came to be used as a respectful singular pronoun, creating a T–V distinction. However, the formal {{lang|dum|gi}} started to be used in more and more situations. By the 17th century, {{lang|dum|du}} had largely fallen out of use, although it lingered on in some of the more peripheral areas. At this point, the original T–V distinction had been lost, and the original V-pronoun {{lang|dum|gij}}/{{lang|dum|jij}} was used universally for both singular and plural regardless of the type of address. This resembled the state of English today, which has also (outside of dialectal, literary or religious use) lost its original T-pronoun ''thou''.

Around this time, a new formal pronoun {{lang|dum|u}} started to come into use. This was also the object form of the subject pronoun {{lang|dum|gij}}/{{lang|dum|jij}}, and how it came to be used as a subject pronoun is not exactly clear. It is usually related to a form of address in writing of the time: letters were often addressed formally to {{lang|dum|U.E.}}, standing for {{lang|dum|Uwe Edelheid}} ("Your Highness"), which is thought to have been shortened to {{lang|dum|u}} eventually. It can be compared to the Spanish {{lang|es|usted}}, which is a similar contraction of a phrase of indirect address. As in Spanish, the Dutch {{lang|dum|u}} was originally conjugated as the third person in verbs, although most verbs had identical second- and third-person singular forms, so that this difference was not apparent for the most part. It remains today in the use of {{lang|nl|u heeft}} ("you (formal) have", like {{lang|nl|hij heeft}} "he has"), compared to {{lang|nl|jij hebt}} ("you (informal) have"). However, {{lang|nl|u hebt}} is now also common.

Around the same time, it became more common to clarify when multiple people were being spoken to, by adding {{lang|dum|luyden}}, {{lang|dum|lieden}} ("people"), or a shortened variety, to the end of the pronoun. Thus, when speaking to multiple people, one would use {{lang|dum|jij luyden}} or {{lang|dum|je lieden}}. This combination was contracted and fused over time, eventually resulting in {{lang|nl|jullie}}, the informal plural pronoun that is used today. It can be compared, in its origin, to the English ''y'all'' or Spanish {{lang|es|vosotros}}.

Modern northern [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and usually standard Dutch as well, has two forms of second person pronouns, namely {{lang|nl|jij}} and {{lang|nl|u}}. {{lang|nl|U}} is the formal pronoun, whereas {{lang|nl|jij}} is used as the informal personal pronoun to address a single person. In the plural, {{lang|nl|u}} is also used, alongside the informal {{lang|nl|jullie}}. In the south, only one pronoun, {{lang|nl|gij}}, is generally used in all three roles: both singular and plural, formal and informal. ''U'' is sometimes also used in formal situations, but the southern {{lang|nl|gij}} does not have a distinct informal connotation like the northern/standard {{lang|nl|jij}}, and can be used to address anyone without offence. Religious Dutch speakers in all areas address [[God]] using either {{lang|nl|Gij}} or {{lang|nl|U}}; {{lang|nl|jij}} is never used. For speakers of the north, this is usually the only place where {{lang|nl|gij}} is encountered, giving it a formal and archaic tone, even though it is neutral in the southern areas where it is still used.

The pronoun {{lang|nl|je}} (unstressed variant of {{lang|nl|jij}}) can also be used impersonally, corresponding to the English [[generic you]]. The more formal Dutch term corresponding to English [[generic you]] or [[generic one|one]] is {{lang|nl|men}}.

In Dutch the formal personal pronoun is used for older people or for people with a higher or equal status, unless the addressed makes it clear they want to be spoken to with the informal pronoun. Unlike for example in [[German language|German]], there is no defined line (in the case of German, roughly when someone passes the age of 16) in which everyone, apart from family, is addressed with the formal pronoun. Addressing parents by {{lang|nl|u}} has become very rare; {{lang|nl|jij}} is often even used to address grandparents. There is also a tendency towards more use of the informal pronoun. Some companies such as [[IKEA]] consciously address their customers with the informal {{lang|nl|jij}}. However, {{lang|nl|u}} can still be considered more or less obligatory in situations where, for example, a pupil addresses their teacher, people testify in court or communication between a doctor and their patient.

==== English ====
{{See also|Thou|You}}

Contemporary English generally uses only the form "you", regardless of level of familiarity.

[[Old English]] used {{wikt-lang|ang|þū}}&lt;ref&gt;{{wikt-lang|ang|þū|Þū}} was the [[nominative case]] of the word; the [[accusative case|accusative]] form was originally {{wikt-lang|ang|þeċ}} but over time the [[dative case|dative]] {{wikt-lang|ang|þē}} replaced it.&lt;/ref&gt; in the second-person singular for both formal and informal contexts. Following the [[Norman Conquest]], the [[Middle English]] that emerged continued to use ''{{linktext|þou}}''&lt;ref&gt;The accusative of {{wikt-lang|ang|þou}} was at first spelled {{wikt-lang|ang|þe}} or {{wikt-lang|ang|the}} but later became ''{{linktext|thee}}''.&lt;/ref&gt; at first, but by the 13th century, Norman [[#French|French]] influence had led to the use of the second-person plural {{wikt-lang|enm|ȝe}} or {{wikt-lang|enm|ye}} in formal contexts.

In [[Early Modern English]] superiors and strangers were therefore respectfully addressed as ''ye'' in the [[nominative case|nominative]]&lt;ref name="yeyou"/&gt; and ''you'' in the [[objective case|objective]]; ''thou'' and ''thee'' were used for familiars and subordinates. The more widespread and observed this division became, the more pejorative it became to strangers to be called by the familiar form of address. By the 17th century, such a use among the nobility was strongly and deliberately contemptuous, as in the declamation of the prosecutor at Sir [[Walter Raleigh]]'s 1603 trial "I thou thee, thou traitor!" Accordingly, the use of ''thou'' began to decline and it was effectively extinct in the everyday speech of most English dialects by the early 18th century, supplanted by the polite ''you'', even when addressing children and animals, something also seen in Dutch and Latin America (most of [[Brazilian Portuguese#Tu and você|Brazil]] and parts of [[Spanish language#Usted|Spanish America]]). Meanwhile, as part of English's continuing development away from its [[synthetic language|synthetic]] origins since the influx of French vocabulary following the Norman invasion, ''you'' had been replacing ''ye'' since the 15th century. Standard English was left with a single second-person pronoun for all cases, numbers and contexts and largely incapable of maintaining a T–V distinction.&lt;ref&gt;There is a minor amount of T–V distinction among dialects of English that ''(a)'' employ informal first-person singulars (such as [[South Yorkshire]]'s continuing use of ''tha'') or ''(b)'' have adopted a new second-person plural (such as the [[American South]]'s ''y'all''). The non-[[prestige dialect|prestige]] nature of these dialects means that they [[diglossia|maintain a separate language register]] (including ''you'') to be used among people outside their community whose judgment they are afraid of offending. For other variants, see the articles collected at [[:Category:Second-person plural pronouns in English]].&lt;/ref&gt;
Notwithstanding all of this, the translators of the [[King James version]] of the [[Bible]] chose to employ the older forms in their work (1604–1611) in order to convey the grammatical distinctions made by their [[Daniel Bomberg|Hebrew]], [[Theodore Beza|Greek]] and [[Robert Estienne|Latin]] sources. Its subsequent popularity and the religious rationale of many{{refn|Including the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]]' "[[Testimony of Simplicity|Plain Speech]]" and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saint]]' prayers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authorlink=Dallin H. Oaks |last=Oaks |first=Dallin H. |url=http://www.lds.org/ensign/1993/05/the-language-of-prayer |title=The Language of Prayer |work=[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date=May 1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} who continued to employ ''thou'' has preserved its use in English, but made it seem pious and ironically ''more'' formal and respectful than the everyday ''you''.

In the United States, some Protestant sects, such as the [[Society of Friends|Quakers]] and [[Mormons]] insisted on addressing everyone as ''thou'', because they considered every person to be a friend and an equal. This persisted until the 19th or early 20th century.

==== Frisian (West) ====
In [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]], the formal singular nominative {{lang|fy|jo}} (pronounced ''yo'') is very close to the English ''you'' and the Middle and Early Modern English {{lang|enm|ye}}. There is no such distinction in the plural; the plural second person pronoun is always {{lang|fy|jimme}}. {{lang|nl|[[Stadsfries]]|italic=no}}, a Dutch dialect with strong Frisian influence, parallels this distinction ({{lang|nl|dou}}, {{lang|nl|jou}}, {{lang|nl|jimme}}).

West Frisian {{lang|fy|jo}} is used slightly more often than Dutch {{lang|nl|u}}. Native speakers of Dutch are sometimes warned against addressing newly acquainted people with {{lang|fy|do}} too soon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pieter Duijff |title=Taal in stad en land – Fries en Stadsfries |publisher=Sdu Uitgevers |location=The Hague |year=2002 |pages=51–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== German ====
===== {{lang|de|Sie}} and {{lang|de|du}} =====
{{See also|Du (personal pronoun)}}
In [[German language|German]], the formal address {{lang|de|Sie}} is the same as the third person plural pronoun {{lang|de|sie}}. Verbs used with this form of address are also identical to third person plural forms. The polite form and its inflected forms are always capitalized in writing, to avoid any ambiguity.

The corresponding informal German address is {{lang|de|du}} or {{lang|de|Du}}. The verbs {{lang|de|duzen}} and {{lang|de|siezen}} mean respectively "to address using {{lang|de|du}}" and "to address using {{lang|de|Sie}}" and the phrases {{lang|de|per du}} or {{lang|de|auf du und du}} mean, "to be on du terms". The use of {{lang|de|Sie}} often coincides with the use of the title plus surname,&lt;ref name="Siedu"&gt;About.com [http://german.about.com/od/grammar/a/Siedu.htm Sie &amp; Du].&lt;/ref&gt; usage of which is more widespread in German-speaking areas than Anglophone areas.&lt;ref name="Siedu"/&gt; In general terms, {{lang|de|du}} is used to children, animals and God, and between adults (or between adults and children) who are good friends of or related to each other. {{lang|de|Sie}} is used in other situations, such as in a business situation or where there is no existing relationship.&lt;ref name="Siedu"/&gt; In Internet chats and forums, Germans rarely use {{lang|de|Sie}}, although there are exceptions. Except in the case of adults addressing children, where it is common for the child to address the adult as {{lang|de|Sie}}, but be addressed as {{lang|de|du}} in return, it is not common in German for one party to address the other as {{lang|de|Sie}}, but be addressed as {{lang|de|du}} in return.&lt;ref name="Siedu"/&gt; In almost all cases it can be considered as impolite to use the "wrong" pronoun, that is a pronoun that is not expected by the other party. However on the other hand, using an unexpected {{lang|de|du}} can also be a very welcome sign of affection, and using an unexpected {{lang|de|Sie}} can, in the young, be a very welcome sign of appreciation of the addressed one's maturity.

High school students in Germany are often called {{lang|de|Sie}} plus given name ({{lang|de|Hamburger Sie}}) by their teachers when they enter the {{lang|de|[[Abitur|Oberstufe]]}} — the last 2 or 3 years of high school — around the age of 16.

Children and teenagers are expected to use {{lang|de|Sie}} when addressing all adults except for family members and family friends whom they have known since early childhood. Street and similar social workers, sports clubs trainers will sometimes tell children and teens to address them with {{lang|de|du}}. In shops, bars, and other establishments, if they target a younger audience, it is becoming increasingly common for customers and staff to address each other as {{lang|de|du}}, to the degree that it is sometimes considered awkward if a waitress and a customer who are both in their twenties call each other {{lang|de|Sie}}.

The use of {{lang|de|du}} or {{lang|de|Sie}} between two strangers may also be determined by the setting in which they meet (casual/formal), as well as clothing (casual/formal), gender (same/opposite), and personal preference. For example, it is customary to use {{lang|de|du}} in traditional small pubs and taverns in certain regions (including the [[Rhineland]]). This applies also to older people, whom one would otherwise address as {{lang|de|Sie}}. Two people who addressed each other as {{lang|de|du}} in a pub may go back to {{lang|de|Sie}} when they meet in the street if their acquaintance was only very superficial. During the famous Rhenish [[carnival]], it is customary for most revelers to address each other as {{lang|de|du}}. Only if the age difference is more than one generation, the younger person might still use {{lang|de|Sie}}. Another setting in which {{lang|de|du}} is often used between adults is sporting events.

Being {{lang|de|per du}} has also become increasingly common in workplace environments (depending on the line of business and corporate culture to varying degrees), mostly regardless of age. In such environments, the {{lang|de|du}} basis may also be observed as a (sometimes necessary) mark of good social integration within a working group. As a rule of thumb, one might expect to see team colleagues on the workplace level in many industries on a customary {{lang|de|du}} basis with each other, though not always with the group manager and more rarely with higher-ranking managers. As entrants to a team are more closely integrated, this is often marked by making an informal affirmation to that basis or by formally offering it, as a matter of style and habituality. Both the tempo and extent of using the {{lang|de|du}} basis depends much on the culture (and sometimes the climate) of the business, and in some places even more so on that of the particular workgroup itself. Business cultures that pride themselves on a "flat hierarchy" are more likely to adopt or accent a general professional parlance of {{lang|de|du}} and given name while inside corporations tending to emphasize professional formality, a {{lang|de|Sie}} may be expected to be used always except between very close colleagues or inside closed groups (sometimes including managers meeting on the same level with the exclusion of any subordinates), and strictly always in the presence of a superior. The superior, on the other hand, has the right to address the other perform informally or formally, which is a personal preference.

Customarily, the switch from {{lang|de|Sie}} to {{lang|de|du}} is initially proposed by the elder of the two people, the person with socially higher standing or by the lady to the gentleman. Alternatively, one person may use {{lang|de|Sie}} while they ask the other person if it is acceptable to be addressed informally, and then act accordingly. One way to propose the use of {{lang|de|du}} rather than {{lang|de|Sie}} is by stating one's first name (as in: {{lang|de|Ich heiße...}}). One accepts the proposal by introducing one's own first name. Should a person later forget that they have adopted {{lang|de|du}}, it is polite to remind them by saying, {{lang|de|Wir waren doch per du}} (We moved on to {{lang|de|du}} terms). Sometimes switching back to {{lang|de|Sie}} is used as a method of distancing oneself from the addressee; the connotation is slightly ironic courtesy.

The inappropriate and uninvited use of {{lang|de|du}} towards someone who would otherwise reasonably expect to be addressed as {{lang|de|Sie}} is considered to be condescending and disrespectful, although insistence on {{lang|de|Sie}} in an environment where {{lang|de|du}} is largely accepted (flat hierarchies) can be interpreted as being equally disrespectful. The degree of offense that might be taken will depend on how obvious the etiquette violation was (an example of an obvious violation would be a teenager in the street addressing an elderly stranger on the street with {{lang|de|du}}, addressing a senior manager with {{lang|de|du}} as a result of a misjudged professional relationship would probably be taken with less offense), and will also depend on the upbringing of the person in question – progressive vs. conservative outlooks and age are examples of factors which can play a role in how individuals prefer to be addressed and choose to address others.

It has become the policy of some businesses for their employees to address customers with {{lang|de|du}}, often to set a progressive, "modern" tone, occasionally for other cultural reasons. [[IKEA]], for instance, does this to reflect the widespread use of the {{lang|sv|du}} form in Sweden (see {{lang|sv|[[Du-reformen]]}}).

In Germany, an old [[norm (sociology)|custom]] (called {{lang|de|Bruderschaft trinken}}, drinking brotherhood) involves two friends formally sharing a bottle of [[wine]] or drinking a glass of [[beer]] together to celebrate their agreement to call one another {{lang|de|du}} rather than {{lang|de|Sie}}. This custom has also been adopted among the Swiss-French of the Jura, in Poland and Russia (called by its German name, spelled {{lang|pl|bruderszaft}} and {{lang|ru|брудершафт}} respectively), though the custom in Poland is now slowly disappearing. It was formerly found also in Sweden.

Although the use of {{lang|de|Sie}} generally coincides with the use of title plus surname, especially in northern and eastern Germany, there is an intermediate address combining {{lang|de|Sie}} with the first name ({{lang|de|[[:de:Hamburger Sie|Hamburger Sie]]}}), whereas in the Berlin region, sometimes {{lang|de|Du}} is combined with the surname ({{lang|de|Berliner Du}}). The former usage also occurs when addressing teenagers, household staff, or guests of TV or radio programs, while the latter style is usually considered inferior and mainly occurs in working class environments. It may be associated with professional contexts, when colleagues have known one another for a long time, but, e. g. due to differences of status, do not want to switch to the usual {{lang|de|Du}} style; or in situations where strangers (e.g. customers) are present for whom it would not be appropriate to learn the first name of the addressee.

When speaking to more than one person in formal situations where one would use {{lang|de|Sie}} to each one of them separately, Standard German uses {{lang|de|Sie}}. However, in this situation {{lang|de|ihr}} can often be heard instead, especially in the South of Germany and in [[Swiss German|Swiss German dialects]], and is standard usage for pastors when preaching. If the {{lang|de|Sie}} standard here is followed, then the usage varies when addressing a group containing both {{lang|de|du}} and {{lang|de|Sie}} persons: Some speakers use the informal plural {{lang|de|ihr}} others prefer the formal {{lang|de|Sie}} and many, concerned that both pronouns might cause offence, prefer to use circumlocutions that avoid either pronoun, for example by expressing an [[imperative mood|imperative]] in [[infinitive]] form ({{lang|de|bitte das machen}}), by applying the [[passive voice]] ({{lang|de|es wird gemacht}}), or using the [[generic you|indefinite pronoun]] {{lang|de|man}} ({{lang|de|man macht das}}).

===== Historical predecessors: {{lang|de|Ihr}} and {{lang|de|Er}}/{{lang|de|Sie}} =====
Formerly, the 2nd person plural {{lang|de|Ihr}} ("ye") was used to address social superiors, unless more informal relations had been established. The use of {{lang|de|Ihr}} as the polite form, as this is the case with {{lang|fr|vous}} in the French language, has still survived in [[Bernese German]] and other [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] dialects. {{lang|de|Ihr}} in this case has to be capitalized. However, {{lang|de|Ihr}} itself shows a degree of informality, and would for example be used in addressing one's father. For the formal address, the third person would be used; and this in the singular with {{lang|de|Er}}, {{lang|de|Sie}} (capitalized) to a social inferior, as a farmer addressing a stableboy, or in the plural to a social superior. It is from the latter occurrences that modern {{lang|de|Sie}} takes its origin; {{lang|de|Sie}} is the 3rd person plural pronoun. However, {{lang|de|Sie}} itself is relatively young, and it was rather the formal addresses, often itself singular forms, that took the plural. Even as late as in [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt|Dürrenmatt]]'s "The Visit" (written in 1956), an address {{lang|de|Das wissen Herr Bürgermeister schon}} ("You do know that, Mr Mayor", modern German would just say {{lang|de|Das wissen Sie schon}}) can be found; Herr Bürgermeister is the formal address and itself a singular term, but wissen is plural. However, if the formal address itself contains a personal pronoun as in {{lang|de|Seine Majestät}} (His Majesty) etc., this one would be put to the 2nd person plural: {{lang|de|Was geruhen Euer}} (not: {{lang|de|Seine}}) {{lang|de|Majestät zu befehlen?}} ("What does [but plural] Your Majesty condescend to order?")

Thus, all these go by a similar grammar rule pertaining to the verb used with these addresses as modern {{lang|de|Sie}}. The dated capitalized address {{lang|de|Ihr}} demands the same verb form as the modern second person plural pronoun {{lang|de|ihr}}, the dated {{lang|de|Er}}/{{lang|de|Sie}} demands the same verb form as the modern third person singular {{lang|de|er}} and {{lang|de|sie}}, and the dated 3rd person plural address without {{lang|de|Sie}} demands, just as {{lang|de|Sie}} itself, the same verb form as the 3rd person plural pronoun {{lang|de|sie}} (they).

The forms are still found today in some dialects as a respectful way of addressing elders, and is still very often found in works of art and literature (such as books and movies) depicting events at least several centuries in the past, or in a "past-like" fantasy setting, even if modern German is otherwise used in these works; indeed, using the modern {{lang|de|Sie}} in such a setting would be considered an out-of-place anachronism. {{lang|de|Ihr}} and the 3rd person plural without {{lang|de|Sie}} is somewhat analogous to the English [[majestic plural]].

The {{lang|de|Er}}/{{lang|de|Sie}} form is not widely known or understood by the average person any more. While {{lang|de|Ihrzen}} is often still used in dubbed films, especially in medieval/fantasy contexts such as [[Lord of the Rings]] e.g. "{{lang|de|'''Ihr''' habt das Reich der Herrin des Waldes betreten, '''Ihr''' könnt nicht umkehren}}" ("you have entered the Realm of the Lady of the Wood, you can not turn back"). In this context, a historical level is used where the second person plural indicates some nobility of or respect for the addressee, such that from {{lang|de|Ihr}} being used to address a single person, the viewer could mostly, without looking, conclude that the person was of elevated rank such as a king or nobleman, or at least being treated with expressed regard. {{lang|de|Ihr}} would not normally be used to address a peasant (unless he is a prince in disguise or a future prince and the person addressing him has gathered some knowledge or presumption of that).

==== Scandinavian languages ====
===== Danish =====
In [[Danish language|Danish]], the informal second-person singular is {{wikt-lang|da|du}} and the formal form of address uses the third-person plural {{wikt-lang|da|De}}, capitalized to distinguish it from its other use. The second-person plural {{wikt-lang|da|I}} and the third-person singular {{wikt-lang|da|han}} ("he") or {{wikt-lang|da|hun}} ("she") were sometimes used until the early 19th century in standard Danish&lt;ref&gt;As in [[Ludvig Holberg]]'s dramas.&lt;/ref&gt; and awhile longer in the countryside. The German-inspired form {{lang|da|De}} entered Danish in the 18th century, too late to enter liturgical use. In church, as in rural or dialect-speaking areas, {{lang|da|du}} has always been the universal form, especially in [[Jutland]].

As in other Scandinavian languages, even among the prestige dialects, the formal pronoun is waning in use — in the case of Danish, since the {{lang|da|[[:da:Ungdomsoprøret i Danmark|Ungdomsoprøret]]}} ("Youth Revolts") during and after the [[protests of 1968]]. As a general rule, the informal {{lang|da|du}} is accepted everywhere today, except when addressing [[Danish royal family|royalty]]{{refn|Some members of the royal family insist upon it. During a 2010 interview with a [[TV 2 (Denmark)|TV 2]] journalist on board the training ship ''[[Danmark (ship)|Danmark]]'', [[Prince Joachim of Denmark|Prince Joachim]] pointedly refused to answer a question posed in the {{lang|da|du}} form until the reporter rephrased it as {{lang|da|De}}. The public debate then centered around whether the prince had demonstrated snobbishness, the journalist ignorance, or both.&lt;ref&gt;DR 2. [http://vimeo.com/66100977 Prince Joachim interview].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daily Motion.com. [http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xzudzv_arrogant-prins-joachim-pa-skoleskibet-danmark-irettesatte-en-journalist_news Arrogant Prince Joachim].&lt;/ref&gt;}} or during military service. In other contexts, it has come to seem excessively formal and old-fashioned to most Danes.{{refn|A 2012 survey found that only 6% of Danes would use {{lang|da|De}} towards anyone they met and 16% would self-consciously never use it. However, 64% accepted its use towards members of the [[Danish royal family]].&lt;ref name=bork&gt;Etik.dk. ''[http://m.etik.dk/artikel/469393:Danmark--Hver-fjerde-dansker-vil-afskaffe--De Hver fjerde dansker vil afskaffe 'De']'' ["One in four Danes want to abolish '{{lang|da|De}}'&amp;thinsp;"]. 6 July 2012. {{da-icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Even at job interviews and among [[f
olketing|parliamentarians]],&lt;ref&gt;During debates at the [[Folketing]], members are required to address one another in the third person by title or with the prefix of {{lang|da|hr.}} (Mr.) or {{lang|da|fru}} (Mrs.), {{lang|da|frøken}} (Miss) having recently been given up. In debates away from the rostrum, however, they invariably default to {{lang|da|du}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|da|du}} has become standard.

In written Danish, {{lang|da|De}} remains current in legal, legislative, and formal business documents, as well as in some translations from other languages. This is sometimes audience-dependent, as in the Danish government's general use of {{lang|da|du}} except in healthcare information directed towards the elderly,{{refn|The same 2012 survey said 46% of Danes use {{lang|da|De}} when speaking towards the elderly, out of respect. At the same time, the elderly were much more supportive of abolishing the word entirely.&lt;ref name="bork"/&gt;}} where {{lang|da|De}} is still used. Other times, it is maintained as an affectation, as by the staff of some formal restaurants, the {{lang|da|[[Weekendavisen]]|italic=yes}} newspaper, [[TV 2 (Denmark)|TV 2]] announcers, and the avowedly conservative [[Maersk]] corporation. Attempts by other corporations to avoid sounding either stuffy or too informal by employing circumlocutions — using [[passive voice|passive phrasing]] or using the pronoun {{lang|da|man}} ("one") — have generally proved awkward and been ill-received,&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Erik. ''Skulle vi ikke være Des''. ''[http://www.målogmæle.dk/MoM-arkiv/MoM_21/MoM21_1.pdf Mål og Mæle]'', #1. 1998. {{Da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (with the notable exception of the national railway [[Danske Statsbaner|DSB]]) most have opted for the more personable {{lang|da|du}} form.

===== Icelandic =====
Modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] is the Scandinavian dialect closest to [[Old Norse]], which made a distinction between the plural {{lang|is|þér}} and the dual {{lang|is|þið}}. This distinction continued in written Icelandic the early 1920 when the plural {{lang|is|þér}} was also used on formal occasions. The formal usage of {{lang|is|þér}} seems to have pushed the dual {{lang|is|þið}} to take over the plural so modern Icelandic normally uses {{lang|is|þið}} as a plural. However, in formal documents such as by the president {{lang|is|þér}} is still used as plural, and the usage of {{lang|is|þér}} as plural and {{lang|is|þið}} as dual is still retained in the Icelandic translation of the Christian scriptures. There are still a number of fixed expressions — particularly religious adages such as "seek and ye shall find" ({{lang|is|leitið og þér munuð finna}}) — and the formal pronoun is sometimes used in translations from a language that adheres to a T–V distinction, but otherwise it appears only when one wants to be excessively formal either from the gravity of the occasion (as in court proceedings and legal correspondence) or out of contempt (in order to ridicule another person's self-importance), and {{lang|is|þú}} is used in all other cases.

===== Norwegian =====
In [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], the polite form {{lang|nb|De}}/{{lang|nb|Dem}} ({{lang|nb|[[Bokmål]]|italic=no}}) and {{lang|nn|De}}/{{lang|nn|Dykk}} ({{lang|nn|[[Nynorsk]]|italic=no}}) has more or less disappeared in both spoken and written language. Norwegians now exclusively use {{lang|no|du}}, and the polite form does not have a strong cultural pedigree in the country. Until recently, {{lang|no|De}} would sometimes be found in written works, business letters, plays and translations where an impression of formality must be retained. The popular belief that {{lang|no|De}} is reserved for the [[king of Norway|king]] is incorrect, since according to royal etiquette, the King (and other members of the royal family) will be addressed as {{lang|nb|Deres majestet}} ({{lang|nb|Bokmål|italic=no}})/{{lang|nn|Dykkar majestet}} ({{lang|nn|Nynorsk|italic=no}}) (Your majesty) or in third person singular as {{lang|no|Hans majestet}} (His majesty), {{lang|nb|Hennes majestet}}/{{lang|nn|Hennar majestet}} (Her majesty), {{lang|no|Kongen}} (the King), {{lang|no|Dronningen}} (the Queen) and similar.

Norwegians generally refer to one another by first name only, unless the person is better known by full or last name only. This also contributes to the weakening of these pronouns and a general pattern of declining use of polite speech. For example, a student might address their professor by their first name, but would refer to a leading politician by their last name. Norwegian politicians and celebrities are sometimes referred to by their first names, especially in newspaper headlines, while the text of the article most likely would use the person's last name. Nicknames are not very common.

The distinction between {{lang|nb|Bokmål|italic=no}} and {{lang|nn|Nynorsk|italic=no}} exists primarily for written Norwegian (most Norwegians speak dialects that differ from the standard written forms), and the T–V rules are the same for both forms—except that {{lang|nb|Bokmål|italic=no}} uses the third person plural to indicate politeness (as in German), while {{lang|nn|Nynorsk|italic=no}} uses the second person plural (as in French). In both forms, when these pronouns are used to indicate politeness, they are always capitalised (to show deference, and separate them from when they indicate, respectively, the third and second person plural).

===== Swedish =====
{{Main|Du-reformen}}
In [[Swedish language|Swedish]], there has in the last two centuries been a marked difference between usage in [[Finland Swedish]] and in [[Sweden]].

In the Swedish of Sweden, the polite {{lang|sv|Ni}} was known from earlier epochs, but had come to be considered somewhat careless, bullying or rude; instead, an intricate system had evolved in order to prudently step around pronouns almost altogether. Parts of this system began to erode around the Second World War or so, but the essentials held up into the 1960s.

As the 20th century progressed, this circumlocutive system of addressing, with its innumerable ambiguities and opportunities for unintentional offence, was increasingly felt as a nuisance. In the sixties, the so-called {{lang|sv|[[du-reformen]]}} ('thou-reform') was carried out. First, authorities and influential circles tried rehabilitating the {{lang|sv|Ni}} in a so-called "{{lang|sv|ni}} reform"—but most people could not bring themselves to feel civil using that. Then, almost overnight and dubbed the "{{lang|sv|du}} reform", the system broke down, and {{lang|sv|du}} (noted as informal above) became the accepted way of addressing anyone except for royalty.

Addressing royalty went somewhat more slowly from a universal {{lang|sv|Ers majestät}} ('Your Majesty'), etc., to that address only on formal occasions, otherwise replaced by third person (singular if the addressee is single) with title ({{lang|sv|K(on)ungen}} 'the King', etc.).

These rules still apply, with marginal exceptions. The vast majority of Swedes, including younger people in most or all situations, stick to the {{lang|sv|du}}. In order to "alleviate the intrusion" in writing, e.g. in letters or in advertisement, the {{lang|sv|Du}} can be capitalized. That usage was most widespread in the early days of universal ''du'' address; it has become slightly more common again simultaneously with the partial {{lang|sv|Ni}} revival.

Finland Swedish has undergone a similar development to mainland Swedish since the 1960s, but slower and slightly less. There, one may have to reckon with influence from the [[Finnish language]], still slightly more conservative. In Finland Swedish, the second person plural form {{lang|sv|Ni}} (noted as formal above) was indeed the traditional respectful address to a single person up to the 1970s or so.

Swedish, also, has verbs for the addresses: {{lang|sv|dua}} 'to say {{lang|sv|du}}', and {{lang|sv|nia}} 'to say {{lang|sv|ni}}'.

==== Scots ====
In [[Modern Scots]] the second person singular nominative {{lang|sco|thoo}} ({{IPA|[ðuː]}}, [[Southern Scots]] {{IPA|[ðʌu]}}, [[Shetlandic]] {{IPA|[duː]}}) survived in colloquial speech until the mid 19th century in most of lowland Scotland.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} It has since been replaced by {{lang|sco|ye}}/{{lang|sco|you}} in most areas except in [[Insular Scots]] where {{lang|sco|thee}} ({{IPA|[ðiː]}}, Shetlandic {{IPA|[diː]}}) is also used, in [[North Northern Scots]] and in some Southern Scots varieties. {{lang|sco|Thoo}} is used as the familiar form by parents speaking to children, elders to youngsters, or between friends or equals. The second person formal singular {{lang|sco|ye}} or {{lang|sco|you}} is used when speaking to a superior or when a youngster addresses an elder. The older second person singular possessive {{lang|sco|thy}} ({{IPA|[ðai]}}), and {{lang|sco|thee}} ({{IPA|[ði]}}, Shetlandic {{IPA|[diː]}} along with {{lang|sco|thine(s)}} {{IPA|[dəin(z)]}}) still survive to some extent where {{lang|sco|thoo}} remains in use.

==== Yiddish ====
[[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] makes use of the second person plural form as the polite form for both singular and plural. In the second person plural form {{lang|yi|איר}} ({{lang|yi-Latn|ir}}), there is therefore no distinction between formal and informal forms. There is a [[dialect]]al pronoun {{lang|yi|עץ}} ({{lang|yi-Latn|ets}}) strictly for informal second-person plural form, but this pronoun is rarely used today and is only found in some dialects of Poland and neighboring regions.

Given that old German dialects were the main influence on the development of the Yiddish language, this form may be recognized with older polite forms of the German language.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

=== Romance languages ===
==== French ====
In most [[French language|French]]-speaking regions (Canada is an exception; see "[[#North American French|North American French]]" below), a rigid T–V distinction is upheld. With regard to the second person singular, {{lang|fr|tu}} is used informally, whereas {{lang|fr|vous}} is used to convey formality. (The second person plural is always {{lang|fr|vous}}.) The formal {{lang|fr|vous}} is expected when encountering any unknown adult under normal circumstances. In general, the switch from {{lang|fr|vous}} to {{lang|fr|tu}} is "negotiated" on a case-by-case basis; it can happen nearly unconsciously, or can be explicitly negotiated. For instance, some couples have been known to call each other {{lang|fr|vous}} for some time while dating, and gradually switch to calling each other {{lang|fr|tu}}. The verb {{wikt-lang|fr|tutoyer}} means "address someone with {{lang|fr|tu}}-forms, speak informally"; by contrast {{lang|fr|vouvoyer}} means "address someone with {{wikt-lang|fr|vous}} forms". Rigidly sticking to ''vous'' can become equally awkward in a long-standing relationship.

In certain circumstances, however, {{lang|fr|tu}} is used more broadly. For example, new acquaintances who are conscious of having something socially significant in common (e.g., student status, or the same "rank" in some hierarchy) often use ''tu'' more or less immediately. In some cases, there may be an explicitly defined practice in a particular company, political party, as to the use of {{lang|fr|tu}} and {{lang|fr|vous}}. Also, using the {{lang|fr|vous}} in conjunction with someone's given name is rather current in France as a less formal way of addressing someone, e.g. at work, among members of an association etc. Children and adolescents generally use {{lang|fr|tu}} to speak with someone of their own age, whether known or not. {{lang|fr|Tu}} can also be used to show disrespect to a stranger, such as when surprising a thief or cursing other drivers on the road.

{{lang|fr|Vous}} may be used to distance oneself from a person with whom one does not want to interact. Additionally, two people who use {{lang|fr|tu}} in their private interactions may consciously switch back to {{lang|fr|vous}} in public in order to act appropriately in a formal or professional environment, to play the part in an artificially constructed situation (such as between co-hosts of a television show), or simply to conceal the nature of their relationship from others.

In families, {{lang|fr|vous}} was traditionally used to address older family members. Children were taught to use {{lang|fr|vous}} to address their parents, and {{lang|fr|vous}} was used until about 1950 between spouses of the higher classes. Former president [[Jacques Chirac]] and his wife Bernadette are a prominent example of the continuation of this usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/19/style/19iht-blume.t.html |title=Mastering the Unmasterable: A French Puzzle |author=Mary Blume |work=[[International Herald Tribune]] |date=19 February 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When praying, {{lang|fr|tu}} is nowadays often used in addressing the deity, though {{lang|fr|vous}} was used in [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] prayers until the [[Second Vatican Council]], and is still used to address the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]. In Louisiana, however, {{lang|fr|vous}} is always used to convey a sense of respect and reverence when praying.

In Walloon, the use of which tends, in any case, to be restricted mostly to "familiar" contexts, {{lang|wa|vos}} (equivalent to {{lang|fr|vous}}) is the general usage and is considered informal and friendly. {{lang|wa|Ti}} (equivalent to {{lang|fr|tu}}), on the other hand, is considered vulgar, and its use can be taken as an expression of an aggressive attitude towards the person addressed. This influence from Walloon affects the usage of {{lang|fr|tu}} and {{lang|fr|vous}} in the French spoken in Belgium, though more so among people accustomed to using Walloon as their everyday language (a tiny minority, mostly in the countryside). The influence of Standard French, particularly as exercised through the [[mass media]], is eroding this particularity among younger French-speakers.

In the {{lang|fr|[[early modern France|ancien régime]]}}, the use of honorific styles or their abbreviation {{lang|fr|Elle}} (literally ''she'', irrespective of the gender of the addressee, as the honorifics were feminine nouns) together with the 3rd person singular was also common. See below for [[#Italian|Italian]] which has kept this style.

===== North American French =====
[[Canadian French|North American dialects of French]], including [[Quebec French]] and [[Acadian French]] as well as [[Louisiana French]], permit and expect a far broader usage of the familiar {{lang|fr|tu}} than in [[Standard French]]. There are still circumstances in which it is necessary to say {{lang|fr|vous}}: in a formal interview (notably for a job) or when addressing people of very high rank (such as judges or prime ministers), senior citizens, between professors and students in universities, towards customers or new acquaintances in a formal setting. As acquaintances become familiar with one another, they may find {{lang|fr|vous}} to be unnecessarily formal and may agree to return to the {{lang|fr|tu}} with which they are generally more comfortable.

For a number of Francophones in Canada, {{lang|fr|vous}} sounds stilted or snobbish, and archaic. {{lang|fr|Tu}} is by no means restricted to intimates or social inferiors. There is however an important minority of people, often those who call for a use of standard French in Quebec, who prefer to be addressed as {{lang|fr|vous}}. At [[Radio-Canada]] (the public broadcaster, often considered as establishing the normative objectives of standard French in Canada), the use of {{lang|fr|vous}} is widespread even among colleagues.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

===== African French =====
In {{lang|fr|[[Côte d'Ivoire]]|italic=no}}, local languages (such as [[Baoulé language|Baoulé]], [[Dyula language|Dioula]], etc.) do not make a distinction between informal or formal pronouns, which reflects on the local usage of French. It is thus uncommon to call an individual {{lang|fr|vous}}. A waiter, shop-keeper or taxi driver can very well call a customer {{lang|fr|vous}}, just like an employee towards a superior. For example, an accountant could call her direct branch manager {{lang|fr|tu}}, but will still use {{lang|fr|vous}} to address the company's CEO.

Relationships between men and women are typically less formal than between people of the same gender (a female supermarket worker will more easily say {{lang|fr|tu}} towards a male customer than her male colleague).

Even in formal situations (business, politics), the superiors can often be called in a familiar way by subordinates who will use affectionate terms of address such as {{lang|fr|vieux père}}, {{lang|fr|papa}}, {{lang|fr|tonton}}, {{lang|fr|patron}}, {{lang|fr|boss}} for males, {{lang|fr|la vieille mère}}, {{lang|fr|maman}}, {{lang|fr|tata}}, {{lang|fr|patronne}} for females, instead of the standard {{lang|fr|monsieur}} and {{lang|fr|madame}}. Superiors reciprocate with terms of address such as {{lang|fr|mon fils}}, {{lang|fr|mon petit}}, {{lang|fr|ma chérie}}, {{lang|fr|ma fille}}. All those terms of address typically exclude the use of "vous".

The use is also conditioned to the "level" of French being spoken: using a Standard French code and/or accent (what is call {{lang|fr-CI|chocoter}} in [[Ivorian French]]) will prompt addresses of {{lang|fr|vous}}, whereas [[code switching]] to Ivorian French will typically invite a concomitant switch to {{lang|fr|tu}}.

Informed local people will still, most of the time, make a conscious effort to use {{lang|fr|vous}} and {{lang|fr|monsieur}}/{{lang|fr|madame}} when addressing Westerners in formal situations (unless, again, that Westerner talks Ivorian French rather than Standard French). Other groups of foreigners such as other Africans, Asians or Middle-Eastern people are less likely to enjoy that "privilege".

The use of {{lang|fr|vous}}, just like the use of {{lang|fr|monsieur}} and {{lang|fr|madame}}, is thus restricted to very formal situations where Standard French is being used, mostly for the higher class between themselves: managers at a meeting with the CEO, representatives of different political parties, upper class people who don't know each other at a social gathering. A switching to {{lang|fr|tu}} can still happen as soon as the formal event is over (such as managers getting out of the meeting room) or just after having been introduced to each other – usually simultaneous to a switch from Standard French to Ivorian French.

==== Catalan ====
[[Catalan language|Catalan]] uses the singular pronouns {{lang|ca|tu}} (informal) and {{lang|ca|vostè}} (formal), while {{lang|ca|vosaltres}} (informal) and {{lang|ca|vostès}} (formal) are used for two or more addressees. The form {{lang|ca|vós}}, used instead of {{lang|ca|tu}} to address someone respectfully, follows the same concordance rules as the French {{lang|fr|vous}} (verbs in second person plural, adjectives in singular), and {{lang|ca|vostè}} follows the same concordance rules as the Spanish {{lang|es|usted}} (verbs in third person). {{lang|ca|Vostè}} originated from {{lang|ca|vostra mercè}} as a [[calque]] from Spanish, and replaced the original Catalan form {{lang|ca|vós}}.

In some dialects, {{lang|ca|vós}} is no longer used. Other dialects have a three-way distinction {{lang|ca|tu}} / {{lang|ca|vós}} / {{lang|ca|vostè}}, where {{lang|ca|vós}} is used as a respectful form for elders and respected friends, and {{lang|ca|vostè}} for foreigners and people whom one does not know well. {{lang|ca|Vostè}} is more distant than {{lang|ca|vós}}.

The Administration uses {{lang|ca|vós}} to address people.

==== Spanish ====
{{See also|Spanish dialects|voseo}}

In [[Peninsular Spanish|Peninsular]], [[Mexican Spanish|Mexican]], and [[Peruvian Spanish|Peruvian]] Spanish, as in [[#Italian|Italian]], an original {{lang|es|tú}} and {{lang|es|vos}} usage similar to [[#French|French]] disappeared in the [[Early Modern period]]. Today, {{lang|es|tú}} is used for informal and familiar address while the respectful form is the third-person {{lang|es|usted}}, which can be used respectfully to anyone. Scholars argue that {{lang|es|usted}} evolved as a contraction of the [[Old Spanish]] {{lang|osp|Vuestra Merced}} ("your mercy"), with {{lang|es|vusted}} as a transitional form. In some cases, the title {{lang|es|[[Don (honorific)|Don]]}} is also employed when speaking to a respected older man, while {{lang|es|Doña}} is used for older women.

Among [[Spanish dialects]], the situation is complicated by the fact that the [[Spanish Empire]] was created during the middle of this linguistic shift, leading to differing linguistic norms being established across its territory. The region surrounding the [[Colombia]]n capital of [[Bogotá]] (although not the city itself) preserves an alternate respectful form {{lang|es-CO|sumercé}} simplified from a different contraction of {{lang|es|vuestra merced}}. In [[Rioplatense]], {{lang|es|vos}} was preserved — but as a replacement for {{lang|es|tú}} and not as a respectful form of address; in [[Chilean Spanish|Chile]], in Western [[Venezuela]], parts of [[Colombia]] and in [[Central American Spanish|Central America]], {{lang|es|vos}} is used in spoken address and {{lang|es|tú}} is used in print and to express moderate formality, that is, it has essentially switched its function to the former role of {{lang|es|vos}}. In [[Costa Rica]] and part of Colombia, {{lang|es|usted}} is used as the common pronoun, using it both in formal and informal situations.

In the second-person plural, modern Spanish speakers in most of [[Spain]] employ {{lang|es-ES|vosotros}} (masculine) and {{lang|es-ES|vosotras}} (feminine) informally and (as the third-person plural) {{lang|es-ES|ustedes}} to express respect. In western [[Andalusian Spanish|Andalucia]], {{lang|es|ustedes}} is used in both contexts, but its verbs are conjugated in the second-person plural. Throughout the Americas and the [[Canarian Spanish|Canaries]], {{lang|es|ustedes}} is used in all contexts and in the third person.

==== Portuguese ====
{{See also|Portuguese personal pronouns}}

===== European Portuguese =====
In [[European Portuguese]] (as well as in [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|Africa]], [[Timor-Leste]] and [[Macau]]), {{lang|pt|tu}} (singular "you") is commonly used as the familiar addressing pronoun, while {{lang|pt|você}} is a general form of address; {{lang|pt|vocês}} (plural both of {{lang|pt|tu}} and {{lang|pt|você}}) is used for both familiar and general. The forms {{lang|pt|o senhor}} and {{lang|pt|a senhora}} (plurals {{lang|pt|os senhores}} and {{lang|pt|as senhoras}}) are used for more formal situations (roughly equivalent to "Mr/Sir" and "Mrs/Madam".) Similarly to some Romance languages (e.g. Italian), {{lang|pt|tu}} can be omitted because the verb ending provides the necessary information. Not so much so with {{lang|pt|você}} or {{lang|pt|o senhor}} / {{lang|pt|a senhora}} because the verb ending is the same as for the third person (historically, {{lang|pt|você}} derives from {{lang|pt|vossa mercê}} ("your mercy" or "your grace") via the intermediate forms {{lang|pt|vossemecê}} and {{lang|pt|vosmecê}}). The second person plural pronoun {{lang|pt|vós}}, from Latin {{lang|la|vos}}, is archaic in most of the Portuguese-speaking world, but can be heard in liturgy and has a limited regional use.

===== Brazilian Portuguese =====
In [[Brazilian Portuguese]], {{lang|pt|você}} and {{lang|pt|vocês}} (singular and plural "you", respectively) are used informally, while {{lang|pt|o senhor}} and {{lang|pt|a senhora}} ("Mr"/"Sir" and "Mrs"/"Madam", plurals {{lang|pt|os senhores}} and {{lang|pt|as senhoras}}) are used in formal speech. Although now seen as archaic, {{lang|pt|a senhorita}} is used when speaking ironically, very formally or when one is demonstrating respect to a superior and it is sometimes replaced by {{lang|pt-BR|moça}} ("Lady"). Informal terms of respect to superiors, elders or strangers are {{lang|pt-BR|Seu}} (abbreviation of {{lang|pt|senhor}}) and {{lang|pt|Dona}} (feminine of {{lang|pt|Dom}} i.e. {{lang|pt|Don}}). {{lang|pt-BR|Moço}}/{{lang|pt-BR|rapaz}} and {{lang|pt-BR|moça}} ("Lad"/"Young man" and "Lady") are used by seniors when addressing non-intimate youths and also as an equalizing form among strange youths. {{lang|pt-BR|Jovem}} ("youngster") is used in the same manner by elders when addressing strange youths of both genders.

On premises where the atmosphere requires extreme formality like the Senate or different courts, the protocolar forms to address dignitaries {{lang|pt|Vossa Excelência}} ("Your Excellence") and {{lang|pt|Vossa Senhoria}} ("Your Lordship/Ladyship") can still be heard. In a direct address to a judge or the president, {{lang|pt|Vossa Excelência}} must follow the vocatives {{lang|pt|Meritíssimo/a}} ("Your Honour", literally "full of merit") and {{lang|pt|Sr/Sra Presidente}} ("Mr/Mrs" President). When addressing an ecclesiastical dignitary the form {{lang|pt|Vossa Reverência}} ("Your Reverence") is used. Although {{lang|pt|Vossa Senhoria}} is regarded as protocolar, it is an equalizing form.

In many parts of the geographic extension of the language e.g. most of [[South Region, Brazil|Southern]] and [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern]] Brazil, some [[sociolect]]s of coastal São Paulo, mainly in Greater [[Santos (São Paulo)|Santos]], colloquial {{lang|pt-BR|[[carioca]]}} sociolect, mainly among the less educated and some all-[[social class|class]] [[youth]]s of [[Greater Rio de Janeiro]], and in [[Riverense Portuñol language|Uruguay]], ''tu'' (singular "you" or simply "thou") is used informally, but the plural form is always {{lang|pt|vocês}}. For the overwhelmingly majority of people, the pronoun {{lang|pt|tu}} is commonly used with the verb conjugated as {{lang|pt|você}} (third-person singular) rather than in the traditional conjugation (second-person singular). {{lang|pt|Tu}} is somewhat familiar, even intimate, and should never be addressed to superiors, or strange elders, while {{lang|pt|você}} is much more neutral, although equalizing.

The dialect that includes {{lang|pt-BR|[[Florianópolis]]|italic=no}}, capital city of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], as well as its shore and inner regions in the proximity like [[Blumenau]], is an exception, as the use of {{lang|pt|tu}} is widespread, even addressing formally to an authority or to a superior. It is one of the few dialects in [[Brazil]] in which second-person singular agreement is used (along with the relatively conservative dialect of the state of {{lang|pt-BR|Maranhão|italic=no}}).

==== Italian ====
In [[Standard Italian]] the informal second-person singular pronoun is {{lang|it|tu}} and the formal second-person singular pronoun is {{lang|it|Lei}} (&lt;small&gt;inf.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"she", &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"her"), always used with the third-person singular conjugation of the verb. The pronouns may be freely omitted.&lt;ref&gt;As especially polite alternatives, one may capitalize the pronoun to {{lang|it|Lei}} or use {{lang|it|Ella}} (lit.&amp;nbsp;"She"); both sound quite archaic. If the pronoun is capitalized, the majuscule is applied to all its forms including the [[enclitic]]s: {{lang|it|...vorrei incontrarLa per parlarGliene}} ("I would like to talk to you about it").&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the original meaning of {{lang|it|lei}}, modern Italian typically [[agreement (linguistics)|concords]] with the gender of the addressee when {{lang|it|lei}} is the sentence subject; using feminine adjectives for a male addressee is not especially insulting but sounds confusing, literary or even archaic. When {{lang|it|lei}} is an object, using feminine adjectives is normal ({{lang|it|l'ho vista}}, i.e. "I saw you (m.)"), whereas gender concord is considered non-standard ({{lang|it|l'ho visto}}, i.e. "I saw you (m.)).

{{lang|it|Lei}} is normally used in formal settings or with strangers, although it implies a sense of distance (even coldness) similar to the [[#French|French]] use of {{lang|fr|vous}}. Presently Italian adults prefer to employ {{lang|it|tu}} towards strangers until around 30 years old. It is used reciprocally between adults; the usage may not be reciprocal when young people address older strangers or otherwise respected people. Students are addressed with {{lang|it|tu}} by their teachers until the end of high school with few exceptions and usually with {{lang|it|Lei}} in universities. Students might use {{lang|it|tu}} with their teachers in elementary school, but switch to {{lang|it|Lei}} from middle school. {{lang|it|Tu}} is the common form of address on the Internet&lt;ref name="bbcnewsmag lawn 2012" /&gt; and within some professions {{ndash}} such as journalism and law {{ndash}} as a recognition of comradeship. In the law however the {{lang|it|tu}} is only used in informal settings; in the courtroom it is used only to small children, if ever any happens to appear there. The second-person plural pronoun is {{lang|it|voi}}. Its polite counterpart was formerly {{lang|it|Loro}} ("They"), but it is now little used outside of self-consciously formal situations such as expensive restaurants.

{{wikt-lang|it|Voi}} is the traditional polite form of address in [[Tuscan dialect]]s: [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] employs it in his 14th-century ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' when showing particular respect.&lt;ref&gt;As when meeting his former teacher: {{lang|it|Siete Voi qui, ser Brunetto?}} ("Are you here, sir Brunetto?").&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|it|Lei}} began to replace it during the [[Renaissance]] and then, under [[#Spanish|Spanish]] [[Sack of Rome (1527)|influence]], it became common to contract obsequious honorifics such as "Your Lordship", "Eminence", and "Majesty", all of which are feminine third-person singular nouns in Italian ({{lang|it|Vostra Signoria}}, {{lang|it|Eminenza}}, {{lang|it|Maestà}}). Over the next four centuries, all three pronouns — {{lang|it|tu}}, {{lang|it|Voi}}, {{lang|it|Lei}} — were employed together to express degrees of formality and status, as displayed in [[Alessandro Manzoni|Manzoni]]'s 19th-century ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]''. {{lang|it|Voi}} continues to be used by some speakers, particularly of [[Regional Italian|Southern dialects]], as an alternative to {{lang|it|Lei}} in polite address, but its use is increasingly uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Serianni |first=Luca |title= La Crusca per voi |url= http://www.accademiadellacrusca.it/it/lingua-italiana/consulenza-linguistica/domande-risposte/allocutivi-cortesia |issue=no. 20 |date= April 2000 |language=it }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of {{lang|it|Voi}} was imposed by the [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Fascists]] from 1938 to 1944. {{lang|it|Voi}} still appears in comics, and in instruction books and advertisements where {{lang|it|Lei}} would sound too distant, but in the latter case most of the time it is used directly as a plural and not as a polite singular. (An example of all three forms of address in action is the Italian ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'' translation: a character such as Aragorn is usually addressed as {{lang|it|lei}}, but neither {{lang|it|lei}} nor {{lang|it|tu}} seemed appropriate for how Samwise addresses his higher-class friend and employer Frodo; Sam calls Frodo {{lang|it|voi}}, in consequence.)

Although seldom encountered, the third person {{lang|it|la Signoria Vostra}} or {{lang|it|la S.V.}} ("Your Lord-" or "Ladyship") is sometimes seen in formal correspondence and invitations, as a stronger form of its descendant {{lang|it|lei}}.

==== Romanian ====
The [[Romanian language|Romanian]] word {{wikt-lang|ro|dumneavoastră}} when used for the second-person singular formal takes plural verbs but singular adjectives, similar to French {{lang|fr|vous}}. It is used roughly in the same manner as in Continental French and shows no signs of disappearing. It is also used as a more formal {{wikt-lang|ro|voi}}. It originates from {{lang|ro|domnia voastră}} – your lordship. In the past it was used extreme rarely to nobles especially, but its sense extended to other people in the 20th century but not so common and when the communists arrived it took the actual form.{{clarify|date=April 2017}}{{cn|date=April 2017}} As happens with all subject pronouns, {{lang|ro|dumneavoastră}} is often omitted from sentences, its use being implied by verbs in the second person plural form.

The form {{wikt-lang|ro|dumneata}} (originating from {{lang|ro|domnia ta}} – thy lordship) is less distant than {{lang|ro|dumneavoastră}} and somewhat midway between {{lang|ro|tu}} and {{lang|ro|dumneavoastră}}. The verb is conjugated, as for {{lang|ro|tu}}, in the second person singular form. Older people towards younger people and peers favor {{lang|ro|dumneata}}. Its use is gradually declining.

A more colloquial form of {{lang|ro|dumneata}} is {{wikt-lang|ro|mata}}, {{wikt-lang|ro|matale}} or {{wikt-lang|ro|tălică}}. It is more familiar than {{lang|ro|tu}} and is used only in some regions of Romania. It is used only with immediate family members, and is spelled and pronounced the same in all cases, similar to {{lang|ro|dumneavoastră}}. It is used with verbs in the second person singular, as is {{lang|ro|tu}}.

The plural form is a recent borrowing. [[Proto-Romanian language|Proto-Romanian]] and [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], like Classical Latin, do not have the plural form.

==== Sicilian ====
Most dialects of Sicilian Language have utilised {{lang|scn|vussìa}}, {{lang|scn|vossìa}}, or {{lang|scn|vassa}} to express formality. However, due to encroachment by Italian language {{lang|it|Lei}} has become increasingly common particularly among younger speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Introduction to Sicilian Grammar |last=Cipolla |first=Gaetano |publisher=Legas |year= |isbn=1881901254 |pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hellenic ===
==== Ancient and Hellenistic or Koine Greek ====
In [[Ancient Greek]], {{lang|grc-Latn|sý}} ({{lang|grc|σύ}}) was the singular, and {{lang|grc-Latn|hymeis}} ({{lang|grc|ὑμεῖς}}) the plural, with no distinction for honorific or familiar. [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] addresses King [[Agrippa II]] as {{lang|grc-Latn|sý}} ([[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 26:2).

Later, {{lang|grc-Latn|hymeís}} and {{lang|grc-Latn|hēmeís}} ({{lang|grc|ἡμεῖς}},"we") became too close in pronunciation, and a new plural {{lang|grc-Latn|seís}} or {{lang|grc-Latn|eseís}} ({{lang|grc|σεις}}/{{lang|grc|εσείς}}) was invented, the initial {{lang|grc-Latn|e}} ({{lang|grc|ε}}) being a [[euphony|euphonic]] prefix that was also extended to the singular ({{lang|grc-Latn|sý}}/{{lang|grc-Latn|esý}}).

==== Modern Greek ====
In [[Greek language|Modern Greek]], {{lang|el|εσείς}} ({{lang|el-Latn|eseís}}, second person plural) with second person plural verb conjugation is used as the formal counterpart of {{lang|el|εσύ}} ({{lang|el-Latn|esý}}, second person singular) when talking to strangers and elders, although in everyday life it is common to speak to strangers of your age or younger using the singular pronoun. In addition, the informal second person singular is used even with older people you are acquainted with, depending on the level of mutual familiarity.

Since the formal {{lang|el|εσείς}} ({{lang|el-Latn|eseís}}) has become less common outside schools and workplaces, many people often do not know which form to use (because using a formal version might sound too snobbish even to an elder and using the informal version might sound inappropriate to some strangers) and thus prefer to replace verbs with nouns (avoiding the dilemma) until enough information on the counterpart's intentions is gathered in order to choose between formal or informal second person pronoun and verb conjugation. A good rule of thumb is that singular accompanies first names and plural accompanies surnames with title (Mr, Mrs, etc.). Exceptions are rare, for example younger schoolchildren may address their teacher in the plural, title and ''first name'', or an officer may address a soldier in the singular and surname. The sequence singular-title-surname is a faux pas that can often indicate lack of education, of good manners, or of both.

The modern [[social custom]] when using Greek in Greece is to ask the other person "may we speak in the singular?" in which the other person is expected to answer "yes" and afterwards the discussion continues using the informal {{lang|el|εσύ}} ({{lang|el-Latn|esý}}); it is unthinkable for the other person to answer "no" or show preference for plural forms, and for this reason one should not even ask this question to a person of high status, such as a professional. Therefore, asking this question can itself be considered a form of disrespect in some social situations. Likewise, not asking this question and simply using the singular without prior explicit or implicit agreement would also be considered disrespectful in various social contingencies. In other cases, even using the formal plural (without a question) could also be considered offensive. A person being inappropriately addressed in the singular will often indicate their displeasure by insisting on responding in the plural, in a display of irony that may or may not be evident to the other party. A similar social custom exists with the words {{lang|el|κύριε}} ([[Mr]]/[[Sir]]) and {{lang|el|κυρία}} ([[Mrs]]/[[Madam]]), which can show both respect and a form of "mock respect" essentially communicating disapproval, often depending on the voice intonation and the social situation. Overall, the distinction between formal and informal forms of address and when to use each can be quite subtle and not easily discernible by a non-native speaker.

[[Cypriot Greek]] traditionally had no T–V distinction, with even persons of very high social status addressed in the singular, usually together with an honorific or title such as {{lang|el-CY|δάσκαλε}} ("teacher", mainly for priests) or {{lang|el-CY|μάστρε}} (literally "master", loosely "sir"). Even today, the singular form is used much more frequently in [[Cyprus]] compared to Greece, although this is changing under the influence of [[Standard Modern Greek]]. The plural form is now expected in a formal setting.

=== Celtic ===
==== Scottish Gaelic ====
In [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]], the informal form of the second-person singular is {{lang|gd|thu}}/{{lang|gd|tu}} (emphatic: {{lang|gd|thusa}}/{{lang|gd|tusa}}), used when addressing a person the speaker knows well, or when addressing a person younger or relatively the same age as the speaker. When addressing a superior, an elder, or a stranger, or in conducting business, the form {{lang|gd|sibh}} (emphatic: {{lang|gd|sibhse}}) is used. ({{lang|gd|Sibh}} is also the second person plural). This distinction carries over into [[conjugated preposition|prepositional pronouns]]: for instance, {{lang|gd|agad}} and {{lang|gd|agaibh}} (at you), {{lang|gd|riut}} and {{lang|gd|ribh}} (against you), {{lang|gd|romhad}} and {{lang|gd|romhaibh}} (before you), etc., and into [[possessive pronoun]]s {{lang|gd|do}} and {{lang|gd|ur}} (your).

==== Irish ====
In Irish, the use of {{lang|ga|sibh}} as an address to one person has died out, and {{lang|gd|tú}} is preferred. Formerly, [[Roman Catholic]] priests were addressed with the plural form {{lang|gd|sibh}}, especially in Ulster, due to the possibility that the priest may be carrying the [[Eucharist]] on his person—belief in the [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]] would require the use of the plural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Subject: Re: sibh &amp; thu |publisher=GAELIC-L Archives |date=29 October 1991 |url=https://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9110&amp;L=gaelic-l&amp;P=16479 |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Welsh, Cornish and Breton ====
Modern [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and [[Breton language|Breton]] all retain a T–V distinction to varying degrees.

In spoken Welsh, the plural pronoun {{lang|cy|chi}} is used when speaking to strangers, elders or superiors, while {{lang|cy|ti}} (or {{lang|cy|chdi}} in some parts of the North) is used with friends, close family, animals and children. {{lang|cy|Ti}} is also the form used when addressing God. Nonetheless, the use of {{lang|cy|chi}} and {{lang|cy|ti}} varies between families and regions, but those guidelines are generally observed.&lt;ref name="JonesWelsh"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ceri Jones |title=Dweud Eich Dweud: A Guide to Colloquial and Idiomatic Welsh |year=2013 |location=Llandysul, Ceredigion |publisher=Gwasg Gomer |origyear=2001 |page=204 }}, which also cites {{cite book |author=Dic Jones |title=Os Hoffech Wybod |edition=1st |location=Caernarfon, Gwynedd |publisher=Gwasg Gwynedd |year=1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{lang|cy|Chwi}} is an alternative to {{lang|cy|chi}} found in very formal literary language. Alongside the usages explained above, [[Silent Generation|those born before 1945]] would, in their youth, use {{lang|cy|chi}} with a girl of about the same age.&lt;ref name="JonesWelsh"/&gt; Similarly to [[Italian language|Italian]], the third person singular is used by some speakers in the former [[Dyfed]] region of west Wales; it appears, however, that the pronoun used – between either {{lang|cy|e}} or {{lang|cy|fe}} (masculine, South), {{lang|cy|o}} or {{lang|cy|fo}} (masculine, North) and {{lang|cy|hi}} (feminine) – depends on the gender of the listener.&lt;ref name="JonesWelsh"/&gt;

A similar distinction exists between Cornish singular {{lang|kw|ty}} / {{lang|kw|chy}} and plural {{lang|kw|hwi}} / {{lang|kw|whi}}. The singular form is used when talking to friends, family, animals and children, and the plural form is used to talk to a group of people, or when being especially polite to one person.

In Breton the second person plural {{lang|kw|c'hwi}} is used as a polite form when addressing a single person and the singular {{lang|kw|te}} is reserved for informal situations. However, in a large area of central Brittany the singular form has been entirely replaced by {{lang|kw|c'hwi}}, as in English.

=== Balto-Slavic ===

==== Russian and Ukrainian (mainly Eastern) ====
Modern [[Russian language|Russian]] distinguishes between the familiar '''{{lang|ru-Latn|ty}}''' ({{lang|ru|ты}}) and the respectful '''{{lang|ru-Latn|vy}}''' ({{lang|ru|вы}}), the latter also being the plural of both forms. (Respectful {{lang|ru-Latn|Vy}} ({{lang|ru|Вы}}) may be capitalised in written correspondence, while plural {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}} is not.) The distinction appeared relatively recently and began to gain currency among the educated classes in the 18th century through French influence.&lt;ref name="popov"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/307220?uid=3738200&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103199636893 On the origin of Russian ''Vy'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} is used among friends and relatives, but the usage depends not only on the closeness of the relationship but also on age and the formality of the situation (e.g., work meeting vs. a party). Children always use {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} to address each other and are addressed in this way by adults but are taught to address adults with {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}}. Younger adults typically also address older adults outside the family as {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}} regardless of intimacy, and may be addressed as {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} in return. When talking to each other young people often start with the formal {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}} but may transition to {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} very quickly in an informal situation. Among older people, {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} is often reserved for closer acquaintances. Unless there is a substantial difference in age, the choice of the form is symmetric: if A uses {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} to address B, then B also uses {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} to address A. While people may transition quickly from {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}} to {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}}, such transition presumes mutual agreement. Use of {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} without consent of the other person is likely to be viewed as poor conduct or even as an insult (or, in the case of opposite-sexed people, overly flirtatious), particularly if the other party maintains using {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}}.

Historically, the rules used to be more [[estates of the realm|class]]-specific: as late as at the end of the 19th century, it was accepted in some circles (in aristocracy and especially gentry) that {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}} was to be used also between friends, between husband and wife, and when addressing one's parents (but not one's children), all of which situations today would strongly call for using {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}}. Meanwhile, up to this day, common people, especially those living in rural areas, hardly ever use the polite {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}}.&lt;ref name="popov" /&gt; Russian speakers online uphold the distinction and mainly use {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}} for strangers, although in the earlier days of internet it was more common and expected to use {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} to address everyone.

The choice between {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} and {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}} is closely related to, yet sometimes different from, the choice of the addressing format – that is, the selection from the first name, [[patronymics]], last name, and the title to be used when addressing the person. Normally, {{lang|ru-Latn|ty}} is associated with the informal addressing by first name only (or, even more informally, by the patronymic only), whereas {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}} is associated with the more formal addressing format of using the first name together with patronymics (roughly analogous to "title followed by last name" in English) or the last name together with a title (the last name is almost never used together with either of the other two names to ''address'' someone, although such combinations are routinely used to ''introduce'' or ''mention'' someone). However, nowadays, {{lang|ru-Latn|vy}} can also be employed while addressing by first name only.

In Ukrainian, the present practice is essentially the same as in Russian, historically this was primarily in the Eastern, Russian-ruled part of Ukraine. Until about 1945, due to Polish influence, the practices in the former [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Volhynia|Volyn]] regions, tended to more closely resemble the Polish practices, as described below. But since those areas became annexed to the Soviet Union, the East Ukrainian and Russian practices have become prevalent all over Ukraine, with the {{lang|uk|панство}} {{lang|uk-Latn|panstvo}}, {{lang|uk|прошу пана}} {{lang|uk-Latn|proshu pana}}, {{lang|uk|прошу пани}} {{lang|uk-Latn|proshu pani}}, etc. forms only being preserved in the émigré diaspora.

==== Serbo-Croatian ====
In all standard forms of [[Serbo-Croatian]], i.e. [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] and [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], the use of {{lang|sh|ti}} is limited to friends and family, and used among children. In any formal use, {{lang|sh|vi}}, the second-person plural, is used only;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |language=German |title=Wörter im Grenzbereich von Lexikon und Grammatik im Serbokroatischen |trans-title=Serbo-Croatian Words on the Border Between Lexicon and Grammar |url= |series=Studies in Slavic Linguistics ; 18 |location=Munich |publisher=Lincom Europa |year=2001 |pages=37–48 |isbn=3-89586-954-6 |lccn=2005530313 |oclc=47905097 |ol=2863539W}} [https://www.webcitation.org/6A80Mj8Bf?url=http://www.snjezana-kordic.de/Summary_Worter.pdf Summary].&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|sh|ti}} can be used among peers in a workplace but is rare in official documents. It is a common misconception, even among native speakers, that {{lang|sh|vi}} is always capitalized when used in formal tone; {{lang|sh|Vi}} is capitalized only in direct personal correspondence between two persons.

With the polite {{lang|sh|vi}}, masculine plural (in participles and adjectives) is used regardless of the sex of the person addressed.

==== Bulgarian ====
[[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] distinguishes between familiar {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}} ({{lang|bg|ти}}) and respectful {{lang|bg-Latn|Vie}} ({{lang|bg|Вие}}). {{lang|bg-Latn|Ti}} is always singular and implies familiarity. {{lang|bg-Latn|Vie}}, the plural of {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}}, also functions as the formal singular.

In addressing more than one person, the plural {{lang|bg-Latn|vie}} is always used. For example, {{lang|bg|'''Вие''' двамата напуснете, моля!}}" means "''You'' two leave, please!"). Here, although {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}} and {{lang|bg-Latn|vie}} both means ''you'', {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}} can not be used.

When addressing a single person, if the people talking are acquainted then singular {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}} is used, otherwise plural {{lang|bg-Latn|Vie}} should be used. Sometimes people start a new acquaintance straightforwardly with singular {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}}, but generally this is considered offensive, rude, or simply impolite. Children are taught to always use {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}} between themselves, but {{lang|bg-Latn|Vie}} for addressing more than one child or an unknown adult.

The grammatically correct spelling of the singular word {{lang|bg-Latn|Vie}} is always with a capital letter, whether being the first word in a sentence or not. For example, the sentence "But ''you'' are wrong!", if spelled (in Bulgarian) {{lang|bg|Но '''Вие''' грешите!}} (the word {{lang|bg|Вие}} with capital {{lang|bg|В}}), it would convey that the speaker is addressing an individual person with a plural, because he/she wants to express a polite, official manner; if spelt {{lang|bg|Но '''вие''' грешите!}} (the second possible Bulgarian translation of "But ''you'' are wrong!"), it would then mean that someone is talking to several persons.

Generally, {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}} is used among friends and relatives. When talking to each other, young people often start with the formal {{lang|bg-Latn|vie}} but quickly transition to {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}} in an informal situation. Unless there is a substantial difference in social situation (e.g. a teacher and a student), the choice of the form is symmetric: if A. uses {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}} to address B., then B. also uses {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}} to address A. While people may transition quickly from {{lang|bg-Latn|vie}} to {{lang|bg-Latn|ti}}, such transition presumes mutual agreement. There is a recent trend not to use the formal {{lang|bg-Latn|Vie}} at all, but this can lead to awkward situations.

==== Macedonian ====
[[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] distinguishes between familiar {{lang|mk-Latn|ti}} ({{lang|mk|ти}}) and respectful {{lang|mk-Latn|vie}} ({{lang|mk|вие}}) – which is also the plural of both forms, used to address a pair or group. (Respectful {{lang|mk-Latn|Vie}} may be capitalized, while plural {{lang|mk-Latn|vie}} is not.) Generally, {{lang|mk-Latn|ti}} is used among friends and relatives, but the usage depends not only on the closeness of the relationship but also on age and the formality of the situation (e.g., work meeting vs. a party). Children always use {{lang|mk-Latn|ti}} to address each other and are addressed in this way by adults, but are taught to address adults with {{lang|mk-Latn|vie}}. Younger adults typically also address older adults outside the family as {{lang|mk-Latn|vie}} regardless of intimacy, and may be addressed as {{lang|mk-Latn|ti}} in return. When talking to each other young people often start with the formal {{lang|mk-Latn|vie}}, but may transit to {{lang|mk-Latn|ti}} very quickly in an informal situation. Among older people, {{lang|mk-Latn|ti}} is often reserved for closer acquaintances. Unless there is a substantial difference in age, the choice of the form is symmetric: if A uses {{lang|mk-Latn|ti}} to address B, then B also uses {{lang|mk-Latn|ti}} to address A. While people may transit quickly from {{lang|mk-Latn|vie}} to {{lang|mk-Latn|ti}}, such transition presumes mutual agreement. Use of {{lang|mk-Latn|ti}} without consent of the other person is likely to be viewed as poor conduct or even as an insult, particularly if the other party maintains using {{lang|mk-Latn|vie}}.

==== Polish ====
{{Main|Polish name#Formal and informal use|Honorifics (linguistics)#Polish|l2=Polish honorifics}}

Polish uses as formal forms the words {{lang|pl|pan}} (meaning "mister" or "gentleman") and {{lang|pl|pani}} ("lady"), and in the plural {{lang|pl|panowie}} ("gentlemen") and {{lang|pl|panie}} ("ladies") respectively, {{lang|pl|państwo}} being used for mixed groups (originally a neutral noun, meaning roughly "lordship", but also, and until today, "state"). {{lang|pl|Państwo}} is used with the plural, like {{lang|pl|panowie}} and {{lang|pl|panie}}. Because of their character as nouns (and not pronouns) these words are used with the third person: For example, the familiar {{lang|pl|Chcesz pić}} ("You want to drink") becomes {{lang|pl|Pan chce pić}} (literally "The gentleman wants to drink").

Further, {{lang|pl|pan}} and {{lang|pl|pani}} can be combined with the first name, the last name and with titles like "President", "Professor", "Doctor", "Editor" and others ({{lang|pl|Pan Prezydent}}, {{lang|pl|pani profesor}} etc.; using these titles is considered necessary); using both ({{lang|pl|Pan Prezydent Kowalski}}, {{lang|pl|pani profesor Nowak}}) is considered more polite or, in some context, even submissive. Addressing a present person with the last name is only usual in court or in other affairs, where government authority is involved, and generally considered impolite or condescending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://poradnia.pwn.pl/lista.php?id=12364 |title=Szanowny Panie Kowalski! |website=Poradnia językowa PWN |accessdate=1 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When addressing someone, all these forms always require the [[vocative]] case, which is otherwise optional (for example {{lang|pl|panie Kowalski}} ("Mr Kowalski!"), {{lang|pl|pani Joanno}} ("Mrs Joanna!"), {{lang|pl|panie profesorze}} ("Professor!")). For {{lang|pl|pan}}, {{lang|pl|pani}} etc. alone, {{lang|pl|proszę}} + [[genitive]] is used instead of vocative: {{lang|pl|proszę pana}}, {{lang|pl|proszę pani}}, {{lang|pl|proszę panów}}, {{lang|pl|proszę pań}} and {{lang|pl|proszę państwa}}.

A unique practice among both Poles and Western Ukrainians is addressing a lawyer as {{lang|pl|pan Mecenas}}, meaning "Mr. Philanthropist", derived from the name of an ancient Greek king known for his generosity.

The V-forms are capitalized only in actual letters (or e-mails), where the T-forms {{lang|pl|ty}} and {{lang|pl|wy}} are also capitalized.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Plural {{lang|pl|wy}} is also used as V-form in dialects, for example {{lang|pl|Matko, co wy jecie?}} ("Mother, what are you eating?").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Dialekty i gwary polskie|author1=S. Dubisz |author2=H. Karaś |author3=N. Kolis |isbn=83-214-0989-X|chapter=Pluralis maiestaticus|year=1995|location=Warszawa|publisher=Wiedza Powszechna|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following its Russian usage, the plural V-form was also promoted in the Polish language [[Polish People's Republic|from 1945]], becoming associated with Communist ideology and addressing of a person by a government or Party official.

Besides, other forms can be sometimes used like {{lang|pl|pan}} in third person when talking to older family members ({{lang|pl|Niech mama powie}}, "May mother say"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://poradnia.pwn.pl/lista.php?id=4114|title=Jak to w rodzinie…|website=Poradnia językowa PWN|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to clergy ({{lang|pl|Tak, dobrze ksiądz trafił}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.piszmy.pl/agata-podniosla-sie-ze-swojego-fotela/Chapter.html|title=Agata podniosła się ze swojego fotela…|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Yes, priest got it right") or to other people in less formal or semi-formal situations, e.g. polite quarrel or dispute ({{lang|pl|Zatem – proszę kolegi – niech kolega się trochę douczy, a potem poucza innych}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ask.fm/justlikethat3/answer/110875416461 |title=ask.fm/Kuebonafide ---- :* ! |accessdate=1 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140429191953/http://ask.fm/justlikethat3/answer/110875416461 |archivedate=29 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Also, may my dear friend please learn more and only then instruct others").

[[File:Jozef Nahtigal tombstone in Dobrova Slovenia.jpg|thumb|220px|Tombstone of {{lang|sl|[[Jožef Nahtigal]]|italic=no}} in {{lang|sl|[[Dobrova, Dobrova – Polhov Gradec|Dobrova]]|italic=no}} with archaic Slovene {{lang|sl|onikanje}} in indirect reference. Literal translation "Here lie [{{lang|sl|počivajo}}] the honorable {{lang|sl|Jožef Nahtigal|italic=no}} … they were born [{{lang|sl|rojeni}}] … they died [{{lang|sl|umerli}}] … God grant them [{{lang|sl|jim}}] eternal peace and rest."]]
In [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], although informal address using the second person singular {{lang|sl|ti}} form (known as {{lang|sl|tikanje}}) is officially limited to friends and family, talk among children, and addressing animals, it is increasingly used instead of its polite or formal counterpart using the second person plural {{lang|sl|vi}} form (known as {{lang|sl|vikanje}}).

There is an additional nonstandard but widespread use of a singular participle combined with a plural auxiliary verb (known as {{lang|sl|polvikanje}}) that also reveals the gender of the person and is used in somewhat less formal situations:

* {{lang|sl|Vi ga niste videli.}} ('You did not see him': both the auxiliary verb {{lang|sl|niste}} and the participle {{lang|sl|videli}} are plural masculine.)
* {{lang|sl|Vi ga niste videl/videla.}} ('You did not see him': the auxiliary verb {{lang|sl|niste}} is plural but the participle {{lang|sl|videl/videla}} is singular masculine/feminine.)

The use of the third person plural {{lang|sl|oni}} form (known as {{lang|sl|onikanje}} in both direct address and indirect reference) as an ultra-polite form is now archaic or dialectal; it is associated with servant-master relationships in older literature, the child-parent relationship in certain conservative rural communities, and in general with relationships with people of highest respect (parents, clergy, royalty).

==== Czech ====
{{refimprove section|date=July 2011}}
{{See also|Czech verb}}
In [[Czech language|Czech]], there are three levels of formality. The most formal is using the second person plural verb forms (V form) with the surname or title of the addressed person, usual between strangers or people in a professional relationship. The second common form is made by using the second person singular verb forms (T form) together with the given name of the other person, used between friends and in certain social groups (students etc.). The third form, which is rather less common, is using the V form in combination with the given name. It may be used by a teacher when addressing a student (especially at the secondary school level), by a boss addressing their secretary, or in other relationships where a certain degree of familiarity has developed, but has not superseded some level of mutually acknowledged respect or distance. This form of address is usually asymmetrical (the perceived social superior uses V form in combination with the first name, the perceived social inferior using V form and the surname or honorific), less often symmetrical. Using the singular verb forms together with the surname or title is considered very rude. Where a stranger introduces themself with title (like {{lang|cs|inženýr Novák}}, {{lang|cs|doktor Svoboda}}), it is considered more polite to address them using the V form in combination with their title (always preceded by the honorific {{lang|cs|paní}}/{{lang|cs|pane}}, i.e. Mr/Ms), rather than their surname. However, it is considered poor manners to address somebody with their title in combination with the T form.

Traditionally, use of the informal form was limited for relatives, very close friends, and for children. During the second half of the 20th century, use of the informal form grew significantly among coworkers, youth and members of organisations and groups. The formal form is always used in official documents and when dealing with a stranger (especially an older one) as a sign of respect. 2nd-person pronouns ({{lang|cs|Ty}}, {{lang|cs|Tvůj}}, {{lang|cs|Vy}}, {{lang|cs|Váš}}) are often capitalized in letters, advertisement, etc. The capitalization is optional and is slowly becoming obsolete. A variant of the formal form modeled after German {{lang|de|Sie}} ({{lang|cs|Oni}}/{{lang|cs|oni}}, {{lang|cs|Jejich}}/{{lang|cs|jejich}}, verb {{lang|cs|onikat}}) was frequently used during the 19th century but has since disappeared. This form is also associated with Czech [[Jew]]ish community before [[Second World War]], and still appears very often in [[Jewish humour]] as sign of local colour. Sometimes it is used as [[irony]].

In the Internet age, where people communicate under nicknames or pseudonymes and almost solely in informal way, capitalizing ({{lang|cs|ty}}/{{lang|cs|Ty}}) is used to emphasise respect, or simply presence of respect. ({{lang|cs|Ty}} = friends, honored acquaintance, strangers {{lang|cs|ty}} = basic form, {{lang|cs|vy}}/{{lang|cs|Vy}} = most formal, used to create distance or express contempt, very rude if not sufficiently advocated, often used as insult itself). {{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In grammar, plural forms are used in personal and possessive [[pronoun]]s ({{lang|cs|vy}} – you, {{lang|cs|váš}} – your) and in verbs, but not in [[participle]]s and [[adjective]]s, they are used in singular forms (when addressing a single person). This differs from some other [[Slavic languages]] ([[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Russian language|Russian]], etc.)

==== Lithuanian ====
In [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], historically, aside from familiar {{lang|lt|tu}} and respectful {{lang|lt|jūs}} or {{lang|lt|Jūs}}, also used to express plural, there was a special form {{lang|lt|tamsta}}, mostly referred to in third person singular (although referring in second person singular is also not uncommon). This form was used to communicate with a stranger who has not earned particular respect (a beggar, for example). Modern Lithuanian Dictionary describes {{lang|lt|tamsta}} as a polite form of second singular person {{lang|lt|tu}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dz.lki.lt/get/87718/ |title=Dabartinės lietuvių kalbos žodynas |work=lki.lt }}&lt;/ref&gt; making its meaning somewhere in the middle between informal {{lang|lt|tu}} and formal {{lang|lt|jūs}}. Through the Soviet occupation period, however, this form was mostly replaced by standard neutral form {{lang|lt|drauge}} (the [[vocative case]] for {{lang|lt|draugas}}, "[[comrade]]", the latter being the standard formal form of addressing in all languages of the [[Soviet Union]] used in all situations, from "comrade [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]" to "comrade student"), and by now {{lang|lt|tamsta}} is used sparsely. A common way of addressing people whom one doesn't know well is also {{lang|lt|Ponas}} (m) and {{lang|lt|Ponia}} (f), from Polish forms of address {{wikt-lang|pl|pan}} and {{wikt-lang|pl|pani}}, respectively.

=== Indic ===
==== Hindi and Urdu ====
In the standard forms of both [[Standard Hindi|Hindi]] and [[Standard Urdu|Urdu]] there are three levels of honorifics:
* '''{{lang|hi|आप}} {{lang|ur|آپ}}''' {{lang|hi-Latn|āp}} {{IPA|[aːp]}}: The formal V-form used to address another person. Used with third-person verbs or separate honorific verb forms in all formal settings and when speaking to persons who are senior in age or social hierarchy. No difference between the singular and the plural; plural reference can, however, be indicated by the use of "you people" ({{lang|hi|आप लोग}} {{lang|ur|آپ لوگ}} {{lang|hi-Latn|āp log}}) or "you all" ({{lang|hi|आप सब}} {{lang|ur|آپ سب}} {{lang|hi-Latn|āp sab}}). It is sometimes combined with a second-person verb when speaking to persons lower in social hierarchy or, generally, to reduce distance while avoiding the informal flavour of {{lang|hi-Latn|tum}}.
* '''{{lang|hi|तुम}} {{lang|ur|تُم}}''' {{lang|hi-Latn|tum}} {{IPA|[tʊm]}}: Originally, a plural pronoun ("you"), it is nowadays used as singular V-form in all informal settings and when speaking to persons who are junior in age or social hierarchy. No difference between the singular and the plural; plural reference can, however, be indicated by the use of "you people" ({{lang|hi|तुम लोग}} {{lang|ur|تُم لوگ}} {{lang|hi-Latn|tum log}}) or "you all" ({{lang|hi|तुम सब}} {{lang|ur|تُم سب}} {{lang|hi-Latn|tum sab}}).
* '''{{lang|hi|तू}} {{lang|ur|تُو}}''' {{lang|hi-Latn|tū}} {{IPA|[tuː]}}: Originally, a singular pronoun ("thou"), it is nowadays used exclusively as a T-form, in extremely informal settings: to address own children, very close friends, or in poetic language (either with God or with lovers). When used to others (e.g., strangers), it is considered offensive both in Pakistan and India.

==== Bengali ====
[[Bengali language|Bengali]] has three levels of formality in its pronouns; the most neutral forms of address among closer members of a family are {{lang|bn|তুমি}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tumi}} and {{lang|bn|তোমরা}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tomra}} (plural). These two pronouns are also typically used when speaking to children, or to younger members of the extended family. {{lang|bn|তুমি}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tumi}} is also used when addressing God. When speaking with adults outside the family, or with senior members of the extended family, the pronouns {{lang|bn|আপনি}} {{lang|bn-Latn|apni}} and {{lang|bn|আপনারা}} {{lang|bn-Latn|apnara}} (plural) are used. This is also true in advertisements and public announcements. A third set of pronouns, {{lang|bn|তুই}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tui}} and {{lang|bn|তোরা}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tora}} (plural), is reserved for use between very close friends, and by extension, between relatives who share a bond not unlike a close friendship. It is also used when addressing people presumed to be of "inferior" social status; this latter use is occasionally used when speaking to housemaids, [[rickshaw]]-pullers, and other service workers, although this use is considered offensive.

The situations in which these different pronouns can be used vary considerably depending on many social factors. In some families, children may address their parents with {{lang|bn|আপনি}} {{lang|bn-Latn|apni}} and {{lang|bn|আপনারা}} {{lang|bn-Latn|apnara}}, although this is becoming increasingly rare. Some adults alternate between all three pronoun levels when speaking to children, normally choosing {{lang|bn|তুমি}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tumi}} and {{lang|bn|তোমরা}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tomra}}, but also often choosing {{lang|bn|তুই}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tui}} and {{lang|bn|তোরা}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tora}} to indicate closeness, or {{lang|bn|আপনি}} {{lang|bn-Latn|apni}} or {{lang|bn|আপনারা}} {{lang|bn-Latn|apnara}} in a joking manner. Additionally, Bengalis vary in which pronoun they use when addressing servants in the home; some may use {{lang|bn|আপনি}} {{lang|bn-Latn|apni}} and {{lang|bn|আপনারা}} {{lang|bn-Latn|apnara}} to indicate respect for an adult outside the family, while others may use {{lang|bn|তুমি}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tumi}} and {{lang|bn|তোমরা}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tomra}} to indicate either inclusion into the family or to indicate somewhat less honorable status. Others may even use {{lang|bn|তুই}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tui}} and {{lang|bn|তোরা}} {{lang|bn-Latn|tora}} to indicate inferior status.

=== Finno-Ugric ===

==== Finnish ====
In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], today the use of the informal singular form of address ({{lang|fi|sinä}}) is widespread in all social circles, even among strangers and in business situations. The use of formal address has not disappeared however, and persists in situations involving customer service (especially if the customer is clearly older than the person serving them) and in general in addressing the elderly or in situations where strict adherence to form is expected, such as in the military. An increase in the use of formal address has been reported in recent years, whereby some people are choosing to use the formal form more often.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. As the use of the form conveys formal recognition of the addressee's status and, more correctly, of polite social distance, the formal form might also occasionally be used jeeringly or to protest the addressee's snobbery. A native speaker may also switch to formal form when speaking in anger, as an attempt to remain civil. Advertisements, instructions and other formal messages are mostly in informal singular form ({{lang|fi|sinä}} and its conjugations), but the use of formal forms has increased in recent years. For example, as the tax authorities tend to become more informal, in contrast the social security system is reverting to using the formal form.

The same forms, such as the pronoun {{lang|fi|te}}, are used for formal singular and for both formal and informal plural.

In Finnish the number is expressed in pronouns ({{lang|fi|sinä}} for second person singular, or {{lang|fi|te}} for second person plural), verb inflections, and [[possessive suffix]]es. Almost all of these elements follow the grammar of the second person plural also in the formal singular form. For example, polite {{lang|fi|Voisitteko (te) siirtää autonne}} vs. informal {{lang|fi|Voisitko (sinä) siirtää autosi}}, "Could you move your car, (please)?". Each of the person markers are modified: {{lang|fi|-t-}} to {{lang|fi|-tte-}} (verb person), {{lang|fi|sinä}} to {{lang|fi|te}} (pronoun), {{lang|fi|-si}} to {{lang|fi|-nne}} (possessive suffix).

As a few examples of this could be mentioned the way [[imperative mood|imperatives]] are expressed: {{lang|fi|Menkää!}} "Go!" (plural), vs. {{lang|fi|Mene!}} "Go!" (singular), and the usage of the plural suffix {{lang|fi|-nne}} "your" instead of the singular {{lang|fi|-si}} "your".

There is number agreement in Finnish, thus you say {{lang|fi|sinä olet}} "you are" (singular), but {{lang|fi|te olette}} "you are" (plural). However, this does not extend to words describing the addressee, which are in the singular, e.g. {{lang|fi|oletteko te lääkäri?}} "are you doctor?" (plural, plural, singular)

A common error, nowadays often made even by native speakers unused to the formal forms, is to use the plural form of the main verb in the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] and [[pluperfect]] constructions. The main verb should be in the singular when addressing one person in the formal plural: {{lang|fi|Oletteko kuullut?}} instead of {{lang|fi|*Oletteko kuulleet?}} "Have you heard?"

Sometimes the third person is used as a polite form of address, after the [[T–V distinction#Swedish|Swedish model]]: {{lang|fi|Mitä rouvalle saisi olla?}} "What would madam like to have?" This is far less common in the Eastern parts of Finland, influenced less by the Swedish language and all in all a declining habit. The [[passive voice]] may be used to circumvent the choice of the correct form of address. In another meaning, the passive voice is also the equivalent of the English patronizing ''we'' as in {{lang|fi|Kuinkas tänään voidaan?}} "How are we feeling today?"

Finnish language includes the verbs for calling one with informal singular or formal plural: {{lang|fi|sinutella}}, {{lang|fi|teititellä}}, respectively.

In the Bible and in the [[Kalevala]], only the "informal" singular is used in all cases.

==== Estonian ====
[[Estonian language|Estonian]] is a language with T–V distinction, second person plural ({{lang|et|teie}}) is used instead of second person singular ({{lang|et|sina}}) as a means of expressing politeness or formal speech. {{lang|et|Sina}} is the familiar form of address used with family, friends, and minors. The distinction is still much more widely used and more rigid than in closely related Finnish language.

Similar to the French language {{lang|fr|vouvoyer}}, the verb {{lang|et|teietama}} is used, and {{lang|et|teie}} is used when addressing a (new) customer or a patient, or when talking to a person in his/her function. In [[hierarchical organization]]s, like large businesses or armies, {{lang|et|sina}} is used between members of a same rank/level while {{lang|et|teie}} is used between members of different ranks. {{lang|et|Sina}} (the verb {{lang|et|sinatama}} is also used) is used with relatives, friends, when addressing children and with close colleagues. Borderline situations, such as distant relatives, young adults, customers in rental shops or new colleagues, sometimes still present difficulties.

==== Hungarian ====
[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] provides numerous, often subtle means of T–V distinction:

The use of the second-person conjugation with the pronoun {{lang|hu|te}} (plural {{lang|hu|ti}}) is the most informal mode. As in many other European languages, it is used within families, among children, lovers, close friends, (nowadays often) among coworkers, and in some communities, suggesting an idea of brotherhood. Adults unilaterally address children this way, and it is the form used in addressing God and other Christian figures (such as Jesus Christ or the Blessed Virgin), animals, and objects or ideas. Sociologically, the use of this form is widening. Whereas traditionally the switch to {{lang|hu|te}} is often a symbolic milestone between people, sometimes sealed by drinking a glass of wine together ({{lang|hu|pertu}}), today people under the age of about thirty will often mutually adopt {{lang|hu|te}} automatically in informal situations. A notable example is the Internet: strangers meeting online use the informal forms of address virtually exclusively, regardless of age or status differences. &lt;!-- even [[Ferenc Gyurcsány]] as a Prime Minister in office encouraged&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110721110805/http://kapcsolat.hu/blog/februar_2-a_van._klaranak_a_felesegemnek_ma_van_a_szuletesnapja. Február 2-a van. Klárának, a feleségemnek ma van a születésnapja. (2006.02.02. 18:40)]. "Hadd kezdjem talán azzal, hogy számomra eléggé természetes, hogy tegeződünk, szerintem ennek semmi köze a miniszterelnök tekintélyéhez. Ne feszélyezzen benneteket, mert ha bárki is úgy érzi, akkor előbb-utóbb engem is feszélyezni fog, hogy én tegeződöm." ("Let me begin with mentioning that it's quite natural for me to use the informal way of addressing; I don't think it has anything to do with the Prime Minister's prestige. Don't let yourselves be embarrassed, because if anyone feels like that then sooner or later I'll also be embarrassed to do so.")&lt;/ref&gt; people in his [[blog]] to use ''te'' mutually when asking him. [[IKEA]] (or rather, its Hungarian team) was noted and practically unique in its choice of this way of addressing people in Hungary in its brochures; reactions were mixed. --&gt;

Nevertheless, formal forms of address are alive and well in Hungarian:
* The third-person verb conjugation is the primary basis of formal address. The choice of which ''pronoun'' to use, however, is fraught with difficulty (and indeed a common solution when in doubt is to simply avoid using any pronoun at all, using the addressee's name or title instead). &lt;!-- this is not restricted to the nominative. Consider things you might say to someone who just arrived in your city: ''Isten hozta'' [önt]; ''Milyen volt az útja?'' [önnek]; ''Remélem, tetszik a városunk'' [önnek]; (a taxiban) ''Hova vihetem?'' [önt]; etc.etc.etc. … --&gt;
** The pronoun {{lang|hu|maga}} (plural {{lang|hu|maguk}}), for instance, is considered the basic formal equivalent of "you", but may not be used indiscriminately, as it tends to imply an existing or desired personal acquaintance. (It would not, for instance, ordinarily be used in a conversation where the relative social roles are predominantly important – say, between professor and student.) Typical situations where {{lang|hu|maga}} might be used are, e.g., distant relatives, neighbours, fellow travellers on the train, or at the hairdresser's. If one already knows these people, they may even take offence if one were to address them more formally. On the other hand, some urbanites tend to avoid {{lang|hu|maga}}, finding it too rural, old-fashioned, offensive or even intimate. – Note that {{lang|hu|maga}} coincides with the [[reflexive pronoun]] (cf. him/herself), so e.g. the sentence {{lang|hu|Megütötte magát?}} can have three meanings: "Did he hit himself?", "Did he hit you?" or "Did you hit yourself?".
** {{lang|hu|Ön}} (plural {{lang|hu|önök}}) is the formal, official and impersonal "you". It is the form used when people take part in a situation merely as representatives of [[role|social roles]], where personal acquaintance is not a factor. It is thus used in institutions, business, bureaucracy, advertisements, by broadcasters, by shopkeepers to their customers, and whenever one wishes to maintain one's distance. It is less typical of rural areas or small towns, more typical of cities. It's often capitalized in letters.
** Other pronouns are nowadays rare, restricted to rural, jocular, dialect, or old-fashioned speech. Such are, for instance, {{lang|hu|kend}} and {{lang|hu|kegyed}}.
** There is a wide spectrum of third-person address that avoids the above pronouns entirely; preferring to substitute various combinations of the addressee's names and/or titles. Thus, for instance, a university student might ask {{lang|hu|mit gondol X. tanár úr?}} ("What does Professor X. think?", meant for the addressee) rather than using the insufficiently formal {{lang|hu|maga}} or the overly impersonal {{lang|hu|ön}}. If the difference in rank is not to be emphasized, it is perfectly acceptable to use the addressed person's first name instead of a second-person pronoun, e.g. {{lang|hu|Megkérném arra Pétert, hogy...}} ("I'd like to ask [you,] Peter to…"). (Note that these are possible because the formal second-person conjugation of verbs is the same as the third-person conjugation.)
* Finally, the [[auxiliary verb]] {{lang|hu|tetszik}} (lit. "it pleases [you]") is an indirect alternative (or, perhaps, supplement) to direct address with the third or even second person. In terms of grammar, it can only be applied if the addressed person is mentioned in the [[nominative]], otherwise it is replaced by forms with the name or {{lang|hu|maga}}. It is very polite (sometimes seen as over-polite) and not as formal as the {{lang|hu|Ön}} form. Children usually address adults outside their family this way. Adults may address more distant relatives, [[housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeepers]] and older persons using this form, and some men habitually address older or younger women this way (this is slightly old-fashioned).
&lt;!-- Please make it possible for the reader to comprehend the content and its key points by not making it longer than it already is --&gt;

It is important to keep in mind that formal conjugation doesn't automatically imply politeness or vice versa; these factors are independent of each other. For example, {{lang|hu|Mit parancsolsz?}} "What would you like to have?" (literally, "What do you command?") is in the informal conjugation, while it can be extremely polite, making it possible to express one's honour towards people one has previously established a friendly relationship with. On the other hand, {{lang|hu|Mit akar?}} "What do you want?" is expressed with the formal conjugation, nevertheless it may sound rude and aggressive; the formal conjugation does not soften this tone in any way.

In modern [[Turkish language|Turkish]], the T–V distinction is strong. Family members and friends speak to one another using the second-person singular {{lang|tr|sen}}, and adults use {{lang|tr|sen}} to address minors. In formal situations (business, customer–clerk, and colleague relationships, or meeting people for the first time) the plural second-person {{lang|tr|siz}} is used almost exclusively. In very formal situations, the double plural second-person {{lang|tr|sizler}} may be used to address a much-respected person. Rarely, the third-person plural form of the verb (but not the pronoun) may be used to emphasize utmost respect. Additionally, if there are two or more person {{lang|tr|siz}} or {{lang|tr|sizler}} could be used. For example, {{lang|tr|Siz seçildiniz}} or {{lang|tr|Sizler seçildiniz}} have same meaning that "You have been chosen". However, {{lang|tr|Siz seçildiniz}} are not certain whether plural or singular. It changes; formal speaking {{lang|tr|siz}} specifies one person or more but informal speaking it specifies only two or more person. In the imperative, there are four forms: second person singular for informal, second person plural for formal, and second person double plural for very formal situations: {{lang|tr|gel}} (second person singular, informal), {{lang|tr|gelin}} (second person plural, formal), and {{lang|tr|geliniz}} (double second person plural, very formal). The very formal forms are not frequently used in spoken Turkish, but is pretty common in written directives, such as manuals and warning signs.

==== Uyghur ====
[[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] is notable for using four different forms, to distinguish both singular and plural in both formal and informal registers. The informal plural {{lang|ug-Latn|silär}} originated as a contraction of {{lang|ug-Latn|sizlär}}, which uses a regular plural ending. In [[Old Turkic]], as still in modern Turkish, {{lang|otk|𐰾𐰃𐰕}} ({{lang|otk-Latn|siz}}) was the original second-person plural. However, in modern Uyghur {{lang|ug|سئز}} ({{lang|ug-Latn|siz}}) has become restricted to the formal singular, requiring the plural suffix {{lang|ug-Latn|-lär}} for the plurals.

{{lang|ug-Latn|Siz}} as the formal singular pronoun is characteristic of the [[Ürümqi]] dialect, which is the Uyghur literary standard. In [[Turpan]] they say {{lang|ug|سئلئ}} ({{lang|ug-Latn|sili}}) and in [[Kashgar]] dialect, {{lang|ug-Latn|özlär}}. {{lang|ug-Latn|Sili}} is also used in other areas sometimes, while in literary Uyghur {{lang|ug-Latn|özlär}} as a singular pronoun is considered a "hyperdeferential" level of respect; the deferential plural form is {{lang|ug-Latn|härqaysiliri}}.

=== Northwest Caucasian ===

==== Ubykh ====
In the extinct [[Ubykh language]], the T–V distinction was most notable between a man and his mother-in-law, where the plural form {{lang|uby|sʸæghʷa}} supplanted the singular {{lang|uby|wæghʷa}} very frequently, possibly under the influence of [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. The distinction was upheld less frequently in other relationships, but did still occur.

=== Semitic ===

==== Arabic ====
[[Modern Standard Arabic]] uses the [[majestic plural]] form of the [[grammatical person|second person]] ({{lang|ar|أنتم}} {{lang|ar-Latn|antum}}) in respectful address.{{cn|date=February 2017}} It is restricted to highly formal contexts, generally relating to politics and government. However, several [[varieties of Arabic]] have a clearer T–V distinction. The most developed is in [[Egyptian Arabic]], which uses {{lang|arz|حضرتك}} {{lang|arz-Latn|ḥaḍritak}} (literally, "Your [[Grace (style)|Grace]]"), {{lang|arz|سعادتك}} {{lang|arz-Latn|sa‘adtak}} and {{lang|arz|سيادتك}} {{lang|arz-Latn|siyadtak}} (literally, "Your Lordship") as the "V" terms, depending on context, while {{lang|arz|أنت}} {{lang|arz-Latn|inta}} is the "T" term. {{lang|arz-Latn|Ḥaḍritak}} is the most usual "V" term, with {{lang|arz-Latn|sa‘adtak}} and {{lang|arz-Latn|siyadtak}} being reserved for situations where the addressee is of very high social standing (e.g. a high-ranking government official or a powerful businessman). Finally, the "V" term is used only with social superiors (including elders); unfamiliar people perceived to be of similar or lower social standing to the speaker are addressed with the ''T'' term {{lang|arz-Latn|inta}}.

==== Hebrew ====
In modern [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], there is a T–V distinction used in a set of very formal occasions, for example, a lawyer addressing a judge, or when speaking to rabbis. The second person singular {{lang|he|אַתָּה}} ({{lang|he-Latn|ʔaˈta}}, masculine) or {{lang|he|אַתְּ}} ({{lang|he-Latn|ʔat}}, feminine) are the usual form of address in all other situations, e.g. when addressing ministers or members of the [[Knesset]].

The formal form of address when speaking to a person of higher authority is the third person singular using the person's title without the use of the pronoun. Thus, a rabbi could be asked: {{lang|he|?כְּבוֹד הָרַב יִרְצֶה לֶאֱכֹל}} ({{lang|he-Latn|kəˈvod haˈʁav yiʁˈtse leʔeˈχol'}}, "would the honorable rabbi like to eat?") or a judge told: {{lang|he|כְּבוֹדוֹ דָּן בְּבַקָּשָׁתִי}} ({{lang|he-Latn|kəvoˈdo dan bəvakaʃaˈti}}, "his honour is considering my request").

Other persons of authority are normally addressed by their title only, rather than by name, using the second person singular. For example, officers and commanders in the army are addressed as {{lang|he|הַמְּפַקֵּד}} ({{lang|he-Latn|haməfaˈked}}, "the commander") by troops.

In non-Hebrew-speaking Jewish culture, the second-person form of address is similarly avoided in cases of higher authority (e.g., a student in a [[yeshiva]] would be far more likely to say in a classroom discussion "yesterday the Rav told us..." than "yesterday you told us..."). However, this usage is limited to more conservative (i.e. Orthodox) circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|he|אורי אורבך, סבא שלי היה רב, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dravidian===

==== Tamil ====
In [[Tamil language|Tamil]], the second-person singular pronoun நீ {{IPA|[niː]}} and its derived forms are used to address children, (younger or very close) members of the family and to people who are younger than the speaker. The second person plural pronoun நீங்கள் {{IPA|[niːŋgʌɭ]}} is used to address elders (also within the extended family), teachers, people who are older than the speaker and anyone whom the speaker does not personally know, especially in formal situations.

=== Sino-Tibetan ===

==== Chinese ====
{{anchor|Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin|Shanghainese|Cantonese|Minnan}}
{{See also|Chinese honorifics|Chinese naming taboo}}
[[Chinese culture]] has taken [[Chinese names|naming]] and [[Chinese honorifics|forms of address]] very seriously, strictly regulating which people were permitted to use which terms in conversation or in writing. The extreme example is the 1777 execution of [[Wang Xihou]] and [[nine exterminations|his entire family]] and the confiscation of their entire estate as his penalty for writing the [[Qianlong Emperor]]'s personal name as part of a criticism of the [[Kangxi Dictionary]]. Many honorifics and niceties of address fell by the wayside during the [[Cultural Revolution]] of the late 1960s amid [[Mao Zedong]]'s campaign against the "[[Four Olds]]". This included an attempt to eradicate expressions of deference to teachers and to others seen as preserving "counter-revolutionary" modes of thought. The defeat of the Maoist [[Gang of Four]] in the late 1970s and continuing [[Chinese economic reform|reforms]] since the 1980s has, however, permitted a return of such traditional and regional expressions.

Historically, the T–V distinction was observed among the Chinese by avoiding ''any'' use of common pronouns in addressing a respected audience. Instead, third-person [[Chinese honorifics#Addressing or referring to others|honorifics]] and respectful titles were employed. One aspect of such respectful address was avoiding the use of the ''first''-person pronoun as well, instead choosing a (typically humble) [[Chinese honorifics#Referring to oneself|epithet]] in its place. The extreme of this practice occurred when [[Shi Huangdi]] abrogated the then-current first-person pronoun {{lang|zh|朕}} (''zhèn''); the present first-person pronoun {{lang|zh|我}} (''wǒ'') subsequently developed out of the habit of referring to "this [worthless] body", the character's original meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Zdic.net. {{lang|zh|《漢典》}} [''Chinese Dictionary'']. "[http://www.zdic.net/z/1a/js/6211.htm　{{lang|zh|我}}]". Accessed 21 August 2013. {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important difference between the T–V distinction in Chinese compared with modern European languages is that Chinese culture considers the relative age of the speakers an important aspect of their [[social distance]]. This is especially strong within families: while the speakers of European languages may generally prefer forms of address such as "father" or "grandpa", Chinese speakers consider using the personal names of elders such a [[Chinese naming taboo|taboo]] that they may not even ''know'' the given names of grandparents who live in the same apartment. While strictures against writing the personal name of any ancestor of the last seven generations are no longer observed, it remains very uncommon to [[Chinese names|name children]] for any living relative: younger people using the name freely would disrespect the original bearer.

In the present day, the informal second-person pronoun is {{lang|zh|{{linktext|你}}}} ([[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]: ''nǐ''; [[Minnan language|Minnan]]: ''lí'') and the honorific pronoun is {{lang|zh|{{linktext|您}}}} (Mandarin: ''nín''; Minnan: ''lín''). Much like European languages, the honorific form developed out of an earlier second-person plural: during the [[Jurchen Dynasty|Jin]] and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] [[list of Chinese dynasties|dynasties]], the Mandarin dialects mutated {{lang|zh|{{linktext|你每}}}} (''nǐměi'') into {{lang|zh|{{linktext|你們}}}} (''nǐmen'') and then into {{lang|zh|您}}.&lt;ref&gt;Although modern Chinese now distinguishes between {{lang|zh|你们}} ("you" [plural]) and {{lang|zh|您}} ("you" [cherished, respectful]), the legacy of {{lang|zh|您}}'s origin is still retained in the rarity of observing the form {{lang|zh|{{linktext|您们}}}} in Mandarin Chinese. Native speakers employ indirect phrasing like "everybody"　({{lang|zh|{{linktext|大家}}}}, ''dàjiā'', lit. "big family") or "ladies and gentlemen" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|各位}}}}, ''gèwèi'', lit. "every seat") and {{lang|zh|您们}} only infrequently appears in [[Taiwanese Mandarin]] and among foreign students of the language.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A similar form {{ndash}} {{lang|zh|{{linktext|怹}}}}, ''tān'' {{ndash}} developed for the third-person singular but is now generally unused.) It is worth noting that the T–V distinction in Mandarin does ''not'' connote a distance or lack of intimacy between the speakers (as implied, e.g., in the French ''vous''). On the contrary, it is often noted that the respectful form contains the [[Chinese radical|radical]] for "heart" ({{lang|zh|心}}, ''xīn''); although this is actually for [[Chinese character#Rebus|phonetic reasons]], the implication is that the addressee is loved and cherished by the speaker.

Most [[Northern and southern China|southern dialects]], however, do not make this distinction in speech at all. [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]] and [[Shanghainese language|Shanghainese]] speakers learn to ''[[written Chinese|write]]'' both forms in school but pronounce them identically: the Cantonese as ''nei''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; and the Shanghainese as ''nóng''. Formality is still respected, but their languages {{ndash}} like [[#Japanese|Japanese]] and [[#Vietnamese|Vietnamese]] {{ndash}} retain the earlier Chinese tradition of employing epithets or honorifics instead of using any pronouns at all when showing formal respect.

=== Japonic ===

==== Japanese ====
{{Main|Japanese pronouns}}
{{See also|Japanese honorifics|Honorific speech in Japanese}}
Under heavy [[#Chinese|Chinese]] influence, traditional [[Japanese culture]] eschewed the use of common pronouns in formal speech; similarly, the Chinese first-person singular {{lang|ja|朕}} ({{lang|ja|ちん}}, ''chin'') was arrogated to the personal use of the [[emperor of Japan|emperor]]. The formality of Japanese culture was such that its [[Japanese pronouns#Archaic personal pronouns|original pronouns]] have largely ceased to be used at all. Some linguists therefore argue that [[Japanese language|Japanese]] lacks ''any'' pronouns whatsoever, but {{ndash}} although it is a larger and more complex group of words than most languages employ {{ndash}} [[Japanese pronouns]] do exist, having developed out of the most common epithets used to express different relationships and relative degrees of social status. As in [[#Korean|Korean]], polite language encompasses not only these specific pronouns but also suffixes and vocabulary as well.

Most commonly, {{lang|ja|{{linktext|君}}}} ({{lang|ja|きみ}}, ''kimi'', &lt;small&gt;orig.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"prince", "lord") is used informally as the second-person singular and {{lang|ja|{{linktext|貴方}}}} ({{lang|ja|あなた}}, ''anata'', &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; "dear one") is the most common polite equivalent, but is also commonly used by women towards an intimate as a term of endearment.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} The pronoun {{lang|ja|{{linktext|貴様}}}} ({{lang|ja|きさま}}, ''kisama'') is illustrative of the complexity that can be involved, though, in that its literal meaning is quite flattering {{ndash}} &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; "dear and honorable sir" {{ndash}} but its ironic use has made it a strong insult in modern Japanese. Similarly, {{lang|ja|{{linktext|御前}}}} ({{lang|ja|おまえ}}, ''omae'') {{ndash}} &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; "(one who is) before (me)" {{ndash}} was traditionally a respectful pronoun used toward aristocrats and religious figureheads, but today is considered very informal and impolite, yet also commonly used by husbands towards their wives in an endearing manner.

=== Austro-Asiatic ===

==== Vietnamese ====
{{Main|Vietnamese pronouns}}
Under heavy [[#Chinese|Chinese]] influence, [[Vietnamese culture]] has eschewed the use of [[Vietnamese pronouns#true pronouns|common pronouns]] in formal speech; similarly, the Chinese first-person singular {{lang|zh|朕}} (Vietnamese:&amp;nbsp;''trẫm'') was arrogated to the personal use of the [[emperor of Vietnam|emperor]].

In modern Vietnamese, only the first-person singular ''tôi'' is in common use as a respectful pronoun; any other pronoun should be replaced with the subject's name or with an appropriate epithet, title, or relationship in polite formal speech. Similar to modern Chinese (but to a much greater extent), modern Vietnamese also frequently replaces ''informal'' pronouns with [[Vietnamese pronouns#Kinship terms|kinship terms]] in many situations. The somewhat insulting second-person singular ''mày'' is also frequently used in informal situations among young Vietnamese.

=== Tai–Kadai languages ===

==== Thai ====
In [[Thai language|Thai]], first, second, and third person pronouns vary in formality according to the social standing of the speaker and the referent and the relationship between them. For a non-exhaustive list of Thai second person pronouns, see http://www.into-asia.com/thai_language/grammar/you.php.

=== Austronesian ===

==== Indonesian ====
In [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], the T–V distinction is extremely important; addressing a stranger with the pronoun ''kau'' or ''kamu'' (you) is considered rude and impolite (unless the stranger is, for example, a child). When addressing a stranger or someone older, typically ''Bu'' ('ma'am') or ''Pak'' ('sir') is used. People also use ''mas'' (Javanese for 'older brother') or ''mbak'' (Javanese for 'older sister') when addressing someone that is not old enough to be called ''Bu'' or ''Pak''. There are variations in different areas. If the situation is more formal, such as in meetings or news broadcasting, ''Anda'' is always used, even if those addressed would otherwise be addressed by ''kau'' or ''kamu'' in informal situations. A more informal pronoun, written ''lu'', ''lo'', or sometimes as ''loe'' (originated from Hokkien language) is considered very impolite. This is normally used by teenagers (particularly in urban centers) to their peers. Adults can sometimes be heard using this pronoun with their close friends or when they are angry.

# ''Lu siap?'' ('Are you ready?'): This form is used between friends in very informal situations without the presence of someone who has higher status.
# ''Kamu siap?'' ('Are you ready?'): This form is used between friends in either informal or formal situations without the presence of someone who has higher status.
# ''Anda siap?'' ('Are you ready?'): This form is used between friends in formal situations, between business partners, or with someone who has higher status.
# ''Apakah Anda siap?'' (Are you ready?): This form is used between friends in very formal situations, among strangers, or toward someone who has higher status. Note that ''Apakah'' is an optional question word that is used in close-ended questions (similar to the use of 'to be' and other auxiliary verbs to form close-ended questions in English). This is a form of ''Bahasa Baku''.

Similarly, ''kalian'' dan ''Anda''/''Anda sekalian'' are used.

==== Tagalog ====
In [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], the familiar second person is ''ikáw/ka'' (in the nominative case). This is replaced by ''kayó'' (which is actually the second person plural) when the situation calls for a more polite tone. The pronoun ''kayó'' is accompanied by the particle ''pô''. This form is generally used to show respect to close, older relatives. This is also the form expected when talking with the peers of parents or grandparents.

Traditionally, when a higher degree of formality is required, the third person plural (''silá'') is used instead. It is used when addressing people of higher social rank, such as government officials and senior clergymen. It may also be used when speaking to complete strangers as a matter of courtesy, such as when answering the door or an unknown caller.

# Sino ka? (Who are you?) [Used to ask for the identity of a peer or one of equal social rank, such as a student to a fellow student. Depending on intonation, this question may sound impolite.]
# Sino pô kayó? (Who are you?) [This form implies that the speaker believes the person addressed is a relative or an individual of a higher rank, and is thus used to confirm the relationship.]
# Sino pô silá? (Who are you, Sir/Ma'am?) [Though ''''pô'''' does not really translate as ''''Sir'''' or ''''Ma'am'''', this form implies that the person being addressed is a complete stranger and the speaker has no idea who they are.]

Younger Filipinos tend to mix these forms of address, resulting in questions such as ''Sino ka pô ba?'' in an attempt to sound polite towards a total stranger. This and other nonstandard variants are very widespread, especially in the [[Metro Manila|Manila]] dialect of Tagalog and its [[Greater Manila Area|surrounding suburbs]].

=== Other languages ===

==== Basque ====
{{See also|Basque grammar#Personal pronouns|l1=Basque grammar: Personal pronouns}}
[[Basque language|Basque]] has two levels of formality in every dialect, which are '''hi''' and '''zu'''; Nevertheless, in some areas of Gipuzkoa and Biscay, the respectful form '''berori''' is still used by some speakers, just as the familiar '''xu''' in some areas of the Eastern Low Navarrese dialect, when addressing children and close friends. Most speakers only use the ''zu'' form (''zuka'' level) and that is the usual one used in methods, slogans... although the ''hi'' form (''hika'') is very common in villages.

The neutral or formal one is ''zu'', which originally used to be the plural form of the second person. The informal one is ''hi'', whose use is limited to some specific situations: among close friends, to children (children never use it when addressing their parents, neither the spouses among them), when talking to a younger person, to animals (cattle, pets...), in monologues, and when speaking angrily to somebody. Their common plural form is ''zuek'', whenever the speaker is talking to a group of listeners who would all be individually addressed with the form ''zu'', or the form ''hi'', or both (a conversation where some listeners are addressed as ''zu'' —i.e., somebody's parents, for instance— and others as ''hi'' —the speaker's siblings—).

Unlike ''zu'', ''hi'' sometimes makes a distinction whether the addressed one is a male or a female. For example: ''duk'' (thou, male, hast) and ''dun'' (thou, female, hast). The use of the '''hika''' level requires the allocutive agreement (''hitano'' or ''zeharkako hika'', i.e., indirect ''hika'') in non-subordinate sentences to mark this distinction for the first and third person verbs. Those allocutive forms are found in the Indicative and Conditional moods, but never in the Subjunctive and Imperative moods, with the one exception of ''goazemak'' (let's go, said to a male) and ''goazeman'' (said to a female) in Western dialects, opposed to ''goazen'', the neutral form. For example:

* ''du'' (neutral, s/he has, neutral form), ''dik'' (s/he has, male thou) and ''din'' (s/he has, female thou), as in ''aitak ikasi du'' (polite: Dad has learned it), ''aitak ikasi dik'' (informal, said to a male), and ''aitak ikasi din'' (informal, said to a female).
* ''dio'' (neutral, s/he has it for him / her), ''ziok'' (familiar, s/he has it for him / her, said to a male), and ''zion'' (familiar, s/he has it for him / her, said to a female), as in ''aitak erosi dio'' (polite: Dad has bought it for him / her), ''aitak erosi ziok'' (informal, said to a male), and ''aitak erosi zion'' (informal, said to a female).
* ''nintzen'' (neutral, I was), ''ninduan'' (familiar, said to a male), and ''nindunan'' (familiar, said to a female), as in ''hona etorri nintzen'' (polite: I came here), ''hona etorri ninduan'' (informal, said to a male), and ''hona etorri nindunan'' (informal, said to a female).

Nevertheless, if any of the allocutive sentences becomes subordinate, the formal one is used: ''aitak ikasi duelako'' (because Dad has learned it), ''aitak erosi diolako'' (because Dad bought it for him / her), and ''hona etorri nintzenean'' (when I came here).

On the other hand, in past tense verbal forms, no distinction is made when the addressee is the subject or the direct object in the sentence. For example:

* ''hintzen'', in ''etxera joan hintzen'' (thou wentst home),
* ''huen'', in ''filma ikusi huen'' (thou sawst the film),
* ''hindugun'', in ''ikusi hindugun'' (we saw thee).

But if the familiar second-person appears in the verb, or if the verb is an allocutive form in a non-dependent clause, the masculine and feminine forms differ. For example:

* ''genian / geninan'' (we had something for thee, male / female): ''hiri eman genian, Piarres'' (we gave it to thee, Peter), and ''hiri eman geninan, Maddi'' (we gave it to thee, Mary).
* ''geniean / genienan'' (male allocutive / female allocutive, we had something for them): ''haiei eman geniean, Piarres'' (we gave it to them, Peter), and ''haiei eman genienan, Maddi'' (we gave it to them, Mary). Their corresponding neutral form is ''haiei eman genien''.
* ''banekian erantzuna'' (I knew the answer, said to a male), and ''banekinan erantzuna'' (I knew the answer, said to a female). Their corresponding neutral form is ''banekien erantzuna''.

The friendly ''xu'' form or '''xuketa''' resembles the ''zuka'' forms of the verbs, and includes another kind of allocutive, as ''hika'': cf. ''egia erran dut'' (formal: I told the truth), ''egia erran diat'' (informal, said to a male), ''egia erran dinat'' (informal, said to a female), ''egia erran dautzut'' (in formal Eastern Low Navarrese, I told ''you'' the truth) and ''egia erran dixut'' (''xuketa''). It is mainly used among relatives and close friends.

The ''berori'' form or '''berorika''' is very formal, and hardly used nowadays, mainly in some areas of Biscay and Gipuzkoa, to address priests, the elderly, judges and the nobility. Verbs are inflected in their singular third form, like in Italian (''(Lei) è molto gentile'', opposed to ''(tu) sei molto gentile'', you are very nice / thou art very nice) or the Spanish ''(usted) es muy amable'', opposed to ''(tú) eres muy amable'':

* neutral: ''zuk badakizu hori'' (you know it, formal), and ''zu, eser zaitez hemen'' (you, sit here),
* familiar: ''hik badakik hori'' (thou knowest that, said to a male), ''hik badakin hori'' (to a female), and ''hi, eser hadi hemen'' (sit here, for both genres),
* very formal: ''berorrek badaki hori'' (you know that: cf. ''hark badaki hori'', s/he knows that, neutral), and ''berori, eser bedi hemen'' (you, sit down here: cf ''hura, eser bedi hemen'', let him sit down here).

Unlike the ''hika'' level, ''berorika'' has no allocutive forms.

The extinct dialect of Erronkari or Roncal, spoken in the easternmost area of Navarre, presented a four-levelled system:

* neutral or ''zuketza'', the local equivalent of ''zuka'': ''etxeara xuan zra'' (you went home, you have gone home), ''etxeara xuan naz'' (I went home, I have gone home),
* informal or ''yiketza'', which corresponds to ''hika'': ''etxeara xuan yaz'', (thou wentst home, thou hast gone home), ''etxeara xuan nuk'' / ''etxeara xuan nun'' (I went home, I have been home, said to a male / to a female),
* familiar or ''tzuketza'', like the Eastern Navarrese ''xuka'': ''etxeara xuan nuzu'' (I went home, I have been home),
* and ''orika'', ''duka'' or ''duketza'', the local form of ''berorika'': ''ori etxeara xin da'' (you went home, you have been home).

=== Constructed languages ===

==== Esperanto ====
[[Esperanto]] is a T–V-distinguishing language, but usually ''vi'' is used for both singular and plural, just like ''you'' in modern English. An informal second person singular pronoun, ''ci'', indeed exists, but it is rarely used in practice. It is mainly intended to make the familiar/respectful distinction when translating (literature, for example) from languages that do have the T–V distinction.

Some have imagined ''ci'' as an archaic term that was used before and then fell out of common usage; however, this is not true. It has appeared only sometimes in experimental language. In standard Esperanto, ''vi'' has always been used since the beginning. For example, ''ci'' appears in neither the ''[[Fundamento de Esperanto|Fundamenta Gramatiko]]'' nor the ''[[Unua Libro]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dua persono |publisher= Bertilo |url=http://bertilow.com/pmeg/gramatiko/pronomoj/dua.html |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, especially in some circles, people have begun to use ''ci'' in practical language, mainly as the familiar and intimate singular, reserving ''vi'' for the plural and formal singular. Others use ''ci'' as singular and ''vi'' as plural regardless of formality.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

==== Ido ====
In [[Ido (language)|Ido]], in theory ''tu'' is limited to friends and family, whereas ''vu'' is used anywhere else. However, many users actually adapt the practice in their own mother tongue and use ''tu'' and ''vu'' accordingly. In the plural, though, the only form in use is ''vi'', which does not distinguish between formal and informal address.

In all cases, an -n is added to the original pronoun to indicate a direct object that precedes its own verb: ''Me amoras tu'' (I love you) becomes ''Tun me amoras'' if the direct object takes the first place, for example for emphatic purposes.

==== Tolkien's High Elvish ====
In [[Quenya|High Elvish]], self-named '''Quenya''', there is a distinction between singular informal ''tyë'' and singular formal ''lyë''. The plural of both forms is ''lë''. The formal form is expected between all but family members and close friends. The appendices to ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'' state that [[Westron]] followed a similar pattern, although the dialect of Shire had largely lost the formal form.

== Related verbs, nouns and pronouns ==
Some languages have a verb to describe the fact of using either a ''T'' or a ''V'' form. Some also have a related noun or pronoun. The English words are used to refer only to English usage in the past, not to usage in other languages. The analogous distinction may be expressed as "to use first names" or "to be on familiar terms (with someone)".

'''Victor Kraft''' (4 July 1880 – 3 January 1975) was an [[Austria]]n [[philosopher]], best known for being a member of the [[Vienna Circle]].

==Biography==
Kraft studied [[philosophy]], [[geography]] and [[history]] at the [[University of Vienna]]. He participated in the events of the University’s Philosophical Society, as well as with private circles (especially [[Oskar Ewald]], [[Otto Weininger]] and [[Othmar Spann]]). He received in 1903 his Ph.D. with a dissertation on "The Knowledge of the External World". Then he moved to [[Berlin]] to continue his studies under [[Georg Simmel]], [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] and [[Carl Stumpf]]. Kraft started working in 1912 at the University’s library, where he was a scientific civil servant ("[[Beamter]]") until 1939.&lt;ref name="ViennaHistoryWiki"/&gt; In 1914 he completed his [[habilitation]] under [[Adolf Stöhr]] with his book "Weltbegriff und Erkenntnisbegriff" (The Concept of world and the Concept of Knowledge). Kraft attend regularly the [[Vienna Circle]] until its dissolution, and at the same time was also a member of the Gomperz Circle and had contacts to the so-called periphery of the Vienna Circle (''e.g.'', [[Karl Popper]]). Victor Kraft received the title of associate professor for theoretical philosophy in 1924.

After the [[Anschluss]] Kraft was forced to leave his librarian position because of his wife's [[Jewish]] background. He lost his [[habilitation]] as university teacher as well. Kraft continued his philosophical research with great difficulties as "inner emigrant" during the [[Nazi]] regime.

He regained his post at the university library in 1945, and became Generalstaatsbibliothekar (national librarian) in 1947. In this year he was also appointed associate professor for philosophy. Three years later he became full professor and co-director of the school of philosophy. He retired from his post in 1952. Kraft kept his research and publishing until his death. The [[Kraft Circle]], which he chaired between 1949 and 1952/3, was named after him, and it was during this period that he supervised the dissertation of [[Paul Feyerabend]] and [[Ingeborg Bachmann]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Sigmund]], ''Exact Thinking in Demented Times: The Vienna Circle and the Epic Quest for the Foundations of Science'', Hachette UK, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Among the [[logical positivism|logical positivists]], Kraft represent a unique standing point: he wrote about a non sensualist [[empiricism]] with a hypothetical-deductive structure. Before the First World War (and after it together with the Vienna Circle members) he dedicated most of his lectures and publications to promote scientific philosophy. He also made an important contributions to the establishment of ethics as science and wrote about the theory of geography and the philosophy of history.

==Published work==

;''Imprimés interdits : La censure des journaux jaunes au Québec, 1955-1975''
In post-war Quebec, a new form of popular communication emerged: the "yellow newspapers", so named because of the poor quality of their paper. It contained all the gossip about artists, cabarets and nightlife, with content strongly dominated by sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.septentrion.qc.ca/catalogue/imprimes-interdits Septentrion, 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Sex Change, Social Change: Reflections on Identity, Institutions, and Imperialism''
This book utilizes case studies as a means to analyze elements such as [[Human rights]] and [[Prostitution]] in looking at transsexual politics in [[Quebec]] and [[Canada]]. Namaste asks what makes someone a woman and whether male to female transsexuals should be included in women's spaces.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=lfh&amp;AN=27728691&amp;site=ehost-live|title = Sex Change, Social Change: Reflections on Identity, Institutions, and Imperialism|last = Hale|first = C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3425">The '''Wiesbaden manifesto''' is a document written and signed by members of the [[Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives]] (MFAA) organization rejecting the plundering and removal of cultural items as spoils of war. The Allies created special commissions, such as the MFAA, to help protect famous European monuments from destruction, and after the war, to travel to territories previously occupied by the Germans to find Nazi art repositories. The allies found these plundered artworks in over 1,050 repositories in Germany and [[Austria]] at the end of [[World War II]]. The book ''The Safekeepers: Memoir of the Arts at the End of World War II'' by former [[Walter Farmer|Capt. Walter I. Farmer]] of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] during World War II, chronicles the recovery of and restitution of discovered hidden loot of the [[Nazi plunder]], that were stolen from museums, private collections and libraries and individual [[Jewish]] emigrants and [[death camp]] prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;The Safekeepers: A Memoir of the Arts at the End of World War II By Walter Ings Farmer, Klaus Goldmann Published by Walter de Gruyter, 2000 {{ISBN|978-3-11-016897-6}}, 242 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 1945, Capt. Walter Farmer became the collecting point's first director. The first shipment of artworks arriving at Wiesbaden included cases of antiquities, Egyptian art, Islamic artifacts, and paintings from the [[Kaiser Friedrich Museum]]. The collecting point also received materials from the [[Reichsbank]] and [[Nazi]] looted [[Poles|Polish]] liturgical collections. At its height, Wiesbaden stored, identified, and restituted approximately 700,000 individual objects, including paintings and sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=10388&lt;/ref&gt; The collecting point not only cataloged and restitutued items, but also kept them away from the [[Soviet Army]] and wartime reparations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=10388&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Opritsa D. Popa. Bibliophiles and Bibliothieves: The Search for the Hildebrandslied and the Willehalm Codex. Berlin and New York: Walter de Gruyter, 2003. xvi + 265 pp. $58.00 (cloth), {{ISBN|978-3-11-017730-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When his superiors ordered that he send to the U.S. 202 German-owned paintings in his custody, Capt. Farmer and 35 others who were in charge of the Wiesbaden collection point gathered to draw up what has become known as the Wiesbaden Manifesto on November 7, 1945, declaring "We wish to state that, from our own knowledge, no historical grievance will rankle so long or be the cause of so much justified bitterness as the removal for any reason of a part of the heritage of any nation even if that heritage may be interpreted as a prize of war." Among the co-signers was Lieutenant [[Charles Percy Parkhurst]] of the U.S. Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Walter I. Farmer. The Safekeepers: A Memoir of the Arts at the End of World War II. Berlin and New York: Walter de Gruyter, 2000. x + 242 pp., {{ISBN|978-3-11-016897-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After three years of debate, U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] ordered that the paintings be returned to Germany in 1948.

Gyasi recalls being shy as a child, feeling close to her brothers for their shared experiences as young immigrant children in Alabama, and turning to books as her "closest friends".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She received a certificate of achievement signed by [[LeVar Burton]] after submitting the first story she wrote to the [[PBS Kids Writers Contest|Reading Rainbow Young Writers and Illustrators Contest]], which encouraged her, and after reading [[Toni Morrison]]'s [[Song of Solomon (novel)|''Song of Solomon'']] while attending [[Grissom High School]] at the age of 17, she was inspired to choose a career in writing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

She earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in English at [[Stanford University|Stanford]], and a [[Master of Fine Arts]] from the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]], a creative writing program at the [[University of Iowa]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SFG-160628"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/books/article/How-Yaa-Gyasi-found-her-story-in-slavers-8329849.php |title=How Yaa Gyasi found her story in slavers' outpost |author=Wolfe, Eli |date=June 28, 2016 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=March 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Shortly after graduating from Stanford, she began her debut novel and worked at a startup company in San Francisco, but she did not enjoy the work and resigned after she was accepted to Iowa in 2012.&lt;ref name=SFG-160628 /&gt;

Her debut novel ''[[Homegoing (Gyasi novel)|Homegoing]]'' was inspired by a 2009 trip to Ghana, Gyasi's first since leaving the country as an infant. The novel was completed in 2015, and after initial readings from publishers, was met with numerous offers before she accepted a seven-figure advance from [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]].&lt;ref name=SFG-160628 /&gt; [[Ta-Nehisi Coates]] selected ''Homegoing'' for the National Book Foundation's 2016 "5 under 35" award,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and the novel also was selected for the National Book Critics Circle's John Leonard Award, the [[Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award|PEN/Hemingway award]] for best first book, and the American Book Award for contributions to diversity in American literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/aug/4/debut-novelist-among-winners-of-american-book-awar/|title=Debut novelist among winners of American Book Awards|last=|first=|date=August 4, 2017|work=The Washington Times|access-date=|author=Associated Press|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alter-170117"&gt;Alter, Alexandra, [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/arts/zadie-smith-and-michael-chabon-among-national-book-critics-circle-finalists.html?_r=0 "Zadie Smith and Michael Chabon Among National Book Critics Circle Finalists"], ''New York Times'', January 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pen-ne.org/hemingway/|title=PEN/Hemingway Award for Debut Fiction|last=|first=|date=|website=PEN New England|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/23/books/review/100-notable-books-of-2016.html|title=100 Notable Books of 2016|date=November 21, 2016|access-date=December 2, 2016|issn=0362-4331|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
