The '''anti-Jewish violence in Poland from 1944 to 1946''' refers to a series of violent incidents in [[Poland]] that immediately followed the [[end of World War II in Europe]] and influenced the postwar [[history of Jews in Poland|history of the Jews as well as Polish-Jewish relations]]. It occurred amid a period of violence and anarchy across the country, caused by lawlessness and [[Anti-communist resistance in Poland (1944–46)|anti-communist resistance]] against the [[History of Poland (1945–1989)#Consolidation of communist power|Soviet-backed communist takeover of Poland]].&lt;ref name="Cich2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prazm2004"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ReF8DAAAQBAJ&amp;q=national+uprising |page=11 |year=2004 |title=Civil War in Poland 1942-1948 |last=Prazmowska |first=Anita J. |publisher=Springer |author-link=Anita J.

Jewish emigration from Poland surged partly as a result of this violence, but also because Poland was the only [[Eastern Bloc]] country to allow free Jewish emigration (''[[aliyah]]'') to [[Mandatory Palestine]].&lt;ref name="D-H"/&gt; By contrast, the Soviet Union brought Soviet Jews from [[DP camp]]s back to USSR by force irrespective of their choice.&lt;ref name="Kochavi-15"/&gt; Many Jews did not wish to remain where the German occupation had decimated their previously large communities in Poland; many fled the imposition of the Soviet-backed political regime which persecuted the bourgeoisie and religion, including Judaism; many aimed to pursue the [[Zionist]] objectives in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].&lt;ref name="Chodakiewicz-36"&gt;Marek Jan Chodakiewicz, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hdImAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Poland's+borders+were+closely+guarded%22+%22fight+for+a+Jewish+State%22&amp;dq=%22Poland's+borders+were+closely+guarded%22+%22fight+for+a+Jewish+State%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5q4IUZyCB4O2iwLE6oCwBw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA  ''After the Holocaust: Polish-Jewish Conflict in the Wake of World War II''] (Boulder, CO: East European Monographs, distributed by Columbia University Press, 2003), 35-36. {{ISBN|0-88033-511-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Uninterrupted traffic across the Polish borders intensified with many Jews passing through on their way west or south. In January 1946, there were 86,000 survivors registered with the [[Central Committee of Polish Jews]] (CKŻP). By the end of summer, the number had risen to about 205,000–210,000 (with 240,000 registrations and over 30,000 duplicates).&lt;ref name="yivo.org"/&gt; About 180,000 Jewish refugees came from the Soviet Union after the repatriation agreement.&lt;ref name="yivo.org" /&gt; Most left without visas or exit permits thanks to a decree of General [[Marian Spychalski]].&lt;ref name=D-H /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ther-Siljak"/&gt; By the spring of 1947 only 90,000 Jews resided in Poland.&lt;ref name="Stankowski"/&gt;&lt;ref name="N-A"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lukas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="M-S"/&gt;

Tens of thousands of people were killed in Poland's two-year civil war, but also due to indiscriminate postwar lawlessness and abject poverty. Among the Jewish victims of violence directed against the new government were numerous functionaries of the [[History of Poland (1945–1989)#Stalinist era (1948–1956)|new Stalinist regime]], assassinated by the so-called [[cursed soldiers]] of the anti-communist underground, without racial motives, but simply due to their political loyalties.&lt;ref name="SG-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gross"/&gt; [[Jan T. Gross]] noted that "only a fraction of [the Jewish] deaths could be attributed to [[anti-semitism]]."&lt;ref name="gross"/&gt; Jews were also often victims of ordinary banditry. The Jewish resistance fighter [[Marek Edelman]] said: "murdering Jews was pure banditry, and I wouldn't explain it as anti-Semitism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=89813 The Jerusalem Post, January 23, 2008 editorial.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610212049/http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=89813 |date=June 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resentment towards returning Jews among some local Poles included concerns that they would reclaim their property.&lt;ref name=na/&gt; 

==Background==
===Property claims and restitution===

A restitution law "On Abandoned Real Estates" of May 6, 1945 allowed property owners who had been dispossessed, or their relatives and heirs, to reclaim privately owned property under a simplified inheritance procedure. The law remained in effect until the end of 1948. An expedited court process with minimal costs was put in place to handle claims. Applications had to be examined within 21 days, and many claims were processed the day they were filed. Poles often served as witnesses to corroborate claims of Jewish neighbors and acquaintances. Jewish law firms and agencies outside Poland specialized in submitting applications on behalf of non-residents. Properties were also transferred and sold by Jewish owners outside this process.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Grabowski and Dariusz Libionka, eds. ''Klucze i kasa: O mieniu żydowskim w Polsce pod okupacją niemiecką i we wczesnych latach powojennych 1939–1950'' (Warsaw: Stowarzyszenie Centrum Badań nad Zagładą 2014), 522–523, 529, 568–569, 575–607. Also Krzysztof Urbański. ''Kieleccy Żydzi'' (Kraków: Pracownia Konserwacji Zabytków w Kielcach and Małopolska Oficyna Wydawnicza, n.d. [1993]), 180–190; Marta Pawlina-Meducka, ed. ''Z kroniki utraconego sąsiedztwa: Kielce, wrzesień 2000/From the Chronicle of the Lost Neighborhood: Kielce, September 2000'' (Kielce: Kieleckie Towarzystwo Naukowe, 2001), 202.&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of properties were successively reclaimed, for example, more than 520 properties were reclaimed in two county towns of Lublin province alone (281 applications in Zamość, and 240 in Włodawa - some applications involved multiple properties).&lt;ref name="Kopciowski"&gt; Adam Kopciowski. ''Zagłada Żydów w Zamościu'' (Lublin: Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Marii Curie-Skłodowskiej, 2005), 203; Adam Kopciowski, "Anti-Jewish Incidents in the Lublin Region in the Early Years after World War II," ''≈Holocaust: Studies and Materials'' vol. 1 (2008), 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Given the lax criteria, there were a number of cases of Jews advancing fraudulent property claims.&lt;ref&gt; Jan Grabowski and Dariusz Libionka, eds. ''Klucze i kasa: O mieniu żydowskim w Polsce pod okupacją niemiecką i we wczesnych latach powojennych 1939–1950'' (Warsaw: Stowarzyszenie Centrum Badań nad Zagładą 2014), 528, 532, 536–537, 595–600. Also Krzysztof Persak, "Akta postępowań cywilnych z lat 1947–1949 w sprawach dotyczących zmarłych żydowskich mieszkańców Jedwabnego," in Paweł Machcewicz and Krzysztof Persak, eds. ''Wokół Jedwabnego'' (Warsaw: Instytut Pamięci Narodowej—Komisja Ścigania Zbrodni przeciwko Narodowi Polskiemu, 2002) vol. 1, 379–387.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Vast quantities of Jewish property were unclaimed due to Jews being murdered when they sought restitution of family property and due to Jews fleeing postwar Poland. The murders, variously estimated, intimidated Jews from filing claims. Unclaimed Jewish property devolved to the Polish state on 31 December 1948, but many Jews who had fled to the Soviet Union were only repatriated after this date and Jews in displaced persons camps in Germany feared returning to Poland, and those who attempted to do so were usually blocked by the Polish authorities. Polish legislation in 1947 severely restricted interstate succession, limiting inheritance by distant family members.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=j6B_DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=%22Jewish+property%22+poland&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRhZLehpnbAhUB-6QKHfnkC_gQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Jewish%20property%22%20poland&amp;f=false The Plunder of Jewish Property during the Holocaust: Confronting European History], Palgrave, Laurence Weinbaum, pages 100-1&lt;/ref&gt; Jews who returned to Poland from the Soviet Union and settled in the territories Poland acquired from Germany were entitled to material compensation on equal footing with ethnic Poles who were displaced from Eastern Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=sEVJzfNbuUwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Jewish+property%22+poland&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRhZLehpnbAhUB-6QKHfnkC_gQ6AEILDAB#v=snippet&amp;q=poland&amp;f=false Robbery and Restitution: The Conflict Over Jewish Property in Europe], Berghan Books in association with [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], [[Dariusz Stola]], pages 244-248&lt;/ref&gt; Jews were also seen as supporting the consolidation of power in the hands of the Soviet and Polish [[Stalinist]] regimes.&lt;ref name=na/&gt;&lt;ref name="W-C"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MG-RH"/&gt;

===Holocaust survivors and returnees===
After the war, Poles and Jews constituted two communities with two different but tragic war experiences, however the [[History of the Jews in Poland|relations between Polish and Jewish communities]] worsened after the [[History of Poland (1945–1989)|Soviet takeover]] of Poland in 1945.&lt;ref name=IRC&gt;{{cite book |title=Traditional Jewish Attitudes Toward Poles |author=Mark Paul |publisher=International Research Center |year=2007 |work=Holocaust re-visited |via=direct download, 106 pages in PDF |location=Chicago, Ill. |url=http://www.internationalresearchcenter.org/research_center/media/TraditionalJewishAttitudesTowardPoles.pdf |quote=A recent survey of Jewish history textbooks confirms that the stereotype of the crude Polish peasant was a staple of that genre: Jewish textbooks relentlessly portrayed the Poles in a negative light and depicted Polish history in lurid colours. Christian peasants — that much maligned 'Other' — were often described as bestial. After the Second World War the situation was compounded, as frequent charges of collaboration and collusion in the Holocaust became commonplace. From the oust Poles were conspicuously omitted from accounts of 'righteous Gentiles' who saved Jews; even though they represented the largest group of rescuers.&lt;sup&gt;275&lt;/sup&gt; What is remarkable is that the deepest anti-Polish biases are held and disseminated by Jewish academics, especially non-historians, but also those in Holocaust-related fields.&lt;sup&gt;276&lt;/sup&gt; |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polish Jewish survivors of the Nazi Holocaust returning home were confronted with fears of being physically assaulted, robbed and even murdered by certain elements in the society.&lt;ref name="Szaynok270"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Michlic214"/&gt; The situation was further complicated by the fact that there were more Jewish survivors returning from the Soviet Union than those who managed to survive in [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|occupied Poland]],&lt;ref name="MB-HS"/&gt; thus leading to stereotypes holding Jews responsible for the imposition of totalitarian regime in [[People's Republic of Poland|Stalinist Poland]].

Members of the former [[Communist Party of Poland]] (KPP) were returning home from the Soviet Union as prominent functionaries of the new regime. Among them was a highly visible number of Poles of Jewish origin, who became active in the [[Polish Workers' Party]]/[[Polish United Workers' Party]] and the [[Ministry of Public Security of Poland]], among them [[Hilary Minc]], the third in command in [[Bolesław Bierut]]'s political apparatus and [[Jakub Berman]], head of State Security Services (UB, [[Urząd Bezpieczeństwa]]) considered Joseph Stalin's right hand in Poland between 1944 and 1953.&lt;ref name="hoover"/&gt; Jewish representation in Bolesław Bierut's apparatus of political oppression was considerably higher than their share in the general Polish population.&lt;ref name="IPN-UB" /&gt; Hypothesis emerged that Stalin had intentionally employed some of them in positions of repressive authority (see Gen. [[Roman Romkowski]], Dir. [[Anatol Fejgin]] and others) in order to put Poles and Jews "on a collision course."&lt;ref name="TP-2"/&gt; Study by the Polish [[Institute of National Remembrance]] showed that between 1944 and 1954 out of 450 people in director positions in the [[Ministry of Public Security of Poland|Ministry]], 37.1% (or 167) were Jewish.&lt;ref name="IPN-UB"/&gt; The underground anti-communist press held them responsible for the murder of Polish opponents of the new regime.&lt;ref name="Blatamn2006"/&gt; Historian [[Marek Jan Chodakiewicz]] estimates that in the first years after the war, the Jewish denunciations and direct involvement in the pro-Soviet wave of terror, resulted in the killing of approximately 3,500 to 6,500 non-Jewish Poles including members of the [[Home Army]] and [[National Armed Forces]].&lt;ref name="gazeta.pl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chodakiewicz-213"&gt;Marek Jan Chodakiewicz, After the Holocaust: Polish-Jewish Conflict in the Wake of World War II (Boulder, CO: East European Monographs, distributed by Columbia University Press, 2003), 213. {{ISBN|0-88033-511-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-communist armed resistance===
{{further|Anti-communist resistance in Poland (1944–1946)}}
As the victory over Nazi Germany was celebrated in the West, in May 1945, Polish partisans attacked country offices of the PUBP, [[Milicja Obywatelska|MO]] (communist state police), UB and [[NKVD]] employing numerous Jewish functionaries. Up to 80 percent of the officers, and 50 percent of the militiamen in Lublin alone,&lt;ref name="Piotrowski-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sack"/&gt; as well as, up to 75 percent of the officers in Silesia were Jewish.&lt;ref name="Sack"/&gt; According to Eisenstein's estimates, 90&amp;nbsp;percent of the Jewish functionaries at the state security office in [[Katowice]] changed their names to Polish ones after November 10, 1945 for anonymity sake.&lt;ref name="Piotrowski-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sack"/&gt; In May 1945, public security offices were destroyed by the anti-communist underground in [[Krasnosielc]] and [[Annówka, Lublin Voivodeship|Annówka]] (May 1), [[Kuryłówka]] (May 7), [[Grajewo]] and [[Białystok]] (May 9), [[Siemiatycze]] and [[Wyrzyki, Pułtusk County|Wyrzyki]] (May 11), [[Ostrołęka]] and [[Rembertów]] (May 18–21), [[Biała Podlaska]] (May 21, May 24), [[Majdan, Hajnówka County|Majdan-Topiło]] ([[Białowieża Forest]], May 28), [[Busko-Zdrój|Kotki (Busko-Zdrój)]] (May 28).

Polish–Jewish DPs (25 percent of their grand total in the beginning of 1947) were declared nonrepatriable – due in part to the US pressure – which forced the British government to open the borders of Palestine.&lt;ref name="Kochavi-31"/&gt; By the spring of 1947 the number of Jews in Poland – in large part arriving from the Soviet Union – declined from 240,000 to 90,000 due to mass migration and the post-Holocaust absence of Jewish life in Poland.&lt;ref name="MB-HS"/&gt; "The flight" ([[Berihah]]) of Jews was motivated by the raging civil war on Polish lands, in as much as the efforts of strong Polish-Jewish lobby at the Jewish Agency working towards the higher standard of living and special privileges for the immigrants from Poland.

==Blood libel==
The prewar class of Polish intelligentsia ceased to exist. In the country of 23.7 million people in 1946, there were only 40,000 university graduates who survived the genocide; less than 0.2 percent of the general population.&lt;ref name="WiHisPol"/&gt; Between 1944 and 1956 some 350,000–400,000 Poles were held in Stalinist prisons.&lt;ref name="Grzes2010"/&gt; Sporadic anti-Jewish disturbances or riots were enticed by the spread of false [[blood libel]] accusations against some Jews in Polish towns – [[Kraków]], [[Kielce]], [[Bytom]], [[Białystok]], [[Bielawa]], [[Częstochowa]], [[Legnica]], [[Otwock]], [[Rzeszów]], [[Sosnowiec]], [[Szczecin]], [[Tarnów]].&lt;ref name="Gross"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aleksiun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Piotrowski136"/&gt; Acts of anti-Jewish violence were also recorded in villages and small towns of central Poland, where the overwhelming majority of attacks occurred.&lt;ref name="Engel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Retribution"/&gt; According to Szaynok, the perpetrators of the anti-Jewish actions were seldom punished.&lt;ref name="Szaynok271"/&gt;

The [[Kraków pogrom]] of August 11, 1945, was the first anti-Jewish riot in postwar Poland,&lt;ref name="Michlic347"/&gt; resulting in the shooting death of one woman, [[Róża Berger]], who was hiding from the security forces behind closed doors.&lt;ref name="Kon2005"/&gt; A single shot was fired at a locking mechanism which shattered, piercing her body.&lt;ref name="Kon2005"/&gt; The immediate cause for the disturbance was a rumour spread by a young hooligan (who later claimed to have been tricked into it) that the corpses of Christian children were hidden at the [[Kupa Synagogue]].&lt;ref name="Cichopek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lib2002"/&gt; During the riot, Jews were attacked in [[Kazimierz]], and other parts of the Old Town. Fire was set in Kupa Synagogue. In total, 145 suspects were arrested including 40 militiamen and 6 soldiers of the WP. In September and October 1945 some 25 of them were charged and 10 of them were sentenced to prison.&lt;ref name="Lib2002"/&gt; Shortly after the Kielce pogrom, violence against Jews in Poland had ceased entirely.&lt;ref name="Engel"/&gt;

===Kielce pogrom===
{{Main article|Kielce pogrom}}
A [[Kielce pogrom|pogrom]] (the causes of which are still [[Kielce pogrom#Speculations over Soviet involvement|very controversial]]),&lt;ref name="Piotrowski136"/&gt; erupted in Kielce on July 4, 1946.&lt;ref name="Phoney Peace"/&gt; The rumour that a Polish boy had been kidnapped by Jews but had managed to escape, and that other Polish children had been ritually murdered by Jews – according to Pynsent – ignited a violent public reaction directed at the Jewish Center.&lt;ref name="Phoney Peace"/&gt;{{Verify source|date=January 2011}} Attacks on Jewish residents of Kielce were provoked by units of the communist militia and the Soviet-controlled Polish Army who confirmed the rumors of the kidnapping. Police and soldiers were also the first to fire shots at Jews – according to Szaynok.&lt;ref name="Szaynok272"/&gt;

Having analyzed the Kielce pogrom for years, author Krzysztof Kąkolewski (''Umarły cmentarz''), came to the conclusion that the Russian NKVD had planned the pogrom in Kielce ahead of time. As he pointed out, there were two very important occasions to be considered that day. In the Nuremberg tribunal, the [[Katyn massacre]] committed against the Polish officers was being investigated, a Russian war crime for which the Russians held Germans responsible. Also, there was a celebration of the United States Day taking place, attended in Warsaw by many foreign officials and journalists. It was a perfect time for the NKVD to paint a picture of Poland as being antisemitic, and to blame the [[Home Army]] (AK) for the violence. At the time of the pogrom in Kielce, Kąkolewski was 16 years old and lived just few hundred meters from the crime scene. He claims that it was impossible for people to gather out on the street; the police immediately approached any group of 3-4 persons for identification. Furthermore, Kąkolewski claims that the ordinary people were turned away by an army unit that set up a street blockade. The second part of the same building housed members of the communist party, most of them of Jewish origin, who were not attacked at all. Kąkolewski emphasized also that there were more than 300 members of the secret police and army, present at the scene, of whom many were wearing civilian clothes, not to mention some Russian-speaking soldiers that participated in the pogrom. The fact that the high-ranking officials from NKVD were in the town at that moment would also support this theory. Of the 12 persons who faced trial, 9 were sentenced to death. According to Kąkolewski, none of them was responsible for the crime; they have been picked up from the watching crowd by the secret police.&lt;ref name="angora"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Piotrowski136"/&gt;

The pogrom in Kielce resulted in 42 people being murdered and about 50 seriously injured,&lt;ref name="The World Reacts to the Holocaust"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Piotrowski136"/&gt; yet the number of victims does not reflect the impact of the atrocities committed. The Kielce pogrom was a turning point for the postwar history of Polish Jews – according to Michael R. Marrus, as the Zionist underground concluded that there was no future for Jews in Europe.&lt;ref name="Marrus" /&gt; Soon after, Gen. Spychalski signed a decree allowing Jews to leave Poland without visas or exit permits;&lt;ref name="Kochavi-175"/&gt; and the Jewish emigration from Poland increased dramatically.&lt;ref name="Marrus"/&gt; In July 1946, almost 20,000 Jews left Poland. By September, there were approximately 12,000 Jews left.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/education/newsletter/33/anti_jewish.asp|title=Anti-Jewish Violence in Poland After Liberation|last=Ochayon|first=Sheryl|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain demanded that Poland (among others) halt the Jewish exodus, but their pressure was largely unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Kochavi-xi"/&gt;

==Number of victims==

A statistical compendium of "Jewish deaths by violence for which specific record is extant, by month and province" was compiled by Engel for the [[Yad Vashem]] Shoah Resource Center's International School for Holocaust Studies.&lt;ref name="Engel"/&gt; The study used as a starting point a 1973 report by historian [[Lucjan Dobroszycki]], who wrote that he had "analyzed records, reports, cables, protocols and press-cuttings of the period pertaining to anti-Jewish assaults and murders in 115 localities" in which approximately 300 Jewish deaths had been documented.&lt;ref name="dobroszycki"/&gt;

A number of historians, including [[Antony Polonsky]] and [[Jan T. Gross]]&lt;ref name="Retribution106"/&gt; cite the figures originating from Dobroszycki's 1973 work.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; Dobroszycki wrote that "according to general estimates 1,500 Jews lost their lives in Poland from liberation until the summer of 1947",&lt;ref name="cited"/&gt; although historian Jan Gross who cited Dobroszycki, informed that only a fraction of these deaths can be attributed to antisemitism and that most were due to general postwar disorder, political violence and banditry.&lt;ref name="gross"/&gt; David Engel wrote that Dobroszycki "offered no reference for such 'general estimates'" which "have not been confirmed by any other investigator" and "no proof-text for this figure" exists, not even a smaller one of 1,000 claimed by Gutman.&lt;ref name="Gutman"/&gt; According to Engel, "both estimates seem high."&lt;ref name="Engel"/&gt; Other estimates include those of Anna Cichopek claiming more than 1,000 Jews murdered in Poland between 1944 and 1947.&lt;ref name="Cichopek221"/&gt; According to Stefan Grajek around 1,000 Jews died in the first half of year 1946.&lt;ref name="Aleksander Klugman"/&gt;  Historian [[Tadeusz Piotrowski (sociologist)|Tadeusz Piotrowski]] estimated that between 1944 and 1947 there were 1,500–2,000 Jewish victims of general civil strife that came about with Soviet consolidation of power, constituting 2 to 3 percent of the total number of victims of postwar violence in the country.&lt;ref name="Piotrowski2"/&gt;

In the ''Yad Vashem Studies'' paper, Holocaust historian [[David Engel (historian)|David Engel]] wrote:
{{quote|[Dobroszycki] did not report the results of that analysis except in the most general terms, nor did he indicate the specific sources from which he had compiled his list of cases. Nevertheless, a separate, systematic examination of the relevant files in the archive of the Polish Ministry of Public Administration, supplemented by reports prepared by the United States embassy in Warsaw and by Jewish sources in Poland, as well as by bulletins published by the Central Committee of Polish Jews and the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, has lent credibility to Dobroszycki's claim: it has turned up more or less detailed descriptions of 130 incidents in 102 locations between September 1944 and September 1946, in which 327 Jews lost their lives. —&amp;nbsp;[[David Engel (historian)|David Engel]], Yad Vashem.&lt;ref name="Engel"/&gt;}}

The data from the Yad Vashem study are reproduced in the table below. Engel wrote that the compilation of cases is not exhaustive, suggesting that cases of anti-Jewish violence were selectively reported and recorded, and that there was no centralized, systematic effort record these cases. He cites numerous incidental reports of killings of Jews that for which no official reporting has survived. He concludes that these figures have "obvious weaknesses" and that the detailed records used to compile them are clearly deficient and lacking data from Białystok region. For example, Engel cites one source that shows a total of 108 Jewish deaths during March 1945, and another source that shows 351 deaths between November 1944 and December 1945.&lt;ref name="Engel"/&gt;

Chodakiewicz's estimates for Jewish deaths in Poland after World War II are somewhat higher than Engel's. In "After the Holocaust," Chodakiewicz states: "In sum, probably a minimum of 400 and a maximum of 700 Jews and persons of Jewish origin perished in Poland from July 1944 to January 1947."&lt;ref name="Chodakiewicz-212"&gt;Marek Jan Chodakiewicz, ''After the Holocaust: Polish-Jewish Conflict in the Wake of World War II'' (Boulder, CO: East European Monographs, distributed by Columbia University Press, 2003), 212-213. {{ISBN|0-88033-511-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early History==
[[File:SetauketCoastline1794.jpg|left]][[File:LowsCTmap.jpeg|right|thumb]]
Colonists from New England purchased land in 1655 from the Setalcott Indians and began peaceably living there at what was then a 'tract of land extending from [[Stony Brook, New York|Stony Brook]] to and including [[Port Jefferson, New York|Port Jefferson]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://longislandgenealogy.com/indians.html|title=Long Island Indians and The Early Settlers|website=longislandgenealogy.com|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maap.columbia.edu/place/then.html#map=434024u&amp;z=15.436&amp;cx=0.505&amp;cy=0.459&amp;view=map_marks|title=MAAP - Places: Then|website=maap.columbia.edu|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[American Revolutionary War|revolutionary war]] the [[Setauket|Setalket]] harbor was across Long Island Sound from [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield, Conn]]. The British had consolidated their hold on New York City and Long Island during the winter months of early 1777, while the Continental Army established a land blockade around the city in New Jersey, southern New York, and southwestern Connecticut. On the night of August 21,  Colonel [[Samuel Blachley Webb]] and his [[9th Connecticut Regiment|regiment]] set out across Long Island Sound in [[whaleboats]], taking a few small brass cannons. Early the next morning they landed at Crane's Neck (in present-day [[Old Field, New York|Old Field]], just west of Setauket), and marched to Setauket. The resulting [[Battle of Setauket|battle]] ended when the [[Minutemen]] could not breach the [[Breastwork (fortification)|breastwork]]s around the [[Setauket Presbyterian Church and Burial Ground|Presbyterian meeting house]] and they retreated across the sound with a few dozen trophy horses and some quilts.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Charles S (1905). Letters and Life of Samuel Holden Parsons. Binghamton, NY: Otseningo Publishing Co. OCLC 2603857.&lt;/ref&gt;

An 1853 document states that in the year 1815, slave owners Isaac Satterly and Benjamin F. Thompson took legal action to designate land along Christian Avenue, in Setauket, as a cemetery for people of color. This site is still known as Laurel Hill Cemetery, which has been under the trusteeship of Bethel AME Church&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bethel+AME+Church/@40.94224,-73.121881,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1sAF1QipPwVxlQ07nE0_APBe4eMbByJQOnlAzcarYC_ot6!2e10!3e12!6shttps://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwVxlQ07nE0_APBe4eMbByJQOnlAzcarYC_ot6=w203-h270-k-no!7i1932!8i2576!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x89e83f1e9d27ff13:0x2c6bb4e671745787!2sChristian+Ave,+Setauket-+East+Setauket,+NY!3b1!8m2!3d40.9409718!4d-73.1249261!3m4!1s0x89e83f086103a9c3:0x2a1fb9a114f86e96!8m2!3d40.9422398!4d-73.1218813|title=Google Maps|website=Google Maps|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; since 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/05/nyregion/setalcotts-hidden-in-plain-view.html|title=Setalcotts: Hidden In Plain View|first=Julia C.|last=Mead|publisher=|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848 A tract of land was deeded to the Bethel AME, for the site of the original church, which was destroyed by fire in 1871. Old Bethel Cemetery on Christian Avenue in [[Stony Brook, New York|Stony Brook]] was the location of the first Bethel AME Church in the area. This deed provided 1/8th acre of land to the church board for a church. A line of stones laying on the ground behind the front of a line of gravestones marks the building's original foundation. The church moved to the current location in 1871 and the new church was built in 1874. It was also in 1871 that the trustees took control of the Laurel Hill Cemetery. The new church was destroyed by fire in 1909 but was quickly rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://parks.ny.gov/newsroom/documents/169thHPStateReviewBoardMeetingNotes.pdf|format=PDF|title=169th Meeting of the NYS Board for Historic Preservation|website=Parks.ny.gov|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setalcott Indians==
Preservations acknowledged the area is one of the last remaining intact communities that represents the African-American and Native American population on Long Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newsday.com/long-island/towns/preservation-group-designates-american-indian-and-african-american-site-in-setauket-as-historic-1.7220711|title=Preservation group designates American Indian and African-American site in Setauket as historic|publisher=|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; MAP - BCALH&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.brookhavenny.gov/Portals/0/Documents/AdvisoryCommittees/Bethel%20Christian%20Avenue%20Laurel%20Hill%20Historic%20District.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-07-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726005807/https://www.brookhavenny.gov/Portals/0/Documents/AdvisoryCommittees/Bethel%20Christian%20Avenue%20Laurel%20Hill%20Historic%20District.pdf |archive-date=2018-07-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The indigenous Setalcott Native American tribe were in Setalket when Europeans first landed. The [[sachem]]s Warawakmy and Mahue gave permission for land use to the whites, who subsequently brought African slaves to the Town of Brookhaven about the year 1670.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/18brookli.html|title=Nearly Lost, 17th-Century Papers Are Restored|first=Nicole|last=Cotroneo|publisher=|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent generations of Setalcotts and Africans intermarried, the Harts and the Sells, Eato, Lewis, Edwards, Phillips, Scott, Green, Seaman, Young, and Tobias families forming a blend of natives and blacks. Most found work as servants and laborers, the population was organized, economically stable, and has persisted into the present. They were prohibited at the time from living elsewhere in the district and the pastoral guidance of the church created a community separate from the whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maap.columbia.edu/place/71|title=MAAP - Place Detail: Setauket|website=maap.columbia.edu|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Longisland.png|thumb|right|Longisland]]The BCALH historic district was designated in 2005 and is an attempt at preserving the history and culture of the people still living in that area. The Christian Avenue community is a 'distinct and indigenous way of life that has survived in [[Setauket-East Setauket, New York|Setauket]] for centuries'. Threatened in 2007 a community group was formed to get further recognition for the area, aided by preservationists and archeologists at Stony Brook University the documentation needed for its survival was archived and catalogued. The districts predominantly Native and African American homes were not included in any of the [[Three Village Central School District|Three Village historic districts]] and was not protected by any preservation laws.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.3villagecsd.k12.ny.us/Elementary/minnesauke/3villagehist/projinfo.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Setauket gentrified in the late 20th Century and some homes have been sold and demolished. They are removed from historical memory and subsequently excluded from the historic preservation measures that protect other sites in Old Setauket, the presence of the minority community gets smaller with each decade.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saa.org/CurrentResearch/pdf/saa_cro_277_A_CounterMap_of_Setauket,.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The active efforts by community members, local school groups and college students culminated in the historical preservation project called- 'A Long Time Coming'.  The goals were to help BCALH resist a common trend of historic minority community displacements across the United States by tax increases and gentrification&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/24/nyregion/fighting-to-preserve-a-chapter-of-setauket-history.html|title=Fighting to Preserve a Chapter of Setauket History|publisher=|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which caused them to be pushed out from where they have been for generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brookhavenny.gov/Committees/Historic-District-Advisory|title=Historic District Advisory Committee|website=Brookhavenny.gov|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developments include the ''Christian Avenue School'' – Original buildings dating back from earlier part of the century which were used for Kindergarten and 1st grade before closing in late 1970s. They were demolished and redeveloped as residential homes in the 1990s.

The BCALH historic district stood out from other sites in Long Island because it recognized both the historic and the cultural significance of the blended Native and African American community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/03/nyregion/preserving-black-landmarks-in-setauket.html|title=Preserving Black Landmarks in Setauket|first=Vivian S.|last=Toy|publisher=|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The district includes the Laurel Hill cemetery, the church, an American Legion building and 30 homes.&lt;ref&gt;http://wshu.org/post/setauket-s-mixed-heritage-community-seeks-national-recognition&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Metoac|Setalcott]] tribe is not recognized by the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) due to the size of the remaining tribe members and their self-identification.

==Eato house==
[[File:Amesheild.svg|right|thumb]]
The home of one of Bethel AME Church's first pastors has been recently added to the '''Society for the Preservation of Long Island Antiquities''' List of Endangered Historic Places. Richard Hawkins, a local resident had owned the property, He was known as a broker for African-American buyers who during the Jim Crow era could not get a loan from traditional sources.&lt;ref name="tbrnewsmedia.com"/&gt;

The Rev David Eato's House is located in BCALH's District and is currently owned by the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church|Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bethel+AME+Church/@40.94224,-73.121881,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1sAF1QipP0WdeiWo4yYFACUT3GyYH8h7H7D2C0tTZo_OSX!2e10!3e12!6shttps://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0WdeiWo4yYFACUT3GyYH8h7H7D2C0tTZo_OSX=w318-h86-k-no!7i2608!8i704!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x89e83f1e9d27ff13:0x2c6bb4e671745787!2sChristian+Ave,+Setauket-+East+Setauket,+NY!3b1!8m2!3d40.9409718!4d-73.1249261!3m4!1s0x89e83f086103a9c3:0x2a1fb9a114f86e96!8m2!3d40.9422398!4d-73.1218813|title=Google Maps|website=Google Maps|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was proposed to be restored by the society.  Eato, one of the church's first pastors, and his wife Mary Baker, a freed slave from the south lived there until the 30's. Bethel AME historian, Carlton "Hub" Edwards, said when Mary moved to the North after being freed from slavery she settled in Port Washington where she was an organist at a church. It was there that she met Eato and, after marrying, the couple moved to Setauket and the reverend became one of the first ministers of Setauket's Bethel AME in the early 1900s. Mary took on the role of superintendent of the Sunday school and held the position until the late 1930s.&lt;ref name="tbrnewsmedia.com"/&gt;

'''Black Cultural Archives''' ('''BCA''') was founded in 1981, by educationalist and historian [[Len Garrison]] and others. BCA's mission is to record, preserve and celebrate the history of people of African descent in [[Great Britain|Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bcaheritage.org.uk/about/ "About Us"], Black Cultural Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; The BCA's new building in [[Brixton]], opened in 2014, enables access to the archive collection, provides dedicated learning spaces and mounts a programme of exhibitions and events.&lt;ref name=V&amp;A /&gt;

==History==
In 1981, Len Garrison and other members of the [[Black British]] community started a collection, originally housed in [[Coldharbour Lane]] in [[Brixton]] and later based in [[Kennington]],&lt;ref name=Lambethtalk&gt;[http://love.lambeth.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Black-Cultural-Archives-special.pdf "Black Cultural Archives is coming home 24 July 2014 – Black Cultural Archives moves back to Brixton and into a new heritage centre"], ''Lambeth Talk'', June 2014.&lt;/REF&gt; that sought to redress the historical imbalance of the representation of black people in Britain.&lt;ref name=Collections&gt;[http://bcaheritage.org.uk/our-collections/ "Our Collections"], Black Cultural Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the BCA won major funding, including £5million from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] (HLF) and the [[London Development Agency]],&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Pears, [http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/work-starts-long-awaited-national-black-heritage-centre "Work Starts On Long-Awaited National Black Heritage Centre"], ''[[The Voice (newspaper)|The Voice]]'', 11 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and moved back to Brixton to become the UK's first national black heritage centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Boris Johnson and Lottery Fund announce £5m funding for black cultural centre in Brixton| publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''| accessdate = | url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/oct/12/boris-johnson-lottery-fund-black-cultural-centre-brixton| location=London| first=Paul| last=Owen| date=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A site dedication ceremony took place in June 2013,&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Waters, [http://www.brixtonblog.com/black-cultural-archives-site-dedication-ceremony/13165 "Black Cultural Archives Site Dedication Ceremony"], Brixton Blog, 8 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and the new BCA building – a [[Grade II-listed]] [[Georgian architecture|Georgian building]], the former [[Raleigh Hall]]&lt;ref name=Lambethtalk /&gt; – at 1 [[Windrush Square]], was officially opened on 24 July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dotun Adebayo]], [http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/new-black-cultural-archives-are-worth-their-wait-gold "New Black Cultural Archives Are Worth Their Wait In Gold"], ''The Voice'', 8 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Dickens, [http://www.brixtonblog.com/moving-celebration-marks-long-journey-to-the-black-cultural-archives-launch-in-brixton/23813 "Moving celebration marks long journey to the Black Cultural Archives launch in Brixton"], Brixton Blog, 24 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Heritage Centre| publisher = Black Cultural Archives| accessdate = | url = http://pages.bcaheritage.org.uk/| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110210160227/http://pages.bcaheritage.org.uk/| archivedate = 2011-02-10| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Ellis-Petersen, [https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/jul/29/black-cultural-archives-new-centre-brixton "Black Cultural Archives unveils new centre in Brixton"], ''The Guardian'', 29 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Designed by architects [[Pringle Richards Sharratt]], it was named in 2015 as "Building of the Year" in the New London Architecture awards.&lt;ref&gt;Ade Onibada, [http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/black-cultural-archives-named-building-year "Black Cultural Archives Named Building Of The Year"], ''The Voice'', 8 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kate Lloyd, [http://www.timeout.com/london/blog/brixtons-black-cultural-archives-crowned-londons-best-new-building "Brixton's Black Cultural Archives crowned London's Best New Building"], ''Time Out'', 9 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laura Mark, [http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/brixtons-new-black-cultural-archives-named-london-building-of-the-year/8685853.article "Brixton's new Black Cultural Archives named London Building of the Year"], ''Architects' Journal'', 8 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
In 2008, a two-year HLF-funded project called "Documenting the Archive" enabled the cataloguing of BCA's collections of books, objects, and archives, which "document the hidden stories and experiences of Black people either through personal and family journeys or through the rich network of Black-led community organisations", and "celebrate Black achievements "alongside the strong sense of campaigning and resistance to racial inequalities."&lt;ref name=Collections /&gt; BCA's records are also accessible through an online catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calmview.eu/BCA/CalmView/?campaignkw=BCA-Online-Catalogue "Black Cultural Archives Online Catalogue".]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions and projects==
[[File:Black Cultural Archives School Adv Studies History Day 27 Nov 2015.JPG|thumbnail|Black Cultural Archives at the  [[School of Advanced Studies]] History Day, November 2015.]]

BCA's inaugural exhibition was ''Re-imagine: Black Women in Britain'' (24 July–30 November 2014),&lt;ref&gt;[http://bcaheritage.org.uk/programme/reimagine/?mc_cid=f014d553e5&amp;mc_eid=23502cdd27 "Re-imagine: Black Women in Britain"], Black Cultural Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; which chronicled "the often hidden histories of Britain’s black foremothers", including [[Mary Seacole]], [[Mary Prince]], [[Adelaide Hall]], [[Olive Morris]], [[Jessica Huntley (publisher)|Jessica Huntley]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Bim Adewunmi, [https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/oct/06/black-women-in-britain-from-the-romans-to-the-windrush "Black women in Britain – from the Romans to the Windrush"], ''The Guardian'', 6 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016 this exhibition was launched online as part of the Google Cultural Institute.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/exhibit/ngLisy0k2BYFJA?mc_cid=f014d553e5&amp;mc_eid=23502cdd27 "Black women in Britain"], Google Arts &amp; Culture.&lt;/ref&gt;

BCA worked over a period of years with the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] to acquire photographs either by black photographers or that document the lives of black people in Britain, complemented by a range or oral histories.&lt;ref name=V&amp;A&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/s/staying-power-about-the-project/ "Staying Power - About the Project"], Victoria and Albert Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; The resultant exhibition in 2015 was entitled ''Staying Power: Photographs of Black British Experience, 1950s – 1990'' (inspired by the 1984 book by [[Peter Fryer]] ''Staying Power: The History of Black People in Britain'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://futurebrixton.org/staying-power-a-new-exhibition-at-black-cultural-archives/ "Staying Power: A new exhibition at Black Cultural Archives"], Future Brixton.&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition ''Black Georgians: The Shock of the Familiar'', from 9 October 2015 to 4 June 2016, featured the everyday lives of Black people in Britain during the Georgian period (1714–1830), with a special feature by Christy Symington on [[Olaudah Equiano]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bcaheritage.org.uk/programme/exhibitions/black-georgians-the-shock-of-the-familiar/ "Black Georgians: The Shock of the Familiar"], Black Cultural Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZPNWX5cWDE "BBC World on Black Georgians: The Shock of the Familiar"], YouTube video of Lebo Diseko (BBC World) and [[S. I. Martin]] (historian and curator) exploring ''Black Georgians: The Shock of the Familiar''.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 February 2017, BCA received a royal visit from [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], and the [[Duchess of Cornwall]],&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Northridge, [http://bcaheritage.org.uk/the-prince-of-wales-and-duchess-of-cornwall-visit-black-cultural-archives/ "The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall visit Black Cultural Archives"], BCA, 17 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; during which Prince Charles praised the contribution of people from West Indies and Africa in [[World War 1]] and [[World War 2]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/768259/Prince-Charles-praises-contribution-West-Indies-Africa-world-wars-Prince-of-Wales/amp "Prince Charles praises contribution of men from West Indies and Africa in the world wars"], ''[[Daily Express]]'', 16 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Braunschweig''' ({{IPA-de|ˈbʁaʊ̯nʃvaɪ̯k|-|De-Braunschweig.ogg}}; [[Low German]]: ''Brunswiek'' {{IPA-dedia|ˈbrɔˑnsviːk|}}), also called '''Brunswick''' in English,&lt;ref&gt;"Brunswick" (definition 2), ''The American Heritage Dictionary'' p. 245 3d. ed. 1992&lt;/ref&gt; is a city in [[Lower Saxony]], Germany, north of the [[Harz]] mountains at the farthest navigable point of the [[Oker]] River which connects it to the [[North Sea]] via the [[Aller (Germany)|Aller]] and [[Weser]] Rivers. In 2016, it had a population of 250,704.

A powerful and influential centre of commerce in medieval Germany, Braunschweig was a member of the [[Hanseatic League]] from the 13th until the 17th century. It was the capital city of three successive states: the [[Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]] (1269–1432, 1754–1807, and 1813–1814), the [[Duchy of Brunswick]] (1814–1918), and the [[Free State of Brunswick]] (1918–1946).

Today, Braunschweig is the second-largest city in Lower Saxony and a major centre of [[Scientific method|scientific research]] and development.&lt;ref name="Eurostat"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Research_and_innovation_statistics_at_regional_level|title=Research and innovation statistics at regional level |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |year=2014|accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Braunschweig}}
[[File:BurgDankwarderode2016.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dankwarderode Castle]]]]

===Foundation and early history===
The date and circumstances of the town's foundation are unknown. Tradition maintains that Braunschweig was created through the merger of two settlements, one founded by [[Bruno, Duke of Saxony|Brun(o)]], a [[Saxon people|Saxon]] count who died in 880, on one side of the River Oker – the legend gives the year 861 for the foundation – and the other the settlement of a legendary Count Dankward, after whom [[Dankwarderode Castle]] ("Dankward's clearing"), which was reconstructed in the 19th century, is named.&lt;ref&gt;H. Mack (1925): "''Überblick über die Geschichte der Stadt Braunschweig''{{-"}}, in: F. Fuhse (ed.), ''Vaterländische Geschichten und Denkwürdigkeiten der Lande Braunschweig und Hannover, Band 1: Braunschweig'', 3rd edition, Braunschweig: Appelhans Verlag, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="braunschweig.de"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.braunschweig.de/kultur_tourismus/stadtportraet/geschichte/gruendungssage.html |title=Die Ersterwähnung von 'Brunesguik' und die Gründungssage |publisher=Braunschweig.de |date= |accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town's original name of ''Brunswik'' is a combination of the name Bruno and [[Low German language|Low German]] ''wik'' (related to the Latin ''vicus'')&lt;!-- There is no High German equivalent of this --&gt;, a place where merchants rested and stored their goods. The town's name therefore indicates an ideal resting-place, as it lay by a ford across the Oker River. Another explanation of the city's name is that it comes from ''Brand'', or burning, indicating a place which developed after the landscape was cleared through burning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Richard | last = Moderhack | title = Braunschweiger Stadtgeschichte | year = 1997 | language = German | publisher = Wagner| location = Braunschweig| ISBN =3-87884-050-0| pages = 14–15 and 21|ref={{Harvid|Moderhack|1997}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was first mentioned in documents from the St. Magni Church from 1031, which give the city's name as ''Brunesguik''.&lt;ref name="braunschweig.de"/&gt;

[[File:Brunswick cathedral.JPG|thumb|right|Brunswick Cathedral, St. Blasius, with lion statue]]
Up to the 12th century, Braunschweig was ruled by the Saxon noble family of the [[Brunonids]], then, through marriage, it fell to the [[House of Welf]]. In 1142, [[Henry the Lion]] of the House of Welf became duke of [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] and made Braunschweig the capital of his state (which, from 1156 on, also included the [[Duchy of Bavaria]]). He turned Dankwarderode Castle, the residence of the counts of [[County of Brunswick|Brunswick]], into his own ''[[Kaiserpfalz|Pfalz]]'' and developed the city further to represent his authority. Under Henry's rule, the [[Brunswick Cathedral|Cathedral]] of St. Blasius was built and he also had the statue of a lion, his heraldic animal, erected in front of the castle. The [[Brunswick Lion|lion]] subsequently became the city's landmark.

Henry the Lion became so powerful that he dared to refuse military aid to the emperor [[Frederick I Barbarossa]], which led to his banishment in 1182. Henry went into exile in England. He had previously established ties to the English crown in 1168, through his marriage to King [[Henry II of England]]'s daughter [[Matilda of England, Duchess of Saxony|Matilda]], sister of [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.germany.travel/en/ms/royal-heritage/where-to-go/braunschweig.html |title=The Lion City of Brunswick (Braunschweig) |publisher=Germany.travel |date= |accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his son [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto]], who could regain influence and was eventually crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]], continued to foster the city's development.

During the [[Middle Ages]], Braunschweig was an important center of trade, one of the economic and political centers in Northern Europe and a member of the Hanseatic League from the 13th century to the middle of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moderhack|1997|pp=50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the year 1600, Braunschweig was the seventh largest city in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Camerer | last2 = Garzmann | last3 = Pingel | last4 = Schuegraf | title = Braunschweiger Stadtlexikon | edition = 4th | year = 1996 | language = German | publisher = | page = 66|ref={{Harvid|Camerer|Garzmann|Pingel|Schuegraf|1996}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although formally one of the residences of the rulers of the [[Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg]], a constituent state of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], Braunschweig was ''[[de facto]]'' ruled independently by a powerful class of [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patricians]] and the [[guild]]s throughout much of the [[Late Middle Ages]] and the [[Early modern period]]. Because of the growing power of Braunschweig's [[Medieval bourgeoisie|burghers]], the [[Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Princes of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]], who ruled over one of the subdivisions of Brunswick-Lüneburg, finally moved their ''[[Residenz]]'' out of the city and to the nearby town of [[Wolfenbüttel]] in 1432.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moderhack|1997|pp=60–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Princes of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel didn't regain control over the city until the late 17th century, when [[Rudolph Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]], took the city by siege.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moderhack|1997|pp=119–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century Braunschweig was not only a political, but also a cultural centre. Influenced by the philosophy of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], dukes like [[Anthony Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Anthony Ulrich]] and [[Charles I, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Charles I]] became patrons of the arts and sciences. In 1745 Charles I founded the ''Collegium Carolinum'', predecessor of the [[Braunschweig University of Technology]], and in 1753 he moved the ducal residence back to Braunschweig. With this he attracted poets and thinkers such as [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], [[Johann Anton Leisewitz|Leisewitz]], and [[Jakob Mauvillon]] to his court and the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moderhack|1997|pp=136–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Emilia Galotti]]'' by Lessing and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' were performed for the first time in Braunschweig.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Camerer|Garzmann|Pingel|Schuegraf|1996|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1806, the city was captured by the [[France|French]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and became part of the short-lived [[Napoleon]]ic [[Kingdom of Westphalia]] in 1807. The exiled duke [[Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Frederick William]] raised a volunteer corps, the [[Black Brunswickers]], who fought the French in several battles.&lt;ref name="Jarck1"&gt;{{cite book | editor1 = Horst-Rüdiger Jarck | editor2 = Günter Scheel | title = Braunschweigisches Biographisches Lexikon – 19. und 20.

After the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, Braunschweig was made capital of the reestablished independent [[Duchy of Brunswick]], later a constituent state of the [[German Empire]] from 1871. In the aftermath of the [[July Revolution]] in 1830, in Brunswick duke [[Charles II, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Charles II]] was forced to abdicate. His [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] governing style had previously alienated the nobility and [[bourgeoisie]], while the lower classes were disaffected by the bad economic situation. During the night of 7–8 September 1830, the [[Brunswick Palace|ducal palace]] in Braunschweig was stormed by an angry mob, set on fire, and destroyed completely.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Schildt (2000): ''Von der Restauration zur Reichsgründungszeit'', in Horst-Rüdiger Jarck / Gerhard Schildt (eds.), ''Die Braunschweigische Landesgeschichte.

During William's reign, liberal reforms were made and Brunswick's parliament was strengthened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schildt|2000|pp=772–777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century, [[industrialisation]] caused a rapid growth of population in the city, eventually causing Braunschweig to be for the first time significantly enlarged beyond its medieval [[Defensive wall|fortifications]] and the River Oker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.braunschweig.de/leben/stadtportraet/stadtteile/oestl_ringgebiet/geschichte.html |title=Geschichte |publisher=Braunschweig.de |date= |accessdate=2015-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 December 1838, the first section of the [[Brunswick–Bad Harzburg railway]] line connecting Braunschweig and Wolfenbüttel opened as the first railway line in Northern Germany, operated by the [[Duchy of Brunswick State Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;E.

On 8 November 1918, at the end of [[World War I]], a [[socialist]] [[workers' council]] forced Duke [[Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick|Ernest Augustus]] to abdicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moderhack|1997|pp=193–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Bernd | last = Rother | title = Die Sozialdemokratie im Land Braunschweig 1918 bis 1933 | year = 1990 | language = German | publisher = Verlag J.

Jahrtausendrückblick einer Region'', Braunschweig: Appelhans Verlag, pp. 935–943. {{ISBN|3-930292-28-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An SPD-led government was subsequently established; in December 1921 a new [[constitution]] was approved for the [[Free State of Brunswick]], now a [[parliamentary republic]] within the [[Weimar Republic]], again with Braunschweig as its capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moderhack|1997|pp=194–195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Landtag election of 1930, Brunswick became the second state in Germany where the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] participated in government, when the [[Nazi Party|National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (NSDAP) formed a coalition government with several conservative and right-wing parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rother|1990|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the support of [[Dietrich Klagges]], Brunswick's minister of the interior, the NSDAP organized a large [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] rally in Braunschweig. On 17–18 October 1931, 100,000 SA stormtroopers marched through the city, street fights between Nazis, socialists and communists left several dead or injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rother|1990|p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 February 1932, the state of Brunswick granted [[Adolf Hitler]] German citizenship to allow him to run in the [[German presidential election, 1932|1932 German presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rother|1990|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Braunschweig, Nazis carried out several attacks on political enemies, with the acquiescence of the state government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rother|1990|pp=247–248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Nazi seizure of power]] in 1933, several state institutions were placed in Braunschweig, including the ''[[Luftfahrtforschungsanstalt]]'' in [[Völkenrode]], the [[Hitler Youth]] [[Academy for Youth Leadership]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vernetztes-gedaechtnis.de/akademie.htm |title=Akademie für Jugendführung |publisher=Vernetztes-gedaechtnis.de |accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Waffen-SS|SS]]-[[Junker Schools|Junkerschule Braunschweig]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vernetztes-gedaechtnis.de/schloss.htm |title=Braunschweiger Schloss / SS-Junkerschule |publisher=Vernetztes-gedaechtnis.de |accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Reichswerke Hermann Göring]] in [[Salzgitter]] and the [[Wolfsburg|Stadt des KdF-Wagens]], as well as several factories in the city itself (including [[Büssing]] and the [[Volkswagenwerk Braunschweig]]), the Braunschweig region became one of the centres of the German [[arms industry]].&lt;ref&gt;Jörg Leuschner (2008): ''Die Wirtschaft des Braunschweigischen Landes im Dritten Reich (1933–1939)'', in: Jörg Leuschner / Karl Heinrich Kaufhold / Claudia Märtl (eds.), ''Die Wirtschafts- und Sozialgeschichte des Braunschweigischen Landes vom Mittelalter bis zur Gegenwart'', vol. 3, Hildesheim: Georg Olms Verlag, pp. 468–522. {{ISBN|978-3-487-13599-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], Braunschweig was an ''Untergebiet Hauptquartier'' ("Sub-Area Headquarters") of Wehrkreis XI ("[[Military district (Germany)|Military District XI]]"),&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Lent (2000): ''Kriegsgeschehen und Verluste im Zweiten Weltkrieg'', in: Horst-Rüdiger Jarck / Gerhard Schildt (eds.), ''Die Braunschweigische Landesgeschichte. Jahrtausendrückblick einer Region'', Braunschweig: Appelhans Verlag, p. 1026. {{ISBN|3-930292-28-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was the garrison city of the [[31st Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|31st Infantry Division]] that took part in the invasions of Poland, Belgium, and France, largely being destroyed during its retreat following the invasion of Russia.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} In this period, thousands of [[Eastern workers]] were brought to the city as [[forced labor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1 = Fiedler, Gudrun | editor2 = Ludewig, Hans-Ulrich | title = Zwangsarbeit und Kriegswirtschaft im Lande Braunschweig 1939–1945 | year = 2003 | language = German | publisher = Appelhans Verlag|location= Braunschweig|ISBN=3-930292-78-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1943–1945 period at least 360 children taken away from such workers died in the ''[[Ausländerkinder-Pflegestätte|Entbindungsheim für Ostarbeiterinnen]]'' ("Maternity Ward for Eastern Workers").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vernetztes-gedaechtnis.de/entbind.htm |title=Entbindungsheim für Ostarbeiterinnen |publisher=Vernetztes-gedaechtnis.de |accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, a subcamp of the concentration camp Neuengamme was established in Braunschweig.  Hundreds of prisoners, mostly Jews, lived in brutal conditions and hundreds died from hunger, disease, and overwork.  [[Piera Sonnino]], an Italian author, writes of her imprisonment in that camp in her book, ''This Has Happened'', published in English in 2006 by MacMillan Palgrave.

The [[Bombing of Braunschweig in World War II|Anglo-American air raid]] on October 15, 1944, destroyed most of the city's churches, and the ''Altstadt'' (old town), the largest homogeneous ensemble of half-timbered houses in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/braunschweig-steeped-in-history/a-1474038 |title=Braunschweig: Steeped in History |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=2005-03-02|accessdate=2015-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's cathedral, which had been converted to a ''Nationale Weihestätte'' (national shrine) by the Nazi government, still stood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vernetztes-gedaechtnis.de/dom.htm |title=Dom - Überblick |publisher=Vernetztes-gedaechtnis.de |date= |accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postwar period to the 21st century===
Small sections of the city survived Allied bombing, so remain to represent its distinctive architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ndr.de/ratgeber/reise/braunschweiger_land/Die-moderne-Loewenstadt,braunschweig436.html |title=Braunschweig zwischen Tradition und Moderne |publisher=[[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]] |date=2015-01-29 |accessdate=2015-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cathedral was restored to its function as a [[Protestant]] church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.braunschweigerdom.de/dom/layout_storage/ueberdom_geschichte.php |title=Die wechselvolle Geschichte des Braunschweiger Doms |publisher=braunschweigerdom.de |date= |accessdate=2015-07-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923194314/http://www.braunschweigerdom.de/dom/layout_storage/ueberdom_geschichte.php |archive-date=2015-09-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politically, after the war, the Free State of Brunswick was dissolved by the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|Allied occupying authorities]], Braunschweig ceased to be a capital, and most of its lands were incorporated in the newly formed state of [[Lower Saxony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Lower-Saxony |title=Lower Saxony |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |date= |accessdate=2015-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Cold War]], Braunschweig, then part of [[West Germany]], suffered economically due to its proximity to the [[Iron Curtain]]. The city lost its historically strong economic ties to what was then [[East Germany]]; for decades, economic growth remained below and unemployment stayed above the West German average.&lt;ref&gt;Gudrun Fiedler / Norman-Mathias Pingel (2008): ''Vom Nachkriegsboom in den Strukturwandel. Die Wirtschaft der Landes-Region Braunschweig nach 1945'', in: Jörg Leuschner / Karl Heinrich Kaufhold / Claudia Märtl (eds.), ''Die Wirtschafts- und Sozialgeschichte des Braunschweigischen Landes vom Mittelalter bis zur Gegenwart'', vol. 3, Hildesheim: Georg Olms Verlag, pp. 586–588. {{ISBN|978-3-487-13599-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 February 1974, as part of a district reform in Lower Saxony, the [[Landkreis|rural district]] of [[Braunschweig (district)|Braunschweig]], which had surrounded the city, was disestablished. The major part of the former district was incorporated into the city of Braunschweig, increasing its population by roughly 52,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.braunschweig.de/kultur_tourismus/stadtportraet/geschichte/stadtchronik.html?id4=1974&amp;seite=3 |title=Stadtchronik Braunschweig |publisher=Braunschweig.de |date= |accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, efforts increased to reconstruct historic buildings that had been destroyed in the air raid.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The façade of the ''[[Brunswick Palace|Braunschweiger Schloss]]'' was rebuilt, and buildings such as the ''Alte Waage'' (originally built in 1534) now stand again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.braunschweig.de/leben/stadtportraet/geschichte/schlossgeschichte.html |title=Die Geschichte des Braunschweiger Schlosses |publisher=braunschweig.de |language=German |accessdate=2015-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justus Herrenberger (1993): ''Die Baustelle "Alte Waage" in Braunschweig'', in: ''Jahrbuch 1992 der Braunschweigischen Wissenschaftlichen Gesellschaft'', Göttingen: Verlag Erich Goltze KG, pp. 29-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main sights==
*The ''Burgplatz'' (Castle Square), comprising a group of buildings of great historical and cultural significance: the [[Brunswick Cathedral|Cathedral]] ([[Saint Blaise|St Blasius]], built at the end of the 12th century), the ''Burg Dankwarderode'' (Dankwarderode Castle) (a 19th-century reconstruction of the old castle of Henry the Lion), the [[Neo-Gothic]] Town Hall (built in 1893–1900), as well as some picturesque [[timber framing|half-timbered houses]], such as the ''Gildehaus'' (Guild House), today the seat of the Craftsman's Association. In the centre of the square stands a copy of the ''[[Brunswick Lion|Burglöwe]]'' (Brunswick Lion), a [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] statue of a Lion, cast in bronze in 1166. The original statue can be seen in the museum of Dankwarderode Castle. Today the lion has become the true symbol of Braunschweig.

*The ''Magniviertel'' ([[Magnus of Anagni|St Magnus]]' Quarter), a remainder of ancient Braunschweig, lined with cobblestoned streets, little shops and cafés, centred around the 13th-century ''Magnikirche'' (St Magnus' Church). Here is also the ''Rizzi-Haus'', a highly distinctive, cartoonish office building designed by architect [[James Rizzi]] for the [[Expo 2000]].
*The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] ''Andreaskirche'' (Church of [[Saint Andrew]]), built mainly between the 13th and 16th centuries with stained glass by [[Charles Crodel]].

*[[Riddagshausen Abbey]] (German: ''Kloster Riddagshausen''), a former [[Cistercian]] monastery, with the surrounding [[nature reserve]] and [[arboretum]]. The nature reserve ''Riddagshäuser Teiche'' is designated as [[Important Bird Area]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/sitefactsheet.php?id=3496 |title=Birdlife Data Zone |publisher=Birdlife.org |date= |accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Special Protection Area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eunis.eea.europa.eu/sites/130225 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130107095744/http://eunis.eea.europa.eu/sites/130225 |archivedate=2013-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
[[File:Ringerbrunnen Braunschweig.jpg|thumb|right|Pedestrian zone in the city centre]]
Braunschweig's city centre is mostly a car-free [[pedestrian zone]].

===Automobile===
Two main autobahns serve Braunschweig, the [[Bundesautobahn 2|A2]] ([[Berlin]]—[[Hanover]]—[[Dortmund]]) and the [[Bundesautobahn 39|A39]] ([[Salzgitter]]—[[Wolfsburg]]). City roads are generally wide, built after [[World War II]] to support the anticipated use of the automobile. There are several car parks in the city.

===Bicycle===
Many residents travel around town by bicycle using an extensive system of bicycle-only lanes. The main train station includes a bicycle parking area.

===Train===
The city is on the main rail line between [[Frankfurt]] and Berlin. [[Deutsche Bahn]] (German Railways) serves the city with local, inter-city and high-speed [[InterCityExpress]] (ICE) trains, with frequent stops at [[Braunschweig Central Station]] (German: ''Braunschweig Hauptbahnhof'').&lt;ref&gt;For a history of rail transport in the state, see Holtge, Dieter. "Braunschweig's Eisenbahnen und Strassenbahnen." (1972).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tram and bus===
[[File:100 6771 0756 Rathaus.jpg|thumb|Tram in Braunschweig]]
The [[Trams in Braunschweig|Braunschweig tramway network]] is an inexpensive and extensive {{convert|35|km|0|abbr=on}} long electric [[tram]]way system. First opened in 1897, it has been modernized, including a {{convert|3.2|km|abbr=on}} extension in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightrailnow.org/news/n_newslog2007q1.htm |title=Braunschweig (Germany): New light rail tram line to suburbs reverses Transit Holocaust, February 13, 2007 |publisher=Light Rail Now |accessdate=April 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network has an {{RailGauge|1100mm}} [[Track gauge|gauge]], unique for a European railway or tramway network. However, it is being supplemented in stages by a third rail, to allow future joint working with the {{RailGauge|sg|allk=on}} main railway network.

The municipally owned [[Braunschweiger Verkehrs-AG]] currently operates five tram lines and several [[bus]] lines. The tram lines are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verkehr-bs.de/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads/Liniennetzplan/Liniennetzplan_7.1.2016/Linienverzeichnis_2016_DINA4_x1a_view.pdf |format=PDF |title=Tram and bus lines in Braunschweig |publisher=verkehr-bs.de |accessdate=29 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307160252/http://www.verkehr-bs.de/fileadmin/user_upload/downloads/Liniennetzplan/Liniennetzplan_7.1.2016/Linienverzeichnis_2016_DINA4_x1a_view.pdf |archivedate=7 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
{{see also | Brunswick (disambiguation)}}

Many other geographical locations around the world are named Brunswick, after the historical English name of Braunschweig. Between 1714 and 1837, the [[House of Hanover]] ruled Great Britain in [[personal union]] with the [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg (Hanover)]]. The House of Hanover was formally known as the [[House of Welf|House of Brunswick-Lüneburg]], Hanover line.&lt;ref name="heraldica_hanover"&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal Arms of Britain|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/royalarm.htm|website=Heraldica|accessdate=10 May 2016|quote=The House of Brunswick Luneburg being one of the most illustrious and most ancient in Europe, the Hanoverian branch having filled for more than a century one of the most distinguished thrones, its possessions being among the most considerable in Germany;}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many places in [[British Empire|the British colonies]] were named after Brunswick, such as the province of [[New Brunswick]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1444070816858 |title=New Brunswick - Anthems and Symbols - Canadian Identity |publisher=Pch.gc.ca |date=2013-08-28 |accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically, the city of Braunschweig was not ruled by the Hanoverians while its name was being given to other Brunswicks around the world. Starting in 1269, the [[Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg]] underwent a series of divisions and mergers, with parts of the territory being transferred between various branches of the family. The city of Braunschweig went to the senior branch of the house, the [[List of rulers of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Wolfenbüttel line]], while [[Lüneburg]] eventually ended up with the [[House of Hanover|Hanover line]]. Although the territory had been split, all branches of the family continued to style themselves as the House of Brunswick-Lüneburg.&lt;ref name="heraldica_hanover"/&gt;&lt;ref name="riedesel_1868"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riedesel|first1=Friedrich Adolf|translator-last=Stone|translator-first=William L.|editor-last=von Eelking|editor-first=Max|title=Memoirs, and Letters and Journals, of Major General Riedesel During His Residence in America|volume=1|page=29|publisher=J. Munsell|location=Albany|year=1868|quote=I remain ever, Your affectionate Charles, Duke of Brunswick and Lüneburg. Brunswick, February 14, 1776. To Colonel Riedesel.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884, the senior branch of the House of Welf became extinct. The Hanover line, being the last surviving line of the family, subsequently held the throne of the Duchy of Brunswick from November 1913 until November 1918.

==Government offices==
The offices of the [[Luftfahrt-Bundesamt]] (LBA, "Federal Aviation Office") and the [[German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation]] (BFU) are located in Braunschweig.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfu-web.de/cln_007/nn_228094/EN/The_20BFU/Location/location__node.html?__nnn=true ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219051419/http://www.bfu-web.de/cln_007/nn_228094/EN/The_20BFU/Location/location__node.html?__nnn=true |date=February 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Braunschweig was one of the centres of the [[industrialization]] in Northern Germany. During the 19th and early 20th century the [[canning]] and [[railroad]] industries and the [[sugar]] production were of great importance for Braunschweig's economy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.braunschweig.de/kultur_tourismus/stadtportraet/geschichte/industrieaufbruch.html |title=Industrieller Aufbruch |publisher=Braunschweig.de |date= |accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but eventually other branches such as the [[automotive industry]] became more important, while especially the canning industry began to vanish from the city after the end of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.braunschweig.de/kultur_tourismus/stadtportraet/geschichte/nachkriegszeit.html |title=Nachkriegszeit |publisher=Braunschweig.de |date= |accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defunct truck and bus manufacturer [[Büssing]] was headquartered in Braunschweig.

===Music and dance===
The ''[[Braunschweig Classix Festival]]'' was an annual classical music festival. It is the largest promoter of classical music in the region and one of the most prominent music festivals in [[Lower Saxony]].

From 2001 to 2009, and again since 2013, the annual finals of the international [[breakdance]] competition [[Battle of the Year]] have been held at the [[Volkswagen Halle]] in Braunschweig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.braunbattleoftheyear.com/about.html |title=About BOTY |accessdate=27 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/628oflRIh?url=http://www.braunbattleoftheyear.com/about.html |archivedate=2 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Braunschweig's major local [[Association football|football]] team is [[Eintracht Braunschweig]]. Founded in 1895, Eintracht Braunschweig can look back on a long and chequered history. Eintracht Braunschweig won the [[List of German football champions|German football championship]] in 1967, and currently plays in the [[3. Bundesliga]], the third tier of German football, and attracts a large number of supporters. Braunschweig was also arguably the city in which the first ever game of football in Germany took place. The game had been brought to Germany by the local school teacher [[Konrad Koch]], also the first to write down a German version of the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|rules of football]],&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;However, Koch's original German version of the rules of football, published in 1875, still resembled [[Rugby football]]—the unmodified rules of [[The Football Association]] were not commonly used in Germany before the 1900s.&lt;/ref&gt; who organized the first match between pupils from his school ''Martino-Katharineum'' in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.braunschweig.de/kultur_tourismus/veranstaltungen/medien-bsm/Internet_Die_Wiege_des_Fussballs_090910.pdf | title = Die Wiege des Fußballs stand in Braunschweig| language = German | accessdate = 8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 German drama film [[Lessons of a Dream]] is based on Koch.

Eintracht Braunschweig also fields a successful women's [[field hockey]] team that claimed nine national championship titles between 1965 and 1978. In the past, the club also had first or second tier teams in the sports of [[ice hockey]], [[field handball]], and [[water polo]].

The [[New Yorker Lions]] (formerly Braunschweig Lions) are the city's [[American football]] team, winning a record number of eleven [[German Bowl]] titles, as well as five [[Eurobowl]]s (a shared record).

The city's professional [[basketball]] team, the [[Basketball Löwen Braunschweig]], plays in the [[Basketball Bundesliga]], the highest level in Germany. The Löwen's predecessor [[SG Braunschweig]] had previously played in the Bundesliga as well. Eintracht Braunschweig's women's basketball team plays in the [[:de:2. Damen-Basketball-Bundesliga|2. Damen-Basketball-Bundesliga]], the second tier of women's basketball in Germany.

In [[handball]], [[MTV Braunschweig]], the city's oldest sports club (founded in 1847), plays in the semi-professional [[:de:3. Liga (Handball)|3. Liga]].

Other sports clubs from Braunschweig that play or have played at the [[Bundesliga (disambiguation)|Bundesliga]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; or [[2nd Bundesliga (disambiguation)|2nd Bundesliga]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; level include [[:de:Braunschweig Spot Up 89ers|Spot Up 89ers]] ([[baseball]]), [[:de:Braunschweiger THC|Braunschweiger THC]] (field hockey), [[:de:FC Braunschweig|SV Süd Braunschweig]] (handball), [[Rugby-Welfen Braunschweig]] ([[rugby union]]), and [[:de:USC Braunschweig|USC Braunschweig]] ([[volleyball]]).

Annual sporting events held in Braunschweig include the international [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] tournament ''Löwen Classics'', ''Rund um den Elm'', Germany's oldest [[Road bicycle racing|road bicycle race]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Kurt | last = Hoffmeister | title = Zeitreise durch die Braunschweiger Sportgeschichte: 180 Jahre Turnen und Sport in Braunschweig | year = 2010 | language = German | publisher = | page = 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the professional [[tennis]] tournament ''[[Sparkassen Open]]''.

The '''British Mandate for Palestine''' (valid 29 September 1923 – 15 May 1948), also known as the '''Mandate for Palestine''' or the '''Palestine Mandate''', was a "Class A" [[League of Nations mandate]] for the territories of [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], in which the [[Balfour Declaration]]'s "national home for the Jewish people" was to be established, and [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]], a separate Arab Emirate, both of which were conceded by the Ottoman Empire following [[World War I]].

The draft was formally confirmed by the Council of the [[League of Nations]] on 24 July 1922 and came into effect on 29 September 1923, with the [[United Kingdom]] as the administering mandatory.

The document was based on the principles contained in Article 22 of the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]] of 28 June 1919 and of the [[San Remo conference#Resolutions|San Remo Resolution]] of 25 April 1920, which embodied decisions made after World War I at the [[San Remo conference]], where the [[Allies of World War I|Supreme Council of the Principal Allied Powers]] was reconvened. The objective of the system of Class A mandates was to administer parts of the defunct [[Ottoman Empire]], which had been in control of the Middle East since the 16th century, "until such time as they are able to stand alone". The approximate northern border with the [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|French Mandate]] was agreed upon in the [[Paulet–Newcombe Agreement]] of 23 December 1920.

Transjordan was included in the mandate following a March 1921 [[Cairo Conference (1921)|conference]] at which it was agreed that [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah bin Hussein]] would administer the territory under the auspices of the Palestine Mandate. After the war it had been administered from Damascus by a joint Arab-British military administration, headed by Abdullah's younger brother Faisal, who was subsequently proclaimed King. Transjordan became a [[no man's land]] after the French removed Faisal in the July 1920 [[Battle of Maysalun]];{{sfn|Bentwich|1932|p=51}} during which period the British chose to avoid any definite connection with Palestine.{{sfn|Karsh|Karsh|2001|p=317}}  This was given legal form on 21 March 1921 when the British introduced Article 25 into the Palestine Mandate, which included Transjordan within the scope and allowed the Mandatory there "to postpone or withhold application of such provisions of this mandate as he may consider inapplicable to the existing local conditions." On 16 September 1922, Article 25 was implemented via the [[Trans-Jordan memorandum]],{{sfn|Palestine Royal Commission|1937}} which established a separate "Administration of Trans-Jordan" for the application of the Mandate, under the general supervision of Great Britain. Transjordan became largely autonomous under British tutelage according to an agreement of 20 February 1928, and fully independent under a [[Treaty of London (1946)|treaty with Britain of 22 March 1946]].

On 29 November 1947, the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] was passed, envisaging the creation of separate Jewish and Arab states operating under economic union with Jerusalem being transferred to UN trusteeship. Two weeks later, Colonial Secretary [[Arthur Creech Jones]] announced that the British Mandate would terminate on 15 May 1948. On the last day of the Mandate, the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|creation of the State of Israel]] was proclaimed, and the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] began.

===Balfour Declaration===
{{main|Balfour Declaration}}{{Refimprove section|date=September 2018}}
Immediately following their declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire in November 1914, the [[British War Cabinet]] began to consider the future of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], at the time an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] region with a minority Jewish population ([[Demographic history of Palestine (region)#Late Ottoman period|around 3–5% of the total]]). By late 1917, in the lead up to the Balfour Declaration, the wider war had reached a stalemate, with two of [[Allies of World War I|Britain's allies]] not fully engaged: the United States had yet to suffer a casualty, and the Russians were in the midst of a revolution. A [[Stalemate in Southern Palestine|stalemate in southern Palestine]] was broken by the [[Battle of Beersheba (1917)|Battle of Beersheba]] on 31 October 1917. The release of the Balfour Declaration was authorised by 31 October; the preceding Cabinet discussion had referenced perceived propaganda benefits amongst the worldwide Jewish community for the Allied war effort.{{cn|date=August 2018}} 

On 2 November 1917, during [[World War I]], the British government issued the [[Balfour Declaration]], a public statement announcing support for the establishment of a  "national home for the [[Jewish]] people" in Palestine. The opening words of the declaration represented the first public expression of support for Zionism by a major political power. The term "national home" had no precedent in international law, and was intentionally vague as to whether a [[Jewish state]] was contemplated. The intended boundaries of Palestine were not specified, and the British government later confirmed that the words "in Palestine" meant that the Jewish national home was not intended to cover all of Palestine. The second half of the declaration was added to satisfy opponents of the policy, who had claimed that it would otherwise prejudice the position of the local population of Palestine and encourage [[antisemitism]] worldwide by "stamping the Jews as strangers in their native lands".  The declaration called for safeguarding the civil and religious rights for the [[Palestinian Arabs]], who composed the [[Demographic history of Palestine (region)|vast majority of the local population]], and also the rights of the Jewish communities in other countries outside of Palestine.{{cn|date=August 2018}} 

Controversy remains over a number of areas, such as whether the declaration contradicted earlier promises the British made to [[Hussein ibn Ali al-Hashimi|the Sharif of Mecca]] in the [[McMahon–Hussein Correspondence|McMahon–Hussein correspondence]], as well as the [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]].{{cn|date=August 2018}}

===League of Nations mandates===
{{main| League of Nations mandate}}

The mandate system was established under Article 22 of the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]], entered into on 28 June 1919 as the first twenty-six articles of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The mandates were to act as legal instruments containing the internationally agreed-upon terms for administering certain post-[[World War I]] territories on behalf of the [[League of Nations]]. These were of the nature of both a treaty and a constitution, which contained [[Minority Treaties|minority rights clauses]] that provided for the rights of petition and adjudication by the International Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970)|journal=International Court of Justice|date=21 June 1971|pages=28–32|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/53/5595.pdf|accessdate=28 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106103217/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/53/5595.pdf|archivedate=6 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 22 was written two months before the signing of the peace treaty, before it was known what communities, peoples, or territories were related to sub-paragraphs 4, 5, and 6. The treaty was signed, and the peace conference had been adjourned, before a formal decision was made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=goto&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1919Parisv13&amp;isize=M&amp;submit=Go+to+page&amp;page=94, Papers relating to the foreign relations of the United States, The Paris Peace Conference, 1919]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two governing principles formed the core of the Mandate System, being non-annexation of the territory and its administration as a "sacred trust of civilisation" to develop the territory for the benefit of its native people.&lt;ref&gt;Matz, 2005, p.70-71, "Primarily, two elements formed the core of the Mandate System, the principle of non-annexation of the territory on the one hand and its administration as a "sacred trust of civilisation" on the other... The principle of administration as a "sacred trust of civilisation" was designed to prevent a practice of imperial exploitation of the mandated territory in contrast to former colonial habits. Instead, the Mandatory's administration should assist in developing the territory for the well-being of its native people."&lt;/ref&gt; The mandates were fundamentally different from the [[protectorate]]s in that the Mandatory power undertook obligations to the inhabitants of the territory and to the League of Nations. The process of establishing the mandates consisted of two phases: the formal removal of [[sovereignty]] of the state previously controlling the territory, followed by the transfer of mandatory powers to individual states among the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]]. Three steps were required to establish a mandate: (1) The Principal Allied and Associated Powers confer a mandate on one of their number or on a third power; (2) the principal powers officially notify the council of the League of Nations that a certain power has been appointed mandatory for such a certain defined territory; and (3) the council of the League of Nations takes official cognisance of the appointment of the mandatory power and informs the latter that it [the council] considers it as invested with the mandate, and at the same time notifies it of the terms of the mandate, after ascertaining whether they are in conformance with the provisions of the covenant."&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: Temperley, History of the Paris Peace Conference, Vol VI, pp. 505–506; League of Nations, The Mandates System (official publication of 1945); Hill, Mandates, Dependencies and Trusteeship, pp. 133ff.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Council of the League of Nations, meeting of August 1920:&lt;ref&gt;(pp. 109–110)&lt;/ref&gt;  "draft mandates adopted by the Allied and Associated Powers would not be definitive until they had been considered and approved by the League ... the legal title held by the mandatory Power must be a double one: one conferred by the Principal Powers and the other conferred by the League of Nations."&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;Quincy Wright, Mandates under the League of Nations, Univ.Chicago Press, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt;

A confidential appendix to the report of the 1919 [[King-Crane Commission]] observed that "The Jews are distinctly for Britain as mandatory power, because of the Balfour declaration' and that the French 'resent the payment by the English to the Emir Faisal of a large monthly subsidy, which they claim covers a multitude of bribes, and enables the British to stand off and show clean hands while Arab agents do dirty work in their interest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/docs/king-crane/appendix.html|title=King-Crane Commission Report: Confidential Appendix|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Faisal-Weizmann Agreement]] called for British mediation of any disputes. It also called for the establishment of borders, after the Versailles peace conference, by a commission to be formed for the purpose. The [[World Zionist Organization]] later submitted to the peace conference a proposed [[:Image:Faisal-Weizmann map.png|map of the territory]] that did not include the area east of the [[Hedjaz Railway]], including most of [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]].

In a meeting at [[Deauville]] in 1919, [[David Lloyd George]] of the UK and [[Georges Clemenceau]] of France finalised the Anglo-French Settlement of 1–4 December 1918. The new agreement allocated Palestine and the [[Mosul Province, Ottoman Empire|Vilayet of Mosul]] to the British in exchange for British support of French influence in [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]].{{sfn|Hughes|2013|p=122}}{{efn| group=lower-roman| Pappé suggests that the French concessions were made to guarantee British support for French aims at the post-war peace conference concerning Germany and Europe.{{sfn|Pappé|1994|pp= 3–5}}}}

At the Paris Peace Conference, Prime Minister Lloyd George told Georges Clemenceau and the other allies that the McMahon-Hussein correspondence was a treaty obligation. He explained that the agreement with Hussein had actually been the basis for the Sykes-Picot Agreement, and that the French could not use the proposed League Of Nations Mandate system to break the terms of the agreement. He pointed out that the French had agreed not to occupy the area of the independent Arab state, or confederation of states, with their military forces, including the areas of Damascus, [[Homs]], [[Hama]], and [[Aleppo]]. British Foreign Secretary [[Arthur Balfour]] (later Lord Balfour) and U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] were present at the meeting.{{sfn| Council of Four|1919|p=1-10}}

The preamble of the Mandate document states that the Mandate is granted to Britain "for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations". That article, which concerns entrusting "tutelage" of colonies formerly under German and Turkish sovereignty to "advanced nations" with specific regard to "[c]ommunities formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire" that they "have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognised subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone."&lt;ref&gt;{{wikisource-inline|Covenant of the League of Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the period of the Mandate, [[Palestine (region)|Palestinian]] Arab leaders cited this as proving their assertion that the British were obliged under the terms of the Mandate to facilitate the eventual creation of an independent Arab state in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/548E6E5758E89588852575A0004F1054 |title=THE INTERNATIONAL STATUS OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE, III.The Palestinian People Under the Mandate, Protests by the Palestinian People|date=1 January 1980|publisher= United Nations Division for Palestinian Rights (DPR) |access-date=6 August 2017|quote= These demands were to remain constant throughout the Mandate period }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The open negotiations began at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], continued at the [[Conference of London (February 1920)|Conference of London]] and took definite shape only after the [[San Remo conference]] in April 1920. There the Allied Supreme Council granted the mandates for Palestine and Mesopotamia to Britain,{{sfn|Biger|2004|p= 173}} and those for Syria and Lebanon to France. In August 1920, this was officially acknowledged in the [[Treaty of Sèvres]]. Both Zionist and Arab representatives attended the conference, where they signed the [[Faisal–Weizmann Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mideastweb.org/feisweiz.htm|title=MidEast Web - Feisal-Weizmann Agreement|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement was never implemented.

The [[San Remo conference]]&lt;ref name="San Remo Convention"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/San_Remo_Convention|title=San Remo Convention - World War I Document Archive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; assigned the mandate for Palestine to the United Kingdom under Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. The Allies also decided to make the UK responsible for putting into effect its own [[Balfour Declaration, 1917|Balfour Declaration]] of 1917. France required the continuation of its religious protectorate in Palestine but Italy and Great Britain opposed it. France lost the religious protectorate but thanks to the Holy See continued to enjoy liturgical honors in Mandatory Palestine until 1924 when the honours were abolished (see: [[Protectorate of the Holy See]]).&lt;ref&gt;The Vatican and Zionism: Conflict in the Holy Land, 1895–1925, Sergio I. Minerbi, Oxford University Press, USA, 1990, {{ISBN|0-19-505892-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boundaries of the mandated territories at San Remo were not precisely defined.{{sfn|Biger|2004|p= 173}} [[Chaim Weizmann]] subsequently reported to his [[World Zionist Organization|WZO]] colleagues in London in May 1920:&lt;blockquote&gt;"There are still important details outstanding, such as the actual terms of the mandate and the question of the boundaries in Palestine. There is the delimitation of the boundary between French Syria and Palestine, which will constitute the northern frontier and the eastern line of demarcation, adjoining Arab Syria. The latter is not likely to be fixed until the Emir Faisal attends the Peace Conference, probably in Paris."&lt;ref&gt;'Zionist Aspirations: Dr Weizmann on the Future of Palestine', ''The Times'', Saturday, 8 May 1920, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Drafting==
[[File:Draft mandates for Mesopotamia and Palestine.jpg|thumb|upright=1|left|The draft mandate, published at Cmd. 1176, was submitted by Lord Balfour, then [[Lord President of the Council]], on 7 December 1920 to the [[List of leaders of the League of Nations|Secretariat General of the League of Nations]] for the approval of the [[Organisation of the League of Nations#Council|Council of the League of Nations.]].

{{wikisource|Statement of the Zionist Organization regarding Palestine, 1919}}

Intended mandatory powers were required to submit written statements during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] to the League of Nations proposing the rules of administration in the mandated areas.{{sfn|McTague|1980|p=282}} Drafting discussions began in July 1919, before the mandate was formally awarded in April 1920, because it had become clear that Britain was the favored power.{{efn| group=lower-roman| McTague writes: "Since  the  British  army  under  General  Edmund  Allenby  had  conquered the Holy Land,  and  since  the  British  announcement  of  the  Balfour  Declaration had  demonstrated  her  keen  interest  in the future  of  the  country,  it  was  a foregone  conclusion  that  the  Allies  would  have  to  acquiesce  in  her  control  of Palestine."{{sfn|McTague|1980|p=282}}}}{{efn|group=qt|In July, Balfour had authorized Mr. Forbes Adam of the Foreign Office, who at that time served with the Peace Delegation in Paris, to discuss with Dr. Weizmann, Mr. Frankfurter (as he than was) and Mr. Ganz the draft for the Palestine Mandate "on the supposition that Great Britain were to obtain the mandate for Palestine".&lt;ref&gt;Documents on British Foreign Policy (1919-39) Series I Vol. IV, p.428&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The February 1919 Zionist Proposal to the Peace Conference was not discussed at the time, as the Allies' discussions were focused elsewhere; it was not until July 1919 that direct negotiations begun between the British Foreign Office and the Zionists, following the production of a draft mandate by the British. The British draft comprised 29 articles, compared to the 5 articles in the Zionist proposal.{{efn|McTague writes: "The Zionist Organization had produced a draft of a proposed constitution as far back as December 1918 in anticipation of their appearance before the Versailles Conference... The Zionists presented this document to the Peace Conference, but since the Allies failed to come to any decisions on the captured Ottoman territories, these proposals were not discussed at the time. Nevertheless, in April the Foreign Office reviewed the Zionist Organization's draft, and they made some small but significant changes... Then in July, Foreign Secretary Balfour authorized Eric Forbes-Adam to begin direct negotiations with members of the Zionist Organization, including Weizmann and Felix Frankfurter, over the wording of the text. The Foreign Office unveiled a much longer document (twenty-nine articles compared to five in the earlier draft), but one which adhered quite closely to the general principles  laid down in April."{{sfn|McTague|1980|p=283}}}} The mandate went through multiple drafts, including a December 1919 draft produced after discussions between Forbes-Adam and Cohen, a June 1920 draft after Curzon's "watering down", and the December 1920 draft which was submitted to the League of Nations for comment.{{efn|McTague writes: "The final draft of the mandate, then, was the result of long months of argument, discussion and compromise. After negotiations between Forbes-Adam and Cohen, a version had emerged which embodied the major Zionist objectives, but under the prodding of Curzon, a much less specific document had evolved by the time the next draft had been produced in June. By then, the Zionists had become dissatisfied, and they had succeeded in having the key phrase on "historical connection" restored to the document in early August. The interdepartmental Committee had cut the phrase in half at the end of the month, and Curzon had decided to eliminate it altogether in September. Pressure from Lloyd George and Balfour, however, had induced him to compromise, and the final draft had included a Preamble with which Weizmann was quite satisfied. Aside from the Preamble, Curzon had had his own way almost entirely. The Zionist Organization was mentioned only once, in Article 4, and even there its role was qualified by the phrase .. so long as its organisation and constitution are in the opinion of the Mandatory appropriate." General reference to a Jewish Agency was made only three times, in Articles 4, 6 and 11, and all guarantees, such as those for freedom of religion and rights of education, were made only in general terms, without any specific reference to Jews. It should be noted that some further changes were made in the mandate before its approval in 1922, but these revisions were undertaken at the behest of other sovereign states, not the Zionists."{{sfn|McTague|1980|p=289}}}} The drafting was carried out with no input from any Arabs, despite the fact that their disagreement with the Balfour Declaration policy was well known.{{efn|McTague writes: "Yet another interesting aspect is the complete absence of any input from Arab sources, despite the fact that the Jerusalem Riot of April 1920 had testified to Palestinian resistance to the National Home policy. No effort was made by the government to bring any Arabs into the negotiations. Largely motivated by traditional imperialistic beliefs, His Majesty's government reasoned that having conquered Palestine by force of arms, they could do with it as they wished. The only Arab leader in whom they had any confidence at all, Emir Feisal, had already agreed to the principle of Jewish National Home under certain conditions, and during the course of the year 1920 his problems in Syria precluded his involvement in the mandate discussions. His Majesty's government also refused to recognize any Palestinians as spokesmen for their own community, although a year later they were forced to grant unofficial status to the delegation from the Palestine Arab Congress. Thus, the mandate was drafted and redrafted several times over, without the Palestinian Arabs having had any input as to its contents. "{{sfn|McTague|1980|p=290}}}}

A draft was presented by the Zionist Organization to the British on 15 July 1919.&lt;ref name=zionist_congress_1921&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=883&amp;dat=19210909&amp;id=GQEfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0WEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2275,1052157&amp;hl=en ''The Zionist Congress'']. The Canadian Jewish Chronicle, p. 6, 9 September 1921. At news.google.com, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Balfour authorized 30-year-old [[Diplomatic rank|diplomatic secretary]] [[Eric Forbes Adam]] to begin negotiations with the Zionist Organization. [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Curzon]] was to succeed Balfour as Foreign Secretary in October 1919. On the Zionist side, the drafting was led by 24-year-old [[Benjamin Victor Cohen|Benjamin V Cohen]] on behalf of Weizmann, [[Felix Frankfurter]] and other Zionist leaders.{{sfn|McTague|1980|p=283}}{{efn|Weizmann wrote in his memoirs: "Curzon had by now taken over from Balfour at the Foreign Office, and was in charge of the actual drafting of the Mandate. On our side we had the valuable assistance of Ben V. Cohen, who stayed on with us in London after most of his fellow-Brandeisists had resigned from the Executive and withdrawn from the work. Ben Cohen was one of the ablest draftsmen in America, and he and Curzon's secretary — young Eric Forbes-Adam, highly intelligent, efficient and most sympathetic — fought the battle of the Mandate for many months."{{sfn|Weizmann|1949|p=347–348}}}}

A second draft was presented on 10 June 1920. In the second draft, the paragraph recognising the historical connection of the Jewish people with Palestine was removed from the preamble. "self-governing commonwealth" was replaced by "self-governing institutions". Also, "The recognition of the establishment of the Jewish National Home as the guiding principle in the execution of the Mandate" was omitted from the first draft. After strenuous objection to the proposed changes, the statement regarding the historical connections of the Jews with Palestine was re-incorporated into the Mandate in December 1920.&lt;ref name=zionist_congress_1921/&gt; The draft was submitted to the League of Nations on 6 December 1920.{{sfn|Sicker|1999|pp=163-165}}

In the summer of 1921, a Palestinian delegation arrived in London to negotiate on behalf of the Muslim and Christian population.{{efn|Weizmann wrote in his memoirs: "As the drafting of the Mandate progressed, and the prospect of its ratification drew nearer, we found ourselves on the defensive against attacks from every conceivable quarter — on our position in Palestine, on our work there, on our good faith. The spearhead of these attacks was an Arab delegation from Palestine, which arrived in London via Cairo, Rome and Paris in the summer of 1921, and established itself in London at the Hotel Cecil."{{sfn|Weizmann|1949|p=348}}}}
The document was based on the principles contained in Article 22 of the draft [[Covenant of the League of Nations]] and the [[San Remo conference|San Remo Resolution]] of 25 April 1920 by the principal [[Allies of World War I|Allied and associated powers]] after the First World War.{{sfn|Palestine Royal Commission|1937}} The mandate formalised [[British Empire|British]] rule in the southern part of [[Ottoman Syria]] from 1923–1948.

Each of the principal Allied powers had a hand in drafting the proposed mandate{{sfn|Ingrams|2009|p=Chapter 9, Drafting the Mandate}}—although some, including the United States, had not declared war on the Ottoman Empire and did not become members of the League of Nations.

The United States was not a member of the [[League of Nations]]. On 23 February 1921, two months after the draft mandates had been submitted to the League, the United States formally requested that it be allowed to comment prior to consideration by the Council of the League of Nations; the Council agreed to this requirement a week later.{{sfn|Stoyanovsky|1928|p=30}} These discussions did not conclude until 14 May 1922, when the United States government announced the terms of an agreement with the United Kingdom regarding the Palestine mandate.{{sfn|Stoyanovsky|1928|p=30}}&lt;ref&gt;Hansard, [https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1922/may/16/palestine-anglo-american-agreement PALESTINE (ANGLO-AMERICAN AGREEMENT)], HC Deb 16 May 1922 vol 154 c209: "...communiqué on this subject issued by the Department of State at Washington on 14th May"&lt;/ref&gt; The terms included a stipulation that "consent of the United States shall be obtained before any alteration is made in the text of the mandate".&lt;ref&gt;[[The Nation]], 12 July 1922, [https://archive.org/stream/nation115julnewy#page/28/mode/1up American Rights in Palestine], volume CXV, issue 2975, page 53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1922v02/d227 The Secretary of State to the Ambassador in Great Britain (Harvey), 10 May 1922], Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States, 1922, volume II, 867n.01/236: Telegram&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 17, 1922, in a discussion regarding the date on which the question of the Draft Mandate for Palestine should be placed on the Agenda of the Council of the League of Nations, Lord Balfour informed the Council of his government's understanding of the role of the League in the creation of mandates.  According to the summary in the minutes, he said that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[the] Mandates were not the creation of the League, and they could not in substance be altered by the League. The League's duties were confined to seeing that the specific and detailed terms of the mandates were in accordance with the decisions taken by the Allied and Associated Powers, and that in carrying out these mandates the Mandatory Powers should be under the supervision—not under the control—of the League. A mandate was a self-imposed limitation by the conquerors on the sovereignty which they exercised over the conquered territory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://uniteapps.un.org/dpa/dpr/unispal.nsf/0/B08168048E277B5A052565F70058CEF3 Date on which the question of the Draft Mandate for Palestine should be placed on the Agenda of the Council], League of Nations, Official Journal, June 1922, pp. 545-546.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the new year 1923, Fascist Italy sought to embarrass the Anglo-French mandate-holders at the League of Nations by championing the rights of native petitioners in the mandated territories. Furthermore, by aligning with the United States, Italy was instrumental in delaying the full implementation of the Near Eastern mandates. However, in April, when Washington modified its opposition, Mussolini recognized that conditions were "unfavorable to the possibility of continuing resistance alone." As a final gesture he required a guarantee of the rights of Italian citizens in the mandated areas. This took the summer of 1923 to negotiate, but on September 30 Italy agreed to support at Geneva a resolution ratifying the authority of Britain and France in their Near Eastern mandates. Although he had totally given in, Mussolini was the last to admit it. With his acceptance of the Anglo-French mandates went the stipulation that it was "not prejudicial to the re-examination of the general question concerning Allied reciprocity in the eastern Mediterranean"."{{sfn|Cassels|1970|p=31–32}}}} On 23 August 1923 the Turkish assembly in Ankara ratified the Treaty of Lausanne by 215 votes out of 235.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Aug 24, 1923, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In a letter in reply dated September 8th, 1923, the Turkish Charge d'Affaires in Berne stated that the Turkish National Assembly had ratified the Treaty of Peace of Lausanne on August 23rd, 1923."

The British announced agreement with the United States on the terms of this mandate in May, 1922. The United States approved the French draft of the Syrian mandate in July, 1922, but Italy objected to its confirmation, as also that of Palestine, until title was cleared through ratification of a peace treaty with Turkey.  Apparently she also objected because the failure of the treaty of Sèvres had deprived her of the spheres of interest which she had been accorded in compensation for her approval of the French and British spheres by the agreement of August 10, 1920, dependent on that treaty. Italy apparently wished a renewal of the assurances with regard to economic, educational and missionary privileges in Syria and Palestine which she had renounced in the sphere of interest agreement. Great Britain had already given assurances to Italy with regard to Palestine, and during the council meeting in July, 1922, Italy and France began negotiations with the result that the Syrian and Palestine mandates were confirmed with assurances that Catholic and Moslem interests in Palestine would be protected, on July 24, to go into effect when the Franco-Italian agreement was announced. This announcement was made on September 29, 1923, the peace treaty with Turkey having been signed at Lausanne on July 24, 1923."{{sfn|Wright|1968|p=57}}}}&lt;ref&gt;LoN OJ minutes, Volume III, page 799; Italian representative: "the future of these mandates should be bound up with the fate of the Treaty of Sèvres".&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Palestine Royal Commission|1937}}{{efn|As Marlowe described: "It was formally approved by the League of Nations on 24 July 1922, but did not come legally into force until after the ratification of the Treaty of Lausanne on 28 September 1923."{{sfn|Marlowe|1959|p=62}}}}

===Turkey===
Turkey was not a member of the League of Nations at the time of the negotiations; having been on the losing side of World War I, they were not to join until 1932. The decisions regarding mandates over Ottoman territory taken by the [[Allied Supreme Council]] at the San Remo conference was documented in the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], signed on behalf of the Ottoman Empire and Allies on 10 August 1920. However, the treaty was never ratified by the Ottoman government,&lt;ref name=rifkind&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AuBQu7oUWhYC&amp;dq|title=The Basic Equities of the Palestine Problem|first=Simon Hirsch|last=Rifkind|date=1 January 1977|publisher=Arno Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it required the agreement of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]. Atatürk expressed disdain for the treaty, and continued the fight known as the [[Turkish War of Independence]]. In November 1922, the [[Conference of Lausanne]] began, with the intention to negotiate a treaty to replace the failed Treaty of Sèvres. In the [[Treaty of Lausanne]], signed on 24 July 1923, the Turkish government formally recognised the detachment of the regions south of the frontier agreed in the [[Treaty of Ankara (1921)]], thereby making a general renunciation of its sovereignty over Palestine.&lt;ref name=rifkind/&gt;

==Key issues==
===National home for the Jewish people (Preamble and Articles 2, 4, 6, 7, 11)===
[[File:Zionist Rejoicings. British Mandate For Palestine Welcomed, The Times, Monday, Apr 26, 1920.png|thumb|"Zionist Rejoicings. British Mandate For Palestine Welcomed", The Times, Monday, 26 April 1920, following conclusion of the [[San Remo conference]].]]The preamble of the mandate document declared:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Whereas the Principal Allied Powers have also agreed that the Mandatory should be responsible for putting into effect the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|declaration originally made on November&amp;nbsp;2nd, 1917]], by the Government of His Britannic Majesty, and adopted by the said Powers, in favour of the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, it being clearly understood that nothing should be done which might prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.&lt;ref name="AvalonPalmanda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/palmanda.asp|title=The Avalon Project : The Palestine Mandate|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Weizmann noted in his memoirs that he considered the most important part of the mandate, and the most difficult negotiation, was the clause in the preamble which recognized "the historical connection of the Jews with Palestine".{{efn|group=qt|Weizmann wrote in his memoirs: "The most serious difficulty arose in connection with a paragraph in the Preamble — the phrase which now reads: 'Recognizing the historical connection of the Jews with Palestine.' Zionists wanted to have it read: 'Recognizing the historic rights of the Jews to Palestine.' But Curzon would have none of it, remarking dryly: 'If you word it like that, I can see Weizmann coming to me every other day and saying he has a right to do this, that or the other in Palestine! I won't have it!' As a compromise, Balfour suggested 'historical connection,' and 'historical connection' it was. I confess that for me this was the most important part of the Mandate. I felt instinctively that the other provisions of the Mandate might remain a dead letter, e.g, ' to place the country under such political, economic and administrative conditions as may facilitate the development of the Jewish National Home.' All one can say about that point, after more than twenty-five years, is that at least Palestine has not so far been placed under a legislative council with an Arab majority — but that is rather a negative brand of fulfilment of a positive injunction."{{sfn|Weizmann|1949|p=348}}{{sfn|McTague|1980|p=283}}}}The British Foreign Secretary, Lord Curzon, together with the Italian and French governments rejected early drafts of the mandate because they had contained a passage which read: "Recognising, moreover, the historical connection of the Jewish people with Palestine and ''the claim which this gives them to reconstitute it their national home''..."{{sfn|Ingrams|2009|p=98}} The Palestine Committee set up by the Foreign Office recommended that the reference to 'the claim' be omitted. The Allies had already noted the historical connection in the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], but they had not acknowledged a legal claim. Lord Balfour suggested an alternative which was accepted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whereas recognition has thereby [i.e. by the Treaty of Sèvres] been given to the historical connection of the Jewish people with Palestine, and to the grounds for reconstituting their National Home in that country ...{{sfn|Ingrams|2009|p=98–103}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; Article 4 of the Mandate provided for "the recognition of an appropriate Jewish agency as a public body for the purpose of advising and co-operating with the Administration of Palestine in such economic, social and other matters as may affect the establishment of the Jewish National Home and the interests of the Jewish population of Palestine," effectively establishing the [[Jewish Agency for Israel|Jewish Agency]].

Article 7 provided: "The Administration of Palestine shall be responsible for enacting a nationality law. There shall be included in this law provisions framed so as to facilitate the acquisition of Palestinian citizenship by Jews who take up their permanent residence in Palestine."

=== Religious and communal issues (Articles 13-16 and 23) ===

The Vatican and the Italian and French governments concentrated their efforts on the issue of the Holy Places and rights of the Christian communities;{{sfn|Zander|1973|p=12}} the Zionists showed limited interest in this area.{{sfn|Zander|1973|p=11-12}} continued to press their own legal claims on the basis of the former [[Protectorate of the Holy See]] and the [[French Protectorate of Jerusalem]]. The Catholic powers saw an opportunity to reverse the gains made by the Greek and Russian Orthodox communities in the region over the previous 150 years, as documented in the [[Status quo of Holy Land sites]].{{sfn|Zander|1973|p=12-14}}

Britain was to assume responsibility for the Holy Places under Article 13 of the mandate. The idea of an International Commission to resolve claims on the Holy Places had been formalised in Article 95 of the Treaty of Sèvres, and taken up again in article 14 of the Palestinian Mandate. Negotiations concerning the formation and the role of the commission were partly responsible for the delay in ratifying the mandate. Article 14 of the Mandate required Britain to establish a commission to study, define, and determine the rights and claims relating to the different religious communities in Palestine. This provision, which called for the creation of a commission to review the religious [[Status quo of Holy Land sites|''status quo'']] between the religious communities, was never implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/FD455E412ACE30AD0525668E006EF702 |title=United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine Committee on Jerusalem : The Holy Places|author=UN Secretariat |date= 8 April 1949 |website= United Nations|access-date=11 June 2018 |quote=...proposal, however was not carried into effect, and as a consequence, the Status Quo promulgated in 1757, and reaffirmed in 1852 was applied in respect of the rights and claims of the various communities throughout the duration of the British Mandate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://bcrfj.revues.org/document3502.html|title=The End of the French Religious Protectorate in Jerusalem (1918-1924)|first=Catherine|last=Nicault|date=30 March 1999|publisher=|issue=4|pages=77–92|via=bcrfj.revues.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 15 required the mandatory administration to see to it that complete freedom of conscience and the free exercise of all forms of worship were permitted. Article 15 stated that "No discrimination of any kind shall be made between the inhabitants of Palestine on the ground of race, religion or language. No person shall be excluded from Palestine on the sole ground of his religious belief."{{sfn|Hurewitz|1979|p=308}}

The High Commissioner established the authority of the Orthodox Rabbinate over the members of the Jewish community and retained a modified version of the old [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman Millet]] system. Formal recognition was extended to eleven religious communities, which did not include the non-Orthodox Jewish or Protestant Christian denominations.

The proviso to the objective of the mandate was that "nothing should be done which might prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine".

Under the terms of the McMahon-Hussein correspondence and Sykes-Picot agreements, Transjordan was to be part of an Arab state or confederation of Arab states. In 1918, the British military retreated from Trans-Jordan, in an indication of their political ideas about the future of the territory, which according to their position was designated to be part of the Arab Syrian state.{{efn| group=lower-roman| Biger wrote: "The British representatives involved in the Middle Eastern issue - Mark Sykes and Ormsby-Gore - both supported a line East of the Jordan river, but not all the way up the mountains. The retreat of the British forces from Trans-Jordan in the spring of 1918 was only a military move, although it indicated British political ideas about the future of the region East of the rift. According to their position, the land that lay east of the Jordan river was destined to be part of the Arab Syrian state, which would be centred in Damascus and headed by Faisal."{{sfn|Biger|2004|p=170}}}}

The boundaries of the Palestine Mandate were not defined when it was awarded in April 1920 at the [[San Remo conference]]. In a telegram to the Foreign Office summarising the conclusions of the San Remo conference, the Foreign Secretary, Lord Curzon, stated: "The boundaries will not be defined in Peace Treaty but are to be determined at a later date by principal Allied Powers".

During 1920, two principles emerged within the British government: the first was that the Palestine government would not extend east of the Jordan, and the second was the government's chosen – albeit disputed – interpretation of the 1915 [[McMahon-Hussein Correspondence]] which proposed that Transjordan had been included in the area of "Arab independence" whilst Palestine had been excluded.{{sfn|Paris|2003|p=154}}{{efn|Paris writes: "Of course, the uncertainty surrounding Transjordan's status pre-dated Abdullah's appearance on the scene. While it had long been clear that British control of the area south of the Sykes-Picot line and extending from Palestine to Persia would be divided into two political regions, the Palestine and Mesopotamian Mandates were assumed to be coterminous: no provision was made for any intervening territory. Whether it was part of Palestine or Mesopotamia, however, there was never any doubt that Transjordan would come under the British Mandate. But recognition of that fact did not resolve the status of Transjordan vis-à-vis its neighbours in any definitive way. Moreover, two principles that emerged in 1920 and were calculated to further define the nature of the new state, served only to further confuse matters and to generate the uncertainty of which Abdullah, Samuel and Philby later complained. The first was that the administrative authority of the Palestine government would not be extended east of the Jordan, a principle laid down as early as July 1920. The second sprang from Young's interpretation of the 'McMahon pledge'. Since McMahon had excluded from the area of promised Arab independence territory lying west of the 'district of Damascus', he argued that in areas to the east of that district—that is, east of the River Jordan—Britain was obligated to 'recognise and support' such independence. The interpretation seemed logical enough to those who had not examined carefully the text of McMahon's letters…"{{sfn|Paris|2003|p=202-203}}}}

At the [[Battle of Maysalun]] on 23 July 1920, the French removed the newly proclaimed nationalist government of [[Hashim al-Atassi]] and expelled [[Faisal I of Iraq|King Faisal]] from Syria. The French formed a new Damascus state after the [[Battle of Maysalun]], they refrained from extending their rule into the southern part of Faisal's domain, and the area of Transjordan became for a time a no-man's land.{{efn|Bentwich described the situation as follows: "The High Commissioner had ... only been in office a few days when Emir Faisal ... had to flee his kingdom" and "The departure of Faisal and the breaking up of the Emirate of Syria left the territory on the east side of Jordan in a puzzling state of detachment. It was for a time no-man's-land. In the Ottoman regime the territory was attached to the Vilayet of Damascus; under the Military Administration it had been treated a part of the eastern occupied territory which was governed from Damascus; but it was now impossible that that subordination should continue, and its natural attachment was with Palestine. The territory was, indeed, included in the Mandated territory of Palestine, but difficult issues were involved as to application there of the clauses of the Mandate concerning the jewish National Home. The undertakings given to the Arabs as to the autonomous Arab region included the territory. Lastly, His Majesty's Government were unwilling to embark on any definite commitment, and vetoed any entry into the territory by the troops. The Arabs were therefore left to work out their destiny."{{sfn|Bentwich|1932|p=51}}}} As a result, [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Curzon]] instructed [[Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart|Vansittart]] in August 1920 to leave the eastern boundary of Palestine undefined, stating: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"His Majesty's Government are already treating 'Trans-Jordania' as separate from the Damascus State, while at the same time avoiding any definite connection between it and Palestine, thus leaving the way open for the establishment there, should it become advisable, of some form of independent Arab government, perhaps by arrangement with King Hussein or other Arab chiefs concerned."{{sfn|Karsh|Karsh|2001|p=317}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; Following the French occupation, the British suddenly wanted to know 'what is the "Syria" for which the French received a mandate at San Remo?' and "does it include Transjordania?".{{efn|group=qt|Hubert Young to Ambassador Hardinge (Paris), 27 July 1920, FO 371/5254, cited by Wilson.{{sfn|Wilson|1990|p=44}}}} British Foreign Minister Curzon ultimately decided that it did not and that Transjordan would remain independent, but in the closest relation with Palestine.{{efn|group=lower-roman|Wilson writes: "Since the end of the war the territory north of Ma'an had been ruled by Damascus as a province of Faysal's Kingdom of Syria. Although it fell within the British zone according to the Sykes-Picot agreemen, Britain was content with the arrangement because it favoured Arab rule in the interior and Faysal was, after all, British protege. However, when France occupied Damascus the picture changed dramatically. Britain did not want to see France extend its control southward to the borders of Palestine and closer to the Suez Canal.... It suddenly became important to know 'what is the "Syria" for which the French received a mandate at San Remo?' and 'does it include Transjordania?'... The British foreign secretary, Lord Curzon, decided that it did not and that Britain henceforth would regard the area as independent, but in 'closest relation' with Palestine."{{sfn|Wilson|1990|p=44}}}}

[[File:The high commissioner's first visit to Transjordan, in Es-Salt..jpg|right|thumb|Herbert Samuel's proclamation in [[Salt, Jordan|Salt]], August 1920, for which he was admonished by Curzon]]

In August 1920, newly-appointed High Commissioner [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]] asked to put parts of Transjordan directly under his administrative control but was declined due to London's unwillingness to commit any significant resources to this area.{{efn| group=lower-roman| Sicker wrote: "On August 7, 1920, Herbert Samuel, the recently appointed high commissioner in Palestine, cabled London requesting permission to include Trans-Jordan directly under his administrative control, thereby allowing him to take the necessary steps to restore order in the territory. This would eliminate the threat of a French attempt to control the region from Damascus. London, however, troubled by a declining economy at home and seeking ways to reduce military expenditures, was unwilling to commit any significant resources to an area that it considered to be of only marginal value. Curzon therefore rejected Samuel's appeal and proposed instead that a few political officers be sent to "such places as Salt and Kerak, provided that no military escorts are necessary to ensure their safety…. The duties of these officers should be confined to encouraging local self-government and to giving such advice as is asked for by the people…. There must be no question of setting up any British Administration in that area."{{sfn|Sicker|1999|pp=158}}}} British Foreign Secretary Earl Curzon wrote to Samuel in August 1920 stating, "I suggest that you should let it be known forthwith that in the area south of the Sykes-Picot line, we will not admit French authority and that our policy for this area to be independent but in closest relations with Palestine."{{sfn|Aruri|1972|p= 17; cites: Telegram from Earl Curzon to Sir Herbert Samuel, dated 6 August 1920, in Rohan Butler et al., Documents of British Foreign Policy, 1919–1939, first series volume XIII London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1963, p. 331}} Samuel replied to Curzon, "After the fall of Damascus a fortnight ago...Sheiks and tribes east of Jordan utterly dissatisfied with Shareefian Government most unlikely would accept revival."{{sfn|Aruri|1972|p= 18; cites: Telegram 7 August 1920, in Rohan Butler et al., Documents of British Foreign Policy, 1919–1939, first series volume XIII London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1963, p. 334}} He subsequently announced that Transjordan was under British Mandate.{{sfn|Aruri|1972|p= 18}} Without authority from London, Samuel then visited Transjordan and at a meeting with 600 leaders in [[Salt, Jordan|Salt]], announced the independence of the area from Damascus and its absorption into the mandate, quadrupling the area under his control by tacit capitulation. Samuel assured his audience that Transjordan would not be merged with Palestine.{{sfn|Aruri|1972|p= 18}}{{efn|group=lower-roman|Wilson writes: "Samuel then organised a meeting of Transjordanian leaders at Salt on 21 August, at which he would announce British plans... On 20 August Samuel and a few political officers left Jerusalem by car, headed for the Jordan river, the frontier of British territory at that time. 'It is an entirely irregular proceeding,' he noted, 'my going outside my own jurisdiction into a country which was Faisal's, and is still being administered by the Damascus Government, now under French influence. But it is equally irregular for a government under French influence to be exercising functions in territory which is agreed to be within the British sphere: and of the two irregularities I prefer mine.'... The meeting, held in the courtyard of the Catholic church, was attended by about 600 people..... Sentence by sentence his speech describing British policy was translated into Arabic: political officers would be stationed in towns to help organise local governments; Transjordan would not come under Palestinian administration; there would be no conscription and no disarmament......On balance, Samuel's statement of policy was unobjectionable. Three things feared by the Arabs of Transjordan – conscription, disarmament, and annexation by Palestine - were abjured.... The presence of a few British agents, unsupported by troops, seemed a small concession in return for the protection Britain's presence would afford against the French, who, it was feared, might press their occupation southward...

On 21 November 1920, [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah]], the brother of recently deposed King Faisal, marched into Ma'an at the head of an army of 300 men.{{efn|group=lower-roman|Wilson writes: "Abdullah's arrival in Ma'an on 21 November threatened to disrupt Samuel's cosy arrangement.

Several weeks later he received the following reply from Jerusalem: "It is considered most unlikely that the Emir Abdullah would advance into territory which is under British control... Two days later Abdullah's troops marched into British-controlled Moab. Unable to stop him, Kirkbride decided to welcome him instead. With Abdullah's arrival the National Government of Moab went out of existence. Buoyed by his easy success, he decided to proceed to Amman. By the end of March 1921 Abdullah and his small army had effectively occupied most of Trans-Jordan unopposed... There seemed to be only two options. Either the British army had to be sent in to evict him or the French had to be allowed to cross the frontier to accomplish the task. Both courses of action were considered to be completely unacceptable. The government was simply not prepared to go to the expense of sending an army to fight in a territory of such marginal importance as Trans-Jordan, and it was equally inconceivable that British policy would permit French intervention and occupation of the area. There was, however, another alternative, which was suggested by Churchill. He observed that it was most important that the government of Trans-Jordan be compatible with that of Iraq because British strategy called for a direct overland link between Egypt and the Persian Gulf, which would have to cross both territories. Since in the meantime Feisal had been given the throne of Iraq, it might well serve British purposes to make his brother, Abdullah, ruler of Trans-Jordan or to appoint an indigenous leader approved by him.″{{sfn|Sicker|1999|pp=159-161}}}}

The [[Cairo Conference (1921)|Cairo Conference]] was convened on 12
March 1921 by Colonial Secretary [[Winston Churchill]], then Britain's Colonial Secretary, and lasted until 30 March; the conference was to endorse an arrangement whereby Transjordan would be added to the Palestine mandate, with Abdullah as the emir under the authority of the High Commissioner, and with the condition that the Jewish National Home provisions of the Palestine mandate would not apply there.{{efn|group=lower-roman|name=Wasserstein|Wasserstein writes: "Palestine, therefore, was not partitioned in 1921–1922. Transjordan was not excised but, on the contrary, added to the mandatory area. Zionism was barred from seeking to expand there – but the Balfour Declaration had never previously applied to the area east of the Jordan. Why is this important? Because the myth of Palestine's 'first partition' has become part of the concept of 'Greater Israel' and of the ideology of Jabotinsky's Revisionist movement."{{sfn|Wasserstein|2008|p=105–106}}}} On the first day of the conference, the Middle East Department of the [[Colonial Office]] set out the situation as follows:&lt;ref name="Klieman1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Aaron S.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Distinction to be drawn between Palestine and Trans-Jordan under the Mandate. His Majesty's Government are responsible under the terms of the Mandate for establishing in Palestine a national home for the Jewish people. They are also pledged by the assurances given to the Sherif of Mecca in 1915 to recognise and support the independence of the Arabs in those portions of the (Turkish) vilayet of Damascus in which they are free to act without detriment to French interests. The western boundary of the Turkish vilayet of Damascus before the war was the River Jordan. Palestine and Trans-Jordan do not, therefore, stand upon quite the same footing. At the same time, the two areas are economically interdependent, and their development must be considered as a single problem. Further, His Majesty's Government have been entrusted with the Mandate for "Palestine." If they wish to assert their claim to Trans-Jordan and to avoid raising with other Powers the legal status of that area, they can only do so by proceeding upon the assumption that Trans-Jordan forms part of the area covered by the Palestine Mandate. In default of this assumption Trans-Jordan would be left, under article 132 of the Treaty of Sèvres, to the disposal of the principal Allied Powers. Some means must be found of giving effect in Trans-Jordan to the terms of the Mandate consistently with "recognition and support of the independence of the Arabs".&lt;ref&gt;[Appendix 2, Memorandum drawn up in London by Middle East Department Prior to Palestine Conference, p30, Report on Middle East Conference held in Cairo and Jerusalem, 12 March 1921, CO935/1/1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 21 March 1921, the Foreign and Colonial office legal advisers decided to introduce Article 25 into the Palestine Mandate. It was approved by Curzon on 31 March 1921, and the revised final draft of the mandate (including Transjordan) was forwarded to the League of Nations on 22 July 1922.{{sfn|Klieman|1970|pp=228–234}} Article 25 permitted the mandatory to "postpone or withhold application of such provisions of the mandate as he may consider inapplicable to the existing local conditions" in that region. The final text of the Mandate includes an Article 25 which states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In the territories lying between the Jordan [river] and the eastern boundary of Palestine as ultimately determined, the Mandatory shall be entitled, with the consent of the Council of the League of Nations, to postpone or withhold application of such provisions of this mandate as he may consider inapplicable to the existing local conditions, and to make such provision for the administration of the territories as he may consider suitable to those conditions"&lt;ref name="avalon.law.yale.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/palmanda.asp#art25|title=The Avalon Project : The Palestine Mandate|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Trans-Jordania would not be included in the present administrative system of Palestine, and therefore the Zionist clauses of the mandate would not apply.

We have not received what we sought, and I regret to have to tell you this. The only thing we received was the concession to be allowed a voice in the discussion on the water rights. And now just a week ago, when the Administration in Palestine, under pressure from a few soldiers, wished to alter our boundaries we protested most strongly and confirmed the boundary along the lines that were agreed upon.

Abdullah's six-month trial was subsequently extended, and by the following summer Abdullah had begun to voice his impatience at the lack of formal confirmation.{{efn|Paris writes: "Churchill's decision to prolong British sponsorship of Abdullah did little to elevate the low opinion that Whitehall entertained for the Amir… It was the attitude in Jerusalem—Amman's only conduit to London—that critically affected Abdullah's regime, and this attitude underwent a dramatic change in 1922. Samuel and Deedes, the harshest critics of the Amir in 1921, became his strongest supporters by mid-1922. 'If we lose the cordial co- operation of Abdullah,' Samuel wrote in August, 'we lose our most valuable asset in Trans-Jordan.'… Although the Amir had won the support of Samuel and conditions in Transjordan had improved considerably in 1922, neither the status of the territory, nor that of Abdullah within it, had yet been defined. When Churchill decided to continue British support for the Amir in late 1921, he also stated his preference to simply 'allow matters...to pursue their present course' in Transjordan. But Samuel and Philby found such a laissez-faire policy difficult to accept. And by July, Abdullah too 'was getting very sick of the present situation of uncertainty' and told Philby 'he could not go on much longer'… These problems were highlighted by the amorphous nature of the territory: as of July 1922, only Transjordan's northern boundary had been defined.{{sfn|Paris|2003|p=198-202}}}} Shortly after the approval of the mandate in July 1922, the Colonial Office prepared a memorandum to give effect to Article 25.{{efn|Paris writes: "Owing to US and Vatican opposition, the Palestine Mandate was not approved by the League of Nations until 22 July 1922. Shortly thereafter, the Colonial Office prepared a memorandum describing those provisions of the Palestine Mandate that would not be applied to Transjordan, as allowed by Article 25. The memorandum was then presented to the Council of the League, which passed a resolution on 16 September 1922 exempting Transjordan from the Zionist clauses of the Mandate.… Still, frustratingly for Abdullah, no formal steps had been taken to confirm a Sherifian solution for Transjordan and his role there remained undefined."{{sfn|Paris|2003|p=203; Paris references Churchill to Hankey, Cabinet, 1 September 1922, FO 371/7791, pp. 180–2}}}} On 16 September 1922, the League of Nations approved a [[Transjordan memorandum|British memorandum]] detailing its intended implementation of that clause, namely to exclude Transjordan from the articles related to Jewish settlement.{{sfn|Pappé|2004|p=84}}&lt;ref&gt;''League of Nations Official Journal'', Nov. 1922, pp. 1188–1189.&lt;/ref&gt; On submission of the memorandum to the Council of the League of Nations, Balfour explained the background as recorded in the minutes: "Lord Balfour reminded his colleagues that Article 25 of the mandate for Palestine as approved by the Council in London on July 24th, 1922, provides that the territories in Palestine which lie east of the Jordan should be under a somewhat different regime from the rest of Palestine. ... The British Government now merely proposed to carry out this article. It had always been part of the policy contemplated by the League and accepted by the British Government, and the latter now desired to carry it into effect. In pursuance of the policy, embodied in Article 25, Lord Balfour invited the Council to pass a series of resolutions which modified the mandate as regards those territories. The object of these resolutions was to withdraw from Trans-Jordania the special provisions which were intended to provide a national home for the Jews west of the Jordan."&lt;ref&gt;LofN Official Journal, Nov 1922, pp1188-1189&lt;/ref&gt;

This public clarification and implementation of Article 25, more than a year after it had been added to the mandate, was, in the words of Professor of Modern Jewish History [[Bernard Wasserstein]], to result in "the myth of Palestine's 'first partition' [which became] part of the concept of 'Greater Israel' and of the ideology of Jabotinsky's Revisionist movement".{{efn|group=lower-roman|name=Wasserstein}}{{efn|Adam Garfinkle explained that: "After the Cairo Conference of March 1921, whereupon the Emirate of Transjordan was created, Article 25 pertaining to Transjordan was added to the draft Mandate - in August 1921. Article 25 notes that Transjordanian territory is not included in the Jewish National Home. This language confuses some readers into imagining that Transjordanian territory was covered by the conditions of the Mandate as to the Jewish National Home before August 1921. Not so; what became Transjordanian territory was not part of the mandate at all. As noted, it was part of the Arabian Chapter problem; it was, in other words, in a state of postwar legal and administrative limbo. And this is also not to speak of the fact that, as of August 1921, the mandates had yet to be approved or take effect."{{sfn|Garfinkle|1998}}}}{{efn|Biger wrote: "The  results  of  the  Cairo  conference  were  a  failure  for  the  Zionist Organization,  but  Britain  had  won  itself  a  devoted  ally  east  of  the  Jordan...

The  call  'Two  banks  for  the  Jordan  river  –  this  one  is  ours  and  so  is  the other'  was  heard  from  then  onward.  Even  the  other  side  of  the  Jewish political  map  did  not  lose  its  faith  in  achieving  a  better  political  solution, and  in  a  famous  song  –  which  was  composed  many  years  later  –  one  can find  the  words  'from  Metulla  to  the  Negev,  from  the  sea  to  the  desert'.

Prior to the war, the territory which became Mandatory Palestine formerly constituted the [[sanjaks of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Empire divisions]]s of the [[Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem]] and the southern part of the [[Beirut Vilayet]], whilst what became Transjordan was made up of the southern part of the [[Vilayet of Syria]] and the northern part of the [[Hejaz Vilayet]].{{sfn | Sykes | 1973| p=43}} During the war the British military divided the Hijaz theatre of war and the EEF theatre of war along a line from a point south of Akaba to a point south of Ma'an.

At a private meeting during the Peace Conference on 13 September 1919, a memorandum was handed by [[Lloyd George]] to [[Georges Clemenceau]] which stated that British Palestine would be "defined in accordance with its ancient boundaries of [[From Dan to Beersheba|Dan to Beersheba]]".{{sfn|Lieshout|2016|p=373}}{{efn|group=qt|Lloyd-George's "Aide-Memoire in Regard to the Occupation of Syria, Palestine and Mesopotamia Pending the Decision in Regard to Mandates" included the following: "1.

====Northern borders====
The determination of Palestine's northern border was a far longer and more complex process than for Palestine's other borders.{{sfn|Biger|2004|p=101}} The two primary differences were that this border separated Britain and France and that it ran through heavily populated areas which had not previously been separated – the other borders separated British Palestine from British Egypt and British Transjordan, and ran primarily through sparsely inhabited areas.{{sfn|Biger|2004|p=101-102}}

The Northern boundary between the British and French mandates was defined in broad terms by the [[Franco-British Boundary Agreement]] of December 1920. That agreement placed the bulk of the [[Golan Heights]] in the French sphere. The treaty also established a joint commission to settle the precise border and mark it on the ground. The commission submitted its final report on 3 February 1922, and it was approved with some caveats by the British and French governments on 7 March 1923, several months before Britain and France assumed their Mandatory responsibilities on 29 September 1923.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080909201308/http://untreaty.un.org/unts/60001_120000/20/29/00039450.pdf Agreement between His Majesty's Government and the French Government respecting the Boundary Line between Syria and Palestine from the Mediterranean to El Hámmé, Treaty Series No. 13 (1923), Cmd. 1910].

The Zionist movement pressured the French and British to include as much water sources as possible to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] during the demarcating negotiations. These constant demands influenced the negotiators and finally led to the inclusion of the whole [[Sea of Galilee]], both sides of the [[Jordan river]], [[Lake Hula]], Dan spring, and part of the [[Yarmouk River|Yarmouk]]. The High Commissioner of Palestine, [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]], had demanded full control of the Sea of Galilee.{{sfn|Biger|2004|p=130}} The new border followed a 10-meter wide strip along the northeastern shore.{{sfn|Biger|2004|p=145, 150}}

The territory east of the Jordan between Damascus and Ma'an had been ruled as part of [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal]]'s [[Arab Kingdom of Syria|Kingdom of Syria]] since the end of the war. The British were content with that arrangement because Faisal was a British ally and the region fell within the indirect sphere of British influence according to the Sykes-Picot agreement.{{sfn|Wilson|1990|p=44}} They favoured Arab rule in the interior, because they didn't have enough troops to garrison the territory. Damascus was located in the French indirect sphere of influence, and the Sykes-Picot agreement called for Arab rule there too.

The Negev was added to Palestine on 10 July 1922, having been conceded by British representative John Philby "in Trans-Jordan's name".{{efn|Biger described this meeting as follows: "Sovereignty  over  the  Arava,  from  the  south  of  the  Dead  Sea  to Aqaba,  was  also  discussed.  Philby  agreed,  in  Trans-Jordan's  name,  to  give up  the  western  bank  of  Wadi  Arava  (and  thus  all  of  the  Negev  area). Nevertheless,  a  precise  borderline  was  still  not  determined  along  the territories  of  Palestine  and  Trans-Jordan.  Philby's  relinquishment  of  the Negev  was  necessary, because  the  future  of  this  area  was  uncertain.  In  a discussion  regarding  the  southern  boundary,  the  Egyptian  aspiration  to acquire  the  Negev  area  was  presented.  On  the  other  hand  the  southern part  of  Palestine  belonged,  according  to  one  of  the  versions,  to  the  sanjak (district)  of  Ma'an  within  the  vilayet (province)  of  Hejaz.  King  Hussein  of Hijaz  demanded  to  receive  this  area  after  claiming  that  a  transfer  action, to  add  it  to  the  vilayet of  Syria  (A-Sham)  was  supposed  to  be  done  in  1908. It  is  not  clear  whether  this  action  was  completed.  Philby  claimed  that  Emir Abdullah  had  his  father's  permission  to  negotiate  over  the  future  of  the sanjak of  Ma'an,  which  was  actually  ruled  by  him,  and  that  he  could  therefore  'afford  to  concede'  the  area  west  of  the  Arava  in  favour  of  Palestine. This  concession  was  made  following  British  pressure  and  against  the  background  of  the  demands  of  the  Zionist  Organization  for  direct  contact between  Palestine  and  the  Red  Sea.  It  led  to  the  inclusion  of  the  Negev triangle  in  Palestine's  territory,  although  this  area  was  not  considered as part  of  the  country  in  the  many  centuries  that  preceded  the  British occupation."{{sfn|Biger|2004|p=181; Biger references 10 July 1922 meeting notes, file 2.179, CZA}}}} Abdullah made a request for the Negev to be added to Transjordan in late 1922, and again in 1925, but this was rejected.{{sfn|Biger|2004|p=184}}

====Transjordan-Arabia border====
The Southern border between Transjordan and Arabia was left undefined whilst Abdullah's father remained in power in the [[Kingdom of Hejaz]]. However, following the 1924-25 [[Saudi conquest of Hejaz]], the Hashemite army fled to the northern [[Ma'an Governorate|Ma'an province]] of Hejaz, which was then annexed by Transjordan. This was formalised by the [[Hadda Agreement]], with the resulting zig-zag border becoming known as [[Winston's Hiccup]].{{sfn|Wilson|1990|p=100}}

====Transjordan-Iraq border====
The location of the Eastern border between Transjordan and Iraq was first set out on 2 December 1922, in a treaty to which Transjordan was not party to – the [[Uqair Protocol of 1922|Uqair Protocol]] between Iraq and Nejd.{{sfn|Amadouny|2012|p=132-133}} It described the western end of the Iraq-Nejd boundary as "the Jebel Anazan situated in the neighbourhood of the intersection of latitude 32 degrees north longitude 39 degrees east where the Iraq-Najd boundary terminated", thereby implicitly confirming this as the point at which the Iraq-Nejd boundary became the Transjordan-Nejd boundary.{{sfn|Amadouny|2012|p=132-133}} This followed a proposal from Lawrence in January 1922 that Transjordan be extended to include Wadi Sirhan as far south as al-Jauf, in order to protect Britain's route to India and contain Ibn Saud.{{sfn|Amadouny|2012|p=132-133; Amadouny cites Lawrence, 'Transjordan-Extension of Territory', 5 January 1922, CO 733 33}}

==Termination==
Transjordan became largely autonomous under British tutelage according to an agreement of 20 February 1928, and fully independent under a [[Treaty of London (1946)|treaty with Britain of 22 March 1946]].{{sfn|Wright|1951|pp= 439–460}}

On 29 November 1947, the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] was passed, envisaging the creation of separate Jewish and Arab states operating under economic union with Jerusalem being transferred to UN trusteeship.&lt;ref&gt;{{wikisource-inline|United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, Colonial Secretary [[Arthur Creech Jones]] announced that the British Mandate would terminate on 15 May 1948.{{sfn|Jones|2016|p=296}}{{efn|group=qt|Creech Jones stated to the House of Commons: "Before the conclusion of the discussions, Sir Alexander Cadogan announced on behalf of the Government that the withdrawal of our Forces and administration would be effected by 1st August, 1948... It will be appreciated that the mandatory responsibility for government in Palestine cannot be relinquished piecemeal. The whole complex of governmental responsibilities must be relinquished by the Mandatory Government for the whole of Palestine on an appointed day. As I have indicated, once our military withdrawal is properly under way, the forces necessary for exercising this responsibility will no longer be adequately available, and it will not, therefore, be possible to retain full mandatory responsibility after a certain date. The Mandate will, therefore, be terminated some time in advance of the completion of the withdrawal, and the date we have in mind for this, subject to negotiation with the United Nations Commission, is 15th May.&lt;ref&gt;[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1947/dec/11/palestine Hansard, Palestine]: HC Deb 11 December 1947 vol 445 cc1207-318&lt;/ref&gt;}} On the last day of the Mandate, the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|creation of the State of Israel]] was proclaimed, and the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] began.

'''Carl Ludwig Patsch''', also '''Karl Ludwig Patsch''', {{lang-bg|'''Карл Пач'''}} (14 September 1865 in [[Kowatsch]] ({{lang-cs|[[Kovač (Jičín District)|Kovač]]}}) bei [[Jitschin]] {{ndash}} 21 February 1945 in [[Vienna]]) was an [[Austria]]n [[Slavist]], [[Albanologist]], archaeologist and historian.

Carl Patsch was born in north-east [[Bohemia]], as a son of Ludwig Patsch, a [[steward (office)|steward]] of an upper prince, but grew up in [[Maratschowka]] ({{lang-pl|[[Maraczówka]], Moraczówka}}, {{lang-uk|{{Interlanguage link multi|Марачівка|uk|3=Marachivka|lt=Maračivka}}}}) and [[Sławuta]] ({{lang-uk|[[Slavuta|Slavúta]]}}), [[Volhynia]].

'''Carroll Quigley''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|ɪ|g|l|i}}; November 9, 1910&amp;nbsp;– January 3, 1977) was an American [[historian]] and theorist of the [[Sociocultural evolution|evolution of civilizations]].  He is noted for his teaching work as a professor at [[Georgetown University]], for his academic publications, and for his research on the [[Round Table movement]].&lt;ref name="Obituary1977"&gt;{{cite news

== Life and career ==
Born in [[Boston]], Quigley attended [[Harvard University]], where he studied history and earned B.A, M.A., and Ph.D. degrees. He taught at [[Princeton University]], and then at Harvard, and then from 1941 to 1976 at the [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service|School of Foreign Service]] at [[Georgetown University]].&lt;ref name="Obituary1977" /&gt;

From 1941 until 1972, he taught a two-semester course at Georgetown on the development of civilizations.  According to his obituary in ''[[The Washington Star]]'', many alumni of Georgetown's [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service|School of Foreign Service]] asserted that this was "the most influential course in their undergraduate careers".&lt;ref name="Obituary1977" /&gt;

In addition to his academic work, Quigley served as a consultant to the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]], the [[United States Navy]], the [[Smithsonian Institution]], and the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] [[United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|Select Committee on Astronautics and Space Exploration]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Obituary1977" /&gt;  He was also a book reviewer for ''[[The Washington Star]]'', and a contributor and editorial board member of ''[[Current History]]''.&lt;ref name="McLemee1996" /&gt;{{rp|94}}

Quigley retired from Georgetown in June 1976 and died the following year.&lt;ref name="Obituary1977" /&gt;

===Major conclusions===
====Inclusive diversity====
Quigley's work emphasized inclusive diversity as a core value of [[Western culture|Western Civilization]],&lt;ref name="Quigley1966-1227/34"&gt;{{cite book|author= Carroll Quigley|title= Tragedy and hope: a history of the world in our time|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KQZxAAAAIAAJ|accessdate= 20 May 2013|year= 1966|publisher= Macmillan|pages= 1227–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; contrasting it with the [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] of [[Plato]].&lt;ref name="Quigley1966-84"&gt;{{cite book|author= Carroll Quigley|title= Tragedy and hope: a history of the world in our time|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KQZxAAAAIAAJ|accessdate= 20 May 2013|year= 1966|publisher= Macmillan|page= 84}}&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded the book ''[[Tragedy and Hope]]'' with the hope that the West could "resume its development along its old patterns of Inclusive Diversity".&lt;ref name="Quigley1966-1311"&gt;{{cite book|author= Carroll Quigley|title= Tragedy and hope: a history of the world in our time|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KQZxAAAAIAAJ|accessdate= 20 May 2013|year= 1966|publisher= Macmillan|page= 1311}}&lt;/ref&gt; From his study of history, "it is clear that the West believes in diversity rather than in uniformity, in pluralism rather than in monism or dualism, in inclusion rather than exclusion, in liberty rather than in authority, in truth rather than in power, in conversion rather than in annihilation, in the individual rather than in the organization, in reconciliation rather than in triumph, in heterogeneity rather than in homogeneity, in relativisms rather than in absolutes, and in approximations rather than in final answers."&lt;ref name="Quigley1966-1227"&gt;{{cite book|author= Carroll Quigley|title= Tragedy and hope: a history of the world in our time|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KQZxAAAAIAAJ|accessdate= 20 May 2013|year= 1966|publisher= Macmillan|page= 1227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quigley asserts that any intolerance or rigidity in the religious practices of the West are aberrations from its nature of inclusivity and diversity. Quigley points to the tolerance and flexibility in [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]]'s belief that theological truth is revealed over time through dialogue within the Christian community, which allows the community to adapt to a changing world.&lt;ref name="Aquinas2006"&gt;{{cite book|author= Thomas Aquinas|title= Summa Theologiae: Volume 1, Christian Theology: 1a. 1|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=C5SJBda4buUC&amp;pg=PA102|accessdate= 20 May 2013|date= 26 October 2006|publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn= 978-0-521-02909-4|pages= 102–}}, quoted on p1230 of Tragedy and Hope&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harry J Hogan, p18 of the foreword to {{cite book|author= Carroll Quigley|title= The evolution of civilizations: an introduction to historical analysis|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uyImAQAAMAAJ|accessdate= 26 May 2013|year= 1979|publisher= Liberty Press|isbn= 978-0-913966-56-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Institutionalization and the fall of civilizations====
Having studied the rise and fall of civilizations, "Quigley found the explanation of disintegration in the gradual transformation of social 'instruments' into '[[institution]]s,' that is, transformation of social arrangements functioning to meet real social needs into social institutions serving their own purposes regardless of real social needs".&lt;ref&gt;Harry J Hogan in the foreword (p17) and Quigley in the conclusion (p416) to {{cite book|author=Carroll Quigley|title= The evolution of civilizations: an introduction to historical analysis|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uyImAQAAMAAJ|accessdate= 26 May 2013|year= 1979|publisher= Liberty Press|isbn= 978-0-913966-56-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Weapons and democracy====
From a historical study of weapons and political dynamics, Quigley concludes that the characteristics of weapons are the main predictor of [[democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Foreword, written by historian [http://paw.princeton.edu/memorials/24/79/index.xml Harry J Hogan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901040610/http://paw.princeton.edu/memorials/24/79/index.xml |date=2013-09-01 }} in 1982, to Quigley's ''Weapons Systems and Political Stability''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also Chester G Starr, Review of ''Weapons Systems and Political Stability'', American Historical Review, Feb 1984, p98, available at [http://www.carrollquigley.net/book-reviews/Review-of-Weapons-Systems-Political-Stability-Starr.htm carrollquigley.net]&lt;/ref&gt; Democracy tends to emerge only when the best weapons available are easy for individuals to buy and use.&lt;ref name="Quigley1983-38"&gt;{{cite book|author= Carroll Quigley|title= Weapons systems and political stability: a history|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=L6e2AAAAIAAJ|accessdate= 20 May 2013|year= 1983|publisher= University Press of America|isbn= 978-0-8191-2947-5|pages= 38–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This explains why democracy occurs so rarely in human history.&lt;ref name="Quigley1983-307"&gt;{{cite book|author= Carroll Quigley|title= Weapons systems and political stability: a history|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=L6e2AAAAIAAJ|accessdate= 20 May 2013|year= 1983|publisher= University Press of America|isbn= 978-0-8191-2947-5|page= 307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1800s (peaking in the 1880s), guns were the best weapon available. In America, almost everyone could afford to buy a gun, and could learn how to use it fairly easily. Governments couldn't do any better: it became the age of mass armies of citizen soldiers with guns.&lt;ref name="Quigley1983-38"/&gt; (Similarly, Periclean Greece was an age of the citizen soldier and of democracy&lt;ref name="Quigley1983-307"/&gt;).

In the 1900s, expensive, specialist weapons (such as tanks and bombers) became available, and citizen soldiers became dominated by specialist soldiers.&lt;ref name="Quigley1983-58"&gt;{{cite book|author= Carroll Quigley|title= Weapons systems and political stability: a history|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=L6e2AAAAIAAJ|accessdate= 20 May 2013|year= 1983|publisher= University Press of America|isbn= 978-0-8191-2947-5|page= 58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quigley notes that the slaughter of [[World War I]] (1914-1918) was due to the mismatch between the traditional armies (citizen soldiers) and the available weapons ([[machine gun]]s used defensively).&lt;ref name="Quigley1983-53"&gt;{{cite book|author= Carroll Quigley|title= Weapons systems and political stability: a history|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=L6e2AAAAIAAJ|accessdate= 20 May 2013|year= 1983|publisher= University Press of America|isbn= 978-0-8191-2947-5|page= 53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Style===
Quigley's writing style is dense, influenced by a former history professor of his:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"As we raced along, Goethe was covered in fifteen minutes, Schiller in ten, Fichte in five...he covered any topic simply by slicing it up into a small number of parts and giving a name to each part. The complex character and achievement of Goethe, for example, were divided into six portions, each was given a title, and, ever after, the whole of Goethe could be evoked merely by reciting six words...I should like to outdare even my former professor by dividing this greater complexity &lt;nowiki&gt;[Classical culture]&lt;/nowiki&gt; into only five parts."&lt;ref&gt;Evolution of Civilizations, pp278-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quigley's analytical style is scientific, stemming from his earlier training in physics.&lt;ref&gt;foreword (by Harry J Hogan) to ''Evolution of Civilizations'', pp.13-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also ''Evolution of Civilizations'', chapter 1: Scientific Method and the Social Sciences&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In this book we are concerned with the social sciences...and particularly with the effort to apply a scientific method of observation, formulation of hypotheses, and testing to such phenomena. The enormous size of this field has made it advisable to curtail our attention to the process of social change, especially in civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;
''Evolution of Civilizations'', p.47
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Influence on Bill Clinton==
In his freshman year in the [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service|School of Foreign Service]] at [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]], future [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] took Quigley's course, receiving a 'B' as his final grade in both semesters (an excellent grade in a course where nearly half the students received D or lower).&lt;ref name="McLemee1996" /&gt;{{rp|94, 96}}

In 1991, Clinton named Quigley as an important influence on his aspirations and political philosophy, when Clinton launched his presidential campaign in a speech at Georgetown.&lt;ref name="McLemee1996" /&gt;{{rp|96}}  He mentioned Quigley again during his acceptance speech to the [[1992 Democratic National Convention]], as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As a teenager, I heard John Kennedy's summons to citizenship. And then, as a student at Georgetown, I heard that call clarified by a professor named Carroll Quigley, who said to us that America was the greatest Nation in history because our people had always believed in two things&amp;ndash;that tomorrow can be better than today and that every one of us has a personal moral responsibility to make it so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Bill Clinton|Clinton, Bill]]|title=Acceptance Speech|work= Democratic National Convention|location= New York, NY|date= July 16, 1992|url=http://www.4president.org/speeches/billclinton1992acceptance.htm|edition= Full text}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Quigley and the Round Table group ==
One distinctive feature of Quigley's [[History|historical writings]] is his assertion that the [[Round Table movement]] have played a significant role in recent world history.  His writing on this topic has made Quigley famous among many who investigate [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]].&lt;ref name="McLemee1996" /&gt;{{rp|96, 98}}

=== Quigley's claims about the Milner Group ===
In his book ''The Anglo-American Establishment: From Rhodes to Cliveden'' (written in 1949 and published posthumously in 1981),&lt;ref name="Quigley1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carroll Quigley|title=The Anglo-American Establishment: From Rhodes to Cliveden|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V19nAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 May 2013|publisher=Books in Focus, Incorporated|isbn=978-0-916728-50-2|year=1981}}, written in 1949 and published posthumously in 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Quigley purports to trace the history of a secret society (Round Table group) founded in 1891 by [[Cecil Rhodes]] and [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Alfred Milner]]. Quigley notes that "The organization was so modified and so expanded by Milner after the eclipse of Stead in 1899, and especially after the death of Rhodes in 1902, that it took on quite a different organization and character, although it continued to pursue the same goals."&lt;ref&gt;''The Anglo-American Establishment'', ch.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The society consisted of an inner circle ("The Society of the Elect") and an outer circle ("The Association of Helpers", also known as The Milner Kindergarten and the [[Round Table movement|Round Table Group]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://carrollquigley.net |title=The Anglo-American Establishment, ch.1 |page=5 }}]&lt;/ref&gt;  The society as a whole does not have a fixed name:

&lt;blockquote&gt; This society has been known at various times as [[Milner's Kindergarten]], as [[Round Table movement|the Round Table Group]], as the Rhodes crowd, as ''[[The Times]]'' crowd, as the [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls]] group, and as [[Cliveden set|the Cliveden set]]. ...  I have chosen to call it [[Milner group|the Milner group]]. Those persons who have used the other terms, or heard them used, have not generally been aware that all these various terms referred to the same Group...this Group is, as I shall show, one of the most important historical facts of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="QuigleyAAE"&gt;{{cite book

| isbn = 978-0-916728-50-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|ix}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quigley assigns this group primary or exclusive credit for several historical events:  the [[Jameson Raid]], the [[Second Boer War]], the founding of the [[Union of South Africa]], the replacement of the [[British Empire]] with the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and a number of Britain's foreign policy decisions in the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="QuigleyAAE" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

In 1966, Quigley published a one-volume history of the twentieth century, titled ''[[Tragedy and Hope]]''.  At several points in this book, the history of the Milner group is discussed.  Moreover, Quigley states that he has recently been in direct contact with this organization, whose nature he contrasts to right-wing claims of a communist conspiracy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This [[Radical right (United States)|radical Right]] fairy tale, which is now an accepted folk myth in many groups in America, pictured the recent history of the [[United States]], in regard to domestic reform and in foreign affairs, as a well-organized plot by extreme [[Left-wing politics|Left-wing]] elements&amp;nbsp;... This myth, like all fables, does in fact have a modicum of truth.  There does exist, and has existed for a generation, an international [[Anglophile]] network which operates, to some extent, in the way the Radical right believes the [[Communist party|Communists]] act.  In fact, this network, which we may identify as the [[Round Table movement|Round Table Groups]], has no aversion to cooperating with the Communists, or any other group, and frequently does so.  I know of the operation of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years, in the early 1960s, to examine its papers and secret records. I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have, for much of my life, been close to it and to many of its instruments.  I have objected, both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies... but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown, and I believe its role in [[history]] is significant enough to be known.&lt;ref name="QuigleyTAH"&gt;{{cite book

According to Quigley, the leaders of this group were [[Cecil Rhodes]] and [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Alfred Milner]] from 1891 until Rhodes' death in 1902, Milner alone until his own death in 1925, [[Lionel George Curtis|Lionel Curtis]] from 1925 to 1955, [[Robert Brand, 1st Baron Brand|Robert H. (Baron) Brand]] from 1955 to 1963, and [[Adam D. Marris]] from 1963 until the time Quigley wrote his book.  This organization also functioned through certain loosely affiliated "front groups", including the [[Chatham House|Royal Institute of International Affairs]], the [[Institute of Pacific Relations]], and the [[Council on Foreign Relations]].&lt;ref name="QuigleyTAH" /&gt;{{rp|132, 950–952}}

In addition, other secret societies are briefly discussed in ''Tragedy and Hope'', including a consortium of the leaders of the [[central bank]]s of several countries, who formed the [[Bank for International Settlements]].&lt;ref name="QuigleyTAH" /&gt;{{rp|323–324}}

=== Citations of Quigley in exposés of purported conspiracies ===
Soon after its publication, ''Tragedy and Hope'' caught the attention of authors interested in conspiracies.  They proceeded to publicize Quigley's claims, disseminating them to a much larger audience than his original readership.&lt;ref name="McLemee1996" /&gt;{{rp|96, 98}}

This began in 1970, when [[W. Cleon Skousen]] published ''The Naked Capitalist: A Review and Commentary on Dr. Carroll Quigley's Book "Tragedy and Hope"''.  The first third of this book consists of extensive excerpts from ''Tragedy and Hope'', interspersed with commentary by Skousen.  Skousen quotes Quigley's description of the activities of several groups&amp;nbsp;— the Milner Group, a [[cartel]] of [[International finance|international bankers]], the [[Communist party|Communist Party]], the [[Institute of Pacific Relations]], and the [[Council on Foreign Relations]].  According to Skousen's interpretation of Quigley's book, each of these is a facet of one large conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Edward Griffin]] released the documentary ''The Capitalist Conspiracy: An Inside View of International Banking'', crediting the Skousen book: "We wish to acknowledge that this film was insipred by Cleon Skousen's book, ''The Naked Capitalist'', which we believe is one of the most important documents of the decade."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|title=The Capitalist Conspiracy: An Inside View of International Banking (credit at 1m:39s)|people=Vol. 1|medium=Documentary|oclc=5558340|date=1971|publisher=American Media|url=https://archive.org/details/the_capitalist_conspiracy1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, [[Gary Allen]], a spokesman for the [[John Birch Society]], published ''None Dare Call It Conspiracy'', which became a [[bestseller]].  Allen cited Quigley's ''Tragedy and Hope'' as an authoritative source on conspiracies throughout his book.  Like Skousen, Allen understood the various conspiracies in Quigley's book to be branches of one large conspiracy, and also connected them to the [[Bilderberg Group|Bilderbergers]] and to [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Quigley is also cited by several other authors who assert the existence of powerful conspiracies.  [[Jim Marrs]], whose work was used as a source by [[Oliver Stone]] in his film ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', cites Quigley in his book ''Rule By Secrecy'', which describes a conspiracy linking the Milner Group, [[Skull and Bones]], the [[Trilateral Commission]], the [[Illuminati|Bavarian Illuminati]], the [[Knights Templar]], and [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] who posed as the [[Anunnaki|Sumerian gods]] thousands of years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

G. Edward Griffin relies heavily on Quigley for information about the role Milner's secret society plays in the Federal Reserve in his book ''The Creature from Jekyll Island:  A Second Look at the Federal Reserve''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Quigley was dismissive of the authors who used his writings to support theories of a world domination conspiracy. Of W. Cleon Skousen's ''The Naked Capitalist'' he stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Skousen's book is full of misrepresentations and factual errors. He claims that I have written of a conspiracy of the super-rich who are pro-Communist and wish to take over the world and that I'm a member of this group. But I never called it a conspiracy and don't regard it as such. I'm not an "insider" of these rich persons, although Skousen thinks so. I happen to know some of them and liked them, although I disagreed with some of the things they did before 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On Gary Allen's ''None Dare Call It Conspiracy'' he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;They thought Dr. Carroll Quigley proved everything. For example, they constantly misquote me to this effect: that Lord Milner (the dominant trustee of the Cecil Rhodes Trust and a heavy in the Round Table Group) helped finance the Bolsheviks. I have been through the greater part of Milner's private papers and have found no evidence to support that.

Further, ''None Dare Call It Conspiracy'' insists that international bankers were a single bloc, were all powerful and remain so today. I, on the contrary, stated in my book that they were much divided, often fought among themselves, had great influence but not control of political life and were sharply reduced in power about 1931-1940, when they became less influential than monopolized industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Criticism ===
In ''Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler'', the Hoover institution scholar [[Antony C. Sutton]] stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Quigley goes a long way to provide evidence for the ''existence'' of the power elite, but does not penetrate the ''operations'' of the elite. Possibly, the papers used by Quigley had been vetted, and did not include documentation on elitist manipulation of such events as the Bolshevik Revolution, Hitler's accession to power, and the election of Roosevelt in 1933. More likely, these political manipulations may not be recorded at all in the files of the power groups. They may have been unrecorded actions by a small ad hoc segment of the elite. It is noteworthy that the documents used by this author came from government sources, recording the day-to-day actions of Trotsky, Lenin, Roosevelt, Hitler, J.P. Morgan and the various firms and banks involved.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reformed-theology.org/html/books/wall_street/chapter_12.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[F. William Engdahl]], in an overview of financial imperialism entitled ''The Gods of Money'', criticized Quigley for stating that the power of international bankers declined in the 1930s, and insofar as the influence of international bankers in America was concerned, suggested that Quigley was confusing "international finance" with Morgan interests. He suggested, like Sutton, that Quigley's papers had been vetted. Engdahl argued that it was not the case that the power of "international finance" declined, but rather, Morgan interests fell and were replaced by Rockefeller interests.&lt;ref&gt;Engdahl, F. William. ''The Gods of Money: Wall Street and the Death of the American Century''. Wiesbaden, Germany: Edition.engdahl, 2009. pp. 81-135&lt;/ref&gt;

Quigley stated that the intentions and objectives of the group he profiled, associated with [[Wall Street]] and the [[City of London]] and [[Cecil Rhodes]]' super-imperialism, were "largely commendable". Members of the group, in statements recorded by the ''New York Times'' in 1902, proclaimed that they formed their society for the purpose of "gradually absorbing the wealth of the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1902/04/09/101945773.pdf | work=The New York Times | title=MR.

Quigley argued that the Round Table groups were not World Government advocates but super-imperialists. He stated that they emphatically did not want the League of Nations to become a World Government. Yet [[Lionel George Curtis|Lionel Curtis]], who, according to Quigley, was one of the leaders of the Round Table movement, wished for it to be a World government with teeth, writing articles with [[H. G. Wells|H.&amp;nbsp;G. Wells]] urging this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/19jan/leag119.htm|magazine=The Atlantic|title=The Idea of a League of Nations|date=January 1919|first=Herbert George|last=Wells|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christian views on the [[classics]]''' have varied widely throughout history.

==Early period==
When Christianity at first appeared in [[Rome]], introduced by [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]], the instruction of youth was largely confined to the basics of reading, writing and mathematics followed by the study of grammar, rhetoric, philosophy, and history.  Much of the history was in verse; chief among which were the works of [[Horace]] and [[Virgil]]. Until the [[peace of the Church]], early in the fourth century, the value and use of classical studies were unquestioned. Converts to Christianity brought with them such mental cultivation as they had received while [[paganism|pagans]]. They used their knowledge of [[mythology]] and ancient traditions as a means of attacking paganism. [[Tertullian]] forbade Christians to teach, but admitted that school attendance by Christian pupils was unavoidable.&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, ''De idolatria'', 10&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arnobius]],&lt;ref&gt;Arnobius, ''Adversus nationes'', II, 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lactantius]], and Cassianus&lt;ref&gt;Prudentius, ''Liber Peristephanon'', 9&lt;/ref&gt; were classical Christian teachers.&lt;ref&gt;De Rossi, ''Roma Sotterranea'', II, 810&lt;/ref&gt;

During the fourth century the value of secular literature began to be questioned by [[Bible|Biblical scholars]]. This opposition is condensed in the accepted translation, dating from [[Jerome]] from [[Psalm]] 70:15-16  ''Quoniam non cognovi litteraturam, introibo in potentias Domini; Domine memorabor justitiae tuae solius''. (Because I have not known learning I will enter into the powers of the LORD: O LORD I will be mindful of thy justice alone.[[Douay-Rheims]] 1899) The opposition between [[divine judgement]] and literature became gradually an accepted Christian idea.

Later persecution under [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] led Christian writers to express more definitely their views on the subject. It produced little effect in the West. However, [[Marius Victorinus]], one of the most distinguished professors in Rome, chose "to give up the idle talk of the school rather than the Word of God."&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''Confessions'', VIII, 5&lt;/ref&gt; Thenceforth, Christians studied more closely and more appreciatively their own literature, i.e., the Biblical writings. Jerome discovers therein a Horace, a [[Catullus]] and an [[Alcaeus of Messene|Alcaeus]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, ''Epistle 30''&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''De doctrina christiana'' Augustine shows how the Scriptures could be turned to account for the study of [[eloquence]]; he analyses periods of the prophet [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]], of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], and shows excellent examples of rhetorical figures in the Pauline Epistles.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''De doctrina christiana'', IV, 6-7&lt;/ref&gt; It would seem that the Church, therefore, ought to have given up the study of pagan literature. It did not do so. Augustine suggested his method only to those who wished to become priests, and even for these he did mean to make it obligatory. Men of less marked ability were to use the ordinary method of instruction. The ''De doctrina christiana'' was written in 427, at which time his advancing age and the increasing strictness of monastic life might have inclined Augustine to a rigorous solution. Jerome's scruples and the dream he relates in one of his letters are quite well known. In this dream he saw angels scourging him and saying: "Thou art not a Christian, thou art a Ciceronian."&lt;ref&gt;Paul, ''Epistle 25''&lt;/ref&gt; He finds fault with ecclesiastics who find too keen a pleasure in the reading of Virgil; he adds, nevertheless, that youths are indeed compelled to study him.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, ''Epistle 21''&lt;/ref&gt; In his quarrel with [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]] he declares that he has not read the profane authors since he left school, "but I admit that I read them while there. Must I then drink the waters of [[Lethe]] that I may forget?"&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, ''Adv. Ruf.'', I, 30&lt;/ref&gt;

In defending himself the first figure that occurs to him is taken from mythology. What these eminent men desired was not so much the separation but the combination of the treasures of profane literature and of Christian truth. Jerome recalls the precept of [[Deuteronomy]]: "If you desire to marry a captive, you must first shave her head and eyebrows, shave the hair on her body and cut her nails, so must it be done with profane literature, after having removed all that was earthly and idolatrous, unite with her and make her fruitful for the Lord."&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, ''Epistle 83''&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine uses another Biblical allegory. For him, the Christian who seeks his knowledge in the pagan authors resembles the [[Israelite]]s who despoil the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] of their treasures in order to build the tabernacle of God. As to [[Ambrose]], he has no doubts whatever. He quotes quite freely from [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], Virgil, and the ''Consolatio'' of [[Servius Sulpicius Rufus|Servius Sulpicius]]. He accepts the earlier view handed down from the Hebrew apologists to their Christian successors, viz., that whatever is good in the literature of antiquity comes from the Sacred Books. [[Pythagoras]] was a Jew or, at least, had read [[Moses]]. The pagan poets owe their flashes of wisdom to [[David]] and [[Job (Biblical figure)|Job]]. [[Tatian]], following earlier Jews had learnedly confirmed this view, and it recurs, more or less developed, in the other Christian apologists. In the West [[Minucius Felix]] gathered carefully into his ''Octavius'' whatever seemed to show harmony between the new doctrine and ancient learning. This was a convenient argument and served more than one purpose.

But this concession presupposed that pagan studies were subordinate to Christian truth, the "Hebraica veritas". In the second book of his ''[[De doctrina christiana]]'', Augustine explains how pagan classics lead to a more perfect apprehension of the Scriptures, and are indeed an introduction to them. In this sense Jerome, in a letter to Magnus, professor of eloquence at Rome, recommends the use of profane authors; profane literature is a captive.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''Epistle 85''&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, men neither dared nor were able to do without classical teaching. Rhetoric continued to inspire a kind of timid reverence. The [[panegyric|panegyrists]], for example, do not trouble themselves about the [[Roman Emperor|emperor's]] religion, but addressed him as pagans would a pagan and draw their literary embellishments from mythology. [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]] himself did not dare to exclude pagan authors from the school. A professor like [[Ausonius]] pursued the same methods as his pagan predecessors. [[Magnus Felix Ennodius]], deacon of Milan under [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]] and later Bishop of [[Pavia]], inveighed against the impious person who carried a statue of [[Minerva]] to a disorderly house, and himself under pretext of an "epithalamium" wrote light and trivial verses. It is true that Christian society at the time of the [[migration period|barbarian invasions]] repudiated mythology and ancient culture, but it did not venture to completely banish them. In the meantime the public schools of antiquity were gradually closed. Private teaching took their place but even that formed its pupils, e.g. [[Sidonius Apollinaris]], according to the traditional method. Christian asceticism, however, developed a strong feeling against secular studies. As early as the fourth century [[Martin of Tours]] finds that men have better things to do than study. There are lettered monks at [[Lérins Abbey|Lérins]], but their scholarship is a relic of their early education, not acquired after their monastic profession. The [[Rule of Benedict]] prescribes reading, it is true, but only sacred reading. [[Gregory the Great]] condemns the study of literature so far as bishops are concerned. [[Isidore of Seville]] condenses all ancient culture into a few data gathered into his ''Origines'', just enough to prevent all further study in the original sources. [[Cassiodorus]] alone shows a far wider range and makes possible a deeper and broader study of letters. His encyclopedic grasp of human knowledge links him with the best literary tradition of pagan antiquity. He planned a close union of secular and sacred science whence ought to issue a complete and truly Christian method of teaching. Unfortunately the invasions of the barbarians followed and the ''Institutiones'' of Cassiodorus remained a mere project.

==Medieval period==
About the middle of the sixth century, the first indication of classical culture were seen in [[Great Britain|Britain]], and,  towards the close of the century, in [[Ireland]]. Irish scholars and then teachers, created a culture which the Anglo-Saxons developed. This culture placed literature and [[science]] at the service of [[theology]] and [[exegesis]]. They devoted themselves chiefly to grammar, rhetoric, and dialectics.

It is quite unlikely that manuscripts had been brought to Ireland between 350 and 450, to bring about a much later literary renaissance. The small ecclesiastical schools almost everywhere preserved elementary teaching, reading and writing. Irish scholarship went far beyond that.

During the sixth and seventh centuries, manuscripts were still being copied in continental Europe. The writing of this period is [[uncial]] or semi-uncial. Even after eliminating fifth- century manuscripts there still remains a fair number of manuscripts in this style of writing. We find among these works practical information: glossaries, treatises on [[surveying|land-surveying]], [[medicine]], the [[veterinary medicine|veterinary art]], [[jurisprudence|juridical]] commentaries.

On the other hand, the numerous ecclesiastical manuscripts prove the persistence of certain scholarly traditions. The continuations of sacred studies sufficed to bring about the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. It was likewise a purely ecclesiastical culture which the Irish brought back to the continent in the sixth and seventh centuries. The chief aim of these Irish monks was to preserve and develop religious life. When the scattered items of information are examined, especially the hagiological indications, their importance is peculiarly diminished, for the teaching in question generally concerns Scripture or theology. Even [[Columbanus]] does not seem to have organized literary studies in his monasteries. The Irish monks had a personal culture which they did not make any effort to diffuse, owing to the great distance between centers of learning. Moreover, the disciples of the Irish were men enamoured of ascetic mortification, who shunned an evil world and sought a life of prayer and penance. For such minds, beauty of language and verbal rhythm were frivolous attractions. The material equipment of the Irish religious establishments in Gaul scarcely admitted any other study than that of the Scriptures. Generally these establishments were but a group of huts surrounding a small chapel.

Thus, until [[Charlemagne]] and [[Alcuin]], intellectual life was confined to Great Britain and Ireland. It was revived in [[Gaul]] in the eighth century, when the classic Latin literature was again studied.  Pagan authors were read as secondary to Scripture and theology. Even towards the close of his life, Alcuin forbade his monks to read Virgil. [[Statius]] is the favourite poet, and, before long, [[Ovid]], whose licentiousness is glossed over by allegorical interpretation. Mediocre abstracts and compilations, products of academic decadence, appear among the books frequently read, e.g. [[Homerus latinus]] (''Ilias Latina''), [[Dictys]], [[Dares]], the distichs ascribed to [[Cato the Younger|Cato]]. Cicero is almost overlooked, and two distinct personages are made of Tullius and Cicero. There were a number of classical authors studied until the thirteenth century.

At the close of the twelfth century, in the early years of the University of Paris, the principal known authors are: Statius, Virgil, Lucian, Juvenal, Horace, Ovid (with exception of the erotic poems and the satires), Sallust, Cicero, Martial, Petronius (judged as combining useful information and dangerous passages), Symmachus, Solinus, Sidonius, Suetonius, Quintus Curtius, Justin (known as Trogus Pompeius), Livy, the two Senecas (including the tragedies), Donatus Priscian, Boethius, Quintilian, Euclid, and Ptolemy. In the thirteenth century the influence of Aristotle restricted the field of reading.

There are, however, a few real Humanists among the medieval writers. Einhard (770-840), Rabanus Maurus (776-856), the ablest scholar of his time, and Walafrid Strabo (809-849) are men of extensive and disinterested learning. Servatus Lupus, Abbot of Ferrières (805-862), in his quest for Latin manuscripts labours as zealously as any scholar of the fifteenth century. At a later period Latin literature is represented by Remigius of Auxerre (d. 908), Gerbert (later Pope Sylvester II d. 1003), Liutprand of Cremona (d. about 972), John of Salisbury (1110–1180), Vincent of Beauvais (d. 1264), and Roger Bacon (d. 1294).

Medieval Latin poetry drew its inspiration from Latin poetry. Among the imitations must be mentioned the works of Hroswitha (or Roswitha), Abbess of Gandersheim (close of the tenth century), whom Virgil, Prudentius, and Sedulius inspired to celebrate the acts of Otho the Great. She is of particular interest in the history of the survival of Latin literature, because of her comedies after the manner of Terence. It has been said that she wished to cause the pagan author to be totally forgotten. This statement is not reconcilable with her known simplicity of character. A certain facility in the dialogue and clearness of style do not offset the lack of ideas in her writings. They exhibit the fate of classical culture in the Middle Ages. Hroswitha imitates Terence, indeed but without understanding him, and in a ridiculous manner. The poems on actual life of Hugh of Orléans known as "Primas" or "[[Archpoet|Archipoeta]]" are far superior and betray genuine talent as well as an intelligent grasp of Horace.

&lt;!---probably should be merged with the above material---&gt;
During the Middle Ages the Church preserved secular literature by harboring and copying its works in monasteries, where valuable libraries existed as early as the ninth century:
*in Italy, at [[Monte Cassino]] (founded in 529), and at [[Bobbio]] founded in 612 by Columbanus);
*in Germany at [[Saint Gall]] (614), [[Reichenau Island|Reichenau]] (794), [[Fulda]] (744), [[Lorsch]] (763), [[Hersfeld]] (768), [[Corvey]] (822), [[Hirschau]] (8430);
*in France at St. [[Martin of Tours]] (founded in 372, but later restored), Fleury or [[Saint-Benoît-sur-Loire]] (620), [[Ferrières Abbey|Ferrières]] (630), [[Corbie]] (662), [[Cluny]] (910).

The reforms of Cluny and later of [[Clairvaux Abbey|Clairvaux]] were not favourable to studies. The chief aim of the reformers was to combat the secular spirit and re-establish strict religious observances. This influence is in harmony with the tendencies of scholasticism. Consequently, from the twelfth century and especially the thirteenth, the copying of manuscripts became a secular business, a source of gain. The following is a list of the most ancient or most useful manuscripts of the Latin classics for the Middle Ages:
*Eighth-ninth centuries: [[Cicero]]'s Orations, [[Horace]], the philosopher [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Martial]].
*Ninth century: [[Terence]], [[Lucretius]], [[Cicero]], [[Sallust]], [[Livy]], [[Ovid]], [[Lucan]], [[Valerius Maximus]], [[Columella]], [[Persius]], the philosopher [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Quintus Curtius]], the [[Thebaid]] of [[Statius]], [[Silius Italicus]], [[Pliny the Younger]], [[Juvenal]], [[Tacitus]], [[Suetonius]], [[Florus]], [[Claudian]].
*Ninth-Tenth centuries: Persius, Quintus Curtius, [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], Cicero, Horace, Livy, [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]], Lucan, the philosopher Seneca, [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]], Martial, [[Justin (historian)|Justin]], [[Ammianus Marcellinus]].
*Tenth century: Caesar [[Catullus]], Cicero, Sallust, [[Lio]], Ovid, Lucan, Persius, Quintus Curtius, Pliny the Elder, [[Quintilian]], Statius, Juvenal.
*Eleventh century: Caesar, Sallust, Livy, Ovid, Tacitus, [[Apuleius]].
*Thirteenth century: [[Cornelius Nepos]], [[Propertius]], [[Varro]], "De lingua latina".

This list is incomplete. An author like Quintus Curtius is represented by numerous manuscripts in every century. Another, like Lucretius, was not copied anew between the ninth century and the Renaissance. Moreover, it was customary to compile manuscripts of epitomes and anthologies, some of which have preserved the only extant fragments of ancient authors. The teaching of grammar was deficient. This may account for the backwardness of philological science in the Middle Ages. Latin grammar is reduced to an abridgment of Donatius, supplemented by the meagre commentaries of the teacher, and replaced since the thirteenth century by the "Doctrinale" of Alexander de Villedieu (de Villa Dei).

The '''City Museum''' (Museo de la Ciudad) is a museum in the colonial center of [[Quito]], Ecuador. It is located on Garcia Moreno Street, between Morales and Rocafuerte.&lt;ref name="El Comercio"&gt;{{cite news|title=Un relato vivo en el San Juan de Dios|url=http://www.elcomercio.com/actualidad/quito/relato-vivo-san-juan-de.html|accessdate=11 May 2015|publisher=El Comercio|date=17 March 2012|location=Quito, Ecuador|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The museum was founded in 1998 and occupies the buildings of what was once the [[San Juan de Dios Hospital (Quito)|San Juan de Dios Hospital]].&lt;ref name="El Telégrafo"&gt;{{cite web|title=El primer hospital de Quito exhibe su historia|url=http://www.telegrafo.com.ec/noticias/quito/item/el-primer-hospital-de-quito-exhibe-su-historia.html|publisher=El Telégrafo|accessdate=11 May 2015|location=Quito, Ecuador|language=Spanish|date=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The buildings were designated as a [[UNESCO]] Cultural [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref name="El Universo"&gt;{{cite news|title=Histórico hospital San Juan de Dios vuelve a la vida en un libro de médico|url=http://www.eluniverso.com/2004/02/10/0001/257/F8F21070BE694E3F9C83F231FC9C2247.html|accessdate=11 May 2015|agency=EFE|publisher=El Universo|date=10 February 2004|location=Quito, Ecuador|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were restored in 1995 using the same materials as the original buildings to repair damaged areas.  Ancient stone [[Doric columns]], stone doorways and stone coverings in the patios are a highlight of the architecture.&lt;ref name="El Comercio" /&gt;

A '''coin wrapper''', sometimes known as a '''bank roll''' or '''roll''', is a paper or plastic container for a number of coins.

In the [[United States]], empty rolls are available free at most banks in every denomination (though it is becoming increasingly difficult for [[Half dollar (United States coin)|half dollar]] and [[United States dollar coin|dollar]] to be readily made available).
The rolls come flat and one side will have to be folded to allow for coins to be placed inside. When the roll is full, the top side will need to be folded. Typically, the full rolls are brought back to the banks in exchange for currency or to be deposited.

In the [[Eurozone]], empty plastic rolls are used at  banks in every denomination, with five-coin staggered rows. Their main advantages are:
;Reliability: Their five-coin staggered rows and transparency make quick verification of contents possible.
;Certainty: They provide a high degree of certainty (transparency, reliable and legible contents).
;Efficiency : The high certainty means less time spent processing coins, while the solidity and two-way closure system increase the number of times the coin roll can be used, effectively reducing its overall cost.

In [[Japan]], machine-wrapped, plastic coin rolls are circulated almost exclusively, as handmade coin rolls are rare. Each roll holds 50 coins. Customers can change bills into coin rolls easily using automatic money changers at Japanese banks.

In the [[United Kingdom]], coin rolls are not used. Instead, small plastic bags are provided free of charge at banks which are filled by the customer with the appropriate number of the same value coin as printed on the bag. When depositing or changing, the bags are weighed at the bank to check they contain the right number.

==Searching rolls==
Often, coin collectors will ask for full rolls from the bank to search the contents in hopes of finding an interesting piece. Some collectors also save coins of bullion value, such as [[copper]] cents and [[silver]] [[half-dollar]]s. This practice is called [[coin roll hunting]]. It is also known as cherry picking. Full rolls are also requested by vendors to make change.

==Fraud==
Bank rolls are vulnerable to a variety of scams, such as rolling slugs of no value or coins of a lesser value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Deborah |last=Medenbach |date=July 22, 2009 |title=Penny Scam Yields Dime Profits in New Paltz |newspaper=[[Times Herald-Record]] |url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090722/NEWS/907229991|accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  See also [[coin rolling scams]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10931">The '''County of Pallars''' or '''Pallás'''&lt;ref&gt;The rare alternative spelling is a [[Castilian language|Castilian]] variant employed by, for example, [[Gerónimo Zurita]] in his ''[[Anales de la corona de Aragón]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ca|Comtat de Pallars}}, {{IPA-ca|kumˈtad də pəˈʎas|IPA}}; {{lang-la|Comitatus Pallariensis}}) was a ''de facto'' independent petty state, nominally within the [[Carolingian Empire]] and then [[West Francia]] during the ninth and tenth centuries, perhaps one of the [[Catalan counties]],&lt;ref&gt;Whether it is referred to as a part of [[Catalonia]] or not depends on the author. Lewis, ''passim'', treats it as independent of Catalonia proper.&lt;/ref&gt; originally part of the [[Marca Hispanica]] in the ninth century. It was coterminous with the upper [[Noguera Pallaresa]] valley from the crest of the [[Pyrenees]] to the village of [[Tremp]], comprising the [[Vall d'Àneu]], [[Vall de Cardós]], [[Vall Ferrera]], the right bank of the [[Noguera Ribagorçana]], and the valley of the [[Flamicell]]. It roughly corresponded with the historic region of Catalonia called Pallars. Its chief city was [[Sort, Lleida|Sort]]. 

==Carolingian foundations==
The early history of Pallars, which was the easternmost extent of [[Basque people|Basque]] settlement,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1965|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is linked to that of its western neighbour, [[Ribagorza]]. Both territories, nominally lands of the [[Moors]], came under the sway of the count of Toulouse perhaps as early as 781,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1965|p=40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps as late as the start of the 9th century. They formed in turn a new province attached to Toulouse and therefore became Carolingian vassals. 

A widely circulated monkish account of 1078 from the [[Abbey of Santa María de Alaón]] contains the earliest foundation myth of any of the counties of the Hispanic March. Written at a time when the independence of Pallars and Ribagorza was threatened by the hegemony recently created by the [[personal union]] of the [[Kingdom of Navarre]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon]] (1076). It records that Count Bernard and Bishop Ato, both of Ribagorza and descended by tradition from [[Charlemagne]], spearheaded the conquest and repopulation of [[Sobrarbe]] and Pallars respectively and that the bishop held ecclesiastical rule over all three counties. 

[[File:Pallars.svg|thumb|Location of the County of Pallars within [[Catalonia]].]]

In reality, being so far from the centres of [[Carolingian]] power, it was easy for the rulers of Toulouse to act as sovereigns in Pallars and Ribagorza, granting privileges to monasteries in a style very similar to that of their own [[Franks|Frankish]] lords. Two monasteries were founded in the valleys of the two principal rivers of Pallars: [[Gerri]] by the Noguera Pallaresa and [[Senterada]] by the Flamicell on land granted by the emperor [[Louis the Pious]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1965|pp=48&amp;ndash;49}}. The [[Abbey of Santa María de Alaón]] on the right bank of the Noguera Ribagorzana river was, and is, in Ribagorza, not Pallars.&lt;/ref&gt; The revival of monasticism was largely associated with non-Frankish and especially [[Visigothic]] clergymen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1965|p=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charlemagne]] himself, however, attached Pallars and Ribagorza ecclesiastically to the [[diocese of Urgell]]. In 817, Pallars and Ribagorza were made a part of the [[Kingdom of Aquitaine]] bestowed on the young [[Pepin I of Aquitaine|Pepin]], second son of the emperor Louis the Pious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1965|p=44}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the ninth century, the ''[[aprisio]]'' had increasingly become a principal form of land division and ownership in Pallars, which was not yet [[Feudalism|feudalised]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1965|p=73}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Louis the Pious forbade the holding ''in beneficium'' of church property and by the end of the ninth century, most ''aprisiones'' in Pallars had been converted into [[allod]]s: feudalism was never to take hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1965|p=168}}. Lewis, 264, says that up to 95% of the land in Pallars in the late tenth century was allodial.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rejection of Frankish suzerainty==
The local population &amp;mdash; Basque, Visigothic, and [[Hispano-Roman]] &amp;mdash; rejected the rule of the [[house of Toulouse]]. In 833, one [[Aznar I Galíndez|Aznar Galíndez]],&lt;ref&gt;Or Asnar Galí, possibly a Frank or a Basque.&lt;/ref&gt; already [[Count of Urgell]] and [[Count of Cerdagne|Cerdagne]], usurped the ''pagi'' (countries) of Pallars and Ribagorza. He was immediately dispossessed of Urgell and Cerdagne by Louis the Pious (in 834), but managed to hold out in mountainous Pallars and Ribagorza for several more years--until he was expelled, either in 838 by [[Sunifred I, Count of Barcelona]], and partisans of [[Bernard of Septimania]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1965|pp=96&amp;ndash;97}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or in 844 by the [[Count of Toulouse]], [[Fredelon of Toulouse|Fredelon]].

Opposition to Toulousain suzerainty remained, however, while the Toulousain counts governed Pallars through [[viscount]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1965|p=118}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Pallars, [[vicar]]s were not employed, rather a minor official beneath the viscount called the ''[[centenarius]]'' was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1965|p=120}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 872, a crisis enveloped Toulouse when the incumbent count, [[Bernard II of Toulouse|Bernard II]], was assassinated by the ''fideles'' (faithful men) of [[Bernard Plantapilosa]], who was recognised as the late count's successor by the king, [[Charles the Bald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1965|p=110}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The men of Pallars and Ribagorza took the opportunity to regain their independence from Toulouse. One of them, a local [[cacique]] named [[Raymond I of Ribagorza|Raymond]], who had probably originally held them as a subject of Toulouse, found himself count of the territories formerly of Toulouse south of the Pyrenees: the first Count of Pallars and Ribagorza.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1965}}. Pallars and Ribagorza were not even nominally attached to Francia.&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of Pallars and Ribagorza to Frankish suzerainty was the first step in the gradual weakening of the ties between Catalonia and the Francia. 

The reign of Raymond I began with overtures of peace and alliance with the Muslim governors of nearby [[Huesca]] and [[Zaragoza]] (then under the [[Banu Qasi]]), but to no avail; by the end, a policy of [[Reconquista]] had been adopted. The reign also saw a proliferation ([[encastellation]]) of ''turres'' (defensive towers) in Pallars and Ribagorza;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1965|pp=131&amp;ndash;132}}.&lt;/ref&gt; castles such as [[Leovalles]], [[Castellous]], and [[Lemignano]] also multiplied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1965|pp=229&amp;ndash;230}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Raymond also consolidated his ''de facto'' independence from any superior authority by creating a new [[diocese of Pallars]], enabling himself to control the local church. Raymond, a Basque himself,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1965|pp=112 n104}}.&lt;/ref&gt; established an alliance with the [[Jiménez dynasty]] in [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]], helping them to take the throne. He lost much of Ribagorza to Huesca in 907 and thereafter ruled mainly just Pallars, which had always been his political base. He died in 920. Pallars was inherited by his two youngest (of four) sons, [[Isarn, Count of Pallars|Isarn]] and [[Lope I of Pallars]].

==Tenth-century obscurity==
The history of Pallars in the tenth century is obscure. It was ruled by brothers of the native dynasty, which had married into the [[Bellonids|Bellonid dynasty]] ruling in [[County of Barcelona|Barcelona]]. Pallars and Ribagorza had experienced a constant decline as brother and cousins divided it up,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1965|p=208}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the phrase ''in rem valentem'' appearing in charters indicates a transition from a money to a barter economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1965|p=173}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By late in the tenth century, the counts of Pallars, still refusing to recognise any authority higher than themselves, began using the title ''[[margrave|marchio]]'' in documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1965|p=199}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By 975, their underlings, the {{lang|la|milites}} (knights) who governed the countryside from the castles, levied dues, formerly Carolingian royal dues, on the inhabitants for the upkeep of defence, and to line their personal coffers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1965|p=239}}. By 1010, ''[[bannum]] et placitos, parados et albergos et servicios'' and ''[[conscription|hostem]] et [[cavalcade]]m'' were all levied on the citizens of the countryside around a castle in Pallars, according to Lewis, 313.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, a steady advance was made in the borderlands; many charters make reference to land acquired ''de ruptura'' along in line settlement along the frontier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1965|p=272}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

When [[Sunyer I of Pallars|Sunyer I]], who had outlived his brothers and nephews, and died in 1011, the once independent Pallars, through subdivision of authority, had become subject to influences from Urgell, [[Barcelona]], and [[County of Aragon|Aragon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1965|p=340}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sunyer's two sons divided their inheritance, with [[Raymond III of Pallars Jussà|Raymond III]] ruling in [[County of Pallars Jussà|Pallars Jussà]] and [[William II of Pallars Sobirà|William II]] in [[County of Pallars Sobirà|Pallars Sobirà]].

'''Dantès Bellegarde''' (18 May 1877 – 16 June 1966) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agh.qc.ca/genea/index.jss?lang=fr&amp;action=liste&amp;lettre=BELLEGARDE Association de Genealogie d'Haiti]&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Haiti]]an historian and diplomat. He is best known for his works ''Histoire du Peuple Haïtien'' (1953), ''La Résistance Haïtienne'' (1937), ''Haïti et ses Problèmes'' (1943), and ''Pour une Haïti Heureuse'' (1928–1929).

==Early years==
Bellegarde was born in [[Port-au-Prince]] to a poor mulatto family. His impoverished but small bourgeoisie background descended from several historical figures in Haiti's history. His maternal great-grandfather Jacques Ignace-Fresnal was an officer in the army and Haiti's first Minister of Justice, and founder of Haitian Freemasonry.  His paternal grandfather, General Jean-Louis Bellegarde, was a former Governor of Port-au-Prince.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/gah/bellegarde-dantes-1877-1966#sthash.d1fnE5eb.dpuf |title=Bellegarde, Dantès (1877-1966) |publisher=Black Past |accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Bellegarde served as [[Minister Plenipotentiary]] to [[Paris]] in 1921 and to [[Washington, D.C.]], in 1930.

==Honours==
He was bestowed by [[France]] as commander of the [[Legion of Honour]] and was holder of the Office of Public Instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uTiEe2g56d4C&amp;pg=PA553&amp;lpg=PA553&amp;dq=Fran%C3%A7ois+Fournier+de+Pescay&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gBxiZrmfah&amp;sig=ejGDch0TZvqHbdPCvW6IrvdM3Ow&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oqIEVeu3D4qmgwSypYLoBw&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&amp;q=Fran%C3%A7ois%20Fournier%20de%20Pescay&amp;f=false |title=World's Great Men of Color, Volume 2 |author= Rogers, J.A. |page=555 |publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company |year=1996 |isbn=9780684815824|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20939">{{EarlyBuddhism}}
The term '''Early Buddhism''' can refer to two distinct periods, both of which are covered in a separate article:
* [[Pre-sectarian Buddhism]], which refers to the Teachings and monastic organization and structure, founded by [[Gautama Buddha]]. [[Lambert Schmithausen]] (1987): "the canonical period prior to the development of different schools with their different positions."&lt;ref&gt;Schmithausen (1987) “Part I: Earliest Buddhism,” Panels of the VIIth World Sanskrit Conference Vol. II: Earliest Buddhism and Madhyamaka, ed. David Seyfort Ruegg and Lambert Schmithausen, Leiden: Kern Institute, pp. 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt; 

* The [[Early Buddhist schools]], into which pre-sectarian Buddhism split (without formal schisms, in the sense of [[Vinaya]]).

==Time-span==
The period of "Early Buddhism" in the sense of pre-sectarian Buddhism is considered by scholars such as Paul J. Griffiths and Steven Collins to be from the time of the historical Buddha to the reign of [[Ashoka]] (c. 268 to 232 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, Paul J. (1983) “Buddhist Jhana: A Form-Critical Study”, Religion 13, pp. 55–68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Steven (1990) “On the Very Idea of the Pali Canon”, Journal of the Pali Text Society 15, pp. 89–126.&lt;/ref&gt; Lamotte and Hirakawa both maintain that the first schism in the Buddhist sangha occurred during the reign of Ashoka.&lt;ref&gt;Lamotte, Étienne (1988) History of Indian Buddhism: From the Origins to the Maka Era, translated
from the French by Sara Webb-Boin, Louvain: Peeters Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hirakawa, Akira (1990) A History of Indian Buddhism: From MAkyamuni to Early MahAyAna, tr. Paul Groner, University of Hawaii Press&lt;/ref&gt; 

The various splits within the monastic organization went together with the introduction and emphasis on [[Abhidhamma|Abhidhammic literature]] by some schools. This literature was specific to each school, and arguments and disputes between the schools were often based on these Abhidhammic writings. However, actual splits were originally based on disagreements on [[vinaya]] (monastic discipline), though later on, by about 100 [[Common Era|CE]] or earlier, they could be based on doctrinal disagreement.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey,''Introduction to Buddhism'', Cambridge University Press, 1990, page 74&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-sectarian Buddhism, however, did not have Abhidhammic scriptures, except perhaps for a basic framework, and not all of the early schools developed an Abhidhamma literature.

==Pre-sectarian Buddhism==
{{Main|Pre-sectarian Buddhism}}
Pre-sectarian Buddhism,{{sfn|Hurvitz|1976}} also called "early Buddhism",{{sfn|Nakamura|1989}}{{sfn|Hirakawa|1990}} "the earliest Buddhism",{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=11-12}}{{sfn|Jong|1993|p=25}} and "original Buddhism",{{sfn|Warder|2000}} is the Buddhism that existed before the various [[Schools of Buddhism|subsects of Buddhism]] came into being.&lt;ref group=web name="Bhikkhu Sujato"&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/sectsandsectarianism/conclusion Bhikkhu Sujato, ''Sects &amp; Sectarianism. The origins of Buddhist Schools. Conclusion'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the contents and teachings of this pre-sectarian Buddhism may be deduced from the [[Early Buddhist Texts|earliest Buddhist texts]], which by themselves are already sectarian.{{refn|group=note|name="Hurvitz"|Leon Hurvitz: "... stressed that the written canon in Buddhism is sectarian from the outset, and that presectarian Buddhism must be deduced from the writings as they now exist."{{sfn|Hurvitz|1976}}(quote via Google Scholar search-engine)}}{{refn|group=note|name="Jong"|J.W. De Jong: "It would be hypocritical to assert that nothing can be said about the doctrine of earliest Buddhism [...] the basic ideas of Buddhism found in the canonical writings could very well have been proclaimed by him [the Buddha], transmitted and developed by his disciples and, finally, codified in fixed formulas."{{sfn|Jong|1993|p=25}}}}{{refn|group=note|name="Warder"|A.K Warder: "...a reconstruction of the original Buddhism presupposed by the traditions of the different schools known to us."{{sfn|Warder|1999}}}}

==Early Buddhist Schools==
{{Main|Early Buddhist Schools}}
The early Buddhist schools are those schools into which the Buddhist [[monasticism|monastic]] [[Sangha (Buddhism)|saṅgha]] initially split, due originally to differences in [[vinaya]] and later also due to doctrinal differences and geographical separation of groups of monks.

===Formation===
The original saṅgha split into the first early schools (generally believed to be the [[Sthavira nikāya]] and the [[Mahāsāṃghika]]) a significant number of years after the death of [[Gautama Buddha]]. According to scholar Collett Cox "most scholars would agree that even though the roots of the earliest recognized groups predate [[Ashoka|Aśoka]], their actual separation did not occur until after his death."&lt;ref&gt;''Disputed Dharmas: Early Buddhist Theories on Existence''. by Collett Cox. The Institute for Buddhist Studies. Tokyo: 1995. {{ISBN|4-906267-36-X}} pg 23&lt;/ref&gt; Later, these first early schools split into further divisions such as the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivādin]]s and the [[Dharmaguptaka]]s, and ended up numbering, traditionally, about 18 or 20 schools. In fact, there are several overlapping lists of 18 schools preserved in the Buddhist tradition, totaling about twice as many, though some may be alternative names. It is thought likely that the number is merely conventional.

===Teachings===
After the Sangha split into the various [[early Buddhist schools]] and the [[Mahayana]], further elaborations and interpretations of the preserved teachings, and various new doctrines, scriptures and practices. They were composed and developed by the monastic communities, concerning issues deemed important at the time.{{refn|group=note|"By several centuries after the death of the Buddha, the itinerant mendicants following his way had formed settled communities and had changed irrevocably their received methods of both teaching and praxis. These changes were inevitable, a consequence of the growth and geographic dispersion of the practicing communities. Confronted with new challenges and opportunities in an increasingly organized institutional setting, monks expanded and elaborated both doctrine and disciplinary codes, created new textual genres, developed new forms of religious praxis, and eventually divided into numerous sects or schools."&lt;ref&gt;MacMillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism, 2004, page 501&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Ideological differences====
The schools sometimes split over ideological differences concerning the "real" meaning of teachings in the ''[[Sutta Pitaka|Sutta Piṭaka]]'', and sometimes over disagreement concerning the proper observance of vinaya. These ideologies became embedded in large works such as the ''[[Abhidhamma Pitaka|Abhidhamma]]''s and commentaries. Comparison of existing versions of the ''Suttapiṭaka'' of various sects shows evidence that ideologies from the ''Abhidhamma''s sometimes found their way back into the ''Suttapiṭaka''s to support the statements made in those ''Abhidhammas''. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

=====Literalism=====
Some of these developments may be seen as later elaborations on the teachings. According to Gombrich, unintentional literalism was a major force for change in the early doctrinal history of Buddhism. This means that texts were interpreted paying too much attention to the precise words used and not enough to the speaker's intention, the spirit of the text. Some later doctrinal developments in the early Buddhist schools show scholastic literalism, which is a tendency to take the words and phrases of earlier texts (maybe the Buddha's own words) in such a way as to read in distinctions which it was never intended to make.{{refn|group=note|"I would also argue that unintentional literalism has been a major force for change in the early doctrinal history of Buddhism. Texts have been interpreted with too much attention to the precise words used and not enough to the speaker's intention, the spirit of the text. In particular I see in some doctrinal developments what I call scholastic literalism, which is a tendency to take the words and phrases of earlier texts (maybe the Buddha's own words) in such a way as to read in distinctions which it was never intended to make." How Buddhism Began, Richard F. Gombrich, Munshiram Manoharlal, 1997, p. 21-22}}

=====Preservation of older ideas=====
The later Mahayana schools may have preserved ideas which were abandoned by the "orthodox" Theravada, such as the Three Bodies doctrine, the idea of consciousness (''vijnana'') as a continuum, and devotional elements such as the worship of saints. {{sfn|Lindtner|1997}}{{sfn|Lindtner|1999}}{{refn|group=note|See also [[Atthakavagga and Parayanavagga]]}}

=====Newly introduced concepts=====
Some Buddhist concepts that were not existent in the time of pre-sectarian Buddhism are:
* "Building [[parami]]s" or [[paramitas]]. The ten paramis are described in Theravadin texts of late origin,{{refn|group=note|"Theravada Buddhism, in texts such as [[Cariyapitaka]], [[Buddhavamsa]], and [[Dhammapadatthakatha]], postulates the following ten perfections", Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism, 2004, page 632}}{{refn|group=note|"It is evident that the Hinayanists, either to popularize their religion or to interest the laity more in it, incorporated in their doctrines the conception of Bodhisattva and the practice of paramitas. This was effected by the production of new literature: the Jatakas and Avadanas.' Buddhist Sects in India, Nalinaksha Dutt, Motilal Banararsidass Publishers (Delhi), 2nd Edition, 1978, p. 251. The term 'Semi-Mahayana' occurs here as a subtitle.}} while the (Mahayana) paramitas are found in the Mahayana Sutras such as the [[Dasabhumika Sutra]] and the [[Surangama Sutra]], also of late origin.
* The [[Bodhisattva vow]]s, which is only found in the [[Mahayana Sutras]].

====Newly composed scriptures====
In later times, the arguments between the various schools were based in these newly introduced teachings, practices and beliefs, and monks sought to validate these newly introduced teachings and concepts by referring to the older texts ([[Sutta-pitaka]] and [[Vinaya-pitaka]]). Most often, the various new [[Abhidhamma]] and [[Mahayana]] teachings were bases for arguments between sects.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

=====Abhidhamma=====
As the last major division of the canon, the Abhidhamma Pitaka has had a checkered history. It was not accepted as canonical by the [[Mahasanghika]] school&lt;ref name="Abhidhamma Pitaka 2008"&gt;"Abhidhamma Pitaka." Encyclopædia Britannica. Ultimate Reference Suite.  Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist Sects in India, Nalinaksha Dutt, 1978, page 58&lt;/ref&gt; and several other schools.{{refn|group=note|"several schools rejected the authority of abhidharma and claimed that abhidharma treatises were composed by fallible, human teachers." in: Macmillan ''Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004), page 2. (A similar statement can be found on pages 112 and 756.)}} Another school included most of the [[Khuddaka Nikaya]] within the Abhidhamma Pitaka.&lt;ref name="Abhidhamma Pitaka 2008"/&gt; Also, the Pali version of the Abhidhamma is a strictly Theravada collection, and has little in common with the Abhidhamma works recognized by other Buddhist schools.&lt;ref&gt;"Buddhism." Encyclopædia Britannica. Ultimate Reference Suite.  Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The various Abhidhamma philosophies of the various early schools have no agreement on doctrine&lt;ref name="Kanai Lal Hazra 1994, page 415"&gt;Kanai Lal Hazra, Pali Language and Literature - A Systematic Survey and Historical Survey, 1994, Vol. 1, page 415&lt;/ref&gt; and belong to the period of 'Divided Buddhism'&lt;ref name="Kanai Lal Hazra 1994, page 415"/&gt; (as opposed to Undivided Buddhism). The earliest texts of the Pali Canon (the [[Sutta Nipata]] and parts of the [[Jataka]]), together with the first four (and early) [[Nikaya]]s of the [[Suttapitaka]], have no mention of (the texts of) the Abhidhamma Pitaka.&lt;ref name="Kanai Lal Hazra 1994, page 412"&gt;Kanai Lal Hazra, Pali Language and Literature - A Systematic Survey and Historical Survey, 1994, Vol. 1, page 412&lt;/ref&gt; The Abhidhamma is also not mentioned at the report of the [[First Buddhist Council]], directly after the death of the Buddha. This report of the first council does mention the existence of the [[Vinaya]] and the five [[Nikaya]]s (of the [[Suttapitaka]]).&lt;ref&gt;I.B. Horner, Book of the Discipline, Volume 5, page 398&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mahisasaka Account of the First Council mentions the four agamas here. see http://santifm1.0.googlepages.com/thefirstcouncil(mahisasakaversion)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the literature of the various [[Abhidhamma Pitaka]]s began as a kind of commentarial supplement upon the earlier teachings in the [[Suttapitaka]], it soon led to new doctrinal and textual developments and became the focus of a new form of scholarly monastic life.{{refn|group=note|"Although begun as a pragmatic method of elaborating the received teachings, this scholastic enterprise soon led to new doctrinal and textual developments and became the focus of a new form of scholarly monastic life."}}&lt;ref&gt;MacMillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism, 2004, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The various Abhidhamma works were starting to be composed from about 200 years after the passing away of the Buddha.{{refn|group=note|"Independent abhidharma treatises were composed over a period of at least seven hundred years (ca. third or second centuries B.C.E. to fifth century C.E.).", MacMillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism, 2004, page 2}}

Traditionally, it is believed (in Theravadin culture) that the Abhidhamma was taught by Buddha to his late mother who was living in Tavatimsa heaven. However, this is rejected by scholars, who believe that only small parts of the Abhidhamma literature may have been existent in a very early form.{{refn|group=note|"These similarities (between the Abhidhammas of the various schools) suggest either contact among the groups who composed and transmitted these texts, or a common ground of doctrinal exegesis and even textual material predating the emergence of the separate schools.", MacMillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism, 2004, page 2}} Some schools of Buddhism had important disagreements on subjects of Abhidhamma, while having a largely similar Sutta-pitaka and Vinaya-pitaka. The arguments and conflicts between them were thus often on matters of philosophical Abhidhammic origin, not on matters concerning the actual words and teachings of Buddha.

One impetus for composing new scriptures like the Adhidhammas of the various schools, according to some scholars{{Who|date=August 2013}}, was that Buddha left no clear statement about the [[ontological]] status of the world - about what ''really'' exists.{{refn|group=note|"If I am right in thinking that the Buddha left no clear statement about the ontological status of the world - about what 'really' exists - this would explain how later Buddhists could disagree about this question." How Buddhism Began, Richard F. Gombrich, Munshiram Manoharlal, 1997, p. 34}} Subsequently, later Buddhists have themselves defined what exists and what not (in the Abhidhammic scriptures), leading to disagreements.

=====Parts of the Khuddaka Nikaya=====
Oliver Abeynayake has the following to say on the dating of the various books in the Khuddaka Nikaya:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:‘The Khuddaka Nikaya can easily be divided into two strata, one being early and the other late. The texts [[Sutta Nipata]], [[Itivuttaka]], [[Dhammapada]], [[Therigatha]] ([[Theragatha]]), [[Udana]], and [[Jataka tales]] belong to the early stratum. The texts Khuddakapatha, Vimanavatthu, Petavatthu, Niddesa, Patisambhidamagga, Apadana, Buddhavamsa and Cariyapitaka can be categorized in the later stratum.’&lt;ref&gt;A textual and Historical Analysis of the Khuddaka Nikaya – Oliver Abeynayake Ph.D. , Colombo,  First Edition – 1984, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The texts in the early stratum date from before the second council (earlier than 100 years after Buddha’s parinibbana), while the later stratum is from after the second council, which means they are definitely later additions to the Sutta Pitaka, and that they might not have been the original teachings by the Buddha, but later compositions by disciples.

The following books of the Khuddaka Nikaya can thus be regarded as later additions:
*the [[Khuddakapatha]]
*the [[Vimanavatthu]]
*the [[Petavatthu]]
*the [[Niddesa]]
*the [[Patisambhidamagga]]
*the [[Apadana]]
*the [[Buddhavamsa]]
*the [[Cariyapitaka]]
and the following three which are included in the Burmese Canon
*the [[Milindapanha]]
*the [[Nettippakarana]]
*the [[Petakopadesa]]

The original verses of the Jatakas are recognized as being amongst the earliest part of the Canon,&lt;ref name="Kanai Lal Hazra 1994, page 412"/&gt; but the accompanying (and more famous) Jataka Stories are purely commentarial, an obvious later addition.

=====Parivara=====
The [[Parivara]], the last book of the [[Vinaya Pitaka]], is a later addition to the Vinaya Pitaka.&lt;ref&gt;''This work (the Parivara) is in fact a very much later composition, and probably the work of a Ceylonese Thera.'' from: ''Book of the Discipline'', volume VI, page ix (translators' introduction)&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Other later writings=====
*all literature of the Mahayana (the [[Mahayana Sutra]]s).&lt;ref&gt;''would throw the earliest phase of this literature (the Mahayana Sutras) back to about the beginning of the [[common era]].'', Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism, 2004, page 493&lt;/ref&gt;
*all commentarial works ([[atthakatha]]) of Theravada and other [[early Buddhist schools]].

It is named for the [[Fashoda incident]] (1898) which is judged to have given rise to it. In ''[[The State of Africa]]'', the [[British people|British]] historian [[Martin Meredith]] says:

:"Ever since an incident in the Sudanese village of Fashoda ... the French had been vigilant in guarding against anglophone encroachment in what they considered to be their own backyard &amp;mdash; ''le pré carré''. In his memoirs, [[Charles de Gaulle|General de Gaulle]] listed the disasters that had afflicted France in his youth and that had led him to devote himself to upholding France's 'grandeur': the first on the list was the Fashoda incident. The 'Fashoda syndrome', as it was known, formed a basic component of France's Africa policy. To ensure that African issues received due attention, the French presidential office included a special Africa Unit &amp;mdash; ''Cellule Africaine'' &amp;mdash; with a wide remit to cover everything from intelligence work to bribery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Martin |last=Meredith |authorlink=Martin Meredith |title=[[The State of Africa]]: A History of Fifty Years of Independence |location=New York |publisher=PublicAffairs |date=2006 |page=493 |isbn=9780743232210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meredith judges that the 1990 French intervention in [[Rwanda]] was an expression of the "syndrome". Rwanda lies on the border between "[[Francophone]]" and "[[English-speaking|Anglophone]]" Africa. In 1990, there was a short-lived invasion by the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF), a coalition of [[Tutsi]] exiles and those advocating democratic reform. Many of the RPF had grown up in Tutsi refugee camps in formerly British-controlled [[Uganda]] and had learned to fight in the [[Uganda]]n army, and Uganda was seen by Paris as being, at that time, within the British sphere of influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brauman|first=Rony|title=Devant le mal.

The Fashoda complex has been used in connection with foreign policies of other countries, particularly [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]].&lt;ref name="Waterbury"/&gt;

'''''From Atlantis to the Sphinx''''' is a work of non-fiction by British author, [[Colin Wilson]], with the subheading  ''Recovering the Lost Wisdom of the Ancient World''.

Wilson proposes in the text that the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] was constructed by a technologically advanced people "nearly 10,000 years before [[Egyptologists]] have hypothesized" by the same people who provided plans for the construction of the pyramids of Egypt, [[Mesoamerican pyramids|Central]] and [[South America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67741948.html|title = Book Thickens the Riddle of the Sphinx|last = Graham|first = Mark|date = 6 November 1997|work = [[Rocky Mt. News|Rocky Mountain News]]|access-date = 2015-08-02|via = [[Highbeam Research]]|location = Denver, Colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The book explores the connection between [[astronomy]] and [[mythology]], arguing that ancient man used "Lunar knowledge" (intuition) as opposed to modern man's "Solar knowledge" (logic) to interpret the universe and therefore possessed an entirely different but equally valid mentality from that of modern man. Wilson proposes that the outlook of ancient man was based on "seeing the big picture" rather than logically breaking down the universe into its constituent parts.

Wilson develops this idea of civilisations founded on Lunar Knowledge together with astronomy to explain the monumental and seemingly spontaneous achievements of ancient cultures such as the [[Pyramids of Giza|Pyramid Complex]] at [[Giza]] in Egypt.

Wilson argues that the essential weakness of [[James Frazer]]'s ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' is that Frazer attributed the fundamental mythological systems to the beginnings of the farming cultures, specifically to fertility. Agreeing with [[Giorgio de Santillana]]'s thesis developed in ''[[Hamlet's Mill]]'', Wilson places the genesis of mythology previous to fertility cultures, linking the fundamental myths to astronomical occurrences such as the [[Precession of the Equinoxes]].

The main observations drawn by Wilson are that our ancient pre-''[[Homo sapiens]]'' ancestors possessed intelligence equal to that of modern man, their apparent lack of technological achievement being explained by the needlessness of it based on their completely different, intuitive and all-embracing mentality. Over time, a more logical and dissecting mentality evolved leading to the traits which mark modern civilisations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13758">'''Glocalization''' (a [[portmanteau]] of [[globalization]] and [[Internationalization and localization|localization]]) is the "simultaneous occurrence of both universalizing and particularizing tendencies in contemporary social, political, and economic systems."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/glocalization|title=Glocalization|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-03-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of glocalization "represents a challenge to simplistic conceptions of globalization processes as linear expansions of territorial scales. Glocalization indicates that the growing importance of continental and global levels is occurring together with the increasing salience of local and regional levels."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/glocalization|title=Glocalization|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-03-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term first appeared in a late 1980s publication of the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sharma | first1 = Chanchal Kumar | year = 2009 | title = Emerging Dimensions of Decentralisation Debate in the Age of Globalisation | journal = Indian Journal of Federal Studies | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 47–65 | ssrn=1369943 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At a 1997 conference on "Globalization and Indigenous Culture", sociologist [[Roland Robertson]] stated that glocalization "means the simultaneity – the co-presence – of both universalizing and particularizing tendencies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/glocalization |title=What is glocalization? - Definition from WhatIs.com |publisher=Searchcio.techtarget.com |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Glocal''', an adjective, by definition, is "reflecting or characterized by both local and global considerations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/glocal|title=glocal {{!}} Definition of glocal in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variety of uses==
*Individuals, households and organisations maintaining interpersonal [[social networks]] that combine extensive local and long-distance interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Wellman, "Little Boxes, Glocalization, and Networked Individualism." Pp. 11-25 in Digital Cities II, edited by Makoto Tanabe, Peter van den Besselaar, and Toru Ishida. Berlin: Springer-Verlag, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The declaration of a specified locality – a town, city, or state – as world territory, with responsibilities and rights on a world scale: a process that started in [[France]] in 1950 and originally called [[mundialization]].

==History of the concept==
The concept comes from the Japanese word ''dochakuka,'' which means global localization. It had referred to the adaptation of farming techniques to local conditions. It became a [[buzzword]] when Japanese business adopted it in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Habibul Haque Khondker, "Glocalization as Globalization: Evolution of a Sociological Concept," ''Bangladesh e-Journal of Sociology''. Vol. 1. No. 2. July, 2004 [https://web.archive.org/web/20051210071702/http://www.bangladeshsociology.org/Habib%20-%20Glocalization.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The word stems from Manfred Lange,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyi.ac.cy/user/25] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913015844/http://www.cyi.ac.cy/user/25|date=September 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; head of the German National Global Change Secretariat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-muenster.de/Umweltforschung/lange.htm |title=Prof. Lange |publisher=Uni-muenster.de |accessdate=2013-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726115304/http://www.uni-muenster.de/Umweltforschung/lange.htm |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who used "glocal" in reference to [[Heiner Benking]]'s exhibit: Blackbox Nature: [[Rubik's Cube]] of [[Ecology]] at an international science and policy conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://benking.de/Global-Change/spatial-spacial.html |title=On dialogue, knowledge, creativity, (cyber)culture, learning, wholeness |publisher=Benking.de |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://benking.de/Global-Change/system-earth-posters.html |title=Section: System Earth from the exhibition GLOBAL CHANGE: Challenges to Science and Politics - Welt im Wandel - Herausforderungen für Wissenschaft und Politik |publisher=Benking.de |date=2010-04-28 |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term entered use in the English-speaking world via Robertson in the 1990s, Canadian sociologists [[Keith Hampton]] and [[Barry Wellman]] in the late 1990s&lt;ref&gt;Barry Wellman and Keith Hampton, "Living Networked On and Offline" ''Contemporary Sociology'' 28, 6 (Nov, 1999): 648-54.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Zygmunt Bauman]].&lt;ref&gt;Hampton, Keith and B Wellman. 2002. "The Not So Global Village of Netville", in [[Barry Wellman]] and [[Caroline Haythornthwaite]] (eds), ''The Internet in Everyday Life'', Oxford: Blackwell, pp. 345–371.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erik Swyngedouw]] was another early adopter.&lt;ref&gt;Soja, Edward W. ''Postmetroplis: Critical Studies of Cities and Regions'' (Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, 2000), 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s, glocalization has been productively theorized by several [[Sociology|sociologists]] and other social scientists,&lt;ref&gt;Roudometof, Victor (2016). ''Glocalization: A Critical Introduction'' (New York: Routledge).&lt;/ref&gt; and may be understood as a process that combines the concerns of localism&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Mark; David Marsh &amp; Gerry Stoker (2013). "Understanding localism". ''Policy Studies'', 34:4, 401–407, DOI: 10.1080/01442872.2013.822699.&lt;/ref&gt; with the forces of globalization, or a local adaptation and interpretation of global forces. As a theoretical framework, it is compatible with many of the concerns of [[Postcolonial Theory|postcolonial theory]],&lt;ref&gt; Go, J. (2016). ''Postcolonial Thought and Social Theory'' (New York: Oxford University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; and its impact is particularly recognizable in the [[digitization]] of music&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, D. G. &amp; Rykowski, M. (Eds.), ''Music Glocalization: Heritage and Innovation in a Digital Age'' (Cambridge Scholars, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; and other forms of cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, F., &amp; S. Kenderdine (2007). ''Theorizing Digital Cultural heritage: A Critical Discourse''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In business==

===Challenges===
Glocalization works best for companies which have decentralized authority.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hofstede|first=Geert|date=1994-03-01|title=The business of international business is culture|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0969593194900116|journal=International Business Review|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.1016/0969-5931(94)90011-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost to the companies increases as they cannot standardise products and projects, different cultures have different needs and wants which is highlighted in this challenge. An example of a company succeeding in creating new products for their emerging market is [[McDonald's]] new rice meals in [[India]] and [[China]] &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shi|first=Xiuhua|date=2013-06-01|title=The Glocalization of English A Chinese Case Study|url=http://jds.sagepub.com/content/29/2/89|journal=Journal of Developing Societies|language=en|volume=29|issue=2|pages=89–122|doi=10.1177/0169796X13480442|issn=0169-796X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that McDonald's has done research on and understands their new market's requirements for a successful takeaway food. This however can be very costly and time-consuming.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Starbucks at the Forbidden City.jpg|thumb|Starbucks in Forbidden City, China]]
An example of a global business that has faced challenges due to localization of their products can be presented through the closing of a [[Starbucks]] in the [[Forbidden City]] of China in 2007. Starbuck's attempt to localize into the culture of China by accommodating their menu to local elements such as serving "[[green tea]] [[frappuccino]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s" and enlarging their stores was prevalent in most areas of China, but when Starbucks spread to the Forbidden City, a problem surrounding cultural identity arose. Factors surrounding "western influences" related to Starbucks were seen as a threat by a web-based campaign who was successful in initiating the closing of the Starbucks in the Forbidden City. The leader of this web-based campaign, whose name is Rui, in his words had stated "All I want is that Starbucks move out of the Forbidden City peacefully and quietly, and we'll continue enjoying Starbucks coffee elsewhere in the city." &lt;ref&gt;Han, Gang (Kevin); Zhang, Ai (2009-11-01). [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0363811109001271 "Starbucks is forbidden in the Forbidden City: Blog, circuit of culture and informal public relations campaign in China"]. ''Public Relations Review''. Includes a Special Section: Public Relations in a Time of Economic Crisis. '''35''' (4): 395–401. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[[doi:10.1016/j.pubrev.2009.07.004|10.1016/j.pubrev.2009.07.004]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are many challenges to globalisation when done right it has many benefits, allowing companies to reach a larger target market is just one of them. Society also benefits when globalisation occurs as an increase in market competition generally pushes the price of products down which means the consumers benefit by gaining a lower price point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Osland|first=Joyce S.|date=2003-06-01|title=Broadening the Debate The Pros and Cons of Globalization|url=http://jmi.sagepub.com/content/12/2/137|journal=Journal of Management Inquiry|language=en|volume=12|issue=2|pages=137–154|doi=10.1177/1056492603012002005|issn=1056-4926}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decreases the inequality gap as people who couldn't previously afford products when the market was controlled by local monopolies are able to purchase the product for cheaper.

Although globalisation has benefits to the consumer it does not always benefit the producer with newer and smaller companies struggling to keep up with the low production costs of the multi-national competitors. This results in either a higher price and loss of consumers or a lower [[profit margin]] which in turn results in less competition within the market.&lt;ref name="BrooksNormore" /&gt;

==In education==
Glocalization of education has been proposed in the specific areas of politics, economics, culture, teaching, information, organization, morality, spirituality, religion and "temporal" [[literacy]].{{Clarify|reason=What the heck is temporal literacy?|date=March 2016}} The recommended approach is for local educators to consult global resources for materials and techniques and then adapt them for local use. For example, in information, it involves advancing computer and media understanding to allow students and educators to look beyond their local context.&lt;ref name="BrooksNormore"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Jeffrey|year=2010|title=Educational Leadership and Globalization: Literacy for a Glocal Perspective|journal=Educational Policy|volume=24|issue=1|pages=52–82|doi=10.1177/0895904809354070|author2=Normore, Anthony}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==
[[Thomas Friedman]] in ''[[The World Is Flat]]'' talks about how the Internet encourages glocalization, such as encouraging people to make websites in their [[native languages]].

'''&lt;big&gt;Television&lt;/big&gt;'''

Besides the usage of [[Internet]], television and commercials have become useful strategies that global companies have used to help localize their products. Companies, such as McDonald's, have relied on television and commercials in not only the Western Hemisphere but in other parts of the world to attract a varying ranges of audiences in accordance to the demographic of the local area. For example, they have used mascots ranging anywhere from a male clown in the Western Hemisphere to attract younger audiences to an "attractive" female clown in Japan to attract older audiences.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Crawford, A., S. A. Humphries &amp; M. M. Geddy (2015). "McDonald's: A Case Study in Glocalization". ''Journal of Global Business Issues'', ''9''(1), 11–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Helen Rand Parish''' (1912 - 2005) was an American writer, linguist, and social justice scholar.&lt;ref name="SFGate"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Guthrie |first1=Julian |title=Helen Rand Parish -- writer |url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Helen-Rand-Parish-writer-2634144.php |website=SFGate |date=15 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Parish and her twin sister, Olive, were born in [[Waterbury, Connecticut]] on October 10, 1912. At a young age, the twins became research subjects of [[Arnold Gesell]], a child development pioneer who founded the [[Yale Clinic of Child Development]]. The twins graduated summa cum laude from college and went on to receive master's degrees in American literature from [[Yale University]] by the age of 17. The Parish sisters also did graduate studies on Latin American problems at [[University of Southern California|USC]].&lt;ref name=LA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pena |first1=Michael |title=Olive Tejada-Flores |url=https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Olive-Tejada-Flores-2959761.php |website=SFGate |date=26 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helen went on to study at the [[National University of Mexico|National University in Mexico City]] and eventually moved to [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] in 1936, where she settled.&lt;ref name="LA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=BATES |first1=TOM |title=Sainted Obsession :  When Helen Rand Parish Discovered A Priestly Hero Amid The Conquistadores, She Found The Cause Of A Lifetime |journal=Los Angeles Times |date=11 October 1992 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-10-11/magazine/tm-574_1_las-casas/3 |issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parish was drawn there by Latin American scholar Eugene Bolton, who accepted both Helen and Olive into his seminar on 16th-Century Spanish colonial history.

==Writing==
Parish began her writing career in journalism, first with the ''[[Atlanta Constitution]]'', writing with her sister under the joint byline "The Parish Twins," and later for other papers including the ''[[New York Daily Mirror]]'' and the ''[[New York Times]]''. They frequently collaborated on stories with their mother who was also a writer.&lt;ref name=SFGate/&gt;

Parish worked as a free-lance writer, ghost-writing a number of books for [[Viking Press]], as well as pursuing her scholarly interests at [[Bancroft Library]] at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]]. Parish eventually became a research associate there, where she assembled the world's largest collection of rare Las Casas books and documents.

As a bi-lingual writer, Parish wrote in English and Spanish, focusing mainly on non-fiction books and essays on the life and writings of [[Bartolome de las Casas]], as well as themes of Christianity and Central America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parish |first1=Helen Rand |title=Our Lady of Guadalupe. |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/our-lady-of-guadalupe/oclc/165685&amp;referer=brief_results |publisher=Viking Press |language=English |date=1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; the relationship between Latin America and the United States, and Spanish American literature. Parish co-wrote with Henry Raup Wagner: "The Life and Writings of Bartolome de Las Casas" (1967). Additionally, Parish wrote three juvenile fiction books, all with different ancient history motifs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parish |first1=Helen Rand |title=Estebanico |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/estebanico/oclc/815056&amp;referer=brief_results |website=WorldCat |publisher=Viking Press |language=English |date=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parish was a strong supporter for the [[canonization]] of Bartolome de las Casas. Understanding that canonizations can take centuries, Parish remarked in 1992: "I have never asked to live to see the canonization, only to finish my work."&lt;ref name=SFGate/&gt;

At [[César Chávez Park|Cesar Chavez Park]] in Berkeley, California, a memorial plaque for Parish sits attached to a large rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nicolaus |first1=Martin |title=A Name on a Stone: Helen Rand Parish |url=http://chavezpark.org/a-name-on-a-stone/ |date=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Horacio de la Costa''' (May 9, 1916 – March 20, 1977) was the first Filipino Provincial Superior of the [[Society of Jesus]] in the [[Philippines]], and a recognized authority in Philippine and Asian culture and history.

A brilliant writer, scholar, and historian, Horacio de la Costa was born in [[Mauban|Maúban]], [[Quezon]] on May 9, 1916 to Judge Sixto de la Costa and Emiliana Villamayor. Ordained a Jesuit priest at the age of 30, he became, at age 55, the first Filipino provincial superior of this religious order, the [[Society of Jesus]].

== Education ==
De la Costa first attended the public elementary school in [[Batangas]] before moving on to the [[Ateneo de Manila University|Ateneo de Manila]], where he distinguished himself for academic excellence and student leadership, particularly as a writer and, later, as editor of the ''Guidon'', the campus newspaper. After earning there his Bachelor of Arts degree, [[summa cum laude]], in 1935, he entered the [[Society of Jesus]] at the Sacred Heart Novitiate in [[Novaliches]], where he later completed his Master's degree. Afterward, he went back to the Ateneo to teach philosophy and history for two years. During this time, he also worked as a writer and radio talent for the Chesteron Evidence Guild, more specifically, the "Common Weal Hour", for which he created the character of Teban, the ''calesa'' driver, at the height of the controversy over the 1940 divorce bill. The program evolved into "Kuwentong Kutsero", consisting of satirical tales dealing mostly with life in [[Manila]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Appropriation of Colonial Broadcasting: A History of Early Radio in the Philippines, 1922-1946|last = Enriquez|first = Elizabeth L.|publisher = University of the Philippines Press|year = 2008|isbn = |location = Quezon City|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==War-time and post-war activities==
During the war, the Japanese imprisoned him for two months in [[Fort Santiago]] for his role in the resistance movement. He helped Rev. Fr. John F. Hurley, the Jesuits' superior, in taking clothes and medicines to American and [[Filipino people|Filipino]] soldiers who had evaded capture by the Japanese or escaped from Japanese prison camps. For this, he was awarded the [[Medal of Freedom (1945)|Medal of Freedom]] by the United States government in 1946. Early in 1946, he left for the United States to pursue further studies in theology at [[Woodstock College]], [[Maryland]], where he was ordained a priest on March 24, 1946 by American Bishop John F. McNamara. He received his doctorate degree in history at [[Harvard University]] in 1951.

==Return to the Philippines==
Back in the [[Philippines]], he served anew with the faculty of the [[Ateneo de Manila University|Ateneo de Manila]] in 1953, later becoming its first Filipino college dean while teaching history at the same time. In 1958, he was made a consultant of the Philippine province of the [[Society of Jesus]] and, in 1959, assumed the editorship of its scholarly publication, [[Philippine Studies: Historical and Ethnographic Viewpoints|''Philippine Studies'']]. Fr. de la Costa received a Smith-Mundt-Fuldright scholarship in 1960. In 1962, he became a research associate of the [[London School of Oriental and African Studies]]. During this period, he received honorary doctorates from the [[University of Santo Tomas|University of Santo Tomás]], Tokyo's [[Sophia University]], and Dumaguete's [[Silliman University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tiempo|first=Edilberto K.|author2=Maslog, Crispin C.; Sitoy, T. Valentino, Jr.|title=Silliman University 1901–1976|publisher=Silliman University|year=1977|pages=385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 8, 1964, he assumed office as provincial superior of the Philippine province of the [[Society of Jesus]]. His election ended the long line of Spanish and American Jesuits who were elected to the said post in the Philippines.

==Works and achievements==
De la Costa was the author of a number of books, particularly on Philippine culture and history, which revealed his nationalistic bent, among which are: 
*''The Jesuits in the Philippines, 1581–1768''
*''The Trial of Dr. Rizal'', an edited translation of W.E. Retana’s transcription of the official Spanish documents
*''Recent Oriental History''
*''Readings in Philippines History''
*''The Background of Nationalism, and Other Essays''
*''Asia and the Philippines''

He also contributed numerous articles on these subjects to  various local and foreign scholarly publications, such as ''Philippine Social Sciences and Humanities Review'', ''Bulletin of the Philippine Historical Association'', ''Hispanic American Historical Review'', ''Comment'', ''Science Review'', ''Theological Studies'', and [[Philippine Studies: Historical and Ethnographic Viewpoints|''Philippine Studies'']]. The [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] carries his article on the [[Philippines]].

In 1965, he was presented the Republic Heritage Award by the then Philippine President [[Diosdado Macapagal]] for his historical writings.  In 1971 he became General Assistant to the [[Superior General of the Society of Jesus]], [[Pedro Arrupe]], in Rome.

Fr. de le Costa was one of the founding members of the Philippine Academy of Science and Humanities, as well as the [[International Association of Historians of Asia]]. He was also a member of the National Research Council of the Philippines, Philippine Bibliographical Society, [[Philippine Historical Association]] and the National Historical Society of the [[National Historical Commission]].

==Death==

&lt;!--[[File:Loylasjf2068 06.JPG|thumb|Horacio de la Costa portrait, Loyola School of Theology, LHS, [[Loyola Schools]].]] --&gt;
A few years before his death, De la Costa attended the [[General Congregation]] of Jesuits from all over the world in Rome. In need of a composition on "The Jesuits Today", the delegates entrusted him the preparation. He worked on it by himself for three days. When he was finished, he returned to the congregation and read his draft. His composition was accepted exactly as he had written it.

De la Costa died of cancer on March 20, 1977 at the age of 60. He was buried in the Jesuit [[Novitiate]] Compound in [[Novaliches]], [[Quezon City]].

For his achievements in the Jesuit Philippine Province and the Jesuit congregation in general, the Loyola School of Theology of the [[Ateneo de Manila University]] was inaugurated while the Horacio de la Costa Hall in the same university was named, both in his honor.

A street in Salcedo Village in [[Makati]]'s central business district, where the Ateneo de Manila's Salcedo Campus (which is home to the university's Graduate School of Business and the Center for Continuing Education) is located has been named in his honor as well.

'''John Wesley Cromwell''' (September 5, 1846 - April 14, 1927) was a lawyer, teacher, civil servant, journalist, historian, and civil rights activist in Washington, DC. He was among the founders of the [[Bethel Literary and Historical Society]] and the [[American Negro Academy]], both based in the capital. He worked for decades in administration of the US Post Office.

He also was a founder, editor, or contributor to a number of newspapers and journals, including most prominently the ''People's Advocate.'' In the later half of his career, he wrote a number of articles and manuscripts and gave a number of speeches which established him as a leading scholar of African-American history. In 1887, he was described as the "best English scholar in the United States."&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"&gt;William J. Simmons, Henry McNeal Turner, ''Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising,'' G. M. Rewell &amp; Company, 1887, p 898-907&lt;/ref&gt; Cromwell was also successful as a lawyer late in life and was the first black lawyer to appear before the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]].

== Early life ==

John Wesley Cromwell was born into slavery on September 5, 1846 in [[Portsmouth, Virginia]]. He was the youngest of twelve children. His parents were Willis H. and Elizabeth (Carney) Cromwell.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; Cromwell's father worked as a ferryman on the [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]] and was allowed to keep some of his wages.&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, Jack Temple. ''Poquosin: A Study of Rural Landscape and Society.'' UNC Press Books, Dec 1, 2014, page 178&lt;/ref&gt; One brother, Levi, later became well known as a caterer in Washington, DC.

In 1851, their father purchased freedom for his family, and they moved to [[Philadelphia]] in the free state of Pennsylvania. John attended school there from 1851 to 1856. He moved to a teaching school, the Preparatory Department of the [[Institute for Colored Youth]], where [[Ebenezer Bassett]] was the principal. Cromwell graduated in the summer of 1864.

He moved to [[Columbia, Pennsylvania]] that fall in October 1864 to begin his career as a teacher. When the school in Columbia closed, Cromwell returned to Portsmouth, Virginia in April 1865 in the closing days of the American Civil War, starting a private school where he worked until the fall.

By the end of 1865 Cromwell returned to Philadelphia; he taught at the [[Baltimore Association for the Moral and Intellectual Improvement of the Colored People]]. In March 1866, the school was attacked and burned to the ground and Cromwell was shot at. He continued to work for the organization until May. That month he returned to Virginia, working for the [[American Missionary Association]] at Providence Church in [[Norfolk County, Virginia]]. It was establishing schools across the South. At this time, he became more active in politics. He also briefly worked in the grocery business.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt;

== Public career ==
In Virginia, Cromwell became involved in public affairs. In 1867, Cromwell was in the [[US District Court]] Jury Pool and served in the jury on a number of cases of government officials. In April 17, 1867, he was a delegate to the Republican convention in Richmond, Virginia and again to the Republican State convention in [[Richmond, Virginia]] in August. Later that year, he attended the Virginia Constitutional Convention, where he was elected clerk.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt;

In 1869, Cromwell returned to teaching, working with the Quaker group, the [[Philadelphia Yearly Meeting|Philadelphia Friends]]. That year, Cromwell was an eyewitness to the assassination of [[Joseph R. Holmes]], a fellow member of the Constitutional Convention and a candidate for the [[Virginia House of Delegates]]. In 1869 and 1870, he taught at a grade school in Withersville, Virginia. In 1870 he returned to the capital Richmond, where he was principal of a black school held in Dill's Bakery. In the summer of 1871, he taught a term in Southampton County. This experience influenced his later writings on [[Nat Turner's slave rebellion]] of 1831, which had occurred nearby.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt;

In the fall of 1871, Cromwell moved to [[Washington DC]] and enrolled in the [[Howard University]] Law Department. He graduated in March 1874 and was admitted to the bar before the [[Supreme Court of the District of Columbia]]. In the meantime, in 1872, Cromwell passed the civil service exam to qualify for an appointment in the federal government. He took a position as a government clerk. In this exam, he had the highest score of his cohort. He also took a merit exam to qualify for teaching, and scored at the top. He accepted a teaching appointment for a time in [[Washington County, Virginia]].

In 1873 and 1874, Cromwell was twice promoted in his clerkship and, along with [[Robert William Waring]], was one of the first two black clerks to receive such an office. He was promoted to chief examiner of the division of the money order department, and was register of money order accounts until his retirement from the civil service in 1885. In April 1875, federal clerks took part in two [[spelling bee]]s, which were covered by newspapers across the country. Cromwell was a finalist in both. He was successful as a lawyer and was the first black lawyer to appear before the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]].&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt;

In 1875, Cromwell was a part of organizing the Virginia Educational and Historical Association; he served as its president until 1883, when it closed. Cromwell was also active as a journalist. In 1876, he organized a journal, the ''People's Advocate'' in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], which moved to Washington DC the next year. He ran it until 1884. In 1883, he was president of the Bethel Literary society. He was a member of the Odd Fellows and of the Metropolitan AME Church. He represented the District in the 1884 World's Fair, also known as the Cotton Centennial Exhibition, at New Orleans.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt;

In 1881 Cromwell and [[Daniel Alexander Payne]] founded the Bethel Literary and Historical Association, and he served as president of that lyceum in 1883. In 1897, Cromwell was a part of the formation of the [[American Negro Academy]] founded by [[Alexander Crummell]]. He served as the organization's corresponding secretary until 1919. In 1919, he served as the fourth president for a short period.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred A. Moss. The American Negro Academy: Voice of the Talented Tenth.  Louisiana State University Press, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1901 to 1909 he was editor of the Washington weekly, the ''Washington Record.'' In 1910, he and James Robert Lincoln Diggs established the American Negro Monograph Company, a publishing company which lasted for eleven months.

From 1901 to 1909 he taught and served as principals of several District schools, including Briggs, Garnet, Banneker, and Crummell schools.&lt;ref name="Hall2005"&gt;Hall, Steven Gilroy. "Cromwell, John Wesley," in ''Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience,'' eds. Anthony Appiah, Henry Louis Gates, Jr.,   Oxford University Press, Mar 16, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thought and legacy ==
Beyond his work as an educator, Cromwell played a significant role in the direction of black American thought. The Bethel Literary Organization, which he helped create and direct, and his speeches at other lyceums in the capital were highly influential. In 1900, Cromwell made a substantial donation of materials to the Howard University Library now called the Cromwell Collection.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, 1999, page 121&lt;/ref&gt;

Cromwell was a strong advocate of black-owned businesses and encouraged black economic success. He believed black people should try to frequent black-owned businesses.&lt;ref name="Hall2005"/&gt; Cromwell was considered an important statistician and historian in the later part of his life. He had great contempt for efforts to minimize the cost of slavery to blacks in America and focused significant attention on slave insurrections. Cromwell wrote that Nat Turner's revolt was an example of black people working to "help himself rather than depend on the other human agencies for the protection which could come through his own strong arm."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, John David. "A Different View of Slavery: Black Historians Attack the New Proslavery Argument, 1890-1920," in eds Charles H Stone, John David Smith, ''Slavery, Race and American History: Historical Conflict, Trends and Method, 1866-1953.'' Routledge, Mar 4, 2015, page 75&lt;/ref&gt;

Cromwell wrote many papers and a number of book-length pieces. Cromwell's 1914 book, ''The Negro in American History: Men and Women Eminent in the Evolution of the American of African Descent,'' influenced [[Carter G. Woodson]] to create the [[Association for the Study of Negro Life and History]] in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Juanita Carrillo, ''African American History Day by Day: A Reference Guide to Events'', ABC-CLIO, Aug 22, 2012, page 262-263&lt;/ref&gt; Cromwell later published articles in the ''Journal of Negro History.''

== Family ==

In 1873 Cromwell married Lucy A. McGuinn of Richmond and had seven children with her. The couple stressed the importance of education for all their children, who included Otelia, Mary E., Martha, Lucy, John Wesley Jr., and Brent.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary: John Wesley Cromwell, ''Evening Star'' (Washington (DC), District of Columbia), Friday, April 15, 1927 Page: 9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Otelia Cromwell]], born in 1874, became the first black graduate of Smith College. She was a teacher and professor at [[Miners Teacher College]], and received a PhD from Yale in 1926. Mary E. Cromwell was born in 1876 and taught mathematics. John Wesley Cromwell, Jr. was born in 1883 and taught mathematics, German, and bookkeeping; he became the first black certified public accountant.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Jacqueline M. ''Leading the Race: The Transformation of the Black Elite in the Nation's Capital, 1880-1920.'' University of Virginia Press, 1999, p, 36&lt;/ref&gt;

After Lucy's death, in 1892 Cromwell married Annie E. Conn of [[Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;Culp, Daniel Wallace. ''Twentieth Century Negro Literature: Or, A Cyclopedia of Thought on the Vital Topics Relating to the American Negro.'' J.L. Nichols &amp; Company, 1902&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2347">{{inline|date=November 2015}}'''Genesius''' ({{lang-el|Γενέσιος}}, ''Genesios'') is the conventional name given to the anonymous Byzantine author of [[Armenians|Armenian]] origin of the tenth century chronicle, ''On the reign of the emperors''. His first name is sometimes given as '''Joseph''', combining him with a "Joseph Genesius" quoted in the preamble to [[John Skylitzes]]. Traditionally, he has been regarded as the son or grandson of [[Constantine Maniakes]].

Composed at the court of [[Constantine VII]], the chronicle opens in 814, covers the [[Iconoclasm (Byzantine)#The_second_iconoclastic_period:_814–842|Second Iconoclast]] period and ends in 886. It presents the events largely from the view of the [[Byzantium under the Macedonians|Macedonian dynasty]], though with a skew less marked than the authors of [[Theophanes Continuatus]], a collection of mostly anonymous chronicles meant to continue the work of [[Theophanes the Confessor]].

The chronicle describes the reigns of the four emperors from [[Leo V the Armenian|Leo V]] down to [[Michael III]] in detail; and more briefly that of [[Basil I]]. It uses Constantine VII's ''Life of Basil'' as a source, though it appears to have been finished before Theophanes Continuatus, and gives information present in neither Continuatus nor Skylitzes.

'''Lorenzo de Monacis''' was a distinguished diplomat of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]].&lt;ref name="MichaelE."&gt;{{cite book|author1=Knapton, Michael|author2=Law, John E.|author3=Smith, Alison|title=Venice and the Veneto during the Renaissance: the Legacy of Benjamin Kohl|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BgGVCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA75|publisher=Firenze University Press|isbn=978-88-6655-663-3|pages=75–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an influential historian who wrote the history of Venice, a work which formed the basis of [[Marcantonio Sabellico]]'s writings on the history of Venice.&lt;ref name="MichaelE."/&gt;

De Monacis combined early [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] ideas and his own experience as a diplomat during a time of expansion of the Venetian [[imperium]] and developed literary works which sought to give an ideological basis to Venetian expansionism. His works provided Venice with an ideological support base which justified the initial stages of the Venetian incursions into [[Italy]] and [[Dalmatia]].&lt;ref name="MichaelE."/&gt;

== Diplomatic career ==

In 1386 Lorenzo de Monacis accompanied Venetian diplomat [[Pantaleone Barbo]] to Hungary representing Venice's interests during a crisis involving the succession to the Hungarian throne. The diplomatic mission was successful as described in a report by de Monacis to the Venetian government.&lt;ref name="MichaelE."/&gt; During the mission, de Monacis wrote a poem defending Hungarian queens [[Mary, Queen of Hungary|Mary]] and [[Elizabeth of Bosnia|Elizabeth]] who were accused of the murder of [[Charles III of Naples|Charles II of Hungary]].&lt;ref name="MichaelE."/&gt;

In 1389, de Monacis accompanied Barbo again on another diplomatic mission to Hungary when they fell victims to robbery.&lt;ref name="MichaelE."/&gt; The two diplomats, having lost all their personal belongings during the incident, received 60 [[gold ducat]]s as compensation awarded to them by the ''[[Maggior Consiglio]]'' of Venice. De Monacis returned to Hungary on another mission in 1390.&lt;ref name="MichaelE."/&gt;

In November 1388 de Monacis was elected Grand Chancellor of Crete, one of the most prestigious offices in the Venetian realm. During that time he also supervised the agreement between Venice and [[Mary of Enghien|Maria d'Enghien]], inheritor of [[Argos]]-[[Nafplion]], which saw the sale of the two cities to Venice for 500 [[ducat]]s.&lt;ref name="MichaelE."/&gt;

In 1395, while still Chancellor of Crete, he was sent to France along with Giovanni Alberto, a fellow diplomat, to settle a trade dispute through diplomacy.&lt;ref name="MichaelE."/&gt;

== Written works ==
De Monacis wrote a variety of works such as histories, poems, diplomatic reports, and orations in [[Latin]]. The common thread of his works was the ideological position that Venice was a force for good and defender of freedom which protected its neighbours who gratefully accepted its dominion over them in exchange for the stability it provided them. His works formed the ideological background which justified the early stages of Venetian expansion into Italy and Dalmatia.&lt;ref name="MichaelE."/&gt;

His work ''Chronicon de rebus Venetis ab U.C. ad annum 1354...'', ed. Fl. Corner (Venice, 1758), has been described as a "very valuable source for thirteenth-century [[prosopography]]", due to the fact that it contains original material from archives that de Monacis was able to access in Venice and Candia due to his position.&lt;ref name="HerrinSaint-Guillain2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Judith Herrin|author2=Guillaume Saint-Guillain|title=Identities and Allegiances in the Eastern Mediterranean After 1204|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p_mazcfdpVIC&amp;pg=PA288|year=2011|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-1098-0|pages=288–289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[historiographer]], de Monacis has attempted to give a more balanced account of the [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|sack of Constantinople]] by the Latins by using non-Venetian sources such as [[Nicetas Choniates]]; the Venetian sources had a heavy, anti-Byzantine bias.&lt;ref name="Fryde1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=E. B Fryde|title=Humanism and Renaissance Historiography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PW-vAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9|date=1 July 1984|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-0-8264-2750-2|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building of the National Museum was designed by architects [[Herman Gesellius]], [[Armas Lindgren]], and [[Eliel Saarinen]]. The appearance of the building reflects Finland's medieval churches and [[castle]]s. The architecture belongs to [[national romanticism]] and the interior mainly to [[art nouveau]]. The museum was built from 1905 to 1910 and opened to the public in 1916. The museum was named the Finnish National Museum after Finland's independence in 1917. After the last thorough renovation, the Museum was re-opened in July 2000.

== Collections ==
The museum collections include also the [[Mesa Verde National Park|Mesa Verde]] artifacts from the cliff dwellings of Colorado. These were donated to the museum by the [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Finland Swedish]] explorer [[Gustaf Nordenskiöld]]. They comprise the most-extensive collection of Mesa Verde items outside the United States and one of the largest collections of [[Indigenous people of the Americas|native American]]a outside the American continents.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael C. FitzGerald|FitzGerald, Michael C.]], [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123697765848223641 "The Majesty of Mesa Verde"] in ''Wall Street Journal'', 13 March 2009, p. W12.&lt;/ref&gt;
These artifacts were on display until May 2013 at the [http://www.nba.fi/en/museums/museum_of_culture Museum of Cultures] in [[Helsinki]].

==Gas explosion in the Silver Room 2006==
On Monday 23 January 2006 there was an [[explosion]] accident at the National Museum in the Silver Room, which was caused by [[methane]] leaking into a broom cupboard from the drainage through dried floor drain and lit by a spark from the power distribution cabinet in the cleaning closet. There were two possible sources for the methane; a leak from a gas pipe under the nearby Museokatu street, or gas that developed on its own in the sewer. Later, police investigations found the cause to be a gas pipe leak. [http://www.hs.fi/uutiset/tuoreet/artikkeli/Kansallismuseon+r%C3%A4j%C3%A4hdyksen+syyn%C3%A4+maakaasuvuoto/1135218807492]. 
Most display cases and only 49 pieces out of more than 200 silver objects in the museum's Silver Room were damaged in the explosion, although most of them only mildly. Nobody was hurt. All objects have been repaired during 2006. The Silver Room was re-opened to the public in early 2007.

'''Nicolaus Mameranus''' (6 December 1500 – 1567) was a [[Luxembourg]] soldier and historian under [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], for whom he travelled widely, recording faithfully the composition of foreign courts and the customs of foreign countries. All his writings are in Latin.  Mameranus was born in [[Mamer]], probably as '''Nik Wagener'''. He was a very conservative Roman Catholic, full of abuse for Lutherans and other Protestants.

Mameranus succeeded in having Charles V pay for the restoration of his native Mamer after the [[Charles II de Valois, Duke of Orléans|Duke of Orléans]]' troops pillaged it in 1543. In 1555, Charles V appointed him [[poet laureate]] and [[Count Palatine]] in recognition of his continued support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webplaza.pt.lu/~rletsch/PER-MN-A-xF.htm Mameranus Nicolas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609220112/http://webplaza.pt.lu/~rletsch/PER-MN-A-xF.htm |date=2007-06-09 }}  - Club Philatelique Mamer. Retrieved 12 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

He probably died in [[Augsburg]], Germany, in 1567.

'''Ong Chit Chung''' ({{zh|t=翁執中|s=翁执中|p=Wēng Zhí Zhōng}}; 28 January 1949 – 14 July 2008) was a [[Singapore]]an politician and [[Member of Parliament]] (MP). He was also a [[military historian]] at the [[National University of Singapore]].

==Career==
Entering politics in 1988, Ong served the [[Bukit Batok]] Constituency&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=I remember Dr Ong Chit Chung|journal=BEYOND SG|url=http://beyondsg.typepad.com/beyondsg/2008/07/i-remember-dr-o.html|accessdate=10 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110092459/http://beyondsg.typepad.com/beyondsg/2008/07/i-remember-dr-o.html|archive-date=10 January 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; for two terms, before the constituency became part of the [[Bukit Timah Group Representation Constituency]] in 1996, and the constituency becoming a part of the [[Jurong Group Representation Constituency]] in 2001. In 1991, Ong was appointed Parliamentary Secretary for [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] and [[Ministry of Manpower (Singapore)|Labour]]. During his twenty years in politics, Ong also served as the Chairman for the Government Parliamentary Committees for Education, Defence and Foreign Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Member's Profile|url=http://www.parliament.gov.sg/mp/ong-chit-chung-dr|publisher=GOVERNMENT OF SINGAPORE|accessdate=10 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110122828/http://www.parliament.gov.sg/mp/ong-chit-chung-dr|archive-date=10 January 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Lee Foong Ming|author2=Lynda Hong|title=Dr Ong Chit Chung dies peacefully at home|publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]]|date=14 July 2008|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/360201/1/.html|accessdate=16 July 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122062703/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/360201/1/.html|archive-date=22 November 2008|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
On 2 August 2008, Ong's alma mater, [[Victoria School]], named a student leadership award after Ong. Called the Dr. Ong Chit Chung Leadership Award, it is awarded to high-performing students in the school. Ong's old Chief Librarian badge that was used when he was still in Victoria School, was presented by Ong's widow to the principal Low Eng Teong, and was later added to the collection in the school's heritage centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Dhany Osman|title=Award named after Ong Chit Chung|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]]|date=3 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ong Chit Chung Memorial Scholarship is also named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Faculty Level: Scholarship Ong Chit Chung Memorial Scholarship|url=http://www.fas.nus.edu.sg/undergrad/toknow/financialaid/ong-chit-chung}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9657">'''P'arsadan Gorgijanidze''' ({{lang-ka|ფარსადან გორგიჯანიძე}}; or Giorgijanidze, გიორგიჯანიძე) (1626 – {{circa|1696}}) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] [[wikt:factotum|factotum]] and [[historian]] in the service of the [[Safavid Empire|Safavids]]. Early in his career he served at the residence of the viceroy (''[[Vali (governor)|vali]]'') of Kartli, and later at the Safavid court in [[Isfahan]]. He is principally known for his informative chronicles ''The History of Georgia'' (საქართველოს ისტორია, ''sak’art’velos istoria'').

==Career==
Born in the town of [[Gori, Georgia|Gori]], Gorgijanidze was brought up at the local court of the Safavid viceroy (''vali'') of Kartli, [[Rostom of Kartli|Rostom]] (Rostam), in [[Tbilisi]].{{sfn|Giunashvili|2016}} He engaged in Georgian-Iranian diplomacy early in his career.{{sfn|Giunashvili|2016}} In 1656, he was appointed, through the recommendation of Rostom, as a ''darugha'' (prefect) of the Safavid capital, [[Isfahan]].{{sfn|Giunashvili|2016}}{{sfn|Matthee|2012|pages=49-50}} Gorgijanidze converted to Islam on the occasion, entered the ''[[Military_of_the_Safavid_dynasty#Gholam|gholam]]'' corps, and was to spend four decades in the service of the kings (''[[shah]]s'') [[Abbas II of Persia|Abbas II]] (1642-1666) and [[Suleiman I of Persia|Suleiman I]] (1666-1694).{{sfn|Giunashvili|2016}}{{sfn|Mikaberidze|2015|page=344}}{{sfn|Matthee|2012|page=50}} 

For thirty years, Rostom had held the function of prefect of Isfahan, though the actual administration was maintained by the deputy prefect, Mir Qasem Beg.{{sfn|Giunashvili|2016}}{{sfn|Matthee|2012|pages=49-50}} Circumstances changed for Gorgijanidze, when [[List of Safavid Grand Viziers|grand vizier]] [[Mohammad Beg]] (1654-1661), who was responsible for the dismissal and execution of Mir Qasem Beg, tried to pursue his grudge by using the new prefect, Gorjijanidze, in his scheme.{{sfn|Matthee|2012|page=50}} Angered by the fact that king Abbas II had not ordered for the confiscation of Mir Qasem's property, he encouraged Gorgijanidze to accept bribes and perform [[extortion]].{{sfn|Matthee|2012|page=50}} Mohammad Beg wanted to show, that if a newly appointed prefect could amass such amounts of wealth in a short period of time, then Mir Qasem Beg must have had "pocketed fantastic amounts of money" in his thirty years of holding the office as deputy.{{sfn|Matthee|2012|page=50}} Gorgijanidze soon followed the grand vizier's advice.{{sfn|Matthee|2012|page=50}}

However, it was not Gorgijanidze's attempt at gathering wealth that caused his direct downfall.{{sfn|Matthee|2012|page=50}} Shortly after his appointment as prefect of the capital, Parsadan's harsh administrative rearrangements and new laws raised him opposition with the Isfahanians, and his direct superior Ughurlu Beg, the ''divanbegi'' (chancellor, chief justice), who received complaints about Gorgijanidze's misrule.{{sfn|Matthee|2012|page=50}} The ''divanbegi'' took the side of the citizens, and had a part in the rioting that ensued.{{sfn|Matthee|2012|page=50}} Mohammad Beg, realizing that his scheme was getting thwarted by Ughurlu Beg, formed the event to make it look like a "threat to security" for which the ''divanbegi'' should be held responsible.{{sfn|Matthee|2012|page=50}} After the report was made to king Abbas II by Mohammad Beg, Ughurlu Beg was removed from his post and blinded, while Parsadan was also dismissed from his post.{{sfn|Matthee|2012|page=50}}{{sfn|Newman|2008|page=85}} Abbas II then appointed Parsadan as the new ''eshik-agha'' ([[Master of Ceremonies]]) of the royal court, and gave him five villages in the confines of [[Golpayegan]] as a [[fief]].{{sfn|Giunashvili|2016}} Parsadan's family remained in Kartli, but several of its members were also active in mainland Iran. Thus, one of Parsandan's brothers, Alexander, served as the ''zarabibash'' (chief of the Shah's mint) of Isfahan;{{sfn|Paghava|Turkia|Akopyan|2010|page=22}} another, Melik Sadat-Bek, was ''yuzbash'' (lieutenant) of the shah’s army. Parsadan's son, David, was trained as an officer of the shah's guard (''gholam'').

Gorgijanidze found himself involved in the incessant intrigues in the Safavid administration and twice fell in disfavor with the shah. His post also allowed Gorgijanidze to intervene in the domestic politics in his native Georgia. His antagonism with Rostom's successor as ruler of Kartli, [[Vakhtang V of Kartli|Shah Navaz Khan]] (Vakhtang V) undermined his position and Gorgijanidze was exiled, from 1666 to 1671, to [[Shushtar]], the governor of which, [[Vakhushti Khan Orbeliani|Vakhushti Khan]], was a close relative of Shah Navaz Khan's wife Rodam.{{sfn|Maeda|2007|pages=125-136}}{{sfn|Giunashvili|2016}}

==Chronicle and overal literary efforts==
A manuscript of Gorgijanidze's untitled chronicle was discovered by the Georgian scholar [[Platon Ioseliani]] in 1841 and was conventionally named ''The History of Georgia'' by the 19th-century scholars of Georgia [[Marie-Félicité Brosset]] and [[Teimuraz Bagrationi]]. It is a voluminous work which seems to have been completed by the author by 1694 or 1696 while living in Isfahan.{{sfn|Giunashvili|2016}} The chronicle relates the Georgian history from the ascension of [[Christianity]] in Georgia in the 4th century down to the late 17th century.{{sfn|Giunashvili|2016}} Gorgijanidze's account of his contemporary events is of special value.{{sfn|Giunashvili|2016}} He made extensive use of foreign, primarily Persian, historical works in order to confirm or supplement information from native Georgian sources.{{Sfn|Hitchins|2001|pages=490-493}} The chronicles contain also autobiographic information and is written in vernacular Georgian apparently because of the author's poor knowledge of the contemporary standards of Georgian literary language.

Gorgijanidze was also actively involved in the editing, versification and rewriting of the [[Georgian language|Georgian]] versions of the ''[[Shahnameh]]'' epic.{{sfn|Giunashvili|2016}} Amongst the several major works Gorgijanidze translated into Georgian, there was the ''Jāmeʿ-e abbāsi'', a book written by [[Bahāʾ al-dīn al-ʿĀmilī|Sheikh Baha'i]] on [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[jurisprudence]].{{sfn|Giunashvili|2016}} He also composed a trilingual Georgian-Arabic-Persian dictionary.{{sfn|Alasania}}{{sfn|Giunashvili|2016}}

'''Petru Maior''' ({{IPA-ro|ˈpetru ˈmajor}}; 1761 in [[Târgu Mureș|Marosvásárhely]] ''(now Târgu Mureș, Romania)'' – 14 February 1821 in [[Budapest]]) was a [[Romanians|Romanian]] writer who is considered one of the most influential personalities of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in [[Transylvania]] (the ''[[Transylvanian School]]''). Maior was a member of the [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Greek-Catholic]] clergy, a historian, philosopher, and linguist.

The ''Buda Lexicon'', a book published in 1825, included two texts by Petru Maior, ''Orthographia romana sive latino-valachica una cum clavi'' and ''Dialogu pentru inceputul linbei române'', in which he introduced the letters ș for {{IPA|/ʃ/}} and ț for {{IPA|/ts/}}, which have since been in use in the [[Romanian alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;Marinella Lörinczi Angioni, "Coscienza nazionale romanza e ortografia: il romeno tra alfabeto cirillico e alfabeto latino ", ''La Ricerca Folklorica'', No. 5, La scrittura: funzioni e ideologie. (Apr., 1982), pp. 75–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family background==
Patai was born in [[Budapest]], [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1910 to Edith Ehrenfeld Patai and [[Joseph Patai|József Patai]].  Patai's mother was born in [[Nagyvárad]] to German-speaking, Jewish parents who expressed their commitment to Magyar nationalism by sending their daughter to Hungarian-language schools.&lt;ref name="Reconstructiong National Identity 2001, pp.31-32"&gt;[[Marsha Rozenblit]], Reconstructiong National Identity, Oxford, 2001, pp.31-32&lt;/ref&gt;  Both parents spoke Hungarian and German fluently, and educated their children to be perfectly fluent in both Hungarian and German.&lt;ref name="Reconstructiong National Identity 2001, pp.31-32"/&gt;  His father was a prominent literary figure, author of numerous [[Zionist]] and other writings, including a biography of [[Theodor Herzl]]. József was founder and editor of the Jewish political and cultural journal ''[[Mult és jövő]]'', (''Past and Future'') from 1911 to 1944, a journal that was revived in 1988 by János Köbányai in Budapest.  József Patai also wrote an early [[History of the Jews in Hungary|History of Hungarian Jews]], and founded a Zionist organization in Hungary that procured support for the settlement of Jews in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]].

==Education==
Raphael Patai studied at [[rabbi]]nical [[seminaries]] in and at the [[Eötvös Loránd University|University of Budapest]] and the [[University of Breslau]], from which he received a doctorate in [[Semitic languages]] and [[Middle East|Oriental]] history. He moved to Palestine in 1933, where his parents joined him in 1939, after he received the first doctorate awarded by the [[Hebrew University]] of Jerusalem, in 1936. He returned briefly to Budapest where he completed his ordination at the Budapest Rabbinical Seminary.

==Career==
During the late 1930s and early 1940s Patai taught at the Hebrew University and served as the secretary of the [[Haifa]] [[Technion]]. He founded the [[Palestine Institute of Folklore and Ethnology]] in 1944, serving as its director of research for four years. He also served as scientific director of a Jewish folklore studies program for the [[Gerard Behar Center|Beit Ha'Am]] public cultural program in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.co.il/books?id=IrF7ZYWMO8MC&amp;pg=PA436 |title= Journeyman in Jerusalem: Memories and Letters, 1933-1947|first=Raphael|last=Patai|authorlink=Raphael Patai|year=2000|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn= 0739102095|page=436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947 Patai went to [[New York City|New York]] with a fellowship from the [[Viking Fund for Anthropological Research]]; he also studied the [[List of Mexican Jews|Jews of Mexico]]. Patai settled in the [[United States of America|United States]], becoming a naturalized [[citizen]] in 1952. He held [[visiting professor]]ships at a number of the country's most prestigious colleges, including [[Columbia University|Columbia]], the [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[New York University]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], and [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]]. He held full professorships of anthropology at [[Dropsie College]] from 1948 to 1957 and at [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]]. In 1952 he was asked by the [[United Nations]] to direct a research project on [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Jordan]] for the [[Human Relations Area Files]].

Patai's work was wide-ranging but focused primarily on the cultural development of the ancient [[Hebrews]] and [[Israelites]], on [[Jewish history]] and [[Jewish culture|culture]], and on the anthropology of the [[Middle East]] generally. He was the author of hundreds of scholarly articles and several dozen books, including three autobiographical volumes.

==Awards==
In 1936, Patai was the co-recipient (jointly with [[Moshe Zvi Segal]]) of the [[Bialik Prize]] for Jewish thought.&lt;ref name=bialik&gt;{{Cite web| title = List of Bialik Prize recipients 1933-2004 (in Hebrew), Tel Aviv Municipality website| url = http://www.tel-aviv.gov.il/Hebrew/_MultimediaServer/Documents/12516738.pdf| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071217143811/http://www.tel-aviv.gov.il/Hebrew/_MultimediaServer/Documents/12516738.pdf| archivedate = 2007-12-17| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Patai married Naomi Tolkowsky, whose family had moved to what was then Palestine in the early twentieth century; they had two daughters, Jennifer (born 1942) and [[Daphne Patai|Daphne]] (born 1943).
He died in 1996 in [[Tucson, Arizona]] at the age of 85.
Longtime [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] [[organic chemistry]] professor Saul Patai&lt;ref&gt;http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-300295.html&lt;/ref&gt; (1918-1998) was his brother.

'''Slavo-Serbia''' ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: Слов’яносе́рбія; [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: Славеносрбија or ''Slavenosrbija''; archaic Serbian name: Славено-Сербія) was a territory of [[Imperial Russia]] between 1753-64. It was located by the right bank of the [[Donets River]] between the [[Bakhmutka River|Bakhmutka]] (Бахмут) and [[Luhan River|Luhan]] (Лугань) rivers. This area today constitutes the territories of present-day [[Luhansk Oblast]] and [[Donetsk Oblast]] of [[Ukraine]]. The administrative centre of Slavo-Serbia was [[Bakhmut]] (Bahmut).

==History==
{{moresources|section|date=August 2016}}
By the decree of the [[Governing Senate|Senate]] of May 29, 1753, the free lands of this area were offered for settlement to [[Serbs]], [[Vlachs]] (Romanians), Bulgarians, Greeks and other [[Balkan]] peoples of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] denomination to ensure frontier protection and development of this part of the [[steppes]].&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Dictionary of Ukraine'' by Ivan Katchanovski, Zenon E. Kohut, Bohdan Y. Nebesio, and Myroslav Yurkevich, vol. 2, Scarecrow Press, 2013; {{ISBN|081087847X}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-h6r57lDC4QC&amp;pg=PA392&amp;dq=serbia+russia+regiments+1764&amp;hl=bg&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ek5SUpulE8bVtAaiiIEw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=serbia%20russia%20regiments%201764&amp;f=false pp. 392-93, 584]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Slavo-Serbia was directly governed by Russia's [[Governing Senate]] and [[College of War]]. The settlers eventually formed the '''Bakhmut [[hussar]] regiment''' in 1764. Also in 1764, Slavo-Serbia was transformed into the [[Donets]] [[uyezd]] of [[Yekaterinoslav Governorate]] (now in [[Dnipropetrovs'ka oblast']], [[Ukraine]]). Commandants of Slavo-Serbia were Colonels [[Rajko Preradović]] and [[Jovan Šević]]. These Serbian colonels led their soldiers in various Russian military campaigns; in peacetime they kept the borderlands, along with the Cossacks, free from incursions by other states.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

==Demographics==
{{unsourced|section|date=August 2016}}
The province had ethnically diverse population that included [[Serbs]], [[Vlachs]] (Romanians), and others. In 1755, the population of Slavo-Serbia numbered 1,513 inhabitants (of both genders). In 1756, in the regiment of Jovan Šević, there were 38% [[Serbs]], 23% [[Vlachs]], and 22% others.&lt;ref&gt;Posunjko 2002, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; In 1763, the population of Slavo-Serbia numbered 3,992 male inhabitants, of whom only 378 were Serbs.

{{Indonesian name}}
'''Soedjatmoko''' (born '''Soedjatmoko Mangoendiningrat'''; 10 January 1922&amp;nbsp;– 21 December 1989), familiarly called '''Bung Koko''',&lt;ref name=ugm/&gt; was an Indonesian intellectual and diplomat. Born to a noble father and mother in [[Sawahlunto]], [[West Sumatra]], after finishing his primary education, he went to Batavia (modern day [[Jakarta]]) to study medicine; in the city's slums, he saw much poverty, which became an academic interest later in life. After being expelled from medical school by the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese]] in 1943 for his political activities, Soedjatmoko moved to [[Surakarta]] and practised medicine with his father. In 1947, after Indonesia [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|proclaimed its independence]], Soedjatmoko and two other youths were deployed to [[Lake Success, New York]], to represent Indonesia at the [[United Nations]] (UN). They helped secure international recognition of the country's sovereignty.

After his work at the UN, Soedjatmoko attempted to study at [[Harvard]]'s Littauer Center for Public Administration (now the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]]); however, he was forced to resign due to pressure from other work, including serving as Indonesia's first [[chargé d'affaires]] in London for three months as well as establishing the political desk at the [[Embassy of Indonesia, Washington, D.C.|Embassy of Indonesia]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] By 1952 he had returned to Indonesia, where he became involved in the [[socialism|socialist]] press and joined the [[Socialist Party of Indonesia]]. He was elected as a member of the [[Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia]] in 1955, serving until 1959; he married Ratmini Gandasubrata in 1958. However, as President [[Sukarno]]'s government became more authoritarian Soedjatmoko began to criticise the government. To avoid censorship, he spent two years as a guest lecturer at [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York]], and another three in self-imposed unemployment in Indonesia.

After Sukarno was replaced by [[Suharto]], Soedjatmoko returned to public service. In 1966 he was sent as one of Indonesia's representatives at the UN, and in 1968 he became Indonesia's ambassador to the US; during this time he received several honorary doctoral degrees. He also advised foreign minister [[Adam Malik]]. After returning to Indonesia in 1971, Soedjatmoko held a position in several think tanks. After the [[Malari incident]] in January 1974, Soedjatmoko was held for interrogation for two and a half weeks and accused of masterminding the event. Although eventually released, he could not leave Indonesia for two and a half years. In 1978 Soedjatmoko received the [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]] for International Understanding, and in 1980 he was chosen as rector of the [[United Nations University]] in [[Tokyo]]. Two years after returning from Japan, Soedjatmoko died of cardiac arrest while teaching in [[Yogyakarta]].

==Early life==
Soedjatmoko was born on 10 January 1922 in [[Sawahlunto]], [[West Sumatra]], with the name Soedjatmoko Mangoendiningrat. He was the eldest son of Saleh Mangoendiningrat, a Javanese physician of noble descent from [[Madiun]], and Isnadikin, a Javanese housewife from [[Ponorogo]]; the couple had three other children, as well as two adopted children.&lt;ref name=rmaf/&gt; Soedjatmoko's younger brother, [[Nugroho Wisnumurti]], went on to work at the United Nations.&lt;ref name=ugm/&gt; When he was two years old, he and his family moved to the Netherlands after his father received a five-year scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kahin|Barnett|1990|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to Indonesia, Soedjatmoko continued his studies at an elementary school for European called ELS in [[Manado]], [[North Sulawesi]].&lt;ref name=rmaf/&gt;&lt;ref name="legge90"&gt;{{harvnb|Legge|2010|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soedjatmoko later attended the Surabaya HBS (secondary school) and graduated in 1940.&lt;ref name="kahin134"/&gt; The school introduced him to Latin and Greek, and one of his teachers introduced him to [[European art]]; he later recalled that this introduction had allowed him to see Europeans as more than colonists.&lt;ref name=rmaf/&gt; He then continued to medical school in Batavia (modern day [[Jakarta]]). Upon seeing the slums of Jakarta, he was drawn to the issue of poverty; this later became an academic interest of his.&lt;ref name=rmaf/&gt; However, during the [[Japanese Occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation]], in 1943, he was expelled from the city due to his relationship with [[Sutan Sjahrir]]&amp;nbsp;– who had married Soedjatmoko's sister Siti Wahyunah&lt;ref name=ugm&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ugm.ac.id/en/?q=news/contemplating-soedjatmoko%E2%80%99s-thought-about-intellectuals |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66MjPaG4F?url=http://www.ugm.ac.id/en/?q=news%2Fcontemplating-soedjatmoko%E2%80%99s-thought-about-intellectuals |title=Contemplating Soedjatmoko’s Thought about Intellectuals |publisher=Gadjah Mada University |archivedate=23 March 2012 |accessdate=23 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– and participation in protests against the occupation.&lt;ref name=rmaf/&gt;&lt;ref name="kahin134"&gt;{{harvnb|Kahin|Barnett|1990|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his expulsion, Soedjatmoko moved to [[Surakarta]] and studied Western history and political literature, which led to an interest in socialism.&lt;ref name="kahin134"/&gt; Some figure that affected him besides [[Karl Marx]] were [[Ortega y Gasset]] and [[Jan Romein]].&lt;ref name="legge90"/&gt; While in Surakarta he also worked at his father's hospital. After Indonesia [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|proclaimed its independence]], Soedjatmoko was asked to become Deputy Head of the Foreign Press Department in the Ministry of Information.&lt;ref name=rmaf/&gt; In 1946, at the request of Prime Minister Sjahrir, he and two friends established a Dutch-language weekly, ''Het Inzicht'' (''Inside''), as a counter to the Dutch-sponsored ''Het Uίtzicht'' (''Outlook''). The next year, they launched a socialist-oriented journal, ''Siasat'' (''Tactics''), which was published weekly.&lt;ref name="kahin134"/&gt;&lt;ref name=unu/&gt; During this period Soedjatmoko dropped the name Mangoendiningrat, as it reminded him of the feudal aspects of Indonesian culture.&lt;ref name=rmaf/&gt;

==Work in the US==
In 1947, Sjahrir sent Soedjatmoko to New York as a member of the Indonesian Republic's "observer" delegation to the United Nations (UN).&lt;ref name="kahin134"/&gt; The delegation travelled to the United States via the Philippines after a two-month stay in Singapore; while in the Philippines, President [[Manuel Roxas]] guaranteed support of the nascent nation's case at the United Nations.&lt;ref name=rmaf/&gt; Soedjatmoko stayed in [[Lake Success, New York]], the temporary location of the UN, and participated in debates over international recognition of the new country.&lt;ref name=citation/&gt; Towards the end of his stay in New York, Soedjatmoko enrolled at [[Harvard]]'s Littauer Center; as, at the time, he was still part of the UN delegation, he commuted between New York and [[Boston]] for seven months. After being released from the delegation, he spent most of a year at the Center; for a period of three months, however, he was [[chargé d'affaires]]&amp;nbsp;– the nation's first&amp;nbsp;– at the Dutch East Indies desk of the Dutch embassy in London, serving in a temporary capacity while the Indonesian embassy was being established.&lt;ref name=rmaf/&gt;

In 1951, Soedjatmoko moved to [[Washington D.C.]] to establish the political desk at the [[Embassy of Indonesia, Washington, D.C.|Indonesian embassy there]];&lt;ref name="kahin134"/&gt; he also became Alternate Permanent Representative of Indonesia at the UN. This busy schedule, demanding a commute between three cities, proved to be too much for him and he dropped out of the Littauer Center.&lt;ref name=rmaf/&gt; In late 1951, he resigned from his positions and went to Europe for nine months, seeking political inspiration. In Yugoslavia, he met [[Milovan Djilas]], who impressed him greatly.&lt;ref name=rmaf/&gt;&lt;ref name="kahin134"/&gt;

==Return to Indonesia==
Upon returning to Indonesia, Soedjatmoko once again became an editor of ''Siasat''. In 1952, he was one of the founders of Socialist Party daily ''Pedoman'' (''Guidance''); this was followed by a political journal, ''Konfrontasi'' (''Confrontation''). He also helped to establish the Pembangunan publishing house, which he directed until 1961.&lt;ref name="kahin134"/&gt; Soedjatmoko joined the [[Indonesian Socialist Party]] ({{lang|id|Partai Sosialis Indonesia}}, or PSI) in 1955, and was elected as a member of [[Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia]] in the [[Indonesian Constituent Assembly election, 1955|1955 elections]] until the dissolution of the assembly in 1959.&lt;ref name="kahin134"/&gt; He served with the Indonesian delegation at the [[Bandung Conference]] in 1955. Later the same year, he founded the [[Indonesian Institute of World Affairs]] and became its Secretary General for four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kahin|Barnett|1990|pp=134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soedjatmoko married Ratmini Gandasubrata in 1958. Together they had three daughters.&lt;ref name=rmaf/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

Towards the end of the 1950s, Soedjatmoko and President [[Sukarno]], with whom he had had a warm working relationship, had a falling out over the president's increasingly authoritarian policies. In 1960 Soedjatmoko co-founded and headed the Democratic League, which attempted to promote democracy in the country;&lt;ref name=rmaf/&gt; he also opposed Sukarno's [[Guided Democracy]] policy.&lt;ref name=citation/&gt; When the effort failed, Soedjatmoko went to the US and took a position as guest lecturer at [[Cornell University]]. When he returned to Indonesia in 1962, he discovered that key members of the PSI had been arrested and the party banned; both ''Siasat'' and ''Pedoman'' were closed. To avoid trouble with the government, Soedjatmoko voluntarily left himself unemployed until 1965, when he became co-editor of ''An Introduction to Indonesian Historiography''.&lt;ref name=rmaf/&gt;

==Ambassadorship and academic activities==
After the failed [[30 September Movement|coup d'état]] in 1965 and the replacement of Sukarno by [[Suharto]], Soedjatmoko returned to public service. He served as vice-chairman of the Indonesian delegation at the UN in 1966, becoming the delegation's adviser in 1967. Also in 1967, Soedjatmoko became adviser to foreign minister [[Adam Malik]], as well as a member of the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]], a London-based [[think tank]]; the following year he became Indonesian ambassador to the United States, a position which he held until 1971. During his time as ambassador, Soedjatmoko received [[honorary doctorate]]s from several American universities, including [[Cedar Crest College]] in 1969 and [[Yale]] in 1970. He also published another book, ''Southeast Asia Today and Tomorrow'' (1969).&lt;ref name=rmaf/&gt;

Soedjatmoko returned to Indonesia in 1971; upon his return he became Special Adviser on Social and Cultural Affairs to the Chairman of the National Development Planning Agency. That same year, he became a board member of the London-based [[International Institute for Environment and Development]], a position which he held until 1976; he also joined the [[Club of Rome]].&lt;ref name=rmaf/&gt; In 1972 Soedjatmoko was selected to the board of trustees of the [[Ford Foundation]], in which position he served 12 years; also in 1972 he became a governor of the [[Asian Institute of Management]], a position which he held for two years.&lt;ref name=rmaf&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/Biography/BiographySoedjatmoko.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66MDghef4?url=http://www.rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/Biography/BiographySoedjatmoko.htm |title=Biography of Soedjatmoko |publisher=Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation |archivedate=22 March 2012 |accessdate=22 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unu/&gt; The following year he became a governor of the [[International Development Research Center]]. In 1974, based on falsified documents, he was accused of planning the [[Malari incident]] of January 1974, in which students protested and eventually rioted during a state visit by Prime Minister of Japan [[Kakuei Tanaka]]. Held for interrogation for two and a half weeks, Soedjatmoko was not allowed to leave Indonesia for two and a half years for his suspected involvement.&lt;ref name=rmaf/&gt;

In 1978 Soedjatmoko received the [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]] for International Understanding, often called Asia's [[Nobel Prize]].&lt;ref name=rmaf/&gt;&lt;ref name=unu/&gt; The citation read, in part: &lt;blockquote&gt;Encouraging both Asians and outsiders to look more carefully at the village folkways they would modernize, [Sodjatmoko] is fostering awareness of the human dimension essential to all development. [...] [H]is writings have added consequentially to the body of international thinking on what can be done to meet one of the greatest challenges of our time; how to make life more decent and satisfying for the poorest 40 percent in Southeastern and southern Asia.&lt;ref name=citation&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/Citation/CitationSoedjatmoko.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66Mi06lnA?url=http://www.rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/Citation/CitationSoedjatmoko.htm |title=Citation for Soedjatmoko |publisher=Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation |archivedate=22 March 2012 |accessdate=22 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; In response, Soedjatmoko said he felt "humbled, because of [his] awareness that whatever small contribution [he] may have made is dwarfed by the magnitude of the problem of persistent poverty and human suffering in Asia, and by the realization of how much still remains to be done."&lt;ref name=response&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/Response/ResponseSoedjatmoko.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66MiORHYM?url=http://www.rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/Response/ResponseSoedjatmoko.htm |title=Response of Soedjatmoko |publisher=Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation |archivedate=22 March 2012 |accessdate=22 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and death==
In 1980 Soedjatmoko moved to Tokyo, Japan. In September of that year he began service as the rector of the [[United Nations University]], replacing James M. Hester; he remained in that position until 1987. In Japan he published two further books, ''The Primacy of Freedom in Development'' and ''Development and Freedom''. He received the [[Asia Society Award]] in 1985, and the Universities Field Staff International Award for Distinguished Service to the Advancement of International Understanding the following year.&lt;ref name=unu&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unu.edu/about/history/former-rectors/dr-soedjatmoko |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66MDIpt5n?url=http://unu.edu/about/history/former-rectors/dr-soedjatmoko |title=Dr. Soedjatmoko |publisher=United Nations University |archivedate=22 March 2012 |accessdate=21 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Soedjatmoko died of cardiac arrest on 21 December 1989 when he was lecturing at [[Muhammadiyah University of Yogyakarta]].&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/22/obituaries/soedjatmoko-67-indonesia-diplomat-and-social-scientist.html |title=Soedjatmoko, 67, Indonesia Diplomat And Social Scientist |newspaper=The New York Times |date=22 December 1989 |accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kahin|Barnett|1990|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stoke Mill''' is a 19th century corn mill on the [[River Wey]] that has been converted into offices.  It is situated off the Woking Road just north of [[Guildford]] town centre. It forms the centrepiece of a small group of buildings that includes the [[Listed Building|Grade II listed]] Stoke Mill House.

==History==
[[Domesday Book|Domesday]] lists a [[water mill|mill]] at ''Stochae'' on the King's land.  About 1635, [[Richard Weston (canal builder)|Sir Richard Weston]] built the first paper mill in Surrey here. By 1740 it was also used for grinding corn. This was eventually replaced by a single story mill, with three pairs of stones, after the original was destroyed by fire in 1863. Papermaking ceased in 1869.&lt;ref name="Stidder"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stidder|first1=Derek|title=The Watermills of Surrey|date=1990|publisher=Barracuda Books|location=Buckingham|isbn=0 86023 480 0|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879 a modern five-story brick built corn mill was constructed alongside and the older mill became a store.&lt;ref name="Crocker"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Crocker|editor1-first=Glenys|title=A Guide to the Industrial Archeology of Surrey|date=1991|publisher=Association for Surrey Archeology|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1894 the new mill was converted to metal rollers to grind the corn and a water turbine had replaced the waterwheel by 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hillier|first1=Jack|title=Old Surrey Water Mills|date=1951|publisher=Skeffington and Sons Ltd|location=London|page=109|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mill ceased working in 1957. After a period of commercial use as a store and boatyard,&lt;ref name=Stidder /&gt; the building was converted to offices in 1989 and is now occupied by the [[Surrey Advertiser|Surrey Advertiser Group]].&lt;ref name="Crocker" /&gt;

==Millers==
*The first known tenant was John Russel in 1740
*Jasper Franks was tenant in 1842
*John Holden was miller until 1847
*H Saunders held the lease from 1850 to 1855.
*Taken over by Frederick and  Henry Bowyer, whose family ran the mill until 1938,&lt;ref name=Stidder /&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Takase Site'''|高瀬遺跡|}} is an [[archaeological site]] in the city of [[Nanto, Toyama|Nanto]], [[Toyama Prefecture]] in the [[Hokuriku region]] of [[Japan]] containing the ruins of a ''[[shōen]]'' from the early [[Heian period]]. It has been protected by the central government as a [[Historic Sites of Japan|National Historic Site]] since 1981. It was the first ruin of a ''shōen'' to receive such status.&lt;ref name= "Bunka"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://bunka.nii.ac.jp/heritages/detail/210030 |title=高瀬遺跡|work=Cultural Heritage Online|publisher=Agency for Cultural Affairs|language=Japanese|accessdate=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outline==
The area south Takase Shrine, a [[Shinto shrine]] in the city of Nanto was known for many years as a location where shards of [[Sue pottery]] and [[Haji pottery]] could be found. During field maintenance work in 1970, the foundations of a building were discovered. In subsequent excavations in 1972, the foundations of three buildings were discovered, and were determined to be the administrative buildings associated with a ''shōen'' [[landed estate]] from the early Heian period. Historical records indicate that the great temple of [[Tōdai-ji]] in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] had such an estate in Etchū Province during this period.

'''''The Arctic Home in the Vedas''''' is a book on the origin of [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Aryanic People]] by [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]], a mathematician turned [[astronomer]], historian, journalist, philosopher and political leader of India. It propounded the idea that the [[North Pole]] was the original home of Aryans during the pre-glacial period which they had to leave due to the ice deluge around [[8th millennium BC|8000 B.C.]] and had to migrate to the Northern parts of Europe and Asia in search of lands for new settlements. In support to his theory, Tilak presented certain [[Vedic]] hymns, [[Avestic]] passages, Vedic chronology and Vedic calendars with interpretations of the contents in detail.

The book was written at the end of 1898, but was first published in March 1903 in [[Pune]].

==Background==
Man was believed to be post-[[glacial]], and the theory of an Asiatic origin of the Aryan peoples prevailed. The age of the oldest Vedic period, however, was carried back to 4500 BC by scholars including the author himself after scientific astronomical research in correlation with the evidence found in the Vedic hymns.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Tilak cites a book by [[William Fairfield Warren|William F. Warren]], the first President of [[Boston University]], ''Paradise Found or the Cradle of the Human Race at the North Pole'', as having anticipated his ideas to some extent. Warren dedicated his book to [[Max Müller]], with whom Tilak had shared ideas before the book{{clarify|reason=Tilak's book or Warren's?|date=July 2016}} was completed.

Tilak held the view that further study of Vedic hymns and Avestan passages might reveal the long vista of primitive Aryan antiquity.

==Summary of Tilak’s polar theory==
*[[Neolithic]] Aryan race in Europe cannot be regarded as [[indigenous peoples|autochthonous]], nor European Aryans descended from the [[Paleolithic]] man. Hence, question of the original Aryan home is still unsettled.
*In the early geological ages, the [[Alps]] were low, the [[Himalayas]] not yet upheaved, Asia and Africa were represented only by a group of islands and an equable and uniform climate prevailed over the whole surface of the globe. In those days, however, a warm climate prevailed in the Arctic region.
*The close of the [[Pliocene]] and the whole of the [[Pleistocene]] period were marked by violent changes of climate bringing on what is called the Glacial and Inter-Glacial epochs. A succession of cold and warm climates must have characterized these Glacial and Inter-Glacial periods which were also accompanied by extensive movements of depression and elevation of land, the depression taking place after the land was weighed down with the enormous mass of ice.
*Thus a period of glaciations was marked by elevation, extreme cold and the invasion of the ice-caps over regions of the present Temperate zone; while an inter-glacial period was accompanied by depression of land and milder and congenial climate which made even the Arctic regions habitable.
*According to the latest geological evidence, the last Glacial period must have closed and Post-Glacial must have commenced at about 10,000 years ago or 8,000 BC. There were at least two Glacial and one Inter-Glacial period, and the geographical distribution of land and water on the earth during the Inter-Glacial period was quite different from what it is at present. It was the coming on of the Glacial age that destroyed this genial climate and rendered the regions unsuited for the habitation of tropical plants and animals.
*At the North Pole, one sees the heavenly dome above seems to revolve around one like a [[potter's wheel]]. The stars will not rise and set but move round and round in horizontal planes during the long night of six months. The [[Sun]], when it is above the horizon for six months; would also appear to revolve in the same way but with some difference. The Northern celestial hemisphere will alone be visible spinning round and round and the Southern half remain invisible. The Sun going into the Northern hemisphere in his annual course will appear as coming up from the South. Living in the temperate and tropical zones, however, one sees all heavenly objects rise in the East and set in the West, some passing over the head, others traveling obliquely.
*The long dawn of two months is a special and important characteristic of the North Pole. As we descend southward, the splendor and the duration of the dawn will be witnessed on a less and less magnificent scale. But the dawn occurring at the end of the long night of two, three or more months will still be unusually long, often of several days duration.
*All these characteristics of an Arctic home are clearly recorded in several Vedic hymns and Avestic passages and they come to us sometimes as the description of the prevailing conditions or the day-to-day experience or stories told by the earlier generation and sometimes as [[myths]].

==Chronology of the post-glacial period==
[[File:Lokmanya.jpg|thumb|Tilak in his Study]]
*10,000 to 8000 BC – The destruction of the original Arctic home by the last [[Ice Age]] and the commencement of the post-Glacial period.
*8000 to 5000 BC – The age of migration from the original home. The survivors of the Aryan race roamed over the northern parts of Europe and Asia in search of lands suitable for new settlements. Tilak calls it the ''Pre-Orion Period''.
*5000 to 3000 BC. -  The Orion period, when the vernal equinox was in [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]]. Many Vedic hymns can be traced to the early part of this period and the [[bards]] of the race seem to have not yet forgotten the real importance of the traditions of the Arctic home inherited by them. It was at this time that first attempts to reform the calendar and the [[sacrificial]] system appear to have been systematically made.
*3000 to 1400 BC – The ''[[Krittika]]'' period, when the [[Vernal equinox]] was in [[Pleiades]]. The traditions about the original Arctic home had grown dim by this time and were often misunderstood, making the Vedic hymns less and less intelligible.
*1400 to 500 BC – The Pre-Buddhistic period, when the [[Sūtra|Sutras]] and the Philosophical systems made their appearance.

'''''The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ''''' is a book written by [[Lynn Picknett]] and Clive Prince and published in [[1997 in literature|1997]] by Transworld Publishers Ltd in Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand.  It proposes a fringe [[hypothesis]] regarding the relationship between [[Jesus]], [[John the Baptist]] and [[Mary Magdalene]], and states that their true story has been suppressed by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] through, among other tactics, the conscious selection of the texts that make up the [[Biblical canon|canonical]] [[New Testament]], their campaigns against [[heresy]], and their [[propaganda]] against non-Christians.

While researching the life and works of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], including "his part in faking the [[Turin Shroud]]" which the authors document in their book "Turin Shroud— In Whose Image?", they discover a number of signs of unorthodox Christian thinking in the imagery used to portray some of the central characters in the New Testament, especially John the Baptist.  Some paintings examined for their unusual choice of imagery include the two versions of ''[[Virgin of the Rocks|Madonna of the Rocks]]'' and ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]''.

In the latter painting, they propose that the person in the painting seated, from a viewer’s point of view,  to the left of Jesus is [[Mary Magdalene]] rather than [[John the Apostle]], as most art historians identify that person.  Furthermore, they point out that their body angles form the letter M,  a reference to the Magdalene, and that she and Jesus are dressed in similar but oppositely colored clothes, a negative image of each other.  They also mention a number of other signs: a mystery knife pointed at one of the characters, that Leonardo da Vinci himself is in the painting with his face pointing away from Jesus, and that Jesus is confronted by an admonishing hand to his right making “the John gesture,” an index finger pointing up.

In trying to understand the significance of these unusual images they conducted research into what they term a “thread of heresy” that reaches back over 2000 years.  They claim to find evidence for this [[occult]] tradition in such assorted subjects as [[Knights Templar|The Knights Templar]], the [[Cathar]]s, [[Gnosticism]], the [[Holy Grail]], and the legends connected with southern France, and in particular the town of [[Rennes-le-Château]].  They utilise the historical and biblical scholarship of such people as [[Morton Smith]], [[Hugh J. Schonfield]], [[G.R.S. Mead]], [[Frances Yates|Frances A. Yates]], and [[Geza Vermes]] on which to build their claims.

Among their conclusions are the following:
* Jesus was a disciple of John the Baptist, and that John’s religious teachings were essentially that of the Egyptian [[mystery religion]] of [[Isis]]-[[Osiris]]-[[Horus]].
* Jesus was initiated into the inner circle of John the Baptist, but was not selected to succeed him.  Rather it was [[Simon Magus]] who was selected as John the Baptist’s successor.
* Mary Magdalene had a ritualized, “sacred” sexual relationship with Jesus, in keeping with their religious beliefs, and as his initiator into the sacred mysteries had an equal relationship to Jesus.
* Politics and religion were synonymous in ancient [[Israel]], and Jesus was an astute and aggressive political competitor against John.
* The Jesus group may have been responsible for the death of John the Baptist.
* Jesus’ disciples were not initiated into the inner mysteries of his teachings.
* The term ''[[Christ]]'' had a different significance to the participants in the biblical drama than they do nowadays.  To those in John the Baptist’s circle it would have referred to all who were baptized and initiated into the arcana of their belief system.
* Numerous images and stories in the canonical New Testament are in actuality adaptations of those found in other religious traditions, and are not unique.
* Jesus is one in a line of many [[life-death-rebirth deity|dying-and-rising gods]], who share many similar traits.

The authors offer, but not claim, that perhaps Leonardo da Vinci was sending veiled messages through his art, which could be understood only by others who were open to their meaning.  And while on the surface these paintings seem to be simple biblical depictions, they represent in fact his belief in the superiority of John the Baptist over Jesus.

== Perspective and criticism ==
Seven years after this book was published, some of the ideas presented in this and other similar books  (e.g. [[The Last Templar]]), have become central to the best-selling novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' by [[Dan Brown]]. It may seem that ''The Templar Revelation'' even provided Brown with the title of his novel: one chapter is called "The Secret Code of Leonardo Da Vinci". Brown's reliance on ''The Templar Revelation'' is also confirmed by the fact that he imports certain  factual errors from this book (see [[Église Saint-Sulpice, Paris]] for an example).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16216">An '''audio format''' is a medium for [[sound recording and reproduction]].  The term is applied to both the physical [[recording media]] and the [[recording format]]s of the [[Audio frequency|audio content]]—in [[computer science]] it is often limited to the [[audio file format]], but its wider use usually refers to the physical method used to store the data.

Music is recorded and distributed using a variety of audio formats, some of which store additional information.

'''Trond Bergh''' (born 16 September 1946) is a Norwegian [[economic history|economic historian]], and researcher at the Department of Innovation and Economic Organisation of the [[BI Norwegian Business School]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bi.edu/research/employees/?ansattid=fgl99017 Trond Bergh] at BI Norwegian Business School. Accessed 11 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and work ==
Bergh was born in [[Tvedestrand]], and took the [[cand.philol.]] degree at the [[University of Oslo]] in 1973. 

Bergh was the director of the [[Labour Movement Archive and Library]] from 1989 to 1999, and was then employed at the Centre for Business History and, later at the Department of Innovation and Economic Organisation of [[BI Norwegian Business School]].&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Trond Bergh|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=Henriksen, Petter|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|first=|last=|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Trond_Bergh|language=Norwegian|accessdate=17 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the latter work Bergh became involved in a legal case. Former secretary of the [[Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs]] [[Haakon Bingen]] sued Bergh and Eriksen as well as the publishing house Cappelen Akademiske Forlag, because the second volume of ''Den hemmelige krigen'' contained information that portrayed Bingen as a close friend of communist [[Peder Furubotn]]. In late 1999 the [[Supreme Court of Norway]] found that this was not true, and circulation of the book was forbidden, until the reference to Bingen had been amended. Bingen was also entitled to {{NOK|146,975}} of costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bingen vant mot forlag i Høyesterett|agency=Norwegian News Agency|date=2 December 1999|page=6|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
Bergh's books on Norwegian economic history include ''Vekst og Velstand'' (1977), ''Norge fra u-land til i-land'' (1983) and ''Foredlet virke: Historien om Borregaard 1889–1989'' (with [[Even Lange]], 1989). He also penned ''Storhetstid 1945–1965'', released 1987 as volume five of ''[[Arbeiderbevegelsens historie i Norge]]'', and in 1998 he released the two-volume history on surveillance in Norway, ''Den hemmelige krigen: overvåking i Norge 1914–1997'' about [[surveillance]] together with [[Knut Einar Eriksen]].&lt;ref name=snl/&gt;

Bergh has also written volume I of the two-volume series from 2004 on the railway history of Norway, ''Jernbanen i Norge 1854–2004'', the first volume covering the period from 1854 to 1940.&lt;ref name=bergh2004&gt;{{cite book|series=Jernbanen i Norge 1854–2004|title=Nye spor og nye muligheter. 1854–1940|first=Trond|last=Bergh |volume=1|language=Norwegian |location=Bergen|publisher=Vigmostad Bjørke|year=2004 |isbn=82-419-0331-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ussher chronology''' is a 17th-century [[chronology]] of the [[history]] of the world [[Biblical literalist chronology|formulated from a literal reading]] of the [[Old Testament]] by [[James Ussher]], the [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Armagh]] and [[Primate of All Ireland]]. The chronology is sometimes associated with [[young Earth creationism]], which holds that the Universe was created only a few millennia ago by God as described in the first two chapters of the [[Books of the Bible|biblical book]] of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].  Ussher fell into disrepute in the 19th century.

Published in 1650, the full title of Ussher's work in Latin is ''Annales Veteris Testamenti, a prima mundi origine deducti, una cum rerum Asiaticarum et Aegyptiacarum chronico, a temporis historici principio usque ad Maccabaicorum initia producto'' ("Annals of the Old Testament, deduced from the first origins of the world, the chronicle of Asiatic and Egyptian matters together produced from the beginning of historical time up to the beginnings of [[Maccabees]]").

Ussher's work was his contribution to the long-running theological debate on the age of the [[Earth]]. This was a major concern of many [[Christian]] scholars over the centuries.

The chronology is sometimes called the Ussher{{endash}}Lightfoot chronology because [[John Lightfoot]] published a similar chronology in 1642–1644. This, however, is a misnomer, as the chronology is based on Ussher's work alone and not that of Lightfoot. Ussher deduced that the first day of [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] fell upon, October 23, 4004&amp;nbsp;BC, in the [[proleptic Julian calendar]], near the [[autumnal equinox]]. Lightfoot similarly deduced that Creation began at nightfall near the autumnal equinox, but in the year 3929 BC.

Ussher's proposed date of [[4004 BC]] differed little from [[Dating Creation#Date of Creation according to the Pentateuch|other Biblically-based estimates]], such as those of [[Jose ben Halafta]] (3761 BC), [[Bede]] (3952 BC), Ussher's near-contemporary [[Joseph Justus Scaliger|Scaliger]] (3949 BC), [[Johannes Kepler]] (3992 BC) or [[Sir Isaac Newton]] (c. 4000 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William W. Hay|title=Experimenting on a Small Planet: A Scholarly Entertainment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=teJYlWH9vg4C&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=November 17, 2013|year=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783642285608|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Dubious|date=October 2017}} Ussher was influenced by the same account as the [[apocrypha]]l [[Book of Jasher (biblical references)|Book of Jasher]], dating the worldwide flood to 2349 BC and the birth of [[Terah]] in 2127 BC. The date of 4000 BC as the creation of [[Adam]] was at least partially influenced by the widely held belief that the Earth was approximately 5600 years old (2000 to Abraham, 2000 from Abraham to the birth of [[Christ (title)|Christ]], and 1600 years from Christ to Ussher), corresponding to the six days of Creation, on the grounds that "one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day" ({{bibleverse|2|Peter|3:8|KJV}}). This tradition was believed to indicate that Jesus would return in 2000 AD,&lt;ref name="Newport2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth G. C. Newport|title=Apocalypse and millennium: studies in biblical eisegesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f3Cm9ALJbe0C&amp;pg=PA104|accessdate=23 March 2011|date=28 August 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-77334-8|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RowlandBarton2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christopher Rowland|author2=John Barton|title=Apocalyptic in history and tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CrcoAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=23 March 2011|year=2002|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press|isbn=978-0-8264-6208-4|pages=233–252}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than six thousand years after 4004 BC. Modern proponents of this interpretation hold that the creation date 4004 BC could be inaccurate.

==Ussher's methods==
The chronologies of Ussher and other biblical scholars corresponded so closely because they used much the same methodology to calculate key events recorded in the [[Bible]]. Establishing the chronologies is complicated by the fact that the Bible was compiled by different authors over several centuries with lengthy chronological gaps, making it difficult to do a simple totaling of Biblical ages and dates. In his article on Ussher's calendar, James Barr has identified three distinct periods that Ussher and others had to tackle:&lt;ref&gt;James Barr, 1984-85. "[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1647&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF Why the World Was Created in 4004 BC: Archbishop Ussher and Biblical Chronology]", ''Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester'' '''67:'''603–607.&lt;/ref&gt;

# "''Creation to Abraham's migration.''" This section is fairly easy to calculate, using the chronological data in Genesis 5 and 11, which gives an unbroken male lineage, with dates, from the creation to Abraham being called out of Ur of the Chaldeans. Ussher uses the chronology found in the Masoretic text instead of the alternative chronologies found in the Septuagint and Samaritan Pentateuch. Ussher fixed this period as 2082 years, from 4004 to 1922 BC.
# ''"Abraham's migration to Solomon's temple."'' Ussher wrote the time from Abram leaving Haran to the Exodus was 430 years (400 years of persecution, 30 years after left Haran) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/AnnalsOfTheWorld/Annals#page/n23/mode/2up|title=Annals of the World|last=Ussher|first=James|publisher=|year=1650|isbn=|location=|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{bibleverse||1 Kings|6|KJV}} gives 480 years from the Exodus to the beginning of Solomon's temple in the fourth year of Solomon's reign. These 910 years span from 1922 to 1012 BC.
# ''"Period of the temple laid to the Babylonian captivity."'' This period is the most difficult to calculate, due to repeated difficulties in correlating the regnal years of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel. The simple addition of the reigns of Judah's kings gives 430 years, but by positing a few overlapping reigns, Ussher shortens this to 424 years: 1012 to 588 BC.

After reckoning the years from creation to the last kings of Judah, Ussher used {{bibleverse|2 Kings|25:27}} to establish the length of time from the creation to the accession of Babylonian king Amel-Marduk (also known as Evil-Merodach).&lt;ref name="barr-marduk"&gt;James Barr, 1984-85. "[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1647&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF Why the World Was Created in 4004 BC: Archbishop Ussher and Biblical Chronology]", ''Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester'' '''67:''' 579-580.&lt;/ref&gt; He then used information from Babylonian, Greek, and Roman sources to fix the date of Amel-Marduk's enthronment at 562 BC (after Nebuchadnezzar's death), from which he was able to deduce a creation in 4004 BC.&lt;ref name="barr-marduk" /&gt;

In fixing the date of Jesus' birth, Ussher took account of an error perpetrated by [[Dionysius Exiguus]], the founder of the [[Anno Domini]] numbering system. Ussher chose 5 BC as Christ's birth year&lt;ref name=Epistle/&gt; because [[Josephus]] indicated that the death of [[Herod the Great]] occurred in 4 BC.&lt;ref&gt;John P. Pratt, [http://www.johnpratt.com/items/docs/herod/herod.html "Yet another eclipse for Herod"], ''The Planetarian'', vol. 19, no. 4, Dec. 1990, pp. 8–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for the Gospel of Matthew to be correct, Jesus could not have been born after that date.

The season in which Creation occurred was the subject of considerable [[theology|theological]] debate in Ussher's time. Many scholars proposed it had taken place in the spring, the start of the Babylonian, Chaldean and other cultures' chronologies. Others, including Ussher, thought it more likely that it had occurred in the [[autumn]], largely because that season marked the beginning of the Jewish year.

Ussher further narrowed down the date by using the [[Hebrew calendar|Jewish calendar]] to establish the "first day" of creation as falling on a Sunday near the autumnal equinox.&lt;ref&gt;James Barr, 1984-85. "[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1647&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF Why the World Was Created in 4004 BC: Archbishop Ussher and Biblical Chronology]", ''Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester'' '''67:''' 591.&lt;/ref&gt; The day of the week was a backward calculation from the six days of creation with God resting on the seventh, which in the Jewish calendar is Saturday—hence, Creation began on a Sunday. The astronomical tables that Ussher probably used were [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]'s ''Tabulae Rudolphinae'' (''[[Rudolphine Tables]]'', 1627). Using them, he would have concluded that the equinox occurred on Tuesday, October 25, only one day earlier than the traditional day of its creation, on the fourth day of Creation week, Wednesday, along with the Sun, Moon, and stars {{bibleverse||Genesis|1:16|KJV}}. Modern equations place the autumnal equinox of 4004 BC on Sunday, October 23 (by the Julian calendar).&lt;ref&gt;[http://emr.cs.iit.edu/home/reingold/calendar-book/Calendrica.html Calendrica] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050216102054/http://emr.cs.iit.edu/home/reingold/calendar-book/Calendrica.html |date=2005-02-16 }} The position of the Sun at the autumnal equinox is 180°, where 0° is its position at the vernal equinox.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ussher's understanding of creation placed the "first day" referred to in {{bibleverse||Genesis|1:5|KJV}} on October 23, but with a "pre-creation" event, which he identified as the "beginning of time" occurring the previous night.&lt;ref&gt;James Barr, 1984-85. "[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1647&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF Why the World Was Created in 4004 BC: Archbishop Ussher and Biblical Chronology]", ''Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester'' '''67:''' 592.&lt;/ref&gt; Ussher referred to his dating of creation on the first page of ''Annales'' in Latin and on the first page of its English translation ''Annals of the World'' (1658). In the following extract from the English translation, the phrase "in the year of the Julian Calendar" refers to the Julian Period, of which year 1 is 4713 BC, and therefore year 710 is 4004 BC.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. Ge. 1:1 This beginning of time, according to our chronology, happened at the start of the evening preceding the 23rd day of October in the year of the Julian Calendar, 710.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ussher provides a slightly different time in his "Epistle to the Reader" in his Latin and English works:&lt;ref name=Epistle&gt;James Ussher, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VrHER1jYzhIC&amp;pg=PA9 "Epistle to the Reader"], ''Annals of the World'' (2003) page 9.&lt;/ref&gt; "I deduce that the time from the creation until midnight, January 1, 1 AD was 4003 years, seventy days and six hours." Six hours before midnight would be 6 pm.

==Ussher's chronology today==
{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}&lt;!--first two paragraphs have no citations--&gt;

By the middle of the 19th century, Ussher's chronology came under increasing attack from supporters of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], who argued that Ussher's "young Earth" was incompatible with the increasingly accepted view of an Earth much more ancient than Ussher's.  It became generally accepted that the Earth was tens, perhaps even hundreds of millions of years old. Ussher fell into disrepute among [[theology|theologian]]s as well; in 1890, Princeton professor [[William Henry Green]] wrote a highly influential article in ''[[Bibliotheca Sacra]]'' entitled "Primeval Chronology" in which he strongly criticised Ussher. He concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We conclude that the Scriptures furnish no data for a chronological computation prior to the life of Abraham; and that the Mosaic records do not fix and were not intended to fix the precise date either of the Flood or of the creation of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genevaninstitute.org/syllabus/unit-two-theology-proper/lesson-5-the-decree-of-creation/primeval-chronology-by-dr-william-henry-green/ Primeval Chronology]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The similarly conservative theologian [[B. B. Warfield]] reached the same conclusion in "On The Antiquity and Unity of the Human Race",&lt;ref&gt;''Princeton Theological Review'', 1911&lt;/ref&gt; commenting that "it is precarious in the highest degree to draw chronological inferences from genealogical tables".

Nevertheless, Professor [[James Barr (biblical scholar)|James Barr]] (then Oriel Professor of the interpretation of the Holy Scripture, Oxford University) wrote in 1984:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
…probably, so far as I know, there is no professor of Hebrew or Old Testament at any world-class university who does not believe that the writer(s) of Genesis 1–11 intended to convey to their readers the ideas that… the figures contained in the Genesis genealogies provided by simple addition a chronology from the beginning of the world up to later stages in the biblical story…&lt;ref&gt;James Barr, Oriel professor of the interpretation of the Holy Scripture, Oxford University, England, in a letter to David C. C. Watson, April 23, 1984. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Archbishop Ussher's chronology has in recent years been subject to artistic criticism, including in the play ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'' (based on the [[Scopes Monkey Trial]]) and the [[fantasy]] novel ''[[Good Omens]]'' which alleges that "he is off by a quarter of an hour". A different viewpoint comes from [[Stephen Jay Gould]], who, while totally disagreeing with Ussher's chronology, nevertheless wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_house-ussher.html | title = Fall in the House of Ussher | author = [[Stephen Jay Gould]] | journal = Natural History | volume = 100 |date = November 1991 | pages = 12–21 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120303202324/http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_house-ussher.html | archivedate = March 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I shall be defending Ussher's chronology as an honorable effort for its time and arguing that our usual ridicule only records a lamentable small-mindedness based on mistaken use of present criteria to judge a distant and different past
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ussher represented the best of scholarship in his time. He was part of a substantial research tradition, a large community of intellectuals working toward a common goal under an accepted methodology…
