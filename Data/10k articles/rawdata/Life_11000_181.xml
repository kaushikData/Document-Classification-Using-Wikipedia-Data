[[File:AntigoneArtwork.png|thumb|Advertising artwork for a contemporary production featuring Antigone sprinkling dirt (part of the burial ritual), while also "drawing a line in the sand" and defying the king's orders.]]
'''''Antigone''''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|n|ˈ|t|ɪ|ɡ|ə|n|i}} {{respell|ann|TIG|ə|nee}}; {{lang-grc|Ἀντιγόνη}}) is a [[Greek tragedy|tragedy]] by [[Sophocles]] written in or before 441 BC.

Of the [[three Theban plays]] ''Antigone'' is the third in order of the events depicted in the plays, but it is the first that was written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Sophocles | others = Translated by Robert Fagles | title = The Three Theban Plays: Antigone, Oedipus the King, Oedipus at Colonus | publisher = Penguin | year = 1986 | location = New York | page = 35 | url = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The play expands on the [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Theban]] legend that predates it, and it picks up where [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Seven Against Thebes]]'' ends.

==Synopsis==
Prior to the beginning of the play, brothers Eteocles and Polyneices, leading opposite sides in [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]]' civil war, died fighting each other for the throne. [[Creon]], the new ruler of Thebes and brother of the former Queen Jocasta, has decided that [[Eteocles]] will be honored and [[Polyneices]] will be in public shame. The rebel brother's body will not be sanctified by holy rites and will lie unburied on the battlefield, prey for carrion animals like worms and vultures, the harshest punishment at the time. [[Antigone]] and [[Ismene]] are the sisters of the dead Polyneices and Eteocles. In the opening of the play, Antigone brings Ismene outside the palace gates late at night for a secret meeting: Antigone wants to bury Polyneices' body, in defiance of Creon's edict. Ismene refuses to help her, not believing that it will actually be possible to bury their brother, who is under guard, but she is unable to stop Antigone from going to bury her brother herself.

[[File:Arbre généalogique Antigone.pdf|350px|right|thumb|left|Antigone's family tree]]
Creon enters, along with the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] of Theban elders. He seeks their support in the days to come and in particular, wants them to back his edict regarding the disposal of Polyneices' body. The leader of the chorus pledges his support out of deference to Creon. A sentry enters, fearfully reporting that the body has been given funeral rites and a symbolic burial with a thin covering of earth, though no one who actually committed the crime saw this. Creon, furious, orders the sentry to find the culprit or face death himself. The sentry leaves, and the chorus sings about honouring the gods, but after a short absence, he returns, bringing Antigone with him. The sentry explains that the watchmen uncovered Polyneices' body and then caught Antigone as she did the funeral rituals. Creon questions her after sending the sentry away, and she does not deny what she has done. She argues unflinchingly with Creon about the immorality of the edict and the morality of her actions. Creon becomes furious, and seeing Ismene upset, thinks she must have known of Antigone's plan. He summons her. Ismene tries to confess falsely to the crime, wishing to die alongside her sister, but Antigone will not have it. Creon orders that the two women be temporarily imprisoned.

[[Haemon]], Creon's son, enters to pledge allegiance to his father, even though he is engaged to Antigone. He initially seems willing to forsake Antigone, but when Haemon gently tries to persuade his father to spare Antigone, claiming that "under cover of darkness the city mourns for the girl", the discussion deteriorates, and the two men are soon bitterly insulting each other. When Creon threatens to execute Antigone in front of his son, Haemon leaves, vowing never to see Creon again.

Creon decides to spare Ismene and to bury Antigone alive in a cave. By not killing her directly, he hopes to pay the minimal respects to the gods. She is brought out of the house, and this time, she is sorrowful instead of defiant. She expresses her regrets at not having married and dying for following the laws of the gods. She is taken away to her living tomb, with the Leader of the Chorus expressing great sorrow for what is going to happen to her.

[[Tiresias]], the blind prophet, enters. Tiresias warns Creon that Polyneices should now be urgently buried because the gods are displeased, refusing to accept any sacrifices or prayers from Thebes. Creon accuses Tiresias of being corrupt. Tiresias responds that because of Creon's mistakes, he will lose "a son of [his] own loins"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Sophocles | others = Translated by E.F. Watling | title = Sophocles: The Theban Plays (Penguin Classics) | year = 1947 | publisher = The Penguin Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the crimes of leaving Polyneices unburied and putting Antigone into the earth (he does not say that Antigone should not be condemned to death, only that it is improper to keep a living body underneath the earth). All of Greece will despise Creon, and the sacrificial offerings of Thebes will not be accepted by the gods. The leader of the chorus, terrified, asks Creon to take Tiresias' advice to free Antigone and bury Polyneices. Creon assents, leaving with a retinue of men. The chorus delivers a choral ode to the god [[Dionysus]] (god of wine and of the theater; this part is the offering to their patron god). A messenger enters to tell the leader of the chorus that Antigone has killed herself. [[Eurydice of Thebes|Eurydice]], Creon's wife and Haemon's mother, enters and asks the messenger to tell her everything. The messenger reports that Creon saw to the burial of Polyneices. When Creon arrived at Antigone's cave, he found Haemon lamenting over Antigone, who had hanged herself. After unsuccessfully attempting to stab Creon, Haemon stabbed himself. Having listened to the messenger's account, Eurydice disappears into the palace.

Creon enters, carrying Haemon's body. He understands that his own actions have caused these events and blames himself. A second messenger arrives to tell Creon and the chorus that Eurydice has killed herself. With her last breath, she cursed her husband. Creon blames himself for everything that has happened, and, a broken man, he asks his servants to help him inside. The order he valued so much has been protected, and he is still the king, but he has acted against the gods and lost his children and his wife as a result. After Creon condemns himself, the leader of the chorus closes by saying that although the gods punish the proud, punishment brings wisdom.

===Characters===
* [[Antigone]], compared to her beautiful and docile sister, is portrayed as a heroine who recognizes her familial duty. Her dialogues with Ismene reveal her to be as stubborn as her uncle.&lt;ref name="McDonald"&gt;{{citation | url = http://olli.ucsd.edu/documents/antigone.pdf | format = PDF | last = McDonald | first = Marianne | title = Sophocles' ''Antigone'' | publisher = Nick Hern Books | year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her, the ideal of the female character is boldly outlined.&lt;ref name="Bates"&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.theatrehistory.com/ancient/bates017.html | editor-last = Bates | editor-first =  Alfred | title = The Drama: Its History, Literature and Influence on Civilization, Vol. 1 | location = London | publisher = Historical Publishing Company | year = 1906 | pages = 112–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; She defies Creon’s decree despite the consequences she may face, in order to honor her deceased brother.
* [[Ismene]] serves as a foil for Antigone, presenting the contrast in their respective responses to the royal decree.&lt;ref name="McDonald" /&gt; Considered the beautiful one, she is more lawful and obedient to authority. She hesitates to bury Polyneices because she fears Creon.
* [[Creon]] is the current King of Thebes, who views law as the guarantor of personal happiness. He can also be seen as a tragic hero, losing everything for upholding what he believed was right. Even when he is forced to amend his decree to please the gods, he first tends to the dead Polyneices before releasing Antigone.&lt;ref name="McDonald" /&gt;
* [[Eurydice of Thebes]] is the Queen of Thebes and Creon’s wife. She appears towards the end and only to hear confirmation of her son Haemon’s death. In her grief, she commits suicide, cursing Creon whom she blames for her son’s death.
* [[Haemon]] is the son of Creon and Eurydice, betrothed to Antigone. Proved to be more reasonable than Creon, he attempts to reason with his father for the sake of Antigone. However, when Creon refuses to listen to him, Haemon leaves angrily and shouts he will never see him again. He commits suicide after finding Antigone dead.
* Koryphaios is the assistant to the King (Creon) and the leader of the Chorus. He is often interpreted as a close advisor to the King, and therefore a close family friend. This role is highlighted in the end when Creon chooses to listen to Koryphaios' advice.
* [[Tiresias]] is the blind prophet whose prediction brings about the eventual proper burial of Polyneices. Portrayed as wise and full of reason, Tiresias attempts to warn Creon of his foolishness and tells him the gods are angry. He manages to convince Creon, but is too late to save the impetuous Antigone.
* [[Greek chorus|The Chorus]], a group of elderly Theban men, is at first deferential to the king.&lt;ref name="Bates" /&gt; Their purpose is to comment on the action in the play and add to the suspense and emotions, as well as connecting the story to myths. As the play progresses they counsel Creon to be more moderate. Their pleading persuades Creon to spare Ismene. They also advise Creon to take Tiresias's advice.

==Historical context==
''Antigone'' was written at a time of national fervor. In 441 BC, shortly after the play was performed, Sophocles was appointed as one of the ten generals to lead a military expedition against [[Samos]]. It is striking that a prominent play in a time of such imperialism contains little political propaganda, no impassioned [[Apostrophe (figure of speech)|apostrophe]], and, with the exception of the [[Epikleros|epiklerate]] (the right of the daughter to continue her dead father's lineage),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rosenfield | first = Kathrin H. | others = Translated by Charles B.

J. H. | title = The Life and Work of Sophocles | location = London | publisher = [[Sheed and Ward]] | year = 1953 | pages = 147–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than become sidetracked with the issues of the time, ''Antigone'' remains focused on the characters and themes within the play. It does, however, expose the dangers of the absolute ruler, or tyrant, in the person of Creon, a king to whom few will speak freely and openly their true opinions, and who therefore makes the grievous error of condemning Antigone, an act which he pitifully regrets in the play's final lines. Athenians, proud of their democratic tradition, would have identified his error in the many lines of dialogue which emphasize that the people of Thebes believe he is wrong, but have no voice to tell him so. Athenians would identify the folly of tyranny.

==Notable features==
The Chorus in ''Antigone'' departs significantly from the chorus in Aeschylus' ''Seven Against Thebes'', the play of which ''Antigone'' is a continuation. The chorus in ''Seven Against Thebes'' is largely supportive of Antigone's decision to bury her brother. Here, the chorus is composed of old men who are largely unwilling to see civil disobedience in a positive light. The chorus also represents a typical difference in Sophocles' plays from those of both Aeschylus and Euripides. A chorus of Aeschylus' almost always continues or intensifies the moral nature of the play, while one of Euripides' frequently strays far from the main moral theme. The chorus in ''Antigone'' lies somewhere in between; it remains within the general moral and the immediate scene, but allows itself to be carried away from the occasion or the initial reason for speaking.{{sfn|Letters|p=156}}

==Significance and interpretation==
In this play Sophocles raises a number of questions: Should Polyneices, who committed a serious crime that threatened the city, be given burial rituals, or should his body be left unburied as prey for scavenging animals? Should someone who attempts to bury him in defiance of Creon be punished in an especially cruel and horrible way? Are Creon’s actions justified? Are Antigone’s actions justified? In this play, Creon is not presented as a monster, but as a leader who is doing what he considers right and justified by the state. The chorus is presented as a group of citizens who, though they may feel uneasy about the treatment of the corpse, respect Creon and what he is doing. The chorus is sympathetic to Antigone only when she is led off to her death. But when the chorus learns that the Gods are offended by what Creon has done, and that Creon’s actions will result in the destruction of their city, then they ask Creon to change course. The city is of primary importance to the chorus.&lt;ref&gt;Sophocles. Fagles, Robert, trans. ''Sophocles: The Three Theban Plays.'' Knox, Bernard. “Introduction”.

Most of the arguments to save her center on a debate over which course adheres best to strict justice.{{sfn|Letters|p=147}}

Both Antigone and Creon claim divine sanction for their actions; but [[Tiresias]] the prophet supports Antigone's claim that the gods demand Polyneices' burial. It is not until the interview with Tiresias that Creon transgresses and is guilty of sin. He had no divine intimation that his edict would be displeasing to the Gods and against their will. He is here warned that it is, but he defends it and insults the prophet of the Gods. This is his sin, and it is this which leads to his punishment. The terrible calamities that overtake Creon are not the result of his exalting the law of the state over the unwritten and divine law which Antigone vindicates, but are his intemperance which led him to disregard the warnings of Tiresias until it was too late. This is emphasized by the Chorus in the lines that conclude the play.&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt;

The German poet Friedrich Hölderlin, whose translation had a strong impact on the philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]], brings out a more subtle reading of the play: he focuses on Antigone's legal and political status within the palace, her privilege to be the hearth (according to the legal instrument of the [[epikleros|epiklerate]]) and thus protected by Zeus. According to the legal practice of classical Athens, Creon is obliged to marry his closest relative (Haemon) to the late king's daughter in an inverted marriage rite, which would oblige Haemon to produce a son and heir for his dead father in law. Creon would be deprived of grandchildren and heirs to his lineage – a fact which provides a strong realistic motive for his hatred against Antigone. This modern perspective has remained submerged for a long time.{{sfn|Rosenfield|p=99–121}}

Martin Heidegger, in his essay, ''The Ode on Man in Sophocles’ Antigone'', focusses on the chorus’ sequence of stophe and antistrophe that begins on line 278. His interpretation is in three phases: first to consider the essential meaning of the verse, and then to move through the sequence with that understanding, and finally to discern what was nature of humankind that Sophocles was expressing in this poem. In the first two lines of the first strophe, in the translation Heidegger used, the chorus says that there are many strange things on earth, but there is nothing stranger than man. Beginnings are important to Heidegger, and he considered those two lines to describe primary trait of the essence of humanity within which all other aspects must find their essence. Those two lines are so fundamental that the rest of the verse is spent catching up with them. The authentic Greek definition of humankind is the one who is strangest of all. Heidegger’s interpretation of the text describes humankind in one word that captures the extremes — ''deinotaton''. Man is ''deinon'' in the sense that he is the terrible, violent one, and also in the sense that he uses violence against the overpowering. Man is twice ''deinon''. In a series of lectures in 1942, ''Hölderlin’s Hymn, The Ister'', Heidegger goes further in interpreting this play, and considers that Antigone takes on the destiny she has been given, but does not follow a path that is opposed to that of the humankind described in the choral ode. When Antigone opposes Creon, her suffering the uncanny, is her supreme action.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, James F. ''Heidegger’s Political Thinking''.

===The problem of the second burial===
An important issue still debated regarding Sophocles' ''Antigone'' is the problem of the second burial. When she poured dust over her brother's body, Antigone completed the burial rituals and thus fulfilled her duty to him. Having been properly buried, Polyneices' soul could proceed to the underworld whether or not the dust was removed from his body. However, Antigone went back after his body was uncovered and performed the ritual again, an act that seems to be completely unmotivated by anything other than a plot necessity so that she could be caught in the act of disobedience, leaving no doubt of her guilt. More than one commentator has suggested that it was the gods, not Antigone, who performed the first burial, citing both the guard's description of the scene and the chorus's observation.&lt;ref name=Ferguson&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LSsGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT173 | last = Ferguson | first = John | title = A Companion to Greek Tragedy | page = 173 | publisher = University of Texas Press | year = 2013 | isbn = 9780292759701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Jebb suggests that the only reason for Antigone's return to the burial site is that the first time she forgot the Choaí ([[libation]]s), and "perhaps the rite was considered completed only if the Choaí were poured while the dust still covered the corpse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Sophocles: The Plays and Fragments, with critical notes, commentary, and translation in English prose. Part III: The Antigone | first = Sir Richard C. | last = Jebb | location = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1900 | chapter = Verse 429 | chapter-url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0023%3Atext%3Dcomm%3Acommline%3D429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert Norwood explains Antigone's performance of the second burial in terms of her stubbornness. His argument says that had Antigone not been so obsessed with the idea of keeping her brother covered, none of the deaths of the play would have happened. This argument states that if nothing had happened, nothing would have happened, and doesn't take much of a stand in explaining why Antigone returned for the second burial when the first would have fulfilled her religious obligation, regardless of how stubborn she was. This leaves that she acted only in passionate defiance of Creon and respect to her brother's earthly vessel.&lt;ref name=Rose&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rose | first = J. L. | title = The Problem of the Second Burial in Sophocles' Antigone | journal = The Classical Journal | volume = 47 | number = 6 | date = March 1952 | page = 220–221 | jstor = 3293220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tycho von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff justifies the need for the second burial by comparing Sophocles' ''Antigone'' to a theoretical version where Antigone is apprehended during the first burial. In this situation, news of the illegal burial and Antigone's arrest would arrive at the same time and there would be no period of time in which Antigone's defiance and victory could be appreciated.

J. L. Rose maintains that the solution to the problem of the second burial is solved by close examination of Antigone as a tragic character. Being a tragic character, she is completely obsessed by one idea, and for her this is giving her brother his due respect in death and demonstrating her love for him and for what is right. When she sees her brother's body uncovered, therefore, she is overcome by emotion and acts impulsively to cover him again, with no regards to the necessity of the action or its consequences for her safety.&lt;ref name=Rose /&gt;

Bonnie Honig uses the problem of the second burial as the basis for her claim that Ismene performs the first burial, and that her pseudo-confession before Creon is actually an honest admission of guilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Honig | first = Bonnie | title = ISMENE’S FORCED CHOICE: SACRIFICE AND SORORITY IN SOPHOCLES’ ''ANTIGONE'' | journal = Arethusa | volume = 44 | year = 2011 | pages = 29–68 | publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press | url = http://politicalscience.nd.edu/assets/47009/44.1.honig.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==

===Civil disobedience===
A well established theme in Antigone is the right of the individual to reject society's infringement on her freedom to perform a personal obligation.&lt;ref name="levy"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Levy | first = Charles S. | authorlink = | title = Antigone's Motives: A Suggested Interpretation | journal = [[Transactions of the American Philological Association]] | volume = 94 | issue = | pages = 137–44 | publisher = | location = | year = 1963 | doi = 10.2307/283641| id = | jstor = 283641}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antigone comments to Ismene, regarding Creon's edict, that "He has no right to keep me from my own."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Sophocles | title = Sophocles: Oedipus the King, Oedipus at Colonus, Antigone | others = Translated by David Grene | page = Line 48 | publisher = University of Chicago Publishers | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-226-30792-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related to this theme is the question of whether Antigone's will to bury her brother is based on rational thought or instinct, a debate whose contributors include Goethe.&lt;ref name="levy"/&gt;

The contrasting views of Creon and Antigone with regard to laws higher than those of state inform their different conclusions about civil disobedience. Creon demands obedience to the law above all else, right or wrong. He says that "there is nothing worse than disobedience to authority" (''An.'' 671). Antigone responds with the idea that state law is not absolute, and that it can be broken in civil disobedience in extreme cases, such as honoring the gods, whose rule and authority outweigh Creon's.

===Natural law and contemporary legal institutions===
In ''Antigone'', Sophocles asks the question, which law is greater: the gods' or man's. Sophocles votes for the law of the gods. He does this in order to save Athens from the moral destruction which seems imminent. Sophocles wants to warn his countrymen about hubris, or arrogance, because he believes this will be their downfall. In Antigone, the hubris of Creon is revealed.

Creon's decree to leave Polyneices unburied in itself makes a bold statement about what it means to be a citizen, and what constitutes abdication of citizenship. It was the firmly kept custom of the Greeks that each city was responsible for the burial of its citizens. Herodotus discussed how members of each city would collect their own dead after a large battle to bury them.&lt;ref name=MacKay&gt;{{cite journal | last = MacKay | first = L. | title = Antigone, Coriolanus, and Hegel | journal = Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association | volume = 93 | year = 1962 | pages = 178–179 | jstor = 283759}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Antigone'', it is therefore natural that the people of Thebes did not bury the Argives, but very striking that Creon prohibited the burial of Polyneices. Since he is a citizen of Thebes, it would have been natural for the Thebans to bury him. Creon is telling his people that Polyneices has distanced himself from them, and that they are prohibited from treating him as a fellow-citizen and burying him as is the custom for citizens.

In prohibiting the people of Thebes from burying Polyneices, Creon is essentially placing him on the level of the other attackers—the foreign Argives. For Creon, the fact that Polyneices has attacked the city effectively revokes his citizenship and makes him a foreigner. As defined by this decree, citizenship is based on loyalty. It is revoked when Polyneices commits what in Creon's eyes amounts to treason. When pitted against Antigone's view, this understanding of citizenship creates a new axis of conflict. Antigone does not deny that Polyneices has betrayed the state, she simply acts as if this betrayal does not rob him of the connection that he would have otherwise had with the city. Creon, on the other hand, believes that citizenship is a contract; it is not absolute or inalienable, and can be lost in certain circumstances. These two opposing views – that citizenship is absolute and undeniable and alternatively that citizenship is based on certain behavior – are known respectively as citizenship 'by nature' and citizenship 'by law.'&lt;ref name=MacKay /&gt;

===Fidelity===
Antigone's determination to bury Polyneices arises from a desire to bring honor to her family, and to honor the higher law of the gods. She repeatedly declares that she must act to please "those that are dead" (''An.'' 77), because they hold more weight than any ruler, that is the weight of divine law. In the opening scene, she makes an emotional appeal to her sister Ismene saying that they must protect their brother out of sisterly love, even if he did betray their state. Antigone believes that there are rights that are inalienable because they come from the highest authority, or authority itself, that is the divine law.

While he rejects Antigone's actions based on family honor, Creon appears to value family himself. When talking to Haemon, Creon demands of him not only obedience as a citizen, but also as a son. Creon says "everything else shall be second to your father's decision" ("An." 640–641). His emphasis on being Haemon's father rather than his king may seem odd, especially in light of the fact that Creon elsewhere advocates obedience to the state above all else. It is not clear how he would personally handle these two values in conflict, but it is a moot point in the play, for, as absolute ruler of Thebes, Creon is the state, and the state is Creon. It is clear how he feels about these two values in conflict when encountered in another person, Antigone: loyalty to the state comes before family fealty, and he sentences her to death.

===Portrayal of the gods===
In ''Antigone'' as well as the other Theban Plays, there are very few references to the gods. Hades is the god who is most commonly referred to, but he is referred to more as a personification of [[Thanatos|Death]]. Zeus is referenced a total of 13 times by name in the entire play, and Apollo is referenced only as a personification of prophecy. This lack of mention portrays the tragic events that occur as the result of human error, and not divine intervention. The gods are portrayed as [[chthonic]], as near the beginning there is a reference to "Justice who dwells with the gods beneath the earth." Sophocles references Olympus twice in ''Antigone.'' This contrasts with the other Athenian tragedians, who reference Olympus often.

===Love for family===
Antigone's love for family is shown when she buries her brother, Polyneices. Haemon was deeply in love with his cousin and fiancée Antigone, and he killed himself in grief when he found out that his beloved Antigone had hanged herself.

==Modern adaptations==

===Drama===
* [[Felix Mendelssohn]] composed [[Antigone (Mendelssohn)|a suite of incidental music]] for [[Ludwig Tieck]]'s staging of the play in 1841. It includes an overture and seven choruses.
* [[Walter Hasenclever]] wrote an adaptation in 1917, inspired by the events of [[World War I]].
* French playwright [[Jean Anouilh]]'s tragedy ''[[Antigone (Anouilh play)|Antigone]]'' was inspired by both Sophocles' play and the myth itself. Anouilh's play premièred in Paris at the [[Théâtre de l'Atelier]] in February 1944, during the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Nazi occupation of France]]. 
* Right after [[World War II]], [[Bertolt Brecht]] composed an adaptation, ''[[Antigone (Brecht play)|Antigone]]'', which was based on a translation by [[Friedrich Hölderlin]] and was published under the title ''Antigonemodell 1948''.
* The Haitian writer and playwright [[Félix Morisseau-Leroy]] translated and adapted ''Antigone'' into Haitian Creole under the title, ''Antigòn'' (1953). ''Antigòn'' is noteworthy in its attempts to insert the lived religious experience of many Haitians into the content of the play through the introduction of several [[Loa]] from the pantheon of [[Haitian Vodou]] as voiced entities throughout the performance.
* ''Antigone'' inspired the 1967 Spanish-language novel ''La tumba de Antígona'' (English title: ''Antigone's Tomb'') by [[María Zambrano]].
* Puerto Rican playwright [[Luis Rafael Sánchez]]'s 1968 play ''La Pasión según Antígona Pérez'' sets Sophocles' play in a contemporary world where Creon is the dictator of a fictional Latin American nation, and Antígona and her 'brothers' are dissident freedom fighters.
* In 1977, ''Antigone'' was translated into [[Papiamento]] for an [[Aruba]]n production by director Burny Every together with Pedro Velásquez and Ramon Todd Dandaré. This translation retains the original iambic verse by Sophocles.
* In 2004, theatre companies Crossing Jamaica Avenue and The Women's Project in New York City co-produced the ''Antigone Project'' written by [[Tanya Barfield]], Karen Hartman, Chiori Miyagawa, Pulitzer Prize winner [[Lynn Nottage]] and [[Caridad Svich]], a five-part response to Sophocles' text and to the US Patriot Act. The text was published by NoPassport Press as a single edition in 2009 with introductions by classics scholar [[Marianne McDonald]] and playwright Lisa Schlesinger.
* There are four operas: ''Antigone (''1977) by [[Dinos Constantinides]], on an English libretto by Fitts and Fitzgerald, ''Antigone (''1986) by [[Marjorie S.

&lt;!-- Definition &amp; symptoms and mechanism--&gt;
'''Antimicrobial resistance''' ('''AMR''' or '''AR''') is the ability of a microbe to resist the effects of medication that once could successfully treat the microbe.&lt;ref name=ARM&gt;{{cite web|title=Review on Antimicrobial Resistance|url=http://amr-review.org/|website=amr-review.org|access-date=20 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925061349/http://amr-review.org/|archive-date=25 September 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Antimicrobial resistance Fact sheet N°194|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs194/en/|website=who.int|access-date=7 March 2015|date=April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310081111/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs194/en/|archive-date=10 March 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/about.html|title=About Antimicrobial Resistance - Antibiotic/Antimicrobial Resistance - CDC|date=19 September 2017|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=8 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171001044758/https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/about.html|archive-date=1 October 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''antibiotic resistance''' ('''AR''' or '''ABR''') is a subset of AMR, as it applies only to [[bacteria]] becoming resistant to [[antibiotic]]s.&lt;ref name="WHO2014"/&gt; Resistant microbes are more difficult to treat, requiring alternative medications or higher doses of antimicrobials. These approaches may be more expensive, [[adverse effect|more toxic]] or both. Microbes resistant to multiple antimicrobials are called [[multiple drug resistance|multidrug resistant]] (MDR). Those considered extensively drug resistant (XDR) or totally drug resistant (TDR) are sometimes called "superbugs".&lt;ref name="cdcgetsmart"&gt;{{cite web|title=Antibiotic Resistance Questions &amp; Answers|url=https://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/antibiotic-use/antibiotic-resistance-faqs.html#e|work=Get Smart: Know When Antibiotics Work|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA|access-date=20 March 2013|date=30 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329183317/http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/antibiotic-use/antibiotic-resistance-faqs.html#e|archive-date=29 March 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resistance arises through one of three mechanisms: natural resistance in certain types of bacteria, genetic [[mutation]], or by one species acquiring resistance from another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tufts.edu/med/apua/about_issue/about_antibioticres.shtml|title=General Background: About Antibiotic Resistance|website=www.tufts.edu|access-date=2015-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023035356/http://www.tufts.edu/med/apua/about_issue/about_antibioticres.shtml|archive-date=23 October 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; All classes of microbes can develop resistance. Fungi develop [[antifungal]] resistance. [[Virus]]es develop [[antiviral]] resistance. [[Protozoa]] develop [[antiprotozoal]] resistance, and [[bacteria]] develop [[antibiotic]] resistance. Resistance can appear spontaneously because of random mutations. However, extended use of antimicrobials appears to encourage selection for mutations which can render antimicrobials ineffective.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention --&gt;
Preventive measures include only using antibiotics when needed, thereby stopping [[antibiotic misuse|misuse of antibiotics or antimicrobials]].&lt;ref name="About Antimicrobial Resistance"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/about.html|title=About Antimicrobial Resistance|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2015-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171001044758/https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/about.html|archive-date=1 October 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all|date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swedish"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Swedish work on containment of antibiotic resistance – Tools, methods and experiences|publisher = Public Health Agency of Sweden|year = 2014|isbn = 978-91-7603-011-0|url = http://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/pagefiles/17351/Swedish-work-on-containment-of-antibiotic-resistance.pdf|location = Stockholm|pages = 16–17, 121–128|access-date = 23 July 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150723081110/http://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/pagefiles/17351/Swedish-work-on-containment-of-antibiotic-resistance.pdf|archive-date = 23 July 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Narrow-spectrum antibiotics are preferred over broad-spectrum antibiotics when possible, as effectively and accurately targeting specific organisms is less likely to cause resistance.&lt;ref name="NPS2013"&gt;{{cite web|title = Duration of antibiotic therapy and resistance|url = http://www.nps.org.au/publications/health-professional/health-news-evidence/2013/duration-of-antibiotic-therapy|website = NPS Medicinewise|publisher = National Prescribing Service Limited trading, Australia|access-date = 22 July 2015|date = 13 June 2013|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150723074759/http://www.nps.org.au/publications/health-professional/health-news-evidence/2013/duration-of-antibiotic-therapy|archive-date = 23 July 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For people who take these medications at home, education about proper use is essential.

&lt;!-- Treatment and Epidemiology --&gt;
Rising drug resistance is caused mainly by use of antimicrobials in humans and other animals, and spread of resistant strains between the two.&lt;ref name="About Antimicrobial Resistance"/&gt; Growing resistance has also been linked to dumping of inadequately treated effluents from the pharmaceutical industry, especially in countries where bulk drugs are manufactured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Changing Markets|title=IMPACTS OF PHARMACEUTICAL POLLUTION ON COMMUNITIES AND ENVIRONMENT IN INDIA|url=https://www.nordea.com/Images/35-107206/impacts%201-20.pdf|website=Nordea|publisher=Nordea|accessdate=1 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170520031434/https://www.nordea.com/Images/35-107206/impacts%201-20.pdf|archive-date=20 May 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antibiotics increase [[selective pressure]] in bacterial populations, causing vulnerable bacteria to die; this increases the percentage of resistant bacteria which continue growing.

The WHO defines antimicrobial resistance as a microorganism's resistance to an antimicrobial drug that was once able to treat an infection by that microorganism.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;
A person cannot become resistant to antibiotics. Resistance is a property of the microbe, not a person or other organism infected by a microbe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/antibiotic-use/antibiotic-resistance-faqs.html#antibiotic-resistance-concerns|title=CDC: Get Smart: Know When Antibiotics Work|publisher=Cdc.gov|access-date=2013-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429180658/http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/antibiotic-use/antibiotic-resistance-faqs.html#antibiotic-resistance-concerns|archive-date=29 April 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all|date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
A [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) report released April 2014 stated, "this serious threat is no longer a prediction for the future, it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone, of any age, in any country. Antibiotic resistance—when bacteria change so antibiotics no longer work in people who need them to treat infections—is now a major threat to public health."&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/amr-report/en/ "WHO's first global report on antibiotic resistance reveals serious, worldwide threat to public health"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502044726/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/amr-report/en/ |date=2 May 2014 }} Retrieved 2014-05-02&lt;/ref&gt;

Penicillinase may have emerged as a defense mechanism for bacteria in their [[habitat]]s, such as the case of penicillinase-rich ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', living with penicillin-producing ''[[Trichophyton]]''; however, this may be circumstantial.&lt;ref name="penicillinase" /&gt; Search for a penicillinase ancestor has focused on the class of [[protein]]s that must be ''a priori'' capable of specific combination with [[penicillin]].&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; The resistance to cefoxitin and clindamycin in turn was attributed to Braine's and Hartnell's contact with microorganisms that naturally produce them or [[random mutation]] in the [[chromosome]]s of ''Clostridium'' strains.&lt;ref name="NS" /&gt;

There is evidence that [[heavy metals]] and other pollutants may select for antibiotic-resistant bacteria, generating a constant source of them in small numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seiler C, Berendonk TU | title = Heavy metal driven co-selection of antibiotic resistance in soil and water bodies impacted by agriculture and aquaculture | journal = Frontiers in Microbiology | volume = 3 | pages = 399 | date = December 14, 2012 | pmid = 23248620 | pmc = 3522115 | doi = 10.3389/fmicb.2012.00399 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water pollution===
Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem among humans and wildlife in terrestrial or aquatic environments. In this respect, the spread and contamination of the environment, especially through [[water pollution]] "hot spots" such as hospital [[wastewater]] and untreated urban wastewater, is a growing and serious public health problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Levy SB | title = The 2000 Garrod lecture.

L. 2012 pp. 151- 171"&gt;Martinez, J. L., &amp; Olivares, J. (2012). 
Environmental Pollution By Antibiotic Resistance Genes. In P. L. Keen, &amp; M. H. Montforts, Antimicrobial Resistance in the Environment (pp. 151- 171). Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; The contribution of the pharmaceutical industry is so significant that parallels can be drawn between countries with highest rate of increasing antibiotic resistance and countries with largest footprint of pharmaceutical industry. China, which contributes to nearly 90 per cent of the world's active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturing, has seen a 22 per cent increase in rate of antimicrobial resistance in six years, compared to a 6 per cent increase in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yezli S, Li H | title = Antibiotic resistance amongst healthcare-associated pathogens in China | journal = International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents | volume = 40 | issue = 5 | pages = 389–97 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 22999767 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2012.07.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with antibiotic waste, resistant bacteria follow, thus introducing antibiotic-resistant bacteria into the environment. Already in 2011, mapping of sewage and water supply samples in [[New Delhi]] showed widespread and uncontrolled infection as indicated by the presence of NDM-1-positive enteric bacteria ([[New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1]]).&lt;ref name="Walsh_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Walsh TR, Weeks J, Livermore DM, Toleman MA | title = Dissemination of NDM-1 positive bacteria in the New Delhi environment and its implications for human health: an environmental point prevalence study | journal = The Lancet.

As bacteria replicate quickly, the resistant bacteria that enter water bodies through wastewater replicate their resistance genes as they continue to divide. In addition, bacteria carrying resistance genes have the ability to spread those genes to other species via horizontal gene transfer. Therefore, even if the specific antibiotic is no longer introduced into the environment, antibiotic-resistance genes will persist through the bacteria that have since replicated without continuous exposure.&lt;ref name="Martinez, J. L. 2012 pp. 151- 171" /&gt; Antibiotic resistance is widespread in marine vertebrates, and they may be important reservoirs of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the [[Marine ecosystem|marine environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rose JM, Gast RJ, Bogomolni A, Ellis JC, Lentell BJ, Touhey K, Moore M | title = Occurrence and patterns of antibiotic resistance in vertebrates off the Northeastern United States coast | journal = FEMS Microbiology Ecology | volume = 67 | issue = 3 | pages = 421–31 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19187217 | pmc = 5444207 | doi = 10.1111/j.1574-6941.2009.00648.x | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
[[File:Antibioticresistance diagram.png|thumb|350px|Mission Critical: Preventing Antibiotic Resistance (CDC report, 2014)|alt=Infographic from CDC report on preventing antibiotic resistance]]

There have been increasing public calls for global collective action to address the threat, including a proposal for international treaty on antimicrobial resistance. Further detail and attention is still needed in order to recognize and measure trends in resistance on the international level; the idea of a global tracking system has been suggested but implementation has yet to occur. A system of this nature would provide insight to areas of high resistance as well as information necessary for evaluation of programs and other changes made to fight or reverse antibiotic resistance.

===Duration of antibiotics===
Antibiotic treatment duration should be based on the infection and other health problems a person may have.&lt;ref name=NPS2013/&gt;&lt;!-- "When optimising therapy for an infection consider the person’s immune status, the infecting agent and the focus of infection." --&gt; For many infections once a person has improved there is little evidence that stopping treatment causes more resistance.&lt;ref name=NPS2013/&gt;&lt;!--  "There does not appear to be strong evidence to support the notion that stopping antibiotics before the end of the recommended treatment contributes to increasing resistance" --&gt; Some therefore feel that stopping early may be reasonable in some cases.&lt;ref name=NPS2013/&gt;&lt;!--  "Therefore, in selected cases, it may be appropriate to stop antibiotic therapy early." --&gt; Other infections, however, do require long courses regardless of whether a person feels better.&lt;ref name=NPS2013/&gt;&lt;!-- "For some infections, such as Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia, enterococcal endocarditis or tuberculosis, clear evidence favours prolonged treatment to prevent relapse" --&gt;

===Monitoring and mapping===
There are multiple national and international monitoring programs for drug-resistant threats, including [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA), [[Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|vancomycin-resistant ''S. aureus'']] (VRSA), [[Beta-lactamase|extended spectrum beta-lactamase]] (ESBL), [[Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus|vancomycin-resistant ''Enterococcus'']] (VRE), [[Acinetobacter baumannii|multidrug-resistant ''A. baumannii'']] (MRAB).&lt;ref name="CDC2013"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/biggest_threats.html|title=Biggest Threats - Antibiotic/Antimicrobial Resistance - CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-05-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912115220/https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/biggest_threats.html|archive-date=12 September 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all|date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Limiting antibiotic use ===
{{Further|Antibiotic misuse}}
[[Antibiotic stewardship programme]]s appear useful in reducing rates of antibiotic resistance.&lt;ref name="pmid28629876"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baur D, Gladstone BP, Burkert F, Carrara E, Foschi F, Döbele S, Tacconelli E | title = Effect of antibiotic stewardship on the incidence of infection and colonisation with antibiotic-resistant bacteria and Clostridium difficile infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = The Lancet.

Excessive antibiotic use has become one of the top contributors to the development of antibiotic resistance. Since the beginning of the antibiotic era, antibiotics have been used to treat a wide range of disease.&lt;ref name=Andersson2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Andersson DI, Hughes D | title = Persistence of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations | journal = FEMS Microbiology Reviews | volume = 35 | issue = 5 | pages = 901–11 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21707669 | doi = 10.1111/j.1574-6976.2011.00289.x | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overuse of antibiotics has become the primary cause of rising levels of antibiotic resistance. The main problem is that doctors are willing to prescribe antibiotics to ill-informed individuals who believe that antibiotics can cure nearly all illnesses, including viral infections like the common cold. In an analysis of drug prescriptions, 36% of individuals with a cold or an upper respiratory infection (both viral in origin) were given prescriptions for antibiotics.&lt;ref name=Gilberg2003&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilberg K, Laouri M, Wade S, Isonaka S | title = Analysis of medication use patterns:apparent overuse of antibiotics and underuse of prescription drugs for asthma, depression, and CHF | journal = Journal of Managed Care Pharmacy | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 232–7 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14613466 | doi = 10.18553/jmcp.2003.9.3.232 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These prescriptions accomplished nothing other than increasing the risk of further evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria.

==== At the hospital level ====
[[Antimicrobial stewardship]] teams in hospitals are encouraging optimal use of antimicrobials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Doron S, Davidson LE | title = Antimicrobial stewardship | journal = Mayo Clinic Proceedings | volume = 86 | issue = 11 | pages = 1113–23 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 22033257 | pmc = 3203003 | doi = 10.4065/mcp.2011.0358 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of antimicrobial stewardship are to help practitioners pick the right drug at the right dose and duration of therapy while preventing misuse and minimizing the development of resistance. Stewardship may reduce the length of stay by an average of slightly over 1 day while  not increasing the risk of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Davey P, Marwick CA, Scott CL, Charani E, McNeil K, Brown E, Gould IM, Ramsay CR, Michie S | title = Interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing practices for hospital inpatients | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2 | pages = CD003543 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28178770 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.cd003543.pub4 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== At the level of GP ====
Given the volume of care provided in primary care (General Practice), recent strategies have focused on reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescribing in this setting. Simple interventions, such as written information explaining the futility of antibiotics for common infections such as upper respiratory tract infections, have been shown to reduce antibiotic prescribing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Sullivan JW, Harvey RT, Glasziou PP, McCullough A | title = Written information for patients (or parents of child patients) to reduce the use of antibiotics for acute upper respiratory tract infections in primary care | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 11 | pages = CD011360 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27886368 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD011360.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prescriber should closely adhere to the five rights of drug administration: the right patient, the right drug, the right dose, the right route, and the right time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ihi.org/resources/pages/improvementstories/fiverightsofmedicationadministration.aspx|title=The Five Rights of Medication Administration|website=www.ihi.org|access-date=2015-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024101457/http://www.ihi.org/resources/pages/improvementstories/fiverightsofmedicationadministration.aspx|archive-date=24 October 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About a third of antibiotic prescriptions written in [[Patient#Outpatients and inpatients|outpatient settings]] in the United States were not appropriate in 2010 and 2011. Doctors in the U.S. wrote 506 annual antibiotic scripts for every 1,000 people, with 353 being medically necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fleming-Dutra KE, Hersh AL, Shapiro DJ, Bartoces M, Enns EA, File TM, Finkelstein JA, Gerber JS, Hyun DY, Linder JA, Lynfield R, Margolis DJ, May LS, Merenstein D, Metlay JP, Newland JG, Piccirillo JF, Roberts RM, Sanchez GV, Suda KJ, Thomas A, Woo TM, Zetts RM, Hicks LA | title = Prevalence of Inappropriate Antibiotic Prescriptions Among US Ambulatory Care Visits, 2010-2011 | journal = JAMA | volume = 315 | issue = 17 | pages = 1864–73 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27139059 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2016.4151 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health workers and pharmacists can help tackle resistance by: enhancing infection prevention and control; only prescribing and dispensing antibiotics when they are truly needed; prescribing and dispensing the right antibiotic(s) to treat the illness.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;

==== At the individual level ====
People can help tackle resistance by using antibiotics only when prescribed by a doctor; completing the full prescription, even if they feel better; never sharing antibiotics with others or using leftover prescriptions.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;

====Country examples====

=== Water, sanitation, hygiene ===
Infectious disease control through improved [[WASH|water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)]] infrastructure needs to be included in the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) agenda. The "Interagency Coordination Group on Antimicrobial Resistance" stated in 2018 that "the spread of pathogens through unsafe water results in a high burden of gastrointestinal disease, increasing even further the need for antibiotic treatment."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;IACG (2018) [http://www.who.int/antimicrobial-resistance/interagency-coordination-group/IACG_Optimize_use_of_antimicrobials_120718.pdf?ua=1 Reduce unintentional exposure and the need for antimicrobials, and optimize their use IACG Discussion Paper], Interagency Coordination Group on Antimicrobial Resistance, [http://www.who.int/antimicrobial-resistance/interagency-coordination-group/public-consultation-discussion-papers/en/ public consultation process] at WHO, Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly a problem in [[developing countries]] where the spread of infectious diseases caused by inadequate WASH standards is a major driver of antibiotic demand.&lt;ref name="Araya" /&gt; Growing usage of antibiotics together with persistent infectious disease levels have led to a dangerous cycle in which reliance on antimicrobials increases while the efficacy of drugs diminishes.&lt;ref name="Araya" /&gt; The proper use of infrastructure for water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) can result in a 47–72 percent decrease of diarrhea cases treated with antibiotics depending on the type of intervention and its effectiveness.&lt;ref name="Araya" /&gt; A reduction of the diarrhea disease burden through improved infrastructure would result in large decreases in the number of diarrhea cases treated with antibiotics. This was estimated as ranging from 5 million in Brazil to up to 590 million in India by the year 2030.&lt;ref name="Araya" /&gt; The strong link between increased consumption and resistance indicates that this will directly mitigate the accelerating spread of AMR.&lt;ref name="Araya" /&gt; Sanitation and water for all by 2030 is [[Sustainable Development Goal 6|Goal Number 6]] of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]].

Water supply and sanitation infrastructure in health facilities offer significant co-benefits for combatting AMR, and investment should be increased.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There is much room for improvement: WHO and UNICEF estimated in 2015 that globally 38% of health facilities did not have a source of water, nearly 19% had no toilets and 35% had no water and soap or alcohol-based hand rub for handwashing.&lt;ref&gt;WHO, UNICEF (2015).

In 1997, European Union health ministers voted to ban [[avoparcin]] and four additional antibiotics used to promote animal growth in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Casewell M, Friis C, Marco E, McMullin P, Phillips I | title = The European ban on growth-promoting antibiotics and emerging consequences for human and animal health | journal = The Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy | volume = 52 | issue = 2 | pages = 159–61 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12837737 | doi = 10.1093/jac/dkg313 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 a ban on the use of antibiotics in European feed, with the exception of two antibiotics in poultry feeds, became effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Castanon JI | title = History of the use of antibiotic as growth promoters in European poultry feeds | journal = Poultry Science | volume = 86 | issue = 11 | pages = 2466–71 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17954599 | doi = 10.3382/ps.2007-00249 | ref = harv }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scandinavia, there is evidence that the ban has led to a lower [[prevalence]] of antibiotic resistance in (nonhazardous) animal bacterial populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bengtsson B, Wierup M | title = Antimicrobial resistance in Scandinavia after ban of antimicrobial growth promoters | journal = Animal Biotechnology | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 147–56 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17127526 | doi = 10.1080/10495390600956920 | ref = harv }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2004, several European countries established a decline of antimicrobial resistance in humans through limiting the usage antimicrobials in agriculture and food industries without jeopardizing animal health or economic cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Angulo FJ, Baker NL, Olsen SJ, Anderson A, Barrett TJ | title = Antimicrobial use in agriculture: controlling the transfer of antimicrobial resistance to humans | journal = Seminars in Pediatric Infectious Diseases | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 78–85 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15185190 | doi = 10.1053/j.spid.2004.01.010 | url = https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1045187004000111 | access-date = 4 March 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180602155635/https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1045187004000111 | archive-date = 2 June 2018 | dead-url = no | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) collect data on antibiotic use in humans and in a more limited fashion in animals.&lt;ref name="gao"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/330/323097.html|title=GAO-11-801, Antibiotic Resistance: Agencies Have Made Limited Progress Addressing Antibiotic Use in Animals|publisher=gao.gov|access-date=2014-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105120254/http://www.gao.gov/assets/330/323097.html|archive-date=5 November 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The FDA first determined in 1977 that there is evidence of emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains in livestock. The long-established practice of permitting OTC sales of antibiotics (including penicillin and other drugs) to lay animal owners for administration to their own animals nonetheless continued in all states.
In 2000, the FDA announced their intention to revoke approval of [[fluoroquinolone]] use in poultry production because of substantial evidence linking it to the emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant ''[[Campylobacter]]'' infections in humans. Legal challenges from the food animal and pharmaceutical industries delayed the final decision to do so until 2006.&lt;ref name="Nelson-2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nelson JM, Chiller TM, Powers JH, Angulo FJ | title = Fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter species and the withdrawal of fluoroquinolones from use in poultry: a public health success story | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 44 | issue = 7 | pages = 977–80 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17342653 | doi = 10.1086/512369 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluroquinolones have been banned from extra-label use in food animals in the USA since 2007. However, they remain widely used in companion and exotic animals.

===Global action plans and awareness===

The increasing interconnectedness of the world and the fact that new classes of antibiotics have not been developed and approved for more than 25 years highlight the extent to which antimicrobial resistance is a global health challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rand.org/randeurope/research/health/focus-on-antimicrobial-resistance.html|title=RAND Europe Focus on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)|website=www.rand.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180421004546/https://www.rand.org/randeurope/research/health/focus-on-antimicrobial-resistance.html|archive-date=21 April 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A global action plan to tackle the growing problem of resistance to antibiotics and other antimicrobial medicines was endorsed at the Sixty-eighth World Health Assembly in May 2015.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wpro.who.int/entity/drug_resistance/resources/global_action_plan_eng.pdf|title=GLOBAL ACTION PLAN ON ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE|last=WHO|first=|date=|website=|access-date=November 14, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031170522/http://www.wpro.who.int/entity/drug_resistance/resources/global_action_plan_eng.pdf|archive-date=31 October 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key objectives of the plan is to improve awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance through effective communication, education and training. This global action plan developed by the World Health Organization was created to combat the issue of antimicrobial resistance and was guided by the advice of countries and key stakeholders. The WHO's global action plan is composed of five key objectives that can be targeted through different means, and represents countries coming together to solve a major problem that can have future health consequences.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Antibiotic Awareness Week ====
The World Health Organization has promoted the first World Antibiotic Awareness Week running from 16–22 November 2015. The aim of the week is to increase global awareness of antibiotic resistance. It also wants to promote the correct usage of antibiotics across all fields in order to prevent further instances of antibiotic resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/events/2015/world-antibiotic-awareness-week/event/en/|title=World Antibiotic Awareness Week|website=World Health Organization|access-date=20 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120222039/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/events/2015/world-antibiotic-awareness-week/event/en/|archive-date=20 November 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World Antibiotic Awareness Week has been held every November since 2015. For 2017, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) are together calling for responsible use of antibiotics in humans and animals to reduce the emergence of antibiotic resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/campaigns/world-antibiotic-awareness-week/2017/launch-event/en/|title=World Antibiotic Awareness Week|website=WHO|access-date=14 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113074006/http://www.who.int/campaigns/world-antibiotic-awareness-week/2017/launch-event/en/|archive-date=13 November 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms and organisms==

===Fundamentals===
[[File:mecA Resistance.svg|thumb|Diagram depicting antibiotic resistance through alteration of the antibiotic's target site, modeled after MRSA's resistance to penicillin. Beta-lactam antibiotics permanently inactivate [[Penicillin-binding protein|PBP enzymes]], which are essential for bacterial life, by permanently binding to their active sites. [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]], however, expresses a PBP that does not allow the antibiotic into its active site.|alt=Diagram depicting antibiotic resistance through alteration of the antibiotic's target site]]

The four main mechanisms by which microorganisms exhibit resistance to antimicrobials are:
# Drug inactivation or modification: for example, enzymatic deactivation of [[Penicillin|''penicillin'' G]] in some penicillin-resistant bacteria through the production of [[Beta-lactamases|β-lactamases]]. Most commonly, the protective enzymes produced by the bacterial cell will add an acetyl or phosphate group to a specific site on the antibiotic, which will reduce its ability to bind to the bacterial ribosomes and disrupt protein synthesis.&lt;ref name="Criswell, Daniel 2004"&gt;[Criswell, Daniel. "The "Evolution" of Antibiotic Resistance." Institute for Creation Research. N.p., 2004. Web. 28 Oct. 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Alteration of target- or binding site: for example, alteration of [[Penicillin binding protein|PBP]]—the binding target site of penicillins—in [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] and other penicillin-resistant bacteria. Another protective mechanism found among bacterial species is ribosomal protection proteins. These proteins protect the bacterial cell from antibiotics that target the cell’s ribosomes to inhibit protein synthesis. The mechanism involves the binding of the ribosomal protection proteins to the ribosomes of the bacterial cell, which in turn changes its conformational shape. This allows the ribosomes to continue synthesizing proteins essential to the cell while preventing antibiotics from binding to the ribosome to inhibit protein synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Connell SR, Tracz DM, Nierhaus KH, Taylor DE | title = Ribosomal protection proteins and their mechanism of tetracycline resistance | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 47 | issue = 12 | pages = 3675–81 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14638464 | pmc = 296194 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.47.12.3675-3681.2003 | url = http://aac.asm.org/content/47/12/3675 | access-date = 14 June 2018 | dead-url = no | df = dmy-all | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180601200938/http://aac.asm.org/content/47/12/3675 | archive-date = 1 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Alteration of metabolic pathway: for example, some [[sulfa drugs|sulfonamide]]-resistant bacteria do not require [[para-aminobenzoic acid]] (PABA), an important precursor for the synthesis of [[folic acid]] and [[nucleic acid]]s in bacteria inhibited by sulfonamides, instead, like mammalian cells, they turn to using preformed folic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henry|first=Richard J.|date=December 1943|title=THE MODE OF ACTION OF SULFONAMIDES *|pmc=440870|journal=Bacteriological Reviews|volume=7|issue=4|pages=175–262|issn=0005-3678|pmid=16350088}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Reduced drug accumulation: by decreasing drug [[Semipermeable membrane|permeability]] or increasing active [[efflux (microbiology)|efflux]] (pumping out) of the drugs across the cell surface&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li XZ, Nikaido H | title = Efflux-mediated drug resistance in bacteria: an update | journal = Drugs | volume = 69 | issue = 12 | pages = 1555–623 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19678712 | pmc = 2847397 | doi = 10.2165/11317030-000000000-00000 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; These pumps  within the cellular membrane of certain bacterial species are used to pump antibiotics out of the cell before they are able to do any damage. They are often activated by a specific substrate associated with an antibiotic.&lt;ref&gt;[RI Aminov, RI Mackie. Evolution and ecology of antibiotic resistance genes. Microbiology Letters. 8 May 2007. {{DOI|10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00757.x]}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in [[fluoroquinolone]] resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morita Y, Kodama K, Shiota S, Mine T, Kataoka A, Mizushima T, Tsuchiya T | title = NorM, a putative multidrug efflux protein, of Vibrio parahaemolyticus and its homolog in Escherichia coli | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 42 | issue = 7 | pages = 1778–82 | date = July 1998 | pmid = 9661020 | pmc = 105682 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Antibiotic resistance mechanisms.jpg|thumb|300x300px|A number of mechanisms used by common antibiotics to deal with bacteria and ways by which bacteria become resistant to them.|alt=Infographic showing mechanisms for antibiotic resistance]]

Antibiotic resistance can be a result of [[horizontal gene transfer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ochiai K, Yamanaka T, Kimura K, Sawada O, O | year = 1959 |title = Inheritance of drug resistance (and its transfer) between Shigella strains and Between Shigella and E.coli strains|journal= Hihon Iji Shimpor |page= 1861|volume= 34|language= Japanese|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also of unlinked point mutations in the [[pathogen]] [[genome]] at a rate of about 1 in 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; per chromosomal replication. Mutations are rare but the fact that bacteria reproduce at such a high rate allows for the effect to be significant. A mutation may produce a change in the binding site of the antibiotic, which may allow the site to continue proper functioning in the presence of the antibiotic or prevent the binding of the antibiotic to the site altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cirz RT, Chin JK, Andes DR, de Crécy-Lagard V, Craig WA, Romesberg FE | title = Inhibition of mutation and combating the evolution of antibiotic resistance | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages = e176 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15869329 | pmc = 1088971 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030176 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antibiotic action against a pathogen can be seen as an environmental pressure. Those bacteria with a mutation that allows them to survive will reproduce, pass the trait to their offspring, which leads to the [[microevolution]] of a fully resistant colony. Chromosomal mutations providing antibiotic resistance benefit the bacteria but also confer a cost of fitness. For example, a ribosomal mutation may protect a bacterial cell by changing the binding site of an antibiotic but will also slow protein synthesis.&lt;ref name="Criswell, Daniel 2004" /&gt; manifesting, in slower growth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Levin BR, Perrot V, Walker N | title = Compensatory mutations, antibiotic resistance and the population genetics of adaptive evolution in bacteria | journal = Genetics | volume = 154 | issue = 3 | pages = 985–97 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10757748 | pmc = 1460977 | url = http://www.genetics.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10757748 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Gram-negative bacteria, plasmid-mediated resistance genes produce proteins that can bind to [[DNA gyrase]], protecting it from the action of quinolones. Finally, mutations at key sites in DNA gyrase or [[topoisomerase IV]] can decrease their binding affinity to quinolones, decreasing the drug's effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Robicsek A, Jacoby GA, Hooper DC | title = The worldwide emergence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance | journal = The Lancet. Infectious Diseases | volume = 6 | issue = 10 | pages = 629–40 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 17008172 | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(06)70599-0 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bacteria===
[[File:Klebsiella pneumoniae 01.png|thumb|''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'', the bacterium in which NDM-1 was first identified.|alt=Magnified Klebsiella pneumoniae]]
{{Further|List of antibiotic resistant bacteria}}[[Bacteria]]&amp;nbsp;can often develop&amp;nbsp;[[antibiotic]]&amp;nbsp;resistance. [[Mutation]]s that confer increased survival are selected for in [[natural selection]], which can happen quickly in bacteria because lifespans and production of new generations can be on a timescale of mere hours. A new (de novo) mutation in a parent cell can quickly become an [[heredity|inherited]] mutation of widespread prevalence. Moreover, some adaptive mutations can propagate not only through inheritance but also through [[horizontal gene transfer]]. Very often this is done via [[plasmid]]s, however, through means of [[Transduction (genetics)]], [[Transformation (genetics)]] and chromosomal [[Conjugation (genetics)]], resistance genes residing on bacterial chromosomes can also be transferred. If the new DNA is maintained in the receiving bacterium, this transfer is followed by inheritance of the new resistance from parents to offspring.

Recent findings show no necessity of large populations of bacteria for the appearance of antibiotic resistance. Small populations of ''E. coli'' in an antibiotic gradient can become resistant. Any heterogeneous environment with respect to nutrient and antibiotic gradients may facilitate antibiotic resistance in small bacterial populations. Researchers hypothesize that the mechanism of resistance development is based on four SNP mutations in the genome of ''E. coli'' produced by the gradient of antibiotic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johansen TB, Scheffer L, Jensen VK, Bohlin J, Feruglio SL | title = Whole-genome sequencing and antimicrobial resistance in Brucella melitensis from a Norwegian perspective | language = En | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 8538 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29867163 | pmc = 5986768 | doi = 10.1038/s41598-018-26906-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antibiotic resistance can be introduced artificially into a microorganism through laboratory protocols, sometimes used as a [[selectable marker]] to examine the mechanisms of gene transfer or to identify individuals that absorbed a piece of DNA that included the resistance gene and another gene of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chan CX, Beiko RG, Ragan MA | title = Lateral transfer of genes and gene fragments in Staphylococcus extends beyond mobile elements | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 193 | issue = 15 | pages = 3964–77 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21622749 | pmc = 3147504 | doi = 10.1128/JB.01524-10 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viruses===
Specific [[antiviral drug]]s are used to treat some viral infections. These drugs prevent viruses from reproducing by inhibiting essential stages of the virus's replication cycle in infected cells. Antivirals are used to treat [[HIV]], [[hepatitis B]], [[hepatitis C]], [[influenza]], [[herpesviridae|herpes viruses]] including [[varicella zoster virus]], [[cytomegalovirus]] and [[Epstein-Barr virus]]. With each virus, some strains have become resistant to the administered drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lou Z, Sun Y, Rao Z | title = Current progress in antiviral strategies | journal = Trends in Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 86–102 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24439476 | doi = 10.1016/j.tips.2013.11.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resistance to HIV antivirals is problematic, and even multi-drug resistant strains have evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pennings PS | title = HIV Drug Resistance: Problems and Perspectives | journal = Infectious Disease Reports | volume = 5 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = e5 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 24470969 | pmc = 3892620 | doi = 10.4081/idr.2013.s1.e5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Resistant strains of the HIV virus emerge rapidly if only one antiviral drug is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ton Q, Frenkel L | title = HIV drug resistance in mothers and infants following use of antiretrovirals to prevent mother-to-child transmission | journal = Current HIV Research | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 126–36 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23432488 | doi = 10.2174/1570162x11311020005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using three or more drugs together has helped to control this problem, but new drugs are needed because of the continuing emergence of drug-resistant HIV strains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ebrahim O, Mazanderani AH | title = Recent developments in hiv treatment and their dissemination in poor countries | journal = Infectious Disease Reports | volume = 5 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = e2 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 24470966 | pmc = 3892621 | doi = 10.4081/idr.2013.s1.e2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fungi===
Infections by fungi are a cause of high morbidity and mortality in [[Immunodeficiency|immunocompromised]] persons, such as those with HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis or receiving [[chemotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Xie JL, Polvi EJ, Shekhar-Guturja T, Cowen LE | title = Elucidating drug resistance in human fungal pathogens | journal = Future Microbiology | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 523–42 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24810351 | doi = 10.2217/fmb.14.18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fungi [[Candida (fungus)|candida]], ''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]'' and ''[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]'' cause most of these infections and antifungal resistance occurs in all of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Srinivasan A, Lopez-Ribot JL, Ramasubramanian AK | title = Overcoming antifungal resistance | journal = Drug Discovery Today: Technologies | volume = 11 | pages = 65–71 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24847655 | pmc = 4031462 | doi = 10.1016/j.ddtec.2014.02.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Multidrug resistance in fungi is increasing because of the widespread use of antifungal drugs to treat infections in immunocompromised individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Costa C, Dias PJ, Sá-Correia I, Teixeira MC | title = MFS multidrug transporters in pathogenic fungi: do they have real clinical impact? | journal = Frontiers in Physiology | volume = 5 | pages = 197 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24904431 | pmc = 4035561 | doi = 10.3389/fphys.2014.00197 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of particular note, [[Fluconazole]]-resistant Candida species have been highlighted as a growing problem by the CDC.&lt;ref name="CDC2013" /&gt; More than 20 species of Candida can cause [[Candidiasis]] infection, the most common of which is ''[[Candida albicans]]''. Candida yeasts normally inhabit the skin and mucous membranes without causing infection. However, overgrowth of Candida can lead to Candidiasis. Some Candida strains are becoming resistant to first-line and second-line [[Antifungal|antifungal agents]] such as [[Azole#Use as anti-fungal agents|azoles]] and [[echinocandin]]s.&lt;ref name="CDC2013" /&gt;

===Parasites===

The [[protozoa]]n parasites that cause the diseases [[malaria]], [[trypanosomiasis]], [[toxoplasmosis]], [[cryptosporidiosis]] and [[leishmaniasis]] are important human pathogens.&lt;ref name="pmid25057459"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Andrews KT, Fisher G, Skinner-Adams TS | title = Drug repurposing and human parasitic protozoan diseases | journal = International Journal for Parasitology.

== History ==
The discovery of penicillin in 1928 and other antibiotics in the 20th century proved to be a significant medical achievement, saving millions of lives and significantly reducing the burden of infectious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Adedeji WA | title = THE TREASURE CALLED ANTIBIOTICS | journal = Annals of Ibadan Postgraduate Medicine | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 56–57 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 28337088 | pmc = 5354621 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1950s to 1970s represented the golden age of antibiotic discovery, where countless new classes of antibiotics were discovered to treat previously incurable diseases such as tuberculosis and syphilis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aminov RI | title = A brief history of the antibiotic era: lessons learned and challenges for the future | language = English | journal = Frontiers in Microbiology | volume = 1 | pages = 134 | date = 2010 | pmid = 21687759 | pmc = 3109405 | doi = 10.3389/fmicb.2010.00134 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since that time the discovery of new classes of antibiotics has been almost nonexistent, and represents a situation that is especially problematic considering the resiliency of bacteria shown over time and the continued misuse and overuse of antibiotics in treatment.&lt;ref name="worldcat.org"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Antimicrobial resistance : global report on surveillance|others=World Health Organization,|isbn=9789241564748|location=Geneva, Switzerland|oclc=880847527|last1 = Organization|first1 = World Health|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of antimicrobial resistance caused by overuse of antibiotics was predicted by [[Alexander Fleming]] who said "The time may come when penicillin can be bought by anyone in the shops. Then there is the danger that the ignorant man may easily under-dose himself and by exposing his microbes to nonlethal quantities of the drug make them resistant."&lt;ref&gt;Amábile-Cuevas CF, editor.

==Society and culture==
For the [[fiscal year]] 2016 budget, President Obama suggested to nearly double the amount of federal funding to "combat and prevent" antibiotic resistance to more than $1.2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/27/fact-sheet-president-s-2016-budget-proposes-historic-investment-combat-a President’s 2016 Budget Proposes Historic Investment to Combat Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria to Protect Public Health] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311113659/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/27/fact-sheet-president-s-2016-budget-proposes-historic-investment-combat-a |date=11 March 2015 }} The White House, Office of the Press Secretary, January 27, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Many international funding agencies like USAID, DFID, [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency|SIDA]] and [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] have pledged money for developing strategies to counter antimicrobial resistance.

Since the mid-1980s pharmaceutical companies have invested in medications for cancer or chronic disease that have greater potential to make money and have "de-emphasized or dropped development of antibiotics".&lt;ref name="NYT_jan_21_2016" /&gt; On January 20, 2016 at the [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]], more than "80 pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies" from around the world called for "transformational commercial models" at a global level to spur research and development on antibiotics and on the "enhanced use of diagnostic tests that can rapidly identify the infecting organism".&lt;ref name="NYT_jan_21_2016"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/business/to-fight-superbugs-drug-makers-call-for-incentives-to-develop-antibiotics.html?smid=tw-share | title=To Fight 'Superbugs,' Drug Makers Call for Incentives to Develop Antibiotics | publisher=New York Times | date=20 January 2016 | access-date=24 January 2016 | last=Pollack | first=Andrew | name-list-format=vanc | series=Davos 2016 Special Report | location=Davos, Switzerland | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424142407/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/business/to-fight-superbugs-drug-makers-call-for-incentives-to-develop-antibiotics.html?smid=tw-share | archive-date=24 April 2018 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal frameworks===
Some global health scholars have argued that a global, legal framework is needed to prevent and control antimicrobial resistance.&lt;ref name="A. Behdinan, S.J.

==== U.S. ====
On March 27, 2015, the [[White House]] released a comprehensive plan to address the increasing need for agencies to combat the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The Task Force for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria developed ''The National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria'' with the intent of providing a roadmap to guide the US in the antibiotic resistance challenge and with hopes of saving many lives. This plan outlines steps taken by the Federal government over the next five years needed in order to prevent and contain outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant infections; maintain the efficacy of antibiotics already on the market; and to help to develop future diagnostics, antibiotics, and vaccines.&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/03/27/fact-sheet-obama-administration-releases-national-action-plan-combat-ant|title=FACT SHEET: Obama Administration Releases National Action Plan to Combat Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria|website=whitehouse.gov|access-date=2015-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122075741/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/03/27/fact-sheet-obama-administration-releases-national-action-plan-combat-ant|archive-date=22 November 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Action Plan was developed around five goals with focuses on strengthening health care, public health veterinary medicine, agriculture, food safety and research, and manufacturing. These goals, as listed by the White House, are as follows:
* Slow the Emergence of Resistant Bacteria and Prevent the Spread of Resistant Infections
* Strengthen National One-Health Surveillance Efforts to Combat Resistance
* Advance Development and use of Rapid and Innovative Diagnostic Tests for Identification and Characterization of Resistant Bacteria
* Accelerate Basic and Applied Research and Development for New Antibiotics, Other Therapeutics, and Vaccines
* Improve International Collaboration and Capacities for Antibiotic Resistance Prevention, Surveillance, Control and Antibiotic Research and Development
The following are goals set to meet by 2020:&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov"/&gt;
* Establishment of antimicrobial programs within acute care hospital settings
* Reduction of inappropriate antibiotic prescription and use by at least 50% in outpatient settings and 20% inpatient settings
* Establishment of State Antibiotic Resistance (AR) Prevention Programs in all 50 states
* Elimination of the use of medically important antibiotics for growth promotion in food-producing animals.

=== Policies ===
According to [[World Health Organization|WHO]] policymakers can help tackle resistance by strengthening resistance tracking and laboratory capacity; regulating and promoting appropriate use of medicines.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt; Policymakers and industry can help tackle resistance by: fostering innovation and research and development of new tools; promoting cooperation and information sharing among all stakeholders.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;

== Further research ==
It is unclear if rapid viral testing affects antibiotic use in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Doan Q, Enarson P, Kissoon N, Klassen TP, Johnson DW | title = Rapid viral diagnosis for acute febrile respiratory illness in children in the Emergency Department | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 9 | issue = 9 | pages = CD006452 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25222468 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006452.pub4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vaccines===
Microorganisms do not develop resistance to [[vaccine]]s because a vaccine enhances the body's immune system, whereas an antibiotic operates separately from the body's normal defenses. Furthermore, if the use of vaccines increases, there is evidence that antibiotic resistant strains of pathogens will decrease; the need for antibiotics will naturally decrease as vaccines prevent infection before it occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mishra RP, Oviedo-Orta E, Prachi P, Rappuoli R, Bagnoli F | title = Vaccines and antibiotic resistance | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 15 | issue = 5 | pages = 596–602 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22981392 | doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2012.08.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, new strains that escape immunity induced by vaccines may [[Evolution|evolve]]; for example, an updated [[influenza vaccine]] is needed each year.

While theoretically promising, antistaphylococcal vaccines have shown limited efficacy, because of immunological variation between ''Staphylococcus'' species, and the limited duration of effectiveness of the antibodies produced. Development and testing of more effective vaccines is underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homesteadschools.com/nursing/courses/Immunity/Chapter05.html|title=Immunity, Infectious Diseases, and Pandemics—What You Can Do|publisher=HomesteadSchools.com|access-date=2013-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203005320/http://www.homesteadschools.com/nursing/courses/Immunity/Chapter05.html|archive-date=3 December 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternating therapy===
Alternating therapy is a proposed method in which two or three antibiotics are taken in a rotation versus taking just one antibiotic such that bacteria resistant to one antibiotic are killed when the next antibiotic is taken. Studies have found that this method reduces the rate at which antibiotic resistant bacteria emerge in vitro relative to a single drug for the entire duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim S, Lieberman TD, Kishony R | title = Alternating antibiotic treatments constrain evolutionary paths to multidrug resistance | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 40 | pages = 14494–9 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25246554 | pmc = 4210010 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1409800111 | bibcode = 2014PNAS..11114494K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have found that bacteria that evolve antibiotic resistance towards one group of antibiotic may become more sensitive to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pál C, Papp B, Lázár V | title = Collateral sensitivity of antibiotic-resistant microbes | journal = Trends in Microbiology | volume = 23 | issue = 7 | pages = 401–7 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25818802 | pmc = 5958998 | doi = 10.1016/j.tim.2015.02.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon can be utilized to select against resistant bacteria using an approach termed collateral sensitivity cycling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Imamovic L, Sommer MO | title = Use of collateral sensitivity networks to design drug cycling protocols that avoid resistance development | journal = Science Translational Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = 204 | pages = 204ra132 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 24068739 | doi = 10.1126/scitranslmed.3006609 | url = http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/5/204/204ra132 | access-date = 4 February 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180205001624/http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/5/204/204ra132 | archive-date = 5 February 2018 | dead-url = no | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which has recently been found to be relevant in developing treatment strategies for chronic infections caused by ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Imamovic L, Ellabaan MM, Dantas Machado AM, Citterio L, Wulff T, Molin S, Krogh Johansen H, Sommer MO | title = Drug-Driven Phenotypic Convergence Supports Rational Treatment Strategies of Chronic Infections | journal = Cell | volume = 172 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 121–134.e14 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29307490 | pmc = 5766827 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2017.12.012 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867417314927 | access-date = 4 February 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180109074100/http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867417314927 | archive-date = 9 January 2018 | dead-url = no | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of new drugs===
Since the discovery of antibiotics, [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) efforts have provided new drugs in time to treat bacteria that became resistant to older antibiotics, but in the 2000s there has been concern that development has slowed enough that seriously ill people may run out of treatment options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu J, Bedell TA, West JG, Sorensen EJ | title = Design and Synthesis of Molecular Scaffolds with Anti-infective Activity | journal = Tetrahedron | volume = 72 | issue = 25 | pages = 3579–3592 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27284210 | pmc = 4894353 | doi = 10.1016/j.tet.2016.01.044 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wp.dh.gov.uk/publications/files/2013/03/CMO-Annual-Report-Volume-2-20111.pdf |title=Annual Report of the Chief Medical Officer - Infections and the rise of antimicrobial resistance|date=2011|publisher=UK NHS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030190650/http://media.dh.gov.uk/network/357/files/2013/03/CMO-Annual-Report-Volume-2-20111.pdf|archive-date=30 October 2013|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another concern is that doctors may become reluctant to perform routine surgeries because of the increased risk of harmful infection.&lt;ref name="obama"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/06/04/188380562/obama-administration-seeks-to-loosen-antibiotic-approvals|title=Obama Administration Seeks To Ease Approvals For Antibiotics|date=4 June 2013|publisher=NPR|access-date=7 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313042023/http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/06/04/188380562/obama-administration-seeks-to-loosen-antibiotic-approvals|archive-date=13 March 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Backup treatments can have serious side-effects; for example, treatment of [[multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis]] can cause deafness or psychological disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/06/04/188566805/moldova-grapples-with-whether-to-isolate-tb-patients|title=Moldova Grapples With Whether To Isolate TB Patients|date=4 June 2013|publisher=NPR|access-date=7 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803104507/http://www.npr.org/2013/06/04/188566805/moldova-grapples-with-whether-to-isolate-tb-patients|archive-date=3 August 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The potential crisis at hand is the result of a marked decrease in industry R&amp;D.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21737844|title=BBC News&amp;nbsp;— Antibiotics resistance 'as big a risk as terrorism' – medical chief|last=Walsh|first=Fergus|name-list-format=vanc|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|access-date=2013-03-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180808002730/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21737844|archive-date=8 August 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Poor financial investment in antibiotic research has exacerbated the situation.&lt;ref name="TheRealNews-2014-05-18"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=11872 | title = Why Are Antibiotics Becoming Useless All Over the World? | first = Martin | last = Khor | name-list-format = vanc | author-link = Martin Khor | date = 2014-05-18 | publisher = [[The Real News]] | access-date = 2014-05-18 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140518173348/http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=11872 | archive-date = 18 May 2014 | dead-url = no | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; The pharmaceutical industry has little incentive to invest in antibiotics because of the high risk and because the potential financial returns are less likely to cover the cost of [[drug development|development]] than for other pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Antibiotic Resistance: Why Aren't Drug Companies Developing New Medicines to Stop Superbugs?|last = Nordrum | first =  Amy | name-list-format = vanc | publisher = International Business Times|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[Pfizer]], one of the last major pharmaceutical companies developing new antibiotics, shut down its primary research effort, citing poor shareholder returns relative to drugs for chronic illnesses.&lt;ref name="medpage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/InfectiousDisease/GeneralInfectiousDisease/24708|title=Pfizer Moves May Dim Prospect for New Antibiotics|last=Gever|first=John|name-list-format=vanc|date=2011-02-04|publisher=MedPage Today|access-date=2013-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214004508/http://www.medpagetoday.com/InfectiousDisease/GeneralInfectiousDisease/24708 |archive-date=14 December 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, small and medium-sized pharmaceutical companies are still active in antibiotic drug research.

Among the proposals:
* Create a 'robust, standing national clinical trials network for antibiotic testing' which will promptly enroll patients once identified to be suffering from dangerous bacterial infections.  The network will allow testing multiple new agents from different companies simultaneously for their safety and efficacy.
* Establish a 'Special Medical Use (SMU)' pathway for FDA to approve new antimicrobial agents for use in limited patient populations, shorten the approval timeline for new drug so patients with severe infections could benefit as quickly as possible.
* Provide economic incentives, especially for development of new classes of antibiotics, to offset the steep R&amp;D costs which drive away the industry to develop antibiotics.

===Phage therapy===
{{Main|Phage therapy}}

[[Phage therapy]] is the [[therapeutic]] use of [[bacteriophage]]s to treat [[pathogenic]] [[bacterial infection]]s.&lt;ref name="Kohn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/09/19/48hours/main522596.shtml|title=Silent Killers: Fantastic Phages?|publisher=|access-date=14 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210183045/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/09/19/48hours/main522596.shtml|archive-date=10 February 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phage therapy has many potential applications in human medicine as well as dentistry, veterinary science, and agriculture.&lt;ref name="McAuliffe"&gt;{{cite book | chapter-url = http://www.highveld.com/pages2/phage.html | author = McAuliffe et al. | chapter = The New Phage Biology: From Genomics to Applications" (introduction) | veditors = McGrath S, van Sinderen D | title = Bacteriophage: Genetics and Molecular Biology | publisher = Caister Academic Press | isbn = 978-1-904455-14-1 | year = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phage therapy relies on the use of naturally-occurring bacteriophages to infect and lyse bacteria at the site of infection in a host. Due to current advances in genetics and biotechnology these bacteriophages can possibly be manufactured to treat specific infections.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lin DM, Koskella B, Lin HC | title = Phage therapy: An alternative to antibiotics in the age of multi-drug resistance | journal = World Journal of Gastrointestinal Pharmacology and Therapeutics | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 162–173 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28828194 | pmc = 5547374 | doi = 10.4292/wjgpt.v8.i3.162 | url = http://www.wjgnet.com/2150-5349/full/v8/i3/162.htm | access-date = 23 April 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180424135945/https://www.wjgnet.com/2150-5349/full/v8/i3/162.htm | archive-date = 24 April 2018 | dead-url = no | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phages can be bioengineered to target multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, and their use involves the added benefit of preventing the elimination of beneficial bacteria in the human body.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Phages destroy bacterial cell walls and membrane through the use of lytic proteins which kill bacteria by making many holes from the inside out.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Salmond GP, Fineran PC | title = A century of the phage: past, present and future | language = En | journal = Nature Reviews.

Bioengineering can play a role in creating successful bacteriophages.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Understanding the mutual interactions and evolutions of bacterial and phage populations in the environment of a human or animal body is essential for rational phage therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Letarov AV, Golomidova AK, Tarasyan KK | title = Ecological basis for rational phage therapy | journal = Acta Naturae | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 60–72 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 22649629 | pmc = 3347537 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 August 2013, [[Egypt]]ian security forces and army under the command of general [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] raided two camps of [[protest]]ers in [[Cairo]]: one at al-Nahda Square and a larger one at [[Rabaa al-Adawiya Square]]. The two sites had been occupied by supporters of ousted President [[Mohamed Morsi]], who had been [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état|removed from office]] by the military a month earlier in a military coup d'etat against him. The camps were raided after initiatives to end the six-week [[sit-in]]s by peaceful means failed and as a result of the raids the camps were cleared out within hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/15/rabaa-al-adawiyah-photos-destroyed_n_3761648.html |title=Rabaa Al-Adawiyah Mosque Destroyed In Cairo Clashes |newspaper=Huffington Post |date=15 August 2013 |accessdate=17 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Iz59JApz?url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/15/rabaa-al-adawiyah-photos-destroyed_n_3761648.html |archivedate=19 August 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{see also|Political violence in Egypt (2013)}}
Following the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011|2011 Egyptian revolution]] and subsequent instability, millions of Egyptians [[June 2013 Egyptian protests|took to the streets]] calling for the resignation of Egypt's [[Muslim Brotherhood]] president,&lt;ref name=morsi-think-again&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/01/28/think-again-the-muslim-brotherhood/|title=Think Again: The Muslim Brotherhood|publisher=Al-Monitor|date=28 January 2013|accessdate=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which culminated in the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état|ousting of President]] [[Mohamed Morsi]]. Prior to the anti-Morsi uprising, supporters of the deposed president occupied two squares — Rabaa al-Adawiya in Nasr City, Cairo and al-Nahda in Giza — originally to celebrate the one-year anniversary of his presidency, but from 3 July onwards to protest his ouster, vowing to remain until Morsi was reinstated.&lt;ref name="End Sit-Ins"&gt;{{Cite news |author1=Fahim, Kareem |author2=Gladstone, Rick |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/01/world/middleeast/egypt.html?_r=0 |title=Egypt Vows to End Sit-Ins by Supporters of Deposed President |newspaper=New York Times |date=31 July 2013 |accessdate=18 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Iz5PIYDK?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/01/world/middleeast/egypt.html?_r=1&amp; |archivedate=19 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities delayed clearing the two protest camps as internal and external reconciliation process was established to resolve the crisis peacefully.&lt;ref name="CantContinueEndlessly"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Epatkom, Larisa |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2013/08/egyptian-foreign-minister.html |title=Egyptian Foreign Minister: Pro-Morsi Protests 'Can't Continue Endlessly' |publisher=PBS |date=13 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6J0eFCzVq?url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2013/08/egyptian-foreign-minister.html |archivedate=20 August 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|title=Nearly 300 Killed as Egyptian Forces Storm Camps |date=14 August 2013 |work=New York Times |author=David D.

According to the military, the sit-ins were flash points for outbreaks of violence and bloody confrontations amongst pro-Morsi, anti-Morsi demonstrators and security forces.&lt;ref name="End Sit-Ins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DeathTollClimbs"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Hendawai, Hamza |url=https://news.yahoo.com/egypt-warns-sit-ins-weekend-death-toll-climbs-114638105.html |title=Egypt warns sit-ins as weekend death toll climbs |agency=Associated Press |date=28 July 2013 |accessdate=18 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Iz5fZQF6?url=http://news.yahoo.com/egypt-warns-sit-ins-weekend-death-toll-climbs-114638105.html |archivedate=19 August 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The encampments became a potent symbol of Egypt's impasse as they grew more permanent with stores, barbers and their own television station.&lt;ref name="End Sit-Ins" /&gt; Authorities saw the camps as destabilising and disruptive and representing "a threat to the Egyptian national security and an unacceptable terrorizing of citizens,"&lt;ref name="End Sit-Ins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DeathTollClimbs" /&gt; accusing the pro-Morsi side of provoking bloodshed to win sympathy&lt;ref name="DeathTollClimbs" /&gt; and considered the standoff as hindering their view of putting Egypt on a "roadmap" to restoring civilian democracy, with a new constitution and new elections.&lt;ref name="CantContinueEndlessly" /&gt; The government threatened a raid on the protest camps on multiple occasions.&lt;ref name=WaPost /&gt;  Allegedly, an ultimatum was issued prior to 14 August, although [[Al-Azhar]], Egypt's official Islamic authority, denied that such a warning had been given.&lt;ref name=Ahram /&gt;

===Warning===
Initiatives that tried to resolve the tension, including foreign-backed efforts by Gulf Arab countries, the E.U. and the U.S.A., failed to yield any positive outcomes before state authorities decreed these a failure and issued the ultimatum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/08/201381492232258172.html |title=Cairo crackdown follows failed negotiation |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=14 August 2013 |accessdate=15 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Iz5pynSy?url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/08/201381492232258172.html |archivedate=19 August 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[Hazem el-Beblawi]] warned just ahead of the Muslim [[Eid al-Fitr]] holiday that the government's decision to clear the sit-ins was "irreversible".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2013/08/11/egypt-morsi-protesters-crackdown.html |title=Egypt police to break up sit-in protests within 24 hours |publisher=CBC News |date=11 August 2013 |accessdate=18 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Iz5qxFye?url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2013/08/11/egypt-morsi-protesters-crackdown.html |archivedate=19 August 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Egyptian Interior Ministry|Interior Ministry]], the plan was originally to disperse the six-week-old sit-ins gradually by forming cordons around the two sites as early as dawn Monday, 12 August, allowing protesters to leave but preventing others from getting in, to minimize casualties before using water cannons and tear gas.&lt;ref name="MorsiSitIns"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-08-12/world/41299580_1_security-forces-anti-morsi-protesters-cairo |title=Pro-Morsi sit-ins gain strength, prompt Egypt to postpone dispersal to avoid bloodshed |newspaper=Washington Post |date=12 August 2013 |accessdate=16 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Iz6EgEi8?url=http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-08-12/world/41299580_1_security-forces-anti-morsi-protesters-cairo |archivedate=19 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, leaked news of the plan prompted thousands of protesters to defiantly flood into two protest camps, prompting police to postpone the move.

The protesters had been fortifying the sit-in camps. In Rabaa, men with helmets, sticks and what appeared to be protective sports equipment guarded barricades made of sandbags, truck tires and bricks. They also built three concrete waist-high barriers against armored vehicles.&lt;ref name="MorsiSitIns" /&gt;

==Dispersal==
On 14 August 2013, shortly after 07:00, Egyptian police moved to disperse the camps. According to the [[Egyptian Interior Ministry|Interior Ministry]], the plan was originally to stop the protests gradually by cutting off supply lines while providing a safe exit for those who elected to leave.

By 8:00 the smaller camp — near [[Cairo University]] in [[Giza]] — was cleared of protesters, but it took about 12 hours for police to take control of the main sit-in site near the [[Rabaa al-Adawiya Mosque]] that served as the epicenter of the pro-Morsi campaign.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;&lt;ref name="Operation"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=211850083 |title=Hundreds Reported Killed As Egypt Smashes Protests |agency=Associated Press |publisher=NPR |date=14 August 2013 |accessdate=20 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6J0eSfAh0?url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=211850083 |archivedate=20 August 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following armed protesters with guns attacking police, police in riot gear responded back using tear gas, rubber bullets, birdshot, and live ammunition to disperse the protesters. Police forces were supported by bulldozers (to clear barricades), armored vehicles, and rooftop snipers. Military helicopters swooped low over the encampment and, using loudspeakers, warned the thousands of demonstrators to leave the area along designated routes to safety.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;&lt;ref name="Operation" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/10243778/Egypt-Rifles-at-dawn-and-the-bloodshed-began.html |title=Egypt: Rifles at dawn, and the bloodshed began |date=14 August 2013 |newspaper=The Telegraph |accessdate=19 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Iz6FFNPN?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/10243778/Egypt-Rifles-at-dawn-and-the-bloodshed-began.html |archivedate=19 August 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For much of the afternoon, thousands of Morsi supporters chanting "[[Allahu Akbar]]" tried to join those besieged by the security forces inside the Nasr City camp. They were driven away when police fired tear gas.&lt;ref name="Operation" /&gt; All entrances to Rabaa were later blocked by security forces. Brotherhood spokesman Gehad El-Haddad accused police snipers of firing at Rabaa protesters from the rooftop of surrounding buildings&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/78982.aspx |title=Egypt police attack Muslim Brotherhood sit-ins in Cairo |date=14 August 2013 |newspaper=Al-Ahram |accessdate=19 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Iz4oFQQa?url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/78982.aspx |archivedate=19 August 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and protesters also said that snipers fired down on those trying to flee or reach safety.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; In the afternoon, the protesters managed to push the police back to the point where they could get into a makeshift hospital. Shortly before dusk, soldiers and police officers renewed their push and protestors were forced to flee.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; Government forces then seized control, destroying what remained of the protest camp.

Immediately after the morning raids, the [[Anti-Coup Alliance|National Coalition for Supporting Legitimacy]], a pro-Morsi group, reiterated its rejection of violence and called on its members to continue to protest "to stop the massacre".&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ahram /&gt; 
The attacks set off retaliatory clashes and protest marches.&lt;ref name=WaPost /&gt; Protesters blocked important roads, including the Ring Road, a key route that connects many of Cairo's major districts.&lt;ref name=Ahram /&gt; Crowds of Morsi supporters marched toward eastern Cairo in the late morning, running into a barrage of gunfire as they confronted police lines.&lt;ref name=WaPost /&gt; Separately, a number of attacks on police stations occurred around the country. Interior Minister [[Mohamed Ibrahim Moustafa|Mohamed Ibrahim]] put the number of stations attacked at 21. Angry mobs reportedly also attacked dozens of Christian properties.&lt;ref name=Ahram /&gt; By nightfall, the military-backed interim government had declared a state of emergency and instituted a curfew.&lt;ref name=WaPost /&gt; However, protesters established new sit-ins outside Mustafa Mahmoud Mosque in Mohandeseen, Giza&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.madamasr.com/content/update-some-protesters-leaving-rabea-sit-death-toll-rises|title=Update: Some protesters leaving Rabea sit-in, death toll rises|newspaper=Mada Masr|date=14 August 2013|accessdate=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others in cities around the country, defying the new curfew and the interior minister's vows to break up any such assemblies.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

==Aftermath==

The violence then spread across the country as people learned what had happened in Cairo and took to the streets in anger. In the [[Giza Governorate]], an angry mob attacked a police station, one of 21 such attacks according to the interior ministry.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ahram /&gt; In southern Egypt, between two and seven [[Coptic Christian]] churches were burned to the ground, according to the ''New York Times'',&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; while the interior ministry said that at least seven Coptic Christian churches had been vandalised or torched by suspected Islamists. One Coptic rights group, Maspero Youth Union (MYU), estimated that as many as 36 churches were "completely" devastated by fire across nine Egyptian governorates including in Minya, Sohag and Assiut, and many other churches were looted or stormed in ensuing street violence.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/79124/Egypt/Politics-/Churches-torched-across-Egypt-in-antiCoptic-violen.aspx |title=Churches torched across Egypt in anti-Coptic violence |newspaper=Al-Ahram |date=15 August 2013 |accessdate=19 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Iz7t10LF?url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/79124/Egypt/Politics-/Churches-torched-across-Egypt-in-antiCoptic-violen.aspx |archivedate=19 August 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian activists accused Morsi supporters of waging "a war of retaliation against Copts in Egypt."&lt;ref name="aljaz2"/&gt; According to the government, [[Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt|Muslim Brotherhood]] supporters attacked government headquarters in several governorates.&lt;ref name=WaPost /&gt; Supporters of Morsi staged solidarity protests against the crackdown, with clashes reported in Ismailia, Alexandria, Suez, Upper Egypt's Assiyut and Aswan and other places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/08/20138147553170355.html |title=Deadly clashes erupt in Egypt provinces |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=14 August 2013 |accessdate=15 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Iz7u5Q2J?url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/08/20138147553170355.html |archivedate=19 August 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13920523001223 |title=Protests in Alexandria, Upper Egypt after Cairo Sit-ins Attacked |agency=Fars News Agency |date=14 August 2013 |accessdate=15 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Iz8EeVwR?url=http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13920523001223 |archivedate=19 August 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In defiance of the curfew, Morsi supporters vowed to return to the streets to continue protesting against the crackdown and coup.&lt;ref name="aljaz2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/08/2013814224835732803.html |title=Egypt's interim PM defends deadly crackdown |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=15 August 2013 |accessdate=15 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Iz7tcwiU?url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/08/2013814224835732803.html |archivedate=19 August 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian banks and its stock market were closed through 15 August.&lt;ref name=WaPost /&gt; Rail travel into and out of Cairo was also suspended.&lt;ref name=Ahram /&gt; In Giza, hundreds of Morsi supporters also set fire to local government offices; the government then authorised the use of live ammunition on anyone attacking state buildings.&lt;ref name="aljaz3"/&gt;

;Rights groups
On 10 December, thirteen Egyptian and international human rights organizations urged Cairo's interim authorities to probe the violence during the sit-in dispersal in the capital on 14 August. The joint call issued by organizations that included Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, said an investigation must be launched into the killing of "up to 1,000 people by security forces" almost four months ago when they dispersed sit-ins by supporters of deposed president Mohamed Morsi. "There can be no hope for the rule of law and political stability in Egypt, much less some modicum of justice for victims, without accountability for what may be the single biggest incident of mass killing in Egypt's recent history," said Gasser Abdel-Razak, associate director at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. "As a first step toward accountability, the government should establish an effective independent fact-finding committee to investigate responsibility throughout the chain of command for the unlawful killings," the rights groups said. They said that on 14 August a "small minority of protesters used firearms... but the police responded excessively by shooting recklessly, going far beyond what is permitted under international law." "After the unprecedented levels of violence and casualties seen since the ousting of Mohamed Morsi, investigations must provide real answers and cannot be another whitewash of the security forces' record," Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui of Amnesty International said in the statement. "Egypt's authorities cannot deal with the carnage through PR in world's capitals, rewriting events and locking up Morsi's supporters." The groups also said the probe should determine whether there is any evidence of a policy to kill protesters or commit other serious crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/88788/Egypt/Politics-/Rights-groups-urge-probe-of-mass-killing-in-Egypt.aspx |title=Rights groups urge probe of mass killing in Egypt - Politics - Egypt - Ahram Online |publisher=English.ahram.org.eg |date= |accessdate=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[African Union]] – The AU was to send a panel consisting of former Malian president [[Alpha Oumar Konare]], former Botswana President [[Festus Mogae]] and former Djibouti Prime Minister [[Dileita Mohamed Dileita]], amongst others, to help find a resolution to the conflict. The panel was in Egypt from the end of July to early August.

==Preparation==
Axenic cultures of [[microorganism]]s are typically prepared by [[Subculture (biology)|subculture]] of an existing mixed culture. This may involve use of a [[serial dilution|dilution series]], in which a culture is successively diluted to the point where subsamples of it contain only a few individual organisms, ideally only a single individual (in the case of an [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] [[species]]). These subcultures are allowed to grow until the identity of their constituent organisms can be ascertained. Selection of those cultures consisting solely of the desired organism produces the axenic culture. Subculture selection may also involve manually sampling the target organism from an uncontaminated growth front in an otherwise mixed culture, and using this as an [[wikt:inoculum|inoculum]] source for the subculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1058062/pdf/applmicro00351-0052.pdf |title=Preparation of Axenic Cultures of Algae by Use of a French Press |author1=J.B. Middlebrook |author2=R.O.

Axenic cultures are usually checked routinely to ensure that they remain axenic.  One standard approach with microorganisms is to spread a sample of the culture onto an [[agar plate]], and to [[Incubator (microbiology)|incubate]] this for a fixed period of time.  The agar should be an enriched medium that will support the growth of common "contaminating" organisms.  Such "contaminating" organisms will grow on the plate during this period, identifying cultures that are no longer axenic.

==Experimental use==
As axenic cultures are derived from very few organisms, or even a single individual, they are useful because the organisms present within them share a relatively narrow [[gene pool]]. In the case of an asexual species derived from a single individual, the resulting culture should consist of  [[Cloning|identical]] organisms (though processes such as [[mutation]] and [[horizontal gene transfer]] may introduce a degree of variability).  Consequently, they will generally respond in a more uniform and [[Reproducibility|reproducible]] fashion, simplifying the interpretation of [[experiment]]s.

===Problems===
The axenic culture of some pathogens is complicated because they normally thrive within host tissues which exhibit properties that are difficult to replicate ''in vitro''.  This is especially true in the case of [[intracellular parasite|intracellular pathogens]].  However, careful replication of key features of the host environment can resolve these difficulties (e.g. host [[metabolite]]s, [[oxygen saturation|dissolved oxygen]]), such as with the [[Q fever]] pathogen, ''[[Coxiella burnetii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Omsland | first=Anders | year=2009 | title=Host cell-free growth of the Q fever bacterium ''Coxiella burnetii'' | journal=[[PNAS]] | volume=106 | pages=4430–4434 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0812074106 | pmid=19246385 | issue=11 | pmc=2657411 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bertoldo Batawang, Jr.''' (born October 26, 1971 in [[Cebu City]], [[Cebu]], [[Philippines]]), more commonly known as '''Bert Batawang''', is a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] professional [[Boxing|boxer]].

==Boxing career==

===Early career===
Batawang began his professional career in 1990, winning against Lolong Quiban by a first-round technical knockout. Batawang suffered multiple losses early in his career, and in 1995, he temporarily retired from the sport after losing a ten-round decision to future [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] [[List of light flyweight boxing champions|Light Flyweight World Champion]], [[Yo-Sam Choi]] (7-0) of [[South Korea]].

After five years away from the sport, Batawang made his ring return in 2000, fighting against unheralded Randy Narbay, whom he defeated by knockout (KO) in six rounds. He later went on to win the Philippines Boxing Federation (PBF) [[Light Flyweight]] title one year later, defeating Flash Villacura who held the title at the time. Two bouts later, Batawang lost a 12-round decision to future [[IBF]] [[List of strawweight boxing champions|Minimumweight World Champion]], [[Muhammad Rachman]] of [[Indonesia]]. After losing to Rachman, Batawang defended his PBF Light Flyweight title a total of five times before winning the Philippines Games &amp; Amusement Board (GAB) version of the title, after a failed bid against Wyndel Janiola.

A year later, he vied for the [[OPBF]] Light Flyweight title, then held by Shingo Yamaguchi of [[Japan]]. Batawang lost the fight by split decision (SD), by scores of 117-113, 116-113 for Yamaguchi, and a scorecard of 115-113 for Batawang. Following this bout, Batawang managed to defeat Sithembile Kibiti of [[South Africa]], winning the fight by KO in seven rounds, and also winning the then vacant [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] Pan African Light Flyweight title.

===First World Title shot===
After winning eight of his next nine fights, Batawang vied for his first world title against the then IBF [[List of light flyweight boxing champions|Light Flyweight World Champion]], [[Ulises Solís]] of [[Mexico]]. On December 15, 2007, in [[Guadalajara]], [[Jalisco]], [[Mexico]], Batawang failed in his bid for the IBF crown, losing to Solís by technical knockout (TKO) in the ninth round of the bout. The champion dismantled Batawang since the start of the fight, until the referee finally stopped the fight. "Batawang would later say after the fight that he was hit by Solis with a hard left over his right rib cage in the 5th round that practically immobilized him in the remainder of the contest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Is there anything left?===
Batawang won his next three fights after suffering the huge setback against Solís, also winning the then vacant [[WBO]] Oriental Light Flyweight title in the process after defeating Samransak Singmanassak of [[Thailand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first defense of the WBO Oriental title, he lost to fellow Filipino, Edren Dapudong by TKO in seven rounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2009-04-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt; After losing to Dapudong, Batawang traveled to [[Linyi]], [[China]], fighting Jack Amisa of Indonesia. "The Ninja" used his stealth and wit to defeat the Indonesian by knockout in the fifth round of the bout, winning the then vacant WBO Asia Pacific Light Flyweight title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He fought Ulises Solis on March 27, 2010 for the IBF Light Flyweight Title Eliminator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|archivedate=2010-03-07
|df=
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight was held at the Plaza Pueblo Antiguo in [[Mexico]]. The winner of the rematch between Batawang and Solis, which was originally scheduled for March 6, will become the mandatory challenger for IBF light flyweight titlist [[Carlos Tamara]], who defeated former champion [[Brian Viloria]] in January by TKO.

In the first three rounds the bout was fairly even. However, in the next rounds, Solis’ power and Batawang’s age began to tell: Batawang was floored in the 4th round and the Mexican fighter hammered him during the 5th round. The Filipino veteran boxer remained on his stool and was forced to retire at the beginning of the sixth round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8816">'''Computational criminology''' is an interdisciplinary field which uses computing science methods to formally define criminology concepts, improve our understanding of complex phenomena, and generate solutions for related problems.

==Methods==
Computing science methods being used include:
* [[Algorithms]]
* [[Data Mining]]
* [[Data Structures]]
* [[Formal Methods]]
* [[Software Development Process]]

==Areas of usage==

Computational criminology is interdisciplinary in the sense that both criminologists and computing scientists work together to ensure that computational models properly match their theoretical and real-world counterparts. Areas of criminology for which computational approaches are being used include:
* [[Environmental Criminology]]
* [[Identity Theft]]
* [[Justice]]

===Forensics===

Computational forensics (CF) is a [[quantitative research|quantitative approach]] to the methodology of the [[forensics|forensic sciences]]. It involves computer-based [[Scientific modeling|modeling]], [[computer simulation]], [[analysis]], and [[Pattern recognition|recognition]] in studying and solving problems posed in various forensic disciplines. '''CF''' integrates expertise from [[computational science]] and [[forensics|forensic sciences]].

A broad range of objects, substances and processes are investigated, which are mainly based on pattern evidence, such as toolmarks, fingerprints, shoeprints, documents etc.,&lt;ref&gt;S. N. Srihari, "Beyond CSI: The Rise of Computational Forensics", [http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/beyond-csi-the-rise-of-computational-forensics/0 IEEE Spectrum], pp. 38-43, December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; but also [[Physiology|physiological]] and [[behavioral pattern]]s, [[DNA]], [[digital evidence]] and [[crime scene]]s.

Computational methods find a place in the forensic sciences in several ways,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csm.ornl.gov/viz/apps/comp-foren.html Computational Forensics Project - Automated Reconstruction of Human Faces (Archival page 6/2002 )]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wong | first = J.L. |author2=Kirovski, D. |author3=Potkonjak, M. | title = Computational forensic techniques for intellectual property protection | journal =  [[IEEE]] Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems | issue = 6 | volume = 23| pages = 987–994 | year = 2004 | doi = 10.1109/TCAD.2004.828122 }} DIO 10.1109/TCAD.2004.828122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.genomeweb.com/informatics/propelled-computational-forensics-911-ncbi-preps-qa-software-id-katrina-victims Propelled Into Computational Forensics by 9/11, NCBI Preps QA Software to ID Katrina Victims (November 28, 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Franke | first = Katrin |author2=Srihari, Sargur | title = Computational Forensics: Towards Hybrid-Intelligent Crime Investigation | journal = Third International Symposium on Information Assurance and Security, 2007.

[[Computer forensics]] (also referred to as "[[digital forensics]]" or "forensic information technology") is one specific discipline that could use [[computational science]] to study [[digital evidence]]. '''Computational Forensics''' examines diverse types of [[evidence]].

====Forensic animation====

Forensic animation is a branch of [[forensic science]] in which [[audio-visual]] reconstructions of incidents or accidents are created to aid investigators.  Examples include the use of [[computer animation]], stills, and other audio visual aids.  Application of [[computer animation]] in courtrooms today is becoming more popular.

The first use of forensic animation was in ''Connors v. United States'', both sides used computer re-creations and animations in a case surrounding the crash of Delta Flight 191 on August 2, 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hofer|first1=Inga|title=The Rise of Courtroom Technology and its Effect on the Federal Rules of E vidence and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure|url=https://digitalcommons.law.msu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1102&amp;context=king|website=Michigan State University College of Law|accessdate=7 January 2018|date=1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crash resulted in the deaths of 137 people and extensive property damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gold|first1=Stuart|title=Future Forensic Animation - Its Origins, Creation, Limitations and Future|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/animation/forensic_animation.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the resulting lawsuit a method was required to explain complicated information and situations to the jury. As part of the plaintiff presentation, a 45-minute computer generated presentation was created to explain the intricacies of the evidence and thus began forensic animation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marcotte|first1=Paul|title=Animated Evidence - Delta 191 Crash Re-Created through Computer Simulations at Trial|journal=ABA Journal|date=1989|volume=75|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/abaj75&amp;div=261&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first reported use of computer animation in a U.S. criminal trial was in the 1991 Marin County, CA homicide trial of James Mitchell (of the porno-businessman Mitchell Brothers)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pinsky|first1=Mark I.|title=Jury Out on High-Tech Courtroom : Computer animation, televised testimony and other innovations could streamline the justice system. But they also raise fairness questions and worries about abuse.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-12-17/news/mn-2822_1_computer-animation|accessdate=7 January 2018|agency=L.A. Times|date=17 December 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution used the animation to explain the complex details of the shooting incident to the jury. It showed the positions of James Mitchell, Artie Mitchell (the victim), the bullet impact points, and the path taken by bullets as they entered Artie's body. The animation was admitted, over objection by the defense, and the case resulted in a conviction. The use of the animation was upheld on appeal and the success of the forensic animation led to its use in many other trials. In India Prof. [[T.D Dogra|T D Dogra]] at AIIMS New Delhi in 2008 used animation to explain the court of law and investigating agencies first time in two important cases of firearm injuries,case of Murder and Terrorist encounter killings([[Batla House encounter case|Batla house encounter case]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medind.nic.in/jal/t14/i1/jalt14i1p104.pdf|title=Reconstruction of Scene by Forensic Animation Two Case Reports|publisher=J Indian Acad Forensic Med.Vol. 36, No. 1|date=January 2014|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Coroners and Justice Act 2009''' (c. 25) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It changed the law on [[coroner]]s and [[criminal justice]] in [[England and Wales]].

Among its provisions are:
*preventing criminals from [[Son of Sam law|profiting from publications about their crimes]]&lt;ref name="MoJ"/&gt;
*abolishing the anachronistic offences of [[sedition]] and [[seditious libel|seditious]], [[defamatory libel|defamatory]] and [[obscene libel]]&lt;ref name="ILEX"/&gt;
*re-enacting the provisions of the emergency [[Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Act 2008]] so that the courts may continue to grant anonymity to vulnerable or intimidated witnesses where this is consistent with a defendant's right to a fair trial&lt;ref name="MoJ"/&gt;
*criminalising possession of pornographic non-photographic images depicting under-18s, and of adults where the "predominant impression conveyed"  [[Legal status of cartoon pornography depicting minors#United Kingdom|is of a person under the age of 18]].&lt;ref&gt;The Coroners and Justice Act 2009, Part 2, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/part/2/chapter/2 Chapter 2]&lt;/ref&gt;
*criminalising the holding of someone in slavery or servitude, or requiring them to perform forced or compulsory labour&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/slavery_servitude_and_forced_or_compulsory_labour/ CPS - Crown Prosecution Service, section 71]&lt;/ref&gt;
*provision for the abolition of the office of [[Coroner of the Queen's Household]].&lt;ref&gt;The Coroners and Justice Act 2009, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/section/46 section 46]&lt;/ref&gt;
*creation of the [[partial defence]] of [[loss of control (legal)|loss of control]] &lt;ref&gt;The Coroners and Justice Act 2009, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/section/54 Section 54]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act makes it illegal to own any picture depicting under-18s participating in sexual activities, or depictions of sexual activity in the presence of someone under 18. The law has been condemned by a coalition of graphic artists, publishers and MPs, fearing it will criminalise [[graphic novel]]s such as ''[[Lost Girls]]'' and ''[[Watchmen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/graphic-artists-condemn-plans-to-ban-erotic-comics-1652270.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Jerome | last=Taylor | title=Graphic artists condemn plans to ban erotic comics | date=23 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sections came into effect on 6 April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/04/06/cartoon_law_live/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act contains measures to reform the coroner system. According to the [[Institute of Legal Executives]], "There is provision, carefully circumscribed, for the establishment of a judicial inquiry under the [[Inquiries Act 2005|2005 Inquiries Act]] to take the place of an inquest, where there is highly sensitive evidence (typically intercept) and it would not be possible to have an Article 2 compliant inquest. These provisions will be used in rare cases only."&lt;ref name="ILEX"/&gt;

The most controversial{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} aspect of the bill are the provisions regarding secret inquests. The provisions had previously been mulled as part of the [[Counter-Terrorism Act 2008]], though ultimately they were dropped before the Counter-Terrorism Bill was finalised. Last-minute concessions, as the Coroners and Justice Bill passed through Parliament, included giving the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] the power to veto any requests for private inquests and also the power to decide who the judge is.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

==Hate crimes reform==

The [[Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]] amended Part 3A of the [[Public Order Act 1986]] to extend hate crime legislation to cover "hatred against a group of persons defined by reference to [[sexual orientation]] (whether towards persons of the same sex, the opposite sex or both)".

To prevent that Act being used to inhibit freedom of speech on the subject of homosexuality, the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act also inserted a new section 29JA, entitled "Protection of freedom of expression (sexual orientation)" but sometimes known as the Waddington Amendment (after [[David Waddington, Baron Waddington|Lord Waddington]] who introduced it). It reads:

{{quote|In this Part, for the avoidance of doubt, the discussion or criticism of sexual conduct or practices or the urging of persons to refrain from or modify such conduct or practices shall not be taken of itself to be threatening or intended to stir up hatred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2008/ukpga_20080004_en_33#sch16 Schedule 16, paragraph 14]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During debate on the Coroners and Justice Bill the Government unsuccessfully attempted to repeal section 29JA.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldbills/033/09033.36-41.html#j30_100 Coroners and Justice Bill]&lt;/ref&gt; Clause 61 (which would have repealed section 29JA) was introduced into Parliament by [[Jack Straw]] on 14 January 2009. The clause was voted down by the House of Lords,&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmbills/160/097160.15-18.html Lords Amendments to the Coroners and Justice Bill] (no. 59)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90709-0005.htm#09070982000983 Hansard, 9 July 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90709-0009.htm ''ibid.'']&lt;/ref&gt; reinstated by the House of Commons,&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091109/debtext/91109-0020.htm Hansard, 9 November 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; and voted down again by the Lords&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/91111-0010.htm Hansard, 11 November 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; before the Commons finally conceded that section 29JA could remain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091112/debtext/91112-0008.htm Hansard, 12 November 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable events with respect to the act==
In December 2012, owners of a family patio and paving business in [[Bedford]] were successfully prosecuted under the provision criminalising the holding of someone in slavery or servitude, or requiring them to perform forced or compulsory labour, between 2010 and 2011. The investigation of [[Unfree labour|forced labour]] began after the body of one of the family's workers was discovered in 2008. The family found using vulnerable [[mental illness|mentally ill]], [[alcoholism|alcoholic]], and [[homelessness|homeless]] men for forced labour very profitable, holding some men in servitude for decades and paying them as little as £5 a day (the [[National Minimum Wage Act 1998|National Minimum Wage]] at the time was £5.80 per hour for an adult aged 21 or over).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/19/traveller-family-jailed-forced-labour|title=Traveller family jailed over forced labour|author=Caroline Davies and agencies|date=19 December 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT121912"&gt;{{cite news|website=[[BBC News]]|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-20775623|title=Traveller family guilty of forced labour are jailed|date=19 December 2012|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crosbie Garstin''' (1887 – 19 April 1930) was a poet, best-selling [[novelist]] and the eldest son of the [[Newlyn School]] painter [[Norman Garstin]].&lt;ref name=nebes&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nebesnuick|first1=Sue|editor1-last=Walker|editor1-first=Dawn|title=Homes &amp; Households in West Cornwall 1550–1950 – Wellington Place and Wellington Terrace: a Regency Row in Penzance|date=2010|publisher=Penwith Local History Group|location=Penzance|isbn=978 09540249 5 6|pages=31–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is said to have been ''untameable as a child'', and to have ''died in mysterious circumstances'' after a boating accident in the [[Salcombe|Salcombe estuary]]. He is known for the Penhale trilogy, a novel based in 18th-century Cornwall.

==Personal life==
Crosbie was born in Mount Vernon, [[Newlyn]], [[Cornwall]] to Norman Garstin and Louisa ‘Dochie’ née Jones.&lt;ref name=cross&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cross|first1=Tom|title=The Shining Sands|date=1994|publisher=Halsgrove|location=Tiverton|isbn=1 89838 606 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the eldest of three children; Denys (later Denis) (1890  – 1918) and [[Alethea Garstin|Alethea]] (1894 – 1978).&lt;ref name=cross/&gt; He was educated at Brandon House, [[Cheltenham]], Elstow School, [[Bedford]] and in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mr Crosbie Garstin OE. Drowned in Salcombe Harbour|work=Bedfordshire Times and Independent|date=25 April 1930|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was head-boy of his school{{Clarify|reason=which school?|date=January 2016}} due to sporting prowess in [[rugby union]] and swimming.&lt;ref name=cai&gt;{{cite web|title=Crosbie GARSTIN|url=http://cornwallartists.org/cornwall-artists/crosbie-garstin|website=Cornwall Artists Index|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young man he travelled and worked as a [[bronco|bronco buster]] in [[Montana]], United States and as a [[lumberjack]] in Canada. He also travelled to China, [[Hawaii]], Japan and [[Morocco]].&lt;ref name=cman&gt;{{cite news|title=One great writer often forgotten|work=The Cornishman|date=2 July 2015|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On returning home his father, fed-up with Crosbie's inability to get suitable qualifications and hold down a job, sent him to [[South Africa]]. From 1912, he ran a cattle ranch in [[Bechuanaland Protectorate|Bechuanaland]], and acted as a bush ranger to the [[Tati Concessions Land|Tati Concessions]].&lt;ref name=tovey1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tovey|first1=David|title=Lamorna and the First World War. Crosbie Garson's War (Part one)|journal=The Flagstaff|date=Winter 2014|issue=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the outbreak of [[World War I]] he came back to Britain and in October 1914 joined B Squadron of the King Edward's Light Horse as a private. The [[cavalry]] regiment, which was open to [[Colonial troops|colonials]], was initially based in [[Watford]] and in the following spring, [[Bishop's Stortford]]. The regiment left for France on 21 April 1915 and Garstin was promoted to lance corporal shortly before leaving.&lt;ref name=tovey1/&gt; He was commissioned on the battlefield as a [[Second lieutenant#United Kingdom and Commonwealth|2nd lieutenant]] on 14 September 1915, and joined C Squadron, which was attached to the [[47th (1/2nd London) Division|47th (London) Division]] at [[Nœux-les-Mines]] and was involved in the [[Battle of Loos]] and on the Italian Front. In 1916, he was posted to Dublin as an Intelligence Officer during the rebellion there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Louis |last=Bolze |title=Publishers' Introduction to reprint edition of Crosbie Garstin, The Sunshine Settlers |year=1918 |publisher=Books of Rhodesia |edition=Bulawayo, 1971 |page=ii}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as writing poetry he made contributions to [[Punch (magazine)]] which were well received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tovey|first1=David|title=Crosbie Garstins War (Part Two): The Blinded Mole|journal=The Flagstaff|date=Summer 2015|issue=35|pages=23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''cycle of violence''' refers to repeated and dangerous acts of [[violence]]  as a cyclical pattern,&lt;ref name=HELP&gt;[http://helpguide.org/mental/domestic_violence_abuse_types_signs_causes_effects.htm#cycle ''The cycle of violence.''] Domestic Violence and Abuse, 
Signs of Abuse and Abusive Relationships. HELPGUIDE.org. Retrieved November 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  associated with high emotions and doctrines of [[Retributive justice|retribution]] or [[revenge]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}  The pattern, or cycle, repeats and can happen many times during a relationship.&lt;ref name=HELP/&gt; Each phase may last a different length of time, and over time the level of violence may increase.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} The phrase has been increasingly widespread since first popularised in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Google Ngram search&lt;/ref&gt;

It often refers to violent behavior learned as a child, and then repeated as an adult, therefore continuing on in a perceived cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, A. A. (2005). The Relationship Between Adolescent Physical Abuse and Criminal Offending: Support for an Enduring and Generalized Cycle of Violence. ''Journal of Family Violence.'' 20(5):279-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Within a relationship==

A cycle of abuse generally follows the following pattern:&lt;ref name=HELP/&gt; 
* [[Abuse]] &amp;ndash; The abuser initiates aggressive, [[verbal abuse|verbal]] or [[physical abuse]], designed to [[Abusive power and control|control]] and oppress the victim.
* [[Guilt (emotion)|Guilt]] &amp;ndash; The abuser feels guilty for inflicting abusive behavior, primarily out of a concern of being found guilty of abuse rather than feelings of sympathy for the victim.
* [[Rationalization (making excuses)|Excuses &amp;ndash; Rationalization]] of the behavior, including [[blame]] and excuses.
* "Normal" behavior &amp;ndash; The abuser regains personal control, creates a peaceful phase in an attempt to make the victim feel in the relationship.
* [[Fantasy (psychology)|Fantasy]] and planning &amp;ndash; thinking of what the victim has done wrong, how they will be punished, and developing a plan to realize the fantasy.
* Set-up &amp;ndash; the plan is "put in motion."

A cyclical nature of domestic violence is most prevalent in intimate terrorism (IT), which involve a pattern of ongoing [[Abusive power and control|control]] using emotional, physical and other forms of domestic violence and is what generally leads victims, who are most often women, to [[women's shelter]]s.  It is what was traditionally the definition of domestic violence and is generally illustrated with the "Power and Control Wheel"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncdsv.org/images/PowerControlwheelNOSHADING.pdf ''Power and Control Wheel,''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027084459/http://www.ncdsv.org/images/PowerControlwheelNOSHADING.pdf |date=2011-10-27 }} National Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence. Retrieved November 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; to illustrate the different and inter-related forms of abuse.

==Intergenerational==
[[Intergenerational]] cycles of violence occur when violence is passed from parent to child, or sibling to sibling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abusivelove.com/abuse_types_1_11.htm Intergenerational Cycle Of Abuse] AbusiveLove.com. Retrieved November 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated 1/5 to 1/3 of teenagers subject to viewing domestic violence situations experience [[teen dating violence]], regularly abusing or being abused by their partners verbally, mentally, emotionally, sexually and/or physically. Thirty to 50% of dating relationships can exhibit the same cycle of escalating violence in their marital relationships.&lt;ref name=SASS&gt;[http://www.sassnh.org/ ''Sexual Assault Survivor Services''] (SASS) Facts about domestic violence. (1996)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Physical punishment]] of children has also been linked to later [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gershoff, E.T. |date=2008 |title=Report on Physical Punishment in the United States: What Research Tells Us About Its Effects on Children |format=PDF |location=Columbus, OH |publisher=Center for Effective Discipline |page=16 |url=http://www.phoenixchildrens.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/principles_and_practices-of_effective_discipline.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family violence researcher [[Murray A. Straus]] believes that disciplinary [[spanking]] forms "the most prevalent and important form of violence in American families", whose effects contribute to several major societal problems, including later assaults on spouses.&lt;ref&gt;Straus, Murray A. (2000). [http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/CP62.pdf "Corporal punishment by parents: The cradle of violence in the family and society" (PDF).] ''Virginia Journal of Social Policy and the Law''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In politics==

Arab philosopher [[Ibn Khaldun]] in 1377 identified a cycle of violence in which successive [[dynasties]] take control of a state and establish [[asabiyyah]] or social cohesion, enabling them to expand to the limit. Excess 'pomp' causes the dynasty then to stagnate, become sedentary and collapse, giving way to conquest by a new, more ruthless dynasty. This cycle plays out over the course of three generations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], ''[[The Muqadimmah]]'', Routledge, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[John J. Mearsheimer]] the cycle of violence between nations will continue indefinitely because the [[Great powers]] fear each other, thus compete for power and dominance, in the belief that this will ensure safety.&lt;ref&gt;[[John J. Mearsheimer]], ''[[The Tragedy of Great Power Politics]]'', WW Norton, 2003, Preface&lt;/ref&gt;

'Cycle of violence' is also used more generally to describe any long-term factional dispute within a nation in which [[tit-for-tat]] acts of aggression occur frequently, as for example in  [[Argentina]] in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ervin Staub]],
''The Roots of Evil'', Cambridge UP, 1989, p281&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Lebanon]] and [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronnie Miller, ''From Lebanon to Intifada'', University Press of America, 1991, p104&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David A. Bright''' (June 29, 1957 – July 8, 2006) was a professional [[wreck diving|wreck diver]].{{clarify|reason=what is a professional wreck diver?|date=February 2018}} He was the president of the [[Nautical Research Group]], which he founded in 2003, and an avid contributor to documentaries on shipwrecks.

== Early life ==
Bright was born in [[Niagara Falls, New York]] in 1957.&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |date=2008-06-12 |title=The Sinking of the Andrea Doria: David A. Bright |publisher=[[PBS]] |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/features/andrea-doria/david-a-bright/149/ |accessdate=2013-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was on his school's swimming team and one of his coaches asked if he would be interested in taking [[Scuba diving|scuba]] lessons. He became a certified scuba diver at 13 years of age and started diving around the New York and Canadian areas. He received two bachelor's degrees in [[biology]] and [[German Language|German]], and two years later got a masters in [[Physiology]], all from [[Penn State]].&lt;ref name=psuBio&gt;{{cite web |author=Bright, Heather |date=2009 |title=Bright, David Alexander |publisher=[[Pennsylvania State University]] |url=http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Bright__David.html |accessdate=2013-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diving career==
After working for pharmaceutical companies, including [[Pfizer]], Bright returned to diving full-time.  He began searching famous wrecks like {{RMS|Titanic}}, {{RMS|Empress of Ireland|1906|6}}, {{USS|Monitor}}, and {{SS|Andrea Doria}}. His findings helped him get into many documentaries about shipwrecks.  He was a member of the [[Explorers Club]], the [[Marine Technology Society]], [[American Academy of Underwater Sciences]], [[North American Society for Oceanic History]], [[Maritime Archaeological and Historical Society]] and the Pennsylvania State University Eberly College of Science Alumni Board of Directors.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt;

== ''Andrea Doria'' ==
Bright repeatedly dived on the [[SS Andrea Doria|SS ''Andrea Doria'']] shipwreck, near [[Nantucket]], to research the ship's demise. His first expedition to the wreck showed that the [[SS Stockholm|SS ''Stockholm'']] had caused much more damage to the ''Dorea'' than had been originally thought. He kept diving to what many considered the Mount Everest of diving, even after 13 other divers died exploring the wreck. On July 8, 2006, while diving to determine if any damage was caused to the keel of the ship, Bright suffered from [[decompression sickness]] and went into cardiac arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Associated Press |title=Obituaries in the news: David Bright |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/ae/movies/s_461440.html |date=2006-07-11 |accessdate=2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was pronounced dead at [[Cape Cod Hospital]].&lt;ref name=psuBio/&gt;

'''Ahmed Jaber Ali al-Qattan''' ({{lang-ar|أحمد جابر علي القطّان}}) was a 16 or 17-year-old Bahraini who died in a hospital on 6 October 2011 after reportedly being hit in the chest, abdomen and upper limb by [[Shotgun shell#Birdshot|bird pellet gunshots]] fired by Bahraini security forces&lt;ref name="BNA 7.10.2011"&gt;{{cite news | author=[[Staff writer]] | title = Immediate Investigation into Ahmed Al Jaber's Death Ordered | date=7 October 2011 | publisher=[[Bahrain News Agency]] | url = http://www.bna.bh/portal/en/news/475660 | accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Bahraini uprising (2011–present)]]. Several human rights organizations in [[Bahrain]] believe that the use of birdshot against humans is banned under international law, while the Ministry of Interior disagrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |date=4 February 2011 |title=Assaults against Children in Bahrain Continues: Firing a Shot at a Child outside his Home |url=http://www.bahrainrights.org/en/node/3719 |publisher=[[Bahrain Centre for Human Rights]] |accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=28 July 2010 |title=Outrage over MP's call to use live rounds on rioters |newspaper=[[Gulf Daily News]] |url=http://gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=283276 |accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/2818/news/read/431110/1.html |date=25 May 2010 |title=حقوق الإنسان": السلاح يُستخدم لصيد الطيور ويضر بالبشر" |newspaper=[[Alwasat (Bahraini newspaper)|Alwasat]] |accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Interior stated that there was a gathering of 20 people in [[Abu Saiba]] who blocked the roads and police men intervened to disperse them as authorized.&lt;ref name="BNA1"&gt;{{cite news | author=[[Staff writer]] | title = تصريح مدير عام مديرية شرطة المحافظة الشمالية حول وفاة أحمد جابر | date=7 October 2011 | publisher=[[Bahrain News Agency]] | url = http://www.bna.bh/portal/news/475651 | accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activists, however, began a series of large protests after his funeral.

==Background==
{{Further|Bahraini uprising (2011–present)}}
As part of a string of [[Arab Spring|protests]] that occurred across the Arab World following the self-immolation and eventual death of [[Mohammed Bouazizi]] in [[2010-2011 Tunisian protests|Tunisia]], the mostly [[Shia]] population of Bahrain took to the streets demanding greater freedoms.&lt;ref name="JazeeraBah14Feb"&gt;{{cite news | author=[[Staff writer]] | title = Bahrain Activists in 'Day of Rage'&amp;nbsp;– Anti-Government Protests in Shia Villages Around the Capital Leave Several People Injured and One Person Reported Dead | date=14 February 2011 | publisher=[[Al-Jazeera English]] | url = http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/2011214925802473.html | accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was seen as potentially destabilising to the [[Sunni]]-led regime of Bahrain, following which a brutal government crackdown led to widespread suppressions of the Shia people across many sectors,&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Cockburn|Cockburn, Patrick]] (18 March 2011).  [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/the-footage-that-reveals-the-brutal-truth-about-bahrains-crackdown-2245364.html "The Footage That Reveals the Brutal Truth About Bahrain's Crackdown&amp;nbsp;– Seven Protest Leaders Arrested as Video Clip Highlights Regime's Ruthless Grip on Power"].

Retrieved 20 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; especially the medical field after the invasion of Bahrain by [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] soldiers led by Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="BBCBahr15Mar"&gt;{{cite news | title = Bahrain King Declares State of Emergency after Protests | author=[[Staff writer]] | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12745608 |publisher=[[BBC News]]  | date=15 March 2011 | accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bahraini government also hired Pakistani [[mercenary|mercenaries]] to maintain security against the protesters, however, lesser intermittent protests continued.&lt;ref name="Tribune 17.2.2011"&gt;{{cite news | author=Nadir Hassan | title = Meddling in Bahrain’s internal affairs | date=17 March 2011 | publisher=[[The Express Tribune]] | url = http://tribune.com.pk/story/133492/meddling-in-bahrains-internal-affairs/ | accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Al Wefaq]] opposition party and Bahrain Centre for Human Rights al-Qattan was 16; the government put his age at 17.&lt;ref name="CNN 8.10.2011"&gt;{{cite news | title = Bahrain announces investigation into death of teen protester | date=8 October 2011 | publisher=[[CNN]] | url = http://www.cnn.com/2011/10/07/world/meast/bahrain-protests/index.html?iref=allsearch| accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

A number of protesters took part in a demonstration in [[Abu Saiba]], [[Bahrain]] which started on late night of 6 October. The government's Information Affairs Authority said the area where al-Qattan was in, [[Abu Saiba]], west of [[Manama]], saw clashes that evening. It said youths blocked roads and set fire to rubbish bins and police fired tear gas and sound grenades when they were attacked with rocks and petrol bombs.&lt;ref name="Reuters 7.10.2011"/&gt;

An anonymous witness who was protesting with Ahmed said in an interview with ''[[Bahrain Mirror]]'' (opposition online newspaper): "We were 70 protesters and Ahmed was in the front, we were ambushed by security forces. They were standing only 10 meters away from us, they didn't use tear gas or rubber bullets, they used [[Shotgun shell#Birdshot|bird pellet gunshots]] directly. Ahmed was injured in the chest and another protester who was behind him injured in the abdomen. He was trying to protect protesters behind him, we ran back to hide. Ahmed ran for a short distance then fell, he called his friend "Ahmed, hold me, I want to breathe". Those were his last words". He added: "A young protester was hiding behind a building rushed to Ahmed as he fell and carried him. With other protesters we carried him through farms to avoid being chased by police. At first we didn't know what to do, so I tweeted specific people like [[Al Wefaq]] and some human rights activists. The first to respond was [[Yousef al-Mahafdha]] (member of [[BCHR]]) who contacted some medics. Medics came, but they found no pulse and requested taking Ahmed to a hospital. At Bahrain International hospital (located in [[Jidhafs]] area of the capital, and sits along [[Budaiya]] Highway) medics from the hospital attached medical instruments to Ahmed and after 15 minutes announced that he is dead and asked us to leave fast to avoid arrest. Human rights activist Yousif Al-Mahafdha was the first to announce the death of Ahmed from Bahrain international hospital."&lt;ref name="Bahrain Mirror 8.10.2011"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Staff writer]] |title=الشهيد أحمد القطان: أريد أن أتنفس |date=8 October 2011 |publisher=[[Bahrain Mirror]] |url=http://bhmirror.org/article.php?id=1984&amp;cid=74 |accessdate=8 October 2011 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death, Ahmed's body was moved to Bahrain International hospital where he was initially examined. Later it was moved to [[Salmaniya]] hospital morgue for an autopsy.&lt;ref name="BBC 7.10.2011"&gt;{{cite news | author=[[Staff writer]] | title = Bahrain teenager dies in Manama protests | date=7 October 2011 | publisher=[[BBC]] | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15219991 | accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmed's older brother was told by young male to attend at Bahrain International hospital. At the hospital, without explaining anything to his brother, Ahmed's body was taken to [[Salmaniya]] hospital morgue. For 20 minutes Ahmed's brother was stopped by security forces from getting into the morgue where Ahmed's body was. After a while he tried again, but this time a [[National Security Agency (Bahrain)|National Security Agency]] officer yelled at him. When Ahmed's brother explained that he's only trying to see his brother's body and security shouldn't act this way. The officer responded with "I'm a soldier and I can do whatever I want with you right now if you don't stop attempting to get in". Later, a policeman in civilian clothes spoke to the family. He told them that Ahmed died a natural death, his chest doesn't contain [[Shotgun shell#Birdshot|bird pellet gunshots]] and that his body is completely clean from any injures. Then he asked the family to bring him some of Ahmed's clothes in order to investigate the cause of his death. The family wasn't allowed to see the body until next morning when they received it.&lt;ref name="Bahrain Mirror 8.10.2011"/&gt;

One of the lawyers responded to the family's cries on [[Twitter]] and came along with a lawyer from [[Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry]]. Security forces allowed Al-jeshy and his companion to enter the morgue, where the Public Prosecutor announced that the direct cause of death was due to injury by [[Shotgun shell#Birdshot|bird pellet gunshots]] which went through Ahmed's body into his heart and caused a severe bleeding.&lt;ref name="Bahrain Mirror 8.10.2011"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
At first ministry of interior stated that Ahmed al-Qattan died from severe respiratory and blood flow problems after he was received in hospital without saying what caused this.&lt;ref name="BNA1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters 7.10.2011"&gt;{{cite news | author=Andrew Hammond | title = Bahrain youth dies after clash with police | date=7 October 2011 | publisher=[[Reuters]] | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/07/us-bahrain-youth-idUSTRE7960YS20111007 | accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another statement the ministry stated that they're launching an investigation into the incident "after the report of the medical examiner of the Public Prosecution attributed the death to injury" by [[Shotgun shell#Birdshot|bird pellet gunshots]], but have not described under what circumstance al-Qattan was fatally wounded. The statement said that "legal procedures would be taken according to the results of the investigation."&lt;ref name="MOI 7.10.2011"&gt;{{cite news | author=[[Staff writer]] | title = MOI launches investigation over the death of Bahraini Ahmed Jaber | date=7 October 2011 | publisher=[[Ministry of the Interior (Bahrain)|Bahrain Ministry of Interior]] | url = http://www.policemc.gov.bh/en/news_details.aspx?type=1&amp;articleId=9557 | accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BNA2"&gt;{{cite news | author=[[Staff writer]] | title = وزارة الداخلية :فتح تحقيق لمعرفة ملابسات وفاة أحمد جابر | date=7 October 2011 | publisher=[[Bahrain News Agency]] | url = http://www.bna.bh/portal/news/475655 | accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[Bahrain News Agency]], an official governmental website said that Ahmed died by police birdshot.&lt;ref name="BNA 7.10.2011"/&gt;

On 8 October, two days after Ahmed's death, Nawaf Al-Awadi, the attorney general of the northern governorate stated that police did not use bird pellet gunshots while depressing protesters in [[Abu Saiba]] that night and that the gunshots found in Ahmed's body do not match those used by Ministry of Interior.

Shia activists said al-Qattan died from bird-shot pellets and distributed photos of his body in the morgue.

===Funeral and protests===

The [[funeral procession]] was held afternoon on 7 October. Security forces sat up roadblocks to prevent people from attending the funeral,&lt;ref name="CNN 8.10.2011"/&gt; yet thousands of people attended the funeral which is thought to be one of the largest in months.&lt;ref name="New York Times 7.10.2011"&gt;{{cite news | author=[[J. DAVID GOODMAN]] | title = Bahrain Protesters Clash With Police Near Capital After Teenager’s Funeral | date=7 October 2011 | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/08/world/middleeast/protesters-clash-with-police-in-bahrain.html?_r=2 | accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of mourners who took part in al-Qattan's funeral was over 10,000.&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera 8.10.2011"/&gt; The funeral march moved through the villages of [[Shakhoora]], [[Janusan]] and [[Karrana]], with participants carrying the red and white flags of Bahrain&lt;ref name="New York Times 7.10.2011"/&gt; and chanting, "We will redeem you, Bahrain" and "Down with Hamad," a reference to [[Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa|King Hamad]], whose family, [[Al Khalifa]] has controlled Bahrain for about 230 years. Al-Qattan was to be buried in Shakhoora, his home town.&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera 8.10.2011"&gt;{{cite news | author=[[Staff writer]] | title = Police clash with mourners in Bahrain | date=8 October 2011 | publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] | url = http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/10/20111071362401501.html | accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the funeral hundreds of mourners marched towards [[Burgerland roundabout]] where police forces were present heavily. Police used tear gas, sound grenades and rubber bullets to disperse protesters, injuring no less than 11 protesters, according to activists.&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera 8.10.2011"/&gt; Some protesters threw stones at police.&lt;ref name="CNN 8.10.2011"/&gt; "More injuries were expected, though the chaotic scene around a makeshift clinic near the clashes made it impossible to verify the number," [[Al Jazeera]]'s reporter in Bahrain said.&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera 8.10.2011"/&gt; An [[Al Jazeera]] reporter said he saw four injured protesters, three of them apparently due to rubber bullets and one "suffered a severe facial injury after being hit by a sound grenade."&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera 8.10.2011"/&gt; by night, clashes were over.&lt;ref name="CNN 8.10.2011"/&gt;

Ministry of Interior said "A group of vandals blocked [[Budaiya]] highway after funeral of Ahmed Jaber, which led to interference of security forces to bring situation to normal".&lt;ref name="MOI Twitter 8.10.2011"&gt;{{cite news | author=[[Staff writer]] | title = Group of vandals blocked Budaiya RD after funeral of Ahmed Jaber, this led to interference of security forces to bring situation to normal | date=8 October 2011 | publisher=Bahrain ministry of interior Twitter account | url = https://twitter.com/moi_bahrain/status/122323400294285313 | accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 October, 3 days after Ahmed's funeral, where the final mourning rituals were supposed to be held in Shakhoora, security forces blocked all the roads leading to Shakhoora to prevent people from participating in the mourning rituals. [[Al Jazeera]] reported that security forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets
on tens of protesters who were trying to start a demonstration after the end of mourning rituals and that some protesters were arrested.&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera 11.10.2011"&gt;{{cite news | author=[[Staff writer]] | title = معارضة البحرين: لا لإسقاط النظام | date=11 October 2011 | publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] | url = http://www.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/93CA4EA6-141A-4ABA-AB53-FAD10F6CC370.htm?GoogleStatID=9 | accessdate=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local and international responses==
*Former Al Wefaq MP [[Matar Matar]] said that: "There was a great sense of outrage today. The government claims they will investigate the death and that an independent commission of monitors has been formed, but the injuries and deaths continue to happen. Woman and children must be careful." &lt;ref name="CNN 8.10.2011"/&gt; The party issued a statement reading: "The martyrdom of young Jaber falls under the systematic oppression of those demanding democracy in Bahrain."&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera 8.10.2011"/&gt;
*Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Deputy Director of [[Amnesty International]]’s Middle East and North Africa Programme, said: "The tragic death of Ahmed al-Jaber al-Qatan must be independently investigated and those responsible must be brought to justice. If it is found that security forces have opened fire on peaceful protesters when they were not in a life threatening situation, that would be yet again another unacceptable case of excessive use of force."&lt;ref name="Amnesty 7.10.2011"&gt;{{cite news | author=[[Staff writer]] | title = Death of teenage Bahrain protester must be fully investigated | date=7 October 2011 | publisher=[[Amnesty International]] | url =https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/death-teenage-bahrain-protester-must-be-fully-investigated-2011-10-07 | accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1306">'''Drion's pill''' is a fictitious [[suicide pill]]. It was proposed by [[Huib Drion]], a former Dutch Supreme Court judge and professor of civil law. He argued that people aged 75 or over, living alone, should have the choice of ending their lives in a humane manner. The pill was supposed to be a two-staged pill whereby firstly one pill was taken which would enable another pill to be taken a number of days after the first pill which would then be lethal, but would otherwise be non-lethal. The idea behind this is that a person could act on an impulse and a waiting period seemed sensible.

So far this has been only discussed as a theoretical proposition. No such pill exists in the Netherlands or anywhere else.

[[File:Durham Ox.jpg|thumb|300px|Etching of the Durham Ox by John Boultbee (1753–1812)]]
The '''Durham Ox''' was a [[Cattle#Terminology|steer]] who became famous in the early 19th century for his shape, size and weight. He was an early example of what became the [[Shorthorn]] breed of [[cattle]], and helped establish the standards by which the breed was to be defined.

==History==
The animal was born in March 1796 and was bred by [[Charles Colling]] of Ketton Hall, [[Brafferton, County Durham|Brafferton]] near [[Darlington]] in [[North-East England]].&lt;ref name=DSTimes&gt;{{cite news|title=200 years since the sad demise of the legend that was the Durham Ox|url=http://www.darlingtonandstocktontimes.co.uk/news/1361096.200_years_since_the_sad_demise_of_the_legend_that_was_the_durham_ox/|accessdate=4 September 2012|newspaper=Darlington &amp; Stockton Times|date=27 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colling, together with his brother [[Robert Colling|Robert]], who farmed at nearby [[Barmpton]], was one of the pioneers of the cattle-breeding movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. After a visit in 1784 to [[Robert Bakewell (farmer)|Robert Bakewell]], a successful breeder of [[English_Longhorn|Longhorn cattle]], Colling began using Bakewell's techniques to develop and improve the Shorthorn breed. The animal eventually known as the Durham Ox was the grandson of Colling’s original bull "Hubbach" or "Hubback",&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{cite wikisource|title=Colling, Charles (DNB01)|last=|first=|year=|publisher=|page=|wspage=|scan=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became known as the Ketton Ox when he was exhibited in [[Darlington]] in 1799. He was painted as such at the age of five years in 1801 by George Cuit of [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond]].&lt;ref name=MERL /&gt;

In 1801 the ox was sold to John Day of [[Harmston]], near Lincoln, for £250 (''2010: £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|250|1801|2010|r=-2}}}}'' ).&lt;ref name=DNB /&gt; Day renamed him the Durham Ox and had a carriage specially made to transport him, drawn by four horses. For the next five years the ox toured with him around England and Scotland, exhibited to the public at agricultural fairs and other events. The ox proved extremely popular. For most of 1802 the Durham Ox was on show in London, where it is recorded that in one single day admission fees to see him totalled £97.&lt;ref name=Quinn&gt;{{cite journal|last=Quinn|first=Michael S.|title=Corpulent Cattle and Milk Machines: Nature, Art and the Ideal Type|journal=Society and Animals Journal of Human-Animal Studies|volume=1|issue=2|url=http://www.societyandanimalsforum.org/sa/sa1.2/quinn.html|accessdate=4 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415205802/http://www.societyandanimalsforum.org/sa/sa1.2/quinn.html|archivedate=15 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A dedication accompanying a painting of the ox by [[John Boultbee (artist)|John Boultbee]] (1753–1812) in 1802 gave details of the animal's measurements and estimated its weight as 171 [[stone (weight)|stone]] (1,086&amp;nbsp;kg),&lt;ref name=MERL&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Exhibitions: Livestock in Art|url=http://www.reading.ac.uk/merl/online_exhibitions/livestok/cat_ls.html|work=Museum of English Rural Life|publisher=University of Reading|accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later estimates ran as high as 270 stone (1,715&amp;nbsp;kg), although there may be some confusion, as the stone was not a standardised weight at the time. Whilst his size and weight partially accounts for the admiration he attracted, he was also regarded as a particularly fine and well-proportioned example of his type, at a time when the concept of selective breeding for particular characteristics was just becoming established in agriculture.

On show in [[Oxford]] during February 1807, the ox damaged his hip as he was getting out of his carriage. The injury failed to heal, and on 15 April 1807 he was slaughtered.&lt;ref name=DSTimes /&gt; His weight after death was reported to be 189 stone (1,200&amp;nbsp;kg or 2646 lb)

==In popular culture==
The ox was painted by various artists during his lifetime and pictures of him were reproduced and sold commercially. A coloured engraving after John Boultbee's picture of 1802 sold 2,000 prints in that year alone.&lt;ref name=Quinn /&gt; China and porcelain was produced, decorated with pictures of the ox, including a range of blue and white Staffordshire pottery.&lt;ref name=blue&gt;[http://www.blueandwhite.com/museum.asp?m=Unattributed+Maker&amp;p=Durham+Ox+Series Unattributed maker Durham Ox series china] at the Virtual Museum, www.blueandwhite.com. Retrieved 5 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The impact made by the Durham Ox is reflected in the large number of British pubs named for the creature and a town [[Durham Ox, Victoria|Durham Ox]] in [[State of Victoria|Victoria]], [[Australia]].

'''Dwight Iliff Frye''' (born '''Fry'''; February 22, 1899 – November 7, 1943) was an American stage and screen [[actor]]. He is best known for his neurotic, murderous villains in several classic [[Universal Monsters|Universal horror films]], such as [[Renfield]] in ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' (1931) and Fritz in ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' (1931).&lt;ref name="allmovie.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/artist/dwight-frye-p25213|title=Dwight Frye - Biography, Movie Highlights and Photos - AllMovie|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
{{moresources|section|date=July 2018}}
===Early life and career===
Frye was born in [[Salina, Kansas]] and studied for a career in music and first appeared as a concert pianist.&lt;ref name="allmovie.com"/&gt; In the 1920s, he made his name as a stage actor, often in comedies. In 1924, he played the Son in a production of [[Luigi Pirandello]]'s ''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]''.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=9473|title=Six Characters in Search of an Author|work=[[Internet Broadway Database]]|accessdate=2010-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While he had a few minor roles in silent pictures, with the coming of sound he soon became known for playing villains. Nicknamed "The Man with the Thousand-Watt Stare" and "The Man of a Thousand Deaths", he specialized in the portrayal of mentally unbalanced characters, including his signature role, the madman [[Renfield]] in [[Tod Browning]]'s 1931 version of ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]''. 

Later that same year, he played the [[Igor (character)|hunchbacked assistant Fritz]] in ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]''. Also in 1931, Frye portrayed Wilmer Cook (the "gunsel") in the first film version of [[Dashiell Hammett]]'s ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1931 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]''. He had a featured role in the horror film ''[[The Vampire Bat]]'' (1933) in which he played Herman, a half-wit suspected of being a killer. He had memorable roles in ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]'' (1933) as a reporter, and in ''[[The Crime of Dr. Crespi]]'' (1935).

In ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' (1935), he played Karl. The part was originally much more substantive; many of Frye's additional scenes were part of a subplot but were cut to shorten the running time and appease the censors. One of the deleted scenes was that of Karl killing a Burgomaster, portrayed by [[E. E. Clive]]. Nothing remains of these scenes except still photographs included in a [[Universal Studios]] DVD release of the film. He played similar characters in ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'' (1942) and ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'' (1943); another appearance in ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' (1939) was deleted prior to release. Also in the 1930s, he appeared in two films featuring [[James Cagney]]: ''[[The Doorway to Hell]]'' (1930) (as a hit man) and ''[[Something to Sing About (1937 film)|Something To Sing About]]'' (1937) as a fussy hairdresser.

During the early 1940s, Frye alternated between film roles and appearing on stage in a variety of productions ranging from comedies to musicals, as well as appearing in a [[Dracula (1924 play)|stage version of ''Dracula'']]. During [[World War II]], he made a contribution to the war effort by working nights as a tool designer for [[Lockheed Aircraft]].&lt;ref name="allmovie.com"/&gt;

===Death===
On November 7, 1943, Frye died of a [[heart attack]] while travelling by bus in [[Hollywood]], a few days before he was scheduled to begin filming the biopic ''[[Wilson (1944 film)|Wilson]]''. He is interred in Glendale's [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mank|first1=Gregory William|title=Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff: The Expanded Story of a Haunting Collaboration, with a Complete Filmography of Their Films Together|date=2009|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786454723|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hNtqmyR-MNMC&amp;pg=PA468&amp;dq=%22Dwight+Frye%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiskr7176DVAhUK5oMKHdz8BvgQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Dwight%20Frye%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical tribute===
American rock band [[Alice Cooper (band)|Alice Cooper]] wrote and recorded a tribute track to Dwight Frye entitled "The Ballad of Dwight Fry" (purposefully dropping the last "e") that was included on their 1971 LP ''[[Love It to Death]]''. 

On stage, this song would be portrayed with [[Alice Cooper|Cooper]] in a straitjacket trying to escape, and finally breaking free at the end of the song to strangle the nurse with the ties.

{{Nihongo|'''Ebirah'''|エビラ|Ebira|lead=yes}} is a [[kaiju]] film monster which first appeared in [[Toho]]'s 1966 film ''[[Ebirah, Horror of the Deep]]''. It is one of the two main antagonists of the film. Ebirah has also appeared in ''[[All Monsters Attack]]'' and ''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]''.

==Overview==

===Showa series===
In ''[[Ebirah, Horror of the Deep]]'', a terrorist organization called the Red Bamboo had set up a base of operations on Letchi Island. The giant lobster Ebirah was successfully used to destroy any ship that came too close to the island. The Red Bamboo ships used a special extract from the island’s fruit to protect themselves from Ebirah. When a small group of people stranded on the island saw the mutant dinosaur [[Godzilla]] sleeping in a cave, they woke it so it could fight Ebirah. Godzilla easily won and injured the crustacean with its atomic ray. The day after, a Red Bamboo ship appeared, but they unknowingly used a placebo and not the real fruit extract. Ebirah attacked and tore the ship apart. Godzilla reappeared, but this time, Godzilla pulled off Ebirah’s claws. The wounded Ebirah then fled.

Ebirah was not seen again until it appeared on Monster Island in Ichiro’s dreams in ''[[All Monsters Attack]]''. Its appearance in this film is simply stock footage utilized from ''[[Ebirah, Horror of the Deep]]''. Ebirah was originally going to appear in ''[[Destroy All Monsters]],'' but did not make it to the final draft.

Showa Ebirah is 50 meters (164 feet) tall and weighs 23,000 metric tons (25,353 short tons).

===Millennium series===
In the Millennium era, Ebirah makes an appearance in ''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]'' as one of the many controlled monsters of the [[List of Toho alien races#Godzilla: Final Wars|Xiliens]], a race of extraterrestrial beings. It destroys a factory near Tokyo, and the military forces are sent to destroy it, but are outmatched by the immense crustacean. Instead, the mutant soldiers are called to stop the monster. The mutants successfully defeat Ebirah and are about to kill it, when it disappears in a flash of light. The Xiliens arrive and say that they destroyed the monsters to save Earth. However, it is soon found out that the monsters were in fact controlled by the Xiliens all along.

The [[Gotengo]] then frees Godzilla from the Antarctic so it can fight the controlled monsters. The plan is a success and Godzilla successfully defeats all of the monsters. When it arrives in [[Tokyo Bay]], it faces Ebirah and the Smog Monster [[Hedorah]], the latter of whom was not controlled by the Xilians, simply being at the wrong place at the wrong time. However, they are no match for Godzilla, who blasts them out of the water with its atomic ray and the duo crash into a building, where Ebirah's claw stabs Hedorah's eye. With another blast, Godzilla destroys them both.

Final Wars Ebirah is 30 meters (98 feet) tall, 100 meters (328 feet) long, and weighs 50,000 metric tons (55,115 short tons).

'''Ernesto Cesàro''' (12 March 1859 &amp;ndash; 12 September 1906) was an Italian [[mathematician]] who worked in the field of [[differential geometry]]. He wrote a book, ''Lezione di geometria intrinseca'' (Naples, 1890), on this topic, in which he also describes fractal, spacefilling curves, partly covered by the larger class of [[de Rham curve]]s, but are still known today in his honor as Cesàro curves.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tgmdev.be/curvecesaro.php&lt;/ref&gt; He is known also for his 'averaging' method for the 'Cesàro-summation' of [[divergent series]], known as the [[Cesàro mean]].

==Biography==

After a rather disappointing start of his academic career and a journey through Europe - with the most important stop at [[Liege]], where his older brother was teaching mineralogy at the local university - Ernesto Cesàro graduated from the University of Rome in 1887, while he was already part of the Royal Science Society of Belgium for his numerous works that he had already published.

The following year, he got a mathematics chair at the [[University of Palermo]], which he kept until 1891. He settled in Rome, where he stayed as a professor at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|Sapienza University]] until his accidental death, while trying to rescue his youngest son Manlio from drowning.

== Work ==

Cesàro's main contributions are in the field of differential geometry. ''Lessons of intrinsic geometry'', written in 1894, explains in particular the construction of a [[fractal]] curve. After that, Cesàro also studied the "snowflake curve" of Koch, continuous but not differentiable in all its points. 

Among its other remarkable works, the following are worth to cite: ''Introduction to the mathematical theory of infinitesimal calculus'' (1893), ''[[Algebraic analysis]]'' (1894), ''Elements of infinitesimal calculus'' (1897). He proposes a possible definition of a divergent sequence, known today as "Cesàro's sum," given by the [[Limit of a sequence|limit]] of the [[Average|mean]] of the [[sequence]] partial terms' sum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12472">The '''Health Utilities Index''' (HUI) is a rating scale used to measure general health status and health-related [[Quality of life (healthcare)|quality of life]] (HRQoL).  HUI questionnaires are designed to map onto two classification systems, HUI-2 and HUI-3, capable of measuring 24,000 and 972,000 unique health states, respectively.  HUI classifications measure a range of health domains with examples including sensation, mobility, pain, cognition, ambulation, and emotion.  [[Health utility]] values are commonly produced using HUI as a component of the [[quality-adjusted life year]]s (QALY) calculation used in [[population health]] and [[economics]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.healthutilities.com/|title=Health Utilities Inc. "Leaders in Health-Related Quality of Life Research"|website=www.healthutilities.com|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Originally developed by [[McMaster University]] in Canada, HUI has subsequently evolved and been adapted by Health Utilities Inc.  The purpose of developing HUI was to create a standardized classification system using preference-based scoring.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horsman|first=John|last2=Furlong|first2=William|last3=Feeny|first3=David|last4=Torrance|first4=George|date=2003-10-16|title=The Health Utilities Index (HUI®): concepts, measurement properties and applications|journal=Health and Quality of Life Outcomes|volume=1|pages=54|doi=10.1186/1477-7525-1-54|issn=1477-7525|pmc=293474|pmid=14613568}}&lt;/ref&gt;  HUI was modeled using [[multi-attribute utility]] theory to assess a participants overall health-related quality of life.  HUI was first used to evaluate HRQoL in very-low birth weight infants and adolescent cancer morbidity and has since been taken by thousands of respondents from hundreds of researchers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The attribute categories were decided upon after consulting the general public to rank their order of importance.  Using [[Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem|Von Neumann-Morganstern utility theorem]] to measure a participants health status, health state responses for each attribute are converted to a standardized health utility value which is discussed in detail below.

HUI-2 and HUI-3 questionnaires are proprietary and available for use from Health Utilities Inc. website.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  There is a licensing fee to use the questionnaire and generally costs $3,000 for a single research project use.  Included in the license is a manual describing how to convert survey responses into attribute levels.

== Scale Classification Systems&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ==

=== HUI-2 ===
HUI-2 classification system consists of 7 attributes including sensation, mobility, emotion, cognition, self-care, pain and fertility.  Fertility is not currently used in the HUI-2 questionnaire, but was included historically to account for the effects of infertility on health-related quality of life.  Participants answering each attribute chooses one of three to five response items.  HUI-2 is capable of identifying 24,000 unique health states.  A level 1 response indicates no difficulty or interference while the highest level in each of the attributes corresponds to the lowest possible quality of life.  The following table shows the number of health state levels for each attribute:
{| class="wikitable"

!Sensation
!Mobility

!Pain
!Fertility
|-
|Number of

=== HUI-3 ===
HUI-3 classification system consists of 8 attributes including vision, hearing, speech, ambulation, dexterity, emotion, cognition, and pain.  These attributes range from five or six levels of health states for each attribute.  HUI-3 is capable of identifying 972,000 unique health states.  Consistent with HUI-2, a level 1 response indicates the best possible health state for a given attribute while the highest level indicates the worst possible health state.  The following table show the number of health state levels for each attribute:

=== Differences between HUI-2 and HUI-3 ===
The HUI-3 was created to update the HUI-2 response categories after some of the attribute response items were criticized for not having application to the general population studies.  For example, the HUI-2 emotion attribute focuses on distress and anxiety while HUI-3 emotion focuses on happiness compared to depression.  The HUI-2 pain attribute is primarily concerned with the severity of pain whereas HUI-3 is concerned with frequency and control of pain.  Cognition in HUI-2 focuses on learning while HUI-3 focuses on problem-solving ability of participants.  In addition, sensation in the HUI-2 was broken down into vision, hearing, and speech for HUI-3 update.

== Scoring&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ==

A health state identification can be established for each of the possible health states in the HUI-2 and HUI-3.   A unique health state is described as a sequence of numbers based on the level selected for each attribute.  In HUI-2, perfect health is described as a sequence of seven one's in a row (i.e., 1111111).  HUI health state levels are converted to health utilities using either single-attributes and multi-attributes.  Each defined health state level are assigned a health utility value and used in the formula described below.  The utility values are determined using [[Time-trade-off|time trade-off]] methods which determine preferences for particular health states.

In HUI, utility values range from -0.03 and -0.36 for the HUI-2 and HUI-3, respectively, to 1.00.  A health utility value of 1.00 indicates perfect health while a score of 0.00 indicates death.  To account for the fact that some health states are identified by the general public as being worse than death.  To calculate a health utility score, health states for each response are converted using a look-up table and mathematical formula.  Each attribute and level has a corresponding coefficient value to be input into the formula to calculate health utility.

Each of these coefficients would be entered into the following formula to yield a general health utility:

&lt;math&gt;U=1.06(Sensation*Mobility*Emotion*Cognition*Self-Care*Pain*Fertility)-0.06&lt;/math&gt;

=== HUI-3 ===
For single attribute utility scores in HUI-3, a table published on the Health Utilities Inc. website provides the corresponding health utility score.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  For multi-attribute utility functions, a separate table is used that accounts for an overall health utility based on each of the eight attributes in HUI-3.  The following table provides the associated coefficients used in the health utility formula:

For each health state, the attribute level selected in the response is entered into the following health utility formula:

&lt;math&gt;U = 1.371 (Vision*Hearing*Speech*Ambulation*Dexterity*Emotion*Cognition*Pain)-0.371&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example ===
A health state for a respondent of the following:   
{| class="wikitable"
!
!Vision
!Hearing
!Speech
!Ambulation
!Dexterity
!Emotion
!Cognition
!Pain
|-
|'''Level'''
|1
|2
|2
|3
|2
|3
|2
|4
|}
The corresponding coefficients associated with each attribute and level are entered into the above formula as:

U = 1.371(1*0.95*0.94*0.86*0.95*0.85*0.92*0.77)-0.371

The results of the calculation yields an overall health utility of 0.231.  This value indicates the respondents overall health status on a standardized scale which can be compared to other utilities.

== Current Use ==
Since its development, HUI classification systems have been used extensively in clinical studies.  HUI-2 and HUI-3 are used to elicit health status score from respondents which are converted to health utility scores.  Health utility scores are then used in clinical trials to assess quality-adjusted life years as a result of clinical interventions.  HUI has been studied in disease states across the health spectrum including [[cancer]], [[stroke]], and [[mental health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grootendorst|first=Paul|last2=Feeny|first2=David|last3=Furlong|first3=William|date=March 2000|title=Health Utilities Index Mark 3: Evidence of Construct Validity for Stroke and Arthritis in a Population Health Survey|url=|journal=Medical Care|doi=10.1097/00005650-200003000-00006|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramsey|first=Scott D.|last2=Berry|first2=Kristin|last3=Moinpour|first3=Carol|last4=Giedzinska|first4=Antoinette|last5=Andersen|first5=M.

Quality-adjusted life years are calculated by multiplying the number of life years gained by the health utility.  The adjustment accounts for the changes in health-related quality of life for a given health state as a result of treatment.  Common applications include [[cost-effectiveness analysis]] and [[Comparative effectiveness research|comparative-effectiveness]] analysis which are types of economic analysis.  These type of analyses are used to inform decisions about the amount of value a particular treatment provides relative to other treatments at a population level of health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fhs.mcmaster.ca/hug/update.htm|title=HUI Update|website=fhs.mcmaster.ca|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, HUI classification systems have focused on evaluating population health to make macro-level decisions about health care utilization, however,  its use to identify health status of individuals for use in a clinical setting is being considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Furlong|first=William J.|last2=Feeny|first2=David H.|last3=Torrance|first3=George W.|last4=Barr|first4=Ronald D.|date=2001-01-01|title=The Health Utilities Index (HUI®) System for Assessing Health-Related Quality of Life in Clinical Studies|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/hpa/wpaper/200102.html|publisher=Centre for Health Economics and Policy Analysis (CHEPA), McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Validity and Reliability ==
Since its introduction in 1991, HUI questionnaires and classification systems have been translated into 35 different languages and have been used by 300 investigators across 20 different countries around the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Research has demonstrated that HUI provides comparable measures of general health status to the [[SF-36]] and [[EQ-5D]], other well established questionnaires used in this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raat|first=Hein|last2=Bonsel|first2=Gouke J.|last3=Essink-Bot|first3=Marie-Louise|last4=Landgraf|first4=Jeanne M.|last5=Gemke|first5=Reinoud J.B.J.|title=Reliability and validity of comprehensive health status measures in children|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0895435601004115|journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology|volume=55|issue=1|pages=67–76|doi=10.1016/s0895-4356(01)00411-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It stars [[Toni Collette]], [[Alex Wolff]], [[Milly Shapiro]] and [[Gabriel Byrne]] as a family haunted after the death of their secretive grandmother.

''Hereditary'' premiered on January 21, 2018, in the Midnight section at the [[2018 Sundance Film Festival]],&lt;ref name="2018SDFF"&gt;{{cite web|title=A horror thriller filmed in Utah is among the additions to 2018 Sundance Film Festival lineup|url=https://www.sltrib.com/artsliving/movies/2017/12/19/a-horror-thriller-filmed-in-utah-is-among-the-additions-to-2018-sundance-film-festival-line-up/|work=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|date=December 19, 2017|accessdate=January 25, 2018|last=Means |first=Sean P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was theatrically released in the United States on June 8, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/30/hereditary-trailer-film-sundance-toni-collette|title=Hereditary trailer: will this be the year's scariest movie?|author=Guardian staff|date=January 30, 2018|website=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|accessdate=January 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was acclaimed by critics, with Collette's performance receiving particular praise, and was a commercial success, making over $79 million on a $10 million budget to become [[A24 (company)|A24]]'s highest-grossing film worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/oceans-8-satisfying-but-slight/|title=Ocean's 8: Satisfying but Slight|first=Jeff |last=Giles|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|date=June 7, 2018|accessdate=June 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. --&gt;Artist Annie Graham lives with her husband, Steve, their 16-year-old son Peter, and their 13-year-old daughter, Charlie. At the funeral of her secretive mother, Ellen, Annie delivers a [[eulogy]] explaining their fraught relationship. Steve is informed that Ellen's grave has been desecrated, while Annie thinks she sees an apparition of Ellen in her workshop. At a [[support group]] for bereaved, Annie reveals that the rest of her family suffered from [[Mental disorder|mental illness]] that resulted in their deaths.

To attend a party, Peter lies that he is going to a school event, and Annie forces him to take Charlie with him. Unsupervised, Charlie eats cake containing nuts, which she is allergic to, and falls into [[anaphylactic shock]]. As Peter drives her to a hospital, Charlie leans out of the window for air. Peter swerves to avoid a dead animal and Charlie is decapitated by a telephone pole. The family grieves following Charlie's funeral, heightening tensions between Annie and Peter. Peter is plagued by Charlie's presence around the house.

Annie is befriended by a support group member, Joan. Annie tells her she used to [[Sleepwalking|sleepwalk]], and recounts an incident in which she woke up in Peter's bedroom to find herself, Peter, and Charlie covered in paint thinner with a lit match in her hand. Joan teaches Annie to perform a [[séance]] to communicate with Charlie.

Annie wakes from a nightmare and convinces her family to attempt the séance. Objects begin to move and break, terrifying Peter, and Charlie seemingly possesses Annie until Steve douses her with water. Annie suspects that Charlie's spirit has become malevolent. She throws Charlie's sketchbook into the fireplace, but her sleeve also begins to burn. She retrieves it and heads to Joan's apartment for advice, but Joan has vanished.

Annie notices that Joan's welcome mat resembles her mother's craftwork. She goes through her mother's possessions and finds a photo album linking Joan to Ellen, and a book with information about a [[demon]] named [[Paimon]], who wishes to inhabit the body of a male host. In the attic, Annie finds Ellen's decapitated body with strange symbols on the wall written in blood.

At school, Peter becomes confused and slams his head against his desk, breaking his nose. Annie shows Steve her mother's body and the sketchbook. Annie begs Steve to burn the sketchbook so she can sacrifice herself to stop the haunting, but Steve assumes she has gone mad, accusing her of desecrating Ellen's grave herself. When Annie throws the book into the fireplace, Steve bursts into flames instead. Annie becomes possessed.

Peter awakens to find his father's body. Annie chases him into the attic, which is decorated with cult imagery. Levitating, Annie beheads herself with a piano wire as naked [[coven]] members look on. Peter jumps out of the window.&lt;!-- PLEASE DON'T SAY HE DIES OR IS KNOCKED UNCONSCIOUS. This is ambiguous and open for debate. This isn't the place for personal interpretation --&gt; As he lies on the ground, a light enters his body and he wakes up. He follows Annie's levitating corpse into Charlie's treehouse, where Charlie's crowned, decapitated head rests atop a mannequin. Joan, other coven members and the headless corpses of his mother and grandmother bow to him. Joan, addressing him as Charlie, swears an oath to him as Paimon, stating that he has been liberated from his female host, Charlie, and is free to rule over them.

==Production==
During pre-production, writer-director Ari Aster often referred to the film not as a horror film but rather "a tragedy that curdles into a nightmare."&lt;ref name="rs making of"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/features/hereditary-making-a-modern-horror-classic-interview-w520922 |title='Hereditary': Inside the Making of a Modern Horror Classic |first=David |last=Fear |date=June 12, 2018 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=June 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films said to have influenced Aster in the making of ''Hereditary'' include ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'', ''[[Cries &amp; Whispers|Cries and Whispers]]'', ''[[Don't Look Now]]'', ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'', ''[[Ordinary People]]'', and ''[[The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://filmschoolrejects.com/movies-to-watch-hereditary/2/ |title=Watch 'Hereditary', Then Watch These Movies |first=Christopher |last=Campbell |date=June 11, 2018 |website=Film School Rejects |access-date=June 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aster also noted that much of his inspiration for the film came from older Japanese horror films.

The film began shooting in February 2017 in [[Utah]].&lt;ref name="2018SDFF"/&gt; The exteriors of the Graham family house and the tree house were shot in [[Salt Lake City]], and the school scenes were shot in [[West High School (Utah)|West High School]], but all other interiors (including both versions of the treehouse) were built from scratch on a sound stage. Since each of the rooms was built on a stage, walls could be removed to shoot scenes at a much greater distance than a practical location would allow, creating the [[dollhouse]] aesthetic of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.moviemaker.com/archives/news/how-they-did-it-hereditary-ari-aster/ |title=How They Did It: Building Hereditary's Haunted Houses From Scratch Was First-Time Helmer Ari Aster's Living Nightmare |first1=Ari |last1=Aster |first2=Caleb |last2=Hammond |date=June 6, 2018 |website=[[MovieMaker]] |access-date=June 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
On [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 89% based on 298 reviews, and an [[average rating]] of 8.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''Hereditary'' uses its classic setup as the framework for a harrowing, uncommonly unsettling horror film whose cold touch lingers long beyond the closing credits."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hereditary/|title=Hereditary (2018)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=October 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a [[weighted average]] score of 87 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/hereditary|title=Hereditary Reviews|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Peter Travers]] gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars and called it the scariest movie of 2018, saying "it's Collette, giving the performance of her career, who takes us inside Annie's breakdown in flesh and spirit and shatters what's left of our nerves. Her tour de force bristles with provocations that for sure will keep you up nights.

'''Hubert Lederer Dreyfus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|r|aɪ|f|ə|s}}; October 15, 1929 &amp;ndash; April 22, 2017) was an American [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and professor of philosophy at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

His main interests included [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[existentialism]] and the philosophy of both [[psychology]] and [[literature]], as well as the philosophical implications of [[artificial intelligence]]. Dreyfus was known for his exegesis of [[Martin Heidegger]], which critics labeled "Dreydegger".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woessner|first=Martin|title=Heidegger in America|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-51837-6|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dreyfus was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2001 and is a recipient of the Harbison Prize for Outstanding Teaching at UC Berkeley.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter D|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterD.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erasmus University]] awarded Dreyfus an honorary doctorate "for his brilliant and highly influential work in the field of artificial intelligence, and for his equally outstanding contributions to the analysis and interpretation of twentieth century continental philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unm.edu/news/Releases/March22oneal.htm O’NEIL LECTURES IN HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY TO FEATURE CAL-BERKELEY PROFESSOR AT UNM]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eur.nl/english/eur/honorary/awards/ Awards (Erasmus University)]&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of his students have gone on to hold tenured positions in leading American philosophy departments while working on themes related to Heidegger and phenomenology, including [[Taylor Carman]], [[John Haugeland]], [[Sean Dorrance Kelly]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~phildept/kelly.html Sean Dorrance Kelly]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iain Thomson]], and [[Mark Wrathall]].

Dreyfus is featured in [[Tao Ruspoli]]'s film ''[[Being in the World]]''.

==Biography==
Born in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]], to Stanley S. and Irene Lederer Dreyfus, Dreyfus was educated at [[Harvard University]], earning three degrees there, with a BA ''[[summa cum laude]]'' in 1951, an MA in 1952, and a PhD in 1964, under the supervision of [[Dagfinn Føllesdal]] {{Citation needed|reason=Føllesdal would have been 21 when Dreyfus began his PhD|date=March 2018}}. He is considered a leading interpreter of the work of [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], but especially of [[Martin Heidegger]]. He also co-authored ''Michel Foucault: Beyond Structuralism and Hermeneutics'', translated Merleau-Ponty's ''Sense and Non-Sense'', and authored the controversial 1972 book ''[[What Computers Can't Do]]'', revised first in 1979, and then again in 1992 with a new introduction as ''[[What Computers Still Can't Do]]''.

Dr. Dreyfus was the recipient of a Fulbright grant to Belgium and did research on philosophy at the [https://hiw.kuleuven.be/hua Husserl Archives] (University of Louvain/Leuven) for his doctoral thesis (October 1956 until July 1957). While spending most of his teaching career at Berkeley, Dreyfus also taught at [[Brandeis University]] (1957 to 1959), the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (from 1960 to 1968), the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]], [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] and held the Spinoza Chair of Philosophy at the [[University of Amsterdam]] in 2003. His philosophical work has influenced [[Richard Rorty]], [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], [[John Searle]], and his former student [[John Haugeland]], among others. His critical comments on the existential phenomenology and subsequent dialectical philosophy of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] may well have played a significant role in the demise of Sartre's influence on recent thought.

In 1965, while teaching at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], Dreyfus published "[[Alchemy and Artificial Intelligence]]", an attack on the work of [[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]], two of the leading researchers in the field of [[Artificial Intelligence]]. Dreyfus not only questioned the results they had so far obtained, but he also criticized their basic presupposition (that intelligence consists of the manipulation of physical symbols according to formal rules), and argued that the AI research program was doomed to failure. In 1965, he spent time at the [[Rand Corporation]], while work on artificial intelligence was in progress there. In addition to criticizing artificial intelligence, Dreyfus was well known for making the work of continental philosophers, especially Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Michel Foucault, intelligible to analytically trained philosophers.

Dreyfus died on April 22, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailynous.com/2017/04/24/hubert-dreyfus-1930-2017/ Hubert Dreyfus (1929-2017)]&lt;/ref&gt;

His younger brother, [[Stuart Dreyfus]], earned a PhD in applied mathematics and is a professor of industrial engineering and operations research at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

== Dreyfus' criticism of AI ==
{{Main|Dreyfus' critique of artificial intelligence}}

Dreyfus' critique of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) concerns what he considers to be the four primary assumptions of AI research. The first two assumptions are what he calls the "biological" and "psychological" assumptions. The biological assumption is that the brain is analogous to [[computer hardware]] and the mind is analogous to computer [[software]]. The psychological assumption is that the mind works by performing discrete computations (in the form of [[algorithm]]ic rules) on discrete [[representations]] or [[symbols]].

Dreyfus claims that the plausibility of the psychological assumption rests on two others: the [[epistemology|epistemological]] and [[ontology|ontological]] assumptions.  The epistemological assumption is that all activity (either by animate or inanimate objects) can be formalised (mathematically) in the form of predictive rules or laws. The ontological assumption is that reality consists entirely of a set of mutually independent, atomic (indivisible) facts. It's because of the epistemological assumption that workers in the field argue that [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] is the same as formal rule-following, and it's because of the ontological one that they argue that human knowledge consists entirely of internal representations of reality.

On the basis of these two assumptions, workers in the field claim that [[cognition]] is the manipulation of internal symbols by internal rules, and that, therefore, human behaviour is, to a large extent, context free (see [[contextualism]]). Therefore, a truly [[scientific]] [[psychology]] is possible, which will detail the 'internal' rules of the human mind, in the same way the laws of physics detail the 'external' laws of the physical world.

But it is this key assumption that Dreyfus denies. In other words, he argues that we cannot now (and never will be able to) understand our own behavior ''in the same way'' as we understand objects in, for example, physics or chemistry: that is, by considering ourselves as things whose behaviour can be predicted via 'objective', context free scientific laws. According to Dreyfus, a context-free [[psychology]] is a contradiction in terms.

Dreyfus's arguments against this position are taken from the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] and [[hermeneutical]] tradition (especially the work of [[Martin Heidegger]]). Heidegger argued that, contrary to the [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivist]] views (on which AI has been based), our being is in fact highly context-bound, which is why the two context-free assumptions are false. Dreyfus doesn't deny that we can ''choose to see'' human (or any) activity as being 'law-governed', in the same way that we can ''choose to see'' reality as consisting of indivisible atomic facts ... if we wish. But it is a huge leap from that to state that because we want to or can see things in this way that ''it is therefore an objective fact that they are the case''. In fact, Dreyfus argues that they are ''not'' (necessarily) the case, and that, therefore, any research program that assumes they ''are'' will quickly run into profound theoretical and practical problems. Therefore, the current efforts of workers in the field are doomed to failure.

Dreyfus argues that to get a device or devices with human-like intelligence would require them to have a human-like being-in-the-world and to have bodies more or less like ours, and social acculturation (i.e. a society) more or less like ours. (This view is shared by psychologists in the [[embodied psychology]] (Lakoff and Johnson 1999) and [[distributed cognition]] traditions. His opinions are similar to those of [[robotics]] researchers such as [[Rodney Brooks]] as well as researchers in the field of [[artificial life]].)

[[Daniel Crevier]] writes: "time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of Dreyfus's comments. Had he formulated them less aggressively, constructive actions they suggested might have been taken much earlier."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Webcasting philosophy==
When UC Berkeley and Apple began making a selected number of lecture classes freely available to the public as podcasts beginning around 2006, a recording of Dreyfus teaching a course called "Man, God, and Society in Western Literature - From Gods to God and Back" rose to 58th most popular webcast on iTunes.&lt;ref&gt;http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~hdreyfus/pdf/Los%20Angeles%20Times_%20The%20iPod%20lecture%20circuit.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  These webcasts have attracted the attention of many, including non-academics, to Dreyfus and his subject area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/nov/24/business/fi-podclass24 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Michelle | last=Quinn | title=The iPod lecture circuit | date=24 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kinectimals''''' is a video game for the [[Xbox 360]] that use [[Kinect]], with versions also available for various mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wpcentral.com/windows-phone-exclusive-kinectimals-now-available-ios&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wireless.ign.com/articles/121/1214672p1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109055524/http://wireless.ign.com/articles/121/1214672p1.html |archivedate=January 9, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the game players can interact with virtual animals in a manner akin to pets, gameplay includes activities such as teaching tricks to the animal, guiding the animal around an obstacle course, and free-form play.

The video game is aimed at a young audience, particularly children, and includes eleven different virtual animals all based on wild cats. ''Kinectimals'' was developed by [[Frontier Developments]] and was a launch title for Kinect.

An add-on, ''Kinectimals: Bear Island'', was released as [[downloadable content]] on October 11, 2011, along with ''Kinectimals: Now with Bears!'', a single retail disc that bundles ''Bear Island'' with the base game.&lt;ref name="Kinectimals Now With Bears!"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.destructoid.com/review-kinectimals-now-with-bears-214160.phtml|title=Review: Kinectimals: Now With Bears|last=North|first=Dale|date=October 20, 2011|work=[[Destructoid]]|accessdate=June 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/07/26/run-for-your-lives-kinectimals-now-with-bears-due-this-fall/|title=Run for your lives: 'Kinectimals Now With Bears!' due this fall|last=McElroy|first=Justin|date=July 26, 2011|work=[[Joystiq]]|access-date=June 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes a FAO Schwarz plush with scan tag.

== Gameplay ==
Throughout the game players spend time using the Kinect system to feed, play with, care, and even raise an animal cub. Upon starting the game the player will visit Fur Town, where they will choose one of the 6 initial cubs. As they play the game, more cubs can be unlocked. Throughout the game there are 11 cubs. The cat-lemur fairy, Bumble (voiced by [[Richard Steven Horvitz]]) guides the player through the game. Players can also use the scan tag to unlock new cubs.

''Kinectimals'' has received mostly positive reviews. Video game talk show ''[[Good Game (television series)|Good Game]]''{{'}}s two presenters gave the game a 7 and 7.5 out of 10 saying how it was quite fun and that your animal would give instant feedback as well most younger gamers would love playing it. Initially they said "It has a lot more life, energy and fun to it than something like ''[[EyePet]]'' - there's a lot of sparkle, but I was okay with that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Kinect Round Up Review|credits=Bendixsen 6.5/10, O'Donnell 6/10|network=[[ABC Television]]|airdate=November 29, 2010|season=5|number=42|transcripturl=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/goodgame/stories/s3079641.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Video/board/card games */ In the Japanese version of Castlevania III, Alucard was in fact a vampire thanks to his dad selling his soul in addition to his own to gain more power. Him being a dhampir was the result of a retcon from Symphony of the Night.</comment>

This list covers the many types of '''[[dhampir]]s''' or dhampir-like creatures found in fiction. It does not include any dhampir that originates in folklore or mythology, nor does it include the concept of 'full' vampires.

==Literary==

&lt;!--*****

Guidelines:

Please post in alphabetical order! Once each list gets long enough, feel free to add sub-headings for each letter for easier navigation (see the 'List of fictional vampires' literary section for more reference). Include ranges if not all letters are covered (i.e. X-Z). Unless a character's title is specifically part of their name (i.e. Count von Count of Sesame Street) or Count is used in the name of the character's corresponding Wiki article (i.e. Count Dracula), please refrain from listing the title when adding an entry, but rather place them alphabetically sans titles.

This article is a list, please do not break from the format when adding examples. Each entry's respective articles should provide any explanation if needed, as such there is no reason to post summaries. If you feel a need to justify your entry, include it in comments following your edit so you can alert future editors as to your reasoning without disrupting the flow of the article.

Make sure to always include both the character and the work of fiction the character is from. If it is the case that the character appears in more than one category, make sure to link to the correct page. For example, D from Vampire Hunter D is currently in every category but each fiction link is to the corresponding version's (literary, film, manga, video game, etc.) correct wiki article. If separate articles for medium do not exist, link to the main series or character article.

Thanks.

* [[Split (TV series)#Minor characters|Ardak]] (''[[Split (TV series)|Split]]'')
* [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] (''[[Blade (film)|Blade]]'') – (Technically a dhampir in that his mother was human, although according to all evidence his biological father was also human, his vampirism being 'inherited' when his mother was attacked in the ninth month of her pregnancy)
* [[Connor (Angel)|Connor]] (''[[Angel (TV Series)|Angel]]'')&lt;!--Dhampirs in the broadest sense are children of vampires that are not full vampires themselves, so Connor qualifies despite both parents being vampires. It's merely the re-interpretation of the concept in the Buffy Universe.--&gt;

* Dick (Irwin's dhampir father) (''The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy'')
* Dimitri Belikov (''[[Vampire Academy (film)|Vampire Academy]]'')
* Drak, Jr. (''[[Drak Pack]]'') (cartoon) – Drak can be considered a dhampir since he is the great-great+ nephew of Count Dracula, and seems to be immune to vampire weaknesses.  Proof of this is the fact that he is outside in the sunlight in most episodes.
* James Eastman (''[[Grave of the Vampire]]'') – Leslie Hollander is raped by the vampire Caleb Croft. She gives birth to a son James (last name Eastman after Leslie's boyfriend killed by Croft the same night) he grows to adulthood.  Does not drink blood but eats his steaks raw.  Later when finally confronting Croft, Eastman displays superhuman strength and not only holds his own against Croft, but eventually overcomes him through sheer brute force.

* [[Rayne (BloodRayne)|Rayne]] (''[[BloodRayne (film)|BloodRayne]]'')
* [[List of Twilight characters#Renesmee Cullen|Renesmee Cullen]] (''[[The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2]]'') – A gifted vampire-human hybrid, she can transfer her thoughts and memories to others, eat human food and drink human and animal blood, matures at a very fast rate, and has a dim illumination in sunlight opposed to "sparkling" of regular vampires. Renesmee has all the powers as a regular vampire though they are not as powerful or as prominent, She is the daughter of Edward Cullen and Isabella Cullen (née Swan).
* Rita Veder (''[[Vampire in Brooklyn]]'')
* Roman Godfrey (''Hemlock Grove'') – Roman was born into privilege and friends with the gypsy werewolf Peter Rumancek

Details of the murder motive are sketchy; there are several different accounts of why Dr. Treviño killed his boyfriend, Jesús Castillo Rangel. Rangel and Treviño knew each other since high school and Rangel worked for the doctor. One account reports that the 2 men tangled after Rangel told Treviño that he was leaving him. Another theory was that Rangel refused to pay back money loaned to him by Treviño, which ignited the dispute during which Rangel slashed Treviño with a screwdriver. What’s certain is that Rangel died at the hands of Treviño, and the murder was categorized as a crime of passion. According to the police report filed on the case, Treviño used some kind of anesthetic to sedate Rangel. Then Treviño injected an additional drug into Rangel’s unconscious body and dragged the body into a bathtub, where he slit Rangel’s throat with a scalpel and drained the blood from his body. Treviño then methodically sliced up his victim’s body, chopping it into tiny pieces and stuffing the chopped-up flesh and bones into a box. Treviño drove the box to a relative’s farm and a farmhand helped him bury it, which Treviño said contained medical waste. But the next day, another worker saw the suspicious grave and called the authorities. Two Mexican police officers pretended to be patients and arrested the doctor in his office. Treviño was accused of offering a bribe to the police officers, a payoff that was to include a pharmacy that belonged to his father, as well as promising each officer a new car. Treviño was arrested, tried, and sentenced to death for the murder... After serving 20 years in prison, the doctor’s sentence was commuted, and he was released in 2000. Amazingly, once he was a free man, Treviño continued his medical practice, providing medical care to the poor until he died in 2009. A little bit of good emerged from inside an evil man...  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jason Keel Sweeney''' was a [[construction worker]] from [[Fishtown, Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], who at the age of 16 was [[murder]]ed by four teenagers for his paycheck on May 30, 2003. The perpetrators included a girl he was dating and his best friend since childhood. Due to the manner in which Sweeney was murdered, the ages of the teens involved, and the seeming indifference of the perpetrators, the crime received national media coverage.&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2003-06-25 |title=Manson Echo in Philly Teen Murder Case |url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=125030&amp;page=1 |publisher=[[ABC News]] |website=abcnews.go.com |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131114323/http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=125030&amp;page=1 |archive-date=2011-01-31 |access-date=2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder==
Jason Sweeney had left school and was working for his father, a contractor, on a building project in [[Philadelphia]]. He had recently met a girl he liked, 15-year-old Justina Morley, with whom he had a date on the evening of Friday, May 30, 2003. Unbeknownst to Sweeney, Morley was regularly engaging in sexual relations with two other 16-year-olds, Nicholas Coia and Edward Batzig Jr.&lt;ref name=Ramsland&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramsland|first=Katherine|title=Justina Morley's art of persuasion|url=http://articles.philly.com/2005-03-18/news/25418839_1_psychopaths-jason-sweeney-traits/2|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|location=[[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]|date=2005-03-18|access-date=2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Batzig had been Sweeney's best friend since the fourth grade. Nicholas Coia and his 17-year-old brother, Domenic Coia, had also been friendly with Sweeney, but the brothers later ended the friendship.&lt;ref name=schaffer&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schaffer|first1=Michael Currie|last2=Soteropoulos|first2=Jacqueline|title=In Fishtown, Lives Fatefully Linked: Fiercely Loyal to Each Other, Brothers Guarded Their Own 'Little World'|url=http://articles.philly.com/2003-06-22/news/25448571_1_jason-sweeney-brothers-friends|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|location=[[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]|date=2003-06-22|access-date=2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the promise of sex, Morley lured Sweeney to "The Trails," a wooded area of [[Fishtown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Fishtown]] near the [[Delaware River]], where Batzig and the Coia brothers were lying in wait. Batzig took the first blow, striking Sweeney in the head 4 to 5 times.&lt;ref name=Soteropoulos030105&gt;{{cite news|last=Soteropoulos|first=Jacqueline|title=Jurors hear of teen's final moments|url=http://articles.philly.com/2005-03-01/news/25420338_1_jurors-parochial-school-jason-sweeney|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|location=[[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]|date=2005-03-01|access-date=2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Batzig and the Coia brothers then pummeled Sweeney, primarily on his head and face, with a hatchet, a hammer and a rock until he was dead. Batzig later told a detective how he hit Sweeney with the hatchet face four or five times. Batzig said,  "Jason started begging for his life, but we just kept hitting him."&lt;ref name=Zucchino /&gt; Batzig also said that Sweeney looked at him during the beating and said "Please stop, I'm bleeding," after which Batzig hit Sweeney again with the axe.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} They finished by dropping a boulder rock on the right side of his head.&lt;ref name=killerkidsada&gt;{{cite episode |title=Foul Ball and Framed |series=[[Killer Kids]] |date=2012-11-26 |url=http://www.mylifetime.com/movies/killer-kids/video/full-episodes |network=[[LMN (TV channel)|LMN]] |season=1 (LMN) |number=1 |last=Conroy |first=Jude (Assistant District Attorney)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweeney's head was crushed and the only bone left undamaged was his left cheekbone.&lt;ref name=Soteropoulos61803&gt;{{cite news|last=Soteropoulos|first=Jacqueline|title=Tale of teen's betrayal|url=http://articles.philly.com/2003-06-18/news/25448761_1_penalty-bloody-clothes-jason-sweeney|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|location=[[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]|date=2003-06-18|access-date=2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was identified by a cut on his hand that he sustained at his construction job.{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=May 2016}}

Following Sweeney's murder, the four assailants stole the $500 cash he had earned from work.&lt;ref name=killerkidsada /&gt; Before leaving the crime scene, the Coias, Batzig and Morley shared a group hug and split the money, which they used to buy jewelry and illegal drugs—[[heroin]], [[marijuana]] and [[Xanax]]—and then "partied beyond redemption," according to Domenic.&lt;ref name=Zucchino&gt;{{cite news |last=Zucchino|first=David|title=Slaying of a Teen Leaves City Stunned|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jun/26/nation/na-helter26|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|location=[[Los Angeles, California]]|date=2003-06-26|access-date=2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Soteropoulos112103&gt;{{cite news|last=Soteropoulos|first=Jacqueline|title=Adult trial in Fishtown beating|url=http://articles.philly.com/2003-11-21/news/25461831_1_juvenile-court-adult-court-death-penalty/2|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|location=[[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]|date=2003-11-21|access-date=2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domenic Coia confessed in a court hearing that they were all involved in the murder of Sweeney. The police said the murder was planned days before. Part of the preparation of the murder was listening to the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] song "[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter]]" over forty times, prompting later news coverage to draw a parallel to the [[Charles Manson|Manson family murders]].&lt;ref name=abc /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zucchino /&gt;  Joshua Staab, 18, a friend of Domenic Coia, said that the group had bragged about their plan to kill Sweeney by using Justina Morley as "bait." Staab also said that Batzig knew that Sweeney would have his paycheck earnings on him on the day of the murder. The prosecutor asked Staab about the teens' demeanor after the killing. Staab said, "They seemed pretty fine. In a way, happy."&lt;ref name=Zucchino /&gt;

Although all four teens involved in the murder were drug addicts, they were not high before they murdered Sweeney. In response to a detective's question about whether they were high during the killing, Domenic Coia answered, "No, I was as sober as I am now. It is sick, isn't it?"&lt;ref name=Zucchino /&gt; A detective involved in the case and a forensic psychologist later opined that the killers' motivation went beyond robbery and stemmed from envy and resentment of Sweeney's relative success in life.&lt;ref name=killerkidsexperts&gt;{{cite episode |title=Foul Ball and Framed |series=[[Killer Kids]] |date=2012-11-26 |url=http://www.mylifetime.com/movies/killer-kids/video/full-episodes |network=[[LMN (TV channel)|LMN]] |season=1 (LMN) |number=1 |last1=Skoler |first=Glen, Dr. (Forensic Psychologist)|last2=Reinhold |first2=Richard (Detective, Philadelphia Police Dept.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justina Morley==

Justina Morley claimed that she started smoking marijuana at the age of 10, and shortly thereafter started taking prescription pills and snorting [[cocaine]]. April Frederick, Morley's mother, said her daughter started cutting her wrists at the age of 10. Morley had been hospitalized for threatening [[suicide]] and [[self-mutilation]] in 2002. She was once admitted to [[Friends Hospital]] for cutting her wrists, knees and thighs, taking pills and displaying a suicide poem, which she had penned, on her door. Morley told her mother that she would commit suicide if her mother did not take her out of the hospital; her mother then took her out against the hospital's advice. Morley had also been expelled from public school in the eighth grade, which she then repeated at the private Holy Name of Jesus Catholic school in Fishtown.

A psychiatrist hired by the defense team, William Russell, said the reason Morley began sexual activity at an early age "was an attempt at validation of self-worth". Morley testified that she had sex with both Nicholas Coia and Batzig in exchange for heroin just a few days before they murdered Sweeney.&lt;ref name=Burling&gt;{{cite news|last1=Soteropoulos |first1=Jacqueline | last2=Burling|first2=Stacey|title=Morley's Descent Began at Tender Age |url=http://articles.philly.com/2005-03-20/news/25420402_1_cross-examination-teenage-accomplices-testimony|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]| location=[[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]| date=2005-03-20|accessdate=2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
Justina Morley's attorneys explained to the judge that the girl had suffered through depression, suicide attempts and substance abuse in order to get her a juvenile court trial. Psychiatrist William Russell explained to the court how Morley attempted suicide twice by overdosing on pills only the year before the killing. Morley's attorney argued she was the least culpable and if tried as a juvenile, she could get treatment and live a productive life. The Assistant District Attorney argued that Morley was an important part of the plot in Sweeney's murder and she had treatment before, to no avail. If tried in a [[juvenile court]], Morley could have been free of court supervision by the age of 21. The judge agreed with the prosecution and ordered her to be tried as an adult for murder.&lt;ref name=Soteropoulos112103 /&gt; At that point, Morley pleaded guilty to third-degree murder in exchange for her testimony against other defendants, and was sentenced to  17&amp;nbsp;1/2 to 35 years in prison.&lt;ref name=Soteropoulos030105 /&gt;

Domenic Coia, Nicholas Coia and Edward Batzig Jr. were charged with [[Murder (United States law)|first-degree murder]], [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]], robbery and possessing an instrument of crime. All were tried together as adults. In 2004, prosecutors decided not to seek the death penalty against Batzig and Nicholas Coia, but planned to seek it against Domenic Coia.&lt;ref name=Soteropoulos040110&gt;{{cite news|last=Soteropoulos|first=Jacqueline|title=Teens' Execution Won't Be Sought: Prosecutors Decline to Say Why They Changed Their Strategy About the Trial of Two Defendants in Last Year's Fishtown Murder|url=http://articles.philly.com/2004-01-10/news/25366482_1_death-penalty-prosecutors-juvenile-law-center|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|location=[[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]|date=2004-01-10|access-date=2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the trial, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Roper v. Simmons]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Roper v. Simmons]]'', 543 U.S. 551 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; that defendants under the age of 18 could not be executed.&lt;ref name=lane&gt;{{cite news|last=Lane|first=Charles|title=5-4 Supreme Court Abolishes Juvenile Executions |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A62584-2005Mar1.html|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|date=2005-03-02|access-date=2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Domenic Coia, who was 14 days away from his 18th birthday at the time of the crime, could not receive the death penalty. Therefore, the Coia brothers and Batzig all faced mandatory life sentences without parole if convicted of first-degree murder.&lt;ref name=Soteropoulos030205&gt;{{cite news|last=Soteropoulos|first=Jacqueline|title=Girl describes beating death of Fishtown's Jason Sweeney|url=http://articles.philly.com/2005-03-02/news/25418675_1_death-penalty-key-witness-first-degree-murder/2|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|location=[[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]|date=2005-03-02|access-date=2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Soteropoulos031005&gt;{{cite web|last=Soteropoulos|first=Jacqueline|title=Teen Trio Convicted In Fishtown Murder|url=http://articles.philly.com/2005-03-10/news/25419047_1_prosecutor-and-defense-attorneys-jury-foreman-jury-of-eight-men/2|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|location=[[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]|date=2005-03-10|access-date=2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jailhouse letters of the defendants were read during the trial to understand their behavior and to determine who, if anyone, was the most culpable. Defense counsel for the Coias and Batzig argued that Morley was the instigator and led the boys to commit the murder of Sweeney. In one of her writings to Domenic Coia, she wrote: "So you say I'm manipulative, and yes, I believe I am in ways. I'm persuasively manipulative, and I think I'm pretty good at it, too. I enjoy dragging people along."  She went on to say:  ". . . Tell me you don't enjoy these gullible humans. It's funny how easy it is to persuade them into lies."&lt;ref name=Soteropoulos030305&gt;{{cite news|last=Soteropoulos|first=Jacqueline|title=Fishtown witness attacked on letters|url=http://articles.philly.com/2005-03-03/news/25420987_1_master-manipulator-jailhouse-letter-trial-testimony|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|location=[[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]|date=2005-03-03|access-date=2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also wrote to Domenic Coia, "I'm a cold-blooded [expletive] death-worshiping bitch who survives by feeding off the weak and lonely. I lure them, and then I crush them."&lt;ref name=Soteropoulos031005 /&gt; Expressing no remorse at all in one letter, she stated: "I am guilty. But I still don't feel guilty for anything. . . . I still enjoy my flashbacks. They give me comfort. I love them."&lt;ref name=Soteropoulos030205 /&gt;  However, Morley testified that she did feel remorse for the slaying of Sweeney and that she only wrote such things so that she would be accepted by the Coias and Batzig.&lt;ref name=Soteropoulos030305 /&gt; The prosecution, while acknowledging that Morley's letters showed her to be "a cold-blooded killer", nevertheless used her letters to demonstrate the depravity of the group.&lt;ref name=Soteropoulos031005 /&gt;

The defense attorneys for the Coias and Batzig also contended that their clients, being drug addicts, lacked the intent to kill needed to support a first-degree murder conviction, and at most had committed the lesser crime of [[third-degree murder]]. However, this strategy was undermined by the confessions of the three defendants. Assistant District Attorney Jude Conroy read part of Domenic Coia's confession in court: "We just kept hitting and hitting him. . . . We took Sweeney's wallet and split up the money, and we partied beyond redemption."&lt;ref name=Soteropoulos030105 /&gt; Domenic Coia had also told a detective: "It was like we were all happy [with] what we did."&lt;ref name=Soteropoulos031005 /&gt;

==Verdict and sentencing==
The Coia brothers and Batzig were convicted on charges of first-degree murder, conspiracy, robbery and possession of an instrument of crime. In May 2005, each one was sentenced to mandatory [[life in prison without parole]] for murder, plus 22&amp;nbsp;1/2 to 45 years for conspiracy, robbery and possessing an instrument of crime.

None of the teens showed any remorse or apologized for the murder. Paul Sweeney, the victim's father, addressed Domenic Coia, saying, "Look at me, Domenic, with your evil eyes". Domenic Coia responded, "I never thought I had evil eyes, but I guess I do. And I'm cool." The judge, in denying defense counsel's motion for a sentence that could allow for parole, said: "There is a level of inhumanity that exists in these facts. This was a totally depraved act."&lt;ref name=soteropoulos050705&gt;{{cite web|last=Soteropoulos|first=Jacqueline|title=3 Fishtown teens get life sentences|url=http://articles.philly.com/2005-05-07/news/25439621_1_life-sentences-jason-sweeney-savage-death|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|location=[[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]|date=2005-05-07|access-date=2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resentencing==
In 2012, the Supreme Court in ''[[Miller v. Alabama]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Miller v. Alabama'', 567 U.S. ____ (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; struck down mandatory life without parole sentences for juveniles under 18, holding that the court must consider the individual circumstances of each juvenile defendant in determining sentence — which might still be life without parole if, in the court's judgment, the circumstances warrant it.&lt;ref name=Rovner&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rovner |first=Joshua |date=October 2015 |title=Policy Brief: Juvenile Life Without Parole: An Overview |url=http://sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/jj_Juvenile_Life_Without_Parole.pdf |journal=Briefing Paper |publisher=[[Sentencing Project|The Sentencing Project]] |page=1 |access-date=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{cite news |last=Lee |first=Suevon |date=2012-08-02 |title=Despite Supreme Court Ruling, Many Minors May Stay In Prison For Life |url=https://www.propublica.org/article/despite-supreme-court-ruling-many-minors-may-stay-in-prison-for-life |newspaper=[[ProPublica]] |location=[[New York City]] |access-date=2016-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court left open the question of whether ''Miller'' applied retroactively to trigger resentencing of all juveniles who had already been sentenced, leaving this to the decision of individual state courts and legislatures.&lt;ref name=lee /&gt; In Pennsylvania, where the Coias and Batzig were sentenced, the state supreme court ruled in 2013 not to apply ''Miller'' retroactively, thus upholding the mandatory life sentences of juveniles whose sentences were already final at the time of the Supreme Court ruling.&lt;ref name="lee"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rovner, p.

Batzig]'', No. 131 EAL 2010 (Pa. 2013) (per curiam).&lt;/ref&gt;

At Nicholas Coia's resentencing hearing on February 19, 2015, Common Pleas Judge Sandy L. V. Byrd sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of parole, upholding the original 2005 sentence. Byrd noted, "This is an uncommon case, there are no factors which remove the defendant from the punishment of life in prison without parole," Byrd said. "Not only did he plan the assault, but he participated in the assault which was so violent that Jason Sweeney had to be identified with dental records." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Witt |first=Lara |date=2015-02-20 |title=Man Resentenced to Life Without Parole in the Brutal 2003 Slaying of Fishtown Teen |url=http://articles.philly.com/2015-02-20/news/59343539_1_jason-sweeney-nicholas-coia-edward-batzig-jr |newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |location=[[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] |access-date=2016-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul and Dawn Sweeney, Jason Sweeney's parents, set up the [[Jason Keel Sweeney Foundation]], in memory of their son, to fund a full scholarship for the [[Valley Forge Military School]], the school of their son's dreams.

[[Canonization|Saint]] '''Nicola Saggio''' was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] professed oblate of the [[Minim (religious order)|Order of Minims]].

He was [[beatification|beatified]] on 17 September 1786 and was [[Canonization|canonized]] as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church on 23 November 2014.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Announcement during the consistory of 12 June 12, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Nicola Saggio was born on 6 January 1650 in [[Longobardi, Calabria|Longobardi]], a small town on the [[Tyrrhenian Sea|Tyrrhenian]] coast. His parents were Fulvio Saggio, a farmer, and Aurelia Saggio née Pizzini. He was the first of five children while the twins Antonio and Domenica followed and then Nicola and Muzio. He was [[baptized]] in the names of "Giovanni Battista Clemente"&lt;ref name="santiebeati"&gt;[http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/90628 Santi e Beati]&lt;/ref&gt; on 10 January 1650.

His parents raised him with high&lt;!--"human" was the wrong word, but can't think of what the right word would be--&gt; moral and spiritual values and instilled in him a Christian education.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} He visited the convent of the [[Minim (religious order)|Minims]] which made him desire the religious life as his path in life.

He was famous as a [[catechist]] in Longobardi and in Roman circles. A further change in his spiritual life was recorded in 1683 after a pilgrimage on foot to [[Loreto, Marche|Loreto]] to ask [[God]] – through the intercession of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] – for the liberation of [[Vienna]] from the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]].&lt;ref&gt;P.A. Bellantonio, ''Nicola Saggio. Più in alto delle aquile'', ed. Postulazione generale dei Minimi, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sainthood==
[[File:Fonte battesimale beato Nicola.jpg|thumb|left|170px|The [[baptismal font]] where St. Nicola Saggio was baptized.]]
On 17 March 1771 he was made [[Venerable]] once [[Pope Clement XIV]] confirmed his life of [[heroic virtue]]. [[Pope Pius VI]] presided over the rite of beatification for the late oblate on 17 September 1786 in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] after approving two miracles attributed to his intercession on 2 April 1786. After the beatification he was made the patron of Longobardi (his village).

The third and final miracle for the canonization occurred in 1938 for a mason of Longobardi who fell from a scaffold without sustaining injuries. The diocesan investigation took place between 24 May 2008 and 15 June 2009; the process received the validation of the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] on 11 March 2011 while the consulting medical board approved the miracle on 13 December 2012. Theologians voiced approval on 28 November 2013 while the C.C.S. also assented on 4 March 2014. [[Pope Francis]] canonized him as a saint on 23 November 2014&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; in [[Saint Peter's Square]] after approving the miracle on 3 April 2014.

The [[postulator]] at the time of the canonization was the Rev. Ottavio Laino.

'''Nicolás Remigio Aurelio Avellaneda Silva''' (3 October 1837 &amp;ndash; 24 November 1885) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] politician and journalist, and  [[president of Argentina]] from 1874 to 1880. Avellaneda's main projects while in office were banking and education reform, leading to Argentina's economic growth. The most important events of his government were the [[Conquest of the Desert]] and the transformation of the [[Buenos Aires|City of Buenos Aires]] into a [[federal district]].&lt;ref&gt;Mendelevich, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in [[San Miguel de Tucumán]], his mother moved with him to [[Bolivia]] after the death of his father, [[Marco Avellaneda]], during a revolt against [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]]. He studied law at [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], without graduating. Back at Tucumán he founded ''[[El Eco del Norte]]'', and moved to Buenos Aires in 1857, becoming director of the ''El Nacional'' and editor of ''[[El Comercio de la Plata]]''. He finished his studies at Buenos Aires, meeting [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]]. Sarmiento helped him to become teacher of economy at the [[Universidad de Buenos Aires|University of Buenos Aires]]. He wrote "''Estudio sobre las leyes de tierras públicas''" ({{lang-es|Study of the laws about public lands}}), proposing to give the lands to producers that make production from them. This system, similar to the one employed at the [[United States]], suggested to reduce bureaucracy and pointed that this would allow stable populations and population growth. 

He was a member of the house of representatives in 1859 and Minister of Government of [[Adolfo Alsina]] in the Buenos Aires province in 1866. During Domingo Faustino Sarmiento's presidency, he was Minister of Justice and Education. He implemented the educational [[reform]] that was defining of his government. 

Avellaneda attained the presidency in 1874 but had its legitimacy contested by [[Bartolomé Mitre]] and supported by [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]]. Mitre deployed the army against Avellaneda but was defeated by [[Julio Argentino Roca]]. Mitre was held prisoner and judged by military justice, but Avellaneda indulted him in order to promote pacification. He also included [[Rufino de Elizalde]] and José María Gutiérrez, supporters of Mitre, as members of his cabinet. 

In line with people like [[Juan Bautista Alberdi|Alberdi]] or Sarmiento, who thought that European immigration was crucial to the Argentine development, he promoted the "Avellaneda law" that allowed European farmers ease to get terrains. The immigration numbers were doubled in a few years. 

Having won the revolution and bringing peace to the country, Avellaneda faced the serious economic crisis, centering his efforts on the control of the land with the [[Conquest of the Desert]] and expanding the railroads, the cereal and meat exports, and the European immigration, specially to [[Patagonia]]. During his presidency, the [[economy of Argentina]] was seriously affected by the [[Long Depression|European crisis]] putting the country on the edge of debt default. Deciding to take Argentina from its debts, he said that "[...]there are two million Argentines who would economize even to their hunger and thirst to fulfill the promises of our public commitments in the foreign markets".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elhistoriador.com.ar/biografias/a/avellaneda.php El Historiador] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reduced the budget and applied a weak protectionism. The crisis was eventually fixed with the growing exports of refrigerated meat to Europe, a new developing industrial method of the time. 

A prolific writer, his works have been published in 12 volumes.

Aged 37, he was the youngest Argentine president ever elected.&lt;ref&gt;Mendelevich, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; He had served in the [[Argentine Senate]] for five months in 1874 and returned to the Senate in 1883 until his death. He died on a ship returning from medical treatment in [[France]].

'''Old Hannibal''' (c. 1800 - May 7, 1865) was a famous 19th century Asiatic elephant that was part of [[Isaac A. Van Amburgh]]'s menagerie.

==History==

Hannibal was brought to the United States as early as 1824 according to early sources,&lt;ref name="boston1"&gt;(22 June 1901). [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2249&amp;dat=19010622&amp;id=BZY-AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sVkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4884,2896812 Answers], ''[[Boston Evening Transcript]]''&lt;/ref&gt; but at least by 1831. He was first called "Timour the Tartar" and renamed by Raymond, Weeks &amp; Co. in 1833 as "War Elephant Hannibal".&lt;ref name="quilt"&gt;Kogan, Lee. [http://issuu.com/american_folk_art_museum/docs/folkart_30_3_fall2005/80 Quilt Connection], ''Folk Art'', p. 78-79 (Fall 2005) (article includes history of Hannibal as part of discussing a quilt with a square depicting Hannibal and his trainer from 1851-63, B. Frank Thomas)&lt;/ref&gt;

He was known for having "fits of fury",&lt;ref name="brief"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KmYXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A Brief Biographical Sketch of I.A. Van Amburgh], pp. 25-28 (1860)&lt;/ref&gt; and reportedly killed several people.&lt;ref name="boston1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1882one"&gt;(18 January 1882). [http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85053157/1882-01-18/ed-1/seq-6/ Crazy Elephants], ''The River Press''&lt;/ref&gt;  Around 1839, he engaged in a fight with Columbus, another huge elephant, in [[Algiers, New Orleans]]; Columbus also killed two men that day.&lt;ref name="colum1"&gt;[http://www.circushistory.org/Bandwagon/bw-1954Apr.htm A Circus Remembrance], ''Bandwagon'' (April–May 1954) (running story from 1869 edition of ''Cincinnati Chronicle'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="colum2"&gt;Oswandel, J. Jacob.

[https://hsp.org/blogs/hidden-histories/lions-tigers-bears-o-my-no-rampaging-elephants-an-african-rhinos-escape-to-freedom-during-the-civil 'Lions &amp; Tigers &amp; Bears, O My?' NO: Rampaging Elephants &amp; an African Rhino's Escape to Freedom during the Civil War!], Historical Society of Pennsylvania, Hidden History Blog&lt;/ref&gt;  And in November 1859, he caused a scene when he briefly escaped from captivity in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]], injuring one man and freeing other animals from their cages on his way.&lt;ref name="free1"&gt;(5 November 1859). [http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/1859-11-05/ed-1/seq-2/ Tremendous Excitement  - An Elephant Loose in the Streets], ''[[The Sun (New York)]]'', p. 2, col. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 1862, he killed a "partially deranged" man who irritated him in [[Caldwell, Ohio]], whereupon Van Amburgh had his tusks sawn off.&lt;ref name="1862inc"&gt;(18 October 1862).

One winter, Hannibal was wintered next to "Queen Anne", a female elephant from a different traveling circus unit, and it was said to be "a case of love at first sight," with mutual affection displayed between the elephants all winter.  Hannibal became very depressed when they were parted in the spring, refusing to eat for eleven days (drinking only water and whiskey), and on the next day briefly escaping his fastenings in a rage.&lt;ref name="nance1"&gt;Nance, Susan.

==Death==

Hannibal died, perhaps from eating poison laurel, in Centerville, [[Bedford County, Pennsylvania]] (located in [[Cumberland Valley Township, Bedford County, Pennsylvania|Cumberland Valley Township]]),&lt;ref name="old1"&gt;(22 December 1910). [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19101222&amp;id=rxUbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3EgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4528,5442163 Most Famous Elephants of Captivity - "Old Hannibal" Most Perfect Specimen of Species Ever Exhibited, Was in Class By Himself], ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]''&lt;/ref&gt; on May 7, 1865.

[https://www.nytimes.com/1865/06/02/news/coroners-inquests.html Death of the Elephant Hannibal], ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally his skeleton was offered to New York City to be displayed, which was declined.  Hannibal was buried near where he died, but his bones were reportedly exhumed under the direction of H.V. Boyd to be sent to the [[Chicago Medical College]] in 1871, though it is unclear if the bones made it there.&lt;ref name="news"&gt;[http://www.circushistory.org/Query/Query11d.htm Circus History.org - including 1865 news reports], Retrieved 19 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report on Hannibal's death in the ''Bedford Inquirer'' (May 17, 1865):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hannibal was the largest animal ever exhibited on this continent.  His height was eleven feet eight inches, and weight was ascertained to be 15,000 pounds, or seven and one-half tons.  He consumed three hundred pounds of hay, three bushels of oats, and forty-six gallons of water per day.  He was supposed to be in his sixty-fifth year at the time of his death.  For thirty-six years he traversed this continent, at an average of 3,000 miles per year, the greatest curiosity ever exhibited to the wondering millions.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;(27 May 1865).

The '''pileated woodpecker''' (''Dryocopus pileatus'') is a [[woodpecker]] native to [[North America]]. This insectivorous bird is a mostly sedentary inhabitant of [[deciduous]] forests in eastern North America, the [[Great Lakes]], the [[boreal forest]]s of [[Canada]], and parts of the [[Pacific coast]]. It is the second-largest woodpecker on the continent, after the critically endangered — and possibly extinct — [[ivory-billed woodpecker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ivory-Billed Woodpecker, Life History |url= https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Ivory-billed_Woodpecker/lifehistory|website=The Cornell Lab of Ornithology; All About Birds |publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "pileated" refers to the bird's prominent red crest, with the term from the [[Latin]] ''pileatus'' meaning "capped".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/pileated_woodpecker |title= Pileated woodpecker|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:111 Pileated Woodpecker, b.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Plate 111 of the'' [[Birds of America (book)|Birds of America]]'' by [[John James Audubon]], depicting pileated woodpeckers (1 ♀, 3 ♂♂)]]
Adults are {{convert|40|to|49|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, span {{convert|66|to|75|cm|in|abbr=on}} across the wings, and weigh {{convert|250|to|400|g|oz|abbr=on}}, with an average weight of {{convert|300|g|oz|abbr=on}}. Each wing measures {{convert|21.4|to|25.3|cm|in|abbr=on}}, the tail measures {{convert|14.0|to|17.4|cm|in|abbr=on}}, the bill is {{convert|4.1|to|6.0|cm|in|abbr=on}} and the tarsus measures {{convert|3.1| to|3.8|cm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Winkler"&gt;''Woodpeckers: An Identification Guide to the Woodpeckers of the World'' by Hans Winkler, David A. Christie &amp; David Nurney. Houghton Mifflin (1995), {{ISBN|978-0395720431}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are mainly black with a red [[Crest (feathers)|crest]], and have a white line down the sides of the throat. They show white on the wings in flight. The flight of these birds is strong and direct, but undulates in the way characteristic of woodpeckers. Adult males have a red line from the bill to the throat, in adult females these are black.&lt;ref name=NW&gt;[http://www.nhptv.org/NatureWorks/pileatedwoodpecker.htm Pileated Woodpecker], Nature Works&lt;/ref&gt; Two species found in the [[Old World]], the [[White-bellied woodpecker|white-bellied]] and [[black woodpecker]]s, are closely related and occupy the same [[ecological niche]] in their respective ranges that the pileated occupies in North America.&lt;ref name="Winkler"/&gt; The only North American birds of similar plumage and size are the [[ivory-billed woodpecker]] of the [[southeastern United States]] and [[Cuba]], and the related [[imperial woodpecker]] of [[Mexico]]. However, unlike the pileated, both of those species are extremely rare, if not [[List of extinct birds|extinct]]. Most reports of the ivory-billed woodpecker are believed to be erroneous reports of the far more common pileated.

===Subspecies===
Up to four subspecies of pileated woodpeckers have been recognized historically. However, many authors only recognize two subspecies, the southernly ''D. p.'' subsp. ''pileatus'' and the northerly ''D. p.'' subsp. ''abieticola'', and the differences between the other two subspecies other than range are not well described. Generally, pileated woodpeckers follow [[Bergmann's rule]] being smaller and more compact in the south (''D. p.'' subsp. ''pileatus'') and larger in the north (''D. p.'' subsp. ''abieticola''). The ranges of the potential four subspecies are described below.&lt;ref name="Winkler"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prbo.org/calpif/htmldocs/species/conifer/piwoacct.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Southern pileated woodpecker (''D. p.'' subsp. ''pileatus'') – the southeastern U.S., except [[Florida]]
*Northern pileated woodpecker (''D. p.'' subsp. ''abieticola'') – from the [[Canadian Prairies]] provinces east through [[Eastern Canada]] and the northern United States
*Florida pileated woodpecker (''D. p.'' subsp. ''floridanus'') – the [[Florida peninsula]] and [[Florida Keys]]
*Western pileated woodpecker (''D. p.'' subsp. ''picinus'') – western North America

==Distribution and habitat==
Their breeding habitat is forested areas across Canada, the eastern United States, and parts of the [[Pacific]] coast. This bird favors mature forests and heavily wooded parks. They specifically prefer [[mesic habitat]]s with large, mature hardwood trees, often being found in large tracts of forest. However, they also inhabit smaller woodlots as long as they have a scattering of tall trees. Efforts to restore woodland by removing invasive honeysuckle and buckthorn seem to benefit them, as the removal of brush and shrubbery facilitates their foraging on the ground and in the lower stratum.&lt;ref name="garc"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Garcia |first1=Evan |title=More Pileated Woodpeckers: Emerald Ash Borer or Healthier Habitat? |url=https://chicagotonight.wttw.com/2016/04/07/more-pileated-woodpeckers-emerald-ash-borer-or-healthier-habitat |publisher=Chicago Tonight |date = 7 April 2016 |accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavior==
[[File:Pileated Woodpecker male.jpg|thumb|upright|Male drilling in wood]]
These birds mainly eat insects, especially [[carpenter ant]]s and wood-boring beetle larvae. They also eat fruits, nuts, and berries, including [[poison ivy]] berries.&lt;ref&gt;Beal, F.E. 1895. Preliminary report on the food of Woodpeckers. United States Department of Agriculture. Division of Ornithology and Mammalogy. Bulletin No. 7. Government Printing Office. Washington, District of Columbia. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Pileated woodpeckers often chip out large and roughly rectangular holes in trees while searching out insects, especially ant colonies.&lt;ref name=NW/&gt; They also lap up ants by reaching with their long tongues into crevices. They are self-assured on the vertical surfaces of large trees, but can seem awkward while feeding on small branches and vines. Pileated woodpeckers may also forage on or near the ground, especially around fallen, dead trees, which can contain a variety of insect life. They may forage around the sides of human homes or even cars, and can occasionally be attracted to suet-type feeders. Although they are less likely feeder visitors than smaller woodpeckers, pileateds may regularly be attracted to them in areas experiencing harsh winter conditions.

Usually, pileated woodpeckers excavate their large nests in the cavities of dead trees. Woodpeckers make such large holes in dead trees that the holes can cause a small tree to break in half. The roost of a pileated woodpecker usually has multiple entrance holes. Pileated woodpeckers raise their young every year in a hole in a tree. In April, the hole made by the male attracts a female for mating and raising their young. Once the brood is raised, the pileated woodpeckers abandon the hole and do not use it the next year. When abandoned, these holes — made similarly by all woodpeckers — provide good homes in future years for many forest song birds and a wide variety of other animals. Owls and tree-nesting ducks may largely rely on holes made by pileateds in which to lay their nests. Even mammals such as raccoons may use them. Other woodpeckers and smaller birds such as wrens may be attracted to pileated holes to feed on the insects found in them. Ecologically, the entire woodpecker family is important to the well being of many other bird species. The pileated woodpecker also nests in boxes about {{convert|4.6|m|ft|abbr=on}} off the ground.
{{listen|filename=Dryocopus pileatus.ogg|title=call}}
{{listen|filename=Dryocopus pileatus - Pileated Woodpecker - XC71727.ogg|title=display drum (a short burst of 10 taps)}}
A pileated woodpecker pair stays together on its territory all year round and is not migratory. They defend the territory in all seasons, but tolerate floaters during the winter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://canadianbiodiversity.mcgill.ca/english/species/birds/birdpages/dry_pil.htm Pileated Woodpecker], Canadian Biodiversity Web Site&lt;/ref&gt; When clashing with conspecifics, they engage in much chasing, calling, striking with the wings, and jabbing with the bill. Drumming is most commonly to proclaim a territory, and hollow trees are often used to make the most resonant sound possible. The display drum consists of a burst of 11 to 30 taps delivered in less than a second.&lt;ref name="twice"&gt;{{cite web |title=Pileated Woodpecker tapping twice |url= http://www.birds.cornell.edu/ivory/multimedia/sounds/listening/pw |website=Big Woods Conservation Partnership |publisher=Cornell University |date=2018 |accessdate=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pileated woodpeckers have been observed to move to another site if any eggs have fallen out of the nest — a rare habit in birds. The cavity is unlined except for wood chips. Both parents incubate three to five eggs for 12 to 16 days. The average clutch size is four per nest. The young may take a month to fledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://talkaboutwildlife.ca/profile/?s=191 Pileated Woodpecker], Talk about Wildlife {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706210329/http://talkaboutwildlife.ca/profile/?s=191 |date=July 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest known pileated woodpecker was 12 years and 11 months old. Predators at the nest can include [[American marten]]s, [[weasel]]s, [[squirrel]]s, [[rat snake]]s, and [[gray fox]]es. Free-flying adults have fewer predators, but can be taken in some numbers by [[Cooper's hawk]]s, [[northern goshawk]]s, [[red-tailed hawk]]s, [[great horned owl]]s, and [[barred owl]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pileatedwoodpeckercentral.com/information.htm |accessdate=June 20, 2012| title=Pileated Woodpecker |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717065851/http://www.pileatedwoodpeckercentral.com/information.htm |archivedate=July 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status==
The pileated woodpecker occupies a large range and is quite adaptable. Its ability to survive in many wooded habitat types has allowed the species to survive human habitation of North America much better than the more specialized ivory-billed woodpecker. Pileated woodpeckers have a large population size, and despite being nonmigratory, are protected under the U.S. Migratory Bird Act. While the large birds control many insect populations, especially tree beetles, that may otherwise experience outbreaks, some people may consider them harmful if found on their property due to the considerable damage that pileated woodpeckers can do to trees and homes.

'''Pope John Paul I''' ({{lang-la|Ioannes Paulus I|}}; {{lang-it|Giovanni Paolo I}}; born '''Albino Luciani''';{{efn|{{lang-en|Albin Luciani}}}} {{IPA-it|alˈbiːno luˈtʃaːni|lang}}; 17 October 1912{{spaced ndash}}28 September 1978) served as [[Pope]] of the [[Catholic Church]] and sovereign of the [[Vatican City]] from 26 August 1978 to his death 33 days later.  He was the first [[pope]] to have been born in the 20th century.  His reign is among the [[List of shortest-reigning popes|shortest in papal history]], resulting in the most recent [[year of three popes]], the first to occur since 1605. John Paul I remains the most recent Italian-born pope, the last in a succession of such popes that started with [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]] in 1523.

He was declared a [[Servant of God]] by his successor, [[John Paul II]], on 23 November 2003, the first step on the road to sainthood. [[Pope Francis]] confirmed his [[heroic virtue]] on 8 November 2017 and named him as [[Venerable]].

Before the [[papal conclave, August 1978|papal conclave]] that elected him, he expressed his desire not to be elected, telling those close to him that he would decline the papacy if elected, but, upon the cardinals electing him, he felt an obligation to say yes.&lt;ref name=ncr2012&gt;{{cite news |last=Allen |first=John |title=Debunking four myths about John Paul I, the 'Smiling Pope' |url=http://ncronline.org/blogs/all-things-catholic/debunking-four-myths-about-john-paul-i-smiling-pope |work=National Catholic Reporter |accessdate= 28 December 2013 |date=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the first pontiff to have a double name, choosing "John Paul" in honour of his two immediate predecessors, [[John XXIII]] and [[Paul VI]]. He explained that he was indebted to John XXIII and to Paul VI for naming him a bishop and a cardinal, respectively. Furthermore, he was the first pope to add the regnal number "I", designating himself "the First".

His two immediate successors, John Paul II and [[Benedict XVI]], later recalled the warm qualities of the late pontiff in several addresses. In Italy, he is remembered with the appellatives of "Il Papa del Sorriso" (''The Smiling Pope'')&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Raymond &amp; Lauretta|title=The Smiling Pope, The Life &amp; Teaching of John Paul I|work=Our Sunday Visitor Press|date= 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Il Sorriso di Dio" (''The smile of God'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0891862/combined|title=Papa Luciani: Il sorriso di Dio'' (''Pope Luciani: The Smile of God'')''|publisher=Radiotelevisione Italia|date=2006|access-date=21 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024121521/http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0891862/combined#|archive-date=24 October 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}} documentary.&lt;/ref&gt; ''TIME'' magazine and other publications referred to him as ''The September Pope.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,919865,00.html |title=The September Pope|work=Time|date=  9 October 1978|access-date= 3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known in Italy as "Papa Luciani". In his town of birth, [[Canale d'Agordo]], there is a museum that has been made and named in his honour that is dedicated to his life and his brief papacy.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Casa Natale Luciani.jpg|thumb|right|Birthplace of John Paul I]]
[[File:Albino Luciani, 1932.jpg|thumb|140px|left|upright|Luciani as a young priest, 1936]]
Albino Luciani was born on 17 October 1912 in [[Canale d'Agordo|Forno di Canale]] (now Canale d'Agordo) in [[Province of Belluno|Belluno]], a province of the [[Veneto]] region in [[Northern Italy]]. He was the son of Giovanni Luciani (c. 1872–1952), a [[bricklayer]], and Bortola Tancon (c. 1879–1947). Albino was followed by two brothers, Federico (1915–1916) and Edoardo (1917–2008), and a sister, Antonia (1920–2010). He was [[baptism|baptised]] on the day he was born by the [[midwife]] because he was considered to be in danger of death, and the solemn rites of baptism were formalised in the parish church two days later.&lt;ref name=vaticanbio&gt;{{Citation|title =Highlights of the Life of His Holiness John Paul I | publisher =The Holy See | url =http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_i/biography/documents/hf_jp-i_bio_01021997_biography_en.html | accessdate = 29 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luciani was a restless child, in 1922, aged 10, he was awestruck when a [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] friar came to his village to preach the [[Lent]]en sermons. From that moment he decided that he wanted to become a priest and went to his father to ask for his permission. His father agreed and said to him: "I hope that when you become a priest you will be on the side of the workers, for Christ Himself would have been on their side".&lt;ref name="The Life of Albino Luciani"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jpicentenary.org/?page_id=65|title=The Life of Albino Luciani|website=jpicentenary.org|publisher=The Pope John Paul I Association|date=|accessdate=17 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311002457/http://jpicentenary.org/?page_id=65|archive-date=11 March 2016|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luciani entered the [[minor seminary]] of [[Feltre]] in 1923, where his teachers found him "too lively", and later went on to the [[Seminary|major seminary]] of Belluno. During his stay at Belluno, he attempted to join the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] but was denied by the seminary's [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]], Bishop [[Giosuè Cattarossi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yallop, David |date=1985|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xQYuAAAAYAAJ |title=In God's name: an investigation into the murder of Pope John Paul I|page=16}}{{quote|So strongly did the writings of Couwase [Jean Pierre de Caussade] influence him that Luciani began to think very seriously of becoming a Jesuit. He watched as first one, then a second, of his close friends went to the rector, Bishop Giouse Cattarossi, and asked for permission to join the Jesuit order. In both instances the permission was granted to them. Luciani would soon make his decision, and so he went and asked for permission. The bishop considered the request, then responded, "No, three is one too many. You had better stay here.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ordination and teaching career==
[[Holy Orders|Ordained]] a [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] on 7 July 1935, Luciani then served as a [[curate]] in his native Forno de Canale before becoming a professor and the vice-rector of the Belluno seminary in 1937.&lt;ref name=vaticanbio /&gt; Among the different subjects, he taught [[Dogmatic theology|dogmatic]] and [[Ethics in religion|moral theology]], [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] and [[sacred art]].

In 1941, Luciani started to work on a [[Doctorate of Sacred Theology]] from the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]].&lt;ref name=vaticanbio /&gt;  This required at least one year's attendance in Rome. However, the Belluno seminary's superiors wanted him to continue teaching during his doctoral studies. The situation was resolved by a special [[Dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensation]] by [[Pope Pius XII]] on 27 March 1941. His [[thesis]] (''The origin of the human soul according to [[Antonio Rosmini-Serbati|Antonio Rosmini]]'') largely attacked Rosmini's theology and earned him his doctorate ''[[Latin honors|magna cum laude]]''  in 1947.&lt;ref name=vaticanbio /&gt;

In 1947, he was named chancellor to Bishop [[Girolamo Bortignon]], [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|OFM Cap]], of Belluno.&lt;ref name=vaticanbio /&gt;  In 1954, he was named the [[vicar general]] for the Belluno diocese.&lt;ref name=vaticanbio /&gt; Luciani was nominated for the position of Bishop several times but he was passed down each time due to his poor health, stature and his resigned appearance. In 1949, he published a book titled ''Catechesis in crumbs''. This book, his first, was about teaching the truths of the faith in a simple way, directly and comprehensible to all people.

==Episcopate==
[[File:Albino Luciani, 1966.jpg|thumb|145px|right|Luciani in 1966]]
On 15 December 1958, Luciani was appointed [[Bishop of Vittorio Veneto]] by [[Pope John XXIII]]. He received his [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|episcopal consecration]] on the following 27 December from Pope John XXIII himself, with Bishops Bortignon and [[Gioacchino Muccin]] serving as the co-[[consecrator]]s. In his first address to the people of his new diocese, Luciani stated: "I would like to be a bishop who is a teacher and a servant".&lt;ref name="The Life of Albino Luciani"/&gt;

As a bishop, he participated in all the sessions of the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962–1965). In 1958, he had taken ''Humilitas'' (''Humility'') as his episcopal motto.&lt;ref name=vaticanbio /&gt; He took possession of the diocese on 11 January 1959. On 18 April 1962, Luciani issued a pastoral letter, entitled "Notes on the Council", in order to alert the faithful to the structure of the proceedings and the overall purpose of the Council, chiefly, the doctrinal and practical issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albino-luciani.com/index.php?id=43&amp;L=3|title=Biography of John Paul I|publisher=Johannes Paulus I|date=2005|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, he visited [[Burundi]] in East Africa.&lt;ref name="Google Books"&gt;{{Cite book | url =https://books.google.com/?id=lP3Iw8WV_MoC&amp;pg=PA115#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| work =Google Books|title=Modern Heroes of the Church - Leo Knowles |accessdate= 15 February 2014| isbn =9781931709460| last1 =Knowles| first1 =Leo| year =2003}}{{dead link|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1965 and 1969 he faced the [[schism of Montaner]]: almost all the residents of Montaner, a [[frazione]] of [[Sarmede]], decided to renounce [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and embrace the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] religion, because they had great disagreement with their bishop Monsignor Luciani. The people did not agree with Luciani's decision to appoint John Gava as a new priest in 1966 since the people wanted their own choice, rather than the one Luciani had settled on. The people then wanted a compromise: make their choice the parish's vice-rector if not parish priest. But Monsignor Luciani said the small village needed only one priest, and that he was the sole authority on priestly selection. Continually, he recommended new priests, but each was denied by the people. Finally, he was escorted by the police and took the Eucharist from the Montaner church, leaving the church unblessed, and waiting for their next move.

On 15 December 1969, he was appointed as the new [[Patriarch of Venice]] by [[Pope Paul VI]] and he took possession of his new archdiocese on 3 February 1970. On 1 February 1970, he received honorary citizenship of the town of Vittorio Veneto, where he had previously served as its bishop.

===1971 Synod of Bishops===
At the [[Second Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops|Synod of Bishops]] held in Rome in 1971, to which he was personally invited by the pope, Luciani suggested to the bishops assembled that dioceses in countries that were heavily industrialised should relinquish around 1% of all their income to Third World nations to be given "not as alms, but something that is owed. Owed to compensate for the injustices that our consumer-oriented world is committing towards the 'world on the way to development' and to in some way make reparation for social sin, of which we must become aware".&lt;ref name="The Life of Albino Luciani"/&gt;

==Cardinalate==
Pope Paul VI created Luciani the [[Cardinal-Priest]] of [[San Marco (Rome)|San Marco]] in the [[Papal consistory|consistory]] on 5 March 1973.&lt;ref name=vaticanbio /&gt;

During his time as Patriarch of Venice, Luciani clashed with priests who supported the liberalisation of divorce in Italy, eventually suspending some of them.&lt;ref name=ncr2012 /&gt; At the same time, he was opposed to the 1974 referendum restricting divorce after it had been liberalised, feeling that such a move would fail and simply point out a divided Church with declining influence.&lt;ref name=ncr2012 /&gt;

In 1975, Luciani travelled to [[Germany]] in May. Later that year (6–21 November), he visited [[Brazil]] where he met with members of the clergy, including Cardinal [[Aloísio Lorscheider]]. Upon his return to Italy, he suffered an [[embolus]] in his right eye. A few months after that, Luciani also made a visit to [[Fátima, Portugal|Fatima]]. While there, he met with Sister [[Lucia dos Santos]], the surviving visionary of three children who claimed to see apparitions of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] back in 1917, revered under the title of [[Our Lady of Fatima]]. When Cardinal Luciani met Sister Lucia, she referred to him as "Holy Father". This greeting shocked the humble cardinal.&lt;ref name="uscatholic.org"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnMmovQrgbQ| work =YouTube|title=The first years of Albino Luciani: 4° part (the conclave) |accessdate= 1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1976, he published ''[[Illustrissimi]]'' ("To the Illustrious Ones"), a collection of letters penned by him in previous years, whimsically addressed to historical and literary figures such as [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], [[G. K. Chesterton]], [[Maria Theresa of Austria]], [[Saint Teresa of Avila]], [[Goethe]], Figaro, [[Pinocchio]], the [[Pickwick Club]], [[King David]] and Jesus. These letters written in very clear and simple, yet often witty language as a way of relating elements of the Gospel to modern life.

In 1975, he suggested that there be disciplinary punishment for priests who spoke out in favor of the Communist Party or other leftist groups.&lt;ref name="The New Pope: John Paul I"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6JFNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CfsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4319%2C8006207|title=The New Pope: John Paul I|publisher=Lakeland Ledger|date=27 August 1978|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Luciani sold a gold cross and pectoral gold chain that Pope John XXIII had given to him (which once belonged to [[Pope Pius XII]] before him) to raise money for disabled children.&lt;ref name=Herald&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2017/11/09/pope-francis-officially-declares-john-paul-i-venerable/|title=Pope Francis officially declares John Paul I 'venerable'|publisher=Catholic Herald|date=9 November 2017|accessdate=10 November 2017|author=Junno Arocho Esteves}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also urged fellow priests in Venice to sell their valuables to contribute to this cause and as a way for them to live simply and humbly.&lt;ref name="Google Books"/&gt;

As Patriarch of Venice, Luciani would establish family counseling clinics to assist the poor cope with marital, financial and sexual problems. He was seen as a champion of the poor and he even once ordered the sale of gold in churches to provide money to help handicapped children.&lt;ref name="The New Pope: John Paul I"/&gt; He was also against worker priests—those who went to work in the factories and fields to labor with the laity—and he also criticised unions over strikes and workers' demonstrations.

==Papacy==
===Election===
{{Main|Papal conclave, August 1978}}
Pope Paul VI died on 6 August 1978, ending a reign of fifteen years. Luciani had gone to the late pope's funeral and mingled with the crowds who wanted to view the body of the late pope. In a certain moment, he thought he would not reach the body. But finally he was recognised once he had arrived and was then led to another place and was offered a bench to kneel and pray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canonizationpopejohnpaul1.blogspot.com.au/|title=The Cause for Pope John Paul I|date=|publisher=Canonization Pope John Paul I|accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luciani was summoned to Rome for the conclave to elect the new [[pope]]. Luciani was not considered [[papabile]] at the time though mentioned upon occasion in several papers, but a few cardinals approached him with their opinion that he would make a fine pontiff. The electors did not want a Curial figure, as Paul VI had been, but a warm and pastoral figure like Pope John XXIII.

Luciani was elected on the fourth ballot of the [[Papal conclave, August 1978|August 1978]] [[papal conclave]]. Luciani had previously said to his secretary, Father [[Diego Lorenzi]] and to Father [[Prospero Grech]] (later a cardinal himself), that he would decline the papacy if elected, and that he intended to vote for [[Aloísio Cardinal Lorscheider]], whom he met in [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name=ncr2012/&gt; Cardinal [[Jaime Sin]] of the Philippines told him: "You will be the new pope."&lt;ref name="Google Books"/&gt;

[[File:Albino Luciani, 1973 (2).jpg|thumb|left|195px|Pope Paul VI makes Luciani a cardinal in 1973]]
However, when he was asked by Cardinal [[Jean-Marie Villot]] if he accepted his election, Luciani replied, "May God forgive you for what you have done" but accepted election. After his election, when Cardinal Sin paid him homage, the new pope said: "You were a prophet, but my reign will be a short one".&lt;ref name="Google Books"/&gt;  On the balcony of St Peter's Basilica, protodeacon Cardinal [[Pericle Felici]] announced that the cardinals had elected Albino Luciani, Patriarch of Venice, who had chosen the name Pope John Paul I.&lt;ref name="papaluciani.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Gloria C. |last=Molinari|title=The Conclave August 25th-26th, 1978 |url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1978/The-Election-of-Pope-John-Paul-II/12309251197005-5/|website=John Paul I The Smiling Pope|accessdate= 20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that a pope chose a double name. He later explained that the double name was taken to gratefully honour his two immediate predecessors: [[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]], who had named him a bishop, and [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]], who had named him [[Patriarch of Venice]] and [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]].&lt;ref name="papaluciani.com"/&gt; He was also the first pope to designate himself "the First" with the name.&lt;ref&gt;Yallop, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://johnpauli.wordpress.com/2014/08/26/habemus-papam-day-1/|title=Habemus Papam! — Day 1|date=26 August 1978|website=Blogging the John Paul I Papacy|first=Fr. Victor|last= Feltes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ([[Pope Francis]], elected in 2013, also took a previously-unused papal name but chose not to be called "the First".)

In the aftermath of the election, the pope confided to his brother Edoardo that his first thought was to call himself "Pius XIII" in honour of [[Pope Pius XI]], but he gave up on the idea, worried that the traditionalist members of the Church might exploit this choice of regnal name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title =La speranza è aspettare qualcosa di bello dal Signore (di Stefania Falasca) | publisher =30 Giorni| url =http://www.30giorni.it/articoli_id_72_l1.htm|accessdate = 9 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observers have suggested that his selection was a compromise to satisfy rumoured divisions among seemingly rival camps within the [[College of Cardinals]]:&lt;ref name="papaluciani.com"/&gt;

* [[Conservatism|Conservatives]] and [[Roman Curia|Curialists]] supporting the highly regarded Cardinal [[Giuseppe Siri]], who favoured a more conservative interpretation or even reversal of controversial ideas being promoted as "in the spirit of [[Vatican II]]" but which had actually never been discussed at the recent ecumenical council.
* Those who favoured a more liberal interpretation of Vatican II's reforms along with some Italian cardinals who supported Cardinal [[Giovanni Benelli]], who had created some opposition due to alleged "[[autocracy|autocratic]]" tendencies.
* The cardinals within the increasingly international [[College of Cardinals]], beyond the Italians who were experiencing diminished influence, such as Cardinal [[Pope John Paul II|Karol Wojtyla]].&lt;ref name="papaluciani.com" /&gt;

During the days following the conclave, the cardinals were generally elated at the reaction to Pope John Paul I, some of them happily saying that they had elected "God's candidate".&lt;ref name="papaluciani.com" /&gt; [[Argentina|Argentine]] Cardinal [[Eduardo Francisco Pironio]] stated, "We were witnesses of a moral miracle."&lt;ref name="papaluciani.com" /&gt; [[Mother Teresa]], commenting about the new pope, "He has been the greatest gift of God, a sun beam of God's love shining in the darkness of the world."&lt;ref name="papaluciani.com" /&gt; British primate [[Basil Cardinal Hume]] declared: "Once it had happened, it seemed totally and entirely right ... We felt as if our hands were being guided as we wrote his name on the paper".&lt;ref name="Google Books"/&gt;

A dramatic event, soon after the election, occurred when the leader of the delegation from the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], [[Nikodim (Rotov)|Metropolitan Nikodim (Rotov) of Leningrad]], collapsed and died after a ceremony on 5 September 1978. The new pope immediately came over and prayed for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Russian Archbishop Dies During Papal Audience| url  = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&amp;dat=19780906&amp;id=N0wNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Pm0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7076,622971| format =| agency  = [[Associated Press]]| newspaper= [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]| publisher =| date = 6 September 1978| page  = 6| accessdate = 30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church policies===

}}

====Six point plan====
After he became pope he had set six plans down which would dictate his pontificate:

* To renew the church through the policies implemented by Vatican II.
* To revise canon law.
* To remind the church of its duty to preach the Gospel.
* To promote church unity without watering down doctrine.
* To promote dialogue.
* To encourage world peace and social justice.&lt;ref name="Google Books"/&gt;

====Humanising the papacy====
After his election, John Paul I quickly made several decisions that would "humanise" the office of pope, admitting publicly he had turned scarlet when Paul VI placed his stole on Luciani's shoulders while the pontiff visited Venice on 16 September 1972. He was the first modern pope to speak in the singular form, using 'I' instead of the [[Pluralis majestatis|royal ''we'']], though the official records of his speeches were often rewritten in more formal style by aides, who reinstated the royal ''we'' in press releases and in ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]].'' He initially refused to use the ''[[sedia gestatoria]]'' until others convinced him of its need in order to allow himself to be seen by crowds. He was the last pope to use it.&lt;ref name=sedia&gt;{{cite AV media| medium = Television production | language = Italian| title=The last days of Johannes Paulus I (Albino Luciani 1978) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWf2AA3ebbU  |accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first pope to refuse to be crowned. Instead of a coronation, he inaugurated his papacy with a "[[papal inauguration]]" where he received the papal [[pallium]] as the symbol of his position as Bishop of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Briggs| first1=Kenneth A.|title=In the Vatican, a Pope Who Underscores the Shift to Style of Humility|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/14/archives/in-the-vatican-a-pope-who-underscores-the-shift-to-style-of.html |accessdate=5 September 2017|work=New York Times|date=14 November 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral theology===
{{Main|Moral theology of John Paul I}}
The moral theology of John Paul I had been openly debated because of his opinions expressed on a number of issues, particularly birth control. It is debated whether John Paul I was liberal, conservative, or a moderate in matters of church doctrine, thus it is difficult to assess his views.

====Contraception====
It is certain that John Paul I would not have reversed Paul VI's teaching, namely on [[contraception]], since it was a question of sexual ethics and Church doctrine, rather than one of personal opinion. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that John Paul I would not have insisted upon the negative judgment in ''[[Humanae vitae]]'' as aggressively and publicly as John Paul II did. Luciani had mixed feelings in regards to the traditional stance on contraception. In 1968, as Bishop of Vittorio Veneto, he submitted a report to his predecessor as the Patriarch of Venice, [[Giovanni Urbani]], that argued that the contraceptive pill should be permitted. It was agreed on by fellow Veneto bishops and was later submitted to Pope Paul VI.&lt;ref name="John Julius Norwich 2011, p. 445"&gt;John Julius Norwich, ''The Popes'', London, 2011, p. 445.&lt;/ref&gt; When ''[[Humanae vitae]]'' was released, Luciani defended that document. But he seemed to contradict that defence in a letter he wrote to his diocese four days after the release of the encyclical.&lt;ref&gt;Albino Luciani/Giovanni Paolo I, ''Opera Omnia'' (Padua: Edizioni Messagero, 1989), vol. 3, pp. 300–301.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1978, Cardinal Luciani was invited to speak at a Milanese conference to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the encyclical. He refused to speak at the event or even attend it.&lt;ref name="John Julius Norwich 2011, p. 445"/&gt;

Some take a different view, describing that while serving as Patriarch of Venice, "Luciani was intransigent with his upholding of the teaching of the Church and severe with those, who through intellectual pride and disobedience paid no attention to the Church's prohibition of contraception," though while not condoning the sin, he was patient with those who sincerely tried and failed to live up to the Church's teaching."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004" /&gt;

====Abortion====
In his letter to Carlo Goldoni from the book ''[[Illustrissimi]]'', Luciani took a critical perspective of abortion and argued that it violated God's law and that it went against the deepest aspirations of women, profoundly disturbing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Yex2o7Ta48UC|title=Illustrissimi: The Letters of Pope John Paul I|others= Translated by Isabel Quigly|publisher=Gracewing Publishing|year=2001|page=269|isbn=9780852445495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Artificial insemination====
In an interview before the death of Pope Paul VI in 1978 when asked for his reaction to the birth of the first test-tube baby [[Louise Brown]], Luciani expressed concerns about the possibility that artificial insemination could lead to women being used as "baby factories" but he refused to condemn the parents.

It was his view that, "from every side the press is sending its congratulations to the English couple and best wishes to their baby girl. In imitation of God, who desires and loves human life, I too offer my best wishes to the baby girl. As for her parents, I do not have any right to condemn them; subjectively, if they have acted with the right intention and in good faith, they may even obtain great merit before God for what they have decided on and asked the doctors to carry out." Luciani added, "Getting down, however, to the act in itself, and good faith aside, the moral problem which is posed is: is extrauterine fertilization in vitro or in a test tube, licit?... I do not find any valid reasons to deviate from this norm, by declaring licit the separation of the transmission of life from the marriage act."&lt;ref&gt;''Prospettive nel Mondo'', 1 August 1978; Luciani, ''Opera Omnia'', vol. 8, pp. 571–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Divorce====
In 1969, Luciani was cautious of de facto relationships as a lesser evil to divorce. He said that unions like those shouldn't be the same as marriage but he added that "there are, in undeniably pathological family situations, painful cases. To remedy that, some propose a divorce, which, conversely, would aggravate this. But some remedy outside of divorce, you can't really find? Once the legitimate family is protected and made a place of honor, you will not be able to recognize with all appropriate precautions some civil effect to de facto unions."&lt;ref name="Vatican Insider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsofttranslator.com/bv.aspx?ref=SERP&amp;br=ro&amp;mkt=en-AU&amp;dl=en&amp;lp=IT_EN&amp;a=http%3a%2f%2fvaticaninsider.lastampa.it%2fhomepage%2fvaticano%2fdettaglio-articolo%2farticolo%2fluciani-papa-14496%2f|title=Luciani, the meek Pope (in Italian)|publisher=Vatican Insider|date=20 April 2012|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Homosexuality====
In a 1974 interview while he was the Patriarch of Venice, Luciani upheld the traditional line: "A sexuality that is worthy of man must be a part of love for a person of a different sex with the added commitments of fidelity and indissolubility."&lt;ref&gt;Interview with ''Il Gazzettino'', 12 February 1974, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ordination of women====
In a 1975 talk Luciani gave to a group of sisters, he expressed his views on the ordination of women into the priesthood:

{{quote|You will ask: what about ... the priesthood itself? I can say to you: Christ bestowed the pastoral ministry on men alone, on his apostles. Did he mean this to be valid only for a short time, almost as though he made allowances for the prejudice about the inferiority of women prevalent in his time? Or did he intend it to be valid always? Let it be very clear: Christ never accepted the prejudice about the inferiority of women: they are always admirable figures in the Gospels, more so than the apostles themselves. The priesthood, however, is a service given by means of spiritual powers and not a form of superiority. Through the will of Christ, women -- in my judgment -- carry out a different, complementary, and precious service in the church, but they are not "possible priests" ... That does not do wrong to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncronline.org/blogs/all-things-catholic/debunking-four-myths-about-john-paul-i-smiling-pope|title=Debunking four myths about John Paul I, the 'Smiling Pope'|date=2 November 2012|author=John L. Allen|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Communism===
John Paul I reiterated the official views of the church in regards to Marxism and Catholicism being incompatible and believed it to be a "weapon to disobey" the Christian faith. As Patriarch of Venice, he struggled at times with Marxist students who were demanding changes in Venetian policies. He also forbade those factions that were Marxist threatening the faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zenit.org%2Fit%2Farticles%2Falbino-luciani-inedito-seconda-parte&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url|title=Albino Luciani unpublished Part II (in Italian)|date=21 August 2012|publisher=Zenit|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interfaith dialogue===

====Islam====
John Paul I was a friend to the Muslim people and as [[Patriarch of Venice]] said to Catholics that faithful Muslims had the "right to build a mosque" to practice their faith in the archdiocese. In November 1964 he explained the declaration of [[Dignitatis humanae]]: "There are 4,000 Muslims in Rome: they have the right to build a mosque. There is nothing to say: you have to let them do it".&lt;ref name="Vatican Insider"/&gt;

===Universal call to holiness===
Luciani stressed the need throughout his time as Bishop of Vittorio Veneto to answer the [[universal call to holiness]] as was an invitation in the Second Vatican Council. He believed that sainthood was something that all Catholics could achieve if they led a life of service to God. Luciani said that there were no barriers to sainthood and discussed this theme of the council in a homily on 6 January 1962: "We are called by God to be true saints". Luciani stressed the importance of this and said God invites Catholics and obligates them to sainthood. He also said that by professing love for God, Catholics say: "my God I want to be holy, I will strive to be holy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsofttranslator.com/bv.aspx?ref=SERP&amp;br=ro&amp;mkt=en-AU&amp;dl=en&amp;lp=IT_EN&amp;a=http%3a%2f%2fwww.papaluciani.it%2fHumilitas%2f09%2fhumilitas_gennaio09.html|title=The Lord invites and obligates us to holiness (in Italian)|publisher=Humilitas|date=|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mercy===
During his brief pontificate, John Paul I spoke three times on the concept of God's mercy. In his General Audience address on 13 September 1978, the pope said that the entire point of mercy is "to surrender to God" through faith in Him, which goes about "transforming one's life" in the fight against sin, and the pursuit of holiness. The pope continued that "God has so much tenderness for us" in which "He begs me to repent" from sin so as to return to God's embrace. The pope concluded that "the Church too must be good; good to everyone" in its own outreach to the faithful.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|publisher=Holy See|author=Pope John Paul I|date=13 September 1978|accessdate=17 November 2017|title=General Audience|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-i/en/audiences/documents/hf_jp-i_aud_13091978.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Paul I, in his Angelus address on 24 September 1978, spoke about the importance of doing good deeds through charitable and merciful acts in society, as to make the world more just, and to improve the overall conditions of society. The pope elaborated that it was important to "try to be good and to infect others with a goodness imbued with the meekness and love taught by Christ", while seeking to give our all in service to others. The pope further points out Christ's example on the Cross, in which he forgave and excused those who persecuted, referring to it as a sentiment which "would help society so much" if put into constant practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|publisher=Holy See|date=24 September 1978|author=Pope John Paul I|title=Angelus, 24 September 1978|accessdate=17 November 2017|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-i/en/angelus/documents/hf_jp-i_ang_24091978.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pope also spoke about mercy in his address at the General Audience on 27 September 1978, in which he referred to God as "infinite good" capable of providing for our "eternal happiness" in His love for us. John Paul I continued that it may be "difficult to love others; we do not find them likeable, they have offended us and hurt us", though says that forgiveness between brothers and sisters is very important for unity and peace among people. Additionally, the pope referred to the seven corporal and spiritual acts of mercy, which he said acted as a guide for Christians, though highlighting the fact that "the list is not complete and it would be necessary to update it" as times change since global situations change. The pope concluded that justice adds to charity, which is linked to the theme of mercy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|publisher=Holy See|author=Pope John Paul I|date=27 September 1978|accessdate=17 November 2017|title=General Audience|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-i/en/audiences/documents/hf_jp-i_aud_27091978.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opus Dei===
Prior to his election, Luciani wrote an article on 25 July 1978 for Il Gazettino di Venezia analyzing some of the aspects of [[Josemaría Escrivá]]'s teachings of [[Opus Dei]]. He stated that he was more of a radical figure as opposed to other saints who taught about the [[universal call to holiness]]. While others emphasised monastic spirituality applied to lay people, for Escrivá "it is the material work itself which must be turned into prayer and sanctity", thus providing a lay spirituality.&lt;ref name=Luciani&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gabriel.mps.ohio-state.edu/od/opus.see |author=Cardinal Albino Luciani (John Paul I) |work=Opus Dei Files |title=Seeking God Through Everyday Work: A profile of the Founder of Opus Dei, Josemaria Escriva |accessdate=3 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311125047/http://gabriel.mps.ohio-state.edu/od/opus.see |archivedate=11 March 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretation of Vatican II===
Luciani had attended all sessions of the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962–65) while he was the Bishop of Vittorio Veneto. He had hoped that the council would highlight "Christian optimism" in terms of Christ's teachings against the culture of relativism. He denounced a fundamental ignorance of the "basic elements of the faith"—it was this point that he wished to focus on as opposed to secularism throughout the world.

In terms of global interpretation of the council, Luciani wrote: "The physiognomy and structure of the Catholic Church have been determined once and for all by the Lord and cannot be touched. If anything, superstructures can. Things that have not been determined by Christ, but were introduced by popes or councils or the faithful, can be changed, or eliminated today or tomorrow. Yesterday they might have introduced a certain number of dioceses, a certain way to lead missions, to educate priests, they might have chosen to follow certain cultural trends. Well, this can be changed and one can say "the Church that comes out of the Council is still the same as it was yesterday, but renewed". No one can ever say "We have a new Church, different from what it was".

In regards to religious freedom, Luciani wrote about the council's declaration, ''"[[Dignitatis humanae]]"''. In his writings, he said that there is only one true religion that must be followed and no other, affirming that Jesus Christ is the Truth, and that the truth will set one truly free. Though, he said that those that will not accept the one true Catholic Faith, for whatever reason, are indeed free to profess their own religion for various reasons. He makes a clear understanding of true and false liberty. He says that true freedom comes from God, that God makes man free. However, he does continue in repeating the teaching that error does not come from God, and although we are capable or err and sin, and that one who rejects truth cannot be forced to believe it, it is not a God given ''right'' to do error. He continues to say that religious freedom must be freely exercised by the individual. He writes that the choice of religion must be a free choice or else one's faith is not real or because they really believe. So he makes clear that for the purposes of keeping peace and order in a diverse society and accepting the free will of man, the freedom of an individual to profess their religion, within certain bounds, is indeed necessary.

===International travels===
On 12 September 1978, Cardinal [[Mario Casariego y Acevedo]] of [[Guatemala]] invited the pope to visit Guatemala in 1979. The pope was said to have thanked him for the invitation but did not provide a response. The week before this, the pope said he was unable to accept an invitation to the [[Latin American Episcopal Conference]] in [[Puebla]], [[Mexico]] for October due to his schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/50123213/|title=Pope Invited to the New World, but Staying Put for Now|publisher=The Ottawa Journal|date=12 September 1978|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sainthood causes===
No saints were [[Canonization|canonised]] nor people [[Beatification|beatified]] in his brief term on the papal throne, but José Gras y Granollers, Juan Vicente Zengotitabenoga Lausen and Giuseppe Beschin were made [[Servant of God|Servants of God]] during his pontificate on 22 September 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsaints.faithweb.com/year/1943.htm|title=JUAN VICENTE ZENGOTITABENGOA LAUSEN (JUAN VICENTE OF JESUS AND MARY)|date=|publisher=Hagiography Circle|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsaints.faithweb.com/year/1918.htm#Granollers|title=JOSÉ GRAS GRANOLLERS|date=2015|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsaints.faithweb.com/year/1952.htm|title=GIUSEPPE BESCHIN (IGNAZIO)|publisher=Hagiography Circle|date=|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personality===
John Paul I was regarded as a skilled communicator and writer. His book ''[[Illustrissimi]],'' written while he was a cardinal, is a series of letters to a wide collection of historical and fictional persons. Among those still available are his letters to Jesus, King [[David]], Figaro the Barber, Empress [[Maria Theresa]] and [[Pinocchio]]. Others 'written to' included [[Mark Twain]], [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Christopher Marlowe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Gloria C. |last=Molinari |url=http://www.papaluciani.com/eng/teachings/letters/illustrious.htm|title=Letters |website=Papaluciani.com |date=10 September 1999 |accessdate=20 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also well-read, and was known for reading several newspapers each morning, including one from the Veneto region, before beginning his day.&lt;ref name=FD/&gt;

John Paul I impressed people with his personal warmth. There are reports that within the Vatican he was seen as an intellectual lightweight not up to the responsibilities of the papacy, although [[David Yallop]] (''[[In God's Name]]'') says that this is the result of a [[whispering campaign]] by people in the Vatican who were opposed to Luciani's policies. In the words of [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]], "they treated him with condescension"; one senior cleric discussing Luciani said "they have elected [[Peter Sellers]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McCabe|McCabe, Joseph]], [http://www.stanleyhero.com/history/History-of-the-Popes/History-of-the-Popes_9.php ''A History of the Popes'' excerpts from: A History of the Popes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601121637/http://www.stanleyhero.com/history/History-of-the-Popes/History-of-the-Popes_9.php |date=1 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics contrasted his sermons mentioning ''[[Pinocchio]]'' to the learned intellectual discourses of [[Pope Pius XII|Pius XII]] or [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]]. Visitors spoke of his isolation and loneliness and the fact that he was the first pope in decades not to have previously held either a diplomatic role (like [[Pope Pius XI|Pius XI]] and John XXIII) or [[Roman Curia|Curial]] role (like Pius XII and Paul VI) in the Church.

His personal impact, however, was twofold: his image as a warm, gentle and kind man captivated the whole world. This image was immediately formed when he was presented to the crowd in [[St. Peter's Square]] following his election. The warmth of his presence made him a much-loved figure before he even spoke a word. The media in particular fell under his spell. He was a very skilled [[orator]].

According to his aides, he was not the naive idealist his critics made him out to be. Cardinal [[Giuseppe Caprio]], the substitute Papal Secretary of State, said that John Paul I quickly accepted his new role and performed it with confidence.&lt;ref&gt;"We must not be deceived by his smile. He listened, he asked for information, he studied. But once he made a decision, he did not go back on it, unless new facts came to light.... With absolute respect to persons, the Pope had no intentions of deviating from what had been the rule of his life and the direction of his pastoral action: fatherly, yes, but absolutely firm in the guidance of the souls entrusted by God to his care." Quoted in Raymond Seabeck, ''The Smiling Pope, The Life and Teaching of John Paul I'' Our Sunday Visitor Press, 2004, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Paul I had admitted that the prospect of the papacy had daunted him to the point that other cardinals had to encourage him to accept it. He refused to have the millennium-old traditional [[Papal Coronation]] and wear the [[Papal Tiara]].&lt;ref&gt;''Romano Pontifici Eligendo'' (1975) [http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/P6ELECT.HTMPope Paul VI's Apostolic Constitution on the election on the pontiff, Section 92.]&lt;/ref&gt; He instead chose to have a simplified [[Papal Inauguration|Papal Inauguration Mass]]. John Paul I used as his [[motto]] ''[[Humility|Humilitas]]''. In his notable ''Angelus'' of 27 August 1978 (delivered on the first full day of his papacy), he impressed the world with his natural friendliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Angelus Address, Pope John Paul I|publisher=[[Libreria Editrice Vaticana]]|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_i/angelus/documents/hf_jp-i_ang_27081978_en.html|accessdate=28 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sister Margherita Marin, who worked in the Vatican during Luciani's papacy, said in comments made in late 2017 that the pope had admitted the sisters into his apartment chapel for morning Mass, unlike his predecessor Paul VI who had only admitted his secretaries.&lt;ref name=FD&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://nuovavenezia.gelocal.it/venezia/cronaca/2017/12/11/news/suor-margherita-papa-luciani-era-sereno-quando-mori-1.16225896|publisher=La Nuova Venezia|date=11 December 2017|author=Francesco Dal Mas|accessdate=12 December 2017|title=Suor Margherita: "Papa Luciani era sereno quando morì"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marin also said that Luciani would speak the [[Venetian dialect]] with those Venetian sisters to make them more comfortable, and to better interact with them. The religious also noted that the pope's humor was evident to all those who spoke with him, and he would often joke with the sisters when seeing his picture in the papers: "But you see how they got me", in reference to the quality of his picture.

==Death==
[[File:Tomb of pope Johannes Paulus I.jpg|thumb|right|235px|Tomb of John Paul I in the Vatican Grottoes]]
On 29 September 1978, 33 days into his papacy, John Paul I was found dead "lying in his bed, with a book opened beside him, and the reading light on. According to a Vatican doctor, he probably died around 11 p.m [...] of a heart attack" that occurred on 28 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/sep/30/pope-john-paul-1-death-vatican|title=Pope John Paul I dies of heart attack: From the archive, 30 September 1978|journal=The Guardian|date=2013-09-30|last1=Armstrong|first1=George}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Paul I's funeral was held in [[Saint Peter's Square]] on 4 October 1978, celebrated by Cardinal [[Carlo Confalonieri]]. In his [[eulogy]] of the late pope, he described him as a flashing comet who briefly lit up the church. He then was laid to rest in the Vatican grottoes.

It was said that around 10:00 on the night of his death, the pope learned that several young [[neo-Fascists]] had fired upon a group of young people reading ''[[L'Unità]]'', the Communist newspaper, outside one of the party's offices in Rome. One boy was killed while another was seriously wounded. The pope lamented to John Magee, "Even the young are killing each other." He later retired to his room to read [[Thomas à Kempis]]' ''[[The Imitation of Christ]]'' in bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/sep/30/pope-john-paul-1-death-vatican|title=From the archive, 30 September 1978: Pope John Paul I dies of heart attack|journal=The Guardian|date=30 September 2013|accessdate=28 February 2015|last1=Armstrong|first1=George}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several [[Pope John Paul I conspiracy theories|conspiracy speculations related to his death]].

===New revelations===
The journalist and vice-postulator for Luciani's cause of canonization, Stefania Falasca, published a new book in 2017 titled ''Pope Luciani, Chronicle of a Death'', in which she revealed that John Paul I had complained of chest pains hours before his death, and the evening before, but paid no attention to it and ordered that his doctor not be called.&lt;ref name=BDC&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2017/11/06/sainthood-bid-heats-book-debunks-conspiracies-john-paul/|title=As sainthood bid heats up, book debunks conspiracies on John Paul I|date=6 November 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017|author=Inés San Martín}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falasca confirmed, after interviewing the sisters who found him and documents from the [[Vatican Secret Archives]], that Luciani died of a heart attack in late evening hours of 28 September.&lt;ref name=JPIDC&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/new-book-reveals-deatails-of-john-paul-is-death-33420|title=New book reveals details of John Paul I's death|publisher=Catholic News Agency|author=Hannah Brockhaus|date=6 November 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Pietro Parolin]], in his preface for the book, describes the various conspiracies regarding Luciani's death as little more than "noir reconstructions". Parolin further says that the sudden death of the pope inspired a "myriad of theories, suspicions, [and] suppositions" based in opinion rather than in fact.&lt;ref name=BDC/&gt;

Falasca noted the 2009 testimony of Sister Margherita Marin (b. 1941), who was one of the two [[Nun#Distinction between a nun and a religious sister|sister]]s that found the pope dead in his bedroom on the morning of 29 September. John Paul I had made it a practice to have a morning coffee in the sacristy and then go into the chapel to pray before tending to the day's matters.&lt;ref name=MJPI/&gt; Sister Vincenza had noted the pope had not touched the coffee she had left for him in the sacristy at 5:15am (after about ten minutes) and went looking for him but found him dead, and hastily summoned Marin who also went into the room. Marin testified that Luciani's hands were cold, and she was struck by the darkness of his nails.&lt;ref name=BDC/&gt; Sister Vincenza said: "He hasn't come out yet? Why not? and knocked a few more times but heard silence, then opening the door and walking in. Marin remained in the hallway but heard the elder sister say: "Your Holiness, you shouldn't pull these jokes on me" because Sister Vincenza also had heart problems.&lt;ref name=BDC/&gt;&lt;ref name=MJPI/&gt;&lt;ref name=JPIDC/&gt; Marin further testified that original information provided by the Vatican regarding who discovered the pope was wrong, since it had originally been claimed the pope's secretaries Lorenzi and Magee did.&lt;ref name=JPIDC/&gt; Marin testified that "he was in bed with a slight smile" on his face. The reading light over the headboard was still on, with his two pillows under his back propping him up, with his legs outstretched and his arms on top of the bedsheets. Luciani was still in his [[pajamas]] with a few typewritten sheets in his hands. His head was slightly turned to the right and his eyes were partially closed; his glasses rested on his nose.&lt;ref name=MJPI/&gt;

Luciani had suffered a severe pain in his chest for about five minutes around 7:30pm while sitting reciting the vespers in the chapel with Magee before dinner and rejected all suggestions for calling Doctor Renato Buzzonetti. The latter, the book claimed, was informed of that episode after the pope's death.&lt;ref name=JPIDC/&gt; The book also revealed that, prior to the conclave that elected John Paul II, the cardinals had sent a series of written questions to the doctors who had embalmed Luciani either on 10 or 11 October to check if there had been any signs of traumatic injuries, so as to ascertain if he died naturally rather than suspiciously.&lt;ref name=MJPI&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://aleteia.org/2017/11/06/john-paul-is-mysterious-death-now-less-a-mystery/|title=Is the mystery over the death of John Paul I finally solved?|date=6 November 2017|accessdate=7 November 2017|author=Ary Waldir Ramos Diaz|publisher=Aleteia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2017/11/04/pope-john-paul-i-similing-pope-path-sainthood|date=4 November 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017|title=Pope John Paul I, "the smiling pope", is on the path to sainthood|publisher=America Magazine|author=Gerard O'Connell}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Doctor Buzzonetti sent a detailed report to the Cardinal Secretary of State [[Agostino Casaroli]] on 9 October 1979 detailing the episode of pain Luciani suffered was in the upper part of the sternal region.&lt;ref name=MJPI/&gt;

Sister Margherita noted in late 2017 in comments made in Belluno that the pope had made a half-hour phone call in the evening of his death to the Cardinal [[Archbishop of Milan]] [[Giovanni Colombo]] in which he confided to Colombo that he wanted the [[Rector Major of the Salesians|Salesian rector major]] [[Egidio Viganò]] to accept a to-be-announced nomination as Luciani's successor as the Patriarch of Venice.&lt;ref name=FD/&gt;

==Canonization process==
===Diocesan process===
The process for the canonisation for John Paul I formally began in 1990 with the petition by 226 [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] bishops, including four cardinals. The petition was addressed directly to Pope John Paul II.

On 26 August 2002, Bishop Vincenzo Savio announced the start of the preliminary phase to collect documents and testimonies necessary to start the process of [[canonisation]]. On 8 June 2003 the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] gave its assent to the work and on 17 June transferred the forum for the beatification process from Rome to Belluno-Feltre while also declaring the late pope as a [[Servant of God]] after declaring "[[nihil obstat]]" (no objections to the cause). On 23 November, on the [[Feast of Christ the King]], the diocesan process formally opened in the Cathedral Basilica of [[Belluno]] with Cardinal [[José Saraiva Martins]] in charge and presiding over the inauguration.&lt;ref&gt;Congregation for the Causes of Saints, [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/csaints/documents/rc_con_csaints_doc_20031123_papa-luciani_it.html Solemn Opening of the Cause for Canonization of the Servant of God, Albino Luciani, Pope John Paul I] on 23 November 2003.

Page found 13 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The diocesan inquiry for the cause subsequently concluded on 11 November 2006 in [[Belluno]] with all the evidence collected being sent to the C.C.S. which received their validation on 13 June 2008. On 13 June 2008, the Vatican began the "Roman" phase of the beatification process for John Paul I, in which they would assess the documents and witness testimonies collected during the diocesan inquiry.

===Roman phase===
The documents in regards to the cause were supposed to be delivered to the prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, Cardinal [[Angelo Amato]] on 17 October 2012 (the hundred year anniversary of the late pope's birth), in a large [[Positio]] dossier (consisting of a biography and investigation into his virtues) to examine the pros and cons of the cause. This was delayed due to the cause's supporters wanting another check over all the documents. In a mass at Belluno on 20 July 2014, Cardinal [[Tarcisio Bertone]] announced that the cause of beatification was set to advance. The cardinal highlighted that the Positio would be delivered in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/john-paul-is-beatification-cause-may-advance-cardinal-says-99529/|title=John Paul I's beatification cause may advance, cardinal says|publisher=Catholic News Agency|date=24 July 2014|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=search&amp;rurl=translate.google.com.au&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://www.telebelluno.it/wp/13401&amp;usg=ALkJrhhx8jFFm9g0suJgpAv4kg2e5lBSmw|title=Card.

On 27 August 2015, Bishop Giuseppe Andrich announced that John Paul I would be beatified "soon". In a homily delivered during Mass in Canale d'Agordo, Luciani's home town, on the 37th anniversary of his election as Pope, Andrich said Church authorities had concluded the investigation into Luciani's heroic virtues. Following the conclusion of the "Positio" (3652 pages in total), they received several messages affirming personal experience of Luciani's holiness, including a handwritten card from [[Pope Benedict XVI|Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI]]. The testimony of a Pope or former Pope in considering a candidate for sainthood is extremely unusual. Benedict XVI apparently recommended waiving the requirement for miracles in Luciani's case.&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ilmessaggero.it%2FPRIMOPIANO%2FVATICANO%2Fpapa_luciani_beato_ratzinger_miracoli%2Fnotizie%2F1535347.shtml&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url Rome: Pope Luciani soon beatified, also Ratzinger has testified in his favor, but he lacks miracles.] ''Messagiero'', 27 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=search&amp;rurl=translate.google.com.au&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://www.telebelluno.it/wp/13401&amp;sandbox=0&amp;usg=ALkJrhiK6rSgDiq2xImdQ_ikUGAf6klWlg Benedict XVI to witness the beatification of Albino Luciani]. ''Telebelluno'', 27 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

To determine whether the late pontiff should or not be declared [[Venerable]], theologians and the members of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints must determine if the late pope lived a life of [[heroic virtue]]. This meeting took place on 1 June 2017 in which theologians unanimously approved the fact that the late pope exercised virtues to a heroic degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.avvenire.it/opinioni/pagine/lanelito-alla-pace-e-carter-nel-luciani-ancora-segreto|title=L'anelito alla pace in una lattera inedita di Luciani a Carter|date=26 August 2017|publisher=Avvenire|accessdate=26 August 2017|author=Stefania Falasca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cardinal and bishop members discussed the cause on 7 November 2017 and issued their unanimous approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2017/11/07/vaticaninsider/ita/vaticano/luciani-s-unanime-alla-beatificazione-pOnGmElgMtkDTasdo6leeM/pagina.html|title=Luciani, "sì" unamime alla beatificiazione|publisher=La Stampa|date=7 November 2017|author=Andrea Tornielli|accessdate=8 November 2017}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Francis]] named John Paul I as [[Venerable]] on 8 November 2017 after confirming his [[heroic virtue]].&lt;ref name=Herald/&gt;

===Miracle===
For Luciani to be [[beatification|beatified]], the investigators have to certify at least one [[miracle]] attributed to his intercession. For [[Canonization|canonisation]] there must be a second miracle, though the reigning pope may waive these requirements altogether, as is often done in the case of beatified popes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-pages.com/saints/explained.asp |title=What is a Saint? |publisher=Catholic-Pages.com |date=29 July 1997 |accessdate=28 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919194942/http://www.catholic-pages.com/saints/explained.asp |archivedate=19 September 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported in 2016 that a potential miracle attributed to the late pontiff's intercession occurred in to a nun in [[Buenos Aires]] in [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corrierealpi.gelocal.it/belluno/cronaca/2016/07/07/news/papa-luciani-c-e-un-nuovo-miracolo-1.13777967|title=Pope Luciani, there is a new miracle|publisher=Corriere delle Alpi|date=7 July 2016|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Failed miracle===
The postulation also drew upon the testimony of Giuseppe Denora di Altamura who claimed to have been cured of cancer by the intercession of the late pontiff. An official investigation into the alleged miracle commenced on 14 May 2007 and concluded on 30 May 2009 with the C.C.S. validating the process on 25 March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncregister.com/blog/jpi_miracle_goes_to_rome/ John Paul I's Miracle Goes to Rome]. National Catholic Register, 8 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, the C.C.S. could not begin their thorough investigation into this case until the decree on his virtues was signed.

The supposed miracle attributed to his intercession was taken to a medical board in [[Rome]] on 24 April 2015 and the commission came to the conclusion that it was not a miracle that could be attributed to Luciani. This means that another miracle will need to be found before the cause can continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com.au/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fmessaggeroveneto.gelocal.it%2Fpordenone%2Fcronaca%2F2015%2F04%2F26%2Fnews%2Fl-intervista-parla-pizziolo-1.11309219&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url|title="Papa Albino Luciani non sarà beato" (in Italian)|publisher=|date=26 April 2015|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postulation===
The postulator for the cause was Bishop [[Enrico dal Covolo]] from 2003 until 2016 when Cardinal [[Beniamino Stella]] was appointed to that position. Stefania Falasca is the current vice-postulator.

==Legacy==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:John Paul I funeral 1978.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Funeral of Pope John Paul I.]] --&gt;
Pope John Paul I was the first pope to abandon [[papal coronation|coronation]], and he was also the first pope to choose a double name ([[papal name|John Paul]]) for his papal name. His successor, Cardinal [[Pope John Paul II|Karol Jozef Wojtyła]], chose the same name. He was the first pope to have a Papal Inauguration and the last pope to use the ''[[Sedia Gestatoria]]''.  He is the first Pope born in the 20th century, and the last Pope to die in the 20th century.
===Views of successors===
====John Paul II====
[[File:Museo papa Luciani.jpg|thumb|left|215px|The Pope Luciani museum]]
Cardinal [[Pope John Paul II|Karol Wojtyła]] was [[Papal conclave, October 1978|elected]] John Paul I's successor as [[Pope]] on Monday, 16 October 1978. The next day he celebrated [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] together with the [[College of Cardinals]] in the [[Sistine Chapel]]. After the Mass, he delivered his first ''[[Urbi et Orbi]]'' (a traditional blessing) message, broadcast worldwide via radio. In it he pledged fidelity to the [[Second Vatican Council]] and paid tribute to his predecessor:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Radiomessage "Urbi et orbi", Pope John Paul II|publisher=[[Libreria Editrice Vaticana]]|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/1978/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_19781017_primo-radiomessaggio_en.html|accessdate=28 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|What can we say of John Paul I? It seems to us that only yesterday he emerged from this assembly of ours to put on the papal robes—not a light weight. But what warmth of charity, nay, what 'an abundant outpouring of love'—which came forth from him in the few days of his ministry and which in his last Sunday address before the [[Angelus]] he desired should come upon the world. This is also confirmed by his wise instructions to the faithful who were present at his public audiences on faith, hope and love.}}

====Benedict XVI====
Benedict XVI spoke of the late pontiff on 28 September 2008 during his weekly Angelus address. Of the late pope, he said:

{{quote|Because of this virtue of his, it only took 33 days for Pope Luciani to win people's hearts. In his addresses he always referred to events in practical life, from his family memories and from popular wisdom. His simplicity was a vehicle for a solid, rich teaching which, thanks to the gift of an exceptional memory and a vast knowledge, he embellished with numerous citations from ecclesiastical and secular writers. Thus, he was an incomparable catechist, following in the footsteps of St [[Pope Pius X|Pius X]], who came from the same region and was his predecessor first on the throne of St Mark and then on that of St Peter. 'We must feel small before God,' he said during the same Audience. And he added, 'I am not ashamed to feel like a child before his mother; one believes in one's mother; I believe in the Lord, in what he has revealed to me.' These words reveal the full depth of his faith. As we thank God for having given him to the church and to the world, let us treasure his example, striving to cultivate his same humility which enabled him to talk to everyone, especially the small and the 'distant.' For this, let us invoke Mary Most Holy, the humble handmaid of the Lord.}}

====Francis====
Pope Francis spoke of his predecessor in his 2016 book ''The Name of God Is Mercy'' in which Francis recalls how touched he was by his predecessor's writings. More than any of his predecessors mentioned in his book, Francis refers to Luciani the most. The pope referred to Luciani's remarks at the latter's general audience of 6 September 1978 and mentioned how profound that his words were upon him; of the remarks Luciani made, he said:

{{quote|There is the homily when Albino Luciani said he had been chosen because the Lord preferred that certain things not be engraved in bronze or marble but in the dust, so that if the writing had remained, it would have been clear that the merit was only God's.}}

==Media==
* In 2006, the Italian Public Broadcasting Service, [[RAI]], produced a television miniseries about the life of John Paul I, called ''[[Pope John Paul I: The Smile of God|Papa Luciani: Il sorriso di Dio]]'' (literally, "Pope Luciani: The Smile of God"). It stars Italian comedian [[Neri Marcorè]] in the titular role.
* [[Hey! Luciani: The Life and Codex of John Paul I]] is a play written by [[Mark E. Smith]], best known as the lead singer of the band [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]]. Described by its author as "a cross between [[Shakespeare]] and [[The Prisoner]]", the play centres on the mysterious death of Pope John Paul I – born Albino Luciani. The Fall released one of the songs from the play, "[[Hey! Luciani]]," as a [[single (music)|single]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5489">'''Pulse-coupled networks''' or '''pulse-coupled neural networks''' ('''PCNN'''s) are neural models proposed by modeling a cat’s [[visual cortex]], and developed for high-performance [[biomimetic]] [[image processing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhan|first1=K.|last2=Shi|first2=J.|last3=Wang|first3=H.|last4=Xie|first4=Y.|last5=Li|first5=Q.|title=Computational mechanisms of pulse-coupled neural networks: A comprehensive review|journal=Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering|date=2017|volume=24|issue=3|pages=573--588|url=https://github.com/kunzhan/Pulse-coupled_neural_networks_PCNN|doi=10.1007/s11831-016-9182-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Eckhorn introduced a neural model to emulate the mechanism of cat’s [[visual cortex]]. The Eckhorn model provided a simple and effective tool for studying small [[mammal]]’s visual cortex, and was soon recognized as having significant application potential in image processing. 

In 1994, Johnson adapted the Eckhorn model to an image processing [[algorithm]], calling this [[algorithm]] a ''pulse-coupled neural network.'' Over the past decade, PCNNs have been used in a variety of image processing applications, including: [[Segmentation (image processing)|image segmentation]], [[feature generation]], [[face extraction]], [[motion detection]], [[region growing]], and [[noise reduction]].

The basic property of the Eckhorn's linking-field model (LFM) is the coupling term.  LFM is a modulation of the primary input by a biased offset factor driven by the linking input.  These drive a threshold variable that decays from an initial high value.  When the threshold drops below zero it is reset to a high value and the process starts over.  This is different than the standard integrate-and-fire neural model, which accumulates the input until it passes an upper limit and effectively "shorts out" to cause the pulse.

LFM uses this difference to sustain pulse bursts, something the standard model does not do on a single neuron level. It is valuable to understand, however, that a detailed analysis of the standard model must include a shunting term, due to the floating voltages level in the dendritic compartment(s), and in turn this causes an elegant multiple modulation effect that enables a true higher-order network (HON).&lt;ref&gt;See Johnson and Padgett IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS, VOL. 10, NO. 3, MAY 1999, page 480-498 for the shunting terms, and C. Lee Giles' old work from the late 80's on HONs)&lt;/ref&gt; Multidimensional pulse image processing of chemical structure data using PCNN has been discussed by Kinser, et al.&lt;ref&gt;Jason M. Kinser a, Karina Waldemark b, Thomas Lindblad b, Sven P. Jacobsson in Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems 51, 2000.115–124&lt;/ref&gt;

A PCNN is a two-dimensional [[neural network]]. Each [[neuron]] in the network corresponds to one pixel in an input image, receiving its corresponding pixel’s color information (e.g. intensity) as an external stimulus. Each neuron also connects with its neighboring neurons, receiving local stimuli from them. The external and local stimuli are combined in an internal activation system, which accumulates the stimuli until it exceeds a dynamic threshold, resulting in a pulse output. Through iterative computation, PCNN neurons produce temporal series of pulse outputs. The temporal series of pulse outputs contain information of input images and can be used for various image processing applications, such as image segmentation and feature generation. Compared with conventional image processing means, PCNNs have several significant merits, including robustness against noise, independence of geometric variations in input patterns, capability of bridging minor intensity variations in input patterns, etc.

A simplified PCNN called a spiking cortical model was developed in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;K. Zhan, H.J. Zhang, Y.D. Ma. New spiking cortical model for invariant texture retrieval and image processing. IEEE Trans. on neural networks, 2009, 20(12): 1980-1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

PCNNs are useful for image processing, as discussed in a book by Thomas Lindblad and Jason M. Kinser.&lt;ref&gt;Image Processing Using Pulse-Coupled Neural Networks, Second, Revised Version, Springer Verlag {{ISBN|3-540-24218-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
PCNN is proven success in many academic and industrial fields, such as image processing (image denoising,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Y.|title=Improved Image Filter based on SPCNN|journal=Science in China F edition: Information Science|date=2008|volume=51|issue=12|pages=2115–2125|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11432-008-0124-z|doi=10.1007/s11432-008-0124-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; and image enhancement &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wu|first1=L.|title=Color Image Enhancement based on HVS and PCNN|journal=Science China Information Sciences|date=2010|volume=53|issue=10|pages=1963–1976|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11432-010-4075-9|doi=10.1007/s11432-010-4075-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;), all pairs shortest path problem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wei|first1=G.|last2=Wang|first2=S.|title=A novel algorithm for all pairs shortest path problem based on matrix multiplication and pulse coupled neural network|journal=Digital Signal Processing|date=2011|volume=21|issue=4|pages=517–521|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051200411000650|doi=10.1016/j.dsp.2011.02.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pattern recognition.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The QMMG is used by a business or organization as a benchmark of how mature their processes are, and how well they are embedded in their culture, with respect to service or product quality management.

The QMMG is credited with being the precursor maturity model for the [[Capability Maturity Model]] (CMM) created a decade later that also has five levels of maturity.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Ram''' is a [[fictional]] [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[superhero]] published by [[DC Comics]].  He first appeared in ''[[Millennium (comics)|Millennium]]'' #2 (January 1988), and was created by [[Steve Engelhart]] and [[Joe Staton]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Takeo Yakata''' is chosen by the [[Guardians of the Universe]] to be evolutionarily advanced, and becomes the cybernetically enhanced Ram. This places him square in the sights of the [[Manhunters (DC Comics)|Manhunters]], a race of ancient robots who hate the Guardians. They try and kill him and the others chosen to be advanced. The survivors form a new team and operate independently for some time.  For a while, Ram lived on an isolated island with his friends, while they tried to work towards their mission of peace. When [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] tries to take control of the team, they attempt to resist peacefully and ultimately fail.&lt;ref&gt;''Millennium'' #2 (January 1988). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ram and many of the Guardians have been absorbed by the entity called 'Entropy' where they telepathically assist Hal Jordan in its defeat.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' Vol. 3 #32-35. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ram's picture is shown along with pictures of other superheroes that were kidnapped and killed in [[Roulette (DC Comics)|Roulette's]] casino.&lt;ref&gt;''JSA'' #28 (November 2001). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the "[[Watchmen]]" sequel "[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]," Ram is listed as a member of Japan's superhero team called [[Big Science Action|Big Monster Action]].&lt;ref&gt;''Doomsday Clock'' #6 (July 2018). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Ram has advanced evolutionary from the Guardians of the Universe, just like the rest of his team. 
This turns his entire body into crystalline electronics.  He is invulnerable to most physical attacks.  His enhancement made him a [[technopath]], allowing him to access satellites and wireless networks, and send information through them.

The '''Tigers of Chowgarh''' were a pair of [[Man-eaters|man-eating]] [[Bengal tiger]]s, consisting of an old tigress and her sub-adult cub, which for over a five-year period killed a reported 64 people in eastern [[Kumaon division|Kumaon]] over an area spanning {{convert|1500|sqmi|km2}}. The tigress was attacking humans initially alone, but later she was assisted by her sub-adult cub. The figures however are uncertain, as the natives of the areas the tigers frequented claimed double that number, and they do not take into account victims who survived direct attacks but died subsequently. Both tigers were killed by [[Jim Corbett]].

==First victim==

On December 15, 1925, a group of men from the village of Dalkania went up a hill to the hut of a Bhutia in order to complain to him for having seemingly allowed his goats into their crop fields. The man’s sheep dog was found dead, and the next day, his remains were found 100 yards from the hut.

[[Jim Corbett]] was called upon from [[Nainital]] to hunt down the tigers in February 1929. Three man-eaters had been reported in the Kumaon Division at the time, and Corbett chose to hunt the Chowgarh tigers due to their higher body count. A map recording the sites of each kill showed that the tigers were most active in the villages of the north-eastern face of the [[Kala Agar]] ridge. Corbett arrived at the Kala Agar Forest Bungalow in April that year after a four-day march. The last victim in the area had been a 22-year-old cattle grazer. The victim’s grandmother offered Corbett three buffaloes, in addition to his four, for use as bait. Upon receiving updates on the tigers' whereabouts, Corbett set off to the village of Dalkania {{convert|10|mi|km}} away the next day. Upon arriving, he was informed that the tigers had unsuccessfully attacked a party of women picking corn {{convert|10|mi|km}} north of Dalkania. Corbett left for the village at 3:00 p.m. and arrived the next day, where he found the village in a state of panic.

==Hunt for the tigers==
At midday, Corbett left for the valley where the villagers had heard the tigers calling. By evening, he reached the upper end of the valley without having seen anything, and by the following afternoon, Corbett was met by a cattle grazer stating that the tigers had taken a cow that night. Tracking the tigers to a ravine, he found the predators eating the dead cow. Corbett fired at the lighter-coloured animal, assuming it was the adult. Upon hearing the shot, the other tiger bolted, and Corbett, upon examining the carcass, found that the dead tiger was in fact the cub. After the cub was shot, the tigress attacks on human became less successful, as she was sometimes unable to kill victims on her own.

===First hunt for the tigress===
The following day, Corbett decided to use the four buffalo baits. For ten days, there were no reports of attacks and the buffalos were untouched. On the eleventh day, a woman was attacked half a mile on the far side of the village. After dressing her wounds, Corbett tied a bait goat on a nearby tree, though it was not taken. Three days later, Corbett was informed that a woman had been killed in Lohali, a village five miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) to the south of Dalkania. Upon arrival, Corbett was approached by a village elder who implored him to save his daughter who had escaped from the tiger with serious injuries. Though Corbett dressed her wounds with [[permanganate]], she died the following night. After a week, Corbett left Dalkania, though he promised to return upon hearing of another attack. During the journey, Corbett saw fresh [[pugmark]]s, and warned a buffalo herder nearby to be wary. Immediately after Corbett left, the herder was attacked by the tigress, which was driven off by the buffaloes. Before dying, the herder warned his village of the tigress’s presence.

===Second hunt for the tigress===
In February the next year, Corbett returned to Dalkania, where many deaths had occurred since his departure. Corbett tied a buffalo in the forest near the village, and shot two tigers accepting the bait. Upon inspecting the carcasses, he found that neither were the man-eater. After staying in Dalkania for a few weeks, Corbett left to attend an appointment with the district officials in the [[terai]].

===Third hunt for the tigress===
On 22 March 1930, Corbett received an urgent request from his District Commissioner to go to Kala Agar, fifty miles from Nainital. On arrival, Corbett was told that the tigress had recently killed a woman in the vicinity. Corbett tied his four buffaloes from Dalkania in strategic locations, one of which was killed four nights later. The culprits turned out to be a pair of [[leopard]]s, which were immediately shot in order to prevent them killing more bait.

===Death of the tigress and post-mortem===
On 11 April 1930, nineteen days after his arrival in Kala Agar, Corbett, along with two other men, tied the buffalo baits near an area where a young man had been previously killed. When positioning himself in a ravine, Corbett’s companions rushed to him, saying they had heard the tigress nearby. Corbett encountered the tigress face to face shortly after, sitting next to a large boulder. Corbett fatally shot the animal from a distance of eight feet, whose death coincided with an end to the attacks.

An examination of the tigress’ body showed that her claws and one [[canine tooth]] were broken and her front teeth were completely worn down. It was these disabilities that Corbett concluded led this tigress to having become a man eater as it was thus hampered in killing wild game.

Corbett used two calibres of rifles in hunting these man eating tigers. One was a very heavy calibre double-barrelled rifle, a "450/400", which was also quite heavy to carry. His second gun was a lighter calibre rifle, which he refers to as his 275 Rigby. This calibre is identical to that known the world over as the "[[7×57mm Mauser|7x57 Mauser]]", which shoots a bullet that is 7 millimetre in diameter. Corbett's own "275" rifle was actually a Model 1898 Mauser made by John Rigby &amp; Co. with five round magazine capacity. It was this "275" with which he killed the Chowgarh tigress described above on 11 April 1930 at a location Corbett describes as being "two miles west of Kala Agar", a mountain village at the time.

Corbett has not mentioned anywhere in his book that a 275 Rigby rifle was gifted to him by Sir JP Hewett then lieutenant governor of the United Provinces, he wrote a gun was gifted to the tahsildar of Champawat and a knife was gifted to the man accompanying him on the hunt. Corbett bought a 275 Rifle (7X57) made by Westley Richards built-in Mauser 98 action from Manton Calcutta.
The terrain in which Corbett hunted these tigers was mountainous and steep, with typical elevations being as high as 6,000 to 8,000 feet, and not far from the border between northern India and Nepal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11665">'''Tocolytics''' (also called '''anti-contraction medications''' or '''labor suppressants''') are medications used to suppress [[premature labor]] (from Greek τόκος ''tókos'', "[[childbirth]]", and λύσις ''lúsis'', "loosening"). Tocolytic therapy is provided when delivery would result in [[premature birth]], postponing delivery long enough for the administration of [[glucocorticoid|glucocorticoids]], which accelerate fetal lung maturity but may take one to two days before its effects are seen.

The suppression of contractions is often only partial and tocolytics can only be relied on to delay birth for several days. Depending on the tocolytic used the mother or fetus may require monitoring (e.g., blood pressure monitoring when [[nifedipine]] is used as it reduces blood pressure; [[cardiotocography]] to assess fetal well-being). In any case, the risk of preterm labor alone justifies hospitalization.

==Types of agents==
There is no clear [[First-line treatment|first-line]] tocolytic agent.&lt;ref name=Tan&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Tan TC, Devendra K, Tan LK, Tan HK |title=Tocolytic treatment for the management of preterm labour: a systematic review |journal=Singapore Med J |volume=47 |issue=5 |pages=361–6 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16645683 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19264820"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=de Heus R, Mol BW, Erwich JJ, etal |title=Adverse drug reactions to tocolytic treatment for preterm labour: prospective cohort study |journal=BMJ |volume=338 |issue= |pages=b744 |year=2009 |pmid=19264820 |pmc=2654772 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.b744|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=19264820}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various types of agents are used, with varying success rates and side effects. Some medications are not specifically approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for use in stopping uterine contractions in preterm labor, instead being used [[off-label use|off-label]].

[[File:Tumbleweed in motion.webm|thumb|A tumbleweed (''[[Lechenaultia]] divaricata'')]]
A '''tumbleweed''' is a structural part of the above-ground anatomy of a number of species of [[plant]]s, a [[diaspore (botany)|diaspore]] that, once it is mature and dry, [[abscission|detaches]] from its root or stem, and [[rotating locomotion in living systems|tumbles]] away in the [[wind]]. In most such species, the tumbleweed is in effect the entire plant apart from the [[root]] system, but in other plants, a hollow [[fruit]] or an [[inflorescence]] might serve the function.&lt;ref name="Ganong1921p359"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Textbook of Botany for Colleges|author=William Francis Ganong|publisher=MacMillan Co.|year=1921|page=359|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RkgaAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tumbleweed species occur most commonly in [[steppe]] and [[arid]] [[ecosystem|ecosystems]], where frequent wind and the open environment permit rolling without prohibitive obstruction.&lt;ref name="Baker2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dirk V. Baker|title=Dispersal of an Invasive Tumbleweed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HzKOSux-3UoC&amp;pg=PA90|year=2007|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-44310-0|pages=90–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from its primary vascular system and roots, the tissues of the tumbleweed structure are dead; their death is functional because it is necessary for the structure to degrade gradually and fall apart so that its [[seed]]s or [[spore]]s can escape during the tumbling, or [[germinate]] after the tumbleweed has come to rest in a wet location. In the latter case, many species of tumbleweed open mechanically, releasing their seeds as they swell when they absorb water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An outline of phytobiology|author=[[William Francis Ganong|W.

The tumbleweed diaspore [[seed dispersal|disperses]] seeds, but the tumbleweed strategy is not limited to the [[Spermatophyte|seed plants]]; some species of spore-bearing [[cryptogam]]s such as ''[[Selaginella]]'' form tumbleweeds, and some fungi that resemble [[puffballs]] dry out, break free of their attachments and are similarly tumbled by the wind, dispersing spores as they go.&lt;ref name="Jr.Miller1988"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Orson K.

In the family [[Amaranthaceae]] ''[[sensu|s.l.]]''(i.e. broadly defined to include [[Chenopodiaceae]]), several annual species of the genus [[Kali (plant)|''Kali'']] are tumbleweeds.  They are thought to be native to [[Eurasia]], but when their seeds entered [[North America]] in shipments of [[agricultural]] seeds, they became [[Naturalisation (biology)|naturalized]] in large areas. In the cinema genre of [[Western (genre)|Westerns]], they have long been symbols of frontier areas. ''[[Salsola tragus]]'' (currently not valid synonym&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calflora.org/cgi-bin/species_query.cgi?where-calrecnum=7296|title=Calflora: Salsola tragus|work=calflora.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plants.usda.gov/core/profile?symbol=SATR12|title=Plants Profile for Salsola tragus (prickly Russian thistle)|work=usda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kali tragus'') is the so-called  "Russian thistle". It is an annual plant that breaks off at the [[plant stem|stem]] base when it dies, and forms a tumbleweed, dispersing its seeds as the wind rolls it along.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Main|first=Douglas|title=Consider the tumbleweed|url=http://scienceline.org/2011/03/virtues-of-a-weed/|publisher=scienceline.org|accessdate=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is said to have arrived in the United States in shipments of [[flax]] seeds to [[South Dakota]], perhaps about 1870.&lt;ref name="Epple1997"&gt;{{cite book | last = Epple | first = Anne | title = Plants of Arizona | publisher = Falcon | year = 1997 | page = 352 | isbn = 978-1-56044-563-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It now is a [[noxious weed]] throughout North America, dominating disturbed habitats such as roadsides, cultivated fields, [[eroded]] slopes, and arid regions with sparse vegetation. Though it is a troublesome weed, ''Salsola tragus'' also provides useful [[livestock]] [[forage]] on arid rangelands.&lt;ref name=FNA242100193&gt;[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&amp;taxon_id=242100193 Salsola tragus Linnaeus] in Vol. 4 Page 399, 400, 401, 402 [http://www.efloras.org/flora_page.aspx?flora_id=1 Flora of North America], [http://www.efloras.org eFloras.org].&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Amaranthaceae ([[Sensu|s.s.]]) that form tumbleweeds, there are several species of ''Amaranthus'', such as ''[[Amaranthus albus]]'', native to [[Central America]] but invasive in [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Australia]]; and ''[[Amaranthus graecizans]]'', native to [[Africa]], but naturalized in North America.&lt;ref name="Abrams1944"&gt;{{cite book | last = Matt Jolley Abrams | first = LeRoy | title =  Illustrated Flora of the Pacific States Volume 2 | publisher = Stanford University Press | year = 1944 | page = 644 | isbn = 978-0-8047-0004-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Amaranthus retroflexus]]'', which is indigenous to tropical North and South America, has become nearly cosmopolitan largely as a weed, but like many other species of ''Amaranthus'', it also is widely valued as animal forage and as human food, though it should be utilised with caution to avoid toxicity.&lt;ref name="WattPP"&gt;Watt, John Mitchell; Breyer-Brandwijk, Maria Gerdina: The Medicinal and Poisonous Plants of Southern and Eastern Africa 2nd ed Pub. E &amp; S Livingstone 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Southern African [[Genus|genera]] in the family [[Amaryllidaceae]] produce highly optimised tumbleweeds; their [[inflorescence]]s are globular [[umbel]]s with long, spoke-like [[Pedicel (botany)|pedicels]], either effectively at ground level, or breaking off once the stems are dry. When the seeds are about ripe, the fruit remain attached to the [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncles]], but the stem of the umbel detaches, permitting the globes to roll about in the wind. The light, open, globular structures form very effective tumbleweed diaspores, dropping their seeds usually within a few days as the follicles fail under the wear of rolling. The seeds are fleshy, short-lived, and germinate rapidly where they land. Being poisonous and distasteful, they are not attractive to candidate transport animals, so the rolling diaspore is a very effective dispersal strategy for such plants. Genera with this means of seed dispersal include ''[[Ammocharis]]'', ''[[Boophone]]'', ''[[Crossyne]]'' and ''[[Brunsvigia]]''.&lt;ref name="JManningFB"&gt;{{cite book | last = Manning | first = John | title = Field Guide to Fynbos | publisher = Struik Publishers | location = Cape Town | year = 2008 | isbn = 9781770072657 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some species of the [[Apiaceae]] form tumbleweeds from their flower umbels, much as some Amaryllidaceae do.&lt;ref name="Ganong1921p359"/&gt;

In the [[Asteraceae]], the knapweed ''[[Centaurea diffusa]]'' forms tumbleweeds.  It is native to [[Eurasia]] and is naturalized in much of [[North America]]. Also in the Asteraceae, ''[[Lessingia glandulifera]]'', native to America,  sometimes forms tumbleweeds; it grows on sandy soils in desert areas, chaparral, and open pine forests of the western United States.&lt;ref name=FNA250068552&gt;[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&amp;taxon_id=250068552 Lessingia glandulifera] in Vol. 20 Page 452, 454, 456 [http://www.efloras.org/flora_page.aspx?flora_id=1 Flora of North America], [http://www.efloras.org eFloras.org].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Brassicaceae]], ''[[Sisymbrium altissimum]]'', ''[[Crambe maritima]]'', ''[[Lepidium]]'', and a [[resurrection plant]], ''[[Anastatica]]'' form tumbleweeds.

In the [[Caryophyllaceae]], the garden plant "baby's-breath" (''[[Gypsophila paniculata]]''), produces a dry inflorescence that forms tumbleweeds. In parts of central and western North America, it has become a common weed in many locations including hayfields and pastures.&lt;ref name=FNA242000539&gt;[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&amp;taxon_id=242000539 Gypsophila paniculata Linnaeus] in Vol. 5 [http://www.efloras.org/flora_page.aspx?flora_id=1 Flora of North America], [http://www.efloras.org eFloras.org].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the legume family ([[Fabaceae]]), ''[[Baptisia tinctoria]]'' and some species of ''[[Psoralea]]'' produce tumbleweeds. In ''Psoralea'' the tumbleweed detaches from the plant by [[abscission]] of the stem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In the [[Plantaginaceae]], ''[[Plantago cretica]]'' forms tumbleweeds.

Inflorescences that act as tumbling diaspores occur in some [[Poaceae|grasses]], including ''[[Schedonnardus]] paniculatus'' and some species of ''[[Eragrostis]]'' and ''[[Aristida]]''.&lt;ref name=Gibson2009&gt;{{Cite book

In the [[Solanaceae]], ''[[Solanum rostratum]] ''.&lt;ref name="Pammel1903"/&gt; forms tumbleweeds.

Wind dispersed fruits that tumble or roll on the ground, sometimes known as "tumble fruits", are rare.  Some are technically [[achenes]].  Highly inflated indehiscent fruits that may facilitate tumbling include ''[[Alyssopsis]]'',&lt;ref name="FGVPv5p83"&gt;{{cite book

Very similar in habit to ''Anastatica'', but practically unrelated, are the spore-bearing ''[[Selaginella lepidophylla]]'' (a [[Lycopodiophyta|lycopod]]) and earthstar mushroom family ([[Geastraceae]]).  All of these curl into a ball when dry and uncurl when moistened.

''[[Bovista]]'', a genus of puffball, uses essentially the same dispersal strategy.

==Environmental effects==
[[File:Tumbleweed in Chelan WA.jpg|right|thumb|A tumbleweed in [[Chelan, Washington]]]]
Some [[ruderal species]] that disperse as tumbleweeds are serious weeds that significantly promote wind erosion in open regions. Their effects are particularly harmful to [[dryland_farming|dry-land agricultural operations]] where the outside application of additional moisture is not practicable.  One study showed that a single Russian thistle can remove up to 167 liters (44 gallons) of water from the soil in competition with a wheat crop in one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

It sometimes happens that species of large tumbleweed, especially if thorny, can form aggregations that are physically hazardous and can block roads and cover buildings and vehicles. This can most obviously happen where fences and similar obstacles cause the accumulation, but the weeds can also entangle each other spontaneously until they form piles that can no longer roll. Such piles can be a serious threat to trapped vehicles or buildings and their occupants, most particularly because they are dry and flammable. Examples of enveloped buildings and vehicles have been documented mainly in the Western regions of the US. In residential areas, an example was the town of [[Mobridge, South Dakota]], where tens of tonnes of large tumbleweeds ("Russian thistles") that had matured in the dry bed of nearby [[Lake Oahe]] buried many houses so deeply that mechanical equipment was necessary to remove it, release occupants, and counter the fire hazard.&lt;ref name="Stablein1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marilyn Stablein|title=Climate of Extremes: Landscape and Imagination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vjq0x-fQksQC&amp;pg=PA33|year=1995|publisher=Black Heron Press|isbn=978-0-930773-39-7|pages=33–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19891225&amp;id=h0tQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AQ4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6967,3877275|title=Toledo Blade - Google News Archive Search|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a significant outbreak of ''[[Panicum effusum]]'' in the [[Australia]]n town of [[Wangaratta]] in February 2016 that attracted international attention. The seed heads of the weed, known locally as "hairy panic", had piled several meters deep in some places, forcing residents to spend several hours removing it to regain access to their doors and homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Australia town consumed by 'hairy panic'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-35600546|accessdate=2016-05-12|work=BBC News|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Video: 'Hairy Panic' tumbleweed takes over Australian homes|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/video-news/video-hairy-panic-tumbleweed-takes-over-australian-homes-34464665.html|accessdate=2016-05-12|work=Belfast Telegraph|date=2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Halkon|first1=Ruth|title=Entire town buried under bizarre 'hairy panic' weed that has baffled experts|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/entire-town-buried-under-bizarre-7391972|accessdate=2016-05-12|work=Mirror (UK)|date=2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The local council subsequently indicated it was considering attaching large vacuums to street-sweepers in an attempt to control the outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Big vacuums could combat 'hairy panic' in Australia city|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-35609602|accessdate=2016-05-12|work=BBC News|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 18, 2018, strong winds and neglected maintenance of neighboring private land brought in a very large number of tumbleweeds into [[Victorville, California]] and about 100 to 150 homes required help from public services after their entryways were at least partly blocked off. The local fire department also participated in the cleanup as the massive influx of tumbleweeds presented both a safety and fire hazard.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/04/18/603535155/houses-disappeared-when-tumbleweeds-rolled-into-this-california-city 'Houses Disappeared' When Tumbleweeds Rolled Into This California City]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tumbleweeds have also been observed to cause issues with wastewater treatment plants (WWTP)s. In some cases of inadequate fencing, they can get entangled in electromechanical equipment within plants such as clarifiers and mechanical aerators leading to increased energy use and labor cost associated with operating and cleaning the units.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, M. (2018) [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&amp;context=envengdiss 'Evaluating Opportunities and Barriers to Improving the Energy Efficiency of Small Nebraska Wastewater Treatment Plants',pp.83]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
The tumbleweed's association with the [[Western (genre)|Western]] film genre has led to a highly symbolic meaning in visual media. It has come to represent locations that are desolate, dry, and often humorless, with few or no occupants. A common use is when characters encounter a long abandoned or dismal-looking place: a tumbleweed will be seen rolling past, often accompanied by the sound of a dry, hollow wind. This is sometimes used for comic effect in locations where tumbleweeds are not expected, but the emptiness is obvious. Tumbleweed blowing between two theatrical characters can also be used to emphasize tension in a western style duel or standoff. 

As with the sound of [[Cricket (insect)#In popular culture|crickets]], tumbleweeds can also be shown to emphasize an awkward silence after a bad joke or a character otherwise making an absurd declaration, with the aforementioned sound of [[wind]] and the plant rolling past in the background.

'''William Jones Lowndes''' (February 11, 1782 – October 27, 1822) was an [[United States|American]] [[lawyer]], [[Planter (American South)|planter]], and statesman from South Carolina. He represented the state in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Congress]] from 1811 to May 8, 1822, when he resigned.

He was the son of [[Rawlins Lowndes]], an [[American Revolutionary War]] leader from [[South Carolina]], and was married to Elizabeth Pinckney, daughter of Federalist leader [[Thomas Pinckney]].

==Early life==
Lowndes was born at the "Horseshoe" plantation near [[Jacksonboro, South Carolina]] on February 11, 1782.  He received a classical education in South Carolina and England before studying law.  He was admitted to the bar in 1804 and commenced practice in Charleston.  In addition, Lowndes owned and operated several rice plantations on South Carolina's Atlantic coast.

==Politics==

William J. Lowndes first served in the [[South Carolina House of Representatives]] from 1804 to 1808.

Elected to the [[12th United States Congress|Twelfth United States Congress]] as a Representative from the [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] area, Lowndes was a central member of the '[[War hawk|War Hawk]]' faction along with [[Speaker of the House of Representatives (United States)|Speaker of the House]] [[Henry Clay]], future President of the [[Second Bank of the United States]] [[Langdon Cheves]], Tennessee representative [[Felix Grundy]], and future [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] and South Carolina Senator [[John C. Calhoun]]. The War Hawks agitated throughout the Congressional session for the declaration of the [[War of 1812]], which was achieved on June 19. Lowndes became close friends with Calhoun during this time, with whom he also shared a boardinghouse; Lowndes's granddaughter relates that, twenty years after Lowndes's death, Calhoun told his widow "that there had never been a shadow between them."&lt;ref&gt;Ravenel 87; Vipperman 77-80&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the war, Lowndes served as Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Ways and Means Committee]], in which capacity he authored and shepherded through Congress the [[Tariff of 1816]] in consultation with [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Alexander J. Dallas (statesman)|Alexander Dallas]]. Due to his reputation for financial expertise, Lowndes was also a chief lieutenant of Calhoun in the passage of the [[Second Bank of the United States]] during the [[14th United States Congress|Fourteenth Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Annals of Congress, 14th Cong., 1st sess., 1233, 1674-95&lt;/ref&gt; Extremely well-respected by his colleagues and the press,&lt;ref&gt;Washington Daily National Intelligencer, Apr. 30, 1816; Vipperman 143-4&lt;/ref&gt; Lowndes was offered several Cabinet positions by both [[James Madison]] and his successor [[James Monroe]], including [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of Treasury]] and [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life and Times of William Lowndes of South Carolina|last=Ravenel|first=Harriet|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=1901|isbn=|location=|pages=156-7|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Lowndes refused the latter, it was offered to Calhoun, who accepted the position and held it until his inauguration as Vice President in 1825. Staying in the House, Lowndes was a major player in the negotiations surrounding what would become the [[Missouri Compromise]]; Southern support for the Compromise was at least partially due to Lowndes's advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;Freehling, William. ''Prelude to Civil War: The Nullification Controversy in South Carolina'' (New York: Harper and Row, 1965), 108.&lt;/ref&gt;   

In 1821, Lowndes was nominated for President of the United States for the [[United States presidential election, 1824|1824 election]] by the [[South Carolina General Assembly|South Carolina legislature]] over the more ambitious Calhoun, dealing a serious blow to Calhoun's own incipient candidacy.  Perennially ill after an accident in his youth,&lt;ref&gt;Vipperman 7-8&lt;/ref&gt; Lowndes' health took a serious downturn in just a year later, necessitating his resignation from Congress. At the urging of his wife, the Lowndes family embarked for a recuperative visit to England, but William died en route on October 27, 1822 at the age of 40. He was buried at sea.

==Legacy and honors==

Following his resignation in 1822, Lowndes was replaced in the House by [[James Hamilton Jr.|James Hamilton, Jr.]], who, as [[Governor of South Carolina|Governor]] of the state during the [[Nullification Crisis]], was one of the leaders of the Nullification movement along with John C. Calhoun. The juxtaposition of these two figures highlights Lowndes's position, due in large part to his premature death, as one of the last Southern nationalists and as a marker of, in the words of Lowndes's most recent biographer, "the transition of Southern politics."&lt;ref&gt;Vipperman, ''William Lowndes and the Transition of Southern Politics.''&lt;/ref&gt; 

In March–April 1824, electors from South Carolina honored William Lowndes posthumously with a single vote at the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] Caucus, as the party's candidate for the Office of [[U.S. Vice President]] for the [[United States presidential election, 1824|upcoming election]]. 

William Lowndes is credited with developing the Lowndes Apportionment Method, a method of apportionment for Congressional seats that would give more power to smaller states. It was not adopted by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Caulfield (Gannon University), "Apportioning Representatives in the United States Congress - Lowndes' Method of Apportionment," ''Convergence'' (November 2010), DOI:10.4169/loci003163&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lowndesville, South Carolina]]; and [[Lowndes County, Georgia|Lowndes]] counties in Georgia, [[Lowndes County, Alabama|Alabama]] and [[Lowndes County, Mississippi|Mississippi]] are all named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gannett|first=Henry|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA191|year=1905|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;
