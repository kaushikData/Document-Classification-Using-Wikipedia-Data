[[File:Hans Memling 056.jpg|thumb|right|400px|''Advent and Triumph of Christ'' by [[Hans Memling]], 1480, [[Alte Pinakothek]], Munich.]]

'''''Advent and Triumph of Christ''''' is an [[oil painting]] on a panel of wood, painted c.1480 by German-born [[Early Netherlandish painter]] [[Hans Memling]].  It was made for the altar of the Tanners' guild in Our Lady's Church in [[Bruges]], but is now held by the [[Alte Pinakothek]] in [[Munich]].  It measures 81 × 189 cm.

The painting shows 25 episodes from the [[Life of Christ in art|''Life of Christ'']] (although some have interpreted it as a version of the [[Seven Joys of the Virgin]]) combined in one narrative composition without a central dominating scene: including the [[Annunciation]]; the [[Annunciation to the shepherds]]; the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]]; the [[Massacre of the Innocents]]; the [[Adoration of the Magi]]; the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]]; the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]]; the [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]]; [[Pentecost]]; the [[Dormition of Mary|Dormition]] and [[Assumption of Mary]].  A similar narrative style was employed by Memling for his earlier ''[[Scenes from the Passion of Christ]]'' (c.1470), commissioned by [[Tommaso Portinari]] and now held by the [[Galleria Sabauda]] in [[Turin]].

'''''Amateur Porn Star Killer''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Horror film|horror]] [[film series]], currently consisting of three films. Created by Shane Ryan, the original film was theatrically released in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;"Amateur Porn Star Killer Hits Theatres Today", ''News Blaze'', August 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== First film ==
The first chapter of the series is a mockumentary about a [[snuff film]] shot, mainly consisting in a confrontation between the director of the snuff (played by the same Shane Ryan) and his 13 years old victim (Michiko Jimenez). According to Ryan, it was filmed in one weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Doug Brunell|title=Excess Hollywood: The Art Of Snuff — The Shane Ryan Interview Part One|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/features/1673/|accessdate=22 October 2013|newspaper=[[Film Threat]]|date=January 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received mixed reviews. According to the book ''From the Arthouse to the Grindhouse'', the film is "a postmodern take on the transgressive reality film, using the genre's format as a position from which to critique it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=John Cline, Robert G. Weiner|title=From the Arthouse to the Grindhouse: Highbrow and Lowbrow Transgression in Cinema's First Century|publisher=Scarecrow Press, 2010|isbn=0810876558|pages=312–313}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DVD Verdict]]'s critic Gordon Sullivan panned the film, writing that it could be interesting as a 15-minute short, and referring to it as "boring" and lacking both "a competent audiovisual scheme and a compelling narrative".&lt;ref name="Case Number 13148"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gordon Sullivan |title=Case Number 13148 - Amateur Porn Star Killer |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/amateurpornstarkiller.php |accessdate=22 October 2013 |newspaper=[[DVD Verdict]] |date=March 7, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023061523/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/amateurpornstarkiller.php |archivedate=23 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sequels ==
The other chapters of the film reprise the scheme of the first film, with just two actors (the snuff director and the victim) on scene. About the second film, according to the ''[[Film Threat]]'' review, "Ryan has, once again, created something bound to raise eyebrows and the ire of morality police everywhere. He makes no apologies for it, and he does it so well that if you go into the film with an open mind you can’t help but be impressed by how good a job he’s done."&lt;ref name="SNUFF VERSION"&gt;{{cite news|title=AMATEUR PORN STAR KILLER 2: THE SNUFF VERSION (DVD)|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/reviews/10859/|accessdate=22 October 2013|newspaper=[[Film Threat]]|date=May 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final chapter of the film features the real pornstar Regan Reese as main actress. It was filmed in [[3D film|3D]]. While the previous two films were shot in motel rooms, this was set in the front seat of a [[SUV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Richard Scheib|title=Amateur Porn Star Killer 3: The Final Chapter (film review)|url=http://moria.co.nz/horror/amateur-porn-star-killer-3-the-final-chapter-2009.htm|accessdate=22 October 2013|newspaper=Moria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bananaman''' is a fictional character appearing in British comic books. Bananaman is a parody of traditional superheroes, being portrayed as a schoolboy who is transformed into a muscled, caped figure when he eats a banana. The character originally appeared in ''[[Nutty]]'' as the back page strip in [[Issue 1]], dated 16 February 1980 drawn by [[John Geering]]. He has since appeared in ''[[The Dandy]]'' and ''[[The Beano]]''.

==Original strip==
The original strip, by Dave Donaldson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/news_search_results.htm/news_article.htm?articleid=21563 |title= Comic creator legend at special Edinburgh Castle event |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Historic Scotland |accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Steve Bright, written and developed by the latter, and mostly drawn by [[John Geering]] until his death in 1999, is essentially a parody of [[Superman]] and [[Batman]] with shades of [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and his British twin, [[Marvelman]], and occasionally other [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] characters, while also combining comic slapstick with a heavy dose of eccentric [[British humour]] similar to [[Alan Moore]]'s contemporary work on [[Captain Britain]].

After [[John Geering]] died in 1999, [[Barrie Appleby]] took over and later [[Tom Paterson]]. In 2003, the original scriptwriter, [[Steve Bright]] drew it, until 2007. Sporadically from 2007 to 2010 the character appeared in reprinted strips from the John Geering era. For a short time, in the end of 2008, artist [[Chris McGhie]] reinvented Bananaman in a series of new strips. 

Chris' other work included The Three Bears for ''[[The Beano]]'' (in 2002) and the characters on [[Yoplait]]'s 'Wildlife' product range. Two new strips appeared that year drawn by [[Barrie Appleby]] as well.

Since the ''Dandy'' revamp occurring in October 2010, Wayne Thompson took over drawing Bananaman in a style reminiscent of French cartoonist [[Lisa Mandel]], a popular artist in ''[[The Dandy]]'' who has previously drawn Jak, Agent Dog 2-Zero and, occasionally, [[Bully Beef and Chips]]. 

In Issue 3515, Wayne's style notably changes and looks more cartoony and detailed. As of spring 2011, Thompson's version of Bananaman appears in full colour over two pages. From 1983 to 1986, Bananaman also had his own [[Annual publication#British annuals|annual]]. This was unusual because, unlike many other comics at the time, ''[[Nutty]]'' never had an annual. Unlike [[Dennis and Gnasher|Dennis the Menace]] and [[Bash Street Kids]], which mostly consisted of reprints, these annuals were entirely new material.

In Issue 3618, dated 14 January 2012, Bananaman made his debut appearance, as John Geering reprints, in ''[[The Beano]]'', however he continued to appear in ''The Dandy''. Another ''Beano'' character, Bananagirl of ''[[Super School]]'', was revealed to be his cousin.

The Dandy print comic ended in December 2012, but Bananaman was still seen in the digital version drawn by [[Andy Janes]]. New Bananaman strips drawn by Wayne Thompson and written by [[Nigel Auchterlounie]], [[Kev F Sutherland]] and lately [[Cavan Scott]] continue to run in The Beano through 2014. In 2016, writing duties for the strip were taken over by [[Tommy Donbavand]] and [[Danny Pearson (comics)|Danny Pearson]].

==Character==
In the strip, Eric Wimp, an ordinary schoolboy living at 29 Acacia Road, Nuttytown (later changed to Dandytown and then Beanotown when the strip moved to other comics), eats a banana to transform into Bananaman, an adult [[superhero]], sporting a distinctive cowled blue and yellow outfit complete with a yellow two tailed [[cape]] resembling a banana skin. 

His superpowers include the ability to fly, superhuman strength (often quoted as "twenty men... twenty ''big'' men" but sometimes limitless, with "nerks", "women" and "snowmen" all being used in place of "men"), and seeming invulnerability. 

This is offset by the fact that he is just as naive and foolish (if not more so) as his alter ego; as mentioned in the comic once or twice, he has the "muscles of twenty men and the brains of twenty mussels".

If Bananaman needs extra power, bananas can be eaten for strength boosts, provided by his faithful pet crow; if he does not have enough strength to shatter an ice block, for example, after eating another banana, he will have enough. If he eats lots of bananas in one sitting, he quickly becomes obese in his transformation; if he eats bananas that are not full, he transforms with extra weight in the lower part of his body. 

There have also been comics where he has eaten a variant on normal bananas, and transforms differently, reflecting the difference in that banana. The effects of eating the bananas are not consistent from story to story.

==Varying origins==
Eric was rocketed to [[Earth]] from the [[moon]] as a baby, and gained his powers because the [[Lunar phase|crescent moon]] resembles a banana. Bananaman resembles Superman in two respects. Firstly, he has a [[kryptonite]]-style weakness to mouldy bananas. Furthermore, he even has a [[Fortress of Solitude]]-style building at the North Pole, made out of a giant banana. 

During early board meetings, the designers thought of the aspect of Bananagirl to accompany the series. The girl would have been called Margaret Wimp, and be the "sister" of Eric. This idea was scrapped later on in production, because the concept of two children being related without parents would be too far fetched for children to understand, however the idea was revived for a [[Super School|Beano comic strip]].

In the 1991 ''[[The Dandy Annual|Dandy Annual]]'', Bananaman's origin was changed to that of being a normal Earth baby in a maternity hospital, who obtained his powers after unintentionally eating a banana in which General Blight had hidden a stolen supply of Saturnium (presumably similar to [[uranium]], [[neptunium]] or [[plutonium]]), and accidentally left it next to Eric. However, later issues referred to the first origin as the real one.

==Other characters==
Bananaman initially faced a different [[pastiche]] [[supervillain]] each week, who were often lampoons of the kind of single issue, uncreatively named villains that heroes fought during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], or tips of the hat to famous supervillains.  Bananaman's archenemy is General Blight, a parody of [[Adolf Hitler]] and generic criminal mastermind who in later strips largely replaced the criminal of the week.

The strip's medium subverting elements became toned down as the strip gained in popularity, becoming more simplistic to appeal to the new audience.{{original research inline|date=January 2015}}  Eric's punk style shaved head was replaced by a more typical 1980s style haircut,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=Nutty|publisher=D. C. Thomson|issue=182|date=1983-08-06|story=Bananaman|page=1|panel=1|url=https://archive.org/details/Nuttycomic|accessdate=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bananaman gained a talking crow sidekick called simply Crow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=Nutty|publisher=D. C. Thomson|issue=180|date=1983-07-30|story=Bananaman|page=12|panel=3|url=https://archive.org/details/Nuttycomic|accessdate=2018-03-18}},&lt;/ref&gt; and Bananaman became so stupid he often forgot how to fly or to use the door.  Eventually, Bananaman even began to go to school despite being an adult.

Bananaman is allied with Chief O'Reilly, a stereotyped Irish policeman (apparently in homage to Batman's [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] or the equally stereotyped Chief O'Hara in the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series). He used to wear an Indian feather headdress as a visual pun on ''Chief'', and in later strips wore a hat with a flashing blue light on the top. 

Chief works in a police station shaped like a giant police helmet, which frequently has to be rebuilt after Bananaman accidentally destroys it. O'Reilly rings up Eric to get him to talk to Bananaman, presumably thinking Eric is Bananaman's assistant of some kind, as in the cartoon series it is made clear that the Chief is not aware of Eric's being the superhero.

From 1983 to 1986, the [[BBC]] aired a [[cartoon]] series based on Bananaman and featuring the voices of the members of [[The Goodies]]. It was produced by ''Flicks Films'' and ''DC Thomson's Other Classics'' for ''Abbey Home Entertainment'' in association with [[Jim Henson Productions]]. Parts of the character were changed for the series: he was now called '''Eric Twinge''', had a distinctive banana-shaped hairstyle rather than punk stubble, and had a love interest (only when transformed) in the form of Fiona, a newsreader based on [[Selina Scott]] and also a possible homage to [[Lois Lane]].

[[Graeme Garden]] (incorrectly credited as ''Greame'' Garden on some episodes) voiced the characters of Bananaman, General Blight and Maurice of The Heavy Mob, [[Bill Oddie]] voiced the characters of Crow, Chief O'Reilly, Doctor Gloom and the Weatherman, and [[Tim Brooke-Taylor]] voiced the characters of Eric, King Zorg of the Nerks, Eddie the Gent, Auntie, and Appleman, as well as narrating the episodes. 

Jill Shilling voiced Fiona and any additional female characters, including Eric's cousin Samantha (but not Auntie). It lasted for forty episodes between 3 October 1983 and 15 April 1986.

''Bananaman'' was aired in the United States by the [[Nickelodeon]] cable network, as a companion piece to ''[[Danger Mouse (1981 TV series)|Danger Mouse]]'', but ''Bananaman'' never came close to reaching that series' American popularity. The show also aired during the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's (ABC) after school timeslot, and is considered one of the [[Classic ABC]] shows.

In 1997, some episodes of ''Bananaman'' were used on the cartoon series ''The Pepe and Paco Show'', created by [[Henson International Television]].

Some of these episodes would eventually reappear in print form in ''The Dandy'' in 1998, coinciding with the BBC repeating the series that year, and were reprinted in the comic in Spring 2007, now promoting the DVD. Each episode was roughly five minutes from start to end. Phrases from the show, "twenty big men" and "ever alert for the call to action", are still used in the comic today.

==Film adaptation==
In March 2014, it was announced that DC Thomson, in conjunction with [[Elstree Studios|Elstree Studio Productions]], would be producing a movie on ''Bananaman'', with a release date in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trailer-geek.com/movie/bananaman/ |title=Bananaman Movie |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Trailer Geek |accessdate=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MetroFilm&gt;{{cite news|title=Peel the power!

In January 2016, the ''Bananaman'' musical's page on Facebook posted that the movie adaptation is now in development, saying "This fruitiest of superheroes is experiencing a revival elsewhere – ''Bananaman The Movie'' is also in development". However, a release date was not mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/bananamanmusical/posts/720656384702793|title=For the first time ever, Bananaman will... - Bananaman the Musical|last=|first=|date=|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 June 2016, the now newly formed ''Beano Studios'' issued a press release. In the release it was noted that ''Beano Studios'' was formed to bring their properties to life through television, film and live performances based upon present projects which were being worked on. "Beano Studios is currently also exploring plans to take Beano characters to the bigger screens and stages worldwide."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/company/beano-studios/|title=Beano Studios Overview|last=|first=|date=|website=LinkedIn|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Though not specifically referenced, it can be assumed that this newly formed studio would take charge of the ''Bananaman'' movie, which had had no developments since the beginning of 2016. By June 2017, the official site had been removed. As the film never came in 2015 as promised, it is likely the film has been cancelled.

==Musical production==
Near the beginning of January 2016, it was reported that ''Bananaman'' would be turned into a musical for [[West End theatre|West End]]. An industry launch took place on 2 February 2016, showcasing the musical. The musical had run from the end of 2017 to the beginning of 2018, at the Southark Playhouse in London. It is unknown if it will be produced worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bananaman musical being developed {{!}} News {{!}} The Stage|url = https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2016/bananaman-musical-being-developed/|website = The Stage|access-date = 2016-02-02|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Buddhism|terse=1}}
In [[Buddhism]], death marks the transition from this life to the next for the deceased.

Among Buddhists, death is regarded as an occasion of major religious significance, both for the deceased and for the survivors. For the deceased, it marks the moment when the transition begins to a new mode of existence within the round of rebirths. When death occurs, all the karmic forces that the dead person accumulated during the course of his or her lifetime become activated and determine the next rebirth. For the living, death is a powerful reminder of the Buddha's teaching on impermanence; it also provides an opportunity to assist the deceased person as he or she fares on to the new existence.&lt;ref name="kariyawasam_ch5"&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/kariyawasam/wheel402.html#ch5 Kariyawasam (1995), ch. 5, "Almsgiving and Funerals."]&lt;/ref&gt;  BuddhaNet has published a guidance article about the subject,&lt;ref name=agpbf&gt;{{cite web|last=Malaysia Buddhist Co-operative Society Berhad |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=A Guide to a Proper Buddhist Funeral |work= |publisher=Buddha Dharma Education Association Inc. |date= |url=http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/buddhist_funeral.pdf |format= |doi= |accessdate=14 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140124153539/http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/buddhist_funeral.pdf |archivedate=January 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which also discusses the traditions of different [[Schools of Buddhism|Buddhist school]]s.&lt;ref name=cfrd&gt;{{cite web

=={{anchor|Pansukula}} Theravada traditions==
For the non-[[Arhat]], death is a time of transitioning to a yet another [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]]; thus, the living participate in acts that transfer [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]] to the departed, either providing for a more auspicious rebirth or for the relief of suffering in the departed's new existence. For the living, ceremonies marking another's death are a reminder of life's [[anicca|impermanence]], a fundamental aspect of the Buddha's teaching.&lt;ref name="kariyawasam_ch5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also, for example, in the [[Pali Canon]], awareness of another's death is often referred to as one of the "messengers" from the lord of the Underworld meant to spur one onto a more wholesome life.{{full|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Death rites are generally the only life cycle ritual that Theravāda Buddhist monks get involved in and are therefore of great importance.

A distinctive ritual unique to funeral rites is the offering of cloth to monks. This is known as ''paṃsukūla'' in Pali, which means "forsaken robe". This symbolises the discarded rags and body shrouds that monks used for their robes during the time of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=LANGER|first1=RITA|title=From Riches to Rags: how new clothes for the dead become old robes for monks.|journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society|date=20 September 2013|volume=24|issue=01|pages=125–144|doi=10.1017/S1356186313000345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Offering of cloth on behalf of the dead''' (''mataka-vastra-[[Puja (Buddhism)|puja]]''): Before a cremation, at the deceased's home or cemetery, the funeral's presiding monastics are offered a white cloth to be subsequently stitched into monastic robes.  During this ceremony, the following verse which was, according to the [[Mahāparinibbāna Sutta|Mahaparinibbana Sutta]], spoken by god Sakka after the passing away of the Buddha, is recited:
&lt;center&gt;

* '''Preaching for the benefit of the dead''' (''mataka-bana''): Within a week after the funeral (usually on the third day after), a monastic returns to the deceased's home to provide an appropriate hour-long sermon for surviving relatives and neighbors. The sermon is usually held on the sixth day after the death occurred and often family, friends and neighbours are treated to a meal afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Rita Langer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HoSbiXNiP7oC ''Buddhist Rituals of Death and Rebirth: A study of contemporary Sri Lankan practice and its origins'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Offering in the name of the dead''' (''mataka-[[Dana (Buddhism)|dana]]''): Made three months after the funeral and then annually afterwards, the deceased's survivors hold an [[Alms#Buddhism|almsgiving]] on their behalf.&lt;ref name="kariyawasam_ch5" /&gt;

==Mahayana traditions==
&lt;!--"Faith in Buddhism#Pure Land Buddhism" links here--&gt;
{{See also|Japanese funeral|Buddhist chant}}
In China, numerous instructive and merit-transferring ceremonies are held during the forty-nine days between death and rebirth. For most Chinese funerals, the practice of recitation of the [[Amitabha Sutra]] and the name of [[Amitabha]] is an important part of death rites.&lt;ref name="harvey_p212"&gt;Harvey (1990), p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with cultural practices, such as the burning of [[joss paper]] (which is discouraged by most practicing Buddhists), practitioners are often cremated.

===Exposure of the Corpse===
 
"Exposure of the Corpse" (''Lushizang'', 露屍葬) is the practice of placing the body of the deceased in an open area instead of using coffins or sarcophagi. In the Indian tradition, the practice of exposing the corpse included putting the body in the forest or sinking it under water.&lt;ref&gt;Schopen, Gregory. Bones, Stones, and Buddhist Monks : Collected Papers On the Archaeology, Epigraphy, and Texts of Monastic Buddhism In India. Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 1997. p. 204-237&lt;/ref&gt; Originating from India, medieval Chinese monks also practiced exposing the corpse in the woods but so far no textual evidence support the practice of water burial. In addition, cave burial (''Shishi yiku'' 石室瘞窟) was also a type of ''Lushizang'' in medieval China.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Shufen. Zhong Gu De Fo Jiao Yu She Hui. Di 1 ban. Shanghai: Shanghai gu ji chu ban she, 2008. p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

The point of exposing the corpse was to offer the body to hungry birds and beasts.  After that, the remains were collected. There were three ways to dispose of the remains: 
* Collect the remains from the woods, bury them or place them in a pagoda
* Cremate the remains, then bury the ashes or place them in a pagoda
* Cremate the remains, then distribute the ashes in the woods or water

===Cave burial===

Starting from the third century CE, Chinese monks used caves as the resting place for the deceased. This funeral practice (''Shishi yiku'', 石室瘞窟) may have been influenced by Central Asian practices.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Shufen. Zhong Gu De Fo Jiao Yu She Hui. Di 1 ban. Shanghai: Shanghai gu ji chu ban she, 2008. p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to forest burial, cave burial was less direct than exposure.

Before medieval times, the word "stone cave" (''Shishi'', 石室) can either mean the government library or suggest the main room in an ancestral temple (''Zongmiao'', 宗庙). To make Buddhist funerary caves, one can adopt the three methods:

* Use natural caves or grottos
* Make slight changes to existing grottos
* Pile up stones to make new caves

To achieve the goal of giving one's body to the animals, most caves and grottos were open. The few exceptions include the north cliff of Longmen wanfo gou (龙门万佛沟).&lt;ref&gt;Zhang Naizhu, Longmen shiku tangdai yiku de xinfaxian jiqi wenhuayiyi de tantao. p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, monks used the sitting position and practiced [[dhuta]] (''Toutuo'', 头陀). These caves were reusable and most of them were found in [[Chang'an]] and [[Longmen Grottoes|Longmen]]. [[Dunhuang]] and [[Sichuan]] also have such caves.

===Forest burial===

Chinese monks began the practice of "forest burial" (''Linzang'', 林葬) from the fifth century CE. Reputedly the famous monk of the Eastern Jin, [[Huiyuan (Buddhist)|Huiyuan]], was the first in China to practice forest burial.

This practice might have been very popular in the sixth century CE. According to the ''[[Book of Chen]]'' (陈书), even lay people attempted to adopt this funerary method. The term "Cool Grove" (''Shituolin'' 尸陀林) was applied to describe the exposing place, or used as a general term for this practice.

After the sixth century CE, the number of documents recording forest burial increased. In [[Daoxuan| Daoxuan's]] Biographies of Eminent Monks (''Xugaosenzhuan'' 续高僧传), there were many stories with such descriptions. According to [[Daoxuan]] and other epitaphs of monks, there were two types of monks who practiced forest burial:&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Shufen. Zhong Gu De Fo Jiao Yu She Hui. Di 1 ban. Shanghai: Shanghai gu ji chu ban she, 2008. p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;
* the monks of the [[Sanjiejiao|Three Stages Sect]]. This sect took both monks and lay practitioners including female believers. The most famous places for the Three Stages Sect were [[Zhongnan Mountains]] and Baoshan.
* other monks of different sects, usually from the [[Chang’an]] area. They focused on [[Chinese Chán|Chan]] learning and valued lineage. Those monks practiced in temples such as [[Chang’an]] Yanxing Temple, [[Chang’an]] Shengguang Temple and [[Chang’an]] Qingchan Temple.

===Mummification===
While mummification does occur as a funeral custom in a variety of Buddhist traditions, it is not a common practice; [[cremation]] is more common. Many Mahayana Buddhist monks noted in their last testaments a desire for their students to bury them sitting in a lotus posture, put into a vessel full of coal, wood, paper and/or lime and surrounded by bricks, and be exhumed after approximately three years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ah.gov.cn/cjfw/ahly/showcontent.asp?newsid=%7B1E8B86BC-DF96-496B-B70A-8F414E92E82B%7D  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429191656/http://www.ah.gov.cn/cjfw/ahly/showcontent.asp?newsid=%7B1E8B86BC-DF96-496B-B70A-8F414E92E82B%7D |date=April 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The preserved bodies would be painted with paints and adorned with gold. Many were so respected that they were preserved by their students. They were called "Corporeal [[Bodhisattva]]s", similar to that of the [[Roman Catholic]] [[incorruptibles]]. Many were destroyed during the cultural revolution in China, some were preserved, such as [[Huineng]], the Sixth Patriarch of Ch'an Buddhism and [[Kim Gyo-gak|Kim Kiaokak]], a Korean Buddhist monk revered as a manifestation of Ksitigarbha, and some have been discovered recently: one such was the Venerable Tzu Hang in Taiwan; another was the Venerable Yuet Kai in Hong Kong.

Other notable examples of Buddhist mummification are [[Dashi-Dorzho Itigilov]] in Siberia, [[Loung Pordaeng]] in [[Thailand]], and a 15th-century Tibetan monk from Northern India examined by [[Victor Mair]] in the documentary ''The Mystery of the Tibetan Mummy''. While the documentary suggests that the monk may have consumed poisonous matters on purpose, there is no proof of such practice for any of the mentioned persons, so the poisonous substances occasionally found in their remains may have been applied to their corpses by their followers.

==Tibetan traditions==

A person who is dying and who is recently dead will have for example the ''[[Tibetan Book of the Dead]]'' read to them (in the [[Nyingma]] tradition) to help guide them through the transition period (Tib.: ''[[bardo]]'') between lives, easing attachments to this life and deepening [[bodhisattva]] wisdom.  The corpse is either cremated or dismembered and fed to vultures (Tib.: ''[[jhator]]'').&lt;ref name="harvey_p212" /&gt;

Other Tibetan traditions have other special texts read and rituals performed, which may also be personalized to the specific (vajrayana) practice a person focused on during his/her life. As the ''bardo'' is generally said to last a maximum of 49 days, these rituals usually last 49 days.

Death and dying is an important subject in Tibetan Buddhism as it is a most critical period for deciding which [[karma]] will ripen to lead one to the next rebirth, so a proper control of the mind at the death process is considered essential.

After prolonged meditation, the meditator continues into the ''bardo'' or even towards enlightenment. Great masters are often cremated, and their ashes stored as relics in [[stupa]]s.

In Tibet, firewood was scarce, and the ground often not suitable for burial, so the unusual practice of feeding the body to vultures or other animals developed. Known in Tibetan as ''jhator'' and literally translated as "Alms to the Birds", this practice is known as [[Sky burial]]. One can see this also as an offering to these animals, a last act of generosity and detachment to one's own body.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2372">'''Burning the clavie''' is an ancient [[Scotland|Scottish]] custom still observed at [[Burghead]], a fishing village on the [[Moray Firth]]. The ''clavie'' is a collection of [[cask]]s split in two, lit as a [[bonfire]] in the evening of 11 January, i.e. New Year's Eve (in  Scotland, Hogmanay) by the [[Julian Calendar]]. One of these casks is joined together again by a huge nail (Latin ''clavis''; hence the term, it may also be from [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]] ''cliabh'', a basket used for holding combustibles). It is then filled with [[tar]], lighted and carried flaming round the village and finally up to a headland upon which stands the ruins of an [[altar]], locally called the ''Doorie''. It here forms the nucleus of the bonfire, which is built up of split casks. When the burning tar-barrel falls in pieces, the people scramble to get a lighted piece with which to kindle the New Year's fire on their cottage hearth. The [[charcoal]] of the ''clavie'' is collected and put in pieces up the cottage chimneys, to keep spirits and witches from coming down.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Clavie, Burning the|volume=6|page=469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:BurningOfTheClavie1(AnneBurgess)Jan1984.jpg|The Burning of the Clavie celebrates New Year's Eve, old style, which falls on 11 January (unless 11 January is a Sunday, in which case the celebration is held on 10 January). The Clavie is a half-cask, mounted securely on a pole, and filled with staves of wood and inflammable liquid.
Image:BurningOfTheClavie2(AnneBurgess)Jan1984.jpg|The burning Clavie is carried through the streets of the town by the members of the Clavie Crew, who must be natives of the town to qualify. It is followed by a procession of hundreds of onlookers. On the route through the town, the Clavie Crew hands pieces of the Clavie - smouldering pieces of wood - to householders to ensure good luck for the ensuing year.

The '''C R.M. 114 Discriminator''' is a fictional piece of critical radio equipment in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s film ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1964), the destruction of which prevents the crew of a [[B-52]] from hearing the recall code that would stop them from dropping their [[hydrogen bomb]]s on the [[Soviet Union]].

== Real-life parallels ==
In [[Peter George (author)|Peter George's]] novel, ''[[Red Alert (novel)|Red Alert]]'' (1958), which was the basis for the film, the device is called the '''CRM 114'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/index4.html#slot47 |title=What is the CRM-114 thing? |publisher=Visual-memory.co.uk |date=2002-02-22 |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Peter George was well-informed:  Under the U.S. military [[Joint Electronics Type Designation System]] (The "AN" System),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.net/usmilav/electronics.html |title=Designations Of U.S. Military Electronic And Communications Equipment |publisher=Designation-systems.net |date= |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; CRM is the designator for an air-transportable cargo (C) radio (R) maintenance or test assembly (M),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f-16.net/f-16_armament_article8.html |title=F-16 Armament - US Tri-Service Designation System Electronic Equipment |publisher=F-16.net |date= |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 114 is a feasible series number.  If the CRM 114 were an actual U.S. military item, its official number would be designated as AN/CRM-114.

&lt;blockquote&gt;To ensure the enemy cannot plant false transmissions and fake orders, once the attack orders have been passed and acknowledged, the CRM 114 is to be switched into the receiver circuit. The three code letters of the period are to be set on the alphabet dials of the CRM 114, which will then block any transmissions other than those preceded by the set letters from being fed into the receiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Kubrick FAQ|website=www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/index4.html#slot47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Prior to the introduction of addressed digital communications, some real-world analog communications systems performed a function very similar to the fictional CRM-114. Some aircraft radios used [[SELCAL]] (selective calling), which muted the receiver unless an assigned tone was received. Ground mobile radios used a similar system called [[CTCSS]] (Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System).

== Other uses ==
Kubrick also used a near [[homophone]] of "CRM 114", "Serum 114", for the name of a drug injected into Alex to help his reformation in ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (1971).

Other non-Kubrick works contain references to "CRM 114", in apparent homage to Kubrick:
*An amplifier in [[Dr. Emmett Brown]]'s laboratory in ''[[Back to the Future]]'' (1985) is labeled "CRM-114."
*In the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episode "[[Business as Usual (DS9 episode)|Business as Usual]]" (1997), "CRM-114" is a power hand weapon produced by the [[Breen (Star Trek)|Breen]], one that is "effective against moving vehicles and surface emplacements" and featuring a "quick recharge time."
*The 2005 remake of ''[[Fun with Dick and Jane (2005 film)|Fun with Dick and Jane]]'' includes a financial transaction form number "CRM-114".
* In the film ''[[Severance (film)|Severance]]'' (2006), a black comedy involving a weapons manufacturer team-building trip to Eastern Europe, a reference is made to their CRM-114 antipersonnel [[land mine]] that is apparently doing quite well.
* In the game [[HorrorClix]] (2006), the unit called "Carnage Bot" is also known by the code "CRM114", confirmed by game designer Seth Johnson to be a Kubrick reference.
*On the TV show ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'', "CRM 114" is the catalog code assigned to the Kensei sword that [[Hiro Nakamura|Hiro]] is searching for in the episode "[[Parasite (Heroes)|Parasite]]" (2007).  (In the ''[[Heroes 360 experience]]'' during the episode, it was confirmed that the reference was intentional.)  [[Malcolm McDowell]], the star of ''A Clockwork Orange'', also guest starred in this episode, as the current owner of the sword.
*CRM-114 is the ID for the bunker on the beach in ''[[Men In Black III]]'', as well as a prison block earlier in the movie.
*"[[CRM114 (program)|CRM114]]" is also the name of a 2005 computer program which uses a statistical approach for classifying data and is especially utilized for filtering email spam. It was named after the fictional device.
*CRM-114 and CRM-115 are the names of medicinal drugs in Jon S. Baird's 2013 film ''[[Filth (film)|Filth]]'', based on Irvine Welsh's [[Filth (novel)|novel]]. In the director's commentary, Baird states this is a tribute to Kubrick as his favorite director, who always used CRM-114.

The '''Carabayo''' are an [[uncontacted peoples|uncontacted people]] of [[Colombia]] living in at least three [[long house]]s, known as ''malokas'',&lt;ref name=monga/&gt; along the [[Rio Puré]] (now the [[Río Puré National Park]]) in the southeastern corner of the country. They live in the [[Amazonas Department]] of [[Colombia]]n [[Amazon rainforest]], near the border of [[Brazil]]. They share the protected National Park with the [[Passé people|Passé]] and [[Jumana people]].&lt;ref name=monga/&gt;

In the last 400 years, Carabayo people have had intermittent contact with outsiders, including violent attacks by slave traders and rubber extractors, resulting in their retreat from outside groups and increased isolation.&lt;ref name=monga/&gt;

==Name==
The Carabayo are also known as the Aroje or Yuri people. They are known as the ''Aroje'' to the [[Bora people]]. ''Maku'' and ''Macusa'' are pejorative [[Arawakan languages|Arawak]] terms applied to many local languages, not anything specific to Carabayo.

==Language==
{{main|Carabayo language}}
The Carabayo language appears to be a member of the [[Tikuna–Yuri languages|Tikuna–Yuri]] family.

==Legal protection==
In December 2011, President [[Juan Manuel Santos]] signed legal decree #4633, which guarantees uncontacted peoples such as the Carabayo the rights to their voluntary isolation, their traditional territories, and reparations if they face violence from outsiders.&lt;ref name=monga/&gt;

'''Clothed male, naked female''' ('''CMNF'''), or '''clothed male, nude female''', is female [[nudity]] in which one or more women are nude while one or more men are clothed. 

==In media==
Entertainment columnist [[Earl Wilson (columnist)|Earl Wilson]] details several experiences involving one-sided female nudity in his book ''Show Business Laid Bare.''&lt;ref&gt;''Show Business Laid Bare'', by Earl Wilson, {{ISBN|0-399-11276-6}}, New York, G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1974. Second Printing&lt;/ref&gt;  In the chapter titled "Cheri Caffaro: A Strange Interlewd," Wilson writes about his experience interviewing actress [[Cheri Caffaro]] while she was nude and he was fully dressed.&lt;ref&gt;The story can be found on pages 45-56 of the hardcover second printing of the book.&lt;/ref&gt;

One-sided female nudity has been a theme in art, particularly in [[orientalism|Orientalist]] paintings of the 19th century. A typical scene may be a depiction of [[sexual slavery|white slavery]] in which one or several nude female slaves are displayed before an audience of men at a [[slave market]]. The archetypal example of this type of scene is [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]'s ''[[The Slave Market (Gérôme painting)|The Slave Market]]'', in which a nude female slave is examined by a potential buyer. Another example is Gérôme's ''[[Phryne before the Areopagus|Phryné devant l'Areopage]]'' (''Phryne before the [[Areopagus]]'', 1861) which was based on the trial of [[Phryne]] before the Areopagus in ancient Greece. The [[odalisque]] (harem scene) was also a popular subject for depicting one-sided female nudity, although the clothed figures in the scene were not always male.

Outside of the Orientalist style, a scenario for one-sided female nudity in 19th-century art was the knight-errant, in which the [[damsel in distress]] was used to explore the erotic subtext of the powerful knight coming to the rescue of a helpless woman. The best known example of this is John Everett Millais' painting ''[[Knight Errant]]'', in which a nude woman has been tied to a tree and a knight is shown cutting her loose.

Another example is [[Édouard Manet]]'s ''[[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'' ("The Luncheon on the Grass"), in which a nude woman is depicted having lunch with two fully clothed men. The ''[[Concert Champêtre (Titian)|Pastoral Concert]]'' (c. 1510) attributed to [[Giorgione]] or his pupil [[Titian]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225139&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225139&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500816&amp;bmUID=1185639440044&amp;bmLocale=en From the Louvre Museum Official Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628061654/http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225139&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225139&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500816&amp;bmUID=1185639440044&amp;bmLocale=en |date=June 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been cited as an inspiration for Manet's painting.

A 1913 painting ''Adoration'' by [[William Strang]] presents a philosophical study of beauty, with the clothed soldier, painter, scholar, and elderly gentleman fascinated by the naked female subject.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10401">'''Counter-flow''' (also referred as contra-flow) is the movement of [[culture]]s from one place to another brought by mobile subjects (migrants) that can have a positive or negative impact or effect on society. It is no longer from "the west to the rest", but a two-way movement. Counter-flows can be seen through the media such as [[telenovelas]] ([[soap operas]]) and through gangs such as the [[Mara Salvatrucha]] (MS-13) from El Salvador. Daya Kishan Thussu defines contra-flow as:

{{quote|the semantic and imaginative referents for the institutional, cultural and political matrix of a world framed by processes of global cultural power and local negotiation: a world experienced through the [[identity politics]] of nations, individuals and cultures and negotiated through contestations of locality, nationality and global citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Thussu, Daya Kishan. "Media on the Move: Global flow and contra-flow". Routledge, 2007, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==
Unlike [[transculturation]], counter-flows (or contra-flow) is not the mixing or meshing of two cultures. Rather, contra-flow is about the movement of cultures, like a two-way traffic lane, where individuals are said to live "between cultures".&lt;ref&gt;Thussu, Daya Kishan. "Media on the Move: Global flow and contra-flow". Routledge, 2007, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The term contra-flow originated from the preceding peripheries of global media industries, designated "sub-altern flows".&lt;ref&gt;Thussu, Daya Kishan. "Media on the Move: Global flow and contra-flow". Routledge, 2007, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, contra-flows emerged because of the global mass media reversing the dominant Western, First World direction, in other words it is no longer from "the West to the rest",&lt;ref&gt;Thussu, Daya Kishan. "Media on the Move: Global flow and contra-flow". Routledge, 2007, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be said that counter-flows originated because of colonization and later on because of diaspora.

[[Colonization]] brought a new language and religious beliefs to the Americas. On the one hand, a new way of living was taken in by the indigenous people, but on the other, they retained part of their language that is still used today such as the words "[[maize]]" and "[[Avocado|aguacate]]", among others. Additionally, just like the indigenous people, colonizers acquired something from the colonized; they brought back with them goods from the Americans such as potatoes and corn. Through colonization, we can see counter-flows being born and take action because of the consumption, fluidity, and flexibility of culture in both directions, from the colonizer to the colonized and vice versa.

==Example of contra-flow media==

Contra or counter-flows, through media, have had a positive and negative impact on migrant communities. As mentioned before, counter-flows is the movement of culture, not only one way but a two-way movement. Furthermore, media is a major source of communication and information that reaches hundreds of homes across the country. The term counter-flows is especially applied and seen in the Latino communities located all throughout the United States.

A positive example of contra-flow media are telenovelas or soap operas. Telenovelas have become global because of the leading producers of telenovelas such as [[Televisa]] in Mexico, [[Venevision]] in Venezuela, and [[Globo TV]] in Brazil, reaching hundreds of homes all around the globe. Through these leading networks, migrant communities are able to obtain information and watch entertainment shows from their native land.

''[[Yo Soy Betty La Fea]]'', a telenovela originally from Colombia, has become a success not only in its native country but in more than seventy countries in three different continents.&lt;ref name="emilyhighet.com"&gt;Highet, Emily. "Yo Soy Betty La Fea is Beautiful in the United States." University of New South Wales, http://www.emilyhighet.com/uploads/5/8/4/2/5842260/yo_soy_betty_la_fea_is_beautiful_in_the_united_states.doc{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (p. 1)&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, for example, the telenovela aired on the [[Telemundo]] network for Latino communities in the United States. After its grand success, other United States networks became interested in creating or remaking the telenovela by naming it ''Ugly Betty'', but for an English-speaking audience. However, the producers of ''[[Ugly Betty]]'' made sure to still maintain the plot and some of the main characteristics from the original ''Yo Betty La Fea'' telenovela to retain the Hispanic fans and audience.&lt;ref&gt;Highet, Emily. "Yo Soy Betty La Fea is Beautiful in the United States." University of New South Wales, http://www.emilyhighet.com/uploads/5/8/4/2/5842260/yo_soy_betty_la_fea_is_beautiful_in_the_united_states.doc{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (p. 3)&lt;/ref&gt; By maintaining some of the characteristics, producers hope that the English-speaking Latino communities are able to relate with the main character, Betty, because of the fact that she is a Latino woman living in the United States with an immigrant father.

''Yo Soy Betty La Fea'' is a great example of contra-flow media because of the increasing exportation of telenovelas to the United States and other countries not familiar or culturally similar to Latin America. ''Ugly Betty'' also shows the reverse media imperialism which is "the term focused on the one-way flow of information from the United States to the rest of the world with complete disregard for the importance of counter-flows generated by television exporters in other parts of the world".&lt;ref name="emilyhighet.com"/&gt;

==La Mara Salvatrucha as counter-flows==
La [[Mara Salvatrucha]] is a negative example of counter-flow. This Latin gang originated from Los Angeles California after Salvadoran migrants left their country in the early 1980s due to the civil war. La Mara Salvatrucha (or MS-13) has a reputation of being the world's most dangerous gang. The flow of La Mara Salvatrucha gang members between the United States and El Salvador has created a transnational empire of power and control supported by violence. Members from MS-13 keep in constant contact with members in El Salvador. Among the criminal activities that they operate in both the US an El Salvador are robbery, muggings, extortion, drug trafficking, the distribution of weapons, human trafficking and murder. They are protective with their business empire while keeping in touch through technology. According to Tina Strickland the gang members stay in contact by "using disposable cell phones and the Internet, both of which are readily available at low cost".&lt;ref&gt;Strickland, S., Tina. “Mara Salvatrucha: A Threat to U.S. and Central American Security.” The World’s Most Threatening Terrorist Networks and Criminal Gangs, New York, Palgrave Macmillan, 2009, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the members do not have technological skills, but there are programs that help them navigate.

===La Mara in the media===
Through technology, the media has exposed society to issues that are occurring around the world. The media does not hesitate to expose violence through the news, Internet and newspaper magazines. The printing industry and images are a navigation chain to reach out to the world, and La Mara has been on top of the negative exposure. La Mara's exposure to the world has created fear among society. The gang’s history has appeared in different airings, from [[Fox News Channel]], and ''[[Gangland (TV series)|Gangland]]'' on the History Channel.  According to Strickland, "Deportations have helped create an 'unending chain' of gang members moving between the U.S. and Central America. ... it's a merry-go-round".&lt;ref&gt;Strickland, S., Tina. "Mara Salvatrucha: A Threat to U.S. and Central American Security". ''The World’s Most Threatening Terrorist Networks and Criminal Gangs''. New York, Palgrave Macmillan, 2009, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; Till this day the Salvadoran gang MS-13 is still considered a transnational group through their back and forth movement.

=== Related to counter-flows (or contra-flow) ===
'''Subaltern flows''': This idea is mentioned by Daya Kishan Thussu in his 2012 article "Mapping Global Media Flow and Contra-Flow". He described the subaltern flows as "originators of transnational media flows have a strong regional presence but are also aimed at audiences outside their primary constituency."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Thussu, Daya. "Mapping Global Media Flow and Contra-Flow". ''The Globalization Reader'', edited by Frank Lechner and John Boli. Fourth Edition ed., 352-357. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell，2012，p.408&lt;/ref&gt; To better describe "subaltern flows", he mentioned the [[CCTV-9]] as an example. CCTV-9 is an English language network of China Central Television broadcasting since 2011 because the official language used there is English. The potential viewers of CCTV-9 are in two major groups, the foreigner in China and the overseas Chinese. As Daya Kishan Thussu argued in 2012: "the expansion of CCTV-9, reflects the recognition by the Beijing authorities of the importance of the English language as the key to success for global commerce and communication and their strategy to bring Chinese public diplomacy to a global audience."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Dominant flows''': Daya Kishan Thussu explained this idea in his article "Mapping Global Media Flow and Contra-Flow" as "the US-led Western media, both online and offline, and in various forms –information, infotainment and entertainment – are global in their reach and influence."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Thussu, Daya. "Mapping Global Media Flow and Contra-Flow." In ''The Globalization Reader'', edited by Frank Lechner and John Boli. Fourth Edition ed., 352-357. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell，2012，p.407&lt;/ref&gt; He also provides three examples of "dominant media flows" in his article which is media from the United States that "available across the global"; media from Britain which is a "major presence in global media, particularly in the field of news and current affairs"; and Japanese animation which is "the only non-Western genre".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These are all considered as major dominant media flows that have extended their influence in a global content.

[[Marcus Tullius Cicero|Cicero]]'s '''''De Divinatione''''' (Latin, "Concerning [[Divination]]") is a philosophical treatise in two books written in 44&amp;nbsp;BC.  It takes the form of a [[dialogue]] whose [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]] are Marcus (speaking mostly in Book&amp;nbsp;II) and his brother [[Quintus Tullius Cicero|Quintus]]. Book I deals with Quintus' [[Apologetics|apology]] of divination (in line with his essentially [[Stoicism|Stoic]] beliefs), while Book II contains Marcus' refutation of these from his [[Academic]] philosophical standpoint. Cicero concerns himself in some detail with the types of divination, dividing them into the "inspired" type (Latin ''furor'', Gk. ''mania'', "madness"), especially dreams, and the type which occurs via some form of skill of interpretation (i.e., [[haruspicy]], [[extispicy]], [[augury]], [[astrology]], and other [[oracle]]s).

It is notable as one of posterity's primary sources on the workings of [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]].  It also includes a fragment of Cicero's poem on his own consulship.

==Contents==
''De Divinatione'' may be considered as a supplement to Cicero's ''[[De Natura Deorum]]''.&lt;ref name="dunlop253"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunlop|1827|p=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''De Divinatione'', Cicero professes to relate the substance of a conversation held at Tusculum with his brother, in which Quintus, following the principles of the [[Stoicism|Stoics]], supported the credibility of divination, while Cicero himself controverted it.&lt;ref name="dunlop253"/&gt; The dialogue consists of two books, in the first Quintus enumerates of the different kinds or classes of divination, with reasons in their favour.&lt;ref name="dunlop253"/&gt; The second book contains a refutation by Cicero of his brother's arguments.&lt;ref name="dunlop253"/&gt;

In the first book Quintus, after observing that divinations of various kinds have been common among all people, remarks that it is no argument against different forms of divination that we cannot explain how or why certain things happen.&lt;ref name="dunlop254"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunlop|1827|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sufficient, that we know from experience and history that they do happen.&lt;ref name="dunlop254"/&gt; He argues that although events may not always succeed as predicted, it does not follow that divination is not an art, any more than that medicine is not an art, because it does not always cure.&lt;ref name="dunlop254"/&gt; Quintus offers various accounts of the different kinds of omens, dreams, portents, and divinations.&lt;ref name="dunlop254"/&gt; He includes two remarkable dreams, one of which had occurred to Cicero and one to himself.&lt;ref name="dunlop254"/&gt; He also asks if Greek history with its various accounts of omens should be also considered a fable.&lt;ref name="dunlop254"/&gt;

In the second book Cicero provides arguments against auguries, auspices, astrology, lots, dreams, and every species of omens and prodigies.&lt;ref name="dunlop255"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunlop|1827|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; It concludes with a chapter on the evils of superstition, and Cicero's efforts to extirpate it.&lt;ref name="dunlop255"/&gt; The whole thread is interwoven by curious and interesting stories.&lt;ref name="dunlop255"/&gt;

==Quotes==
* Nothing so absurd can be said that some philosopher had not said it.  ({{lang-la|Sed nescio quo modo nihil tam absurde dici potest quod non dicatur ab aliquo philosophorum}}) (II, 119)
* That old saying by Cato is quite well known; he said he was surprised that one [[haruspex]] did not burst out laughing when he saw another one.  ({{lang-la|Vetus autem illud Catonis admodum scitum est, qui mirari se aiebat quod non rideret haruspex haruspicem cum vidisset}}) (II, 24, 51)

The '''Design Quality Indicator''' ('''DQI''') is a toolkit to measure, evaluate and improve the design quality of buildings.

Development of DQI was started by the [[Construction Industry Council]] (CIC) in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Page 6, Spencer, N. and Winch, G. (2002). ''How Buildings add value for clients'', London: Thomas Telford. {{ISBN|0-7277-3128-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initiated in response to the success of Key Performance Indicators devised for assessing construction process issues such as timely completion, financial control and safety on site by the construction industry's Movement for Innovation (M4I). The aim of the DQI systems was to ensure that the M4I's indicators of construction process were balanced by an assessment of the building as a product.&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, S. (2004) Preface to ''Designing Better Buildings: quality and value in the built environment'', London: Spon Press. {{ISBN|0-415-31525-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex was commissioned to develop the indicator tool, which was launched as an online resource on 1 October 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[[Construction Industry Council]]. ''[http://www.dqi.org.uk/DQI/Common/031001_Launch.pdf DQI Online – How well is your building designed?]'' 1 October 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004 the DQI received recognition from the [[Institute of Workplace and Facilities Management|British Institute of Facilities Management]] for the role of involving users in the design process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elsalvadorproject.org.uk/maps/downloads/2004/IStructE%20online.pdf|format=PDF|title= DQI online service gets recognition from BIFM – ''The Structural Engineer''|date= 2 November 2004|website=elsalvadorproject.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The DQI tool was made available to users in the United States in 2006, and an online American version was launched on 20 October 2008.

Unlike its forerunner the '''Housing Quality Indicator''' (HQI) system devised for the UK's Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) by the consultancy DEGW and published on open access in February 1999,&lt;ref&gt; Wheeler, P. (2004) 'Housing quality indicators in practice' in Macmillan, S. (2004) ''Designing Better Buildings: quality and value in the built environment'', London: Spon Press. {{ISBN|0-415-31525-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; the DQI system instead could be used only by approved facilitators. The criteria and the method of assessment, which though unacknowledged is a simple form of multi-attribute utility analysis, remained unaccessible to design teams and their clients unless they employed a facilitator licensed to use it. Guidance on using the HQI system can be found on the government website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/housing-quality-indicators|title=Housing quality indicators - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DQI version for hospitals is also on open access on the national archive.&lt;ref&gt;http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130124042007/http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/documents/digitalasset/dh_082085.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptual framework==
DQI applies a structured approach to assess design quality based on the model by the architect [[Vitruvius]], the Roman author of the earliest surviving theoretical treatise on building in Western culture, who described design in terms of ''utilitas, firmitas ''and ''venustas'', often translated as commodity, firmness and delight.&lt;ref&gt;Gann et al. (2003), ''Design Quality Indicator as a tool for thinking: Building Research and Information'', London: Spon Press. {{DOI|10.1080/0961321032000107564}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DQI uses a modern-day interpretation of these terms as:
*Functionality (''utilitas'') – the arrangement, quality and interrelationship of spaces and how the building is designed to be useful to all.
*Build Quality (''firmitas'') – the engineering performance of the building, which includes structural stability and the integration, safety and robustness of the systems, finishes and fittings.
*Impact (''venustas'') – the building’s ability to create a sense of place and have a positive effect on the local community and environment.

==Methodology==
DQI is completed by a range of stakeholders in the briefing and design stages of a building project, or on a completed building.  Stakeholders who participate include:
*Architects
*Building users (or potential users)
*Building clients
*[[Facilities manager]]s (or future facilities managers)
*[[Project manager]]s
*[[Quantity surveyor]]s ([[Cost engineering|Cost engineer]])
*[[Structural engineer|Structural]] and [[Building services engineering|building services engineers]]

DQI is applied in a facilitated workshop that is led by a certified DQI facilitator.

==Models and related approaches==
There are three models of design quality indicator:
*DQI which is applicable to all building types&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dqi.org.uk|title=DQI - Home|website=www.dqi.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*DQI for schools which is applicable to school buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dqi.org.uk/website/dqiforschools/default.aspa|title=Schools version of DQI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This model of DQI is being used on all current school projects in the UK&lt;ref&gt;[[Construction Industry Council]]. ''[http://www.cic.org.uk/newsevents/dqifs081205.pdf DQI for Schools Launched]'' 8 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and forms part of the [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] 'Minimum Design Standard' for new school buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment]]. ''[http://www.cabe.org.uk/design-review/schools/minimum-design-standard Minimum Design Standards Launched]'' May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
*DQI for health buildings which was released in beta format in June 2012 on the  DQI website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dqi.org.uk/website/healthbuildings/default.aspa&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dhikr''' (also ''Zikr, Zekr, Zikir, Jikir'', and variants; {{lang-ar|ذِكْر|ḏikr}} {{IPA-ar|ðɪkr|}}; plural {{lang|ar|أذكار}} ''aḏkār'' {{IPA-ar|ʔaðˈkɑːr|}}, meaning "[[:wikt:ذكر#Noun|mentioning]]")&lt;ref name="Modarresi"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi|authorlink=Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi|title=The Laws of Islam|date=26 March 2016|publisher=Enlight Press|isbn=978-0994240989|url=http://almodarresi.com/en/books/pdf/TheLawsofIslam.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2017|ref=Modarresi|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|470}}
are devotional acts in [[Islam]] in which short phrases or prayers are repeatedly recited silently within the mind or aloud. It can be counted on a set of [[prayer beads]] (''[[Misbaha]]'' {{lang|ar|مِسْبَحَة}}) or in ones head. A person who recites the Dhikr is called a ''ḏākir'' ({{IPA-ar|ˈðaːkɪr|}} {{lang|ar|ذاكر}}).
''[[Tasbih]]'' ({{lang|ar|تسبيح}}) is a form of dhikr that involves the repetitive utterances of short sentences glorifying God.
The content of the prayers includes  the [[names of God in Islam|names of God]], or a ''[[dua|duʿāʾ]]'' (prayer of supplication) taken from the [[hadith]] or the [[Quran]].

[[File:Isma allah zat-new.png|thumb|right|Allah as having been written on the disciple's heart according to Sarwari Qadri Order]]

== Importance ==
There are several verses in the Quran that emphasize the importance of remembering the will of God by saying phrases such as "God willing," "God knows best," and "If it is your will.' This is the basis for dhikr. [[Sura]] 18 ([[Al-Kahf]]), [[ayah]] 24 states a person who forgets to say, "God Willing," should immediately remember God by saying, "May my Lord guide me to do better next time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|18|24|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other verses include [[sura]] 33 ([[Al-Ahzab]]), ayah 41, "O ye who believe! Celebrate the praises of Allah, and do this often,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|33|41|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sura 13 ([[Ar-Ra'd]]), ayah 28, "They are the ones whose hearts rejoice in remembering God. Absolutely, by remembering God, the hearts rejoice."&lt;ref name="quran1328"&gt;{{Cite quran|13|28|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad said, 'The best [dhikr] is ''La ilaha illa’llah'' ("there is no God but God"), and the best supplicatory prayer is ''Al-hamdu li’llah'' ("praise be to God").&lt;ref&gt;Razi, Najm al-Din. The Path of God’s Bondsman: From Origin to Return. Trans. Hamid Algar. North Haledon, New Jersey: Islamic Publications International, 1980. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muslim|Muslims]] believe dhikr is one of the best ways to enter the higher level of [[Jannah|Heaven]] and to glorify the [[Tawhid|Oneness]] of [[Allah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dhikr, remembrance of God|url = http://sunnah.org/ibadaat/dhikr.htm|website = sunnah.org|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To Sufis, dhikr is seen as a way to gain spiritual enlightenment and achieve union (''visal'') or annihilation (''fana'') in God. All Muslim sects endorse individual rosaries as a method of meditation, the goal of which is to obtain a feeling of peace, separation from worldly values ([[dunya]]), and, in general, strengthen [[Iman (concept)|Iman]] (faith).{{cn|date=January 2015}}

== Common phrases ==
{{unreferenced-section|date=January 2015}}
There are several phrases that are usually read when remembering Allah. Here are a few:

* [[Allāh]]- الله is the Arabic word for God  and mentioned in Quran most of the verses.
* [[Takbir|Allāhu ʾakbar]] (Takbir) - الله أَكْبَر means "[[God in Islam|God]] is greater" or "God is the greatest"
* [[Subhan Allah]] (Tasbih) - سبحان الله means "Glory be to God" or "How pure is God" or "Exalted be God"
* [[Alhamdulillah]] (Tahmid) - الحمد لله means "All praise is due to God", an expression of [[gratitude]]
* [[Tahlil|Lā ʾilāha ʾillā llah]] (Tahlil) - لا إله إلا الله means "There is no god but Allah"
* [[Hawqala|Lā ḥawla wa-lā quwwata ʾillā bi-llāh]] (Hawqala) - لا حول ولاقوة إلا بالله means "There is no power or strength except with God."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://islam.ru/en/content/story/dhikr-and-tasbih-sunnah|title=Dhikr and tasbih from the Sunnah {{!}} islam.ru|website=islam.ru|language=en|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Basmala|Bi-smi llāhi r-raḥmāni r-raḥīm]] (Basmala) - means "In the name of God, the gracious, the merciful", said before anything of spiritual significance ; e.g. eating, [[wudhu]], [[salaat]], rising from and going to sleep, before work, etc.
* ʾastaġfiru llāh (Istighfar) - means "I seek forgiveness from Allah".
* Audhubillah (Ta'uidh) - means "I seek refuge in Allah".
* Laa ilaaha illal laahu wahdahoo laa sharikalahoo lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu wa huwa 'alaa kulli shai'in qadeer - means "There is no god but Allah, alone, without partner. His is the sovereignty, and His the praise, and He has power over everything".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sunnahaday.wordpress.com/2010/07/12/sunnah-83-la-ilaha-ila-allah-wahdahu-la-sharika-lah-lahu-al-mulk-wa-lahu-al-hamd-wa-huwa-ala-kulli-shay%E2%80%99in-qadir/|title=Sunnah 83: la ilaha ila Allah wahdahu la sharika lah, lahu al-mulk wa lahu al-hamd, wa huwa `ala kulli shay’in qadir|date=2010-07-12|work=A Sunnah A Day|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* SubhanAllah wa biHamdihi - means "Glory be to Allah and Praise Him".
* SubhanAllahi wa biHamdihi, Subhan-Allahi 'l-`adheem (Glory be to Allah, and Praise Him, Glory be to Allah, the Supreme) 

Some of these can be said together.e.g- 
* Subhan'Allahi wal hamdulillaahi wa laa ilaaha ilallaahu wAllahu Akbar - means "Glory be to Allah, All Praise is for Allah, There is No God but Allah, Allah is the Greatest".
* Subhan'Allahi wal hamdulillaahi wa laa ilaaha ilallaahu wAllahu Akbar wa laa hawla wa laa quwwata illaa billaahil 'aleeul azeem.
* Laa ilaaha illal laahu wahdahoo laa sharikalahoo lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu wa huwa 'alaa kulli shai'in qadeer - means "There is No God But Allah Alone, who has no partner. His is the dominion and His is the raise, and He is Able to do all things".
* Subhan'Allahi wal hamdulillaahi wa laa ilaaha ilallaahu wAllahu Akbar wa laa hawla wa laa quwwata illaa billaahil 'aleeul azeem.
* Laa ilaaha illa Anta, subhaanaka inni kuntu min al-zaalimeen (There is no God but Allah, Glory to You, verily I was one of the wrongdoers).

== Quran as Dhikr ==

Reciting the Quran sincerely is also considered a kind of Dhikr. &lt;br /&gt;
e.g.- 
* Reciting Sura Ikhlas / Tawheed (Sura 112) is equal to one-third of the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=al-Bukhaari|pages=4628}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reciting Sura Ikhlas 10 times gives a palace in Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Saheeh al-Jaami’ al-Sagheer|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=6472|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reciting Sura Kaafiroon (Sura 109) is equal to one-fourth of the Quran. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mu’jam Al-Kabeer|pages=13319}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reciting Sura Nasr (Sura 110) is equal to one-fourth of the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tafsir Ibn Kathir}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reciting Sura Zalzalah is equal to half of the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tafsir Ibn Kathir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote |text="Shall I tell you about the best of deeds, the most pure in the Sight of your Lord, about the one that is of the highest order and is far better for you than spending gold and silver, even better for you than meeting your enemies in the battlefield where you strike at their necks and they at yours?" The companions replied, "Yes, O Messenger ﷺ of Allah!" He replied, '''"Remembrance of Allah''' ﷻ". |source=''at-Tirmidhi''}}

It is mentioned in hadith that where people are oblivious to dhikir, remembrance of Allah is like being steadfast in jihad when others are running away (Targhib, p. 193, vol. 3 ref. Bazar and Tibrani).

== Sufi view ==
{{Sufism}}
{{See also|Sema}}
Followers of Sufism often engage in ritualized dhikr ceremonies, the details of which sometimes vary between Sufi orders or ''[[tariqah]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Friedlander, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Each order, or lineage within an order, has one or more forms for group dhikr, the [[liturgy]] of which may include [[Quran reading|recitation]], [[singing]], [[Islamic music|music]], [[dance]], [[Islam and clothing|costume]]s, [[Religious use of incense|incense]], ''[[muraqaba]]'' (meditation), [[religious ecstasy|ecstasy]], and [[altered state of consciousness|trance]].&lt;ref&gt;Touma, p.162.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the extent, usage and acceptability of many of these elements vary from order to order - with many condemning the usage of instruments (considered unlawful by most scholars)&lt;ref&gt;In his "The Whirling Dervishes and Orthodox Islam" the Nuh Ha Mim Keller (an indisputed shaykh of the Hashimi-Shadhili order) criticizes the common usage of music by the contemporary Turkish branch of the Mevlavi order in particular - arguing that the Sufis are not exempt from following Islamic law. See [http://shadhilitariqa.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=54&amp;Itemid=23 The Whirling Dervishes and Orthodox Islam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402144655/http://shadhilitariqa.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=54&amp;Itemid=23 |date=2012-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and intentional loss of control. In addition, costumes are quite uncommon and is almost exclusively unique to the [[Mevlevi Order|Mevlavi]] order in Turkey - which is an official cultural "heritage" of the secular Turkish state. In Sufism, group dhikr does not necessarily entail all of these forms.

The most common forms of Sufi group dhikr consist in the recital of particular litanies (e.g. [http://www.dar-sirr.com/Tijanism/Hizb-Al-Bahr.htm Hizb al-Bahr] of the Shadhilis), a composition of Quranic phrases and Prophetic supplications (e.g. [https://www.amazon.com/Prophetic-Invocations-Imam-Al-Haddad/dp/1929694105 Wird al-Latif] of the [[Ba 'Alawi tariqa|Ba `Alawis]]), or a liturgical repetition of various formula and prayers (e.g. al-Wadhifa of the [[Tijani]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Litany of Tijani Prayers|url=http://www.dar-sirr.com/Tijanism/litanies.html|accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;). All of these forms are referred to as a "hizb" (''pl.'' "ahzab") or a "wird" (''pl.'' "awrad"). This terminological usage is important as some critics often mistakenly believe that the word hizb only refers to a [[Juz'|portion]] of the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Ahmad al-Tijani is often unfairly criticized for saying that the ''Salat al-Fatih'' which he instructed his students to recite is "more valuable than a ''hizb''". This "''hizb''" that he was referring to was not a ''hizb'' of the Quran, but a ''hizb'' of the ''[[Dala'il al-Khayrat]]'' which was so commonly recited in Tijani's time that many people recited the entire composition several times a day.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many recite extended prayers upon Muhammad (known as [[durood]]) of which the [[Dala'il al-Khayrat]] is perhaps the most popular. Though common to almost all Sufi orders, some (such as the [[Naqsbandi]]s) prefer to perform their dhikr silently - even in group settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahmad|first=Zulfaqir|title=Wisdom for the Seeker|location=Concerning the Dhikr of the Naqsbandi-Mujaddid Tariqa|url=http://www.tasawwuf.org/writings/wisdom_seeker/wisdom_letter2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, most gatherings are held on Thursday or Sunday nights as part of the institutional practices of the tariqah (since Thursday is the night marks the entrance of the Muslim "holy" day of Friday and Sundays are a convenient congregational time in most contemporary societies) - though people who don't live near their official [[Khanqah|zawiya]] gather whenever is convenient for the most people.

Another type of group dhikr ceremony that is most commonly performed in [[Arab World|Arabic countries]] is called the [[haḍra]] (''lit''. presence).&lt;ref&gt;In earlier orders, the "presence" referred to was that of God, but since the 18th century it has been considered to be the spiritual presence of Muhammad (John L. Esposito, "Hadrah." The Oxford Dictionary of Islam. Oxford Islamic Studies Online. Web. 3 Apr. 2010.) The shifting focus, however, is not shared by all and is a result of the Sufi reforms which sought to mitigate the heretical belief of [[theopanism]] committed by some Sufi claimants through a greater focus on the spirit and active life of Muhammad instead of a metaphorical union with God.(Ira Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, p. 210)&lt;/ref&gt; The haḍra is a communal gathering for dhikr and its associated liturgical rituals, prayers, and song recitals, performing both in private or public. Though the haḍra is popular (in part because of the controversy surrounding it), it is mostly practiced in North Africa, the Middle-East and Turkey. In [[Turkey]] this ceremony is called "Zikr-i Kiyam" (Standing dhikr) and "imara" in Algeria and Morocco. In places like Syria where Sufis are a visible part of the fabric and psyche of society, each order typically has their private gathering on one day and will participate in a public haḍra at a central location to which both the affiliated and unaffiliated alike are invited as an expression of unity. Similar public ceremonies occur in Turkey, Egypt, Algeria and Morocco.

[[File:Dhikr hadrah articulation.PNG|thumb|Dhikr hadrah articulation, upward beams indicating inhalation and downward beams indicating exhalation &lt;ref name="Touma, p.165"/&gt;]]

For those who perform it, the haḍra marks the [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] of the Sufi's gathering regardless of any teaching or [[musical form|formal]] structure - it often follows a formal teaching session as a way of internalizing the lessons. Musically, the structure of the haḍra includes several secular [[Arabic music|Arab genres]] (each of which expresses a different emotion) and can last for hours.&lt;ref name="Touma, p.165"&gt;Touma, p.165.&lt;/ref&gt; It is directed by the [[sheikh]] of the tariqa or one of his representatives; monitoring the intensity, depth and duration of the phases of the haḍra, the sheikh aims to draw the circle into deep awareness of God and away from the participants own individuatedness. The dhikr ceremonies may have a ritually determined length or may last as long as the Sheikh deems his [[murid]]s require. The haḍra section consists of the [[ostinato]]-like repetition of the name of God over which the soloist performs a richly ornamented song. In many haḍras, this repetition proceeds from the chest and has the effect of a percussion instrument, with the participants bending forward while exhaling and stand straight while inhaling so that both the movement and sound contribute to the overall rhythm. The climax is usually reached through cries of "Allah! Allah!" or "hu hu" (which is either the pronoun "he" or the last vowel on the word "Allah" depending on the method) while the participants are moving up and down. Universally, the haḍra is almost always followed by Quranic recital in the [[tarteel]] style - which according to [[Junayd Baghdadi|al-Junayd al-Baghdadi]], was a prophetic instruction received through a dream.

More common than the haḍra is the [[Sema|sama]]` (''lit''. audition), a type of group ceremony that consist mostly of the audition of spiritual poetry and Quranic recitation in an emotionally charged manner; and thus is not dhikr is the technical sense the word implies. However, the same debate over certain matters of decorum apply as exists with the haḍra. Even though group dhikr is popular and makes up the spiritual life of most Sufi adherents, other more private forms of dhikr are performed more routinely - usually consisting of the order's ''wird'' (daily litany) - which adherents usually recite privately, even if gathered together. So although group dhikr is seen as a hallmark of Sufism, the Sufis themselves practice the same private forms of worship that other Muslims practice, though usually more frequently and methodically; group dhikr is a less frequent occurrence and is not the end-all-and-be-all of Sufism, as some Sufi orders do not even perform it.

=== Sufi meaning ===
Dhikr takes on a wide range and various layers of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah Jawadi Amuli, ''[http://basirat.ca/basirat/dhikr_and_the_wisdom_behind_it/ Dhikr and the Wisdom Behind It]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In some [[Sufism|Sufi]] orders it is instituted as a ceremonial activity. In ''[[tasawwuf]]'' (Islamic mysticism or [[Sufism]]) dhikr is most likely the most frequent form of prayer. Among the orders of Muslims that practice dhikr, there are some who advocate silent, individual prayer, while others join together in an outward, group expression of their love for God.&lt;ref&gt;Gardet, L.  Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Brill, 2010. Web. 4 Apr. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a number of hadiths that give emphasis to remembrance of God.&lt;ref&gt;Naqshbandi Sufi Way. Naqshbandi-Haqqani Sufi Order of America, 2010. Web. April 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dhikr in Sufism ===
Dhikr is given great importance by some Sufi writers, among them is [[Najm-al-Din Razi]] who wrote about dhikr in the context of what it combats. In contrast to the virtues of remembrance, Razi uses the perils of forgetfulness to show the importance of dhikr. The soul and the world are veils that make people forget God.&lt;ref&gt;Naqshbandi Sufi Way. Naqshbandi-Haqqani Sufi Order of America, 2010. Web. 3 Apr. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Naqshbandi Haqqani Sufi Order]] of America says this about dhikr: {{quotation|Dhikr is the means by which Stations yield their fruit, until the seeker reaches the Divine Presence. On the journey to the [[Divine presence|Divine Presence]] the seed of remembrance is planted in the heart and nourished with the water of praise and the food of glorification, until the tree of dhikr becomes deeply rooted and bears its fruit. It is the power of all journeying and the foundation of all success. It is the reviver from the sleep of heedlessness, the bridge to the One remembered.}}&lt;ref&gt;Geels, Antoon. "A Note on the Psychology of dhikr: The Halveti-Jerrahi Order of Dervishes in Istanbul." the ''[[International Journal for the Psychology of Religion]]'', 6.4, 229-251 (1996). ATLA.

There are some Sufi orders, such as the [[Shadhili]], that perform a ritualized form of dhikr in groups termed "[[haḍra]]" (''lit''. presence) - the details of which are discussed below. Another method of dhikr, but which is most commonly associated with Sufism, is the repetition of the Arabic name "Allah Hu". Sufi orders have similar practices - some with similar visualizations and others choosing to focus only on the attachment of their heart to the One they are invoking. Though this is associated almost exclusively with Sufism in modern times, many of the Quranic exegesis of the past approved of the practice (e.e. [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] in his ''[[Tafsir al-Kabir (al-Razi)|Mafatih al-Ghayb]]''), which confirms that it has a basis in orthodoxy.

== Prayer beads ==
Known also as ''[[Tasbih]]'', these are usually ''[[Misbaha]]'' ([[prayer beads]]) upon a string, 99 or 100 in number, which correspond to the names of God in Islam and other recitations. The beads are used to keep track of the number of recitations that make up the dhikr.

When the dhikr involves the repetition of particular phrases a specific number of times, the beads are used to keep track so that the person performing dhikr can turn all of their focus on what is actually being said - as it can become difficult to concentrate simultaneously on the number and phrasing when one is doing so a substantial number of times.

In the United States, Muslim inmates are allowed to utilize [[prayer beads]] for therapeutic effects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.buffalo.edu/Academics/courses/704/prisonlaw/readings/9alameen.html United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311210028/http://www.law.buffalo.edu/Academics/courses/704/prisonlaw/readings/9alameen.html |date=2007-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Alameen v. Coughlin, 892 F. Supp. 440 (E.D.N.Y 1995), Imam Hamzah S. Alameen, a/k/a Gilbert Henry, and Robert Golden brought suit against Thomas A. Coughlin III, etc., et alia (Head of the Department of Corrections) in the [[New York (state)|State of New York]] pursuant to 28 [[United States Code|USC]] @ 1983.  The plaintiffs argued that prisoners have a [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] [[Constitutional right]] to pursue Islamic healing therapy called KASM (قاسَمَهُ | qaasama | taking an oath ) which uses [[prayer beads]].  The rosary of oaths, which Alameen developed, was used to successfully rehabilitate inmates suffering from co-occurring mental health challenges and substance abuse issues during the 1990s.  All people, including Muslims and Catholics, were allowed to use [[prayer beads]] inside prisons, lest their freedom of religion be violated when the prison administration forbade their possession as contraband in the penal system. The practice of carrying [[prayer beads]] became controversial when gang-members began carrying specific colors of [[prayer beads]] to identify themselves.

'''Entertainment''' is a form of activity that holds the attention and [[Interest (emotion)|interest]] of an [[audience]], or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (Oxford University Press, 1971, Vol 1 pp.&amp;nbsp;213–14) gives Latin and French origins for the word, including ''inter'' (among) + ''tenir'' (to hold) as derivations, giving translations of "to hold mutually" or "to hold intertwined" and "to engage, keep occupied, the [[attention]] thoughts or time (of a person)". It also provides words like "merry-making", "pleasure", "delight", as well as "to receive as a guest and show hospitality to". It cites a 1490 usage by [[William Caxton]].&lt;/ref&gt; Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. [[Storytelling]], [[music]], [[drama]], [[dance]], and different kinds of [[performance]] exist in all cultures, were supported in [[Court (royal)|royal courts]], developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an [[entertainment industry]] that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a [[banquet]] adapted for two; to any size or type of [[party]], with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.

The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with [[amusement]], so that one common understanding of the idea is [[fun]] and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of [[ceremony]], celebration, [[religious festival]], or [[satire]] for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving [[insight]] or intellectual growth.

An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private [[recreation]] or [[leisure]] activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a [[Play (theatre)|play]], [[opera]], [[television show]], or [[film]]; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of [[game]]s, where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of [[theatre]] or [[concert]]s; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of [[List of traditional children's games|children's games]]. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion for example with [[Magic (illusion)|stage magic]]. Films and [[video game]]s, for example, although they use newer media, continue to [[storytelling|tell stories]], present drama, and play music. [[Festival]]s devoted to [[music festival|music]], [[Film festival|film]], or [[Competitive dance|dance]] allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.

Some activities that were once considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as [[fencing]] or [[archery]], once necessary skills for some, have become serious [[sport]]s and even [[professional|professions]] for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as [[cooking]], have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.

The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative [[remix]]. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.

== Psychology and philosophy ==
Entertainment can be distinguished from other activities such as [[education]] and [[marketing]] even though they have learned how to use the appeal of entertainment to achieve their different goals. The importance and impact of entertainment is recognised by scholars&lt;ref&gt;For example, the application of psychological models and theories to entertainment is discussed in Part III of {{cite book|last=Bryant|first=Jennings|title=Psychology of Entertainment|year=2006|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|isbn=0-8058-5238-7|pages=367–434|author2=Vorderer, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sayre&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFSayreKing2010|last=Sayre|first=Shay|title=Entertainment and Society: Influences, Impacts, and Innovations (Google eBook)|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxon, New York|isbn=0-415-99806-9|edition=2nd|author2=King, Cynthia}} p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; and its increasing sophistication has influenced practices in other fields such as [[museology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Conservation, Education, Entertainment?|year=2011|publisher=Channel View Publication|isbn=978-1-84541-164-0|editor=Frost, Warwick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Museum Revolutions|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxon, New York|isbn=0-203-93264-1|authors=Macleod, Suzanne; Watson, Sheila|editor=Knell, Simon J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists say the function of media entertainment is "the attainment of [[gratification]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zillmann|first=Dolf|title=Media Entertainment –  the psychology of its appeal|year=2000|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. Taylor &amp; Francis e-library (2009)|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|isbn=0-8058-3324-2|page=vii|author2=Vorderer, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; No other results or measurable benefit are usually expected from it (except perhaps the final score in a sporting entertainment). This is in contrast to education (which is designed with the purpose of developing understanding or helping people to learn) and marketing (which aims to encourage people to purchase commercial products). However, the distinctions become blurred when education seeks to be more "entertaining" and entertainment or marketing seek to be more "educational". Such mixtures are often known by the [[neologism]]s "[[edutainment]]" or "[[infotainment]]". The psychology of entertainment as well as of learning has been applied to all these fields.&lt;ref&gt;For example, marketers mix commercial messages with non-commercial messages in entertainments on radio, television, films, videos and games. {{cite book|last=Shrum|first=L.J.J.|title=The Psychology of Entertainment Media|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-84872-944-5|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some education-entertainment is a serious attempt to combine the best features of the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Entertainment-Education and Social Change: History, Research, and Practice|year=2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=1-4106-0959-6|editors=Singhal, Arvind; Cody, Michael J.; Rogers, Everett; Sabido, Miguel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Digital Games and Learning |year=2011 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |location=London; New York |isbn=978-1-4411-9870-9 |editor1-last=de Freitas |editor1-first=Sara |editor2-last=Maharg |editor2-first=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people are entertained by others' pain or the idea of their unhappiness ([[schadenfreude]]).

An entertainment might go beyond gratification and produce some insight in its audience.  Entertainment may skillfully consider universal philosophical questions such as: "What is the meaning of life?"; "What does it mean to be human?"; "What is the right thing to do?"; or "How do I know what I know?". Questions such as these drive many narratives and dramas, whether they are presented in the form of a story, film, play, poem, book, dance, comic, or game. Dramatic examples include [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s influential play ''[[Hamlet]]'', whose hero articulates these concerns in [[poetry]]; and films, such as ''[[The Matrix]]'', which explores the nature of knowledge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Irwin|editor-first=William|title=The Matrix and Philosophy|year=2002|publisher=Carus Publishing Company|location=Peru, Illinois|page=196|isbn=0-8126-9502-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released world-wide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_ql_9 IMDb ''The Matrix'' worldwide release dates]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Novel]]s give great scope for investigating these themes while they entertain their readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Peter|title=Philosophy and the Novel|year=1975|location=Oxford, Clarendon}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a creative work that considers philosophical questions so entertainingly that it has been presented in a very wide range of forms is ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. Originally a [[radio comedy]], this story became so popular that it has also appeared as a novel, film, television series, stage show, comic, [[audiobook]], [[LP record]], [[adventure game]] and [[online game]], its ideas became popular references (see [[Phrases from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]) and has been translated into many languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Simpson, M.J. |title=The Pocket Essential Hitchhiker's Guide |edition=2nd |publisher=Pocket Essentials |year=2005 |isbn=1-904048-46-3 |page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its themes encompass the [[meaning of life]], as well as "the [[ethics]] of entertainment, [[artificial intelligence]], multiple worlds, God, and [[philosophical method]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Joll|editor-first=Nicholas|title=Philosophy and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire; New York|isbn=978-0-230-29112-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "ancient craft of communicating events and experiences, using words, images, sounds and gestures" by telling a story&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gakhar|first=Sonia|title=The influence of storytelling on pre-service students' attitudes and intentions (MSc Thesis)|year=2007|publisher=Iowa State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; is not only the means by which people passed on their cultural values and traditions and history from one generation to another, it has been an important part of most forms of entertainment ever since the earliest times. Stories are still told in the early forms, for example, around a fire while [[camping]], or when listening to the stories of another culture as a [[tourist]]. "The earliest storytelling sequences we possess, now of course, committed to writing, were undoubtedly originally a speaking from mouth to ear and their force as entertainment derived from the very same elements we today enjoy in films and novels."&lt;ref name=Kuhns&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhns|first=Richard Francis|title=Decameron and the Philosophy of Storytelling: Author as Midwife and Pimp|year=2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York; Chichester West Sussex|isbn=0-231-13608-0|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storytelling is an activity that has evolved and developed "toward variety".&lt;ref name=Kuhns/&gt; Many entertainments, including storytelling but especially music and drama, remain familiar but have developed into a wide variety of form to suit a very wide range of personal preferences and cultural expression. Many types are blended or supported by other forms. For example, drama, stories and banqueting (or dining) are commonly enhanced by music; sport and [[game]]s are incorporated into other activities to increase appeal. Some may have evolved from serious or necessary activities (such as [[running]] and [[jumping]]) into competition and then become entertainment. It is said, for example, that [[pole vault]]ing "may have originated in the Netherlands, where people used long poles to vault over wide canals rather than wear out their clogs walking miles to the nearest bridge. Others maintain that pole vaulting was used in warfare to vault over fortress walls during battle."&lt;ref name=Carlsen&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlsen|first=Spike|title=A Splintered History of Wood|year=2009|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-137356-5|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equipment for such sports has become increasingly sophisticated. Vaulting poles, for example, were originally made from woods such as [[Fraxinus|ash]], [[hickory]] or [[hazel]];  in the 19th century [[bamboo]] was used and in the 21st century poles can be made of [[Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon fibre]].&lt;ref name=Carlsen/&gt; Other activities, such as [[Stilts|walking on stilts]], are still seen in [[circus]] performances in the 21st century. [[Gladiator|Gladiatorial combats]], also known as "gladiatorial games", popular during Roman times, provide a good example of an activity that is a combination of sport, punishment, and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= Gladiators: violence and spectacle in ancient Rome|author = Dunkle, Roger| year= 2008| location = Harlow, England; New York| publisher = Pearson/Longman| isbn = 9781405807395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=Medieval Sport: Quest for Survival | author1=Wiseman, Douglas C. | year=1977  | publisher=Distributed by ERIC Clearinghouse Microfiche }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes to what is regarded as entertainment can occur in response to cultural or historical shifts. Hunting wild animals, for example, was introduced into the [[Roman Empire]] from [[Carthage]] and became a popular public entertainment and spectacle, supporting an international trade in wild animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Potter|first=David Stone|title=Life, Death, and Entertainment in the Roman Empire|year=1999|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0-472-10924-3|page=308|author2=Mattingly, David J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entertainment also evolved into different forms and expressions as a result of social upheavals such as wars and revolutions. During the Chinese [[Cultural Revolution]], for example, [[Revolutionary opera]] was sanctioned by the Communist party and [[World War I]], the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Russian revolution]] all affected entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roshwald|first=Aviel|title=European Culture in the Great War: The Arts, Entertainment and Propaganda, 1914–1918|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-57015-8|author2=Stites, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heinrich|first=Anselm|title=Heinrich, Entertainment, propaganda, education: regional theatre in Germany and Britain between 1918 and 1945|year=2007|publisher=University of Hertfordshire Press|location=Hatfield, England|isbn=978-1-902806-74-7|editor=Meech, Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arthur|first=Max|title=When this bloody war is over: soldiers' songs from the First World War|year=2001|publisher=Piatkus|location=London|isbn=0-7499-2252-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="David Horn, Dave Laing, Paul Oliver, Peter Wicke, Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Part 1 Media, Industry, Society,"&gt;{{cite book|title=Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Part 1 Media, Industry, Society|year=2003|publisher=Continuum|isbn=0-8264-6321-5|authors=Laing, Dave; Oliver, Paul; Wicke, Peter|editor=Horn, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McReynolds|first=Louise|title=Russia at Play: Leisure Activities at the End of the Tsarist Era|year=2003|publisher=Cornell University|isbn=0-8014-4027-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relatively minor changes to the form and venue of an entertainment continue to come and go as they are affected by the period, fashion, culture, technology, and economics. For example, a story told in dramatic form can be presented in an open-air theatre, a [[music hall]], a [[Movie theater|movie theatre]], a [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]], or as technological possibilities advanced, via a personal electronic device such as a [[tablet computer]]. Entertainment is provided for mass audiences in purpose-built structures such as a [[Theater (structure)|theatre]], [[auditorium]], or [[stadium]]. One of the most famous venues in the Western world, the [[Colosseum]], "dedicated [[Before common era|AD]]&amp;nbsp;80 with a hundred days of games, held fifty thousand spectators," and in it audiences "enjoyed "blood sport with the trappings of stage shows".{{sfnp|ref=harv|McDonald Walton|2007|p=51}} [[Spectacle]]s, competitions, [[Racing|races]], and sports were once presented in this purpose-built arena as public entertainment. New stadia continue to be built to suit the ever more sophisticated requirements of global audiences.

=== Court entertainment ===
[[File:Codex Manesse 192v - Albrecht von Rapperswil.jpg|thumb|left|Tournament before an audience and musicians (14th century)]]
[[File:Ralph Hedley The tournament 1898.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ralph Hedley]] ''The Tournament'' (1898) Children adapting a courtly entertainment]]
Imperial and royal courts have provided training grounds and support for professional entertainers, with different cultures using palaces, castles and forts in different ways. In the [[Maya civilization|Maya city states]], for example, "spectacles often took place in large plazas in front of palaces; the crowds gathered either there or in designated places from which they could watch at a distance."&lt;ref name=Walthall&gt;{{cite book|title=Servants of the Dynasty: Palace Women in World History|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-520-25443-5|editor=Walthall, Anne|ref=CITEREFWalthall2008}} pp.&amp;nbsp;4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Court entertainments also crossed cultures. For example, the [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] was introduced to India by the [[Mughal emperors|Mughals]], and passed onto the [[British Empire]], which then followed Indian tradition: "institutions, titles, customs, ceremonies by which a [[Maharaja]] or [[Nawab]] were installed&amp;nbsp;... the exchange of official presents&amp;nbsp;... the order of precedence", for example, were "all inherited from&amp;nbsp;... the Emperors of Delhi".&lt;ref name="Indian Princes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Charles|authorlink = Charles Allen (writer)|last2 = Dwivedi|first2=Sharada|authorlink2 = Sharada Dwivedi|title=Lives of the Indian Princes|year=1984|publisher=Century Publishing|location=London|isbn=0-7126-0910-5|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Korea, the "court entertainment dance" was "originally performed in the palace for entertainment at court banquets."&lt;ref name="Van Zile"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Van Zile|first=Judy|title=Perspectives on Korean Dance|year=2001|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, Connecticut|isbn=0-8195-6494-X}} p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Court entertainment often moved from being associated with the court to more general use among [[commoner]]s. This was the case with "masked dance-dramas" in Korea, which "originated in conjunction with village [[Shamanism|shaman]] rituals and eventually became largely an entertainment form for commoners".{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=9}} [[Nautch]] dancers in the Mughal Empire performed in Indian courts and palaces. Another evolution, similar to that from courtly entertainment to common practice, was the transition from religious ritual to secular entertainment, such as happened during the [[Goryeo]] dynasty with the Narye festival. Originally "solely religious or ritualistic, a secular component was added at the conclusion".{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=69}} Former courtly entertainments, such as [[jousting]], often also survived in children's games.

In some courts, such as those during the [[Byzantine Empire]], the genders were segregated among the upper classes, so that "at least before the period of the [[Komnenos|Komnenoi]]" (1081–1185) men were separated from women at ceremonies where there was entertainment such as receptions and banquets.&lt;ref name=Garland&gt;{{cite book|last=Garland|first=Lynda|title=Byzantine Women: Varieties of Experience 800–1200|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited|location=Aldershot, Hampshire|isbn=978-0-7546-5737-8|pages=177–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Court ceremonies, palace banquets and the spectacles associated with them, have been used not only to entertain but also to demonstrate wealth and power. Such events reinforce the relationship between ruler and ruled; between those with power and those without, serving to "dramatise the differences between ordinary families and that of the ruler".{{sfnp|Walthall|2008}} This is the case as much as for traditional courts as it is for contemporary ceremonials, such as the [[Hong Kong handover ceremony]] in 1997, at which an array of entertainments (including a banquet, a parade, fireworks, a festival performance and an art spectacle) were put to the service of highlighting a change in political power. Court entertainments were typically performed for royalty and courtiers as well as "for the pleasure of local and visiting dignitaries".{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=6}} Royal courts, such as the Korean one, also supported traditional dances.{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=6}} In Sudan, musical instruments such as the so-called "slit" or "talking" drums, once "part of the court orchestra of a powerful chief", had multiple purposes: they were used to make music; "speak" at ceremonies; mark community events; send long-distance messages; and call men to hunt or war.&lt;ref name="Slit Drum"&gt;{{cite web|last=McGregor|first=Neil|title=Episode 94: Sudanese Slit Drum (Transcript)|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/about/transcripts/episode94/|work=History of the World in 100 Objects|publisher=BBC Radio 4/British Museum|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McGregor&gt;{{cite book|last=McGregor|first=Neil|title=A History of the World in 100 objects|year=2010|publisher=Allen Lane|location=London|isbn=978-1-84614-413-4|pages=613–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/FMgugdskR7eaWj_ST2fAeQ British Museum catalogue image of Sudanese slit drum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Courtly entertainments also demonstrate the complex relationship between entertainer and spectator: individuals may be either an entertainer or part of the audience, or they may swap roles even during the course of one entertainment. In the court at the [[Palace of Versailles]], "thousands of courtiers, including men and women who inhabited its apartments, acted as both performers and spectators in daily rituals that reinforced the status hierarchy".{{sfnp|Walthall|2008}}

Like court entertainment, royal occasions such as coronations and weddings provided opportunities to entertain both the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] and the people. For example, the splendid 1595 [[Accession Day]] celebrations of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] offered [[tournament]]s and jousting and other events performed "not only before the assembled court, in all their finery, but also before thousands of Londoners eager for a good day's entertainment. Entry for the day's events at the [[Tiltyard]] in [[Palace of Whitehall|Whitehall]] was set at [[History of the English penny (1485–1603)#Elizabeth I|12d]]".&lt;ref name=Bevington&gt;{{cite book|title=The Politics of the Stuart Court Masque|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-59436-7|author=Holbrook, Peter|editor=Bevington, David|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public punishment ===
[[File:Ticket for the execution of Jonathan Wild.jpg|thumb|160px|Ticket for the execution of [[Jonathan Wild]] (1725)]]
Although most forms of entertainment have evolved and continued over time, some once-popular forms are no longer as acceptable.  For example, during earlier centuries in Europe, watching or participating in the punishment of criminals or social outcasts was an accepted and popular form of entertainment. Many forms of [[public humiliation]] also offered local entertainment in the past. Even capital punishment such as [[hanging]] and [[Decapitation|beheading]], offered to the public as a warning, were also regarded partly as entertainment. Capital punishments that lasted longer, such as [[stoning]] and [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|drawing and quartering]], afforded a greater public spectacle. "A hanging was a carnival that diverted not merely the unemployed but the unemployable. Good bourgeois or curious aristocrats who could afford it watched it from a carriage or rented a room."&lt;ref name=Gay/&gt; Public punishment as entertainment lasted until the 19th century by which time "the awesome event of a public hanging aroused the[ir] loathing of writers and philosophers".&lt;ref name=Gay&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Peter Gay|last=Gay|first=Peter|title=Schnitzler's Century – The making of middle-class culture 1815–1914|year=2002|publisher=W.W.

== Children ==
{{Main article|Play (activity)}}
[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 041b.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]] ''[[Children's Games (Bruegel)|Children's Games]]'' (1560)]]

Children's entertainment is centred on [[Play (activity)|play]] and is significant for their growth. Entertainment is also provided to children or taught to them by adults and many activities that appeal to them such as [[puppet]]s, [[clown]]s, [[pantomime]]s and [[cartoon]]s are also enjoyed by adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Brien|first=John|title=Harlequin Britain: Pantomime and Entertainment, 1690–1760|year=2004|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0-8018-7910-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geipel|first=John|title=The cartoon: a short history of graphic comedy and satire|year=1972|publisher=Newton Abbot: David &amp; Charles|isbn=0-7153-5328-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children have always played games. It is accepted that as well as being entertaining, playing games helps children's development. One of the most famous visual accounts of children's games is a painting by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] called ''[[Children's Games (Bruegel)|Children's Games]]'', painted in 1560. It depicts children playing a range of games that presumably were typical of the time. Many of these games, such as [[Marble (toy)|marbles]], [[hide-and-seek]], blowing [[soap bubble]]s and [[Piggy-back (transportation)|piggyback riding]] continue to be played.

[[File:Israel Rating.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Example of a rating system specifying age appropriateness (Israel)]]
Most forms of entertainment can be or are modified to suit children's needs and interests. During the 20th century, starting with the often criticised but nonetheless important work of [[G. Stanley Hall]], who "promoted the link between the study of development and the 'new' laboratory psychology",&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last1=Thompson |first1=Dennis |last2=Hogan |first2=John D. |last3=Clark |first3=Philip M. |title=Developmental Psychology in Historical Perspective |year=2012 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Malden, Massachusetts; Oxford |isbn=978-1-4051-6747-5 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and especially with the work of [[Jean Piaget]], who "saw cognitive development as being analogous to biological development",{{sfnp|Thompson|2012|p=114}} it became understood that the [[Developmental psychology|psychological development]] of children occurs in stages and that their capacities differ from adults. Hence, stories and activities, whether in books, film, or video games were developed specifically for child audiences. Countries have responded to the special needs of children and the rise of digital entertainment by developing systems such as [[television content rating systems]], to guide the public and the [[entertainment industry]].

In the 21st century, as with adult products, much entertainment is available for children on the internet for private use. This constitutes a significant change from earlier times. The amount of time expended by children indoors on screen-based entertainment and the "remarkable collapse of children's engagement with nature" has drawn criticism for its negative effects on [[imagination]], adult [[cognition]] and [[Subjective well-being|psychological well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cobb|first=Edith|title=The ecology of imagination in childhood|year=1977|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-03870-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Louv|first=Richard|title=[[Last Child in the Woods]]: saving our children from nature-deficit disorder|year= 2005|publisher=Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill|location=Chapel Hill, North Carolina|isbn=1-56512-391-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/nov/19/children-lose-contact-with-nature"&gt;{{cite news|last=Monbiot|first=George|title=If children lose contact with nature they won't fight for it|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/19/children-lose-contact-with-nature|accessdate=29 November 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Banquets ===
[[Banquet]]s have been a venue for entertainment since ancient times, continuing until the 21st century, when they are still being used for many of their original purposes{{snd}} to impress visitors, especially important ones ('''4''', '''6''', '''9'''); to show hospitality ('''2''', '''4''', '''8'''); as an occasion to showcase supporting entertainments such as music or dancing, or both ('''2''', '''3'''). They were an integral part of court entertainments ('''3''', '''4''') and helped entertainers develop their skills ('''2''', '''3'''). They are also important components of celebrations such as coronations ('''9'''), weddings ('''7'''), [[birthday]]s ('''10''') civic or political achievements ('''5'''), military engagements or victories ('''6''') as well as religious obligations ('''1'''). In modern times, banquets are commercially available, for example, in restaurants ('''10''') and combined with a performance in [[dinner theater|dinner theatres]]. Cooking by professional [[chef]]s has also become a form of entertainment as part of global competitions such as the [[Bocuse d'Or]].

=== Music ===
{{Main article|Music}}
[[File:A full house, seen from the rear of the stage, at the Metropolitan Opera House for a concert by pianist Josef Hofmann, 1 - NARA - 541890.tif|thumb|left|A full house at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York City, waiting for a musical entertainment to begin (1937)]]
Music is a supporting component of many kinds of entertainment and most kinds of performance. For example, it is used to enhance storytelling, it is indispensable in dance ('''1''', '''4''') and opera, and is usually incorporated into dramatic film or theatre productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=Paul|title=A concise history of western music|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-521-84294-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music is also a universal and popular type of entertainment on its own, constituting an entire performance such as when [[concert]]s are given ('''2''', '''4''', '''5''', '''6''', '''7''', '''8''', '''9''' ). Depending on the [[rhythm]], [[Musical instrument|instrument]], performance and style, music is divided into many genres, such as [[classical music|classical]], [[jazz]], [[Folk music|folk]], ('''4''', '''5''', '''8'''), [[rock music|rock]], [[pop music]] ('''6''', '''9''') or traditional ('''1''', '''3'''). Since the 20th century, performed music, once available only to those who could pay for the performers, has been available cheaply to individuals by the entertainment industry, which broadcasts it or pre-records it for sale.

The wide variety of musical performances, whether or not they are artificially [[Amplifier|amplified]] ('''6''', '''7''', '''9''', '''10'''), all provide entertainment irrespective of whether the performance is from [[Solo (music)|soloists]] ('''6'''), [[Choir|choral]] ('''2''') or [[orchestra|orchestral groups]] ('''5''', '''8'''), or [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]] ('''3'''). Live performances use specialised venues, which might be small or large; indoors or outdoors; free or expensive. The audiences have different expectations of the performers as well as of their own role in the performance. For example, some audiences expect to listen silently and are entertained by the excellence of the music, its rendition or its interpretation ('''5''', '''8'''). Other audiences of live performances are entertained by the ambience and the chance to participate ('''7''', '''9'''). Even more listeners are entertained by pre-recorded music and listen privately ('''10''').

The instruments used in musical entertainment are either solely the [[human voice]] ('''2''', '''6''') or solely instrumental ('''1''', '''3''') or some combination of the two ('''4''', '''5''', '''7''', '''8'''). Whether the performance is given by [[Singing|vocalists]] or [[Musician|instrumentalists]], the performers may be soloists or part of a small or large group, in turn entertaining an audience that might be individual ('''10'''), passing by ('''3'''), small ('''1''', '''2''') or large ('''6''', '''7''', '''8''', '''9'''). Singing is generally accompanied by instruments although some forms, notably [[a cappella]] and [[overtone singing]], are unaccompanied. Modern concerts often use various special effects and other theatrics to accompany performances of singing and dancing ('''7''').

=== Games ===
{{Main article|Game}}
Games are played for entertainment—sometimes purely for entertainment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a [[World Chess Championship|chess championship]]. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player.

Equipment varies with the game. [[Board game]]s, such as [[Go (game)|Go]], ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' or [[backgammon]] need a board and markers. One of the oldest known board games is [[Senet]], a game played in Ancient Egypt, enjoyed by the [[pharaoh]] [[Tutankhamun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Botermans|first=Jack|title=The Book of Games: Strategy, Tactics &amp; History|year=2008|publisher=Sterling Pub Co Inc|isbn=1-4027-4221-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Card game]]s, such as [[whist]], [[poker]] and [[Contract bridge|Bridge]] have long been played as evening entertainment among friends. For these games, all that is needed is a deck of [[playing card]]s. Other games, such as [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo]], played with numerous strangers, have been organised to involve the participation of non-players via [[gambling]]. Many are [[children's game|geared for children]], and can be played outdoors, including [[hopscotch]], [[hide and seek]], or [[Blind man's bluff (game)|Blind man's bluff]]. The [[list of ball games]] is quite extensive. It includes, for example, [[croquet]], [[lawn bowling]] and [[paintball]] as well as many sports using various forms of [[ball]]s. The options cater to a wide range of skill and fitness levels. Physical games can develop agility and competence in [[motor skill]]s. Number games such as [[Sudoku]] and puzzle games like the [[Rubik's cube]] can develop mental prowess.

[[History of video games|Video games]] are played using a controller to create results on a screen. They can also be played online with participants joining in remotely. In the second half of the 20th century and in the 21st century the number of such games increased enormously, providing a wide variety of entertainment to players around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Digital Games|year=2006|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London; California; New Delhi|isbn=1-4129-0033-6|author=Bryce, Jo|editor=Rutter, Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=James|title=Videogames|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=London; New York|isbn=0-203-64290-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video games are popular in [[East Asia]]n countries such as South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jin|first=Dal Yong|title=Korea's Online Gaming Empire|year=2010|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=978-0-262-01476-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French poet [[Louise Labé]] (1520/1522–1566) wrote "a profound and timeless insight into reading's innate power".

''The past gives us pleasure and is of more service than the present; but the delight of what we once felt is dimly lost never to return and its memory is as distressing as the events themselves were then delectable&amp;nbsp;... But when we happen to put our thoughts in writing, how easily, later on, does our mind race through an infinity of events, incessantly alive, so that a long time afterwards when we take up those written pages we can return to the same place and to the same disposition in which we once found ourselves.'' &lt;br&gt;quote from and commentary by Fischer (2003)&lt;ref name=Fischer&gt;{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Steven Roger|title=A history of reading|year=2003|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn=1-86189-160-1|ref=harv|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The young Saint [[Teresa of Ávila]] (1515–1582) read chivalrous novels and wrote about the "rapture" that books provided.

''I became accustomed to reading [novels] and that small fault made me cool my desire and will to do other tasks. I thought nothing of spending many hours a day and night in this vain exercise, hidden from my father. My rapture in this was so great, that unless I had a new book to read, it seemed to me that I could not be happy.'' &lt;br&gt; quoted in Fischer (2003){{sfnp|Fischer|2003|pp=234–35}}

[[Reading (process)|Reading]] has been a source of entertainment for a very long time, especially when other forms, such as performance entertainments, were (or are) either unavailable or too costly. Even when the primary purpose of the writing is to inform or instruct, reading is well known for its capacity to distract from everyday worries. Both stories and information have been passed on through the tradition of [[orality]] and oral traditions survive in the form of [[performance poetry]] for example. However, they have drastically declined. "Once literacy had arrived in strength, there was no return to the oral prerogative."{{sfnp|Fischer|2003|p=215}} The advent of printing, the reduction in costs of books and an increasing literacy all served to enhance the mass appeal of reading. Furthermore, as [[font]]s were standardised and texts became clearer, "reading ceased being a painful process of decipherment and became an act of pure pleasure".{{sfnp|Fischer|2003|p=212}} By the 16th century in Europe, the appeal of reading for entertainment was well established.

Among [[literature]]'s many genres are some designed, in whole or in part, purely for entertainment. [[Limerick (poetry)|Limericks]], for example, use verse in a strict, predictable rhyme and rhythm to create humour and to amuse an audience of listeners or readers. Interactive books such as "[[choose your own adventure]]" can make literary entertainment more participatory.

[[File:Goscinny (scenarist van de strips Asterix en Lucky Luke) (l) en Morris (tekenaar, Bestanddeelnr 924-5894.jpg|thumb|Readers entertained by comic books (1971)]]
[[Comics]] and cartoons are literary genres that use drawings or graphics, usually in combination with text, to convey an entertaining narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chapman|first=James|title=British comics: a cultural history|year=2011|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn=978-1-86189-855-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many contemporary comics have elements of [[fantasy]] and are produced by companies that are part of the [[entertainment industry]]. Others have unique authors who offer a more personal, philosophical view of the world and the problems people face. Comics about [[superheroes]] such as [[Superman]] are of the first type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benton|first=Mike|title=Superhero comics of the Golden Age: the illustrated history|year= 1992|publisher=Taylor Publishing|location=Dallas, Texas|isbn=0-87833-808-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of the second sort include the individual work over 50 years  of [[Charles M.

The Japanese [[Manga]] style differs from the western approach in that it encompasses a wide range of genres and themes for a readership of all ages. [[Caricature]] uses a kind of graphic entertainment for purposes ranging from merely putting a smile on the viewer's face, to raising social awareness, to highlighting the moral characteristics of a person being caricatured.

[[Comedy]] is both a [[genre]] of entertainment and a component of it, providing laughter and amusement, whether the comedy is the sole purpose or used as a form of contrast in an otherwise serious piece. It is a valued contributor to many forms of entertainment, including in literature, theatre, opera, film and games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roston|first=Murray|title=The comic mode in English literature: from the Middle Ages to today|year=2011|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-1-4411-9588-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grindon|first=Leger|title=The Hollywood romantic comedy: conventions, history, controversies|year=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Malden, Massachusetts|isbn=978-1-4051-8266-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In royal courts, such as in the Byzantine court, and presumably, also in its wealthy households, "[[Mime artist|mimes]] were the focus of orchestrated humour, expected or obliged to make fun of all at court, not even excepting the emperor and members of the imperial family.

=== Performance ===
{{Main|Performance}}
Live performances before an audience constitute a major form of entertainment, especially before the invention of audio and video recording. Performance takes a wide range of forms, including theatre, music and drama. In the 16th and 17th centuries, European royal courts presented [[masque]]s that were complex theatrical entertainments involving dancing, singing and acting. Opera is a similarly demanding performance style that remains popular. It also encompass all three forms, demanding a high level of musical and dramatic skill, collaboration and like the masque, production expertise as well.

Audiences generally show their appreciation of an entertaining performance with applause. However, all performers run the risk of failing to hold their audience's attention and thus, failing to entertain. Audience dissatisfaction is often brutally honest and direct.

{{Quotation|"Of course you all ought to know that while singing a good song or, or giving a good recitation&amp;nbsp;... helps to arrest the company's attention&amp;nbsp;... Such at least was the case with me{{snd}} the [[publican]] devised a plan to bring my entertainment to an end abruptly, and the plan was, he told the waiter to throw a wet towel at me, which, of course, the waiter did&amp;nbsp;... and I received the wet towel, full force, in the face, which staggered me&amp;nbsp;... and had the desired effect of putting an end to me giving any more entertainments in the house."

==== Storytelling ====
{{Main|Storytelling}}
Storytelling is an ancient form of entertainment that has influenced almost all other forms. It is "not only entertainment, it is also thinking through human conflicts and contradictions".&lt;ref name=Kuhns/&gt; Hence, although stories may be delivered directly to a small listening audience, they are also presented as entertainment and used as a component of any piece that relies on a narrative, such as film, drama, ballet, and opera. Written stories have been enhanced by illustrations, often to a very high artistic standard, for example, on [[illuminated manuscript]]s and on ancient scrolls such as Japanese ones.&lt;ref name=Watanabe&gt;{{cite book|last=Watanabe|first=Masako|title=Storytelling in Japanese Art|year=2011|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|isbn=978-0-300-17590-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stories remain a common way of entertaining a group that is on a journey. Showing how stories are used to pass the time and entertain an audience of travellers, [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] used [[pilgrim]]s in his literary work ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' in the 14th century, as did Wu Cheng'en in the 16th century in ''[[Journey to the West]]''. Even though journeys can now be completed much faster, stories are still told to passengers en route in cars and aeroplanes either orally or delivered by some form of technology.

The power of stories to entertain is evident in one of the most famous ones—[[Scheherazade]]—a story in the [[Iran|Persian]] professional storytelling tradition, of a woman who saves her own life by telling stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yamanaka|first=Yuriko|title=The Arabian nights and orientalism: perspectives from East &amp; West|year=2006|publisher=I.B. Tauris|location=London; New York|author2=Nishio, Tetsuo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burton|first=Sir Richard (1821–1890) (in English)|title=Arabian nights. A plain and literal translation of the Arabian nights' entertainments: now entitled The book of the thousand and one nights |year=1958|publisher=Barker|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Arabian nights in English literature : studies in the reception of The thousand and one nights into British culture|year=1988|publisher=Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|isbn=0-333-36693-X|editor=Caracciolo, Peter L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The connections between the different types of entertainment are shown by the way that stories like this inspire a retelling in another medium, such as music, film or games. For example, composers [[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Shéhérazade (Ravel)|Ravel]] and [[Karol Szymanowski|Szymanowski]] have each been inspired by the Scheherazade story and turned it into an orchestral work; director [[Pier Paolo Pasolini|Pasolini]] made a [[Arabian Nights (1974 film)|film adaptation]]; and there is an [[The Magic of Scheherazade|innovative video game]] based on the tale. Stories may be told wordlessly, in music, dance or puppetry for example, such as in the Javanese tradition of [[wayang]], in which the performance is accompanied by a [[gamelan]] orchestra or the similarly traditional [[Punch and Judy]] show.

Epic narratives, poems, [[saga]]s and [[allegory|allegories]] from all cultures tell such gripping tales that they have inspired countless other stories in all forms of entertainment. Examples include the Hindu ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]''; [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Iliad]]''; the first Arabic novel ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]''; the Persian epic ''[[Shahnameh]]''; the [[Sagas of Icelanders]] and the celebrated ''[[The Tale of Genji|Tale of the Genji]]''. Collections of stories, such as ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales]]'' or those by [[Hans Christian Andersen]], have been similarly influential. Originally published in the early 19th century, this collection of folk stories significantly influence modern popular culture, which subsequently used its themes, images, symbols, and structural elements to create new entertainment forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rankin|first=Walter|title=Grimm pictures: fairy tale archetypes in eight horror and suspense films|year=2007|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=978-0-7864-3174-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most powerful and long-lasting stories are the foundation stories, also called [[myth of origin|origin]] or [[creation myth]]s such as the [[Dreamtime]] myths of the [[Aboriginal Australians|Australian aborigines]], the Mesopotamian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The epic of Gilgamesh: the Babylonian epic poem and other texts in Akkadian and Sumerian (English –  translated from Akkadian and Sumerian by Andrew George)|year=1999|publisher=Allen Lane|location=London|isbn=0-7139-9196-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Hawaiian stories of the origin of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Vivian Laubach|title=Hawaiian Myths of Earth, Sea, and Sky|year=1966|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=0-8248-1171-2|author2=Kahalewai, Marilyn}}&lt;/ref&gt; These too are developed into books, films, music and games in a way that increases their longevity and enhances their entertainment value.

[[Theatre]] performances, typically dramatic or musical, are presented on a stage for an audience and have a history that goes back to [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic times]] when "leading musicians and actors" performed widely at "poetical competitions", for example at "[[Delphi]], [[Delos]], [[Ephesus]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFMcDonald_Walton2007|title=The Cambridge companion to Greek and Roman theatre|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-83456-2|editors=McDonald, Marianne and Walton, J. Michael}} p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] and his teacher [[Plato]] both wrote on the theory and purpose of theatre. Aristotle posed questions such as "What is the function of the arts in shaping character? Should a member of the ruling class merely watch performances or be a participant and perform? What kind of entertainment should be provided for those who do not belong to the elite?"{{sfnp|ref=CITEREFMcDonald_Walton2007|McDonald &amp; Walton|2007|p=93}} The "Ptolemys in Egypt, the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] in [[Pergamon|Pergamum]]" also had a strong theatrical tradition and later, wealthy patrons in Rome staged "far more lavish productions".{{sfnp|ref=CITEREFMcDonald_Walton2007|McDonald &amp; Walton|2007|p=26}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge History of British Theatre|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press (3 volumes)|isbn=0-521-82790-6|editors=Milling, Jane; Donohue, Joseph W.; Thomson, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stage and the spaces set out in front of it for an audience create a theatre. All types of stage are used with all types of seating for the audience, including the impromptu or improvised ('''2''', '''3''', '''6'''); the temporary ('''2'''); the elaborate ('''9'''); or the traditional and permanent ('''5''', '''7'''). They are erected indoors ('''3''', '''5''', '''9''') or outdoors ('''2''', '''4''', '''6'''). The skill of managing, organising and preparing the stage for a performance is known as [[stagecraft]] ('''10'''). The audience's experience of the entertainment is affected by their expectations, the stagecraft, the type of stage, and the type and standard of seating provided.

==== Cinema and film ====
{{Main|Film}}
[[File:Munken kino (kinolerret).jpg|thumb|left|Film audiences are typically seated in comfortable chairs arranged in close rows before a projection screen. Norway (2005)]]

[[Film]]s are a major form of entertainment, although not all films have entertainment as their primary purpose: [[documentary film]], for example, aims to create a record or inform,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wyver|first=John|title=The Moving Image: An International History of Film, Television, and Video|year=1989|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Limited|isbn=0-631-16821-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the two purposes often work together. The medium was a global business from the beginning: "The [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]] were the first to send cameramen throughout the world, instructing them to film everything which could be of interest for the public."&lt;ref name=Paris&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFParis1999|title=The First World War and popular Cinema|year=1999|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0-8135-2824-0|editor=Paris, Michael}} p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, [[Pathé]] launched and distributed [[Pathé News|newsreels]]&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt; and by [[World War I]], films were meeting an enormous need for mass entertainment. "In the first decade of the [20th] century cinematic programmes combined, at random, fictions and newsfilms."&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt; The Americans first "contrived a way of producing an illusion of motion through successive images," but "the French were able to transform a scientific principle into a commercially lucrative spectacle".{{sfnp|Paris|1999|p=115}} Film therefore became a part of the entertainment industry from its early days. Increasingly sophisticated techniques have been used in the film medium to delight and entertain audiences. [[Animation]], for example, which involves the display of rapid movement in an art work, is one of these techniques that particularly appeals to younger audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cavalier|first=Stephen|title=The world history of animation|year= 2011|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-520-26112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) in the 21st century made it "possible to do spectacle" more cheaply and "on a scale never dreamed of" by [[Cecil B. DeMille]].&lt;ref name=Byrnes&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrnes|first=Paul|title=Pompeii, Noah and Exodus: The sword giveth again|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/pompeii-noah-and-exodus-the-sword-giveth-again-20140327-35jm4.html|work=Film|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1930s to 1950s, movies and radio were the "only mass entertainment" but by the second decade of the 21st century, technological changes, economic decisions, risk aversion and globalisation reduced both the quality and range of films being produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Losing the plot|last = Byrnes|first = Paul|date = 12 December 2015|work = The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date = |via = |pages = 12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sophisticated [[visual effects]] and CGI techniques, for example, rather than humans, were used not only to create realistic images of people, landscapes and events (both real and [[Fantasy|fantastic]]) but also to animate non-living items such as [[Lego]] normally used as entertainment as a game in physical form.&lt;ref name=Maddox&gt;{{cite web|last=Maddox|first=Garry|title=The Lego Movie: Hit off the old block | url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/the-lego-movie-hit-off-the-old-block-20140327-35jek.html|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creators of ''[[The Lego Movie]]'' "wanted the audience to believe they were looking at actual Lego bricks on a tabletop that were shot with a real camera, not what we actually did, which was create vast environments with digital bricks inside the computer."&lt;ref name=Maddox/&gt; The convergence of computers and film has allowed entertainment to be presented in a new way and the technology has also allowed for those with the personal resources to screen films in a [[home cinema|home theatre]], recreating in a private venue the quality and experience of a public theatre. This is similar to the way that the nobility in earlier times could stage private musical performances or the use of domestic theatres in large homes to perform private plays in earlier centuries.

Films also re-imagine entertainment from other forms, turning stories, books and plays, for example, into new entertainments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rothwell|first=Kenneth S.|title=A History of Shakespeare on Screen: A Century of Film and Television|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-59404-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Story of Film: An Odyssey|The Story of Film]]'', a documentary about the [[history of film]], gives a survey of global achievements and innovations in the medium, as well as changes in the conception of film-making. It demonstrates that while some films, particularly those in the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] tradition that combines "realism and [[melodrama]]tic romanticism",{{sfnp|Paris|1999|p=17}} are intended as a form of [[escapism]], others require a deeper engagement or more thoughtful response from their audiences. For example, the award winning Senegalese film ''[[Xala]]'' takes government corruption as its theme. [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s film ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' was a brave and innovative parody, also on a political theme. Stories that are thousands of years old, such as [[Noah (2014 film)|''Noah'']], have been re-interpreted in film, applying familiar [[literary devices]] such as allegory and [[personification]] with new techniques such as CGI to explore big themes such as "human folly", good and evil, courage and despair, love, faith, and death{{snd}} themes that have been a main-stay of entertainment across all its forms.&lt;ref name=Byrnes2&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrnes|first=Paul|title=Noah review: Moments of brilliance but can't shake sinking feeling  |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/noah-review-moments-of-brilliance-but-cant-shake-sinking-feeling-20140327-35jm3.html|work=Review|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in other media, excellence and achievement in films is recognised through a range of awards, including ones from the  American [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]], the [[Cannes International Film Festival]] in France and the [[Asia Pacific Screen Awards]].

==== Dance ====
{{Main|Dance}}
[[File:Peterborough Snow Ball 2008 silent video.ogg|left|thumb|Dancers creating their own entertainment at a ball. &lt;br&gt; Peterborough (2008) (silent video)]]
The many forms of [[dance]] provide entertainment for all age groups and cultures. Dance can be serious in tone, such as when it is used to express a culture's history or important stories; it may be provocative; or it may put in the service of comedy. Since it combines many forms of entertainment{{snd}} music, movement, storytelling, theatre{{snd}} it provides a good example of the various ways that these forms can be combined to create entertainment for different purposes and audiences.

Dance is "a form of cultural representation" that involves not just dancers, but "[[Choreography (dance)|choreographers]], audience members, [[Patronage|patrons]] and [[impresario]]s&amp;nbsp;... coming from all over the globe and from vastly varied time periods."&lt;ref name="Dils"&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFDilsAlbright2001|title=Moving History/Dancing Cultures: A Dance History Reader|year=2001|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Durham, North Carolina|isbn=0-8195-6412-5|author=Albright, Ann Cooper|editor=Dils, Ann}} p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether from Africa, Asia or Europe, dance is constantly negotiating the realms of political, social, spiritual and artistic influence."{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=96}} Even though dance traditions may be limited to one cultural group, they all develop. For example, in Africa, there are "[[Dahomey|Dahomean]] dances, [[Hausa people|Hausa]] dances, [[Maasai people|Masai]] dances and so forth."{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=34}} [[Ballet]] is an example of a highly developed Western form of dance that moved to the theatres from the French court during the time of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the dancers becoming professional theatrical performers.&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Clarke|first=Mary|title=The history of dance|year=1981|publisher=Crown Publishers|location=New York|isbn=0-517-54282-X}} p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Some dances, such as the [[quadrille]], a square dance that "emerged during the [[Napoleonic era|Napoleonic years]] in France"{{sfnp|Clarke|1981|p=97}} and other [[country dance]]s&lt;ref name="Wilson2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Thomas|title=An Analysis of Country Dancing|date=1808|publisher=W. Calvert}}&lt;/ref&gt; were once popular at social gatherings like [[Ball (dance)|balls]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fullerton|first=Susannah|title=A Dance with [[Jane Austen]]: How a Novelist and Her Characters Went to the Ball|year=2012|publisher=Pgw|isbn=0-7112-3245-8|author2=Le Faye, Deirdre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Thomas|title=The Treasures of Terpsichore: or, A Companion for the Ball-Room|date=1816|publisher=Sherwood, Neely and Jones|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are now rarely performed. On the other hand, many [[folk dance]]s (such as [[Scottish highland dance|Scottish Highland dancing]] and [[Irish dance|Irish dancing]]), have evolved into competitions, which by adding to their audiences, has increased their entertainment value. "Irish dance theatre, which sometimes features traditional Irish steps and music, has developed into a major dance form with an international reputation."&lt;ref name="Wulff"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wulff|first=Helena|title=Dancing at the Crossroads: Memory and Mobility in Ireland|year=2007|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-84545-328-2|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since dance is often "associated with the female body and women's experiences",{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=96}} female dancers, who dance to entertain, have in some cases been regarded as distinct from "decent" women because they "use their bodies to make a living instead of hiding them as much as possible".{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=142}} Society's attitudes to female dancers depend on the culture, its history and the entertainment industry itself. For example, while some cultures regard any dancing by women as "the most shameful form of entertainment",&lt;ref&gt;van Nieuwkerk, Karin. "Changing Images and Shifting Identities: Female Performers in Egypt" in Dils &amp; Albright (2001). p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; other cultures have established venues such as [[strip clubs]] where deliberately erotic or sexually provocative dances such as [[striptease]] are performed in public by professional women dancers for mostly male audiences.

Various political regimes have sought to control or ban dancing or specific types of dancing, sometimes because of disapproval of the music or clothes associated with it. Nationalism, authoritarianism and racism have played a part in banning dances or dancing. For example, during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] regime, American dances such as [[Swing (dance)|swing]], regarded as "completely un-German", had "become a public offense and needed to be banned".&lt;ref name="Karina"&gt;{{cite book|last=Karina|first=Lilian|title=Hitler's Dancers: German Modern Dance and the Third Reich|year=1999|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=1-57181-300-4|page=174|edition=English language|others=Translated by Jonathan Steinberg|author2=Kant, Marion}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in Shanghai, China, in the 1930s, "dancing and nightclubs had come to symbolise the excess that plagued Chinese society" and officials wondered if "other forms of entertainment such as [[brothel]]s" should also be banned.

Dances can be performed [[Solo (dance)|solo]] ('''1''', '''4'''); in pairs, ('''2''', '''3'''); in groups, ('''5''', '''6''', '''7'''); or by massed performers ('''10'''). They might be improvised ('''4''', '''8''') or highly choreographed ('''1''', '''2''', '''5''', '''10'''); spontaneous for personal entertainment, (such as when children begin dancing for themselves); a private audience, ('''4'''); a paying audience ('''2'''); a world audience ('''10'''); or an audience interested in a particular dance genre ('''3''', '''5'''). They might be a part of a celebration, such as a [[wedding]] or [[New Year]] ('''6''', '''8'''); or a cultural ritual with a specific purpose, such as a dance by [[warrior]]s like a [[haka]] ('''7'''). Some dances, such as traditional dance in '''1''' and ballet in '''2''', need a very high level of skill and training; others, such as the [[can-can]], require a very high level of energy and physical fitness. Entertaining the audience is a normal part of dance but its physicality often also produces joy for the dancers themselves ('''9''').

==== Animals ====
Animals have been used for the purposes of entertainment for millennia. They have been hunted for entertainment (as opposed to hunted for food); displayed while they hunt for prey; watched when they compete with each other; and watched while they perform a trained routine for human amusement. The Romans, for example, were entertained both by competitions involving wild animals and acts performed by trained animals. They watched as "lions and bears danced to the music of pipes and [[cymbal]]s; horses were trained to kneel, bow, dance and prance&amp;nbsp;... acrobats turning handsprings over wild lions and vaulting over wild leopards." There were "violent confrontations with wild beasts" and "performances over time became more brutal and bloodier".&lt;ref name="St Leon"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=St Leon|first=Mark|title=Circus: the Australian story|year=2011|publisher=Melbourne Books|location=Melbourne|isbn=978-1-877096-50-1|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals that perform trained routines or "acts" for human entertainment include fleas in [[flea circus]]es, dolphins in [[Dolphinarium|dolphinaria]], and monkeys doing tricks for an audience on behalf of the player of a [[street organ]]. Animals kept in [[zoo]]s in ancient times were often kept there for later use in the arena as entertainment or for their entertainment value as exotica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hancocks|first=David|title=A different nature: the paradoxical world of zoos and their uncertain future|year=2001|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-520-23676-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many contests between animals are now regarded as sports{{snd}} for example, [[horse racing]] is regarded as both a sport and an important source of entertainment. Its economic impact means that it is also considered a global industry, one in which horses are carefully transported around the world to compete in races. In Australia, the horse race run on [[Melbourne Cup]] Day is a public holiday and the public regards the race as an important annual event. Like horse racing, [[camel racing]] requires human riders, while [[greyhound racing]] does not. People find it entertaining to watch animals race competitively, whether they are trained, like horses, camels or dogs, or untrained, like [[Cockroach racing|cockroaches]].

The use of animals for entertainment is often controversial, especially the hunting of wild animals. Some contests between animals, once popular entertainment for the public, have become illegal because of the cruelty involved. Among these are [[blood sport]]s such as [[bear-baiting]], [[dog fighting]] and [[cockfighting]]. Other contests involving animals remain controversial and have both supporters and detractors. For example, the conflict between opponents of pigeon shooting who view it as "a cruel and moronic exercise in marksmanship, and proponents, who view it as entertainment" has been tested in a court of law.&lt;ref name=Bronner&gt;An extensive discussion of the legal and cultural issues can be found in {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Bronner|first=Simon J.|title=Killing Tradition: Inside Hunting and Animal Rights Controversies|year=2008|publisher=The University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-2528-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fox hunting]], which involves the use of horses as well as hounds, and [[bullfighting]], which has a strong theatrical component, are two entertainments that have a long and significant cultural history. They both involve animals and are variously regarded as sport, entertainment or cultural tradition&lt;!--don't use 'either' nor 'and/or' in this sentence; 'variously' is used in conjunction with 'or' to mean they're regarded as one, two or three of these things--&gt;. Among the organisations set up to advocate for the rights of animals are some whose concerns include the use of animals for entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Examples include: [http://www.league.org.uk/ The League against Cruel Sports, UK]; [http://www.peta.org/ People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), multinational]; and [http://www.sharkonline.org/ Showing Animals Respect and Kindness (SHARK), US].&lt;/ref&gt; However, "in many cases of animal advocacy groups versus organisations accused of animal abuse, both sides have cultural claims."{{sfn|Bronner|2008}}

==== Circus ====
{{Main|Circus}}
[[File:Cirque Soleil Stilt 1.jpg|thumb|Children entertained by a [[stilts|stilt]] walker performing in a circus act]]

A [[circus]], described as "one of the most brazen of entertainment forms",&lt;ref name=Stoddart&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoddart|first=Helen|title=Rings of Desire: Circus History and Representation|year=2000|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester, UK &amp; New York|page=13|isbn=0-7190-5233-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a special type of theatrical performance, involving a variety of physical skills such as [[acrobatics]] and [[juggling]] and sometimes performing animals. Usually thought of as a travelling show performed in a [[wikt:big top|big top]], circus was first performed in permanent venues. [[Philip Astley]] is regarded as the founder of the modern circus in the second half of the 18th century and [[Jules Léotard]] is the French performer credited with developing the art of the [[trapeze]], considered synonymous with circuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diamond|first=Michael|title=Victorian sensation, or, The spectacular, the shocking, and the scandalous in nineteenth-century Britain|year=2003|publisher=Anthem Press|location=London|isbn=1-84331-076-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astley brought together performances that were generally familiar in traditional British fairs "at least since the beginning of the 17th century": "tumbling, rope-dancing, juggling, animal tricks and so on".&lt;ref name=Stoddart/&gt; It has been claimed that "there is no direct link between the Roman circus and the circus of modern times.&amp;nbsp;... Between the demise of the Roman 'circus' and the foundation of Astley's Amphitheatre in London some 1300 years later, the nearest thing to a circus ring was the rough circle formed by the curious onlookers who gathered around the itinerant tumbler or juggler on a [[village green]]."{{sfnp|St Leon|2011}}

==== Magic ====
{{Main|Magic (illusion)}}
The form of entertainment known as [[Magic (illusion)|stage magic]] or conjuring and recognisable as performance, is based on traditions and texts of magical rites and dogmas that have been a part of most cultural traditions since ancient times. (References to magic, for example, can be found in the [[Bible]], in [[Hermeticism]], in [[Zoroastrianism]], in the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] tradition, in [[mysticism]] and in the sources of [[Freemasonry]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lévi|first=Éliphas|title=The History of Magic ''(originally published in 1860 as'' Histoire de la Magie ''English edition, translated by A.E. Waite in 1913)''|year=2001|publisher=Red Wheel/Weiser|location=Boston, Massachusetts|isbn=0-87728-929-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stage magic is performed for an audience in a variety of media and locations: on stage, on television, in the street, and live at parties or events. It is often combined with other forms of entertainment, such as comedy or music and [[showmanship (performing)|showmanship]] is often an essential part of magic performances. Performance magic relies on deception, [[psychological manipulation]], sleight of hand and other forms of trickery to give an audience the illusion that a performer can achieve the impossible. Audiences amazed at the [[stunt performer|stunt performances]] and [[Escapology|escape acts]] of [[Harry Houdini]], for example, regarded him as a [[Magic (illusion)|magician]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=Houdini: the man who walked through walls  | author1=Gresham, William Lindsay  | year=1959  | publisher=Holt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=The Great Houdini: magician extraordinary  | author1=Epstein, Beryl| author2=Epstein, Sam  | year=1971  | location = Folkestone| publisher=Bailey Brothers and Swinfen (Reprint.

Originally published: New York: Dutton, c1920)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Magician (fantasy)|Fantasy magicians]] have held an important place in literature for centuries, offering entertainment to millions of readers. Famous wizards such as [[Merlin]] in the [[Arthurian legends]] have been written about since the 5th and 6th centuries, while in the 21st century, the young wizard [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] became a global entertainment phenomenon when the book series about him sold about 450 million copies (as at June 2011), making it the [[List of book series|best-selling book series in history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rowling 'makes £5 every second'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7649962.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 February 2013|date=3 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harry Potter series to be sold as e-books|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13889578|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 February 2013|date=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Street performance ====
[[File:Didgeridoo street player.jpg|thumb|[[Didgeridoo]] player entertaining passers by in the street]]

Street entertainment, [[street performance]] or "busking" are forms of performance that have been meeting the public's need for entertainment for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=David|title=The buskers: a history of street entertainment|year= 1981|publisher=David &amp; Charles|location=Newton Abbot; North Pomfret, Vermont|isbn=0-7153-8026-5|author2=Greenwood, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was "an integral aspect of London's life", for example, when the city in the early 19th century was "filled with spectacle and diversion".{{sfnp|Ackroyd|2000|p=346 (caption to plate following text pages)}} [[Minstrel]]s or [[troubadour]]s are part of the tradition. The art and practice of busking is still celebrated at annual busking festivals.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [http://www.coffsharbourbuskers.com/ 2012 Coffs Harbour International Buskers and Comedy Festival].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three basic forms of contemporary street performance. The first form is the "circle show". It tends to gather a crowd, usually has a distinct beginning and end, and is done in conjunction with [[street theatre]], [[puppeteer]]ing, [[magician (illusion)|magicians]], [[comedian]]s, acrobats, [[juggler]]s and sometimes [[musician]]s. This type has the potential to be the most lucrative for the performer because there are likely to be more donations from larger audiences if they are entertained by the act. Good buskers control the crowd so patrons do not obstruct foot traffic. The second form, the ''walk-by act'', has no distinct beginning or end. Typically, the busker provides an entertaining ambience, often with an unusual instrument, and the audience may not stop to watch or form a crowd. Sometimes a walk-by act spontaneously turns into a circle show. The third form, ''café busking'', is performed mostly in restaurants, pubs, bars and cafés. This type of act occasionally uses [[public transport]] as a venue.

==== Parades ====
{{Main|Parade}}
[[Parade]]s are held for a range of purposes, often more than one. Whether their mood is sombre or festive, being public events that are designed to attract attention and activities that necessarily divert normal traffic, parades have a clear entertainment value to their audiences. [[Cavalcade]]s and the modern variant, the [[motorcade]], are examples of public processions. Some people watching the parade or procession may have made a special effort to attend, while others become part of the audience by happenstance. Whatever their mood or primary purpose, parades attract and entertain people who watch them pass by. Occasionally, a parade takes place in an improvised theatre space (such as the [[Trooping the Colour]] in '''8''') and tickets are sold to the physical audience while the global audience participates via broadcast.

One of the earliest forms of parade were "[[Roman triumph|triumphs]]"{{snd}} grand and sensational displays of foreign treasures and spoils, given by triumphant Roman generals to celebrate their victories. They presented conquered peoples and nations that exalted the prestige of the victor. "In the summer of 46&amp;nbsp;[[Before common era|BCE]] [[Julius Caesar]] chose to celebrate four triumphs held on different days extending for about one month."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gurval|first=Robert Alan|title=Actium and Augustus: The Politics and Emotions of Civil War|year=1995|publisher=University of Michigan|isbn=0-472-10590-6|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe from the Middle Ages to the [[Baroque]] the [[Royal Entry]] celebrated the formal visit of the monarch to the city with a parade through elaborately decorated streets, passing various shows and displays. The annual [[Lord Mayor's Show]] in London is an example of a civic parade that has survived since medieval times.

Many religious festivals (especially those that incorporate [[processions]], such as [[Holy Week procession]]s or the Indian festival of [[Holi]]) have some entertainment appeal in addition to their serious purpose. Sometimes, religious rituals have been adapted or evolved into secular entertainments, or like the [[Festa del Redentore]] in Venice, have managed to grow in popularity while holding both secular and sacred purposes in balance. However, [[pilgrimage]]s, such as the Christian pilgrimage of the [[Way of St. James]], the Muslim [[Hajj]] and the Hindu [[Kumbh Mela]], which may appear to the outsider as an entertaining parade or procession, are not intended as entertainment: they are instead about an individual's spiritual journey. Hence, the relationship between spectator and participant, unlike entertainments proper, is different. The manner in which the Kumbh Mela, for example, "is divorced from its cultural context and repackaged for Western consumption{{snd}} renders the presence of [[Voyeurism|voyeurs]] deeply problematic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maclean|first=Kama|title=Pilgrimage and Power: The Kumbh Mela in Allahabad, 1765–1954|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533894-2|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parades generally impress and delight often by including unusual, colourful costumes ('''7, 10'''). Sometimes they also commemorate ('''5''', '''8''') or celebrate ('''1''', '''4, 6,''' '''8''', '''9'''). Sometimes they have a serious purpose, such as when the context is military ('''1''', '''2''', '''5'''), when the intention is sometimes to intimidate; or religious, when the audience might participate or have a role to play ('''6''', '''7, 10'''). Even if a parade uses new technology and is some distance away ('''9'''), it is likely to have a strong appeal, draw the attention of onlookers and entertain them.

==== Fireworks ====
{{Main|Fireworks}}
[[File:Medellín-Juegos pirotécnicos bicentenario-11.jpg|thumb|Spectators at Bicentennial [[fireworks]] in Colombia]]

[[Fireworks]] are a part of many public entertainments and have retained an enduring popularity since they became a "crowning feature of elaborate celebrations" in the 17th century. First used in China, classical antiquity and Europe for military purposes, fireworks were most popular in the 18th century and high prices were paid for [[Pyrotechnics|pyrotechnists]], especially the skilled Italian ones, who were summoned to other countries to organise displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Giacomo Casanova|last=Casanova|first=Giacomo Chevalier de Seingalt|title=History of My Life, Volumes 9–10 Vol 10|year=1997|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Maryland; London|isbn=0-8018-5666-3|page=333|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Jack|title=Gunpowder: Alchemy, Bombards, and Pyrotechnics: The History of the Explosive that Changed the World|year=2005|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=0-465-03722-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fire and water were important aspects of court spectacles because the displays "inspired by means of fire, sudden noise, smoke and general magnificence the sentiments thought fitting for the subject to entertain of his sovereign: awe fear and a vicarious sense of glory in his might. Birthdays, name-days, weddings and anniversaries provided the occasion for celebration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sagarra|first=Eda|title=A Social History of Germany 1648–1914|year=2003|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-7658-0982-7|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most famous courtly uses of fireworks was one used to celebrate the end of the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] and while the fireworks themselves caused a fire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Christopher Hogwood|last=Hogwood|first=Christopher|title=Handel: Water Music and Music for the Royal Fireworks|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-83636-4|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; the accompanying [[Music for the Royal Fireworks]] written by [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] has been popular ever since. Aside from their contribution to entertainments related to military successes, courtly displays and personal celebrations, fireworks are also used as part of religious ceremony. For example, during the Indian [[Dashavatar]]a Kala of Gomantaka "the temple deity is taken around in a procession with a lot of singing, dancing and display of fireworks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Varadpande|first=Manohar Laxman|title=History of Indian Theatre (vol. 2)|year=1992|publisher=Shakti Malik Abhinav Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-7017-278-0|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "fire, sudden noise and smoke" of fireworks is still a significant part of public celebration and entertainment. For example, fireworks were one of the primary forms of display chosen to celebrate the turn of the [[millennium]] around the world. As the clock struck midnight and 1999 became 2000, firework displays and open-air parties greeted the [[New Year]] as the [[time zone]]s changed over to the next century. Fireworks, carefully planned and choreographed, were let off against the backdrop of many of the world's most famous buildings, including the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]], the [[Giza Necropolis|Pyramids of Giza]] in Egypt, the [[Acropolis]] in Athens, [[Red Square]] in Moscow, [[Vatican City]] in Rome, the [[Brandenburg Gate]] in Berlin, the [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris, and [[Elizabeth Tower]] in London.

=== Sport ===
{{Main|Sport}}
[[File:Tifosi fiorentina.jpg|thumb|Tifosi fiorentina|Audience engagement from a crowd of Italian sport fans]]
[[File:2010 FIFA World Cup Fans.jpg|thumb|Audience engagement by individual South African fans at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] ]]

[[Sports|Sporting]] competitions have always provided entertainment for crowds. To distinguish the players from the audience, the latter are often known as spectators. Developments in [[stadium]] and [[auditorium]] design, as well as in recording and broadcast technology, have allowed off-site spectators to watch sport, with the result that the size of the audience has grown ever larger and [[spectator sport]] has become increasingly popular. Two of the most popular sports with global appeal are [[association football]] and [[cricket]]. Their ultimate international competitions, the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] and [[test cricket]], are broadcast around the world. Beyond the very large numbers involved in playing these sports, they are notable for being a major source of entertainment for many millions of non-players worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sport Marketing|year=2007|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=978-0-7360-6052-3|authors=Hardy, Stephen; Sutton, William Anthony|editor=Mullin, Bernard James}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comparable multi-stage, long-form sport with global appeal is the [[Tour de France]], unusual in that it takes place outside of special stadia, being run instead in the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Christopher S.|title=The Tour de France: A Cultural History|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles; London|isbn=978-0-520-25630-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from sports that have world-wide appeal and competitions, such as the [[Olympic Games]], the entertainment value of a sport depends on the culture and country where people play it. For example, in the United States, [[baseball]] and [[basketball]] games are popular forms of entertainment; in Bhutan, the national sport is archery; in New Zealand, it is [[rugby union]]; in Iran, it is [[freestyle wrestling]]. Japan's unique [[sumo]] wrestling contains ritual elements that derive from its long history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kubota|first=Makoto|title=Sumo|year=1999|publisher=Chronicle Books Llc|isbn=0-8118-2548-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, such as the international running group [[Hash House Harriers]], participants create a blend of sport and entertainment for themselves, largely independent of spectator involvement, where the social component is more important than the competitive.

The evolution of an activity into a sport and then an entertainment is also affected by the local climate and conditions. For example, the modern sport of [[History of surfing|surfing]] is associated with Hawaii and that of [[History of skiing|snow skiing]] probably evolved in Scandinavia. While these sports and the entertainment they offer to spectators have spread around the world, people in the two originating countries remain well known for their prowess. Sometimes the climate offers a chance to adapt another sport such as in the case of [[ice hockey]]—an important entertainment in Canada.

=== Fairs, expositions, shopping ===
{{Main|Fair|World's fair}}
[[Fair]]s and exhibitions have existed since ancient and medieval times, displaying wealth, innovations and objects for trade and offering specific entertainments as well as being places of entertainment in themselves.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Robert|title=Great Exhibitions: The World Fairs 1851–1937|year=2007|publisher=National Gallery of Victoria|isbn=978-0-7241-0284-6|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether in a medieval market or a small shop, "shopping always offered forms of exhilaration that took one away from the everyday".&lt;ref name=Moss&gt;{{cite book|last=Moss|first=Mark Howard|title=Shopping as an Entertainment Experience|year=2007|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham, Maryland; Plymouth, UK|page=3|isbn=978-0-7391-1680-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the modern world, "merchandising has become entertainment: spinning signs, flashing signs, thumping music&amp;nbsp;... video screens, interactive computer kiosks, day care .. cafés".&lt;ref name=Moss/&gt;

By the 19th century, "expos" that encouraged arts, manufactures and commerce had become international. They were not only hugely popular but affected international ideas. For example, the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878 Paris Exposition]] facilitated international cooperation about ideas, innovations and standards. From London 1851 to Paris 1900, "in excess of 200 million visitors had entered the turnstiles in London, Paris, Vienna, Philadelphia, Chicago and a myriad of smaller shows around the world."&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World's Colombian Exposition of 1893|url=http://columbus.gl.iit.edu/|publisher=Chicago Illinois Institute of Technology|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[World War II]] "well over 500 million visits have been recorded through world expo turnstiles".&lt;ref name=Boisseau&gt;{{cite book|title=Gendering the Fair: Histories of Women and Gender at World's Fairs|year=2010|publisher=University of Illinois|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-252-03558-6|authors=Rydell, Robert; Boisseau, T.J.; Markwyn, Abigail M.; Rydell, Robert W.|editor=Boisseau, T.J.|page=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a form of spectacle and entertainment, expositions influenced "everything from architecture, to patterns of globalisation, to fundamental matters of human identity"&lt;ref name=Boisseau/&gt; and in the process established the close relationship between "fairs, the rise of department stores and art museums",&lt;ref name=Rydell&gt;{{cite book|last=Rydell|first=Robert W.|title=World of Fairs: The Century-of-Progress Expositions|year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-73236-3|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the modern world of mass consumption and the entertainment industry.

== Safety ==
Some entertainments, such as at large festivals (whether religious or secular), concerts, clubs, parties and celebrations, involve big crowds. From earliest times, crowds at an entertainment have associated hazards and dangers, especially when combined with the recreational consumption of [[Recreational drug use|intoxicants]] such as alcohol. The Ancient Greeks had [[Dionysian Mysteries]], for example, and the Romans had [[Saturnalia]]. The consequence of excess and crowds can produce breaches of [[Norm (social)|social norms]] of behaviour, sometimes causing injury or even death, such as for example, at the [[Altamont Free Concert]], an outdoor [[rock festival]]. The list of [[Nightclub#Serious incidents|serious incidents at nightclubs]] includes those caused by [[stampede]]; overcrowding; terrorism, such as the [[2002 Bali bombings]] that targeted a nightclub; and especially fire. Investigations, such as that carried out in the US after [[The Station nightclub fire]] often demonstrate that lessons learned "regarding fire safety in nightclubs" from earlier events such as the [[Cocoanut Grove fire]] do "not necessarily result in lasting effective change".&lt;ref name=Tubbs&gt;{{cite book|last=Tubbs|first=Jeffrey|title=Egress Design Solutions: A Guide to Evacuation and Crowd Management Planning|year=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-471-71956-4|page=83|author2=Meacham, Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to prevent such incidents include appointing special officers, such as the medieval [[Lord of Misrule]] or, in modern times, [[security officers]] who control access; and also ongoing improvement of relevant [[International Organization for Standardization|standards]] such as those for building safety. The [[tourism]] industry now regards safety and security at entertainment venues as an important management task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=Tourism, security and safety: from theory to practice | author1=Mansfeld, Yoel  | author2=Pizam, Abraham  | date = 2006 |location = Burlington, Mass.|publisher=Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann  | isbn=0750678984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry ==
Although kings, rulers and powerful people have always been able to pay for entertainment to be provided for them and in many cases have paid for public entertainment, people generally have made their own entertainment or when possible, attended a live performance. Technological developments in the 20th century meant that entertainment could be produced independently of the audience, packaged and sold on a commercial basis by an entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stein|first=Andi|title=An Introduction to the Entertainment Industry|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4331-0341-4|author2=Evans, Beth Bingham}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Key issues in the arts and entertainment industry|publisher=Goodfellow Publishers |location=Woodeaton, Oxford|isbn=1-906884-20-X|editor=Walmsley, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes referred to as [[show business]], the industry relies on [[business model]]s to produce, market, broadcast or otherwise distribute many of its traditional forms, including performances of all types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sickels|first=Robert C|title=The Business of Entertainment|publisher=Greenwood Publishing (Three Volumes)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The industry became so sophisticated that its economics became a separate area of academic study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vogel|first=Harold L.|title=Entertainment industry economics: a guide for financial analysis|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-87485-8|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[film industry]] is a part of the entertainment industry. Components of it include the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hollywood News|url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/hollywood|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Mid Day}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bollywood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bollywood News|url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/bollywood|publisher=Mid Day|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; film industries, as well as the [[cinema of the United Kingdom]] and all the [[Cinema of Europe|cinemas of Europe]], including [[cinema of France|France]], [[cinema of Germany|Germany]], [[cinema of Spain|Spain]], [[Cinema of Italy|Italy]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Casper|first=Drew|title=Postwar Hollywood, 1946–1962|year=2007|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-4051-5074-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sex industry]] is another component of the entertainment industry, applying the same forms and media (for example, film, books, dance and other performances) to the development, marketing and sale of sex products on a commercial basis.

[[Amusement park]]s entertain paying guests with [[rides]], such as [[roller coasters]], [[ridable miniature railway]]s, [[water rides]], and [[dark rides]], as well as other events and associated attractions. The parks are built on a large area subdivided into themed areas named "lands". Sometimes the whole amusement park is based on one theme, such as the various [[SeaWorld]] parks that focus on the theme of sea life.

One of the consequences of the development of the entertainment industry has been the creation of new types of [[employment]]. While jobs such as [[writer]], musician and [[composer]] exist as they always have, people doing this work are likely to be employed by a company rather than a patron as they once would have been. New jobs have appeared, such as [[Gaffer (filmmaking)|gaffer]] or [[special effect]]s supervisor in the film industry, and attendants in an amusement park.

Prestigious [[List of prizes, medals, and awards|awards are given by the industry]] for excellence in the various types of entertainment. For example, there are awards for Music, Games (including video games), Comics, Comedy, Theatre, Television, Film, Dance and Magic. Sporting awards are made for the results and skill, rather than for the entertainment value.

== Architecture ==

=== Architecture for entertainment ===
Purpose-built structures as venues for entertainment that accommodate audiences have produced many famous and innovative buildings, among the most recognisable of which are [[Theatre (structure)|theatre structures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newhouse|first=Victoria|title=Site and sound: the architecture and acoustics of new opera houses and concert halls|year=2012|publisher=Monacelli Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58093-281-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the ancient Greeks, "the architectural importance of the theatre is a reflection of their importance to the community, made apparent in their monumentality, in the effort put into their design, and in the care put into their detail."&lt;ref name=MacLeod&gt;Green, J.R. "The Theatre of Paphos and the Theatre of Alexandria: Some First Thoughts" in {{cite book |title=The Library of Alexandria |year=2002 |publisher=The American University in Cairo Press |location=Cairo |isbn=977-424-710-8 |editor=MacLeod, Roy}} p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans subsequently developed the stadium in an oval form known as a [[Circus (building)|circus]]. In modern times, some of the grandest buildings for entertainment have brought fame to their cities as well as their designers. The [[Sydney Opera House]], for example, is a [[World Heritage Site]] and [[The O₂ (London)|The O₂]] in London is an entertainment precinct that contains an indoor [[arena]], a music club, a cinema and exhibition space. The [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus]] in Germany is a theatre designed and built for performances of one specific musical composition.

Two of the chief architectural concerns for the design of venues for mass audiences are speed of egress and safety. The speed at which the venue empty is important both for amenity and safety, because large crowds take a long time to disperse from a badly designed venue, which creates a safety risk. The [[Hillsborough disaster]] is an example of how poor aspects of building design can contribute to audience deaths. [[Sightline]]s and [[acoustics]] are also important design considerations in most theatrical venues.

In the 21st century, entertainment venues, especially stadia, are "likely to figure among the leading architectural genres".&lt;ref name=Sheard&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheard|first=Rod|title=Sports Architecture|year=2001|publisher=Spon Press|location=London|isbn=0-419-21220-5|ref=CITEREFSheard2001}} p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they require "a whole new approach" to design, because they need to be "sophisticated entertainment centres, multi-experience venues, capable of being enjoyed in many diverse ways".{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=xvi}} Hence, architects now have to design "with two distinct functions in mind, as sports and entertainment centres playing host to live audiences, and as sports and entertainment studios serving the viewing and listening requirements of the remote audience".{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=xvi}}

=== Architecture as entertainment ===
[[File:Sleepingbeautycastle50.jpg|[[Sleeping Beauty]]|thumb|left|Inauthentic castle in [[Disneyland]] amusement park]]
Architects who push the boundaries of design or construction sometimes create buildings that are entertaining because they exceed the expectations of the public and the client and are aesthetically outstanding. Buildings such as [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]], designed by [[Frank Gehry]], are of this type, becoming a tourist attraction as well as a significant international museum. Other apparently usable buildings are really [[folly|follies]], deliberately constructed for a decorative purpose and never intended to be practical.

On the other hand, sometimes architecture is entertainment, while pretending to be functional. The tourism industry, for example, creates or renovates buildings as "attractions" that have either never been used or can never be used for their ostensible purpose. They are instead re-purposed to entertain visitors often by simulating cultural experiences. Buildings, history and sacred spaces are thus made into commodities for purchase. Such intentional tourist attractions divorce buildings from the past so that "the difference between historical authenticity and contemporary entertainment venues/theme parks becomes hard to define".&lt;ref name=Lasansky&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFLasansky2004|last=Lasansky|first=D. Medina|title=Architecture and Tourism: Perception, Performance and Place|year=2004|edition=English|publisher=Berg Publishers|isbn=1-85973-709-9|author2=McLaren, Brian}} p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include "the preservation of the [[Alcázar of Toledo]], with its grim Civil War History, the conversion of slave dungeons into tourist attractions in Ghana, [such as, for example, [[Cape Coast Castle]]] and the presentation of indigenous culture in Libya".{{sfnp|Lasansky|2004|p=xvii, Part II, Ch. 4, 5, 6}} The specially constructed buildings in amusement parks represent the park's theme and are usually neither authentic nor completely functional.

== Effects of developments in electronic media ==

=== Globalisation ===
By the second half of the 20th century, developments in electronic [[Media (communication)|media]] made possible the delivery of entertainment products to mass audiences across the globe. The technology enabled people to see, hear and participate in all the familiar forms{{snd}} stories, theatre, music, dance{{snd}} wherever they live. The rapid development of entertainment technology was assisted by improvements in [[data storage device]]s such as [[Compact Cassette|cassette tapes]] or [[compact disc]]s, along with increasing [[miniaturisation]]. Computerisation and the development of [[barcodes]] also made ticketing easier, faster and global.

=== Obsolescence ===
In the 1940s, [[radio]] was the electronic medium for family entertainment and information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garratt|first=G.R.M.|title=The early history of radio: from Faraday to Marconi|year=1994|publisher=Institution of Electrical Engineers, in association with the Science Museum|location=London|isbn=0-85296-845-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Radio reader: essays in the cultural history of radio|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-92820-6|editor1=Hilmes, Michele |editor2=Loviglio, Jason }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cox|first=Jim|title=The great radio sitcoms|year=2007|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=978-0-7864-3146-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, it was [[television]] that was the new medium and it rapidly became global, bringing visual entertainment, first in black and white, then in colour, to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spigel|first=Lynn|title=Make room for TV: television and the family ideal in postwar America|year=1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-76966-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s, [[history of video games|games]] could be played electronically, then [[Handheld video game|hand-held]] devices provided mobile entertainment, and by the last decade of the 20th century, via [[online game|networked play]]. In combination with products from the entertainment industry, all the traditional forms of entertainment became available personally. People could not only select an entertainment product such as a piece of music, film or game, they could choose the time and place to use it. The "proliferation of portable media players and the emphasis on the computer as a site for film consumption" together have significantly changed how audiences encounter films.&lt;ref name=Tryon&gt;{{cite book|last=Tryon|first=Chuck|title=Reinventing Cinema: Movies in the Age of Media Convergence|year=2009|publisher=Rutgers University Press|pages=6, 9|isbn=978-0-8135-4546-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most notable consequences of the rise of electronic entertainment has been the rapid [[obsolescence]] of the various recording and storage methods. As an example of speed of change driven by electronic media, over the course of one generation, television as a medium for receiving standardised entertainment products went from unknown, to novel, to ubiquitous and finally to superseded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Television after TV: Essays on a Medium in Transition|year=2004|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-3383-X|editors=Spigel, Lynn; Olsson, Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt; One estimate was that by 2011 over 30 percent of households in the US would own a [[Wii]] console, "about the same percentage that owned a television in 1953".&lt;ref name=Cogburn&gt;{{cite book|last=Cogburn|first=Jon|title=Philosophy Through Video Games|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-98857-8|page=i|author2=Silcox, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some expected that halfway through the second decade of the 21st century, online entertainment would have completely replaced television—which didn't happen. The so-called "[[digital revolution]]" has produced an increasingly transnational marketplace that has caused difficulties for governments, business, industries, and individuals, as they all try to keep up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doyle|first=Gillian|title=Media Ownership: The Economics and Politics of Convergence and Concentration in the UK and European Media|year=2002|publisher=SAGE|format=Google eBook|isbn=0-7619-6680-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=John|title=Scheduling: the last creative act in television?|journal=Media Culture Society|date=January 2000|volume=22|series=Bournemouth University/Large Door Productions|issue=1|pages=25–38|doi=10.1177/016344300022001002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the UK: {{cite web|last=Tryhorn|first=Chris|title=Government thinktank to tackle media convergence issues|url=http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=22 November 2012|date=21 December 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121120032/http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|archivedate=21 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;And for example, in Australia: {{cite web|title=Convergence Review|url=http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|date=30 April 2012|publisher=Australian Government: Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy|accessdate=23 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121120032/http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|archivedate=21 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the sports stadium of the future will increasingly compete with television viewing "...in terms of comfort, safety and the constant flow of audio-visual information and entertainment available."{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=49}} Other flow on effects of the shift are likely to include those on public architecture such as hospitals and nursing homes, where television, regarded as an essential entertainment service for patients and residents, will need to be replaced by access to the internet. At the same time, the ongoing need for entertainers as "professional engagers" shows the continuity of traditional entertainment.&lt;ref name=Power&gt;{{cite news|last=Power|first=Julie|title=Laughter and music better than drugs for dementia patients|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/health/laughter-and-music-better-than-drugs-for-dementia-patients-20130802-2r4w9.html|accessdate=3 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convergence ===
By the second decade of the 21st century, [[analogue recording]] was being replaced by [[digital recording]] and all forms of electronic entertainment began to [[technological convergence|converge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dwyer|first=Tim|title=Media Convergence|year=2010|publisher=Open University Press McGraw-Hill Education|location=Maidenhead, Berkshire, England and New York|isbn=978-0-335-22873-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, convergence is challenging standard practices in the film industry: whereas "success or failure used to be determined by the first weekend of its run. Today,&amp;nbsp;... a series of exhibition 'windows', such as DVD, pay-per-view, and fibre-optic video-on-demand are used to maximise profits."{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|p=156}} Part of the industry's adjustment is its release of new commercial product directly via video hosting services. Media convergence is said to be more than technological: the convergence is cultural as well.{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|pp=22, 30 ''ff''}} It is also "the result of a deliberate effort to protect the interests of business entities, policy institutions and other groups".&lt;ref name=Tryon/&gt; Globalisation and [[cultural imperialism]] are two of the cultural consequences of convergence.{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|p=30}} Others include [[fandom]] and interactive storytelling as well as the way that single franchises are distributed through and affect a range of delivery methods.&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Henry|title=Convergence culture: where old and new media collide|year=2006|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-8147-4281-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "greater diversity in the ways that signals may be received and packaged for the viewer, via terrestrial, satellite or cable television, and of course, via the Internet" also affects entertainment venues, such as sports stadia, which now need to be designed so that both live and remote audiences can interact in increasingly sophisticated ways{{snd}} for example, audiences can "watch highlights, call up statistics", "order tickets and merchandise" and generally "tap into the stadium's resources at any time of the day or night".{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=xvi}}

The introduction of television altered the availability, cost, variety and quality of entertainment products for the public and the convergence of online entertainment is having a similar effect. For example, the possibility and popularity of user-generated content, as distinct from commercial product, creates a "networked audience model [that] makes programming obsolete".{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|p=536}} Individuals and corporations use [[video hosting service]]s to broadcast content that is equally accepted by the public as legitimate entertainment.

While technology increases demand for entertainment products and offers increased speed of delivery, the forms that make up the content are in themselves, relatively stable. Storytelling, music, theatre, dance and games are recognisably the same as in earlier centuries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13574">[[File:Wainwright building st louis USA.jpg|thumb|The [[Wainwright Building]] in [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]], designed by [[Louis Sullivan]], is emblematic of his famous maxim "form follows function".|300x300px]]
'''Form follows function''' is a principle associated with 20th-century [[modern architecture|modernist architecture]] and [[industrial design]] which says that the shape of a building or object should primarily relate to its intended function or purpose.

== Origins of the phrase ==
The architect [[Louis Sullivan]] coined the [[Saying|maxim]], although it is often incorrectly attributed to the sculptor [[Horatio Greenough]] (1805{{en dash}}1852),&lt;ref&gt;Horatio Greenough, ''Form and Function: Remarks on Art'', edited by Harold A. Small (Berkeley, Univ. of California Press, 1947), although the theory of inherent forms, of which the ijaz phrase is a fitting summary, informs all of Greenough's writing on art, design, and architecture.

Greenough was in his architectural writings influenced by the [[transcendentalist]] thinking and the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] protestantism of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].&lt;/ref&gt; whose thinking mostly predates the later [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalist]] approach to architecture. Greenough's writings were for a long time largely forgotten, and were rediscovered only in the 1930s. In 1947, a selection of his essays was published as ''Form and Function: Remarks on Art by Horatio Greenough''.

Sullivan was Greenough's much younger compatriot, and admired rationalist thinkers such as [[Henry David Thoreau|Thoreau]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]], [[Walt Whitman|Whitman]], and [[Herman Melville|Melville]], as well as Greenough himself. In 1896, Sullivan coined the phrase in an article titled ''The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/tallofficebuildi00sull|title=The tall office building artistically considered|last=Sullivan|first=Louis H.|date=1896|others=Getty Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he later attributed the core idea to the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] architect, engineer, and author [[Marcus Vitruvius Pollio]], who first asserted in his book ''[[De architectura]]'' that a structure must exhibit the three qualities of firmitas, utilitas, venustas – that is, it must be solid, useful, beautiful.&lt;ref name="idea"&gt;{{cite book |title=Autobiography of an Idea |last=Sullivan |first=Louis |year=1924 |publisher=Press of the American institute of Architects, Inc. |location=New York City |page=108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan actually wrote "form ever follows function", but the simpler and less emphatic phrase is more widely remembered. For Sullivan this was distilled wisdom, an aesthetic credo, the single "rule that shall permit of no exception". The full quote is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
"Whether it be the sweeping eagle in his flight, or the open apple-blossom, the toiling work-horse, the blithe swan, the branching oak, the winding stream at its base, the drifting clouds, over all the coursing sun, '''''form ever follows function''''', and this is the law.  Where function does not change, form does not change. The granite rocks, the ever-brooding hills, remain for ages; the lightning lives, comes into shape, and dies, in a twinkling. 
It is the pervading law of all things organic and inorganic, of all things physical and metaphysical, of all things human and all things superhuman, of all true manifestations of the head, of the heart, of the soul, that the life is recognizable in its expression, '''that form ever follows function.''' ''This is the law.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sullivan | first=Louis H. | title=The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered | journal=Lippincott's Magazine | issue=March 1896 | pages=403–409 | year=1896 |url= https://archive.org/details/tallofficebuildi00sull }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sullivan developed the shape of the tall steel [[skyscraper]] in late 19th Century [[Chicago]] at a moment in which technology, taste and economic forces converged and made it necessary to break with established styles. If the shape of the building was not going to be chosen out of the old pattern book, something had to determine form, and according to Sullivan it was going to be the purpose of the building. Thus, "form follows function", as opposed to "form follows precedent". Sullivan's assistant [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] adopted and professed the same principle in a slightly different form—perhaps because shaking off the old styles gave them more freedom and latitude.

In 1908, the Austrian architect [[Adolf Loos]] wrote an allegorical essay titled "[[Ornament and Crime]]" in reaction to the excessive invented ornament used by the [[Vienna Secession]] architects. Modernists adopted Loos's moralistic argument as well as Sullivan's maxim. Loos had worked as a carpenter in the USA. He celebrated efficient plumbing and industrial artifacts like corn silos and steel water towers as examples of functional design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Loos, A.|year=1908|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~art/Temporary_SL/177/pdfs/Loos.pdf|title=Ornament and Crime|location=Innsbruck, reprint Vienna, 1930}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary-inline|date=May 2014}}

== Application in different fields ==

=== Architecture ===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2011}}
The phrase '''"form (ever) follows function"''' became a [[battle cry]] of Modernist architects after the 1930s. The credo was taken to imply that decorative elements, which architects call "ornament", were superfluous in modern buildings. However, Sullivan himself neither thought nor designed along such lines at the peak of his career. Indeed, while his buildings could be spare and crisp in their principal masses, he often punctuated their plain surfaces with eruptions of lush [[Art Nouveau|art nouveau]] and [[Celtic Revival|celtic revival]] decorations, usually cast in iron or terracotta, and ranging from organic forms like vines and ivy, to more geometric designs, and interlace, inspired by his Irish design heritage. Probably the most famous example is the writhing green ironwork that covers the entrance canopies of the [[Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building]] on South State Street in Chicago. These ornaments, often executed by the talented younger draftsman in Sullivan's employ, would eventually become Sullivan's trademark; to students of architecture, they are his instantly recognizable signature.

=== Product design ===

One episode in the history of the inherent conflict between functional design and the demands of the marketplace took place in 1935, after the introduction of the streamlined [[Chrysler Airflow]], when the American auto industry temporarily halted attempts to introduce optimal aerodynamic forms into mass manufacture. Some car-makers thought aerodynamic efficiency would result in a single optimal auto-body shape, a "teardrop" shape, which would not be good for unit sales.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Meikle's "Twentieth Century Limited:  Industrial Design in America, 1925 &amp;ndash; 1939"&lt;/ref&gt; [[General Motors]] adopted two different positions on streamlining, one meant for its internal engineering community, the other meant for its customers. Like the annual model year change, so-called aerodynamic styling is often meaningless in terms of technical performance. Subsequently, [[drag coefficient]] has become both a marketing tool and a means of improving the sale-ability of a car by reducing its fuel consumption, slightly, and increasing its top speed, markedly.

The American industrial designers of the 1930s and '40s like [[Raymond Loewy]], [[Norman bel Geddes]] and [[Henry Dreyfuss]] grappled with the inherent contradictions of "form follows function" as they redesigned blenders and locomotives and duplicating machines for mass-market consumption. Loewy formulated his &lt;span id="MAYA"&gt;"MAYA" (Most Advanced Yet Acceptable)&lt;/span&gt; principle to express that product designs are bounded by functional constraints of math and materials and logic, but their acceptance is constrained by social expectations. His advice was that for very new technologies, they should be made as familiar as possible, but for familiar technologies, they should be made surprising.

By honestly applying "form follows function", industrial designers had the potential to put their clients out of business.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Some simple single-purpose objects like screwdrivers and pencils and teapots might be reducible to a single optimal form, precluding [[product differentiation]]. Some objects made too durable would prevent sales of replacements. (''cf.'' [[planned obsolescence]]) From the standpoint of functionality, some products are simply unnecessary.

[[Victor Papanek]] (died 1998) was an influential recent designer and design philosopher who taught and wrote as a proponent of "form follows function."

=== Software engineering ===
It has been argued that the structure and internal quality attributes of a working, non-trivial software artifact will represent first and foremost the engineering requirements of its construction, with the influence of process being marginal, if any. This does not mean that process is irrelevant, but that processes compatible with an artifact's requirements lead to roughly similar results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle can also be applied to Enterprise Application Architectures of modern business where "function" is the Business processes which should be assisted by the enterprise architecture, or "form". If the architecture dictates how the business operates then the business is likely to suffer from inflexibility unable to adapt to change. SOA [[Service-Oriented Architecture]] enables an [[Enterprise Architect]] to rearrange the "form" of the architecture to meet the functional requirements of a business by adopting standards based communication protocols which enable interoperability.

Furthermore, [[Domain-Driven Design]] postulates that structure ([[Software architecture]], [[Design Pattern]], [[Implementation]]) should emerge from constraints of the modeled domain ([[Functional requirement]]).

While "form" and "function" may be more or less explicit and invariant concepts to the many engineering doctrines, [[Metaprogramming]] and the [[Functional programming]] paradigm lend themselves very well to explore, blur and invert the essence of those two concepts.

The [[Agile software development]] movement espouses techniques such as 'test driven development' in which the engineer begins with a minimum unit of user oriented functionality, creates an automated test for such and then implements the functionality and iterates, repeating this process. The result and argument for this discipline are that the structure or 'form' emerges from actual function and in fact because done organically, makes the project more adaptable long term as well of as higher quality because of the functional base of automated tests.

=== Automobile designing ===

If the design of an automobile conforms to its function—for instance the [[Fiat Multipla]]'s shape, which is partly due to the desire to sit six people in two rows—then its form is said to follow its function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://europe.autonews.com/article/19990719/ANE/907190815/multipla-designer-shows-that-form-follows-function|title=MULTIPLA DESIGNER SHOWS THAT FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION|work=Automotive News|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evolution ===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2011}}
According to [[Lamarck]]'s long-discredited [[Lamarckism|theory of evolution]], anatomy will be structured according to functions associated with use; for instance, [[giraffe]]s are taller to reach the leaves of [[tree]]s. By contrast, in [[evolution|Darwinian evolution]], form ([[mutation|variation]]) ''precedes'' function (as determined by [[natural selection|selection]]). This is to say, in Lamarckian evolution the form is altered by the required function, whereas in Darwinian evolution small variations in form allow some parts of the population to function "better", and are therefore more successful reproductively.

The '''Revolutionary Mexicanist Action''' ({{lang-es|Acción Revolucionaria Mexicanista}}), better known as the '''Gold shirts''' ({{lang-es|Camisas Doradas}}), was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[fascism|fascist]] paramilitary organization in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, John W., [https://books.google.com/books?id=h29VKMtmzzcC&amp;dq The Mexican right: the end of revolutionary reform, 1929-1940], p. 62, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The group was founded by general [[Nicolás Rodríguez Carrasco]] in 1933 with the official title of ''Acción Revolucionaria Mexicana'' (Mexican Revolutionary Action). Carrasco, who had been a supporter of [[Pancho Villa]] until he deserted in 1918, named the group after the ''dorados'', Villa's "golden" group of elite soldiers. The Gold shirts opposed the reforms of president [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] and were protected by former president [[Plutarco Elías Calles]], who had become an enemy of Cárdenas. The Gold Shirts often violently clashed with supporters of the [[Mexican Communist Party]] and the [[Red Shirts (Mexico)|Red Shirts]] and demanded the immediate deportation of all [[History of the Jews in Mexico|Jews]] and [[Chinese immigration to Mexico|Chinese]] from Mexico. Although the ''dorados'' copied their style from the [[Blackshirts]] and [[Sturmabteilung]], copying the [[anti-communism]] and [[authoritarianism]] of the former and the [[anti-Semitism]] of the latter,  they nonetheless lacked the fascist mission, being essentially (according to Fascism expert Payne) [[counterrevolutionary]] and [[reactionary]] and as such were more easily employed by the existing state.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley G. Payne]], ''A History of Fascism 1914-1945'', London, Roultedge, 2001, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Plutarco Elías Calles#Maximato and Exile|Maximato]] era of the formerly heavily anticlerical Calles regime, the Gold shirts were moderately in favour of [[religious liberty]] for the Catholic Church, but because they still at times acted in an [[anticlericalism|anticlericalist]] way against priests wearing the [[cassock]], [[Cristeros]] never entered their ranks.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

==Disbandment==
After Calles was deported by Cárdenas on April 9, 1936, the group lost its protector. A few months later, Rodríguez was arrested and deported to [[Texas]] in August 1936, from where he continued to lead the group until his death in 1940. After Mexico's declaration of war upon the [[Axis powers]] on May 22, 1942, the Gold shirts were banned.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5436">The '''Heresies Collective''' was founded in 1976 in [[New York City]], by a group of [[feminist]] political artists. The group sought to, among other goals, examine art from a feminist and political perspective. In addition to a variety of actions and cultural output, the collective was responsible for the overseeing the publication of the journal [[Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics|Heresies: A feminist publication on art and politics]], which was published from 1977 until 1993.

== Background ==
The Heresies Collective was founded in 1976 by a group of feminist artists, with the goal of increasing discourse around the ideas of feminism, politics, and their relationship to art. The Heresies Collective's primary output was a reoccurring publication titled [[Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics|Heresies: A feminist publication on art and politics]]. The goals of the collective, through the publication of their journal, were to encourage the writing of feminist history, generate new creative energies among women artists, broaden the definition of art, and articulate diversity within the art world. In addition to the goals of encouraging and supporting feminist political art, the collective sought to stimulate dialogue around radical political and esthetic theory, and reject the [[capitalist]] framework of the art world through interrogating the processes by which art is created, critiqued, and consumed.&lt;ref name=Collective&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heresies Collective|title=Feminism, Art and Politics|journal=Heresies: A feminist publication on art and politics|date=January 1977|volume=1|issue=1|url=http://heresiesfilmproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/heresies1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Members===
The founding collective members listed in the first publication were:&lt;ref name=Collective/&gt; [[Patsy Beckert]], [[Joan Braderman]], [[Mary Beth Edelson]], [[Harmony Hammond]], [[Elizabeth Hess]], [[Joyce Kozloff]], [[Arlene Ladden]], [[Lucy Lippard]], [[Mary Miss]], [[Marty Pottenger]], [[Miriam Schapiro]], [[Joan Snyder]], [[Elke Solomon]], [[Pat Steir]], [[May Stevens]], [[Susana Torre]], [[Elizabeth Weatherford]], [[Sally Webster]], and [[Nina Yankowitz]].

Numerous other feminist artists contributed to the publication over the years, and participated in the collective structure. The film, The Heretics, by collective member [[Joan Braderman]], lists the following additional women as members of the Heresies Collective:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Braderman|first1=Joan|title=The Women|url=http://heresiesfilmproject.org/the-women/|website=The Heretics|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joan Snyder]], [[Pat Steir]], [[Michelle Stuart]], [[Emma Amos (painter)|Emma Amos]], Patsy Beckert, [[Janet Froelich]], [[Su Friedrich]], [[Ida Applebroog]], Sue Heinemann, [[Sabra Moore]], [[Miriam Schapiro]], [[Cecilia Vicuna]], [[Nina Yankowitz]], and [[Amy Sillman]].

==Collective Activities==
While the publication was the primary activity of the collective, members of the group were also involved with other arts and political movements in New York. The collective was featured in an exhibit at the [[New Museum]] in 1983, titled [[Classified: Big Pages from the Heresies Collective]]. The exhibit featured large scale works from members of the collective, and was curated in part by [[En Foco]], as part of the Events series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carson|first1=Julie|chapter=On Discourse as Monument: Institutional Spaces and Feminist Problematics|editor1-last=Ault|editor1-first=Julie|title=Alternative art, New York, 1965 - 1985: a cultural politics book for the Social Text Collective|date=2002|publisher=Drawing Center|location=New York|pages=121–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 the collective staged a demonstration in front of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] called the [[Women Artists Visibility Event (W.A.V.E.) / Let MOMA Know|Women Artists Visibility Event (W.A.V.E.)]], or Let MOMA Know, aimed at raising awareness about the poor representation of women artists at the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://voices.revealdigital.com/cgi-bin/independentvoices?a=d&amp;d=DFDEGHA19840601.1.2&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN---------------1|title="Let MOMA Know: Women Artists Visibility Event (W.A.V.E) at the Museum of Modern Art on Flag Day, 14 June 1984"|last=Osterman|first=Gladys|date=1984|website=Independent Voices|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''heuristic argument''' is an [[argument]] that reasons from the value of a method or principle that has been shown by experimental (especially [[trial-and-error]]) investigation to be a useful aid in learning, discovery and [[problem-solving]]. A widely used and important example of a [[heuristic]] argument is [[Occam's Razor]].

It is a speculative, non-rigorous argument, that relies on an analogy or on intuition, that allows one to achieve a result or approximation to be checked later with more rigor; otherwise the results are of doubt. It is used as a hypothesis or conjecture in an investigation. It can also be used as a mnemonic.&lt;ref name="BrodskyEllis1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brodsky|first1=Stanley J.|last2=Ellis|first2=John|last3=Karliner|first3=Marek|title=Chiral symmetry and the spin of the proton|journal=Physics Letters B|volume=206|issue=2|year=1988|pages=309–315|doi=10.1016/0370-2693(88)91511-0|url=http://www.slac.stanford.edu/cgi-wrap/getdoc/slac-pub-4519.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''iceberg theory''' (sometimes known as the "'''theory of omission'''") is a style of [[writing]] (turned colloquialism) coined by American writer [[Ernest Hemingway]]. As a young journalist, Hemingway had to focus his newspaper reports on immediate events, with very little context or interpretation. When he became a writer of short stories, he retained this [[Minimalism|minimalistic]] style, focusing on surface elements without explicitly discussing underlying themes. Hemingway believed the deeper meaning of a story should not be evident on the surface, but should shine through implicitly.

== Background ==
Like other American writers such as  [[Mark Twain]], [[Stephen Crane]], [[Theodore Dreiser]], [[Sinclair Lewis]] and [[Willa Cather]], Hemingway worked as a journalist before becoming a novelist. After graduating from high school he went to work as a cub reporter for ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'',&lt;ref name="Meyers p23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he quickly learned that truth often lurks below the surface of a story.&lt;ref name="Reynolds 1998 17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reynolds|1998|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He learned about corruption in city politics, and that in hospital emergency rooms and police stations a mask of cynicism was worn "like armour to shield whatever vulnerabilities remained".&lt;ref name="Reynolds 1998 17"/&gt; In his pieces he wrote about relevant events, excluding the background. As foreign correspondent for the ''[[Toronto Star]]'', while living in Paris in the early 1920s,  he covered the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War]] in more than a dozen articles. As his biographer Jeffrey Meyers explains, "he objectively reported only the immediate events in order to achieve a concentration and intensity of focus—a spotlight rather than a stage".&lt;ref name="Meyers pp98-99"&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| pp=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the Greco-Turkish War he gained valuable writing experience that he translated to the writing of fiction. He believed fiction could be based on reality, but that if an experience were to be distilled, as he explained,  then "what he made up was truer than what he remembered".&lt;ref name="Meyers pp98-99"/&gt;

|style="text"-align: left;"|—Ernest Hemingway in ''[[Death in the Afternoon]]''&lt;ref&gt;qtd. in {{Harvnb|Oliver|1999|p=322}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

In 1923, Hemingway conceived of the idea of a new theory of writing after finishing his short story "Out of Season". In ''[[A Moveable Feast]]'', his posthumously published memoirs about his years as a young writer in Paris, he explains: "I omitted the real end [of "Out of Season"] which was that the old man hanged himself. This was omitted on my new theory that you could omit anything&amp;nbsp;... and the omitted part would strengthen the story."&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;  In chapter sixteen of ''[[Death in the Afternoon]]'' he compares his theory about writing to an iceberg.&lt;!-- expand and add quotation here --&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

Hemingway's biographer [[Carlos Baker]] believed that as a writer of short stories Hemingway learned "how to get the most from the least, how to prune language and avoid waste motion, how to multiply intensities, and how to tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth."&lt;ref name ="Baker p117"&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|1972|p= 117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baker also notes that the writing style of the "iceberg theory" suggests that a story's narrative and nuanced complexities, complete with symbolism, operate under the surface of the story itself.&lt;ref name ="Baker p117"/&gt;

For example, Hemingway believed a writer could describe an action, such as Nick Adams fishing in "[[Big Two-Hearted River]]," while conveying a ''different'' message about the action itself—Nick Adams concentrating on fishing to the extent that he does not have to think about the unpleasantness of his war experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oliver|1999|pp=321–322}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his essay "The Art of the Short Story", Hemingway is clear about his method: "A few things I have found to be true. If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened. If you leave or skip something because you do not know it, the story will be worthless. The test of any story is how very good the stuff that you, not your editors, omit."&lt;ref name="HemingwaySS"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hemingway, The Art of the Short Story}}&lt;/ref&gt; A writer explained how it brings a story ''gravitas'':

{{quote|Hemingway said that only the tip of the iceberg showed in fiction—your reader will see only what is above the water—but the knowledge that you have about your character that never makes it into the story acts as the bulk of the iceberg. And that is what gives your story weight and gravitas.|[[Jenna Blum]] in ''The Author at Work'', 2013&lt;ref name=JennaBlum8&gt;Jenna Blum, 2013, ''The Modern Scholar'' published by Recorded Books, ''The Author at Work: The Art of Writing Fiction'', Disk 1, Track 9, {{ISBN|978-1-4703-8437-1}}, "... that is what gives your story weight and gravitas. ... "&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From reading [[Rudyard Kipling]] Hemingway absorbed the practice of shortening [[prose]] as much as it could take. Of the concept of omission, Hemingway wrote in "The Art of the Short Story": "You could omit anything if you knew that you omitted and the omitted part would strengthen the story and make people feel something more than they understood."&lt;ref name="Meyers p114"&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; By making invisible the structure of the story, he believed the author strengthened the piece of fiction and that the "quality of a piece could be judged by the quality of the material the author eliminated."&lt;ref name="Meyers p114"/&gt; His style added to the aesthetic: using "declarative sentences and direct representations of the visible world" with simple and plain language, Hemingway became "the most influential prose stylist in the twentieth century" according to biographer Meyers.&lt;ref name="Meyers p114"/&gt;

In her paper "Hemingway's Camera Eye", Zoe Trodd explains that Hemingway uses repetition in prose to build a collage of snapshots to create an entire picture. Of his iceberg theory, she claims, it "is also a glacier waterfall, infused with movement by his multi-focal aesthetic".&lt;ref name="Trodd"&gt;{{Harvnb|Trodd|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, she believes that Hemingway's iceberg theory "demanded that the reader feel the ''whole'' story" and that the reader is meant to "fill the gaps left by his omissions with their feelings".&lt;ref name="Trodd"/&gt;

Hemingway scholar Jackson Benson believes Hemingway used autobiographical details to work as framing devices to write about life in general—not only about his life. For example, Benson postulates that Hemingway used his experiences and drew them out further with "what if" scenarios: "what if I were wounded in such a way that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?" By separating himself from the characters he created, Hemingway strengthens the drama. The means of achieving a strong drama is to minimize, or omit, the feelings that produced the fiction he wrote.&lt;ref name ="Benson"&gt;{{Harvnb|Benson|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemingway's iceberg theory highlights the symbolic implications of art. He makes use of physical action to provide an interpretation of the nature of man's existence. It can be convincingly proved that, "while representing human life through fictional forms, he has consistently set man against the background of his world and universe to examine the human situation from various points of view."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Early fiction and short stories ==
Gwendolyn Tetlow believes that Hemingway's early fiction such as "[[Indian Camp]]" shows his lack of concern for [[Character (arts)|character development]] by simply placing the character in his or her surroundings. However, in "Indian Camp" the use of descriptive detail such as a screaming woman, men smoking tobacco, and an infected wound build a sense of veracity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tetlow|pp=53–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In other words, a story can communicate by [[subtext]]; for instance, Hemingway's "[[Hills Like White Elephants]]" does not mention the word "abortion", although in the story the male character seems to be attempting to convince his girlfriend to have an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellow|1992|p=348}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Big Two-Hearted River" Hemingway explains "is about a boy ... coming home from the war ... So the war, all mention of the war, anything about the war, is omitted."&lt;ref name="HemingwaySS"/&gt; Hemingway intentionally left out something in "Indian Camp" and "Big Two-Hearted River"—two stories he considered to be good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baker explains that Hemingway's stories about sports are often about the athletes themselves and that the sport is incidental to the story. Moreover, the story "[[A Clean Well Lighted Place]]" which on the surface is about nothing more than men drinking in a cafe late at night, is in fact about that which brings the men to the cafe to drink, and the reasons they seek light in the night—none of which is available in the surface of the plot, but lurks in the iceberg below.&lt;ref name="Baker 1972 123–125"&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|1972|pp=123–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemingway's story "Big Two-Hearted River" is ostensibly about nothing, as is "A Clean Well Lighted Place", but within nothing lies the crux of the story.&lt;ref name="Baker 1972 123–125"/&gt;

== Novels ==
Benson believes that the omission Hemingway applies functions as a sort of buffer between himself as the creator of a character and the character. He explains that as an author creates a "distance" between himself and the character he "becomes more practiced, it would seem." Benson says in Hemingway's fiction the distance is necessary, and successful in early fiction such as in ''[[The Sun Also Rises]],'' but if he as "the author does not deliberately create such distance the fiction fails," as in the later works such as ''[[Across the River and into the Trees]]''.&lt;ref name ="Benson"/&gt;

Baker calls Hemingway's ''Across the River and into the Trees'' a "lyric-poetical novel" in which each scene has an underlying truth presented via [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]].&lt;ref name= "Baker1972 pp274-255"&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|1972|pp=274–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Meyers an example of omission is that Renata, like other heroines in Hemingway's fiction, suffers a major "shock"—the murder of her father and the subsequent loss of her home—to which Hemingway alludes only briefly.&lt;ref name= "Meyers1985 p445"&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985|p=445}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemingway's pared down narrative forces the reader to solve connections. As Stoltzfus remarks: "Hemingway walks the reader to the bridge that he must cross alone without the narrator's help."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stoltzfus|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemingway believed that if context or background had been written about by another, and written about well, then it could be left out of his writing. Of ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'' he explains: "In writing you are limited to by what has already been done satisfactorily. So I have tried to do something else. First I have tried to eliminate everything unnecessary to conveying experience to the reader so that after he has read something it will become part of his experience and seem actually to have happened."&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;qtd in {{Harvnb|Smith|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Smith, author of ''Hemingway's Early Manuscript: The Theory and Practice of Omission'', believes Hemingway applied the theory of omission in effort to "strengthen [the] iceberg".&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
In October 1954 Hemingway received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. He jokingly told the press he believed [[Carl Sandburg]] and [[Isak Dinesen]] deserved the prize more than he, but that the prize money would be welcome.&lt;ref name="Baker p338"&gt;{{Harvnb|Baker|1972| p=338}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize was awarded to Hemingway "for his mastery of the art of narrative, most recently demonstrated in ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'', and for the influence that he has exerted on contemporary style."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1954/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1954 |year=1954 |work= Nobelprize.org|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days after the announcement, Hemingway spoke with a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine correspondent, while on his boat fishing off the coast of Cuba. When asked about the use of symbolism in his work, and particularly in the most recently published ''Old Man and the Sea'', he explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No good book has ever been written that has in it symbols arrived at beforehand and stuck in ... That kind of symbol sticks out like raisins in raisin bread. Raisin bread is all right, but plain bread is better. ... I tried to make a real old man, a real boy, a real sea, a real fish and real sharks. But if I made them good and true enough they would mean many things. The hardest thing is to make something really true and sometimes truer than true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,935439-5,00.html|title= An American Storyteller |date=13 December 1954 |work= Time Magazine |publisher=Time, Inc.|accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Critical reception==

[[File:Thangka of Buddha with the One Hundred Jataka Tales, Tibet, 13th-14th century.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thangka]] of Buddha with the One Hundred Jataka Tales in the background, [[Tibet]], 13th-14th century.]]

The '''Jātaka tales''' are a voluminous body of literature native to [[India]] concerning the previous births of [[Gautama Buddha]] in both human and animal form. The future Buddha may appear as a king, an outcast, a god, an elephant—but, in whatever form, he exhibits some virtue that the tale thereby inculcates.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/301580/Jataka | title = Jataka | accessdate = 2011-12-04 | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica }}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, Jātaka tales include an extensive cast of characters who interact and get into various kinds of trouble - whereupon the Buddha character intervenes to resolve all the problems and bring about a [[happy ending]].

In [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]], the Jātakas are a textual division of the [[Pāli Canon]], included in the [[Khuddaka Nikaya]] of the ''[[Sutta Pitaka]]''. The term ''Jātaka'' may also refer to a traditional commentary on this book.

==History==
The Jātakas  are amongst the earliest Buddhist literature, with metrical analysis methods dating their average contents to around the 4th century BCE.&lt;ref name="autogenerated286"&gt;Warder, A.K. ''Indian Buddhism''. 2000. pp. 286-287&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mahāsāṃghika]] [[Caitika]] sects from the [[Andhra Pradesh|Āndhra]] region took the Jātakas as canonical literature and are known to have rejected some of the Theravāda Jātakas which dated past the time of King [[Ashoka]] .&lt;ref&gt;Sujato, Bhikkhu. ''Sects &amp; Sectarianism: The Origins of Buddhist Schools.'' 2006. p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; The Caitikas claimed that their own Jātakas represented the original collection before the Buddhist tradition split into various lineages.&lt;ref name="autogenerated286"/&gt;

According to [[A. K. Warder]], the Jātakas are the precursors to the various legendary biographies of the Buddha, which were composed at later dates.&lt;ref name="autogenerated332"&gt;Warder, A.K. ''Indian Buddhism''. 2000. pp. 332-333&lt;/ref&gt; Although many Jātakas were written from an early period, which describe previous lives of the Buddha, very little biographical material about Gautama's own life has been recorded.&lt;ref name="autogenerated332"/&gt;

The Jātaka-Mālā of Arya Śura in Sanskrit gives 34 Jātaka stories.&lt;ref&gt;THE JATAKA-MALA

HENDRIK KERN, https://archive.org/details/jatakamala015656mbp&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Ajanta Caves]], Jātaka scenes are inscribed with quotes from Arya Shura,&lt;ref&gt;Literary History of Sanskrit Buddhism: From Winternitz, Sylvain Levi, Huber, By Gushtaspshah K. Nariman, Moriz Winternitz, Sylvain Lévi, Edouard Huber, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1972 p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; with script datable to the sixth century. It had already been translated into Chinese in 434 CE. [[Borobudur]] contains depictions of all 34 Jatakas from Jataka Mala.&lt;ref&gt;Jataka/Avadana Stories&amp;nbsp;— Table of Contents {{cite web |url=http://www.borobudur.tv/avadana_01.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051222063241/http://www.borobudur.tv/avadana_01.htm |archivedate=2005-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Reliëf Borobudur TMnr 60042617.jpg|thumb|right|Khudda-bodhi-Jataka, [[Borobudur]] ]]

==Contents==
The Theravāda Jātakas comprise 547 poems, arranged roughly by an increasing number of verses. According to Professor von Hinüber,&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Pali Literature'', Walter de Gruyter, Berlin, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; only the last 50 were intended to be intelligible by themselves, without commentary. The commentary gives stories in prose that it claims provide the context for the verses, and it is these stories that are of interest to [[folklorists]]. Alternative versions of some of the stories can be found in another book of the Pali Canon, the [[Cariyapitaka]], and a number of individual stories can be found scattered around other books of the Canon. Many of the stories and motifs found in the Jātaka such as the [[Moon Rabbit|Rabbit in the Moon]] of the Śaśajātaka (Jataka Tales: no.316),&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/j3/j3017.htm sacred-texts.com] (accessed: Saturday January 23, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; are found in numerous other languages and media. For example, The Monkey and the Crocodile, The Turtle Who Couldn't Stop Talking and The Crab and the Crane that are listed below also famously featured in the Hindu [[Panchatantra]], the Sanskrit ''niti-shastra'' that ubiquitously influenced world literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jacobs|1888}}, Introduction, page lviii "What, the reader will exclaim, "the first literary link [1570] between India and England, between Buddhism and Christendom, written in racy Elizabethan with vivacious dialogue, and something distinctly resembling a plot. . . ."&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the stories and motifs are translations from the Pali but others are instead derived from vernacular oral traditions prior to the Pali compositions.&lt;ref&gt;"Indian Stories",''The History of World Literature'', Grant L. Voth, Chantilly, VA, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sanskrit]] (see for example the Jātakamālā) and [[Tibet]]an Jātaka stories tend to maintain the [[Buddhist morality]] of their Pali equivalents, but re-tellings of the stories in [[Persian language|Persian]] and other languages sometimes contain significant amendments to suit their respective cultures.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} At the [[Mahathupa]] in [[Sri Lanka]] all 550 Jataka tales were represented inside of the reliquary chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|John Strong|2004|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reliquaries often depict the Jataka tales.

==Jātaka stupas==
[[File:Mankiala_Stupa-3.JPG|thumb|The [[Mankiala stupa]] in northern [[Pakistan]] marks the spot where, according to the Jataka, [[Prince Sattva|an incarnation of Buddha]] sacrificed himself to feed tigers.&lt;ref name="A.A. Knopf"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bernstein|first1=Richard|title=Ultimate Journey: Retracing the Path of an Ancient Buddhist Monk who Crossed Asia in Search of Enlightenment|date=2001|publisher=A.A. Knopf|isbn=9780375400094|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-D0Tsbmep7QC&amp;q=Mankiala+tiger&amp;dq=Mankiala+tiger&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHkPD6r8PUAhUS4GMKHeELBYcQ6AEIMjAC|accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Many [[stupa]]s in northern India are said to mark locations from the Jātaka tales; the Chinese pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] reported several of these. A stupa in [[Pushkalavati]], in northwestern [[Pakistan]], marks where Syama fulfilled his filial duty to his blind parents. The [[Mankiala stupa]] near [[Gujar Khan]] commemorates the spot where Prince Sattva sacrificed himself to feed baby tigers.&lt;ref name="A.A. Knopf"/&gt; Nearby the ascetic Ekasrnga was seduced by a beautiful woman. In Mangalura, Ksantivadin submitted to mutilation by a king. At Hadda Mountain a young Brahmin sacrificed himself to learn a half verse of the dharma. At Sarvadattaan an incarnation sold himself for ransom to make offerings to a Brahmin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|John Strong|2004|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Faxian]] describes the four great stupas as being adorned with precious substances. At one site king Sibi sacrifices his flesh to ransom a dove from a hawk. Another incarnation gave up his eyes when asked; a third incarnation sacrificed his body to feed a hungry tigress. As King Candraprabha he cut off his head as a gift to a Brahmin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|John Strong|2004|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some would sever their body parts in front of stupas that contained relics; or even end their own lives.

==Apocrypha==
Within the Pali tradition, there are also many [[apocryphal]] Jātakas of later composition (some dated even to the 19th century) but these are treated as a separate category of literature from the "Official" Jātaka stories that have been more or less formally canonized from at least the 5th century&amp;nbsp;— as attested to in ample epigraphic and archaeological evidence, such as extant illustrations in [[bas relief]] from ancient temple walls.

Apocryphal Jātakas of the Pali Buddhist canon, such as those belonging to the [[Paññāsa Jātaka]] collection, have been adapted to fit local culture in certain [[South East Asia]]n countries and have been retold with amendments to the plots to better reflect Buddhist morals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_tale_of_Prince_Samuttakote.html?id=xt3YAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y The tale of Prince Samuttakote: a Buddhist epic from Thailand]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.khamkoo.com/uploads/9/0/0/4/9004485/the_tham_vessantara_jataka_-_a_critical_study_of_the_vj_and_its_influence_on_kengtung_buddhism_eastern_shan_state.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebrations and ceremonies==

Sengpan Pannyawamsa, ''Recital of the Tham Vessantara Jātaka: a social-cultural phenomenon in Kengtung, Eastern Shan State, Myanmar'', Institute of Pali and Buddhist Studies, (University of Kelaniya), Sri Lanka&lt;/ref&gt; Such celebrations are associated with particular holidays on the [[lunar calendar]] used by [[Thailand]], [[Myanmar]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Laos]].

==Translations==
The standard Pali collection of jātakas, with [[canon law|canonical]] text embedded, has been translated by [[Edward Byles Cowell|E. B. Cowell]] and others, originally published in six volumes by [[Cambridge University Press]], 1895-1907; reprinted in three volumes, [[Pali Text Society]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palitext.com/ Pali Text Society Home Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Bristol. There are also numerous translations of selections and individual stories from various languages.

The ''Jātaka-Mālā'' of Arya Śura was critically edited in the original Sanskrit [Nâgarî letters] by [[Hendrik Kern]] of the [[University of Leiden]] in Netherlands, which was published as volume 1 of the [[Harvard Oriental Series]] in 1891. A second issue came in 1914.

The '''Koiarian languages''' {{IPAc-en|k|ɔɪ|ˈ|ɑr|i|ən}}&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student’s Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;  Koiari are a small family of [[Trans&amp;ndash;New Guinea languages]] spoken in the "[[Bird's Tail]]" (southeastern peninsula) of New Guinea. They are sometimes included in a speculative [[Southeast Papuan languages|Southeast Papuan]] branch of Trans&amp;ndash;New Guinea (TNG), but the Southeast Papuan families have not been shown to be any more closely related to each other than they are to other TNG families.

The languages are:

'''Libra''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː|b|r|ə}} is a [[constellation]] of the [[zodiac]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for [[weighing scales]], and its symbol is [[Image:Libra.svg|20px]] ([[Unicode]] ♎). It is fairly faint, with no [[apparent magnitude|first magnitude]] [[star]]s, and lies between [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]] to the west and [[Scorpius]] to the east. [[Beta Librae]], also known as Zubeneschamali, is the brightest star in the constellation. Three star systems are known to have planets.

==History and mythology==
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Libra.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Libra as depicted in ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'', a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825]]

Libra was known in [[Babylonian astronomy]] as ''MUL Zibanu'' (the "scales" or "balance"), or alternatively as the Claws of the Scorpion. The scales were held sacred to the sun god [[Shamash]], who was also the patron of truth and justice.&lt;ref&gt;''Babylonian Star-lore'' by Gavin White, Solaria Pubs, 2008, page 175&lt;/ref&gt; It was also seen as the Scorpion's Claws in [[ancient Greece]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=172-173}} Since these times, Libra has been associated with law, fairness and civility. In Arabic ''zubānā'' means "scorpion's claws", and likely similarly in other Semitic languages: this resemblance of words may be why the Scorpion's claws became the Scales.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} It has also been suggested that the scales are an allusion to the fact that when the sun entered this part of the [[ecliptic]] at the [[autumnal equinox]], the days and nights are equal.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; Libra's status as the location of the equinox earned the equinox the name "First Point of Libra", though this location ceased to coincide with the constellation in 730 because of the [[precession of the equinoxes]].&lt;ref&gt;P.K. Chen, A Constellation Album: Stars and Mythology of the Night Sky, p. 64 (2007, {{ISBN|978-1-931559-38-6}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Egypt the three brightest stars of Libra (α, β, and σ Librae) formed a constellation that was viewed as a boat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Priskin|first1=Gyula|title=The Astral Myth of Osiris: the Decans of Taurus and Libra|url=http://www.enim-egyptologie.fr/index.php?page=enim-9&amp;n=7|website=ENiM 9 (2016), 79-111.|accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libra is a constellation not mentioned by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] or [[Aratus]].&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; Libra is mentioned by [[Manetho]] (3rd century B.C.) and [[Geminus]] (1st century B.C.), and included by [[Ptolemy]] in his 48 [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]]s. Ptolemy catalogued 17 stars, [[Tycho Brahe]] 10, and [[Johannes Hevelius]] 20.&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Libra}}&lt;/ref&gt; It only became a constellation in [[ancient Rome]], when it began to represent the scales held by [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]], the goddess of justice, associated with [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]] in the Greek mythology.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=172-173}}

==The Constellation==
Libra is bordered by the head of [[Serpens]] to the north, [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]] to the northwest, Hydra to the southwest, the corner of [[Centaurus]] to the southwest, Lupus to the south, [[Scorpius]] to the east and  [[Ophiuchus]] to the northeast. Covering 538.1&amp;nbsp;square degrees and 1.304% of the night sky, it ranks 29th of the 88 constellations in size.&lt;ref name=tirionconst&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/constellations2.htm | title=Constellations: Lacerta–Vulpecula | work= Star Tales |author=[[Ian Ridpath|Ridpath, Ian]]|publisher=Self-published | accessdate= 3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is 'Lib'.&lt;ref name="pa30_469"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Russell | first=Henry Norris |author-link=Henry Norris Russell | title=The New International Symbols for the Constellations | journal=[[Popular Astronomy (US magazine)|Popular Astronomy]] | volume=30 | page=469 | bibcode=1922PA.....30..469R | date=1922}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 12 segments (''illustrated in infobox''). In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|14|22|08.08}} and {{RA|16|02|17.23}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between −0.47° and −30.00°.&lt;ref name="boundary"&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Libra, Constellation Boundary | work=The Constellations | publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]] | url=http://www.iau.org/public/constellations/#lib| accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whole constellation is visible to observers south of latitude 60°N.{{efn|1=While parts of the constellation technically rise above the horizon to observers between 60°N and 89°N, stars within a few degrees of the horizon are to all intents and purposes unobservable.&lt;ref name=tirionconst/&gt;}}

==Features==

===Stars===
{{see also|List of stars in Libra}}
[[Image:LibraCC.jpg|thumb|left|256px|The constellation Libra marked on a naked eye view.]]
Overall, there are 83 stars within the constellation's borders brighter than or equal to [[apparent magnitude]] 6.5.{{efn|1=Objects of magnitude 6.5 are among the faintest visible to the unaided eye in suburban-rural transition night skies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/resources/darksky/3304011.html?page=1&amp;c=y|title=The Bortle Dark-Sky Scale|last=Bortle|first=John E.|date=February 2001|work=[[Sky &amp; Telescope]]|publisher=Sky Publishing Corporation|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=tirionconst/&gt;

The brightest stars in Libra form a [[quadrilateral|quadrangle]] that distinguishes it for the unaided observer. Traditionally, Alpha and Beta Librae are considered to represent the scales' balance beam, while Gamma and Sigma are the weighing pans.

[[Alpha Librae]], called Zubenelgenubi, is a multiple star system divisible into two stars when seen through binoculars, The primary (Alpha&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Librae) is a blue-white star of magnitude 2.7 and the secondary (Alpha&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Librae) is a white star of magnitude 5.2 and spectral type F3V that is 74.9 ± 0.7 light-years from Earth.  Its traditional name means "the southern claw". Zubeneschamali ([[Beta Librae]]) is the corresponding "northern claw" to Zubenelgenubi. The brightest star in Libra, it is a green-tinged star of magnitude 2.6, 160 light-years from Earth. [[Gamma Librae]] is called Zubenelakrab, which means "the scorpion's claw", completing the suite of names referring to Libra's archaic status. It is an [[orange giant]] of magnitude 3.9, 152 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=172-173}}

[[Iota Librae]] is a complex multiple star, 377 light-years from Earth, with both optical and true binary components. The primary appears as a blue-white star of magnitude 4.5; it is a binary star indivisible in even the largest amateur instruments with a period of 23 years. The secondary, visible in small telescopes as a star of magnitude 9.4, is a binary with two components, magnitudes 10 and 11. There is an optical companion to Iota Librae; [[25 Librae]] is a star of magnitude 6.1, 219 light-years from Earth and visible in binoculars. [[Mu Librae]] is a binary star divisible in medium-aperture amateur telescopes, 235 light-years from Earth. The primary is of magnitude 5.7 and the secondary is of magnitude 6.8.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=172-173}}

[[Delta Librae]] is an [[Algol variable|Algol-type]] [[eclipsing variable]] star, 304 lightyears from Earth. It has a period of 2 days, 8 hours; its minimum magnitude of 5.9 and its maximum magnitude is 4.9. [[FX Librae]], designated [[48 Librae]], is a [[shell star]] of magnitude 4.9. Shell stars, like [[Pleione (star)|Pleione]] and [[Gamma Cassiopeiae]], are [[blue supergiant]]s with irregular variations caused by their abnormally high speed of rotation. This ejects gas from the star's equator.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=172-173}}

[[Sigma Librae]] (the proper name is Brachium&lt;ref name="IAU-LSN"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.iau.org/public/themes/naming_stars/ | title=Naming Stars |publisher=IAU.org |accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was formerly known as Gamma Scorpii despite being well inside the boundaries of Libra. It was not redesignated as Sigma Librae until 1851 by [[Benjamin A. Gould]].

===Planetary systems===
Libra is home to the [[Gliese 581 planetary system]], which consists of the star [[Gliese 581]], three confirmed planets, and two unconfirmed planets. Both [[Gliese 581d]], and [[Gliese 581g]] are debatably the most promising candidates for life, although Gliese 581g's existences has been disputed and has not been entirely confirmed or agreed on in the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Shiga |first=David |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19519-found-first-rocky-exoplanet-that-could-host-life.html |title=Found: first rocky exoplanet that could host life |publisher=[[New Scientist]]|date=September 29, 2010|accessdate=September 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gliese 581c]] is considered to be the first Earth-like [[extrasolar planet]] to be found within its parent star's [[habitable zone]]. [[Gliese 581e]] is possibly the smallest mass [[exoplanet]] orbiting a normal star found to date&lt;ref name="mayor"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://obswww.unige.ch/~udry/Gl581_preprint.pdf |author=Mayor |display-authors=etal |title=The HARPS search for southern extra-solar planets, XVIII.

The family of candidate habitable planets was extended in late September 2010 to include exoplanets around [[red dwarf]] stars because of Gliese 581g, which is a [[tidally locked]] planet in the middle of the [[habitable zone]]. Weather studies show that tidally locked planets may still have the ability to support life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/jrad/521.pdf|title=Department of Astronomy|author=|date=|website=www.astro.washington.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/space/earth-like-planet-life.html |title=Earth-Like Planet Can Sustain Life : Discovery News |publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] |date=2010-09-29 |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deep-sky objects===
Libra is home to one bright [[globular cluster]], [[NGC 5897]]. It is a loose cluster, 50,000 light-years from Earth; it is fairly large and has an integrated magnitude of 9.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=172-173}}

==Astrology==
{{Main|Libra (astrology)}}
{{As of|2002}}, the Sun appears in the constellation Libra from October 31 to November 22. In [[tropical astrology]], the Sun is considered to be in the sign [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]] from September 23 to October 22, and in [[sidereal astrology]], from October 16 to November 15.

==Namesakes==
* [[USS Libra (AKA-12)|''Libra'' (AKA-12)]] was a [[United States]] navy ship named after the constellation.
* [[Tropical Storm Tembin]] - Four tropical cyclones in the western Pacific have been given its Japanese name.

This is a '''list of folk music traditions''', with styles, dances, instruments and other related topics.  The term ''[[folk music]]'' can not be easily defined in a precise manner; it is used with widely varying definitions depending on the author, intended audience and context within a work.  Similarly, the term ''traditions'' in this context does not connote any strictly-defined criteria.  Music scholars, journalists, audiences, record industry individuals, politicians, nationalists and demagogues may often have occasion to address which fields of folk music areto a distinct group of people and with characteristics undiluted by contact with the music of other peoples; thus, the folk music traditions described herein overlap in varying degrees with each other.

'''Masalai''' are a type of [[spirit]] in [[Papua New Guinea]]. [[Margaret Mead]] defined them as: "supernatural beings that inhabit
specific  places,  usually  distinguished by some special natural feature (a water hole, waterfall, bend in a river, cliff, marsh, etc.), and that  exercise limited jurisdiction over their own  area; they  may manifest themselves as snakes, crocodiles and other creatures, often  with  bizarre features, such as strange coloring, two  heads, etc. Masalai may be associated with descent lines, moieties, hamlets, villages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Sepik as a Culture Area: Comment | journal = Anthropological Quarterly | year = 1978 | first = Margaret | last = Mead | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–75| id = | jstor = 3317126 | doi=10.2307/3317126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Masalai may employ trickery to seduce people, causing genital bleeding and death. White people were sometimes mistaken for masalai  because their clothes resembled snake skin being shed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Sexuality and Cargo Cults: The Politics of Gender and Procreation in West New Britain | journal = Cultural Anthropology | year = 1991 | first = Andrew | last = Lattas | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 230–256| id = | jstor = 656416| doi=10.1525/can.1991.6.2.02a00070}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous folk tales about the masalai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Slone | first1 = Thomas H. | title = One thousand one Papua New Guinean nights: folktales from Wantok newspaper, Volume 1 | publisher = Masalai Press | year = 2001 | location = Oakland, Calif. | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fnU8bVdiGtEC&amp;pg=PA253&amp;dq=masalai&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=C7KNTpDPCsHy0gGny_Ey&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=masalai&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-10-06 | isbn = 978-0-9714127-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
For as long as there have been words and pictures, the people of the world have been consuming media. Improved [[technology]] such as the [[printing press]] has fed increased consumption. Around 1600 the [[camera obscura]] was perfected. Light was inverted through a small hole or lens from outside, and projected onto a surface or screen, creating a moving image. This new medium had a very small effect on society compared to the old ones. The [[History of photography|development of photography]] in the middle 19th century made those images permanent, greatly reducing the cost of pictures. By the end of the century millions of consumers were seeing new, professionally-made photographs every day.

In the 1860s mechanisms such as the [[zoetrope]], [[mutoscope]] and [[praxinoscope]] that produced two-dimensional drawings in motion were created. They were displayed in public halls for people to observe.&lt;ref name="Wright &amp; Pritchard"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wright |first1=A. |last2=Pritchard |first2=M. E. |title=An examination of the relation of gender, mass media influence, and loneliness to disordered eating among college students |journal=Eating and Weight Disorders – Studies on Anorexia, Bulimia and Obesity |year=2009 |volume=14 |issue=2–3 |pages=e144–e147 |doi=10.1007/BF03327813}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[new media]] foreshadowed the [[mass media]] consumption of later years.

Around the 1880s, the development of the [[motion picture camera]] allowed individual component images to be captured and stored on a single reel. Motion pictures were projected onto a screen to be viewed by an audience. This moving camera affected the progression of the world immensely, beginning the [[American film industry]] as well as early international movements such as [[German Expressionism]], [[Surrealism]] and the [[Soviet Montage]]. For the first time people could tell stories on film, and distribute their works to consumers worldwide.

In the 1920s electronic [[History of television|television was working]] in laboratories,&lt;ref name="Berg, Patricia 2007" /&gt; and in the 1930s hundreds of receivers were in use worldwide. By 1941 the [[Columbia Broadcasting System]] (CBS) was broadcasting two 15-minute newscasts a day to a tiny audience on its New York television station. However, the television industry did not begin to boom until the general [[post–World War II economic expansion]].&lt;ref name="Hobza et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hobza |first1=C.

Computers were developed in the middle 20th century, and commercialized in the 1960s. Apple and other companies sold computers for hobbyists in the 1970s, and in 1981 [[IBM]] released computers intended for consumers.

On August 6, 1991 the [[internet]] and [[World Wide Web]], long in use by computer specialists, became available to the public. This was the start of the commercialized Internet that people use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Andreassen |first=C. S. |title=Online Social Network Site Addiction: A Comprehensive Review |journal=Current Addiction Reports |year=2015 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=175–184 |doi=10.1007/s40429-015-0056-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, [[Friends Reunited]], the first [[social media]] site, was released to the public. Since then, [[Myspace]], [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]] and other social networks have been created. Facebook and Twitter are the top social media sites in terms of usage.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Amanda L. |last1=Forest |first2=Joanne V. |last2=Wood |title=When Social Networking Is Not Working: Individuals With Low Self-Esteem Recognize but Do Not Reap the Benefits of Self-Disclosure on Facebook |journal=Psychological Science |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=295–302 |doi=10.1177/0956797611429709}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Facebook has a total of 1,230,000,000 consumers while Twitter has 645,750,000. Both companies are worth billions of dollars, and continue to grow.&lt;ref name="L. Burrow, Anthony 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burrow |first1=Anthony L. |last2=Rainone |first2=Nicolette |year=2017 |title=How many ''likes'' did I get?: Purpose moderates links between positive social media feedback and self-esteem |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |volume=69 |pages=232–236 |doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2016.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall media consumption has immensely increased over time, from the era of the introduction of motion pictures, to the age of social networks and the internet.

==People involved==

Media is the sum of information and entertainment media taken in by an individual or group. The first source of media was solely word of mouth. When written language was established, scrolls were passed, but mass communication was never an option. It wasn't until the printing press that media could be consumed on a high level. Johannes Gutenberg, a goldsmith and businessman from the mining town of Mainz in southern Germany printing press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bellis|first=Mary|title=Johannes Gutenberg and the Printing Press|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/gstartinventors/a/Gutenberg.htm|publisher=Inventors.About}}&lt;/ref&gt; His technology allowed books, newspapers, and flyers to be printed and distributed on a mass level.

The first newspaper written on paper was done by Benjamin Harris in the British-American Colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ringer|first=Wesley|title=History of the Bible: How The Bible Came To Us|url=http://www.godandscience.org/apologetics/bibleorigin.html|publisher=godandscience|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of a newspaper was one of the most influential pieces in media consumption history, because it pertained to everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benjamin Harris|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/255892/Benjamin-Harris|publisher=Britannica|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually communication reached an electronic state, and the telegraph was invented. Harrison Dyar, who sent electrical sparks through chemically treated paper tape to burn dots and dashes, invented the first telegraph in the USA.&lt;ref name="Bellis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bellis|first=Mary|title=The History of the Electric Telegraph and Telegraphy|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/tstartinventions/a/telegraph.htm|publisher=inventors.about}}&lt;/ref&gt; The telegraph was the first piece of equipment that allowed users to send electronic messages. A more developed version came from Samuel Morse, whose telegraph printed code on tape and was operated using a keypad and an earpiece.&lt;ref name="Bellis"/&gt; The pattern of communication soon became known as Morse code.

Inventors Elisha Gray and Alexander Graham Bell both independently designed the telephone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bellis|first=Mary|title=The History of the Telephone – Alexander Graham Bell|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/bstartinventors/a/telephone.htm|publisher=inventors.about|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The telephone was simple enough for everyone to use and didn't require learning a code.

Soon after the telephone came the radio. Combining technology from both the telegraph and telephone, Guglielmo Marconi sent and received his first radio signal in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bellis|first=Mary|title=The Invention of Radio|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/rstartinventions/a/radio.htm|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally in 1947, after a long period of development, television exploded as a medium. Not one person is responsible for the creation of the television, but Marvin Middlemark invented "rabbit ears" in 1930, which allowed for televisions to be a commercial product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bellis|first=Mary|title=Television history|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/tstartinventions/a/Television.htm|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The television has by far been the most influential consumed media, and allowed news to spread on a visual level.

In 1976, Apple created the first consumer computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Computers|url=http://inventors.about.com/library/blcoindex.htm|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The computer was the start of mass written communication using email. Apple continues to be a leading company in computer use.

In 1998, the first ever social media site [[SixDegrees.com]] was created by [[Andrew Weinreich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uncp.edu/home/acurtis/NewMedia/SocialMedia/SocialMediaHistory.html|title=The Brief History of Social Media|date=2012-03-16|access-date=2017-10-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316122748/http://www.uncp.edu/home/acurtis/NewMedia/SocialMedia/SocialMediaHistory.html|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It enabled users to upload a profile and make friends with other users. Shortly later in 1999, [[Friends Reunited]] was created by Steve and Julie Pankhurst and friend Jason Porter&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/advice/12114738/Steve-Pankhurst-Friends-Reunited-millionaire-Geeky-techies-are-the-new-celebrities.html|title=Steve Pankhurst, Friends Reunited millionaire: 'Geeky techies are the new celebrities'|last=Stanford|first=Peter|date=2016|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sites like MySpace created by [[Tom Anderson]] gained prominence in the early 2000s. By 2006, Facebook created by [[Mark Zuckerberg]] and Twitter created by [[Jack Dorsey]] both became available to users throughout the world. These sites remain some of the most popular social networks on the Internet.

==Increase==

Among other factors, a person's access to media technology affects the amount and quality of his or her intake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Aeron|title=Political Communication and Social Theory|year=2010|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, for instance, "U.C. San Diego scientists in 2009 estimated the 'average' American consumes 34 [[gigabyte]]s of media a day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phelps|first=Andrew|title=Ethan Zuckerman wants you to eat your (news) vegetables – or at least have better information|journal=Nieman Journalism Lab|date=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of media consumption among individuals is increasing as new technologies are created. According to phys.org, a new study done by a researcher at the San Diego Supercomputer Center at the University of California, says that by 2015, the sum of media asked for and delivered to consumers on mobile devices and their homes would take more than 15 hours a day to see or hear,&lt;ref name="Zverin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Zverin|first=Jan|title=U.S. Media Consumption to Rise to 15.5 Hours a Day – Per Person – by 2015|url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/u.s._media_consumption_to_rise_to_15.5_hours_a_day_per_person_by_2015|publisher=UC San Diego New Press|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an amount equivalent to watching nine DVDs' worth of data per person per day.&lt;ref name="Zverin"/&gt;

With [[social media]] networks rapidly growing such as [[Instagram]], [[Facebook]], and [[Twitter]], our world of media consumption is reaching a younger and younger age group, making our consumption that much larger as a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lunden|first=Ingrid|title=Instagram is the Fastest-Growing Social Site Globally, Mobile Devices Rule Over PCs For Access|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/21/instagram-is-the-fastest-growing-social-site-globally-mobile-devices-rule-over-pcs-for-social-access/|publisher=Tech Crunch|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Networking Fact Sheet|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/social-networking-fact-sheet/|publisher=Pew Research Internet Project|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Managing Media: We Need a Plan|url=http://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/pages/managing-media-we-need-a-plan.aspx|publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[mobile device]]s such as [[smartphone]]s, news, entertainment, shopping and buying are all now at the tip of our fingers, anytime, anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vanac|first=Mary|title=A Whole Grocery Store at Your Fingertips|date=January 4, 2013|publisher=The Columbus Dispatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positive effects==
There are a number of positive effects of media consumption. Television can have positive effects on children as they are growing up. Shows like ''Sesame Street'' teach valuable lessons to children in developmental stages, such as math, the alphabet, kindness, racial equality, and cooperation.&lt;ref name="US National Library of Medicine"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Center for Biotechnology Information|pmc=2792691|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dora the Explorer'' introduces foreign language to children of all backgrounds in a fun, cooperative environment.&lt;ref name="US National Library of Medicine"/&gt;

[[Mass media]] has a huge grasp on today's adolescents.  Many young people use different types of social media daily.  Mass media can be used to socialize adolescents from around the world and can help to give them a fundamental understanding of [[social norm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christopher E|first=Beaudoin|year=2014|title=The Mass Media and Adolescent Socialization: A Prospective Study in the Context of Unhealthy Food Advertising|url=|journal=Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly; Columbia|volume=91|pages=544–561|via=ABI/INFORM Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media relating to advertising can also have a positive effect. Some alcohol manufacturers are known to spend at least ten percent of their budget on warnings about the dangers of drinking and driving.&lt;ref name="US National Library of Medicine"/&gt; Also, studies show that milk consumption (though controversial) shot up in children fifteen years of age and younger due to print and broadcast advertisements.&lt;ref name="US National Library of Medicine"/&gt;

Many [[video game]]s can also have positive effects. Games like [[Wii]] Tennis and Wii Fit improve hand-eye coordination as well as general mental and physical health.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2013/11/video-games.aspx|title=Video Games Play May Provide Learning, Health, Social Benefits|website=www.apa.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Video games, including shooting games, with an abundance of violence, improves a child's learning, physical as well as mental health and social skills. These games that are rated for mature adults are beneficial to the development of children according to a study that was published by the American Psychological Association ([[American Psychological Association|APA]]). The study showed that there is a need to look at the positive effects as well as the negative ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Granic|first=Isabela|last2=Lobel|first2=Adam|last3=Engels|first3=Rutger C. M. E.|date=January 2014|title=The benefits of playing video games|journal=The American Psychologist|volume=69|issue=1|pages=66–78|doi=10.1037/a0034857|issn=1935-990X|pmid=24295515}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a child plays a video game, they naturally develop problem-solving skills. Strategic video games, such as role-playing games, release statistics that the more intense game play improved in problem solving skills and there is a significant rise in school grades as well, according to a study that was taken over a several year span but was published in 2013.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The study also showcased that the creativity of children was also enhanced by playing all genres of video games, including once again violent games. Research revealed that video games benefit children more than using other sources of technology.

The internet itself is a huge positive for people of all ages, as it now is a personal library for anyone who has access.&lt;ref name="US National Library of Medicine"/&gt; The number of educational websites and services offered are so immense that research has become a task much easier than it was in the past. Social media has also provided many benefits for people over time, as it has been evaluated as a pro-social way of interacting with people all over the world.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbooks Online"&gt;{{cite web|title=Children's Media Use: A Positive Psychology Approach – Oxford Handbooks|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195398809.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780195398809-e-10|accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For those in education, on both sides of the fence media consumption is crucial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://youthrelationships.org/free-lesson-plans|title=Critical Media Literacy: Free Lesson Plans|last=|first=|date=|website=Western Centre for School and Mental Health|access-date=April 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instructors as well as students across all grade levels consume media for school curricula in Ontario.  Media literacy is prominent to the youth who enter an era where the media is a surrounding factor.  When a student learns to approach certain media sources with a critical lens, its understood that all forms of media have no sense of neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Converging Media: A New Introduction to Mass Communication, 5th edition|last=Pavlik, McIntosh|first=John, Shawn|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students who consume media are capable of questioning the media they are consuming, that relatively improves knowledge. To broaden their understanding and knowledge, they often find it easier to question an author's purpose, the reasoning for certain images being used, the representation of content and its meaning to certain individuals, and overall the effects of the media being consumed and a personal as well as social level. Media relating to learning is a source as well as a tool. Since its start many use [[Rosetta Stone (software)]] to help guide them into learning a new language. It is a source that is compatible because it is portable and can be used in several platforms i.e. (iPad, Tablet, Phone Apps Websites).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ecv.missouri.edu/Word%20and%20PDF/Issue%206/6-2.pdf|title=Rosetta Stone and Language Proficiency of International Secondary School|last=Griffin|first=Robert|last2=Martinez|first2=James|date=2014|website=|publisher=ECV: Engaging Cultures and Voices|access-date=March 24, 2017|last3=Martin|first3=Ellice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negative effects==
Media consumption can have a wide range of negative behavioral and emotional effects.&lt;ref name="Bryant, Thompson 2013 155"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryant, Thompson|first=Jennings, Susan|title=Fundamentals of Media Effects|year=2013|publisher=Waveland Press Inc.|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many instances of [[violence in movies]], television, video games and websites which can affect one's level of aggression. These violent depictions can desensitize viewers to acts of violence and can also provoke mimicking of the acts. Since violence is so rampant in media, viewers believe they live in a more violent world than they actually do.&lt;ref name="Bryant, Thompson 2013 155"/&gt;

The reach of media is expanding globally and with this television has become a vice around the world. Television addiction has been labeled as the plug in drug since 1977. Over the years televisions are now located in almost every home, according to most recent estimates taken by Nielsen in the U.S. alone there are 116.4&amp;nbsp;million T.V. homes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2015/nielsen-estimates-116-4-million-tv-homes-in-the-us-for-the-2015-16-tv-season.html|title=NIELSEN ESTIMATES 116.4 MILLION TV HOMES IN THE U.S. FOR THE 2015–16 TV SEASON|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television can have a negative impact on adolescents and cause them to behave in a manner that is not part of normal social norm. In an article about media violence on society it states that extensive TV viewing among adolescents and young adults is associated with subsequent aggressive acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/295/5564/2377.full|title=The Effects of Media Violence on Society|first1=Craig A.|last1=Anderson|first2=Brad J.|last2=Bushman|date=29 March 2002|journal=Science|volume=295|issue=5564|pages=2377–2379|doi=10.1126/science.1070765}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs that portray violent acts can change an adolescent's view on violence and this may lead them to develop aggressive behavior.  These shows usually portray a person who commits a crime or resorts to violence.  They also show that these people go unpunished for their crime, creating the notion that crime is something a person can get away with.  Studies show that 65% of people between the age of 8 to 18 have a television in their room.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/107/2/423|title=Children, Adolescents, and Television|author=American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Public Education|journal=Pediatrics|year=2001|volume=107|issue=2|doi=10.1542/peds.107.2.423|pmid=11158483}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average high-schooler watches, on average,14 hours of television a week.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=May–June 2003|title=Impact of media use on children and youth|journal=Paediatr Child Health|volume=8|pages=301–306|via=|pmc=2792691|pmid=20020034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excessive television viewing and computer game playing has also been associated with many psychiatric symptoms, especially emotional and behavioral symptoms, somatic complaints, attention problems such as hyperactivity, and family interaction problems.&lt;ref name="pediatrics.aappublications.org"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/120/5/978 |first1=Markus |last1=Dworak |first2=Thomas |last2=Schierl |first3=Thomas |last3=Bruns |first4=Heiko Klaus |last4=Strüder |title=Impact of Singular Excessive Computer Game and Television Exposure on Sleep Patterns and Memory Performance of School-aged Children |journal=Pediatrics |year=2007 |volume=120 |issue=5 |doi=10.1542/peds.2007-0476 |pmid=17974734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When adolescents watch television for long periods of time they spend less time being active and engaged in physical activity. Many adolescents who spend large amounts of time watching television see actors as role models and try to emulate them by trying to be like them this can also have a negative impact on people's [[body image]]s, mostly women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After seeing beautiful and thinner than average women in the media, viewers may feel worse about themselves and sometimes develop eating disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yamamiya|first=Yuko|first2=Thomas F. |last2=Cash |first3=Susan E. |last3=Melnyk |first4=Heidi D. |last4=Posavac |first5=Steven S. |last5=Posavac |title=Women's exposure to thin-and-beautiful media images: body image effects of media-ideal internalization and impact-reduction interventions|year=2005|journal=Body Image|volume=2|issue=1|pages=74–80|doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2004.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe that the reason obesity rates have greatly increased in the last 20 years is due to increased media consumption. This is due to the fact that children are spending much more time playing video games and watching television than exercising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boero|first=Natalie|title=All the News that's Fat to Print: The American 'Obesity Epidemic' and the Media|journal=Qualitative Sociology|year=2007|volume=30|issue=1|pages=41–60|doi=10.1007/s11133-006-9010-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Social media is said to also cause anxiety and depression. Research suggests that young people who spend more than 2 hours per day on social media are more likely to report poor mental health, including psychological distress.

Numerous studies have also shown that media consumption has a significant association with poor sleep quality. Television and computer game exposure affect children's sleep and deteriorate verbal cognitive performance.&lt;ref name="pediatrics.aappublications.org"/&gt;

Another problem that has developed due to increased media consumption is that people are becoming less independent. With [[text messaging]] and social media, people want [[instant gratification]] from their friends and often feel hurt if they do not receive an immediate response. Instead of having [[self-validation]], people often need validation from others.&lt;ref name="Turkle 2011 Chapter 9"&gt;{{cite book|last=Turkle|first=Sherry|title=Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other|year=2011|publisher=Basic Books|at=Chapter 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue with independence is that since children frequently get cellphones when they are very young, they are always connected and never truly alone. Today, many children do not have the [[rite of passage]] of being on their own because they can always call their parents if they need help or are frightened.&lt;ref name="Turkle 2011 Chapter 9"/&gt;

Minorities are often put in a negative light in the media as well, with blacks being portrayed as criminals, Hispanics portrayed as illegal aliens, and people from the Middle East portrayed as terrorists. Research has shown that consuming much media with headlines that depict minorities in negative ways can affect how people think.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Callanan|first=Valerie|year=2012|title=Media Consumption, Perceptions of Crime Risk and Fear of Crime: Examining Race/Ethnic Differences|url=http://proxygsu-alta.galileo.usg.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/952541470?accountid=14055|journal=Media Consumption, Perceptions of Crime Risk and Fear of Crime: Examining Race/Ethnic Differences|volume=55|pages=93–115|doi=10.1525/sop.2012.55.1.93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref  name="Berg, Patricia 2007" /&gt;

==Effects on Self-Esteem ==
Media has played a huge role in society for years in selling people on the expectations of how an ideal male and female body should look. These images of the "ideal body" can have a very negative effect on self-esteem in both men and women.&lt;ref name="Paxton, S. J. 2006"/&gt; These images can play significant roll in eating disorders in men and women as well.&lt;ref name="Wright &amp; Pritchard" /&gt; The idea of body comparison goes back to Festinger's (1954) Social Comparison Theory. Festinger argues that individuals make body comparisons in areas for which they relate. If someone who is over weight and is an environment that focuses on health, thinness, or body images (e.g. the gym or the beach) they may be more likely to see thinness as an ideal that can increase dissatisfaction with their own body.The more a person engages in body comparison, the more likely they may struggle with low self-esteem and a negative body image.&lt;ref name="Berg, Patricia 2007"/&gt; Women are sold to believe that to be beautiful, they must be a size zero and have long legs.  Men are sold the notion that they must big biceps and zero body fat. Reading magazines with images of toned muscular men has been reported to lower body and self-esteem in men and they start worrying more about their own health and physical fitness.&lt;ref name="Hobza et al." /&gt;

== Social Media ==
The amount of time spent on social media can inform people about their self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Andreassen, C.S. Curr Addict Rep (2015) 2: 175. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1007/s40429-015-0056-9&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has shown that individuals with lower self-esteem may have an easier time expressing themselves on social media rather than in the real world.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Many people use metrics such as how many people are following them and likes to measure acceptance or rejection from peers. One study from the ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology'', argues that individuals who feel accepted and part of the "in crowd" have a higher sense of self-esteem than those who do not feel as though they are a part of these crowds.&lt;ref name="L. Burrow, Anthony 2016"/&gt;

==Semiotics of American youth media consumption==
American youth have personal [[television set]]s, [[laptop]]s, [[iPod]]s and [[cell phone]]s all at their disposal. They spend more time with media than any single activity other than sleeping.  As of 2008, the average American age 8 to 18 reported more than 6 hours of daily media use. The growing phenomenon of "[[media multitasking]]"—using several forms of media at the same time—multiplies that figure to 8.5 hours of media exposure daily. Media exposure begins early, increases until children begin school, then climbs to peak at almost 8 hours daily among 11 and 12-year-old children. Media exposure is positively related to risk-taking behaviors and is negatively related to personal adjustment and school performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roberts|first=D|first2=Ulla|last2=Foehr|title=Trends in Media Use|journal=The Future of Children|year=2008|volume=18|issue=1|pages=11–37|doi=10.1353/foc.0.0000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of [[teenager]]s ages 12 to 17, 78% have a cell phone, and 47% of those own [[smartphone]]s. 23% of teens have a [[tablet computer]] and 93% have a computer or access to one at home. Of teenagers ages 14 to 17, 74% access the Internet on [[mobile device]]s occasionally. One in four teens are cell-mostly users, meaning that when accessing the Internet, they mostly use their cell phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teens and Technology 2013|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media/Files/Reports/2013/PIP_TeensandTechnology2013.pdf|accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media consumption, especially [[social media]] consumption, plays a major role in the [[socialization]] and social habits of [[adolescent]]s. Socializing through media differs from socializing through school, community, family, and other social situations. Since the adolescents have a greater control over their media choices than over other social situations face-to-face, many develop self-socialization. This is where we actively influence our own social development and outcomes because of the vast array of choices. Adolescents can choose media that best fits their personalities and preferences, which in turn create youth that have a skewed view of the world and limited [[social interaction]] skills. Socialization can be awkward for youth, especially with the integration of media. Media, parents, and peers may all convey differing messages to adolescents. With multiple views of how to approach a situation, confusion can be apparent and the youth may often give up or internalize their social situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arnett|first=J|title=Adolescents' uses of media for self-socialization|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|year=1995|volume=24|issue=5|pages=519–533|doi=10.1007/bf01537054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social semiotics]] make up a large part of how adolescents learn and employ social interaction. Impressionable adolescents regularly imitate the sign systems they see in the media. These [[semiotic]] systems affect their behavior through [[connotations]], [[narratives]], and [[myths]]. Adolescents are shaped by the sign systems in the media they consume. For example, many young girls in the 1990s dressed and acted like the [[Spice Girls]], a popular band. Similarly, [[boy bands]] created a trend of many teenage boys frosting their hair in the early 2000s. With more exposure to the media and images of models, young women are more likely to conform to the ideal of being thin. [[Anorexia nervosa|Anorexia]], [[bulimia]] and models smoking convey to girls that a feminine person is thin, beautiful, and must do certain things to her body to be attractive. A code of femininity (see [[media and gender]]) implies today that a "true" woman is thin, girlish, frail, passive, and focused on serving others.  On the other hand, the code of masculinity for a young boy growing up in our culture may include the ideals of cowboys and secret agents. The images, myths, and narratives of these ideas imply that a "true" man is a problem solver, physically strong, emotionally inexpressive, and a daredevil who doesn't care about rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dotson|first=M. J.|first2=E. M.|last2=Hyatt|title=Major influence factors in children's consumer socialization|journal=Journal of Consumer Marketing|volume=22|issue=1|pages=35–42|doi=10.1108/07363760510576536|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flood of signs, images, narratives, and myths surrounding us influence our behavior by the use of codes. [[Codes]] are maps of meaning, systems of signs that people use to interpret their own and others' behavior. Codes connect semiotic systems of meaning with social structure and values. The idea of being judged on femininity or clothing relates to experiences later in life with job interviews and being successful.&lt;ref name="Semiotics and Advertising"&gt;{{cite web|title=Semiotics and Advertising|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~tstreete/semiotics_and_ads/index.html|accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Signs, myths, and codes do not affect us physically like a drug, but psychologically. We think with signs, though we don't eat, breathe, or physically interact with them. The power that sign systems have is their role in generating and maintaining shared expectations and shared interpretive frameworks. [[Sign]]s do not force us to have certain interpretations. They open a door, creating the context for other people's interpretations of us, and even more importantly, our own expectations of what others think. Sign systems are merely tools, but they have become the common currency for communicating. Signs have become something we can accept or criticize, but not ignore.&lt;ref name="Semiotics and Advertising"/&gt;

Media consumption has become part of our culture code and has shaped the youth through socialization and how they interpret the signs and world around them. For example, older generations see the symbol for a phone and think that it is something to call someone with. The younger generations, especially the youth now, see a phone as a mini-computer and a way to avoid physical contact or face-to-face communication.

== Effect on Public Attitudes Regarding Crime and Justice==
[[File:Law and Order SVU.png|thumb|Law &amp; Order: SVU
Television viewers of crime based shows are more fearful of crime.
]]
Media consumption affects the public's perception of the justice system through the relationship of fear regarding crime, the perceived effectiveness of law enforcement, and the general attitudes about punishment for crime.  The law and the legal system have continually been portrayed in mass media through negative portrayals of criminals, deviants, and law enforcement officials, which in turn affects the overall perception of these by the public.

A research study done by Dowler in 2003, showed that the effects of media consumption does influence public attitudes regarding crime and justice.  In this study a relationship between media and crime was found to be dependent on characteristics of the message and receiving audience, where substantial amounts of local crimes reported raised fear, while lower crime amounts lead to a feeling of safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.albany.edu/scj/jcjpc/vol10is2/dowler.html|title=Media consumption and public attitudes toward crime and justice: The relationship between fear of crime, punitive attitudes, and perceived police effectiveness|last=Dowler|first=K.|year=2003|journal=Journal of Criminal Justice and Popular Culture |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=109–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Gerbner's empirical studies of the impact of media consumption discovered that television viewers of crime based shows are more fearful of crime than those who are not consuming that type of media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerbner|first=G.|last2=Gross|first2=L.|last3=Morgan|first3=M.|last4=Signorielli|first4=N.|date=1986|title=Living with television: The dynamics of the cultivation process|url=http://wiki.commres.org/pds/CultivationTheory/LivingWithTelevision_TheDynamicsoftheCultivationProcess.pdf|journal=Perspectives on media effects|volume=|pages=17–40|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted by Chermak, McGarrell, &amp; Gruenewald focused on media coverage of police misconduct which produced results where the more the citizens consumed the misconduct media the more they believed in the officer's guilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chermak|first=S.|last2=McGarrell|first2=E.|last3=Gruenewald|first3=J.|date=2006-04-01|title=Media coverage of police misconduct and attitudes toward police|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/10.1108/13639510610667664|journal=Policing: An International Journal|volume=29|issue=2|pages=261–281|doi=10.1108/13639510610667664|issn=1363-951X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings showed the more a citizen exposed themselves to media consumption regarding a specific case, the more likely they felt about the officer's guilt.  This same study also indicated that race effects were more pronounced after media coverage of the case.  The indication that news consumption had no significant effects on the general attitudes towards police, police services, or concerns about police harassment were also concluded.

'''Media transparency'''(or '''transparent media'''), sometimes also referred to as '''media opacity,'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Plaisance|first=Patrick Lee|date=2007-06-18|title=Transparency: An Assessment of the Kantian Roots of a Key Element in Media Ethics Practice|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08900520701315855|journal=Journal of Mass Media Ethics|language=en|volume=22|issue=2-3|pages=187–207|doi=10.1080/08900520701315855|issn=0890-0523}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a concept that ponders on how and why [[Information subsidy|information subsidies]] are being produced, distributed and handled by media professionals, including journalists, editors, public relations practitioners, public affairs specialists, and spokespeople. In short, media transparency reflects the relationship between journalists and news sources. 

==Overview==
Media transparency deals with the openness and accountability of the media and can be defined as a transparent exchange of information subsidies based on the ideas of newsworthiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global journalism: Survey of international communication.|last=Merrill|first=John|publisher=Longman|year=1995|isbn=0801305128|location=White Plains, NY|pages=77-87}}&lt;/ref&gt;Media transparency is one of the biggest challenges of contemporary everyday media practices around the world as media outlets and journalists constantly experience pressures from advertisers, information sources, publishers, and other influential groups&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://instituteforpr.org/bribery-news-coverage-2003/|title=International Index of Bribery for News Coverage 2003 {{!}} Institute for Public Relations|date=2011-01-10|work=Institute for Public Relations|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

News sources may influence what information is published or not published. Sometimes, published information can also be paid for by news sources, but the end media product (an article, a program, a blog post) does not clearly indicate that the message has been paid or influenced in any way. Such media opacity, or media non-transparency, ruins the trust and transparency between the media and the public and have implications for transparency of new forms of advertising and public relations (such as native advertising and brand journalism).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transparency, Public Relations and the Mass Media:

Media transparency is a normative concept and is achieved when: 1) there are many competing sources of information; 2) the method of information delivery is known; and 3) funding of media production is disclosed and publicly available&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

== Media Bribery ==
The concept has emerged in response to claims of bias in media, and the lack of media transparency can be perceived as a form of corruption&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ewasserman.com/2006/05/10/transparency-and-quality-journalism/|title=Transparency and Quality Journalism|date=2006-05-10|work=UNSOCIAL MEDIA|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Media transparency is a means to diminish unethical and illegal practices in the relationships between news sources and the media&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipra.org/news/charter-for-media-transparency/|title=IPRA {{!}} Charter for Media Transparency|website=www.ipra.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Indirect payments and influences were defined as “any type of non-monetary reward to a journalist, editor, or media outlet or the existence of a media policy which dictates, encourages indirect payments or influences the financial success and independence of the media outlet or its employees”

==Power==
Academics at the [[University of Oxford]] and [[Warwick Business School]], conducting empirical research on the operation and effects of transparent forms of clinical regulation in practice, describe a form of 'spectacular transparency'. They suggest that government policy tends to react to high-profile media 'spectacles', leading to regulatory policy decisions that appear to respond to problems exposed in the media have new perverse effects in practice, which are unseen by regulators or the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGivern|first=Gerry|author2=Fischer, Michael D|title=Medical regulation, spectacular transparency and the blame business|journal=Journal of Health, Organization and Management|year=2010|volume=24|issue=6|pages=597–610|pmid=21155435|doi=10.1108/14777261011088683}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGivern|first=Gerry|author2=Fischer, Michael D.|title=Reactivity and reactions to regulatory transparency in medicine, psychotherapy and counselling|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|date=1 February 2012|volume=74|issue=3|pages=289–296|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.09.035|pmid=22104085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree to which state agents work to influence [[video production]] contradicts the use of those images by news organizations as indexical, objective representations. Because people tend to strongly equate seeing with knowing, video cultivates an inaccurate impression that they are getting the "full picture". It has been said that "what is on the news depends on what can be shown". The case studies for this project demonstrate that what can be shown is often decided in concern with political agents. Essentially, the way the media presents its information creates an illusion of transparency.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Angela Block, [http://hij.sagepub.com/content/14/2/257.full.pdf+html "Who's Minding the Gate? : Pool Feeds, Video Subsidies, and Political Images"], "The International Journal of Press and Politics", April 2009.

In communication studies or media studies, '''mediatization''' is a theory that argues that the media shapes and frames the processes and discourse (conversation) of [[political communication]] as well as the society in which that communication takes place.&lt;ref&gt;Lilleker, D., 2008, Key Concepts in Political Communications. SAGE London.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this framework, an important aspect of [[modernization]] is the development of media,&lt;ref&gt;Krotz, F. (2008). Media Connectivity: Concepts, Conditions, and Consequences. In A. Hepp, F. Krotz &amp; S. Moores (Eds.), Network, Connectivity and Flow: Key concepts for Media and Cultural Studies. New York: Hampton Press.&lt;/ref&gt; beginning with a change in [[communication]] media and proceeding to subordination of the power of prevailing influential institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Hjarvard, S. (2008). The Mediatization of Religion: A Theory of the Media as Agents of Religious Change. In Northern Lights 2008. Yearbook of Film &amp; Media Studies. Bristol: Intellect Press: 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a consequence of this process, institutions and whole societies are shaped by and dependent on [[mass media]].&lt;ref&gt;Mazzoleni, G., &amp; Schulz, W. (1999). "Mediatization" of Politics: A Challenge for Democracy? Political Communication, 16(3), 247-261.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
Mediatization is part of a paradigmatic shift in media and communication research. Following the concept of '[[Mediation (Marxist theory and media studies)|mediation]]', 'mediatization' has become the proper concept for capturing how processes of communication transform society, designating large-scale relationships. The two are complementary.&lt;ref&gt;Hepp, A. Hajarvard, S., Lundby, (2015). Mediatization: theorizing the interplay between media, culture and society Media, Culture &amp; Society 37(2) 314–324.&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted by Von Joachim Preusse and Sarah Zielmann, Kent Asp introduced and lamented on the concept of mediatization, and they clarifiy that: "Mediatisation was first applied to media's impact on political communication and other effects on politics. The Swedish media researcher Kent Asp was the first to speak of the mediatisation of political life, by which he meant a process whereby 'a political system to a high degree is influenced by and adjusted to the demands of the mass media in their coverage of politics'" (2010: 336).

Asp used the term mediated politics to describe how the media have become a necessary source of information between politicians and those in authority and those they governed.  According to Asp's understanding politics are mediated when the mass media are the main or the only source of political information through which it may influence or even shape people's conceptions of political reality. Asp's theoretical assumptions that mass media may influence and mobilize current political ideas through mediatized rituals have been adopted by various communication scholars. In the tradition of Asp, the Danish media scholar [[Stig Hjarvard]] helped to develop the concept of mediatization and suggested that mediatization is a social process whereby the society is saturated and inundated by the media to the extent that the media cannot longer be thought of separated from other institutions within the society.&lt;ref&gt;Hjarvard, S. (2008). The Mediatization of Religion: A Theory of the Media as Agents of Religious Change. In Northern Lights 2008. Yearbook of Film &amp; Media Studies. Bristol: Intellect Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sociocultural change ==   
The concept has evolved to focus not only on media effects but on the interrelation between the change of media communication on the one hand and sociocultural changes on the other, as part of our everyday communication practices and our communicative construction of reality.&lt;ref&gt;Hepp, A. Hajarvard, S., Lundby, (2015). Mediatization: theorizing the interplay between media, culture and society, Media, Culture &amp; Society 37(2) 314–324.&lt;/ref&gt; Mediatization research investigates the interrelation between media communicative change and sociocultural change, understood as a meta-process (a conceptual construct designating long-term processes of change).&lt;ref&gt;Couldry, N. &amp; A. Hepp. (2013). Conceptualizing Mediatization: Contexts,Traditions, Arguments. Communication Theory 23: 191-202.&lt;/ref&gt; Media do not necessarily 'cause' the transformations but they have become co-constitutive for the articulation of politics, economics, education, religion, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Hepp, A. Hajarvard, S., Lundby, (2015). Mediatization: theorizing the interplay between media, culture and society, Media, Culture &amp; Society 37(2) 314–324.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, television, by showcasing know-how health specialists who promote quick individual changes in lifestyle, co-constructs the notion of health together with other institutions and broader cultural shifts in perceptions of the body.

Hjarvard and Peterson summarize media's role in cultural change: "(1) When various forms of subcultures try to make use of media for their own purposes, they often become (re-)embedded into mainstream culture; (2) National cultural policies often serve as levers for increased mediatization; (3) Mediatization involves a transformation of the ways in which authority and expertise are performed and reputation is acquired and defended; and (4) Technological developments shape the media's affordances and thus the particular path of mediatization."&lt;ref&gt;Hjarvard, S. &amp; L.N. Peterson, (2013). [https://ojs.statsbiblioteket.dk/index.php/mediekultur/article/download/8123/6762 Mediatization and cultural change], MedieKultur, 54: 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research mobilizing mediatization theories explores the ways in which media are embedded in cultural transformation. For example, "tactical" mediatization designates the response of community organizations and activists to wider technological changes. Kim Sawchuk, professor in Communication Studies at Concordia University, worked with a group of elderly who managed to retain their own agency in this context.&lt;ref&gt;Sawchuk, K. (2013). [http://ojs.statsbiblioteket.dk/index.php/mediekultur/article/view/7313/6765 Tactical mediatization and activist ageing: pressures, push-backs, and the story of RECAA]. MedieKultur 54: 47-64.&lt;/ref&gt; For the elderly, the pressure to mediatize comes from various institutions that are transitioning to online services (government agencies, funding, banks, etc.), among other things. A tactical approach to media is one that comes from those who are subordinates within these systems. It means to implement work-arounds to make the technologies work for them. For example, in the case of the elderly group she studies, they borrowed equipment to produce video capsules explaining their mandate and the importance of this mandate for their communities, which allowed them to reach new audiences while keeping the tone and style of face-to-face communication they privilege in their day-to-day practice. Doing this, they also subverted expectations about the ability of the elderly to use new media effectively.
Another example of study is one which is focused on the media-related practices of graffiti writers and skaters, showing how media integrate and modulate their everyday practices. The analysis also demonstrates how the mediatization of these subcultural groups brings them to become part of mainstream culture, changes their rebellious and oppositional image and engages them with the global commercialization culture.&lt;ref&gt;Encheva, K., Driessens, O., &amp; Verstraeten, H. (2013). The mediatization of deviant subcultures: an analysis of the media - related practices of graffiti writers and skaters, MedieKultur, 54: 29.&lt;/ref&gt;
An example of study mobilizing mediatization theories would be one interested in how media's omnipresence informs the ways Femen's protests may take place on public scenes, allow communication between individual bodies and a shared understanding of activist imaginary. It aims to analyse how their practices are moulded by the media and how these are staged in manners which facilitates spreadability.&lt;ref&gt;Reestorff, C. M. (2014). Mediatised affective activism: The activist imaginary and the topless body in the Femen movement,  Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies, 20: 4, {{doi|10.1177/1354856514541358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Middle Eastern philosophy''' includes the various [[philosophy|philosophies]] of the [[Middle East]] regions, including the [[Fertile Crescent]], [[Iran]], and [[Anatolia]]. Traditions include [[Ancient Egyptian philosophy]], [[Akkadian literature|Babylonian philosophy]], [[Jewish philosophy]], [[Iranian philosophy|Iranian/Persian philosophy]], and [[Islamic philosophy]].

==Iranian philosophy==
{{Main|Iranian philosophy}}

===Zoroastrianism===
{{Main|Zoroastrianism}}
Zoroastrianism is a [[monotheistic]] religion, which originated in [[Iran]]. It has a dualistic nature ([[Ahura Mazda]] and [[Angra Mainyu]]), with an additional series of six important divine entities called the [[Amesha Spentas]].&lt;ref&gt;Mary Boyce: "The Origins of Zoroastrian Philosophy" in "Persian Philosophy". Companion Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy: Brian Carr and Indira Mahalingam. Routledge, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In modern Zoroastrianism they are interpreted as aspects or emanations of Ahura Mazda (the Supreme Being), who form a heptad that is good and constructive. They are opposed to another group of seven who are evil and destructive. It is this persistent conflict between good and evil that distinguishes Zoroastrianism from monotheistic frameworks that have only one power as supreme. By requiring its adherents to have faith and belief in ''equally opposing'' powers Zoroastrianism characterizes itself as dualistic.

The teachings of [[Zoroaster|Zarathustra]] (Zoroaster) appeared in [[Persia]] at some point during the period 1700-1800 BCE.&lt;ref name="Jalal-e-din Ashtiyani"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Zarathushtra, Mazdayasna and Governance|author=Jalal-e-din Ashtiyani}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitley"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Date and Teaching of Zarathustra|author=Whitley, C.F.|pages=219–223|journal=Numen|volume= 4|issue=3|date=Sep 1957|doi=10.2307/3269345}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wisdom became the basis of the religion [[Zoroastrianism]], and generally influenced the development of the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] branch of [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] philosophy. Zarathustra was the first who treated the problem of evil in philosophical terms.&lt;ref name="Whitley" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Williams: "Later Zoroastrianism" in "Persian Philosophy". Companion Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy: Brian Carr and Indira Mahalingam. Routledge, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also believed to be one of the oldest [[monotheism|monotheists]] in the history of religion. He espoused an ethical philosophy based on the primacy of ''good thoughts (pendar-e-nik), good words (goftar-e-nik), and good deeds (kerdar-e-nik).''&lt;ref&gt;Philip G. Kreyenbroek: "Morals and Society in Zoroastrian Philosophy" in "Persian Philosophy". Companion Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy: Brian Carr and Indira Mahalingam. Routledge, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The works of Zoroaster and Zoroastrianism had a significant influence on [[Greek philosophy]] and [[History of Western philosophy|Roman philosophy]]. Several [[ancient Greek]] writers such as  [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] and [[Latin]] writers such as [[Pliny the Elder]] praised Zoroastrian philosophy as "the most famous and most useful". [[Plato]] learnt of Zoroastrian philosophy through Eudoxus and incorporated much of it into his own [[Platonic realism]].&lt;ref&gt;A. D. Nock (1929), "''Studien zum antiken Synkretismus aus Iran und Griechenland'' by R. Reitzenstein, H. H. Schaeder, Fr. Saxl", ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' '''49''' (1), p. 111-116 [111].&lt;/ref&gt; In the 3rd century BC, however, [[Colotes]] accused Plato's ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' of plagiarizing parts of Zoroaster's [[On Nature (Zoroaster)|On Nature]], such as the [[Myth of Er]].&lt;ref&gt;David N. Livingstone (2002), ''The Dying God: The Hidden History of Western Civilization'', p. 144-145, iUniverse, {{ISBN|0-595-23199-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. D. Nock (1929), "''Studien zum antiken Synkretismus aus Iran und Griechenland'' by R. Reitzenstein, H. H. Schaeder, Fr. Saxl", ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' '''49''' (1), p. 111-116.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manichaeism===
[[Manichaeism]], founded by [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], was influential from [[North Africa]] in the West, to [[China]] in the East. Its influence subtly continues in Western Christian thought via Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]], who converted to Christianity from Manichaeism, which he passionately denounced in his writings, and whose writings continue to be influential among Catholic, Protestant and Orthodox [[theology|theologians]]. An important principle of Manichaeism was its [[dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] nature.

===Mazdakism===
The religious and philosophical teaching called [[Mazdak]]ism, which its founder, Mazdak, regarded as a reformed and purified version of [[Zoroastrianism]]&lt;ref name=ya56&gt;Yarshater, Ehsan. 1983. The Cambridge history of Iran, volume 2. p.995-997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cosmo&gt;[http://azargoshnasp.net/famous/babak_khorramdin/teachingsmazdakshaki.pdf Shaki, Mansour. 1985. The cosmogonical and cosmological teachings of Mazdak.] Papers in Honour of Professor Mary Boyce, Acta Iranica 25, Leiden, 1985, pp. 527-43.&lt;/ref&gt; displays remarkable influences from [[Manichaeism]] as well.&lt;ref name=ya56/&gt;

===Zurvanism===
[[Zurvanism]] is characterized by the element of its ''first principle'', which is time (''Zurvan''), as a primordial creator. According to Zaehner, Zurvanism appears to have three schools of thought, all with classical Zurvanism as a foundation: ''aesthetic'', ''materialist'', and ''fatalistic''.

====Aesthetic Zurvanism====
[[Zurvanism#Aesthetic Zurvanism|Aesthetic Zurvanism]]—apparently not as popular as the ''materialistic'' kind—viewed Zurvan as undifferentiated time, which, under the influence of desire, divided ''reason'' (a male principle) and ''concupiscence'' (a female principle).

====Materialist Zurvanism====
While Zoroaster's [[Ahura Mazda|Ormuzd]] created the universe with his thought, [[Zurvanism#Materialist Zurvanism|materialist Zurvanism]] challenged the concept that anything could be made out of nothing.

====Fatalistic Zurvanism====
[[Zurvanism#Fatalistic Zurvanism|Fatalistic Zurvanism]] resulted from the doctrine of limited time with the implication that nothing could change this preordained course of the material universe and that the path of the astral bodies of the 'heavenly sphere' was representative of this preordained course. According to the [[Middle Persian]] work [[Menog-i Khrad]]: "[[Ahura Mazda|Ohrmazd]] allotted happiness to man, but if man did not receive it, it was owing to the extortion of these planets."

===Avicennism===
The Persian polymath [[Avicenna]] wrote almost 450 treatises on a wide range of subjects. Many philosophical works, among them [[The Book of Healing]], have survived.

===Iranian Illuminationism===
The [[Illuminationism#Iranian school of Illuminationism|Philosophy of Illumination]] founded by [[Sohrevardi]] argued that light operates at all levels and hierarchies of reality. Light produces immaterial and substantial lights, including immaterial intellects, human and animal souls and even 'dusky substances', such as bodies. Sohrevardi's works display extensive developments on the basis of [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] ideas and ancient Iranian thought.

===Transcendent philosophy===
[[Transcendent Philosophy]], developed by [[Mulla Sadra|Sadr Shirazi]], is one of two main disciplines of [[Islamic philosophy]] that is currently live and active.

===Bahá'í philosophy===
[[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], son and successor of the founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], has explained the Bahá'í philosophy in the work ''[[Some Answered Questions]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kluge, Ian (2009). ''[http://bahai-library.com/kluge_saq_philosophical_perspective Some Answered Questions: A Philosophical Perspective]'', in Lights of Irfan, Volume 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israelite/Hebrew and diaspora Jewish philosophy==
{{Main|Jewish philosophy}}

Jewish philosophy includes all philosophy carried out by Jews, both within their [[Land of Israel|original homeland]] and in the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]].

==Babylonian philosophy==
:''Further information: [[Babylonian literature#Philosophy|Babylonian literature: Philosophy]]''
The origins of [[Babylonia]]n philosophy, in the popular sense of the word, can be traced back to the [[wisdom]] of early [[Mesopotamia]], which embodied certain philosophies of life, particularly [[ethics]], in the forms of [[dialectic]], [[dialog]]s, [[epic poetry]], [[folklore]], [[hymn]]s, [[lyrics]], [[prose]], and [[proverb]]s. The [[reasoning]] and [[rationality]] of the Babylonians developed beyond [[Empiricism|empirical]] observation.&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Buccellati (1981), "Wisdom and Not: The Case of Mesopotamia", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''101''' (1), p. 35-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that Babylonian philosophy had an influence on [[Greek philosophy]], and later [[Hellenistic philosophy]], however the textual evidence is lacking. The undated Babylonian text ''Dialog of Pessimism'' contains similarities to the [[agnost]]ic thought of the [[Sophism|sophists]], the [[Heraclitus|Heraclitean]] doctrine of contrasts, and the dialogs of [[Plato]], as well as a precursor to the [[Maieutics|maieutic]] [[Socratic method]] of [[Socrates]] and Plato.&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Buccellati (1981), "Wisdom and Not: The Case of Mesopotamia", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''101''' (1), p. 35-47 [43].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Milesians (Greek)|Milesian]] philosopher [[Thales]] is also said to have studied philosophy in Mesopotamia.

==Islamic philosophy==
{{Main|Islamic philosophy|Early Islamic philosophy|Modern Islamic philosophy}}
The rise of [[Islam]] and the influence of classical Greek thought, especially Aristotle, led to the emergence of various philosophical schools of thought. Amongst them [[Sufism]] established esoteric philosophy, [[Mu'tazili]] (partly influenced by [[Hellenistic philosophy]]) reconstructed [[rationalism]], while [[Ash'ari]] reshaped logical and rational interpretation of [[God]], [[justice]], [[destiny]] and the [[universe]].

Early Islamic philosophy was influenced by (ancient) [[Greek philosophy]], [[Hellenistic philosophy]], [[Iranian philosophy]], [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Indian philosophy]], and in turn, Islamic philosophy had a strong influence on (medieval) [[Jewish philosophy]], [[Christian philosophy]]/[[Western philosophy]], Iranian philosophy and Indian philosophy, hence many consider Islamic philosophy to be both an Eastern philosophy and a Western philosophy.

Al-Mu'tazilah (المعتزلة) or [[Mu'tazili]]te is a popular theological school of [[philosophy]] during early Islam. They called themselves '''Ahl al-'Adl wa al-Tawhid''' ("People of Justice and Monotheism"). They ascended dramatically during 8th and 9th century due to the support of intellectuals and elites. Later in the 13th century, they lost official support in favour of the rising [[Ash'ari]] school. Most of their valuable works were destroyed during the [[Crusades]] and [[Battle of Baghdad (1258)|Mongol invasion]].

One of the most influential Muslim philosophers in the West was [[Averroes]] (Ibn Rushd), founder of the [[Averroism]] school of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Majid Fakhry (2001). ''Averroes: His Life, Works and Influence''. Oneworld Publications. {{ISBN|1-85168-269-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is said that other influential Muslim philosophers include [[al-Jahiz]], a pioneer of [[evolution]]ary thought and [[natural selection]]; [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhacen), a pioneer of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and the [[philosophy of science]] and a critic of [[Aristotelian physics|Aristotelian natural philosophy]] and [[Aristotle]]'s concept of place ([[topos]]); [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī]], a critic of Aristotelian natural philosophy; [[Avicenna]], a critic of [[Aristotelian logic]]; [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]], a critic of Aristotelian logic and a pioneer of [[inductive logic]]; and [[Ibn Khaldun]], considered the father of the [[philosophy of history]] and [[sociology]] and a pioneer of [[social philosophy]]. However, not very much credible evidence to support such claims is forthcoming, at least in the field of Arabic-English translation methodology, with regards to the exact sciences of semantics and hermeneutics.

=== Sufi philosophy ===
{{Main|Sufi philosophy}}
[[Sufism]] (تصوف taṣawwuf) is a school of [[esoteric]] philosophy in [[Islam]], which is based on the pursuit of [[spirituality|spiritual]] [[truth]] as a definite goal to attain. To attain this supreme truth, Sufism has marked ''Lataif-e-Sitta'' (the six subtleties), ''Nafs'', ''Qalb'', ''Sirr'', ''Ruh'' ([[spirit]]), ''Khafi'' and ''Akhfa''. Apart from conventional religious practices, they also perform Muraqaba ([[meditation]]), Dhikr (Zikr or recitation), Chillakashi ([[asceticism]]) and Sama ([[esoteric]] [[music]] and [[dance]]).

'''Orenda''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔːr|ɛ|n|d|ə}} is an [[Iroquois]] name for a spiritual power inherent in people and their [[Natural environment|environment]].{{sfn|Hewitt|1902}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=orenda|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/orenda|website=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activities of nature were seen to be a "ceaseless struggle of one orenda against another, uttered and directed by the beings or bodies" in the environment.{{sfn|Hewitt|1902|p=41}} Orenda was deemed a motive force behind miracles, soothsaying, divination, prophecy, blessing, cursing, prayer, worship, and superstitions.{{sfn|Hewitt|1902|p=42}} Orenda is not a collective power and does not have a personification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=nature worship|date=2015|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://original.search.eb.com/eb/article-38271|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nineteenth- and 20th-century scholars compared the concept of orenda to that of [[mana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=mana|date=2015|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|edition=Web|url=http://original.search.eb.com/eb/article-9050428|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rose|first1=Herbert Jennings|title=Nvmen and Mana|journal=Harvard Theological Review|date=1951|volume=44|issue=3|pages=109–120|doi=10.1017/s0017816000027760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist J. N. B. Hewitt notes intrinsic similarities between the Iroquoian concept of Orenda and that of the [[Sioux]]an wakd or mahopa; the [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] manitowi, and the pokunt of the [[Shoshone]]. Across the Iroquois tribes, the concept was referred to variously as orenna or karenna by the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], [[Cayuga people|Cayuga]], and [[Oneida people|Oneida]]; urente by the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]], and iarenda or orenda by the Huron. A related term, otgon, denoted a specifically "malign, deadly, lethal, or destructive use" of orenda.{{sfn|Hewitt|1902|p=37}} Hewitt notes that orenda was regarded by Iroquoian peoples as distinct from concepts of life, soul, ghost, and mind.{{sfn|Hewitt|1902|p=44}}

For the Iroquois, a shaman was considered to be "one whose orenda is great, powerful", while a hunter's orenda determined whether he was successful in overcoming the orenda of the game, and in conflicts between nations, orenda determined the outcome.{{sfn|Hewitt|1902|p=38}} Orenda was also present in nature: storms were said to possess orenda. A strong connection existed between prayers and songs and orenda: through song, a bird, shaman, or rabbit put forth orenda.{{sfn|Hewitt|1902|p=40-43}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29503">A '''parent trigger''' is a legal maneuver through which parents can change the administration of a poorly performing public school—most notably, by transforming it into a [[charter school]].

The first parent trigger law was passed by the California legislature in January 2010. Similar laws have been adopted subsequently by Louisiana, Mississippi, Connecticut, Texas, Indiana and Ohio.&lt;ref name="NCSL 2012" /&gt;  The law has been invoked by parents in the [[Compton Unified School District|Compton]] and [[Adelanto, California#Education|Adelanto]] school districts of California; both efforts have been blocked by legal challenges. Since the Compton campaign, parents in different Southern California have begun to use the law to enact changes in their schools.

Most recently in California, parents in 20th Street Elementary School&lt;ref&gt;http://laschoolreport.com/parent-trigger-may-be-pulled-at-20th-street-elementary/&lt;/ref&gt; and Palm Lane Elementary School&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/charterschoice/2015/04/latest_calif_parent-trigger_effort_marks_only_10th_nationally_since_movements_beginning.html&lt;/ref&gt; have used the parent trigger law.

== History ==
Parent trigger laws were first introduced by the Los Angeles Parents Union (LAPU), founded in 2006 by [[Green Dot Public Schools]], a charter school company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hewitt|first=Alison|title='Parents Union' calling for school changes in L.A. schools|newspaper=Copley News Service|date=6 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bacon 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bacon|first=David|title=Trigger Laws • Does Signing a Petition Give Parents a Voice?|journal=Rethinking Schools|date=Fall 2011|volume=26|issue=1|url=http://www.rethinkingschools.org/archive/26_01/26_01_bacon.shtml|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Parents Union' calling for school changes in L.A. schools}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green Dot, led by [[Steve Barr (educational innovator)|Steve Barr]], also conducted campaigns in [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]]—using a pre-existing law for school transformation based on petitions from teachers—to transform public schools into charter schools.&lt;ref name="McGray 2009"&gt;{{cite news|last=McGray|first=Douglas|title=The Instigator: A crusader’s plan to remake failing schools.|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/05/11/090511fa_fact_mcgray|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=11 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, Green Dot formed Parent Revolution, a group specifically intended to lobby for parent trigger laws and retaining LAPU head Ben Austin as Executive Director. The laws envisioned would allow 51% of parents to form a Parent Union with control over their school and the ability to transform it into a charter.&lt;ref name="Ramirez 2009"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramirez|first=Eddy|title=A Plan for Parents to Shut Down Schools|newspaper=USNews|date=12 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking at a meeting organized by Green Dot, LA mayor Antonio Villaraigosa expressed support for the proposed laws.&lt;ref name="Llanos 2009"&gt;{{cite news|last=Llanos|first=Connie|title=Mayor backs controversial schools plan|newspaper=Daily News of Los Angeles|date=12 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Teachers Los Angeles]] (UTLA) criticized Green Dot and the mayor for attempted [[union busting]].&lt;ref name="Maxwell 2009"&gt;{{cite news|last=Maxwell|first=Lesli A.|title=L.A. to Weigh School-Management Plan|url=http://4lakidsnews.blogspot.com/2009/08/la-to-weigh-school-management-plan.html|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=Education Week|date=21 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Llanos - 25 Aug 2009"&gt;{{cite news|last=Llanos|first=Connie|title=LAUSD choice plan set for vote;  CHANGE: Proposal would give parents, communities more control of schools.|url=http://www.dailynews.com/education/ci_13196903|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Daily News|date=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, the [[Los Angeles Unified School District]] passed parent trigger rules stating that a majority of parents or future parents could transfer a school to outside management. The decision won praise from Parents Revolution and criticism from UTLA. However, some charter operators objected to rules that required charter schools to include neighborhood students and to employ custodial services from the district.&lt;ref name="Maxwell - 28 Oct 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maxwell|first=Lesli A.|title=L.A.

In January 2010, the California legislature passed a "Parent Empowerment" law (Article 3 of [http://legiscan.com/gaits/text/65517 SBX54], introduced by Senator [[Gloria J. Romero]] and Senator [[Bob Huff]] and signed by Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]), becoming the only state in the nation with a parent trigger law. The law's passage, just before a federal deadline on January 19,&lt;ref name="Paulson 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Paulson|first=Amanda|title=Education reform: California to join Race to the Top rush|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Education/2010/0105/Education-reform-California-to-join-Race-to-the-Top-rush|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|date=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  allowed California to compete for $700 million in federal [[Race to the Top]] funding (which it did not ultimately receive) by complying with a Race to the Top requirement that test scores be used to evaluate teachers.&lt;ref name="Wood 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wood|first=Daniel B.|title=California's education reforms hand more power to parents|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Education/2010/0107/California-s-education-reforms-hand-more-power-to-parents|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|date=7 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dwyer 2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dwyer|first=Liz|title=Why the Compton Parent Trigger Lawsuit Is a Good Thing|url=http://www.good.is/posts/why-the-compton-parent-trigger-lawsuit-is-a-good-thing/|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=Good.Is|date=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; SBX54 also includes an "open enrollment" provision, allowing students in underperforming schools to apply for admission at any other school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miranda|first=Nannette|title=California Assembly passes education reform|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/politics&amp;id=7202918|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=ABC Local|date=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parent Revolution—with a $1 million annual budget funded by the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation|Gates Foundation]], the [[Walton Family]] Foundation, the [[Casey Wasserman|Wasserman Foundation]], the [[Eli Broad|Broad Foundation]], and the [[William and Flora Hewlett Foundation|Hewlett Foundation]]—announced intentions to seek parent trigger actions across California.&lt;ref name="McDonald 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rizga 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Winter 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Winter|first=Caroline|title=In California, Public School Parents Stage a Coup|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-09-13/in-california-public-school-parents-stage-a-coup#p2|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two efforts have been conducted thus far.&lt;ref name="LAT 23 July 2012" /&gt;

Similar parent trigger laws have been proposed in more than 20 states, and been enacted in Mississippi, Texas, Indiana, and Louisiana.&lt;ref name="NCSL 2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=Parent Trigger Laws in the States|url=http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/educ/state-parent-trigger-laws.aspx|publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=25 September 2012|date=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tyre 2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tyre|first=Peg|title=Putting Parents in Charge|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/18/opinion/sunday/new-school-trigger-laws-take-parent-engagement-to-a-new-level.html|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A variation on the law, which uses parents' councils, was passed in Connecticut.&lt;ref name="Tyre 2011" /&gt; Ohio has established a pilot version of the law which applies only to the [[Columbus City Schools]].&lt;ref name="NCSL 2012" /&gt;  One parent trigger law was defeated in Florida.&lt;ref name="Moran 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Moran|first=Theresa|title=As Chicago Teachers Head Toward Strike, Democrats Turn on Their Union|url=http://labornotes.org/2012/09/chicago-teachers-head-toward-strike-democrats-turn-their-union|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=Labor Notes|date=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public advocates for parent trigger laws, besides Parent Revolution, include [[The Heartland Institute]],&lt;ref name="Bacon 2011" /&gt; [[Stand for Children]],&lt;ref name="LoBianco 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=LoBianco|first=Tom|title=‘Parent trigger’ would convert public schools|url=http://posttrib.suntimes.com/news/10153192-418/parent-trigger-would-let-parents-convert-schools.html|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=Indiana Post-Tribune|date=21 January 2012|agency=Associated press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michelle Rhee]].&lt;ref name="Wilson 05-2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Simone|title=Michelle Rhee, 'Parent Trigger' Supporters Are Behind Huge L.A.

== Provisions ==
California's trigger law applies to schools with an [[Academic Performance Index (California public schools)|Academic Performance Index]] score of below 800. Parents of children attending these schools may petition for one or more of four options:&lt;ref name="McDonald 2010"&gt;Patrick Range McDonald, "[http://www.laweekly.com/2010-12-09/news/Californias-Parent-Trigger/ California's Parent Trigger: How McKinley in Compton became the first school taken over by parents under a radical new law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706232037/http://www.laweekly.com/2010-12-09/news/Californias-Parent-Trigger/ |date=2012-07-06 }}," L.A. Weekly, December 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Convert the school into a [[Charter school|charter]]
* Replace the old staff and make budget decisions
* Dismiss the principal
* Dissolve the school and relocate the students to other schools.

If at least half of the school's parents sign a petition, the school district must implement the policy they choose. The aggregate group of parents whose children are likely to attend a school in the future have, independently, the same power.

== Implementation ==

As of May 2013, at least three school districts have been petitioned to implement a trigger:  [[Compton Unified School District]], [[Adelanto School District]],&lt;ref name="LAT 23 July 2012"&gt;{{cite news |title=Backers of parent trigger law score victory in court |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/07/backers-of-parent-trigger-law-score-victory-in-court-.html |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=23 July 2012 |accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Los Angeles Unified School District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Popular principal's dismissal leaves a South L.A. school divided |author=Teresa Watanabe |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-weigand-20130525,0,1229089,full.story | newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=24 May 2013 |accessdate=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===McKinley Elementary School, Compton, CA===

In Compton, Parent Revolution collected parent signatures to transfer administration of McKinley Elementary School to Celerity Education Group, a charter operator.&lt;ref name="McDonald 2010" /&gt; Paid staffers were joined by 15 parent volunteers who formed a group called McKinley Parents for Change.&lt;ref name="Rizga 2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rizga|first=Kristina|title=The Battle Over Charter Schools|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/03/parent-trigger-compton-NCLB|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=Mother Jones|date=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drive yielded signatures representing 61% of McKinley families.&lt;ref name="Wilson 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Simone|title=Compton School Takeover Supporters Pull Out YouTube 'Evidence' Of Teacher's Intimidation Tactics; Hundreds Of Angry, Confused Parents Show Up To District Board Meeting|url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/informer/2010/12/parent_trigger_charter_school.php|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=LA Weekly|date=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compton Unified School District, along with some unsatisfied parents, challenged the petition, arguing that Parent Revolution had given parents no choice in how to change the school (deciding beforehand on a charter school managed by Celerity) and questioning the validity of the signatures produced by the group.&lt;ref name="Dwyer 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rizga 2011" /&gt;  Parents criticized Parents Revolution, McKinley Elementary, and teachers for harassing them and pushing their own agendas during the conflict.&lt;ref name="Dwyer 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson 2010" /&gt;  Between 50 and 60 parents revoked their signatures after discovering what the petition was for, stating that Parent Revolution had misled them about its effects.&lt;ref name="Blume &amp; Watanabe 2010"&gt;{{cite news|title=Effort to convert Compton school to charter draws fire|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/dec/11/local/la-me-1211-compton-school-20101211|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=11 December 2010|author=Howard Blume|author2=Teresa Watanabe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school district demanded photographic identification to back up the parent signatures on the petition; Parent Revolution responded with a lawsuit that called this request undemocratic.&lt;ref name="Newton 2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Newton|first=Jim|title=Compton parents trigger reform|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb/15/opinion/la-oe-0215-newton-20110215|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the parent trigger at McKinley was not enacted.

Parent Revolution's second attempt at a parent trigger occurred in Adelanto, CA, at Desert Trails Elementary, then of the [[Adelanto Elementary School District]]. With the assistance of six parent volunteers, the group collected signatures for a petition to turn Desert Trails into a charter school.&lt;ref name="Wilson 01-2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Simone|title=Parent Trigger's Second Try: Minority parents target failing Adelanto school|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2012-01-12/news/parent-trigger-adelanto-california/|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=LA Weekly|date=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar disputes arose, with blame assigned to both sides—the core issue being the validity of the signatures on the petition.&lt;ref name="Winter 2012" /&gt; These signatures represented 70% of the school's 666 students.&lt;ref name="Watanabe 2012" /&gt;

However, support for the parent trigger action dropped below the required 50% when 90 parents rescinded their signatures, claiming like their Compton counterparts to have been misled.&lt;ref name="Watanabe 2012" /&gt; The Adelanto school board initially rejected the petition, calling too many of the signatures invalid.&lt;ref name="Anderson 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Troy|title=California school board blocks parent takeover bid|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-03-29/news/sns-rt-us-usa-schools-california-triggerbre82s09k-20120329_1_desert-trails-elementary-parent-revolution-school-board|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=29 March 2012|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, a California Superior Court decision overruled the board in favor of the petition, stating that the state law did not allow parents to revoke their signatures.&lt;ref name="Watanabe 2012" /&gt;  The school board rejected this plan also, saying there was not time to create a new school before September 2012, and instead creating an advisory committee called the Alternative Governance Board.&lt;ref name="Watanabe 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Watanabe|first=Teresa|title=Mojave Desert parents go back to court over charter school issue|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/08/mojave-desert-parents-go-to-court-over-charter-school.html|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This body would consist of three parents, three teachers, two representatives of the superintendent, and a community member.&lt;ref name="Lombardo 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lombardo|first=Lynnea|title=Battle over Desert Trails continues|url=http://www.vvdailypress.com/news/battle-36630-continues-desert.html|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=Victorville Daily Press|date=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to many, this action constituted open defiance of the court's decision.&lt;ref name="WSJ 2012"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Parent-Trigger War Escalates|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444270404577607432751373136 |accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parents challenged the decision again in court,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/charterschoice/2012/08/the_adelanto_school_board_has.html California 'Parent-Trigger' Effort Thrown Back Into Turmoil], Education Week.&lt;/ref&gt; raising the legal question of whether the law gives the school or the parents the final authority over implementing reforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-parent-trigger-20120820,0,4783010.story As school starts, new questions in Adelanto charter fight], LA Times.&lt;/ref&gt; As litigation continued into the 2012 school year, the pro-trigger parents (who formed a group called the Desert Trails Parents Union) have solicited proposals for new schools from several charter operators.&lt;ref name="Winter 2012" /&gt;  In July 2013, the courts ordered Desert Trails Elementary School to be replaced with Desert Trails Preparatory Academy, operated by the same Charter School administration that runs the LaVerne Preparatory Academy in Hesperia, CA.

Adelanto Elementary School District continued to maintain some control over the school, as the courts ordered a provisional charter agreement at the school's beginning due to the Parent Trigger Law.  In December 2015, AESD revoked the school's charter for failing to address the concerns that the Board of Trustees had for the campus.  DTPA denied the allegations and responded to the decision that the District is making retaliatory inquiries and accusations&lt;ref name="Lindstrom 2014"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lindstrom|first1=Natasha|title=What Happens After Fed-Up Parents Take Over A School?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/02/what-happens-after-fed-up-parents-take-over-a-school/283481/|website=The Atlantic|publisher=Atlantic Monthly Group|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that have nothing to do with student progress.&lt;ref name="Yarbroughwillnotrenew" /&gt;

Retrieved on May 8, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although continuing litigation concerning ownership of the property is unresolved, this decision ended AESD's involvement with the campus beginning with the 2016-17 School Year.

Beau Yarbrough of the ''[[San Bernardino Sun]]'' wrote that it became "difficult to compare apples to apples between Desert Trails Elementary and how Desert Trails Prep is doing today" because around the time Desert Trails was converted, the State of California changed its standardized testing to meet the [[Common Core]] requirements.&lt;ref name=Yarbroughwillnotrenew&gt;Yarbrough, Beau.

===West Athens Elementary School, Los Angeles, CA===

Unhappy about the school’s culture of low expectations, student safety, and low academic outputs, parents at West Athens Elementary School formed their own parent chapter and began to organize around the Parent Empowerment Act. Leveraging the law, the parents eventually suspended their parent petition process when the District agreed to hold negotiations with the parent chapter. Eventually, the parents and the LA Unified School District struck a deal to spend an additional $300,000 on personnel at the school, including hiring a full-time school psychiatrist and several aides. The agreement calls on the district to do a better job including parents in the school’s day-to-day operations, make the school safer and cleaner, create better lines of communication between teachers and parents and provide additional training for teachers and staff, all to create a school culture of high expectations for the campus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailynews.com/social-affairs/20140523/lausd-avoids-parent-trigger-threat-agrees-to-300000-in-improvements-at-west-athens-school&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lennox Middle School, Los Angeles, CA===

Parents organized to discuss ways to improve the school for their students, and held stakeholder meetings with teachers and district leaders.  Because of the threat of the Parent Empowerment Act, parents were able to transform their campus without gathering a petition.  The District agreed to conduct a comprehensive needs assessment process.  As a result of the needs assessment, the District implemented a turnaround plan that has community support, to include a new principal, more electives for ELL students, more freedom for teachers to teach creatively, and a strong college-going culture.  Parents maintained support of the Superintendent and the school leadership and work in partnership with the school.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2013/aug/23/local/la-me-0823-lennox-parents-20130823&lt;/ref&gt;

===Padres Revolucionarios de Haddon===
Parents organized because students did not feel safe, motivated or inspired at the school.  Despite their efforts to solicit change before forming a parent union, they were met with resistance by the District.  After obtaining a majority of parent signatures, the parents began to see progress within the school and district toward reform, which led the parent union to pause their effort and await the results of a new teacher-led effort.  The parent union eventually ended their petition campaign after the teachers formally adopted a school transformation plan that allows teachers to have more control over their school and allows them to better meet the needs of their students.  The parents continue to collaborate with school officials and teachers to make the reform plan a success.&lt;ref&gt;http://laschoolreport.com/haddon-parents-abandon-trigger-still-get-changes/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weigand Parents United===
Following 15 years of low-performing academic results, and one unsuccessful effort to collaborate with teachers to gather petitions calling for key improvements for the school and for the principal to be replaced before the enactment of the Parent Empowerment Act, parents organized under the new law.  The parents actively supported the teachers, but wanted to see a new leader to lead the students to academic success.  The strong majority of parents successfully brought in a new principal.  The parents and the community now work collaboratively with the District.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/14/lausd-parent-trigger-_n_3270039.html?&lt;/ref&gt;

===24th Street Elementary===
Parents had tried for years to organize change with the District.  They eventually organized into a Parent Union and gathered signatures from 69% of parents, empowering them to solicit proposals from both District and charter applications to transform the school.  The final result was bifurcated – the District maintained the K-4 program and a charter school that was co-located on the campus operates the new 5-8 program.  The parents also negotiated a new pre-K program, run by the District, as well as a presence on the principal and teacher hiring committees.  A strong District-charter collaboration now shapes the school and new leadership has created a new culture.&lt;ref&gt;http://laschoolreport.com/trigger-parents-help-return-pre-k-to-24th-st-elementary/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Groups such as the Center for Teacher Quality and Fund Education Now have described the campaign for parent trigger laws as [[astroturfing]]—a fake popular movement which is actually originated by a wealthy elite. Other groups also focused on reforming public school education, such as the Center for Education Reform, point out that teachers' unions regularly spend substantial sums of money defeating Parental Choice, charter schools, tuition vouchers and other education reforms—and that "astroturfing" isn't limited to any one side in education debates.

In the case of Parent Revolution, critics point to sponsorship by the Green Dot charter company. Related arguments have been directed at the 2012 film ''[[Won't Back Down (film)|Won't Back Down]]'', which promotes parent trigger laws. ''Won't Back Down'' was created by [[Philip Anschutz]]'s [[Walden Media]] and supported by [[Walmart]] and the [[American Legislative Exchange Council]] (ALEC). Critics have echoed union claims that a primary goal of the campaign is to circumvent union protections for public school teachers.&lt;ref name="Eidelson 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Eidelson|first=Josh|title=The Walmart Model for Education: Walmart, Right-Wing Media Company Hold Star-Studded Benefit Promoting Education Reform Film|url=http://www.commondreams.org/view/2012/08/15-7|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=In These Times|date=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some parents and community leaders in Compton criticized Parent Revolution for misleading petitioners about the nature of parent trigger laws. They also cited Parent Revolution's lack of transparency and apparently top-down organization.&lt;ref name="Rizga 2011" /&gt;  A speech from Mayor Villaraigosa in favor of a parent trigger for McKinley Elementary triggered demonstrations, with signs reading "Our Kids Are Not for Sale" and chants of "No charter school!"&lt;ref name="Blume &amp; Watanabe 2010" /&gt; Others noted that McKinley's test scores were already improving and suggested that Parent Revolution chose the school cynically in order to capture its positive results.&lt;ref name="Rizga 2011" /&gt; Caroline Grannan of Parents Across America argues that the petitions have been divisive among parents in the districts where they were attempted.&lt;ref name="Grannan 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Grannan|first=Caroline|title=Triggers Create Nothing but Chaos and Division|url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/03/18/hopes-and-feard-for-parent-trigger-laws/triggers-create-nothing-but-chaos-and-division|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3517">[[File:Pasar Keputran Surabaya.JPG|thumb|300px|Pasar Keputran, one of ''pasar pagi'' in [[Surabaya]], Indonesia.]]
'''''Pasar pagi''''' ([[Malay language|Malay]]/[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], lit.: "morning market") is a type of traditional [[Market (place)|market]] found in [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]], quite similar to a [[wet market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Pasar Pagi Cimahi by Mirwan Maulana | work = World Photo Organisation | url = http://www.worldphoto.org/images/image/218215/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Operating hours==
[[File:PasarPagi002.jpg|thumb|''Pasar pagi'' in Malaysia.]]
''Pasar pagi'' mostly operate from early morning to the afternoon.&lt;ref name="JP-market"&gt;{{cite news | title = Weekly 5: Traditional markets around the clock | newspaper = The Jakarta Post | date = 19 December 2014 | url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/12/19/weekly-5-traditional-markets-around-clock.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, there is also a related traditional market called ''[[pasar malam]]'' (lit.: "night market"). The difference between ''pasar pagi'' and ''pasar malam'' is in its operating hours — ''pasar pagi'' opens early in the morning from dawn to the noon every day, approximately from 04:00 to 12:00. While ''pasar malam'' opens at night, approximately from 17:00 to 22:00, and only on selected days of a week. 

The type of goods being sold is also quite different. ''Pasar pagi'' is where many housewives, domestic helps and local folks appear to shop their daily needs, mostly uncooked fresh [[Greengrocer|produce]]. The things which are on sale are usually fresh daily produce, including [[fruits]], [[vegetables]], [[spices]], [[Fish as food|fish]], [[meat]], [[Egg as food|eggs]], and all kinds of daily products. While ''pasar malam'' is more to cater a leisurely shopping and eating-out activity, selling ready to eat food, snacks, clothing and various knick-knacks.

==Indonesia==
In Indonesia, practically all traditional markets are ''pasar pagi'', open from early in the [[dawn]] to mid day. Often the stalls are temporarily overflow occupying nearby streets around the marketplace — which normally open for traffic in other hours of the day. They sell fresh produces, such as vegetables, fruits, chicken, meat and fish. The major ''pasar pagi'' in [[Jakarta]] are Pasar Pagi Mangga Dua, Pasar Induk Kramat Jati, [[Pasar Minggu]] and [[Senen|Pasar Senen]]. Pasar Minggu specialized on fruits and vegetables, while Pasar Kue Subuh in Senen specialized on selling ''[[kue]]'', as they offer a rich variety of traditional Indonesian snack, open every ''subuh'' (dawn).&lt;ref name="JP-market"/&gt;

==Malaysia==
In Malaysia, one of the biggest ''pasar pagi'' is at Pasar Pudu at [[Pudu, Kuala Lumpur|Pudu]] and Jalan Pasar at [[Chow Kit]] area in [[Kuala Lumpur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Chow Kit’s lively markets | date = 31 October 2014 | newspaper = The Star | url = http://www.thestar.com.my/news/community/2014/10/31/chow-kits-lively-markets-brave-the-noisy-crowd-for-a-unique-shopping-experience/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sound change}}

In [[historical linguistics]], '''phonological change''' is any [[sound change]] which alters the distribution of [[phoneme]]s in a language. In other words, a language develops a new system of oppositions among its phonemes. Old contrasts may disappear, new ones may emerge, or they may simply be rearranged.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Historical Linguistics|last=Henrich Hock|first=Hans|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1991|isbn=|edition=Second|location=Berlin; New York|pages=53–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sound change may be an impetus for changes in the phonological structures of a language (and likewise, phonological change may sway the process of sound change).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One process of phonological change is ''rephonemicization'', in which the distribution of phonemes changes by either addition of new phonemes or a reorganization of existing phonemes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Historical Linguistics|last=Crowley|first=Terry|last2=Bowern|first2=Claire|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780195365542|edition=4th|location=Oxford; New York|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mergers and splits are types of rephonemicization and are discussed further below.

== Types ==
In a typological scheme first systematized by [[Henry M. Hoenigswald]] in 1965, a historical [[sound law]] can only affect a phonological system in one of three ways:
* Conditioned merger (which Hoenigswald calls "primary split"), in which some instances of phoneme A become an existing phoneme B; the number of phonemes does not change, only their distribution.
* Phonemic split (which Hoenigswald calls "secondary split"), in which some instances of A become a new phoneme B; this is phonemic differentiation in which the number of phonemes increases.
* Unconditioned merger, in which all instances of phonemes A and B become A; this is phonemic reduction, in which the number of phonemes decreases.
This classification does not consider mere changes in pronunciation, that is, phonetic change, even [[chain shift]]s, in which neither the number nor the distribution of phonemes is affected.

==Phonetic vs. phonological change==
[[Sound change|Phonetic change]] can occur without any modification to the phoneme inventory or phonemic correspondences. This change is purely [[Allophone|allophonic]] or subphonemic. This can entail one of two changes: either the phoneme turns into a new allophone—meaning the phonetic form changes—or the distribution of allophones of the phoneme changes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

For the most part, phonetic changes are examples of [[allophone|allophonic]] differentiation or assimilation; i.e., sounds in specific environments acquire new phonetic features or perhaps lose phonetic features they originally had. For example, the [[voice (phonetics)|devoicing]] of the vowels {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/ɯ/}} in certain environments in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the [[nasalization]] of [[vowel]]s before [[nasal consonant|nasal]]s (common but not universal), changes in [[place of articulation|point of articulation]] of [[stop consonant|stop]]s and nasals under the influence of adjacent vowels.

Phonetic change in this context refers to the lack of phonological restructuring, not a small degree of sound change. For example, [[chain shift]]s such as the [[Great Vowel Shift]] in which nearly all of the vowels of the English language changed or the allophonic differentiation of /s/, originally {{IPA|*[s]}}, into {{IPA|[s z ʃ ʒ ʂ ʐ θ χ χʷ h]}}, do not qualify as phonological change as long as all of the [[Phone (phonetics)|phones]] remain in complementary distribution.

Many phonetic changes provide the raw ingredients for later phonemic innovations. In [[Proto-Italic]], for example, intervocalic */s/ became *[z]. It was a phonetic change, merely a mild and superficial complication in the phonological system, but when *[z] merged with */r/, the effect on the phonological system was greater. (The example will be discussed below, under '''conditioned merger'''.)

Similarly, in the prehistory of [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Indo-Iranian]], the [[velar consonant|velars]] */k/ and */g/ acquired distinctively [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatal]] articulation before front vowels (*/e/, */i/, */ē/ */ī/), so that {{PIE|*/ke/}} came to be pronounced {{PIE|*[t͡ʃe]}} and {{PIE|*/ge/ *[d͡ʒe]}}, but the phones {{PIE|*[t͡ʃ]}} and {{PIE|*[d͡ʒ]}} occurred only in that environment. However, when */e/, */o/, */a/ later fell together as Proto-Indo-Iranian */a/ (and */ē/ */ō/ */ā/ likewise fell together as */ā/), the result was that the allophonic palatal and velar stops now contrasted in identical environments: */ka/ and /ča/, /ga/ and /ǰa/, and so on. The difference became phonemic. (The "law of palatals" is an example of phonemic split.)

Sound changes generally operate for a limited period of time, and once established, new phonemic contrasts rarely remain tied to their ancestral environments. For example, [[Sanskrit]] acquired "new" /ki/ and /gi/ sequences via [[analogy]] and borrowing, and likewise /ču/, {{PIE|/ǰu/}}, /čm/, and similar novelties; and the reduction of the [[diphthong]] */ay/ to Sanskrit /ē/ had no effect at all on preceding velar stops.

==Merger==
Phonemic '''merger''' is a loss of distinction between phonemes. Occasionally, the term '''reduction''' refers to phonemic merger. It is not to be confused with the meaning of the word "reduction" in phonetics, such as [[vowel reduction]], but phonetic changes may contribute to phonemic mergers.

===Conditioned merger===
Conditioned merger, or primary split, takes place when some, but not all, allophones of a phoneme, say A, merge with some other phoneme, B. The immediate results are these:
* there are the same number of contrasts as before.
* there are fewer words with A than before.
* there are more words of B than before.
* there is at least one environment for which A, for the time being, no longer occurs, called a ''gap'' in the distribution of the phoneme.
* there is, under certain circumstances, an [[alternation (linguistics)|alternation]] between A and B if inflection or derivation result in A sometimes but not always being in the environment in which it merged with B.

==== Example from Middle English ====
For a simple example, without alternation, early Middle English /d/ after stressed syllables followed by /r/ became /ð/: ''módor, fæder'' &gt; ''mother, father'' /ðr/, ''weder'' &gt; ''weather'', and so on. Since /ð/ was already a structure-point in the language, the innovation resulted merely in more /ð/ and less /d/ and a gap in the distribution of /d/ (though not a very conspicuous one).
:Note 1: thanks to borrowing, from dialects as well as other languages, the original distribution has been disturbed: ''rudder, adder'' in Standard English (but forms with /ð/ are attested in nonstandard dialects).
:Note 2: one who knows German can figure out which cases of English /ð/ were originally /ð/ and which changed from /d/. Original /d/ corresponds to /t/ in German, and original /ð/ corresponds to /d/. Thus, ''wether'' = German ''Widder, leather = Leder, brother = Bruder, whether = weder'', pointing to original /ð/ in English; ''weather'' = German ''Wetter, father = Vater, mother = Mutter'' pointing to original /d/.
:Note 3: alternation between /d/ and /ð/ would have been a theoretical possibility in English, as in sets like ''hard, harder; ride, rider'', but any such details have been erased by the commonplace diachronic process called [[morphological leveling]].

==== Devoicing of voiced stops in German ====
A trivial (if all-pervasive) example of conditioned merger is the [[Final-obstruent devoicing|devoicing of voiced stops]] in German when in word-final position or immediately before a compound boundary (see: [[Help:IPA/German]]):

*''*hand'' "hand" &gt; /hant/ (cf. plural ''Hände'' /ˈhɛndə/)
*''Handgelenk'' "wrist" /ˈhantgəlɛŋk/
*''*bund'' "league, association" &gt; /bʊnt/ (cf. plural ''Bünde'' /ˈbʏndə/)
*''*gold'' "gold" &gt; /gɔlt/
*''*halb'' "half" &gt; /halp/ (cf. ''halbieren'' "to halve" /halˈbiːʁən/)
*''halbamtlich'' "semi-official" /ˈhalpʔamtlɪç/
*''*berg'' "mountain" /bɛɐ̯k/ (cf. plural ''Berge'' /ˈbɛɐ̯gə/)
*''*klug'' "clever, wise" &gt; /kluːk/ (cf. fem. ''kluge'' /ˈkluːgə/)

There were, of course, also many cases of original voiceless stops in final position: ''Bett'' "bed", ''bunt'' "colorful", ''Stock'' "(walking) stick, cane". To sum up: there are the same number of structure points as before, /p t k b d g/, but there are more cases of /p t k/ than before and fewer of /b d g/, and there is a gap in the distribution of /b d g/ (they are never found in word-final position or before a compound boundary).

:Note 1: this split is easily recoverable by [[internal reconstruction]] because it results in '''alternations''' whose conditions are transparent. Thus ''Bund'' "bunch" (as in, keys) /bʊnt/ has a plural ''Bünde'' /ˈbʏndə/ in contrast to ''bunt'' "colorful" with /t/ in all environments (feminine /ˈbʊntə/, neuter /ˈbʊntəs/ and so on). In a '''neutralizing environment''', such as a voiceless stop in word-final position, one cannot tell which of two possibilities was the original sound. The choice is resolved if the corresponding segment can be found in a non-neutralizing position, as when a suffix follows. Accordingly, a non-inflected form like ''und'' /ʔʊnt/ "and" is historically opaque (though as the spelling hints, the /t/ was originally *''d'').

:Note 2: unlike most phonological changes, this one became a "surface" rule in German, so loan-words whose source had a voiced stop in the devoicing environment are taken into German with a voiceless one instead: ''Klub'' "club" (association) /klʊp/ from English ''club.'' The same goes for truncated forms: '''Bub''' (for formal ''Bube'' "boy") is /buːp/.
::Note 2a: the surface alternation is what allows modern German orthography to write stops morphophonemically, thus ''Leib'' "loaf", ''Hand'' "hand", ''Weg'' "way", all with voiceless final stops in the simplex form and in compounds, but /b d g/ in inflected forms. In Old High and Middle High German, all voiceless stops were written as pronounced: ''hleip, hant, uuec'' and so on.

:Note 3: the same distribution holds for /s/ vs. /z/, but it arose by a completely different process, the '''voicing''' of original */s/ between vowels: *''mūs'' "mouse" &gt; ''Maus'' /maʊs/, *''mūsīz'' "mice" (for earlier *''mūsiz'') &gt; ''Mäuse'' /ˈmɔʏzə/. Original long (now short) ''ss'' does not voice medially, as in'' küssen'' "to kiss" /ˈkʏsen/, nor does /s/ from Proto-West-Germanic *''t'', as in ''Wasser'' "water" /ˈvasɐ/, ''Fässer'' "kegs" /ˈfɛsɐ/ plural of ''Fass'' /fas/ (= English ''vat''), müßig "idle" /ˈmyːsɪç/. German {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, as in ''Fisch'' "fish", reflects original *''sk'' (in native words) and does not become voiced in any environment: ''Fischer'' "fisherman" {{IPA|/ˈfɪʃɐ/}}. (German has {{IPA|/ʒ/}} only in loanwords: ''Genie'' {{IPA|/ʒeˈniː/}} "genius", ''Gage'' {{IPA|/ˈɡaːʒə/}} "salary".)

==== Rhotacism in Latin ====
More typical of the aftermath of a conditioned merger is the famous case of [[Rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]] in Latin (also seen in some [[Osco-Umbrian languages|Sabellian]] language spoken in the same area): Proto-Italic *''s'' &gt; Latin /r/ between vowels: *''gesō'' "I do, act" &gt; Lat. ''gerō'' (but perfect ''gessi'' &lt; *''ges-s''- and participle ''gestus'' &lt; *''ges-to''-, etc., with unchanged *''s'' in all other environments, even in the same paradigm).

This sound law is quite complete and regular, and in its immediate wake there were no examples of /s/ between vowels except for a few words with a special condition (''miser'' "wretched", ''caesariēs'' "bushy hair", ''diser''(''c'')''tus'' "eloquent": that is, rhotacism did not take place when an /r/ followed the *''s''). However, a new crop of /s/ between vowels soon arose from three sources. (1) a shortening of /ss/ after a diphthong or long vowel: ''causa'' "lawsuit" &lt; *''kawssā'', ''cāsa'' "house' &lt; *''kāssā'', ''fūsus'' "poured, melted" &lt; *''χewssos''. (2) [[univerbation]]: ''nisi'' (''nisī'') "unless" &lt; the phrase *''ne sei'', ''quasi'' (''quasī'') "as if" &lt; the phrase *''kʷam sei''. (3) borrowings, such as ''rosa'' "rose" /rosa/, from a Sabellian source (the word is clearly somehow from Proto-Italic *''ruθ''- "red" but equally clearly not native Latin), and many words taken from or through Greek (''philosōphia, basis, casia,'' ''Mesopotamia'', etc., etc.).

==== Alliteration and "gn" in Latin ====
{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2018}}
A more entertaining example of conditioned merger is the behavior of [[stop consonant|stop]]s in Latin, voiced and voiceless alike, when they were immediately followed by a nasal. Such stops became nasals themselves, of the same point of articulation as the original stop, thereby increasing (if only slightly) the inventory of nasals, and creating a gap in the distribution of stops:

*''*sabnyom'' "Samnium" &gt; ''Samnium'' (a region in the southern Apennines)
*''*swepnos'' "sleep" &gt; ''somnus'' (''so &lt; *swe'' is regular)
*''*atnos'' "year" &gt; ''annus'' (cf. Gothic ''aþna''- "year")
*''*supimos'' "highest" &gt; *''supmos &gt; summus''

In these cases there is a little reasonably obvious alternation: ''Sabīni'' "Samnites", ''sopor'' "(deep) sleep" &lt; *''swepor'', superior "higher" &lt; *''supisyōs'', but the history of ''annus'' is recoverable only from comparative evidence.

Now, if the pattern holds, *''gn, *kn'' would become {{IPA|[ŋn]}}. Forms like the following are found:
*''dignus'' "worthy" &lt; *''dek-no''-
*''lignum'' "firewood &lt; *''leg-no''- (root *''leg''- "gather"; timber, structural wood, is ''tignum'' &lt; *''tek-no''-,  root *''tek''- "build")
*''agnus'' "lamb" &lt; *''agʷnos'' or *''H₂egʷnos'' (cf. Greek ''ámnos'' "lamb") (In Latin, Proto-Italic labiovelars lose the labial feature adjacent to a consonant: ''relictus'' "left behind" &lt; *''likʷ-to''- cf. ''relinquō'' "leave behind", Greek ''leipō'')

Among the first questions when the forms are examined would be, "How would the Romans have spelled {{IPA|[ŋn]}} if that were the outcome of *''kn'', *''g(ʷ)n''?" The standard spelling -''gn''- would not be a particularly obvious choice, which might argue that dorsal stops behave differently from the labials and apicals and that *''k'' became ''g'' but did not undergo the further assimilation to a nasal articulation. However, in inscriptions, non-standard spellings are found like SINNU = standard ''signum'' "sign, insigne", INGNEM = standard ''ignem'' accus. sing. "fire". It is hard to relate these to /gn/, as implied by the approved orthography, but such spellings are understandable if the actual pronunciation was {{IPA|[ŋn]}}.

Given this encouraging epigraphic evidence, are there any other reasons for thinking that {{IPA|[ŋn]}} was in fact the outcome of original dorsal stop plus nasal? There are at least three:

:(1) The raising of *''e'' to Latin /i/, as seen in these examples, is seen also with *''e'' before certain original {{IPA|[ŋ]}}, as in ''tingō'' "dye, color" &lt; *''teng''-; ''quīnque'' "five" (from *''quinque'') &lt; *''penkʷe;'' and such a raising is common in diachronic developments (it takes place in Proto-Germanic,{{Fix|text=bad example}}&lt;!-- the raising occurs before all nasals followed by another consonant, not just the velar nasal --&gt; as in Old English ''hring'' "bracelet, torque", German ''Ring'', &lt; Proto-Germanic *''hrengaz'' revealed by the Finnish borrowing ''rengas'' {{IPA|/reŋŋas/}} "ring", stem ''renka''-; and in the recent history of English, there was another round of such raising, as in ''ink'' &lt; Middle English ''enke'', the word ''English'' itself {{IPA|/ɪŋɡlɪʃ/}}.
:(2) Romance reflexes point to {{IPA|[ŋn]}}, most clearly Romanian, for example Romanian ''lemn'' "wood" &lt; *{{IPA|[liŋnu]}}. The point is that the regular Romanian reflex of Latin ''ct'' is ''pt'', thus Romanian ''opt'' "eight" &lt; ''octo'', ''fapt'' "deed" &lt; ''factus''. That is, dorsal stop plus apical stop becomes labial plus apical, and Romamian ''mn'' &lt; Latin ''gn'' makes the best sense if the latter stood for {{IPA|[ŋn]}}. Other Romance languages agree, if less forcefully. In most of them, standard languages and dialects alike, the regular reflex is {{IPA|[ɲ]}}, (palatal nasal). It is possible to get from [gn] to {{IPA|[ɲ]}}, of course, but it is a much shorter trip from {{IPA|[ŋn]}}, which involves nothing more than a mutual assimilation between two points of articulation.
:(3) The root-forms known from Classical Latin as ''nō-'' "know, notice" and ''nā-'' "be born" are etymologically ''gnō-'' (&lt; *''ǵneH₃''-) and ''gnā-'' (&lt; *''ǵenH₁''-), as guaranteed by Old Latin forms and copious comparative evidence. In compounds with ''in-'' and ''com-'', forms like ''ignōtus'' "unknown", ''cognātus'' "related by birth" are found. The early forms of such compounds would necessarily have been *''iŋ-gnō-, *koŋ-gnā''-. It is regular for stops to be lost between resonants in Latin, as in ''ornāre'' "to adorn" &lt; *''ord(i)nāre, pulmentum'' "food, vittles" &lt; *''pelpmentom'' (and as in these examples, in most such cases, the second resonant is a nasal, suggesting intermediate stages like *''ornnāre'', *''pelmmentom''). In any case, the change of {{IPA|*[ŋɡn]}} to {{IPA|[ŋn]}} is in accord with expectations based on other cluster simplifications in Latin.

Note: Roman grammarians, who make some fairly fine observations about Latin phonetics, do not mention ''g'' = {{IPA|[ŋ]}} (their phonetic remarks are always in terms of letters) despite being thoroughly familiar with the idea from Greek orthography, where gamma = {{IPA|[ŋ]}} before /k/ and /g/, as in ''agkúlos'' "bent" {{IPA|/aŋkýlos/}}, ''ággellos'' "messenger" {{IPA|/áŋɡellos/}}. There are several possible explanations for this silence, including mere oversight; but it is entirely possible that much-schoolmastered Standard Latin pronunciation is an example of a [[spelling pronunciation]] that became standard, like the pronunciation of the word ''figure'' in American English in place of the original pronunciation rhyming with ''bigger''.  The testimony of the Romance reflexes can be taken with greater confidence than the silence of grammarians.

==== Concerning the number of contrasts ====
{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2018}}
One of the traits of conditioned merger, as outlined above, is that the total number of contrasts remains the same, but it is possible for such splits to '''reduce''' the number of contrasts. It happens if all of the conditioned merger products merge with one or another phoneme.

For example, in Latin, the Pre-Latin phoneme *θ (from Proto-Italic *''tʰ'' &lt; PIE *''dh'') disappears as such by merging with three other sounds: *''f'' (from PIE *''bh'' and *''gʷh''), *''d'', and *''b:''

Initially *θ &gt;'' f:''
*PItal. *''tʰi-n-kʰ''- "model, shape" &gt; *''θi-n-χ''- &gt; Lat. ''fingō'' (PIE root *''dheyǵh''- "smear, work with the hands"; cf. Sanskrit ''dihanti'' "they smear", Avestan'' daēza''- "wall" = Greek ''teîkhos;'' English ''dough'' &lt; OE ''dāh'' besides ''dāg'' &lt; PIE *''dhoyǵh''-)
*PItal. *''tʰwor''- "door" &gt; *''θwor''- &gt; Lat. ''forēs'' "door" (PIE *''dhwor''-; like most reflexes plural only; cf Eng. ''door'' &lt; *''dhur''-, Greek ''thúrā'' (probably &lt; *''dhwor''-) usually ''thúrai'' pl.)
::Cf. Latin ferō "carry" &lt; Proto-Italic *pʰer- &lt; PIE *bher-; Latin frāter "brother" &lt; Proto-Italic *pʰrātēr &lt; PIE *bhre-H₂ter-

Medially adjacent to *''l, *r'', or *''u,'' *θ becomes ''b:''
*PItal. *''wertʰom'' "word" &gt; *''werθom'' &gt; *''werðom'' (? *''werβom'') &gt; Lat. ''verbum'' (cf. English ''word'' &lt; *''wurdaⁿ'' &lt; PIE *''wṛdhom'', Lithuanian ''vaṙdas'' "name")
*PItal. *''rutʰros'' "red" &gt; *''ruθros'' &gt; *''ruðros'' (? *''ruβros'') &gt; Latin ''ruber'' (via *''rubers'' &lt; *''rubrs'' &lt; *''rubros''), cf. ''rubra'' fem. ''rubrum'' neut.
*PItal. *-''tʰlo-/*-tʰlā''- "tool suffix" &gt; Latin -''bulum, -bula:'' PIE *''peH₂-dhlo''- "nourishment" &gt; PItal. *''pā-tʰlo''- &gt; *''pāθlo''- &gt; Latin ''pābulum;'' PIE *''suH-dhleH₂''- "sewing implement" &gt; PItal. *''sūtʰlā'' &gt; *''sūθlā'' &gt; Latin ''sūbula'' "cobbler's awl"
::Intervocalic Latin -''b''- is from PIE *''bh'', *''s'', and (rarely and problematically) *''b:'' Lat. ''ambō'' "both" &lt; PIE *''ambh''- or *''H₂embh''- (cf. Greek ''amphi''-); Lat. ''crābrō'' "hornet" &lt; ''*ḱṛHs-ron''- (cf. Vedic ''śīrṣn''- "hornet"); Lat. ''cannabis'' "hemp" (cf. Old English ''hænep'' "hemp"). The change of *-''sr''- to -''br''- is itself presumably via *-''θr- &gt; *-ðr- &gt; *-βr''-.

Elsewhere, *θ becomes d:
*PItal. *''metʰyo''- "middle" &gt; *''meθyo''- &gt; Pre-Lat. *''meðyo''- &gt; Lat. ''medius'' (three syllables; PIE *''medhyo''-, cf. Sanskrit ''madhya''-, Greek ''més''(''s'')''os'' &lt; *''meth-yo''-)
*PItal. *''pʰeytʰ''- &gt; *''feyθ''- &gt; *''feyð''- &gt; Lat. ''fīdus'' "trusting" (cf. Greek ''peíthomai'' "am persuaded", English ''bid'' "order, ask")
::Intervocalic -''d''- in Latin comes from PIE *''d'' in ''ped''- "foot", ''sīdere'' "to sit down", ''cord''-  "heart"

There is no alternation to give away the historical story, there, via [[internal reconstruction]]; the evidence for these changes is almost entirely from comparative reconstruction. That reconstruction makes it easy to unriddle the story behind the weird forms of the Latin paradigm ''jubeō'' "order",'' jussī'' perfect, ''jussus'' participle. If the root is inherited, it would have to have been PIE *''yewdh-''.

===Unconditioned merger===
Unconditioned merger, that is, complete loss of a contrast between two or more phonemes, is not very common. Most mergers are conditioned. That is, most apparent mergers of A and B have an environment or two in which A did something else, such as drop or merge with C.

Typical is the unconditioned merger seen in the Celtic conflation of the PIE plain voiced series of stops with the breathy-voiced series: *''bh, *dh, *ǵh, *gh'' are indistinguishable in Celtic etymology from  the reflexes of *''b *d *ǵ *g''. The collapse of the contrast cannot be stated in whole-series terms because the labiovelars do not co-operate. PIE *''gʷ'' everywhere falls together with the reflexes of *''b'' and *''bh'' as Proto-Celtic *''b'', but *''gʷh'' seems to have become PCelt. *''gʷ'', lining up with PCelt. *''kʷ'' &lt; PIE *''kʷ''.

====Examples====
*OE'' y'' and'' ý'' (short and long high front rounded vowels) fell together with ''i'' and'' í'' via a simple phonetic unrounding: OE'' hypp, cynn, cyssan, brycg, fyllan, fýr, mýs, brýd'' became modern ''hip, kin, kiss, bridge, fill, fire, mice, bride''. There is no way to tell by inspection whether a modern /i ay/ goes back to a rounded or an unrounded vowel. The change is not even reflected in modern spelling since it took place too early to be captured in Middle English Spelling conventions. Of course, current spellings like ''type, thyme, psyche'', etc., have nothing to do with OE ''y'' = /y/.
*There is a massive, consistent body of evidence that PIE *''l'' and *''r'' merged totally in Proto-Indo-Iranian, as did PIE *''e *o *a'' into Proto-Indo-Iranian *''a''.
*The evolution of Romance shows a systematic collection of unconditioned mergers in connection with the loss of Latin vowel length. Latin had ten vowels, five long and five short (i, ī; e, ē; a, ā; and so on). In the variety of Romance underlying Sardo and some other dialects of the islands, the ten vowels simply fell together pairwise: in no way are Latin ''e, ē'', say, reflected differently. In Proto-Western-Romance, the ancestor of French, Iberian, Italian north of the Spezia-Rimini line, etc., however, things happened differently: Latin /a ā/ merged totally, as in Sardo, but the other vowels all behaved differently. Upon losing the feature of length, Latin /ī ū/ merged with nothing, but the ''short'' high vowels, front and back, merged with the ''long mid'' vowels: thus, Latin /i ē/ are uniformly reflected as PWRom. *''ẹ'' (in the standard Romance notation), and /u ō/ become *''ọ''. PWRom. *''ẹ'' is reflected in French (in open syllables) as /wa/ (spelled ''oi''); ''voile'' "sail", ''foin'' "hay", ''doigt'' "finger", ''quoi'' "what", are from Latin ''vēlum, fēnum, digitus ''(via'' *dictu), quid'', respectively. There is no way of telling in French which one of the two Latin vowels is the source of any given /wa/.

Another example is provided by [[Japonic languages]]. [[Japonic languages|Proto-Japanese]] had 8 vowels; it has been reduced to 5 in modern [[Japanese language|Japanese]], but in [[Yaeyama language|Yaeyama]], the vowel mergers progressed further, to 3 vowels.

==Split==
In a split (Hoenigswald's "secondary split"), a '''new contrast''' arises when allophones of a phoneme cease being in complementary distribution and are therefore necessarily independent structure points, i.e. contrastive.
This mostly comes about because of some loss of distinctiveness in the environment of one or more allophones of a phoneme.

A simple example is the rise of the contrast between nasal and oral vowels in French. A full account of this history is complicated by the subsequent changes in the phonetics of the nasal vowels, but the development can be compendiously illustrated via the present-day French phonemes /a/ and /ã/:
*Step 1: *''a'' &gt; *''ã'' when a nasal immediately follows: *''čantu'' "song" &gt; {{IPA|[tʃãntu]}} (still phonemically {{IPA|/tʃantu/}});
*Step 2: at some point in the history of French when speakers consistently stopped making an oral closure with the tongue, we had {{IPA|[tʃãt]}}, that is {{IPA|/tʃãt/}} (if not {{IPA|/ʃãt/}}) and finally, with the loss of the final stop, modern French {{IPA|/ʃã/}} ''chant'' "song", distinct from French {{IPA|/ʃa/}} ''chat'' "cat" solely by the contrast between the nasal and the oral articulation of the vowels, and thus with many other forms in which /a/ and {{IPA|/ã/}} contrast.

::Note 1: the nasalization of a vowel before a nasal is found very widely in the world's languages, but is not at all universal. In modern French, for example, vowels before a nasal are oral. That they used to be nasalized, like the vowels before lost nasals, is indicated  by certain phonetic changes not always reflected in the orthography: Fr. ''femme'' "woman" /fam/ (with the lowering of {{IPA|[ɛ̃]}} (nasalized {{IPA|[ɛ]}}) to *''ã'' prior to denasalization).

::Note 2: unusually for a split, the history of the French innovation, even including some changes in vowel cavity features, can be readily inferred by [[internal reconstruction]]. This is because the contrastive feature [nasal] in a vowel system usually has a nasal in its history, which makes for straightforward surmises. There are also clear alternations, as {{IPA|/bɔ̃/}} "good" (masc.) vs. {{IPA|/bɔn/}} (fem.), while such pairs as /fin/ "fine" (fem.) and {{IPA|/fɛ̃/}} (masc.) together with derivatives like ''rafiné'' /rafine/ "refined" indicate what happened to nasalized *''i''.

Phonemic split was a major factor in the creation of the contrast between voiced and voiceless fricatives in English. Originally, to oversimplify a bit, Old English fricatives were voiced between voiced sounds and voiceless elsewhere. Thus /f/ was [f] in ''fisc'' {{IPA|[fiʃ]}} "fish", ''fyllen'' "to fill" [fyllen], ''hæft'' "prisoner", ''ofþyrsted'' [ofθyrsted] "athirst", ''líf'' "life", ''wulf'' "wolf". But in say the dative singular of "life", that is ''lífe'', the form was [li:ve] (as in English ''alive'', being an old prepositional phrase ''on lífe''); the plural of ''wulf, wulfas'', was [wulvas], as still seen in'' wolves''. The voiced fricative is typically seen in verbs, too (often with variations in vowel length of diverse sources): ''gift'' but ''give'', ''shelf'' but ''shelve''. Such alternations are to be seen even in loan words, as ''proof'' vs ''prove'' (though not as a rule in borrowed plurals, thus ''proofs, uses'', with voiceless fricatives).

:Note 1: unlike the French example, there is no chance of recovering the historical source of the alternations in English between /s θ f/ and /z ð v/ merely through inspection of the modern forms. The conditioning factor (original location of the voiced alternants between vowels, for example) is quite lost and with little reason to even suspect the original state of affairs; and anyway the original distributions have been much disturbed by analogical leveling. ''Worthy'' and (in some dialects) ''greasy'' have voiced fricative (next to the voiceless ones in ''worth'' and'' grease'') but adjectives in -''y'' otherwise do not alternate: ''bossy, glassy, leafy, earthy, breathy, saucy'', etc (cf. ''glaze, leaves, breathe'', and note that even in dialects with /z/ in'' greasy'', the verb ''to grease'' always has /s/).

:Note 2: the phoneme {{IPA|/ʃ/}} does not alternate with {{IPA|/ʒ/}} (and never did). In native words, {{IPA|/ʃ/}} is from *''sk'', and either the change of this sequence to {{IPA|/ʃ/}} postdated the rearranging of voicing in pre-Old English fricatives, or else it was phonetically long between vowels, originally, much like the {{IPA|/ʃ/}} of present-day Italian (''pesce'' "fish" is phonetically {{IPA|[peʃːe]}}) and long fricatives, just like sequences of fricatives, were always voiceless in Old English, as in ''cyssan'' "to kiss". The Early Modern English development of {{IPA|/ʃ/}} &lt; */sj/, as in ''nation, mission, assure'', vastly postdated the period when fricatives became voiced between vowels.

:Note 3: a common misstatement of cases like OE /f/ &gt; Modern English /f, v/ is that a "new phoneme" has been created. Not so. A new '''contrast''' has been created. '''Both''' NE /f/ '''and''' /v/ are '''new phonemes''', differing in phonetic specifications and distribution from OE /f/. Without doubt, one component in this misunderstanding is the orthography. If, instead of speaking of the development of Old English /f/ we said that OE {{IPA|/ɰ/}} split into /f/ and /v/, there would presumably be less confused talk of "a" new phoneme arising in the process.

==Loss==
In Hoenigwald's original scheme, loss, the disappearance of a segment, or even of a whole phoneme, was treated as a form of merger, depending on whether the loss was conditioned or unconditioned. The "element" that a vanished segment or phoneme merged with was "[[Zero (linguistics)|zero]]".

The situation in which a highly inflected language has formations without any affix at all (Latin ''alter'' "(the) other", for example) is quite common, but it is the only one (nominative singular masculine: ''altera'' nominative singular feminine, ''alterum'' accusative singular masculine, etc.) of the 30 forms that make up the paradigm that is not explicitly marked with endings for gender, number, and case.

From a historical perspective, there is no problem since ''alter'' is from *''alteros'' (overtly nominative singular and masculine), with the regular loss of the short vowel after *-''r''- and the truncation of the resulting word-final cluster *-''rs''. Descriptively, however, it is problematic to say that the "nominative singular masculine" is signaled by the absence of any affix. It is simpler to view ''alter'' as more than what it looks like, /alterØ/, "marked" for case, number, and gender by an affix, like the other 29 forms in the paradigm. It is merely that the "marker" in question is not a phoneme or sequence of phonemes but the element /Ø/.

Along the way, it is hard to know when to stop positing zeros and whether to regard one zero as different from another. For example, if the zero not-marking ''can'' (as in ''he can'') as "third person singular" is the same zero that not-marks ''deer'' as "plural", or if are both basically a single morphological placeholder. If it is determined that there is a zero on the end of ''deer'' in ''three deer'', it is uncertain whether English adjectives agree with the number of the noun they modify, using the same zero affix. (Deictics do so: compare ''this deer, these deer''.) In some theories of syntax it is useful to have an overt marker on a singular noun in a sentence such as ''My head hurts'' because the syntactic mechanism needs something explicit to generate the singular suffix on the verb. Thus, all English singular nouns may be marked with yet another zero.

It seems possible to avoid all those issues by considering loss as a separate basic category of phonological change, and leave zero out of it.

As stated above, one can regard loss as both a kind of conditioned merger (when only some expressions of a phoneme are lost) and a disappearance of a whole structure point. The former is much more common than the latter.

*In Latin are many consonant clusters that lose a member or two such as these: ''tostus'' "toasted, dried" &lt; *''torstos'', ''multrum'' "milking stool" &lt; *''molktrom'', ''scultus'' "carved" &lt; *''scolptos'', ''cēna'' "dinner" &lt; *''kertsnā'', ''lūna'' "moon" &lt; *''louwksnā'' ("lantern" or the like).
*Greek lost all stops from the end of a word (so *''kʷit'' "what" &gt; Greek ''ti'', *''deḱṃt'' "ten" &gt; ''déka'', *''wanakt'' "O prince" &gt;'' ána''), but stops generally survive elsewhere. PIE *''s'' drops medially between voiced sounds in Greek but is preserved in final position and in some consonant clusters.
*Old English [x] ([[voiceless velar fricative]]) is everywhere lost as such, but usually leaves traces behind ([[transphonologization]]). In ''furh'' "furrow" and ''mearh'' "marrow", it vocalizes. It is elided (with varying effects on the preceding vowel, such as lengthening) in ''night, knight, might, taught, naught, freight, fought, plow'' (Brit. plough, OE ''plōh''), ''bought, through, though, slaughter;'' but /f/ in ''laugh, trough, tough, enough'' (and ''daughter'' can be found in ''The Pilgrim's Progress'' rhyming with ''after'', and the spelling ''dafter'' is actually attested) The /x/ phoneme still exists in some onomatopoeiac words, like "ugh" (note the spelling uses ''gh'', which indicates that when they were coined, there was still some understanding of the phonemic meaning of ''gh''), "yech" and "chutzpah".
*/g k/ are lost in English in word-initial position before /n/: ''gnaw, gnat, knight, know''. /t/ is lost after fricatives before nasals and /l/: ''soften, castle, bristle, chestnut, Christmas, hasten''
*In many words, /f/ (that is, Old English [v]) was lost between vowels: ''auger, hawk, newt'' &lt; OE ''nafogar, hafoc, efete'' ("lizard"), and in some alternative (poetic) forms: ''e'en'' "evening", ''o'er'' "over", ''e'er'' "ever"; Scottish ''siller'' "silver", and others.

The ends of words often have sound laws that apply there only, and many such special developments consist of the loss of a segment. The early history and prehistory of English has seen several waves of loss of elements, vowels and consonants alike, from the ends of words, first in Proto-Germanic, then to Proto-West-Germanic, then to Old and Middle and Modern English, shedding bits from the ends of words at every step of the way. There is in Modern English next to nothing left of the elaborate inflectional and derivational apparatus of PIE or of Proto-Germanic because of the successive ablation of the phonemes making up these suffixes.

Total unconditional loss is, as mentioned, not very common. Latin /h/ appears to have been lost everywhere in all varieties of Proto-Romance except Romanian. Proto-Indo-European laryngeals survived as consonants only in [[Anatolian languages]] but left plenty of traces of their former presence (see [[laryngeal theory]]).

==Phonemic differentiation==
'''Phonemic differentiation''' is the phenomenon of a [[language]] maximizing the acoustic distance between its [[phoneme]]s.

=== Examples ===
For example, in many languages, including [[English language|English]], most [[front vowel]]s are [[roundedness|unrounded]], while most [[back vowel]]s are rounded. There are no languages in which all front vowels are rounded and all back vowels are unrounded. The most likely explanation for this{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} is that front vowels have a higher second [[formant]] (F2) than back vowels, and unrounded vowels have a higher F2 than rounded vowels. Thus unrounded front vowels and rounded back vowels have maximally different F2s, enhancing their phonemic differentiation.

Phonemic differentiation can have an effect on [[historical linguistics|diachronic]] [[sound change]]. In [[chain shift]]s, phonemic differentiation is maintained, while in phonemic mergers it is lost. Phonemic splits involve the creation of two phonemes out of one, which then tend to diverge because of phonemic differentiation.

===Chain shifts===
{{Main|Chain shift}}
In a [[chain shift]], one phoneme moves in acoustic space, causing other phonemes to move as well to maintain optimal phonemic differentiation. An example from [[American English]] is the [[Northern cities vowel shift]] [http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/ICSLP4/Figure_1.GIF], where the [[Phonological history of English short A#æ-tensing|raising of {{IPA|/æ/}}]] has triggered a fronting of {{IPA|/ɑ/}}, which in turn has triggered a lowering of {{IPA|/ɔ/}}, and so forth.

===Phonemic mergers===
If a phoneme moves in acoustic space, but its neighbors do not move in a chain shift, a ''phonemic merger'' may occur. In that case, a single phoneme results where an earlier stage of the language had two phonemes (that is also called ''phonetic neutralization''). A well known example of a phonemic merger in American English is the [[Phonological history of the low back vowels#Cot–caught merger|cot–caught merger]] by which the vowel phonemes &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;{{IPA|/ɑ/}}&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;{{IPA|/ɔ/}}&lt;/span&gt; (illustrated by the words ''cot'' and ''caught'' respectively) have merged into a single phoneme in some [[accent (dialect)|accents]].

===Phonemic splits===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Tone (linguistics)]] --&gt;
In a phonemic split, a phoneme at an earlier stage of the language is divided into two phonemes over time. Usually, it happens when a phoneme has two [[allophone]]s appearing in different environments, but [[sound change]] eliminates the distinction between the two environments. For example, in [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]] in the [[Germanic languages]], the [[back vowel]]s {{IPA|/u, o/}} originally had front rounded allophones {{IPA|[y, ø]}} before the vowel {{IPA|/i/}} in a following syllable. When sound change caused the syllables containing {{IPA|/i/}} to be lost, a phonemic split resulted, making {{IPA|/y, ø/}} distinct phonemes.

It is sometimes difficult to determine whether a split or a merger has happened if one dialect has two phonemes corresponding to a single phoneme in another dialect; [[historical linguistics|diachronic]] research is usually required to determine the dialect that is conservative and the one that is innovative.

When phonemic change occurs differently in the [[standard language]] and in dialects, the dialect pronunciation is considered nonstandard and may be stigmatized. In [[descriptive linguistics]], however, the question of which splits and mergers are prestigious and which are stigmatized is irrelevant. However, such stigmatization can lead to [[hypercorrection]], when the dialect speakers attempt to imitate the standard language but overshoot, as with the [[Phonological history of the high back vowels#Foot–strut split|foot–strut split]], where failing to make the split is stigmatized in Northern England, and speakers of non-splitting accents often try to introduce it into their speech, sometimes resulting in hypercorrections such as pronouncing ''pudding'' {{IPA|/pʌdɪŋ/}}.

Occasionally, speakers of one accent may believe the speakers of another accent to have undergone a merger, when there has really been a [[chain shift]].

'''Pierre Bayle''' ({{IPA-fr|bɛl|lang}}; 18 November 1647 – 28 December 1706)&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Bayle, Pierre |volume=3 |page=557}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a French philosopher and writer best known for his seminal work the ''[[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique|Historical and Critical Dictionary]]'',&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; publication beginning in 1697.

Bayle was a [[Calvinist]] [[Protestant]] ([[Huguenot]]). As a forerunner of the [[Encyclopedists]] and an advocate of the principle of the [[toleration]] his works subsequently influenced the development of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].

==Biography==
Bayle was born at [[Carla-le-Comte]]&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; (later renamed [[Carla-Bayle]] in his honour), near [[Pamiers]], [[Ariège (department)|Ariège]], France. He was educated by his father, a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] minister, and at an academy at [[Puylaurens]]. He afterwards entered a [[Jesuit]] college at [[Toulouse]], and became a Roman Catholic a month later (1669). After seventeen months, he returned to Calvinism and fled to [[Geneva]].

There he became acquainted with the teachings of [[René Descartes]]. He returned to France and went to Paris, where for some years he worked under the name of Bèle as a tutor for various families. In 1675 he was appointed to the chair of philosophy at the Protestant [[Academy of Sedan]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; In 1681 the university at [[Sedan, France|Sedan]] was suppressed by the government in action against Protestants.

Just before that event, Bayle had fled to the [[Dutch Republic]], where he almost immediately was appointed professor of philosophy and history at the École Illustre in [[Rotterdam]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; He taught for many years, but became embroiled in a long internal quarrel in the college. It resulted in Bayle being deprived of his chair in 1693.

Bayle remained in Rotterdam until his death on 28 December 1706.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; He was buried there in the ''Waalse Kerk,'' where [[Pierre Jurieu]] would also be buried, seven years later.

==Writings==
At Rotterdam, Bayle published his famous ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Reflections on Comets|fr}}'' in 1682, as well as his critique of [[Louis Maimbourg]]'s work on the history of Calvinism. The reputation achieved by this critique stirred the envy of [[Pierre Jurieu]], Bayle's Calvinist colleague of both Sedan and Rotterdam, who had written a book on the same subject.

Between 1684 and 1687, Bayle published his ''Nouvelles de la république des lettres'', a journal of [[literary criticism]]. In 1686, Bayle published the first two volumes of ''[[Philosophical Commentary]]'', an early plea for toleration in religious matters. This was followed by volumes three and four in 1687 and 1688.

In 1690 there appeared a work entitled ''[[Avis important aux refugies]]'', which Jurieu attributed to Bayle, whom he attacked with great animosity. After losing his chair, Bayle engaged in the preparation of his massive ''[[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique]]'' (''Historical and Critical Dictionary''), which effectively constituted one of the first [[encyclopaedia]]s (before the term had come into wide circulation) of ideas and their originators. In the ''Dictionary,'' Bayle expressed his view that much that was considered to be "truth" was actually just opinion, and that gullibility and stubbornness were prevalent. The ''Dictionary'' would remain an important scholarly work for several generations after its publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A History of the Modern World|last=Palmer |first=R.R. |authorlink=Robert Roswell Palmer |author2=Joel Colton |year= 1995|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location= New York|isbn=0-07-040826-2 |pages=301–302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining years of Bayle's life were devoted to miscellaneous writings. In many cases, he was responding to criticisms made of his ''Dictionary''.

[[Voltaire]], in the prelude to his ''[[Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne]]'' calls Bayle "''le plus grand dialecticien qui ait jamais écrit''": the greatest [[dialectician]] to have ever written.

The ''Nouvelles de la république des lettres'' was the first thorough-going attempt to popularise literature, and it was eminently successful. His multi-volume ''Historical and Critical Dictionary'' constitutes Bayle's masterpiece. The English translation of ''The Dictionary'', by Bayle's fellow Huguenot exile [[Pierre des Maizeaux]], was identified by American President [[Thomas Jefferson]] to be among the one hundred foundational texts to form the first collection of the [[Library of Congress]].

===Views on toleration===
Bayle advanced arguments for [[religious toleration]] in his ''Dictionnaire historique and critique'' and ''Commentaire Philosophique,''. Bayle rejected the use of scripture to justify coercion and violence: "One must transcribe almost the whole New Testament to collect all the Proofs it affords us of that Gentleness and Long-suffering, which constitute the distinguishing and essential Character of the Gospel." He did not regard toleration as a danger to the state; on the contrary: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If the Multiplicity of Religions prejudices the State, it proceeds from their not bearing with one another but on the contrary endeavouring each to crush and destroy the other by methods of Persecution. In a word, all the Mischief arises not from Toleration, but from the want of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/thepastinthepresent/historymatters/goldenrule.html |first=Joseph |last=LoConte |title=The Golden Rule of Toleration |publisher=Christianity Today |date=May 2009 |accessdate=2017-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bayle also rejected the use of coercion and violence in the universities, &lt;blockquote&gt;It will be an everlasting subject of wonder to persons who know what philosophy is, to find that Aristotle's authority had been so much respected in the schools for several ages, that when a disputant quoted a passage from that philosopher, he who maintained the thesis, durst not say “Transeat," but must either deny the passage, or explain it in his own way—just as we treat the Holy Scriptures in the divinity schools. The parliaments, which have proscribed all other philosophy but that of Aristotle, are more excusable than the doctors; for whether the members of the parliament were really persuaded that that philosophy was the best of any, or whether they were not, the public good might have induced them to prohibit the new opinions, for fear the academical divisions should spread their malignant influences on the tranquility of the state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_qCbdP5xBEdYC ''Aristotle p. 155-158 from Bayle's dictionary volume 1'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Skepticism===
[[Richard Popkin]] has advanced the view that Pierre Bayle was a [[Philosophical skepticism|skeptic]] who used the ''[[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique|Historical and Critical Dictionary]]'' to criticise all prior known theories and philosophies. In Bayle's view, humans were inherently incapable of achieving true knowledge. Because of the limitations of human reason, men should adhere instead to their conscience alone. Bayle was critical of many influential rationalists, such as [[René Descartes]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Nicolas Malebranche]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]].&lt;ref name="popkin288"&gt;{{cite book |title= The History of Skepticism|last=Popkin |first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Popkin|year= 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location= New York|isbn=0-19-510767-5 |page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Railway Pay Cheques''' were metallic tokens or tallies used to ensure appropriate payment to the correctly identified railway employee.

==Usage==
The one-sided identification cheques were usually drawn from the wages office on a Thursday, prior to the Friday payday. The cheques would then be exchanged for a pay slip, and the wages paid on signature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportingcollectibles.com/railroadiana.html Railroadiana] Retrieved : 2010-10-25&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases where pay cheques were in use they were often issued to each employee at the start of his employment and retained for the rest of the person's working life with the company.&lt;ref name="Mining Memorabilia"&gt;[http://www.mining-memorabilia.co.uk/PitchecksanIntroduction.htm Mining Memorabilia] Retrieved : 2010-10-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Specialised trays were used for storing these cheques.&lt;ref name="Railway Auctions"&gt;[http://www.railway-auctions.co.uk/CATALOGUES/nov06.htm Railway Auctions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122160845/http://www.railway-auctions.co.uk/CATALOGUES/nov06.htm |date=2010-01-22 }} Retrieved : 2010-10-24&lt;/ref&gt; Stores, maintenance and other departments used this 'pay cheque' system. British Railways examples exist, however it is not at present recorded when their use ceased.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gloucesterrailwayana.com/paycheck.php Railwayana] Retrieved : 2010-10-25&lt;/ref&gt;

Other occupations used the pay cheque system, such as the mining industry.&lt;ref name="Mining Memorabilia"/&gt;

===Pay checks and checks or tallies===
[[File:Tally piece.JPG|left|thumb|200px|A tally piece or pay cheque.]]
These had a slightly different use, being more of a system for ensuring the correct pay by 'checking' in and out of the workplace prior to machines being produced for this specific purpose. 'Checks' were often 'holed' for hanging on boards. In mining, for example, a number on the check was personal to each miner and prior to going down the pit, the miner would give one of his tallies to the pit head "banksman", keeping the duplicate for the duration of the shift. Upon returning to the surface, the miner gave his personal tally to the banksman who would pass it on to the time office or the lamp room. This system made it possible to keep track on workers' whereabouts in the mine complex and for what periods they were working.&lt;ref name="d.lane.btinternet.co.uk"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060924230908/http://www.d.lane.btinternet.co.uk/pitcheck.htm Collecting Pit checks or mine tally's] Retrieved : 2010-10-25&lt;/ref&gt;

Pay checks and tallies were only marked on one side and were produced in a great variety of shapes, sizes and designs; made typically of brass or zinc, sometimes steel or aluminium.&lt;ref name="d.lane.btinternet.co.uk"/&gt;

[[File:Screenplay example.svg|right|thumb|250px|Sample from a screenplay, showing dialogue and action descriptions]]
A '''screenplay''', or '''script''', is a written work by [[screenwriter]]s for a [[film]], [[television show|television program]] or [[video game]]. These screenplays can be [[Originality|original works]] or [[Film adaptation|adaptations]] from existing pieces of writing. In them, the movement, actions, expression and dialogues of the characters are also narrated. A screenplay written for television is also known as a [[teleplay]].

== Format and style ==
The format is structured so that one page equates to roughly one minute of screen time, though this is only used as a ballpark estimate and often bears little resemblance to the running time of the final movie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://johnaugust.com/2006/how-accurate-is-the-page-per-minute-rule JohnAugust.com "How accurate is the page-per-minute rule?]&lt;/ref&gt; The standard font is 12 point, 10 pitch [[Courier (typeface)|Courier]] Typeface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://johnaugust.com/2007/hollywood-standard JohnAugust.com "Hollywood Standard Formatting"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The major components are action (sometimes called "screen direction") and [[dialogue]]. The action is written in the [[present tense]] and is limited to what can be heard or seen by the audience, for example descriptions of settings, character movements, or sound effects. The dialogue is the words the characters speak, and is written in a center column.

Unique to the screenplay (as opposed to a stage play) is the use of slug lines. A ''slug line'', also called a ''master scene heading'', occurs at the start of every scene and typically contains three pieces of information: whether the scene is set inside (interior/INT.) or outside (exterior/EXT.), the specific location, and the time of day. Each slug line begins a new scene. In a "[[shooting script]]" the slug lines are numbered consecutively for ease of reference.

===Physical format===
American screenplays are printed single-sided on three-hole-punched paper using the standard American [[paper size|letter size]] (8.5 x 11&amp;nbsp;inch). They are then held together with two [[Brass fastener|brass brads]] in the top and bottom hole. The middle hole is left empty as it would otherwise make it harder to quickly read the script.

In the United Kingdom, double-hole-punched [[A4 paper size|A4]] paper is normally used, which is slightly taller and narrower than US letter size. Some UK writers format the scripts for use in the US letter size, especially when their scripts are to be read by American producers, since the pages would otherwise be cropped when printed on US paper. Because each country's standard paper size is difficult to obtain in the other country, British writers often send an electronic copy to American producers, or crop the A4 size to US letter.

A British script may be bound by a single brad at the top left hand side of the page, making flicking through the paper easier during script meetings. Screenplays are usually bound with a light card stock cover and back page, often showing the logo of the production company or agency submitting the script, covers are there to protect the script during handling which can reduce the strength of the paper. This is especially important if the script is likely to pass through the hands of several people or through the post.

Increasingly, ''reading copies'' of screenplays (that is, those distributed by producers and agencies in the hope of attracting finance or talent) are distributed printed on both sides of the paper (often professionally bound) to reduce paper waste. Occasionally they are reduced to half-size to make a small book which is convenient to read or put in a pocket; this is generally for use by the director or production crew during shooting.

Although most writing contracts continue to stipulate physical delivery of three or more copies of a finished script, it is common for scripts to be delivered electronically via email.

== Screenplay formats ==
Screenplays and teleplays use a set of standardizations, beginning with proper formatting. These rules are in part to serve the practical purpose of making scripts uniformly readable "blueprints" of movies, and also to serve as a way of distinguishing a professional from an amateur.

===Feature film===
[[File:The Godfather Screenplay.JPG|thumb|Screenplay for ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', Turin, Italy]]
Motion picture screenplays intended for submission to mainstream studios, whether in the US or elsewhere in the world, are expected to conform to a standard [[typographical]] style known widely as the ''studio format'' which stipulates how elements of the screenplay such as scene headings, action, transitions, dialog, character names, shots and parenthetical matter should be presented on the page, as well as font size and line spacing.

One reason for this is that, when rendered in studio format, most screenplays will transfer onto the screen at the rate of approximately one page per minute. This rule of thumb is widely contested &amp;mdash; a page of dialogue usually occupies less screen time than a page of action, for example, and it depends enormously on the literary style of the writer &amp;mdash; and yet it continues to hold sway in modern [[Hollywood]].

There is no single standard for studio format. Some studios have definitions of the required format written into the rubric of their writer's contract. The [[Nicholl Fellowship]], a screenwriting competition run under the auspices of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], has a guide to screenplay format.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080822084909/http://www.oscars.org/nicholl/format.html Guide to screenplay format] from the website of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences&lt;/ref&gt; A more detailed reference is ''The Complete Guide to Standard Script Formats''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Guide to Standard Script Formats'' (2002) Cole and Haag, SCB Distributors, {{ISBN|0-929583-00-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Spec screenplay ====
A "[[spec script]]" or speculative screenplay is a script written to be sold on the open market with no upfront payment, or promise of payment. The content is usually invented solely by the screenwriter, though spec screenplays can also be based on established works, or real people and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://actfourscreenplays.com/glossary/spec-script/|title=Spec Script|publisher=Act Four Screenplays|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
For American TV shows, the format rules for hour-long dramas and [[Single-camera setup|single-camera]] sitcoms are essentially the same as for motion pictures. The main difference is that TV scripts have act breaks.  [[Multiple-camera setup|Multi-camera]] sitcoms use a different, specialized format that derives from stage plays and radio. In this format, dialogue is double-spaced, action lines are capitalized, and scene headings, character entrances and exits, and sound effects are capitalized and underlined.

Drama series and sitcoms are no longer the only formats that require the skills of a writer. With reality-based programming crossing genres to create various hybrid programs, many of the so-called "reality" programs are in a large part scripted in format. That is, the overall skeleton of the show and its episodes are written to dictate the content and direction of the program. The Writers Guild of America has identified this as a legitimate writer's medium, so much so that they have lobbied to impose jurisdiction over writers and producers who "format" reality-based productions. Creating reality show formats involves storytelling structure similar to screenwriting, but much more condensed and boiled down to specific plot points or actions related to the overall concept and story.

===Documentaries===
The script format for documentaries and audio-visual presentations which consist largely of voice-over matched to still or moving pictures is different again and uses a two-column format which can be particularly difficult to achieve in standard word processors, at least when it comes to editing or rewriting. Many script-editing software programs include templates for documentary formats.

== Screenwriting software ==
{{Main article|Screenwriting software}}
Various [[screenwriting software]] packages are available to help screenwriters adhere to the strict formatting conventions. Detailed computer programs are designed specifically to format screenplays, teleplays, and stage plays. Such packages include BPC-Screenplay, [[Celtx]], [[Fade In (software)|Fade In]], [[Final Draft (software)|Final Draft]], [[FiveSprockets]], [[Montage (software)|Montage]], [[Movie Magic Screenwriter]], [[Movie Outline]] 3.0, [[Scrivener (software)|Scrivener]], Movie Draft SE and [[Zhura]]. Software is also available as [[web applications]], accessible from any computer, and on [[mobile devices]], such as Fade In Mobile and Scripts Pro.

The first screenwriting software was [[SmartKey]], a macro program that sent strings of commands to existing word processing programs, such as [[WordStar]], [[WordPerfect]] and [[Microsoft Word]]. SmartKey was popular with screenwriters from 1982 to 1987, after which word processing programs had their own macro features.

== Script coverage ==
{{Main article|Script coverage}}
''Script coverage'' is a filmmaking term for the analysis and grading of screenplays, often within the script-development department of a production company. While coverage may remain entirely verbal, it usually takes the form of a written report, guided by a rubric that varies from company to company. The original idea behind coverage was that a producer's assistant could read a script and then give their producer a breakdown of the project and suggest whether they should consider producing the screenplay or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Script Coverage?|url=https://www.wescreenplay.com/blog/post/what-is-script-coverage|website=WeScreenplay|accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ about|the Wisconsin mansion|the 1965 song|Summer Wind}}

'''Summerwind''', formerly known as '''Lamont Mansion''', is a ruined [[mansion]] on the shores of West Bay Lake in [[Vilas County, Wisconsin|Vilas County]], [[Wisconsin]]. Located on private land, its ruins are closed to the public. A number of [[urban legends]] and [[ghost story|ghost stories]] in [[popular culture]] have contributed to its reputation as a [[haunted house]].&lt;ref name="Milwaukee Journal"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=Beth|last2=Norman|first2=Michael|title=Ghosts had a favorite haunt|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19851021&amp;id=Y24aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VioEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7137,598546|accessdate=24 October 2014|work=Excerpts from "Haunted Heartland"|publisher=Milwaukee Journal|date=October 21, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legends ==
According to popular accounts, Summerwind was built in the early 20th century as a fishing lodge on the edge of West Bay Lake in [[Vilas County, Wisconsin|Vilas County]], in northeastern [[Wisconsin]], and in 1916, purchased by [[Robert P. Lamont|Robert Patterson Lamont]]. According to some stories circulated, Lamont employed Chicago architects for the remodeling. Some versions of the story name the architects as [[Thomas Tallmadge|Tallmadge and Watson]]. Supposedly the renovations took two years to complete.&lt;ref name="QCT2"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''[[Quad-City Times]]''|title=Summerwind: More ghostly than ever |first=Bill|last=Wundram|date=October 29, 1995|url=http://qctimes.com/news/opinion/editorial/columnists/bill-wundram/summerwind-more-ghostly-than-ever/article_15955edb-9e1e-5fa2-9e9d-4d07361011df.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HP1"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''[[Huffington Post]]''|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/corey-schjoth/haunted-travel-wisconsins_b_5021201.html|title=Haunted Travel: Wisconsin's Most Notorious Haunted House |first=Corey|last=Schjoth|date=March 25, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legends include claims that Lamont fired a pistol at a [[ghost]] one night and was so frightened that he and his family abandoned the house. Other legends include claims that subsequent owners Arnold and Ginger Hinshaw were so disturbed by hauntings that Arnold suffered a "nervous breakdown" and Ginger attempted suicide.&lt;ref name="Milwaukee Journal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="QCT1"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''[[Quad-City Times]]''|url=http://qctimes.com/news/opinion/editorial/columnists/bill-wundram/haunted-house-keeps-visitors-wondering/article_0434804e-eccb-51b1-8a18-cc3b71d20b7b.html|title=Haunted house keeps visitors wondering|first=Bill|last=Wundram|date=October 28, 2007|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WCT"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''[[Wisconsin Trails]]'' / ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]''|url=http://www.wisconsintrails.com/travel/Wisconsins-10-most-haunted-places-228389291.html|title=Travel – Wisconsin's 10 most haunted places|first=Chad|last=Lewis|date=2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SW1&gt;{{cite book  | last =Godfrey | first =Linda S. | title =Strange Wisconsin: More Badger State Weirdness| publisher =Big Earth Publishing | year =2007 | page = 59 | isbn =978-1-931599-85-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jRBPbFHCoV4C&amp;pg=PA59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Raymond Bober ==
Although most Land O' Lakes natives refer to the property as Lamont's mansion, supernatural tales first disseminated by Ginger Hinshaw's father Raymond Bober claim the mansion was haunted and refer to it as "Summerwind".&lt;ref name="Lightning" /&gt; Some versions of the story claim that Bober purchased the property only to abandon it because the mansion's rooms had the supernatural power to change shape and dimensions at will. In 1979, Bober (writing under the [[pen name]] "Wolfgang Von Bober"), authored a book called ''The Carver Effect: A Paranormal Experience'' in which he claimed the mansion was haunted by 18th century explorer [[Jonathan Carver]].&lt;ref name="Milwaukee Journal" /&gt;&lt;ref name=boberbook&gt;{{cite book |last=Von Bober |first=Wolffgang |title=''The Carver Effect: A Paranormal Experience'' |publisher=Stackpole Books |year=1979 |isbn=0-8117-0329-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bober's narrative, the property was often unoccupied due to alleged [[supernatural]] activity and the Hinshaws could not get workers to enter the home to do remodeling work.&lt;ref name=101wismist&gt;{{cite book |last=Balousek |first=Marv |title=101 Wisconsin Unsolved Mysteries |publisher=Badger Books |date=2000-11-15 |isbn=1-878569-70-8|page= 17-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However according to one of Bober's neighbors, Bober did not live in the mansion, never spent the night in it and instead lived in a trailer on the property. At least two previous residents reportedly denied claims that the house was haunted and locals claimed the haunting stories did not begin until Bober's book was published.&lt;ref name="Razed" /&gt; A 1980 Life magazine photo essay including Summerwind among "Terrifying Tales of Nine Haunted Houses" apparently spread the supernatural tales originated in Bober's book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Terrifying Tales of Nine Haunted Houses |first= Henry (Photographer) |last= Groskinsky |journal= Life Magazine |date= November 1980 |page= 152}} [http://theweirdusmessageboard.yuku.com/topic/2474/Life-Magazine-Haunted-House-Article-November-1980]&lt;/ref&gt;  According to author Marv Balousek, locals never believed the home was haunted and were dismayed when the home became somewhat of a supernatural [[tourist attraction]].&lt;ref name=101wismist /&gt;

== Fire ==
In 1985, officials for the Town of [[Land O' Lakes, Wisconsin|Land O' Lakes]] made an attempt to demolish the vacant home. The Vilas County Sheriff said it was a staging area for local teens who burglarized or vandalized nearby cottages.&lt;ref name="Razed" /&gt; This attempt failed, but the abandoned mansion was later destroyed by fire following a lightning strike on June 19, 1988. Later that week, fire officials reported that the fire was not suspicious and arson was not suspected since neighbors reported being awakened when lightning struck the vacant home. However, fire officials also said that teenagers frequently used the location for parties and that they may have left a fire burning.&lt;ref name="Lightning" /&gt;

== Potential restoration ==
In 2014, owners Harold and Babs Tracy and the Fox Valley Ghost Hunters sought funding to rebuild the mansion as a [[bed and breakfast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/ghost-fans-hope-to-rebuild-mansion--haunting-and-all-b99381544z1-281025652.html |title= Ghost fans hope to rebuild mansion — haunting and all |first= Jim |last= Stingl |newspaper= Milwaukee Journal |location= [[Milwaukee]], Wisconsin |date= 30 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.vilascountynewsreview.com/lifestyle/group-looking-rebuild-summerwind-sets-benefit |title= Group looking to rebuild Summerwind sets benefit |newspaper= Vilas County News-Review |date= 30 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wjfw.com/stories.html?sku=20141028184624&amp;display=video |title= Paranormal group speaking on historic Summerwind mansion |first= Hayley |last= Tenpas |website= WJFW TV-12 |location= [[Rhinelander, Wisconsin]] |date= 28 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2005, Summerwind was featured on a [[Discovery Channel]] episode of ''[[A Haunting]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Haunting of Summerwind|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/a-haunting/the-haunting-of-summerwind-869201/|website=A Haunting Season 1 Episode 2|publisher=tv.com|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2955">The '''Taught Course Centre''' or '''TCC''' is a collaboration between the [[mathematics]] departments at five UK [[universities]] aimed at providing a broader range of lecture courses for postgraduate students.

==Members==

The five collaborating universities are:
*[[University of Bath]]
*[[University of Bristol]]
*[[Imperial College London]]
*[[University of Oxford]]
*[[University of Warwick]]

Lectures are given at all five universities and, using [[Access Grid]] technology, students at each of the other four institutes may participate with each lecture.

The TCC was set up in 2007 with funding from the [[EPSRC]].  Twenty six courses were made available to students in the first year of the collaboration, with topics from diverse areas of mathematics including [[number theory]], [[partial differential equations]], [[random matrix theory]], and [[group theory]].  One of the aims of the project was to encourage contact between postgraduate mathematics students at the five universities and set up future collaborative work.

==Configuration==
In normal operation, the TCC uses [[Access Grid|access grid]] technology for video conferencing using the proprietary [[IOCOM]] software suite.  The lectures take place in the [[Virtual Venue Server|virtual venue]] named ''Maths TCC''.  These lectures may be recorded upon request if permission from participants is obtained in advance.

TCC lectures normally transmit video streams using [[H.261]] and audio as [[G.711]] for compatibility with the freely available AG3 software.

Each Access Grid session is paired with a [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|Jabber/XMPP]] session on the Access Grid Support Centre (AGSC) [[Virtual Venue Server]]. The XMPP session allows instant messaging with other participants allowing fault diagnosis or communication without interrupting a session.

===Oxford===
The Oxford TCC is equipped with a [[Smart Board]] and [[Smart Technologies|Sympodium]] that can be viewed locally and transmitted to all participants of the meeting.

==Events==
* January 21, 2008 
: TCC Number Theory Event Day was held at Bristol and students were given a chance to talk about their research to their peers and share ideas.

* May 21, 2013 
: Graduate TCC Conference in Number Theory was a successful continuation of the aforementioned event.

{{Literature}}
'''Tragedy''' (from the {{lang-grc-gre|[[wiktionary:τραγῳδία|τραγῳδία]]}}, ''tragōidia''{{Refn | group = "lower-alpha" | [[Middle English]] ''tragedie'' &lt; [[Middle French]] ''tragedie'' &lt; [[Latin]] ''tragoedia'' &lt; {{lang-grc|[[wiktionary:τραγῳδία|τραγῳδία]]}}, ''tragōidia''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Tragedy | page = 1637 | first = E | last = Klein | title = A Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the English Language | volume = II L–Z | publisher = Elsevier | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;}})  is a form of [[drama]] based on human [[suffering]] that invokes an accompanying [[catharsis]] or pleasure in audiences.{{Sfn | Banham | 1998 | p = 1118}}{{Sfn | Nietzsche | 1999 | p = 21 | loc = §2 | ps =: ‘two-fold mood[…] the strange mixture and duality in the affects of the [[Dionysus|Dionysiac]] [[Cult of Dionysus|enthusiasts]], that phenomenon whereby pain awakens pleasure while rejoicing wrings cries of agony from the breast.  From highest joy there comes a cry of horror or a yearning lament at some irredeemable loss.  In those Greek festivals there erupts what one might call a [[Sentimentality|sentimental]] tendency in nature, as if it had cause to sigh over its [[Sparagmos|dismemberment]] into [[Individuation|individuals]]’.}}  While many [[culture]]s have developed forms that provoke this [[paradox]]ical response, the term ''tragedy'' often refers to a specific [[Poetic tradition|tradition]] of drama that has played a unique and important role historically in the self-definition of [[Western culture|Western civilisation]].{{Sfn | Banham | 1998 | p = 1118}}{{Sfn | Williams | 1966 | pp = 14–16}}  That tradition has been multiple and discontinuous, yet the term has often been used to invoke a powerful effect of [[cultural identity]] and historical continuity—"the [[Classical Athens|Greeks]] and the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethans]], in one cultural form; [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenes]] and [[Christian]]s, in a common activity," as [[Raymond Williams]] puts it.{{Sfn | Williams | 1966 | p = 16}}

From its origins in the [[theatre of ancient Greece]] 2500 years ago, from which there survives only a fraction of the work of [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], as well as a large number of fragments from other poets; through its singular articulations in the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[Jean Racine]], and [[Friedrich Schiller]] to the more recent [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] tragedy of [[August Strindberg]]; [[Samuel Beckett]]'s [[Modernism|modernist]] meditations on death, loss and suffering; [[Heiner Müller|Müller's]] [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] reworkings of the tragic canon; and [[Joshua Oppenheimer]]'s incorporation of tragic pathos in his nonfiction film, ''[[The Act of Killing]]'' (2012), tragedy has remained an important site of cultural experimentation, negotiation, struggle, and change.{{Sfn | Williams | 1966 | pp = 13–84}}{{Sfn | Taxidou | 2004 | pp = 193–209}}  A long line of [[philosophers]]—which includes [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]], [[Voltaire]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin]],{{Sfn | Benjamin | 1998}} [[Albert Camus|Camus]], [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], and [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze]]{{Sfn | Deleuze | Guattari | 1972}}—have analysed, speculated upon, and criticised the genre.{{Sfn | Felski | 2008 | p = 1}}{{Sfn | Dukore | 1974 | ps =: primary material.}}{{Sfn | Carlson | 1993 | ps =: analysis.}}

In the wake of Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (335 BCE), tragedy has been used to make [[genre]] distinctions, whether at the scale of [[poetry]] in general (where the tragic divides against [[Epic poetry|epic]] and [[Lyric poetry|lyric]]) or at the scale of the drama (where tragedy is opposed to [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]]). In the [[Modernity|modern]] era, tragedy has also been defined against drama, [[melodrama]], [[Tragicomedy|the tragicomic]], and [[epic theatre]].{{Sfn | Carlson | 1993 | ps =: analysis.}}{{Sfn | Pfister | 1977}}{{Sfn | Elam | 1980}}  [[Drama]], in the narrow sense, cuts across the traditional division between comedy and tragedy in an anti- or a-[[Genre|generic]] [[deterritorialization|deterritorialisation]] from the [[Nineteenth century theatre|mid-19th century]] onwards. Both [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Augusto Boal]] define their [[epic theatre]] projects ([[non-Aristotelian drama]] and [[Theatre of the Oppressed]], respectively) against models of tragedy. Taxidou, however, reads epic theatre as an incorporation of tragic functions and its treatments of mourning and speculation.{{Sfn | Taxidou | 2004 | pp = 193–209}}

[[File:Aristotle's Tragic Plot Structure.pdf|thumb|Aristotle's Tragic Plot Structure]]
The word "tragedy" appears to have been used to describe different phenomena at different times. It derives from [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] {{lang |grc|τραγῳδία}}, [[sandhi|contracted]] from ''trag(o)-aoidiā'' = "[[goat]] [[Ode|song]]", which comes from ''tragos'' = "he-goat" and ''aeidein'' = "to sing" (''[[cf.]]'' "ode"). Scholars suspect this may be traced to a time when a goat was either the prize&lt;ref&gt;See [[Horace]], ''Epistulae'', II, 3, 220: "Carmino qui tragico vilem certavit ob hircum".&lt;/ref&gt; in a competition of [[Greek dances|choral dancing]] or was that around which a [[Greek chorus|chorus]] danced prior to the animal's [[ritual]] [[Animal sacrifice|sacrifice]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 13}}  In another view on the etymology, [[Athenaeus|Athenaeus of Naucratis]] (2nd–3rd century CE) says that the original form of the word was ''trygodia'' from ''trygos'' (grape harvest) and ''ode'' (song), because those events were first introduced during grape harvest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Literature/Literature-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=Literature.AthV1.p0071&amp;id=Literature.AthV1&amp;isize=M&amp;pview=hide%20 | first = Athenaeus | last = of Naucratis | title = The deipnosophists | publisher = Wisc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 335 BCE (long after the [[Age of Pericles|Golden Age]] of [[Classical Greece|5th-century]] [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] tragedy), [[Aristotle]] provides the earliest-surviving explanation for the origin of the [[drama]]tic [[The arts|art form]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', in which he argues that tragedy developed from the [[improvisation]]s of the leader of [[Greek chorus|choral]] [[dithyramb]]s ([[hymn]]s sung and danced in praise of [[Dionysos]], the god of wine and fertility):{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 13}}
{{Quote |Anyway, arising from an improvisatory beginning (both tragedy and comedy—tragedy from the leaders of the dithyramb, and comedy from the leaders of the phallic processions which even now continue as a custom in many of our cities), [tragedy] grew little by little, as [the poets] developed whatever [new part] of it had appeared; and, passing through many changes, tragedy came to a halt, since it had attained its own nature. | Poetics IV, 1449a 10–15{{Sfn | Janko | 1987 | p = 6}}}}

In the same work, Aristotle attempts to provide a scholastic definition of what tragedy is:
{{Quote |Tragedy is, then, an enactment of a deed that is important and complete, and of [a certain] magnitude, by means of language enriched [with ornaments], each used separately in the different parts [of the play]: it is enacted, not [merely] recited, and through pity and fear it effects relief ([[catharsis]]) to such [and similar] emotions. | Poetics, VI 1449b 2–3&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Aristotle, Poetics, section 1449b | publisher = Tufts | url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0056%3Asection%3D1449b}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is some dissent to the dithyrambic origins of tragedy, mostly based on the differences between the shapes of their choruses and styles of dancing.{{Citation needed|date= June 2012}} A common descent from pre-[[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] fertility and burial rites has been suggested.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] discussed the origins of Greek tragedy in his early book ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' (1872). Here, he suggests the name originates in the use of a chorus of goat-like [[satyr]]s in the original [[dithyramb]]s from which the tragic genre developed.

Scott Scullion writes:  {{quote|There is abundant evidence for tragoidia understood as "song for the prize goat". The best-known evidence is Horace, Ars poetica 220-24 ("he who with a tragic song competed for a mere goat"); the earliest is the Parian Marble, a chronicle inscribed about 264/63 BCE, which records, under a date between 538 and 528 BCE: "Thespis is the poet ... first produced ... and as prize was established the billy goat" (FrGHist 239A, epoch 43); the clearest is Eustathius 1769.45: "They called those competing tragedians, clearly because of the song over the billy goat"...&lt;ref&gt;Scott Scullion: "Tragedy and Religion: The Problem of Origins", in Gregory (ed.), A Companion to Greek Tragedy, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AdTuNrx6z4oC&amp;q=%22There+is+abundant+ancient+evidence%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22There%20is%20abundant%20ancient%20evidence%22&amp;f=false p. 29]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Athenian tragedies were performed in late March/early April at an annual state religious festival in honor of Dionysus. The presentations took the form of a contest between three playwrights, who presented their works on three successive days. Each playwright offered a tetralogy consisting of three tragedies and a concluding comic piece called a [[satyr play]].{{sfn|Lucas|1954|p=7}} The four plays sometimes featured linked stories. Only one complete trilogy of tragedies has survived, the ''[[Oresteia]]'' of Aeschylus. The Greek theatre was in the open air, on the side of a hill, and performances of a trilogy and satyr play probably lasted most of the day. Performances were apparently open to all citizens, including women, but evidence is scant.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} The theatre of Dionysus at Athens probably held around 12,000 people.{{Sfn | Ley | 2007 | p = 33–34}}

All of the choral parts were sung (to the accompaniment of an ''[[aulos]]'') and some of the actors' answers to the chorus were sung as well. The play as a whole was composed in various verse metres. All actors were male and wore masks. A [[Greek chorus]] danced as well as sang, though no one knows exactly what sorts of steps the chorus performed as it sang. Choral songs in tragedy are often divided into three sections: strophe ("turning, circling"), antistrophe ("counter-turning, counter-circling") and epode ("after-song").

Many ancient Greek tragedians employed the ''[[Ekkyklema|ekkyklêma]]'' as a theatrical device, which was a platform hidden behind the scene that could be rolled out to display the aftermath of some event which had happened out of sight of the audience. This event was frequently a brutal murder of some sort, an act of violence which could not be effectively portrayed visually, but an action of which the other characters must see the effects in order for it to have meaning and emotional resonance. A prime example of the use of the ''ekkyklêma'' is after the murder of [[Agamemnon (play)|Agamemnon]] in the first play of Aeschylus' ''Oresteia'', when the king's butchered body is wheeled out in a grand display for all to see. Variations on the ''ekkyklêma'' are used in tragedies and other forms to this day, as writers still find it a useful and often powerful device for showing the consequences of extreme human actions. Another such device was a crane, the [[mechane]], which served to hoist a god or goddess on stage when they were supposed to arrive flying. This device gave origin to the phrase "[[deus ex machina]]" ("god out of a machine"), that is, the surprise intervention of an unforeseen external factor that changes the outcome of an event.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

From the time of the empire, the tragedies of two playwrights survive—one is an unknown author, while the other is the [[Stoicism|Stoic philosopher]] [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 50}}  Nine of [[Senecan tragedy|Seneca's tragedies]] survive, all of which are ''fabula crepidata'' (tragedies adapted from Greek originals); his ''[[Phaedra (Seneca)|Phaedra]]'', for example, was based on [[Euripides]]' ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]''.{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 49–50}}  Historians do not know who wrote the only [[Extant literature|extant]] example of the ''fabula praetexta'' (tragedies based on Roman subjects), ''[[Octavia (play)|Octavia]]'', but in former times it was mistakenly attributed to Seneca due to his appearance as a [[Character (arts)|character]] in the tragedy.{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 50}}

Seneca's tragedies rework those of all three of the Athenian tragic playwrights whose work has survived. Probably meant to be recited at [[elite]] gatherings, they differ from the Greek versions in their long declamatory, narrative accounts of action, their obtrusive moralising, and their bombastic rhetoric. They dwell on detailed accounts of horrible deeds and contain long reflective [[soliloquies]]. Though the gods rarely appear in these plays, ghosts and witches abound. Senecan tragedies explore ideas of [[Revenge tragedy|revenge]], the occult, the supernatural, suicide, blood and gore. The Renaissance scholar [[Julius Caesar Scaliger]] (1484–1558), who knew both Latin and Greek, preferred Seneca to Euripides.

==Renaissance==
===Influence of Greek and Roman===
Classical Greek drama was largely forgotten in Western Europe from the Middle Ages to the beginning of the 16th century. [[Medieval theatre]] was dominated by [[mystery play]]s, [[morality play]]s, [[farce]]s and [[miracle play]]s. In Italy, the models for tragedy in the later Middle Ages were Roman, particularly the works of Seneca, interest in which was reawakened by the [[Padua]]n [[Lovato Lovati|Lovato de' Lovati]] (1241–1309).&lt;ref name=lovati&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/lovato-de-lovati/ "Lovati, Lovato de'"], ''Treccani: Enciclopedie on line'' (in Italian). Accessed March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; His pupil [[Albertino Mussato]] (1261–1329), also of Padua, in 1315 wrote the [[Latin verse]] tragedy ''Eccerinis'', which uses the story of the tyrant [[Ezzelino III da Romano]] to highlight the danger to Padua posed by [[Cangrande della Scala]] of [[Verona]].&lt;ref name=muss&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/albertino-mussato// "Mussato, Albertino"], ''Treccani: Enciclopedie on line'' (in Italian). Accessed March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first secular tragedy written since Roman times, and may be considered the first Italian tragedy identifiable as a Renaissance work. The earliest tragedies to employ purely classical themes are the ''Achilles'' written before 1390 by [[Antonio Loschi]] of [[Vicenza]] (c.1365–1441) and the ''Progne'' of the [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Gregorio Correr]] (1409–1464) which dates from 1428–29.&lt;ref name=eb&gt;"Drama", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', eleventh edition, Vol. '''VIII''', p. 503&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1515 [[Gian Giorgio Trissino]] (1478–1550) of Vicenza wrote his tragedy ''Sophonisba'' in the [[vernacular]] that would later be called [[Italian language|Italian]]. Drawn from [[Livy]]'s account of [[Sophonisba]], the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] princess who drank poison to avoid being taken by the Romans, it adheres closely to classical rules. It was soon followed by the ''Oreste'' and ''Rosmunda'' of Trissino's friend, the Florentine [[Giovanni di Bernardo Rucellai]] (1475–1525). Both were completed by early 1516 and are based on classical Greek models, ''Rosmunda'' on the ''[[Hecuba]]'' of [[Euripides]],  and ''Oreste'' on the ''[[Iphigenia in Tauris]]'' of the same author; like ''Sophonisba'', they are in Italian and in blank (unrhymed) [[hendecasyllable]]s. Another of the first of all modern tragedies is ''A Castro'', by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] poet and playwright [[António Ferreira]], written around 1550 (but only published in 1587) in polymetric verse (most of it being blank hendecasyllables), dealing with the murder of [[Inês de Castro]], one of the most dramatic episodes in Portuguese history.   Although these three Italian plays are often cited, separately or together, as being the first regular tragedies in modern times, as well as the earliest substantial works to be written in blank hendecasyllables, they were apparently preceded by two other works in the vernacular: ''Pamfila'' or ''Filostrato e Panfila'' written in 1498 or 1508 by [[Antonio Cammelli]] (Antonio da Pistoia); and a ''Sophonisba'' by [[Galeotto del Carretto]] of 1502.&lt;ref name=hallam&gt;Henry Hallam (1837) [https://books.google.com/books?id=M8JMAAAAcAAJ ''Introduction to the Literature of Europe in the Fifteenth, Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries''].

From about 1500 printed copies, in the original languages, of the works of [[Sophocles]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], and [[Euripides]], as well as comedic writers such as [[Aristophanes]], [[Terence]] and [[Plautus]], were available in Europe and the next forty years saw [[Humanism|humanists]] and poets translating and adapting their tragedies.  In the 1540s, the European university setting (and especially, from 1553 on, the Jesuit colleges) became host to a Neo-Latin theatre (in Latin) written by scholars. The influence of Seneca was particularly strong in its humanist tragedy. His plays, with their ghosts, lyrical passages and rhetorical oratory, brought a concentration on rhetoric and language over dramatic action to many humanist tragedies.

The most important sources for French tragic theatre in the Renaissance were the example of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and the precepts of [[Horace]] and [[Aristotle]] (and contemporary commentaries by [[Julius Caesar Scaliger]] and [[Lodovico Castelvetro]]), although plots were taken from classical authors such as [[Plutarch]], [[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]], etc., from the Bible, from contemporary events and from short story collections (Italian, French and Spanish).  The Greek tragic authors ([[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]]) would become increasingly important as models by the middle of the 17th century. Important models were also supplied by the [[Spanish Golden Age]] playwrights [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]], [[Tirso de Molina]] and [[Lope de Vega]], many of whose works were translated and adapted for the French stage.

The common forms are the:
* ''Tragedy of circumstance'': people  are born into their situations, and do not choose them; such tragedies explore the consequences of birthrights, particularly for monarchs
* ''Tragedy of miscalculation'': the [[protagonist]]'s error of judgement has tragic consequences
* ''[[Revenge play]]''

In English, the most famous and most successful tragedies are those of [[William Shakespeare]] and his [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] contemporaries. Shakespeare's tragedies include:
* ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]''
* ''[[Coriolanus]]''
* ''[[Hamlet]]''
* ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''
* ''[[King Lear]]''
* ''[[Macbeth]]''
* ''[[Othello]]''
* ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''
* ''[[Timon of Athens]]''
* ''[[Titus Andronicus]]''
* ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]''

A contemporary of Shakespeare, [[Christopher Marlowe]], also wrote examples of tragedy in English, notably:
* ''[[The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus]]''
* ''[[Tamburlaine (play)|Tamburlaine the Great]]''

[[John Webster]] (1580?–1635?), also wrote famous plays of the genre:
* ''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]''
* ''[[The White Devil]]''

===Opera===
Contemporary with Shakespeare, an entirely different approach to facilitating the rebirth of tragedy was taken in Italy.  [[Jacopo Peri]], in the preface to his ''[[Euridice (opera)|Euridice]]'' refers to "the ancient Greeks and Romans (who in the opinion of many sang their staged tragedies throughout in representing them on stage)."{{Sfn | Headington | Westbrook | Barfoot | 1991 | p = 22}}  The attempts of Peri and his contemporaries to recreate ancient tragedy gave rise to the new Italian musical genre of [[opera]]. In France, tragic operatic works from the time of [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]] to about that of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]] were not called opera, but ''tragédie en musique'' ("tragedy in music") or some similar name; the ''tragédie en musique'' is regarded as a distinct musical genre.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Graham Sadler, [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/44040 "Tragédie en musique"], Grove Music Online (subscription required). Accessed March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Some later operatic [[composer]]s have also shared Peri's aims: [[Richard Wagner]]'s concept of ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'' ("integrated work of art"), for example, was intended as a return to the ideal of Greek tragedy in which all the arts were blended in service of the drama.{{Sfn | Headington | Westbrook | Barfoot | 1991 | p = 178}} [[Nietzsche]], in his ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' (1872) was to support Wagner in his claims to be a successor of the ancient dramatists.

==Neo-classical==
[[File:Talma as Nero in Britannicus by Racine - Delacroix - zeno.jpg|thumb|190px|French actor [[François-Joseph Talma|Talma]] as Nero in Racine's ''[[Britannicus (play)|Britannicus]].]]
For much of the 17th century, [[Pierre Corneille]], who made his mark on the world of tragedy with plays like ''Medée'' (1635) and ''Le Cid'' (1636), was the most successful writer of French tragedies. Corneille's tragedies were strangely un-tragic (his first version of ''Le Cid'' was even listed as a tragicomedy), for they had happy endings. In his theoretical works on theatre, Corneille redefined both comedy and tragedy around the following suppositions:
* The stage—in both comedy and tragedy—should feature noble characters (this would eliminate many low-characters, typical of the farce, from Corneille's comedies). Noble characters should not be depicted as vile (reprehensible actions are generally due to non-noble characters in Corneille's plays).
* Tragedy deals with affairs of the state (wars, dynastic marriages); comedy deals with love. For a work to be tragic, it need not have a tragic ending.
* Although [[Aristotle]] says that [[catharsis]] (purgation of emotion) should be the goal of tragedy, this is only an ideal. In conformity with the moral codes of the period, plays should not show evil being rewarded or nobility being degraded.

Corneille continued to write plays through 1674 (mainly tragedies, but also something he called "heroic comedies") and many continued to be successes, although the "irregularities" of his theatrical methods were increasingly criticised (notably by [[François Hédelin, abbé d'Aubignac]]) and the success of Jean Racine from the late 1660s signalled the end of his preeminence.

[[Jean Racine]]'s tragedies—inspired by Greek myths, [[Euripides]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]—condensed their plot into a tight set of passionate and duty-bound conflicts between a small group of noble characters, and concentrated on these characters' double-binds and the geometry of their unfulfilled desires and hatreds. Racine's poetic skill was in the representation of [[pathos]] and amorous passion (like [[Phèdre]]'s love for her stepson) and his impact was such that emotional crisis would be the dominant mode of tragedy to the end of the century. Racine's two late plays ("Esther" and "Athalie") opened new doors to biblical subject matter and to the use of theatre in the education of young women. Racine also faced criticism for his irregularities: when his play, ''[[Bérénice]]'', was criticised for not containing any deaths, Racine disputed the conventional view of tragedy.

==Bourgeois==
{{further|Bourgeois tragedy|Augustan drama}}

Bourgeois tragedy (German: Bürgerliches Trauerspiel) is a form that developed in 18th-century Europe. It was a fruit of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the emergence of the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois class]] and its ideals. It is characterised by the fact that its protagonists are ordinary citizens. The first true bourgeois tragedy was an English play, [[George Lillo]]'s ''The London Merchant; or, the History of George Barnwell'', which was first performed in 1731. Usually, [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s play ''Miss Sara Sampson'', which was first produced in 1755, is said to be the earliest ''Bürgerliches Trauerspiel'' in Germany.

==Modern development==
In [[modernist literature]], the definition of tragedy has become less precise. The most fundamental change has been the rejection of Aristotle's dictum that true tragedy can only depict those with power and high status. [[Arthur Miller]]'s essay "Tragedy and the Common Man" (1949) argues that tragedy may also depict ordinary people in domestic surroundings.{{sfn|Miller|1949|p=894}} British playwright [[Howard Barker]] has argued strenuously for the rebirth of tragedy in the contemporary theatre, most notably in his volume ''[[Arguments for a Theatre]]''. "You emerge from tragedy equipped against lies. After the musical, you're anybody's fool," he insists.{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=13}} Critics such as [[George Steiner]] have even been prepared to argue that tragedy may no longer exist in comparison with its former manifestations in classical antiquity. In ''The Death of Tragedy'' (1961) George Steiner outlined the characteristics of Greek tragedy and the traditions that developed from that period. In the Foreword (1980) to a new edition of his book Steiner concluded that ‘the dramas of Shakespeare are not a renascence of or a humanistic variant of the absolute tragic model. They are, rather, a rejection of this model in the light of tragi-comic and “realistic” criteria.’ In part, this feature of Shakespeare’s mind is explained by his bent of mind or imagination which was ‘so encompassing, so receptive to the plurality of diverse orders of experience.’ When compared to the drama of Greek antiquity and French classicism Shakespeare’s forms are ‘richer but hybrid'.&lt;ref&gt;George Steiner, ''The Death of Tragedy'' [1961] (Oxford University Press, 1980; Yale University Press, 1996), p. xiii.

{{further|Poetics (Aristotle)}}

[[Aristotle]] wrote in his work [[Poetics (Aristotle)|''Poetics'']] that
tragedy is characterised by seriousness and involves a great [[person]] who experiences a reversal of [[luck|fortune]] (''[[Peripeteia]]''). Aristotle's [[definition]] can include a change of fortune from bad to good as in the ''[[The Eumenides|Eumenides]]'', but he says that the change from good to bad as in ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' is preferable because this induces [[pity]] and [[fear]] within the spectators. Tragedy results in a [[catharsis]] (emotional cleansing) or healing for the audience through their experience of these emotions in response to the suffering of the characters in the drama.

According to [[Aristotle]], "the [[structure]] of the best tragedy should not be simple but complex and one that represents incidents arousing [[fear]] and [[pity]]—for that is peculiar to this form of art."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Trans. W.H. Fyfe. Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1932. Section 1452b&lt;/ref&gt;  This reversal of fortune must be caused by the tragic hero's ''[[hamartia]]'', which is often translated as either a [[character flaw]], or as a mistake (since the original Greek etymology traces back to ''hamartanein'', a sporting term that refers to an [[archery|archer]] or [[spear]]-thrower missing his target).&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, Amelie Oksenberg. ''[[Literary criticism|Essays on Aristotle’s Poetics]]''. Princeton: Princeton UP, 1992. Page 178&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Aristotle]], "The misfortune is brought about not by [general] vice or depravity, but by some [particular] error or frailty."&lt;ref&gt;''Poetics'', Aristotle&lt;/ref&gt;  The reversal is the inevitable but unforeseen result of some action taken by the hero. It is also a misconception that this reversal can be brought about by a higher power (e.g. the [[law]], the [[god]]s, [[destiny|fate]], or [[society]]), but if a character’s downfall is brought about by an external cause, [[Aristotle]] describes this as a [[misadventure]] and not a tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics''. Section 1135b&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the tragic hero may achieve some revelation or recognition ([[anagnorisis]]--"knowing again" or "knowing back" or "knowing throughout") about human fate, destiny, and the will of the gods. Aristotle terms this sort of recognition "a change from ignorance to awareness of a bond of love or hate."

In ''Poetics'', Aristotle gave the following definition in [[ancient Greek]] of the word "tragedy" (τραγῳδία):&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'', 1449b&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ἔστιν οὖν τραγῳδία μίμησις πράξεως σπουδαίας καὶ τελείας μέγεθος ἐχούσης, ἡδυσμένῳ λόγῳ χωρὶς ἑκάστῳ τῶν εἰδῶν ἐν τοῖς μορίοις, δρώντων καὶ οὐ δι᾽ ἀπαγγελίας, δι᾽ ἐλέου καὶ φόβου περαίνουσα τὴν τῶν τοιούτων παθημάτων κάθαρσιν."

which means ''Tragedy is an imitation of an action that is admirable, complete (composed of an introduction, a middle part and an ending), and possesses magnitude; in language made pleasurable, each of its species separated in different parts; performed by actors, not through narration; effecting through pity and fear the purification of such emotions.''

Common usage of tragedy refers to any story with a sad ending, whereas to be an [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] tragedy the [[narrative|story]] must fit the set of requirements as laid out by ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''.  By this definition social drama cannot be tragic because the hero in it is a victim of circumstance and incidents that depend upon the society in which he lives and not upon the inner compulsions — psychological or religious — which determine his progress towards self-knowledge and death.&lt;ref&gt;Chiari, J. ''Landmarks of Contemporary Drama''. [[London]]: [[Jenkins (publisher)|Jenkins]], 1965. Page 41.&lt;/ref&gt;  Exactly what constitutes a "tragedy", however, is a frequently debated matter.

According to Aristotle, there are four species of tragedy:

1. Complex, which involves [[Peripety]] and [[Discovery (fiction)|Discovery]]

2. Suffering, tragedies of such nature can be seen in the Greek mythological stories of Ajaxes and Ixions

3. Character, a tragedy of moral or ethical character. Tragedies of this nature can be found in Phthiotides and [[Peleus]]

4. Spectacle, that of a horror-like theme. Examples of this nature are [[Graeae|Phorcides]] and [[Prometheus]]

===Hegel===
[[G.W.F. Hegel]], the German philosopher most famous for his dialectical approach to [[epistemology]] and history, also applied such a methodology to his theory of tragedy. In his essay "Hegel's Theory of Tragedy," [[A.C. Bradley]] first introduced the English-speaking world to Hegel's theory, which Bradley called the "[[tragic collision]]", and contrasted against the Aristotelian notions of the "[[tragic hero]]" and his or her "hamartia" in subsequent analyses of the Aeschylus' Oresteia trilogy and of Sophocles' Antigone.{{Sfn | Bradley | 2007 | pp = 114–56}} Hegel himself, however, in his seminal "[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]" argues for a more complicated theory of tragedy, with two complementary branches which, though driven by a single dialectical principle, differentiate Greek tragedy from that which follows Shakespeare. His later lectures formulate such a theory of tragedy as a conflict of ethical forces, represented by characters, in ancient Greek tragedy, but in Shakespearean tragedy the conflict is rendered as one of subject and object, of individual personality which must manifest self-destructive passions because only such passions are strong enough to defend the individual from a hostile and capricious external world:
{{Quote |The heroes of ancient classical tragedy encounter situations in which, if they firmly decide in favor of the one ethical pathos that alone suits their finished character, they must necessarily come into conflict with the equally [''gleichberechtigt''] justified ethical power that confronts them. Modern characters, on the other hand, stand in a wealth of more accidental circumstances, within which one could act this way or that, so that the conflict is, though occasioned by external preconditions, still essentially grounded in the character. The new individuals, in their passions, obey their own nature... simply because they are what they are. Greek heroes also act in accordance with individuality, but in ancient tragedy such individuality is necessarily... a self-contained ethical pathos...  In modern tragedy, however, the character in its peculiarity  decides in accordance with subjective desires... such that congruity of character with outward ethical aim no longer constitutes an essential basis of tragic beauty...{{Sfn | Hegel | 1927 | pp = 567–8}}}}

Hegel's comments on a particular play may better elucidate his theory: "Viewed externally, Hamlet's death may be seen to have been brought about accidentally... but in Hamlet's soul, we understand that death has lurked from the beginning: the sandbank of finitude cannot suffice his sorrow and tenderness, such grief and nausea at all conditions of life... we feel he is a man whom inner disgust has almost consumed well before death comes upon him from outside."{{Sfn | Hegel | 1927 | p = 572}}

==Similar dramatic forms in world theatre==
===Ancient Indian drama===
The writer [[Bharata Muni]], in his work on [[dramatic theory]] ''[[Natya Shastra|A Treatise on Theatre]]'' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''Nātyaśāstra'', नाट्य शास्त्र, c. 200 BCE – 200 CE),{{Sfn | Banham | 1998 | p = 517}} identified several ''[[Rasa (art)|rasas]]'' (such as pity, anger, disgust and terror) in the emotional responses of audiences for the [[Sanskrit drama]] of [[History of India|ancient India]]. The text also suggests the notion of [[musical mode]]s or jatis which are the origin of the notion of the modern melodic structures known as [[raga]]s. Their role in invoking emotions are emphasised; thus compositions emphasising the notes [[gandhara]] or [[rishabha]] are said to provoke "sadness" or "pathos" (''karuna rasa'') whereas [[rishabha]] evokes heroism (''vira rasa''). Jatis are elaborated in greater detail in the text ''[[Dattilam]]'', composed around the same time as the ''Treatise''.

The celebrated ancient [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epic]], ''[[Mahabharata]]'', can also be related to tragedy in some ways.  According to [[Hermann Oldenberg]], the original epic once carried an immense "tragic force".&lt;ref name = Oldenberg&gt;{{Citation | first = Hermann | last = Oldenberg | author-link = Hermann Oldenberg | year = 1922 | title = Das Mahabharata | place = Göttingen}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was common in Sanskrit drama to adapt episodes from the ''Mahabharata'' into dramatic form.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11986">'''Narrative transportation theory''' proposes that when people lose themselves in a story, their attitudes and intentions change to reflect that story. The mental state of narrative transportation can explain the persuasive effect of stories on people, who may experience narrative transportation when certain contextual and personal preconditions are met, as Green and Brock&lt;ref&gt;Green, M. C., &amp; Brock, T. C. (2002). "In the mind's eye: Transportation-imagery model of narrative persuasion." In M. C. Green, J. J. Strange &amp; T. C. Brock (Eds.), ''Narrative impact: Social and cognitive foundations''. (pp. 315-341). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; postulate for the transportation-imagery model. As van Laer, de Ruyter, Visconti, and Wetzels&lt;ref name=vanlaer2014 /&gt; elaborate further, narrative transportation occurs whenever the story receiver experiences a feeling of entering a world evoked by the narrative because of empathy for the story characters and imagination of the story plot.

== Defining the field ==
Deighton, Romer, and McQueen&lt;ref name=deighton1989&gt;Deighton, J., Romer, D., &amp; McQueen, J. (1989). "Using drama to persuade." ''Journal of Consumer Research, 16''(3), 335-343.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|335}} anticipate the construct of narrative transportation by arguing that a story invites story receivers into the action it portrays and, as a result, makes them lose themselves in the story.&lt;ref&gt;Nell, V. (1988). ''Lost in a book: The psychology of reading for pleasure''. New Haven, CT: Yale University.&lt;/ref&gt; Gerrig&lt;ref&gt;Gerrig, R. J. (1993). ''Experiencing narrative worlds: On the psychological activities of reading''. New Haven, CT: Yale.&lt;/ref&gt; was the first to coin the notion of narrative transportation within the context of novels. Using travel as a metaphor for reading, he conceptualizes narrative transportation as a state of detachment from the world of origin that the story receiver—in his words, the traveler—experiences because of his or her engrossment in the story, a condition that Green and Brock&lt;ref&gt;Green, M. C., &amp; Brock, T. C. (2000). "The role of transportation in the persuasiveness of public narratives." ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 79''(5), 701-721.&lt;/ref&gt; later describe as the story receiver's experience of being carried away by the story. Notably, the state of narrative transportation makes the world of origin partially inaccessible to the story receiver, thus marking a clear separation in terms of here/there and now/before, or narrative  world/world of origin.

===Relevant features===
Most research on narrative transportation follows the original definition of the construct. Scholars in the field constantly reaffirm the relevance of three features. 
# Narrative transportation requires that people process stories—the acts of receiving and interpreting.
# Story receivers become transported through two main components: empathy and mental imagery. Empathy implies that story receivers try to understand the experience of a story character, that is, to know and feel the world in the same way. Thus, empathy offers an explanation for the state of detachment from the world of origin that is narrative transportation. In mental imagery, story receivers generate vivid images of the story plot, such that they feel as though they are experiencing the events themselves.
# When transported, story receivers lose track of reality in a physiological sense. 
In accordance with these features, van Laer et al.&lt;ref name=vanlaer2014&gt;van Laer, T., de Ruyter, K., Visconti, L. M., &amp; Wetzels, M. (2014). "The Extended Transportation-Imagery Model: A meta-analysis of the antecedents and consequences of consumers' narrative transportation." ''Journal of Consumer Research, 40''(5), 797-817. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2033192 or doi: https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/673383&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|799}} define narrative transportation as the extent to which 
# an individual empathizes with the story characters and 
# the story plot activates his or her imagination,
which leads him or her to experience suspended reality during story reception.

===Similar constructs===
Narrative transportation is a form of experiential response to narratives and thus is similar to other constructs, such as absorption, optimal experience or [[Flow (psychology)|flow]], and [[immersion (virtual reality)|immersion]]. Yet several subtle, critical differences exist. Absorption refers to a personality trait or general tendency to be immersed in life experiences; transportation  is an engrossing temporary experience. Flow is a more general construct (i.e., people can experience flow in a variety of activities), whereas transportation specifically entails empathy and mental imagery, which do not occur in flow experiences.  Phillips and McQuarrie&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, B. J. and E. F. McQuarrie (2010). "Narrative and persuasion in fashion advertising." ''Journal of Consumer Research 37''(3), 368-392.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrate that immersion is primarily an experiential response to aesthetic and visual elements of images, whereas narrative transportation relies on a story with plot and characters, features that are not present in immersion.

== Narrative persuasion ==
Since narrative transportation's conceptualization, research has demonstrated that the transported "traveler" can return changed by the journey. Subsequent studies have confirmed that a story can engross the story receiver in a transformational experience, whose effects are strong and long-lasting. The transformation that narrative transportation achieves is persuasion of the story receiver. More specifically, van Laer et al.'s&lt;ref name=vanlaer2014 /&gt; literature review reveals that narrative transportation can cause affective and cognitive responses, beliefs, and attitude and intention changes. However, the processing pattern of narrative transportation is markedly different from that in well-established models of persuasion.

===Rival models===
Before 2000, dual-process models of persuasion, especially the [[elaboration likelihood model]] and [[heuristic-systematic model]], dominated persuasion research. These models attempt to explain why people accept or reject message claims. According to these models, the determination of a claim's acceptability can result from careful evaluation of the arguments presented or from reliance on superficial cues, such as the presence of an expert. Whether receivers scrutinize a message depends on the extent to which they are able and motivated to process it systematically. As important variables, these models include empathy, familiarity, involvement, and the number and nature of thoughts the message evokes. If these variables are mainly positive, the receiver's attitudes and intentions tend to be more positive; if the variables are predominantly negative, the resulting attitudes and intentions are more negative. These variables also exist in narrative persuasion.

===Differences between analytical and narrative persuasion===
Analytical persuasion and narrative persuasion differ depending on the role of involvement. In analytical persuasion, involvement depends on the extent to which the message has personally relevant consequences for a receiver's money, time, or other resources. If these consequences are sufficiently severe, receivers evaluate the arguments carefully and generate thoughts related to the arguments. Yet, as Slater&lt;ref&gt;Slater, M. D. (2002). "Entertainment education and the persuasive impact of narratives." In T. C. Brock, M. C. Green &amp; J. J. Strange (Eds.), ''Narrative impact: Social and cognitive foundations'' (pp. 157-181). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|171}} notes, even though severe consequences for stories are relatively rare, "viewers or readers of an entertainment narrative typically appear to be far more engrossed in the message." This type of involvement, or narrative transportation, is arguably the crucial determinant of narrative persuasion.

Though the dual-process models provide a valid description of analytical persuasion, they do not encompass narrative persuasion. Analytical persuasion refers to attitudes and intentions developed from processing messages that are overtly persuasive, such as most lessons in science books, news reports, and speeches. However, narrative persuasion refers to attitudes and intentions developed from processing narrative messages that are not overtly persuasive, such as novels, movies, or video games. Addressing the strength and duration of the persuasive effects of processing stories, narrative transportation is a mental state that produces enduring persuasive effects without careful evaluation of arguments. Transported story receivers are engrossed in a story in a way that neither is inherently critical nor involves great scrutiny.

===Sleeper effect===
Narrative transportation seems to be more unintentionally affective than intentionally cognitive in nature. This way of processing leads to potentially increasing and long-lasting persuasive effects. Appel and Richter&lt;ref&gt;Appel, M., &amp; Richter, T. (2007). "Persuasive effects of fictional narratives increase over time." ''Media Psychology, 10''(1), 113-134.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|128}} use the term "sleeper effect" to describe this paradoxical property of narrative transportation over time, which consists of a more pronounced change in attitudes and intentions and a greater certainty that these attitudes and intentions are correct.

Plausible explanations for the sleeper effect are twofold. 
# According to [[poststructural]] research, language's articulation in narrative format is capable not only of mirroring reality but also of constructing it. As such, stories could cause profound and durable persuasion of the transported story receiver as a result of his or her progressive internalization. When stories transport story receivers, not only do they present a narrative world but, by reframing the story receiver's language, they also durably change the world to which the story receiver returns after the transportation experience. 
# Research demonstrates that people analyze and retain stories differently from other information formats. For example, Deighton et al.&lt;ref name=deighton1989 /&gt; show that analytical advertisements stimulate cognitive responses whereas narrative advertisements are more likely to stimulate affective responses.
Following this line of reasoning, van Laer et al.&lt;ref name=vanlaer2014 /&gt;{{rp|801}} define narrative persuasion as
:''the effect of narrative transportation, which manifests itself in story receivers' affective and cognitive responses, beliefs, attitudes, and intentions from being swept away by a story and transported into a narrative world that modifies their perception of their world of origin.''
:
The conceptual distinction between analytical persuasion and narrative persuasion and the theoretical framework of sound interpretation of narrative persuasion both ground the extended transportation-imagery model (ETIM).

===Moderators===
ETIM contains three methodological factors that moderate the overall effect of narrative transportation, as van Laer, Feiereisen, and Visconti&lt;ref&gt;van Laer, T., Feiereisen, S., &amp; Visconti, L. M. "Storytelling in the digital era: A meta-analysis of relevant moderators of the narrative transportation effect." ''Journal of Business Research''. Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3156933&lt;/ref&gt; detail. The narrative transportation effect is stronger
# for stories in the commercial (vs. non-commercial) domain,
# for stories by users (vs. professionals), and
# for stories received alone (vs. with others).

In 1923, Universal produced the drama ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'', starring [[Lon Chaney]] as [[Quasimodo]]. The production sets were built to evoke 15th-century Paris, including a re-creation of the [[Notre Dame de Paris]] cathedral.

Chaney stars as [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|The Phantom]] in 1925's horror film, ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', based on the [[The Phantom of the Opera|mystery novel]] by [[Gaston Leroux]]. The interior of the [[Opéra Garnier]] was recreated to scale and was used again in the 1943 remake with [[Claude Rains]].

===1930s===

[[File:Frankenstein's monster (Boris Karloff).jpg|right|thumb|[[Boris Karloff]] in ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'']]

In 1931, [[Bela Lugosi]] starred in Universal's ''Dracula'' and [[Boris Karloff]] in ''Frankenstein''. Actors [[Dwight Frye]] and [[Edward Van Sloan]], who played major supporting roles in both films, made several film appearances in this decade. Make-up artist [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]] created several monsters' make-up starting in the 1930s.

''The Mummy'', starring Karloff, was produced in 1932. This was followed by a trilogy of films based on the tales of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]: ''[[Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932 film)|Murders in the Rue Morgue]]'' (1932) starring Lugosi, ''[[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]]'' (1934), and ''[[The Raven (1935 film)|The Raven]]'' (1935), the latter two of which teamed Lugosi with Karloff. Universal began releasing sequels including ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' (1935), ''[[Dracula's Daughter]]'' (1936) and sequels for ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]'' (1933). The first mainstream werewolf picture, ''[[Werewolf of London]]'' (1935) starring [[Henry Hull]], was not a box office triumph despite being revered by audiences today.

The end of Universal’s first run of horror films came in 1936. The monster movies were dropped from the production schedule altogether and would not re-emerge for another three years. In the meantime, a theatre owner revived ''Dracula'' and ''Frankenstein'' as a resoundingly successful double feature, prompting the studio to re-release the original movies. ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' (1939), starring [[Basil Rathbone]], Boris Karloff, and Bela Lugosi, was filmed as a result of the unexpected resurgence.

===1940s===
During the 1940s, Universal released ''The Wolf Man'' (1941), with [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] The junior Chaney became the studio's leading monster movie actor in the 1940s, just as his father had been two decades earlier, supplanting the 1930s' Karloff and Lugosi by a wide margin in terms of the number of leading roles that he played. Chaney Jr. physically resembled his father apart from usually being somewhat overweight, which the senior Chaney never was. The studio dropped the "Jr." from the junior Chaney's billing almost immediately to confuse some in the audiences into assuming that this was the same actor.

In 1943, the studio created a remake of ''[[Phantom of the Opera (1943 film)|Phantom of the Opera]]'', this time starring [[Nelson Eddy]] and [[Susanna Foster]] with Claude Rains as the Phantom.

The ''Frankenstein'' and ''Wolf Man'' series continued with ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'' (1942), in which Chaney Jr. played Frankenstein's monster and Lugosi reprised his role as Ygor, and ''Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man'' (1943) with Lugosi as the Frankenstein monster and Chaney Jr. as the Wolf Man. ''Son of Dracula'' (1943) featured Chaney Jr. in Lugosi's original role as the Count. The ''Mummy'' series was also continued with ''[[The Mummy's Hand]]'' (1940), ''[[The Mummy's Tomb]]'' (1942), ''[[The Mummy's Ghost]]'' and ''[[The Mummy's Curse]]'' (both 1944) with Chaney Jr. as the Mummy in the last three films. ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'' (1944) and ''[[House of Dracula]]'' (1945) featured many of the monsters from the studio's previous films. As the decade drew to a close, the comedy ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (1948) features Lugosi in only his second film as [[Count Dracula]], alongside Chaney Jr. as [[Larry Talbot]] (the Wolf Man), and [[Glenn Strange]] as [[Frankenstein's monster]].

===1950s===
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:CreaturefromtheBlackLagoon.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Ben Chapman (actor)|Ben Chapman]] in ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'']] --&gt;
Abbott and Costello appeared in films featuring characters such as the Mummy and the Invisible Man.

''Creature from the Black Lagoon'', directed by [[Jack Arnold (director)|Jack Arnold]], was released in 1954. ''Dracula'' and ''Frankenstein'' were re-released as double features in theatres, and were later broadcast in syndication on American television in 1957 as part of the ''[[Shock Theater]]'' package of Universal Monster Movies.&lt;ref name="Okuda"&gt;{{cite book|last = Okuda|first = Ted|authorlink = Ted Okuda|author2=Yurkiw, Mark |title = Chicago TV Horror Movie Shows: From Shock Theatre to Svengoolie|publisher = Lake Claremont Press|year = 2007|page = 14|isbn = 978-1893121133|quote= The 'Shock!' package was sold in 142 markets. As a result, stations across the country aired a late-night ''Shock Theatre'' series to showcase these pictures.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magazines such as ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]]'' covered the monster films. Universal spent the last half of the decade issuing a number of one-shot monster films.

===Dark Universe===
[[File:Dark Universe official logo.jpg|thumb|242x242px|Official logo of the Dark Universe, shared film universe as released by Universal Pictures]]
Dark Universe is the term given by Universal Pictures to their planned [[cinematic universe]], which will be based on the classic Universal Monsters film series. The studio's first attempt at this universe was with the film ''[[Dracula Untold]]''. Released on October 10, 2014, with [[Luke Evans (actor)|Luke Evans]] in the [[Count Dracula|titular role]], the film was developed prior to plans for a shared universe of horror films. However, it was retooled to be a part of the franchise. The film's mixed financial and critical reception resulted in the film's future status within the franchise becoming uncertain. Since the release of ''Dracula Untold'', the connections to the shared universe have been downplayed. Universal, which had announced plans to reboot [[The Mummy (franchise)|''The Mummy'' franchise]] in 2012, decided to re-position the new installment as the first film in the series. ''[[The Mummy (2017 film)|The Mummy]]'' was set to be released in 2017 with [[Alex Kurtzman]] as director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McClintock|first=Pamela|title=Universal Stakes Out Release Date for Third Monster Movie|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/universal-stakes-release-date-third-890292|accessdate=September 24, 2016|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mendelson|first=Scott|title=What Universal Must Do To Sell Its Classic Monsters Universe|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2016/07/13/what-universal-must-do-to-sell-its-classic-monsters-universe/#7772cec46b38|accessdate=September 24, 2016|publisher=''[[Forbes]]''|date=July 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Kurtzman and [[Chris Morgan (writer)|Chris Morgan]] were announced as headlining the Dark Universe, with collaborations from [[David Koepp]] and [[Christopher McQuarrie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-may-1495481404-htmlstory.html|title=Universal debuts its spooky new Dark Universe and its upcoming 'Bride of Frankenstein'|publisher=''LA Times''|author=Woerner, Meredith|date=May 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the crew, Universal announced the casting of [[Russell Crowe]] as [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Henry Jekyll / Mr. Edward Hyde]], [[Javier Bardem]] as the [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein Monster]], and [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|The Invisible Man]]. They would join [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Sofia Boutella]], as Nick Morton and Princess Ahmanet / The Mummy.
