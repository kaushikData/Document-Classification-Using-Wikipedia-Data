The game was released for the [[PlayStation 3]] in Japan on August 19, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=人気ロボットアクションゲームが堂々復活!!『Another Century's Episode：R（アナザーセンチュリーズエピソード アール）』|url=http://www.famitsu.com/game/coming/1233749_1407.html|date=April 8, 2010|accessdate=February 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
A new dynamic shooting mode called '''Chase Mode''' has been added to the game. This mode is similar to arcade shooters wherein the player's machine moves on rails and leaves the targeting weapons for the player to control. Each chase mode section precedes a boss battle; the examples released so far include the battle against the Behemoth from ''[[Full Metal Panic!]]'' and the battle against Nora Polyansky from ''[[Macross Zero]]''. A new ability called '''Burst Attack''' appears in this installment. Burst attack is available to all units, and is a special charge attack that changes depending on what machine is being used.

This is the first title in the ''A.C.E.'' series that allows to swap pilots between machines (excluding the [[Getter Robo Armageddon|Shin Getter]] team in ''[[Another Century's Episode 3: The Final]]''), though only for Universal Century mecha (those from Zeta Gundam, Crossbone Gundam and Genesis of Aquarion), in which pilot changing is a major plot point and constantly used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=「Another Century’s Episode:R」，スピード感溢れる「チェイスモード」などのゲームシステムが明らかに。初回特典のZガンダム3号機にも要注目|url=http://www.4gamer.net/games/108/G010886/20100607003/|publisher=[[4gamer.net]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Rather than integrating different series into one or two unified universes like previous titles of the series, ''A.C.E.: R'' presents each featured series as independent timelines, with the series' main characters proceeding with their own stories before the events of the game.

The main events of the game itself revolve around an original timeline again completely independent of all other featured series. In this timeline humanity has expanded beyond the Solar system, with planet Area becoming one of those resulting colonies. But somewhere along the line the Seasons, androids originally built to help the colonists settling on Area, rebelled against their human companions. Leading a robotic army collectively known as the Icon, the Seasons successfully wiped out the humans on planet Area, but there is one last trick up the colonists' sleeves: they made a data copy out of one of the Seasons androids and entrusted it, named Autumn-4, with genetic seeds of themselves as well as a trans-atmospheric battleship Ark Alpha. The intention was for Autumn-4 to take the gene seeds as far away from the Seasons' grip as possible so that the now-deceased colonists can be reborn on a safe world. Soon after commencement of Autumn-4's mission, however, Ark Alpha was intercepted by a fleet of Icon warships led by Winter-1, head of the Seasons.  Overwhelmed by the numerically-superior enemies and in desperation, Autumn-4 activated a device within Ark Alpha called V-Drive, which has the ability to create a blackhole-like portal to parallel universes: it worked, with [[Overman King Gainer|Brunhilde]] emerging from the portal and repulsing the Icon fleet, but also unintentionally caused characters from other timelines to be transported to planet Area as well.  To make the matter worse, the energy discharged by Brunhilde in the process affected Autumn-4's memory circuits and corrupted her record of the event, leaving her unable to explain to all the people who now find themselves stranded in a foreign universe as to what has transpired.

Nevertheless, feeling responsible for their plight, Autumn-4 decides to find out what happened and how to return them to their home worlds while enlisting their help in finding a way through the robotic army of the Seasons, who would shoot first and never ask questions much later.

==Music==
With a few exceptions, the background music is instrumental, though the game includes a BGM editor that allows for replacing music during gameplay and cutscenes with music from the PlayStation 3's hard drive. [[Acid Black Cherry]] will provide the themes for ''A.C.E.: R''. The opening theme is named "Re:Birth". There are two separate releases planned for this single. The first includes the title song "Re:Birth" and was released on August 18. The second release is planned for October, and includes a game edit version of "Re:Birth" as well as three additional songs that [[Acid Black Cherry]] created for '''Another Century's Episode R'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Acid Black Cherry |url=http://www.acidblackcherry.com/news.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202015522/http://acidblackcherry.com/news.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The game has sold up to 245,301 units and is ranked by ''[[Famitsu]]'' sales as #47 in its top 100 charts of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?s=b2d3141865eecc5115ab2f9261c739ff&amp;t=419169 Famitsu Sales: 2010 Top 100]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Anti-siphoning law}}

'''Anti-siphoning laws''' in [[Australia]] regulate the media companies' access to significant sporting events. In 1992, when the country experienced growth in paid-subscription media, the [[Parliament of Australia]] enacted the [[Broadcasting Services Act 1992]] that gave free-to-air broadcasters essentially first refusal to certain sporting event broadcasting rights. The '''anti-siphoning list''' is a list of events, the televising of which should, in the opinion of the relevant Minister, be available free to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Section 115 of the ''Broadcasting Services Act 1992''.&lt;/ref&gt; To effect this 'freedom', the ''Broadcasting Services Act 1992'' includes a licence condition on pay TV providers that prohibits them from acquiring anti-siphoning  events unless a national broadcaster or a network of commercial television broadcasters have the right to televise the events.&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 10(1)(e) of Schedule 2 to the ''Broadcasting Services Act 1992''&lt;/ref&gt; This prohibition drops away a certain period before the event starts. The current anti-siphoning rules also prohibit national television broadcasters and commercial television  broadcasters from premiering listed events on digital multi-channels. Listed events may be shown on digital multi-channels if they have already been broadcast, or are simultaneously broadcast on the broadcaster's main channel.

{{update section|date=March 2011}}
The anti-siphoning list came into effect in 2006. The relevant Minister has the power to add, amend or remove events from the list.&lt;ref&gt;These decisions must be notified in the Gazette and laid before each House of Parliament. The decision will come into effect if no motion of disallowance has been moved within 15 sitting days in either House.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, only sporting events are listed, even though the ''Broadcasting Services Act 1992'' does not limit the types of events that can be listed. There are currently ten sport types (e.g. tennis, soccer, rugby league) on the anti-siphoning list plus the Olympic and Commonwealth Games. Events on the anti-siphoning list are delisted 12 weeks before they start to ensure pay TV broadcasters have reasonable access to listed events, if free-to-air broadcasters decide not to purchase the broadcast rights for a particular event. Any rights to listed sporting events that are not acquired by free-to-air broadcasters are available to pay TV. Before the end of 2009, the Federal Government conducted a review of the anti-siphoning scheme, with the Minister proposing changes to the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minister.dbcde.gov.au/media/media_releases/2010/103|title=Reforms to the Anti-siphoning Scheme Announced|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514170355/http://www.minister.dbcde.gov.au/media/media_releases/2010/103|archivedate=14 May 2013|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These changes can not come into effect until amending legislation is passed through the Australian Parliament.
After the broadcasting deals were announced with [[Cricket Australia]], [[Seven Network]] and [[Fox Cricket]], Men’s ODIs and T20s will be live and exclusively broadcast on [[Foxtel]].

[[File:Big Things Postcard.jpg|A selection of Australia's big things|thumb|400px|right]]

The '''big things''' of [[Australia]] are a loosely related set of large structures, some of which are [[novelty architecture]] and some are [[sculpture]]s. There are estimated to be over 150 such objects around the country. There are big things in every state and territory in [[Australia (continent)|continental Australia]].

Most big things began as [[tourist trap]]s found along major roads between destinations.

The big things have become something of a [[Cult following|cult]] phenomenon, and are sometimes used as an excuse for a [[road trip]], where many or all big things are visited and used as a backdrop to a group photograph. Many of the big things are considered works of [[folk art]] and have been heritage-listed, though others have come under threat of demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/travel/big-brash-and-finally-treasured-20090714-djdi.html|title=Big, brash and finally treasured|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=14 July 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140405005825/http://www.smh.com.au/travel/big-brash-and-finally-treasured-20090714-djdi.html|archivedate=5 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/australias-big-problem-what-to-do-with-our-ageing-super-sized-statues-83424|title=Australia's ‘big’ problem – what to do with our ageing super-sized statues?|last=Clarke|first=Amy|work=The Conversation|access-date=1 December 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201081540/https://theconversation.com/australias-big-problem-what-to-do-with-our-ageing-super-sized-statues-83424|archivedate=1 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| From the "Landmark Legends of Stanthorpe", "The original Big Apple, a Granny Smith, lived at the petrol station at Applethorpe from 1978. The steel and fibreglass sculpture stands 4m tall and the apple is 4.5m in diameter. It was crafted by local artisan Johnny Ross. It went into temporary retirement in 2003 when the Applethorpe site was redeveloped. After a brief facelift, the re-grafted apple emerged as a Royal Gala apple slightly north of town at Thulimbah. Its new home is Vincenzo’s at the Big Apple, which is situated on the opposite side of the new England Highway to Suttons Apple Orchard &amp; Cidery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Granite Belt Wine &amp; Tourism Inc.|title=Landmark Legends of Stanthorpe|url=http://www.granitebeltwinecountry.com.au/pages/landmark-legends-of-stanthorpe|accessdate=2 January 2013|newspaper=Granite Belt Wine Country Tourism Website|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112231029/http://www.granitebeltwinecountry.com.au/pages/landmark-legends-of-stanthorpe/|archivedate=12 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''Big Things'', p. 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Back to Stone''''' is an [[action role-playing]]/[[hack and slash]] game using an [[Isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|isometric 3D perspective]] developed by French studio Hidden Floor.&lt;ref name=OfficialNeko /&gt; It was published by [[Neko Entertainment]] / [[Big Ben Interactive]] in Europe and by Graffiti Entertainment / [[O~3 Entertainment]] in North America.&lt;ref name="OfficialNeko"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.e-neko.com/?p=1397 |title=Back to stone |publisher=[[Neko Entertainment]] |accessdate=September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music was composed by [[Frédéric Motte|Frédéric "Elmobo" Motte]].&lt;ref name=Composer /&gt; It was released for the [[Game Boy Advance]] on December 14, 2006.&lt;ref name=OfficialNeko /&gt;

==Gameplay==
The player controls a warrior who is mysteriously [[amnesiac]] and has been experimented on by demonic creatures. Players can move the character around the game's environments freely, jump around platforms, and fight enemies dynamically. Killed enemies turn to stone, which can then be moved around and used to solve puzzles. When the player's character is wounded, he transforms into a demonic monster, which improves his fighting capabilities.&lt;ref name="Jeuxpo"&gt;{{cite web |title=Après plusieurs années de développement, Back to Stone arrive enfin sur GB A|trans-title=After many years in development, Back to Stone finally arrives on GBA |url=http://jeuxpo.com/game_test-2219.html |publisher=JeuXpo.com |accessdate=September 11, 2015 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NSpin" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nexus /&gt;

The game does not feature any way to [[Saved game|save the player's progress]], which had been a standard feature of video games for many years by 2006. Instead, the game relies on [[Password (video gaming)|passwords]] to allow the player to return to the game where they had left off when they last turned off the console.&lt;ref name="JustRPG"&gt;{{cite web |author=Felipe Faria Lemos |title=Reviews – Back to Stone |url=http://just-rpg.com/default.asp?pid=2310 |publisher=Just RPG |accessdate=September 11, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217054337/http://just-rpg.com/default.asp?pid=2310 |archivedate=December 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game received mixed and negative reviews. Most critics considered the gameplay to be "simple" and "familiar",&lt;ref name="Jeuxpo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NSpin" /&gt; but the stone-pushing puzzles to be "unimaginative", unoriginal, and repetitive.&lt;ref name="JustRPG" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gamezone /&gt;&lt;ref name=GSpot /&gt;&lt;ref name=Thunder /&gt;

Some reviewers considered the graphics and design to be "charming and varied",&lt;ref name="Jeuxpo" /&gt; easy to discern (in contrast to ''[[Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge]]''),&lt;ref name="NSpin" /&gt;&lt;ref name=JV.com /&gt;&lt;ref name=Thunder /&gt; but many judged the presentation to be "drab", "grainy" and "muddy".&lt;ref name="NSpin" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nexus /&gt;&lt;ref name=EntDepot /&gt;&lt;ref name=Thunder /&gt; The game's smooth framerate and special effects have received praise,&lt;ref name="JustRPG" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gamezone /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pockett /&gt; as have the intricate boss battles.&lt;ref name=Gamezone /&gt;&lt;ref name=GSpot /&gt;&lt;ref name=EntDepot /&gt;

Several reviewers have noted that controlling the character from the game's [[Isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|isometric 3D perspective]] was very difficult and "unintuitive" because of the rigidity of a [[directional pad]] and the difficulty in judging depth.&lt;ref name="Jeuxpo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NSpin" /&gt;&lt;ref name=GSpot /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pockett /&gt;&lt;ref name=JV.com/&gt;&lt;ref name=EntDepot /&gt;&lt;ref name=Thunder /&gt; Multiple critics have praised the game's length (estimated between 8 and 15 hours), which is considered good for a portable game.&lt;ref name="Jeuxpo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NSpin" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nexus /&gt;&lt;ref name=GSpot /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pockett /&gt; The translation's poor quality has also been criticized.&lt;ref name=JustRPG /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gamezone /&gt;

''Back to Stone'' was heavily criticized almost unanimously for its lack of saving functionality, instead relying on a password-based system to track the player's progress, which was seen as a "cumbersome" flaw for a game on a handheld console, as well as "stupefying", "unforgivable" and "inexcusably archaic" when compared to other games released in this era.&lt;ref name="NSpin"&gt;{{cite web |last=Nielsen |first=Clark |title=Back to Stone Game Boy Review |url=http://www.nintendospin.com/reviews/gameboy/1741/back-to-stone.html |publisher=Nintendo Spin |accessdate=September 11, 2015 |date=December 31, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727024130/http://www.nintendospin.com/reviews/gameboy/1741/back-to-stone.html |archivedate=July 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nexus /&gt;&lt;ref name="JustRPG" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gamezone /&gt;&lt;ref name=GSpot /&gt;&lt;ref name=JV.com /&gt;&lt;ref name=EntDepot /&gt;&lt;ref name=Thunder /&gt;

'''Bessie Bonehill''' (17 February 1855 &amp;ndash; 21 August 1902) was an English [[vaudeville]] singer, comic entertainer and [[male impersonator]].&lt;ref name="NYTs obit 1902 Aug 22" /&gt; She toured widely in the United States in the 1890s, becoming "one of the most famous and wealthy entertainers of her day".&lt;ref name=bonehill /&gt;

==Biography==
She was born into a poor family in [[West Bromwich]], [[History of Staffordshire|Staffordshire]], England.  Official records give her birth name as '''Betsey Bonehill'''.&lt;ref name="FamilySearch-births-Bonehill" /&gt;  She appeared in the 1860s as a double act with her sister Marion.&lt;ref name="Anthony 2013" /&gt; After cropping her hair, she became well known as a "[[principal boy]]" actor in local [[pantomime]]s, before moving to [[London]] and appearing as a male impersonator and performer of "[[Costermonger|coster songs]]" in theatres in the 1870s and 1880s.&lt;ref name=bonehill&gt;[http://www.zyworld.com/bonehill/BessieBonehillBook.htm Publicity for Richard Bonehill, ''England's Gem: The Story of Bessie Bonehill''] (retrieved 13 June 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of her songs were written by [[Arthur West (songwriter)|Arthur West]],&lt;ref name="Arthur-West-bio" group=lower-alpha /&gt; a friend of [[Charlie Chaplin]].&lt;ref name="Anthony 2013" /&gt;  In 1877 she married Louis Abrahams, and had two daughters and a son with him.&lt;ref name="hamlet" /&gt;

While she was appearing in London, American vaudeville impresario [[Tony Pastor]] persuaded her to travel to the United States to perform. She first appeared in Pastor's Theatre, on [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street, Manhattan]], in 1889. The ''[[New York Times]]'' described her as "lithe and frisky, strident as to voice and nimble as to feet....  [S]he is as much at home in masculine garb as if to the manner born."&lt;ref name="hamlet" /&gt;  According to her local obituary, "her success was immediate and her male impersonations were the theatrical sensation of the winter. Her beauty, cheerful personality and her entire freedom from vulgarity were new then in male impersonation."&lt;ref name="Suffolk-County-News 1902 Aug 22" /&gt; Her song "Comrades", which she performed as a [[Newspaper hawker|newsboy]], was a success, and she toured widely in the United States.&lt;ref name="Suffolk-County-News 1902 Aug 22" /&gt;

She remained in the United States for most of the next decade, bringing her family with her; a British [[music hall]] manager said that "she had sold out to the mighty dollar".&lt;ref name=bonehill/&gt;  In 1890 she married for the second time, to an American, William Smith (known professionally as William Seeley), who was several years her junior; they had a son.&lt;ref name="hamlet" /&gt;  She performed in the [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Little Christopher Columbus|Little Christopher]]'', and another show, ''Playmates'', written by her husband, before returning to vaudeville as the head of her own traveling company which toured across the United States.&lt;ref name="hamlet" /&gt;  She was sometimes billed as "England's Gem",&lt;ref name=bonehill/&gt; and as "England's Favorite Comedy Cantatrice".&lt;ref name="Stevens-Point-Journal 1894 Dec 1" /&gt;  One reviewer described her as "the best character singer ever imported to these shores".&lt;ref name="Fields 2007" /&gt;  Her style as a male impersonator was adopted by later artists such as [[Vesta Tilley]] and [[Hetty King]].&lt;ref name="Anthony 2013" /&gt;

The company included her husband and son Jack (from her first marriage), who performed together as a [[musical comedy]] act, Seeley and West.&lt;ref name="Suffolk-County-News 1902 Aug 22" /&gt;  The company also toured in Britain, Europe, [[South America]], and [[South Africa]], from where they had to escape at the start of the [[Boer War]].&lt;ref name=bonehill/&gt;  Bessie Bonehill settled with her family around 1896 on a run-down 600-[[acre]] estate, Deer Hill Farm, at [[Sayville, New York|Sayville]] on [[Long Island]], which they developed as a family home.&lt;ref name="hamlet" /&gt;

She started a tour in England in 1901, but fell ill from what was later diagnosed as [[stomach cancer]].  She died on 21 August 1902 at [[Portsea, Portsmouth]], [[Hampshire]] at the age of 47.&lt;ref name="NYTs obit 1902 Aug 22" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suffolk-County-News 1902 Aug 22" /&gt;  She was buried (as Betsey Smith) at Kingston Cemetery, [[Portsmouth]].

The '''Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies''' ('''CCCS''') was a research centre at the University of Birmingham, England. It was founded in 1964 by [[Richard Hoggart]], its first director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Turner |first1=Graeme |title=British cultural studies : an introduction |date=2002 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415252287 |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1964 to 2002, the Centre played a major role in developing the field of [[cultural studies]].

== History ==
The Centre was the focus for what became known as the Birmingham School of Cultural Studies, or, more generally, 'British cultural studies'.  After its first director, [[Richard Hoggart]] departed in 1968, the Centre was led by [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] (1969-1979). He was succeeded by Richard Johnson (1980-1987).  The Birmingham CCCS approach to culture and politics evolved from a complex moment within British post-war history: the rise of the anti-Stalinist New Left; the promotion of adult education in Britain after World War II; the "Americanization" of British popular culture and the growth of mass communication in the decades after 1945; the growing multiculturalism of British society; and, the eventual influence within British academia of new critical methods like semiotics and structuralism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=Stuart |title=Race, Culture, and Communications: Looking Backward and Forward at Cultural Studies |journal=Rethinking Marxism |date=March 1992 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=10–18 |doi=10.1080/08935699208657998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dworkin |first1=Dennis |title=Cultural Marxism in postwar Britain : history, the new left, and the origins of cultural studies |date=1997 |publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=0822319144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on a variety of influences ([[feminism]], [[structuralism]], [[Marxism]] - - especially the work of [[Louis Althusser]] and [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[sociology]], [[critical race theory]], and [[post-structuralism]]), over the course of several decades the Centre pioneered a variety of approaches to the study of culture, including: ideological analysis; studies of working-class cultures and subcultures; the role of media audiences; feminist cultural research; hegemonic struggles in state politics; and the place of race in social and cultural processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shulman |first1=Norma |title="Conditions of their Own Making: An Intellectual History of the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at the University of Birmingham" |journal=Canadian Journal of Communication |date=1993 |volume=18 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of this development can be found in the series of stencilled occasional papers the Centre published between 1973 and 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stencilled Occasional Papers of the Birmingham CCCS - University of Birmingham |url=https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/historycultures/departments/history/research/projects/cccs/publications/stencilled-occasional-papers.aspx |website=www.birmingham.ac.uk |language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;   


== Noted staff members ==
The Centre produced many key studies and developed the careers of prominent researchers and academics. [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], who became the centre's director in 1968, developed his seminal ''Encoding/Decoding'' model here. Of special importance is the collective research that led to Policing the Crisis (1978), a study of law and order campaigns that focused on "mugging" (a code for street violence). This anticipated many of the law and order themes of [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s Conservative government in the 1980s. Other noted Centre books include 'Off-Centre: Feminism and Cultural Studies'; 'Resistance through Rituals'; 'The Empire Strikes Back'; 'Border Patrols: Policing the Boundaries of Heterosexuality'.

Richard Johnson was later director and encouraged research in social and cultural history. The centre staff included Maureen McNeil, noted theorist of culture and science, Michael Green who focused on media,  cultural policy and regional cultures in the midlands, and Ann Gray, culture and media.

Graduates and associates of the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies and the Department of Cultural Studies include: [[Paul Gilroy]] (King's College London) theorist of culture and race, [[Angela McRobbie]] (Goldsmiths) theorist of consumption, femininity and popular culture, Celia Lury (Goldsmiths) feminist theory and consumption, Jackie Stacey (University of Manchester), film, cancer culture and science in culture, Sarah Franklin (LSE) science as culture, Debbie Epstein (University of Cardiff), education, childhood and youth studies, sexuality and popular culture, Peter Redman (The Open University) masculinities, psychoanalytic theory, Mary Jane Kehily (The Open University) childhood and youth studies, Joyce Canaan (City University, Birmingham) cultures of higher education, Anoop Nayak (Newcastle University) geographies of race,  Deborah Lynn Steinberg (Warwick University) science cultures, sexuality and popular culture, Hilary Pilkington (Warwick University) Russia and youth subcultures, Sue Wright (Danish Pedagogic University) cultures of higher education, Hazel Carby (Yale) race and literature, David Parker (Nottingham University), Mica Nava (University of East London) media studies,  Graham Dawson (University of Brighton) historical cultural studies, Chris Griffin (Bath University) girls and youth cultures,  and Adrian Kear (Aberystwith University) performance studies and psychoanalysis, Kevin J. Brehony (Roehampton University) historical studies of educational ideologies.

[[Empirical]] researchers included David Morley and Charlotte Brunsdon, who produced ''[[The Nationwide Project]]'' at the Centre. Dorothy Hobson's research about the reception of ''[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]]'' was based on her MA dissertation. Another important empirical researcher is [[Paul Willis (cultural theorist)|Paul Willis]], who received his PhD from the CCCS in 1972 and stayed as a researcher there until 1981.

In later years, on the dissolution of the Centre and formation of the Department of Cultural Studies and Sociology (CSS), [[Sadie Plant]], noted cybertheorist and feminist (author of ''Zeroes + Ones: Digital Women and the New Technoculture''), taught there, as did Jorge Larrain, the well-known Chilean sociologist and cultural historian, author of ''Identity and Modernity in Latin America'' and John Gabriel, sociologist of race. [[Frank Webster (sociologist)|Frank Webster]], a Sociologist with interests in Information Society issues and sympathy for the 'cultural turn', joined the newly formed Department of Cultural Studies and Sociology in 1999, but left for City University London when the department was abruptly closed in 2002.

== Closure in 2002 ==
{{tone|date=December 2014}}
The new Department of Cultural Studies and Sociology was unexpectedly and abruptly closed in 2002, a move the university's senior management described as 'restructuring'. The immediate reason given for disestablishment of the new department was an unexpectedly low result in the UK's Research Assessment Exercise of 2001, though a dean from the university described the decision as a consequence of "inexperienced 'macho management.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webster|first1=Frank|title=Cultural Studies and Sociology at, and After, the Closure of the Birmingham School|journal=Cultural Studies|date=2004|volume=18|issue=6|page=848}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Four of the department's fourteen members of staff were to be "retained" and its hundreds of students (nearly 250 undergraduates and postgraduates at that time, many from abroad) to be transferred to other departments. In the ensuing dispute most department staff left. There were protests against the decision to close Cultural Studies and Sociology from around the world and the University received much adverse criticism.

In April 2002, according to student testimonies, rumors began to circulate that the Department was going to be closed down because it had received a "very bad" 3a mark in a recent [[Research Assessment Exercise]] (RAE). Despite assurances as to the contrary, on June 21, 2002, right after the end of term, staff members received emails informing them of a decision that had already been taken to close down the Department. The decision was to be ratified on June 26.

Students and staff began a campaign to save the school, which gained considerable attention in the national press (see links below) and sparked numerous letters of support from former [[alumni]] all over the world. The main argument of the campaigners was that the Department was being closed down because of economic pressures relating to the public funding of British universities in accordance with RAE marks. The Department of Cultural Studies was a top money-making unit inside the School of Social Sciences.

Additionally, concerns were expressed that the Department was being "belatedly punished" for its political [[Radicalization|radicalism]], as one journalist put it. Indeed, the unreservedly [[leftwing]] Department's long history of conflict with the University's administration was well known to all{{dubious|date=August 2016}} who had studied at the [[University of Birmingham]] between the 1960s and the 1980s.{{Cn|date=August 2016}}

Of the four staff members who were "retained", one was attached to the Department of Social Policy, one to the Department of English, and one to the Institute of European Studies. The remaining ten staff members were invited to retire voluntarily in return for a severance package (one year's pay).

Professor [[David Marsh (political scientist)|David Marsh]], a political sociologist from the Department of Political Science and International Studies (POLSIS), was drafted in as temporary head of a new Department of Sociology, with Cultural Studies dropped from the title. Further posts were created in Sociology during 2003.

The Department had been top of the Guardian league table for Sociology before its closure and it continues to excel in this poll. The Department was recently ranked fourth in Guardian league tables for Sociology.

== 50th anniversary ==

{{update-section|date=August 2016}}
The 50th anniversary of the establishment of CCCS came in 2014. To mark this occasion, academics at the [[University of Birmingham]]– in collaboration with former members of staff at the Centre, including Richard Johnson, [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] and Michael Green, created an archive of CCCS-related material at the Cadbury Research Library at Birmingham.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

'''Charles Pathé''' ({{IPA-fr|pate|lang}}; 26 December 1863 &amp;ndash; 25 December 1957)&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb12778025c/PUBLIC Authority sheet] on the [[French National Library]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lesgensducinema.com/affiche_acteur.php?mots=charles+path%E9&amp;nom_acteur=PATHE%20Charles&amp;ident=40033&amp;debut=0&amp;record=0&amp;from=ok Death certificate] on Les gens du cinéma&lt;/ref&gt; was an important pioneer of the French film and recording industries. As the founder of [[Pathé |Pathé Frères]], its roots lie in 1896 [[Paris]], [[France]], when Pathé and his brothers, pioneered the development of the [[moving image]]. Pathé adopted the national emblem of France, the cockerel, as the trademark for his company. After the company, now called Compagnie Générale des Éstablissements Pathé Frères Phonographes &amp; Cinématographes, invented the cinema newsreel with ''Pathé-Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;Rège 2009, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; {{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==Early life==
The son of a butcher shop owner, Charles Morand Pathé was born at [[Chevry-Cossigny]], in the [[Seine-et-Marne]] ''[[département in France|département]]'' of [[France]]. His father, Jacques Pathé and mother, Thérèse-Émélie Kech were butchers by trade, and ran a delicatessen first in Chevry-Cossigny, and later in [[Vincennes]]. Charles had three brothers and two sisters.

==Business ventures==
Pathé left school at 14 to work as an apprentice butcher, at rue de Charenton, Paris. After military service, in 1889, at 25, he began working as a meat merchant but soon took his savings, and with the help of his brothers and his sister, embarked for Buenos Aires, Argentina, with the aim of setting up in business.

Pathé tried to establish himself in various trades including a laundry service based on industrial washing machines that turned out to be unsuccessful. His life was unsettled and Pathé was forced to change jobs frequently. After a final failure of trying to deal in exotic parrots, when he and his business partner were stricken with yellow fever, Pathé returned to France in poor health.

At age 30, Pathé married lle Foy in Paris, and worked as a clerk, drawing a meager salary.

==Sound recording==
Back in Vincennes, in August 1894, Pathé saw the phonograph invented by [[Thomas Edison]], demonstrated at the town fair. He immediately embraced the sound recording technology, purchasing examples of Edison machines to resell. In 1896, with his brothers Émile, Théophile and Jacques, Pathé founded [[Pathé|Société Pathé Frères]] (Pathé Brothers) in Paris, a company that manufactured and sold phonographs and phonograph cylinders, with Émile at his head.

[[File:Charles Pathe &amp; Ruth Roland - Aug 1919 FF.jpg|thumb|Charles Pathé and [[Ruth Roland]] at the signing of her contract in 1919]]

==Cinema==
While in London, Pathé saw the [[Kinetoscope|Edison Kinetoscope]] and decided to expand the Pathé company's business to distributing [[motion picture|cinema]] projection equipment, and with the acquisition of [[Kodak|Eastman Kodak]] patent rights in Europe, a licence for film stock in theatres throughout France. Pathé films were rented out, for a maximum of four months, a more lucrative business than selling the product.&lt;ref name="Lanzoni"&gt;Lanzoni 2004, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; A modest first factory had been installed in 1896 at Vincennes. The first films of the Société Pathé Frères such as ''Le Passage à niveau à Joinville le Pont'' and ''L'Arrivée d'un train en gare de Bel-Air'' were produced, under Pathé's guidance. For several years, however, the success of the phonograph business underwrote the success of the cinema company.

On 28 December 1897, Société Pathé Frères was re-capitalised and set up as a combination of production, film laboratories, technical services and distribution of films. From 1902 to 1904, Pathé opened branches in Europe and in the United States, with their trademark Gallic cock logo created in 1905, recognized as heralding one of the world's most significant filmmakers. In 1906, Pathé Frères began to establish a global enterprise with Segundo de Chomón founded the Spanish branch in Barcelona, and four years later Pathé entered the US market with Pathé-America, based in New Jersey, branch offices in other countries followed.

From its origin, Pathé Frères began using the camera developed by [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]]' patents and then set about to design an improved studio camera and to make their own film stock.  From 1901, Pathé teamed up with director and later manager [[Ferdinand Zecca]] who oversaw the creation and production of original Pathé Frères films. From 1905 on, the company employed specialized studio staff: screenwriters, directors, cinematographers and other technicians.

Zecca explored many themes from the mundane to the fantastic. In ''[[À la conquête de l'air]]'' (1901), a strange flying machine, called ''Fend-l'air'', was seen flying over the rooftops of [[Belleville, Paris|Belleville]]. By using trick photography, the one-minute short was notable in being the first aviation film, predating the flight by the [[Wright Brothers]] by two years.&lt;ref name="Paris p. 11"&gt;Paris 1995, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Zecca had filmed an actor in the strange contraption suspended from the studio roof with the camera having half the frame blocked. The film was then rewound and the city landscape was shot in the previously blacked-out portion, creating the first split-screen effect.&lt;ref name="Paris p. 11"/&gt;|group=Note}}

Zecca also pioneered one of the first crime dramas, ''[[Histoire d'un crime (film)|Histoire d'un crime]]'' (1901), stylistically innovative in its use of superimposition. The story was of a man condemned to death, awaiting execution with his crimes appearing on his cell wall. The film is an early example of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s as a film device.&lt;ref name="altervista"&gt;[http://brevestoriadelcinema.altervista.org/4-1.html "The rise of French cinema."] ''brevestoriadelcinema''. Retrieved: 1 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Other films included comedies, trick films or fairy tales, such as ''Les Sept châteaux du Diable'', both 1901, and ''La Belle au bois dormant'' in 1902, as well as social dramas like ''Les Victimes de l'alcoolisme'' (1902), ''Au pays noir'' (1905) and reconstructions of actual events, the most famous being ''La Catastrophe de la Martinique'' (1902).&lt;ref&gt;Gordon 2002, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zecca acted in many of his films. At the end of 1906, assisted by the Spaniard Segundo de Chomón's photography and special effects, Zecca continued to experiment. He co-directed ''[[Vie et Passion du Christ|La Vie et la passion de Jésus Christ]]'' (1903), which, at a running time of 44 minutes, was one of the first feature-length films about Jesus. He started filming in colour, with second ''Vie et Passion de N.S. Jésus Christ'', shot in four parts with 38 scenes, 990 metres long, which was finished in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon 2002, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1900 and 1907, Zecca oversaw the production of hundreds of Pathé films from many important Pathé directors including Nonguet Lucien, Gaston Velle, Albert Capellani, Louis J. Gasnier, André Heuzé and Henri Pouctal. Zecca also acted, directed, produced, and, on occasion, wrote films. After Pathé bought the rights to Star films, Zecca started editing films by [[George Melies|George Méliès]]. Film production went from 70 titles in 1901 to 500 in 1903; after 1906, the mass film production gradually eased as longer films were produced.&lt;ref name="Lanzoni"/&gt;

Pathé Frères filmed numerous short subjects, the majority of which are sensational criminal adventures, melodramatic love stories, and comedies. In 1909 Pathé produced his first feature or "long film," ''Les Misérables'', a four-reel screen version of the novel by [[Victor Hugo]]. That same year he created the Pathé Gazette in France (called Pathé News in the U.S. set up in 1910 and in the U.K. (now British Pathé) in 1911), which was an internationally popular newsreel until 1956. .&lt;ref name="austin"&gt;Austin 1996, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, Pathé appointed Alfred Machin to develop the first studio films at [[Sint-Jans-Molenbeek]], Château Karreveld, Belgium. In 1914, Pathé Frères studios in the United States released the first episodes of ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|The Perils of Pauline]]'', one of the earliest and best remembered screen serials. The company also began publishing the screen magazine ''Pathé Pictorial''. When Pathé Exchange was spun off from its French parent company in 1921, with a controlling stake held by [[Merrill Lynch]], Charles Pathé stayed on as a director of the American firm.&lt;ref&gt;Mira Wilkins, ''The History of Foreign Investment in the United States, 1914–1945'', p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, Charles Pathé sold out his interest in his businesses and retired to [[Monaco]]. He died there on Christmas Day 1957, one day before his 94th birthday.

==Amalgamated places==
{{See also|Amalgamation (politics)}}
Places may be amalgamated in fiction by taking districts, [[landmark]]s, or characters of existing locations, or previously created locations of another work of fiction. Thus, a sample fictional city could contain the [[Eiffel Tower]] a block away from the [[Forbidden City]], where [[Bill Gates]] may be living after having bought a nearby [[Technology of the Discworld#The clacks|clacks]] tower from [[Albus Dumbledore]]. Usually, if the author or artist desires the city to be more [[suspension of disbelief|believable]], he or she will amalgam it only from real places, whereas if the story is more [[fantasy|fantastic]], fictional places may be better.

An author or artist may choose to amalgamate a city rather than imagining all of its aspects from scratch in order to be humorous by referencing other works and/or real places, or to avoid having to name his or her city altogether, such as when [[Filmmaking#Production|shooting]] a film in several existing cities, while the city portrayed is supposed not to exist.

Cuban culture encompasses a wide range of dance forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daniel|first1=Yvonne|title=Rumba: Dance and Social Change in Contemporary Cuba|date=1995|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, IN|page=28|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aek7fmzOnu4C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island's indigenous people performed rituals known as [[areíto]], which included dancing, although little information is known about such ceremonies. After the [[History of Cuba#Spanish conquest and early colonization|colonization of Cuba]] by the Spanish Kingdom, European dance forms were introduced such as the French [[Country dance|contredanse]], which gave rise to the Cuban [[contradanza]]. Contradanza itself spawned a series of ballroom dances between the 19th and 20th centuries, including the [[danzón]], [[mambo (dance)|mambo]] and [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|cha-cha-cha]]. Rural dances of European origin, such as the [[Zapateo (Cuba)|zapateo]] and styles associated with [[punto guajiro]] also became established by the 19th century, and in the 20th century [[son cubano|son]] became very popular. In addition, numerous dance traditions were brought by black slaves from [[West Africa]] and the [[Congo basin]], giving rise to religious dances such as [[Santería]], [[Yuka (music)|yuka]] and [[abakuá]], as well as secular forms such as [[Cuban rumba|rumba]]. Many of these dance elements from European dance and religious dances were fused together to form the basis of [[La tecnica cubana|la técnica cubana]]. Cuban music also contributed to the emergence of Latin dance styles in the [[United States]], namely [[rhumba]] (ballroom rumba) and [[Salsa (dance)|salsa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cuba and Its Music|url=http://www2.cedarcrest.edu/academic/soc/ccameron/soc215/cuba/cuba.htm|newspaper=Cedar Crest College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dance styles==

===Danzón===
[[Danzón]] is the official musical genre and dance of [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name="Urfé 1965"&gt;Urfé, Odilio 1965. ''El danzón''. La Habana.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also an active musical form in [[Mexico]] and is still beloved in [[Puerto Rico]]. The danzón evolved from the Cuban [[Habanera (music)|contradanza]] (also known as the [[habanera (music)|habanera]]). In Cuba, these dances were influenced by African rhythmic and dance styles and so became a genuine fusion of European and African influences.&lt;ref&gt;Chasteen, John Charles 2004. ''National rhythms, African roots: the deep history of Latin American popular dance''. Albuquerque, N.M. Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The danzón developed in 1879, and has been an important root for Cuban music up to today. Its precursor is the habanera, which is a creolized Cuban dance form. The danzón was developed, according to one's point of view, by either [[Manuel Saumell]]&lt;ref&gt;Carpentier, Alejo 2001 [1945]. ''Music in Cuba''. Minneapolis MN. p191&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Miguel Faílde]] in [[Matanzas]].&lt;ref&gt;Failde, Osvalde Castillo 1964. ''Miguel Faílde: créador musical del Danzón''. Consejo Nacional de Cultura, La Habana. In 1998, the province Matanzas held a festival to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Danzón.&lt;/ref&gt;

The form of danzón created by [[Miguel Faílde in 1879]] ("Las alturas de Simpson"), begins with an introduction (four bars) and ''paseo'' (four bars), which are repeated and followed by a 16-bar melody. The introduction and ''paseo'' again repeat before a second melody is played. The dancers do not dance during these sections: they choose partners, stroll onto the dance floor, and begin to dance at precisely the same moment: the fourth beat of bar four of the paseo, which has a distinctive percussion pattern that's hard to miss. When the introduction is repeated the dancers stop, chat, flirt, greet their friends, and start again, right on time as the paseo finishes.

Early danzón was played by groups called ''[[Orquesta típica|orquestas típicas]]'', which were based on wind instruments. They had several brass instruments ([[cornet]], valve [[trombone]], [[ophicleide]]), a [[clarinet]] or two, a violin or two and tympani ([[kettle drums]]). At the beginning of the 20th century, the lighter and somewhat more elegant sound of the ''[[Charanga (Cuba)|charanga]]'' emerged (see [[Early Cuban bands]]). Initially, they were small orchestra of two violins, a cello, flute, [[timbales]], [[güiro]], and [[doublebass]]. Charanga and típicas competed with each other for years, but after 1930 it was clear that the days of the típica were over.

===Mambo===
{{Main|Mambo (dance)}}
Mambo is a musical form and dance style that developed originally in Cuba, with further significant developments by Cuban musicians in Mexico and the USA.  The word "mambo" means "conversation with the gods" in [[Kikongo]], the language spoken by [[Kongo people|Kongo]] slaves taken to [[Cuba]]. Modern mambo began with a song called "Mambo" written in 1938 by brothers [[Orestes López|Orestes]] and [[Cachao López]]. The song was a  [[danzón]], a dance form descended from European [[social dance]]s like the [[English country dance]], French [[Country dance|contredanse]], and Spanish [[contradanza]]. It was backed by rhythms derived from African folk music.

===Cha-cha-cha===
{{Main|Cha-cha-cha (dance)}}
The [[cha-cha-cha (dance)|cha-cha-cha]], or simply cha-cha, is the name of a dance of Cuban origin.&lt;ref&gt;Orovio, Helio 2004. ''Cuban music from A to Z''. p50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giro, Radamés 2007. ''Diccionario enciclopédico de la música en Cuba''.
La Habana. p281&lt;/ref&gt; It  is danced to the music of the same name introduced by Cuban composer and violinist [[Enrique Jorrín]] in 1953. This rhythm was developed from the [[danzón]] by a [[syncopation]] of the fourth beat. The name is [[onomatopoeic]], derived from the rhythm of the [[güiro]] (scraper) and the shuffling of the dancers' feet.&lt;ref&gt;Jorrín, Enrique 1971. Origen del chachachá. ''Signos 3'', 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Styles of cha-cha-cha dance may differ in the place of the [[Glossary of ballroom dance terms#Chasse|chasse]] in the rhythmical structure.&lt;ref&gt;Cuban rhythms are usually scored in 2/4 time, whereas in North America the music would typically be scored in 4/4. This does not affect the sense of the text.&lt;/ref&gt; The original Cuban and the ballroom cha-cha-cha count is "two, three, chachacha" or "four-and-one, two, three". The dance does not start on the first beat of a bar, though it can start with a transfer of weight to the lead's right.&lt;ref name="Laird 2003"&gt;Laird, Walter 2003. ''The Laird Technique of Latin Dancing''. International Dance Publications Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, many social dancers count "one, two, cha-cha-cha" and may find it difficult to make the adjustment to the "correct" timing of the dance.&lt;ref&gt;The "one, two, cha-cha-cha" rhythm variant was popularized by the [[Tommy Dorsey]] Orchestra's ''Tea For Two Cha Cha''(1958), and is arguably the correct timing when dancing to such arrangements.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bolero===
The Cuban [[bolero]] dance originated in [[Santiago de Cuba]] in the last quarter of the 19th century;&lt;ref&gt;Cristobal Diaz offers 1885: "el bolero, creado aproximadamente para 1885". Diaz Ayala, Cristobal 1999. ''Cuando sali de la Habana 1898-1997: cien años de música cubana por el mundo''. 3rd ed, Cubanacán, San Juan P.R. p24-25&lt;/ref&gt; it does ''not'' owe its origin to the Spanish music and song of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;Carpentier, Alejo 2001 [1945]. ''Music in Cuba''. Minneapolis MN.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century there grew up in Santiago de Cuba a group of itinerant musicians who moved around earning their living by singing and playing the guitar.

[[Pepe Sánchez (trova)|Pepe Sánchez]] is known as the father of the ''[[trova]]'' style and the creator of the Cuban bolero. Untrained, but with remarkable natural talent, he composed numbers in his head and never wrote them down. As a result, most of these numbers are now lost, but two dozen or so survive because friends and disciples wrote them down. He was the model and teacher for the great trovadores who followed.&lt;ref&gt;Orovio, Helio 2004. ''Cuban music from A to Z.'' p195.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orovio, Helio 1995. ''El bolero latino''. La Habana.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cuban bolero has traveled to Mexico and the rest of Latin America after its conception, where it became part of their repertoires. Some of the bolero's leading composers have come from nearby countries, most especially the prolific [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rica]]n composer [[Rafael Hernández Marín|Rafael Hernández]]; another example is Mexico's [[Agustín Lara]]. Some Cuban composers of the bolero are listed under [[Trova]].&lt;ref&gt;Loyola Fernandez, Jose 1996. ''El ritmo en bolero: el bolero en la musica bailable cubana''. Huracan, Rio Piedras P.R.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orovio, Helio 1992. ''300 boleros de oro''. Mexico City.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Restrepo Duque, Hernán 1992. ''Lo que cantan los boleros''. Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rico Salazar, Jaime 1999. ''Cien años de boleros: su historia, sus compositores, sus mejores interpretes y 700 boleros inolvidables''. 5th ed, Bogotá.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Salsa===
{{Main|Salsa (dance)}}
[[Salsa dancing]] originated in New York in the mid-1970s. It evolved from earlier dance forms such as Cha cha cha and Mambo which were popular in New York, and incorporated elements of [[Swing dancing]] and [[Hustle (dance)|Hustle]], as well as elements of Afro-Cuban and Afro-Caribbean dances such as [[Guaguanco]] and [[Pachanga]]. In many styles of salsa dancing, as a dancer changes weight by stepping, the upper body remains level and nearly unaffected by the weight changes. Weight shifts cause the hips to move. Arm and shoulder movements are also incorporated. The Cuban Casino style of salsa dancing involves significant movement above the waist, with up-and-down shoulder movements and shifting of the ribcage.

The arms are used by the "lead" dancer to communicate or signal the "follower," either in "open" or "closed" position. The open position requires the two dancers to hold one or both hands, especially for moves that involve turns, putting arms behind the back, or moving around each other, to name a few examples. In the closed position, the leader puts the right hand on the follower's back, while the follower puts the left hand on the leader's shoulder.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20034">'''Documentary theatre''' is theatre that uses pre-existing [[documentary]] material (such as [[Newspaper|newspapers]], government reports, [[Interview|interviews]], journals, and correspondences) as source material for stories about real events and people, frequently without altering the text in performance. The genre typically includes or is referred to as '''verbatim theatre''', '''investigative theatre''', '''theatre of fact''', '''theatre of witness''', '''autobiographical theatre''', and '''ethnodrama'''.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Carol. ''Theatre of the Real''. Palgrave Macmillan, 2013, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Zhivaya Gazeta and Piscator ===
While fact-based drama has been traced back to Ancient Greece and [[Phrynichus (tragic poet)|Phrynichus]]' production of ''The Capture of Miletus in'' 492 BC&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kjZaAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Voicings: Ten Plays from the Documentary Theatre|last=Favorini|first=Attilio|date=1995|publisher=Ecco Press|isbn=9780880013970|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;,  contemporary documentary theatre is rooted in theatrical practices developed in [[Eastern Europe]] during the 1920s and 1930s. In the years after the [[Russian Revolution]], the USSR's Department of Agitation and Propaganda employed theatre troupes known as the Blue Blouses&lt;ref&gt;"Documentary drama and theatre." ''The Oxford Companion to Theatre and Performance.'' 2010, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; (so called because they wore factory workers' overalls) to stage current events for a largely illiterate population.&lt;ref&gt;Senelick, Laurence, and Ostrovsky, Sergei. ''The Soviet Theater: A Documentary History''. Yale University Press, 2014. 3 April 2018 &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.myilibrary.com?ID=614054&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Blue Blouse|Blue Blouses]] dramatized news items and current events through song, dance, and staging, and by 1924 these performances were standardized into the form of the ''zhivaya gazeta'' or living newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Innes, C.D. ''Erwin Piscator's Political Theatre: The Development of Modern German Drama''. CUP Archive, 1972, pp. 24&lt;/ref&gt; 

Meanwhile, in Germany, [[Erwin Piscator]] was experimenting with incorporating documentary film footage and other primary source material into his "mass spectacles"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Irmer, Thomas. “A Search for New Realities: Documentary Theatre in Germany.” ''TDR The Drama Review'', vol. 50, no. 3, 2006, pp. 16–28. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/4492692.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1925 wrote ''In Spite of Everything'', a piece derived entirely from contemporary political documents and often sited as the beginning of the first period of modern documentary drama.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Dawson, Gary Fisher. ''Documentary Theatre in the United States: An Historical Survey and Analysis of Its Content, Form, and Stagecraft.'' Greenwood Press, 1999, p. 14, 16, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; In this and other early works, Piscator sought to depict the "absolute truth"&lt;ref&gt;Piscator, Erwin. ''The Political Theatre.'' Berlin, 1929, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; and focused on the presentation of factual material in [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] and collage form rather than the internal lives of the characters.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mason |first1=Gregory |title=Documentary Drama from the Revue to the Tribunal |journal=Modern Drama |date=1977 |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=263–278 |doi=10.3138/md.20.3.263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Depression-Era America ===
[[File:WPA Federal Theater Project in New York-Living Newspaper-"AAA Plowed Under" - NARA - 195707.tif|thumb|''AAA Plowed Under'', Federal Theater Project]]
Documentary theatre spread west during the 1930s. In [[England]], the form was employed by left-leaning political theatre groups like the [[Unity Theatre, Liverpool|Unity Theatre]], which presented both documentary and historical dramas in order to expose the truths of the common man, frequently combining fiction and reality to achieve truth. Unity Theatre's documentary shows focused on the living newspaper aesthetic of Eastern Europe, although their first piece ''Busmen'' (1938) combined abstract and stylized design aesthetics culled from expressionist and constructivist genres with naturalistic dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Colin. "Unity Theatre and the Embrace of the Real." ''Get Real: Documentary Theatre Past and Present'', edited by Alison Forsyth and Chris Megson, Palgrave MacMillan, 2011, pp. 38-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the form was adapted by [[Hallie Flanagan|Hallie Flanagan Davis]] and Morris Watson into the large-scale [[Living Newspaper|Living Newspapers]] of the [[Federal Theatre Project]].&lt;ref&gt;"Living newspaper" ''The Oxford Companion to Theatre and Performance.'' 2010. {{ISBN|9780191727917}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially conceived as an "animated newsreel," the form evolved into its own theatrical genre, using spectacle and [[vaudeville]] techniques in addition to [[agitprop]] and Piscatorian conventions to tackle issues such as labor, housing, and agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nadler |first1=Paul |title=Liberty Censored: Black Living Newspapers of the Federal Theatre Project |journal=African American Review |date=1995 |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=615–622 |doi=10.2307/3042154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, they included characters like Little Man and Loudspeaker to stand in and speak for and to the audience during the action, fusing fact with dramatic symbol and clarifying the narrative arc. These plays, like later iterations of documentary theatre, were frequently communally created, often by groups of newspaper writers and theatre artists.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, John, and Brown, Lorraine. ''Free, Adult, Uncensored: The Federal Theatre Project.'' Eyre Methuen, 1980, pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the Federal Theatre Project in 1939 brought documentary theatre in the United States to a halt until the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Post-War Era and the 1970s===
While the documentary theatre of the 1930s stressed the involvement of the audience, much of the work of the 1960s into the 1970s was influenced by [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s distancing of the audience through aesthetic practices in order to question dominant ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;"Documentary Theatre." ''The Continuum Companion to Twentieth Century Theatre'', 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The work of this era focused more intensely on new or alternative perspectives of historical events by restructuring the documents to raise questions about perceived reality. In Germany, these documentary plays focused mainly on the aftermath of Nazism and genocide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many of them used transcripts from tribunals, such as ''In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer'' by Heinar Kippart and [[Peter Weiss]]' ''[[The Investigation (play)|The Investigation]].''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In his "Notes on the Contemporary Theatre," Weiss details 14 components of documentary theatre, stating that "the strength of the documentary theatre resides in its ability to arrange fragments of reality into a usable model," and that the artistic power of the genre comes from a partisan interpretation and presentation of factual material. He also detailed the sources for documentary theatre, including "minutes of proceeding, files, letters, statistical tables, stock-exchange communiques, presentations of balance-sheets of banks and industrial undertakings, official commentaries, speeches, interviews, statements by well-known personalities, press, radio, photo, or film reporting of events and all the other media bearing witness to the present."&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, Peter. "Notizen zum dokumentarischen Theater," ''Rapporte 2'', Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp Verlag, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of documentary drama was exported to [[Israel]] and the [[Middle East]] by [[Nola Chilton]], whose theatre of testimony focused on marginalized groups in the area and later influenced the work of American practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ben-Zvi |first1=Linda |title=Staging the Other Israel: The Documentary Theatre of Nola Chilton |journal=TDR |date=2006 |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=42–55 |doi=10.1162/dram.2006.50.3.42}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period of time, however, the American genre became more overtly political with plays such as [[Martin Duberman]]'s ''In White America'', a piece based in Living Newspaper techniques of narration and song, presented by the [[Free Southern Theater|Free Southern Theatre]], a company that sought to make theatre for black audiences in the south.&lt;ref&gt;Bean, Annemarie. "The Free Southern Theater: Mythology and the Moving Between Movements." ''Restaging the Sixties: Radical Theatres and Their Legacies,'' edited by James M. Harding and Cindy Rosenthal, University of Michigan, 2006, pp. 269-285.&lt;/ref&gt; Plays also became more experimental, leading to documentary-style performances, as artists like [[Joseph Chaikin]] and [[The Open Theater|The Open theatre]] used historical documents as source material for improvisations (''[[Viet Rock]]'')&lt;ref&gt;Shank, Theodore. ''American Alternative Theater.'' Grove Press Inc., 1982, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Luis Valdez]] combining verbatim text from newspapers, transcripts, and correspondence with a fictionalized story and characters in ''[[Zoot Suit (play)|Zoot Suit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Jacqueline. "Documentary Theatre and ''Zoot Suit''." ''Interrogating America through Theatre and Performance'', Palgrave MacMillan, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, meanwhile, the use of tape-recorded testimony to generate script became a hallmark of the Stoke Local Documentary Method, developed by [[Peter Cheeseman]].&lt;ref&gt;Paget, Derek. "The 'Broken Tradition' of Documentary Theatre and Its Continued Powers of Endurance." ''Get Real: Documentary Theatre Past and Present'', edited by Alison Forsyth and Chris Megson, Palgrave MacMillan, 2011, pp. 224-236.&lt;/ref&gt; In his many plays, including ''Fight for Shelton Bar'' (1977), ''Hands Up, For You the War Is Ended!'' (1971), Cheeseman focused on the exact transcription of recorded interviews, and is one of the earliest pioneers of the sub-genre verbatim theatre. The theories of Cheeseman and other British practitioners of verbatim theatre informed much of American documentary theatre of the late 20th-century.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Late 20th-century and early 21st-century ===
[[File:Laramie Project (15611763903).jpg|thumb|''The Laramie Project'']]
The focus on individuals within the context of historical events that permeated the documentary theatre of the 1960s and 1970s paved the way for artist- and individual-centric documentary theatre in the 1980s and 1990s. During this period of time, the focus shifted even further away from broad historical presentations to focus more specifically on how identity shaped personal relationships with major events. The seminal works of this period, which highlight the work of the artist as interpreter of the factual material, include one-person shows such as [[Anna Deavere Smith]]'s ''[[Fires in the Mirror]]'' (1992), collectively created shows like [[Tectonic Theater Project|Tectonic Theatre Project]]'s ''[[The Laramie Project]]'' (2000),&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Odendahl-James, Jules. "A History of U.S. Documentary Theatre in Three Stages." ''American Theatre Magazine'', August 22, 2017. https://www.americantheatre.org/2017/08/22/a-history-of-u-s-documentary-theatre-in-three-stages/&lt;/ref&gt; and playwright-driven work like Anne Nelson's ''The Guys'' (2001) and [[Jessica Blank]] and [[Erik Jensen (actor)|Erik Jensen]]'s ''[[The Exonerated (play)|The Exonerated]]'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;Collins-Hughes, Laura. "The play's the thing: the dramatic and narrative appeal of documentary theater." ''Nieman Reports'', Summer 2015, p. 8. ''Academic OneFile'', &lt;nowiki&gt;http://link.galegroup.com.ez-proxy.brooklyn.cuny.edu:2048/apps/doc/A431081527/AONE?u=cuny_broo39667&amp;sid=AONE&amp;xid=89597130&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Accessed 30 Apr. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In Eastern Europe, new German documentary theatre also focused on the importance of the artist as interpreter through the development of media-driven non-narrative creations of auteur directors like Hans-Werner Kroesinger.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Contemporary practice ==
Contemporary documentary theatre is defined by its privileging of subjectivity over universality and questioning of the definition of truth in an age where digital and physical realities collide.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Carol. "Our Reflection Talks Back." ''American Theatre Magazine'', August 22, 2017, https://www.americantheatre.org/2017/08/22/our-reflection-talks-back/&lt;/ref&gt; Many contemporary practitioners reject the term "documentary theatre" in favor of more equivocal labels like "investigative theatre" that allow for more leeway in the artistic interpretation of reality and moves away from the original concept of the artist as moral arbiter of the truth.&lt;ref&gt;Parenteau, Amelia. "How Do You Solve a Problem Like Documentary Theatre?" ''American Theatre Magazine,'' August 22, 2017, https://www.americantheatre.org/2017/08/22/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-documentary-theatre/&lt;/ref&gt; Just as Piscator utilized the new media of film and projection to enhance his productions, so contemporary documentary theatre continues to rely on new media to explore the increasingly fuzzy line between reality and representation of reality. Similarly, documentary theatre continues to rely on a democratic process of interview gathering and multiple artistic perspectives to create new narratives.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This has led to a proliferation of plays, both verbatim and fictionalized, that focus on the stories of [[Refugee|refugees]] and migrants that use interviews and workshops as the starting point for narrative plays.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffers, Alison. ''Refugees, Theatre and Crisis: Performing Global Identities''. Palgrave MacMillan, 2012, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Verbatim theatre==
'''Verbatim theatre''' is a form of documented theatre in which plays are constructed from the precise words spoken by people interviewed about a particular event or topic.

===Definition===
The playwright interviews people who are connected to the topic that is the play's focus and then uses their testimony to construct the play. In this way, the playwright seeks to present a degree of objectivity akin to that represented by news reporting. Such plays are focused on politics, disasters, sporting and other social events.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

A verbatim (word-for-word) style of theatre uses the real words from interviewees to construct the play. [[Campion Decent]], [[Australia]]n playwright and author of the verbatim theatre play ''Embers'', said it is “not written in a traditional sense… but is... conceived, collected and collated”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sydneystage.com.au/content/view/214/ |title=Embers |first=Rebecca |last=Whitton |publisher=Sydney Stage Online |date=August 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
it is a creative type of drama to help tell the story of what actually happened. Verbatim theatre exists as conceived in the United Kingdom; whereas, in the United States verbatim theatre is not distinguished and, thus, is lumped into the broader genre that is documentary theatre. Therefore, the plays, movies and TV listed below – as verbatim theatre – authored by playwrights living and writing in the United States should be considered as documentary theatre.

===History===
[[United States of America|American]] actress/playwright [[Anna Deavere Smith]] has been described as a pioneer of verbatim theatre due to two of her one-woman plays in the early 1990s: ''[[Fires in the Mirror]]'' (1992), about the 1991 [[Crown Heights riot]], and ''[[Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992]]'' (1994), about the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]]. For both plays, she conducted interviews with numerous people connected to the events, then fashioned the plays out of the interview transcripts.

High-profile pieces of verbatim theatre include ''[[The Laramie Project]]'' by [[Moises Kaufman]] &amp; [[Tectonic Theater]] and its sequel, ''[[The Laramie Project-Ten Years Later]]'', both about the murder of [[Matthew Shepard]] in Laramie, Wyoming in 1998; ''[[Talking to Terrorists]]'' by [[Robin Soans]], ''[[My Name is Rachel Corrie]]'' by [[Alan Rickman]] and [[Katharine Viner]], ''[[Deep Cut]]'' by [[Philip Ralph]] and Katharine Viner, ''[[The Permanent Way]]'' by [[David Hare (dramatist)|David Hare]] and ''[[Counted]]'' (2010) by [[LookLeftLookRight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/the-rise-of-democratic-theatre-1942833.html |title=The rise of democratic theatre |first=Emily |last=Jupp |publisher=The Independent |date=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unusually, ''[[London Road (musical)|London Road]]'' (2011) by [[Alecky Blythe]] and [[Adam Cork]], is a verbatim [[musical theatre|musical]], in which the verbatim spoken text is coupled with music composed and sung to resemble the source interviews as closely as possible.

More recent examples of political verbatim theatre are [[Tess Berry-Hart]]'s plays ''Someone To Blame'' (2012) and ''Sochi 2014'' (2014).  In ''Someone To Blame'' (about the miscarriage of justice of teenager [[Sam Hallam]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/may/16/sam-hallam-released-seven-years&lt;/ref&gt;) the words were taken solely from witness statements, court transcripts, media headlines and interviews with those involved.&lt;ref&gt;http://hackneycitizen.co.uk/2011/03/16/sam-hallam-campaigners-make-drama-of-hoxton-murder-case/&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sochi 2014'' was created from interviews with various [[LGBT]] citizens in [[Russia]] after [[Vladimir Putin]]'s anti-gay laws (see [[LGBT rights in Russia]]) in the run up to the [[2014 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/news/gay-russia-finds-a-voice-in-london-play-8793026.html&lt;/ref&gt;  

''[[Black Watch (play)|Black Watch]]'' (2006) integrates interviews taken with members of the [[Black Watch]] with dramatized versions of their stories and dance pieces. The piece originated in the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] and was created by the [[National Theatre of Scotland]] and [[Gregory Burke]]. ''[[8 (play)|8]]'', a play by [[Dustin Lance Black]], is an example that uses interviews and courtroom transcripts in order to reenact the legal argument and witness testimony of the ''[[Perry v. Schwarzenegger]]'' case.

Recorded voice delivery is an extension of verbatim theatre in which actors have recorded interviews played back to them during the performance, allowing them to directly mimic the accents and manner of speech, as well as the words, of the people they portray.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} An example is ''[[Grandpa Sol and Lily's Grandma Rosie]]'' by [[Lana Schwarcz]], in which Schwarz portrays the residents of a retirement home via puppetry and playback of interviews via [[iPod]].

In 2012, the Welsh National Theatre put on a play about money problems between the different social classes named ''sgint''. It was the first Welsh-language verbatim play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://s4c.co.uk/pethe/en/category/documentaries/ |title=Documentaries |publisher=Hafan S4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013 and again in 2014, JW3, a Jewish Cultural Centre in Finchley Road, London presented the verbatim play 'Listen, we're Family' by Matthew Lloyd and Kerry Shale. Shale played one of the roles with Debby Chazen, Jennifer Stoller, and Tom Berish.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5406">An '''Edgeworth price cycle''' is cyclical pattern in prices characterized by an initial jump, which is then followed by a slower decline back towards the initial level. The term was introduced by Maskin and Tirole (1988)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maskin|first=Eric|last2=Tirole|first2=Jean|date=1988|title=A Theory of Dynamic Oligopoly, II: Price Competition, Kinked Demand Curves, and Edgeworth Cycles|jstor=1911701|journal=Econometrica|volume=56|issue=3|pages=571–599|doi=10.2307/1911701}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a theoretical setting featuring two firms bidding sequentially and where the winner captures the full market.

== Phases of a price cycle ==

A price cycle has the following phases: 
* War of attrition: When the price is at marginal cost, the firms are engaged in a war of attrition where each firm hopes that the competitor will raise her price first ("relent"). 
* Jump: When one firm relents, the other firm will then in the next period undercut, which is when the market price jumps. This first period is the most valuable to be the low-price firm, which is what causes firms to want to stay in the war of attrition to force the competitor to jump first. 
* Undercutting: then follows a sequence where the firms take turns at undercutting each other until the market arrives back in the war of attrition at the low price.

== Discussion ==

It can be debated whether Edgeworth Cycles should be thought of as tacit collusion because it is a Markov Perfect equilibrium, but Maskin and Tirole write: ''"Thus our model can be viewed as a theory of tacit collusion."'' (p.&amp;nbsp;592).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Edgeworth cycles have been reported in gasoline markets in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2011_E000331|title=Edgeworth price cycles : The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics|website=www.dictionaryofeconomics.com|access-date=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the cycles tend to occur frequently, weekly average prices found in government reports will generally mask the cycling. Wang (2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Zhongmin|date=2009-12-01|title=(Mixed) Strategy in Oligopoly Pricing: Evidence from Gasoline Price Cycles Before and Under a Timing Regulation|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/649801|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=117|issue=6|pages=987–1030|doi=10.1086/649801|issn=0022-3808|citeseerx=10.1.1.320.9839}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizes the role of price commitment in facilitating price cycles: without price commitment, the dynamic game becomes one of simultaneous move and here, the cycles are no longer a Markov Perfect equilibrium but rely on, e.g., supergame arguments.

Edgeworth cycles are distinguished from both [[sticky pricing]] and [[cost-based pricing]].  Sticky prices are typically found in markets with less aggressive price competition, so there are fewer or no cycles.  Purely cost-based pricing occurs when retailers mark up from wholesale costs, so costs follow wholesale variations closely.

There is a separate literature, which has explored conditions under which price cycles like the ones observed gasoline markets and found that consumer search models can rationalize cycling under various conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fershtman|first=Chaim|last2=Fishman|first2=Arthur|date=1992|title=Price Cycles and Booms: Dynamic Search Equilibrium|jstor=2117475|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=82|issue=5|pages=1221–1233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tappata|first=Mariano|date=2009-12-01|title=Rockets and feathers: Understanding asymmetric pricing|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-2171.2009.00084.x/abstract|journal=The RAND Journal of Economics|language=en|volume=40|issue=4|pages=673–687|doi=10.1111/j.1756-2171.2009.00084.x|issn=1756-2171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Matthew S.|date=2011-06-01|title=Asymmetric Price Adjustment and Consumer Search: An Examination of the Retail Gasoline Market|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1530-9134.2011.00293.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Economics &amp; Management Strategy|language=en|volume=20|issue=2|pages=409–449|doi=10.1111/j.1530-9134.2011.00293.x|issn=1530-9134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the intuition is that there is a small subset of consumers that are not informed about prices and therefore will buy from a firm regardless of the price charged. Once prices get low enough, a firm may find it optimal to charge a high price and exploit this small loyal segment rather than trying to win the whole market.

Fantasma Magic supplies magic tricks, specialty magic sets and other toys to retailers such as [[Costco]], [[Toys R Us]],&lt;ref name="Ioannou 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ioannou|first1=Lori|title=Tricks To Keep Growing|journal=Time Magazine|date=March 22, 2010|volume=175|issue=11|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[K-mart]], [[Walmart]], [[Target Corporation|Target]] and others.&lt;ref name="Swiss 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swiss|first1=Amadeo|title=Fantasma: The New Wave In Magic|journal=Street Magic Magazine|date=December 2007|volume=1|issue=5|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first iteration of the Fantasma company was formed by Roger Dreyer in 1987 as a manufacturer of [[hologram]]s. This led to Fantasma manufacturing clocks and watches for [[Disney]]. In 1999, [[Foster Grant]] purchased the company.&lt;ref name="Ring2003" /&gt;

In 2001, after a stint with [[Marvin's Magic]], Dreyer partnered with Setteducati, an inventor and consultant with [[Tenyo]] and creator of [[Milton Bradley]]'s Magic Works line, to form Fantasma Magic. In February 2003, Fantasma Magic became the exclusive magic supplier to the [[FAO Schwarz]] flagship store in NYC and remained their exclusive magic supplier until FAO Schwarz closed their flagship store in July 2015.&lt;ref name="Ring2003" /&gt;

In spring of 2006, Fantasma Magic left their offices at the [[International Toy Center]] when it was revealed the Center had been sold. Fantasma opened its first retail location on the corner of 7th Avenue and 33rd Street. The store featured magic tricks and sets from Fantasma Magic as well as amateur and professional magic effects from a variety of other manufacturers. The store also housed the first [[Houdini Museum of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lombardi|first1=Nancy|title=A Serendipitous Turn Of Events|journal=Toys &amp; Family Entertainment|date=June 2006|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The store and museum have since moved to 213 West 35th Street, Rm 401, New York, NY.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hull|first1=Sarah|title=The Rough Guide to New York City|date=February 1, 2016|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London, England|isbn=9780241258439|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, Fantasma Magic reported profits of $950,000 on $10 million in sales.&lt;ref name="Ioannou 2010" /&gt; Fantasma Magic is the only magic manufacturer to receive the unpaid endorsement of the [[International Brotherhood of Magicians]].

{{nihongo|'''Karakuri puppets'''|からくり人形|karakuri ningyō}} are traditional [[Japan]]ese mechanized [[puppet]]s or [[automata]], originally made from the 17th century to 19th century. The dolls' gestures provided a form of entertainment. The word ''karakuri'' means "mechanisms" or "trick".&lt;ref&gt;Jane Marie Law, ''Puppets of Nostalgia – The Life, Death and Rebirth of the Japanese [[Awaji Ningyō-Jōruri|Awaji Ningyo]] Tradition'', 1997, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-691-02894-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to describe any device that evokes a sense of awe through concealment of its inner workings.&lt;ref&gt;Shea, Michael (2015). [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/LEON_a_00936#.VZ0zyabfjsY "Karakuri: Subtle Trickery in Device Art and Robotics Demonstrations at Miraikan"] ''Leonardo'' 48(1): 40-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three main types of karakuri exist. {{nihongo3|stage karakuri|舞台からくり|Butai karakuri}} were used in [[theatre]]. {{nihongo3|tatami room karakuri|座敷からくり|Zashiki karakuri}} were small and used in homes. {{nihongo3|festival car karakuri|山車からくり|Dashi karakuri}} were used in religious festivals, where the puppets were used to perform reenactments of traditional [[mythology|myth]]s and [[legend]]s. 

They influenced the [[Noh]], [[Kabuki]] and [[Bunraku]] theatre.

''Karakuri'' is alternatively written in Japanese [[kanji]] as {{nihongo2|絡繰り}}, {{nihongo2|絡繰}}, {{nihongo2|機巧}}, {{nihongo2|機関}}, and archaically as {{nihongo2|唐繰}}.

==Zashiki karakuri==
The most common example today of a zashiki karakuri mechanism is a tea-serving robot, which starts moving forward when a cup of tea is placed on the plate in its hands. It was used in a situation when a host wanted to treat a guest in a recreational way. It moves in a straight line for a set distance, moving its feet as if walking, and then bows its head. This signals that the tea is for drinking, and the doll stops when the cup is removed. When it is replaced, the robot raises its head, turns around and returns to where it came from. It is typically powered by a wound spring made of whalebone, and the actions are controlled by a set of cams and levers.

'''Louis Jay Pearlman''' (June 19, 1954 – August 19, 2016) was an American record producer and fraudster. He was the manager of successful 1990s [[boy band]]s such as [[Backstreet Boys]] and [[NSYNC]]. In 2006, he was accused of running one of the largest and longest-running [[Ponzi scheme]]s in history, leaving more than $300 million in debts. After being apprehended, he pleaded guilty to [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]], [[money laundering]], and [[making false statements]] during a [[bankruptcy]] proceeding. In 2008, Pearlman was convicted and sentenced to up to 25 years in prison.&lt;ref name="msnbc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN2139523420080521|title=Boy band mogul Pearlman sentenced to 25 years|last=Liston |first=Barbara|date=May 21, 2008|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=April 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/specials/2008/reports/lou-pearlman/index.shtml|title=Special report: Unraveling a transcontinental fraud|last=Huntley|first=Helen|date=|publisher=tampabay.com|accessdate=April 9, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608052006/http://www.tampabay.com/specials/2008/reports/lou-pearlman/index.shtml|archivedate=June 8, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/local/orange/orl-pearlmansg,0,2411340.storygallery|title=More coverage of the Lou Pearlman saga|last=|first=|date=|work=Orlando Sentinel|accessdate=April 9, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223033008/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/local/orange/orl-pearlmansg,0,2411340.storygallery|archivedate=December 23, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in federal custody in 2016.

==Early life==
Pearlman was born and raised in [[Flushing, New York]], the only child of [[Jews|Jewish]] parents, Hy Pearlman, who ran a dry cleaning business, and Reenie Pearlman, a school lunchroom aide. He was a first cousin of musician [[Art Garfunkel]]. His home at Mitchell Gardens Apartments was located across from [[Flushing Airport]], where he and childhood friend Alan Gross would watch [[blimp]]s take off and land. According to his autobiography, which he titled ''Bands, Brands, &amp; Billions'', it was during this period that he used his position on his school newspaper to earn credentials and get his first ride in a blimp. This is disputed by Gross, who claims he was the school reporter, and allowed Pearlman to tag along.&lt;ref name="St. Petersburg Times"&gt;[http://www.sptimes.com/2007/10/21/Business/In_humble_Queens__Lou.shtml St. Petersburg Times] By Helen Huntley, October 21, 2007 ''In humble Queens, Lou Pearlman was king''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mad About Boys"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2007/11/pearlman200711|title=Mad About the Boys|first=Vanity Fair|last=Magazine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His cousin Garfunkel's fame and wealth helped fire Pearlman's own interest in the music business. As a teenager he managed a band, but when success in music proved elusive, he turned his attention to [[aviation]]. During his first year as a student at [[Queens College]], Pearlman wrote a [[business plan]] for a class project based on the idea of a [[helicopter]] taxi service in [[New York City]]. By the late 1970s, he had launched the business based on his business plan, starting with one helicopter.{{sfn|Henderson|2006|loc=p. 174}} He persuaded German businessman Theodor Wüllenkemper to train him on blimps and subsequently spent some time at Wüllenkemper's facilities in Germany learning about the airships.

==Suspicions of insurance fraud and pump &amp; dump==
Returning to the [[United States]], Pearlman formed Airship Enterprises Ltd, which  leased a blimp to [[Jordache]] before actually owning one. He used the funds from Jordache to construct a blimp, which promptly crashed. The two parties sued each other, and seven years later Pearlman was awarded $2.5 million in damages. On the advice of a friend, Pearlman started a new company, Airship International, taking it [[Initial public offering|public]] to raise the $3 million he needed to purchase a blimp, claiming (falsely) that he had a partnership with Wüllenkemper. He leased the blimp to [[McDonald's]] for advertising.&lt;ref name="St. Petersburg Times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mad About Boys"/&gt;

He then relocated Airship International to [[Orlando, Florida]] in July 1991, where he signed [[MetLife]] and [[SeaWorld]] as clients for his blimps. Airship International suffered when one of its clients left and three of the aircraft crashed. The company's stock, which had once been pumped up to $6 a share, dropped to a price of 3 cents a share, and the company was shut down:&lt;ref name=roddyboyd&gt;[http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/orl-lou0107apr01,0,6354571.story Orlando Sentinel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005155302/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/orl-lou0107apr01,0,6354571.story |date=October 5, 2007 }} April 1, 2007 ''A world out of sync''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/seven/02222007/business/boy_band_kingpins_penny_roots_showing_business_roddy_boyd.htm ''New York Post''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224105436/http://www.nypost.com/seven/02222007/business/boy_band_kingpins_penny_roots_showing_business_roddy_boyd.htm |date=February 24, 2007 }} February 22, 2007 ''BOY BAND KINGPIN'S PENNY ROOTS SHOWING''&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|After he took his air charter company, Airship International, public in 1985, Pearlman became personally and professionally close to Jerome Rosen, a partner at small-cap trading outfit Norbay Securities. Based in Bayside, Queens, and frequently in trouble with regulators, Norbay actively traded Airship stock. This sent Airship's stock price consistently higher, enabling Pearlman to sell hundreds of thousands of shares and warrants at ever-higher prices. However, Airship was reporting little revenue, cash flow or net income. In return for keeping his [[penny stock]] liquid, Pearlman allegedly paid Rosen handsome commissions, according to a mutual friend, that reached into 'the tens of thousands of dollars' per trade.}}

==Entertainment industry career==
Pearlman became fascinated with the success of the [[New Kids on the Block]], who had made hundreds of millions of dollars in record, tour and merchandise sales. He started Trans Continental Records with the intent of mimicking their boy-band business model. The [[record label|label]]'s first band, the [[Backstreet Boys]], consisted of five unknown performers selected by Pearlman in a $3 million talent search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Gray|first=Tyler|title=The Fat Man Sings|publisher=''[[Radar Online|Radar]]''|date=October 7, 2007|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Management duties were assigned to a former New Kids on the Block manager, [[Johnny Wright (music manager)|Johnny Wright]], and his wife Donna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sptimes.com/News/102300/Floridian/The_starmaker.shtml St. Petersburg Times] The starmaker&lt;/ref&gt; The Backstreet Boys became the [[Boy band#Best-selling boy bands|best-selling boy band of all time]], with record sales of 130 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2010/02/143_61233.html|title=Backstreet Boys Share Secrets to Success|last=Garcia|first=Cathy Rose A.|work=[[The Korea Times]]|date=February 22, 2010|accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; hitting [[List of music recording sales certifications|gold, platinum, and diamond]] in 45 different countries. Pearlman and the Wright then repeated this formula almost exactly with the band [[*NSYNC]], which sold over 70 million records globally.

With these two major successes under his belt, Pearlman had become a music [[Business magnate|mogul]]. Other boy bands managed by Pearlman were [[O-Town]] (created during the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]–[[MTV]] reality TV series ''[[Making the Band]]''), [[Lyte Funky Ones|LFO]], [[Take 5 (band)|Take 5]], [[Natural (band)|Natural]] and [[US5]], as well as the girl group [[Innosense]] (with [[Britney Spears]] in the very beginning as a short-term member), co-managed with Lynn Harless (the mother of [[*NSYNC]] band member [[Justin Timberlake]]). Other artists on the Trans Continental label included [[Aaron Carter]], [[Jordan Knight]], [[Smilez &amp; Southstar]] and [[C Note (band)|C-Note]]. Pearlman also owned a large entertainment complex in Orlando, including a recording studio he called Trans Continental Studios, and a dance studio by [[Disney World]] named "O-Town."&lt;ref name="roddyboyd"/&gt; In 2002, Pearlman and Wes Smith co-wrote ''Bands, Brands and Billions: My Top 10 Rules for Making Any Business Go Platinum.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2007-04-01/news/LOU01_1_lou-pearlman-youtube-fame|title=A World Out Of Sync|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lou Pearlman also was an officer at [[Tag Entertainment|TAG Entertainment]]. This [[independent film]] company produced some low-budget, yet profitable, movies, and DVDs.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Band lawsuits===
With the exception of US5, all of the musical acts who worked with Pearlman sued him in [[United States federal courts|Federal Court]] for misrepresentation and [[fraud]]. All cases against Pearlman have either been won by those who have brought lawsuits against him, or have been settled out of court.

The members of Backstreet Boys were the first to file a lawsuit against Pearlman, feeling that their contract—under which Pearlman collected as both manager and producer—was unfair, since Pearlman was also paid as a sixth member of the Backstreet Boys (i.e., one-sixth of the band's own income). The band's dissatisfaction began when member [[Brian Littrell]] hired a lawyer to determine why the group had received only $300,000 for all of their work, while Pearlman and his record company had made millions. Fellow boy band *NSYNC was having similar issues with Pearlman, and its members soon followed suit.&lt;ref name="Mad About Boys"/&gt;

At the age of 14, pop star [[Aaron Carter]] filed a lawsuit in 2002 that accused Pearlman and Trans Continental Records of cheating him out of hundreds of thousands of dollars and of racketeering in a deliberate pattern of criminal activity. This suit was later settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/128667221.html?FMT=FT&amp;FMTS=FT&amp;PMID=33031&amp;desc=Lawsuit:+Pop+star's+manager+a+racketeer+Series:+2b ''St. Petersburg Times''] June 25, 2002.

===Talent scouting scandal===
In September 2002, Pearlman purchased Mark Tolner's internet-based talent company, ''Options Talent Group'' f/k/a ''Sector Communications,'' which had previously named ''Emodel'' and ''Studio 58'' and would then go through several names including ''Trans Continental Talent,'' ''TCT,'' ''Wilhelmina Scouting Network'' or ''WSN,'' ''Web Style Network,'' ''Fashion Rock'', and ''Talent Rock.'' Regardless of the name, all incarnations were based on the business model used by Emodel founder [[Ayman "Alec" Difrawi]] (aka Alec Defrawy), himself a convicted con-man,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secinfo.com/dRqWm.315z6.htm SEC Info Trans Continental Entertainment Group Inc – 8-K For 10/7/02] ''The SEC about the nature of the business relations between Trans Continental and Ayman "Alec" Difrawi, Ralph Edward Bell, [[Cortes Wesley Randell]] and Jason Hoffman, the felony records of Difrawi and Randell, and the FTC sanctions against Bell and Hoffman.''&lt;/ref&gt; who played a principal role in running Options / TCT / WSN&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2003-10-05/news/0310050128_1_lou-pearlman-scouting-network-wilhelmina-scouting|title=Scouting Network's History Troubles Pearlman|last=Barker |first=Tim|date=October 5, 2003|work=Orlando Sentinel|accessdate=October 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and setting up Fashion Rock.

== Ponzi scheme ==
In 2006, investigators discovered Pearlman had perpetrated a long-running Ponzi scheme that defrauded investors out of more than $300 million. For more than 20 years, Pearlman had enticed individuals and banks to invest in Trans Continental Airlines Travel Services Inc. and Trans Continental Airlines Inc., both of which existed only on paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/flm/pr/2008/March/20080304_Pearlman_Orl_FraudPleaAgg.pdf USDOJ press release March 4, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911093914/http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/flm/pr/2008/March/20080304_Pearlman_Orl_FraudPleaAgg.pdf |date=September 11, 2008 }} LOU PEARLMAN SIGNS PLEA AGREEMENT THAT INCLUDES ADDITIONAL CHARGES THAT HE DEFRAUDED INVESTORS&lt;/ref&gt; Pearlman used [[Forgery|falsified]] [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]], [[AIG]] and [[Lloyd's of London]] documents to win investors' confidence in his "Employee Investment Savings Account" program, and he used fake financial statements created by the fictitious accounting firm Cohen and Siegel to secure bank loans.&lt;ref name="Mad About Boys"/&gt;

===Investigation===
In February 2007, Florida regulators announced that Pearlman's Trans Continental Savings Program was indeed a massive fraud, and the state took possession of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wftv.com/news/10915811/detail.html |publisher=wftv.com |date=February 2, 2007 |title=State Takes Over Lou Pearlman's Embattled Orlando Company |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205041540/http://www.wftv.com/news/10915811/detail.html |archivedate=February 5, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the at least $95 million which was collected from investors was gone. Orange County Circuit Judge Renee Roche ordered Pearlman and two of his associates, Robert Fischetti and Michael Crudelle, to bring back to the United States "any assets taken abroad which were derived from illegal transactions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State: Trans Continental Savings Program a Fraud|url=http://blogs.tampabay.com/money/2007/02/state_say_trans.html|accessdate=June 29, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302010032/http://blogs.tampabay.com/money/2007/02/state_say_trans.html|archivedate=March 2, 2008|date=February 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a flight from officials over the course of which he had been reported seen in Israel and Germany, Pearlman was arrested in [[Indonesia]] on June 14, 2007 after being spotted by a [[Germany|German]] tourist couple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfnews13.com/News/Local/2007/6/14/lou_pearlman_taken_into_custody_in_indonesia.html Lou Pearlman Taken Into Custody In Indonesia]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101042618/http://www.cfnews13.com/News/Local/2007/6/14/lou_pearlman_taken_into_custody_in_indonesia.html |date=January 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was living in a tourist hotel in [[Nusa Dua]] in [[Bali]]. Pearlman had been seen in Orlando in late January 2007, in early February in Germany, including an appearance on German television on February 1. Reportedly he was also seen in Russia, Belarus, Israel, Spain, Panama, and Brazil. In early February, an attorney in Florida received a letter from Pearlman sent from Bali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://columbustelegram.com/news/boy-band-mogul-expelled-from-indonesia-in-fbi-custody/article_579af6aa-cef7-593d-9715-f256d88e2045.html|title=Boy-band mogul expelled from Indonesia, in FBI custody|first=Pedro Ruz Gutierrez, Scott Powers and Sara K.

Pearlman was then indicted by a federal grand jury on June 27, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tampabays10.com/news/local/crime/article.aspx?storyid=57854 Tampa Bay's WTSP 10 News] ''Pearlman indicted on fraud charges''&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Pearlman was charged with three counts of [[bank fraud]], one count of [[mail fraud]] and one count of [[wire fraud]].

===Conviction and sentencing===
Five days before his sentencing, Pearlman requested a telephone and an Internet connection two days a week to continue to promote bands. [[United States District Judge|U. S. District Judge]] [[G. Kendall Sharp]] rejected the request.&lt;ref name="hrep"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abramovitch|first1=Seth|title=Boy Band Mogul Lou Pearlman's Prison Interview: My Ponzi Scheme Was Smarter Than Madoff’s|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/backstreet-boys-lou-pearlmans-prison-672724|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 21, 2008, Sharp sentenced Pearlman to 25 years in prison on charges of conspiracy, money laundering, and making false statements during a bankruptcy proceeding. Pearlman could reduce his prison time by one month for every million dollars he helped a bankruptcy trustee recover. He also ordered individual investors to be paid before institutions in distributing any eventual assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23473811/|title=Boy band founder to plead guilty in $300M suit|date=March 5, 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN2139523420080521 Reuters] Boy band mogul Pearlman sentenced to 25 years&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molestation allegations==

In 2007, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine published an article "Mad About The Boys"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2007/11/pearlman200711|title=Mad About the Boys|last=Burrough|first=Bryan|access-date=2016-08-21|work=Vanity Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt; detailing extensive allegations that Pearlman molested some of his charges. Pearlman publicly addressed the allegations in a 2014 prison interview with ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' magazine, claiming they were unsubstantiated, and that he had never been accused of such by anyone he had helped succeed. ''Vanity Fair'', Pearlman claimed, had only interviewed "people that had a grudge."&lt;ref name="hrep"/&gt; ''The Hollywood Reporter'' noted Pearlman's "well-documented track record of robbing his artists blind" and rumours of his predilection for "buff, blond boys in his entourage", while a ten-year relationship with a former nurse, Tammie Hilton, remained unconsummated. "He was very religious," Hilton said.&lt;ref name="hrep"/&gt; However, in a 2009 interview with [[Howard Stern]], the former lead singer of band [[LFO (American band)|LFO]], [[Rich Cronin]], said that he had only received a fraction of the money owed to him from record sales, and claimed that Pearlman had "wanted to bang everyone", and had attempted to seduce him multiple times. Cronin also alleged that those who did oblige Pearlman were looked after.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.howardstern.com/show/2009/1/21/rich-cronin-got-pennies-RundownGalleryModel-6545/|title=Rich Cronin of LFO Visits|website=Howard Stern|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cronin's assertions were not necessarily backed by fellow band members. Brad Fischetti, who continued to refer to Lou Pearlman as a friend, expressed sadness at the news of his arrest, imprisonment, and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Brad Fischetti Comments On Former Manager Lou Pearlman’s Arrest|journal=popdirt.com|url=http://popdirt.com/tag/brad-fischetti/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fischetti|title=God rest your soul Lou Pearlman|url=https://twitter.com/bradfischetti/status/767179643690557440|agency=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of late November 2011, [[Nick Carter (musician)|Nick Carter]] had not confirmed his mother's statements regarding Pearlman, and in a later interview, when asked if true, he chose his words carefully when he spoke, but he seemed to hint that bitterness might be a motivating factor for the sexual gossip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Backstreet Boys Open Up To John Norris About Disgraced Boy-Band Mogul Lou Pearlman: 'Karma's Karma'|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1573182/backstreet-boys-open-up-john-norris-about-lou-pearlman.jhtml|newspaper=MTV|date=October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview conducted by the Orlando ''Sentinel,'' openly gay former *[[NSYNC]] member [[Lance Bass]], when asked about the ''Vanity Fair'' article, stated that Pearlman had never behaved inappropriately with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Abott|first=Jim|title=Lance Bass book comes out|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2007-10-23/news/bass23_1_lance-bass-justin-timberlake-stage-door|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|date=Oct 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
In 2008, Pearlman began his prison sentence with a projected release date of March 24, 2029. However, he suffered a [[stroke]] in 2010 while incarcerated.&lt;ref name="hrep"/&gt; Pearlman died, while still in custody at the [[Federal Correctional Institution, Miami|Federal Correctional Institution]] in [[Miami]], Florida, on August 19, 2016, from [[cardiac arrest]], that followed an infection of the interline of the heart valve. Pearlman had surgery to replace a heart valve a few weeks before his death. The prison took him to a hospital where he was scheduled for another surgery and he ultimately died. He was buried ten days later on August 29, 2016 in the family burial area.

'''Masters at Work''' is the [[garage house]] production and [[remix]] team of [[Little Louie Vega|"Little" Louie Vega]] and [[Kenny "Dope" Gonzalez]]. 

==Biography==
They first worked together using the name in 1990. Gonzalez had initially given the name to mutual friend [[Todd Terry]], who recorded several tracks under that name during the 1980s.

The duo has produced music together under the names MAW, KenLou, Sole Fusion, Hardrive, and Nuyorican Soul. The latter moniker came about in 1993, blending their residence in [[New York City]], heritage from [[Puerto Rico]], and affinity for [[soul music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/maw/biography|title=RA: Masters At Work|last=Advisor|first=Resident|website=Resident Advisor|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their Nuyorican Soul project had the duo working extensively with real  (as opposed to [[sampling (music)|sampled]] or [[Sound synthesis|synthesized]]) musicians, in a variety of styles including [[Latin American music|Latin]], [[disco]], [[jazz]], and more. Musicians who took part in this project include [[Vincent Montana Jr.]], [[Roy Ayers]], [[George Benson]], [[Jocelyn Brown]], [[Tito Puente]], and members of the [[Salsoul Orchestra]]. The self-titled album released under the name Nuyorican Soul in 1996 included original tracks as well as cover versions of songs by the performers with which the duo was working, such as "Sweet Tears" (Roy Ayers), and "[[Runaway (Nuyorican Soul song)|Runaway]]", originally sung by [[Loleatta Holloway]] with the Salsoul Orchestra, here sung by [[La India|India]] and featuring musicians from the original recording of 1977.

MAW has a history as remixers, having reproduced tracks for various acts both inside and outside the world of dance music. Some of the artists remixed by the two producers include [[Michael Jackson]], [[Janet Jackson]]. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Aaliyah]], [[Gus Gus]], [[Jody Watley]], [[Jamiroquai]], [[Earth Wind &amp; Fire]], and [[Stephanie Mills]].

'''''Mise-en-scène''''' ({{IPA-fr|miz.ɑ̃.sɛn}} "placing on stage") is an expression used to describe the [[design]] aspect of a [[theatre]] or [[film]] production, which essentially means "visual theme" or "[[storytelling|telling a story]]"—both in [[visual arts|visually artful ways]] through [[storyboarding]], [[cinematography]] and [[stage design]], and in [[narrative|poetically artful ways]] through [[film direction|direction]]. It is also commonly used to refer to single scenes within the film to represent the film. ''Mise-en-scène'' has been called [[film criticism]]'s "grand undefined term".&lt;ref&gt;Brian Henderson, "The Long Take," in ''Movies and Methods: An Anthology'', ed. Bill Nichols (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1976), 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition in film studies==
[[File:CABINET DES DR CALIGARI 01.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The distinctive ''mise-en-scène'' of ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' (Germany, 1920) features stark lighting and jagged architecture]]
When applied to the cinema, ''mise-en-scène'' refers to everything that appears before the [[camera]] and its arrangement—[[composition (visual arts)|composition]], [[Set construction|sets]], [[Theatrical properties|props]], [[actor]]s, costumes, and lighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bordwell, David |author2=Thompson, Kristin | title=Film Art: An Introduction, 7th ed. | location=New York | publisher=McGraw–Hill  | year=2003 | isbn=0-07-248455-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "mise-en-scène", along with the cinematography and editing of a film, influence the [[verisimilitude]] or believability of a film in the eyes of its viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Connell, Joanne. "Film tourism – Evolution, progress and prospects." Tourism [[Management]] (October 2012), 33 (5), pp. 1007–1029&lt;/ref&gt; The various elements of design help express a film's vision by generating a sense of time and space, as well as setting a mood, and sometimes suggesting a character's state of mind.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Barsam, Richard Meran., and Dave Monahan. Looking at Movies: An Introduction to Film. New York: W.W. Norton &amp;, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; "Mise-en-scène" also includes the composition, which consists of the positioning and movement of actors, as well as objects, in the shot.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; These are all the areas overseen by the [[Theatre director|director]]. One of the most important people that collaborates with the director is the [[production designer]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; These two work closely to perfect all of the aspects of the "mise-en-scène" a considerable amount of time before the actual photography even begins.&lt;ref name="Pramaggiore, Maria 2005"&gt;Pramaggiore, Maria, and Tom Wallis. Film: A Critical Introduction. Boston: Laurence King, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The production designer is generally responsible for the general look of the movie, leading various departments that are in charge of individual sets, locations, props, and costumes, among other things.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  [[Andre Bazin]], a well-known [[French people|French]] [[film critic]] and [[film theorist]], describes the mise-en-scene [[aesthetic]] as emphasizing choreographed movement within the scene rather than through editing.&lt;ref name="Pramaggiore, Maria 2005"/&gt;

Because of its relationship to shot blocking, ''mise-en-scène'' is also a term sometimes used among professional [[screenwriters]] to indicate descriptive (action) paragraphs between the dialog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edgar-Hunt|first=Robert, John Marland and James Richards|title=Basics Film-Making: Screenwriting|year=2009|publisher=AVA Publishing|location=Lausanne|isbn=2-940373-89-2|pages=71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jv-GsqMLs2UC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: An important element of "putting in the scene" is set design—the setting of a scene and the objects (props) visible in a scene. Set design can be used to amplify character emotion or the dominant mood, which has physical, social, psychological, emotional, economic and cultural significance in film.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; One of the most important decisions made by the [[production designer]] and director is deciding whether to shoot on location or on set. The main distinction between the two is that décor and props must be taken into consideration when shooting on set. However, shooting on set is more commonly done than shooting on location as a result of it proving to be more cost effective.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

: The intensity, direction, and quality of lighting can influence an audience's understanding of characters, actions, themes and mood.&lt;ref name="Pramaggiore, Maria 2005"/&gt; Light (and shade) can emphasize texture, shape, distance, mood, time of day or night, season, glamour; it affects the way colors are rendered, both in terms of hue and depth, and can focus attention on particular elements of the composition. Highlights, for example, call attention to shapes and textures, while shadows often conceal things, creating a sense of mystery or fear.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; For this reason, lighting must be thoroughly planned in advance to ensure its desired effect on an audience. [[Cinematographer]]s are a large part of this process, as they coordinate the camera and the lighting.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

: The representation of space affects the reading of a film. Depth, proximity, size and proportions of the places and objects in a film can be manipulated through camera placement and lenses, lighting, set design, effectively determining mood or relationships between elements in the story world.
*;[[Composition (visual arts)|Composition]]&lt;ref name="Pramaggiore, Maria 2005"/&gt;
: The organization of objects, actors and space within the frame. One of the most important concepts with the regard to the [[Digital compositing|composition]] of a film is maintaining a balance of symmetry. This refers to having an equal distribution of light, colour, and objects and/or figures in a shot. Unbalanced composition can be used to emphasize certain elements of a film that the director wishes to be given particular attention to. This tool works because audiences are more inclined to pay attention to something off balance, as it may seem abnormal. Where the director places a character can also vary depending on the importance of the role.

: There is enormous historical and cultural variation in performance styles in the cinema. In the early years of cinema, stage acting and film acting were difficult to differentiate, as most film actors had previously been stage actors and therefore knew no other method of acting.&lt;ref name="Pramaggiore, Maria 2005"/&gt;  Eventually, early melodramatic styles, clearly indebted to the 19th century theater, gave way in Western cinema to a relatively naturalistic style. This more naturalistic style of acting is largely influenced by [[Konstantin Stanislavski]]'s theory of [[method acting]], which involves the actor fully immersing themselves in their character.&lt;ref name="Pramaggiore, Maria 2005"/&gt;

[[File:Joseph Werner - Diana of Ephesus as allegory of Nature - ca. 1680.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joseph Werner]]: ''Diana of Ephesus as allegory of Nature'', c. 1680]]
'''Mother Nature''' (sometimes known as '''Mother Earth''' or the '''Earth-Mother''') is a common [[personification]] of [[nature]] that focuses on the life-giving and nurturing aspects of nature by embodying it, in the form of the [[mother]].

==Western tradition history==
[[File:Atalanta Fugiens - Emblem 2d.jpg|thumb|Mother Nature image, 17th century alchemical text, ''[[Atalanta Fugiens]]'']]
The word "nature" comes from the [[Latin]] word, "''natura''", meaning birth or character (see [[nature (innate)]]). In [[English language|English]] its first recorded use (in the sense of the entirety of the phenomena of the world) was in 1266 A.D.. "Natura", and the personification of Mother Nature, was widely popular in the [[Middle Ages]]. As a concept, seated between the properly divine and the human, it can be traced to [[Ancient Greece]], though [[Earth]] (or "''Eorthe''" in the Old English period) may have been personified as a goddess. The Norse also had a goddess called [[Jord]] (or ''Earth'').

The earliest written usage is in [[Mycenaean Greek]]- ''Ma-ka'' (transliterated as ''ma-ga''), "Mother [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]", written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script (13th or 12th century BC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&amp;wid=346416 ''Palaeolexicon;  Word Study Tool of Ancient Languages''];&lt;/ref&gt;  The various myths of nature goddesses such as [[Inanna]]/[[Ishtar]] (myths and hymns attested on [[Mesopotamia]]n tablets as early as the 3rd millennium BC) show that the personification of the creative and nurturing sides of nature as female deities has deep roots. In Greece, the pre-[[Socrates|Socratic]] philosophers had "invented" nature when they abstracted the entirety of phenomena of the world as singular: ''physis'', and this was inherited by [[Aristotle]]. Later medieval Christian thinkers did not see nature as inclusive of everything, but thought that she had been created by [[God]]; her place lay on earth, below the unchanging [[heaven]]s and [[moon]].  Nature lay somewhere in the center, with agents above her ([[angel]]s), and below her ([[demons]] and [[hell]]). For the medieval mind she was only a personification, not a goddess.

===Greek myth===
[[File:Aion mosaic Glyptothek Munich W504.jpg|thumb|200 px|[[Aion (deity)|Aion]], [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] and four children]]

In [[Greek mythology]], [[Persephone]], daughter of [[Demeter]] (goddess of the harvest), was abducted by [[Hades]] (god of the dead), and taken to the [[Greek underworld|underworld]] as his queen. Demeter was so distraught that no crops would grow and the "entire human race [would] have perished of cruel, biting hunger if [[Zeus]] had not been concerned" (Larousse 152). Zeus forced Hades to return Persephone to her mother, but while in the underworld, Persephone had eaten [[pomegranate]] seeds, the food of the dead and thus, she must spend part of each year with Hades in the underworld. Demeter's grief for her daughter in the realm of the dead, is reflected in the barren winter months and her joy when Persephone returns is reflected in the bountiful summer months.

===Ancient Rome===

Roman [[Epicurean]] poet [[Lucretius]] opens his didactic poem ''[[De rerum natura]]'' by addressing [[Venus (goddess)|Venus]] as a veritable mother of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leonard|first1=William Ellery|title=Proem {{endash}} Lucr. 1.1|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0131|website=[[Perseus Project]]|publisher=[[Tufts University]]|accessdate=February 20, 2017|date=1916}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucretius uses Venus as "a personified symbol for the generative aspect of nature".&lt;ref name=venusjournal/&gt; This largely has to do with the nature of Lucretius' work, which presents a nontheistic understanding of the world that eschews superstition.&lt;ref name=venusjournal&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0009-8353| volume = 84| issue = 2| pages = 97–104| last = Catto| first = Bonnie A.| title = Venus and Natura in Lucretius: "De Rerum Natura" 1.1-23 and 2.167-74| journal = The Classical Journal| date = 1988| jstor = 3297566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indigenous peoples of the Americas==
[[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] legend says that "beneath the clouds lives the Earth-Mother from whom is derived the Water of Life, who at her bosom feeds plants, animals and human" (Larousse 428). She is also known as [[Nokomis]], the [[Grandparent|Grandmother]].

In [[Inca mythology]], ''Mama Pacha'' or ''[[Pachamama]]'' is a fertility goddess who presides over planting and harvesting. Pachamama is usually translated as "Mother Earth" but a more literal translation would be "Mother Universe" (in [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Quechua language|Quechua]] mama = mother / pacha = world, space-time or the universe).&lt;ref&gt;Lira, Jorge A.; 1944; "'''Diccionario Kkechuwa - Español''';" Tucumán, Argentina&lt;/ref&gt; Pachamama and her husband, [[Inti]], are the most benevolent deities and are worshiped in parts of the Andean mountain ranges (stretching from present day [[Ecuador]] to [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]).

==Southeast Asia==
In the [[Southeast Asia]]n [[Indochina]] countries of [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]] and [[Thailand]], earth ([[Land mass|terra firma]]) is personified as [[Phra Mae Thorani]], but her role in [[Buddhist mythology]] differs considerably from that of Mother Nature. In the [[Malay Archipelago]], that role is filled by [[Dewi Sri]], [http://www.bartleby.com/196/98.html ''The Rice-mother in the East Indies''].

The progenitors of the pantomime horse costume were the [[centaur]] and the [[Donkey|ass]], costumes used in [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[revels]], which carried on to ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'' shows.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of the Pantomime Horse|last=Musson|first=Jeremy|work=Country Life|publisher=Country Life, Limited|year=2003|isbn=|volume=197|location=|pages=98-100}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the two-person comic variant of the horse or donkey costume was introduced in the late [[19th century]]. It remained popular throughout the mid-20th century, becoming an "icon of comedy" that entered into the British imagination and the English language.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The "grandfather" of the modern pantomime horse was the Blondin Donkey, introduced at the Royal Holborn theatre in 1885 by the acrobatic Griffiths brothers, Fred and Joe, and named after the tightrope walker who was famous for crossing [[Niagara Falls]] naked.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A different horse known as Pogo the Performing Horse and worn by a father-and-son team became a popular panto feature and appeared at the [[London Coliseum]] in 1923.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Types ==
Panto horse costumes range from low-cost, "ready-to-wear" fabric versions to more complex puppet suits that have moving features operated with special wires from within.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The most basic costumes have a sheet-like body that is draped over the wearers, while professional costumes have a closed body that often contains a padded frame to conform it to a certain shape. These costumes usually separate into two halves with a sealable seam down the middle of the body.

Other types of similar costumes include pantomime [[Cattle|cows]], [[Zebra|zebras]] and [[Camel|camels]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many modern-day pantomime horses are used in charity "horse" races,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; such as the London Pantomime Horse Race in [[Greenwich|Greenwich, London]], an annual world-famous race-day event.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

==In pop culture==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2018}}
Pantomime horses and pantomime cows feature in Christmas [[pantomime]]s, mainly in the [[United Kingdom]].  A skilled pair of performers can dance as a pantomime horse. Pantomime horses feature prominently in an episode of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' titled "[[List of Monty Python's Flying Circus episodes#4. Blood.2C Devastation.2C Death.2C War and Horror|Blood, Devastation, Death, War and Horror]]".  In the "Merchant Banker" sketch, two pantomime horses are forced to fight to the death for their job.  Another sketch features a pantomime horse as a [[James Bond]]-esque secret agent, chasing its enemy around the world in cars, rickshaws, and even riding actual horses.  The episode also features a pantomime goose and a [[pantomime dame]] [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]], which later appeared in the video for the George Harrison song "[[Crackerbox Palace]]".

A song on British pop group [[Suede (band)|Suede]]'s [[Suede (album)|eponymous debut album]] is called "Pantomime Horse".

The American late-night talk-show host [[Craig Ferguson]] has a recurring sketch with a pantomime horse named after [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]] that originally appeared every time a doorbell rang, accompanied by a frenzied dance performed by onlookers who rapidly and repeatedly extend their arms. The horse first appeared on October 11, 2010. When the program moved to a new studio, an on-set stable was built for Secretariat. This [[Secretariat (Craig Ferguson)|pantomime Secretariat]] has begun to appear on other CBS programs.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

At the start of the game, one person is designated the '[[hare]]' and everyone else in the group are the '[[hound]]s'. The 'hare' starts off ahead of everyone else leaving behind themselves a trail of paper shreds (or chalk marks in an urban environment) which represents the scent of the hare. Just as scent is carried on the wind, so too are the bits of paper, sometimes making for a difficult game. After some designated time, the hounds must chase after the hare and attempt to catch them before they reach the ending point of the race. It is generally done over a long distance, but shorter courses can be set. If the hare makes it to the finish line, they get to choose the next hare, or to be the hare themselves. Similarly, the person who catches the hare gets to choose the next hare.

==History==
A game called "Hunt the Fox" or "Hunt the Hare" had been played in English schools at least since the reign of Queen Elizabeth I.&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{cite journal | title=On the Scent of History | journal=Running Times | date=December 1998 | page=28 | first=Roger | last=Robinson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare appears to make reference to it in ''[[Hamlet]]'', when he eludes the guards at Elsinore he cries "Hide, fox, and all after".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Hamlet | at=Act IV, Scene 2 | first=William | last=Shakespeare}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1800 the game was organised at [[Shrewsbury School]] into an outdoor game called "the Hunt" or "the Hounds", to prepare the young gentlemen for their future pastime of [[fox hunting]].&lt;ref name=Robinson /&gt; The two runners making the trail with paper were called "foxes", those chasing them were called "hounds". [[Hare coursing]] rather than fox hunting was used as an analogy when the game spread to [[Bath School (England)|Bath School]], so the trail-makers were called "hares". This term was made popular by the paper chase scene in ''[[Tom Brown's School Days]]'' and is still used in modern [[Hash House Harriers|hashing]] and in club names like [[Thames Hare and Hounds]], but Shrewsbury continues to use fox hunting terms as evidenced in ''[[The Way of All Flesh]]'' by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] (see below) - "in this case the hare was a couple of boys who were called foxes". The Royal Shrewsbury School Hunt is the oldest cross-country club in the world, with written records going back to 1831 and evidence that it was established by 1819.&lt;ref name=Robinson /&gt; The club officers are the Huntsman, Senior and Junior Whips whilst the runners are Hounds, who start most races paired into "couples"; the winner of a race is said to "kill".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.shrewsbury.org.uk/page/history-tucks | title=History of The Tucks | publisher=Shrewsbury School | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main inter-house cross-country races are still called the Junior and Senior Paperchase, although no paper is dropped and urban development means the historical course can no longer be followed.

==Literary &amp; cinema references==
''[[Tom Brown's School Days]]'' by [[Thomas Hughes]] published in 1857 depicted a meet by the Big-Side Hare and Hounds. Students busily tore up old newspapers copybooks and magazines into small pieces to fill four large bags with the paper ‘scent’. Forty or fifty boys gathered and two good runners were chosen as hares who carried the bags and started across the fields laying the trail. When scent (paper) was located the member of the pack calls "Forward!" - hashers now call “ON! ON!”. Members of the pack worked together finding scent and straining to keep up.

In chapter 39 of his semi-autobiographical novel ''[[The Way of All Flesh]]'' of 1903, [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] describes a school based on his alma mater of Shrewsbury. The main protagonist's favourite recreation is running with "the Hounds" so "a run of six or seven miles across country was no more than he was used to".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter-url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2084 | title=[[The Way of All Flesh]] | chapter=39 | first=Samuel | last=Butler | authorlink=Samuel Butler (novelist) | year=1903 | publisher=Project Gutenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''[[The Railway Children]],'' written by [[Edith Nesbit]] in 1906, the children observe a game of paper chase. The book was made into a [[television series]] four times and into a [[movie]] twice, the most recent of which was in 2000.

In the novel ''[[Daddy-Long-Legs (novel)|Daddy Long Legs]],'' written in 1912 by [[Jean Webster]], the girls play a game of paper chase where the hares cheat: they leave a paper trail indicating they entered a locked barn through a high window, while in actuality they went around the building.

In by [[H.P. Lovecraft]]'s novella ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'', first published in 1936, the narrator references the game when using paper to blaze a trail through an unexplored city: "Fortunately we had a supply of extra paper to tear up, place in a spare specimen bag, and use on the ancient principle of hare and hounds for marking our course in any interior mazes we might be able to penetrate."

In the 1946 Orson Welles movie, ''[[The Stranger (1946 film)|The Stranger]],'' Rankin's students are in the midst of a paper chase through the woods as Rankin kills his former colleague. Rankin mis-directs the "hounds" to keep them from finding the body by moving the shreds of paper.

In the 1954 memoir by [[Vyvyan Holland]], ''[[Son of Oscar Wilde]],'' he describes playing paper chase at Neuenheim College in [[Heidelberg]], Germany in 1896.  "[W]hen the river was frozen and the snow lay thick upon the ground, so that it was impossible either to row or to play football, paper chases were organised by the master in charge of games.  No form of exercise is quite so utterly pointless and boring as a paper chase, and we used to try to slink off and get lost and find our way home by ourselves; though this, if discovered, was apt to lead to a painful interview with the games master."

In the 1975 Disney movie, ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]],'' the nannies notice a trail of paper scraps on the ground while trying to hide a dinosaur skeleton in a wood. They remark that it must be a paper chase at which point a group of school boys crash through the wood following the trail.

The '''Radio Club Argentino''' ('''RCA''') (in [[English language|English]], literally '''Radio Club of Argentina''') is a national [[non-profit organization]] for [[amateur radio]] enthusiasts in [[Argentina]].  RCA was founded in [[Buenos Aires]] on October 21, 1921.&lt;ref name="rca_history"&gt;Radio Club Argentino (2017). [https://www.lu4aa.org/wp/el-rca/].  Retrieved Jun. 03, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  Key membership benefits in the organization include the use of a [[QSL card|QSL]] bureau for those amateur radio operators in regular contact with amateur radio operators in other countries, a group [[insurance]] policy, and a quarterly membership journal called ''[[Revista del Radio Club Argentino]]''.  The Radio Club Argentino represents the interests of Argentine amateur radio operators before Argentine and international regulatory authorities.  It is also the national member society representing Argentina in the [[International Amateur Radio Union]].&lt;ref name="iaru"&gt;International Amateur Radio Union (2008). [http://www.iaru.org/iaru-soc.html "Member Societies"].  Retrieved Aug. 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Road Fighting Championship (Road FC)''' ([[Hangul]]: 로드FC) is a South Korea-based [[mixed martial arts]] (MMA) promotion which was officially launched in 2010.&lt;ref name="bloodyelbow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2010/10/18/1759020/road-less-traveled-koreas-newest-mma-promotion-takes-a-different-path|title=Road Less Traveled: Korea&amp;#x27;s Newest MMA Promotion Takes a Different Path |website=Bloodyelbow.com|accessdate=2014-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until December 2016, Road FC held 38 events in three countries - South Korea, Japan, and China - with a total of 456 professional MMA matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tapology.com/fightcenter/promotions/308-road-fighting-championship-rfc|title=Road Fighting Championship - RFC (Moon Hong Jung) - MMA Promoter Page |website=Tapology.com|accessdate=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== About ==
Road FC was established in 2010 to promote the sport of MMA which embodies the Asian spirit of martial arts. Over 300 athletes from South Korea, Brazil, North America, Europe, Japan, China, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East have signed agreements with Road FC. Events are being broadcast in more than 50 countries around the world, on dozens of television stations and internet platforms.

Road FC initiated its global strategy in 2015.

Road FC recognizes Asia as the global center of martial arts. In Asia, many combat sports have been born and become world-famous, such as Korea's Olympic sport [[Taekwondo]] and China's mammoth national [[Sanda (Sport)|Sanda]] competition. In the past, Asia was also the global center of MMA, where notable promotions such as [[Pride Fighting Championships|Pride]] and [[K-1]] once drew Asian crowds of 50 to 90 thousand spectators live, and broadcast live around the world. As these organizations subsided, Road FC was launched to take up the mantle in Korea.

== History ==
Road FC was founded in 2010 by Mun-Hong Jung.&lt;ref name="bloodyelbow2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2011/9/27/2426764/road-fc-moon-hong-jung-korean-asian-mma|title=Road FC Head Moon Hong Jung Talks Development of Korean and Asian MMA - Bloody Elbow|website=Bloodyelbow.com|accessdate=2014-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest MMA organization in South Korea following the closure of Spirit MC in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2016/10/20/0200000000AEN20161020007000315.html|title=(Yonhap Feature) S. Korean MMA promotions eye global presence|website=English.yonhapnews.co.kr|accessdate=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with expansion into Japan and China, one of the largest in Asia.&lt;ref name="fightsportasia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fightsportasia.com/2012/10/19/mma-and-the-possible-looming-battle-for-asia/|title=MMA and the possible looming battle for Asia ? &amp;#124; FSA - FightSport Asia|website=Fightsportasia.com|accessdate=2014-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first event, ''[[Road FC 001|Road FC 001: The Resurrection of Champions]]'', was held on October 23, 2010 in Seoul, South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tapology.com/fightcenter/events/8112-road-fc-1-the-resurrection-of-champions|title=Road FC 1: The Resurrection of Champions - MMA Event Page |website=Tapology.com|accessdate=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Road FC organized an amateur MMA competition system to encourage growth, experience, and support for the sport of MMA in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tapology.com/fightcenter/events/28687-road-fc-into-league-1|title=Road FC: Into League 1 - MMA Event Page|website=Tapology.com|accessdate=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amateur and semi-pro Central and Into Leagues provide a structured, safe, and competitive atmosphere for beginning fighters. They gain experience before transitioning into professional competition.

== Rules ==
Road FC uses the global MMA rule set.

=== Rounds ===
Non-championship bouts are two or three rounds of five minutes per round with one minute breaks in between rounds. Championship bouts are three rounds of five minutes per round with one minute breaks in between rounds.

=== Judging ===
As part of the increasing global expansion strategy, Road FC has created the "Unlimited Points System".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fight.mmashare.club/viewtopic.php?t=83860|title=ROAD FC scraps 10-point must system, implements 'Unlimited Points System' - FIGHT VIDEO FORUM|website=fight.mmashare.club|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This new judging criteria is merit-based and provide a more accurate account of a fighter's performance than the out-dated "10 point must" system. It reward exciting and aggressive fighters while penalizing those who repeatedly stall or avoid action. The "Unlimited Points System" deliver the kind of non-stop, thrilling action for which fans are now clamoring.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In this system, points be awarded for specific action and activity. One point be given for a clear strike, takedown, near submission, full mont or back mount position, clear control on the ground, and aggression. Five points be awarded for a knock down.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Penalties be assessed by the referee. A yellow card for fouls incur a five-point deduction. A blue card worth a two-point deduction be introduced for the purpose of eliminating stalling and avoidance, standing and on the ground.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Cage ===
The Road FC stages bouts in an eight-sided enclosure named "Case".

The Road FC cage is an octagonal structure with walls of metal chain-link fence coated with black vinyl. The standard octagon has a diameter of 9&amp;nbsp;m (29.5&amp;nbsp;ft) with a 1.8&amp;nbsp;m (6&amp;nbsp;ft) high fence. The cage sits atop a platform, raising it 1.2&amp;nbsp;m (4&amp;nbsp;ft) from the ground. It has foam padding around the top of the fence and between each of the eight sections. It also has two entry-exit gates opposite each other.The mat, painted with sponsorship logos and art, is replaced for each event.

=== Attire ===
All competitors fight in approved shorts, without shoes. Tops are only approved for female competitors. Required safety equipment include padded gloves, mouthguard, and protective cups held in place.

=== Match outcome ===
Matches may end via:
* '''[[Submission (combat sport term)|Submission]]''': a fighter clearly taps the mat or his opponent, verbally submits, or clearly communicates being in pain (such as by yelling) to a degree that causes the referee to stop the fight. Also, a technical submission may be called when a fighter either loses consciousness or is on the verge of or suffers serious injury while in a hold.
* '''[[Knockout]]''': a fighter is put into a state of unconsciousness resulting from any legal strike.
* '''[[Technical Knockout]]''' (TKO): If the referee decides a fighter cannot continue, the fight is ruled as a technical knockout. Technical knockouts can be classified into three categories:
** referee stoppage (the referee ends the fight because one fighter is deemed unable to intelligently defend himself)
** doctor stoppage (a ring side doctor decides that it is unsafe for one fighter to continue the bout, due to excessive bleeding or physical injuries)
** corner stoppage (a fighter's cornerman signals defeat for his own fighter)
* '''Judges' Decision''': Depending on scoring, a match may end as:
** unanimous decision (all three judges score a win for fighter A)
** majority decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a draw)
** split decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B)
** technical decision (a fighter is rendered unable to continue as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move, resulting in a decision based on the finished and unfinished rounds if the number of rounds to be judged is sufficient)
** unanimous draw (all three judges score a draw)
** majority draw (two judges score a draw, one judge scoring a win)
** split draw (one judge scores a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B, and one judge scores a draw)
** technical draw (the bout ends in a manner similar to that of a technical decision, with the judges' scores resulting in a draw)
* '''Disqualification''': a fighter intentionally executes an illegal move that is considered by the referee or opponent to be injurious or significant enough to negatively alter the opponent's performance should the fight continue, resulting in the opponent's victory.
* '''Forfeit''': a fighter fails to compete or intentionally and prematurely ends the bout for a reason besides injury, resulting in the opponent's victory.
* '''No Contest''': a fighter is rendered unable to continue or compete effectively as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move and there is not a sufficient number of finished rounds to be judged to make a technical decision viable, or both fighters are rendered unable to continue or compete effectively. Also, a fight may be ruled a no contest if the original outcome of the bout is changed due to unsatisfactory or illegal circumstances, such as a premature stoppage or a fighter's testing positive for banned substances.

'''''Screamer''''' is an arcade style racing game for [[MS-DOS]].

==Gameplay==
The game shares some graphical and gameplay style with [[Namco]]'s ''[[Ridge Racer (video game)|Ridge Racer]]''. The game features [[Texture mapping|texture mapped]] [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygon]]-modelled tracks and cars.

==Development==
[[Software rendering]] is used in the game, due to the game's release before the widespread adoption of [[Graphics processing unit|3D graphics cards]], unlike ''Screamer''{{'}}s three sequels ''[[Screamer 2]]'', ''[[Screamer Rally]]'' and ''[[Screamer 4x4]]'', that all utilized 3D hardware (in the case of ''Screamer 2'', after a [[Patch (computing)|patch]] was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.patches-scrolls.com/whatsold1997.php | title=The Patches Scrolls  - Archives 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, ''Screamer'' was one of the early games to really require a [[Pentium]] processor to run at full speed, particularly in [[Super Video Graphics Array|SVGA]] mode.

[[Electronic Arts|EA]]'s racing title ''[[The Need for Speed (video game)|The Need for Speed]]'' was released on the [[IBM PC compatible|PC]] around the same time as ''Screamer''.

The game's music was composed by [[Allister Brimble]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orchestralmedia.co.uk/OrchestralMediaPortfolio.pdf |format=PDF| title=Orchestral Media Portfolio | accessdate = 2008-08-02 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060205051727/http://www.orchestralmedia.co.uk/OrchestralMediaPortfolio.pdf |archivedate = February 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
A reviewer for ''Maximum'' commended the game for its high speed, replay sequences, smoothly scrolling graphics, selection of vehicles, numerous modes and options, overall high longevity, and low price point. He noted that the computer-controlled opponents follow a fixed course, and would even crash full speed into the player car rather than deviate from that course, but did not feel this was a bad thing. He gave the game 5 out of 5 stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Maximum Reviews: Screamer|magazine=Maximum: The Video Game Magazine|issue=2 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=November 1995|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reviewer for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' was also pleased with the graphics, selection of vehicles, and numerous modes. He praised the game for being more accessible than most racers, allowing players to begin racing without having to figure out the car's technical aspects, though he also criticized it as being "simplistic". He scored it 4 out of 5 stars, concluding that "There may not be a lot to it, but the graphics, playability, and selection of cars with their different qualities make it a title worthy of a look."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Screamer |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=17|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=May 1996|pages=98, 101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The editors of ''[[Computer Games Magazine]]'' nominated ''Screamer'' as the best racing game of 2001, but ultimately gave the award to ''[[NASCAR Racing 4]]''.&lt;ref name=cgm11th&gt;{{cite journal | author=Staff | journal=[[Computer Games Magazine]] | title=11th Annual ''Computer Games'' Awards |date=March 2002 | issue=136 | pages=50–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An advertisement for the game, showing a burnt-out car wreckage with the slogan "Every Christmas the roads are full of mad men. Join them.", aroused public outcry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Videogames Continue to Shock the System |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=27|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=March 1997|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The End of Violence''''' is a 1997 film by the [[German people|German]] director [[Wim Wenders]]. The film's cast includes [[Bill Pullman]], [[Andie MacDowell]], [[Gabriel Byrne]], [[Traci Lind]], [[Rosalind Chao]], and [[Loren Dean]], among others. It also features a soundtrack marked with the signature sounds of Wenders regulars [[Jon Hassell]], [[Ry Cooder]], and [[Bono]]. The film was praised by a select few critics for its [[cinematography]], but performed poorly in the [[box office]]. It was entered into the [[1997 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4798/year/1997.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The End of Violence |accessdate=2009-09-21|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movie had a budget of $5 million, but only received $386,673 in its domestic box office.

Like many other of Wenders' American movies, the film was shot in multiple locations, for instance the [[Griffith Observatory]] in [[Griffith Park]] and the [[Santa Monica Pier]].

A scene in the film shows a live recreation of the painting ''[[Nighthawks]]'' by [[Edward Hopper]].

==Synopsis==
Movie producer Mike Max meditates on the paranoia of fear of attack, in the movie business and life in general, as his wife Page announces she is leaving him. He receives a document via email from a NASA employee he met earlier at a conference. Before opening it he is kidnapped and almost killed, a scene captured by surveillance cameras and witnessed by computer scientist Ray Bering on  surveillance footage scene in his laboratory at the Griffith Observatory.  However, it soon turns out the two men have been shot, Max has escaped and now is accused of killing them. He takes shelter with, and goes to work for, the Mexican gardeners who find him and they help him investigate who is trying to kill him and why. Bering, who originally sent Max the email and recognized Max in the surveillance footage, has a conversation with an intelligence agent who makes it clear that anyone who gets in the way of a new “anti-crime” satellite surveillance program not yet approved by Congress will be dealt with terminally. Detective Dean Brock suspects Max is not a killer and on a tip meets with Bering, who is assassinated by a gunshot as they begin to speak. Max gives up his business and money to his wife and the movie ends as he meditates on how a real attack has freed him from paranoia.

==Reception==
''The End of Violence'' received some negative reviews from critics. It currently holds a 29% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 34 reviews. Writing in [[Time Out New York]], [[Andrew Johnston (critic)]] observed: "Many of Wenders's best films have been road movies and ''Violence'' qualifies as one thanks to all the time the characters spend on L.A.'s freeways. Like Robert Altman's ''Short Cuts'' (which it resembles in a lot of ways), it cleverly exploits its Southern California locale and offers a truly challenging analysis of American life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Andrew|date=September 11-18, 1997|title=The End of Violence|url=|journal=Time Out New York|volume=|pages=81|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tokyo Comedy Store''' ('''TCS''') is an English-language comedy show held in central [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], which features [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedians]] and improvised comedy.

The Tokyo Comedy Store was founded in 1994 as the "Tokyo Comedy Club" by Kevin Burns. Burns gathered together stand-up comics and a hypnotist by placing many ads in the ''Tokyo Classifieds'' (now called ''The Metropolis''), calling for performers. The first show was held at the Tokyo American Club, and the second at the British Club in Ebisu, Tokyo. Roughly around the same time a separate group called the Tokyo Cynics started an all stand-up comedy show in the Takadanobaba area at a bar called The Fiddler.

By about 1998, Burns was no longer involved, and from that time up until the mid-2000s the group was run first by Nick Abrahams, then Michael Naishtut, who had been independently performing improv comedy in Tokyo, and Chris Wells, one of the founding members of TCS. Naishtut was also hosting the "Tokyo Cynics" shows, and the two groups were effectively merged. Around the same time, the name was changed to the "Tokyo Comedy Store".

Since then, the Tokyo Comedy Store has held multiple shows every month at various venues. Venues come and go, and so over the year shows have come and gone, or moved locations, but there are usually between three and six shows running at any one time. Some shows involve stand-up, some involve improv, and some involve both. The cornerstone show is held on the last Friday of every month and features stand-up comedians in the first half. The second half of the show consists of entirely improvised comedy by "Spontaneous Confabulation" (known as "Spontaneous Confusion" until 2010), the resident improv troupe. The show usually ends with music-based improvisation.

Currently the titular head of the Tokyo Comedy Store is Chris Wells, who also runs the cornerstone show at the Crocodile live-house in Shibuya, attracting audiences of around 100, the vast majority of whom are non-Japanese. Other shows around Tokyo are organized by Dave Gutteridge, who since the early 2000s has been a show runner, performer, and administrator of the website.

At about the same time the Tokyo Comedy Store was first founded, Jun Imai started to teach improvisation classes for Japanese performers and stage improv performances as "in the moment". In 2004, he brought the In The Moment improv troupe to TCS and produced the first ITM + TCS shows, which were based entirely on improvised comedy. These became known as TCSj (Tokyo Comedy Store Japanese), and the group performed twice a month in the same venue as the English version through 2011. TCSj cut down on their shows in 2012, and now perform several times a year at the Crocodile and other venues.  Although it features the same type of improvised scenes as the English show does, it has several different show formats with different casts. Currently TCSj has a cast of over 40 improvisors.

== ''Tokyo Comedy Store'' film ==
A [[documentary film]] about the Tokyo Comedy Store was made and released on {{coord missing|Tokyo}}[[DOC: The Documentary Channel]] in 2008. The film is a narrative account of director Brian C. Anderson's experience performing with the stand-up comedians of the Tokyo Comedy Store.  Anderson's film explores the differences between Eastern and Western styles of comedy, and showcases various acts he encounters as he progresses as a stand-up comedian in Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|tt1283964}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anderson made the film while stationed overseas in the [[United States Air Force]].

But not until 2014 a new law was passed to make the network an independent, public broadcaster.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/ukraine-press-state-broadcaster-television-politicians-oligarchs-a7452586.html Ukraine is on the brink of media freedom, but oligarchs are set to put a stop to it], [[independent.co.uk]] (2 December 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; With the creation of this National Public Broadcasting Company of Ukraine in 2015 the [[National Radio Company]] of Ukraine merged into this new company.&lt;ref name="Poroshenko signs law on public broadcasting company"&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/259522.html Poroshenko signs law on public broadcasting company], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (8 April 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; It, (renamed) the ''National Public Broadcasting Company of Ukraine'', was registered on 19 January 2017.&lt;ref name="NPBCU19117"/&gt;

A '''utility sound technician''', also referred to as '''sound assistant''',  '''sound maintenance''' or '''cableperson''' is an assistant to both the [[production sound mixer]] and the [[Boom operator (media)|boom operator]] on a film or television set.  Although sometimes the utility pulls cable, he or she is more than just a cableperson.  The utility is a [[Jack of all trades, master of none|jack of all trades]], assisting in setting up, operating and maintaining the running order of equipment, often acting as a second boom operator, or even second mixer, and also repairing and servicing equipment such as cables and hardware as necessary. As both mixer and boom operator(s) may be busy with their tasks at any given time, the utility may also apply or adjust personal microphones or actors' wireless transmitters, may move microphones or assist in running cables, and may liaise with other departments on issues such as noise minimisation and set lockdown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidejobs.com/careers/utility-sound-technician insidejobs.com, What do Utility Sound Technicians do?]&lt;/ref&gt;

A utility may start their career as some form of trainee and move on to utility as their competency increases, or may start as a utility if their experience and knowledge permits. Utilities typically move on to become boom operators or mixers themselves, taking over roles in the sound department previously held by their superiors. In studio based television production, the route for promotion from sound assistant is to sound technician/operator, and finally to sound supervisor. Formal qualifications are not specified for technicians in studio environments, although employers typically look for basic numeracy and literacy, and a solid foundation in maths and physics. Many applicants have A levels/H grades or have taken courses to certificate, diploma or degree level, such as ft2 (Freelance Film and Television Training). As the film and big budget narrative television industries are typically less corporate in nature than studio based television, utility technicians may have no training other than their experience from simply working in the sound department.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stardustfilm.com/Articles/mark%20ulano-u_s_t.htm stardustfilm.com, The Utility Sound Technician, written by Mark Ulano]&lt;/ref&gt;

A utility sound technician typical makes between $20-$60 an hour with overtime after 8 hours and double time after 12 hours. This varies depending on their exact role and production budget. Usually the production sound mixer will hire boom operator(s) and utility technicians that they know and trust, although one may be provided by the production in some cases.

'''Write-only memory''' ('''WOM''') is the opposite of [[read-only memory]] (ROM). By some definitions, a WOM is a memory device which can be written but never read. Initially there seemed to be no practical use for a memory circuit from which data could not be retrieved. The concept is still often used as a [[joke]] or a [[euphemism]] for a failed memory device. 

The first use of the term is generally attributed to [[Signetics]] in 1972.  Signetics published some ''write-only memory'' literature as the result of an inside practical joke, which is frequently referenced within the electronics industry,&lt;ref name="origin"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://portal.national.com/rap/Story/WOMorigin.html | title = The origin of the WOM – the "Write Only Memory" | first = Robert A | last = Pease | author-link = Bob Pease | publisher = National Semiconductor | accessdate = 2011-11-28 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6AxYMnQNI?url=http://portal.national.com/rap/Story/WOMorigin.html | archivedate = 26 September 2012 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/2011-04/02/content_12268630.htm | title = Are you fooled? | work = China Daily | date = 2011-04-02 | accessdate = 2011-11-28}} &lt;/ref&gt; a staple of software engineering lexicons,&lt;ref name = Jargon&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl = http://www.retrologic.com/jargon/W/write-only-memory.html | accessdate = 2011-11-28 | archivedate = 24 November 2006 | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/W/write-only-memory.html | title =write-only memory|work = The [[Jargon File]] | publisher = CatB | editor-link = Eric S. Raymond | editor-last = Raymond | editor-first = Eric S}}&lt;/ref&gt; and included in collections of the best hoaxes.

==Signetics==
The datasheet was created "as a lark"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url = http://www.sigwom.com/?page_id=17 |title = Sigwom}}.&lt;/ref&gt; by Signetics engineer John G 'Jack' Curtis&lt;ref name = Sigwom&gt;{{Citation |url = http://www.sigwom.com/ |title = Sigwom }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was inspired by a fictitious and humorous vacuum tube datasheet&lt;ref&gt;''Wemac 1Z2Z Slightly Tentative Data'', Eitel-McCullough, Inc. 1953, itself a successor to ''Umac 606 Infernal Anode Phantasatron Data Sheet'', Eitel-McCullough, Inc., 1950, both referenced on [http://www.sigwom.com/?p=186 "Wemac 1Z2Z Data Sheet", sigwom.com]. Note the reference to 'encabulitzation' in the 1Z2Z data sheet.&lt;/ref&gt; from the 1940s. It was seen as "an icebreaker" and was deliberately included in the Signetics catalog.&lt;ref name = Sigwom /&gt;

Roy L Twitty, a Signetics PR person, released a tongue-in-cheek press release touting the WOM on April 1, 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url= http://www.ariplex.com/tina/tsignet1.htm |editor = Tina |title = Funny pages |contribution = The original papers on the invention of the best electro… }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of the more conventional characteristic curves, the 25120 "fully encoded, 9046×N, Random Access, write-only-memory" data sheet included meaningless diagrams of "bit capacity vs. Temp.", "Iff vs. Vff", "Number of pins remaining vs. number of socket insertions", and "[[Acceptable quality limit|AQL]] vs. selling price". The 25120 required a 6.3 VAC V&lt;sub&gt;ff&lt;/sub&gt; ([[vacuum tube]] filament) supply, a +10&amp;nbsp;V&lt;sub&gt;cc&lt;/sub&gt; (double the V&lt;sub&gt;cc&lt;/sub&gt; of standard [[Transistor-transistor logic|TTL]] logic of the day), and V&lt;sub&gt;dd&lt;/sub&gt; of 0±2% volt (i.e. ground). It was specified to run between 0 and −70°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Signetics |url=http://www.national.com/rap/files/datasheet.pdf |title=Signetics 25120 Fully Encoded, 9046xN, Random Access Write-Only-Memory |first=John G ‘Jack’ |last=Curtis |year=1972 |accessdate=2012-03-16 |type=photocopy |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316141638/http://www.national.com/rap/files/datasheet.pdf |archivedate=March 16, 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apple==
In 1982, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] published their official ''Apple IIe Reference Manual'' (part number A2L2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url = https://archive.org/details/a2_reference_manual |title = Apple IIe Reference Manual |publisher = Apple Computer |year = 1982 |id = part number A2L2005}}, 266 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; which included two references to write-only memory:

On page 233:
* ''[[bit bucket]]:'' The final resting place of all information; see ''write-only memory''.

On page 250:
* ''write-only memory:'' A form of computer memory into which information can be stored but never, ever retrieved, developed under government contract in 1975 by Professor Homberg T. Farnsfarfle. Farnsfarfle's original prototype, approximately one inch on each side, has so far been used to store more than 100 trillion words of surplus federal information. Farnsfarfle's critics have denounced his project as a six-million-[[dollar]] boondoggle, but his defenders point out that this excess information would have cost more than 250 [[billion]] dollars to store in conventional media.

==Book==
In 1995 ''[[Computer Contradictionary]]'' book, it reports EWOM, or Erasable Write-Only Memory (an analogy of [[EPROM]]), a memory copyrighted by IBM (Irish Business Machines), which allows the data to be written into and then erased from, for memory re-use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tZKCZje8178C&amp;pg=PA69 |title = EWOM |format = Google books |page = 69 |isbn = 9780262611121 |author1 = Kelly-Bootle |first1 = Stan |year = 1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the explosive growth of the amount of video data available both online and in private use, there emerged a common joke that [[video tape]]s and other video media are "write only memory", because without efficient means of search and retrieval for video data archives, very little is viewed after recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dRn5-nSYMwwC&amp;pg=PA49 |title = Advances in Visual Information Systems: 4th International Conference, VISUAL. |format = Google books |page = 49 |isbn = 9783540411772 |author1 = Laurini |first1 = Robert |date = 2000-10-18}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Fqk-eKrlFHkC&amp;pg=PA61 |title =Forensic Digital Imaging and Photography |first1 = Herbert L |last1 = Blitzer |first2 = Jack |last2 = Jacobia |format = Google books |page = 61 |isbn =9780121064112 |year =2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other members of the family==

The 25120 WOM joined a family of equally-useless parts made before and since.  These include the dark bulb, dark-emitting diode, WAS gate, and Inoperational Amplifier.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.edn.com/electronics-products/electronic-product-reviews/reader-s-choice-2015/4439097/Zener-enhanced-Dark-Emitting-Diodes--ZeDEDs--deliver-10X-more-Dark-Flux-Watt&lt;/ref&gt;  Grandparents were the Umac 606 Infernal Anode Phantasatron and the Electrovoice Rearaxial Softspeaker.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tubecollectors.org/archives/606.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steamer.mindfart.com/|title=Electro-Voice SP13.5RBXWK Rearaxial Softspeaker|website=steamer.mindfart.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the [[Phantastron]] (not Phantasatron) is a real, if obsolete, circuit for generating precision sawtooth waves.
