==Establishment==
A team of young, international volunteers founded "Agua del Pueblo" in 1972 in [[San Lucas Tolimán]], [[Sololá Department|Sololá]], Guatemala. Agua del Pueblo (AdP) is a private, [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]], non-denominational organization.&lt;ref&gt;Clemens, B, Andrew Karp &amp; Maria Papadakis. 2002.

What role does health play? Organization Management Journal. 9(2): 83-89. DOI:10.1080/15416518.2012.687988&lt;/ref&gt;  Agua del Pueblo's headquarters is in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala, and has regional offices in Coban Alta Verapaz and Poptun, Peten.

== Mission==
AdP's prime directive is to promote, advise, direct and generate financing for non-profit activities related to community development and the introduction of potable water, latrines and other aspects of environmental sanitation in rural and urban communities.  AdP’s aims are to: a) Build potable water and sanitation systems; b) Promote rural and urban development. c) Cooperate with any organization in drinking water, sanitation, education and community development, including training of appropriate personnel. d) Research the impacts of such projects on public health and economic development and e) Participate in international, state, municipal or private projects with similar goals.

AdP focuses on the poorest of the poor throughout the highlands of Mayan Guatemala.  For that reason, AdP’s board prioritized the departments of San Marcos, Huehuetenango, Quiché, Totonicapan, Quetzaltenango, Solola, Retalhuleu, Suchitepequez, Chimaltenango, Alta Verapaz, Baja Verapaz and Peten.  AdP views water and sanitation projects as a means to the end of conscious-level raising and rural development.  AdP favors projects based on renewable energy with minimal operation and maintenance requirements.  Education and community organization form the foundation of AdP’s work. 

The Guatemalan government incorporated the Association of Agua del Pueblo on May 22, 1981 and registered the Association on 6 July 1981.  The Guatemalan “Association of Agua del Pueblo” is included in the Registry of the Municipality of Quetzaltenango, Guatemala, Book 1 NGO.

The State of Missouri (USA) incorporated [http://www.peopleswater.org People’s Consultants – Agua del Pueblo-USA] (web site) in 1973.  AdP’S founders established the People’s Consultants to support AdP’s work around the world.  The US Internal Revenue Service recognizes the People’s Consultants as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.

==History==
In 1972, volunteers from the [http://www.sanlucasmission.org San Lucas Mission], the Maryknoll’s (Father Bill Woods and Dave Hennessey’s) Ixcan Project and San Carlos University’s school of social work (Dr. Sayra Cabrera) founded Agua del Pueblo.  Father John Goggin sponsored AdP’s first water project in Tzalamabaj, San Lucas Toliman.  Sr. Benito Pic directed the project.  Sr. Pic’s son, Don Oscar Pic Solís, eventually became the first re-elected mayor of San Lucas Toliman.

[http://www.startribune.com/obituary-st-paul-native-gregory-schaffer-gave-life-to-guatemala/156834445/ Monsenor Gregory Schaffer] led AdP’s next project in Pampojila and Panimaquib&lt;ref&gt;Karp, Cabrera &amp; Cabrera Waterlines 17(3):19-20 · December 1998 DOI: 10.3362/0262-8104.1999.008&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the first rural pumping water supply project in Guatemala (Karp, Cabrera and Cabrera).  The project had a significant impact on improving the plight of indentured servants in Guatemala’s south coast.  Sr. Andres Tos Toy led the first successful strike against a large absentee landlord (Don Oscar Dias, owner of San Andres Pampojila).

==Accomplishments==
Agua del Pueblo has:

* Built more than 900 drinking water projects with a comprehensive methodology, sanitation and community education.
* Built more than 25,000 sanitary excreta disposal solutions.
* Developed micro-irrigation projects that focus on food autonomy.

'''''All Saints''''' is an [[Television in Australia|Australian television]] medical drama that first screened on the [[Seven Network]] on 24 February 1998. Set in the fictional All Saints Western General Hospital, it focused on the staff of Ward 17 until its closure in 2004, which is when the focus changed and began following the staff of the Emergency Department. It was produced by John Holmes alongside Jo Porter, MaryAnne Carroll and Di Drew. The final episode aired on 27 October 2009, completing its recording-breaking 12-year run.

== Plot ==
''All Saints'' follows the lives of the staff at All Saints Western General Hospital. Until its closure in 2004, the show primarily focused on the staff in Ward 17. Known as the "garbage ward" as it took all the overflow from the other wards, Ward 17 was run by compassionate nun, Sister Terri Sullivan ([[Georgie Parker]]). Her staff included her nurses Connor Costello ([[Jeremy Cumpston]]), Von Ryan ([[Judith McGrath]]), Bronwyn Craig ([[Libby Tanner]]), Jared Levine ([[Ben Tari]]) and Stephanie Markham ([[Kirrily White]]) and her ward clerk Jaz Hillerman ([[Sam Healy]]). Luke Forlano ([[Martin Lynes]]) and Peter Morrison ([[Andrew McKaige]]) were doctors who frequently worked with Terri and her staff. Ben Markham ([[Brian Vriends]]) was an ambulance officer who worked closely with Luke, despite their rivalry. Bronwyn left Ward 17 and became an ambulance officer at the end of 1998 but returned to the ward full-time at the end of season 3.

== Production ==
After the death of Dr. Mitch Stevens ([[Erik Thomson]]) and the departure of Bron Craig ([[Libby Tanner]]) in 2003, the producers decided to do something in response to considerable drop in ratings and to prolong the life of the series.&lt;ref name="ED"/&gt;

In February 2004, John Holmes told [[The Age]] journalist Debi Enker that ''All Saints'' would be undergoing "major surgery" when the focus shifted from Ward 17 to the Emergency Department. He also stated that while four familiar faces will be leaving, new characters will be introduced to fill the void. Holmes recalled a statement that he made in May 2003 in which he said, "we [myself and Seven script executive Bevan Lee] were seeing the scripts and watching episodes and we were feeling that there was a little bit of a sameness in it. We started to think, 'Don't know about this. Sixth year. Maybe we've had a few too many people through the door of Ward 17 on a trolley and had the 'Hi, I'm Von, I'm your nurse. Room Three, thanks Sterlo.'" After tossing up between cancelling the show and using it as the foundation of a spin-off series, Holmes and Lee decided to rejuvenate the show by changing the setting. Ward 17 would then close and the show would be relocated to the Emergency Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australiantelevision.net/as/articles/extrememakeover.html|title=''All Saints'' gets an extreme makeover|publisher=Australian Television Information Archive|work=[[The Age]]|last=Enker|first=Debi|date=19 February 2004|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the shift, several cast members decided to leave the show. Paula Morgan ([[Jenni Baird]]), Luke Forlano ([[Martin Lynes]]), Alex Kearns ([[Fletcher Humphrys]]) and Sterling McCormack ([[Henry Nixon]]) were all written out of the show. Former ''[[Always Greener]]'' star [[John Howard (Australian actor)|John Howard]] signed a three-year deal and was added to the cast as the cranky head of Emergency, Dr. Frank Campion. Other new faces included [[Wil Traval]] as Dr. Jack Quade, [[Mark Priestley]] and [[Natalie Saleeba]] as nurses Dan Goldman and Jessica Singleton and [[Alexandra Davies]] as ambulance officer Cate McMasters.&lt;ref name="ED"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australiantelevision.net/as/articles/fourstarsdumped.html|title=Four ''All Saints'' stars dumped|publisher=Australian Television Information Archive|work=[[The Herald Sun]]|last=Byrne|first=Fiona|date=23 November 2003|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 another attempt to stem the softening ratings and add a bit of excitement to the series, [[Seven Network]] executives decided to rejuvenate again, introducing a medical response unit to deal with tricky rescues which involved a helicopter going to remote locations to rescue patients who needed assistance. They would then bring those patients back to the ED and the staff there would assist in their treatment. Along with the addition of the new "department" the show was also renamed to ''All Saints: Medical Response Unit'', the introduction of [[Mirrah Foulkes]] and the new MRU proved to lift the ratings substantially, but then levelled out at where they were prior to the revamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australiantelevision.net/as/articles/trioaddenergy.html|title=MRU trio add energy injection to ''All Saints''|publisher=Australian Television Information Archive|work=[[The Courier Mail]]|last=McWhirter|first=Erin|date=20 January 2009|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, after months of rumours that the cancellation of ''All Saints'' was imminent, a spokeswoman from the [[Seven Network]] informed [[The Daily Telegraph]] that the episode order had been trimmed. Season twelve of ''All Saints'' would screen 24 episodes instead of the usual 40 episodes and that production would cease in August instead of November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australiantelevision.net/as/articles/allsaintsalive.html|title=All Saints alive, with a bit of surgery|publisher= Australian Television Information Archive|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=10 June 2009|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, exactly one month later after the first announcement, Tim Worner, Seven's Director of Programming at the time announced that ''All Saints'' had been cancelled. He told Michael Idato of the [[Sydney Morning Herald]], "''All Saints'' is a show which Seven and viewers have loved. However, an audience shift and increased production costs are behind this tough decision." He also informed Idato that the episode order trim had been reverted and the season would complete a 37 episode order, finishing on episode 493. It was reported after the announcement that since the introduction of the MRU in 2009 it inflated the cost of each episode to $500,000. Many people still argue as to why the MRU was introduced in the first place or should have been removed instead of axing the show if the network was wanting to cut costs.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australiantelevision.net/as/articles/tvcasualty.html|title=TV casualty: ''All Saints'' axed after 11 years|publisher=Australian Television Information Archive|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|last=Idato|first=Michael|date=9 July 2009|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Feb/Mar 2010 GQ magazine in 2010, Tim Worner said his one regret was "Axing All Saints. But it was the right call at the time and we have two new drama projects in development."

=== Controversy ===

==== Episode 265 ====
On 20 April 2004, episode 265, "Brave New World" aired, which saw the introduction of [[John Howard (Australian actor)|John Howard]]'s character, Frank Campion. It was also the first episode to be set in the Emergency Department. This episode attracted lots of controversy.

One patient came into the triage and tried to get help, but he was told to wait. Later on, Nelson heard a phone ring coming from the patient and asked him to turn off the phone. It was later hinted that he had been using the phone to masturbate and it had gotten stuck in his rectum.

The end of the episode saw Frank go introduce himself to Terri ([[Georgie Parker]]), who was recovering from heart surgery. During a heated argument about staff members, Frank blatantly said to Terri, "if you ever use your influence with your previous employees to white-ant me again, you will never work in Emergency." Before Terri could get a word in, Frank added, "can I make it any fucking clearer?"&lt;ref name="Not So Saintly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australiantelevision.net/as/articles/notsosaintly.html|title=My sainted aunt! F-words and a lost mobile|publisher=Australian Television Information Archive|work=[[The Courier Mail]]|last=Chalmers|first=Emma|date=22 April 2004|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, [[Channel 7 Australia|Channel Seven]] announced that they had received more than 100 phone calls in Melbourne alone. Parker told the media, "it's a good response because it's not about the shock words—we've sworn on the show before—but because people clearly feel really protective about Terri. It's like they really feel for her as a character and don't like her being under attack by a very confronting man. It's great to know they care for her so much."&lt;ref name="Not So Saintly"/&gt;

On 22 April, the network issued a statement that read, "within an M classification code, coarse language is permitted provided it is appropriate to the storyline or program context." An apology was not made.&lt;ref name="Not So Saintly"/&gt;

==== Episode 432 ====
On 27 May 2008, episode 432, "Never Tell" aired.

This episode saw a woman pregnant from an incestuous relationship with her brother, told her child may have Down syndrome as a result.

Leading geneticist Dr. David Amor of Murdoch Children's Research Institute stated, "There is absolutely no increase in the risk of Down syndrome for the offspring of incestuous relationships."&lt;ref name="SevenApologises"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australiantelevision.net/as/articles/sevenapologises.html|title=Seven apologises for incest episode|publisher=Australian Television Information Archive|work=[[The Age]]|last=Ricketson|first=Matthew|date=3 June 2008|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Down Syndrome Australia considered legal action, complained to the media regulator, the Australian Communications and Media Authority and called for a boycott by the show's advertisers if an apology and correction was not aired on All Saints the following week.&lt;ref name="SevenApologises"/&gt;

Seven responded with, "''All Saints'' values its audience and has the greatest respect for their commitment to the program. Without reservation, to any members of the audience who have found an element of a recent story offensive, Channel Seven apologises."&lt;ref name="SevenApologises"/&gt;

=== The final episode ===
The longer-than-usual 49-minute episode aired at 9:30pm on Tuesday, 27 October 2009. The episode, unlike those in the rest of the season, went back to basics and focused more on the lives of the nurses and doctors as they tended to patients.

The episode saw [[Judith McGrath]]'s character, Von Ryan tending to a teenage girl who comes into the ED and gives birth without knowing she was pregnant. [[Tammy Macintosh]] and John Howard finished their seven- and five-year reigns as Dr. Charlotte Beaumont and Dr. Frank Campion respectively, caring for a woman played by [[Heather Mitchell]] who had cystic fibrosis. [[Ella Scott Lynch]] and [[Jonathan Wood]] left the show on a high with their characters, Claire Anderson and Elliott Parker treating a man ([[Luke Pegler]]) with a disease consistent with diabetes and promiscuity.

Secretly, Von decides to resign from All Saints, telling only Frank that she wouldn't be returning. He offers to take her out for dinner, but instead plans a surprise farewell dinner for her. Throughout the dinner, Gabrielle ([[Virginia Gay]]) and Steve ([[Jack Campbell (actor)|Jack Campbell]]) decide to raise their child together and get back together, Bart ([[Andrew Supanz]]) proposes to his girlfriend Amy ([[Alix Bidstrup]]) and Charlotte and Adam ([[Kip Gamblin]]) share an intense moment.

At the table, Von is pressured to make a speech by her colleagues and friends and reluctantly, she does, uttering her famous line: "I spent a lot of time at All Saints and I'd just like to thank you all for your loyalty, your support and love. Oh bugger this, here's to us." She raises her glass and toasts.

The finale is capped off by a montage of scenes from over the show's twelve-year run, including Mitch's final scene, the closure of Ward 17 and Bron &amp; Ben's wedding, all to [[The Beatles]] song, "[[In My Life]]".

The final scene sees Frank raise his glass at Von, who raises hers and smiles.

=== Opening credits ===

The first opening theme song for ''All Saints'' began with several deep breaths and then went into a tune played by a saxophone. The melody bears a striking similarity to "Fly By Night", the first track on [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] frontman [[Ian Anderson]]'s 1983 debut album ''[[Walk Into Light]]''. This played over the top of several shots of the cast members. Actors names were in the font [[Zurich (typeface)|Zurich Extra Condensed]] and underlined. Intercut were shots of hands, various medical equipment and medicine.

The second opening theme song was first used when the opening was upgraded in mid-season two. The same song was used however drums were added to give it more of an authentic sound. The shots of cast changed and names of actors and their characters were now present. The font remained the same. Shots of hands, medical vehicles and equipment were also present.

The first major overhaul of the opening happened in season four, when the titles were completely changed. They now began with several deep breaths over a blue screen with a vision of hands in the background. The screen was set up with a slide of the actor in the centre, with deep blue all around and medical notation. The theme was more stringy and only involved a small saxophone part. Medical crosses, bottles and syringes were present in the opening.

The second major overhaul of the opening happened in season seven, when the whole layout and font used were completely changed to mark the revamp of the show and its change of focus to the Emergency Department. The basic undertone of the theme was still there, however another saxophone overtone was added tho give the theme more authenticity. The images were also upgraded to include ambulances, surgical equipment and people rushing around in the background. The font changed and actors and characters were now in the font [[List of typefaces|Imprint MT Shadow]]. This set of opening titles continues until the end of season eight.

At the beginning of season nine, the opening titles credits were ditched and the main cast were listed at the last of every episode with the names returning to their original format and font. This continues until the final episode. In seasons ten and eleven, the actor’s name and their corresponding character name flew in from either side, however this idea was dumped when the show returned for its final season.

An intertitle card appeared before every ad break in season nine, however the show returned to fading out in the tenth and eleventh seasons.

At the beginning of the eleventh season, a new title card premiered and this appeared at the start of every episode.

This title card was refurbished for the twelfth and final season to coincide with the change of name. This title card saw the show out.

The two "missing seasons" - seasons 6 and 7 - were released on 2 March 2011.  All 12 seasons are being re-released on DVD in Australia in 2018/2019 by Via Vision Entertainment and Madman Entertainment with the first 3 seasons being released as "All Saints Collection One" and available from September 2018.

The '''Association of Osteopathic Directors and Medical Educators''' ('''AODME''') is a [[professional association]] of deans and presidents of [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic]] medical schools, [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] program directors, and the leadership of the [[American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine]] (AACOM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hwic.org/experts/details.php?id=2169 |title=Association of Osteopathic Directors and Medical Educators |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Health Workforce Information Center |accessdate=19 October 2012 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's headquarters are located in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. January 2018 marked the beginning of the integration of AODME within AACOM. The integration bridges the gap between undergraduate and graduate medical education (GME) by providing leadership for the full continuum of osteopathic medical education. As part of the integration AODME will be renamed as the Assembly of Osteopathic Graduate Medical Educators (AOGME). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aacom.org/news-and-events/news-detail/2017/11/29/aacom-and-aodme-join-forces-to-strengthen-the-full-ome-continuum|title=AACOM and AODME Join Forces to Strengthen the Full OME Continuum|website=www.aacom.org|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marijuana is the second most used drug in the Philippines, after ''shabu'' ([[methamphetamine]]), and most cultivation in the country is for local consumption. Cannabis is cultivated mostly in the remote, mountainous regions of [[Luzon]] and [[Mindanao]]&lt;ref name="USDOS"&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR)|url=https://www.state.gov/j/inl/rls/nrcrpt/2016/vol1/253301.htm|website=US Department of State|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
Cannabis has been illegal in the Philippines since 1972 by virtue of Republic Act No. 6425, or the ''Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972''.&lt;ref name="RA625"&gt;{{cite act |title= The Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972 |type=Republic Act |number=6425 |date=April 4, 1972 |url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1972/ra_6425_1972.html |access-date= April 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; RA6425 classified marijuana as a prohibited drug, and detailed out punishments for the importation, sale, manufacture, cultivation, possession, and use of the drug, as well as possession of any drug-related paraphernalia. RA6425 also created the Dangerous Drugs Board, giving it jurisdiction over drug-related cases. In 2002, the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 was signed, repealing RA6425.&lt;ref name="RA9165"/&gt; RA9165 also enabled the creation of the [[Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency]], which handles the implementation and enforcement of policies and strategies made by the Dangerous Drugs Board.

Under the current law, the importation, sale, maintenance of a den, dive or resort, manufacture, use, and cultivation of marijuana and marijuana-related products shall be met with life imprisonment and a fine.&lt;ref name="RA9165" /&gt;

==Statistics==

In 2015, the Dangerous Drugs Board estimated, based on admission data in drug rehabilitation centers, that around 25% of center clients use marijuana.&lt;ref name="DDBStats"&gt;{{cite web|title=DDB 2015 Statistics|url=http://www.ddb.gov.ph/research-statistics/statistics/45-research-and-statistics/287-2015-statistics|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RapplerDrugs" /&gt;

Arrests for marijuana have been steady in recent years. In 2016, the PDEA eradicated a total of 337 marijuana sites.&lt;ref name="PDEAStats"&gt;{{cite web|title=PDEA - Statistical Data|url=http://pdea.gov.ph/our-accomplishments/statistical-data|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first seven months of 2015, PDEA reported conducting 22 successful cannabis eradication operations, resulting in the destruction of 117 growing sites and the seizure of cannabis valued at approximately 3.5 million USD.&lt;ref name="USDOS"/&gt; That same year PDEA eradicated a total of 286 marijuana sites.&lt;ref name="PDEAStats" /&gt; In 2014, the PDEA reported that 8.9% of all drug seizures they made that year involved marijuana,&lt;ref name="RapplerDrugs"&gt;{{cite news|title=A look at the state of crime, drugs in the Philippines|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/118004-crime-drugs-philippines|accessdate=15 April 2017|agency=Rappler|date=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that they eradicated a total of 506 growing sites, the largest in recent years.&lt;ref name="PDEAStats" /&gt;

==Reform==
A pro-medical marijuana [[Non-Government Organization|NGO]] called the ''Philippine Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws'' (PORMAL) seeks to challenge the law in order to legalize its use, however there is opposition from both the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency and senators like [[Vicente Sotto III]]. The PDEA claims that marijuana is a [[Gateway drug theory|gateway drug]] that can lead to the abuse of harder substances. Senator Sotto has asked PORMAL to submit empirical evidence on the benefits of marijuana use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/208825/news/nation/citing-its-medicinal-value-ngo-pushes-for-marijuana-legalization|title=Citing its medicinal value, NGO pushes for marijuana legalization|work=GMA News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical use==
On May 26, 2014, [[Isabela (province)|Isabela]] representative Rodolfo Albano III introduced House Bill No. 4477, known as the ''Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Act'' to the [[16th Congress of the Philippines]], which would legalize the use of medical marijuana.&lt;ref name="RapplerHB4477"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill on medical use of marijuana filed in Congress|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/59118-compassionate-use-medical-cannabis-bill|accessdate=15 April 2017|agency=Rappler|date=May 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Experts study medical pot use|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/795216/experts-study-medical-pot-use|accessdate=22 November 2016|publisher=Inquirer|date=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Inquirer'' describes this bill as a "hotly-debated topic."&lt;ref name="Inquirer"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Caruncho|first1=Eric|title=Are you ready to try medical marijuana?|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/212685/are-you-ready-to-try-medical-marijuana/|accessdate=22 November 2016|publisher=Inquirer|date=November 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bill was filed in the Philippine Congress to legalize the use of medical marijuana in 2014.&lt;ref name="NatWorldNews20160524"&gt;{{cite news|last1=F|first1=Jessica|title=Presumptive President of the Philippines, Duterte, Says Yes to Medical Marijuana|url=http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/22841/20160524/presumptive-president-of-the-philippines-duterte-says-yes-to-medical-marijuana.htm|accessdate=14 January 2017|publisher=Inquirer|date=May 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the bill's co-authors, Leah Paquiz,  said  "We are at this stage, we have Filipinos who need care, we should give them compassionate care - this medical cannabis. There are a lot of medicines, but they are expensive."&lt;ref name="NatWorldNews20160524"/&gt;  The bill was, however, ultimately not passed during the 16th Congress. Albano has filed the bill during the [[17th Congress of the Philippines]].&lt;ref name="CongressHBFile"&gt;{{cite news|title=Solon re-files "Philippine Compassionate Medical Cannabis Bill"|url=http://www.congress.gov.ph/press/details.php?pressid=9655|accessdate=15 April 2017|agency=House of Representatives|date=July 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Congressman to refile medical marijuana bill in July|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/06/26/congressman-albano-refile-medical-marijuana-bill-17th-congress.html|accessdate=15 April 2017|agency=CNN News|date=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill is currently under referendum as House Bill 180.&lt;ref name="CongressHB"&gt;{{cite web|title=House Bills and Resolutions|url=http://www.congress.gov.ph/legisdocs/?v=billsresults#17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] said during his election campaign that he supported medical marijuana, but that he would leave any decision to the concerned government department.&lt;ref name="NatWorldNews20160524"/&gt;

At the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939, Maclay joined the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] and served as a surgical specialist.&lt;ref name="bmj" /&gt;  On 18 December 1943, he was promoted to lieutenant.&lt;ref name="gazette"&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=36332 |supp=y |page=344 |date=14 January 1944 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Maclay was one of those who took part in the [[Normandy landings]] on 6 June 1944.&lt;ref name="samj" /&gt;  In 1947 he was demobilised with the permanent rank of major.&lt;ref name="bmj" /&gt;  During these years and later, Maclay contributed papers to medical and scientific journals.&lt;ref name="bmj" /&gt;&lt;ref name="microsoft"&gt;{{AcademicSearch|50917850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maclay was appointed consultant surgeon to the Boston Combined Hospitals, [[Lincolnshire]] in 1948.&lt;ref name="rcse" /&gt;  Driven by an urge to help underprivileged people, he emigrated to South Africa in 1957, where he was senior surgeon at [[Butterworth Hospital (Eastern Cape)|Butterworth]], [[Port Elizabeth Provincial Hospital|Port Elizabeth]] and [[Eshowe]] hospitals.&lt;ref name="samj"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://archive.samj.org.za/1978%20VOL%20LIII%20Jan-Jun/Articles/06%20June/5.19%20IN%20MEMORIAM.DR.C.W.MACLAY.pdf |title=Charles W.

'''[[Trinidad and Tobago]]''' is the southernmost country of the [[West Indies]]; as of 2013, its adjusted maternal mortality rate is 84 deaths per 100 000 women; the rate is adjusted for underreporting and misclassification by the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;Trinidad and Tobago World Health Organization Statistical Profile&lt;/ref&gt; The contraceptive rate, that is the percentage of women in union aged 15–49 years currently using [[contraception]], is 42.5%.&lt;ref name="UNICEF"&gt;Unicef, "Statistics at a Glance: Trinidad and Tobago" {{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/trinidad_tobago_statistics.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011034/http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/trinidad_tobago_statistics.html |archivedate=2015-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fertility rate is 1.8 children per woman.&lt;ref name="UNICEF"/&gt; Fourteen weeks of maternity leave with allowances is provided by the government; women typically choose to take this leave after the birth rather than before, to spend time with the newborn.&lt;ref name="Mendes-Franco"&gt;Janine Mendes-Franco, "Fathers in the Caribbean have to fight to see the birth of their kids" March 2014 {{cite web |url=http://globalvoices.org/2014/03/10/midwives-take-action-on-no-dads-allowed-rules-in-trinidad-tobago/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012104638/https://globalvoices.org/2014/03/10/midwives-take-action-on-no-dads-allowed-rules-in-trinidad-tobago/ |archivedate=2015-10-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-natal care==
95.7% of pregnant women have at least 1 [[prenatal care]] visit.&lt;ref name="UNICEF"/&gt; These visits most commonly occur at the woman’s local clinic.&lt;ref name="Rawlins"&gt;Joan Rawlins &amp; Bidyadhar Sa &amp; Rachel Brathwaite, "Measuring medical students’ sense of preparedness for community visits to antenatal patients in the health centre setting in Trinidad" J Public Health (2013) 21:349–356&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diabetes]] and high blood pressure are two of the more serious conditions for pregnant women in Trinidad and Tobago. Often, if women do not have an antenatal visit early enough in their pregnancy, these conditions can be missed, leading to complications during birth. The biggest challenge for prenatal health is maintaining a healthy diet. Caribbean cuisine is mostly highly seasoned, with a high salt content, and, along with the common practice of frying and high saturated fat, this contributes to poor management of diabetes and increased risk of high blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Gaynor Harrison, "Health beliefs of black and minority ethnic groups and the implications for diabetes care," The Journal of Diabetes Nursing&lt;/ref&gt;

For treatment of their diabetes and high blood pressure, during pregnancy or otherwise, Trinidadians and Tobagonians often view traditional Caribbean medicine as complementary to prescribed medicines.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Smith Chrystal | year = 2011 | title = Living with sugar: influence of cultural beliefs on Type 2 diabetes self-management of English-speaking Afro-Caribbean women | url = | journal = Journal of Immigrant Minority Health | volume =  14| issue = | pages =  640–647| doi = 10.1007/s10903-011-9513-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one study found the following plants used among half of Caribbean respondents for diabetes: cerasse/noni/caraili/bitter melon (''[[Momordica charantia]]''), cinnamon bark and pills (''[[Cinnamomum verum]]''), mauby bark (''[[Colubrina arborescens]]''), aloe (''[[Aloe vera]]'', ''[[Aloe barbadensis]]''), bush tea (unspecified medicinal plants) and celery (''[[Apium graveolens]]''). Cucumber (''[[Cucumis sativus]]''), garlic (''[[Allium sativum]]''), and tamarind leaf (''[[Tamarindus indica]]'') were also used to control high blood pressure. These plants were crushed, liquefied, and consumed cold or steeped as a brewed tea. ''Momordica charantia'' was the most popular botanical that participants used to treat type 2 diabetes.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

==Traditional medicine==
Traditional medicine is also used for childbirth and [[infertility]]. One study, which conducted interviews with Trinidadians over a four-year period from 1996-2000, found the use of the following plants for childbirth and infertility: ''[[Mimosa pudica]]'', ''[[Ruta graveolens]]'', ''[[Abelmoschus moschatus]]'', ''[[Chamaesyce hirta]]'', ''[[Cola nitida]]'', ''[[Ambrosia cumanenesis]]'', ''[[Pilea microphylla]]'', ''[[Eryngium foetidum]]'', ''[[Aristolochia rugosa]]'', ''[[Aristolochia trilobata]]'', ''[[Coleus aromaticus]]'', ''[[Laportea aestuans]]'' and ''[[Vetiveria zizanioides]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lans Cheryl | year = 2007 | title = Ethnomedicines used in Trinidad and Tobago for reproductive problems | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186%2F1746-4269-3-13 | journal = Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine | volume = 3 | issue = | page = 13 | doi=10.1186/1746-4269-3-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intercourse==
The adolescent fertility rate in Trinidad and Tobago, as of 2013, is 35.5 births per 1000 women aged 15–19 years.&lt;ref name="UNICEF"/&gt; In 2007, a representative sample of all 13- to 15-year-old students in Trinidad and Tobago was surveyed about sexual health: 26.0% of students had sexual intercourse during their life and 13.2% of students had sexual intercourse for the first time before age 13. Male students were significantly more likely than female students to have sexual intercourse (32.0% of all males versus 20.2% of all females) and also to have it for the first time before age 13 (19.9% of all males versus 6.3% of all females). In total, 17.6% of students had sexual intercourse with two or more partners during their life. Male students (23.9%) were significantly more likely than female students (11.4%) to have had multiple partners. Among students who had sexual intercourse during the past 12 months, 59.1% used a condom the last time they had sexual intercourse, but only 22.4% used a condom most of the time or always during the past 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;Pan American Health Organization and the Ministry of Health of Trinidad and Tobago, Global School Based Student Health Survey of Trinidad and Tobago, 2007. {{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/chp/gshs/2007_GSHS_Trinidad_and_Tobago_Report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714151852/http://www.who.int/chp/gshs/2007_GSHS_Trinidad_and_Tobago_Report.pdf |archivedate=2015-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the above survey shows an early age of initiation of sexual activity and low utilization of contraceptive practices, a 2008 study of the twin island country showed both a decline in adolescent fertility rates as well as adolescent births over the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;Kameel Mungrue, "Has early initiation of sexual activity in adolescence had an impact on teenage childbearing in Trinidad and Tobago?," International Journal of Adolescent Medicine and Health (2008) 20(3):255-60&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abortion==
In Trinidad and Tobago the [[abortion]] rate is the same as the birth rate; that is there is approximately the same number of abortions per year as births, around 19,000.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;Cedriann J. Martin ''et al.'', "Knowledge and Perception of Abortion and the Abortion Law in Trinidad and Tobago," Reproductive Health Matters, 2007-05-01, Volume 15, Issue 29, Pages 97-107. https://www.clinicalkey.com/#!/content/playContent/1-s2.0-S0968808007293012 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425174959/https://www.clinicalkey.com/ |date=2013-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in Trinidad and Tobago, abortion is illegal in cases of incest, rape, social and economic reasons and only legal when the mother’s life is in danger. Annually between 3000-4000 women are treated in the public hospitals for the consequences of unsafe terminations; it is the leading cause of maternal morbidity.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; Abortion is not openly discussed in Trinidad and Tobago.&lt;ref name="Rawlins"/&gt; There is an impression that Trinidadians are greatly opposed to abortion reform law, due in part to certain vocal religious groups; however, a careful survey of 918 citizens conducted in 2005 found that even though almost half of the participants had an unfavorable perception of abortion, more than half of them were in favor of broadening the legal grounds for accessing terminations.

==HIV==
As for the prevalence rates for [[sexually transmitted infections]]: 1.7% of adults aged 15–49 in Trinidad and Tobago have [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;UN Aids: Trinidad and Tobago, {{cite web |url=http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/trinidadandtobago |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601080111/http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/trinidadandtobago/ |archivedate=2015-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Labour and birth==
From the most recent study in 2012, 100% of births in Trinidad and Tobago are attended by a health professional.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, {{cite web |url=http://data.worldbank.org/country/trinidad-and-tobago |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517050254/http://data.worldbank.org/country/trinidad-and-tobago |archivedate=2015-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 97.4% of total births take place in an institution.&lt;ref name="UNICEF"/&gt; Of total births in Trinidad and Tobago, approximately 2% occur in the home, 83% in public hospitals, 14.7% in private hospitals, and 0.0025% at the Mamatoto Birth Centre.&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;Debra Lewis, "Why Fathers Should be Present at Birth" TEDxTALK Port of Spain {{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmAyFYjtmok |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926111836/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmAyFYjtmok |archivedate=2015-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Except for in the case of home births, once labour begins, mothers generally proceed to the hospitals or birth centre as directed by health personnel, usually by telephone.

In the public hospitals, as the standard of care, midwives attend the delivery of babies. Only in the case of a complicated birth, for example one requiring [[Cesarean section]] or suturing, will the obstetrician on staff be called.&lt;ref name="interviews"&gt;Interviews with birth attendants and health personnel in Trinidad, conducted by University of Pennsylvania undergraduate, April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Cesarean sections are not available on request and the rate in most public hospitals vary from 10-14%, with higher rates occurring in hospitals that receive more referrals. There tends to be a high rate of episiotomies in the public hospitals, as high as 50%.&lt;ref name="interviews"/&gt; There is limited availability of epidurals in these hospitals and for the most part, natural childbirth takes place. Continuous fetal monitoring technology is not used.

==Birthing practices==
===Public hospitals===
The public hospitals tend to adhere to several outdated Western medical policies which are not based on current research or empirical evidence according to the [[Cochrane Library]] (a database of systematic reviews); for example, labouring women are kept lying down in bed and are not allowed to have a support person, or eat solid foods, and delivery occurs with the women’s legs in stirrups.&lt;ref&gt;Cochrane {{cite web |url=http://www.cochrane.org/CD003934/PREG_mothers-position-during-the-first-stage-of-labour |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511231821/http://www.cochrane.org/CD003934/PREG_mothers-position-during-the-first-stage-of-labour |archivedate=2015-05-11 |df= }}; {{cite web |url=http://www.cochrane.org/CD002006/PREG_position-in-the-second-stage-of-labour-for-women-without-epidural-anaesthesia |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620164422/http://www.cochrane.org/CD002006/PREG_position-in-the-second-stage-of-labour-for-women-without-epidural-anaesthesia |archivedate=2015-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when new policy is made, it is not necessarily practised, as is the case with Mount Hope Medical facility which does have more modern policy to align with the baby-friendly status, but it is not followed well.&lt;ref name="Mendes-Franco"/&gt; In all public facilities, labouring women share the same space for the most part, in an open, non air-conditioned floor, with only screens separating them for privacy. Women are moved into a separate room for the delivery. One direct relative may be allowed for the delivery but this person oftentimes has to meet a series of requirements specific to the hospital and can still be denied on the whim of the staff. For example, the San Fernando General Hospital (serving the southern end of the island) permits no relatives in the delivery room; the Sangre Grande Hospital (serving the east end) has a form with rules that must be signed and followed by the partner; and the Port of Spain General Hospital (serving the west end) requires proof of birth classes along with other requirements.&lt;ref name="Mendes-Franco"/&gt; Doulas (trained emotional support persons) are not allowed to provide labour support. If the [[doula]] is a direct relative, she may accompany the mother for the delivery as the one allowed family member.&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt;

===Private hospitals===
In the private hospitals, babies are delivered solely by obstetricians, and the expectant mothers are attended by nurses, midwives (who essentially act as labour and delivery nurses) and doulas, if specifically hired by the mothers. The total cost to have a vaginal delivery in the private sector is approximately $17,000-20,000 TTD (about $3000 USD) and double that price for a Cesarean section.&lt;ref name="West_Shore"&gt;West Shore Medical Private Hospital, "Maternity Guide" {{cite web |url=http://westshoreprivatehospital.com/sitedocs/westshore_maternity_guide.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927030134/http://westshoreprivatehospital.com/sitedocs/westshore_maternity_guide.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain employers do provide private insurance, but it does not cover a significant portion of this cost to make it an affordable option for most. The private hospitals have similar technology use, as in hospitals in the U.S., for fetal monitoring and pain management. Unlike the public hospitals, [[epidurals]] are guaranteed if wanted. Cesarean sections are performed in cases of medical indication and can also be performed on request, though that is rare.&lt;ref name="West_Shore"/&gt; The Cesarean section rate in most private facilities is about 30%. Labouring women in private facilities often have more flexibility in what they can do: whether it is eating during labour, moving around, or having numerous support persons with them. In general, labour takes place in a private air conditioned room with family members and a doula if previously arranged by the family.

===Home births===
Planned births occurring in the home are attended by midwives. To qualify for a home birth, the midwife must approve the birth as low risk with no up front medical indication for need of services unavailable in the home context. As part of the training of midwives in Trinidad and Tobago, all midwifery students must attend at least three home births before their certification is considered complete.&lt;ref&gt;The T&amp;T Association of Midwives {{cite web |url=http://www.ttwellnessconnect.com/the-tt-association-of-midwives-delivering-the-future/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712000811/http://www.ttwellnessconnect.com/the-tt-association-of-midwives-delivering-the-future/ |archivedate=2015-07-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mamatoto Birth Centre===
At the Birth Centre, Mamatoto, the deliveries of babies are attended by midwives following the midwifery model of care. Mothers can labour in whatever position they feel most comfortable, and water, massages, acupressure and doulas are available at every birth for pain management. Over 90% of births are natural vaginal deliveries, requiring no interventions.&lt;ref name="Bishop"&gt;Verdel Bishop, "Alternative Birthing Options at Mamatoto," The Trinidad and Tobago Newsday, 2011, {{cite web |url=http://www.newsday.co.tt/features/0,151042.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304083853/http://www.newsday.co.tt/features/0,151042.html |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}; {{cite web |url=http://mamatoto.net/our-story/our-doulas/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503091712/http://mamatoto.net/our-story/our-doulas/ |archivedate=2015-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The center has about a 2% episiotomy rate and limited use of birth technology, though they are adequately prepared for emergencies, with an ambulance paid on retainer to transport mothers to the hospital if need be. Obstetricians and pediatricians are members of the Birth Centre’s board and while they are not usually present for births, they offer advice when required. The Centre attends about 50-70 births annually.&lt;ref name="Bishop"/&gt; Births at Mamatoto cost about $14,000 TTD but there are reduced costs, based on family income, and [[pro bono]] services for unemployed or teenage women.&lt;ref name="Bishop"/&gt;

===Maternal choice===
In general, if a mother has the means, she will choose to deliver her baby in a private facility instead of a public one.&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt; In part, this is due to the poor reputation the public hospitals get because of the media’s scandalizing portrayals of maternal deaths.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see the following two articles from major Trinidadian newspapers {{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.tt/news/2015-04-19/new-mom-dead-after-c-section-mt-hope |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424234011/http://www.guardian.co.tt/news/2015-04-19/new-mom-dead-after-c-section-mt-hope |archivedate=2015-04-24 |df= }}; {{cite web |url=http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/-Mom-dies-26-days-after-C-section-301499491.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430150313/http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/-Mom-dies-26-days-after-C-section-301499491.html |archivedate=2015-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some mothers might even take out loans, "baby loans," so that they can deliver at private facilities instead of the public ones.

==Postpartum and newborn care==
The afterbirth or [[placenta]] in hospitals is discarded as biological waste and there is no particular country-wide ritual observed with it. Newborns, for the most part, remain at the mother’s side after being examined by health professionals. Public hospitals do a better job of preventing the separation of Mother-baby in the hours directly after birth, in part because they have no regular nursery facilities as private hospitals do.&lt;ref name="interviews"/&gt;

Women typically stay in the hospital, public or private, for no more than 24 hours after birth. The tendency is towards early discharge due to overcrowding in the public facilities, and due to financial charges in the private facilities. Most hospitals have policy encouraging the initiation of [[breastfeeding]] before discharge.&lt;ref name="interviews"/&gt; However, the early initiation of breastfeeding rate in Trinidad and Tobago is only 41.2% as of 2013; that is the percentage of infants who receive milk from their mother’s breast within an hour of being born.&lt;ref name="UNICEF"/&gt; Furthermore, as of 2013, only 12.8% of newborns are exclusively breastfed in the first six months after birth and 83.4% are introduced to solid or semi solid or soft foods in their first six to eight months.&lt;ref name="UNICEF"/&gt; In part, this phenomenon might be due to the often-spoken-of belief in Trinidad and Tobago that in order for the baby to sleep properly at night, he/she must be given cereal with his/her milk before bed.&lt;ref name="interviews"/&gt;

The under five mortality rate in Trinidad and Tobago is 21 deaths per 1000 live births and the infant mortality is 19 deaths per 1000 live births. The leading cause of death is [[premature birth|prematurity]].&lt;ref name="UNICEF"/&gt; There are only three Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) in the country; all three are in separate public health facilities in Trinidad: in Port of Spain, San Fernando and Mount Hope. If there is suspicion that a baby will be born premature, the expectant mother will be referred to one of these hospitals for the delivery. Private facilities have no [[Neonatal Intensive Care Unit]]s (NICU).&lt;ref&gt;Commonwealth of nations {{cite web |url=http://www.commonwealthhealth.org/americas/trinidad_and_tobago/health_systems_in_trinidad_and_tobago |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714232419/http://www.commonwealthhealth.org/americas/trinidad_and_tobago/health_systems_in_trinidad_and_tobago/ |archivedate=2015-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a newborn is admitted to the NICU, mothers have to adhere to hospital policy which does not allow them to stay overnight with the baby, and requires the pumping of breast milk for the infant.&lt;ref name="interviews"/&gt;

[[Postpartum depression]] is not carefully monitored or measured in the country. As part of the public health facilities, there is a six-week [[postpartum]] checkup, during which time this condition can perhaps be detected, but there is little follow up with the mother between discharge and this checkup. Although, if the mother chooses, she can visit a physician in her local health clinic at any time. In the private health facilities, mothers are assigned a specific pediatrician who examines the newborn at birth; this personal physician can be contacted by the mother if she chooses to do so, in regards to postpartum depression. At Mamatoto, discharge typically occurs four hours following birth, after which the health staff call the mother every single day for a week, and then once a week until the six-week postpartum visit. In this way, there is ample follow up to give health personnel the opportunity to ensure the mother’s mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Post-natal Support at Mamatoto Birth Centre, {{cite web |url=http://mamatoto.net/programmes/post-natal-support/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503090249/http://mamatoto.net/programmes/post-natal-support/ |archivedate=2015-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===At-home care===

Once mother and baby are back at home, nuclear and extended family and many community members become involved with the care of the newborn and mother. It is typical for a new mother to either stay with a female relative for a few weeks directly after discharge, or for a female relative to move in with the new mother for a few weeks to help with cooking, cleaning and caring for both mother and baby.&lt;ref name="interviews"/&gt; Often time, senior females in the family and community are most vocal with their opinions for care, and their advice is generally regarded with respect, though not always enacted. Their advice might take the form of more traditional medicine and folklore. The following are examples of some beliefs: the mole (soft part of the skull) of the baby should be covered with a hat especially during the night, dew fall or rainfall, to prevent the baby from getting sick; coconut oil should be used to massage and stretch the limbs of the newborn; certain amulets and jewelry should be placed on newborn to ward off the "evil eye"; small amounts of breast milk may be placed in newborn’s eye to prevent infection; and soursop might be given to promote sleepiness of the newborn.&lt;ref name="interviews"/&gt; As for the mother, a drink of mauby bark (''[[Colubrina arborescens]]'') should be consumed to "cleanse" the body; tea of vervine should be consumed to promote breastfeeding; and thick sheets may be wrapped around the mother’s stomach for weeks to help it revert to its original size. Some health professionals have also noted that an enema is proposed to mothers frequently by family and community members for a variety of reasons.&lt;ref name="interviews"/&gt;

Lastly, newborns might go through particular rites of passages according to the religion of their family. For instance, most babies born into Christian homes have [[Baptism|Christenings]].&lt;ref&gt;Church Registers of Trinidad and Tobago {{cite web |url=http://www.trinidadandtobagofamilyhistory.org/churchregisters%28.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512002934/http://www.trinidadandtobagofamilyhistory.org/churchregisters(.html |archivedate=2015-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christopher Daniel Duntsch''' (born April 3, 1971)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/272320662/Christopher-Duntsch-Indictments |title=Christopher Duntsch Indictments |website=Scribd.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a former neurosurgeon who has been nicknamed '''Dr. D.''' and '''Dr. Death'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/2016/november/christopher-duntsch-dr-death/|title=Dr. Death - D Magazine|newspaper=D Magazine|last=Goodman|first=Matt|date=November 2016|access-date=2017-02-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; for gross [[medical malpractice|malpractice]] resulting in the death and maiming of several patients while working at [[Baylor University Medical Center at Dallas|Baylor Plano]] and Dallas Medical Center.&lt;ref name="WFAAEiserer"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/dr-duntsch-defense-expert-the-only-way-this-happens-is-the-entire-system-fails-the-patients/408088559 |title=Dr. Duntsch defense expert: "The only way this happens is the entire system fails the patients" |last=Eiserer |first=Tanya |publisher=[[WFAA]] |date=February 13, 2017 |accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Duntsch was convicted of various crimes on February 20, 2017, and sentenced to life in prison.

==Education==
Duntsch completed the [[MD/PhD|MD/PhD]] program and [[neurosurgery]] residency program at the [[University of Tennessee Health Science Center]],&lt;ref name="WFAAEiserer"/&gt; and subsequently was an assistant professor there.&lt;ref name="Swanson"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/investigations/2014/03/01/planos-baylor-hospital-faces-hard-questions-after-claims-against-former-neurosurgeon |title=Plano’s Baylor hospital faces hard questions after claims against former neurosurgeon |last=Swanson |first=Doug J. |publisher=[[Dallas News]] |date=March 1, 2014 |accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Duntsch then moved to Dallas to work at [[Baylor Plano]]. After several botched surgeries, he left for Dallas Medical Center, where he was employed for less than a week before he was dismissed by administrators after the death of another patient.&lt;ref name="Swanson"/&gt; There is no information available indicating what investigation the state licensing agency did, or if the hospital notified the [[Texas Medical Board]].

According to court documents, he was suspected of being under the influence of cocaine while operating during his fourth year of residency. He was sent to an impaired physicians program and then he was allowed to return to his residency program.&lt;ref name="Morguloff"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.texasobserver.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Morguloff-Complaint.pdf|format=PDF|title=Barry Morguloff's suit against the Baylor Health Care System|date=March 25, 2014|newspaper=[[The Texas Observer]]|accessdate=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duntsch began operating in Texas in 2010 and his [[medical license]] was revoked in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/2015/08/21/surgeon-who-wrote-of-becoming-killer-is-denied-bail-reduction |title=Surgeon who wrote of becoming killer is denied bail reduction |last=Martin |first=Naomi |publisher=Dallas News |date=August 21, 2015 |accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was accused and later convicted of [[Mutilation|maiming]] four patients and killing two others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2017/02/14/former-neurosurgeon-faces-life-in-prison-after-guilty-verdict/ |title=Former Neurosurgeon Faces Life In Prison After Guilty Verdict |publisher=CBS Dallas / Fort Worth |date=February 14, 2017 |accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, according to court proceedings, he emailed a colleague, saying "I am ready to leave the love and kindness and goodness and patience that I mix with everything else that I am and become a cold blooded killer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Emily|first1=Jennifer|title=Man testifies friend left him a quadriplegic|url=http://www.pressreader.com/usa/the-dallas-morning-news/20170203/282140701111300|accessdate=February 22, 2017|work=Dallas Morning News|via=PressReader|date=February 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical license revocation and criminal conviction===
In March 2014, three former patients of Duntsch - Mary Efurd, Kenneth Fennel, and Lee Passmore - filed separate [[Federal Court of the United States|Federal Court]] suits against Baylor Plano, alleging that Baylor allowed Duntsch to perform surgeries despite knowing that he was a dangerous physician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/the-daily-post/greg-abbott-enters-fray-in-lawsuits-involving-sociopath-doctor/ |title=Greg Abbott Enters Fray in Lawsuits Involving “Sociopath” Doctor |author=Solomon, Dan |work=Texas Monthly |date=March 27, 2014 |accessdate=November 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Texas Attorney General]] [[Greg Abbott]] filed a motion to intervene in the suits to defend Baylor Plano, citing the Texas Legislature's 2003 statute that placed a [[medical malpractice caps|medical malpractice cap]] of $250,000, along with the statute's removal of the term "gross negligence" from the definition of legal malice; the suit alleged that Baylor Plano made an average net profit of $65,000 on every spinal surgery performed by Duntsch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dallasnews.com/news/plano/2014/03/25/abbott-sides-with-baylor-hospital-in-neurosurgeon-lawsuit |title=Abbott sides with Baylor hospital in neurosurgeon lawsuit |author=Swanson, Doug J. |work=The Dallas Morning News |date=March 2014 |accessdate=November 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, he was convicted of a first degree felony in the maiming of Mary Efurd during a [[spinal fusion]] surgery.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Travis M. (February 16, 2017). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/02/16/texas-neurosurgeon-nicknamed-dr-death-found-guilty-of-maiming-woman-during-surgery/ "Texas neurosurgeon nicknamed 'Dr. Death' found guilty of maiming woman during surgery,"] ''The Washington Post'', retrieved February 21, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morguloff"/&gt;

He had drilled a screw into Efurd's spinal cavity, placed implants into muscle instead of on bone, and completely amputated an entire spinal nerve root. "It's as egregious as you can imagine," said Dr. Robert Henderson, the surgeon who was called on to perform emergency rescue surgery on Efurd after she had been maimed by Duntsch. Now 79, Efurd can stand for only 10 minutes at a time and spends most of her days in a wheelchair.

===Life imprisonment===
In July, 2015, approximately a year and a half after his license was revoked, Dr. Duntsch was arrested in [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]] and faced five felony counts of aggravated assault causing serious bodily injury and one count of injury to a child, elderly or disabled person.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/2018/09/25/need-know-dr-death-dallas-neurosurgeon-christopher-duntsch "What you need to know about 'Dr. Death,' Dallas neurosurgeon Christopher Duntsch,"] Dallas News, September 20, 2018, retrieved September 20, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Following a jury trial, he was convicted on the latter count and on February 20, 2017 he was sentenced to life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/former-neurosurgeon-sentenced-for-purposely-maiming-patients/ "Former neurosurgeon sentenced for purposely maiming patients,"] CBS News, February 21, 2017, retrieved February 21, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eiserer, Tanya (February 21, 2017).

All four hospitals that employed Duntsch have an ongoing civil case against them.&lt;ref name="Haggerty"/&gt;

==Reactions==
The conviction of Duntsch was one of the first prison sentences given for malpractice, and has been called a precedent-setting case.&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedailyvoicenews.com/2017/02/21/texas-jury-imposes-life-sentence-on-neurosurgeon/ |title=Texas Jury Imposes Life Sentence on Neurosurgeon &amp;#124; The Daily Voice |website=Thedailyvoicenews.com |date=2017-02-21 |accessdate=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The office of the district attorney prosecuting the case called it "a historic case with respect to prosecuting a doctor who had done wrong during surgery."&lt;ref name=CBSnews&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/former-neurosurgeon-sentenced-for-purposely-maiming-patients/ |title=Former neurosurgeon sentenced for purposely maiming patients |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=2017-02-21 |accessdate=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The director of neurosurgery at [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center|UT Southwestern]], Carlos Bagley, testifying for the defense, said that “the only way this happens is that the entire system fails the patients."&lt;ref name="WFAAEiserer"/&gt;

A '''cigarette filter''' is a component of a [[cigarette]], along with [[cigarette paper]], capsules and adhesives. It does not make [[health effects of tobacco|cigarettes less unhealthy]].&lt;ref name=filterprob/&gt; 

The filter may be made from [[cellulose acetate]] [[fibre]], [[paper]] or [[activated charcoal]] (either as a cavity filter or embedded into the cellulose acetate). Macroporous [[phenol-formaldehyde resin]]s and [[asbestos]] have also been used in cigarette filters.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author1=Francois de Dardel | author2=Thomas V.

Most factory-made cigarettes are equipped with a filter; those who roll their own can buy them from a tobacconist.{{cn|date=September 2018}} The near-universal adoption of filters on cigarettes has not reduced harms to smokers; for instance, lung cancer rates have not declined.&lt;ref name=filterprob/&gt; 

Filling a given length of cigarette with filter is cheaper than filling it with tobacco.&lt;ref name=nyt_filter/&gt;

== History ==
In 1925, Hungarian inventor Boris Aivaz patented the process of making a cigarette filter from [[crepe paper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobaccoasia.com/news.asp?id=534|title=The History of Filters|publisher=tobaccoasia.com|accessdate=2008-05-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030824115139/http://www.tobaccoasia.com/news.asp?id=534 |archivedate=August 24, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1935, a [[United Kingdom|British]] company began to develop a machine that made cigarettes incorporating the tipped filter. It was considered a specialty item until 1954, when manufacturers introduced the machine more broadly, following a spate of speculative announcements from [[physician|doctors]] and researchers concerning a possible link between [[lung diseases]] and smoking. Since filtered cigarettes were considered "safer", by the 1960s, they dominated the market. Production of filter cigarettes rose from 0.5 percent in 1950 to 87.7 percent by 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | editor1=Murray E. Jarvik | editor2=Joseph W. Cullen | editor3=Ellen R. Gritz | editor4=Thomas M. Vogt | editor5=Louis Jolyon West | title=Research on Smoking Behavior | series=NIDA Research Monograph | volume=17 | author=Leonard M. Schuman | contribution=Patterns of Smoking Behavior | pages=36–65 | year=1977 | url=http://archives.drugabuse.gov/pdf/monographs/17.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the 1930s and the 1950s, most cigarettes were 70&amp;nbsp;mm (~2 3/4 in) long. The modern cigarette market includes mainly filter cigarettes that are 80&amp;nbsp;mm  (in boxes; ~3 1/8 in), 85&amp;nbsp;mm (in softpack; ~3 3/8 in), 100 mm (~3 15/16 in), or even 120&amp;nbsp;mm  (~4 3/4 in) long.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | editor1=John Grabowski | editor2=Catherine S. Bell | author=Lynn T. Kozlowski | contribution=Physical Indicators of Actual Tar and Nicotine Yields of Cigarettes | title=Measurement in the Analysis and Treatment of Smoking Behavior | series=NIDA Research Monograph | volume=48 | year=1983 | publisher=U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services | pages=50–61 | url=http://archives.drugabuse.gov/pdf/monographs/48.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cigarettes filters were originally made of cork and used to prevent tobacco flakes from getting on the smokers' tongue. Many are still patterned to look like cork.&lt;ref name=nyt_filter/&gt;

== Manufacture ==
{{quotebox|align=left|width=35%|title=Colour change|quote = 
The cigarette smoking public attaches great significance to visual examination of the filter material in filter tip cigarettes after smoking the cigarettes. A before and after smoking visual comparison is usually made and if the filter tip material, after smoking, is darkened, the tip is automatically judged to be effective. While the use of such colour change material would probably have little or no effect on the actual efficiency of the filter tip material, the advertising and sales advantages are obvious.

[[Image:Celluloseacetuar.jpg|thumb|Spent cigarette filter]]

Cellulose acetate is made by [[ester]]ifying [[bleaching|bleached]] [[cotton]] or [[wood pulp]] with [[acetic acid]]. Of the three cellulose hydroxy groups available for esterification, between two and three are esterified by controlling the amount of acid (degree of substitution (DS) 2.35-2.55). The ester is spun into fibers and formed into bundles called [[filter tow]]. Flavors ([[menthol]]), [[sweeteners]], [[Plasticizer|softeners]] ([[triacetin]]), [[flame retardant]]s ([[sodium tungstate]]), breakable capsules releasing flavors on demand, and additives colouring the tobacco smoke may be added to cigarette filters.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author1=Ralf Christoph | author2=Bernd Schmidt | author3=Udo Steinberner | author4=Wolfgang Dilla | author5=Reetta Karinen | contribution=Glycerol | title=[[Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry]] | edition=7th | publisher=Wiley | year=2007 | pages=1–16 | doi=10.1002/14356007.a12_477.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author1=Erik Lassner | author2=Wolf-Dieter Schubert | author3=Eberhard Luderitz | author4=Hans Uwe Wolf | contribution=Tungsten, Tungsten Alloys, and Tungsten Compounds | title=[[Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry]] | edition=7th | publisher=Wiley | year=2007 | pages=1–37 | doi=10.1002/14356007.a27_229}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five largest manufactures of filter tow are [[Celanese|Hoechst-Celanese]] and [[Eastman Chemical Company|Eastman Chemicals]] in the United States, [[Rhodia Acetow]] in Germany, [[Daicel]] and Mitsubishi Rayon in Japan.

[[Starch glue]]s or [[emulsion-based adhesive]]s are used for gluing cigarette seams. [[Hot-melt adhesive|Hot-melt]] and emulsion-based adhesives are used for filter seams. Emulsion-based adhesives are used for bonding the filters to the cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author1=Werner Haller | author2=Hermann Onusseit | author3=Gerhard Gierenz | author4=Werner Gruber | author5=Richard D.

Various add-on cigarette filters ("Water Pik", "Venturi", "David Ross") are sold as stop-smoking or tar-reduction devices. The idea is that filters reduce tar-nicotine levels permitting the smoker to be weaned away from cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | editor1=Murray E. Jarvik | editor2=Joseph W.

=== Light cigarettes ===
{{main|Lights (cigarette type)}}
The [[tobacco industry]] has reduced tar and nicotine yields in cigarette smoke since the 1960s. This has been achieved in a variety of ways including use of selected strains of tobacco plant, changes in agricultural and curing procedures, use of reconstituted sheets (reprocessed tobacco leaf wastes), incorporation of tobacco stalks, reduction of the amount of tobacco needed to fill a cigarette by expanding it (like puffed wheat) to increase its "filling power", and by the use of filters and high-porosity wrapping papers. However, just as a drinker tends to drink a larger volume of beer than of wine or spirits, so many smokers tend to modify their smoking pattern inversely according to the strength of the cigarette being smoked. In contrast to the standardized puffing of the smoking machines on which the tar and nicotine yields are based, when a smoker switches to a low-tar, low nicotine cigarette, they smoke more cigarettes, take more puffs and inhale more deeply. Conversely, when smoking a high-tar, high-nicotine cigarette there is a tendency to smoke and inhale less.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | editor1=Murray E. Jarvik | editor2=Joseph W. Cullen | editor3=Ellen R. Gritz | editor4=Thomas M. Vogt | editor5=Louis Jolyon West | title=Research on Smoking Behavior | series=NIDA Research Monograph | volume=17 | author=Michael A. H.

In spite of the changes in cigarette design and manufacturing over the last 50 years, the use of filters and "light" cigarettes neither decreased the nicotine intake per cigarette, nor lowered the incidence of lung cancers ([[National Cancer Institute|NCI]], 2001; IARC 83, 2004; U.S. Surgeon General, 2004).&lt;ref name="epidem"&gt;{{citation | editor1=Robert J. Mason | editor2=V. Courtney Broaddus | editor3=Thomas R. Martin | editor4=Talmadge E. King, Jr. | editor5=Dean E. Schraufnagel | editor6=John F. Murray | editor7=Jay A.

Samet | chapter=Epidemiology of Lung Cancer | volume=1 | edition=5th | year=2010 | publisher=Saunders | isbn=978-1-4160-4710-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift over the years from higher- to lower-yield cigarettes may explain the change in the pathology of [[lung cancer]]. That is, the percentage of lung cancers that are [[adenocarcinoma]]s has increased, while the percentage of [[squamous cell cancer]]s has decreased. The change in tumor type is believed to reflect the higher [[tobacco-specific nitrosamines|nitrosamine]] delivery of lower-yield cigarettes and the increased depth or volume of inhalation of lower-yield cigarettes to compensate for lower level concentrations of nicotine in the smoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | editor1=Robert J.

[[File:Cellulose Acetate.png|thumb|[[Structure formula]] of [[cellulose diacetate]] with one of the acetate groups on the cellulose backbone shown by the red circle.]]

== Safety ==
Cellulose acetate is non-toxic, odorless, tasteless, and weakly flammable. It is resistant to weak acids and is largely stable to mineral and fatty oils as well as petroleum. It is [[biodegradable]] and the raw material is a renewable natural polymer expected to find application for other uses in the future.&lt;ref name="uce"&gt;{{citation|title=[[Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry]]|year=2007|author=Klaus Balser|author2=Lutz Hoppe|author3=Theo Eicher|author4=Martin Wandel|author5=Hans-Joachim Astheimer|author6=Hans Steinmeier|pages=1–45|contribution=Cellulose Esters|edition=7th|publisher=Wiley|doi=10.1002/14356007.a05_419.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smoked cigarette butts contain 5–7&amp;nbsp;mg (~ 0.08-0.11 gr) [[nicotine]] (about 25% of the total cigarette nicotine content), children ingesting &gt;2 whole cigarettes, 6 cigarette butts or a total of 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg/kg (~ 0,0035 gr/lbs) of nicotine should be admitted to a hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | editor=Jerrold B. Leikin | editor2=Frank P. Paloucek | entry=Nicotine | title=Poisoning and Toxicology Handbook | edition=4th | publisher=Informa | year=2008 | pages=494–496 | isbn=978-1-4200-4479-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cellulose acetate is hydrophilic and retains the water-soluble smoke constituents, of which many are irritating (acids, alkali, aldehydes, and phenols), while letting through the lipophilic aromatic compounds.

Smoked cigarette butts and cigarette tobacco are toxic to water organisms such as the [[marine topsmelt]] (''[[Atherinops affinis]]'') and the freshwater [[fathead minnow]] (''[[Pimephales promelas]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Slaughter E, Gersberg RM, Watanabe K, Rudolph J, Stransky C, Novotny TE |title=Toxicity of cigarette butts, and their chemical components, to marine and freshwater fish |journal=Tobacco Control |volume=20 |pages=25–29 |date=2011 | doi = 10.1136/tc.2010.040170 |pmc=3088407 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atmospheric [[moisture]], [[gastric acid]], [[photodegradation|light]], and [[enzyme]]s [[hydrolysis|hydrolyze]] cellulose acetate to [[acetic acid]] and [[cellulose]]. Cellulose may be further hydrolyzed to [[cellobiose]] or [[glucose]] in an acidic medium, and eventually form valuable [[humus]]. Humans cannot digest cellulose and excrete the fibers in feces, because, unlike [[ruminant]] animals, [[rabbit]]s, [[rodent]]s, [[termite]]s, and some bacteria and fungi, they lack cellulolytic enzymes such as [[cellulase]]. Like wood, paper and cotton, cigarette filters in soil rot slowly over months to years.

Cigarette butts are the most common form of anthropogenic (man-made) [[litter]] in the world, as approximately 5.6 trillion cigarettes are smoked every year worldwide.&lt;ref name=IJERPH&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Novotny TE, Lum K, Smith E |title=Cigarettes butts and the case for an environmental policy on hazardous cigarette waste |journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health |volume=6 |pages=1691–705 |date=2009 |display-authors=etal |doi=10.3390/ijerph6051691}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those it is estimated that 4.5 trillion cigarette butts become litter every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.chron.com/sciguy/2010/05/the-world-litters-4-5-trillion-cigarette-butts-a-year-can-we-stop-this/|title=The world litters 4.5 trillion cigarette butts a year. Can we stop this?|publisher=[[The Houston Chronicle]]|accessdate=2014-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[cellulose acetate]] fibers used as the predominant filter material do not readily biodegrade because of the acetyl groups on the cellulose backbone which in itself can quickly be degraded by various microorganisms employing [[cellulase]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://environment.about.com/od/pollution/fl/Are-Cigarette-Butts-Biodegradable.htm||title=Are Cigarette Butts Biodegradable?|author= Frederic Beaudry|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A normal life span of a discarded filter is thought to be up to 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New 'Green' Cigarette Butts Biodegrade Within Days—And Can Even Sprout Into Grass - The company Greenbutts is manufacturing a new filter to address most common litter problem|author=Aaron Cantú|year=2014|url=http://www.alternet.org/environment/new-green-cigarette-butts-biodegrade-within-days-and-can-even-sprout-grass|publisher=alternet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many governments have sanctioned stiff penalties for littering of cigarette filters; for example [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state imposes a penalty of $1,025 for littering cigarette filters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Much of this work relies heavily on the research about the secondary mechanism for photodegradation as stated above.  The next option is using cigarette packs with a compartment for discarded cigarette butts, implementing monetary deposits on filters, increasing the availability of butt receptacles, and expanding public education. It may even be possible to ban the sale of filtered cigarettes altogether on the basis of their adverse [[environmental impact]].&lt;ref name=IJERPH/&gt; Recent research has been put into finding ways to utilizes the filter waste, to develop a desired product. One research group in South Korea have developed a simple one-step process that converts the cellulose acetate in discarded cigarette filters  into a high-performing material that could be integrated into computers, handheld devices, electrical vehicle and wind turbines to store energy.  These materials have demonstrated superior performance as compared to commercially available carbon, [[graphene]] and [[carbon nano tube]]s.  The product is showing high promise as a green alternative for the waste problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0957-4484/25/34/345601/meta;jsessionid=6AD229C8CCE8FE4B20613E8171F79CE7.ip-10-40-2-73|vauthors=Minzae L, Gil-Pyo K, Hyeon DS, Soomin P, Jongheop Y |title=Preparation of energy storage material derived from a used cigarette filter for a supercapacitor electrode |journal=IOP Science |volume=25 |pages=34 |date=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another group of researchers has proposed adding tablets of food grade acid inside the filters. Once wet enough the tablets will release acid that accelerates degradation to around two weeks (instead of using cellulose triacetate and besides of cigarette smoke being quite acidic).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|publication-date = 2012-08-14|url = http://www.environmentalhealthnews.org/ehs/newscience/2012/06/2012-0725-biodegradable-cigarette-filters|publisher = Environmental Health News|title = No more butts: biodegradable filters a step to boot litter problem}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Dutch startup is training [[crow]]s to recognize and pick up cigarette butts in exchange for treats.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author1=Cecile Borkhataria | author2=Cheyenne MacDonald | title=The bizarre project to teach CROWS to clean up city streets by collecting cigarette butts in exchange for treats | journal=[[Daily Mail]] | date=13 October 2017 | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4975664/Startup-teaches-CROWS-collecti-cigarette-butts.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==

The procedure of diagnosis for Cramp Fasciculation Syndrome (CFS) is closely aligned with the diagnosis procedure for [[benign fasciculation syndrome]] (BFS). The differentiation between a diagnosis of BFS versus CFS is usually more severe and prominent pain, cramps and stiffness associated with CFS.

== Treatment ==

Treatment is similar to treatment for [[benign fasciculation syndrome]].

[[Carbamazepine]] therapy has been found to provide moderate reductions in symptoms.&lt;ref name="Cramp-fasciculation syndrome: a treatable hyperexcitable peripheral nerve disorder."/&gt;

Daz Productions, Inc., commonly known as Daz 3D, is a 3D content and software company specializing in providing rigged 3D human models, associated accessory content and software to the hobbyist as well as the prosumer market. Originally a part of [[Zygote Media Group]], a general purpose, application-agnostic 3D content broker, Daz 3D split off as "Digital Art Zone"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harvey|first1=Tom|title=Utah company counts on big giveaway to boost bottom line|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=53801962&amp;itype=CMSID|accessdate=August 18, 2017|work=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=March 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/52704-73|title=Daz 3D Company Profile: Valuation &amp; Investors {{!}} PitchBook|website=pitchbook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; to focus on supplying content for the [[Poser]] market.

Daz 3D continue to focus on 3D content development, but also began to expand their own 3D software offerings as well, with purchases of several notable 3D applications:

* [[Bryce (software)|Bryce]], a fractal-based landscape modeler and renderer acquired from [[Corel]] by DAZ in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/daz-acquires-bryce-from-corel/article1134134/|title=DAZ acquires Bryce from Corel|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Daz 3D developed their own scene creator software, [[DAZ Studio|Daz Studio]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/260280/daz_studio.html|title=DAZ Studio|work=PCWorld|access-date=2018-01-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an alternative to [[Poser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nativetelecom.org/daz3d-review/|title=Daz3d Studio Pro Review - January 2018|date=2018-01-18|work=NATIVETELECOM|access-date=2018-01-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 Daz 3D spun off Morph 3D, a 3D content company intended to focus more on the game developer space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://utahbusiness.com/reality-revolution-virtual-reality-ready-take-utahns-new-landscapes/|title=Reality Revolution: Virtual reality is ready to take Utahns to new landscapes - Utah Business|website=utahbusiness.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Free 3D Software==
In 2012 Daz 3D shifted their strategy from selling 3D software and content to one of giving the 3D software away for free&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=53801962&amp;itype=CMSID|title=Utah company counts on big giveaway to boost bottom line|work=The Salt Lake Tribune|access-date=2018-01-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and focusing more on the selling of the content. This began with offering Daz Studio for free in 2012, which gave customers the ability to render images and video and expanded in 2017 when Daz 3D added Hexagon to the list of their free software products and added the ability to do 3D modeling to that mix.

==Figure Technology==
Daz 3D has had many versions of its human figures and characters, but in 2011 they launched a significant change in the underlying technology.  Instead of each figure being designed individually, Daz 3D moved to their Genesis platform, in which figures were derived as morphs from the base mesh. Two of the key differences that this technology created were: The ability for characters to be blended into a huge variety of shapes, and since these shapes were all derived form a common based, add-on content like clothing, hair, and additional morphs would not only work on all characters, but could actually change with the characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gfxspeak.com/2011/06/02/daz-3d-introduces-unimesh-technology-for-3d-human-models/|title=Daz 3D introduces Genesis technology for 3D human models  : GraphicSpeak|website=gfxspeak.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Genesis platform has gone through several versions since the launch in 2011:

Genesis 2:

One of the shortcomings of the Genesis platform was that although it allowed extremely flexibility in the shape of characters and clothing, it also toned down some of the elements of what made a male or female figure unique.  Genesis 2 changed this by splitting the Genesis base figure into two separate base figures: Genesis 2 Male and Genesis 2 Female.

Genesis 3:

Up until Genesis 3 the Genesis figures had been using TriAx Weight Maps, where many other industry platforms were using Dual Quaternion.  This changed in Genesis 3 to allow Daz 3D figures to be more compatible with other 3D software platforms as well as Game Development platforms.

Genesis 8:

The jump in version naming from Genesis 3 to Genesis 8 was in order to address confusion in naming conventions.  Although Genesis had reached its fourth version, most of the Daz 3D flagship characters were now on their eight versions.  In order to avoid the confusion of Victoria 8 or Michael 8 being Genesis 4 characters, Daz 3D shifted the versioning of Genesis to match with the character versions.

Genesis 8 also includes significant changes in the figure's backward compatibility with previous generations and their content as well as Joint and muscle bends and flexing and facial expressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digisprawl.com/blog/review/review-daz-3ds-victoria-8/|title=Review: DAZ 3D's Victoria 8 - DigiSprawl|date=2017-06-20|work=DigiSprawl|access-date=2018-01-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diseases of poverty''' (also known as '''poverty related diseases''') is the term used to describe diseases that are more prevalent in the low-income population. It includes infectious diseases as well as diseases related to malnutrition and poor health behaviors. Poverty is one of the social determinants of health. The World Health Report, 2002 states that diseases of poverty account for 45% of the disease burden in the countries with high poverty rate which are preventable or treatable with exciting interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/whr/2002/en/|title=World Health Report, 2002|last=World Health organization(WHO)|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diseases of poverty are often [[co-morbid]] and ubiquitous with malnutrition.&lt;ref name= primary&gt;Singh, A. R., &amp; Singh, S. A. (2008). Diseases of Poverty and Lifestyle, Well-Being and Human Development. Mens Sana Monographs, 6(1), 187-225.&lt;/ref&gt;

Poverty and diseases are a ramification of each other. Poverty increases chances of having these diseases as the deprivation of safe shelter, drinking water and food, poor sanitation, lack of knowledge and access to health services contributes towards poor health behaviors which often results into diseases of poverty. At the same time, these diseases act as a barrier for economic growth to affected people and families caring for them which in turn results into increased poverty in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Sachs, J. (2008), The end of poverty: economic possibilities for our time. European Journal of Dental Education, 12: 17-21. doi:10.1111/j.1600-0579.2007.00476.x&lt;/ref&gt;

These diseases triggered in part by poverty are in contrast to so-called "[[diseases of affluence]]", which are diseases thought to be a result of increasing wealth in a society.

==Contributing factors==
For many environmental and social factors, including poor housing conditions and poor working conditions, inadequate [[sanitation]], and disproportionate occupation as [[sex worker]]s, the poor are more likely to be exposed to [[infectious disease]]s.  Malnutrition, mental stress, overwork, inadequate knowledge, and minimal health care can hinder recovery and exacerbate the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Health and Poverty |chapterurl=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2002/english/ch5/index.htm |title=UNFPA State of World Population 2002 |publisher=United Nations Population Fund |url=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2002/english/ch1/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Malnutrition]] is associated with 54% of childhood deaths from diseases of poverty, and lack of skilled attendants during childbirth is primarily responsible for the high maternal and infant death rates among the poor.&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;[http://www.who.int/making_pregnancy_safer/en/ WHO | Ensuring skilled care for every birth.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206064523/http://www.who.int/making_pregnancy_safer/en/|date=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mdg/goals/goal4/en/index.html WHO | Goal 4: reduce child mortality] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820005648/http://www.who.int/mdg/goals/goal4/en/index.html |date=August 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contaminated water===
Each year many children and adults die as a result of a lack of access to [[clean drinking water]] and poor sanitation. Many poverty related diseases such as diarrhea acquire and spread as a result of inadequate access to clean drinking water.  According to UNICEF, 3,000 children die every day, worldwide due to contaminated drinking water and poor sanitation.&lt;ref name=unicef&gt;[http://www.unicefusa.org/work/water/ UNICEF (Water).] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409005419/http://www.unicefusa.org/work/water/ |date=April 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of halving the number of people who did not have access to clean water by 2015, was reached five years ahead of schedule in 2010, there are still 783 million people who rely on unimproved water sources.&lt;ref name=unicef/&gt; In 2010 the United Nations declared access to clean water a fundamental human right, integral to the achievement of other rights.  This made it enforceable and justifiable to permit governments to ensure their populations access to clean water.&lt;ref name= water1&gt;Singh, Nandita, Per Wickenberg, Karsten Åström, and Håkan Hydén. 2012. "Accessing water through a rights-based approach: problems and prospects regarding children." Water Policy 14, no. 2: 298-318.&lt;/ref&gt; Though access to water has improved for some, it continues to be especially difficult for women and children.  Women and girls bear most of the burden for accessing water and supplying it to their households.

In [[Women in India|India]], [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and parts of Latin America, women are required to travel long distances in order to access a clean water source and then bring some water home. This has a significant impact on girls’ educational attainment.&lt;ref name=water1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Access to Clean Water and Sanitation Pose 21st-Century Challenge for Millions" ''JAMA'' 2004;292(3) 318-320. {{DOI|10.1001/jama.292.3.318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been further efforts to improve water quality using new technology which allows water to be disinfected immediately upon collection and during the storage process.  Clean water is necessary for cooking, cleaning, and laundry because many people come into contact with disease causing pathogens through their food, or while bathing or washing.&lt;ref&gt;Mintz, E., Reiff, F., &amp; Tauxe, R. (1995). Safe water treatment and storage in the home. A practical new strategy to prevent waterborne disease. JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association, 273(12), 948-953.&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Flint water crisis|ongoing issue of contaminated water in the United States]] has been taking place in [[Flint, Michigan]]. On September 4, 2018, evidence of E Coli and other organisms that can cause disease were found in the water. The issue of contaminated water in Flint, Michigan started when the source for drinking water in Flint was  changed from the Lake Huron and the Detroit River to the very cheap Flint River.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Inadequate sanitation ===
Contaminated water and inadequate sanitation are related to diseases of poverty such as malaria, [[parasitic disease]]s, and [[schistosomiasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Common water and sanitation-related diseases |year=2005 |work= |publisher=UNICEF |url=http://www.unicef.org/wash/index_wes_related.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; These infections act as cofactors that increase the risk of HIV transmission.&lt;ref name=Stillwaggon08/&gt;

Standpipes and sanitation are provided in most developing areas, but the death rates are not significantly reduced. One of the reasons that water-related diseases are still occurring is because water supplies can be contacted by contaminated surface water. To effectively decrease the morbidity and mortality of diseases, the population should get access to water from home instead from outside. Therefore, in addition to the installation of standpipes, water supplies and sanitation should be provided within houses.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Julia A., and Kenneth S. Warren. 1980. Selective primary health care: An interim strategy for disease control in developing countries. Social Science &amp; Medicine. Part C: Medical Economics 14 (2):145-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poor nutrition===
Malnutrition disproportionately affect those in sub-Saharan Africa. Over 35 percent of children under the age of 5 in sub-Saharan Africa show physical signs of malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Piwoz00"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dec.org/pdf_docs/PNACK673.pdf|title=HIV/AIDS and Nutrition: A Review of the Literature and Recommendations for Nutritional Care and Support in Sub-Saharan Africa|date=December 2000|publisher=Academy for Educational Development|location=Washington DC|format=PDF|id=PN-ACK-673|author1=Piwoz, Ellen G. |author2=Preble, Elizabeth A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Malnutrition, the immune system, and infectious diseases operate in a cyclical manner: infectious diseases have deleterious effects on nutritional status, and nutritional deficiencies can lower the strength of the immune system which affects the body’s ability to resist infections.&lt;ref name=Piwoz00/&gt; Similarly, malnutrition of both [[macronutrients]] (such as [[protein]] and [[energy]]) and [[micronutrients]] (such as [[iron]], [[zinc]], and [[vitamins]]) increase susceptibility to HIV infections by interfering with the immune system and through other biological mechanisms. Depletion of macro-nutrients and micro-nutrients promotes [[viral replication]] that contributes to greater risks of HIV transmission from mother-to-child as well as those through sexual transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Friis H, Michaelsen KF |title=Micronutrients and HIV infection: a review |journal=Eur J Clin Nutr |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=157–63 |date=March 1998 |pmid=9537299 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejcn.1600546 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased mother-to-child transmission is related to specific deficiencies in micro-nutrients such as vitamin A.&lt;ref name=Semba94/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nimmagadda A, O'Brien WA, Goetz MB |title=The significance of vitamin A and carotenoid status in persons infected by the human immunodeficiency virus |journal=Clin.

HIV infection can affect the production of hormones that interfere with the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.&lt;ref name=Piwoz00/&gt;

In the United States, 11.1 percent of households struggle with food insecurity.&lt;ref name=food&gt;Chilton, M. (2009). A Rights-Based Approach to Food Insecurity in the United States. American Journal of Public Health, 99(7), 1203.&lt;/ref&gt;   Food insecurity refers to the lack of access to quality food for a healthy lifestyle.&lt;ref name= food /&gt;  The rate of hunger and malnutrition in female headed households was three times the national average at 30.2 percent. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 10 percent of the population in Latin America and the Caribbean are affected by hunger and malnutrition.&lt;ref name="hunger"&gt;[http://www.fao.org Freeing Latin America and the Caribbean from hunger]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918232726/http://www.fao.org/ |date=September 18, 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poor housing conditions ===
Quality and affordability of housing are one of the major concerns in public health. Poor housing conditions can be described as leaks, molds, indoor air pollutant, overcrowding, hazardous structures, affordability of home heating, and poor ergonomics. Housing insecurities are very common among the poor. It is often associated with infectious diseases, lead exposure, injuries, and mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Krieger, J., &amp; Higgins, D. L. (2002). Housing and health: time again for public health action. ''American journal of public health'', ''92''(5), 758-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lack of access to health services ===
According to WHO, medical strategies report, approximately 30% of the global population does not have regular access to exciting medicines. In the poorest parts of Africa and Asia, this percent goes up to 50%.&lt;ref&gt;WHO, Medicines Strategy Report 2002–2003&lt;/ref&gt; The population below the poverty line lacks access due to higher retail price and unavailability of the medicines. The higher cost can be due to the higher manufacturing price or due to local or regional tax and Value Added Tax. There is a significant disparity in the research conducted in the health sector. It is claimed that only 10% of the health research conducted globally focuses on 90% disease burden. However, diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases etc that traditionally were associated with the wealthier community are now becoming more prevalent in the poor communities as well. Hence, the research conducted now is relevant to poor population.&lt;ref name="IPN 10/90" /&gt; Political priority is also one of the contributing factors of inaccessibility. The government of poor countries may allocate less funding to public health due to the scarcity of resources.

==Diseases==
Together, diseases of poverty kill approximately 14 million people annually.{{dead link|date=June 2016}}&lt;ref name="results.org"/&gt;  [[Gastroenteritis]] with its associated [[diarrhea]] results in about 1.8&amp;nbsp;million deaths in children yearly with most of these in the world's poorest nations.&lt;ref name=M93&gt;{{cite book|last=Dolin|first=[edited by] Gerald L.

At the global level, the three primary PRDs are tuberculosis, AIDS/HIV and malaria.&lt;ref name="wpro.who.int"&gt;[http://www.wpro.who.int/media_centre/press_releases/pr_20020916.htm WHO/WPRO-Poverty Issues Dominate RCM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110403044412/http://www.wpro.who.int/media_centre/press_releases/pr_20020916.htm|date=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Developing countries]] account for 95% of the global AIDS prevalence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=HIV/AIDS and Poverty |chapterurl=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2002/english/ch6/index.htm |title=UNFPA State of World Population 2002 |publisher=United Nations Population Fund |url=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2002/english/ch1/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 98% of active tuberculosis infections.&lt;ref name="results.org"&gt;[http://www.results.org/website/article.asp?id=238 RESULTS: World Health/Diseases of Poverty.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703171704/http://www.results.org/website/article.asp?id=238 |date=July 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, 90% of malaria deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rbm.who.int/cmc_upload/0/000/015/372/RBMInfosheet_1.htm Roll Back Malaria Partnership: What is malaria?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423085034/http://www.rbm.who.int/cmc_upload/0/000/015/372/RBMInfosheet_1.htm |date=April 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, these three diseases account for 10% of global [[Mortality rate|mortality]].&lt;ref name="wpro.who.int"/&gt;

Treatable childhood diseases are another set which have disproportionately higher rates in poor countries despite the availability of cures for decades. These include [[measles]], [[pertussis]] and [[polio]].&lt;ref name="IPN 10/90"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/intellectualproperty/submissions/InternationalPolicyNetwork.pdf |title=Diseases of Poverty and the 10/90 gap |author=Stevens, Philip |date=November 2004 |publisher=International Policy Network |accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest three poverty-related diseases (PRDs)  — [[AIDS]], [[malaria]], and [[tuberculosis]] — account for 18% of diseases in poor countries.&lt;ref name="IPN 10/90" /&gt; The disease burden of treatable childhood diseases in high-mortality, poor countries is 5.2% in terms of [[disability-adjusted life year]]s but just 0.2% in the case of advanced countries.&lt;ref name="IPN 10/90" /&gt;

In addition, [[infant mortality]] and [[maternal mortality]] are far more prevalent among the poor. For example, 98% of the 11,600 daily maternal and [[neonate|neonatal]] deaths occur in [[developing countries]].&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;

Three other diseases, [[measles]], [[pneumonia]], and [[diarrheal diseases]], are also closely associated with poverty, and are often included with AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis in broader definitions and discussions of diseases of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090703171704/http://www.results.org/website/article.asp?id=238 World Health/Diseases of Poverty.] Retrieved 05 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neglected diseases===
{{main|Neglected tropical diseases}}
Based upon the spread of research in cures for diseases, certain diseases are identified and referred to as "[[neglected tropical diseases|neglected diseases]]". These include the following diseases:&lt;ref name="IPN 10/90"/&gt;
*[[African trypanosomiasis]]
*[[Chagas disease]]
*[[Leishmaniasis]]
*[[Lymphatic filariasis]]
*[[Dracunculiasis]] (“[[Guinea worm]] disease”)
*[[Onchocerciasis]]
*[[Schistosomiasis]]
*[[Trichomoniasis]]

Tropical diseases such as these tend to be neglected in research and development efforts. Of 1393 new drugs brought into use over a period of 25 years (1975–1999), only a total of thirteen, less than 1%, related to these diseases. Of 20 MNC drug companies surveyed for research on PRDs, only two had projects targeted towards these neglected PRDs. However, the combined total number of deaths due to these diseases is dwarfed by the enormous number of patients affected by PRDs such as respiratory infections, HIV/AIDS, diarrhea and tuberculosis, besides many others.&lt;ref name="IPN 10/90"/&gt;
Similar to the spread of tropical neglected diseases in developing nations, these neglected infections disproportionately affect poor and minority populations in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Hotez PJ (2008) Neglected Infections of Poverty in the United States of America.PLoS Negl Trop Dis 2(6):e256.doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0000256&lt;/ref&gt;  These diseases have been identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as priorities for [[public health]] action based on the number of people infected, the severity of the illnesses, and the ability to prevent and treat them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/npi.html Centers For Disease Control.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511091447/http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/npi.html |date=May 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trichomoniasis====
Trichomoniasis is the most common sexually transmitted infection affecting more than 200 million people worldwide. It is especially prevalent among young, poor and African American women.  This infection is also common in poor communities in Sub-Saharan Africa and impoverished parts of Asia. This neglected infection is one of special concern because it is associated with a heightened risk for contracting HIV and pre-term deliveries.&lt;ref&gt;Ko, H., Jamieson, D. J., Hogan, J. W., Anderson, J., Klein, R. S., Susan, C., &amp; Paula, S. (2002). Prevalence, Incidence, and Persistence or Recurrence of Trichomoniasis among Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-Positive Women and among HIV-Negative Women at High Risk for HIV Infection" ''Clinical Infectious Diseases'' 34(10), 1406-1411.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, availability of cures and recent advances in medicine have led to only three diseases being considered neglected diseases, namely, African trypanosomiasis, Chagas disease and Leishmaniasis.&lt;ref name="IPN 10/90"/&gt;

===Malaria===
Africa accounts for a majority of [[malaria]] infections and deaths worldwide. Over 80 percent of the 300 to 500 million malaria infections occurring annually worldwide are in Africa.&lt;ref name= malaria&gt;Crosse, M. (2005).

===Intestinal parasites===
[[Intestinal parasites]] are extremely prevalent in tropical areas.&lt;ref name=Stillwaggon08/&gt; These include [[hookworms]], [[roundworms]], and other [[amoebas]]. They can aggravate malnutrition by depleting essential nutrients through intestinal [[blood loss]] and chronic [[diarrhea]]. Chronic worm infections can further burden the immune system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bentwich Z, Kalinkovich A, Weisman Z |title=Immune activation is a dominant factor in the pathogenesis of African AIDS |journal=Immunol.

===Schistosomiasis===
[[Schistosomiasis]] (bilharzia) is a parasitic disease caused by the parasitic flatworm [[trematodes]]. Moreover, more than 80 percent of the 200 million people worldwide who have schistosomiasis live in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name=WHO04Schisto&gt;[http://www.who.int/tdt/diseases/schisto/diseaseinfo.htm Schistosomiasis.

After penetrating the skin and eventually traveling to the intestines or the urinary tract, the parasite lays eggs and infects those organs.&lt;ref name=Stillwaggon08/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO04Schisto/&gt; It damages the [[intestines]], [[bladder]], and other organs and can lead to anemia and protein-energy deficiency.&lt;ref name=Scrimshaw97/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stephenson L |title=The impact of schistosomiasis on human nutrition |journal=Parasitology |volume=107 |issue=Suppl|pages=S107–23 |year=1993 |pmid=8115176 |doi=10.1017/S0031182000075545 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with malaria, schistosomiasis is one of the most important parasitic co-factors aiding in HIV transmission. Epidemiological data shows schistosome-endemic areas coincide with areas of high HIV prevalence, suggesting that parasitic infections such as schistosomiasis increase risk of HIV transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Harms G, Feldmeier H |title=HIV infection and tropical parasitic diseases — deleterious interactions in both directions? |journal=Trop.

===Tuberculosis===
[[Tuberculosis]] is the leading cause of death around the world for an infectious disease.&lt;ref&gt;Tuberculosis: Commentary on a Reemergent Killer. Barry R. Bloom and Christopher J. L. Murray.&lt;/ref&gt; This disease is especially prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, and the Latin American and Caribbean region.  While the tuberculosis rate is decreasing in the rest of the world, it is increasing by rate of 6 percent per year in Sub-Saharan Africa.  It is the leading cause of death for people with HIV in Africa. Tuberculosis (TB) is closely related to lifestyles of poverty, overcrowded conditions, alcoholism, stress, drug addiction and malnutrition.   This disease spreads quickly among people who are undernourished.&lt;ref name= primary/&gt; According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, in the United States, tuberculosis is more prevalent among foreign born persons, and ethnic minorities.  The rates are especially high among Hispanics, Blacks and Asians.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Morbidity and Mortality Report. March 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
HIV infection and TB are also closely tied.  Being infected with HIV increases the rate of activation of latent TB infections, and having TB, increases the rate of HIV replication, therefore accelerating the progression of AIDS.&lt;ref name= primary/&gt;

===AIDS===

Many of the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are ravaged with poverty and many people live on less than one United States dollar a day.&lt;ref name= Stillwaggon&gt;Elieen Stillwaggon, Aids and the Ecology of Poverty. Oxford University Press. New York&lt;/ref&gt; The poverty in these countries gives rise to many other factors that explain the high prevalence of AIDS. The poorest people in most African countries suffer from malnutrition, lack of access to clean water, and have improper sanitation.  Because of a lack of clean water many people are plagued by intestinal parasites that significantly increase their chances of contracting HIV due to compromised immune system.  Malaria, a disease still rampant in Africa also increases the risk of contracting HIV.  These parasitic diseases, affect the body’s immune response to HIV, making people more susceptible to contracting the disease once exposed.  Genital schistosomiasis, also prevalent in the topical areas of Sub-Saharan Africa and many countries worldwide, produces genital lesions and attract CD4 cells to the genital region which promotes HIV infection.  All these factors contribute to the high rate of HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa. Many of the factors seen in Africa are also present in Latin America and the Caribbean and contribute to the high rates of infections seen in those regions.  In the United States, poverty is a contributing factor to HIV infections.  [[Race and health in the United States|There is also a large racial disparity]], with African Americans having a significantly higher rate of infection than their white counterparts.&lt;ref name= Stillwaggon/&gt;

===Asthma===
More than 300 million people worldwide have [[asthma]]. The rate of asthma increases as countries become more urbanized and in many parts of the world those who develop asthma do not have access to medication and medical care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ginasthma.org/reports-global-burden-of-asthma.html "Global Burden of Asthma."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524032919/http://www.ginasthma.org/reports-global-burden-of-asthma.html |date=May 24, 2012 }} Matthew Masoli, Denise Fabian, Shaun Holt, Richard Beasley. Report developed for: Global Initiative for Asthma.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the United States, African Americans and Latinos are four times more likely to suffer from severe asthma than whites.

===Cardiovascular disease===
Though [[heart disease]] is not exclusive to the poor, there are aspects of a life of poverty that contribute to its development.  This category includes [[coronary heart disease]], [[stroke]] and [[heart attack]].  Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and there are disparities of morbidity between the rich and poor.  Studies from around the world link heart disease to poverty. Low neighborhood income and education were associated with higher risk factors.   Poor diet, lack of exercise and limited (or no) access to a specialist were all factors related to poverty, though to contribute to heart disease.&lt;ref&gt;John Yinger, Housing Discrimination and Residential Segregation.  Understanding Poverty. New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
Both low income and low education were predictors of coronary heart disease, a subset of cardiovascular disease.  Of those admitted to hospital in the United States for heart failure, women and African Americans were more likely to reside in lower income neighborhoods.  In the developing world, there is a 10 fold increase in cardiac events in the black and urban populations.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, G., &amp; Carrington, M. (2007). "Tackling heart disease and poverty."

===Obstetrical fistula===
[[Obstetric fistula]] or vaginal fistula is a medical condition in which a [[fistula]] (hole) develops between either the [[rectum]] and [[vagina]] (see [[rectovaginal fistula]]) or between the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] and vagina (see [[vesicovaginal fistula]]) after severe or failed [[childbirth]], when adequate medical care is not available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Creanga|first=A.

===Dental decay===
Dental decay or [[dental caries]] is the gradual destruction of tooth enamel.  Poverty is a significant determinant for oral health.&lt;ref&gt;DYE, B. (2010). Trends in Oral Health by Poverty Status as Measured by Healthy People 2010 Objectives. Public Health Reports, 125(6), 817.&lt;/ref&gt; Dental caries is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide.  In the United States it is the most common chronic disease of childhood.  Risk factors for dental caries includes living in poverty, poor education, low socioeconomic status, being part of an ethnic minority group, having a developmental disability, recent immigrants and people infected with HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;Selwitz, R. H., Ismail, A. I., &amp; Pitts, N. B. (2007). Dental caries" ''Lancet'' 369(9555), 51-59&lt;/ref&gt;  In Peru, poverty was found to be positively correlated with dental caries among children.&lt;ref name="Delgado-Angulo, E. 2009"&gt;Delgado-Angulo, E., Hobdell, M., &amp; Bernabé, E.

==Consequences==
Diseases of poverty reflect the dynamic relationship between poverty and poor health; while such diseases result directly from poverty, they also perpetuate and deepen impoverishment by sapping personal and national health and financial resources. For example, malaria decreases GDP growth by up to 1.3% in some developing nations, and by killing tens of millions in sub-Saharan Africa, AIDS alone threatens “the economies, social structures, and political stability of entire societies”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rbm.who.int/cmc_upload/0/000/015/363/RBMInfosheet_10.htm |title=Roll Back Malaria Partnership: Economic costs of malaria |publisher=Rbm.who.int |accessdate=2012-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108065231/http://www.rbm.who.int/cmc_upload/0/000/015/363/RBMInfosheet_10.htm |archivedate=2012-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2002/english/ch6/page2.htm |title=UNFPA State of World Population 2002 |publisher=Unfpa.org |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===For women===
Women and children are often put at a high risk of being infected by schistosomiasis, which in turn puts them at a higher risk of acquiring HIV.&lt;ref name=Stillwaggon08/&gt; Since the mode of schistosomiasis transmission is usually through contaminated water in streams and lakes, women and children who do their household chores by the water are more likely to acquire the disease. Activities that women and children often do around waterfront include washing clothes, collecting water, bathing, and swimming.&lt;ref name=Stillwaggon08/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO04Schisto/&gt; Women who have schistosomiasis lesions are three times more likely to be infected with HIV.&lt;ref name=Kjetland06&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kjetland EF |title=Association between genital schistosomiasis and HIV in rural Zimbabwean women |journal=AIDS |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=593–600 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16470124 |doi=10.1097/01.aids.0000210614.45212.0a |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?doi=10.1097/01.aids.0000210614.45212.0a |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Ndhlovu PD |author3=Gomo E |display-authors=3 |last4=Mduluza |first4=Takafira |last5=Midzi |first5=Nicholas |last6=Gwanzura |first6=Lovemore |last7=Mason |first7=Peter R |last8=Sandvik |first8=Leiv |last9=Friis |first9=Henrik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women also have a higher risk of HIV transmission through the use of medical equipment such as needles.&lt;ref name=Stillwaggon08/&gt; Because more women than men use health services, especially during pregnancy, they are more likely to come across unsterilized needles for injections.&lt;ref name=Gisselquist03/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kjetland06/&gt; Although statistics estimate that unsterilized needles only account for 5 to 10 percent of primary HIV infections, studies show this mode of HIV transmission may be higher than reported.&lt;ref name=Stillwaggon08/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Drucker E, Alcabes PG, Marx PA |title=The injection century: massive unsterile injections and the emergence of human pathogens |journal=Lancet |volume=358 |issue=9297 |pages=1989–92 |date=December 2001 |pmid=11747942 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)06967-7 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(01)06967-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increased risk of contracting HIV through non-sexual means has social consequences for women as well.

===Relating to human capabilities===
Malnutrition associated with HIV impacts people’s ability to provide for themselves and their dependents, thus limiting the [[capabilities approach|human capabilities]] of both themselves and their dependents.&lt;ref name=Piwoz00/&gt; HIV can negatively affect work output, which impacts the ability to generate income.&lt;ref&gt;Hsu, Jean W-C., Paul B. Pencharz, Dereck Macallan, and Andrew Tomkins. 2005 "Macronutrients and HIV/AIDS: A Review of Current Evidence." Presented April 2005 for the Consultation on Nutrition and HIV/AIDS in Africa: Evidence, lessons and recommendations for action.&lt;/ref&gt; This is crucial in parts of Africa where [[farming]] is the primary occupation and obtaining food is dependent on the agricultural outcome. Without adequate [[food production]], malnutrition becomes more prevalent. Children are often collateral damage in the AIDS crisis. As dependents, they can be burdened by the illness and eventual death of one or both parents due to HIV/AIDS.

There are a number of proposals for reducing the diseases of poverty and eliminating health disparities within and between countries. The World Health Organization proposes closing the gaps by acting on social determinants.&lt;ref name= commission&gt;Commission on the Social Determinants of Health. Closing the Gap in a Generation. World Health Organization, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;   
Their first recommendation is to improve daily living conditions.  This area involves improving the lives of women and girls so that their children are born in healthy environments and placing an emphasis on early childhood health.  
Their second recommendation is to tackle the inequitable distribution of money, power and resources.  This would involve building stronger public sectors and changing the way in which society is organized.  
Their third recommendation is to measure and understand the problem and assess the impact of action. This would involve training policy makers and healthcare practitioners to recognize problems and form policy solutions.&lt;ref name= commission/&gt; 

==== Health in All Policies ====
The 8th Global Conference on Health Promotion held in Helsinki in June 2013 &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;The 8th Global Conference on Health Promotion (2014). ''Health in all policies: Helsinki statement. Framework for country action''. Helsinki, Finland: World Health Organization.&lt;/ref&gt; has proposed an approach termed Health in All Policies. Health inequalities are shaped by many powerful forces and social, political, and economic determinants. Governments have a responsibility to ensure that their people are able to live healthy lives and have equitable access to achieving a reasonable state of good health. Policies that governments craft and implement in all sectors have a significant and ongoing impact on public health, health equity, and the lives of their citizens. Increases in technology, medical innovation, and living conditions have led to the disappearance of diseases and other factors contributing to poor health. However, there are many diseases of poverty that still persist in developed and developing countries. Tackling these health inequalities and diseases of poverty requires a willingness to engage the whole government in health. The Helskinki Statement lays out a framework of action for countries and calls on governments to make a commitment to building health equity within their country. 

Health in All Policies (HiAP) is an approach to public policies across all sectors of government that takes into account the health implications of all government and policy decisions to improve health equity across all populations residing within the borders of a country. This concept is built upon principles in line with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, The United Nations Millennium Development Declaration, and principles of good governance &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;: legitimacy given by national and international law, accountability of government, transparency of policy making, participation of citizens, sustainability ensuring policies meet the needs of both present and future generations, and collaboration across sectors and levels of government. 

Finally the Framework lists and expands upon six steps for implementation &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; that may be undertaken by a country in taking action towards Health in All Policies. These are components of action and not a rigid checklist of steps to adhere to. The most important aspect of this policy is that governments should adapt the policy to suit the needs of their citizens, their socioeconomic situation, and their governance system.

# Establish the need and priorities for HiAP
# Frame planned action
# Identify supportive structures and processes
# Facilitate assessment and engagement
# Ensure monitoring, evaluation, and reporting
# Build capacity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===HIV/AIDS policy===
* Nutrition Supplements: Focusing on reversing the pattern of malnutrition in sub-Saharan African and other poor countries is a one possible way of decreasing susceptibility to HIV infections. Micro-nutrients such as iron and vitamin A can be delivered and provided at a very low cost. For example, vitamin A supplements cost $0.02 per capsule if provided twice a year. Iron supplements per child cost $0.02 if provided weekly or $0.08 if provided daily.&lt;ref name=Stillwaggon08/&gt;
* Eliminating Co-factors: Tackling the very diseases that increase risk of HIV infections can help slow down the rates of HIV transmission. Co-factors such as malaria and parasitic infections can be combated in an effective and cost-efficient manner. For example, [[mosquito nets]] can be easily used to prevent malaria.&lt;ref name=Stillwaggon08/&gt; Parasites can be eliminated with medication that is cost-effective and easy to administer. Twice-yearly treatments range from $0.02 to $0.25 depending on the type of worm.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank. 2003.

[[Lieutenant General]] '''Emmanuel Kwasi Kotoka''' (26 September 1926 – 17 April 1967) was a member of the ruling [[National Liberation Council]] which came to power in [[Ghana]] in a military [[coup d'état]] on 24 February 1966.  This overthrew the government of [[Kwame Nkrumah|Dr. Kwame Nkrumah]], the first [[president]] of the [[republic]].

==Early life==
Emmanuel Kotoka was born at Alakple,&lt;ref name="ghanaweb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/people/pop-up.php?ID=120 |title=Lt-Gen Emmanuel Kwasi Kotoka |accessdate=2007-03-19  |date= |year= |month= |work=Famous Ghanaians: Heads of State |publisher=Ghana Home Page }}&lt;/ref&gt; a village in the [[Keta District|Keta district]] of the [[Volta Region]] of the [[Gold Coast (British colony)]].  He completed his basic education at the Alakple Roman Catholic School and later the Anloga Senior School in 1941.&lt;ref name="ghanaweb"/&gt; He started training as a goldsmith but switched to a career in the military.

==Military career==
In July 1947, he enlisted as a private in the Infantry School of the [[Gold Coast Regiment]] at [[Teshie]] in [[Accra]].  He rose through the ranks, becoming a [[sergeant]] in 1948 and later Company Sergeant Major in 1951.&lt;ref name="ghanaweb"/&gt; In 1952, he was among some west African soldiers selected for training at [[Eaton Hall (Cheshire)|Eaton Hall]] Officer Cadet School&lt;ref name="Kraus"/&gt; in the [[United Kingdom]].  In 1954, he was commissioned as a [[lieutenant]]&lt;ref name="Kraus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~amaah/writings/ghana-without-nkrumah-men-in-charge.html |title=Ghana Without Nkrumah – The Men In Charge |accessdate=2007-03-19 |author=Jon Kraus |date=April 1966 |work=Africa Report |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519094813/http://home.comcast.net/~amaah/writings/ghana-without-nkrumah-men-in-charge.html |archivedate=2007-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and seconded to the [[British army]] on the [[Rhine]].

On his return to the [[Gold Coast (British Colony)|Gold Coast]] (as Ghana was then called), he was made a Platoon Commander of the Second Gold Coast Regiment of Infantry.  He rose to become the Second-in-Command and in 1959 became the Platoon Commander with the rank of [[Captain (land and air)|Captain]].  He was promoted to the rank of [[Major]] later that year.  In 1960, he attended the Company Commander's course at the School of Infantry in [[Warminster]], [[England]].   In 1960, he was the commander of D company of the detachment of the Second Battalion of the Ghana army which made up Ghana's contingent in the [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] deployed in the capital, Leopoldville, now [[Kinshasa]] in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  He was regarded as a national hero following this deployment. He was awarded the Ghana Service Order for Exceptional Bravery for Distinguished Service in the Congo in 1963.&lt;ref name="ghanaweb"/&gt; He later became the Commander of  the Second Infantry Brigade (now the Northern Command) of the [[Ghana Army]]) located at  [[Kumasi]].&lt;ref name="Kraus"/&gt;

==Politics==
In 1965, the then [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] Kotoka was transferred to Kumasi where he met and became friends with then [[Akwasi Afrifa|Major Akwasi Amankwa Afrifa]], an officer in the Second Brigade of the Ghana army.&lt;ref name="ghanaweb"/&gt;  The two are generally credited with being among the key conspirators behind the first bloody coup d'état in Ghana on 24 February 1966 which brought an end to the first republic.  They codenamed it "Operation Cold Chop".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghana.gov.gh/NRC/Vol%204%20Chpt%201%20com.sec.rep.pdf |title=The Security Services |accessdate=2007-06-11 |work=National Reconciliation Commission Report Volume 4 Chapter 1 |format=pdf |pages=24 |date=October 2004 |publisher=Ghana government |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016012351/http://www.ghana.gov.gh/NRC/Vol%204%20Chpt%201%20com.sec.rep.pdf |archivedate=October 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Kotoka who announced the coup to the nation early that morning from the Broadcasting House of the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation, the official radio station in Ghana.  The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] appears to have been aware about the plotting of the coup at least a year ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/www/about_state/history/vol_xxiv/y.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010617002556/http://www.state.gov/www/about_state/history/vol_xxiv/y.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2001-06-17 |title=253.

Kotoka was promoted [[Major General]] and became a member of the ruling National Liberation Council and also the Commissioner for  [[Health|Ministry of Health]] as well as [[General Officer Commanding]] the Ghana Armed Forces.

==Death==
On 17 April 1967,  there was an abortive coup attempt involving junior officers of the reconnaissance regiment located at [[Ho, Ghana|Ho]] in the [[Volta Region]].  It was code named "[[Guitar-boy]]". It led to the killing of Kotoka by [[Lt. Moses Yeboah]] after heavy fighting.  Lt. Moses Yeboah and another colleague were later tried and executed by a military tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+gh0147) |title=The National Liberation Council, 1966–69 |accessdate=2007-03-25 |work=Library of Congress Country Studies – Ghana: The Military and the Government |publisher=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ghana International Airport was renamed [[Kotoka International Airport]] in his memory.  He was killed at a spot which is now part of the forecourt of the airport and his statue stands at that point.

{{Flu}}
:''See [[Influenza]] for details about the illnesses and [[Influenza A virus subtype H5N1]] and [[Influenza A virus subtype H3N2]] for details about the causative agents.''

'''Fujian flu''' refers to [[flu]] caused by either a Fujian [[human flu]] strain of the [[H3N2]] subtype of the ''[[Influenzavirus A|Influenza A virus]]'' or a Fujian [[Avian influenza|bird flu]] strain of the [[H5N1]] subtype of the ''Influenza A virus''. These strains are named after [[Fujian]], a coastal [[Province of China|province]] of the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Fujian]] also borders the north of China's [[Guangdong]] province, where [[Hong Kong]] is. Hong Kong is important in the early history of [[H5N1]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A/Fujian (H3N2) human flu (from A/Fujian/411/2002(H3N2) -like flu virus strains) caused an unusually severe 2003–2004 flu season. This was due to a [[reassortment]] event that caused a minor clade to provide a [[haemagglutinin]] gene that later became part of the dominant strain in the 2002–2003 flu season. A/Fujian (H3N2) was made part of the trivalent influenza vaccine for the 2004-2005 [[flu season]] and its descendants are still the most common human H3N2 strain.

A/Fujian (H5N1) bird flu is notable for its resistance to standard medical countermeasures and its rapid spread. This variant of the H5N1 virus also illustrates the continuing evolution of the [[H5N1]] virus, and its emergence has caused political controversy.

==Terminology==
Phrases used to identify the flu or the causative agent include "Fujian-like"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/hotnews/6ah311643240049.html Infection Control Today] article ''Control Measures Fail to Stop Spread of New H5N1 Virus'' Published 31 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and "Fujian virus"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=56286 Medical News Today] article ''H5N1 Bird Flu Virus Is Changing, FAO And OIE Recommend Increased Surveillance When Vaccinating'' published 10 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[H5N1]] version and "Fujian-like"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bupa.co.uk/health_information/html/health_news/131103fujian.html Hot topic - Fujian-like strain A influenza]&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[H3N2]] version.

Both are also sometimes specified as "Type A Fujian flu" or "A/Fujian flu" referring to the species ''[[influenzavirus A|Influenza A virus]]''. Both are also sometimes specified according to their species subtype: "Fujian Flu (H3N2)" or "Fujian Flu (H5N1)". Or both, example: "A-Fujian-H3N2".

"A/Fujian/411/2002-like (H3N2)" and "Influenza A/Fujian/411/02(H3N2)-lineage viruses" are examples of using the full name of the virus strains.

==A/Fujian (H3N2)==
In the 2003-2004 flu season the [[influenza vaccine]] was produced to protect against A/Panama ([[H3N2]]), A/New Caledonia ([[H1N1]]), and [[Influenzavirus B|B]]/Hong Kong. A new strain, A/Fujian (H3N2), was discovered after production of the vaccine started and vaccination gave only partial protection against this strain. Nature magazine reported that the [[Influenza Genome Sequencing Project]], using phylogenetic analysis of 156 [[H3N2]] genomes, "explains the appearance, during the 2003–2004 season, of the 'Fujian/411/2002'-like strain, for which the existing vaccine had limited effectiveness" as due to an epidemiologically significant reassortment. "Through a reassortment event, a minor clade provided the haemagglutinin gene that later became part of the dominant strain after the 2002–2003 season. Two of our samples, A/New York/269/2003 ([[H3N2]]) and A/New York/32/2003 ([[H3N2]]), show that this minor clade continued to circulate in the 2003–2004 season, when most other isolates were reassortants."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7062/full/nature04239.html Nature]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2004, the predominant flu virus circulating in humans in Europe was influenza A/Fujian/411/2002 (H3N2)-like.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eiss.org/cgi-files/bulletin_v2.cgi?display=1&amp;code=107&amp;bulletin=107 EISS - Weekly Electronic Bulletin] article ''Influenza activity on the rise in the east of Europe'' dated 23 January 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 15 June 2004, [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] had antigenically characterized 1,024 influenza viruses collected by U.S. laboratories since 1 October 2003: 949 influenza A ([[H3N2]]) viruses, three influenza A (H1) viruses, one influenza A ([[H7N2]]) virus, and 71 influenza B viruses. Of the 949 influenza A (H3N2) isolates characterized, 106 (11.2%) were similar antigenically to the vaccine strain A/Panama/2007/1999 (H3N2), and 843 (88.8%) were similar to the drift variant, A/Fujian/411/2002 (H3N2).&lt;ref name= "CDC 2003 to 2005"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5325a1.htm CDC] article ''Update: Influenza Activity --- United States and Worldwide, 2003&amp;mdash;04 Season, and Composition of the 2004&amp;mdash;05 Influenza Vaccine'' published 2 July 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2004-2005 flu season trivalent influenza vaccine for the United States contained A/New Caledonia/20/1999-like (H1N1), A/Fujian/411/2002-like (H3N2), and B/Shanghai/361/2002-like viruses.&lt;ref name= "CDC 2003 to 2005"/&gt;

Flu Watch reported for 13 February to 19 February 2005 that:
:"The National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) has antigenically characterized 516 influenza viruses: 470 influenza A (H3N2) and 46 influenza B viruses. Of the 470 influenza A (H3N2), 427 (91%) were A/Fujian/411/2002 (H3N2)-like and 43 (9%) A/California/7/2004-like viruses. Of the 46 influenza B, 45 were B/Shanghai/361/02-like and one B/HongKong/330/2001-like virus. Although the A/California/7/2004 (H3N2)-like isolates have reduced titres to the A/Fujian/411/2002-like antisera, the H3N2 component of the current vaccine is still expected to provide some level of protection against this new variant. The WHO has recommended that the vaccine for the 2005/06 northern hemisphere season contain the A/California/7/2004 (H3N2)-like virus."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/fluwatch/04-05/w07_05/index.html Flu Watch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050913024425/http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/fluwatch/04-05/w07_05/index.html |date=13 September 2005 }} 13 February to 19 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific H5N1 isolates labeled as Fujian include A/Fujian/1/2005 and A/DK/Fujian/1734/05 (or A/Ck/Fujian/1734/2005).&lt;ref&gt;[https://depts.washington.edu/einet/doclib/china.ppt washington.edu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216095654/https://depts.washington.edu/einet/doclib/china.ppt |date=16 February 2007 }} Ministry of Health, P.R.China 2006-1-20&lt;/ref&gt;

A/Fujian (H5N1) bird flu is notable for its resistance to standard medical countermeasures, its rapid spread, what it tells us about the continuing evolution of the [[H5N1]] virus, and the political controversy surrounding it. [[CIDRAP]] says "A new subtype of H5N1 avian influenza virus has become predominant in southern China over the past year, possibly through its resistance to vaccines used in poultry, and has been found in human H5N1 cases in China, according to researchers from Hong Kong and the United States. The rise of the Fujian-like strain seems to be the cause of increased poultry outbreaks and recent human cases in China, according to the team from the University of Hong Kong and St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis. The researchers also found an overall increase of H5N1 infection in live-poultry markets in southern China."&lt;ref name=PNAS_Fujian&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0608157103v1 National Academy of Sciences] article ''Emergence and predominance of an H5N1 influenza variant in China'' published online before print 30 October 2006, 10.1073/pnas.0608157103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CIDRAP_Fujian&gt;[http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/news/nov0306China.html CIDRAP] article ''Study says new H5N1 strain pervades southern China'' published 3 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CIDRAP_China_denial&gt;[http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/news/nov1006china.html CIDRAP] article ''Chinese promise H5N1 samples, deny claim of new strain'' published 10 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters_Fujian_denial&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/PEK307520.htm Reuters] article ''China scientists call bird flu paper "unscientific"'' published 7 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PDF_HK&gt;[http://www.hkam.org.hk/publications/hkmj/article_pdfs/hkm0506p189.pdf hkam.org.hk PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PDF_WHO&gt;[http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/guidelines/recommendationvaccine.pdf WHO PDF] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824004040/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/guidelines/recommendationvaccine.pdf |date=24 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resistance to countermeasures===
According to the New York Times: "[P]oultry vaccines, made on the cheap, are not filtered and purified [like human vaccines] to remove bits of bacteria or other viruses. They usually contain whole virus, not just the hemagglutinin spike that attaches to cells. Purification is far more expensive than the work in eggs, Dr. Stöhr said; a modest factory for human vaccine costs $100 million, and no veterinary manufacturer is ready to build one. Also, poultry vaccines are "adjuvated" — boosted — with mineral oil, which induces a strong immune reaction but can cause inflammation and abscesses. Chicken vaccinators who have accidentally jabbed themselves have developed painful swollen fingers or even lost thumbs, doctors said. Effectiveness may also be limited. Chicken vaccines are often only vaguely similar to circulating flu strains — some contain an [[H5N2]] strain isolated in Mexico years ago. 'With a chicken, if you use a vaccine that's only 85 percent related, you'll get protection,' Dr. Cardona said. 'In humans, you can get a single point mutation, and a vaccine that's 99.99 percent related won't protect you.' And they are weaker [than human vaccines]. 'Chickens are smaller and you only need to protect them for six weeks, because that's how long they live till you eat them,' said Dr. John J. Treanor, a vaccine expert at the University of Rochester. Human seasonal flu vaccines contain about 45 micrograms of antigen, while an experimental A([[H5N1]]) vaccine contains 180. Chicken vaccines may contain less than 1 microgram. 'You have to be careful about extrapolating data from poultry to humans,' warned Dr. David E. Swayne, director of the agriculture department's Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory. 'Birds are more closely related to [[dinosaur]]s.'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/02/science/02chic.html New York Times] article ''Turning to Chickens in Fight With Bird Flu'' published 2 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers, led by Nicholas Savill of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, used mathematical models to simulate the spread of [[H5N1]] and concluded that "at least 95 per cent of birds need to be protected to prevent the virus spreading silently. In practice, it is difficult to protect more than 90 per cent of a flock; protection levels achieved by a vaccine are usually much lower than this."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scidev.net/gateways/index.cfm?fuseaction=readitem&amp;rgwid=4&amp;item=News&amp;itemid=3051&amp;language=1 SciDev.Net] article ''Bird flu warning over partial protection of flocks'' published 16 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to the Fujian-like strain, an October 2006 National Academy of Sciences article reports: "The development of highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza viruses in poultry in Eurasia accompanied with the increase in human infection in 2006 suggests that the virus has not been effectively contained and that the pandemic threat persists. [...] Serological studies suggest that H5N1 seroconversion in market poultry is low and that vaccination may have facilitated the selection of the Fujian-like sublineage. The predominance of this virus over a large geographical region within a short period directly challenges current disease control measures."&lt;ref name=PNAS_Fujian/&gt; The research team tested more than 53,000 birds in southern China from July 2005 through June 2006. 2.4% of the birds had H5N1, more than double the previous 0.9% rate. 68% them were in the new Fujian-like lineage. First detected in March 2005, it constituted 103 of 108 bird hosted isolates tested from April through June 2006, five Chinese human hosted isolates, 16 from Hong Kong birds, and two from Laos and Malaysia birds. Chickens in southern China were found to be poorly immunized against Fujian-like viruses in comparison with other sublineages. "All the analyzed Fujian-like viruses had molecular characteristics that indicated sensitivity to oseltamivir, the first-choice antiviral drug for H5N1 infection. In addition, only six of the viruses had a mutation that confers resistance to amantadine, an older antiviral drug used to treat flu."&lt;ref name=CIDRAP_Fujian/&gt;

===Rapid spread===
"China's official Xinhua news agency says a new bird flu outbreak has killed more than 3,000 chickens in the northwest. The Ministry of Agriculture told Xinhua that the July&amp;nbsp;14 outbreak in Xinjiang region's Aksu city is under control.  No human infections have been reported. Saturday's report says the deadly H5N1 virus killed 3,045 chickens, and nearly 357,000 more were destroyed in an emergency response. Xinhua says the local agriculture department has quarantined the infected area. The government's last reported outbreak was in the northwestern region of Ningxia earlier this month."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The October 2006 National Academy of Sciences article also says: "Updated virological and epidemiological findings from our market surveillance in southern China demonstrate that H5N1 influenza viruses continued to be panzootic in different types of poultry. Genetic and antigenic analyses revealed the emergence and predominance of a previously uncharacterized H5N1 virus sublineage (Fujian-like) in poultry since late 2005. Viruses from this sublineage gradually replaced those multiple regional distinct sublineages and caused recent human infection in China. These viruses have already transmitted to Hong Kong, Laos, Malaysia, and Thailand, resulting in a new transmission and outbreak wave in Southeast Asia."&lt;ref name=PNAS_Fujian/&gt;

===H5N1 evolution===
The first known strain of HPAI A(H5N1) (called A/chicken/Scotland/59) killed two flocks of chickens in Scotland in 1959; but that strain was very different from the current highly pathogenic strain of H5N1. The dominant strain of HPAI A(H5N1) in 2004 [[Evolution|evolved]] from 1999 to 2002 creating the Z genotype.&lt;ref name=Harder&gt;{{cite book

H5N1 is an [[Influenza A virus]] subtype. Experts believe it might mutate into a form that transmits easily from person to person. If such a mutation occurs, it might remain an H5N1 subtype or could shift subtypes as did [[H2N2]] when it evolved into the [[Hong Kong Flu]] strain of [[H3N2]].

In July 2004, researchers led by H. Deng of the [[Harbin Veterinary Research Institute]], [[Harbin]], China and Professor [[Robert G. Webster]] of the [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]], [[Memphis, Tennessee]], reported results of experiments in which [[Mouse|mice]] had been exposed to 21 isolates of confirmed H5N1 strains obtained from ducks in China between 1999 and 2002. They found "a clear temporal pattern of progressively increasing pathogenicity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0403212101v1 The evolution of H5N1 influenza viruses in ducks in southern China] by H.

Asian lineage HPAI A(H5N1) is divided into two [[antigen]]ic clades. "Clade 1 includes human and bird isolates from [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], and [[Cambodia]] and bird isolates from [[Laos]] and [[Malaysia]]. Clade 2 viruses were first identified in bird isolates from China, [[Indonesia]], [[Japan]], and [[South Korea]] before spreading westward to the [[Middle East]], [[Europe]], and [[Africa]]. The clade 2 viruses have been primarily responsible for human H5N1 infections that have occurred during late 2005 and 2006, according to WHO. Genetic analysis has identified six subclades of clade 2, three of which have a distinct geographic distribution and have been implicated in human infections:
* Subclade 1, Indonesia
* Subclade 2, Middle East, Europe, and Africa
* Subclade 3, China"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 18 August 2006, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) changed the H5N1 avian influenza strains recommended for candidate vaccines for the first time since 2004. "Many experts who follow the ongoing analysis of the H5N1 virus sequences are alarmed at how fast the virus is evolving into an increasingly more complex network of clades and subclades, Osterholm said. The evolving nature of the virus complicates vaccine planning. He said if an avian influenza pandemic emerges, a strain-specific vaccine will need to be developed to treat the disease. Recognition of the three new subclades means researchers face increasingly complex options about which path to take to stay ahead of the virus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] article ''H5N1 Outbreaks and Enzootic Influenza'' by [[Robert G. Webster]] et al.:"Transmission of highly pathogenic H5N1 from domestic poultry back to migratory waterfowl in western China has increased the geographic spread. The spread of H5N1 and its likely reintroduction to domestic poultry increase the need for good agricultural vaccines. In fact, the root cause of the continuing H5N1 pandemic threat may be the way the pathogenicity of H5N1 viruses is masked by cocirculating influenza viruses or bad agricultural vaccines."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no01/05-1024.htm CDC] ''H5N1 Outbreaks and Enzootic Influenza'' by Robert G. Webster et al.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Robert Webster explains: "If you use a good vaccine you can prevent the transmission within poultry and to humans. But if they have been using vaccines now [in China] for several years, why is there so much bird flu? There is bad vaccine that stops the disease in the bird but the bird goes on pooping out virus and maintaining it and changing it. And I think this is what is going on in China. It has to be. Either there is not enough vaccine being used or there is substandard vaccine being used. Probably both. It’s not just China. We can’t blame China for substandard vaccines. I think there are substandard vaccines for influenza in poultry all over the world." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10639567/ MSNBC quoting Reuters quoting Robert G. Webster]&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the same concerns, Reuters reports Hong Kong infectious disease expert Lo Wing-lok saying, "The issue of vaccines has to take top priority," and Julie Hall, in charge of the WHO's outbreak response in China, saying "China's vaccinations might be masking the virus." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/HKG28205.htm Reuters]&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC reported that Dr Wendy Barclay, a virologist at the University of Reading, UK said: "The Chinese have made a vaccine based on reverse genetics made with H5N1 antigens, and they have been using it. There has been a lot of criticism of what they have done, because they have protected their chickens against death from this virus but the chickens still get infected; and then you get drift - the virus mutates in response to the antibodies - and now we have a situation where we have five or six 'flavours' of H5N1 out there." &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4737276.stm BBC] ''Bird flu vaccine no silver bullet'' 22 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006, China and WHO traded accusations over the Fujian-like strain. Chinese authorities rejected the Fujian-like strain interpretation altogether saying "Gene sequence analysis shows that all the variants of the virus found in southern China share high uniformity, meaning they all belong to the same gene type. No distinctive change was found in their biological characteristics." While  a World Health Organization official in China renewed previous complaints that the Chinese have been stingy with information about H5N1 in poultry saying "There's a stark contrast between what we're hearing from the researchers and what the Ministry of Agriculture says. Unless the ministry tells us what's going on and shares viruses on a regular basis, we will be doing diagnostics on strains that are old."&lt;ref name=CIDRAP_Fujian/&gt;

In November 2006, China and WHO traded favors over their [[H5N1]] disagreements with a face-saving WHO apology and China promising to share more avian influenza virus samples.&lt;ref name=CIDRAP_China_denial/&gt; Also in November, [[Margaret Chan]], a former top government health official for Hong Kong, was made Director-General elect of the WHO. The Chinese government said they "would fully support her work in the WHO so that she could wholeheartedly carry out her responsibility and serve the health cause of the world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-11/10/content_5319744.htm news.xinhuanet] article ''Chinese minister refutes reports on new H5N1 strain'' published 10 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, Chinese authorities agreed that Fujian flu exists; but said that "[[Anhui]]" should replace the word "[[Fujian]]" in its name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/topics/news/agriculture/story.html?id=7b39c3d9-b4c4-4a16-989b-af2e0cb4fdd0&amp;k=10533 Canada News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212210310/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/agriculture/story.html?id=7b39c3d9-b4c4-4a16-989b-af2e0cb4fdd0&amp;k=10533 |date=12 February 2012 }} article ''UN agencies, China agree bird flu variant not new; urge greater surveillance'' published 8 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Other names it has been called include "waterfowl clade" and "clade 2.3".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/news/dec1106fujian.html CIDRAP] article ''Agencies to seek accord on naming of H5N1 strains'' published 11 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; (Or more specifically, "Clade 2.3.4"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abkhazia.com/content/view/660/67/ Abkhazia Institute for Social and Economic Research] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927104336/http://www.abkhazia.com/content/view/660/67/ |date=27 September 2007 }} article ''Towards a unified nomenclature system for the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses'' by Ramaz Mitaishvili published 14 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;)

China provided 20 H5N1 samples from birds in late 2006 gleaned from birds a year earlier and in 2006 shared a significant amount of H5N1 information generated by its labs. On 31 May 2007, for the first time is almost a year, China shared H5N1 avian flu virus samples taken from humans with [[WHO]]. The samples were taken from two people and arrived at a World Health Organization (WHO) laboratory in the United States that is part of CDC. A WHO official said that these are two of the three samples promised to WHO and have been sent by China's health ministry. The specimens are from a 2006 case from [[Xinjiang]] province in far western China and a 2007 case from [[Fujian]] province in the south. The third promised but not yet delivered sample is from a 24-year-old soldier who died in 2003. China previously sent six human H5N1 virus samples to WHO laboratories: two in December 2005 and four in May 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?alias=china-shares-bird-flu-sam&amp;chanID=sa003&amp;modsrc=reuters Scientific American] article ''China shares bird flu sample, first time in year: WHO'' published 1 June 2007 [http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/panflu/news/may2507samples.html CIDRAP] article ''China resumes sending human H5N1 samples'' published 25 May 2007 [http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/news/apr1607china.html CIDRAP] article ''China said to be withholding H5N1 virus samples'' published 16 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, at the age of 12, he was the chess champion of his town of [[Olmaliq|Almalyk]] (Olmaliq) in the province of Tashkent of central [[Uzbekistan]].

In 1971, he took 2nd place in the USSR Junior Chess Championship, held in [[Riga]].

In 1973, he played in his first [[Uzbekistani Chess Championship|Uzbekistani chess championship]].  He won the event in 1976 and 1981.

He was the first Grandmaster from [[Uzbekistan]] in 1984.

He was a [[philologist]].

Best results include first place at [[Belgrade]] 1982; 1st at [[Vršac]] 1983; 1st at [[Sochi]] 1984; 1st at [[Tashkent]] 1984; 1st at [[Bogotá]] 1984; 2nd at [[Potsdam]] 1985; 1st at [[Calcutta]] 1986.

In 1986, after finishing a chess tournament in Sevastopol in the [[Crimea]], he was accidentally killed when he went hiking and fell off a cliff and became trapped between two rocks.  Passers by heard his cries for help, but he was too deep down, and by the time rescue crews got to him, it was too late.

His highest [[Elo rating system|Elo]] chess rating was 2590 on the January 1, 1985 [[FIDE]] rating list.

Since 2007, an annual open chess tournament has been held in Tashkent in his memory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3797 In Memoriam – Georgy Agzamov] ChessBase.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chessbase/&gt;

The 2012 Zimbabwe Demographic And Health Survey (ZDHS) estimated national HIV prevalence rates at 15%, meaning that they estimated 12% infection rate for men, and 18% for women.&lt;ref&gt;10-11 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey 2012 http://www.zimstat.co.zw/dmdocuments/Census/ZDHS2011/HIV.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; However, these numbers are based on data from pregnant women at antenatal clinics, which are notoriously unreliable in estimating national HIV prevalence rates, because the subset of the population used, pregnant women, are not statistically representative of the general population. No follow up testing is done if more than 10% of samples show a positive result after the initial test. As a result, false positives are not eliminated from the survey results.{{cn|date=August 2015}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Response rates and methodology: HIV prevalence data were obtained from testing dried blood spot (DBS) samples voluntarily provided by women age 15–49 and men age 15–54 who were interviewed in the 2010- 11 ZDHS. The DBS were collected using the finger stick method. Of the 18,554 eligible respondents, 75% were both interviewed and provided DBS specimens. Coverage rates were higher in rural areas (83%) than in urban areas (63%).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Recent estimates from the Joint United Nations Programme on [[HIV/AIDS]] ([[UNAIDS]]) indicate that approximately 1.6 million adults 15 years and older were living with HIV/AIDS in 2005. Despite the severity of the epidemic, prevalence rates in [[Zimbabwe]] have begun to show signs of decline, from 22.1 percent prevalence among adults ages 15 to 19 in 2003 to 20.1 percent prevalence in the same age group in 2005. [[Peter Piot|Dr. Peter Piot]], head of UNAIDS, said that in Zimbabwe, "The declines in HIV rates have been due to changes in behaviour, including increased use of condoms, people delaying the first time they have sexual intercourse, and people having fewer sexual partners."&lt;ref name=us/&gt;

To justify these numbers, it is hypothesized that Zimbabwe would have to have a generalized HIV/AIDS epidemic with HIV transmitted primarily through heterosexual contact, meaning that HIV spreads as easily from women to men as from men to women, and mother-to-child transmission. However, there is no actual evidence that this is the case, in Zimbabwe, Africa or anywhere else in the world. 

High risk groups, including migrant laborers, people in prostitution, girls involved in intergenerational sexual relationships, discordant couples, and members of the uniformed services warrant special attention in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Young adults and women are hardest hit by the epidemic. In 2005, approximately 930,000 women over the age of 14 were estimated to be living with HIV/AIDS in Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name=us/&gt;

Zimbabwe continues to suffer a severe socioeconomic and political crisis, including unprecedented rates of inflation and a severe '[[brain drain]]' of Zimbabwe's health care professionals. Elements of a previously well-maintained health care infrastructure are crumbling. Zimbabwe's HIV crisis is exacerbated by chronic food insecurity. Sub-optimal nutrition increases the vulnerability of individuals with compromised immune systems to life-threatening opportunistic infections, such as [[tuberculosis]]. Gender inequality and widespread practices of multiple and concurrent sexual relationships, and cross-generational sex fuel Zimbabwe's epidemic, particularly among youth. Social norms, including stigma associated with HIV/AIDS, excessive alcohol consumption, and a reluctance to talk about HIV status or sexual relations also create barriers to behavior change.&lt;ref name=us&gt;[http://www.pepfar.gov/press/countries/profiles/116349.htm "2008 Country Profile: Zimbabwe"]. [[U.S. Department of State]] (2008). Accessed March 28, 2010. {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the tide in the epidemic is now being reversed as more and more people are now accessing ARVs.

The [[AIDS]] epidemic, caused by [[HIV]] (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), found its way to the [[United States]] as early as 1960, but was first noticed after doctors discovered clusters of [[Kaposi's sarcoma]] and [[pneumocystis pneumonia]] in young gay men in Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco in 1981. Treatment of HIV/AIDS is primarily via a "drug cocktail" of [[Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitors]], and education programs to help people avoid infection.

Initially, infected foreign nationals were turned back at the U.S. border to help prevent additional infections. The number of U.S. deaths from AIDS have declined sharply since the early years of the disease's presentation domestically. In the United States, 1.2 million people live with an HIV infection, of whom 15% are unaware of their infection.&lt;ref name="cdcataglance"&gt;{{cite web | title=HIV in the United States: ''At A Glance'' | website=CDC | date=29 November 2017 | url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/statistics/overview/ataglance.html | access-date=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gay and bisexual men, [[African Americans]], and [[Latinos]] remain disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS in the U.S.

== Mortality and morbidity ==

{{As of|2016}}, about 675,000 people have died of HIV/AIDS in the U.S. since the beginning of the HIV epidemic.&lt;ref name=CDC2016Today&gt;{{cite web|title=Today’s HIV/AIDS Epidemic Factsheet|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/docs/factsheets/todaysepidemic-508.pdf|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=U.S. government|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With improved treatments and better [[Post-exposure prophylaxis|prophylaxis]] against opportunistic infections, [[mortality rate|death rates]] have significantly declined.&lt;ref name="SFDPH HIV Epi Report 2008"&gt;{{Cite web

Great progress was made in the U.S. following the introduction of three-drug anti-HIV treatments ("cocktails") that included [[protease inhibitors]]. [[David Ho (scientist)|David Ho]], a pioneer of this approach, was honored as ''[[Time Magazine]]'' Man of the Year for 1996. Deaths were rapidly reduced by more than half, with a small but welcome reduction in the yearly rate of new HIV infections. Since this time, AIDS deaths have continued to decline, but much more slowly, and not as completely in black Americans as in other population segments.&lt;ref name="Left Behind Black America"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Wilson |first=Phill |last2=Wright |first2=Kai |last3=Isbell |first3=Michael T. |title=Left Behind: Black America: a Neglected Priority in the Global AIDS Epidemic |publisher=Black AIDS Institute |date=August 2008 |url=http://www.blackaids.org/image_uploads/article_575/08_left_behind.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=March 20, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821072159/http://www.blackaids.org/image_uploads/article_575/08_left_behind.pdf |archivedate=August 21, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYC DPH AIDS Mortality Historic Low 2002"&gt;{{Cite press release

=== Travel restrictions ===
The second prong of the American approach to containment has been to maintain strict entry controls to the country for people with HIV or AIDS. Under legislation enacted by the [[United States Congress]] in 1993, patients found importing anti-HIV medication into the country were arrested and placed on flights back to their country of origin.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Some HIV-positive travellers took to sending anti-HIV medication through the post to friends or contacts in advocacy groups in advance. This meant that the traveller would not be discovered with any medication. However, the security clampdown following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 meant this was no longer an option.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The only legal alternative to this{{Clarify|date=March 2016}} was to apply for a special [[Visa (document)|visa]] beforehand, which entailed an interview at an American Embassy, confiscation of the passport during the lengthy application process, and then, if permission were granted, a permanent attachment being made to the applicant's passport.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

This process was condemned as intrusive and invasive by a number of advocacy groups, on the grounds that any time the passport was later used for travel elsewhere or for identification purposes, the holder's HIV status would become known. It was also felt that this rule was unfair because it applied even if the traveller was covered for HIV-related conditions under their own travel [[insurance]].

In early December 2006, President [[George W. Bush]] indicated that he would issue an executive order allowing HIV-positive people to enter the [[United States]] on standard visas. It was unclear whether applicants would still have to declare their HIV status.&lt;ref name="Russell2006"&gt;{{Cite news

  | accessdate = March 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ban remained in effect throughout Bush's Presidency. In August 2007, Congressperson [[Barbara Lee]] of California introduced {{USBill|110|h|3337}}, the HIV Nondiscrimination in Travel and Immigration Act of 2007. This bill would have allowed travelers and immigrants entry to the United States without having to disclose their HIV status. The bill died at the end of the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]].&lt;ref name="BBC2009"&gt;{{cite web | title=Activist helps US HIV law change | website=BBC NEWS | date=6 July 2009 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8136456.stm | access-date=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, then President George W. Bush signed {{USBill|110|h|5501}} that lifted the ban in statutory law. However, the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] still held the ban in administrative (written regulation) law. New impetus was added to repeal efforts when Paul Thorn, a UK tuberculosis expert who was invited to speak at the 2009 [[Pacific Health Summit]] in Seattle, was denied a visa due to his HIV positive status. A letter written by Mr. Thorn, and read in his place at the Summit, was attained by Congressman [[Jim McDermott]], who advocated the issue to the Obama administration's Health Secretary.&lt;ref name="BBC2009"/&gt;

On October 30, 2009 President [[Barack Obama]] reauthorized the [[Ryan White]] HIV/AIDS Bill which expanded care and treatment through federal funding to nearly half a million.&lt;ref name="obamawh"&gt;{{Cite web

One of the best known works on the history of HIV is 1987's book ''[[And the Band Played On]]'', by [[Randy Shilts]]. Shilts contends that [[Ronald Reagan]]'s administration dragged its feet in dealing with the crisis due to homophobia, while the gay community viewed early reports and public health measures with corresponding distrust, thus allowing the disease to infect hundreds of thousands more. This resulted in the formation of ACT-UP, the [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power]] by [[Larry Kramer]]. Galvanized by the federal government's inactivity, the movement by AIDS activists to gain funding for AIDS research, which on a per-patient basis out-paced funding for more prevalent diseases such as cancer and heart disease, was used as a model for future lobbying for health research funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The Shilts work popularized the [[HIV and AIDS misconceptions|misconception]] that the disease was introduced by a gay [[flight attendant]] named [[Gaëtan Dugas]], referred to as "[[Index case|Patient Zero]]," although the author did not actually make this claim in the book. However, subsequent research has revealed that there were cases of AIDS much earlier than initially known. HIV-infected blood samples have been found from as early as 1959 in Africa ''(see [[HIV]] main entry)'', and HIV has been shown to have caused the death of [[Robert Rayford]], a 16-year-old St. Louis male, in 1969, who could have contracted it as early as 7 years old due to sexual abuse, suggesting that HIV had been present, at very low prevalence, in the U.S. since before the 1970s.

An early theory asserted that a series of [[inoculation]]s against [[hepatitis B]] that were performed in the gay community of [[San Francisco]] were tainted with HIV. Although there was a high correlation between recipients of that [[vaccination]] and initial cases of AIDS, this theory has long been discredited. HIV, [[hepatitis B]], and [[hepatitis C]] are bloodborne diseases with very similar modes of transmission, and those at risk for one are at risk for the others.&lt;ref name="NIOSH Bloodborne"&gt;{{Cite web

Activists and critics of current AIDS policies allege that another preventable impediment to stemming the spread of the disease and/or finding a treatment was the vanity of "celebrity" scientists. [[Robert Gallo]], an American scientist involved in the search for a new [[virus]] in the people affected by the disease, became embroiled in a legal battle with French scientist [[Luc Montagnier]], who had first discovered such a virus in tissue cultures derived from a patient suffering from enlargement of the lymphnodes (an early sign of AIDS). Montagnier had named the new virus LAV (Lymphoadenopathy-Associated Virus).

Gallo, who appeared to question the primacy of the French scientist's discovery, refused to recognize the "French virus" as the cause of AIDS, and tried instead to claim the disease was caused by a new member of a retrovirus family, [[HTLV]], which he had discovered. Critics claim that because some scientists were more interested in trying to win a Nobel prize than in helping patients, research progress was delayed and more people needlessly died. After a number of meetings and high-level political intervention, the French scientists and Gallo agreed to "share" the discovery of HIV, although eventually Montagnier and his group were recognized as the true discoverers, and won the 2008 Nobel Prize for it.

Publicity campaigns were started in attempts to counter the incorrect and often vitriolic perception of AIDS as a "gay plague". These included the [[Ryan White]] case, red ribbon campaigns, celebrity dinners, the [[And the Band Played On (film)|1993 film version]] of ''And the Band Played On'', [[AIDS education|sex education programs]] in schools, and [[Public service announcement|television advertisements]]. Announcements by various celebrities that they had contracted HIV (including actor [[Rock Hudson]], basketball star [[Magic Johnson]], tennis player [[Arthur Ashe]] and singer [[Freddie Mercury]]) were significant in arousing media attention and making the general public aware of the dangers of the disease to people of all sexual orientations.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

== By race/ethnicity ==
'''Blacks/African Americans''' continue to experience the most severe burden of HIV, compared with other races and ethnicities. Black people represent approximately 12% of the U.S. population, but accounted for an estimated 44% of new HIV infections in 2010. Even more daunting is that they make up nearly 52% of AIDS-related deaths in America. While the overall rates of HIV incidences and prevalence have decreased, they have increased in one particular demographic: African American gay and bisexual men (a 4% increase). While the factors above contribute to overall inability to generate a suppressed viral load, socioeconomic status and institutionalized discrimination in the healthcare setting plays a big role in determining one's ability to live with HIV. In America, black households were reported to have the lowest median income, leading to lower rates of insured individuals. This creates cost barriers to antiretroviral treatments. Moreover, African American HIV positive individuals were less likely to be prescribed antiretroviral treatments and less likely to be referred to HIV treatment centers. A number of other systematic factors contribute to this disparity, including cultural stigma, lack of education in affected communities, and lack of awareness.

'''Hispanics/Latinos''' are also disproportionately affected by HIV. Hispanics/Latinos represented 16% of the population but accounted for 21% of new HIV infections in 2010. Hispanics/Latinos accounted for 20% of people living with HIV infection in 2011. Disparities persist in the estimated rate of new HIV infections in Hispanics/Latinos. In 2010, the rate of new HIV infections for Latino males was 2.9 times that for white males, and the rate of new infections for Latinas was 4.2 times that for white females. Since the epidemic began, more than 100,888 Hispanics/Latinos with an AIDS diagnosis have died, including 2,155 in 2012.&lt;ref name="cdcataglance" /&gt;

According to a study published in the [[Journal of Bisexuality]], "[t]he Down Low is a lifestyle predominately practiced by young, urban Black men who have sex with other men and women, yet do not identify as gay or bisexual".&lt;ref name="Attitudes Towards"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heath |first=Jessie |author2=Kathy Goggin |title=Attitudes Towards Male Homosexuality, Bisexuality, and the Down Low Lifestyle: Demographic Differences and HIV Implications |journal=Journal of Bisexuality |doi=10.1080/15299710802659997 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=17–31 |date=January 2009 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a909249896&amp;db=all |accessdate=2009-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context, "being on the Down Low" is more than just men having sex with men in secret, or a variant of [[closeted]] homosexuality or bisexuality—it is a sexual identity that is, at least partly, defined by its "cult of masculinity" and its rejection of what is perceived as [[white people|White]] culture (including white [[LGBT]] culture) and terms.&lt;ref name="Secret Gay" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Double Lives"&gt;{{cite news |last= Denizet-Lewis |first= Benoit |title=Double Lives On The Down Low |publisher=The New York Times |date=August 3, 2003 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/03/magazine/double-lives-on-the-down-low.html |accessdate=2012-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Down-Low Debate"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wright |first=Kaimeans |title=The Great Down-Low Debate: A New Black Sexual Identity May Be an Incubator for AIDS |publisher=The Village Voice |date=June 5, 2001 |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2001-06-05/news/the-great-down-low-debate/1 |accessdate=2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sex, lies"&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |title=Sex, lies and the "down low" |publisher=Salon.com |date=August 16, 2004 |url=http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2004/08/16/down_low/index.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080307114914/http://dir.salon.com/story/mwt/feature/2004/08/16/down_low/index.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 7, 2008 |accessdate=2009-12-18 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'' cover story on the Down Low phenomenon explains that the Black community sees ''"homosexuality as a White man's perversion."''&lt;ref name="Double Lives" /&gt;

The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] cited three findings that relate to African-American men who operate on the down-low (engage in MSM activity but don't disclose to others):

* African American men who have sex with men (MSM), but who do not disclose their sexual orientation (nondisclosers), have a high prevalence of HIV infection (14%); nearly three times higher than nondisclosing MSMs of all other races/ethnicities combined (5%).
* Confirming previous research, the study of 5,589 MSM, aged 15–29 years, in six U.S. cities found that African American MSM were more likely not to disclose their sexual orientation compared with White MSM (18% vs. 8%).
* HIV-infected nondisclosers were less likely to know their HIV status (98% were unaware of their infection compared with 75% of HIV-positive disclosers), and more likely to have had recent female sex partners.&lt;ref name="MMWR"&gt;{{cite journal |title=CDC: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report |publisher=CDC: US Center for Disease Control and Prevention |date=February 7, 2003 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/media/mmwrnews/n030207.htm#mmwr1 |accessdate=2009-10-31 |journal= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005104759/http://cdc.gov/media/mmwrnews/n030207.htm#mmwr1 |archive-date=October 5, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Risk Factors contributing to the Black HIV rate ===
{{Original research section|date=May 2018}}

Accessibility to healthcare is very important in preventing and treating HIV/AIDs. It can be affected by health insurance which is available to people through private insurers, Medicare and Medicaid which leaves some people still vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/nytimes/docview/432834936/39975EAC698041FFPQ/3?accountid=14899|title=Log In - New York Times - ProQuest|language=en|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, African Americans have faced discrimination when it comes to receiving healthcare. During the time of slavery, slave owners would get medical attention for slaves because they were deemed as property, while slaves that the slave owners believed were not able to recover were sent to be experimented on. In the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century, universities dug up African American bodies to autopsy, and some night doctors would snatch people off the streets to examine. African Americans have been experimented on and exploited for centuries. The Tuskegee Syphilis study experimented vulnerable men in the South who had syphilis. They kept treatment from these men to see what would happen. Henrietta Lacks was also exploited when researchers took her cancerous cells and grew them to experiment on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black Man in a White Coat|last=Tweedy|first=Damon|publisher=Picador|year=2015|isbn=|location=New York|pages=153–178.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homosexuality is viewed negatively in the African American Community. "In a qualitative study of 745 racially and ethnic diverse undergraduates attending a large Midwestern university, Calzo and Ward (2009) determined that parents of African-American participants discussed homosexuality more frequently than the parents of other respondents. In analyses of the values communicated, Calzo and Ward (2009) reported that Black parents offered greater indication that homosexuality is perverse and unnatural".&lt;ref name="Hill 2013 475–487"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=William Allen|last2=McNeely|first2=Clea|date=2013|title=HIV/AIDS Disparity between African-American and Caucasian Men Who Have Sex with Men: Intervention Strategies for the Black Church|jstor=24484999|journal=Journal of Religion and Health|volume=52|issue=2|pages=475–487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homosexuality is seen as a threat to the African American empowerment. Masculinity is seen as important for the African American community because it shows that the community is in control of their own destiny. Since the stigma circling homosexuality is that it is “feminite”, then homosexuality is seen as a threat to masculinity. “Black manhood, then, depends on men's ability to be provider, progenitor, and protector. But, as the Black male performance of parts of this script is thwarted by racism and capitalist patriarchy, the performance of Black masculinity becomes predicated on a particular performance of Black sexuality and avoidance of weakness and femininity. If sexuality remains one of the few ways that Black men can recapture a masculinity withheld from them in the marketplace, endorsing Black homosexuality subverts the cultural project of reinscribing masculinity within the Black community." This critical view is influenced by Internalized homophobia. “Internalized homophobia is defined as the lesbian, gay, or bisexual individual's inward direction of society's homophobic attitudes (Meyer 1995)."&lt;ref name="Hill 2013 475–487"/&gt;

The African American community's social norms regarding homosexuality have influenced a higher percentage of African Americans with internalized homophobia. This homophobic culture is sustained within the African American community through the church because religion is a vital part of the African American community: "As reported by Peterson and Jones (2009), AA MSM tended to be more involved with religious communities than NHW MSM." Because the church reiterates this stigma of homosexuality, the African American community has higher rates of internalized homophobia. This internalized homophobia causes a lower chance of HIV/AIDS education on prevention and care within the African American community.&lt;ref name="Hill 2013 475–487"/&gt;

Sex education varies throughout the United States and in some areas could use more informative measures. African-Americans and Hispanic/ Latinos experience higher rates of lower socioeconomic statuses and fewer opportunities than white people. This causes limited access to (higher) education in lower socioeconomic areas. Sex education on HIV prevention has decreased from 64% (2000) to 41% (2014). Out of the 50 states, 26 put a larger emphasis on abstinence sex education. Abstinence only sex education is correlated to increasing rates of HIV especially in teenagers and young adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/western-central-europe-north-america/usa|title=HIV and AIDS in the United States of America (USA)|date=2015-07-21|work=AVERT|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With mass incarceration of the African American community, HIV has been spreading rapidly throughout jails and prisons. “Among jail populations, African American men are 5 times as likely as white men, and twice as likely as Hispanic/Latino men, to be diagnosed with HIV.” Since most people contract HIV before being incarcerated, it is hard to know who has the disease and to keep it from spreading. A lack of hygiene in prisons perpetuates these problems. Many inmates do not disclose their high-risk behaviors, such as anal sex or injection drug use, because they fear being stigmatized and ostracized by other inmates.There is also a lack of educational programs on disease prevention for inmates. Because “nine out of ten jail inmates are released in under 72 hours which makes it hard to test them for HIV and help them find treatment,” the problem persists outside of prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/correctional.html|title=HIV Among Incarcerated Populations {{!}} HIV by Group {{!}} HIV/AIDS {{!}} CDC|date=2018-02-12|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism and response ==
Starting in the early 1980s, AIDS activist groups and organizations began to emerge and advocate for people infected with HIV in the United States. Though it was an important aspect of the movement, activism went beyond the pursuit of funding for AIDS research. Groups acted to educate and raise awareness of the disease and its effects on different populations, even those thought to be at low-risk of contracting HIV. This was done through publications and “alternative media” created by those living with or close to the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=AIDS TV: Identity, Community, and Alternative Video|last=Juhasz|first=Alexandra|publisher=Duke University Press|year=1995|isbn=0-8223-1695-1|location=Durham, North Carolina|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activist groups worked to prevent spread of HIV by distributing information about safe sex. They also existed to support people living with HIV/AIDS, offering therapy, support groups, and hospice care.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reproductive Justice: An Introduction|last=Ross|first=Loretta|publisher=University of California Press|year=2017|isbn=978-0-520-28820-1|location=Oakland, California|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations like [[Gay Men's Health Crisis|Gay Men's Health Crisis]], the Lesbian AIDS Project, and SisterLove were created to address the needs of certain populations living with HIV/AIDS. Other groups, like the [[NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt|NAMES Project]], emerged as a way of memorializing those who had passed, refusing to let them be forgotten by the historical narrative. One group, the Association for Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT), headed by [[Yolanda Serrano]], corridinated with their local prison, [[Rikers Island Correctional Facility|Riker's Island Correctional Facility]], to advocate for those imprisoned and AIDS positive to be released early, so that they could pass away in the comfort of their own homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-UCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=yolanda+serrano+and+adapt&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ce8l_7U1Ie&amp;sig=C26IxKZA0yzGwldJu7YSGCURHqQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj_qZuQ053eAhXpRd8KHTaeCC8Q6AEwAXoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=yolanda%20serrano%20and%20adapt&amp;f=false|title=ADAPT and Survive|last=Carter|first=Zoe|date=1988-05-09|publisher=New York Magazine|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both men and women, heterosexual and queer populations were active in establishing and maintaining these parts of the movement. Because AIDS was initially thought only to impact gay men, most narratives of activism focus on their contributions to the movement. However, women also played a significant role in raising awareness, rallying for change, and caring for those impacted by the disease. Lesbians helped organize and spread information about transmission between women, as well as supporting gay men in their work. Narratives of activism also tend to focus on organizing done in coastal cities, but AIDS activism was present and widespread across both urban and more rural areas of the United States. Organizers sought to address needs specific to their communities, whether that was working to establish [[Needle exchange programme|needle exchange programs]], fighting against housing or employment discrimination, or issues faced primarily by people identified as members of specific groups (such as sex workers, mothers and children, or incarcerated people).

=== Present day activism ===
An effective response to HIV/AIDS requires that groups of vulnerable populations have access to HIV prevention programs with information and services that are specific to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-social-issues/key-affected-populations|title=Key Affected Populations, HIV and AIDS|last=|first=|date=|website=Avert: Global Information and Education on HIV and AIDS|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the present day, some activist groups and AIDS organizations that were established during the height of the epidemic are still present and working to assist people living with AIDS.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They may offer any combination of the following: health education, counseling and support, or advocacy for law and policy. AIDS organizations also continue to call for public awareness and support through participation in events like pride parades, [[World AIDS Day]], or [[AIDS Walk|AIDS walks]].

In the United States, men who have sex with men (MSM), described as gay and bisexual,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/msm/|title=Gay and Bisexual Men – HIV by Group|date=27 February 2018|website=www.cdc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; make up about 55% of the total HIV-positive population, and 67% of new HIV cases and 83% of the estimated new HIV diagnoses among ''all'' males aged 13 and older, and an estimated 92% of new HIV diagnoses among all men in their age group (2014 report). 1 in 6 gay and bisexual men are therefore expected to be diagnosed with HIV in their lifetime if current rates continue. Gay and bisexual men accounted for an estimated 54% of people diagnosed with AIDS, with 39% being African American, 32% being white, and 24% being Hispanic/Latino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV Among Gay and Bisexual Men|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/group/msm/cdc-hiv-msm.pdf|accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC estimates that more than 600,000 gay and bisexual men are currently living with HIV in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/group/msm/cdc-hiv-msm.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A review of four studies in which trans women in the United States were tested for HIV found that 27.7% tested positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Estimating HIV Prevalence and Risk Behaviors of Transgender Persons in the United States: A Systematic Review| pmid=17694429 | doi=10.1007/s10461-007-9299-3 | volume=12| issue=1| date=Jan 2008| journal=AIDS Behav| pages=1–17| author1=Herbst | first1=J.

In a 2008 study, the Center for Disease Control found that, of the study participants who were men who had sex with men ("MSM"), almost one in five (19%) had HIV and "among those who were infected, nearly half (44 percent) were unaware of their HIV status." The research found that white MSM "represent a greater number of new HIV infections than any other population, followed closely by black MSM — who are one of the most disproportionately affected subgroups in the U.S." and that most new infections among white MSM occurred among those aged 30–39 followed closely by those aged 40–49, while most new infections among black MSM have occurred among young black MSM (aged 13–29).&lt;ref name="2010sept_cdc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/.../docs/FastFacts-MSM-FINAL508COMP.pdf|title=CDC Fact Sheet – HIV and AIDS among Gay and Bisexual Men – Sept 2010|publisher=}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kaiser_2010gaymale_hiv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Daily-Reports/2010/September/24/AIDS-gay-men.aspx|title=CDC: One In Five Gay Men HIV-Positive|date=24 September 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a major HIV outbreak, [[Indiana]]'s largest-ever, occurred in two largely rural, economically depressed and poor counties in the southern portion of the state, due to the injection of a relatively new opioid-type drug called Opana ([[oxymorphone]]), which is designed be taken in pill form but is ground up and injected intravenously using needles. Because of the lack of HIV cases in that area beforehand and the youth of many but not all of those affected, the relative unavailability in the local area of safe needle exchange programs and of treatment centers capable of dealing with long-term health needs, HIV care, and drug addiction during the initial phases of the outbreak, it was not initially adequately contained and dealt with until those were set up by the government, and acute awareness of the issue spread. Such centers have now been opened, and short-term care is beginning to be provided; once the scope of the outbreak became clear, Governor [[Mike Pence]], despite some initial reservations, approved a legislative measure to allow safe, clean needle exchange programs and treatment for those affected, which could end up being instituted statewide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.npr.org/2015/04/24/402034996/hiv-outbreak-in-indiana-grows-with-nearly-140-confirmed-cases|title= HIV Outbreak In Indiana Grows With Nearly 140 Confirmed Cases|last1= Block |first1= Melissa |last2= Adams|first2= Jerome |date= 24 April 2015|website= NPR|publisher= |access-date=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6259">'''Harborside, formerly Harborside Health Center''' is a [[medical cannabis dispensary]], with its flagship location in [[Oakland, California]], and a second location in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. Founded in 2006 by longtime activist and entrepreneur, [[Steve DeAngelo]], Harborside operates as a non-profit patient collective.&lt;ref name="fortune" /&gt; In December 2011, Harborside Health Center was featured in the [[Discovery Channel]]'s four-part documentary series, ''[[Weed Wars]]''.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;
In June 2013 CNN premiered "Inside Man", an 8-episode documentary hosted and produced by Morgan Spurlock. The show's first episode provided a detailed, inside look at California's medical marijuana industry and featured Spurlock working in Harborside Health Center, as well as it described the legal troubles of the center.

It is considered to be the largest nonprofit medical cannabis dispensary in the state,&lt;ref name="vice" /&gt; if not the nation.&lt;ref name="nbcnews" /&gt;

== Federal case ==
In the summer of 2012, [[Northern District of California]] U.S. Attorney [[Melinda Haag]] filed [[civil forfeiture]] actions against the landlords of Harborside Health Center's two locations, in an effort to evict the dispensary.&lt;ref name="latimes" /&gt; Harborside challenged the evictions in state court, maintaining its compliance with state and local laws. A [[Superior Court]] judge dismissed the Oakland eviction, noting that the lease explicitly stated the use of the premises for the distribution of medical marijuana. The City of Oakland rallied behind Harborside&lt;ref name="villagevoice" /&gt; and attempted to join the dispensary in the fight, but a judge overruled their action. In 2015 three members of Congress from California—Reps. [[Sam Farr]], [[Dana Rohrabacher]] and [[Barbara Lee]]—released a statement in support of Harborside,&lt;ref name="ibtimes" /&gt; saying that the [[US Department of Justice]] "has overstepped its bounds" and "is not acting within the spirit or the letter of the law nor in the best interests of the people who depend on Harborside for reliable, safe medical marijuana." In May 2016, the Department of Justice dropped the 4 year case against Harborside Health Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/harborside-health-center-case-dropped_us_5728d2d1e4b016f37893a9c2|title=Feds Drop Case Against Influential Medical Marijuana Dispensary|date=2016-05-04|work=Huffington Post India|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Patient Services ==
Harborside Health Center was the first medical cannabis dispensary to introduce lab testing.&lt;ref name="eastbayexpress" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://greenflowermedia.com/harborside-health-center-about/|title=Harborside Health Center Is the Largest Cannabis Dispensary in the World|website=greenflowermedia.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dispensary also offers its patient-members an array of free [[wellness (alternative medicine)|wellness]] services,&lt;ref name="pressherald" /&gt; including acupuncture, yoga, [[Reiki]] and others. Harborside was the first marijuana organization to broadcast the administration of the non-psychoactive cannabinoid, CBD, to a child afflicted with [[Dravet syndrome]],&lt;ref name="vice"/&gt; a rare form of epilepsy ("Weed Wars," Episode 3).

== Retail sales ==
Beginning 1 January 2018, Harborside began retail sales to adults.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beta.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-california-marijuana-sales-20180101-story.html]&lt;/ref&gt; All adults over the age of 21 with a valid ID may enter.

The Health Minister administers national health policy. [[Primary healthcare]] remains the responsibility of the federal government, elements of which (such as the operation of hospitals) are overseen by individual [[States of Brazil|states]]. Public healthcare is provided to all [[Brazilian nationality law|Brazilian permanent residents]] and foreigners in Brazilian territory through the National Healthcare System, known as the [[Sistema Único de Saúde|Unified Health System]] ({{lang-pt|Sistema Único de Saúde}}, SUS).

National health policies and plans: The national health policy is based on the Federal [[Brazilian Constitution|Constitution of 1988]], which sets out the principles and directives for the delivery of healthcare in the country through the [[Sistema Único de Saúde|Unified Health System]] (SUS). Under the constitution, the activities of the federal government are to be based on multiyear plans approved by the national congress for four-year periods. The essential objectives for the health sector were improvement of the overall health situation, with emphasis on reduction of [[child mortality]], and political-institutional reorganization of the sector, with a view to enhancing the operative capacity of the SUS. The plan for the next period (2000–2003) reinforces the previous objectives and prioritizes measures to ensure access at activities and services, improve care, and consolidate the decentralization of SUS management.

The current legal provisions governing the operation of the health system, instituted in 1996, seek to shift responsibility for administration of the SUS to municipal governments, with technical and financial cooperation from the [[federal government|federal]] [[government]] and [[States of Brazil|states]]. Another regionalization initiative is the creation of health consortia, which pools the resources of several neighbouring municipalities. A vital instrument of support for regionalization is the project for strengthening and reorganizing the SUS.

===Regulatory actions===
Procedures for the registration, control, and labelling of foods are established under federal legislation, which assigns specific responsibilities to the health and [[agriculture]] sectors. In the health sector, health inspection activities have been decentralized to the state and municipal governments. The environmental policy derives from specific legislation and from the Constitution of 1988.

===Public healthcare services===
The main strategy for strengthening primary healthcare is the [[Family]] [[Health]] Program, introduced by the municipal health secretariats in collaboration with the states and the Ministry of [[Public Health]]. The federal government supplies technical support and transfers funding through Piso de Atenção Básica. Disease prevention and control activities follow guidelines established by technical experts in the Ministry of Public Health. The National [[Epidemiology]] Center (CENEPI), an agency of the National [[Health]] Foundation (FUNASA) coordinates the national epidemiological surveillance system, which provides information about and analysis of the national health situation.

===Individual healthcare services===
In 2014 there were 6,706 hospitals in Brazil.  Over 50% of hospitals are found in 5 states: São Paulo, Minas Gerais, Bahia, Rio de Janeiro and Parana.&lt;br /&gt;
Throughout the country, 78% of hospitals practice general medicine while 16% are specialized and 6% provide outpatient care only.&lt;ref&gt;Global Health Intelligence, [http://www.globalhealthintelligence.com "Global Health Intelligence"]. Retrieved 16 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2012, 66% of the country's hospitals, 70% of its 485,000 hospital beds, and 87% of its 723 specialized hospitals belonged to the private sector. In the area of diagnostic support and therapy, 95% of the 7,318 establishments were also private. 73% of the 41,000 ambulatory care facilities were operated by the public.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Health; Registry of healthcare facilities and their installations, [http://www2.datasus.gov.br/DATASUS/index.php?area=0204 "Ministry of Health; Registry of healthcare facilities and their installations"]. Retrieved 7 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The public hospital infrastructure required hospitals to be spread over a territory of {{convert|8.516|e6km2|abbr=off}}. As such, the public hospital infrastructure relies on a vast network of small hospitals. Over 55% of public hospitals have less than 50 beds.&lt;br /&gt;
Hospital beds in the public sector were distributed as follows: [[surgery]] (21%), clinical [[medicine]] (30%), [[pediatric]]s (17%), [[obstetric]]s (14%), [[psychiatry]] (11%) and other areas (7%). In the same year, 43% of public hospital beds, and half the hospital admissions were in municipal establishments. &lt;br /&gt;
Since 1999, the Ministry of Public Health has been carrying out a health surveillance project in Amazonia that includes epidemiological and environmental health surveillance, indigenous health and disease control components. With US 600 million dollars from a [[World Bank]] loan, efforts are being made to improve the operational infrastructure, training of human resources and research studies. An estimated 25% of the population is covered by at least one form of health insurance; 75% of the insurance plans are offered by commercial operators and companies with self-managed plans.

===Health supplies===
Brazil is among the greatest consumers markets for drugs, accounting for 3.5% share of the world market. To expand the access of the population to drugs, incentives have been offered for marketing [[generic product]]s, which cost an average of 40% less than brand-name products. In 2000, there were 14 industries authorized to produce generic drugs and about 200 registered generic drugs were being produced in 601 different forms. In 1998, the National Drug Policy was approved, whose purpose is to ensure safety, efficacy, and quality of drugs, as well as the promotion of rational use and access for the population to essential products. The responsibility for national production of immunobiologicals is entrusted to public laboratories; which have a long-standing tradition of producing vaccines and sera for use in official programs. The Ministry of Public Health invested some US$120 million in the development of the capacity of these [[laboratories]]. In 2000, the supply of products was sufficient to meet the need for heterologous sera, such as those used in the vaccines against tuberculosis, measles, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, yellow fever, and rabies. In 1999, quality control of the transfused blood consisted of 26 coordinating centers and by 44 regional centers.

===Human resources===
In 1999, the country had some 237,000 [[physician]]s, 145,000 [[dentist]]s, 77,000 [[nurse]]s, 26,000 [[dietitian]]s and 56,000 [[veterinarian]]s. The national average ratio was of 14 physicians per 10,000 population. In 1999, of the 665,000 professional positions, 65% were occupied by physicians, followed by nurses (11%), dentists (8%), pharmacists, biochemists (3.2%), physical therapists (2.8%) and by other professionals (10%).{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} An estimated 1.4 million health sector jobs are occupied by technical and auxiliary personnel. {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In 2009, for the first time, more new medical licenses were given for women than for men.&lt;ref name="demografiamedica"&gt;Demografia médica no Brasil: Volume 1 (Medical demography in Brazil: volume 1) http://portal.cfm.org.br/images/stories/pdf/demografiamedicanobrasil.pdf (in Portuguese)&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, the country had 364,757 physicians.&lt;ref name="demografiamedica" /&gt; In 2011, there were 1.95 physicians for each 1000 Brazilians, with higher concentrations in south, southeast and mid-western than in north and northeastern  Brazil.&lt;ref name="demografiamedica" /&gt; For each 1000 private [[health insurance]] users there were 7.6 occupied work posts for [[physicians]], and for each 1000 [[Sistema Único de Saúde]] users, there were 1.95 occupied work posts for physicians, making an average of 3.33 occupied work posts for physicians for each 1000 Brazilians.&lt;ref name="demografiamedica" /&gt; As to the distribution of physicians between [[Specialty (medicine)|medical specialties]] and [[primary care]], 55.09% of all Brazilian physicians were specialists.&lt;ref name="demografiamedica" /&gt;

===Health sector expenditure===
In 1998 national health expenditure amounted to US$62,000 million, which corresponded to nearly 7.9% of [[GDP]]. Of that total, public spending accounted for 41.2% and private expenditure accounted for 58.8%. In [[per capita]] terms, public spending is estimated at US$158 and private expenditure at US$225.

===Technical cooperation===
Technical [[cooperation]] [[project]]s are carried out with different countries, as well as with the World Bank and [[UNESCO]] among many others. International foundations also provide direct financing for projects or individuals. [[Brazil]] is also engaged in an intense exchange with the [[Mercosul]] countries, aimed at establishing common health regulations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paho.org/English/DD/AIS/cp_076.htm About Health in Brazil]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergency medicine==
[[File:Motolâncias SAMU Distrito Federal.jpg|thumb|right|SAMU Motorbike, [[Brazilian Federal District]].]]

[[Image:Equipe de Neurocirurgia no hospital da Beneficência Portuguesa de Porto Alegre.jpg|thumb|right|[[Surgery]] in [[Porto Alegre]].]]

Brazilian emergency medical service is locally called SAMU ("Serviço de Atendimento Móvel de Urgência (Mobile Emergency Attendance Service)").&lt;ref&gt;Portal da saúde website, [http://portal.saude.gov.br/saude/area.cfm?id_area=456 "SAMU"]. Retrieved 28 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emergency medicine]] (EM) is not a new field in Brazil. In 2002, the Ministry of Health outlined a document, the "Portaria 2048," which called upon the entire [[health care system]] to improve [[emergency]] care in order to address the increasing number of victims of [[road]] traffic accidents and violence, as well as the overcrowding of emergency departments (EDs) resulting from an overwhelmed primary care infrastructure. The document delineates standards of care for staffing, [[Medical equipment|equipment]], [[medication]]s and [[medical services|service]]s appropriate for both pre-hospital and in-hospital. It further explicitly describes the areas of knowledge that an emergency provider should master in order to adequately provide care. However, these recommendations have no enforcement mechanism and, as a result, emergency services in Brazil still lack a consistent standard of care.

Pre-hospital emergency medical services use a combination of basic ambulances staffed by technicians and advanced units with physicians on board. No universal phone number exists for emergency calls, and the dispatch center physician determines whether the call merits an emergency transport or not. Pre-hospital [[physician]]s have variable training in emergency care, with training backgrounds ranging from [[internal medicine]] to [[obstetric]]s to surgery.

Similar to the early years of EM in the United States, emergency department physicians in Brazil come from different specialty backgrounds, many of them having taken the job as a form of supplementary income or as a result of unsuccessful private clinical practice. Since 50% of [[medical school]] [[Alumnus|graduates]] in Brazil do not get residency positions, these new physicians with minimal clinical training look for work in emergency departments. In larger tertiary hospitals, the ED is divided into the main specialty areas, internal medicine, surgery, [[psychiatry]], [[pediatric]]s, and staffed by the corresponding [[physician]]s. Still, significant delays in care can occur when patients are inappropriately triaged or when communication between the areas is inadequate.  In the non-tertiary care centers, which make up the majority of hospitals in the country, emergency department physicians are largely under-trained, underpaid and overstressed by their working conditions. This has compromised [[patient]] care and created an incredible need for improvement in the emergency care system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/586565 Emergency medicine in Brazil]&lt;/ref&gt;

A current plan in action in Brazil called the CATCH plan (Commission for the Advancement of Technology for Communications and Health).  Funding is provided by the [[WHO]], [[ITU]], and voluntary countries and benefactors for existing and future projects.  This CATCH program approbates the best advancements to accommodate the nation of Brazil's health issues.

{{Fiqh |hygiene}}

Islamic jurisprudence specifies which foods are '''[[halal|{{transl|ar|ALA|halāl}}]]''' ({{lang|ar|حَلَال}} "lawful") and which are '''[[haraam|{{transl|ar|ALA|harām}}]]''' ({{lang|ar|حَرَامْ}} "unlawful"). This is derived from commandments found in the [[Qur'an]], the holy book of [[Islam]], as well as the [[Hadith]] and [[Sunnah]], libraries cataloging things the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] is reported to have said and done. Extensions of these rulings are issued, as [[fatwa]]s, by [[mujtahid]]s, with varying degrees of strictness, but they are not always widely held to be authoritative.

According to the [[Quran]], the only foods explicitly forbidden are meat from animals that die of themselves, blood, the meat of pigs, and any food dedicated to other than God.

However, a person would not be guilty of sin in a situation where the lack of any alternative creates an undesired necessity to consume that which is otherwise unlawful. ([[Quran]] 2:173) This is the "'''law of necessity'''" in Islamic jurisprudence: "That which is necessary makes the forbidden permissible."

==Food preparation==
{{Main article|Dhabīḥah}}
[[Dhabīḥah]] (ذَبِيْحَة) is a prescribed method of ritual animal slaughter; it does not apply to most aquatic animals. The animal must be slaughtered while mentioning the name of God ([[Allah]] in [[Arabic]]). According to some [[fatwa]]s, the animal must be slaughtered specifically by a [[Muslim]]; however, other fatwas dispute this, ruling that, according to verse 5:5 of the Qurʼan, an animal properly slaughtered by [[People of the Book]] is halal. The animal slaughtered must be killed quickly with a sharpened blade.

It must not suffer. It must not see the blade. It must not see or smell the blood from a previous slaughter. The main logic given by Islamic clerics is the significance of life. Many clerics argue that the life, given by God, is not an insignificant gift therefore no entity except God has the right to take this valuable gift away and by mentioning the God's name you imply that command of God.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Animals for food may not be killed by being boiled or electrocuted, and the carcass should be hung upside down for long enough to be free of blood.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/may/08/what-does-halal-method-animal-slaughter-involve What exactly does the halal method of animal slaughter involve? | Life and style | The Guardian&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; All water game is considered halal (although the [[Hanafi]] [[madhhab]] differs on this): "Lawful to you is game from the sea and its food as provision for you [who are settled] as well as for travellers, although you are forbidden to hunt on land while you are in the state of pilgrimage. And be conscious of God, unto whom you shall be gathered." (Qurʼan 5:96.)

==Prohibited food==
A variety of substances are considered as unlawful ([[haram]]) for humans to consume and, therefore, forbidden as per various Qurʼanic verses:

* Intoxicants and alcoholic beverages&lt;ref&gt;Quran 5:90&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Carrion]] (carcasses of dead animals which weren't killed by men or pets trained for that purpose, like [[Hunting dog|dogs]] or [[Falconry|falcons]])&lt;ref name="forbidden_food_1" /&gt;
* [[Blood as food|Blood]]&lt;ref name="forbidden_food_2"/&gt;
* Pork&lt;ref name="forbidden_food_1"&gt;Quran 2:173&lt;/ref&gt;
* Any food blasphemously dedicated to another God&lt;ref name="forbidden_food_1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="forbidden_food_2"&gt;Quran 5:3&lt;/ref&gt;
* An animal that has been strangled, beaten (to death), killed by a fall, gored (to death), or savaged by a beast of prey &lt;ref name="forbidden_food_2" /&gt;

Quranic verses which have information regarding halal foods include: 2:173, 5:5, and 6:118–119, 121.

===Intoxicants {{anchor|Alcohol}}===
{{Further information|Khamr}}
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Islam and alcohol]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] --&gt;
In Islam, consumption of any intoxicants (''[[khamr]]'', specifically, alcoholic beverages) is generally forbidden in the [[Qur'an]] through several separate verses revealed at different times over a period of years.

At first, it was forbidden for Muslims to attend prayers while intoxicated. In addition to this, most observant Muslims refrain from consuming food products that contain pure vanilla extract or soy sauce, as these food products may contain alcohol. There is some debate about whether the prohibition extends to dishes in which the alcohol would be cooked off or if it would be practically impossible to consume enough of the food to become intoxicated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://islam.about.com/od/health/f/alcohol.htm Alcohol in Islam&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inter-islam.org/Prohibitions/khmrmk.htm Islam Prohibits Alcohol&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Substances which are intoxicants are not prohibited as such, although their consumption is.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.misconceptions-about-islam.com/alcohol-is-forbidden.htm Common Misconceptions About Islam, Muslims and The Quran: Alcohol is forbidden in all forms]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, alcohol can be used as a disinfectant&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npsa.nhs.uk/cleanyourhands/resource-area/nhs-resources/faqs-for-coordinators/faqs-alcohol-handrub/#4 UK NHS National Patient Safety Agency: Alcohol handrub]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241597906_eng.pdf World Health Organization Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care]&lt;/ref&gt; or for cleaning, but not as a beverage.

The [[Alevi Islam|Alevi]] Muslims of Turkey permit alcohol, unlike many other denominations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://euobserver.com/news/27323 Turkey's Alevi Muslims look to EU for protection from intolerance]. EU Observer&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ismaili Muslims]] are also noted for discouraging, rather than prohibiting, alcohol.&lt;ref name="Bowen2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Innes Bowen|title=Medina in Birmingham, Najaf in Brent: Inside British Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mMSHCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA173|year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-1-84904-301-4|pages=173–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] and [[Mu'tazili|Mutazili]] sects believe that the use of alcohol has always been forbidden and refer to the [[Qur'an]] Ayah (4:43) as feeling of sleepiness and not to be awake.

===Non-alcoholic and Low-alcoholic beverages===
{{Further information|Non-alcoholic drink|Low-alcohol beer}}
A [[fatwa]] issued in November 2015 permitted the consumption of low-alcohol and non-alcoholic beverages provided that the given beverage contains an amount of 0.5% or the like of alcohol does not entail deeming its consumption unlawful as long as there is no effect of the alcohol upon consumption of the beverage and it does not intoxicate in large quantities.

[[Muhammad ibn al Uthaymeen]], a [[Salafi movement|Salafi]] scholar of [[Saudi Arabia]] was once asked about the so called (non-alcoholic) beer, given that some brands of non-alcoholic beer have a percentage of alcohol. The following was part of his reply:

{{quote|“As to percentage, do not think that any percentage of alcohol in a thing makes it unlawful; rather if the percentage of alcohol has an effect whereby when a person drinks this mix, he becomes intoxicated, then it is unlawful. But if the percentage is very small without effect, then it is lawful. For example, a percentage such as 1%, 2% or 3% does not make the beverage unlawful. Some people misunderstood the hadeeth that states, 'Whatever intoxicates in large quantities, then a small quantity of it is forbidden,' to mean that if a small percentage of an intoxicant is mixed with a large amount of a substance that is not intoxicating, then it is unlawful. This is a misunderstanding of the hadeeth. 'Whatever intoxicates in large quantities, a little of it is unlawful' means that if a lot of something will cause intoxication, and a little of it will not cause intoxication, then a lot or a little are both unlawful, because you may drink a little that does not cause intoxication, then you may be tempted to drink more and become intoxicated. But if something is mixed with alcohol, while the alcohol content is a minute amount and does not have any effect, then it is lawful and does not come under the ruling of this Hadeeth.”|}}

The Fatwa of the Permanent Committee reads,

{{quote|“If the beverage that contains a percentage of alcohol intoxicates in large quantities, then it is unlawful to consume any quantity of it, large or small. It is also deemed prohibited to sell or buy such a beverage and it is obligatory to dispose of it because it is considered khamr (intoxicant). However, if the consumption of a large amount of such a beverage does not intoxicate, then it is permissible to sell, buy, and consume it ...”|}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;Option=FatwaId&amp;Id=299059&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carrion===
Animal who dies of itself i.e., [[carrion]]
{{Quote|Forbidden to you is that which dies of itself, and blood, and flesh of swine, and that on which any other name than that of Allah has been invoked, and the strangled (animal) and that beaten to death, and that killed by a fall and that killed by being smitten with the horn, and that which wild beasts have eaten, except what you slaughter, and what is sacrificed on stones set up (for idols) and that you divide by the arrows; that is a transgression. This day have those who disbelieve despaired of your religion, so fear them not, and fear Me. This day have I perfected for you your religion and completed My favor on you and chosen for you Islam as a religion; but whoever is compelled by hunger, not inclining willfully to sin, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.| Qurʼan, Surah 5 (al-Maʼidah), ayah 3&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|5|3|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}


===Blood===

Blood and its by-products are forbidden in Islam, in the Qurʼan, surah 5, [[Al-Ma'ida|al-Maʼidah]], verse 3:

===Pork===

{{See also|Religious restrictions on the consumption of pork}}

Consumption of pork and products made from pork is strictly forbidden in Islam. The origin of this prohibition is in Surat al-[[Baqarah]]:

{{Quote|He has only forbidden you what dies of itself, and blood, and flesh of swine, and that over which any other (name) than (that of) God has been invoked; but whoever is driven to necessity, not desiring, nor exceeding the limit, no sin shall be upon him; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.| Qurʼan, Sura 2 (Al-Baqara), ayat 173&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|173|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Animals dedicated to other than God===
Animal dedicated to or slaughtered at the name of a human being or saint is prohibited.
{{Quote|He has only forbidden you what dies of itself, and blood, and flesh of swine, and that over which any other (name) than (that of) God has been invoked; but whoever is driven to necessity, not desiring, nor exceeding the limit, no sin shall be upon him; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.| Qurʼan, Sura 2 (Al-Baqara), ayat 173&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|173|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
===Prohibited methods of slaughtering===
An animal slaughtered by following methods is prohibited.
* strangled to death
* beaten to death
* died due to falling
* killed by being smitten by horn
* eaten by wild beast
{{Quote|Forbidden to you is that which dies of itself, and blood, and flesh of swine, and that on which any other name than that of Allah has been invoked, and the strangled (animal) and that beaten to death, and that killed by a fall and that killed by being smitten with the horn, and that which wild beasts have eaten, except what you slaughter, and what is sacrificed on stones set up (for idols) and that you divide by the arrows; that is a transgression. This day have those who disbelieve despaired of your religion, so fear them not, and fear Me. This day have I perfected for you your religion and completed My favor on you and chosen for you Islam as a religion; but whoever is compelled by hunger, not inclining willfully to sin, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.| Qurʼan, Surah 5 (al-Maʼidah), ayah 3&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|5|3|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Others===
The [[Hanafi]] school of Islamic jurisprudence forbids consumption of seafood other than "fish" with scholars in disagreement about whether prawns/shrimp are "fish", but in agreement that crocodiles, crabs, lobsters, mollusks are not. al-Fatawa al-Hindiyya, 5/289-291, Bada’i al-Sana’i, 5/35-39 and Radd al-Muhtar, 304-308.  Moreover, certain lower animals are considered haram, including land animals without blood, such as a hornet, insects, spiders, scorpions, with the singular exception of locusts. Surah al-A’raf, V: 157; Sunan Abu Dawud, no: 3806. Most reptiles are also considered haram, including chameleons, lizards, and snakes, as are most pests (''hasharat al-Ardh'') such as mice and rats. Surah al-A’raf, V: 157. A difference of opinion remains on whether consumption of horse, mule, and donkey are permitted. In the Quran, one finds this verse: “And (He has created) horses, mules, and donkeys, for you to ride and use for show; and He has created (other) things of which you have no knowledge.” Surah al-Nahl, V: 8. Which some scholars have interpreted as limiting these animals for riding and show and not permitting their consumption. Musnad Ahmad, 4/89, Sunan Abu Dawud, no: 3790, Sunan Nasa’i and Sunan Ibn Majah; Sahih al-Bukhari, no: 5202, 5205, and 5208. Predatory animals, such as lions and tigers, and birds of prey, such as falcons and hawks are forbidden to consume. Sahih Muslim, no: 1934. 

Donkey meat is prohibited by Muhammad, according to hadith.
{{Quote|Narrated Ibn `Umar:
The Prophet prohibited the eating of donkey's meat.&lt;ref&gt;sahih Bukhara 7:67:431&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Predator animals possessing [[fang]]s are prohibited.e.g. Cat, dog, lion etc.
{{quote|Narrated Abu Tha`laba:
Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) forbade the eating of the meat of beasts having fangs(canine teeth).&lt;ref&gt; Sahih Bukhara 7:67:438&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Al-Kafi 2:11117:2 &lt;/ref&gt;}}
Birds having talons are prohibited. e.g. Owl.
{{quote|Ibn 'Abbas reported that Islamic Prophet prohibited the eating of all fanged beasts of prey, and all the birds having talons(claws).&lt;ref&gt; Sahih Muslim 21:4752 &lt;/ref&gt;}}
Lizard is prohibited.
{{quote|Narrated AbdurRahman ibn Shibl:The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) forbade to eat the flesh of lizard.&lt;ref&gt; Sunao Abi Dawood 3796 &lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{quote|It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: “Who eats crows? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) called them vermin, By Allah, they are not from among the good and permissible things.” &lt;ref&gt; Sunao ibn Majah 4:28:3248&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Likewise snakes, scorpion and mice are prohibited.
{{quote|It was narrated from ‘Aishah that the Islamic Prophet said:
“Snakes are vermin, scorpions are vermin, mice are vermin and crows are vermin.”&lt;ref&gt; sunao ibn majah 4:28:3249 &lt;/ref&gt;}}
Islamic prophet prohibited eating of eel lizard and donkeys.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Kafi 2:11116:1&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad prohibited the use of horses and mules for food.&lt;ref&gt; Al-Kafi 2:11128:13 &lt;/ref&gt; Metamorphosed (animals to which a disobedient pre Islamic nation was converted as a punishment such as apes and monkeys) animals are prohibited by Muhammad &lt;ref&gt;Al-Kafi 3:11132:1&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Food certification ==
[[File:Halal restaurat in Almaty.jpg|thumb|Halal restaurant in [[Almaty]], [[Kazakhstan]]. Yurta (potatoes with meat) and kumis are made of ingredients considered halal.]]
Since the turn of the 21st century, there have been efforts to create organizations that certify food products as halal for Muslim consumers in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://halaladvocates.org/|title=Welcome halaladvocates.org - blueHost.com|date=|publisher=halaladvocates.org|accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Since 1991, some mainstream manufacturers of soups, grains, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, prepared foods, and other products, as well as hotels, restaurants, airlines, hospitals, and other service providers have pursued the halal market. These companies purchase halal-certified products. This can allow companies to export products to most Middle Eastern countries and South East Asian Countries. The oldest and most well-known halal certifier in the United States is called the Islamic Services of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isaiowa.org|title=?|date=|publisher=Islamic Services of America|author=|work=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Halal Products Certification Institute was established in California and became the first worldwide corporation that certified halal consumer products such as cosmetics, personal care products, and perfumes and fragrances. The institute was established by Islamic intellectual scholars and Muslim scientists to assure the dissemination of halal consumer products.

In Europe, several organizations have been created over the past twenty years in order to certify the halal products. A survey recently published by a French association of Muslim Consumers (ASIDCOM&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asidcom.org ASIDCOM]&lt;/ref&gt;) shows that the market of halal products has been developed in a chaotic way in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asidcom.org/spip.php?article86|title=Survey on the Halal certification agencies (December 2009)|publisher=ASIDCOM|accessdate=2010-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European certification organizations do not have a common definition of "halal" nor agreed upon control procedures and traceability. The controls implemented by individual agencies are all very different: they can go from an annual audit of the slaughterhouse, to checking each production with permanent controls in place and on-going independent monitoring.

Some animals and manners of death or preparation can make certain things [[haraam|haram]] to eat, that is, [[taboo food and drink]]. These include what are regarded as [[unclean animals]] such as swine, or animals that are sick.&lt;ref name="islamforlife"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamforlife.co.uk/haram%20list.htm|title=Haram food|publisher=islamforlife.co.uk|accessdate=2014-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[South Africa]], most chicken products have a halal stamp. The South African National Halal Authority (SANHA) issues certificates and products bearing this logo range from water, snacks, and even meat-free products (which may contain non-halal ingredients). The South African National Halal Authority also licenses the usage of the Halal logo in restaurants where the food is halal in addition to no alcohol or pork products being served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://halal-hub.org/cert_body.php|title=HHO: Recognized Halal Certification Bodies|date=|publisher=Halal-hub.org|accessdate=2012-07-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620132850/http://halal-hub.org/cert_body.php|archivedate=2012-06-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Availability of halal food in non-Islamic regions==
{{Advert section|date=December 2016}}
Many apparently meat-free dishes, and even some desserts, contain pork, such as most kinds of [[gelatin]], or other non-conforming substances. There is some disagreement about food additives such as [[monosodium glutamate]] (MSG) that may use enzymes derived from pig fat in the production process. It is difficult to avoid such additives when eating out since they are usually not listed on restaurant menus. Some Muslim organizations compile tables of such additives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://special.worldofislam.info/Food/numbers.html|title=Food additive numbers|date=|publisher=special.worldofislam.info|accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Advert inline|date=December 2016}}

The halal market is now estimated to be 20% of world trade and is growing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.halal-australia.com.au/global-halal-trade-opportunities/|title=Global Halal Trade Opportunities|last=|first=|date=|website=Halal Australia|access-date=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies from Europe and North America that would like to access the growing Halal market must get their consumable products Halal certified. The Global Halal Institute has a list of Halal certifiers that are approved by most Muslim countries with dietary import restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20130416090359/http://globalhalalinstitute.com/?p=66&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Americas ===

The first USDA approved Halal Food Company in the USA is Midamar Corporation.  The company began producing halal beef, chicken, lamb and turkey products for domestic and international consumption in 1974 and is based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa which is home to the one of the oldest Muslim communities in America and the longest standing mosque in America. In [[Dearborn, Michigan]], the home of one of the largest Muslim and Arab populations in the [[United States]], some fast-food restaurant chains such as the [[McDonald's Corporation]] have introduced halal [[chicken nugget]]s and chicken sandwiches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://islam.about.com/library/weekly/aa072901a.htm |title=Halal McNuggets a Hit in Detroit |first=Christine Huda |last=Dodge |publisher=[[about.com]] |accessdate=2011-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Popeye's Chicken]] in Ontario is mostly not halal-certified (depending on location); however, in 2012 a legal dispute broke out between a group of 14 Muslim franchisees and the chain over the company's decision to use machine-slaughtered birds. The fourteen Toronto area outlets are instead using hand-slaughtered halal birds, and are suing the company so that they can continue to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/article/1080411--popeyes-in-fight-over-halal-chicken|title=Popeye's in fight over Halal chicken|last=Stone|first=Laura|date=2 November 2011|newspaper=Toronto Star|accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Halal Food is generally available in [[Trinidad and Tobago]], however not all fast food outlets and poultry shops are halal certified.

=== Europe and Asia ===
In the [[United Kingdom]], [[China]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], or [[Singapore]], halal fried chicken restaurants having thousands of outlets serve halal foods, such as the [http://www.halalholidaypackages.co.uk/accommodation/adenya-beach-resort/ Adenya Beach Halal Resort], [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]], [[Nando's]], [[Brown's Chicken]], and [[Crown Fried Chicken]] companies. As of February 2009, Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in the U.K. began to sell halal meals in several restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1177969/Fast-food-chain-KFC-converts-London-restaurants-halal-menu.html | work=Daily Mail | first=Debra | last=Killalea | title=Fast food chain KFC converts eight London restaurants to halal-only menu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nirmal Hriday.JPG|200px|thumb|right|Men's ward at Kalighat, Home of the Pure Heart, ''Nirmal Hriday'']]
St. Mother Teresa opened this free hospice in 1952, next to the famous [[Kalighat Kali Temple]] in [[Kalighat]] [[Calcutta]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/fline/fl1419/14190170.htm Mother Teresa of Calcutta] ''[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]'' Vol. 14 :: No. 19 :: Sept.20 - 3 Oct. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of Indian officials, she changed an abandoned building which previously served as a temple for the [[Hindu]] goddess [[Kali]] into the "Kalighat home for the dying", a free hospice for the poor. Later on she changed the name to "Kalighat the Home of the Pure Heart (Nirmal Hriday)". People who were brought to the home received medical attention from the [[Missionaries of Charity]] and were given the opportunity to die with dignity, according to the rituals of their faith; Muslims were read the Quran, Hindus received water from the Ganges, and Catholics received the Last Rites.&lt;ref name=Spink55&gt;Spink, Kathryn (1997). ''Mother Teresa: A Complete Authorized Biography''. New York. HarperCollins, p.55. {{ISBN|0-06-250825-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "A beautiful death," she said, "is for people who lived like animals to die like angels—loved and wanted."&lt;ref name=Spink55 /&gt;

==Quality of medical care==
{{unreferenced section| date= April 2017}}
In 1991, Robin Fox, editor of the British medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'' visited the Home for Dying Destitutes in Calcutta (now [[Kolkata]]) and described the medical care the patients received as "haphazard". He observed that sisters and volunteers, some of whom had no medical knowledge, had to make decisions about patient care, because of the lack of doctors in the hospice. Fox specifically held Teresa responsible for conditions in this home, and observed that her order did not distinguish between [[curability|curable and incurable]] patients, so that people who could otherwise survive would be at risk of dying from infections and lack of treatment.

Fox conceded that the regimen he observed included cleanliness, the tending of wounds and sores, and kindness, but he noted that the sisters' approach to managing pain was "disturbingly lacking". The formulary at the facility Fox visited lacked strong [[analgesic]]s which he felt clearly separated Mother Teresa's approach from the [[hospice]] movement. Fox also wrote that needles were rinsed with warm water, which left them inadequately sterilized, and the facility did not isolate patients with tuberculosis. There have been a series of other reports documenting inattention to medical care in the order's facilities. Similar points of view have also been expressed by some former volunteers who worked for [[Missionaries of Charity|Teresa's order]]. St. Mother Teresa herself referred to the facilities as "Houses of the Dying".

==Baptisms of the dying==
St. Mother Teresa encouraged members of her order to [[baptism|baptize]] dying patients, without regard to the individual's religion. In a speech at the Scripps Clinic in [[California]] in January 1992, she said: "Something very beautiful... not one has died without receiving the special ticket for St. Peter, as we call it. We call baptism ticket for St. Peter. We ask the person, do you want a blessing by which your sins will be forgiven and you receive God? They have never refused. So 29,000 have died in that one house [in Kalighat] from the time we began in 1952."{{cn|date=April 2017}}

Critics have argued that patients were not provided sufficient information to make an informed decision about whether they wanted to be baptized and the theological significance of a Christian baptism.

Some of St. Mother Teresa's defenders have argued that baptisms are either soul-saving or harmless and hence the criticisms would be pointless (a variant of [[Pascal's Wager]]). Simon Leys, in a letter to ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', wrote: "Either you believe in the supernatural effect of this gesture &amp;ndash; and then you should dearly wish for it. Or you do not believe in it, and the gesture is as innocent and well-meaningly innocuous as chasing a fly away with a wave of the hand."&lt;ref name="New York Review of Books"&gt;{{cite journal | title= Letters: In Defense of Mother Teresa| last= Leys | first= Simon | date= 19 September 1996 | journal= [[The New York Review of Books]]| volume= 43  |issue= 14| url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1996/09/19/in-defense-of-mother-teresa/ | accessdate= 21 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lathyrism''' or '''neurolathyrism''' is a [[neurological disease]] of humans and domestic animals, caused by eating certain [[legumes]] of the [[genus]] ''[[Lathyrus]]''. This problem is mainly associated with ''[[Lathyrus sativus]]'' (also known as ''grass pea'', ''chickling pea'', ''kesari dal'', or ''almorta'') and to a lesser degree with ''[[Lathyrus cicera]]'', ''[[Lathyrus ochrus]]'' and ''[[Lathyrus clymenum]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itg.be/itg/DistanceLearning/LectureNotesVandenEndenE/47_Medical_problems_caused_by_plantsp11.htm "Medical problems caused by plants: Lathyrism"] at ''Prince Leopold Institute of Tropical Medicine'' online database&lt;/ref&gt; containing the [[toxin]] [[Oxalyldiaminopropionic acid|ODAP]].

The lathyrism resulting from the ingestion of ''[[Sweet pea|Lathyrus odoratus]]'' seeds (''sweet peas'') is often referred to as '''odoratism''' or [[osteolathyrism]], which is caused by a different toxin ([[beta-aminopropionitrile]]) that affects the linking of [[collagen]], a [[protein]] of [[connective tissue]]s.

==Symptoms==
The consumption of large quantities of ''Lathyrus'' grain containing high concentrations of the [[glutamate]] analogue neurotoxin [[Oxalyldiaminopropionic acid|β-oxalyl-L-α,β-diaminopropionic acid]] (ODAP, also known as β-''N''-oxalyl-amino-L-alanine, or BOAA) causes paralysis, characterized by lack of strength in or inability to move the lower limbs, and may involve [[pyramidal tracts]] producing signs of [[Upper motor neuron syndrome|upper motor neuron]] damage. The toxin may also cause [[aortic aneurysm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Neurology in Africa|authors= William Howlett|url=http://www.uib.no/cih/en/resources/neurology-in-africa|pages=248–249|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pt&gt;{{cite web| title=Lathyrism| url=http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/Lathyrism.htm#ref-1|publisher=Egton Medical Information Systems Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; A unique symptom of lathyrism is the [[atrophy]] of [[gluteus|gluteal muscles]] (buttocks). ODAP is a poison of [[mitochondria]],&lt;ref name=pt/&gt; leading to excess [[cell death]], especially in [[motor neurons]]. {{citation needed| date=February 2013}} Children can additionally develop bone deformity and reduced [[Neural development in humans#Human brain development|brain development]].&lt;ref name=patient/&gt;

==Prevalence==
This disease is prevalent in some areas of [[Bangladesh]], [[Ethiopia]], [[India]] and [[Nepal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |author1=Spencer P. S. |author2=Ludolph A. C. |author3=Kisby G. E. |title = Neurologic diseases associated with use of plant components with toxic potential

==Causes==
[[File:L-Glutaminsäure - L-Glutamic acid.svg|thumb|[[Glutamic acid]]]]

[[File:Beta-oxalylamino-L-alanine.svg|thumb|[[Oxalyldiaminopropionic acid]]]]
The toxicological cause of the disease has been attributed to the [[neurotoxin]] [[Oxalyldiaminopropionic acid|ODAP]] which acts as a structural analogue of the [[neurotransmitter]] [[glutamate]]. Ingestion of legumes containing the toxin occurs, although knowledge of how to detoxify Lathyrus is present, but drought conditions can lead to fuel and water shortages preventing the necessary steps from being taken, particularly in impoverished countries.&lt;ref name=patient/&gt; Lathyrism usually occurs where the despair of [[poverty]] and [[malnutrition]] leaves few other food options. Lathyrism can also be caused by food [[adulteration]].

==Prevention==
Recent research suggests that sulfur [[amino acid]]s have a protective effect against the toxicity of ODAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sriram K. |author2=Shankar S.K. |author3=Boyd M.R. |author4=Ravindranath V. | year = 1998 | title = Thiol Oxidation and Loss of Mitochondrial Complex I Precede Excitatory Amino Acid-Mediated Neurodegeneration | url = | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 18 | issue = 24| pages = 10287–10296 | pmid = 9852566 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eating the chickling pea with grain having high concentrations of sulphur-based [[amino acid]]s reduces the risk of lathyrism if grain is available. Food preparation is also an important factor. Toxic amino acids are readily soluble in water and can be leached. Bacterial ([[lactic acid]]) and fungal ([[tempeh]]) fermentation is useful to reduce ODAP content. Moist heat ([[boiling]], [[steaming]]) [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]]s [[Protease inhibitor (biology)|protease inhibitor]]s which otherwise add to the toxic effect of raw grasspea through depletion of protective sulfur amino acids. During times of drought and famine, water for steeping and fuel for boiling is frequently also in short supply. Poor people sometimes know how to reduce the chance of developing lathyrism but face a choice between risking lathyrism and [[starvation]].&lt;ref name=patient/&gt;

The underlying cause for excessive consumption of grasspea is a lack of alternative food sources. This is a consequence of [[poverty]] and political conflict. The prevention of lathyrism is therefore a [[socio-economic]] challenge.

During the [[Peninsular War|Spanish War of Independence]] against Napoleon, grasspea served as a famine food. This was the subject of one of [[Francisco de Goya]]'s famous aquatint prints titled ''Gracias a la Almorta'' ("Thanks to the Grasspea"), depicting poor people surviving on a porridge made from grasspea flour, one of them lying on the floor, already crippled by it.

During WWII, on the order of Colonel I. Murgescu, commandant of the [[Vapniarka concentration camp]] in Transnistria, the detainees - most of them Jews - were fed nearly exclusively with fodder pea. Consequently, they became ill from lathyrism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://isurvived.org/ isurvived.org]: ''The Holocaust in Romania Under the Antonescu Government'', by Marcu Rozen.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film ''Ashes'' [English title] by [[Andrzej Wajda]] based on the novel ''[[The Ashes (film)|Popioly]]'' [Polish title] translated as ''Lost army'' [English title] by [[Stefan Żeromski]] spanning the period 1798–1812, a horse is poisoned by grain from a Spanish village. The footage of the horse losing control of its hind legs suggests that it was fed with Almortas.

==Modern occurrence==
During the [[Spain under Franco#Isolation (1945–1953)|post Civil war period]] in Spain, there were several outbreaks of lathyrism, caused by the shortage of food, which led people to consume excessive amounts of Almorta flour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historiacocina.com/gourmets/venenos/almortas.htm |title=AZCOYTIA, Carlos (2006): "''Historia de la Almorta or el veneno que llegó con el hambre tras la Guerra Civil Española''". '&amp;#39;HistoriaCocina'&amp;#39; |publisher=Historiacocina.com |accessdate=2013-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain, a seed mixture known as comuña&lt;ref&gt;The etymological origin of this name is from "común" (''common'') in its meaning of mixture, referring to the mix of seeds obtained when cleaning the grain and which contaminate the main grain, generally wheat.&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of ''Lathyrus sativus'', ''L. cicera'', ''Vicia sativa'' and ''V. ervilia'' provides a potent mixture of toxic amino acids to poison monogastric (single stomached) animals. Particularly the toxin [[cyanoalanine|β-cyanoalanine]] from seeds of ''V. sativa'' enhances the toxicity of such a mixture through its inhibition of sulfur amino acid metabolism [conversion of methionine to cysteine leading to excretion of cystathionine in urine] and hence depletion of protective reduced thiols. Its use for sheep does not pose any lathyrism problems if doses do not exceed 50 percent of the ration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Neglected crops 1492 from a different perspective| url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/t0646e/T0646E0q.htm | author=J.E. Hernández Bermejo |author2=J. León| publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations | location=Rome | year=1994 | isbn = 92-5-103217-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronald Hamilton suggested in his paper ''The Silent Fire: ODAP and the death of Christopher McCandless'' that itinerant traveler [[Christopher McCandless]] may have died from starvation after being unable to hunt or gather food due to lathyrism induced paralysis of his legs caused by eating the seeds of ''[[Hedysarum alpinum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ODAP and the death of Christopher McCandless|author=Ronald Hamilton|date=September 12, 2013| work=| url=http://www.christophermccandless.info/Ronald-Hamilton/ronald-hamilton-intothewild1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, a preliminary lab analysis indicated that the seeds did contain ODAP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/how-chris-mccandless-died newyorker.com]&lt;/ref&gt; However, a more detailed mass spectrometric analysis conclusively ruled out ODAP and lathyrism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/chris-mccandless-died-update newyorker.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related conditions==
A related disease has been identified and named [[osteolathyrism]], because it affects the bones and connecting tissues, instead of the nervous system. It is a skeletal disorder, caused by the toxin [[beta-aminopropionitrile]] (BAPN), and characterized by [[hernias]], [[aortic dissection]], [[exostoses]], and [[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome|kyphoscoliosis]] and other skeletal deformities, apparently as the result of defective aging of [[collagen]] [[Connective tissue|tissue]]. The cause of this disease is attributed to beta-aminopropionitrile, which inhibits the copper-containing [[enzyme]] [[lysyl oxidase]], responsible for cross-linking procollagen and proelastin. BAPN is also a [[metabolic product]] of a compound present in sprouts of grasspea, pea and lentils.&lt;ref&gt;COHN, D.F.

[[File:Läkemedelsverket (Uppsala Science Park).png|thumb|Medical Products Agency, headquarters in [[Uppsala]]]]
The '''Medical Products Agency''' ('''MPA'''; {{lang-sv|Läkemedelsverket}}) is the [[Government agencies in Sweden|government agency in Sweden]] responsible for regulation and surveillance of the development, manufacturing and sale of medicinal [[drug]]s, [[medical device]]s and [[cosmetics]].

Its task is also to ensure that both individual [[patient]]s and [[healthcare]] professionals have access to safe and effective medicinal products and that these are used in a rational and cost-effective manner.

The Swedish Medical Products Agency is one of the leading [[regulatory]] authorities in the [[European Union|EU]]. During the last five years, the Swedish MPA has been among the top three agencies in Europe, counting the number of approvals processes managed for central (i.e. European) approvals of medicines. The Swedish MPA also has strong representation in more than 110 working groups and committees in the scope of the [[Heads of Medicines Agencies]] (HMA) and European Medicines Agency ([[European Medicines Agency|EMA]]) for regulation of medical products in Europe.

The Medical Products Agency is a government body under the aegis of the Swedish Ministry of Health and Social Affairs. Its operations are largely financed through fees. Approximately 750 people work at the agency; most are [[pharmacist]]s and [[Physician|doctors]].

'''Mosa Conference''' is an annual international (bio)medical research conference organised for students, held at the Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences (FHML) of [[Maastricht University]].&lt;ref name="About Mosa Conference"&gt;[http://www.mosa-conference.nl/mosaconference/ About Mosa Conference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212224044/http://www.mosa-conference.nl/mosaconference/ |date=2015-02-12 }} Mosa Conference. 2015-02-12&lt;/ref&gt; The conference is organised by students of Maastricht University. Mosa Conference 2016 will take place June 21 and 22.

== History ==
In 1996, the Maastricht Medical Student Research Conference (MMSRC) Foundation was founded by medical students of the Maastricht University to create a platform for students to present their own research and learn about a specific medical theme via lectures and workshops. This led to the foundation of MMSRC.

The first conference, held in 1997, focused entirely on Dutch students of the [[Maastricht University]]. Through the years, the focus of the conference shifted towards an international conference which not only Dutch, but all (bio)medical students can visit and participate in.

In 2012, MMSRC fused with Clinical Investigator Science Symposium (CISS) to establish Mosa Conference. As a result of this fusion, students from the physician-clinical investigator study of Maastricht University are required to present their research at Mosa Conference as part of their [[curriculum]].

In 2014, the organisation of the Biomedical Sciences Master study of Maastricht University agreed to create the same requirement for their Biomedical Sciences students to present at the conference from Mosa Conference 2015 onwards.

== Call for abstracts ==
The call for abstracts refers to the period before the actual conference when students can send in an abstract of their research to the organisation of Mosa Conference. These abstracts are then blinded and randomised, and sent to the Scientific Advisory Board, consisting of (bio)medical professors, doctors and researchers who scores the abstracts based on predetermined criteria. The students with the highest scored abstracts are then invited to present their research at Mosa Conference by an oral or poster presentation.

== Conference structure ==
Visitors of Mosa Conference are divided into two groups: regular '''visitors''' and '''participants'''. Regular visitors can attend the lectures and workshops, and function as audience to the student presentations. Participants are the students who present their research at Mosa Conference and compete to win prizes.

The conference offers certain elements that are consistent every year. Students can present their research via a poster or oral presentation. Furthermore, lectures and workshops are held at the conference which revolve around a yearly changing theme.

=== Student poster presentations ===
Most student presentations at the conference are poster presentations. Students present their research, depicted on their poster, to a professional and student jury. Both the poster and the presentation itself are judged based on predetermined criteria. The student with the best poster presentation wins a prize, which is awarded at the end of the conference.

=== Student oral presentation ===
Oral presentations are given by students whose abstracts received the highest scores from the Scientific Advisory Board. The students have about ten minutes to present their research to an audience and professional jury with a [[PowerPoint]] presentation. The presentation is, like the poster presentations, judged based on predetermined criteria. The students with the best and second-best oral presentations win prizes.

=== Lectures ===
The lectures at Mosa Conference revolve around a yearly changing (bio)medical theme and are given by speakers who are considered experts in their respective fields. These lectures last about an hour and are divided between the conference days.

=== Workshops ===
Workshops, also known as ''interactive lectures'', are given in rounds where visitors and participants can choose between workshops (usually three per round) to attend. The workshops are more interactive with the audience than the regular lectures and are given by an expert in the field, a [[PhD student]] or a (bio)medical company.

== Conference theme ==
Every year Mosa Conference has a different (bio)medical theme. The theme of Mosa Conference 2015 is '''Searching For Disease''',&lt;ref name="Mosa Conference"&gt;[http://www.mosa-conference.nl/ Mosa Conference] Mosa Conference. 2015-02-12&lt;/ref&gt; and features screening and (pre-)diagnostics, together with the technology and research that form the foundation for this. The theme is central to the lectures and workshops held at the conference.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3234">A '''nutrient enema''', also known as '''feeding per rectum''', '''rectal alimentation''', or '''rectal feeding''', is an [[enema]] administered with the intent of providing [[nutrition]] when normal [[eating]] is not possible. Although this treatment is ancient, dating back at least to [[Galen]] and a common technique in 19th century medicine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1987791|title=The nutrient enema|author=J. W. A. Mackenzie|date=March 1943|doi=10.1136/adc.18.93.22 |pmid=21032242|volume=18|issue=93|journal=Arch. Dis. Child.|pages=22–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; nutrient enemas have been superseded in modern medical care by [[tube feeding]] and [[Parenteral nutrition|intravenous feeding]].

A variety of different mixes have been used for nutrient enemas throughout history. A paper published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1926 stated that because the [[rectum]] and lower [[digestive tract]] lack [[digestive enzyme]]s, it is likely that only the end-products of normal digestion such as [[sugars]], [[amino acid]]s, [[salt]] and [[alcohol]], will be absorbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Rectal Alimentation| journal = Nature| volume = 118| pages = 858–859| year = 1926| doi = 10.1038/118858a0|bibcode = 1926Natur.118..858.| issue=2980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This treatment was given to U.S. President [[James A. Garfield]] after his shooting in 1881, and is asserted to have prolonged his life.&lt;ref&gt;Bliss, D. W. "Feeding Per Rectum: As Illustrated in the Case of the Late President Garfield and Others". Washington: N.p., n.d. Rpt. from the Medical Record, July 15, 1882.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[United States Senate]] [[United States Senate Intelligence Committee|Intelligence Committee]] published an [[Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture|unclassified summary]] of its 6,000 page classified report on the [[CIA]]'s use of [[torture]], its previously unknown use of "rectal rehydration" for punishment and torture became apparent.&lt;ref name=MiamiHerald2014-12-09&gt;

'''Pakistan Islamic Medical Association (PIMA)''' was established in Oct, 1979. Since its inception PIMA has been striving to achieve its goals in professional and training of [[Physician|doctors]], calling its members and associates towards Islamic way of life through its regular Dawah and training workshops and seminars. PIMA played a significant role in enrichment of professional skills through regular hands on workshops to meet the requirements of the country in particular and of international community during wars, disaster and peace. PIMA relief remained always on the fore fronts during National and international disasters like earthquakes, tsunami, floods, cyclones and wars. PIMA has established medical institutions of international repute contributing in quality medical, dental and allied specialties. Through its regular contribution in health awareness, education and community services PIMA has been regularly struggling for upbringing the health of the masses. The health institutions of PIMA like hospitals, clinics, free medical camps and specialized campaigns remained instrumental alleviating the suffering of those who are otherwise not cared. PIMA has developed specialized expertise in managing disasters of all sorts whether man made or natural. PIMA Project [[Prevention of Blindness Trust]] &lt;ref&gt;http://pobtrust.org&lt;/ref&gt; has remarkable services for the prevention of blindness national &amp; International Levels. PIMA established projects of international repute in collaboration with FIMA,&lt;ref&gt;http://fimaweb.net&lt;/ref&gt; like Consortium of Islamic medical colleges (CIMCO), Islamic Hospital Consortium (IHC), FIMA save vision,&lt;ref&gt;http://fimasavevision.org&lt;/ref&gt; FIMA save dignity and many other projects. PIMA’s mega projects like Peshawar Medical College and Mega pharmaceutical industry are remarkable achievements serving the community at large.

==Mission==
[[Muhammad]] was said to have said that “[[Allah]] creates no [[disease]] without creating a cure for it as well” and “the superiority of the learned over the mere pins is like the superiority of the moon when it is full over all other stars and the ink of the sailors is more previous than the Good of the martyrs”; these sayings direct us towards reaching for unknown cures and [[medical]] research is thus our religions duty.

==Aims and objectives==
# To motivate [[Physician|doctors]] to follow the basic tenets of Islam.
# To use the contact with public for propagation of Islam.
# To organize, ideological, moral and professional training of member doctors.
# To help align the National Health Policy according to the principles of Islam.&lt;ref name="Aims &amp; Objects"&gt;http://pima.org.pk/dev/?p=864&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The history dates back to 1979, when fifty doctors from all over [[Pakistan]] met at students teachers center (STC) of the Punjab University, Lahore in the month of October. They laid down the foundation of an organization named as Pakistan Doctors Forum (PDF), a fraternity of medical profession. PDF carried on its mission for two years, initially by emphasizing more an organizational work and the membership drive.&lt;ref&gt;http://pima.org.pk/dev/?page_id=53&lt;/ref&gt; It was April 1981, [[Convention (meeting)|convention]] of PDF was held in [[Rawalpindi]]. This forum was renamed as "Pakistan Islamic Medical Association" (PIMA) and its constitution was approved. PIMA is an active member of Federation of Islamic Medical Association (FIMA), an international forum for collaboration of all Islamic medical associations around the globe. In the journey through 25 years, PIMA has emerged as a strong forum for Muslim medical professionals to excel in profession, ethics and provide relief to oppressed humanity in the country and around the globe as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7504">'''Patient management software''' ('''PMS''') is referred to as software that is regulated as a medical device.&lt;ref&gt;Weber-Jahnke, J., Williams, J. (2010). Regulation of Patient Management Software. Health Law Journal.&lt;/ref&gt; It is software that is used to acquire medical information from a medical device to be used in the treatment or diagnosis of a patient. It can also be software that is an adjunct to a medical device and directly contributes to the treatment of the patient by performing analysis, or providing treatment or diagnosis functionality that replaces the decision and judgment of a physician.

==Clinical applications==
Medical devices are classified and these classifications became somewhat less restrictive in December, 2010. Regulations provide rules for classifying medical devices into four increasing risk levels – Class I, Class II, Class III, and Class IV. Patient management software is classified as either Class I or Class II. Software that is intended to be used to view images, or other real time data, as an adjunct to the monitoring device itself, for the purpose of aiding in treatment or diagnosis of a patient, would be Class I medical devices. Medical device software that is an adjunct to another medical device and is involved in data manipulation, data analysis, data editing, image generation, determination of measurements, identification of a region of interest in an image, or identification (by an alarm or alert) of results from a monitor that are outside of an established range, is a Class II medical device if it: (1) provides the only means and opportunity to capture or acquire data from a medical device for aiding directly in diagnosis or treatment of a patient; or (2) replaces a diagnostic or treatment decision made by a physician.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/md-im/activit/announce-annonce/md_qa_software_im_qr_logicels-eng.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of patient management software are [[Picture archiving and communication system|PACS]], [[remote patient monitoring]]. Others include any medical device that is used to transmit data from a medical device or analyze data from a medical device such as blood pressure monitors and glucose monitors.

==Controversies==
Many in the health care industry have raised concerns over the quality and software development process of PMS. The development of PMS is often criticized as too focused on simply the software development process and not the product. Much of these concerns are rooted in safety issues&lt;ref&gt;
Weber-Jahnke, J. (2011). A Preliminary Study of Apparent Causes and Outcomes of Reported Failures with Patient Management Software. International Conference on Software Engineering. New York: ACM.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Computerized physician order entry]], an example of PMS, highlights some of these safety concerns.

Other criticisms are aimed at the regulations in place. Some critics argue that regulations stifle innovation and that vendors will no longer have any incentive to create new products. Also, existing and future products will have to adhere to strict licensing procedures and this may affect the sustainability of these products. 

Another concern is that the rules are disproportionately strict in comparison to the actual risk associated with a wide variety of eHealth systems&lt;ref&gt;
Whitney, J. (2011). Let's Strengthen Healthcare Software Regulation. Canadian Healthcare Technology.&lt;/ref&gt; and this may prevent companies from initiating the development of new products.

==Canada==
Regulation of patient management software applies to anyone importing, distributing or selling the software. Health Canada is responsible for regulating the sale, advertising and distribution of patient management software in Canada. Regulated software is classified based on risk increasing from Class I to Class II.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, A. Implications of ISO Certification and Licensing of Patient Management Software - Environmental Scan Issue 5. Ottawa: Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
The type of license required depends on the classification of the software. An establishment license is required from a vendor or manufacturer of Class I PMS and a medical device license is required from a vendor or manufacturer of Class II PMS. ISO 13485 certification is required of manufacturers of Class II medical devices.

===History===
In August, 2009, Health Canada which is responsible for regulating the advertising, manufacturing and sale of medical devices in Canada issued a notice confirming that patient management software is a medical device and is subject to the Medical Devices Regulations and the Food and Drugs Act.  The development of the regulation of patient management software as a medical device began three years earlier when a company called MedManager created a patient portal technology that was deemed a Class II medical device and subject to regulation by Health Canada. Developments had taken place thereafter, to indicate that medical device classification include patient management software. A notice was officially released by Health Canada in August, 2009 indicating that patient management software was indeed a medical device. 

Therefore, organizations that import, sell or otherwise distribute Class I patient management software must have an establishment license and Class II patient management software must have a medical device licence. In order to obtain a medical device licence, manufacturers must hold a quality management system (QMS) certificate issued by an accredited registrar showing that the QMS is compliant with ISO 13485: 2003 Medical devices – Quality management systems – requirements for regulatory purposes. Organizations are also required to perform certain post-market responsibilities such as maintaining distribution and complaint handling records, mandatory problem reporting and recalls.&lt;ref&gt;http://itac.ca/uploads/pdf/FAQ-Patient_Management_Software_Licensing_V1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

In December, 2010, a notice was released by Health Canada further clarifying the definition, classification and licensing requirements of software regulated as a medical device. For example, software used to transmit data from a medical device, or software that analyzes data from a medical device and makes diagnostic or treatment decisions normally made by a physician, would be considered software regulated as a medical device. A product that only stores and displays patient information is not a medical device. Examples of software that are not medical devices are middleware, EHR's including those that are custom built for use only within the organization, applications that perform administrative calculations and manipulations (such as determining time between appointments, or [[workflow management]]), the [[Wii Fit]] video game, personal [[Body mass index|BMI calculator]]s and [[pedometer]] software used for fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/md-im/activit/announce-annonce/md_notice_software_im_avis_logicels-eng.php |title=Software Regulated as a Class I or Class II Medical Device - Health Canada Notice 2010-12-03 |publisher=Hc-sc.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regulations apply to software that is distributed with or without compensation.

'''Penile fracture''' is rupture of one or both of the ''[[Tunica albuginea (penis)|tunica albuginea]]'', the fibrous coverings that envelop the penis's ''[[corpus cavernosum penis|corpora cavernosa]]''. It is caused by rapid blunt force to an [[erect penis]], usually during [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal intercourse]], or aggressive [[masturbation]].&lt;ref name="Greenberg's Text-Atlas of Emergency Medicine"&gt;{{cite book|title=Greenberg's Text-Atlas of Emergency Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tjZttRRH8H8C&amp;pg=PA318|accessdate=15 October 2012|date=22 November 2004|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-4586-4|page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sometimes also involves partial or complete rupture of the [[urethra]] or injury to the [[Dorsal nerve of the penis|dorsal nerves]], [[Dorsal veins of the penis|veins]] and [[Dorsal artery of the penis|arteries]].&lt;ref name=Haas&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Haas CA, Brown SL, Spirnak JP |title=Penile fracture and testicular rupture |journal=World J Urol |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=101–6 |date=April 1999 |pmid=10367369 |doi= 10.1007/s003450050114|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
A popping or cracking sound, significant pain, swelling, immediate loss of erection leading to flaccidity, and skin [[hematoma]] of various sizes are commonly associated with the sexual event.&lt;ref name="Greenberg's Text-Atlas of Emergency Medicine"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stein2015&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Stein DM, Santucci RA |title=An update on urotrauma|journal=Current Opinion in Urology|volume=25|issue=4|pages=323–30|date=July 2015|pmid=26049876|doi=10.1097/MOU.0000000000000184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
[[File:Penis_cross_section.svg|thumb|right|Cross-section of the human penis]]
Penile fracture is a relatively uncommon clinical condition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Vaginal intercourse and aggressive [[masturbation]] are the most common causes.&lt;ref name="Greenberg's Text-Atlas of Emergency Medicine"/&gt; A 2014 study of accident and emergency records at three hospitals in [[Campinas]], Brazil, showed that [[woman on top]] positions caused the greatest risk with the [[missionary position]] being the safest. The research conjectured that when the receptive partner is on top, they usually control the movement and are not able to interrupt movement when the penis suffers a misaligned penetration. Conversely, when the penetrative partner is controlling the movement, they have better chances of stopping in response to pain from misalignment, minimizing harm.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1155/2014/768158 | volume=2014 | title=Mechanisms Predisposing Penile Fracture and Long-Term Outcomes on Erectile and Voiding Functions | journal=Advances in Urology | pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of ''taqaandan'' (also ''taghaandan'') also puts men at risk of penile fracture. Taqaandan, which comes from a [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] word meaning "to click", involves bending the top part of the erect penis while holding the lower part of the shaft in place, until a click is heard and felt.  Taqaandan is said to be painless and has been compared to cracking one's knuckles, but the practice of taqaandan has led to an increase in the prevalence of penile fractures in western [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/features/health/la-hew-mating9-2009feb09,0,5573112,full.story |title=Preventing penile fractures and Peyronie's disease - latimes.com |author=Nuzzo, Regina |date= 9 February 2009|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taqaandan may be performed to achieve [[detumescence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zargooshi J |title=Penile fracture in Kermanshah, Iran: report of 172 cases |journal=J. Urol. |volume=164 |issue=2 |pages=364–6 |date=August 2000 |pmid=10893586 |doi= 10.1016/s0022-5347(05)67361-2|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Imaging studies ==
Ultrasound examination is able to depict the tunica albuginea tear in the majority of cases (as a hypoechoic discontinuity in the normally echogenic tunica). In a study on 25 patients, Zare Mehrjardi et al. concluded that ultrasound is unable to find the tear just when it is located at the penile base. In their study magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) accurately diagnosed all of the tears (as a discontinuity in the normally low signal tunica on both T1- and T2-weighted sequences). They concluded that ultrasound should be considered as the initial imaging method, and MRI can be helpful in cases that ultrasound does not depict any tear but clinical suspicious for fracture is still high. In the same study, authors investigated accuracy of ultrasound and MRI for determining the tear location (mapping of fracture) in order to perform a tailored surgical repair. MRI was more accurate than ultrasound for this purpose, but ultrasound mapping was well correlated with surgical results in cases where the tear was clearly visualized on ultrasound exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zare Mehrjardi|first=Mohammad|last2=Darabi|first2=Mohsen|last3=Bagheri|first3=Seyed Morteza|last4=Kamali|first4=Koosha|last5=Bijan|first5=Bijan|date=June 2017|title=The role of ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in penile fracture mapping for modified surgical repair|journal=International Urology and Nephrology|volume=49|issue=6|pages=937–945|doi=10.1007/s11255-017-1550-x|issn=1573-2584|pmid=28258528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment and prognosis==
Penile fracture is a [[medical emergency]], and emergency [[surgery|surgical]] repair is the usual treatment. Delay in seeking treatment increases the complication rate. Non-surgical approaches result in 10–50% complication rates including [[erectile dysfunction]], permanent penile curvature, damage to the [[urethra]] and pain during [[sexual intercourse]], while operatively treated patients experience an 11% complication rate.&lt;ref name="Greenberg's Text-Atlas of Emergency Medicine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PeitzmanRhodes2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew B. Peitzman|author2=Michael Rhodes|author3=C. William Schwab |author4=Donald M Yealy |author5=Timothy C Fabian|title=The trauma manual: trauma and acute care surgery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JnTMQOMcYZwC&amp;pg=PA305|accessdate=18 April 2010|date=1 September 2007|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-6275-5|pages=305–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, [[retrograde urethrogram]] may be performed to rule out concurrent urethral injury.&lt;ref name="PeitzmanRhodes2007"/&gt;
&lt;!--Peitzman supports all this section except the 11% figure which is supported by Greenberg citing Eke N. (2002) Fracture of the penis. Br. J. Surg. 89;555–565 PMID 11972544 --&gt;

==Legal issues==
In the [[United States]], the case of ''[http://masscases.com/cases/app/63/63massappct516.html Doe v. Moe]'', 63 Mass. App. Ct. 516, 827 N.E.2d 240 (2005), tested liability for a penile fracture injury caused during sexual intercourse. The court declined to find duty as between two consensual adults. The plaintiff in this case, a man who suffered a fractured penis, complained that the defendant, his ex-girlfriend, had caused his injury while she was on top of him during sexual intercourse. The court ruled in her favor, determining that her conduct was neither [[Wanton negligence|legally wanton]] nor reckless.

A '''Pharmaceutical Physician''' is a [[healthcare professional]] who performs actions related to [[pharmacology]]. They work in biotechnology companies, Clinical Research Organisations (CROs), Regulatory Authorities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onlymedics.com/ Recruiting Physicians for Pharma: Only Medics]&lt;/ref&gt; and pharmaceutical companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.axess.co.uk/candidates/specialist-areas/pharmaceutical-physician-overview/ Pharmaceutical Physician Jobs | Pharaceutical Physician Recruitment]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role==
Pharmaceutical physicians's primary role is to inform others about development of new treatments, newly established products dealing with the pharmaceutical industry, and to help with medical need. Pharmaceutical physicians must make sure that all of the materials comply with Pharmaceutical Medicines Code of Practice Authority (PMCPA).

==Types==
*'''Clinical pharmacologist or Phase I physician'''- works with chemists, biochemists, pharmacologists and toxicologists on drug development.
*'''Clinical research physician (CRP) or Phase II/III physician'''- examines newly used chemical or biological products on patients.
*'''Medical adviser(MA)'''- works with marketing and sales people to commercialize their company.

==History==
Pharmaceutical physicians were first recruited after the second World War to fluctuate medical aspects of drug development. British Association of Pharmaceutical Physicians was the first industry composed of pharmaceutical physicians. It was created in 1957 in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.careers.cam.ac.uk/sectors/health/files/Pharmaceutical_Physician_glossy_July_07.pdf http://www.careers.cam.ac.uk/sectors/health/files/Pharmaceutical_Physician_glossy_July_07.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of [[healthcare in the United States]], a '''pre-existing condition''' is a [[medical condition]] that started before a person's [[Health benefits (insurance)|health benefits]] went into effect. Before 2014 some insurance policies would not cover expenses due to pre-existing conditions. These exclusions by the [[insurance industry]] were meant to cope with [[adverse selection]] by potential customers. Such exclusions have been prohibited since January 1, 2014, by the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]].

According to the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]], more than a quarter of adults below the age of 65 (approximately 52 million people) had pre-existing conditions in 2016.

== Definitions ==

The [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]] defines a pre-existing condition as a "medical condition that occurred before a program of health benefits went into effect".&lt;ref name="UPMC"/&gt; J. James Rohack, president of the [[American Medical Association]], has stated on a ''[[Fox News Sunday]]'' interview that exclusions, based upon these conditions, function as a form of "[[Healthcare rationing in the United States|rationing]]" of health care.&lt;ref name="jacobson"/&gt;

Conditions can be broken down into two further categories, according to Lisa Smith of [[Investopedia]]:&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;

{{ quote
| Most insurance companies use one of two definitions to identify such conditions. Under the "objective standard" definition, a pre-existing condition is any condition for which the patient has already received medical advice or treatment prior to enrollment in a new medical insurance plan. Under the broader, "prudent person" definition, a pre-existing condition is anything for which symptoms were present and a prudent person would have sought treatment.
}}

Which definition may be used was sometimes regulated by state laws. Some states required insurance companies to use the objective standard, while others required the prudent person standard. 10 states did not specify either definition, 21 required the "prudent person" standard, and 18 required the "objective" standard.&lt;ref name="statehealthfacts"/&gt;

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, more than a quarter of adults below the age of 65 (approximately 52 million people) had pre-existing conditions in 2016.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/10/11/656503264/fact-check-whos-right-about-protections-for-pre-existing-conditions|title=FACT CHECK: Who's Right About Protections For Pre-Existing Conditions?|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en|date=October 11, 2018|author=Julie Rovner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Former regulation ==

Regulation of pre-existing condition exclusions in individual (non-group) and small group (2 to 50 employees) health insurance plans in the [[United States]] was left to individual [[U.S. state]]s as a result of the [[McCarran–Ferguson Act]] of 1945 which delegated insurance regulation to the states and the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] of 1974 (ERISA) which exempted self-insured large group health insurance plans from state regulation. After most states had by the early 1990s implemented some limits on pre-existing condition exclusions by small group (2 to 50 employees) health insurance plans, the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] ([[Nancy Landon Kassebaum|Kassebaum]]-[[Ted Kennedy|Kennedy]] Act) of 1996 (HIPAA) extended some minimal limits on pre-existing condition exclusions for ''all'' group health insurance plans—including the self-insured large group health insurance plans that cover half of those with employer-provided health insurance but are exempt from state insurance regulation.&lt;ref name="kassebaum-kennedy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kassebaum-kennedy-2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="atchkinson-fox"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nicholls-blumberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pollitz-tapay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gabel-jensen"/&gt;

Pre-existing condition exclusions were prohibited for HIPAA-eligible individuals (those with 18 months continuous coverage unbroken for more than 63 days and coming from a group health insurance plan).

Individual (non-group) health insurance plans could exclude maternity coverage for a pre-existing condition of pregnancy.&lt;ref name="jacobson" /&gt;

Group health insurance plans sponsored by employers with 15 or more employees were prohibited by the [[pregnancy discrimination|Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978]] from excluding maternity coverage for a pre-existing condition of pregnancy; this prohibition was extended to all group health insurance plans by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).&lt;ref name="jacobson" /&gt;

== Practice and effect ==

Advocates against pre-existing condition rules argue that they cruelly deny people in need of treatment. [[State Farm]] spokeswoman K.C. Eynatten has said, "We realized our position was based on gut feelings, not hard numbers... we became aware that we were part of the reason a woman and her children might not leave an abuser. They were afraid they'd lose their insurance. And we wanted no part of that."&lt;ref name="grim" /&gt; Jerry Flanagan, health-care policy director of [[Consumer Watchdog]], has stated that "insurance companies want premiums without any risk" and go to extreme "lengths... to go to make a profit".&lt;ref name="hilzenrath" /&gt; InsureMe, an insurance quote provider website, has argued that even though health insurance is basically to protect people from very high costs of health care, the commercial health insurance system is not playing fair and are always trying to avoid risk in order to boost their profits.&lt;ref name="allinsuranceinfo"/&gt;

Some practices by some [[health insurance]] companies, such as determining [[domestic violence]] to be an excludable pre-existing condition, have been called abuses by Maria Tchijov, a [[Service Employees International Union]] new media coordinator, and by an [[Office of Rural Health Policy]] report.&lt;ref name="grim"/&gt;&lt;ref name="johnson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tchijov"/&gt;

The rationale behind pre-existing condition clauses, according to those who defend the policies, is that they reduce the cost of health insurance coverage for those who still receive it, thus giving more people an opportunity to afford insurance in the first place.&lt;ref name="grim" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chronicle"/&gt; The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' has reported that "[c]osts for those with coverage could go up because people in poor health who'd been shut out of the insurance pool would now be included... they would get medical care they could not access before."&lt;ref name="chronicle" /&gt; [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Mike Enzi]], a [[Republican Party (U.S.)|Republican]] from [[Wyoming]], has voted to allow insurance companies to consider domestic violence as a pre-existing condition and supported his vote by saying that covering such people could raise insurance premiums to the point where it would preclude others from buying it. He has remarked that "If you have no insurance, it doesn't matter what services are mandated by the state".&lt;ref name="grim"/&gt;&lt;ref name="alonso-zaldivar"/&gt;

According to the California-based advocacy group [[Consumer Watchdog]], other possible situations falling under pre-existing condition clauses are chronic conditions as [[acne]], [[hemorrhoids]], [[toenail fungus]], [[allergies]], [[tonsillitis]], and [[bunion]]s, hazardous occupations such as [[police officer]], [[Stunt actor|stunt person]], [[test pilot]], [[Circus skills|circus worker]], and [[firefighter]], and [[pregnancy]] and/or [[Adoption|the intention to adopt]].&lt;ref name="hilzenrath"/&gt;

== Commentary by lawmakers ==

According to a [[Reason (magazine)|Reason.com]] [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] opinion blog by Peter Suderman, the '[[Pledge to America]]' issued by the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] in September 2010 stated, "Health care should be accessible for all, regardless of pre-existing conditions or past illnesses.... We will make it illegal for an insurance company to deny coverage to someone with prior coverage on the basis of a pre-existing condition."&lt;ref name="pledge"/&gt; In a March 3, 2010, address, President [[Barack Obama]] said that coverage denied to those with pre-existing conditions is a serious problem that would only grow worse without major reforms.&lt;ref name="marketwatch"/&gt; In a September 2010 visit with [[Falls Church, Virginia]], residents, Obama referred to a woman with an eye condition and a woman with [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]] as personal examples in the audience of those benefiting from changing pre-existing condition rules.&lt;ref name="aizenman-kornblut"/&gt;

== Public opinion ==

A ''[[Time Magazine]]''-Abt SRBI poll in late July 2009 found that a large majority of Americans (80%) favored a requirement that insurance companies insure people even if they suffer from pre-existing conditions.&lt;ref name="Abt SRBI" /&gt;

In September 2009, the monthly [[Kaiser Family Foundation|Kaiser Health Tracking Poll]] report said:&lt;ref name="KFF tracking poll" /&gt;

{{quote
| The public’s most unanimous and bipartisan support is saved for a proposal to have the federal government require that health insurance companies cover anyone who applies, even if he/she has a pre-existing condition. Overall, eight in ten back the proposal, including 67 percent of Republicans, 80 percent of political independents and 88 percent of Democrats.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4317">'''Prince Dance Group''', a [[dance troupe]] based in [[Berhampur]], [[Orissa, India]] led by T. Krishna Mohan Reddy. It has won a reality show [[India's Got Talent]] on an Indian TV channel "Colors" [[Colors (India TV channel)]]. The group is unique that the members are from a remote part of India and most of them are from disadvantaged sections of different parts of Ganjam district. Two of them, Padmanabha Sahu (24) and Telu Tarini (13) are physically challenged.&lt;ref name="TOI"/&gt; They have won the hearts of all Oriyas, including chief minister Naveen Patnaik, and even outsiders with their performance in the programme "[[India's Got Talent]]". Prince Group also performed in Sardotsav- annual winter festival in [[Pithoragarh]] ([[Uttarakhand]]) on 6 November 2014.

==The group==
After winning Rs 50 [[Indian numbering system|lakh]] (Rs five million) prize money and a [[audi]] car from the Colors channel, a pleasant surprise lay in store for them. The Orissa government announced a cash prize of Rs two [[Indian numbering system|crore]] (Rs twenty million) and four acres of land for the group to build a dance academy.

Confirming the news, Krishna Mohan Reddy, the choreographer of Prince Dance Group said, "We have heard that our government has announced a prize for us. We feel honoured. I am very happy that our efforts have paid off."

The group, which is from [[Berhampur]], [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], consists of 20 members. Krishna leads the team and the rest are labourers from a construction site. It was their Krishna act which earned the group accolades from the viewers nationwide and they also became a favourite with the judges.

Commenting on their future plans, Krishna added, “I am a choreographer and want to grow in this profession. With the land provided to us by the government I want to build a dance academy and take this art forward. I would also want to perform on an international platform.”

==India's Got Talent==
The group did an astonishing performance depicting Lord Krishna and his avatars that got good comments from all the three judges. Shekhar Kapoor was mesmerised by their performance. In their semi-final act on 15 August, they depicted the Indian Flag. The special act in which two of the group's  challenged students also performed moved the judges to tears. The audience became so involved in the act that they started chanting "Bharat mata ki jay", after the performance was over.

==World's Got Talent==
Prince Group performed in Sardotsav- annual winter festival in [[Pithoragarh]] (Uttarakhand) on 06 November 2014.
The Prince dance group will, in all probability, represent India at the global stage in the first [[World's Got Talent]] contest, which will see them competing with the 25 winners from various [[Got Talent series]] of different countries. This would be the world's biggest reality TV talent show with a proposed prize money of £1 million and an intended airdate of 2011 with [[UK]] serving as the venue.&lt;ref name="WGT"/&gt;

'''Ruzicka Goerz Anton syndrome''' is a rare genetic disease described by Ruzicka et al. in 1981. It is characterized by [[icthyosis]] (rough, scaly skin), deafness, [[intellectual disability]], and skeletal anomalies.&lt;ref name="orphan"&gt;{{cite web| title=Ruzicka Goerz Anton syndrome| publisher=Check Orphan| accessdate=2011-09-02| url=http://checkorphan.getreelhealth.com/disease/ruzicka-goerz-anton-syndrome}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| language=Finnish| title=Ruzicka-Goerz-Anton syndrome| publisher=Mental Retardation Service Database| accessdate=2011-09-01| url=http://www.saunalahti.fi/kup/syndrome/ruzicka.html| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120913072912/http://www.saunalahti.fi/kup/syndrome/ruzicka.html| archivedate=2012-09-13| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also known as "Ichthyosis deafness intellectual disability skeletal anomalies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=National Library of Medicine| title=Ruzicka Goerz Anton syndrome| accessdate=2011-09-02| url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/mesh/2011/MB_cgi?mode=&amp;index=206549| date=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
The primary symptoms of Ruzicka Goerz Anton syndrome include ichthyosis, deafness, [[intellectual disability|oligophrenia]], and skeletal deformities.&lt;ref name="orphan"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
{{Empty section|date=August 2017}}

==Treatment==
Therapy with Ro 10-9359, a [[retinoid]] derivative, results in improvement of the ichthyosis portion of the syndrome.&lt;ref name="dermatologica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Dermatologica| title=Oral retinoid (Ro 10-9359) in children with lamellar ichthyosis, epidermolytic hyperkeratosis and symmetrical progressive erythrokeratoderma| last1=Tamayo| first1=L.| last2=Ruiz-Maldonado| first2=R.| year=1980| pages=305–314| pmid=    6449393| volume=161| issue=5| doi=10.1159/000250382}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
In 1981, a case was studied by Ruzicka et al. of a 15-year-old girl. The patient had ichthyosis congenita as well as deafness and retarded mental development. Further studies showed several skeletal deformities including [[brachydactyly]], [[clinodactyly]], and extra ribs. One year earlier, the patient had developed [[thyroid neoplasm|thyroid carcinoma]], but whether or not this is due to the syndrome is unknown. The patient was treated with an oral retinoid, which greatly improved the patient's ichthyosis.&lt;ref name="dermatologica"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ruzicka T, Goerz G, Anton-Lamprecht I |title=Syndrome of ichthyosis congenita, neurosensory deafness, oligophrenia, dental aplasia, brachydactyly, clinodactyly, accessory cervical ribs and carcinoma of the thyroid |journal=Dermatologica |volume=162 |issue=2 |pages=124–36 |year=1981 |pmid=7250456 |doi= 10.1159/000250259|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>I added a reference to a book that discusses the concept of fulfillment.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5553">In philosophy and psychology, '''self-fulfillment''' is the realizing of one's deepest desires and capacities. The history of this concept can be traced to [[Ancient Greek]] philosophers and it still remains a notable concept in modern philosophy.

==Definition and history==
Philosopher [[Alan Gewirth]] in his book ''Self-Fulfillment'' defined self-fulfillment as "carrying to fruition one's deepest desires or one's worthiest capacities."&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt; Another definition states that self-fulfillment is "the attainment of a satisfying and worthwhile life well lived."&lt;ref name="Kerr2009"/&gt; It is an [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] that can be traced to [[Ancient Greek]] philosophers, and one that has been common and popular in both Western and non-Western cultures.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt; Self-fulfillment is often seen as superior to other values and goals.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt;

Gewirth notes that "to seek for a good human life is to seek for self-fulfillment".&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt; However, in modern philosophy, the ideal of self-fulfillment has become less popular, criticized by thinkers such as [[Hobbes]] and [[Freud]], who feel there are conceptual and moral problems associated with it.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt; It has been called an [[Egotism|egoistic]] concept, impossible to achieve, with some suggesting that it is an obsolete concept that should be abandoned.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt;  Moral philosophers focus less on obtaining a good life, and more on interpersonal relations and duties owed to others.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt;  Similarly, whereas [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] saw the goal of the [[polis]] in providing a means of self-fulfillment to citizens, modern governments have given up on that, focusing rather on maintaining [[civic order]].&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt; Despite the criticism, the concept of self-fulfillment still persists in modern philosophy, its usefulness defended by thinkers such as Gewirth himself.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-3-5"/&gt;

Gewirth noted that the term self-fulfillment has two near [[synonyms]]: [[self-realization]] and [[self-actualization]], used respectively by philosophers and humanist psychologists, whereas the term self-fulfillment is more commonly used outside those expert fields.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-6-8"/&gt; Gewirth however argues that this concept is sufficiently different from those others to merit not being used as a synonym.&lt;ref name="Gewirth2009-6-8"/&gt; Self-actualization in particular, often discussed in the context of [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]], is frequently defined as the "need for self-fulfillment".&lt;ref name="ReeceBrandt2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PastorinoDoyle-Portillo2012"/&gt;

Dr. Ben Carvosso in his book ''Life CEO - Take Charge, and start doing your life's work, not your busy work'' discussed the prevalence of individuals who's lives are busy, full but unfulfilled. Individuals who's lives are unfulfilled because something is missing and who come to the mistaken conclusion (driven by cleaver marketing by big corporations) that the solution is work harder and make more money to somehow make more time. Self-fulfillment comes from knowing what you really want, not what society says you should want.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1041112060|title=Life CEO : take charge and start doing your life's work not your busy work|last=Ben,|first=Carvosso,|isbn=9780648216704|location=[place of publication not identified]|oclc=1041112060}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its only when we connect with what we really want that we experience true joy or [[Eudaimonia]].

Self-fulfillment has been positively connected to [[altruism]].&lt;ref name="Kerr2009"/&gt;

'''Suicide in Iran''' is believed to be a growing concern in recent years. Iran rates third highest among [[Islamic countries]].&lt;ref name="euronews"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://persian.euronews.com/2015/09/18/iran-suicide/ | title=Suicide crisis in Iran | publisher=[[Euronews]] | date=September 18, 2015 | access-date=March 30, 2016 | author=Pante'aa Bahraami}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to statistics, each day more than 13 people take their lives by suicide in Iran; most of whom are aged 15–35.&lt;ref name="bbcmahjoob"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.bbc.com/persian/iran/2016/03/160303_nm_commit_suicide | title=Why do Iranian youths commit suicide? | publisher=[[BBC Persian Television]] | date=March 4, 2016 | access-date=March 30, 2016 | author=Niki Mahboob}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies also show that in 2013, for instance, the average rate of suicide in Iran (pop. 77.45 million&lt;ref&gt;http://www.livepopulation.com/country/iran.html&lt;/ref&gt;) was 6 in every 100,000 people.&lt;ref name="bbcmahjoob"/&gt;

Economic problems, [[mental illness]]es, cultural obligations, political issues and social pressures are the major factors for suicide commission in Iran.&lt;ref name="magetemad"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://magiran.com/n2542526|title=Reasons and motivations of suicide in Islamic Republic of Iran | publisher=E'temad Newspaper | date=July 17, 2012 | access-date=March 30, 2016 | author=Said Kharratha| page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zamaneh"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.radiozamaneh.com/265322 | title=A review of statistics and estimations of suicide and its other related factors in Iran | publisher=[[Radio Zamaneh]] | date=March 14, 2015 | access-date=March 30, 2016 | author=Mahmood Sabaahi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
The word "suicide" in Persian dictionaries like [[Moeen Encyclopedic Dictionary|Moeen]], [[Dehkhoda Dictionary|Dehkhoda]], and [[Amid dictionary|Amid]], has been defined as "killing self by any means".{{sfn | Fooladi | 2002 | p=15}} The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] records the first use of the word "suicide" by [[Walter Charleton]] in 1651.{{sfn | Shneidman | Leenaars | 1999 | p=178}}
Apparently the word ''suicide'' in [[French language|French]] was used by [[Pierre Desfontaines]] for the first time. Later, this word was accepted by the [[French Academy of Sciences]].{{sfn | Eslaminasab | Taghvaei | 1992 | p=73}} Ali EslamiNasab, considers the combination of two Latin words ''sui'' (self={{lang-fa|خود}}) and ''cide'' (killing=Persian: کُشی) a correct term for ''suicide'' (self-killing=Persian: خودکشی ''khudkushi'').{{sfn | Eslaminasab | Taghvaei | 1992 | p=73}} The concept of suicide in the [[Moaser Persian Dictionary]] is defined as "the intentional termination of life by one's own intention and own hands".{{sfn | Azar | Noohi | Shafiei | 2010 | p=11}}

The first [[Sociology|sociological]] analysis of suicide has been put forward by the French sociologist, [[Émile Durkheim]]. He states in his 1897 book ''[[suicide (book)|suicide]]'' that "suicide is any type of death which is a direct or indirect cause of the victim's own positive or negative acts that he/she was aware of in advance".{{sfn | Anbari | Bahrami | 2010 | p=4}} Durkheim categorized suicides into the following four types all of which are related to the relationship of the individual to [[society]]: 1- ''Egoistic suicide'' that is the cause of [[individualism]] and the separation from the society. 2- ''[[Altruistic suicide]]'' that occurs when the individual has a deep attachment to the society. 3- ''Anomic suicide'' which is the cause of [[anomie]] and lawlessness in the society. 4- ''Fatalistic suicide'' that occurs when the wills, emotions and incentives of the members of the society is under the restrict control of the society.{{sfn | Anbari | Bahrami | 2010 | p=5}}

In the late 19th century, [[Sigmund Freud]] was the first to review suicide from a psychological point of view. He considered suicide as "the ultimate anger towards self caused by the unconscious". Freud, divided human instincts into two categories: death instinct ([[Thanatos]]) and life instinct ([[Eros (concept)|Eros]]). He believed that the death instinct starts immediately after birth and intends to return in the future. This instinct is the cause of extinction, grudge, and termination of generation (reproduction). On the other hand, the life instinct is the cause of friendship, love, reproduction.{{sfn | Fooladi | 2002 | p=13}} Gradually, Freud developed his theory of death instinct, which is in opposition to [[libido]].{{sfn | Azar | Noohi | 2010 | p=27}}

[[Erwin Stengel]] is the first person to differentiate between suicide and suicide intention from a [[Psychology|psychological]] point of view. After some research, he dedicated an independent branch of psychology to the suicide intention.{{sfn | Eslaminasab | Taghvaei | 1992 | p=74}} Research has suggested that unlike suicide the intention of suicide has other goals than just simple "[[Death|self destruction]]". Kayral has mentioned the following four goals of suicide intention: 1- an invitation or asking for help and support; 2- a reaction to a disaster or an unexpected catastrophe; 3- abusing or threatening of others and 4- an escape from a harsh situation.{{sfn | Eslaminasab | Taghvaei | 1992 | p=75}} According to Eslaminasab, the following five behaviors of [[Suicidal ideation|suicide ideation]], threatening to commit suicide, suicide gesture ([[self-harm|harming oneself]]), [[suicide attempt]] and successful suicide, are categorized under suicidal behavior.{{sfn | Eslaminasab | Taghvaei | 1992 | p=76}}

The term "[[suicidology]]" became prevalent in the 1960s. It was first used in 1929 by the Dutch scientist, W. A. Bonger. Suicidology is the scientific study of suicide and its different aspects.{{sfn | Shneidman | Leenaars | 1999 | p=179}}{{sfn | Fooladi | 2002 | p=13}}

== Statistics ==

According to the field research questionnaires given to the suicidal patients referred to Loghman Hospital from 1970 to 1972, family-related issues, with a prevalence of 56%, were the most important reasons of committing suicide. (Table 1). In this study, family-related issues consisted of conflicts between married couples and their parents, and also improper interpersonal relations between parents and their children or other siblings with each other. Such issues started from the ages of 15 to 19 and were most frequent among 20- to 24-year-olds. These two age periods combined were the cause of 56% of total suicides related to family issues.

[[Iranian women]] are more vulnerable to suicide than other groups in the society. In 2007, Iran ranked the third country in which women were outnumbering men in committing suicide.&lt;ref name="dwdrei"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.dw.com/fa-ir/خودکشی-زنان-در-ایران-رتبه-سوم-جهان/a-2775795 | title=Women's suicide in Iran: the third rank in the world | publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] | date=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Age ===

==== Children and teenagers ====
Based on Iranian statistics, from 1984 to 1993, nearly 1,500 deaths attributed to suicide of 27,000 deaths among children and teenagers were recorded annually. Teens from 13 to 17 years of age committed most of these suicides and the suicide rate among boys was four times that of girls.{{sfn | Jalili| p=122}} The total number of suicides from 1994 to 2001, were 4,250 which showed a large increase from the last mentioned period of time.

According to suicide statistics of 2013, which were the most recent until July 2015, 54% of all suicides in Iran were committed by people aged under 30.&lt;ref name="euronews"/&gt;

A [[longitudinal study]] done on students from 2003 to 2008, showed that [[Suicide methods#hanging|hanging]] was the most chosen method and [[Suicide methods#wrist cutting|wrist cutting]] was the least chosen method of suicide. According to this study, single male students aged 22 who were studying [[Humanities]] in the [[Islamic Azad University]], had a higher incidence of suicide than any other group.

=== Poisoning ===
[[File:Αυτοκτονία με την λήψη φαρμάκου-δηλητηρίου.jpg|230px|thumb|right|Drug overdose is the most common method of suicide in Iran. (Image is for illustration purpose only).]]
A 2006 study conducted by Ghoreyshi and Mousavi Nasab,&lt;ref name="ghoreyshimousavinasab"&gt;{{cite web | title= A systematic review on suicide and suicide-related acts in Iran | website=ensan.ir | url=http://ensani.ir/fa/content/229568/default.aspx | language=fa | accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that 55.8% of the population of 3,477 chose [[drug overdose]] as the most favorite method with the median of 55.8% of the total population.&lt;ref name="ghoreyshimousavinasab"/&gt;

In a [[meta-analysis]] study on other studies done until April 2012, Bidel and others found out that from all methods of poisoning drug overdose with 75%, and other [[poison]]s (including agricultural and domestic [[pesticide]]s) with 13%, had the most prevalence among suicides.&lt;ref name="bidel261"&gt;{{cite web | title=magiran.com: An estimation of the most chosen method of poisoning by suicides in Iran: A meta-analytical and longitudinal study | website=magiran.com | url=http://www.magiran.com/view.asp?Type=pdf&amp;ID=1104595 | language=fa | accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this study, provinces of [[Golestan Province|Golestan]] (90%), [[Markazi Province|Markazi]] (89%), [[Razavi Khorasan Province|Razavi Khorasan]] (88%) and [[Hormozgan Province|Hormozgan]] (88%) respectively, ranked the highest in suicide with drug overdose and provinces of [[Ilam Province|Ilam]] (25%), [[Bushehr Province|Bushehr]] (21%) and [[East Azerbaijan Province|East Azerbaijan]] (20%) respectively, ranked the highest in suicide with other types of poisons.&lt;ref name="bidel261"/&gt; According to Bidel and others, the reason behind Ilam's high incidences of suicide with agricultural pesticides is because such substances are easily accessible in this province.&lt;ref name="bidel261"/&gt;

=== Self-immolation ===
According to a 2001 report by the medical jurisprudence organization of Iran, [[self-immolation]] has been the most chosen method of suicide among women with 69.29% prevalence. This report also states that the highest rate of self-immolation as a method of suicide among men was from [[Yazd Province]] with 47% prevalence and the highest suicide rate with this method for women was recorded in Bushehr province with 94.4% prevalence.&lt;ref name="rezaianandsharifirad"&gt;{{cite web | title= Self-immolation, the most important method of suicide in Ilam Province | website=Ensani.ir | url=http://ensani.ir/fa/content/229497/default.aspx | language=fa | accessdate=2016-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a meta-analysis study consisted of 19 studies with a population of 22,498 suicide cases until 2012, Nazarzade and others have concluded that generally speaking, from all physical methods of suicide, self-immolation, with a prevalence of 13%, is the most chosen method of suicide in Iran.&lt;ref name="nazarzadehandothers"&gt;{{cite web | title= Determining the prevalence of the physical methods of suicide in Iran: A structural and meta-analytical review | website=magiran.com | url=http://www.magiran.com/view.asp?Type=pdf&amp;ID=1138721 | language=fa | accessdate=2016-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also found that the provinces of [[Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province|Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad]] (48%), Ilam (28%) and [[South Khorasan Province|South Khorasan]] (10%), respectively, ranked the highest rates for self-immolation as a method of killing oneself.&lt;ref name="nazarzadehandothers"/&gt; According to Nazarzade and others, although suicide by this method in Iran occurs less than in other countries like [[India]] (40%), [[Sri Lanka]] (24%) and [[Egypt]] (17%), the prevalence of this method in Iran is more than some [[Africa|African countries]] like [[Zimbabwe]] (11%) and [[South Africa]] and also some [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe|European countries]] like [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="nazarzadehandothers"/&gt; Their report states that in general and except for poisoning, Iranian men and women tend to use violent methods like self-immolation, hanging and shooting with firearms for their suicide. The prevalence of these types of methods is higher in western and south-eastern provinces of the country.&lt;ref name="nazarzadehandothers"/&gt;

=== Hanging ===

Based on a 2001 report from the Medical Jurisprudence Organization of Iran, [[hanging]], with the prevalence of 56.5%, was the most important method of suicide among men.&lt;ref name="rezaianandsharifirad"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nazarzadehandothers"/&gt;

According to Nazarzade and others, based on a meta-analytical study of other studies conducted during the 1990s and 2000s, (excluding the studies that solely covered successful suicides), with a population of 22,468 cases of attempted suicides, the prevalence of hanging was only 2%. Based on this study, [[Kermanshah Province]], in 2005 had the highest rate of hanging (17%) and Golestan Province, in 2002, had the lowest rate of hanging (1%).&lt;ref name="nazarzadehandothers"/&gt; Also, suicide by hanging in Iran occurs less than in [[Western countries|western]] and [[Asian countries]].&lt;ref name="nazarzadehandothers"/&gt;

The table on the right, shows the frequency of methods used in '''successful suicides''' that were referred to the Medical Jurisprudence Organization of Iran in the first half of 2004.{{sfn | Shirzad | Gharrahdaghi | p=167}} According to this data, the most chosen method of suicide among both women and men in Iran was hanging. (Population= 180 men and 80 women). Among Iranian men who committed suicide, hanging (57%) and poisoning (17%) respectively, were the most important method and for women, poisoning and self-immolation were the most chosen method, with a prevalence nearly alike each other.{{sfn | Shirzad | Gharrahdaghi | p=168}}

=== Firearms ===
[[File:Suicide in Iran by gun in 2000, compared to other countries.png|300px|thumb|right|The diagram of prevalence of suicide by firearms in Iran in comparison with other countries whose statistics were available (per 100,000 people)&lt;ref name="khademi"/&gt;]]
According to Khademi and others, due to limitations of accessing and using [[firearm]]s in Iran, suicide by this method, in comparison with other methods such as poisoning, self-immolation and hanging is less favorable.&lt;ref name="khademi"&gt;{{cite web | last=Ali | first=Khademi | last2=Sa'dolah | first2=Moradi | last3=Ghasem | first3=Soleymani | title=Analytical review of suicide by firearm in Iran | website=SID.ir | volume=10 | issue=34 | url=http://fa.journals.sid.ir/ViewPaper.aspx?id=28241 | language=fa | accessdate=2016-06-19 | pages=80–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the data available from the Medical Jurisprudence Organization of Iran, in 2001, 8% of successful suicides involved a type of firearm (269 persons) and in total, the prevalence of this method was 0.42 in every 100,000 people.&lt;ref name="khademi"/&gt; In the same year, the men's suicide rate with this method was 91.4% whereas that of the women was only 8.6%.&lt;ref name="khademi"/&gt; Notably, 62% of suicides by shooting occurred in military locations. According to Khademi and others, the subject of suicide by firearms among [[Military service#Iran|conscripted soldier]]s in Iran is problematic and needs to be paid special attention.&lt;ref name="khademi"/&gt;

Based on statistics from 2001, the provinces of Kermanshah, Ilam and [[Lorestan Province|Lorestan]], respectively with 1.71, 1.67 and 1.63 suicides by firearm in every 100,000 people, ranked the highest and the provinces of [[Qom Province|Qom]], [[Zanjan Province|Zanjan]] and [[Mazandaran Province|Mazandaran]], respectively with 0, 0 and 0.07 suicides by firearm in every 100,000 people, ranked the lowest. Khademi and others attribute the high level of suicide by shooting in western and eastern provinces to [[arms trafficking]] and the fact that in those provinces people have easier access to weapons and tools used lethally than do those in other provinces.&lt;ref name="khademi"/&gt;

=== Tehran Metro ===
In Iran, like other countries, [[Methods of suicide#Vehicular impact|suicide by train]] occurs. According to authorities, on average, each month one person kills themselve by jumping on [[Tehran Metro|Tehran's subway]] railway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=|url=http://www.donya-e-eqtesad.com/news/840657/|title=Season of suicide in Metro|publisher=Donya-e Eqtesad|date=November 13, 2014|access-date=March 4, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304185655/http://www.donya-e-eqtesad.com/news/840657/|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, on May 15, 2015, a 35-year-old man after throwing himself under a subway train at Moniryeh Station, was injured and brought to hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author= |url= http://www.seratnews.ir/fa/news/241942/خودکشی-مرد-35ساله-در-مترو-تهران |title= Suicide of a 35-year-old man in Tehran Metro | publisher= Serat News |date=  May 15, 2015|access-date= March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 16, 2016, a young lady committed suicide in Darvazeh Dolat Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author= |url= http://www.tabnak.ir/fa/news/561236/|title= Suicide of a 26-year-old lady in Tehran Metro | publisher= Tabnak|date= January 16, 2016 |access-date=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the revolution, [[Milad Tower]], which had become the highest building, attracted those who wanted to kill themselves by jumping. At least three successful suicides by jumping from the roof of Milad Tower have been reported.&lt;ref name="Parsin News"/&gt;

=== Legislative ===
{{main article|Suicide in law}}
The act of suicide has not been criminalized in the [[Judicial system of Iran|penal law of the Islamic Republic of Iran]].&lt;ref name="firoozmand56"&gt;{{cite web | title=Freewill termination: A look into psychological and legislative aspects of suicide in Iran | website=magiran.com | url=http://www.magiran.com/view.asp?Type=pdf&amp;ID=1017038 | language=fa | access-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no one is permitted to ask another to kill them.&lt;ref name="firoozmand56"/&gt; In addition, threatening to kill oneself is not an offense under the law, however, if this act of threatening is made by a prisoner inside a [[prison]], then that would be considered a violation of prison regulations and the offender may be punished according to penal law.&lt;ref name="firoozmand56"/&gt;

According to the Act. 836 of the [[Judicial system of Iran|civil law of the Islamic Republic of Iran]] if a [[suicidal person]] prepares for suicide and writes a [[Will and testament|testament]], if he/she dies, then by law the will is considered void and if he/she doesn't die, then the will is officially accepted and can be carried out.&lt;ref name="tabnak"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tabnak.ir/fa/news/530947/نگاهی-به-خودکشی-از-زاویه-قانونی | title=Suicide from the point of view of law | publisher=[[Mohsen Rezaee|Tabnak News Agency]] | date=September 12, 2015 | access-date=June 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the theory of "borrowed crime", because suicide itself is not a crime in penal law, thus any type of assisting in an individual's suicide is not considered a crime and the assistant is not punishable.&lt;ref name="ettelaat"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ettelaat.com/etiran/?p=35136 | title=Suicide in law and fiqh | publisher=[[Ettela'at]] | date= December 29, 2013 | access-date=June 5, 2016 | author=Amir Sharifi Khezarati}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Assisted suicide|Assisting a suicide]] is considered a crime only when it becomes the "'''cause'''" of the suicidal person's death; for example when someone takes advantage of someone else's unawareness or simplicity and convinces him/her to kill him/herself. In such cases assisting a suicide is treated as [[murder]] and the offender is punished accordingly.&lt;ref name="firoozmand56"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ettelaat"/&gt; In addition, assisting a suicide is considered a crime under section 2 of Act. 15 of [[Judicial system of Iran|the cyber crimes law of the Islamic Republic of Iran]] which was legislated on June 15, 2009. According to the act, any type of encouragement, stimulation, invitation, simplification of access to lethal substances and/or methods and teaching of suicide with the help of [[computer]] or any other media network is considered assisting in suicide and, thus, is punished by imprisonment from 91 days up to 1 year or fines from 5 to 20 million [[Iranian rial]]s or both.&lt;ref name="firoozmand56"/&gt;

=== Philosophical ===

=== Religious ===
In Iran it's said by the religious figures that according to the Islamic texts, suicide is a sin, because it would be unthankful of the blessings that God (Allah) has given them.

=== Cultural ===
While suicide is portrayed and discussed in many Iranian classic art works and literature, speaking of it among people is seen as more or less of a taboo. The cases of suicide among people are thought of with both sympathy for the victim and a sense of disdain or shame for the family and close friends of the person.

=== Artistic ===

[[Sadegh Hedayat]], a famous contemporary Iranian writer, has used suicide as a theme in some of his stories such as "Buried alive", "Parvin, daughter of Sasan" and "Darkroom".&lt;ref name="nazaridoost160"&gt;{{پک|نذری‌دوست|بهنوش|۱۳۸۹|ک=خودکشی در آثار صادق هدایت و گیدو موپسان|ص=۱۶۰}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the short story, "Buried alive", the narrator of the story wants to be far from mankind. He has found life to be a waste, doesn't have any hope to continue and is constantly in search of suicide methods. For him, death is the means of achieving calmness.&lt;ref name="nazaridoost168"&gt;{{پک|نذری‌دوست|بهنوش|۱۳۸۹|ک=خودکشی در آثار صادق هدایت و گیدو موپسان|ص=۱۶۸}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the play, "Parvin, daughter of Sasan", Parvin is in love with Parviz who is fighting [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Arabs]] to stop them conquering [[Rey, Iran|Ray]]. Finally, Parviz is killed and Parvin, who is interested by an Arab General, kills herself hopelessly.&lt;ref name="nazaridoost164"&gt;{{پک|نذری‌دوست|بهنوش|۱۳۸۹|ک=خودکشی در آثار صادق هدایت و گیدو موپسان|ص=۱۶۴}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the short story "Darkroom", the narrator follow-travels with a strange person who does not want to communicate with people and share in their pleasures; instead, he wants to come back to mother's [[Uterus]]. At the end of the story, the narrator finds the strange person's dead body in his oval-shaped jujube-colored room while like a [[Fetus]], his feet are retracted to his stomach.&lt;ref name="nazaridoost166"&gt;{{پک|نذری‌دوست|بهنوش|۱۳۸۹|ک=خودکشی در آثار صادق هدایت و گیدو موپسان|ص=۱۶۶}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nazaridoost167"&gt;{{پک|نذری‌دوست|بهنوش|۱۳۸۹|ک=خودکشی در آثار صادق هدایت و گیدو موپسان|ص=۱۶۷}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Taste of Cherry]]'', a 1997 movie by [[Abbas Kiarostami]] that won the [[Palme d'Or]] of [[Cannes Film Festival]], is about a man named "Badi'ei" who has the intention to kill himself by overdosing and is searching for someone to pour soil on his dead body in grave after his suicide.&lt;ref name="Bradshaw 2012"&gt;{{cite web | last=Bradshaw | first=Peter | title=Curzon on demand: Taste of Cherry | website=the Guardian | date=2012-04-13 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/apr/13/curzon-on-demand-taste-of-cherry | accessdate=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 comparative field study between 156 Iranian students with an average age of 16.5 and 167 [[Sweden|Swedish]] students with an average age of 17,&lt;ref name="sadrolsadat88"&gt;{{پک|Sadrolsadat|Shams Esfandabad|2005|ک=A Comparative Study|ص=88|زبان=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was revealed that Swedish students, in comparison with their Iranian counterparts, had more liberal views towards suicide&lt;ref name="sadrolsadat84"&gt;{{پک|Sadrolsadat|Shams Esfandabad|2005|ک=A Comparative Study|ص=84|زبان=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and considered it a right for any person.&lt;ref name="sadrolsadat91"&gt;{{پک|Sadrolsadat|Shams Esfandabad|2005|ک=A Comparative Study|ص=91|زبان=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the Iranian students believed that no person is allowed to kill him/herself and those who do, if they survive, they should be punished. Also, Swedish students had a higher rate of acceptance for their friends who survived suicide than their Iranian counterparts. In addition, believing in life after death and the punishment of those who die due to suicide, was more common among the Iranian students than the Swedish students.&lt;ref name="sadrolsadat84" /&gt;

'''Uffe Ravnskov''' (born 1934) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] medical doctor, independent researcher, a member of various international scientific organisations, and a former assistant professor and medical practitioner in Denmark and Sweden. In recent years he has gained notoriety for questioning the [[scientific consensus]] regarding the [[lipid hypothesis|Lipid Hypothesis]].

==Early career==
He was born in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], and received his medical doctorate from the [[University of Copenhagen]] in 1961. Over the following seven years, he worked at various [[surgery|surgical]], [[X-ray|roentgenological]], [[Neurology|neurological]], [[pediatrics|paediatric]] and medical departments in Denmark and Sweden. He then began scientific studies at the Departments of [[Nephrology]] and [[Clinical Chemistry]] at the [[Lund University|Lund University Hospital]] in [[Lund]], Sweden. He was awarded his doctorate of philosophy (specialising in internal medicine and nephrology) there in 1973, and was [[professor|assistant professor]] at the university's Department of Nephrology from 1975 to 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Uffe Ravnskov, ''The Cholesterol Myths'', (Washington DC, 2003), p. 307. {{ISBN|0-9670897-0-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ''The Cholesterol Myths'': About the Author|work = www.ravnskov.nu Website|url = http://www.ravnskov.nu/uffe.htm|accessdate = 2006-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Uffe Ravnskov: My life and my work"&gt;{{cite web|title = Uffe Ravnskov: My life and my work|work = www.ravnskov.nu Website|url = http://www.ravnskov.nu/lifeandwork.htm|accessdate = 2006-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An encounter with scientific fraud committed by a colleague ended up changing Ravnskov's career:
{{cquote|In 1977 I discovered that one of my co-workers had falsified part of his PhD thesis. Whistle blowers are not welcome in the academic world. So, instead of excluding the fraudulent researcher it was my research that was questioned. Finally I found the resistance from my superiors intolerable and decided to go into private practice.&lt;ref name="healthmyths.net"&gt;{{cite web|title = Uffe Ravnskov MD, PhD (2005 Interview)|work = Health Myths Publishing Website|url = http://www.healthmyths.net/uffe.html|accessdate = 2006-12-20|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070109000247/http://www.healthmyths.net/uffe.html|archivedate = 2007-01-09|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ravnskov entered private medical practice as a specialist in internal medicine and nephrology in 1979, and worked in Lund in this capacity and as a family doctor until retiring in 2000. Since 1979 he has worked as an independent scientific researcher and since 2000 continues to do so on a full-time basis.&lt;ref name="Uffe Ravnskov: My life and my work"/&gt;

He resides in Lund, Sweden.

==Research in Nephrology==
In his 1973 PhD. thesis, ''On Renal Handling of Serum Proteins'', Ravnskov introduced the [[Serum albumin|albumin]]/[[Creatinine clearance|creatinine]] [[Renal clearance ratio|clearance ratio]], a more accurate way to measure [[proteinuria]].&lt;ref&gt;Ravnskov U., "On renal handling of plasma proteins", ''[[Scandinavian Journal of Urology and Nephrology]]'' 1973; 7 (suppl 20) (Thesis).&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the first to describe the peritubular uptake of low-molecular-weight proteins.&lt;ref name="Uffe Ravnskov: My life and my work"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ravnskov U., Johansson B.G., Göthlin J., "Renal extraction of β2-microglobulin", ''[[Scandinavian Journal of Clinical and Laboratory Investigation]]'' 1972; 30: 71-75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ravnskov U., and Karatson A., "Renal handling of human β2-microglobulin in the rat: The importance of sham-operation", ''[[Acta Physiologica Scandinavica]]'' 1975; 94: 467-471.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ravnskov U., "Serum β2-microglobulin and glomerular function", ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' 1976;294:611.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also proposed a [[theory]] that [[glomerulonephritis]] is primarily a tubulointerstitial disease, supported by his earlier findings that most patients with glomerulonephritis excrete large amounts of tubular proteins&lt;ref&gt;Johansson B.G., Ravnskov U., "The serum level and urinary excretion of a 2-microglobulin, β2-microglobulin and lysozyme in renal disease", ''[[Scandinavian Journal of Urology and Nephrology]]'' 1972; 6: 249-56.&lt;/ref&gt; and tubulospecific enzymes.&lt;ref&gt;Hultberg B., Ravnskov U., "The excretion of N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase in glomerulonephritis", ''[[Clinical Nephrology]]'' 1981; 15: 33-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In experimental studies he demonstrated that the handling of proteins by the [[kidney]]s differs in man and other mammals,&lt;ref&gt;Ravnskov U., Johansson B.G., Ljunger L., "Proteinuria in pigs with experimentally induced renal damage", ''[[Contributions to Nephrology]]'' 1975; 1: 50-61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ravnskov U., Johansson B.G., "Isolation and partial characterization of a porcine low molecular weight protein occurring in plasma and urine", ''[[International Journal of Biochemistry]]'' 1976; 7: 579-583.&lt;/ref&gt; implying that knowledge from animal studies cannot be applied to humans. 

Ravnskov also conducted work on [[Urinary system|urinary tract]] infections; in one study of urinary tract infections in women he found that the major cause of [[dysuria]] was soap, not bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;Ravnskov U., "Soap is the major cause of dysuria", ''[[The Lancet]]'' 1983; 1: 1027-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ravnskov U., "Dysuri kan orsakas av tvål", ''[[Läkartidningen]]'' 1985; 82: 836.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ravnskov U., "Dysuri skyldes som regel sæbe", ''[[Ugeskrift for Læger]]'' 1985; 147: 1493-94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ravnskov U., "Sæbe og dysuri", ''[[Ugeskrift for Læger]]'' 1985; 147: 2093.&lt;/ref&gt;

His major research interest concerns the association between [[hydrocarbon]] exposure and glomerulonephritis; this interest was sparked by a 1975 paper in ''[[The Lancet]]'' by Stephen W. Zimmerman, K. Groehler, and G.J. Beirne,&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman S.W., Groehler K., Beirne G.J., "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=51959&amp;dopt=Abstract Hydrocarbon exposure and chronic glomerulonephritis]", ''[[The Lancet]]'' 1975 Aug 2;2(7927):199-201.&lt;/ref&gt; who found that the large majority of their patients with glomerulonephritis on [[dialysis]] treatment had prior heavy exposure to industrial [[solvent]]s. In his subsequent work in this area, he was the first to demonstrate that a discontinuation of hydrocarbon exposure may improve the course of glomerulonephritis,&lt;ref&gt;Ravnskov U., "Influence of hydrocarbon exposure on the course of glomerulonephritis", ''[[Nephron]]'' 1986; 42: 156-160.&lt;/ref&gt; a finding confirmed by follow-up studies made by British researchers.

==Investigation of the Lipid Hypothesis, or "Diet-Heart" Idea==
When the lipid hypothesis came to be promoted strongly in Sweden Ravnskov felt there was an incongruity between the [[lipid hypothesis|Diet-Heart Idea]] and scientific literature he could recall. In Ravnskov's words,

{{cquote|When the [[cholesterol]] campaign was introduced in Sweden in 1989, I was very surprised. Having followed the scientific literature about cholesterol and [[cardiovascular disease]] superficially for a number of years, I could not recall any study showing that high cholesterol was dangerous to the heart or the blood vessels, or that any type of dietary fat was more beneficial or harmful than another one. I became curious and started to read more systematically.&lt;ref&gt;Uffe Ravnskov, ''The Cholesterol Myths'', (Washington DC, 2003), p. xv (Author's Forward).&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

He reexamined data from past scientific studies, and came to the conclusion that the scientific foundations of the Diet-Heart Idea were scientifically flawed, with what he characterized as all the "inaccuracies, misinterpretations, exaggerations and misleading quotations in this research area."&lt;ref&gt;Uffe Ravnskov, ''The Cholesterol Myths'', (Washington DC, 2003), p. xv. (Author's Forward).&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''Kolesterolmyten'' ("The Cholesterol Myths") was subsequently published in Sweden in 1991 and in [[Finland]] in 1992. It received adverse attention from the local media when they consulted the researchers and health authorities that it criticised; in the 2003 edition of the book, Ravnskov recalls how it was belittled in a television programme on [[Yleisradio|Finland's Channel 2 television station]] and a copy of the book literally [[Book burning|set on fire]].

With the popularisation of the internet in the late 1990s, Ravnskov saw the opportunity to publicize his conclusion and, in 1997, published selected sections of ''The Cholesterol Myths'' on the [[world wide web]].

As a result of this worldwide interest, his book was translated into [[English language|English]] and published in the [[United States]] as ''The Cholesterol Myths: Exposing the Fallacy that Saturated Fat and Cholesterol cause Heart Disease'' in September 2000 by a publishing house established by the head of the [[Weston A. Price Foundation]], [[Sally Fallon]]. It was later published in [[Germany]] in 2002 under the title ''Mythos Cholesterin. Die zehn größten Irrtümer'' ("Cholesterol Myth: The Ten Biggest Errors").

Since 1990, Ravnskov has published over 80 scientific papers critical of the Diet-Heart Idea, proposing new hypotheses and also contending&lt;ref&gt;Ravnskov U., "Quotation bias in reviews of the diet-heart idea", ''[[Journal of Clinical Epidemiology]]'' 1995; 48: 713-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ravnskov U., "Debatt i Science: Kostråd mot hjärtinfarkt försvaras med felcitat", ''[[Läkartidningen]]'' 2002; 99: 2673.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ravnskov U., Allan C., Atrens D., Enig M.G., Groves B., Kaufman J., Kroneld R., Rosch P.J., Rosenman R., Werkö L., Nielsen J.V., Wilske J., Worm N., "Studies of dietary fat and heart disease", ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' 2002; 295: 1464-5.&lt;/ref&gt; that "the successful dissemination of the diet-heart idea is due to authors systematically ignoring or misquoting discordant (contradictory) studies".&lt;ref name="Uffe Ravnskov: My life and my work"/&gt; He was the first to suggest that the positive effect of the [[statin]]s may be due to other effects than cholesterol-lowering.

'''Victor Robert Fuchs''' (born 1924) is an American [[health economist]]. He has been called "the dean of health economists" by ''New York Times'' economics columnist [[David Leonhardt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | last = Leonhardt | first = David | title = Real Choice? It’s Off Limits in Health Bills | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/26/business/economy/26leonhardt.html | work = The New York Times | date = 25 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He is the Henry J. Kaiser, Jr. Professor at Stanford University, emeritus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://healthpolicy.stanford.edu/people/victorrfuchs/ Victor R. Fuchs, Stanford University]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1962, he has been a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research and is the co-director of the FRESH-Thinking Project, CASBS, at Stanford University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fresh-thinking.org/ |title=Fresh Thinking Project |access-date=2009-07-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125095919/http://fresh-thinking.org/ |archive-date=2009-01-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuchs was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amacad.org/multimedia/pdfs/classlist.pdf List of active members by class], October 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and to the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 1990. In 1995, he served as president of the [[American Economic Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Honors | url = http://www.aeaweb.org/honors_awards/officerspast.php | publisher = [[American Economic Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison of healthcare in Canada and US==
Also, Fuchs published a paper, with James S. Hahn, in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' "How Does Canada Do it? – A comparison of Expenditures for Physicians' Services in the United States and Canada." It discusses the differences in the Canadian and US healthcare spending patterns and also discusses why healthcare expenditures are so much higher in the United States.

They found that the higher US expenditures were entirely based on 234% higher fees for services than Canada even though there are more physicians per capita in Canada. That shows that the typical view of Canada saving money by delivering fewer services is false and that the insurance setup, being a [[single-payer system]], is what gives it the edge.&lt;ref name=Canada&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fuchs | first1 = Victor | last2 = Hahn | first2 = James S. | title = How does Canada do it? – A comparison of expenditures for physicians' services in the United States and Canada | journal = [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] | volume = 323 | issue = 13 | pages = 884–890 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199009273231306 | date = 27 September 1990 | url = http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199009273231306#t=article }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences between the United States and Canada on fees, spending, and use are shown. The accentuating difference begins with the disparity in health care coverage. Canada operates under a universal health care system, which covers majority of their residents. On the other hand, the United States operates under a fragmented multi-payer system that fails to provide coverage for many Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | title = Comparing international health care systems | work = PBS Newshour | publisher = PBS | url = https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/health-july-dec09-insurance_10-06 | date = October 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the lack of correspondence between both countries regarding health care coverage validates part of the narrative reported in the study, which concluded that the US spent more on physicians' services than Canada.&lt;ref name=Canada /&gt;

Canada provides more services at lower costs by virtue of negotiated physician fees between physician organizations and the provincial governments as well as other limits placed on spending.&lt;ref name=Pearson&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Folland | first1 = Sherman | last2 = Goodman | first2 = Allen C. | last3 = Stano | first3 = Miron | title = The economics of health and health care | publisher = Pearson Education | location = Essex, England | year = 2014 | edition = 7th | isbn = 9781292020518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the study also suggests that higher expenditures in the US is a function of many factors including higher wages earned by US physicians, the difference of physicians on demand, billing costs, quality of health care, physicians' workload, and superfluous amenities. Notably, the factors bring to question the underlying differences in health care delivery, and the authors reported more general practitioners in Canada per capita.

The limited role of general practitioners in the US compared to Canada may imply that Canadian physicians are "more inclined to recommend additional evaluation and management services."&lt;ref name=Canada /&gt;

The lower quantity of physician services per capita coupled with higher expenditures is an example of the fundamental inefficiencies embedded within the fragmented multipayer health care system in the US.&lt;ref name=Pearson /&gt; Thus, a concerted effort to reform these inefficiencies has been made by the US government, which resulted in the adoption of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], a noteworthy addition to the health care system since the passage of both Medicare and Medicaid in 1965.

The advent of the key legislation is shifting the payment of care in the US from the inefficiencies of fee-for-service to payment models grounded on improved outcomes and lower health care spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Cameron | first = David | title = Moving beyond health care's fee-for-service | work = Harvard Gazette | date = July 11, 2012 | url = http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/07/moving-beyond-health-cares-fee-for-service/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, some of the models reduce costs through a team-based approach known as a [[medical home]], which are often led by a general practitioner.

Furthermore, Congress is currently working on a "permanent doc fix" to control Medicare spending on physician services, also known as the [[Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate]] (SGR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kliff | first = Sarah | title = The Doc-fix is in: Congress actually has a plan to overhaul doctor payments |date = February 7, 2014 | work = [[The Washington Post]] |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/02/07/the-doc-fix-is-in-congress-actually-has-a-plan-to-overhaul-doctor-payments}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the article's publication, important changes in health care policy have taken place, with the potential to resolve the exorbitant expenditures for physicians' services in the US.

Despite many years of concerted efforts and achievements in expanding coverage and improving service sustainability, many issues remain to be addressed in the '''[[water]]''' and '''[[sanitation]]''' sector. Key issues include: (i) a low level of coverage for both water and sanitation, in particular in rural areas; (ii) a low level of cost recovery, despite a legal obligation for tariffs to recover costs; and (iii) an institutional framework that is only partially effective.

== Access ==
While coverage levels in urban areas are high using a broad definition of services, the coverage with higher levels of services (house taps and sewers) remains low compared to demand and to other countries in the region.

== Recent developments ==

In April 2007 a seminar organized by the Center of Multidisciplinary Entrepreneurial Training (CAEM)-TECMA S.A. and financed by the [[Inter-American Development Bank|IDB]] concluded that the Juntas need to improve their management and improve collection of outstanding bills in order to avoid institutional collapse. Otherwise a “domino effect” could occur and jeopardize the financial stability of SENASA as well as the country’s commitments to the World Bank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.com.py/ ABC Color]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibility for water supply and sanitation ==
[[Image:Paraguay-CIA WFB Map.png|thumb|300px|right]]

=== Policy and regulation ===
[[Image:Chaco Boreal Paraguay.jpg|thumb|right|300px|View of El Chaco]]
Responsibility for policy formulation is nominally vested in the Ministry of Public Works and Communications and regulation is entrusted to an autonomous entity, the [http://www.erssan.gov.py/ Regulatory Agency for Sanitation (ERSSAN)]. The institutional framework is codified in Law 1614/00 of 2000 establishing a regulatory and tariff framework for the sector. The law, which created ERSSAN, was drafted with the expectation that private sector participation in the sector would substantially increase, which did not occur.

In practice, the Ministry of Public Works and Communications has not developed sector policies, leaving a vacuum in this important area. The regulatory agency, created for the purpose of regulating prospective private enterprises, has been ineffective at regulating the national public enterprise ESSAP. SENASA also faces many challenges, since it does not have sufficient capacity to provide adequate support to the ever-increasing number of Juntas.

=== Service provision ===

Responsibility for water and sanitation service provision in [[Paraguay]] in urban areas rests primarily with a national public enterprise, and with more than 1,621 community-managed water associations (Juntas de Saneamiento) in small cities and in rural areas.

The national enterprise, the Empresa de Servicios Sanitarios de Paraguay (ESSAP), is responsible for serving communities with populations of more than 10,000 inhabitants. In rural communities and small towns with less than 10,000 inhabitants water associations provide services, while technical assistance and financing are provided by the [http://www.senasa.gov.py/ National Environmental Sanitation Service (SENASA)].

The Juntas are grouped in 10 associations which supply water to more than half of country’s population&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.com.py/ ABC Color]: "Juntas de saneamiento deben mejorar gerenciamiento local para no colapsar." 12 de Abril de 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The first Juntas were created with the assistance of the World Bank’s first rural water and sanitation loan to Paraguay in 1977, fostering a successful long-term partnership that endures until today.

An interesting phenomenon in [[Paraguay]] is the emergence of independent private suppliers, called “aguateros”, since the 1970s. Their efforts account for a significant share of the expansion of urban water coverage in the area of the capital. Aguateros are private, informal service providers who operate small-scale systems with up to 3,000 connections. An estimated 500 private suppliers serve some total of about 500,000 people.

== Tariffs and cost recovery ==

=== Urban areas ===

Urban utility tariffs are set below cost recovery levels and are adjusted infrequently, leading to substantial operating losses by the national water and sanitation enterprise. This makes it impossible to finance the investments necessary to further expand coverage and to improve 
service quality.

Tariffs by Aguateros fully recover costs and compare favorably with tariffs charged by the public sector. These tariffs are not regulated, but to some extent controlled by competition between aguateros serving neighboring areas.

=== Rural areas ===

Unlike in many other countries, local Juntas are well organized and do not only recover operating and maintenance costs, but also expand their systems using their own resources and repay a portion of capital costs to the national treasury.

=== Affordability ===

According to data collected by the [[Pan-American Health Organization]] based on multi-purpose household surveys, the share of water expenditures in household expenditures in urban areas of Paraguay was the lowest among 10 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean in the late 1990s. The share was on average 1.4% and 1.7% for urban households in the poorest income decile, showing an unusually low difference between the average and poor households.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1020-49892002000500013&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en Rangel et al., Public Health 11(5/6), 2002] and especially [http://www.scielosp.org/img/fbpe/rpsp/v11n5-6/10723t3.gif Table on Household Expenditure]&lt;/ref&gt; These shares are actually the same or even higher in rural areas, reflecting the unusual high levels of cost recovery in rural areas in Paraguay. Rural households spend on average 1.2% on water, and households in the poorest decile in rural areas spend 2.3% on water. Therefore, despite high levels of cost recovery, tariffs apparently remain affordable.

== External support ==

=== World Bank ===
As mentioned above, the [[World Bank]]’s relationship with the Government of Paraguay and the SENASA on rural water systems goes back for about 30 years.

As a result, the Bank is one of the institutions most trusted by the Government to assist it in this sector. From 1997 to 2007 the Bank supported the US$ 55.7 million [http://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&amp;piPK=73230&amp;theSitePK=40941&amp;menuPK=228424&amp;Projectid=P039983 Fourth Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project] (approved on August 28, 1997), which aimed at increasing water supply and sanitation coverage in rural areas. A secondary development objective was to modify SENASA’s role in the sector from an implementer of projects to an efficiently managed promoter of activities.

The [[World Bank]] has also supported a pilot project to expand services in small towns by providing subsidies on a competitive basis, which involve “aguateros” as service providers. This experience is summarized in the note entitled Output-Based Aid in Water – Lessons in Implementation from a pilot in Paraguay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rru.worldbank.org/documents/publicpolicyjournal/270-water-paraguay.pdf Output-Based Aid in Water - Lessons in Implementation from a Pilot in Paraguay]&lt;/ref&gt;

The objective of the project is to increase the efficiency, coverage, and sustainability of water supply and sanitation services in Paraguay by (a) improving the governance of the sector, (b) improving water services and increasing access to sewerage services in the Asunción metropolitan area, and (c) increasing access to sustainable water and sanitation services in rural areas.

'''White Cross Orphanage''' is a child caring agency in [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]], [[Philippines]] that provides temporary shelter for children, who are 0–6 years old. Accredited by the [[Department of Social Welfare and Development]] ([[DSWD]]), it gives refuge to children of unwed mothers, indigent families, [[tuberculosis]] patients, mentally or physically-incapacitated parents, prisoners, or victims of incest or rape.&lt;ref name=WhiteCross&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.dot.com.ph/whitecross/ |title = White Cross |last = |first = |publisher = |date = |website = White Cross  |accessdate= 19 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These children are provided with medical assistance, educational care, and financial support to help them in their early years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.aidphilippines.com/2011/06/21/white-cross-childrens-home/|title = White Cross Children’s Home |last = |first = |publisher = Aid Philippines |date = 21 June 2011 |website = Aid Phlippines  |accessdate= 19 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early Beginnings===
In the early 20th century when there was an outbreak of tuberculosis (TB) in the Philippines, the orphanage was established to shelter the children of the TB patients of the Quezon Institute. It was founded by Victoria Lopez de Araneta in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20070423-61854/White-Cross-lady-honored |title = White Cross Lady Honored |last = Agbayani |first = Claire |publisher = Philippine Daily Inquirer |date = 23 April 2007 |website = Inquirer.net  |accessdate= 21 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its founding board members include Mercedes McMicking, Conrado Dayrit, Emmanuel J. Dymek, Teodoro Evangelista, Mrs. Carl Hess, Manuel Mañosa, Vincente Marasigan, Paulino Miranda Sampedro, Gonzalo Puyat, Juan Tuason, and Soledad Zulueta.&lt;ref name=PhilStar&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.philstar.com/education-and-home/678234/home-every-child-story-white-cross|title = A Home for Every Child: The Story of White Cross |last = |first = |publisher = Philippine Star |date = 21 April 2011 |website = Philstar.com  |accessdate= 21 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:White Cross Orphanage 5.JPG|thumb|The name "Quezon Preventorium" is still visible at the facade.]]

Through the leadership of de Araneta, the board purchased the land in Santolan, San Juan, which is four-hectare lot, where the structure would be built.&lt;ref name=PDI&gt;{{cite web |url = http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/metro/view/20070305-52902/Orphanage_marks_founder%92s_100th_year_ |title = Orphanage Marks Founder’s 100th Year |last = Morelos |first = Miko |publisher = Philippine Daily Inquirer |date = 5 March 2007 |website = Inquirer.net  |accessdate= 21 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its recognized supporters at that time was President Manuel Quezon and in his honor the orphanage was also known as the Quezon Preventorium. He signed a bill that allowed a portion of horse race revenues to be channeled to the orphanage.&lt;ref name=PDI /&gt;

In 1938, two years after its initial operations, the institution was run under the care of the [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul]] who took in 20 children of TB patients as its wards. The nuns managed the orphanage until they turned it over to the current board in 2004.&lt;ref name=PDI /&gt;

===World War II===
On 20 June 1944, during the time of World War II, the Japanese took over the orphanage and the nuns transferred the children to Welfareville in Mandaluyong for safety. Although the board gave Sr. Consuelo Muró, then overseer of White Cross, the authority to close down the institution, she continued the mission and fed the children in its temporary home in Welfareville. When the war ended and through the help of the American liberation forces, they restored White Cross and the children and the staff returned to San Juan in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://via.library.depaul.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=15&amp;article=1016&amp;context=vincentian_ebooks&amp;type=additional |title = Vincentians in the Philippines: 1862-1962 |last = dela Goza |first = Rolando |publisher = Congregación de la Misión en Filipina |date = 1985 |website = http://via.library.depaul.edu/vincentian_ebooks/13/ |accessdate= 21 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:White Cross Orphanage 9.JPG|thumb|Relief of children at play.]]
The services of architect [[Pablo Antonio]], who was later recognized as National Artist for Architecture, was obtained to design White Cross, which was aimed to be a fresh-air shelter for the children of TB patients. The building was an Art Deco design with its façade shaped like a large white cross. The bas-relief of children at play that was designed by Italian sculptor Francesco Monti softened the linear and sharp structure of the façade.&lt;ref name=Design&gt;{{cite web |url = http://services.inquirer.net/mobile/07/09/04/html_output/xmlhtml/20070902-86206-xml.html |title = Harvest of Culture and Design Books |last = Villalon |first = Augusto |publisher = Philippine Daily Inquirer |date = 2 September 2007 |website = Inquirer.net |accessdate= 21 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Antonio’s works, which included the [[Far Eastern University]] (FEU), Ideal Garden, Orchid Garden Hotel, and Syquia Apartments, only the Manila Polo Club and White Cross remain as the stalwarts because most of his designs have been demolished or in a state of decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://businessmirror.com.ph/index.php/en/lifestyle/life/20108-an-architect-s-abode |title = An Architect’s Abode |last = Ciriaco |first = Nico Erle |publisher = Business Mirror |date = 30 September 2013 |website = BusinessMirror.com.ph |accessdate= 21 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
