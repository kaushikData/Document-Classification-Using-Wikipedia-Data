      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10444">The '''90-10 rule''' refers to a U.S. regulation that governs [[For-profit higher education in the United States|for-profit higher education]]. It caps the percentage of revenue that a proprietary school can receive from federal financial aid sources at 90%; the other 10% of revenue must come from alternative sources.

Not all federal sources of financial aid fall under this cap. In particular, funds supporting the education of troops and veterans, such as the [[G.I. Bill|GI Bill]] and Department of Defense Tuition Assistance program, are not subject to this cap.

The rule is intended to use a market mechanism to weed out the worst performing proprietary schools. The requirement’s intent was to ensure that no school could rely solely on federal funding.

Since 2010, growing scrutiny of the for-profit industry has spurred new efforts to strengthen the 90-10 rule. Some veteran and military groups have pushed for the [[GI Bill]] and Tuition Assistance Program to be included in the funds that are capped. Democratic lawmakers have sought new regulations to improve reporting and transparency in the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-education/2016/06/democrats-press-education-department-on-90-10-rule-214960|title=Democrats press Education Department on 90/10 rule|website=POLITICO|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the 90-10 Rule ==
The origin of the 90-10 rule lies in the history of veteran’s education benefits. Following World War II, a number of proprietary, fly-by-night colleges emerged to meet the heightened demand for colleges from returning troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://prospect.org/article/delivering-young-families-resonance-gi-bill|title=Delivering for Young Families: The Resonance of the GI Bill|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned with the quality of these schools, the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veteran Administration]] instituted an 85-15 rule, capping the percentage of a school’s revenue from [[G.I. Bill|GI Bill]] funds at 85%.&lt;ref name="finaid.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finaid.org/loans/90-10-rule.phtml|title=FinAid {{!}} Loans {{!}} 90/10 Rule|website=www.finaid.org|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, for-profit colleges became eligible to receive federal student financial aid under [[Title IV]]. There were then no restrictions on the percentage of revenue that could be received from these sources.&lt;ref name="Kamenetz"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/college_week/2005/11/the_profit_chase.html|title=The Profit Chase|last=Kamenetz|first=Anya|date=2005-11-16|newspaper=Slate|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, lawmakers became concerned with the quality and recruiting practices of for-profit colleges. Almost half of student loan defaults came from for-profit school students despite comprising just a fifth of loans.&lt;ref name="Kamenetz"/&gt; This growing concern led to new efforts to impose more regulations on the industry.

The result was included in the 1992 [[Higher Education Act of 1965|Higher Education Act]], which included the first iteration of today’s 90-10 rule. It required that a for-profit school receive no more than 85% of its from Title IV financial aid sources. This rule was modeled after the earlier Veteran Administration regulation.&lt;ref name="finaid.org"/&gt;

During the 1998 reauthorization of the [[Higher Education Act of 1965|Higher Education Act]], Congress changed the 85-15 rule to the 90-10 rule. Now for-profit colleges could receive up to 90%, rather than 85%, of revenue from [[Title IV]] funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.policyarchive.org/handle/10207/1904|title=Institutional Eligibility and the Higher Education Act: Legislative History of the 90/10 Rule and Its Current Status - PolicyArchive|website=www.policyarchive.org|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent Efforts to Modify the 90-10 Rule ==
With again increasing scrutiny of the for-profit school industry, the 90-10 rule has again become controversial. Many advocates are pushing efforts to modify the 90-10 rule.

=== Include Military and Veteran Benefits in the 90-10 Cap ===
Military and veteran benefits, such as the [[G.I. Bill|GI Bill]] and [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] Tuition Assistance Program, are not subject to the 90-10 cap. Many for-profit colleges sought to take advantage of this exclusion and focused their recruiting on troops and veterans.

In 2012, the [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions|Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee]] investigation revealed the deceptive practices that some for-profit colleges use to recruit troops and veterans.&lt;ref name="Wong"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/06/for-profit-college-veterans-loophole/396731/|title=Why For-Profit Colleges Target Military Veterans|last=Wong|first=Alia|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recruiters faced significant pressure to attract military veterans;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-for-profit-colleges-gi-bill-20150809-story.html|title=For-profit colleges are using the GI Bill to make money off veterans|last=Times|first=Los Angeles|website=latimes.com|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; some recruiters were found to falsely promise that veterans and military benefits would cover the full cost of school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/07/30/the-slick-ways-for-profit-colleges-market-themselves-is-backfiring/|title=Slick for-profit college marketing is starting to backfire|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others published military themed websites, such as GIBill.com, to push troops and veterans to toward for-profit colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/davidhalperin/military-branded-websites_b_9131742.html|title=Military-Branded Websites Push Veterans to Troubled For-Profit Colleges|last=Attorney|first=David Halperin|last2=advocate|date=2016-02-01|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-09-29|last3=RepublicReport.org|first3=writer at}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This report helped jumpstart an effort among some Congressional lawmakers and military and veterans groups to have military and veteran benefits included in the 90-10 cap. Many Members of Congress, including Democratic Senators [[Dick Durbin]], [[Tom Carper]], and [[Richard Blumenthal]] and Representative [[Jackie Speier]], introduced legislation to close this "loophole." None of these efforts succeeded.&lt;ref name="Wong"/&gt;

The push to include military and veteran benefits in the 90-10 cap has garnered fierce opposition from the for-profit school industry group,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fapsc.blogspot.com/2015/04/apscu-blog-9010-rule-hurts-access-to.html|title=Florida Association of Postsecondary Schools and Colleges: APSCU Blog: The 90/10 Rule Hurts Access to Postsecondary Education for Traditional Students|last=Fapsc|website=Florida Association of Postsecondary Schools and Colleges|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Career Education Colleges and Universities]], previously known as the Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2016/06/07/profit-college-association-changes-name|title=For-Profit College Association Changes Name {{!}} Inside Higher Ed|website=www.insidehighered.com|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many proprietary colleges receive more than 90% of their revenue from federal sources if military and veteran benefits are included in the calculation.   A 2014 report from the Center for Investigative Reporting showed that more than 133 schools would fail the 90-10 rule if military and veteran benefits were included.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.revealnews.org/article-legacy/taxpayer-funds-are-lifeline-for-more-than-100-for-profit-schools/|title=Taxpayer funds are lifeline for more than 100 for-profit schools|date=2014-10-09|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts to make this change continue. In November 2015, Senator [[Dick Durbin]] [D-IL] introduced legislation to include military and veteran benefits in the 90-10 cap. The bill remains stuck in the [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions|Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2272|title=Congress.Gov|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Barack Obama]] expressed support for the bill shortly after its introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.revealnews.org/article/bill-would-limit-for-profit-colleges-access-to-federal-funds/|title=Bill would limit for-profit colleges’ access to federal funds|date=2015-11-11|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Secretary [[Hillary Clinton]] expressed support for the inclusion of military and veteran education benefits in the 90% cap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/higher-education/clinton-criticizes-predatory-lenders-during-veterans-forum/2015/06/18/022227ee-161e-11e5-8457-4b431bf7ed4c_story.html)|title=Page Not Found - The Washington Post|date=2012-04-30|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reduce the 90-10 Cap to 85-15 ===
Some lawmakers are also trying to lower the percentage of revenue a for-profit school can receive from federal funds from 90% to 85%. If military and veteran benefits were included in this lower cap, the Center for Investigative Reporting found that an additional 292 schools would fail this lower standard.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The change was included in the stalled Protecting Our Students and Taxpayers Act of 2015, introduced by Senators [[Dick Durbin]], [[Jack Reed (politician)|Jack Reed]], [[Elizabeth Warren]], and [[Richard Blumenthal]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In his 2017 Budget proposal, [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] requested that the cap be lowered from 90% to 85%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasfaa.org/news-item/7537/President_Obama_s_Final_Budget_Proposal_Renews_Push_for_Signature_Policy_Initiatives|title=NASFAA {{!}} President Obama’s Final Budget Proposal Renews Push for Signature Policy Initiatives|website=www.nasfaa.org|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amarna letter EA 271''', titled: ''"The Power of the [[Habiru|'Apiru]],"''&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Moran|Moran, William L.]] 1987, 1992. ''The Amarna Letters.'' EA 271, ''The Power of the 'Apiru'', p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; is a moderately, short, tallish, rectangular [[clay tablet]] letter, approximately 3 in wide x 4 in tall, from [[Milkilu]] the mayor/ruler of Gazru ([[Gezer]]), of the mid 14th century BC [[Amarna letters]].

The Canaanite [[city-state]]s were visited by the scribes, with short 'status reports' sent to the Pharaoh (King) reporting on city or regional accounts, for example the troubles with the [[habiru]], or other external affairs. Many of the Canaanite letters are short, with some nearly identical phraseology of words, as well as the layout of the individual [[clay tablet]] letters. Milkilu authored EA 268 through EA 271. [[Amarna letter EA 270]]-(29 lines) is nearly identical in shape to EA 271-(27 lines), with the beginning lines of the obverse, nearly identical in wording, and spacing.

The [[Amarna letters]], about 300, numbered up to EA 382, are a mid 14th century BC, about [[1350 BC]] and 20–25 years later, [[Text corpus|correspondence]]. The initial corpus of letters were found at [[Akhenaten]]'s city [[Akhetaten]], in the floor of the [[Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh]]; others were later found, adding to the body of letters.

==The [[Habiru]]/[[habiru|'Apiru]]==
[[File:AreasOfHabiruActivityInAmarnaLettersLBIIA.svg|thumb|right|270px]]
The mention of the [[Habiru]] shows the conflict of the time, as the takeover of [[city-state]]s or regions by the Habiru. The map shows various cities and regions, and their respective dealings with the Habiru. (There are only 3 letters from [[Labaya]] of [[Shechem|Šakmu]]/[[Shechem]].) The next closest mention of the Habiru is from the Jerusalem letters of [[Abdi-Heba]], directly south at [[Jerusalem]], letters [[Amarna letter EA 286|EA 286]], [[Amarna letter EA 287|287]], [[Amarna letter EA 288|288]], [[Amarna letter EA 289|289]], and [[Amarna letter EA 290|EA 290]].

The '''Arch of Claudius''' was a triumphal arch built in honour of the emperor [[Claudius]]'s [[Roman conquest of Britain|successful invasion of Britain]].  It is now lost, although its inscription is held at the [[Capitoline Museums]] and may be seen [[s:Arch of Claudius|here]].&lt;ref name="ThorntonThornton1989"&gt;{{cite book|author1=M. K. Thornton|author2=R. L. Thornton|title=Julio-Claudian Building Programs: A Quantitative Study in Political Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9YHh8TvZ_ZsC&amp;pg=PA138|year=1989|publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers|isbn=978-0-86516-202-0|pages=138–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arch was dedicated in AD 51, although it was anticipated on the reverse of coins issued in AD 46-47 and AD 49. The coin shows it as surmounted by an equestrian statue between two [[tropaeum (Ancient Rome)|trophies]].  It was a conversion of one of the arches of the [[Aqua Virgo]] aqueduct where it crossed the [[Via Flaminia]], the main road to the north, just north of the [[Saepta]].  

The reconstructed inscription (also found on arches dedicated for the same reason at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] - Claudius's departure point for Britain - and at [[Cyzicus]]) reads:

{{cquote|The Roman Senate and People to Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, son of Drusus, Pontifex Maximus, Tribunician power eleven times, Consul five times, Imperator 22 times, Censor, Father of the Fatherland, because he received the surrender of eleven kings of the Britons defeated without any loss, and first brought barbarian peoples across the Ocean into the dominion of the Roman people.&lt;ref&gt;CIL VI 40416 = CIL VI 920 = CIL VI 31203 = AE 1948, 80 = AE 2004, 38&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It seems to have been in ruins as early as the eighth century, but in 1562, in 1641, and again in 1869 portions of the structure were found, including part of the principal inscription, inscriptions dedicated to other members of the imperial family, some of the foundations, and fragments of sculpture of which all traces have been lost.

A recurring theme in the literary, theatrical and film tradition of [[comedy]] is the use of [[stock character]]s representing [[authority]] figures, designed to poke fun at officialdom by showing that its members are not immune to entanglement in the ridiculous. This is an old tradition, well illustrated in works such as [[Chaucer]]'s [[Canterbury Tales]] and [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Candide]]''.

This theme was commonly used by British comedy troupe, [[Monty Python]]. In their sketches, a "common comedic device was for authority figures (such as military officers, police, judges, Conservative politicians, BBC news announcers and even God) to take their characters to extremes by suddenly spouting complete nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;Craig Hight, Jane Roscoe. ''Faking It: Mock-Documentary and the Subversion of Factuality''. Manchester University Press (2002) {{ISBN|0-7190-5641-1}} (p. 80).&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples include: 
*Police officers, as seen in ''[[Keystone Kops]]'', ''[[Inspector Clouseau]]'', ''[[Reno 911!]]'', ''[[Police Academy (film series)|Police Academy]]'', ''[[The Thin Blue Line (TV series)|The Thin Blue Line]]'' and ''[[Carry On films|Carry On Constable]]''.
*Soldiers, as seen in ''[[The Phil Silvers Show|Sgt. Bilko]]'', ''[[Carry On films|Carry on Sergeant]]'', ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'', ''[[Blackadder Goes Forth]]'' and [[Il Capitano]] in the [[Commedia dell'arte]].
*Civil servants, as seen in ''[[Yes Minister]]'', ''[[Carlton-Browne of the F.O.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053044 Carlton-Browne of the F.O. (1959)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Ministry of Silly Walks]]'' and ''[[Spin City]]''.
*Priests, as seen in ''[[All Gas and Gaiters]]'' and ''[[Father Ted]]''.
*Teachers, [[Principal (school)|principals]], and [[dean (education)|deans]], as seen in ''[[Animal House]]'' and ''[[High School High]]''.

Some television shows, such as ''[[South Park]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]'', have a collection of characters that represent all of the main groups of authority figures, and each portray such figures as humorously flawed. Indeed, each show has a resident police officer — [[Recurring South Park characters#Officer Barbrady|Officer Barbrady]] and [[Chief Wiggum]], respectively — portrayed as an incompetent and bumbling idiot. The shows also mockingly portray their resident religious leader — [[Priest Maxi]] in ''South Park'' and [[Reverend Timothy Lovejoy]] in ''The Simpsons''. The shows also include, with slightly different characteristics, the flawed exercise of authority by parents, teachers, school principals, mayors, and occasionally of soldiers and politicians.

Examples can also be found in the art of the [[Russian joke]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20095">'''Bernhard Kummer''' (21 January 1897, [[Leipzig]] &amp;ndash; 1 December 1962, [[Bad Segeberg]]) was a [[Germanist]] who was appointed to a professorship in the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi era]] and whose writings have been influential among postwar [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]]. He was a prominent representative of [[Nordicism]], the view that the so-called Nordic race was inherently culturally advanced, and in books including his best known work, ''Midgards Untergang'', he argues that the conversion of the [[Germanic peoples]] from their native [[Germanic paganism]], particularly the [[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianisation of Scandinavia]], was detrimental to European culture.

==Career, writing and political activity==
Kummer earned his doctorate at the [[University of Leipzig]] under the theologian Hans Haas, first publishing ''Midgards Untergang'' in 1927 as his doctoral thesis.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Heinrich, "Bernhard Kummer (1897&amp;ndash;1962): The Study of Religions Between Religious Devotion for the Ancient Germans, Political Agitation, and Academic Habitus" in Horst Junginger, ed., ''The Study of Religion under the Impact of Fascism'', Leiden/Boston: Brill, 2008, {{ISBN|978-90-04-16326-3}}, pp. 229&amp;ndash;62, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=felwT6bfB6vRiAK7zKnADA&amp;sqi=2&amp;id=dNAvnlrvrE0C&amp;dq=neo-Nazis+Bernhard+Kummer&amp;q=methodical+deconstruction#v=snippet&amp;q=methodical%20deconstruction&amp;f=false p. 233 and note 18].&lt;/ref&gt; A committed National Socialist, he joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1928 (member number 87,841), was also a member of the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]], and wrote articles for Nazi publications beginning in 1927.&lt;ref name=Nordische51&gt;Hans-Jürgen Lutzhöft, ''Der Nordische Gedanke  in Deutschland 1920&amp;ndash;1940'', Kieler historische Studien 14, Stuttgart: Klett, [1971], {{ISBN|9783129054703}}, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=luRwT8jRGOaniAL5seGvDA&amp;id=qeQAAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Lutzh%C3%B6ft%2C+Nordische+Gedanke&amp;q=Kummer#search_anchor p. 51] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Heinrich245&gt;Heinrich, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=felwT6bfB6vRiAK7zKnADA&amp;sqi=2&amp;id=dNAvnlrvrE0C&amp;dq=neo-Nazis+Bernhard+Kummer&amp;q=Jena%27s+Philosophy+Department#v=snippet&amp;q=Jena%27s%20Philosophy%20Department&amp;f=false p. 245].&lt;/ref&gt; He left the party in 1930 because membership was preventing him from obtaining a public post or scholarship and he was having difficulty providing for his family;&lt;ref name=Heinrich245/&gt; [[Gustav Neckel]] had applied for a scholarship on his behalf in 1929.&lt;ref name=Heinrich250&gt;Heinrich, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=felwT6bfB6vRiAK7zKnADA&amp;sqi=2&amp;id=dNAvnlrvrE0C&amp;dq=neo-Nazis+Bernhard+Kummer&amp;q=Neckel+applied+for+a+scholarship+in+behalf#v=snippet&amp;q=Neckel%20applied%20for%20a%20scholarship%20in%20behalf&amp;f=false p. 250 and note 92].&lt;/ref&gt; He rejoined the party only late in the Third Reich, but for reasons of conflict with other Nazis, not out of lack of commitment to its ideology;&lt;ref name=Heinrich246&gt;Heinrich, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=felwT6bfB6vRiAK7zKnADA&amp;sqi=2&amp;id=dNAvnlrvrE0C&amp;dq=neo-Nazis+Bernhard+Kummer&amp;q=different+interpretations+of+a+disparate+ideology#v=snippet&amp;q=different%20interpretations%20of%20a%20disparate%20ideology&amp;f=false p. 246].&lt;/ref&gt; he requested readmission beginning in 1933,&lt;ref name=Schilling190&gt;Willy Schilling, "NS-Dozentenschaft und Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Dozentenbund an der Universität Jena", in Uwe Hossfeld (ed.), ''Kämpferische Wissenschaft: Studien zur Universität Jena im Nationalsozialismus'', Cologne: Böhlau, 2003, {{ISBN|9783412041021}}, pp. 180&amp;ndash;201, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=lTdiT8j7GcTmiAKThpSwCA&amp;id=bJCxIkTe1gYC&amp;dq=Bernhard+Kummer&amp;q=Vertreter+des+NSDDB+an+der+Philosophischen+Fakult%C3%A4t#v=snippet&amp;q=Vertreter%20des%20NSDDB%20an%20der%20Philosophischen%20Fakult%C3%A4t&amp;f=false p. 190] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was supported by the [[Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Dozentenbund|Association of National Socialist Dozents]], which he represented in his division of the [[University of Jena]].&lt;ref name=Heinrich246/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schilling190/&gt; After the Nazis came to power, he lectured widely to party organisations and was a [[dozent]] at the [[Deutsche Hochschule für Politik]] in Berlin.&lt;ref name=Heinrich250/&gt; From 1938 he belonged to the SA "Working Group for [[Weltanschauung]] and Culture".&lt;ref&gt;Annett Hamann, "'Männer der kämpfenden Wissenschaft': die 1945 geschlossenen NS-Institute der Universität Jena", in Hossfeld, ed., pp. 202&amp;ndash;34, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=lTdiT8j7GcTmiAKThpSwCA&amp;id=bJCxIkTe1gYC&amp;dq=Bernhard+Kummer&amp;q=SA%2C+Arbeitskreis+f%C3%BCr+Weltanschauung+und+Kultur#v=snippet&amp;q=SA%2C%20Arbeitskreis%20f%C3%BCr%20Weltanschauung%20und%20Kultur&amp;f=false p. 228, note 93] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He never completed his [[habilitation]] (the two volumes published as ''Herd und Altar''&amp;mdash;Hearth and Altar&amp;mdash;had been intended to serve that purpose)&lt;ref name=Heinrich250/&gt; but taught at the University of Jena beginning in October 1936, and on 1 May 1942 was appointed Professor of Old Norse language and culture together with Germanic history of religion.&lt;ref name=Schilling190/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=felwT6bfB6vRiAK7zKnADA&amp;sqi=2&amp;id=dNAvnlrvrE0C&amp;dq=neo-Nazis+Bernhard+Kummer&amp;q=Nordic+language+and+culture+and+history+of+the+old+German+religion#v=snippet&amp;q=Nordic%20language%20and%20culture%20and%20history%20of%20the%20old%20German%20religion&amp;f=false pp. 252&amp;ndash;53].&lt;/ref&gt;

Kummer participated from its inception in 1927 in the ''Handwörterbuch des Deutschen Aberglaubens'', a prestigious project.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=felwT6bfB6vRiAK7zKnADA&amp;sqi=2&amp;id=dNAvnlrvrE0C&amp;dq=neo-Nazis+Bernhard+Kummer&amp;q=deutschen+Aberglaubens#v=snippet&amp;q=deutschen%20Aberglaubens&amp;f=false p. 251].&lt;/ref&gt; His articles are on the family and sexuality&lt;ref name=Heinrich252&gt;Heinrich, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=felwT6bfB6vRiAK7zKnADA&amp;sqi=2&amp;id=dNAvnlrvrE0C&amp;dq=neo-Nazis+Bernhard+Kummer&amp;q=on+family+matters#v=snippet&amp;q=on%20family%20matters&amp;f=false p. 252].&lt;/ref&gt; and also on goddesses and other female figures such as [[Mother Holle]].&lt;ref&gt;Elisheva Baumgarten, ''Mothers and Children: Jewish Family Life in Medieval Europe'', Jews, Christians, and Muslims from the ancient to the modern world, Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University, 2004, {{ISBN|9780691091662}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=70nKVvkj5Y4C&amp;pg=PA216&amp;dq=Bernhard+Kummer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lTdiT8j7GcTmiAKThpSwCA&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Bernhard%20Kummer&amp;f=false p. 216, note 17]; see also the list in the bibliography of Heinrich's article, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=felwT6bfB6vRiAK7zKnADA&amp;sqi=2&amp;id=dNAvnlrvrE0C&amp;dq=neo-Nazis+Bernhard+Kummer&amp;q=deutschen+Aberglaubens#v=snippet&amp;q=deutschen%20Aberglaubens&amp;f=false p. 260].&lt;/ref&gt; He was an influential proponent of Nordicism, particularly as an important ideologue in the ''Nordische Gesellschaft''&lt;ref&gt;Hamann, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=lTdiT8j7GcTmiAKThpSwCA&amp;id=bJCxIkTe1gYC&amp;dq=Bernhard+Kummer&amp;q=Wirken+in+der+Nordischen+Gesellschaft#v=snippet&amp;q=Wirken%20in%20der%20Nordischen%20Gesellschaft&amp;f=false p. 209].&lt;/ref&gt; and as the main author with the ''[[völkisch]]'' publishing house of Adolf Klein in Leipzig.&lt;ref&gt;Felix Wiedemann, ''Rassenmutter und Rebellin: Hexenbilder in Romantik, völkischer Bewegung, Neuheidentum und Feminismus'', Würzburg: Königshausen &amp; Neumann, 2007, {{ISBN|9783826036798}}, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=lTdiT8j7GcTmiAKThpSwCA&amp;id=WCClZEzq1G8C&amp;dq=Bernhard+Kummer&amp;q=wichtigen+Adolf+Klein#v=snippet&amp;q=wichtigen%20Adolf%20Klein&amp;f=false p. 151] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, many of Kummer's works were banned in the Soviet Occupation Zone of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsche Verwaltung für Volksbildung in der sowjetischen Besatzungszone, ''Liste der auszusondernden Literatur'', Berlin: Zentralverlag, 1946, [http://www.polunbi.de/bibliothek/1946-nslit-k.html K, pp. K, 203&amp;ndash;39] (transcript)&lt;/ref&gt; However, like some other former Nazi academics, he was able to draw on friendships to continue working, emphasising Germanic democracy rather than the "Führer principle" in his postwar publications.&lt;ref&gt;Hamann, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=lTdiT8j7GcTmiAKThpSwCA&amp;id=bJCxIkTe1gYC&amp;dq=Bernhard+Kummer&amp;q=sondern+%C3%BCber+die+demokratische+Grundz%C3%BCge+bei+den+Germanen#v=snippet&amp;q=sondern%20%C3%BCber%20die%20demokratische%20Grundz%C3%BCge%20bei%20den%20Germanen&amp;f=false p. 219].&lt;/ref&gt; He read a paper at the 8th International Congress for the History of Religions, in Rome in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Horst Junginger, "From Buddha to Adolf Hitler: Walther Wüst and the Aryan Tradition" in ''The Study of Religion under the Impact of Fascism'', pp. 108&amp;ndash;77, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=felwT6bfB6vRiAK7zKnADA&amp;sqi=2&amp;id=dNAvnlrvrE0C&amp;dq=neo-Nazis+Bernhard+Kummer&amp;q=not+only+Wirth%2C+also+a+Bernhard+Kummer#v=snippet&amp;q=not%20only%20Wirth%2C%20also%20a%20Bernhard%20Kummer&amp;f=false p. 163 and note 142]. Otto Höfler also presented a paper.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with other ''völkisch'' neopagans including [[Herman Wirth]], he was active in the [[Deutsche Unitarier Religionsgemeinschaft]] (German Unitarian Religious Community).&lt;ref&gt;Wiedemann, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=lTdiT8j7GcTmiAKThpSwCA&amp;id=WCClZEzq1G8C&amp;dq=Bernhard+Kummer&amp;q=Ideologen+wie+die+behandelten+Bernhard+Kummer#v=snippet&amp;q=Ideologen%20wie%20die%20behandelten%20Bernhard%20Kummer&amp;f=false p. 188].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Midgards Untergang'' in particular is still cited by neo-Nazis as scholarly evidence for their views.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dNAvnlrvrE0C&amp;pg=PA230&amp;dq=Midgards+Untergang+neo-nazis&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z-hwT4T8NKPciALt9qXxDA&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Midgards%20Untergang%20neo-nazis&amp;f=false p. 230 and note 4].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views and dispute with Otto Höfler==
Beginning with ''Midgards Untergang'', Kummer propounded a view of ancient Germanic culture, influenced by [[Vilhelm Grønbech]], as marked by a dualism reminiscent of [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] thought, between life-affirming ''[[Midgard]]'' and life-endangering ''[[Útgarðar|Utgard]]''.&lt;ref name=Wiedemann152&gt;Wiedemann, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=lTdiT8j7GcTmiAKThpSwCA&amp;id=WCClZEzq1G8C&amp;dq=Bernhard+Kummer&amp;q=dramatische+Schilderung+des+Niedergangs#v=snippet&amp;q=dramatische%20Schilderung%20des%20Niedergangs&amp;f=false p. 152].&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the [[Eddic poems]] already represented a weakened form of [[Germanic paganism]] because of both Christian influence and the adoption of [[Odin]], an originally alien god, and that these divisive inroads by Utgard made possible the success of missionaries in converting the Germanic peoples:&lt;ref name=Wiedemann152/&gt; "the Norse Odin of the waning days of heathendom [constituted] a bridge between Germanic piety and Christian devil-belief".&lt;ref name=Wiedemann153&gt;Wiedemann, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=lTdiT8j7GcTmiAKThpSwCA&amp;id=WCClZEzq1G8C&amp;dq=Bernhard+Kummer&amp;q=christlichem+Teufelsglauben#v=snippet&amp;q=christlichem%20Teufelsglauben&amp;f=false p. 153], quoting from "Frau / Weib", ''Handwörterbuch des Deutschen Aberglaubens'', col. 1737: "Brücke zwischen germanischer Frömmigkeit und christlichem Teufelsglauben".&lt;/ref&gt; He regarded the conversion as a catastrophe, causing cultural decay&lt;ref name=Junginger50&gt;Horst Junginger, "Introduction" in ''The Study of Religion under the Impact of Fascism'', pp. 1&amp;ndash;103, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=felwT6bfB6vRiAK7zKnADA&amp;sqi=2&amp;id=dNAvnlrvrE0C&amp;dq=neo-Nazis+Bernhard+Kummer&amp;q=had+caused+their+steady+decay#v=snippet&amp;q=had%20caused%20their%20steady%20decay&amp;f=false p. 50].&lt;/ref&gt; and the eventual downfall (''Untergang'') of Midgard; hence his title recalling [[Oswald Spengler]]'s ''[[The Decline of the West]]'' or ''The Downfall of the Occident'' (''Der Untergang des Abendlandes'').&lt;ref name=Wiedemann152/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Thomas Mees, ''The Science of the Swastika'', Budapest/New York: Central European University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|9789639776180}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hLNUx6YK9RIC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=%22Bernhard+Kummer%22+Midgards+Untergang&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=se9wT_i3IOK2iwLnsbDFDA&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Bernhard%20Kummer%22%20Midgards%20Untergang&amp;f=false pp. 121&amp;ndash;22].&lt;/ref&gt; His views were influenced by significant anti-Catholicism; in his view, the ancient Teutons "and [their] gods coexisted in a relationship of mutual trust"&lt;ref&gt;Georges Dumézil, ''Gods of the Ancient Northmen'', Berkeley: University of California, 1973, {{ISBN|9780520020443}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rurD1yd0Ok0C&amp;pg=PR21&amp;dq=%22Bernhard+Kummer%22+Midgards+Untergang&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=se9wT_i3IOK2iwLnsbDFDA&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Bernhard%20Kummer%22%20Midgards%20Untergang&amp;f=false p. xxi].&lt;/ref&gt; and their ethics were based on custom and conscience, as opposed to dogma (as in Catholicism) or law (as in Judaism).&lt;ref name=Wiedemann152/&gt; He referred to Catholics as "the [[Praetorian Guard]] of Rome".&lt;ref&gt;In ''Mission als Sittenwechsel'' (1933); Heinrich, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=felwT6bfB6vRiAK7zKnADA&amp;sqi=2&amp;id=dNAvnlrvrE0C&amp;dq=neo-Nazis+Bernhard+Kummer&amp;q=Kummer+used+this+term+to+name+the+followers+of+the+Catholic+Church#v=snippet&amp;q=Kummer%20used%20this%20term%20to%20name%20the%20followers%20of%20the%20Catholic%20Church&amp;f=false p. 240 and note 49].&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the [[Ariosophy|Ariosophists]], he regarded superstition and belief in witches as primitive traits imported into Germanic culture via Catholicism, rather than repositories of ancient native thought.&lt;ref name=Wiedemann153/&gt;

Kummer's publications show both deep knowledge and an increasingly strident political approach.&lt;ref name=Heinrich252/&gt; In ''Midgards Untergang'' (1927) his main focus is on what can be learned of ancient Germanic culture from the sources; in ''Mission als Sittenwechsel'' (1933) he examines the effect of the "collective mental injury" of conversion and loss of culture; and in ''Der Machtkampf zwischen Volk, König und Kirche im alten Norden'' (Volume 2 of ''Herd und Altar'', 1939), he ascribes to the conversion all the ills of his own time as he saw them: "usury, homelessness, mass culture, [loss of dignity], treason against blood and army, cowardice, the disregard of ancestral heritage, [failure to resist] the enticements of the day, corruption, disrespect of national interests, a [morality] of adultery, poverty among children, degeneration of motherly love, and intellectual disbelief."&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=felwT6bfB6vRiAK7zKnADA&amp;sqi=2&amp;id=dNAvnlrvrE0C&amp;dq=neo-Nazis+Bernhard+Kummer&amp;q=mass+culture%2C+people%27s+indignity#v=snippet&amp;q=mass%20culture%2C%20people%27s%20indignity&amp;f=false p. 234 and note 20], where the German is quoted.&lt;/ref&gt; He acquired the deprecatory nickname "Germanenbernhard", which "hints at his character as a pettifogging and self-opinionated polemicist".&lt;ref&gt;Junginger, "Introduction", [https://books.google.com/books?ei=felwT6bfB6vRiAK7zKnADA&amp;sqi=2&amp;id=dNAvnlrvrE0C&amp;dq=neo-Nazis+Bernhard+Kummer&amp;q=Germanenbernhard#v=snippet&amp;q=Germanenbernhard&amp;f=false p. 51].&lt;/ref&gt;

Kummer's academic career was retarded by a conflict with [[Otto Höfler]] which became part of the conflict between the [[Ahnenerbe]] and the [[Amt Rosenberg]], with which Kummer was affiliated.&lt;ref name=Heinrich254&gt;Heinrich, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=felwT6bfB6vRiAK7zKnADA&amp;sqi=2&amp;id=dNAvnlrvrE0C&amp;dq=neo-Nazis+Bernhard+Kummer&amp;q=rationalistic+and+unhistorical#v=snippet&amp;q=rationalistic%20and%20unhistorical&amp;f=false p. 254].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiedemann, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=lTdiT8j7GcTmiAKThpSwCA&amp;id=WCClZEzq1G8C&amp;dq=Bernhard+Kummer&amp;q=ins+Stocken#v=snippet&amp;q=ins%20Stocken&amp;f=false pp. 170], [https://books.google.com/books?ei=lTdiT8j7GcTmiAKThpSwCA&amp;id=WCClZEzq1G8C&amp;dq=Bernhard+Kummer&amp;q=Auch+Kummer+selbst%2C+der+inszwischen#v=onepage&amp;q=Auch%20Kummer%20selbst%2C%20der%20inszwischen&amp;f=false 176].&lt;/ref&gt; Höfler originally fanned the flames of their disagreement with a dismissive treatment of Kummer's work in his ''Kultische Geheimbünde der Germanen'' (1934), but Kummer fought back "with almost every weapon he could get."&lt;ref name=Heinrich254/&gt; Kummer attacked Höfler's version of the [[Germanic Continuity Theory]] as based on the equation of the ancient Teutons with primitives and therefore inherently denigratory.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=felwT6bfB6vRiAK7zKnADA&amp;sqi=2&amp;id=dNAvnlrvrE0C&amp;dq=neo-Nazis+Bernhard+Kummer&amp;q=primitives#v=snippet&amp;q=primitives&amp;f=false pp. 254&amp;ndash;55].&lt;/ref&gt; He accused the Catholic Höfler, whose work emphasises initiatory cults and secret societies, of "an un-Nordic predilection for strange rites and ecstatic practices".&lt;ref name=Junginger52&gt;Junginger, "Introduction", [https://books.google.com/books?ei=felwT6bfB6vRiAK7zKnADA&amp;sqi=2&amp;id=dNAvnlrvrE0C&amp;dq=neo-Nazis+Bernhard+Kummer&amp;q=strange+rites+and+ecstatic+practices#v=snippet&amp;q=strange%20rites%20and%20ecstatic%20practices&amp;f=false p. 52].&lt;/ref&gt; Höfler was able to point out the potential destructiveness of such sectarianism in the Third Reich,&lt;ref name=Junginger52/&gt; and his viewpoint easily supported the notion of National Socialism as the culmination of Germanic history, whereas Kummer had to resort to a reawakening of suppressed cultural forces.&lt;ref name=Junginger50/&gt; [[Heinrich Himmler]] intervened in the quarrel and Kummer was forced to withdrew his attacks on Höfler and resign from the journal ''Nordische Stimmen'', which he had founded;&lt;ref&gt;Mees, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=se9wT_i3IOK2iwLnsbDFDA&amp;id=hLNUx6YK9RIC&amp;dq=%22Bernhard+Kummer%22+Midgards+Untergang&amp;q=Nordische+Stimmen#v=snippet&amp;q=Nordische%20Stimmen&amp;f=false p. 122].&lt;/ref&gt; only then did his academic career advance.&lt;ref&gt;Junginger, "Introduction", pp. 50&amp;ndash;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=felwT6bfB6vRiAK7zKnADA&amp;sqi=2&amp;id=dNAvnlrvrE0C&amp;dq=neo-Nazis+Bernhard+Kummer&amp;q=made+it+possible+for+him+to+eventually+get+a+chair#v=snippet&amp;q=made%20it%20possible%20for%20him%20to%20eventually%20get%20a%20chair&amp;f=false 51].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20364">'''Book design''' is the art of incorporating the content, style, [[Word processor|format]], [[design]], and sequence of the various components and elements of a [[book]] into a coherent unit. In the words of the renowned typographer [[Jan Tschichold]] (1902–1974), book design, "though largely forgotten today, [relies upon] methods and rules upon which it is impossible to improve, [and which] have been developed over centuries. To produce perfect books, these rules have to be brought back to life and applied".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Tschichold|Tschichold, Jan]], ''The Form of the Book'' (1991), Hartley &amp; Marks, {{ISBN|0-88179-116-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Hendel describes book design as "an arcane subject", and refers to the need for a context to understand what that means.&lt;ref&gt;Hendel, Richard, ''On Book Design'', Yale University Press, {{ISBN|0-300-07570-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

Modern books are paginated consecutively, and all pages are counted in the pagination whether or not the numbers appear. The page number, or [[folio]], is most commonly found at the top of the page, flush left verso, flush right recto. The folio may also be printed at the bottom of the page, and in that location it is called a drop folio. Drop folios usually appear either centered on each page or flush left verso and flush right recto.&lt;ref name="CMS 2003"&gt;University of Chicago Press. (2003). ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'', 16th edition. {{ISBN|978-0226104201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Front matter===
Front matter (or preliminaries; shortened to "prelims") comprises the first section of a book, and is usually the smallest section in terms of the number of pages. Front-matter pages are traditionally numbered in lower-case [[Roman numerals]] (i, ii, iii, iv, v, etc.), which prevents renumbering the remainder of a book when front-matter content is added at the last moment, such as a dedication page or additional acknowledgments. Page number is omitted on blank pages and display pages (i.e., such stand-alone pages as those for the half title, frontispiece, title page, colophon, dedication, and epigraph), and it is either omitted or a drop folio is used on the opening page of each section of the front matter (e.g., table of contents, foreword, preface).&lt;ref name="CMS 2003"/&gt; Front matter generally appears only in the first of a multi-volume work, although some elements (such as a table of contents or index) may appear in each volume.

The following table defines some common types of front matter, and the "voice" (or point of view) in which each can be said to be given:

{| class="wikitable"
! Name !! Voice !! Purpose
|-
| [[Half title]] || Publisher || Usually a single line in capital letters, precedes the title page, and only contains the title (as opposed to the author, publisher etc. found on the full title page) with a blank [[verso]].
|-
| [[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] || Author or publisher || A decorative illustration on the verso facing the title page. It may be related to the book's subject, or be a portrait of the author.
|-
| [[Title page]] || Publisher || Repeats the title and author as printed on the cover or spine.
|-
| [[Colophon (publishing)|Colophon]] || Printer || Technical information such as edition dates, copyrights, typefaces and the name and address of the printer. In modern books usually on the verso of the title page, but in some books placed at the end (see Back matter). Also known as the [[Edition notice]] or [[Copyright page]].
|-
| [[Dedication (publishing)|Dedication]] || Author || A dedication page is a page in a book that precedes the text, in which the author names the person or people for whom he/she has written the book.
|-
| [[Epigraph (literature)|Epigraph]] || Author || A phrase, quotation, or poem. The epigraph may serve as a preface, as a summary, as a counter-example, or to link the work to a wider [[Canon (fiction)|literary canon]], either to invite comparison, or to enlist a conventional context.
|-
| [[Table of contents]] || Publisher || This is a list of chapter headings, and nested subheadings, together with their respective page numbers. This includes all front-matter items listed below, together with chapters in the body matter and back matter. The number of levels of subheadings shown should be limited, so as to keep the contents list short, ideally one page, or possibly a double-page spread. Technical books may include a list of figures and a list of tables.
|-
| [[Foreword]] || Some person other than the author || Often, a foreword will tell of some interaction between the writer of the foreword and the story or the writer of the story. A foreword to later editions of a work often explains in what respects that edition differs from previous ones.
|-
| [[Preface]] || Author || A preface generally covers the story of how the book came into being, or how the idea for the book was developed. This is often followed by thanks and acknowledgments to people who were helpful to the author during the time of writing.
|-
| [[Acknowledgment (creative arts)|Acknowledgments]] || Author || Often part of the preface, rather than a separate section in its own right, it acknowledges those who contributed to the creation of the book.
|-
| [[Introduction (essay)|Introduction]] || Author || A beginning section which states the purpose and goals of the following writing.
|-
| [[Prologue]] || Narrator (or a character in the book) || A prologue is an opening to a story that establishes the setting and gives background details, often some earlier story that ties into the main one, and other miscellaneous information. As such, it is generally considered part of the body in modern book organization (cf. [[Chicago Manual of Style]]).
|}

===Body matter===
[[File:Kelmscott Press - The Nature of Gothic by John Ruskin (first page).jpg|thumb|[[Initial]] on the opening page of a book printed by the [[Kelmscott Press]]]]{{Main|Body text}}
The structure of a work—and especially of its body matter—is often described hierarchically.

* Volumes
*: A volume is a set of leaves bound together. Thus each work is either a volume, or is divided into volumes.
* Books and parts
*: Single-volume works account for most of the non-academic consumer market in books. A single volume may embody either a part of a book or the whole of a book&lt;!-- Is a book or part ever divided between volumes?  --&gt;; in some works, parts encompass multiple books, while in others, books may consist of multiple parts.
* Chapters and sections
*: A chapter or section may be contained within a part or a book. When both chapters and sections are used in the same work, the sections are more often contained within chapters than the reverse.
*Modules and units
*:In some books the chapters are grouped into bigger parts, sometimes called modules. The numbering of the chapters can begin again at the start of every module. In educational books, especially, the chapters are often called units.

The first page of the actual text of a book is the opening page, which often incorporates special design features, such as [[initial]]s. Arabic numbering starts at this first page. If the text is introduced by a second half title or opens with a part title, the half title or part title counts as page one. As in the front matter, page numbers are omitted on blank pages, and are either omitted or a drop folio is used on the opening page of each part and chapter. On pages containing only illustrations or tables, page numbers are usually omitted, except in the case of a long sequence of figures or tables.&lt;ref name="CMS 2003"/&gt;

The following are two instructive examples:
* ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' has three parts (either in one volume each, or in a single volume), with each part containing two books, each containing, in turn, multiple chapters.
* The [[Christianity|Christian]] ''[[Bible]]'' (usually bound as a single volume) is divided into two "testaments" (which might more typically be described as "parts", and differ in length by a factor of three or four), each containing dozens of books, each in turn containing multiple chapters, which are most often divided (for purposes of [[citation]]) into "[[Chapters and verses of the Bible|verses]]" each containing roughly one [[independent clause]].

===Back matter (end matter)===
{{Hatnote|Not to be confused with [[endpaper]]s.}}
The back matter, also known as end matter, if used, normally consists of one or more of the following components:

{| class="wikitable"
! Name !! Voice !! Purpose
|-
| [[Epilogue]] || The narrator (or a character in the book) || This piece of writing at the end of a work of literature or drama is usually used to bring closure to the work.
|-
| [[:wikt:outro|Extro or Outro]] || || The conclusion to a piece of work; this is considered the opposite of the intro. These terms are more commonly used in music.
|-
| [[Afterword]] || The author, or some other real person || An afterword generally covers the story of how the book came into being, or of how the idea for the book was developed.
|-
| [[:wikt:conclusion|Conclusion]] || Author ||
|-
| [[Postscript]] || ||
|-
| [[Addendum|Appendix or Addendum]] || Author || This supplemental addition to a given main work may correct errors, explain inconsistencies or otherwise detail or update the information found in the main work.
|-
| [[Glossary]] || Author || The glossary consists of a set of definitions of words of importance to the work. They are normally alphabetized. The entries may consist of places and characters, which is common for longer works of fiction.
|-
| [[Bibliography]] || Author || This cites other works consulted when writing the body. It is most common in non-fiction books or research papers.
|-
| [[Index (publishing)|Index]] || Publisher || This list of terms used in the text contains references, often page numbers, to where the terms can be found in the text. Most common in non-fiction books.
|-
| [[Colophon (publishing)|Colophon]] || Publisher || This brief description may be located at the end of a book or on the verso of the title page. It describes production notes relevant to the edition and may include a printer's mark or logotype.
|-
| [[Postface]] || ||
|}

Arabic numbering continues for the back matter.

==Front cover, spine, and back cover of the dust-jacket==
[[File:bookspine.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Spine (bookbinding)|spine]] of the book is an important aspect in book design, especially in the cover design. When the books are stacked up or stored in a shelf, the details on the spine is the only visible surface that contains the information about the book. In a book store, it is often the details on the spine that attract the attention first.]]

The [[front cover]] is the front of the book, and is marked appropriately by text or graphics in order to identify it as such (namely as the very beginning of the book). The front cover usually contains at least the [[title]] or [[author]], with possibly an appropriate [[illustration]].

On the inside of the cover page, extending to the facing page is the front [[endpaper]] sometimes referred as FEP. The free half of the end paper is called a ''flyleaf''. Traditionally, in hand-bound books, the endpaper was just a sheet of blank or ornamented paper physically masking and reinforcing the connection between the cover and the body of the book. In modern [[publishing]] it can be either plain, as in many text-oriented books, or variously ornamented and illustrated in books such as [[picture book]]s, other children's literature, some [[handicraft|arts and craft]] and hobbyist books, novelty/gift-market and [[coffee table book]]s, and [[graphic novel]]s. These books have an audience and traditions of their own where the [[graphic design]] and immediacy is especially important and publishing tradition and formality are less important.

The [[spine (bookbinding)|spine]] is the vertical edge of a book as it normally stands on a [[bookshelf]]. It is customary for it to have printed text on it. In texts published or printed in the United States and the United Kingdom, the spine text, when vertical, runs from the top to the bottom, such that it is right side up when the book is lying flat with the front cover on top. In books from continental Europe, vertical spine text traditionally runs from the bottom up, though this convention has been changing lately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Book on the Bookshelf | author = Petroski, Henry | publisher = Alfred A. Knopf Inc | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-375-40649-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The spine usually contains all, or some, of four elements (besides decoration, if any), and in the following order: (1) author, editor, or compiler; (2) title; (3) publisher; and (4) publisher logo.

On the inside of the back cover page, extending from the facing page before it, is the endpaper. Its design matches the front endpaper and, in accordance with it, contains either plain paper or pattern, image etc.

The back cover often contains biographical matter about the author or editor, and quotes from other sources praising the book. It may also contain a summary or description of the book

==Binding==
{{Main article|Book binding}}
Books are classified under two categories according to the physical nature of their binding. The designation [[hardcover]] (or hardback) refers to books with [[Stiffness|stiff]] covers, as opposed to [[Flexibility|flexible]] ones. The binding of a hardcover book usually includes boards (often made of [[paperboard]]) covered in cloth, leather, or other materials. The binding is usually sewn to the pages using string stitching.

A less expensive binding method is that used for [[paperback]] books (sometimes called softback or softcover). Most paperbacks are bound with paper or light cardboard, though other materials (such as plastic) are used. The covers are flexible and usually bound to the pages using glue (perfect binding). Some small paperback books are sub-classified as pocketbooks. These paperbacks are smaller than usual—small enough to barely fit into a pocket (especially the back pocket of one's trousers). However, this capacity to fit into a pocket diminishes with increasing number of pages and increasing thickness of the book. Such a book may still be designated as a pocketbook.

==Other items==
Some books such as Bibles or dictionaries may have a [[thumb index]] to help find material quickly. Gold leaf may also be applied to the edges of the pages, so that when closed, the side, top, and bottom of the book have a golden color. On some books, a design may be printed on the edges, or marbling or a simple colour applied. Some [[artist's book]]s go even further, by using [[fore-edge painting]]. [[Pop-up book|Pop-up]] elements and fold-out pages may be used to add dimensions to the page in different ways. Children's books commonly incorporate a wide array of design features built into the fabric of the book. Some books for preschoolers include textured fabric, plastic on other materials. Die-cut techniques in the work of [[Eric Carle]] are one example. Clear or reflective surfaces, flaps, textiles and [[scratch-and-sniff]] are other possible features.

==Page spread==
{{See also|Page layout}}
[[File:Golden section in book design.svg|thumb|right|300px|Page spread with [[canons of page construction|J. A. van de Graaf's construction]] of classical text area (''print space'') and margin proportions.&lt;ref&gt;Van de Graaf, J. A.. ''Nieuwe berekening voor de vormgeving.'' (1946)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A basic unit in book design is the page spread. The left page (called ''[[verso]]'') and right page (called ''[[recto]]'') are of the same size and aspect ratio, and are centered on the gutter where they are bound together at the [[Bookbinding|spine]].

The design of each individual page, on the other hand, is governed by the [[canons of page construction]].

The possible layout of the sets of letters of the alphabet, or words, on a page is determined by the so-called print space, and is also an element in the design of the page of the book. Clearly, there must be sufficient space, at the [[Spine (bookbinding)|spine]] of the book, if the text is to be visible. On the other hand, the other three [[Margin (typography)|margins]] of the page, which frame the book, are made of the appropriate size for both practical and [[aesthetic]] reasons.

===Print space===
The print space (German ''Satzspiegel'') is a typographic term and determines the effective area on the paper of a book, journal or other press work. The print space is limited by the surrounding borders, or in other words the gutters outside the printed area.

The German term comes originally from [[hot metal typesetting|hot-metal typesetting]]: above the desktop was a mirror (German: ''Spiegel'') where the typesetter could read the inverted letters.

{{distinguish|text= the [[RAND Corporation]] Center for Middle East Public Policy}}
The '''Center for Middle East Policy''' (formerly the '''Saban Center for Middle East Policy''') is a center for research within the [[Brookings Institution]] focused on the United States' involvement in the [[Middle East]]. It was founded in May 2002 and according to its website, it "brings together the most experienced policy minds working on the region, and provides policymakers and the public with objective, in-depth and timely research and analysis. Our mission is to chart the path—political, economic and social—to a Middle East at peace with itself and the world."&lt;ref name="SabanAboutUs"&gt;{{cite news

==Creation==

===Funding===
The center was originally named after American-[[Israel]]i film and television producer [[Haim Saban]]. Saban, according to the center&lt;ref name="SabanAboutUs"/&gt; and its parent organization,&lt;ref name="BrookingsInstitute2002-02-09"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; "made a generous initial grant and pledged additional funds to endow the Center." According to a press release from Saban's charitable foundation,&lt;ref name="SabanFamilyFoundation2003-06-23"&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=2008-07-27
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saban "donated $13 million for the establishment of the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution." Saban, according to the center,&lt;ref name="SabanAboutUs"/&gt; ascribed his involvement to his "abiding interest in promoting [[Arab-Israeli peace]] and preserving American interests in the Middle East" that led him to fund the center.&lt;ref name="SabanAboutUs"/&gt; 

===Launch===
The center was launched in May 2002 "with a special address by His Majesty King [[Abdullah II bin al-Hussein]] of the Hashemite Kingdom of [[Jordan]] to a select audience of policymakers in Washington, D.C."&lt;ref name="SabanAboutUs"/&gt;

==Saban Forum==
The Center organizes the [[Saban Forum]], which gathers each winter since 2004. The forum is a group of government officials, academia researchers, journalists, and business leaders, mainly from the U.S., Israel and Palestine. The target of the forum is to discuss Middle East issues and U.S.-Israel relationships, exchange ideas and discuss solutions in an unofficial format and framework.

==Criticism==
Some critics have charged that various sources of funding for the center have influenced its outlook, but the center has dismissed such allegations, saying that in all cases the donors respected the center's independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Mediator Martin Indyk Describes Collapse of Peace Talks |url= http://forward.com/articles/206301/mediator-martin-indyk-describes-collapse-of-peace/ |author= Ron Kampeas |newspaper= The Forward |date= September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saban Center fellows ... often endorse the idea of a two-state settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. But Saban Center publications never question US support for Israel and rarely, if ever, offer significant criticism of key Israeli policies."&lt;ref&gt;The Israel Lobby and US Foreign Policy, John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen M Walt, Allen Lane (UK Edition), p176-7&lt;/ref&gt; Some Saban Center fellows have responded by criticizing the authors' scholarship and expansive definition of "Israel lobby." Martin Indyk stated that their "notion of a loosely aligned group of people that all happen to be working assiduously for Israel is indeed a cabal.... And this cabal includes anyone that has anything positive to say about Israel… And what does this cabal do? It ‘distorts’ American foreign policy, it ‘bends’ it, all these words are used to suggest that this cabal is doing something anti-American.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward.com/articles/4845/scholars-debate-eisrael-lobbye-article/#ixzz2RFkROuiL]&lt;/ref&gt; Another fellow wrote that the authors' book "will pale in comparison [to other academic works] because the only way it can become an esteemed classic is if its underlying thesis is correct: that a domestic political lobby drives U.S. policy in the Middle East. If that were true, then the ruckus raised by The Israeli Lobby would establish the book as a classic. But it isn’t true. Domestic politics and lobbying do matter when it comes to matters of tone and timing, but as [[Aaron David Miller]], a veteran American peace-process diplomat, puts it...: “I can’t remember a single decision of consequence American peace process advisers made, or one we didn’t, that was directly tied to some lobbyist’s call, letter, or pressure tactic.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2008/03/israel-rabinovich]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a September 17, 2014, article in [[Tablet (magazine)|''Tablet'']], [[Lee Smith (journalist)|Lee Smith]] criticized the center for accepting substantial donations from the Qatari government, "a foreign government that, in addition to its well-documented role as a funder of Sunni terror outfits throughout the Middle East, is the main patron of Hamas—which happens to be the mortal enemy of both the State of Israel and Mahmoud Abbas’ Fatah party." He suggested that the donations influenced the center's research analysis and Martin Indyk's statements as a State Department official and peace mediator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/184713/martin-indyk-qatar |title=How Peace Negotiator Martin Indyk Cashed a Big, Fat $14.8 Million Check From Qatar |author=Lee Smith |newspaper=Tablet |date=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brookings responded: "A review of publications and media appearances by our scholars in Doha and in Washington—all of which are available at Brookings.edu—demonstrate the same independence of thinking and objective, fact-based analysis about Qatar as on every other topic of our research. Our agreements with Qatar specifically protect the independence of our scholarship in all respects." Smith thanked the think tank for its response, but said it did "not satisfactorily address the key issues [his] article raises."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tabletmag.com/scroll/185831/brookings-responds-to-tablet-piece-on-qatar-funding |title=Brookings Responds to Tablet Piece on Qatar Funding |newspaper=Tablet |date=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''chief justice''' is the presiding member of a [[supreme court]] in any of many countries with a justice system based on English [[common law]], such as the [[Supreme Court of Bangladesh]], the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], the [[Supreme Court of Singapore]], the [[Court of Final Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong]], the [[Supreme Court of Japan]], the [[Supreme Court of India]], the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]], the [[Supreme Court of Nigeria]], the [[Supreme Court of Nepal]], the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa]], the [[Supreme Court of Ireland]], the [[Supreme Court of New Zealand]], the [[High Court of Australia]], the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], and provincial or state supreme courts. 

The situation is slightly different in the three legal jurisdictions within the United Kingdom.  The [[courts of England and Wales]] are headed by the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales]]; in [[Courts of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland's courts]], the equivalent position is the [[Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland]], and in the [[courts of Scotland]] the head of the [[judiciary of Scotland]] is the [[Lord President of the Court of Session]], who is also [[Lord Justice General|Lord Justice General of Scotland]]. These three judges are not, though, part of the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]], which operates across all three jurisdictions and is headed by the [[President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]].
 
The chief justice can be selected in many ways, but, in many nations, the position is given to the most senior justice of the court, while, in the United States, it is often the President's most important political nomination, subject to approval by the [[United States Senate]]. Although the title of this top American jurist is, by statute, [[Chief Justice of the United States]], the term "Chief Justice of the Supreme Court" is often used unofficially.

In some courts, the chief justice has a different title, e.g. [[President (corporate title)|president]] of the supreme court. In other courts, the title of chief justice is used, but the court has a different name, e.g. the [[Supreme Court of Judicature (Ceylon)|Supreme Court of Judicature]] in colonial (British) [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]], and the [[Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia]] (in the US state of [[West Virginia]]).

==Competence==
The Chief Justice's personal ruling is equal in weight to the rulings of any associate judges on the court.

In several countries, the chief justice is second in line to the office of president or governor general (or third in line, if there is a president or governor lieutenant governor general), should the incumbent die or resign. For example, if the [[Governor General of Canada]] is unable to perform his or her duties, the [[Chief Justice of Canada]] performs the duties of the governor general.

Apart from their intrinsic role in litigation, they may have additional responsibilities, such as [[swearing in]] high officers of state; for instance, the [[Chief Justice of the United States]] traditionally administers the oath of office at the [[inauguration]] ceremony of the [[President of the United States]], as does the [[Chief Justice of South Africa]] at the inauguration of the [[President of South Africa]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4305">With respect to [[cultural heritage]], '''conservation science''' is the interdisciplinary study of conservation of art, architecture, technical art history and other cultural works through the use of scientific inquiry.  General areas of research include the technology and structure of artistic and historic works; the materials and techniques from which cultural, artist and historic objects are made.

[[Conservation scientist (museums)|Conservation scientists]] use [[scientific methods]] and [[Scientific law|principles]] to support work in the fields of [[art conservation]] and [[architectural conservation]], and care of cultural objects in museums and other collections.  Cultural conservation science work includes identifying the materials that make up a structure or piece of art including their chemical makeup, identifying and cataloging changes that cause deterioration and developing methods to mitigate deterioration of cultural heritage.&lt;ref name=aic&gt;{{cite web|title=Defining the Conservator: Essential Competencies|url=http://www.conservation-us.org/docs/default-source/governance/defining-the-conservator-essential-competencies.pdf?sfvrsn=1|publisher=American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, including the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Italy]], conservation science is considered part of the broader field called '[[Heritage Science]]' which also encompasses scientific aspects less directly related to cultural heritage [[Art conservation|conservation]], as well its management and interpretation. 
&lt;!-- need history section when sources become available --&gt;

There are four broad categories of conservation science with respect to cultural heritage:  1) understanding the materials and techniques used by artists, 2) thorough examination and analysis, 3) study of the causes of deterioration, and 4) improving materials and techniques.  Conservation science includes aspects of [[chemistry]], [[physics]] and [[biology]] as well as [[engineering]].&lt;ref name=race&gt;{{cite book|last=Ward|first=Phillip|title=The Nature of Conservation: A Race Against Time|year=1986|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Marina del Rey, CA|isbn=0-941103-00-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Constantin Noica 3.jpg|thumb|Constantin Noica]]
[[File:Constantin Noica 2.jpg |thumb|Constantin Noica]]
'''Constantin Noica''' ({{IPA-ro|konstanˈtin ˈnojka|lang}}; {{OldStyleDate|July 25|1909|July 12}} – 4 December 1987) was a [[Romania]]n [[philosopher]], [[essayist]] and [[poet]]. His preoccupations were throughout all philosophy, from [[epistemology]], philosophy of culture, [[axiology]] and philosophic [[anthropology]] to [[ontology]] and [[logics]], from the history of philosophy to systematic philosophy, from ancient to contemporary philosophy, from translating and interpretation to criticism and creation. In 2006 he was included to the list of the [[100 Greatest Romanians]] of all time by a nationwide poll.

==Biography==
Noica was born in [[Vitănești]], [[Teleorman County]].

He studied at the Dimitrie Cantemir and Spiru Haret [[lyceum]]s, both in [[Bucharest]]. At Spiru Haret his math teacher was [[Dan Barbilian]] ([[pen name]] Ion Barbu, poet and mathematician). His debut was in ''Vlăstarul'' magazine, in 1927. Between 1928 and 1931 he attended courses of the [[University of Bucharest]]'s Faculty of Letters and Philosophy, where he graduated in 1931 (thesis: "Problema lucrului în sine la Kant" / "The matter of [[thing-in-itself]] in [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s philosophy"). Here he met as a teacher philosopher [[Nae Ionescu]].

He worked as a librarian at the History of Philosophy Seminar and attended the courses of the Faculty of Mathematics for one year (1933). He was a member of the ''Criterion'' Association (1932–1934). His friends there, including [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Mihail Polihroniade]], and [[Haig Acterian]], later supported the [[Iron Guard|Legionnaire Movement]].

After attending courses in [[France]] between 1938–1939 on a French government scholarship, he returned to Bucharest where in 1940 he earned his doctor's degree in philosophy (thesis: ''Sketch on the history of How is it that there is anything new'', published the same year).

In October 1940 he left for [[Berlin]] as a reviewer at [[Sextil Pușcariu]]'s Romanian-German Institute, returning in 1944, having stayed in Germany during most of [[World War II]].

After the war, the Soviet army remained in Romania, backing the establishment of a communist regime. Noica was harassed by the new regime.

In 1949 he was sentenced by the communist authorities to 10 years of forced residence in [[Câmpulung-Muscel]], remaining there until 1958. In December of that year, after making public the book "Histoire et Utopie" by Emil Cioran (who had left for France), he was sentenced to 25 years of forced labor in the [[Jilava]] prison as a political prisoner, and all his possessions confiscated.  He was pardoned after 6 years as part of a general amnesty and released in August 1964.

From 1965 he lived in Bucharest, where he was the principal researcher at the [[Romanian Academy]]'s Center of Logics. In his two-room apartment he held seminaries on [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s, [[Plato]]'s and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s philosophy. Among the participants there were [[Sorin Vieru]] (his colleague at the Center of Logics), [[Gabriel Liiceanu]] and [[Andrei Pleşu|Andrei Pleșu]].

In 1975 he retired and went to live in [[Păltiniş|Păltiniș]], near [[Sibiu]], where he remained for the next 12 years, until his death on 4 December 1987. He was buried at the nearby hermitage, having left behind numerous philosophical essays.

In 1988 Constantin Noica was posthumously awarded the [[Herder Prize]], and in 1990, after the fall of communism in Romania, he was accepted as a posthumous member of the [[Romanian Academy]].

==Philosophy==
The 20th century is thought to be dominated by [[science]]. The model of [[scientific knowledge]], which means transforming reality into formal and abstract concepts, is applied in judging the entire environment. This kind of thinking is called by Noica "the logic of Ares", as it considers the individual a simple variable in the Whole. The existence is, for this scientific way of considering things, a statistical fact.

In order to recover the individual senses, the sense of existence, Noica proposes, in opposition with "the logic of Ares", "the logic of Hermes", a way of thinking which considers the individual a reflection of the Whole. The logic of Hermes means understanding the Whole through the part, it means identifying in a single existence the general principles of reality. This way of thinking allows one to understand the meaning of the life of a man oppressed by the quick present moment.

Noica appreciates Greek and German philosophers, as well as several Romanian writers. He recommends to read philosophy, to learn classical languages, particularly ancient Greek, and modern languages, particularly German.&lt;ref&gt;Iţu, Mircia, "Conceptul de spirit la Constantin Noica raportat la Mircea Eliade" ("The Concept of Spirit in Constantin Noica's and in [[Mircea Eliade]]'s Vision"), in Manole, Georgică (2010), ''Lumină lină'', ''Luceafărul'', Botoşani [http://www.luceafarul.net/citind-%E2%80%A6-lumina-lina]. Retrieved on 7 June 2016. ISSN 2065-4200: "Noica talked to me about Greek philosophy, particularly [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]] and about German philosophy, particularly [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. I remember that philosopher Noica highlighted that one cannot have a personality if one does not read these authors. He said it, then he referred to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]. His face brightened when I had mentioned his name. The readings on Romanian culture are important, as well. Noica drove my attention towards writers, such as: [[Mihai Eminescu]], [[Titu Maiorescu]] and [[Lucian Blaga]], and particularly to authors who had been forbidden during the communist regime, such as the following: [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Emil Cioran]] and [[Mircea Vulcănescu]]. He insisted on the need for learning languages, emphasizing on the study of classical languages and especially ancient Greek, as well as modern languages, out of which he warmly recommended German".&lt;/ref&gt;

See here how Noica explains its use:&lt;br&gt;"If a nourishing plant, that we can not find elsewhere, would grow on the Romanian soil, we should have to answer for it. If words and meanings that can enrich man's soul appeared in our language, but they didn't appear in others speech or thought, we should also have to answer for them.&lt;br&gt;Such a word is ''întru''; such a meaning appears to be that of beingness. Actually, our peculiar understanding of beingness is, maybe, the result of the peculiar meanings of ''întru'', that came to seemingly express the beingness ''from within'', suggesting that «to be» means «to be into /''întru''/ something», that is to be, but not fully, in something, to rest but also to aspire, to close oneself but also to open oneself. In this way the beingness was pulled out from stillness and shook. But if it wouldn't be shaking, would it still be truly? What kind of beingness is the one that has no place for neither a vibration, nor an advance?".&lt;/ref&gt; vol. 1: ''Essay on traditional philosophy'', vol. 2: ''Treatise of [[ontology]]'' ("Devenirea întru ființă", vol. 1: "Încercare asupra filozofiei tradiționale", vol. 2: "Tratat de ontologie")

[[File:Earth oblateness to scale.svg|thumb|300px|A scale diagram of the [[oblateness]] of the 2003 [[IERS]] [[reference ellipsoid]]. The outer edge of the dark blue line is an [[ellipse]] with the same [[Eccentricity (mathematics)#Ellipses|eccentricity]] as that of Earth, with north at the top. For comparison, the light blue circle within has a diameter equal to the ellipse's [[minor axis]]. The red line represents the [[Karman line]] {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} above [[sea level]], while the yellow area denotes the [[apsis|altitude]] range of the [[International Space Station|ISS]] in [[low Earth orbit]].]]

An '''Earth ellipsoid''' is a mathematical figure approximating the  [[figure of the Earth|Earth's form]], used as a [[frame of reference|reference frame]] for computations in [[geodesy]], [[astronomy]], and the [[geoscience]]s. Various different [[ellipsoid]]s have been used as approximations.

It is an [[ellipsoid of revolution]] whose [[minor axis]] (shorter diameter), which connects the geographical [[North Pole]] and [[South Pole]], is approximately aligned with the Earth's axis of rotation. The ellipsoid is defined by the equatorial axis ''a'' and the polar axis ''b''; their difference is about 21&amp;nbsp;km, or 0.335%. Additional parameters are the [[probability mass function|mass function]] ''J2'', the correspondent [[gravity]] formula, and the rotation period (usually 86164 seconds).

Many methods exist for determination of the axes of an Earth ellipsoid, ranging from [[meridian arc]]s up to modern [[satellite geodesy]] or the analysis and interconnection of continental [[geodetic network]]s. Amongst the different set of data used in [[national survey]]s are several of special importance: the [[Bessel ellipsoid]] of 1841, the international [[Hayford ellipsoid]] of 1924, and (for [[GPS]] positioning) the [[WGS84]] ellipsoid.

== ''Mean'' Earth ellipsoid and ''reference'' ellipsoids ==
{{further|Reference ellipsoid}}
A data set which describes the global [[average]] of the Earth's surface curvature is called the ''mean'' Earth Ellipsoid. It refers to a theoretical coherence between the [[geographic latitude]] and the meridional curvature of the [[geoid]]. The latter is close to the [[mean sea level]], and therefore an ideal Earth ellipsoid has the same [[volume]] as the geoid.

While the ''mean'' Earth ellipsoid is the ideal basis of global geodesy, for [[regional]] networks a so-called ''reference ellipsoid'' may be the better choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Alexander | first1 = J. C. | title = The Numerics of Computing Geodetic Ellipsoids | doi = 10.1137/1027056 | journal = SIAM Review | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 241 | year = 1985 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; When geodetic measurements have to be computed on a mathematical reference surface, this surface should have a similar curvature as the regional geoid - otherwise, [[reduction (mathematics)|reduction]] of the measurements will get small distortions.

This is the reason for the "long life" of former reference ellipsoids like the [[Hayford ellipsoid|Hayford]] or the [[Bessel ellipsoid]], despite the fact that their main axes deviate by several hundred meters from the modern values. Another reason is a judicial one: the [[coordinate]]s of millions of boundary stones should remain fixed for a long period. If their reference surface changes, the coordinates themselves also change.

However, for [[international]] networks, [[GPS]] positioning, or [[astronautics]], these regional reasons are less relevant. As knowledge of [[figure of the Earth|the Earth's figure]] is increasingly accurate, the International Geoscientific Union [[IUGG]] usually adapts the axes of the Earth ellipsoid to the best available data.

==Historical method of determining the ellipsoid==

High precision land surveys can be used to determine the distance between two places at nearly the same longitude by measuring a base line and a chain of triangles. (Suitable stations for the end points are rarely at the same longitude). The distance Δ along the meridian from one end point to a point at the same latitude as the second end point is then calculated by trigonometry. The surface distance Δ is reduced to Δ', the corresponding distance at [[mean sea level]]. The intermediate distances to points on the meridian at the same latitudes as other stations of the survey may also be calculated.

The geographic latitudes of both end points, φ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; (standpoint) and φ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; (forepoint) and possibly at other points are  determined  by [[astrogeodesy]], observing the [[zenith distance]]s of sufficient numbers of [[star]]s. If latitudes are measured at end points only, the radius of curvature at the midpoint of the meridian arc can be calculated from  R = Δ'/(|φ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;-φ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;|). A second meridian arc will allow the  derivation of two parameters required to specify a [[reference ellipsoid]]. Longer arcs with intermediate latitude determinations can completely determine the ellipsoid. In practice multiple arc measurements are used to determine the ellipsoid parameters by the method of least squares. The parameters determined are usually the semi-major axis, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, and either  the semi-minor axis, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, or the [[inverse flattening]]  &lt;math&gt;1/f&lt;/math&gt;, (where the flattening is &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;f=(a-b)/a&lt;/math&gt;).

[[Geodesy]] no longer uses simple meridian arcs, but complex [[wikt:network|networks]] with hundreds of [[Benchmark (surveying)|fixed points]] linked by the methods of [[satellite geodesy]].

== Historical Earth ellipsoids ==
The reference ellipsoid models listed below have had utility in geodetic work and many are still in use. The older ellipsoids are named for the individual who derived them and the year of development is given. In 1887 the English surveyor Colonel [[Alexander Ross Clarke]] CB FRS RE was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Society for his work in determining the figure of the Earth. The international ellipsoid was developed by [[John Fillmore Hayford]] in 1910 and adopted by the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) in 1924, which recommended it for international use.

At the 1967 meeting of the IUGG held in Lucerne, Switzerland, the ellipsoid called GRS-67 ([[Geodetic system|Geodetic Reference System]] 1967) in the listing was recommended for adoption.  The new ellipsoid was not recommended to replace the International Ellipsoid (1924), but was advocated for use where a greater degree of accuracy is required. It became a part of the GRS-67 which was approved and adopted at the 1971 meeting of the IUGG held in Moscow. It is used in Australia for the Australian Geodetic Datum and in South America for the South American Datum 1969.

The GRS-80 (Geodetic Reference System 1980) as approved and adopted by the IUGG at its Canberra, Australia meeting of 1979 is based on the equatorial radius (semi-major axis of Earth ellipsoid) &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, total mass &lt;math&gt;GM&lt;/math&gt;, dynamic form factor &lt;math&gt;J_2&lt;/math&gt; and angular velocity of rotation &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, making the inverse flattening &lt;math&gt;1/f&lt;/math&gt; a derived quantity. The minute difference in &lt;math&gt;1/f&lt;/math&gt; seen between GRS-80 and WGS-84 results from an unintentional  truncation in the latter's defining constants: while the WGS-84 was designed to adhere closely to the GRS-80, incidentally the WGS-84 derived flattening turned out to be slightly different than the GRS-80 flattening because the normalized second degree zonal harmonic gravitational coefficient, that was derived from the GRS-80 value for J2, was truncated to 8 significant digits in the normalization process.&lt;ref&gt;NIMA Technical Report TR8350.2, "Department of Defense World Geodetic System 1984, Its Definition and Relationships With Local Geodetic Systems", Third Edition, 4 July 1997 [http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/publications/tr8350.2/wgs84fin.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

An ellipsoidal model describes only the ellipsoid's geometry and a [[normal gravity]] field formula to go with it. Commonly an ellipsoidal model is part of a more encompassing [[datum (geodesy)|geodetic datum]]. For example, the older ED-50 ([[ED50|European Datum 1950]]) is based on the Hayford or [[International Ellipsoid]]. WGS-84 is peculiar in that the same name is used for both the complete geodetic reference system and its component ellipsoidal model. Nevertheless, the two concepts—ellipsoidal model and geodetic reference system—remain distinct.

Note that the same ellipsoid may be known by different names. It is best to mention the defining constants for unambiguous identification.

'''Environmental consulting''' is often a form of [[compliance (regulation)|compliance]] [[Consultant|consulting]], in which the consultant ensures that the client maintains an appropriate measure of compliance with [[environmental regulation]]s. There are many types of environmental consultants, but the two main groups are those who enter the field from the industry side, and those who enter the field from the [[environmentalist]] side.

Environmental consultants work in a very wide variety of fields. Whether it be providing [[construction]] services such as [[Asbestos]] Hazard Assessments or Lead Hazard Assessments or conducting due [[diligence]] reports for customers to rid them of possible sanctions. Consultancies may generalize across a wide range of disciplines or specialize in certain areas of environmental consultancy such as [[waste management]].

Environmental consultants usually have an [[undergraduate degree]] and sometimes even [[master's degree]] in [[Environmental Engineering]], [[Environmental Science]], [[Environmental Studies]], [[Geology]], or some other science discipline. They should have deep knowledge on environmental regulations, which they can advise particular clients in the private industry or public government institutions to help them steer clear of possible fines, legal action or misguided transactions.

Environmental consulting spans a wide spectrum of industry. The most basic industry that environmental consulting remains prominent in is the commercial estate market. Many commercial lenders rely on both small and large environmental firms. Many commercial lenders will not lend monies to borrowers if the property or personal capital does not exceed the worth of the land. If an environmental problem is discovered property owners that deem themselves a responsible party will most likely reserve monies in escrow in order to resolve the environmental impact.

With increasing numbers of construction, [[agriculture]], and scientific companies employing environmental consultancies, the industry can expect growth in the vicinity of 9.7 percent in 2008, amidst mounting public concern over [[environmental degradation]] and climate change. And while some companies are genuinely motivated by concern for the environment, for others, hiring consultants to appear to be "going green" has proven to be a useful marketing tool. Growing government funding into renewable energy and technologies producing low emissions is also helping growth, as organizations investing in research and development in these areas are often major employers of environmental consultants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bio-medicine.org/biology-technology-1/The-Recession-List---Top-10-Industries-to-Fly-and-Flop-in-2008-4076-4/ The Recession List - Top 10 Industries to Fly and Fl... (or growth together with growth inNorth A...)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subdisciplines==

There are numerous areas in which environmental consultants might work (in no particular order):

'''Contaminated Land''' is one area as mentioned above. [[Contaminated land|Contaminated Land]] this may well involve a [[Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment]]

'''Energy''' may entail feasibility studies for renewable energy projects. For example, a study may attempt to answer the question: Would a micro-hydro-generation scheme pay for itself over the course of its operational life?

'''Geotechnical''' may also be covered by Environmental Consultants, this might include activities such as [[site investigation]]s, geotechnical engineering (foundation design, slope stability), and restoration [[quality assurance]].

'''Environmental Management Systems''' such as [[ISO 14001]] are large complicated systems that are often not implemented using internal man/woman power. This work is usually outsourced to consultants.

'''Green Claims''' Environmental Consultants may be employed to substantiate green claims, such as eco labels, which may involve work on supply chain or embodied carbon.

'''Compliance''' As governments become more and more environmental in their thinking, so does their legal framework. In the UK, businesses are covered by numerous pieces of legislation such as oil storage regulations and The Environment Act. If they are found to be in breach of these regulations they may face severe civil or criminal actions. Environmental Consultants can check to see that the business in question is in compliance with current legislation.

'''Impact Assessment''' see [[Environmental impact statement]]

'''[[Flood risk assessment|Flood Risk]]''', the most common of which may be a Phase 1 Screening Study.

'''[[Asbestos]] Management'''

'''[[Radon]]'''

'''Carbon''' there are various aspects of a company's carbon foot print that may be managed by consultants. They may have internal reduction strategies, or they may be tied in with national targets. Emissions trading is also an important aspect of Carbon Management.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5309">'''Furskins''' was a series of plush toy bears in different sizes and guises created by [[Xavier Roberts]] in the 1980s. Furskins are a highly collectible item, yet are not as highly sought by collectors as Robert's most notable creation [[Cabbage Patch Kids]].

==Background==
Created by Xavier Roberts, Furskins were produced by Panosh Place, Roberts’s Original Appalachian Artworks and [[Coleco]] from 1983 to the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.justcollecting.com/miscellania/xavier-roberts-furskins|title=Xavier Roberts Furskins|work=JustCollecting|access-date=2017-07-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Furskins Bear Series==
Each Furskins Bear had its own unique attire, name and character background story in the valley of Moody Hollow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=ghostofthedoll|title=Furskins :: Commercial 1|date=2010-04-26|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUkYRR69pQg&amp;sns=em|accessdate=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bear sizes were styled into two main types, with a novel third. A set of 8 original five-inch posable bears began the series, followed by a second set of 8 five-inch posable bears out of popular demand. A subsequent set of 16 twenty two-inch bears were created as the demand for the toy grew. The Furskins series was rounded out by the addition of 6 small bears.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ghostofthedoll.co.uk/furskins.php|title=Furskins {{!}} Ghost of the Doll|website=www.ghostofthedoll.co.uk|access-date=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four special collectible bears were created for and sold at Wendy's for $1.99 during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=ghostofthedoll|title=Furskins :: Commercial 2|date=2010-04-26|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zmh6qTY9ASs&amp;sns=em|accessdate=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Additional clothing was available for Furskins, as were playsets, for collectors to own. Playsets included the Moody Hollow Express and Moody Hollow General Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ghostofthedoll.co.uk/furskins-playsets.php|title=Furskins :: Playsets {{!}} Ghost of the Doll|website=www.ghostofthedoll.co.uk|access-date=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Health Alert Network ''' ('''HAN''') is a program under the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] which is an agency of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]. The HAN project is intended to "ensure that each community has rapid and timely access to emergent health information; a cadre of highly-trained professional personnel; and evidence-based practices and procedures for effective public health preparedness, response, and service on a 24/7 basis."

Currently, HAN is a strong national program, providing vital health information and the infrastructure to support the dissemination of that information at the state and local levels, and beyond. A vast majority of the State-based HAN programs have over 90% of their population covered under the umbrella of HAN. The HAN Messaging System currently directly and indirectly transmits Health Alerts, Advisories, and Updates to over one million recipients. The current system is being phased into the overall PHIN messaging component.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2a.cdc.gov/han/Index.asp Health Alert Network - Home Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dioscorides De Materia Medica Byzantium 15th century.jpg|thumb|375px|right|Dioscorides' ''[[De Materia Medica (Dioscorides)|De Materia Medica]]'', [[Byzantium]], 15th-century manuscript, by which time the text had been in circulation for about 1500 years]]

A '''herbal''' is a book containing the names and descriptions of plants, usually with information on their medicinal, [[Herbal tonic|tonic]], [[culinary]], [[toxic]], [[hallucinatory]], [[aromatic]], or [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] powers, and the [[legend]]s associated with them.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a4&gt;Arber, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  A herbal may also classify the plants it describes,&lt;ref&gt;Leyel, in Grieve. p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; may give recipes for [[Extract|herbal extract]]s, [[tincture]]s, or [[potion]]s, and sometimes include [[mineral]] and animal [[medicament]]s in addition to those obtained from plants. Herbals were often illustrated to assist [[plant identification]].&lt;ref name="Anderson, p. 2"&gt;Anderson, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbals were among the first literature produced in [[Ancient Egypt]], China, India, and Europe&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, pp. 1–26.&lt;/ref&gt; as the medical wisdom of the day accumulated by [[Herbalism|herbalist]]s, [[apothecary|apothecaries]] and [[physician]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, pp. 7–8, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Herbals were also among the first books to be printed in both China and Europe. In Western Europe herbals flourished for two centuries following the introduction of moveable type (c. 1470–1670).&lt;ref&gt;See Arber, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 17th century, the rise of modern [[chemistry]], [[toxicology]] and [[pharmacology]] reduced the medicinal value of the classical herbal.  As reference manuals for [[botany|botanical]] study and plant identification herbals were supplanted by [[Flora]]s&amp;nbsp;– systematic accounts of the plants found growing in a particular region, with scientifically accurate botanical descriptions, [[Biological classification|classification]], and illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, pp. 115–164.&lt;/ref&gt; Herbals have seen a modest revival in the [[western world]] since the last decades of the 20th century, as [[herbalism]] and related disciplines (such as [[homeopathy]] and [[aromatherapy]]) became popular forms of [[alternative medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;See Andrews, 1982, pp. 277–296.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The word ''herbal'' is derived from the [[mediaeval Latin]] ''liber herbalis'' ("book of herbs"):&lt;ref name=a4 /&gt; it is sometimes used in contrast to the word ''[[florilegium]]'', which is a treatise on flowers&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; with emphasis on their beauty and enjoyment rather than the herbal emphasis on their utility.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt &amp; Raphael, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the information found in printed herbals arose out of [[traditional medicine]] and herbal knowledge that predated the invention of writing.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, pp. 7–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the advent of printing, herbals were produced as [[manuscript]]s, which could be kept as [[scroll]]s or loose sheets, or bound into [[codex|codices]].&lt;ref&gt;Blunt &amp; Raphael, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Early handwritten herbals were often illustrated with paintings and drawings. Like other manuscript books, herbals were "published" through repeated copying by hand, either by professional scribes or by the readers themselves.  In the process of making a copy, the copyist would often translate, expand, adapt, or reorder the content.  Most of the original herbals have been lost; many have survived only as later copies (of copies...), and others are known only through references from other texts.&lt;ref&gt;Arber, pp. 271–285.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, pp. 189–235.&lt;/ref&gt;

As printing became available, it was promptly used to publish herbals, the first printed matter being known as [[incunabula]]. In Europe, the first printed herbal with [[woodcut]] (xylograph) illustrations, the ''Puch der Natur'' of [[Konrad of Megenberg]], appeared in 1475.&lt;ref name="Blunt &amp; Raphael, p. 113"&gt;Blunt &amp; Raphael, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Metal-engraved plates were first used in about 1580.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt &amp; Raphael, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; As woodcuts and metal engravings could be reproduced indefinitely they were traded among printers: there was therefore a large increase in the number of illustrations together with an improvement in quality and detail but a tendency for repetition.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

As examples of some of the world's most important records and first printed matter, researchers will find herbals scattered through the world's most famous libraries including the [[Vatican Library]] in Rome, the [[Bodleian Library]] in Oxford, the [[Royal Library, Windsor|Royal Library]] in Windsor, the [[British Library]] in London and the major continental libraries.

==China, India, Mexico==

===Shen Nung Pen Ts’ao ching of China===
{{further|Chinese herbology|Chinese Herbal Medicine}}
China is renowned for its traditional herbal medicines that date back thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;See Tang, W. &amp; Eisenbrand, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Unschuld, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Legend has it that mythical Emperor [[Shennong]], the founder of Chinese herbal medicine, composed the ''[[Shennong Bencao Jing]]'' or ''Great Herbal'' in about 2700 BCE as the forerunner of all later Chinese herbals.&lt;ref&gt;Keys, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; It survives as a copy made c. 500 CE and describes about 365 herbs.&lt;ref&gt;See Hong-Yen Hsu, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; High quality herbals and [[monograph]]s on particular plants were produced in the period to 1250 CE including: the ''Zhenlei bencao'' written by Tang Shenwei in 1108, which passed through twelve editions until 1600; a monograph on the [[lychee]] by Cai Xiang in 1059 and one on the oranges of Wenzhhou by Han Yanzhi in 1178.&lt;ref&gt;Reed pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1406 [[Ming dynasty]] prince Zhu Xiao (朱橚) published the ''[[Jiuhuang Bencao]]'' illustrated herbal for [[famine food]]s. It contained high quality woodcuts and descriptions of 414 species of plants of which 276 were described for the first time, the book pre-dating the first European printed book by 69 years.  It was reprinted many times.&lt;ref&gt;Read, pp. 74–76.&lt;/ref&gt; Other herbals include ''Bencao Fahui'' in 1450 by Xu Yong and ''Bencao Gangmu'' of Li Shizhen in 1590.&lt;ref&gt;Woodland, p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sushruta Samhita of India===
{{further|Sushruta Samhita|Ayurveda}}
Traditional herbal medicine of India, known as Ayurveda, possibly dates back to the second millennium BCE tracing its origins to the holy [[Hindu]] [[Vedas]] and, in particular, the [[Atharvaveda]].&lt;ref&gt;See Wujastyk, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; One authentic compilation of teachings is by the surgeon [[Sushruta]], available in a treatise called Sushruta Samhita. This contains 184 chapters and description of 1120 illnesses, 700 medicinal plants, 64 preparations from mineral sources and 57 preparations based on animal sources.&lt;ref&gt;See Dwivedi et al., 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Other early works of Ayurveda include the ''[[Charaka Samhita]]'', attributed to [[Charaka]]. This tradition, however is mostly oral. The earliest surviving written material which contains the works of Sushruta is the ''[[Bower Manuscript]]''—dated to the 4th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Kutumbian, pp. XXXII-XXXIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hernandez – ''Rerum Medicarum'' and the Aztecs===
An illustrated herbal published in Mexico in 1552, ''[[Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis]]'' ("Book of Medicinal Herbs of the Indies"), is written in the [[Aztec]] [[Nauhuatl]] language by a native physician, [[Martín Cruz (herbal author)|Martín Cruz]]. This is probably an extremely early account of the medicine of the Aztecs although the formal illustrations, resembling European ones, suggest that the artists were following the traditions of their Spanish masters rather than an indigenous style of drawing.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1570 Francisco Hernández (c.1514–1580) was sent from Spain to study the natural resources of New Spain (now Mexico). Here he drew on indigenous sources, including the extensive botanical gardens that had been established by the Aztecs, to record c. 1200 plants in his ''Rerum Medicarum'' of 1615. [[Nicolás Monardes]]’ ''Dos Libros'' (1569) contains the first published illustration of tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;Arber, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece and Rome==

{{further|Ancient Egyptian medicine|Ancient Greek medicine|Medicine in ancient Rome}}
By about 2000 BCE, medical [[papyrus|papyri]] in ancient Egypt included medical prescriptions based on plant matter and made reference to the herbalist's combination of medicines and magic for healing.&lt;ref name=s15&gt;Stuart, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Papyrus Ebers===
{{Main article|Papyrus Ebers}}
[[File:ebers7766.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A page from the [[Ebers Papyrus]], the most complete and extensive of surviving ancient herbals]]
The ancient Egyptian Papyrus Ebers is one of the earliest known herbals; it dates to 1550 BCE and is based on sources, now lost, dating back a further 500 to 2000 years.&lt;ref name="Anderson, p. 2"/&gt; The earliest [[Sumer]]ian herbal dates from about 2500 BCE as a copied manuscript of the 7th century BCE. Inscribed [[Assyria]]n tablets dated 668–626 BCE list about 250 vegetable drugs: the tablets include herbal plant names that are still in use today including: [[saffron]], [[cumin]], [[turmeric]] and [[sesame]].&lt;ref name=s15 /&gt;

The ancient Greeks gleaned much of their medicinal knowledge from Egypt and Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name=s15 /&gt; [[Hippocrates]] (460–377 BCE), the "father of medicine" (renowned for the eponymous [[Hippocratic oath]]), used about 400 drugs, most being of plant origin. However, the first Greek herbal of any note was written by [[Diocles of Carystus]] in the fourth century BC—although nothing remains of this except its mention in the written record. It was [[Aristotle]]’s pupil [[Theophrastus]] (371–287 BCE) in his ''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Historia Plantarum]]'', (better known as the ''Enquiry into Plants'') and ''De Causis Plantarum'' (''On the Causes of Plants'') that established the scientific method of careful and critical observation associated with modern botanical science. Based largely on Aristotle’s notes, the Ninth Book of his ''Enquiry'' deals specifically with medicinal herbs and their uses including the recommendations of herbalists and druggists of the day, and his plant descriptions often included their natural habitat and geographic distribution.&lt;ref name=s17&gt;Stuart, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; With the formation of the [[Alexandrian School]] c. 330 BCE medicine flourished and written herbals of this period included those of the physicians [[Herophilus]], [[Mantias]], Andreas of Karystos, Appolonius Mys, and [[Nicander]].&lt;ref name=s17 /&gt; The work of rhizomatist (the rhizomati were the doctors of the day, berated by Theophrastus for their superstition) Krateuas ([[floruit|fl.]] 110 BCE) is of special note because he initiated the tradition of the illustrated herbal in the first century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nsa&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tiltman, John H.|date=Summer 1967|title=The Voynich Manuscript: "The Most Mysterious Manuscript in the World"|volume=XII|number=3|publisher=NSA Technical Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dioscorides – ''De Materia Medica''===
[[File:Arabic herbal medicine guidebook.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|Arabic Book of Simple Drugs (c. 1334) from Dioscorides’ ''De Materia Medica''. [[British Museum]]]]

{{Main article|De Materia Medica (Dioscorides)}}
The ''[[De Materia Medica (Dioscorides)|De Materia Medica]]'' (c. 40–90 CE; Greek, Περί ύλης ιατρικής "Peri hules iatrikes", 'On medical materials') of [[Dioscorides|Pedanios Dioscorides]], a physician in the Roman army, was produced in about 65 CE. It was the single greatest classical authority on the subject and the most influential herbal ever written,&lt;ref name="Anderson, p. 3"&gt;Anderson, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; serving as a model for herbals and pharmacopoeias, both oriental and occidental, for the next 1000 years up to the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;Singer, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; It drew together much of the accumulated herbal knowledge of the time, including some 500 medicinal plants. The original has been lost but a lavishly illustrated [[Byzantine]] copy known as the ''[[Vienna Dioscurides]]'' dating from about 512 CE remains.&lt;ref&gt;Arber, pp. 1–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pliny – ''Natural History''===
{{Main article|Natural History (Pliny)}}

[[Pliny the Elder]]'s (23–79 CE) encyclopaedic ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (c. 77–79 CE) is a synthesis of the information contained in about 2000 scrolls and it includes myths and folklore; there are about 200 extant copies. It comprises 37 books of which sixteen (Books 12–27) are devoted to trees, plants and medicaments and, of these, seven describe medicinal plants. In medieval herbals, along with ''De Materia Medica'' it is Pliny's work that is the most frequently mentioned of the classical texts, even though [[Galen]]'s (131–201 CE) ''De Simplicibus'' is more detailed.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Another Latin translation of Greek works that was widely copied in the Middle Ages, probably illustrated in the original, was that attributed to [[Apuleius]]: it also contained the alternative names for particular plants given in several languages. It dates to about 400 CE and a surviving copy dates to about 600 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Middle Ages and Arab World==
{{further|Medicine in the medieval Islamic world}}

During the 600 years of the European Middle Ages from 600 to 1200, the tradition of herbal lore fell to the [[monastery|monasteries]]. Many of the monks were skilled at producing books and manuscripts and tending both medicinal gardens and the sick, but written works of this period simply emulated those of the classical era.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in the Arab world, by 900 the great Greek herbals had been translated and copies lodged in centres of learning in the [[Byzantine empire]] of the eastern Mediterranean including Byzantium, Damascus, Cairo and Baghdad where they were combined with the botanical and pharmacological lore of the Orient.&lt;ref name="Stuart, p. 19"&gt;Stuart, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], [[Muslim Agricultural Revolution|Muslim botanists]] and [[Islamic medicine|Muslim physicians]] made a major contribution to the knowledge of herbal medicines. Those associated with this period include [[Masawaiyh|Mesue Maior]] (Masawaiyh, 777–857) who, in his ''Opera Medicinalia'', synthesised the knowledge of Greeks, Persians, Arabs, Indians and Babylonians, this work was complemented by the medical encyclopaedia of [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina, 980–1037).&lt;ref&gt;Greene, pp. 433–443.&lt;/ref&gt; Avicenna’s ''Canon of Medicine'' was used for centuries in both East and West.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period Islamic science protected classical botanical knowledge that had been ignored in the West and Muslim pharmacy thrived.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albertus Magnus – ''De Vegetabilibus''===
[[File:AlbertusMagnus.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Albertus Magnus]] c.&amp;nbsp;1193–1280, author of ''De&amp;nbsp;Vegetabilibus'']]
{{Main article|Albertus Magnus}}

In the thirteenth century, scientific inquiry was returning and this was manifest through the production of encyclopaedias; those noted for their plant content included a seven volume treatise by Albertus Magnus (c. 1193–1280) a Suabian educated at the University of Padua and tutor to [[St Thomas Aquinas]]. It was called ''De Vegetabilibus'' (c. 1256 AD) and even though based on original observations and plant descriptions it bore a close resemblance to the earlier Greek, Roman and Arabic herbals.&lt;ref&gt;Arber, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Other accounts of the period include ''De Proprietatibus Rerum'' (c. 1230–1240) of English Franciscan monk [[Bartholomaeus Anglicus]] and a group of herbals called ''Tractatus de Herbis'' written and pained between 1280 and 1300 by [[Matthaeus Platearius]] at the East-West cultural centre of Salerno Spain, the illustrations showing the fine detail of true botanical illustration.&lt;ref&gt;Pavord, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western Europe==
[[File:Elizabeth Blackwell00.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Illustration from [[Elizabeth Blackwell (illustrator)|Elizabeth Blackwell]]'s ''A Curious Herbal'' (1737)]]

Perhaps the best known herbals were produced in Europe between 1470 and 1670.&lt;ref&gt;Arber, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The invention in Germany of printing from movable type in a printing press c. 1440 was a great stimulus to herbalism. The new herbals were more detailed with greater general appeal and often with Gothic script and the addition of woodcut illustrations that more closely resembled the plants being described.

Three important herbals, all appearing before 1500, were printed in Mainz, Germany. Two of these were by [[Peter Schoeffer]], his Latin ''Herbarius'' in 1484, followed by an updated and enlarged German version in 1485, these being followed in 1491 by the ''Hortus Sanitatis'' printed by [[Jacob Meyderbach]].&lt;ref&gt;Raphael, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Other early printed herbals include the ''Kreuterbuch'' of [[Hieronymus Tragus]] from Germany in 1539 and, in England, the ''New Herball'' of William Turner in 1551 were arranged, like the classical herbals, either alphabetically, according to their medicinal properties, or as "herbs, shrubs, trees".&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Arrangement of plants in later herbals such as ''Cruydboeck'' of [[Dodoens]] and John Gerard’s ''Herball'' of 1597 became more related to their physical similarities and this heralded the beginnings of scientific [[classification (biology)|classification]]. By 1640 a herbal had been printed that included about 3800 plants – nearly all the plants of the day that were known.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Modern Age]] and [[Renaissance]], European herbals diversified and innovated, and came to rely more on direct observation than being mere adaptations of traditional models. Typical examples from the period are the fully illustrated ''De Historia Stirpium Commentarii Insignes'' by [[Leonhart Fuchs]] (1542, with over 400 plants), the [[astrology|astrologically]] themed ''[[Complete Herbal]]'' by [[Nicholas Culpeper]] (1653), and the ''Curious Herbal'' by [[Elizabeth Blackwell (illustrator)|Elizabeth Blackwell]] (1737).

===Anglo-Saxon herbals===
Anglo-Saxon plant knowledge and gardening skills (the garden was called a ''wyrtzerd'', literally, herb-yard) appears to have exceeded that on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Our limited knowledge of [[Anglo-Saxon]] plant vernacular comes primarily from manuscripts that include: the [[Bald's Leechbook|Leechbook of Bald]] and the [[Lacnunga]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The Leechbook of Bald (Bald was probably a friend of [[King Alfred]] of England) was painstakingly produced by the scribe Cild in about 900–950 CE. This was written in the [[vernacular]] (native) tongue and not derived from Greek texts.&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, pp. 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest illustrated herbal from Saxon times is a translation of the Latin ''Herbarius Apulei Platonici'', one of the most popular medical works of medieval times, the original dating from the fifth century; this Saxon translation was produced about 1000–1050 CE and is housed in the British Library.&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Another vernacular herbal was the ''Buch der natur'' or "Book of Nature" by [[Konrad von Megenberg]] (1309–1374) which contains the first two botanical woodcuts ever made; it is also the first work of its kind in the vernacular.&lt;ref name="Blunt &amp; Raphael, p. 113"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stuart, p. 19"/&gt;

===Anglo-Norman herbals===
In the 12th and early 13th centuries, under the influence of the [[Norman conquest]], the herbals produced in Britain fell less under the influence of France and Germany and more that of Sicily and the Near East. This showed itself through the [[Byzantine]]-influenced [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] framed illustrations. Anglo-Saxon herbals in the vernacular were replaced by herbals in Latin including Macers Herbal, ''De Viribus Herbarum'' (largely derived from Pliny), with the English translation completed in about 1373.&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fifteenth-century incunabula===
The earliest printed books and broadsheets are known as [[incunabula]]. The first printed herbal appeared in 1469, a version of Pliny's ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Historia Naturalis]]''; it was published nine years before Dioscorides ''De Materia Medica'' was set in type.&lt;ref name="Anderson, p. 3"/&gt; Important incunabula include the encyclopaedic ''De Proprietatibus Rerum'' of [[Franciscan]] monk [[Bartholomew Anglicus]] (c. 1203–1272) which, as a manuscript, had first appeared between 1248 and 1260 in at least six languages and after being first printed in 1470 ran to 25 editions.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt;  Assyrian physician [[Mesue]] (926–1016) wrote the popular ''De Simplicibus'', ''Grabadin'' and ''Liber Medicinarum Particularum'' the first of his printings being in 1471. These were followed, in Italy, by the ''Herbarium'' of [[Pseudo-Apuleius|Apuleius Platonicus]] and three German works published in Mainz, the ''Latin Herbarius'' (1484), the first herbal published in Germany, ''German Herbarius'' (1485), the latter evolving into the ''[[Ortus Sanitatis]]'' (1491). To these can be added [[Aemilius Macer|Macer]]’s ''De Virtutibus Herbarum'', based on Pliny's work; the 1477 edition is one of the first printed and illustrated herbals.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt &amp; Raphael, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fifteenth-century manuscripts===
In medieval times, medicinal herbs were generally referred to by the apothecaries (physicians or doctors) as "[[herb|simple]]s" or "[[officinal]]s". Before 1542, the works principally used by apothecaries were the treatises on simples by [[Avicenna]] and [[Serapion the Younger|Serapion]]’s ''Liber De Simplici Medicina''. The ''De Synonymis'' and other publications of Simon Januensis, the ''Liber Servitoris'' of Bulchasim Ben Aberazerim, which described the preparations made from plants, animals and minerals, provided a model for the chemical treatment of modern pharmacopoeias. There was also the ''[[Antidotarium Nicolai]]'' of Nicolaus de Salerno, which contained [[Galen]]ical compounds arranged in alphabetical order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Pharmacopoeia |volume=21 |page=353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain and Portugal – de Orta, Monardes, Hernandez===
The Spaniards and Portuguese were explorers, the Portuguese to India ([[Vasco da Gama]]) and Goa where physician [[Garcia de Orta]] (1490–1570) based his work ''Coloquios dos Simples'' (1563). The first botanical knowledge of the [[New World]] came from Spaniard [[Nicolas Monardes]] (1493–1588) who published ''Dos Libros'' between 1569 and 1571.&lt;ref&gt;Arber, pp. 104–108.&lt;/ref&gt; The work of Hernandez on the herbal medicine of the Aztecs has already been discussed.

===Germany – Bock, Brunfels and Fuchs===
{{further|Hans Weiditz}}
[[File:Otto Brunfels01.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Hans Weiditz]] hand-coloured woodcut from [[Otto Brunfels]]' ''Herbarum Vivae Eicones'']]

[[Otto Brunfels]] (c. 1489–1534), [[Leonhart Fuchs]] (1501–1566)  and [[Hieronymus Bock]] (1498–1554) were known as the "German fathers of botany"&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; although this title belies the fact that they trod in the steps of the scientifically feted [[Hildegard of Bingen]] whose writings on herbalism were ''Physica'' and ''Causae et Curae'' (together known as ''Liber subtilatum'') of 1150. The original manuscript is no longer in existence but a copy was printed in 1533.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, pp. 51–58.&lt;/ref&gt; Another major herbalist was [[Valerius Cordus]] (1515–1544).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |ref=harv |title = The Herbal of Valerius Cordus |year=1939 |last= Sprague |first= T. A. |journal = The Journal of the Linnean Society of London |publisher= Linnean Society of London |volume = LII |issue = 341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1530, ''Herbarum Vivae Eicones'' of Brunfels contained the admired botanically accurate original woodcut colour illustrations of Hans Weiditz along with descriptions of 47 species new to science. Bock, in setting out to describe the plants of his native Germany, produced the ''New Kreuterbuch'' of 1539 describing the plants he had found in the woods and fields but without illustration; this was supplemented by a second edition in 1546 that contained 365 woodcuts. Bock was possibly the first to adopt a botanical classification in his herbal which also covered details of ecology and plant communities. In this, he was placing emphasis on botanical rather than medicinal characteristics, unlike the other German herbals and foreshadowing the modern [[Flora]]. ''De Historia Stirpium'' (1542 with a German version in 1843) of Fuchs was a later publication with 509 high quality woodcuts that again paid close attention to botanical detail: it included many plants introduced to Germany in the sixteenth century that were new to science.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, pp. 121–147.&lt;/ref&gt; The work of Fuchs is regarded as being among the most accomplished of the Renaissance period.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low Countries – Dodoens, Lobel, Clusius===
The Flemish printer [[Christopher Plantin]] established a reputation publishing the works of Dutch herbalists [[Rembert Dodoens]] and [[Carolus Clusius]] and developing a vast library of illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;Raphael, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; Translations of early Greco-Roman texts published in German by Bock in 1546 as ''Kreuterbuch'' were subsequently translated into [[Dutch language|Dutch]] as ''Pemptades'' by Dodoens (1517–1585) who was a Belgian botanist of world renown. This was an elaboration of his first publication ''Cruydeboeck'' (1554).&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, pp. 173–180.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matthias de Lobel]] (1538–1616) published his ''Stirpium Adversaria Nova'' (1570–1571) and a massive compilation of illustrations&lt;ref&gt;Arber, pp. 90–92.&lt;/ref&gt; while Clusius’s (1526–1609) magnum opus was ''Rariorum Plantarum Historia'' of 1601 which was a compilation of his Spanish and Hungarian floras and included over 600 plants that were new to science.&lt;ref&gt;Arber, pp. 84–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy – Mattioli, Calzolari, Alpino===
[[File:Appolinaris._Chamomeleon._Sliatriceo._Narcissus.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Early Italian manuscript herbal, c. 1500. Plants illustrated are ''[[Appolinaris]]'', ''[[Chamomeleon]]'', ''[[Sliatriceo]]'' and ''[[Narcissus (plant)|Narcissus]]'']]

In Italy, two herbals were beginning to include botanical descriptions. Notable herbalists included [[Pietro Andrea Mattioli]] (1501–1577), physician to the Italian aristocracy and his ''Commentarii'' (1544), which included many newly described species, and his more traditional herbal ''Epistolarum Medicinalium Libri Quinque'' (1561). Sometimes, the local flora was described as in the publication ''Viaggio di Monte Baldo'' (1566) of [[Francisco Calzolari]]. [[Prospero Alpino]] (1553–1617) published in 1592 the highly popular account of overseas plants ''De Plantis Aegypti'' and he also established a [[botanical garden]] in Padua in 1542, which together with those at Pisa and Florence, rank among the world’s first.&lt;ref&gt;Arber, pp. 92–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

===England – Turner, Gerard, Parkinson, Culpeper===
{{further|William Turner (ornithologist)|John Parkinson (botanist)|Nicholas Culpeper|John Gerard}}
The first true herbal printed in Britain was Richard Banckes' ''Herball'' of 1525&lt;ref&gt;Arber, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; which, although popular in its day, was unillustrated and soon eclipsed by the most famous of the early printed herbals, Peter Treveris's ''[[Grete Herball]]'' of 1526 (derived in turn from the derivative French ''Grand Herbier'').&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, pp. 65–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John-Parkinson.jpg|thumb|150px|right|An engraving of Parkinson from his work ''Theatrum Botanicum'' (1640), reprinted in [[Agnes Arber]]'s ''Herbals'']]

William Turner (?1508–7 to 1568) was an English [[naturalist]], botanist, and [[theologian]] who studied at [[Cambridge University]] and eventually became known as the “father of English botany." His 1538 publication ''Libellus de re Herbaria Novus'' was the first essay on scientific botany in English. His three-part ''A New Herball'' of 1551–1562–1568, with woodcut illustrations taken from Fuchs, was noted for its original contributions and extensive medicinal content; it was also more accessible to readers, being written in vernacular English. Turner described over 200 species native to England.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; and his work had a strong influence on later eminent botanists such as [[John Ray]] and [[Jean Bauhin]].

John Gerard (1545–1612) is the most famous of all the English herbalists.&lt;ref name="Raphael, p. 251"&gt;Raphael, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Herball'' of 1597 is, like most herbals, largely derivative. It appears to be a reformulation of Hieronymus Bock's ''Kreuterbuch'' subsequently translated into [[Dutch language|Dutch]] as ''Pemptades'' by [[Rembert Dodoens]] (1517–1585), and thence into [[English language|English]] by [[Carolus Clusius]], (1526–1609) then re-worked by [[Henry Lyte (botanist)|Henry Lyte]] in 1578 as ''A Nievve Herball''. This became the basis of Gerard's ''Herball'' or ''General Historie of Plantes''.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt &amp; Raphael, pp. 164–166.&lt;/ref&gt; that appeared in 1597 with its 1800 woodcuts (only 16 original). Although largely derivative, Gerard's popularity can be attributed to his evocation of plants and places in Elizabethan England and to the clear influence of gardens and gardening on this work.&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;
He had published, in 1596, ''Catalogus'' which was a list of 1033 plants growing in his garden.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Parkinson (1567–1650) was apothecary to [[James I of England|James I]] and a founding member of the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries.  He was an enthusiastic and skilful gardener, his garden in Long Acre being stocked with rarities. He maintained an active correspondence with important English and Continental botanists, herbalists and plantsmen importing new and unusual plants from overseas, in particular the [[Levant]] and [[Virginia]].  Parkinson is celebrated for his two monumental works, the first ''Paradisi in Sole Paradisus Terrestris'' in 1629: this was essentially a gardening book, a [[florilegium]] for which [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] awarded him the title ''Botanicus Regius Primarius''&amp;nbsp;– Royal Botanist. The second was his ''Theatrum Botanicum'' of 1640, the largest herbal ever produced in the English language. It lacked the quality illustrations of Gerard's works, but was a massive and informative compendium including about 3800 plants (twice the number of Gerard's first edition ''Herball''), over 1750 pages and over 2,700 woodcuts.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; This was effectively the last and culminating herbal of its kind and, although it included more plants of no discernible economic or medicinal use than ever before, they were nevertheless arranged according to their properties rather than their natural affinities.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, pp. 230, 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wikiquote|Nicholas Culpeper}}
Nicholas Culpeper (1616–1654) was an English [[botanist]], [[herbalist]], [[physician]], [[apothecary]] and [[astrologer]] from London's East End.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skyscript.co.uk/culpeper.html |title=Nicholas Culpeper: Herbalist of the People |author=Davis, Dylan Warren |date=January 2005 |publisher=Astrologycollege.com |accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; His published books were ''A Physicall Directory''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;res_id=xri:eebo&amp;rft_val_fmt=&amp;rft_id=xri:eebo:image:54720|title=A Physicall Directory |author=Culpeper, Nicholas|year=1649 |accessdate=2010-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1649), which was a pseudoscientific pharmacopoeia.

His works lacked scientific credibility because of their use of [[astrology]], though he combined diseases, plants and astrological prognosis into a simple integrated system that has proved popular to the present day.&lt;ref name="Raphael, p. 251"/&gt;

==Legacy==
{{further|Pharmacopoeia|Plant taxonomy|Flora}}
[[File:Zh pharmacopoeia 2.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Back cover of the Chinese pharmacopoeia (1930)]]

The legacy of the herbal extends beyond medicine to botany and horticulture. Herbal medicine is still practiced in many parts of the world but the traditional grand herbal, as described here, ended with the European Renaissance, the rise of modern medicine and the use of synthetic and industrialized drugs. The medicinal component of herbals has developed in several ways. Firstly, discussion of plant lore was reduced and with the increased medical content there emerged the official pharmacopoeia. The first British Pharmacopoeia was published in the English language in 1864, but gave such general dissatisfaction both to the medical profession and to chemists and druggists that the General Medical Council brought out a new and amended edition in 1867. Secondly, at a more popular level, there are the books on culinary herbs and herb gardens, medicinal and useful plants. Finally, the enduring desire for simple medicinal information on specific plants has resulted in contemporary herbals that echo the herbals of the past, an example being [[Maud Grieve]]'s ''[[A Modern Herbal]]'', first published in 1931 but with many subsequent editions.&lt;ref&gt;Arber, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Delphinium peregrinum.jpg|thumb|upright|Illustration of ''Delphinium peregrinum''  in ''[[Flora Graeca]]'' by [[John Sibthorp]] and [[Ferdinand Bauer]] (1806–1840)]]

The magical and mystical side of the herbal also lives on. Herbals often explained plant lore, displaying a superstitious or spiritual side. There was, for example, the fanciful [[doctrine of signatures]], the belief that there were similarities in the appearance of the part of the body affected the appearance of the plant to be used as a remedy. The astrology of Culpeper can be seen in contemporary [[anthroposophy]] ([[biodynamic gardening]]) and alternative medical approaches like [[homeopathy]], [[aromatherapy]] and other [[new age]] medicine show connections with herbals and traditional medicine.&lt;ref name="Raphael, p. 251"/&gt;

It is sometimes forgotten that the plants described in herbals were grown in special herb gardens (physic gardens). Such herb gardens were, for example, part of the medieval monastery garden that supplied the simples or officinals used to treat the sick being cared for within the monastery. Early [[physic garden]]s were also associated with institutes of learning, whether a [[monastery]], [[university]] or [[herbarium]]. It was this medieval garden of the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries, attended by [[apothecary|apothecaries]] and [[physician]]s, that established a tradition leading to the systems gardens of the eighteenth century (gardens that demonstrated the classification system of plants) and the modern [[botanical garden]]. The advent of printing, woodcuts and metal engraving improved the means of communication. Herbals prepared the ground for modern botanical science by pioneering plant description, classification and illustration.&lt;ref&gt;Arber, pp. 146–246.&lt;/ref&gt; From the time of the ancients like Dioscorides through to Parkinson in 1629, the scope of the herbal remained essentially the same.&lt;ref&gt;Raphael, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest legacy of the herbal is to botany. Up to the seventeenth century, botany and medicine were one and the same but gradually greater emphasis was placed on the plants rather than their medicinal properties. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, plant description and classification began to relate plants to one another and not to man. This was the first glimpse of non-anthropocentric botanical science since Theophrastus and, coupled with the new system of [[binomial nomenclature]], resulted in "scientific herbals" called ''[[Flora]]s'' that detailed and illustrated the plants growing in a particular region. These books were often backed by [[herbarium|herbaria]], collections of dried plants that verified the plant descriptions given in the Floras. In this way modern botany, especially [[plant taxonomy]], was born out of medicine. As herbal historian [[Agnes Arber]] remarks – "Sibthorp's monumental ''Flora Graeca'' is, indeed, the direct descendant in modern science of the ''De Materia Medica'' of Dioscorides."&lt;ref&gt;Arber, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the concept==
{{Main|History of human rights}}
[[File:Cyrus Cylinder front.jpg|thumb|The [[Cyrus Cylinder]], created by king [[Cyrus the Great]], is sometimes argued to be the world's first charter of human rights.]]

The history of human rights has not been entirely progressive. Many established rights would be replaced by other less tolerant systems. Stable institutions may be uprooted such as in cases of conflict such as war and terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights: Commitment and Betrayal. Author, M. G. Chitkara. Publisher, APH Publishing, 1996. ISBN, 8170247276, 9788170247272.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest conceptualisation of human rights is credited to ideas about [[natural rights]] emanating from [[natural law]].

The [[Mauryan Empire|Mauryan]] Emperor [[Ashoka]], who ruled from 268 to 232 BCE, established the [[List of largest empires in India|largest empire]] in [[South Asia]]. Following the reportedly destructive [[Kalinga War]], Ashoka adopted Buddhism and abandoned an expansionist policy in favor of humanitarian reforms.

=== 16th–18th century ===
[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|''Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen'' approved by the [[National Assembly of France]], 26 August 1789]]

17th-century English philosopher [[John Locke]] discussed natural rights in his work, identifying them as being "life, liberty, and estate (property)", and argued that such fundamental rights could not be surrendered in the [[social contract]]. In Britain in 1689, the English [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] and the Scottish [[Claim of Right Act 1689|Claim of Right]] each made illegal a range of oppressive governmental actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Britain's unwritten constitution|url=http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/britains-unwritten-constitution|publisher=British Library|accessdate=27 November 2015|quote=The key landmark is the Bill of Rights (1689), which established the supremacy of Parliament over the Crown ... providing for the regular meeting of Parliament, free elections to the Commons, free speech in parliamentary debates, and some basic human rights, most famously freedom from ‘cruel or unusual punishment’.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two major revolutions occurred during the 18th century, in the United States (1776) and in France (1789), leading to the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] and the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] respectively, both of which articulated certain human rights. Additionally, the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] of 1776 encoded into law a number of fundamental [[civil rights]] and civil freedoms.

{{quote|We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.|United States Declaration of Independence, 1776}}

These were followed by developments in philosophy of human rights by philosophers such as [[Thomas Paine]], [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G.W.F. Hegel]] during the 18th and 19th centuries. The term ''human rights'' probably came into use some time between Paine's ''The Rights of Man'' and [[William Lloyd Garrison]]'s 1831 writings in ''[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]'', in which he stated that he was trying to enlist his readers in "the great cause of human rights". Although the term had been used by at least one author as early as 1742.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

=== 19th century ===

In the 19th century, human rights became a central concern over the issue of [[slavery]].&lt;ref name=twsGaryJBass/&gt; A number of reformers, notably British Member of Parliament [[William Wilberforce]], worked towards the abolition of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] and [[Abolitionism|abolition of slavery]]. This was achieved across the [[British Empire]] by the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]], which was [[Blockade of Africa|enforced internationally]] by the Royal Navy under treaties Britain negotiated with other nations,&lt;ref name="Lovejoy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lovejoy |first=Paul E. |title=Transformations in slavery: a history of slavery in Africa |page=290 |location=New York |edition=2nd |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0521780124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]]. In the United States, all the northern states had [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolished]] the institution of slavery between 1777 and 1804, although southern states clung tightly to the "peculiar institution". Conflict and debates over the expansion of slavery to new territories constituted one of the reasons for the southern states' [[secession]] and the [[American Civil War]]. During the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|reconstruction period]] immediately following the war, several amendments to the [[United States Constitution]] were made. These included the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th amendment]], banning slavery, the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th amendment]], assuring full citizenship and civil rights to all people born in the United States, and the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th amendment]], guaranteeing [[African Americans]] the right to vote. In [[Russia]], the reformer [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]] ended serfdom in 1861,&lt;ref name=twsGaryJBass/&gt; although the freed serfs often faced restrictions of their mobility within the nation.

Many groups and movements have achieved profound social changes over the course of the 20th century in the name of human rights. In [[Europe]] and North America, [[trade union|labour unions]] brought about laws granting workers the right to strike, establishing minimum work conditions and forbidding or regulating [[child labor|child labour]]. The [[women's rights]] movement succeeded in gaining for many women the right to [[voting|vote]]. [[Wars of national liberation|National liberation movements]] in many countries succeeded in driving out [[colony|colonial]] powers. One of the most influential was [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s movement to free his native India from British rule. Movements by long-oppressed racial and religious minorities succeeded in many parts of the world, among them the [[civil rights movement]], and more recent movements, on behalf of women and minorities in the United States.

The establishment of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], the 1864 [[Lieber Code]] and the first of the [[Geneva Conventions]] in 1864 laid the foundations of [[International humanitarian law]], to be further developed following the two [[World Wars]].

=== 20th century ===

The World Wars, and the huge losses of life and gross abuses of human rights that took place during them, were a driving force behind the development of modern [[international human rights instruments|human rights instruments]]. The [[League of Nations]] was established in 1919 at the negotiations over the [[Treaty of Versailles]] following the end of [[World War I]]. The League's goals included disarmament, preventing war through collective security, settling disputes between countries through negotiation and diplomacy, and improving global welfare. Enshrined in its charter was a mandate to promote many of the rights later included in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

At the 1945 [[Yalta Conference]], the Allied Powers agreed to create a new body to supplant the League's role; this was to be the [[United Nations]]. The United Nations has played an important role in international human-rights law since its creation. Following the World Wars, the United Nations and its members developed much of the discourse and the bodies of law that now make up [[international humanitarian law]] and [[international human rights law]]. Analyst Belinda Cooper argued that human rights organisations flourished in the 1990s, possibly as a result of the dissolution of the [[Western bloc|western]] and [[Eastern bloc|eastern]] Cold War blocs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/books/review/Cooper-t.html|title=Book Review - The Last Utopia - Human Rights in History - By Samuel Moyn|first=Belinda|last=Cooper|date=September 24, 2010|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ludwig Hoffmann argues that human rights became more widely emphasised in the latter half of the twentieth century because it "provided a language for political claim making and counter-claims, liberal-democratic, but also socialist and post colonialist.&lt;ref name="Hoffmann2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stefan-Ludwig Hoffmann|title=Human Rights in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ES8ptQvfVvAC&amp;pg=PA2|date=December 13, 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49410-6|pages=2–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDHR was signed by member states of the OIC in 1990 at the 19th Conference of Foreign Ministers held in Cairo, Egypt. It was seen as the answer to the UDHR. In fact, the CDHR was "patterned after the UN-sponsored UDHR of 1948".&lt;ref name="Ahsan, Abdullah 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=al-Ahsan |first1=Abdullah |title=Law, Religion and Human Dignity in the Muslim World Today: An Examination of OIC's Cairo Declaration of Human Rights |journal=Journal of Law and Religion |date=2008 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=569–597 |doi=10.1017/S0748081400001715 |url=http://irep.iium.edu.my/7070 |accessdate=11 August 2018 |language=en |issn=0748-0814 |hdl=hein.journals/jlrel24 |jstor=25654330}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object of the CDHR was to "serve as a guide for member states on human rights issues.

==Philosophy==
{{Main|Philosophy of human rights}}
The philosophy of human rights attempts to examine the underlying basis of the concept of human rights and critically looks at its content and justification. Several theoretical approaches have been advanced to explain how and why human rights have become a part of social expectations.

One of the oldest Western philosophies of human rights is that they are a product of a natural law, stemming from different philosophical or religious grounds. Other theories hold that human rights codify moral behaviour which is a human social product developed by a process of biological and social evolution (associated with [[David Hume|Hume]]). Human rights are also described as a sociological pattern of rule setting (as in the sociological theory of law and the work of [[Max Weber|Weber]]). These approaches include the notion that individuals in a society accept rules from legitimate authority in exchange for security and economic advantage (as in [[John Rawls|Rawls]]) – a social contract. The two theories that dominate contemporary human rights discussion are the interest theory and the will theory. Interest theory argues that the principal function of human rights is to protect and promote certain essential human interests, while will theory attempts to establish the validity of human rights based on the unique human capacity for freedom.&lt;ref name="IEOP"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Fagan |2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other positions attempt to categorise rights into basic types, rather than make claims about the function or derivation of particular rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Evans |first1=Woody |title=Posthuman Rights: Dimensions of Transhuman Worlds |journal=Teknokultura |date=12 August 2015 |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=373–384 |doi=10.5209/rev_TK.2015.v12.n2.49072 |url=https://philarchive.org/archive/EVAPRDv1 |accessdate=11 August 2018 |language=en |format=PDF |issn=1549-2230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
The claims made by human rights to universality have led to criticism. Philosophers who have criticised the concept of human rights include [[Jeremy Bentham]], [[Edmund Burke]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Karl Marx]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} Canadian political philosophy professor Charles Blattberg argues that discussion of human rights, being abstract, demotivates people from upholding the values that rights are meant to affirm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last= Blattberg  |first= C  |year= 2010  |publisher= [[McGill-Queen's University Press]]  |chapter= The Ironic Tragedy of Human Rights  |isbn= 978-0-7735-3538-1  |title= Patriotic Elaborations: Essays in Practical Philosophy |pages=  43–59  |authorlink= Charles Blattberg |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8TwCsA–l408C&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] gives particular attention to two types of criticisms: the one questioning universality of human rights and the one denying them objective ground.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Fagan]] [http://www.iep.utm.edu/hum-rts/#H5 Philosophical criticisms of human rights] [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] Human Rights 2003-2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alain Pellet]], a French scholar on international law, criticises "human rightism" approach as denying the principle of sovereignty and claiming a special place for human rights among the branches of international law;&lt;ref&gt;[[Alain Pellet]] [http://www.droits-fondamentaux.org/spip.php?article27 "Droits-de-l’hommisme" et droit international] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117073042/http://www.droits-fondamentaux.org/spip.php?article27 |date=January 17, 2013 }} 2000 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; French journalist [[Alain de Benoist]] questions human rights premises of human equality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alain de Benoist]] [http://www.alaindebenoist.com/pdf/au-dela_des_droits_de_l_homme.pdf Au-dela des droits de l'homme]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317161306/http://www.alaindebenoist.com/pdf/au-dela_des_droits_de_l_homme.pdf |date=March 17, 2012 }} Krisis 2004{{fr icon}}; Religion of Human Rights, 1988 [http://www.velesova-sloboda.org/misc/benoist-die-religion-der-menschenrechte.html {{de icon}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505173723/http://velesova-sloboda.org/misc/benoist-die-religion-der-menschenrechte.html |date=May 5, 2012 }} [http://www.velesova-sloboda.org/polit/benoist-religiya-prav-cheloveka.html {{ru icon}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505201210/http://velesova-sloboda.org/polit/benoist-religiya-prav-cheloveka.html |date=May 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; American scholar [[David Kennedy (jurist)|David Kennedy]] had listed pragmatic worries and polemical charges concerning human rights in 2002 in ''Harvard Human Rights Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=KENNEDY |first1=David|authorlink1=David Kennedy (jurist) |title=The International Human Rights Movements: Part of the Problem?’ |journal=Harvard Human Rights Journal |date= Spring 2002 |volume=15 |pages=101 |url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/hrj/iss15/kennedy.shtml#fn1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Human rights can be classified and organised in several different ways. At an international level the most common categorisation of human rights has been to split them into [[civil and political rights]], and [[economic, social and cultural rights]].

Civil and political rights are enshrined in articles 3 to 21 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) and in the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] ([[ICCPR]]). Economic, social and cultural rights are enshrined in articles 22 to 28 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) and in the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] ([[ICESCR]]).

===Indivisibility===
The [[UDHR]] included both economic, social and cultural rights and civil and political rights because it was based on the principle that the different rights could only successfully exist in combination:

{{Quote|The ideal of free human beings enjoying civil and political freedom and freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his civil and political rights, as well as his social, economic and cultural rights.|International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights, 1966}}

This is held to be true because without civil and political rights the public cannot assert their economic, social and cultural rights. Similarly, without livelihoods and a working society, the public cannot assert or make use of civil or political rights (known as the ''full belly thesis'').

The indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights has been confirmed by the 1993 [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]]:

{{Quote|All human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent and related. The international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing, and with the same emphasis.|[[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], [[World Conference on Human Rights]], 1993}}
This statement was again endorsed at the 2005 World Summit in New York (paragraph 121).

Although accepted by the signatories to the [[UDHR]], most do not in practice give equal weight to the different types of rights. Some Western cultures have often given priority to civil and political rights, sometimes at the expense of economic and social rights such as the [[right to work]], to [[right to education|education]], [[right to health|health]] and housing. Similarly the ex Soviet bloc countries and Asian countries have tended to give priority to economic, social and cultural rights, but have often failed to provide civil and political rights.

===Categorisation===
Opponents of the indivisibility of human rights argue that economic, social and cultural rights are fundamentally different from civil and political rights and require completely different approaches.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} Economic, social and cultural rights are argued{{By whom|date=July 2014}} to be:
* ''aspirations or goals'', as opposed to real 'legal' rights
* ''ideologically divisive/political'', meaning that there is no consensus on what should or should not be provided as a right
* ''non-justiciable'', meaning that their provision, or the breach of them, cannot be judged in a court of law
* ''positive'', meaning that they require active provision of entitlements by the state (as opposed to the state being required only to prevent the breach of rights)
* ''progressive'', meaning that they will take significant time to implement
* ''resource-intensive'', meaning that they are expensive and difficult to provide
* ''[[socialism|socialist]]'', as opposed to [[capitalism|capitalist]]
* ''vague'', meaning they cannot be quantitatively measured, and whether they are adequately provided or not is difficult to judge.
Similarly civil and political rights are categorized as:
* ''capitalist''
* ''cost-free''
* ''immediate'', meaning they can be immediately provided if the state decides to
* ''justiciable''
* ''negative'', meaning the state can protect them simply by taking no action
* ''non-ideological/non-political''
* ''precise'', meaning their provision is easy to judge and measure
* ''real 'legal' rights''

Australian politician Olivia Ball and British scholar Paul Gready argue that for both civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights, it is easy to find examples which do not fit into the above categorisation. Among several others, they highlight the fact that maintaining a judicial system, a fundamental requirement of the civil right to due process before the law and other rights relating to judicial process, is positive, resource-intensive, progressive and vague, while the social right to housing is precise, justiciable and can be a real 'legal' right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Ball |Gready |2006 |p=37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Three generations===
Another categorisation, offered by Czech-French scholar [[Karel Vasak]], is that there are ''[[three generations of human rights]]'': first-generation civil and political rights (right to life and political participation), second-generation economic, social and cultural rights (right to subsistence) and third-generation solidarity rights (right to peace, right to clean environment). Out of these generations, the third generation is the most debated and lacks both legal and political recognition. This categorisation is at odds with the indivisibility of rights, as it implicitly states that some rights can exist without others. Prioritisation of rights for pragmatic reasons is however a widely accepted necessity. American human rights scholar [[Philip Alston]] argues:

{{quote|If every possible human rights element is deemed to be essential or necessary, then nothing will be treated as though it is truly important.&lt;ref name="Alston807"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Alston |2005 |p=807 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He, and others, urge caution with prioritisation of rights:

{{quote|source=|[T]he call for prioritizing is not to suggest that any obvious violations of rights can be ignored.|Philip Alston&lt;ref name="Alston807"/&gt;}}

{{quote|Priorities, where necessary, should adhere to core concepts (such as reasonable attempts at progressive realization) and principles (such as non-discrimination, equality and participation.|Olivia Ball, Paul Gready&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Ball |Gready |2006 |p=42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some human rights are said to be "[[inalienable rights]]". The term inalienable rights (or unalienable rights) refers to "a set of human rights that are fundamental, are not awarded by human power, and cannot be surrendered."

==International protection and promotion==
{{Main|International human rights law}}
In the aftermath of the atrocities of World War II, there was increased concern for the social and legal protection of human rights as fundamental freedoms. The foundation of the [[United Nations]] and the provisions of the United Nations Charter provided a basis for a comprehensive system of international law and practice for the protection of human rights. Since then, international human rights law has been characterised by a linked system of conventions, treaties, organisations, and political bodies, rather than any single entity or set of laws.&lt;ref name="Brownlie532"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Brownlie|2003|p=532 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, American analyst [[Pierre N. Leval|Pierre Leval]] suggested that respect for fundamental human rights in the world today (in 2013) is "dismal" within some nations:&lt;ref name=twsForeignAffairs/&gt;

===United Nations Charter===
{{Main|United Nations Charter}}
The provisions of the United Nations Charter provided a basis for the development of international human rights protection in the opinion of British barrister [[Ian Brownlie]].&lt;ref name="Brownlie532" /&gt; The preamble of the charter provides that the members "reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the equal rights of men and women" and Article 1(3) of the United Nations charter states that one of the purposes of the UN is: "to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/chapter1.html] United Nations Charter Article 1(3).&lt;/ref&gt; Article 55 provides that:
{{quote|The United Nations shall promote: a) higher standards of living, full employment, and conditions of economic and social progress and development; b) solutions of international economic, social, health, and related problems; c) international cultural and educational cooperation; d) universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.}}
Of particular importance{{According to whom|date=May 2017}} is Article 56 of the charter: "All Members pledge themselves to take joint and separate action in co-operation with the Organization for the achievement of the purposes set forth in Article 55." This is a binding treaty provision applicable to both the organization and its members and has been taken to constitute a legal obligation for the members of the United Nations.&lt;ref name="Brownlie532"/&gt; Overall, the references to human rights in the charter are general and vague. The charter does not contain specific legal rights, nor does it mandate any enforcement procedures to protect these rights.&lt;ref name="Shaw277"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Shaw |2008 |p=277 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Shaw, the importance of human rights on the global stage can be traced to the importance of human rights within the United Nations framework and the UN Charter can be seen as the starting point for the development of a broad array of declarations, treaties, implementation and enforcement mechanisms, UN organs, committees and reports on the protection of human rights.&lt;ref name="Shaw277"/&gt; The rights espoused in the UN charter were codified and defined in a non-binding context within the International Bill of Human Rights, composing the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].

===Universal Declaration of Human Rights===
{{Main|Universal Declaration of Human Rights}}
[[File:EleanorRooseveltHumanRights.png|right|thumb|upright=0.9|"It is not a [[treaty]]...[In the future, it] may well become the international [[Magna Carta]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Roosevelt |1948 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Eleanor Roosevelt]] with the Spanish text of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|Universal Declaration]] in 1949.]]
The '''Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)''' was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly&lt;ref name="UDHR"/&gt; in 1948, partly in response to the atrocities of [[World War II]]. It is generally viewed as the preeminent statement of international rights and has been identified as being a culmination of centuries of thinking along both secular and religious lines.&lt;ref name=twsIshay&gt;The History of Human Rights: From Ancient Times to the Globalization Era, [[Micheline R. Ishay]], copyright 2004 and 2008, University of California Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YTh22XQrtlQC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=preeminent+document+international+rights+summarizing+secular+religious+notions+rights+evolved+centuries+ishay&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Em3tU_LtHqzLsATz-YGQBw&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=preeminent%20document%20international%20rights%20summarizing%20secular%20religious%20notions%20rights%20evolved%20centuries%20ishay&amp;f=false Early Ethical Contributions], Retrieved August 14, 2014, (see page 18 near top of page) "...The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was the preeminent document of international rights summarizing secular and religious notions of rights that had evolved throughout the centuries...."&lt;/ref&gt; Although the UDHR is a non-binding resolution, it is now considered by some to have acquired the force of international [[custom (law)|customary law]] which may be invoked in appropriate circumstances by national and other [[tribunals]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} The UDHR urges member nations to promote a number of human, civil, economic and social rights, asserting these rights as part of the "foundation of [[Political freedom|freedom]], [[justice]] and [[peace]] in the world." The declaration was the first international legal effort to limit the behaviour of states and press upon them duties to their citizens.

{{quote|...recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and [[inalienable rights]] of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.|Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948}}

The UDHR was framed by members of the Human Rights Commission, with former [[First Lady]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] as Chair, who began to discuss an ''International Bill of Rights'' in 1947. The members of the Commission did not immediately agree on the form of such a bill of rights, and whether, or how, it should be enforced. The Commission proceeded to frame the UDHR and accompanying treaties, but the UDHR quickly became the priority.&lt;ref name=Glendon&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Glendon |2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Canadian law professor [[John Peters Humphrey|John Humphrey]] and French lawyer [[René Cassin]] were responsible for much of the cross-national research and the structure of the document respectively, where the articles of the declaration were interpretative of the general principle of the preamble. The document was structured by Cassin to include the basic principles of dignity, liberty, equality and brotherhood in the first two articles, followed successively by rights pertaining to individuals; rights of individuals in relation to each other and to groups; spiritual, public and political rights; and economic, social and cultural rights. According to Cassin, the final three articles place rights in the context of limits, duties and the social and political order in which they are to be realised.&lt;ref name=Glendon/&gt;
Humphrey and Cassin intended the rights in the UDHR to be legally enforceable through some means, as is reflected in the third clause of the preamble:&lt;ref name=Glendon/&gt;

{{quote|Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law.|Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948}}

Some of the UDHR was researched and written by a committee of international experts on human rights, including representatives from all continents and all major religions, and drawing on consultation with leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi.&lt;ref&gt;Glendon (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The inclusion of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights&lt;ref name=Glendon/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gready34"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Ball |Gready |2006 |p=34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was predicated on the assumption that all human rights are indivisible and that the different types of rights listed are inextricably linked. This principle was not then opposed by any member states (the declaration was adopted unanimously, [[Byelorussian SSR]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Poland]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Ukrainian SSR]], [[Union of South Africa]], [[USSR]], [[Yugoslavia]].); however, this principle was later subject to significant challenges.&lt;ref name="Gready34"/&gt;

The Universal Declaration was bifurcated into treaties, a Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and another on social, economic, and cultural rights, due to questions about the relevance and propriety of economic and social provisions in covenants on human rights. Both covenants begin with the right of people to self-determination and to sovereignty over their natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;Henkin, Louis. The International Bill of Rights: The Universal Declaration and the Covenants, in International Enforcement of Human Rights 6–9, Bernhardt and Jolowicz, eds, (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; This debate over whether human rights are more fundamental than economic rights has continued to the present day. The United States declared after the World Food Summit that a right to be free from hunger does not give rise to any international obligations which has been interpreted as a [[negative duty]].&lt;ref name=ohch&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pogge|first1=Thomas|title=Poverty and Human Rights|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/poverty/expert/docs/Thomas_Pogge_Summary.pdf|website=ohchr.org|accessdate=May 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drafters of the Covenants initially intended only one instrument. The original drafts included only political and civil rights, but economic and social rights were also proposed. The disagreement over which rights were basic human rights resulted in there being two covenants. The debate was whether economic and social rights are aspirational, as contrasted with basic human rights which all people possess purely by being human, because economic and social rights depend on wealth and the availability of resources. In addition, which social and economic rights should be recognised depends on ideology or economic theories, in contrast to basic human rights, which are defined purely by the nature (mental and physical abilities) of human beings. It was debated whether economic rights were appropriate subjects for binding obligations and whether the lack of consensus over such rights would dilute the strength of political-civil rights. There was wide agreement and clear recognition that the means required to enforce or induce compliance with socioeconomic undertakings were different from the means required for civil-political rights.&lt;ref&gt;Henkin, Louis. Introduction, The International Bill of Rights 9–10 (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Henkin |first1=Louis|title=The International Bill of Rights: The Covenant on Civil and Political Rights |date=1981|publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=9780231051804|pages=9–10 |edition= |url=https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/789034 |accessdate=11 August 2018 |language=en |chapter= Introduction|hdl=10822/789034|oclc= 802896468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This debate and the desire for the greatest number of signatories to human-rights law led to the two covenants. The Soviet bloc and a number of developing countries had argued for the inclusion of all rights in a so-called ''Unity Resolution''. Both covenants allowed states to derogate some rights.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Those in favour of a single treaty could not gain sufficient consensus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Ball |Gready |2006 |p=35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===International treaties===
In 1966, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] ('''ICCPR''') and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] ('''ICESCR''') were adopted by the [[United Nations]], between them making the rights contained in the UDHR binding on all states that have signed this treaty, creating human-rights law.

Since then numerous other treaties ([[International human rights instruments|pieces of legislation]]) have been offered at the international level. They are generally known as ''human rights instruments''. Some of the most significant, referred to (with ICCPR and ICESCR) as "the seven core treaties", are:
* [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] ('''CEDAW''') (adopted 1979, entry into force: 1981)
* [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] ('''CERD''') (adopted 1966, entry into force: 1969)
* [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] ('''CRPD''') (adopted 2006, entry into force: 2008)
* [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] ('''CRC''') (adopted 1989, entry into force: 1989)
* [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] ('''CAT''') (adopted 1984, entry into force: 1987)
* [[United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families|International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families]] ('''ICRMW''' or more often '''MWC''') (adopted 1990, entry into force: 2003)

===Customary international law===
{{Main|Customary international law}}
In addition to protection by international treaties, customary international law may protect some human rights, such as the prohibition of torture, genocide and slavery and the principle of non-discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Shaw |2008 |p=275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International humanitarian law===
{{Main|Geneva Conventions|International humanitarian law}}

The '''Geneva Conventions''' came into being between 1864 and 1949 as a result of efforts by [[Henry Dunant]], the founder of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]]. The conventions safeguard the human rights of individuals involved in armed conflict, and build on the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]], the international community's first attempt to formalise the laws of war and war crimes in the nascent body of secular international law. The conventions were revised as a result of World War II and readopted by the international community in 1949.

===United Nations system===
{{Main|United Nations}}
Under the mandate of the UN charter, and the multilateral UN human rights treaties, the United Nations (UN) as an intergovernmental body seeks to apply international [[jurisdiction]] for universal human-rights legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Ball |Gready |2006 |p=92 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the UN machinery, human-rights issues are primarily the concern of the [[United Nations Security Council]] and the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]], and there are numerous committees within the UN with responsibilities for safeguarding different human-rights treaties. The most senior body of the UN in the sphere of human rights is the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The United Nations has an international mandate to:

====Political bodies====

=====Security Council=====
{{Main|United Nations Security Council}}
The '''United Nations Security Council''' has the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security and is the only body of the UN that can authorise the use of force. It has been criticised for failing to take action to prevent human rights abuses, including the [[War in Darfur|Darfur crisis]], the [[Srebrenica massacre]] and the [[Rwandan Genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;Fred Grünfeld and Anke Huijboom, ''The failure to prevent genocide in Rwanda: the role of bystanders'' (2007) p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; For example, critics blamed the presence of non-democracies on the Security Council for its failure regarding.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Feinstein, ''Darfur and beyond: what is needed to prevent mass atrocities'' (2007) p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 28, 2006 the Security Council adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1674|resolution 1674]] that reaffirmed the responsibility to protect populations from [[genocide]], [[war crime]]s, [[ethnic cleansing]] and [[Crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]]" and committed the Security Council to action to protect civilians in armed conflict.&lt;ref name="Oxfam_28April"&gt;[http://www.oxfam.org/en/news/pressreleases2006/pr060428_un Security Council passes landmark resolution – world has responsibility to protect people from genocide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101012101425/http://www.oxfam.org/en/news/pressreleases2006/pr060428_un |date=October 12, 2010 }} [[Oxfam]] Press Release - April 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

=====General Assembly=====
[[File:UN General Assembly hall.jpg|thumb|The [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]]]]
{{Main|United Nations General Assembly}}
The '''United Nations General Assembly''', under Article 13 of the UN Charter, has the power to initiate studies and make recommendations on human rights issues.&lt;ref name="Sepúlveda et al. 2004 80"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Sepúlveda et al. |2004 |p=80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Under this provision, the general assembly passed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, and since then a wide variety of other human rights instruments.&lt;ref name="Sepúlveda et al. 2004 80"/&gt; The assembly has several subsidiary organs that deal with specific human rights issues, such as the Special Committee on Decolonisation and the Special Commission against Apartheid (no longer operational). In addition the general assembly has set up a number of subsidiary organs that consider human rights issues in a number of high-profile contexts: such as the UN Council on Namibia, the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practises in the Occupied territories and the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable rights of the Palestine People.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Shaw |2008 |p=303 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Human Rights Council=====

The '''United Nations Human Rights Council''', created at the [[2005 World Summit]] to replace the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]], has a mandate to investigate violations of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

It ranks below the Security Council, which is the final authority for the interpretation of the [[United Nations Charter]].&lt;ref&gt;UN Charter, Article 39&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-seven of the one hundred ninety-one member states sit on the council, elected by simple majority in a secret ballot of the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. Members serve a maximum of six years and may have their membership suspended for gross human rights abuses. The Council is based in [[Geneva]], and meets three times a year; with additional meetings to respond to urgent situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Ball |Gready |2006 |p=95 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent experts (''rapporteurs'') are retained by the Council to investigate alleged human rights abuses and to provide the Council with reports.

The Human Rights Council may request that the Security Council take action when human rights violations occur. This action may be direct actions, may involve [[International sanctions|sanctions]], and the Security Council may also refer cases to the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) even if the issue being referred is outside the normal jurisdiction of the ICC.&lt;ref&gt;The Security Council referred the human rights situation in [[Darfur]] in [[Sudan]] to the ICC despite the fact that Sudan has a functioning legal system&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treaty bodies====
{{anchor|Treaty bodies}}&lt;!-- [[Human rights treaty bodies]] redirects here --&gt;
In addition to the political bodies whose mandate flows from the UN charter, the UN has set up a number of ''treaty-based'' bodies, comprising committees of independent experts who monitor compliance with human rights standards and norms flowing from the core international human rights treaties. They are supported by and are created by the treaty that they monitor, With the exception of the CESCR, which was established under a resolution of the Economic and Social Council to carry out the monitoring functions originally assigned to that body under the Covenant, they are technically autonomous bodies, established by the treaties that they monitor and accountable to the state parties of those treaties - rather than subsidiary to the United Nations. Though in practice they are closely intertwined with the United Nations system and are supported by the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (UNHCHR) and the UN Centre for Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Shaw |2008 |p=311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''[[Human Rights Committee]]'' promotes participation with the standards of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]]. The members of the committee express opinions on member countries and make judgments on individual complaints against countries which have ratified an Optional Protocol to the treaty. The judgments, termed "views", are not legally binding. The member of the committee meets around  three times a year to hold sessions &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CCPR/Pages/CCPRIntro.aspx|title=OHCHR {{!}} Introduction of the Committee|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''[[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]]'' monitors the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|ICESCR]] and makes general comments on ratifying countries performance. It will have the power to receive complaints against the countries that opted into the Optional Protocol once it has come into force. It is important to note that unlike the other treaty bodies, the economic committee is not an autonomous body responsible to the treaty parties, but directly responsible to the Economic and Social Council and ultimately to the General Assembly. This means that the Economic Committee faces particular difficulties at its disposal only relatively "weak" means of implementation in comparison to other treaty bodies.&lt;ref name=Shaw309&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Shaw |2008 |p=309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Particular difficulties noted by commentators include: perceived vagueness of the principles of the treaty, relative lack of legal texts and decisions, ambivalence of many states in addressing economic, social and cultural rights, comparatively few non-governmental organisations focused on the area and problems with obtaining relevant and precise information.&lt;ref name=Shaw309/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

* The ''Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination'' monitors the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|CERD]] and conducts regular reviews of countries' performance. It can make judgments on complaints against member states allowing it, but these are not legally binding. It issues warnings to attempt to prevent serious contraventions of the convention.
* The ''Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women'' monitors the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|CEDAW]]. It receives states' reports on their performance and comments on them, and can make judgments on complaints against countries which have opted into the 1999 Optional Protocol.
* The ''Committee Against Torture'' monitors the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|CAT]] and receives states' reports on their performance every four years and comments on them. Its subcommittee may visit and inspect countries which have opted into the Optional Protocol.
* The ''[[Committee on the Rights of the Child]]'' monitors the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|CRC]] and makes comments on reports submitted by states every five years. It does not have the power to receive complaints.
* The ''Committee on Migrant Workers'' was established in 2004 and monitors the [[United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families|ICRMW]] and makes comments on reports submitted by states every five years. It will have the power to receive complaints of specific violations only once ten member states allow it.
* The ''[[Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]]'' was established in 2008 to monitor the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]]. It has the power to receive complaints against the countries which have opted into the [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]].
* The ''Committee on Enforced Disappearances'' monitors the [[International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance|ICPPED]]. All States parties are obliged to submit reports to the Committee on how the rights are being implemented. The Committee examines each report and addresses its concerns and recommendations to the State party in the form of "concluding observations”.

Each treaty body receives secretariat support from the Human Rights Council and Treaties Division of Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR) in Geneva except CEDAW, which is supported by the Division for the Advancement of Women (DAW). CEDAW formerly held all its sessions at United Nations headquarters in New York but now frequently meets at the United Nations Office in Geneva; the other treaty bodies meet in Geneva. The Human Rights Committee usually holds its March session in New York City.

===Regional human rights regimes===
{{Main|Regional human rights regimes}}
International human rights regimes are in several cases "nested" within more comprehensive and overlapping regional agreements. These regional regimes can be seen as relatively independently coherent human rights sub-regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Donnelly |2003 |p=138 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three principal regional human rights instruments can be identified; the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]], the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] (the Americas) and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. The European Convention on Human Rights has since 1950 defined and guaranteed human rights and fundamental freedoms in Europe.&lt;ref name=EUCourt&gt;{{cite web

Human rights organisations frequently engage in [[lobbying]] and [[advocacy]] in an effort to convince the United Nations, supranational bodies and national governments to adopt their policies on human rights. Many human-rights organisations have observer status at the various UN bodies tasked with protecting human rights. A new (in 2009) non-governmental human-rights conference is the [[Oslo Freedom Forum]], a gathering described by [[The Economist]] as "on its way to becoming a human-rights equivalent of the Davos economic forum." The same article noted that human-rights advocates are more and more divided amongst themselves over how violations of human rights are to be defined, notably as regards the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

There is criticism of human-rights organisations who use their status but allegedly move away from their stated goals. For example, [[Gerald M. Steinberg]], an Israel-based academic, maintains that NGOs take advantage of a "[[halo effect]]" and are "given the status of impartial moral watchdogs" by governments and the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Human rights defenders===

Human rights defender are people who, individually or with others, act peacefully to promote or protect human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ishr.ch/news/un-declaration-human-rights-defenders|title=UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders|work=ISHR|access-date=2018-05-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can defend rights as part of their jobs or in a voluntary capacity and can act at local, national or international level. They can be journalists, environmentalists, whistle-blowers, trade unionists, lawyers, teachers, housing campaigners, and so on. As a result of their activities, they can sometimes be the subject of reprisals and attacks of all kinds, including smears, surveillance, harassment, false charges, arbitrary detention, restrictions on the right to freedom of association, and physical attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act30/6011/2017/en/|title=Human Rights Defenders under threat|last=Amnesty International|first=|date=2017|website=amnesty.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the legal and moral environment surrounding the actions of governments is reasonably well developed, that surrounding multinational companies is both controversial and ill-defined.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Multinational companies' primary responsibility is to their [[shareholder]]s, not to those affected by their actions. Such companies may be larger than the economies of some of the states within which they operate, and can wield significant economic and political power. No international treaties exist to specifically cover the behaviour of companies with regard to human rights, and national legislation is very variable.

==Violations==
{{See also|War|Genocides in history|Human rights defender|Corporate accountability for human rights violations}}
{{category see also|Human rights abuses}}

'''Human rights violations''' occur when actions by state (or non-state) actors abuse, ignore, or deny basic human rights (including civil, political, cultural, social, and economic rights). Furthermore, violations of human rights can occur when any state or non-state actor breaches any part of the UDHR treaty or other international human rights or humanitarian law.&lt;ref&gt;There is an ongoing debate on the relationship between the two branches of law.

&lt;/ref&gt; In regard to human rights violations of [[United Nations]] laws, Article 39 of the [[United Nations Charter]] designates the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] (or an appointed authority) as the only tribunal that may determine UN human rights violations.

Human rights abuses are monitored by United Nations committees, national institutions and governments and by many independent [[non-governmental organisations]], such as [[Amnesty International]], [[International Federation of Human Rights]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[World Organisation Against Torture]], [[Freedom House]], [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]] and [[Anti-Slavery International]]. These organisations collect evidence and documentation of alleged human rights abuses and apply pressure to enforce human rights laws.

[[Wars of aggression]], [[war crime]]s and [[crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]], including [[genocide]], are breaches of [[International humanitarian law]] and represent the most serious of human rights violations.

In efforts to eliminate violations of human rights, building awareness and protesting inhumane treatment has often led to calls for action and sometimes improved conditions. The UN Security Council has interceded with peace keeping forces, and other states and treaties (NATO) have intervened in situations to protect human rights.

==Substantive rights==
{{see also|Substantive rights}}

===Right to life===
{{Main|Right to life}}
{{quote|Every human being has the inherent right to life. This right shall be protected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.|Article 6.1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights}}
The right to life is the essential right that a human being has the right not to be killed by another human being. The [[concept]] of a right to life is central to debates on the issues of [[abortion]], [[capital punishment]], [[euthanasia]], [[Self-defense (theory)|self defence]] and [[Just War|war]]. According to many human rights activists, the [[death penalty]] violates this right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty |title=Abolish the death penalty |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[United Nations]] has called on states retaining the death penalty to establish a moratorium on capital punishment with a view to its abolition.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations resolution 62/149.&lt;/ref&gt; States which do not do so face considerable moral and political pressure.

===Freedom from torture===
{{Main|Torture}}

Throughout history, torture has been used as a method of political [[Mind control|re-education]], interrogation, punishment, and coercion. In addition to state-sponsored torture, individuals or groups may be motivated to inflict torture on others for similar reasons to those of a state; however, the motive for torture can also be for the [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] gratification of the torturer, as in the [[Moors murders]].

Since the mid-20th century, torture is prohibited under [[international law]] and the domestic laws of most countries. It is considered to be a violation of human rights, and is declared to be unacceptable by Article 5 of the [[United Nations|UN]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. Signatories of the [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Conventions of 1949]] and the [[Protocol I|Additional Protocols I]] and [[Protocol II|II]] of June 8, 1977 officially agree not to torture captured persons in [[armed conflicts]], whether international or internal. Torture is also prohibited by the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]], which has been ratified by 157 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Despite these international conventions, organisations that monitor abuses of human rights (e.g., [[Amnesty International]], the [[International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims]]) report widespread use condoned by states in many regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amnesty International]] [http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engPOL100012005 Report 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317170847/http://web.amnesty.org/report2006/2af-summary-eng |date=March 17, 2007 |title=Report 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom of speech===
{{Main|Freedom of speech}}
Freedom of speech is the freedom to speak freely without censorship. The term freedom of expression is sometimes used synonymously, but includes any act of seeking, receiving and imparting information or ideas, regardless of the medium used. In practice, the right to freedom of speech is not absolute in any country and the right is commonly subject to limitations, such as on libel, slander, obscenity, blasphemy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Laws Penalizing Blasphemy, Apostasy and Defamation of Religion are Widespread |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/11/21/laws-penalizing-blasphemy-apostasy-and-defamation-of-religion-are-widespread/ |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=Pew Research Center |date=21 November 2012 |quote=s of 2011 nearly half of the countries and territories in the world (47%) have laws or policies that penalize blasphemy, apostasy (abandoning one’s faith) or defamation (disparagement or criticism of particular religions or religion in general).

The right to freedom of expression is recognised as a human right under Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and recognised in international human rights law in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Article 19 of the ICCPR states that "[e]veryone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference" and "everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice".

===Freedom of thought, conscience and religion===
{{Main|Freedom of thought|Conscience|Freedom of religion}}

{{quote|Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.|Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights}}
Freedom of thought, conscience and religion are closely related rights that protect the [[Political freedom|freedom]] of an individual or community, in public or private, to think and freely hold conscientious beliefs and to manifest [[religion]] or [[belief]] in [[religious education|teaching]], practice, [[worship]], and observance; the concept is generally recognised also to include the freedom to [[Religious conversion|change religion]] or [[Irreligion by country|not to follow any religion]].&lt;ref&gt;
[[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], Article 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The freedom to ''leave'' or discontinue membership in a religion or religious group—in religious terms called "[[apostasy]]"—is also a fundamental part of religious freedom, covered by Article 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights |publisher=The United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights groups such as [[Amnesty International]] organises campaigns to protect those arrested and or incarcerated as a [[prisoner of conscience]] because of their conscientious beliefs, particularly concerning intellectual, political and artistic freedom of expression and association.&lt;ref&gt;For example see Jan Brabec, Václav Havel, Ivan Lamper, David Nemec, Petr Placak, Joska Skalnik ''et al.''

Accessed October 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In legislation, a [[conscience clause (medical)|conscience clause]] is a provision in a statute that excuses a health professional from complying with the law (for example legalising surgical or pharmaceutical [[abortion]]) if it is incompatible with religious or conscientious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=White |first1=Katherine A. |title=Crisis of Conscience: Reconciling Religious Health Care Providers' Beliefs and Patients' Rights |journal=Stanford Law Review |date=1999 |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=1703–1749 |doi=10.2307/1229534 |pmid=10558539|url=https://heinonline.org/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/stflr51&amp;section=62 |accessdate=11 August 2018 |jstor=1229534 |hdl=10822/925276 |pmc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom of movement===
{{Main|Freedom of movement}}

Freedom of movement asserts that a citizen of a state in which that citizen is present has the liberty to travel, reside in, and/or work in any part of the state where one pleases within the limits of respect for the liberty and rights of others,&lt;ref name="Gilbert"&gt;Jérémiee Gilbert, ''Nomadic Peoples and Human Rights'' (2014), p. 73: "Freedom of movement within a country encompasses both the right to travel freely within the territory of the State and the right to relocate oneself and to choose one's place of residence".&lt;/ref&gt; and to leave that state and return at any time.

===Rights debates===
Events and new possibilities can affect existing rights or require new ones. Advances of technology, medicine, and philosophy constantly challenge the [[status quo]] of human rights thinking.

'''Right to education'''

UN agencies, such as UNESCO, promote the right to education as a fundamental right. Education encompasses several thematic areas, including comprehensive sexuality education, which is also considered to be relevant for human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf|title=International technical guidance on sexuality education: An evidence-informed approach|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100259-5|location=Paris|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Future generations====
In 1997, [[UNESCO]] adopted the ''Declaration on the Responsibilities of the Present Generation Towards the Future Generation''. The Declaration opens with the words:

{{quote|Mindful of the will of the peoples, set out solemnly in the [[Charter of the United Nations]], to 'save succeeding generations from the scourge of war' and to safeguard the values and principles enshrined in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], and all other relevant instruments of international law.|Declaration on the Responsibilities of the Present Generation Towards the Future Generation}}

Article 1 of the declaration states "the present generations have the responsibility of ensuring that the needs and interests of present and future generations are fully safeguarded". The preamble to the declaration states that "at this point in history, the very existence of humankind and its environment are threatened" and the declaration covers a variety of issues including protection of the [[Natural environment|environment]], the [[human genome]], [[biodiversity]], cultural heritage, [[peace]], development, and [[education]]. The preamble recalls that the responsibilities of the present generations towards future generations has been referred to in various international instruments, including the Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (UNESCO 1972), the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] and the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (Rio de Janeiro, 1992), the [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development]] (UN Conference on Environment and Development, 1992), the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] (World Conference on Human Rights, 1993) and a number of UN General Assembly resolutions relating to the protection of the global climate for present and future generations adopted since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13178&amp;URL_DO=DO_PRINTPAGE&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Declaration on the Responsibilities of the Present Generation Towards the Future Generation |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sexual orientation and gender identity====

[[File:Anjali gopalan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Asia's first [[Genderqueer]] Pride Parade at [[Madurai]] with [[Anjali Gopalan]].]]
Sexual orientation and gender identity rights relate to the expression of [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]] based on the right to respect for private life and the right not to be discriminated against on the ground of "other status" as defined in various human rights conventions, such as article 17 and 26 in the United Nations [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|article 8]] and [[European Convention on Human Rights#Article 14 - discrimination|article 14]] in the European Convention on Human Rights.

As of 2011, homosexual behaviour is illegal in 76 countries and punishable by execution in seven countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A global charter for sexual orientation and gender identity rights has been proposed in the form of the '[[Yogyakarta Principles]]', a set of 29 principles whose authors say they apply [[International Human Rights Law]] statutes and precedent to situations relevant to LGBT people's experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The principles were presented at a [[United Nations]] event in New York on November 7, 2007, co-sponsored by [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]] and [[Uruguay]].

The principles have been acknowledged with influencing the French proposed [[Sexual orientation and gender identity at the United Nations|UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity]], which focuses on ending violence, criminalisation and capital punishment and does not include dialogue about same-sex marriage or right to start a family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franceonu.org/spip.php?article4092 |title=Sexual orientation and gender identity |publisher=France Onu |accessdate=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The proposal was supported by 67 of the then 192 member countries of the United Nations, including all [[European Union|EU]] member states and the United States. An alternative statement opposing the proposal was initiated by [[Syria]] and signed by 57 member nations, including all 27 nations of the [[Arab League]] as well as [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

====Trade====
Although both the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] emphasise the importance of a right to work, neither of these documents explicitly mention free trade as a mechanism for ensuring this fundamental right. And yet trade plays a key role in providing jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some experts argue that trade is inherent to human nature and that when governments inhibit international trade they directly inhibit the right to work and the other indirect benefits, like the right to education, that increased work and investment help accrue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Others have argued that the ability to trade does not affect everyone equally—often groups like the rural poor, indigenous groups and women are less likely to access the benefits of increased trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On the other hand, others think that it is no longer primarily individuals but companies that trade, and therefore it cannot be guaranteed as a human right.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Additionally, trying to fit too many concepts under the umbrella of what qualifies as a human right has the potential to dilute their importance. Finally, it is difficult to define a right to trade as either "fair"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Water and sanitation====
{{Main|Human right to water and sanitation}}
{{See also|Water politics}}

The right to water has been recognised in a wide range of international documents, including treaties, declarations and other standards. For instance, the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women ([[CEDAW]]) requires State parties to ensure to women the right to "enjoy adequate living conditions, particularly in relation to … water supply". The 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) requires States parties to combat disease and malnutrition "through the provision of adequate nutritious foods and clean drinking-water".

The most clear definition of the human right to water has been issued by the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. This treaty body interpreting legal obligations of State parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights ([[ICESCR]]) issued in 2002 a non-binding interpretation affirming that access to water was a condition for the enjoyment of the [[right to an adequate standard of living]] and inextricably related to the right to the highest attainable standard of health (see ICESCR Art. 11 &amp; 12) and therefore a human right:

{{quote|The human right to water entitles everyone to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic uses.|United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights}}

On July 28, 2010, the United Nations General Assembly declared water and [[sanitation]] as human rights. Since then, all States have at least ratified one human rights convention which explicitly or implicitly recognises the right, and they all have signed at least one political declaration recognising this right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/human_right_to_water.shtml|title=International Decade for Action 'Water for Life' 2005-2015.

====Sexual and reproductive rights====
{{Main|reproductive rights}}
Human rights include women's rights and sexual and reproductive rights. Sexual and reproductive rights are part of a continuum of human rights, which includes the rights to life, health and education, the rights to equality and non-discrimination, and the right to decide the timing, number and spacing of one's children.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/human-rights|title=Human rights - UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund|website=www.unfpa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="COOK"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Cook|first1= Rebecca J. |last2= Fathalla |first2= Mahmoud F.|date=September 1996|title= Advancing Reproductive Rights Beyond Cairo and Beijing|journal= International Family Planning Perspectives|volume= 22|issue= 3|pages= 115–121|doi= 10.2307/2950752|jstor= 2950752|ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reproductive and sexual rights as part of human rights was affirmed internationally at the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo in 1994.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"/&gt; It was the first among international development frameworks to address issues related to sexuality, sexual and reproductive health, and reproductive rights.&lt;ref name="Commitment"&gt;{{cite web|title=FROM COMMITMENT TO ACTION ON SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND RIGHTS|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/Final_UNFPA-UPR-ASSESSMENT_270814..pdf|publisher=[[United Nations Population Fund|UNFPA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICPD Programme of Action in paragraph 7.2 "defines an individual's sexual and reproductive health as complete well-being related to sexual activity and reproduction. Sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) encompass both entitlements and freedoms. This includes the definition of reproductive rights in paragraph 7.3 of the ICPD PoA, which clarifies that these are not a new set of rights but human rights in existing human rights instruments related to sexual and reproductive autonomy and the attainment of sexual and reproductive health.&lt;ref name="Reproductive rights"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reproductive Rights are Human Rights|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/NHRIHandbook.pdf|publisher=[[United Nations Population Fund|UNFPA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the 1995 Beijing Platform for Action (PfA) expands this definition to cover both sexuality and reproduction by affirming in paragraph 96 the right to exercise control over and make decisions about one’s sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence."&lt;ref name="Commitment"/&gt;

====World Health Organisation====
Reproductive rights were first established as a subset of human rights at the United Nations 1968 International Conference on Human Rights.&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN" /&gt; The sixteenth article of the resulting Proclamation of Teheran states, "Parents have a basic human right to determine [[Freedom of will|freely]] and [[Moral responsibility|responsibly]] the number and the spacing of their children."&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN"&gt;{{cite journal

====Information and communication technologies====
{{Main|Right to Internet access |Digital rights}}

In October 2009, [[Finland]]'s [[Ministry of Transport and Communications (Finland)|Ministry of Transport and Communications]] announced that every person in Finland would have the legal right to Internet access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since July 2010, the government has legally obligated [[telecommunications companies]] to offer broadband Internet access to every permanent residence and office. The connection must be "reasonably priced" and have a downstream rate of at least 1 Mbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==== Right to non-refoulement vs. right to asylum ====
Non-refoulement is the right not to be returned to a place of persecution and is the foundation for international refugee law, as outlined in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Convention relating to the Status of Refugees|url = http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/StatusOfRefugees.aspx|website = www.ohchr.org|accessdate = September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the right to non-refoulement and the right to asylum have taken centre stage in recent debates over the treatment of refugees. A central worry about the right to asylum is that it can limit a state's power to handle a mass influx of refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Frontier Justice: The Global Refugee Crisis and What To Do About It|url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Frontier_Justice.html?id=VRSQQO-O0u0C|publisher = Doubleday Canada|date = April 5, 2011|isbn = 9780307367921|first = Andy|last = Lamey|pages = 141–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Processing asylum applications can take a considerable amount of time, and this amount rises with the number of refugees applying. This creates an incentive for more refugees to apply, since they are allowed to stay in the country during the application process. One potential solution to the problem of mass influx is proposed by U.S.-based political philosopher Andy Lamey. Lamey proposes a portable procedural model that focuses on the right to non-refoulement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Frontier Justice: The Global Refugee Crisis and What To Do About It|url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Frontier_Justice.html?id=VRSQQO-O0u0C|publisher = Doubleday Canada|date = April 5, 2011|isbn = 9780307367921|first = Andy|last = Lamey|pages = 232–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crucially, the procedural rights defended by this model can be applied outside national borders, within any rights respecting country; this allows the burden of mass influx to be shared by a plurality of countries without violating the procedural rights of the refugee.

==Relationship with other topics==

===The environment===
There are two basic conceptions of environmental human rights in the current human rights system. The first is that the right to a healthy or adequate environment is itself a human right (as seen in both Article 24 of the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]], and Article 11 of the San Salvador Protocol to the [[American Convention on Human Rights]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title= OAS – Organization of American States: Democracy for peace, security, and development
 |publisher= Oas.org
 |accessdate= August 29, 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The second conception is the idea that environmental human rights can be derived from other human rights, usually – the right to life, the right to health, the right to private family life and the right to property (among many others). This second theory enjoys much more widespread use in human rights courts around the world, as those rights are contained in many human rights documents.

The onset of various [[List of environmental issues|environmental issues]], especially [[climate change]], has created potential conflicts between different human rights. Human rights ultimately require a working ecosystem and healthy environment, but the granting of certain rights to individuals may damage these. Such as the conflict between right to decide number of offspring and the common need for a healthy environment, as noted in the [[tragedy of the commons]].&lt;ref name="hardin68"&gt;Garrett Hardin, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/162/3859/1243 "The Tragedy of the Commons"], ''Science'', Vol. 162, No. 3859 (December 13, 1968), pp. 1243–1248. Also available here [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/162/3859/1243.pdf] and [http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_tragedy_of_the_commons.html here.]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the area of environmental rights, the responsibilities of multinational corporations, so far relatively unaddressed by human rights legislation, is of paramount consideration.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

[[Environmental rights]] revolve largely around the idea of a right to a livable environment both for the present and the future generations.

Rights that cannot be derogated for reasons of national security in any circumstances are known as [[Peremptory norm|peremptory norms or ''jus cogens'']]. Such [[United Nations Charter]] obligations are binding on all states and cannot be modified by treaty.

===Relativism and universalism===
{{Main|Cultural relativism|Moral relativism|Moral universalism}}
[[File:White mans burden the journal detroit.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Relativists argue that human rights must avoid pushing the values of a single culture at the expense of others. "[[The White Man's Burden]]" is seen as an example of the West using the spread of Western culture as a justification for colonisation.]]
[[File:Fgm map.gif|right|thumb|upright=0.9|Universalists argue that some practices violate the norms of all human cultures. They point out that although [[Female genital mutilation]] is prevalent in Africa, no religion supports the practice, and the tradition is in violation of women's rights.]]

The UDHR enshrines universal rights that apply to all humans equally, whichever geographical location, state, race or culture they belong to. However, in academia there is a dispute between scholars that advocate [[moral relativism]] and scholars that advocate [[moral universalism]]. Relativists do not argue against human rights, but concede that human rights are [[Social constructionism|socially constructed]] and are shaped by cultural and environmental contexts. Universalists argue that human rights have always existed, and apply to all people regardless of culture, race, sex, or religion.

More specifically, proponents of cultural relativism argue for acceptance of different cultures, which may have practices conflicting with human rights. Relativists caution that universalism could be used as a form of cultural, economic or political imperialism. [[The White Man's Burden]] is used as an example of imperialism and the destruction of local cultures justified by the desire to spread [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] values.&lt;ref&gt;"Eurocentrism". In ''Encyclopedia of the Developing World''. Ed. Thomas M. Leonard, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2006, {{ISBN|0-415-97662-6}}, p. 636.&lt;/ref&gt;
In particular, the concept of human rights is often claimed to be fundamentally rooted in a politically [[liberalism|liberal]] outlook which, although generally accepted in Europe, [[human rights in Japan|Japan]] or North America, is not necessarily taken as standard elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Opponents of relativism argue that some practices exist that violate the norms of all human cultures. A common example is [[female genital mutilation]], which occurs in different cultures in Africa, Asia and South America.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} It is not mandated by any religion, but has become a tradition in many cultures. It is considered a violation of women's and girl's rights by much of the international community, and is outlawed in some countries.

The former Prime Ministers of [[Singapore]], [[Lee Kuan Yew]], and of [[Malaysia]], [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]] both claimed in the 1990s that ''[[Asian values]]'' were significantly different from Western values and included a sense of loyalty and foregoing personal freedoms for the sake of social stability and prosperity, and therefore authoritarian government is more appropriate in Asia than democracy. [[Lee Kuan Yew]] argued that:

{{quote|What Asians value may not necessarily be what Americans or Europeans value. Westerners value the freedoms and liberties of the individual. As an Asian of Chinese cultural background, my values are for a government which is honest, effective, and efficient.|[[Lee Kuan Yew]], ''Democracy, Human Rights and the Realities'', Tokyo, Nov 10, 1992&lt;ref&gt;Halper, Stefan. ''The Beijing consensus''. p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In response, critics have pointed out that cultural relativism could be used as a justification for authoritarianism. An example is in 1981, when the Iranian representative to the [[United Nations]], Said Rajaie-Khorassani, articulated the position of his country regarding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by saying that the UDHR was "a [[Secularism|secular]] understanding of the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition", which could not be implemented by Muslims without trespassing the Islamic law.&lt;ref name="Littman1999"&gt;Littman (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;
The Asian Values argument was criticised by Mahathir's former deputy:

{{quote|To say that freedom is Western or unAsian is to offend our traditions as well as our forefathers, who gave their lives in the struggle against tyranny and injustices.|[[Anwar Ibrahim|A. Ibrahim]] in his keynote speech to the Asian Press Forum titled ''Media and Society in Asia'', December 2, 1994}}

and by Singapore's opposition leader [[Chee Soon Juan]], who states that it is racist to assert that Asians do not want human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Ball|Gready|2006|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defenders of moral universalism argue that relativistic arguments neglect the fact that modern human rights are new to all cultures, dating back no further than the UDHR in 1948. They argue that the UDHR was drafted by people from many different cultures and traditions, including a US Roman Catholic, a Chinese Confucian philosopher, a French zionist and a representative from the Arab League, amongst others, and drew upon advice from thinkers such as Mahatma Gandhi.&lt;ref name="Gready34"/&gt; [[Michael Ignatieff]] has argued that cultural relativism is almost exclusively an argument used by those who wield power in cultures which commit human rights abuses, and that those whose human rights are compromised are the powerless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Ignatieff|2001|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This reflects the fact that the difficulty in judging universalism versus relativism lies in who is claiming to represent a particular culture.

Although the argument between universalism and relativism is far from complete, it is an academic discussion in that all international human rights instruments adhere to the principle that human rights are universally applicable. The [[2005 World Summit]] reaffirmed the international community's adherence to this principle:

{{quote|The universal nature of human rights and freedoms is beyond question.|2005 World Summit, paragraph 121}}

[[Image:Dibujo de mujer caribe.jpg|thumb|upright|Drawing of a Carib woman (1888)]]
The '''Island Carib''', also known as the '''Kalinago'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/general/change-from-carib-to-kalinago-now-official |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308065123/http://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/general/change-from-carib-to-kalinago-now-official/ |archivedate=2016-03-08 |df= }}, "Change from Carib to Kalinago now official", Dominica News Online&lt;/ref&gt; or simply '''Caribs''', are an [[indigenous peoples of the Caribbean|indigenous people]] of the [[Lesser Antilles]] in the [[Caribbean]]. They may have descended from the [[Mainland Caribs]] (Kalina) of South America, but they spoke an unrelated language known as [[Island Carib language|Island Carib]].

At the time of [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish contact]], the Kalinagos were one of the dominant groups in the Caribbean, which owes its name to them. They lived throughout the [[Windward Islands]], [[Dominica]], and possibly the southern [[Leeward Islands]]. Historically, it was thought their ancestors were mainland Caribs, known as the [[Igneri]]. The Igneri had conquered the islands from their previous inhabitants. However, linguistic and archaeological evidence disputes the notion of a mass emigration and conquest; the Island Carib language appears not to have been [[Cariban languages|Cariban]], but [[Arawakan|Arawakan,]] like that of their neighbors, the [[Taíno]]. Irving Rouse and others suggest that a smaller group of mainland Caribs conquered the islands without displacing their inhabitants, eventually adopting the local language but retaining their traditions of a South American origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rouse |first= Irving |date= 1992 |title= The Tainos |url= https://books.google.com/?id=sgjsDvFiNuUC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=%22Island+Carib%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Island%20Carib%22&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= Yale University Press |page= 21 |isbn= 0300051816 |accessdate= May 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early colonial period, the Caribs had a reputation as warriors who raided neighboring islands. They practiced [[cannibalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rouse |first= Irving |date= 1992 |title= The Tainos |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=sgjsDvFiNuUC&amp;pg=PA40 |location= |publisher= Yale University Press |pages= 22–23 |isbn= 0300051816 |accessdate= May 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Spanish conquistadores, the Carib Indians were cannibals who regularly ate roasted human flesh. There is evidence as to the taking of human trophies and the ritual cannibalism of war captives among both Carib and other Amerindian groups such as the Arawak and Tupinamba. Today, the Caribs and their descendants continue to live in the Antilles. The [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]] or "[[Black Caribs]]", a group of mixed Carib and African ancestry, also live principally in Central America.

==History==
The Caribs are believed to have migrated from the [[Orinoco]] River area in South America to settle in the Caribbean islands about 1200 AD, according to [[carbon dating]] {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}. Over the two centuries leading up to [[Christopher Columbus]]' arrival in the Caribbean archipelago in 1492, the Caribs mostly displaced the [[Maipurean language|Maipurean]]-speaking [[Taínos]] by warfare, extermination, and assimilation. The Taíno had settled the island chains earlier in history, migrating from the mainland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diaspora.uiuc.edu/news0307/news0307-7.pdf Sweeney, James L. (2007). "Caribs, Maroons, Jacobins, Brigands, and Sugar Barons: The Last Stand of the Black Caribs on St. Vincent"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227183833/http://www.diaspora.uiuc.edu/news0307/news0307-7.pdf |date=2012-02-27 }}, ''African Diaspora Archaeology Network'', University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, March 2007, retrieved 26 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Caribs traded with the Eastern [[Taíno]] of the [[Caribbean Islands]].

The Caribs produced the [[silver]] products which [[Juan Ponce de León|Ponce de Leon]] found in Taíno communities. None of the insular Amerindians mined for gold but obtained it by trade from the mainland. The Caribs were skilled boat builders and sailors. They appeared to have owed their dominance in the Caribbean basin to their mastery of warfare.

According to Floyd, "The question arose in [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus's]] time whether Indians could be enslaved and [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabel]] had ruled against it.  At about the same time, however, [[Alonso de Ojeda|Ojeda]], [[Rodrigo de Bastidas|Bastidas]], and other explorers voyaging along the [[Spanish Main]] had been attacked by Indians with poisoned arrows - all such Indians were considered Caribs - which took a considerable toll of Spanish lives.  These attacks and the evidence some of the perpetrators, at least, were cannibals, provided the rationale for the decree authorizing enslavement of Caribs."  On 3 June 1511, king [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] declared war on the Caribs.&lt;ref name="Floyd"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Floyd|first1=Troy|title=The Columbus Dynasty in the Caribbean, 1492-1526|date=1973|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque|pages=133–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Island Caribs nevertheless mostly succeeded in keeping their islands unoccupied by Spaniards.

In the 17th century, Island Caribs were displaced with a great loss of life by a new wave of European invaders: French and English. Most fatalities resulted from [[Eurasia]]n infectious diseases such as [[smallpox]], which they had no natural [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to, as well as warfare.

In  1660, France and England signed with Island Caribs the [[Treaty of Saint Charles]] that stipulated that Caribs would evacuate all the Lesser Antilles except for [[Dominica]] and [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Saint Vincent]], which were recognized as reserves. However, the English would later ignore the treaty and ended up annexing both islands in 1763.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Guadeloupe amérindienne|last=Delpuech|first=André|date=2001|publisher=Monum, éditions du patrimoine|year=|isbn=9782858223671|location=Paris|pages=46–51|oclc=48617879}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this date, a small population of around 3,000 Caribs survives in the [[Carib Territory]] in northeast Dominica.

The  'Black Caribs' (later known as ''[[Garifuna people|carifuna]]'') of [[Saint Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]] ([[Saint Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]] has some "Yellow Caribs" as well) were descended from a group of [[slavery|enslaved]] [[Africans]] who were [[Maroon (people)|marooned]] from shipwrecks of slave ships,  as well as slaves who escaped here.  [[Chief Kairouane]] and his men from [[Grenada]] jumped off of the “Leapers Hill" rather than face slavery under the French invaders and have served as an iconic representation of the Caribs spirit of resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/296122225 | title=Genocide, Narrative, And Indigenous Exile From the Caribbean Archipelago | author=Newton, Melanie J. | journal=Caribbean Quarterly | year=2014 | volume=60 | issue=2 | pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/296121904/ | title=French pioneers in the West Indies, 1624-1664 | publisher=New York: Columbia university press | author=Crouse, Nellis Maynard | year=1940 | pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/?id=E4x_YUWVcKgC&amp;pg=PA288&amp;dq=Kairouane+Parquet#v=onepage&amp;q=Kairouane%20Parquet&amp;f=false | title=Origines Francaises des Pays D'outre-mer, Les seigneurs de la Martinique | author=Margry, Pierre | journal=La Revue maritime | year=1878 | pages=287–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They intermarried with the Carib and formed the last native culture to resist the British. It was not until 1795 that [[British people|British]] [[colonists]] deported the Black Caribs to [[Roatan]] Island, off [[Honduras]]. Their descendants continue to live there today and are known as the [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]] ethnic group. Carib resistance delayed the settlement of Dominica by Europeans. The Black Carib communities that remained in St. Vincent and Dominica retained a degree of autonomy well into the 19th century.

The last known speakers of Island Carib died in the 1930s, and the language is [[extinct language|extinct]].

The Kalinago of Dominica maintained their independence for many years by taking advantage of the island's rugged terrain. The island's east coast includes a {{convert|3700|acre|km2|sing=on}} territory formerly known as the [[Carib Territory]] that was granted to the people by the British [[The Crown|Crown]] in 1903. There are only 3,000 Caribs remaining. They elect their own chief. In July 2003, the Kalinago observed 100 Years of Territory. In July 2014, Charles Williams was elected Kalinago Chief,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avirtualdominica.com/caribs.htm "The Carib Indians"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026103236/http://avirtualdominica.com/caribs.htm |date=2010-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who succeeded Chief Garnette Joseph.

Several hundred ethnic Carib descendants live in Puerto Rico, the [[United States Virgin Islands|U. S. Virgin Islands]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis|St. Kitts &amp; Nevis]], [[Antigua and Barbuda|Antigua &amp; Barbuda]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]], Dominica, Saint Lucia, Grenada, [[Trinidad]] and St. Vincent. "[[Black Caribs]]," the descendants of the mixture of African slaves live in St. Vincent whose total population is unknown. Some ethnic Carib communities remain on the American mainland, in countries such as [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Brazil]], [[French Guiana]], [[Guyana]] and [[Suriname]] in South America, and [[Belize]] in Central America. The size of these communities varies widely.

==Religion==
The Caribs are believed to have practiced [[polytheism]]. As the Spanish began to colonise the Caribbean area, they wanted to convert the natives to [[Catholicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Menhinick, Kevin, [http://www.avirtualdominica.com/caribs3.htm "The Caribs in Dominica"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303082342/http://www.avirtualdominica.com/caribs3.htm |date=2012-03-03 }}, Copyright © Delphis Ltd. 1997–2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
{{main article|Garifuna music}}
Garifuna music from the [[Garifuna people]], the descendants of Caribs, Arawak and West African people, is quite different from the music in the rest of [[Central America]]. The most famous form is [[punta]].  Its associated musical style, which has the dancers move their hips in a circular motion. An evolved form of traditional music, still usually played using traditional instruments, punta has seen some modernization and electrification in the 1970s; this is called [[punta rock]].  Traditional punta dancing is consciously competitive. Artists like [[Pen Cayetano]] helped innovate modern punta rock by adding [[guitar]]s to the traditional music, and paved the way for later artists like [[Andy Palacio]], [[Children of the Most High]] and [[Black Coral]]. Punta was popular across the region, especially in Belize, by the mid-1980s, culminating in the release of ''[[Punta Rockers]]'' in 1987, a compilation featuring many of the genre's biggest stars.

Other forms of Garifuna music and dance include: hungu-hungu, combination, wanaragua, abaimahani, matamuerte, laremuna wadaguman, gunjai, sambai, charikanari, eremuna egi, paranda, berusu, punta rock, teremuna ligilisi, arumahani, and Mali-amalihani. Punta is the most popular dance in Garifuna culture.  It is performed around holidays and at parties and other social events. Punta lyrics are usually composed by the women. [[Chumba]] and [[hunguhungu]] are a circular dance in a three-beat rhythm, which is often combined with punta. There are other songs typical to each gender, women having [[eremwu eu]] and [[abaimajani]], rhythmic [[a cappella]] songs, and [[laremuna wadaguman]], men's [[work song]]s, [[chumba]] and [[hunguhungu]], a circular dance in a three-beat rhythm, which is often combined with punta.

Drums play a very important role in Garifuna music. There are primarily two types of drums used: the ''primero'' (tenor drum) and the ''segunda'' (bass drum). These drums are typically made of hollowed-out hardwood such as mahogany or mayflower, with the skins coming from the peccary (wild bush pig), deer, or sheep.

Also used in combination with the drums are the ''sisera''. These shakers are made from the dried fruit of the gourd tree, filled with seeds, then fitted with hardwood handles.

Paranda music developed soon after the Garifunas arrival in Central America. The music is instrumental and [[percussion instrument|percussion]]-based.  The music was barely recorded until the 1990s, when [[Ivan Duran]] of [[Stonetree Records]] began the [[Paranda Project]].

In contemporary Belize there has been a resurgence of Garifuna music, popularized by musicians such as Andy Palacio, Mohobub Flores, &amp; Adrian Martinez. These musicians have taken many aspects from traditional Garifuna music forms and fused them with more modern sounds. Described as a mixture of punta rock and paranda. One great example is Andy Palacio's album ''Watina'', and ''Umalali: The Garifuna Women's Project'', both released on the Belizean record label Stonetree Records.

In the Garifuna culture, there is another dance called Dugu. This dance is a ritual done for a death in the family to pay their respect to their loved ones. In 2001, Garifuna music was proclaimed one of the [[masterpieces of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity]] by [[UNESCO]].

==Ancestral honor==

The [[Island Carib language|Island Carib]] word ''karibna'' meant "person". It became the origin of the English "cannibal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harper|first1=Douglas|title=Cannibal|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cannibal|website=Online Etymological Dictionary|accessdate=12 February 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212222145/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cannibal|archivedate=12 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, among the Caribs, it was apparently associated with rituals related to the eating of war enemies. There is evidence as to the taking of human trophies and the ritual cannibalism of war captives among both Arawak and other Amerindian groups such as the Carib and Tupinamba. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/jsa_0037-9174_1984_num_70_1_2239|title=Carib cannibalism. The historical evidence|first=Neil L.|last=Whitehead|date=20 March 1984|publisher=|journal=Journal de la Société des Américanistes|volume=70|issue=1|pages=69–87|doi=10.3406/jsa.1984.2239}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Caribs had a tradition of keeping bones of their ancestors in their houses. [[Missionaries]], such as Père [[Jean Baptiste Labat]] and [[Cesar de Rochefort]], described the practice as part of a belief that the ancestral spirits would always look after the bones and protect their descendants. The Caribs have been described as vicious and violent people in the history of the people who battled against other tribes.

Italian explorer [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] was killed and said to have been eaten by Carib natives on what is now [[Guadeloupe]] (French West Indies) in 1528 (before called ''Karukera'' by the Amerindian people which means “the island of beautiful waters”), during his third voyage to North America, after exploring [[Florida]], [[the Bahamas]] and the [[Lesser Antilles]].

In 1997 [[Dominica]] artist Jacob Frederick and [[Tortola]] artist Aragorn Dick Read joined forces and set out to build a traditional canoe based on the fishing canoes still used in Dominica, [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Martinique]]. The project consisted of a return voyage by canoe to the Orinoco delta to meet up with the Kalinago tribes still living in those parts. On the way a cultural assessment was carried out and ties were reestablished with the remaining communities along the island chain. A documentary, ''The Quest of the Carib Canoe,'' was made by the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;Quest of the Carib Canoe {{cite web |url=http://www.nativenetworks.si.edu/eng/orange/quest_of_the_carib_canoe.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911042932/http://nativenetworks.si.edu/eng/orange/quest_of_the_carib_canoe.htm |archivedate=2013-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition sent shock waves through the Lesser Antilles as it made the local governments aware of the presence and the struggles for cultural survival of the Kalinago.

{{Sociolinguistics}}

'''Language planning''' (also known as '''language engineering''') is a deliberate effort to influence the function, structure, or acquisition of [[languages]] or [[dialects|language variety]] within a [[speech community]].&lt;ref name= Kaplan&gt;Kaplan B., Robert, and Richard B. Baldauf Jr. ''Language Planning from Practice to Theory.''  Clevedon: Multilingual Matters ltd., 1997&lt;/ref&gt; It is often associated with [[government]] planning, but is also used by a variety of [[non-governmental organization]]s, such as grass-roots organizations, and individuals. Goals of such planning vary. Better communication through assimilation of a single dominant language can bring economic benefits to minorities but is also perceived to facilitate their political domination.&lt;ref name=Cobarrubias&gt;Cobarrubias, Juan.  "Ethical Issues in Status Planning."  ''Progress in Language Planning: International Perspectives''.  Eds. Juan Cobarrubias and Joshua Fishman.  New York: Mouton Publishers, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the establishment of language regulators, such as formal or informal agencies, committees, societies or academies, to design or develop new structures to meet contemporary needs.&lt;ref&gt;''Language: An Introduction,'' Lehmann, W.P., 1983, Random House&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ideology ==

Four overarching [[language ideology|language ideologies]] motivate decision making in language planning.&lt;ref name=Cobarrubias /&gt;  The first, linguistic assimilation, is the belief that every member of a society, irrespective of their [[First language|native language]], should learn and use the dominant language of the society in which they live.  An example is the [[English-only movement]] of some residents of the [[United States]].

In contrast is the second ideology, linguistic pluralism - the recognition and support of multiple languages within one society.  Examples include the coexistence of [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Romansh language|Romansh]] in [[Switzerland]]; and the shared official status of [[English language|English]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], and [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]] in [[Singapore]].  The coexistence of many languages may not necessarily arise from a conscious language ideology, but rather related to the relative efficiency in communication of a common language.

The third ideology, vernacularization, denotes the restoration and development of an indigenous language, along with its adoption by the state as an [[official language]].  Examples include [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] in the state of [[Israel]] and [[Quechua language|Quechua]] in [[Peru]].

The final ideology, internationalization, is the adoption of a non-indigenous language as a means of wider communication, as an official language or in a particular domain, such as the use of English in [[India]], Singapore, the [[Philippines]], [[Papua New Guinea]], and [[South Africa]].

==Goals==

Eleven language planning goals have been recognized (Nahir 2003):&lt;ref name=Nahir&gt;Nahir, Moshe. "Language Planning Goals: A Classification." ''Sociolinguistics: The Essential Readings.'' Eds.  Paulston, Christina Bratt and G. Richard Tucker.  Oxford: Blackwell, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
# Language Purification – prescription of usage in order to preserve the "[[linguistic purism|linguistic purity]]" of language, protect language from foreign influences, and guard against language deviation from within
# [[Language revitalization|Language Revival]] – the attempt to restore to common use a language that has few or no surviving native speakers&lt;ref&gt;Linguist Ghil'ad Zuckermann claims that any attempt to revive a no-longer spoken language is likely to end up with a hybrid - see Zuckermann, Ghil'ad, [http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Hybridity_versus_Revivability.pdf "Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns"]. In ''Journal of Language Contact'', Varia 2 (2009), 40-67.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Language reform|Language Reform]] – deliberate change in specific aspects of language, such as [[orthography]], [[spelling]], or [[grammar]], in order to facilitate use
# Language Standardization – the attempt to garner [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] for a regional language or dialect, developing it as the chosen major language, or [[standard language]], of a [[region]]
# Language Spread – the attempt to increase the number of speakers of a language
# Lexical Modernization – word creation or adaptation
# Terminology Unification – development of unified [[terminology|terminologies]], primarily in technical domains
# Stylistic Simplification – simplification of language usage in [[lexicon]], grammar, and style. That includes modifying the use of language in social and formal contexts.
# Interlingual Communication – facilitation of linguistic communication between members of distinct speech communities
# Language Maintenance – preservation of the use of a group's native language as a first or [[second language]] where pressures threaten or cause a decline in the status of the language
# Auxiliary-Code Standardization – standardization of marginal, auxiliary aspects of language, such as signs for the deaf, place names, or rules of [[transliteration]] and [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]

== Types ==
Language planning has been divided into three types:

=== Status planning ===
Status planning is the allocation or reallocation of a language or variety to functional domains within a society, thus affecting the status, or standing, of a language.

==== Language status ====
Language status is a concept distinct from, though intertwined with, language [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] and language function. Strictly speaking, language status is the position or standing of a language vis-à-vis other languages.&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;Edwards, John. "Language, Prestige, and Stigma," in ''Contact Linguistics''. Ed. Hans Goebel. New York: de Gruyter, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; A language garners status according to the fulfillment of four attributes, described in 1968 by two different authors, [[Heinz Kloss]] and [[William Alexander Stewart|William Stewart]]. Both Kloss and Stewart stipulated four qualities of a language that determine its status. Their respective frameworks differ slightly, but they emphasize four common attributes:
# Language origin – whether a given language is indigenous or imported to the speech community
# Degree of standardization – the extent of development of a formal set of norms that define 'correct' usage
# Juridical status
##Sole official language (e.g. French in France and Turkish in Turkey)
##Joint official language (e.g. English and [[Afrikaans]] in [[South Africa]]; French, German, Italian and Romansh in Switzerland)
##Regional official language (e.g. [[Igbo language|Igbo]] in [[Nigeria]]; [[Marathi language|Marathi]] in [[Maharashtra]], India)
##Promoted language – lacks official status on a national or regional level but is promoted and sometimes used by public authorities for specific functions (e.g. [[Spanish people|Spanish]] in [[New Mexico]]; [[West African Pidgin English]] in [[Cameroon]])
##Tolerated language – neither promoted nor proscribed; acknowledged but ignored (e.g. [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]] in the [[United States]] in present day)
##Proscribed language – discouraged by official sanction or restriction (e.g. Galician, Basque and Catalan during [[Francisco Franco]]'s regime in Spain; [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] in [[Greece]]);&lt;ref name=Wardhaugh&gt;Wardhaugh, Ronald. "Planning," in ''An Introduction to Sociolinguistics''. Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; indigenous American languages during the [[American Indian boarding schools|boarding school era]]&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;cite [http://www.sagchip.org/ziibiwing/planyourvisit/pdf/aibscurrguide.pdf Jennifer Jones, Dee Ann Bosworth, Amy Lonetree,  "American Indian Boarding Schools: An Exploration of Global Ethnic &amp; Cultural Cleansing"], Ziibiwing Center of Anishinabe Culture &amp; Lifeways, 2011, accessed 25 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
#Vitality – the ratio, or percent, of users of a language to another variable, like the total population.&lt;ref name=Cobarrubias/&gt; Kloss and Stewart both distinguish six classes of statistical distribution. However, they draw the line between classes at different percentages. According to Kloss, the first class, the highest level of vitality, is demarcated by 90% or more speakers. The five remaining classes in decreasing order are 70–89%, 40–69%, 20–39%, 3–19%, and less than 3%. Stewart defines the six classes are determined by the following percentages of speakers: 75%, 50%, 25%, 10%, 5%, and less than 5%.

Together, origin, degree of standardization, juridical status, and vitality express a language's status.

William Stewart outlines ten functional domains in language planning:&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;Stewart, William A.  "Sociolinguistic Typology of Multilingualism," in ''Readings in the Sociology of Language''.  Ed. Joshua Fishman.  The Hague: Mouton Publishers, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; 
#Official – An official language "function[s] as a legally appropriate language for all politically and culturally representative purposes on a nationwide basis."&lt;ref name=Stewart /&gt;  Often, the official function of a language is specified in a [[constitution]].
#Provincial – A provincial language functions as an official language for a geographic area smaller than a nation, typically a [[province]] or [[region]] (e.g. French in [[Quebec]])&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;Cooper, Robert L.  ''Language Planning and Social Change''.  New York: Cambridge University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Wider communication – A language of wider communication is a language that may be official or provincial, but more importantly, functions as a medium of communication across language boundaries within a nation (e.g. [[Hindi]] in India; [[Swahili language]] in [[East Africa]])&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#International – An international language functions as a medium of communication across national boundaries (e.g. English, formerly French as a diplomatic and international language)&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#Capital – A capital language functions as a prominent language in and around a national [[capital (political)|capital]] (e.g. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and French in [[Brussels]])&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#Group – A group language functions as a conventional language among the members of a single cultural or ethnic group (e.g. Hebrew amongst the [[Jews]])&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#Educational – An educational language functions as a medium of instruction in [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education|secondary]] schools on a regional or national basis ([[Urdu]] in [[West Pakistan]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]] in [[East Pakistan]])&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#School subject – A school subject language is a language that is taught as a subject in secondary school or [[higher education]] (e.g. [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Ancient Greek]] in English-language schools)&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#Literary – A literary language functions as a language for [[literature|literary]] or [[scholarly]] purposes (Ancient Greek)&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;
#Religious – A religious language functions as a language for the ritual purposes of a particular religion (e.g. Latin for the [[Latin Rite]] within the [[Roman Catholic Church]]; [[Arabic]] for the reading of the [[Qur'an]])&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;

Robert Cooper, in reviewing Stewart's list, makes several additions.  First, he creates three sub-types of official functions: statutory, working, and symbolic.&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt;  A statutory language is a language that a government has declared official by law. A working language is a language that a government uses as a medium for daily activities, and a symbolic language is a language that is a [[symbol]] of the state. Cooper also adds two functional domains to Stewart's list: mass media and work.

===Corpus planning===
Corpus planning refers to the [[linguistic prescription|prescriptive]] intervention in the forms of a language, whereby planning decisions are made to engineer changes in the structure of the language.&lt;ref name=FergusonG&gt;Ferguson, Gibson. (2006). ''Language Planning and Education.'' Edinburgh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Corpus planning activities often arise as the result of beliefs about the adequacy of the form of a language to serve desired functions.&lt;ref name=Hornberger&gt;Hornberger, Nancy H. (2006). "Frameworks and Models in Language Policy and Planning", in Thomas Ricento, ''An Introduction to Language Policy'', Wiley-Blackwell, pp 24-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike status planning, which is primarily undertaken by administrators and politicians, corpus planning generally is performed by individuals with greater linguistic expertise.&lt;ref name=FergusonG /&gt; There are three traditionally recognized types of corpus planning: graphization, standardization, and modernization.

====Graphization====
Graphization refers to development, selection and modification of [[writing system|scripts]] and orthographic conventions for a language.&lt;ref name=Liddicoat&gt;Liddicoat, Anthony J. (2005). "Corpus Planning: Syllabus and Materials Development," in Eli Hinkel, ''Handbook of Research in Second Language Teaching and Learning'', Routledge, pp 993-1012.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of writing in a speech community can have lasting sociocultural effects, which include easier transmission of material through generations, communication with larger numbers of people, and a standard against which varieties of spoken language are often compared.&lt;ref name=FergusonC&gt;Ferguson, Charles A. (1968). "Language Development", in Charles A. Ferguson, Thom Huebner (1996), ''Sociolinguistic Perspectives: papers on language in society, 1959-1994'', Oxford University Press US, pp 40-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist [[Charles A. Ferguson]] made two key observations about the results of adopting a writing system. First, the use of writing adds another variety of the language to the community's repertory. Although written language is often viewed as secondary to spoken language, the [[vocabulary]], [[grammar|grammatical structures]] and [[phonology|phonological structures]] of a language often adopt characteristics in the written form that are distinct from the spoken variety. Second, the use of writing often leads to a folk belief that the written language is the 'real' language, and speech is a corruption of it. Written language is viewed as more conservative, while the spoken variety is more susceptible to language change. Isolated relic areas of the spoken language may be less innovative than the written form, or the written language may have been based on a divergent variety of the spoken language.&lt;ref name=FergusonC /&gt;

In establishing a writing system for a language, corpus planners have the option of using an existing system or creating a new one. The [[Ainu people|Ainu]] of [[Japan]] chose to adopt the [[Japanese language]]'s [[katakana]] [[syllabary]] as the writing system for the [[Ainu language]]. Katakana is designed for a language with a basic CV [[syllable structure]], but Ainu contains many CVC syllables that cannot easily be adapted to this syllabary. As a result, Ainu uses a modified katakana system, in which syllable-final [[syllable coda|codas]] are [[consonants]] by a [[subscript]] version of a katakana symbol that begins with the desired consonant.&lt;ref name=Liddicoat /&gt;

An example on a created script includes the development of the [[Armenian alphabet|Armenian script]] in 405 AD by [[Saint Mesrob|St. Mesrop Mashtots]]. Though the script was modeled after the [[Greek alphabet]], the original script distinguished Armenian from the Greek and [[Syriac alphabet]]s of the neighboring peoples.&lt;ref name=Cooper /&gt; Similarly, in the early 19th century, [[Sequoyah]] (Cherokee) created an orthography for written [[Cherokee]] in the Southeast of the present-day United States. It uses some Latin characters but also introduces new ones.

====Standardization====
The process of Standardization often involves one variety of a language taking precedence over other social and regional [[dialect]]s of a language.&lt;ref name=Christian&gt;Christian, Donna (1988). "Language Planning: the view from linguistics", in Frederick J. Newmeyer, ''Language: the socio-cultural context'', Cambridge University Press, pp 193-211.&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach, where dialects are mutually intelligible, is to introduce a poly-phonemic written form that is intended to represent all dialects of a language adequately but with no standard spoken form. If one variety of a language is chosen, that variety comes to be understood as supra-dialectal and the 'best' form of the language.&lt;ref name=FergusonC /&gt;

The choice of which language takes precedence has important societal consequences, as it confers privilege upon speakers whose spoken and written dialect conforms closest to the chosen standard.&lt;ref name=Wiley&gt;Wiley, Terrance G. (2003). "Language Planning and Policy," in Sandra McKay, Nancy H. Horberger, ''Sociolinguistics and Language Teaching'', Cambridge University Press, pp 103-147.&lt;/ref&gt; The standard that is chosen as the norm is generally spoken by the most powerful social group within the society, and is imposed upon the less powerful groups as the form to emulate. This often reinforces the dominance of the powerful social group and makes the standard norm necessary for socioeconomic mobility.&lt;ref name=FergusonG /&gt; In practice, standardization generally entails increasing the uniformity of the norm, as well as the [[Codification (linguistics)|codification]] of the norm.&lt;ref name=FergusonC /&gt;

The history of English provides an example of standardization occurring over an extended time period, without formally recognized language planning. The standardization process began when [[William Caxton]] introduced the [[printing press]] in [[England]] in 1476. This was accompanied by the adoption of the south-east [[English Midlands|Midlands]] variety of English, spoken in [[London]], as the print language. Because of the dialect's use for administrative, government, business, and literary purposes, this variety became entrenched as the prestigious variety of English. After the creation of [[grammar]]s and [[dictionaries]] in the 18th century, the rise of print [[Capitalism#As a mode of production|capitalism]], [[industrialization]], [[urbanization]], and [[mass education]] led to the dissemination of this dialect as the standard norm for the English language.

====Modernization====
Modernization is a form of language planning that occurs when a language needs to expand its resources to meet functions. Modernization often occurs when a language undergoes a shift in status, such as when a [[country]] gains [[independence]] from a [[colonialism|colonial power]] or when there is a change in the language [[education policy]].&lt;ref name=Christian /&gt; The most significant force in modernization is the expansion of the [[lexicon]], which allows the language to discuss topics in modern [[semantic domain]]s. Language planners generally focus on creating new lists and [[glossary|glossaries]] to describe new technical terms, but it is also necessary to ensure that the new terms are consistently used by the appropriate sectors within society. While some languages, such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], have experienced rapid lexical expansion to meet the demands of modernization, other languages, such as [[Standard Hindi|Hindi]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], have failed to do so.&lt;ref name=FergusonC /&gt; Rapid lexical expansion is aided by the use of new terms in textbooks and professional publications, as well as frequent use among specialists. Issues of [[linguistic purism]] often play a significant role in lexical expansion, but technical vocabulary can be effective within a language, regardless of whether it comes from the language's own process of [[word formation]] or from extensive [[loanword|borrowing]] from another language.&lt;ref name=FergusonC/&gt; While Hungarian has almost exclusively used language-internal processes to create new lexical items, Japanese has borrowed extensively from English to derive new words as part of its modernization.

=== Acquisition planning ===
Acquisition planning is a type of language planning in which a national, state or local government system aims to influence aspects of language, such as language status, distribution and literacy through education. Acquisition planning can also be used by non-governmental organizations, but it is more commonly associated with government planning.&lt;ref&gt;Liddicoat, Anthony J., and Richard B. Baldauf, Jr., "Language Planning in Local Contexts: Agents, Contexts and Interactions." ''Language Planning in Local Contexts''. Ed. Anthony J. Liddicoat and Richard B. Baldauf, Jr. Clevedon: Multilingual Matters Ltd., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequently, acquisition planning is integrated into a larger language planning process in which the statuses of languages are evaluated, corpuses are revised and the changes are finally introduced to society on a national, state or local level through education systems, ranging from primary schools to universities.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Charles A. "Sociolinguistic Settings of Language Planning." ''Language Planning Processes''. Ed. Rubin, Joan, Björn H. Jernudd, Jyotirindra Das Gupta, Joshua A. Fishman and Charles A. Ferguson. The Hague: Mouton Publishers, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; This process of change can entail a variety of modifications, such as an alteration in student textbook formatting, a change in methods of teaching an official language or the development of a [[multilingualism|bilingual]] language program, only to name a few. For example, if a government decides to raise the status level of a certain language or change its level of prestige, it can establish a law that requires teachers to teach only in this language or that textbooks are written using only this language's script. This, in turn, would support the elevation of the language's status or could increase its prestige. In this way, acquisition planning is often used to promote [[language revitalization]], which can change a language's status or reverse a [[language shift]], or to promote linguistic purism.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Charles A. "Language Planning Processes"''Language Planning Processes''. Ed. Rubin, Joan, Björn H. Jernudd, Jyotirindra Das Gupta, Joshua A. Fishman and Charles A. Ferguson. The Hague: Mouton Publishers, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; In a case where a government revises a corpus, new dictionaries and educational materials will need to be revised in schools in order to maintain effective language acquisition.

====The education sector====
The education [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]] or education sector of government is typically in charge of making national [[language acquisition]] decisions based on state and local evaluation reports. The responsibilities of education sectors vary by country; [[Robert B. Kaplan]] and Richard B. Baldauf describe the sectors' six principal goals:&lt;ref name= Kaplan /&gt;

# To decide what languages should be taught within the [[curriculum]].
# To determine the amount and quality of [[teacher training]].
# To involve local [[communities]].
# To determine what materials will be used and how they will be incorporated into [[syllabi]].
# To establish a local and state [[Educational assessment|assessment]] system to monitor progress.
# To determine financial [[cost]]s.

====Problems====
Although acquisition planning can be useful to governments, there are several problems that must be considered.&lt;ref name= Thorburn&gt;Thorburn, Thomas. "Cost-Benefit Analysis in Language Planning." ''Can Language Be Planned?'' Ed. Rubin, Joan, and Björn H. Jernudd. Hawaii: The University Press of Hawaii, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Even with a solid evaluation and assessment system, the effects of planning methods can never be certain; governments must consider the effects on other aspects of state planning, such as economic and political planning. Some proposed acquisition changes could also be too drastic or instituted too suddenly without proper planning and organization. Acquisition planning can also be financially draining, so adequate planning and awareness of financial resources is essential. It is important therefore that government goals, such as those described above, be organized and planned carefully.&lt;ref name= Thorburn /&gt;

====Multilingualism====
There is also a growing concern over the treatment of [[multilingualism]] in education, especially in many countries that were once colonized.&lt;ref&gt;Mansor, Sabiha. ''Language Planning in Higher Education''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Deciding on which language of instruction would be most beneficial to effective communication on the local and state level is a task requiring thoughtful planning and is surrounded by debate. Some states prefer instruction only in the official language, but some aim to foster linguistic and thus social diversity by encouraging teaching in several [[first language|(native) languages]]. One reason some states prefer a single language of instruction is that it supports national unity and homogeneity.&lt;ref name= Fishman&gt;Fishman, Joshua A. "The Impact of Nationalism on Language Planning," ''Can Language Be Planned?'' Ed. Rubin, Joan, and Björn H. Jernudd. Hawaii: The University Press of Hawaii, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Some states prefer incorporating different languages in order to help students learn better by giving them diverse perspectives.

====Non-governmental organizations====
In addition to the education sector, there are non-governmental sectors or organizations that have a significant effect on language acquisition, such as the [[Académie française]] of France or the [[Real Academia Española]] of Spain.&lt;ref name= Kaplan /&gt; These organizations often create their own dictionaries and grammar books, thus affecting the materials which students are exposed to in schools. Although these organizations do not hold official power, they influence government planning decisions, such as with educational materials, affecting acquisition.&lt;ref name= Kaplan /&gt;

====Ireland====
Before the partition of [[Ireland]], a movement began which aimed at the restoration of [[Irish language|Irish]], as the nation's primary language, based on a widespread sentiment for Irish nationalism and cultural identity.&lt;ref name= Macnamara&gt;Macnamara, John. "Successes and Failures in the Movement for the Restoration of Irish," ''Can Language Be Planned?'' Ed. Rubin, Joan, and Björn H. Jernudd. Hawaii: The University Press of Hawaii, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; During and after colonisation, Irish had competed with English and [[Scots language|Scots]];  the movement to restore the language gained momentum after the [[Irish War of Independence]]. The [[Conradh na Gaeilge|Gaelic League]] was created to promote the acquisition of Irish in schools, thus "de-Anglicizing" Ireland.&lt;ref name= Macnamara /&gt; Immediately after Ireland gained independence in 1922, the League declared that Irish must be the language of instruction for at least one hour in primary schools nationwide. Irish-speaking teachers were recruited, and preparatory colleges were established to train new ones.

The program implementation was mostly left to the individual schools, which did not consistently carry it out. Additionally, educating a generation is a long process, for which the League was not prepared. There was no consensus as to how the Irish language should be reinstituted; the League and schools did not develop a system assessment plan to monitor progress. As a result, the movement lost strength, and the number of native Irish speakers has been in steady decline.&lt;ref&gt;Mac Giolla Chriost, Diarmait. "Micro-level Language Planning in Ireland."

== Case study: Quechua in Peru ==

=== Status planning ===
[[Peru]]'s history of language planning begins in the 16th century with Spanish [[colonization]].  When the Spanish first arrived in Peru, [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] served as a language of wider communication, a lingua franca, between Spaniards and Peruvian natives. As the years passed, Spaniards asserted the superiority of the Spanish language; as a result, Spanish gained prestige, taking over as a language of wider communication and the dominant language of Peru.&lt;ref name= CoronelM&gt;Coronel-Molina, Serafin M. "Functional Domains of the Quechua Language in Peru: Issues of Status Planning." University of Pennsylvania&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1975, under the leadership of President [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]], the revolutionary government of Peru declared Quechua an official language of the Peruvian state, "coequal with Spanish."&lt;ref name=Hornberger2&gt;Hornberger, Nancy and Kendell A. King. "Authenticity and Unification in Quechua Language Planning." University of Pennsylvania: 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, the law was reversed.&lt;ref name=CoronelM /&gt; Peru's 1979 [[constitution]] declares Spanish the only official language of the state; Quechua and Aymara are relegated to "official use zones," equivalent to Stewart's provincial function described above. Quechua has officially remained a provincial language since 1979.  Today, Quechua also serves a limited international function throughout [[South America]] in [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], and [[Ecuador]]; communities of Quechua speakers outside Peru enable communication in Quechua across borders. Still, because of Quechua's low status, Spanish is almost always used as the lingua franca instead. Recently, Quechua has also gained ground in the academic world, both as a school subject and a topic of literary interest.

=== Corpus planning ===
The three main types of corpus planning are all evident in the development of Quechua languages in Peru since the colonial era. Graphization has been in process since the arrival of the Spanish in the region, when the Spanish imperialists attempted to describe the exotic sounds of the language to Europeans.&lt;ref name= Coronel&gt;Coronel-Molina, Serafin M. (1996). "Corpus Planning for the Southern Peruvian Quechua Language." ''Working Papers in Educational Linguistics,'' 12 (2), pp 1-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Quechua was made an official language in Peru in 1975, the introduction of the language into the education and government domains made it essential to have a standard written language.&lt;ref name= Coronel /&gt;  The task of adopting a writing system proved to be a point of contention among Peruvian linguists. Although most agreed to use the [[Latin alphabet]], linguists disagreed about how to represent the phonological system of Quechua, particularly in regards to the vowel system. Representatives from the [[Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua|Peruvian Academy of the Quechua language]] and the [[SIL International|Summer Institute of Linguistics]] wanted to represent [[allophone]]s of the [[vowel]]s /i/ and /u/ with separate letters &lt;e&gt; and &lt;o&gt;, which creates an apparent five-vowel system. They argued that this makes the language easier to learn for people who are already familiar with written Spanish. However, other Peruvian linguists argued that a three-vowel system was more faithful to the [[phonology]] of Quechua. After several years of debate and disagreement, in 1985 Peruvian linguists proposed the Pan-Quechua alphabet as an accurate representation of the language, and this was adopted in [[intercultural bilingual education]] programs and textbooks. However, the Peruvian Academy and the SIL both refused to adopt it and continued to propose new alphabets, leaving the issue unsettled.&lt;ref name= Coronel /&gt; For more information, see [[Quechua languages#Writing system|Quechua writing system]] and [[Quechuan and Aymaran spelling shift]]. Another of the primary issues disagreements was about how to reflect the phonological differences apparent in different dialects of Quechua. For example, some distinct dialects utilize [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] and [[glottalization|glottalized]] versions of the [[voiceless uvular plosive|voiceless uvular stop /q/]], while others do not and some language planners found it important to reflect these dialectal differences.&lt;ref name= Coronel /&gt;

The search for a unified alphabet reflects the process of standardization. Unlike other cases of standardization, in Quechua this has been applied only to the written language, not to the spoken language, and no attempt was made to change the spoken language of native speakers, which varied by regions. Rather, standardization was required in order to create a uniform writing system to provide education to Quechua speakers in their native language.

Language planners in Peru have proposed several varieties to serve as the supradialectal spoken norm. Some saw [[Qusqu-Qullaw]] as the natural choice for a standard norm, as it is recognized to be the variety closest to that spoken by the Incas. Others argued that [[Ayacucho Quechua]] is a better option, as the language is more conservative and similar to the proto-language, while Qusqu-Qullaw has been influenced by contact with the [[Aymara language]].

[[Rodolfo Cerrón-Palomino]] proposed a standard literary norm, [[Southern Quechua]] that combines features of both these dialects. This norm has been accepted by many institutions in Peru.&lt;ref name= Coronel /&gt;

Lexical modernization has also been critical to the development of Quechua. Language planners have attempted to create new Quechua words primarily through Quechua morphemes, which are combined in new ways to give new meanings. In general, loanwords from other languages are considered only when there are no possibilities to develop the word through existing Quechua structures. If loanwords are adopted into the language, linguists attempt to phonologically adapt the word to match typical Quechua pronunciation norms.&lt;ref name= Coronel /&gt;

=== Acquisition planning ===
Since Quechua is no longer an official language of Peru, Quechua literacy is not consistently encouraged in schools.&lt;ref name= Hornberger3&gt;Hornberger, Nancy "Quechua Literacy and Empowerment." ''Indigenous Literacies in the Americas'' Ed. Hornberger, Nancy. New York: Mouton de Gruyter, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Peru's education system is instead primarily based on Spanish, the nation's official language. Despite its low prestige, Quechua is still spoken by millions of indigenous Peruvians, a large portion of whom are bilingual in Quechua and Spanish. There is a desire to preserve the uniqueness of Quechua as a language with its own attributes and representations of culture. Some argue that promoting a diverse literacy program gives students diverse perspectives on life, which could only enhance their educational experience.&lt;ref name= Hornberger3 /&gt; Before 1975, Peru had bilingual education programs, but Quechua was not taught as a subject in primary and secondary schools.  After the 1975 education reform, Quechua and Spanish both had standing in bilingual programs, but only in restricted speech communities. These experimental programs were then canceled due to a change in government planning, but again reinstated in 1996. Even with national [[intercultural bilingual education]] programs, teachers at local schools and members of the community often prefer using Spanish, destabilizing support for bilingual education.&lt;ref name= CoronelM /&gt; This underscores the importance of community support as a goal for the education sector as mentioned earlier. Some believe that due to Spanish's higher national prestige, it is more socially and economically beneficial to learn and speak Spanish. It is debatable whether these education programs will benefit education or raise the status of Quechua.&lt;ref name= CoronelM /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6001">'''Lemon socialism''' is a pejorative term for a form of [[Nationalization|government intervention]] in which government [[subsidies]] go to weak or failing firms (''lemons''; see [[Lemon law]]), with the effective result that the government (and thus the taxpayer) absorbs part or all of the recipient's losses. The term derives from the conception that in socialism the government may nationalize a company's profits while leaving the company to pay its own losses, while in lemon socialism the company is allowed to keep its profits but its losses are shifted to the taxpayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Krugman |first1=Paul |title=The Geithner put |url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/30/the-geithner-put/ |accessdate=27 October 2018 |agency=New York Times |date=30 January 2009}} (Defining lemon socialism as "socialized losses, privatized profits.")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rithotz |first1=Barry |title=Greeks Stand Up to 'Lemon Socialism' |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2015-07-06/greeks-stand-up-to-lemon-socialism- |accessdate=27 October 2018 |publisher=Bloomberg |date=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
[[Mark J.

The sentiment was earlier expressed in the adage "[[Socialism for the rich and capitalism for the poor]]", which was in use by the 1960s, though the notion of privatizing profits and socializing losses dates at least to 1834 and [[Andrew Jackson]]'s closing of the [[Second Bank of the United States]].

In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], lemon socialism is known as "[[:is:Sósíalismi andskotans|Sósíalismi andskotans]]", meaning "the devil's socialism", a term coined by [[Vilmundur Jónsson]] (1889–1971, Iceland's Surgeon General) in the 1930s to criticize alleged [[crony capitalism]] in [[Landsbanki]], which term has gained renewed currency in the debate over the [[2008–2012 Icelandic financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.hi.is/~gylfason/Oslo%20financial%20crisis%202009.ppt |title=Icelandic banks 2008 in context|author=[http://www3.hi.is/~gylfason/inenglish.htm Thorvaldur Gylfason], grandson of Vilmundur Jónsson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lemon socialism, or more precisely crony capitalism, is also referred to as [[:is:Pilsfaldakapítalismi|Pilsfaldakapítalismi]], meaning "skirt capitalism", ''pilsfaldur'' being the hemline of the skirt; and the term referring to children hiding behind their mothers' skirts after having done something wrong to criticize the alleged lack of transparency in dealings and reluctance to deal with bad consequences by themselves.

{{More footnotes|date=September 2017}}

'''Lexicography''' is divided into two separate but equally important groups:

* '''Practical lexicography''' is the art or [[craft]] of compiling, writing and editing [[dictionary|dictionaries]].
* '''Theoretical lexicography''' is the [[academic disciplines|scholarly discipline]] of analyzing and describing the [[semantic]], [[syntagma (linguistics)|syntagmatic]] and [[paradigm]]atic relationships within the [[lexicon]] (vocabulary) of a [[language]], developing theories of dictionary components and structures linking the data in dictionaries, the needs for information by users in specific types of situations, and how users may best access the data incorporated in printed and electronic dictionaries. This is sometimes referred to as 'metalexicography'.

There is some disagreement on the definition of [[lexicology]], as distinct from lexicography. Some use "lexicology" as a synonym for theoretical lexicography; others use it to mean a branch of [[linguistics]] pertaining to the inventory of words in a particular language.

A person devoted to lexicography is called a '''lexicographer'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prospects.ac.uk/job-profiles/lexicographer|title=Lexicographer job profile {{!}} Prospects.ac.uk|website=www.prospects.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Focus ==
General lexicography focuses on the design, compilation, use and evaluation of general dictionaries, i.e. dictionaries that provide a description of the language in general use. Such a dictionary is usually called a general dictionary or LGP dictionary (Language for General Purpose). Specialized lexicography focuses on the design, compilation, use and evaluation of specialized dictionaries, i.e. dictionaries that are devoted to a (relatively restricted) set of linguistic and factual elements of one or more specialist subject fields, e.g. [[legal lexicography]]. Such a dictionary is usually called a [[specialized dictionary]] or [[Language for specific purposes dictionary]] and following Nielsen 1994, specialized dictionaries are either multi-field, single-field or sub-field dictionaries.

It is now widely accepted that lexicography is a scholarly discipline in its own right and not a sub-branch of [[applied linguistics]], as the chief object of study in lexicography is the dictionary (see e.g. Bergenholtz/Nielsen/Tarp 2009).

==Etymology==

Coined in English 1680, the word "lexicography" derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] λεξικογράφος ''lexikographos'', "lexicographer",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlecikogra%2Ffos λεξικογράφος],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; from λεξικόν ''lexicon'', neut. of λεξικός ''lexikos'', "of or for words",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlecikos λεξικός],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; from λέξις ''lexis'', "speech", "word",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dle%2Fcis λέξις], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; (in turn from λέγω ''lego'', "to say", "to speak"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dle%2Fgw3 λέγω],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''An Intermediate Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;) and γράφω ''grapho'', "to scratch, to inscribe, to write".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dgra%2Ffw γράφω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects==
Practical lexicographic work involves several activities, and the compilation of well-crafted dictionaries requires careful consideration of all or some of the following aspects:
* profiling the intended users (i.e. linguistic and non-linguistic competences) and identifying their needs
* defining the communicative and cognitive functions of the dictionary
* selecting and organizing the components of the dictionary
* choosing the appropriate structures for presenting the data in the dictionary (i.e. frame structure, distribution structure, macro-structure, micro-structure and [[cross-reference]] structure)
* selecting words and affixes for systematization as entries
* selecting [[collocation]]s, phrases and examples
* choosing [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]] forms for each word or part of word to be lemmatized
* defining words
* organizing definitions
* specifying pronunciations of words
* labeling definitions and pronunciations for [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] and dialect, where appropriate
* selecting equivalents in bi- and multi-lingual dictionaries
* translating collocations, phrases and examples in bi- and multilingual dictionaries
* designing the best way in which users can access the data in printed and electronic dictionaries

One important goal of lexicography is to keep the [[lexicographic information cost]]s incurred by dictionary users as low as possible. Nielsen (2008) suggests relevant aspects for lexicographers to consider when making dictionaries as they all affect the users' impression and actual use of specific dictionaries.

Theoretical lexicography concerns the same aspects as lexicography, but aims to develop principles that can improve the quality of future dictionaries, for instance in terms of access to data and lexicographic information costs. Several perspectives or branches of such academic dictionary research have been distinguished: 'dictionary criticism' (or evaluating the quality of one or more dictionaries, e.g. by means of reviews (see Nielsen 1999)), 'dictionary history' (or tracing the traditions of a type of dictionary or of lexicography in a particular country or language), 'dictionary typology' (or classifying the various genres of reference works, such as dictionary versus encyclopedia, monolingual versus bilingual dictionary, general versus technical or pedagogical dictionary), 'dictionary structure' (or formatting the various ways in which the information is presented in a dictionary), 'dictionary use' (or observing the reference acts and skills of dictionary users), and 'dictionary IT' (or applying [[Dictionary writing system|computer aids]] to the process of dictionary compilation).

One important consideration is the status of 'bilingual lexicography', or the compilation and use of the [[bilingual dictionary]] in all its aspects (see e.g. Nielsen 1894). In spite of a relatively long history of this type of dictionary, it is often said{{according to whom|date=September 2015}} to be less developed in a number of respects than its unilingual counterpart, especially in cases where one of the languages involved is not a major language. Not all genres of reference works are available in interlingual versions, e.g. LSP, learners' and encyclopedic types, although sometimes these challenges produce new subtypes, e.g. 'semi-bilingual' or 'bilingualised' dictionaries such as Hornby's ''(Oxford) Advanced Learner's Dictionary English-Chinese'', which have been developed by translating existing monolingual dictionaries (see Marello 1998).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21179">This is a '''List of Native American languages acquired by children''', thus this list contains the most healthy [[Native American languages]] within the confines of the [[United States]]. Still, only two can boast more than 20,000 speakers (Navajo and Cherokee).

*'''[[Arapaho language|Arapaho]]''' - In 2008, it was reported that a school had been opened to teach the language to children.{{sfn|Frosch|2008}} Currently, the language may be acquired by children, for a population estimate as recent as 2007 lists an increase to 1,000 speakers and notes that the language is in use in schools, bilingual education efforts begun on Wind River Reservation in the 1980s and the Arapaho Language Lodge, a successful immersion program, was established in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/arp|title=Arapaho|work=Ethnologue}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Arapaho Project" is an effort made by the Arapaho people to promote and restore their traditional language and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/UCB/AcademicAffairs/ArtsSciences/linguistics/csilw/newarapproj2.htm|title=The Arapaho Project|work=colorado.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have accomplished: "Curriculum development, teaching materials and teacher training for a total immersion program for children, beginning when they are preschoolers, that enables them to learn Cherokee as their first language.  The participating children and their parents learn to speak and read together.

Western Carolina University (WCU) has partnered with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (EBCI) to promote and restore the language through the school's Cherokee Studies program, which offers classes in and about the language and culture of the Cherokee Indians.&lt;ref name="wcu.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cherokee Language Revitalization Project|work = Western Carolina University|accessdate = April 9, 2014|year = 2014|url = http://www.wcu.edu/academics/departments-schools-colleges/cas/casdepts/anthsoc/cherokee-studies/cherokeelanguagerevitalizationproject.asp|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140407084751/http://www.wcu.edu/academics/departments-schools-colleges/cas/casdepts/anthsoc/cherokee-studies/cherokeelanguagerevitalizationproject.asp|archivedate = April 7, 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; WCU and the EBCI have initiated a ten-year language revitalization plan, constituting of: (1) a continuation of the improvement and expansion of the EBCI Atse Kituwah Cherokee Language Immersion School, (2) continued development of Cherokee language learning resources, and (3) building of Western Carolina University programs to offer a more comprehensive language training curriculum.&lt;ref name="wcu.edu"/&gt;
*'''[[Chickasaw language|Chickasaw]]''' - There were purportedly children learning Chickasaw as a first language in 2006, though this is perhaps not the case.&lt;ref name="ahalenia.com"&gt;Anderton, Alice, PhD. [http://www.ahalenia.com/iws/status.html Status of Indian Languages in Oklahoma.] ''Intertribal Wordpath Society''. 2009. Retrieved March 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Crow language|Crow]]''' -   R. Graczyk claims in his ''A Grammar of Crow'' (2007) that "[u]nlike many other native languages of North America in general, and the northern plain in particular, the Crow language still exhibits considerable vitality: there are fluent speakers of all ages, and at least some children are still acquiring Crow as their first language."  Many of the younger population who do not speak Crow are able to understand it. Almost all of those who do speak Crow are also bilingual in English.&lt;ref&gt;Graczyk, 2007: 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Graczyk cites the reservation community as the reason for both the high level of bilingual Crow-English speakers and the continued use and prevalence of the Crow language. Daily contact with non-American Indians on the reservation for over one hundred years has led to high usage of English. Traditional culture within the community, however, has preserved the language via religious ceremonies and the traditional clan system. Currently, most speakers of Crow are 30 and older but a few younger speakers are learning it. There are increased efforts for children to learn Crow as their first language and many do on the [[Crow Indian Reservation|Crow Reservation]] of [[Montana]], particularly through a Crow language immersion school that was sponsored in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Crow Tribe gets language immersion grant|url = http://billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/montana/crow-tribe-gets-language-immersion-grant/article_3730b364-b6f8-5d84-ac7f-ad9267888569.html|accessdate = 2015-08-16|first = Susan|last = Olp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development for the language includes a Crow language dictionary and portions of the [[Bible]] published from 1980-2007.

*'''[[Tohono O'odham language|Tohono O'odham]]''' - In 2000 there were estimated to be approximately 9,750 speakers in the United States and Mexico combined, although there may be more due to under-reporting. It is the 10th most-spoken indigenous language in the United States, the 3rd most-spoken indigenous language in Arizona after Apache and Navajo. It is the 3rd most-spoken language in Pinal County and the 4th most-spoken language in Pima County. Approximately 8% of O'odham speakers in the US speak English "not well" or "not at all", according to results of the 2000 Census. Approximately 13% of O'odham speakers in the US were between the ages of 5 and 17, and among the younger O'odham speakers, approximately 4% were reported as speaking English "not well" or "not at all".
*'''[[Zuni language|Zuni]]''' - Unlike most indigenous languages in the US, Zuni is still spoken by a significant number of children and, thus, is comparatively less threatened with [[language endangerment]]. Edmund Ladd reported in 1994 that Zuni is still the main language of communication in the pueblo and is used in the home (Newman 1996).

[[File:Min Er Quan Bronze Square Lei, Shang dynasty, Hunan Museum, picture2.jpg|thumb|Min ''fanglei'']]
The '''Min''' '''''fanglei''''' ({{zh|c=皿方罍 |p=Mĭn fāngléi}}) is an ancient Chinese bronze [[Chinese ritual bronzes|''lei'' vessel]] from the late [[Shang dynasty]] or early [[Western Zhou]] dynasty (12th – 11th century BC). It is one of the largest of its kind, and called the "King of Fanglei". After its accidental discovery in 1919 in [[Hunan]], its lid remained in China but the body was sold to collectors overseas, and set a world-record auction price for an Asian art work in 2001 when it fetched US$9.24 million. In 2014, a group of Chinese collectors bought it for a price between US$20 and 30 million, and donated it to the [[Hunan Museum]], where it was reunited with its lid.

==Description==
[[File:Min fanglei inscription.jpg|thumb|upright|The inscription inside the lid reads: 皿而[or 天]全作父己尊彝 (Min Er [or Tian] Quan made [this] esteemed vessel for Father Ji).]]
The Min ''fanglei'' is dated to the late [[Shang dynasty]] or early [[Western Zhou]] dynasty (12th – 11th century BC).&lt;ref name="artnet" /&gt; It is a ''fanglei'', or square or rectangular ''lei,'' a type of ancient [[Chinese ritual bronze]] vessel. The Min ''fanglei'' is {{convert|88|cm|abbr=on}} tall, and its mouth measures {{convert|26.1|x|21.6|cm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="tiger" /&gt; Without the lid, it is 64 cm (25 inches) tall and weighs 42 kg (92.5 pounds). It is finely decorated on each of its four sides, with pairs of dragons cast on its shoulders and a horned dragon mask on its handle. Because of its size and workmanship, it is called the "King of Fanglei".&lt;ref name="MeyerBrysac2015"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=84t-BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA186|title=The China Collectors: America's Century-Long Hunt for Asian Art Treasures|last1=Meyer|first1=Karl E.|last2=Brysac|first2=Shareen Blair|date=10 March 2015|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-1-4668-7929-4|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''fanglei'' is named for the [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|bronze inscription]] inside its body, which reads "''Min zuo Fu Ji zun yi''" ({{zh|c=皿作父己尊彝|p=|links=no|s=|t=}}), or "Min made [this] esteemed vessel for Father Ji". On the inside of its lid, the inscription has two extra characters: "''Min Er [or Tian] Quan zuo Fu Ji zun yi''" (皿而[or 天]全作父己尊彝), or "Min Er [or Tian] Quan made [this] esteemed vessel for Father Ji".&lt;ref name="tiger" /&gt;

==Modern history==
The Min ''fanglei'' was accidentally discovered in 1919 in Maoshanyu, Shuitian Township (now Jiaqiao Town), [[Taoyuan County]], [[Hunan]] Province. According to local records, a boy named Ai Xinzhai ({{zh|s=艾心斋|p=|labels=no}}) found the vessel lying partly exposed on a mountain slope and told his father Ai Qingyan ({{zh|s=艾清宴|p=|labels=no}}), who then dug it out.&lt;ref name="tiger" &gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.hnmuseum.com/zh-hans/node/184 |script-title=zh:“皿而全”铜方罍  |newspaper=Hunan Museum |date=2017 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, Shi Yuzhang ({{zh|s=石瑜璋|p=|labels=no}}) bought the body of the vessel for a substantial sum. Ai Qingyan kept the lid, which he gave to his son's school, Xinmin School ({{zh|s=新民学校|p=|labels=no}}), in lieu of tuition. The staff of the school read the inscription inside the lid and recognized its significance.&lt;ref name="tiger" /&gt; After the ''[[Ta Kung Pao]]'' in [[Changsha]] reported the discovery of the artifact on June 11, 1925, [[Zhang Shizhao]], the provincial education director, attempted to retrieve the vessel but was unable to locate it.&lt;ref name="tiger" /&gt; 

Zhou Pan ({{zh|s=周磐|p=|labels=no}}), a local military officer, purchased the lid for 3,000 silver dollars.&lt;ref name="tiger" /&gt; When Zhou was arrested in [[Kunming]], [[Yunnan]] in 1950, the lid was confiscated and given to the Hunan Cultural Relics Management Committee, which was merged into [[Hunan Museum]] in 1956.&lt;ref name="tiger" /&gt;

In 1928, French scholar [[George Soulié de Morant]] published ''A History of Chinese Art'', which included a photograph of the Min ''fanglei'' (without the lid) and noted that it had been collected by prominent art dealers including [[C. T. Loo]], A. W. Bahr, and C. F. Yau (姚叔来).&lt;ref name="tiger" /&gt;

The vessel was bought by Japanese collector Umekichi Asano (浅野梅吉) in 1930, and then sold to Taiwanese-Japanese collector Munachi Nita (新田栋一; Chinese name Peng Kaidong 彭楷棟) in 1950. When Nita put it on auction with [[Christie's]] in 2001, [[Shanghai Museum]] and [[New Beijing Poly Plaza|Poly Museum]] raised a large sum to make a bid for the vessel, but were outbid by a French collector for US$9.24 million.&lt;ref name="tiger" /&gt; At the time it was a world-record price for an Asian artwork.&lt;ref name="artnet"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/market/chinese-collectors-secure-min-fanglei-at-christies-auction-cancelled-sale-price-exceeds-20-million-6389|title='Min' Fanglei Sale Price Exceeds $20 million|last=Kinsella|first=Eileen|date=2014-03-19|work=Artnet News|access-date=2018-02-23|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the Min ''fanglei'' was again put on auction by Christie's. On March 19, a day before the auction was scheduled to take place, Christie's announced that the owner had agreed to sell the vessel to a group of private Chinese collectors, who then donated it to Hunan Museum to be reunited with its lid, from which it had been separated for 90 years. Christie's did not disclose the sale price, but [[Sina News]] reported it to be US$20 million,&lt;ref name="artnet" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/t/20140322/033718582080.shtml |script-title=zh:皿天全方罍洽购成功 重量级国宝回家  |work=Sina |date=2014-03-22 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another estimate gave $30 million.&lt;ref name="MeyerBrysac2015" /&gt;

On January 14, 2018, the Min ''fanglei'' was featured on the Chinese TV program ''[[National Treasure (TV program)|National Treasure]]''.&lt;ref name="fish" &gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.hn.chinanews.com/news/2018/0212/327491.html |script-title=zh:见证华夏民族复兴转折 湘博皿方罍入选《国家宝藏》特展 |newspaper=China News |date=2018-02-12 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Monacopolis: Architecture, Urban Planning and Urbanisation in Monaco: Projects and Constructions, 1858-2012'',  NMNM 2013, Monaco, p13, p629, p632-639&lt;/ref&gt; Originally seen as symbols of ''[[Belle Époque|Belle Epoque]]'' luxury, they were once emblematic of the principality itself. However, by the 1950s they were viewed by Monaco's Consultative Committee on Public Works as a social anachronism.&lt;ref name="Monacopolis" /&gt; While recent years have seen a renewed appreciation within the principality for villa architecture,&lt;ref name="Monacopolis" /&gt; the number of historic villas remaining declines each year. In 1954 the principality possessed 688 villas;&lt;ref&gt;Laplace, Pierre ''Villas Les Anciennes et leurs Hôtes à Monaco'', Editions V. Gadoury, Monaco, 2015, p1&lt;/ref&gt; only a small fraction of that number still survive.

==Heritage and its recognition==
[[File:Monaco BW 2011-06-07 16-04-01.JPG|thumb|left|Villa Blanchy in Monaco-Ville]]
The urban history of Monaco and its villas has, until recently, been subject to poor documentation and archiving.&lt;ref name="Monacopolis" /&gt; As of 2016, Monaco still had no official preservation laws governing historic buildings.

In 1960 [[Rainier III, Prince of Monaco|Prince Rainier III]] established the Monaco Economic Development Corporation to attract new business to the Principality. It was successful in this, but the influx of new investors and workers resulted in a wave of demolitions of Belle Epoque villas to enable the construction of apartments and new hotels.&lt;ref&gt;Ring, Jim ''Riviera: The Rise and Rise of the Côte d'Azur'', Faber &amp; Faber, London 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Following major development in the 1970s, Prince Rainier III banned high rise development in the Principality. However his successor, [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco|Prince Albert II]], overturned the Sovereign Order.&lt;ref name="Fair"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.fr/actualites/france/articles/monaco-la-tour-odeon-un-chantier-malheureux/23582|title=La tour Odéon, l'histoire d'un chantier dont les malheurs ont atteint des sommets|last=Fair|first=Vanity|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, and a further influx of new residents, accelerated the destruction of the architectural heritage of single family villas for new luxury apartments.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;Lyall, Sarah; Baume, Maïa de la ''Development Blitz Provokes a Murmur of Dissent in Monaco'', New York Times,  11 December 2013; https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/12/world/europe/development-blitz-provokes-a-murmur-of-dissent-in-monaco.html&lt;/ref&gt; Demands for affordable public housing led to further villa demolitions. In 2013 an official publication documenting the urban history of the principality called it a place where "architecture is temporary".&lt;ref name="Monacopolis" /&gt;

In a nation where public dissent is rare, there was significant criticism of the destruction.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt; The 2013 demolition of the Art Deco [[Sporting d'Hiver]] ("Winter Sporting") Club building, and the rotunda of the [[Hôtel de Paris Monte-Carlo|Hôtel de Paris]] and its 1900 extensions, caused further dismay,&lt;ref name="Heritage"&gt;''Monaco's Heritage In Danger?'', L'Observateur de Monaco, No141, April 2015; http://www.lobservateurdemonaco.mc/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Obs141.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.monacowealthmanagement.com/articles/news/2013/20130719_opposition_against_demolition.php|title=Opposition mounts against Sporting d'Hiver demolition|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the establishment of protest group "Monaco Patrimoine", whose leader was quoted as saying: "Monaco is destroying, without scruples, villas from the Belle Epoque…Monaco is losing its identity", and it was termed "a genocide of memories".&lt;ref name="Heritage" /&gt;

In 2015 a major row broke out between the Government and the elected National Council over the demolition of the picturesque Belle Epoque-style 1931 apartment building Le Palais de la Plage&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.monacolife.net/?action=show&amp;id=4035|title=Monaco Life|website=www.monacolife.net|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; (37 [[Avenue Princesse Grace]] - originally Boulevard des Bas-Moulins), which originally sat on the beachfront,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.monacomatin.mc/article/culture-et-loisirs/monaco-1931-2008-devant-le-palais-de-la-plage-les-souvenirs.46286.html|title=Monaco 1931-2008 : devant le Palais de la plage... les souvenirs|website=archives.monacomatin.mc|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was replaced by an apartment building of the same name. The President of the Cultural and Heritage Mission of the National Council, Daniel Boeri, termed the demolition "brutal", and that Monegasque citizens were being treated by the Government as "children incapable of reason". While a heritage law and Heritage Institute was still in planning, he said: "That we are still at this point in 2015 is breathtaking... The example of the Palais de la Plage is a perfect illustration of its absolute necessity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.monacowealthmanagement.com/articles/news/2015/20150303-almighty-row-over-damned-villas.php|title=Almighty row over damned villas|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 it was revealed that Monaco state officials had, in a town planning document, identified 93 'remarkable' buildings and 29 'remarkable' facades worth preserving. However, these are to be re-evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The list also offered no guarantee of protection and was criticised for its major absences, including entire streets, and the Hotel de Paris, the Sporting d'Hiver, and the Hermitage.&lt;ref name="lobservateurdemonaco.mc"&gt;''Monaco's Heritage In Danger?'', L'Observateur de Monaco, No141, April 2015, pp60-67;http://www.lobservateurdemonaco.mc/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Obs141.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Nonferrous]] [[Archaeometallurgy]] in the Southern [[Levant]]''' refers to the archaeological study of non-Iron-related metal technology in the region of the [[Southern Levant]] during the [[Chalcolithic]] period and [[Bronze Age]] from approximately 4500BC to 1000BC.

==Chalcolithic Period==
The first known use of metals in the Southern Levant is during the [[Chalcolithic]] period (end of 5th–most of the 4th millennium BCE). More than 500 metal objects were found, mainly in hoards, burials, and habitation
remains. Most of the metals originate from sites in the southern part of [[Israel]] and [[Jordan]]; very rarely do they occur beyond the center of Israel and north of [[Nahal Qana|Nahal Qanah]]. The metal findings from this period were separated into three groups; most of them belong to the following first two groups:

'''Prestige/cult-elaborated and complex-shaped objects''' made of [[copper]] (Cu) alloyed (a deliberate
choice of complex minerals that could be reduced to a mixture of metals with specific recognizable
and desirable properties, totally different from unalloyed copper) with distinct amounts of [[antimony]]
(Sb) or [[nickel]] (Ni) and [[arsenic]] (As). They were cast using a [[lost-wax casting|“lost wax”]] technique &lt;ref name="Goren"&gt;Goren, Y. 2008. The location of specialized copper production
by the lost wax technique in the Chalcolithic southern
Levant. Journal of Geoarchaeology 23 (3): 374–397.&lt;/ref&gt; into single closed clay moulds and then polished into their final shining gray or gold-like colors depending on the amount of antimony or nickel and arsenic in the copper. The biggest hoard (416 metal objects comprising mainly artistically complex-shaped objects) was found hidden in a remote cave (the Cave of the Treasure) in [[Nahal Mishmar]], Judean Desert, Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Key, C.A. 1964. Ancient copper and copper-arsenic alloy
artifacts: composition and metallurgical implications. Science 146: 1578–1580.&lt;/ref&gt;

They were wrapped in a straw mat (e.g., Shalev;&lt;ref&gt;Shalev, S., Northover, J.P. 1993. The metallurgy of the Nahal Mishmar hoard reconsidered. Archaeometry 35(1): 35–47.&lt;/ref&gt; Tadmor&lt;ref&gt;Tadmor, M., Kedem, D., Begemann, F., Hauptmann, A., Pernicka, E., Schmitt-Strecker, S. 1995. The Nahal Mishmar
Hoard from the Judean Desert: technology, composition, and provenance. Atiqot XXVII: 95–148.&lt;/ref&gt;). Carbon-14 dating of the reed mat in which the objects were wrapped suggests that it dates to at least 3500 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/nahl/hd_nahl.htm The Nahal Mishmar Treasure] at [[Metropolitan Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the complex source material for the production of these objects is currently unknown. The nearest suitable ore is in [[South Caucasus|Trans-Caucasus]] and [[Azerbaijan]] — more than 1500&amp;nbsp;km from the finding sites of the objects. Several clay and stone cores and clay
mould remains were [[petrography|petrographically]] analyzed and the results &lt;ref name="Goren"/&gt; point to a possible local
production in the area of the Judean Desert, within the metals distribution zone in Israel, which is concentrated mainly in the southern part of the country: between Giv’at Oranit and Nahal Qana (east of
modern Tel Aviv) in the north and the Be’er Sheva valley sites in the south. Currently, no production
remains or production sites of these prestige/cult objects were found.

'''Unalloyed copper tools''' comprising mainly relatively thick- and short-bladed objects (axes, adzes,
and chisels) and points (awls and/or drills) made from a smelted copper ore, cast into an open mould and then hammered and [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealed]] into their final shape. The copper tools were produced in the Chalcolithic villages on the banks of the Be’er Sheva valley where slag fragments, clay crucibles, some possible furnace lining pieces, copper prills, and amorphous lumps were found, in addition to high-grade carbonated copper ore (cuprite). The ore was collected and selected in the area of Feinan in Trans-Jordan and transported to northern Negev villages some 150&amp;nbsp;km to the north, to be smelted for the local production of these copper objects.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, T.E., Shalev, S. 1989. Prehistoric metalworking in the Southern Levant: archaeometallurgical and social perspectives.

'''A third group of eight gold (Au) and [[electrum]] (Au + up to 30% Ag)''' solid rings was found in Nahal Qanah cave.&lt;ref&gt;Shalev, S. 1993b. The earliest gold artifacts in the southern
Levant: reconstruction of the manufacturing process. In: Eluere, C., ed. Outils et ateliers d’orfevres des temps anciens. Antiquites Nationales Memoire 2, Saint Germain en Laye. 9–12.&lt;/ref&gt;
This unique find, with no dated parallels, is attributed by the excavators to the Chalcolithic period based on local stratigraphic and geological evidence and 14C dating of ground samples from the vicinity of the finds in the cave. Surface analyses of these objects revealed a surface
gold enrichment caused by the depletion of silver and the copper traces. This effect could be caused naturally by deposition but could have been achieved intentionally at the time of production in
order to achieve a yellow color for the electrum rings rich in silver, as well. During the Chalcolithic
(copper and stone) era at least two, if not three distinct industries of different metals were operating
and their products were found in the Southern Levant.&lt;ref&gt;Shalev, S. 1996. Archaeometallurgy in Israel: the impact of the material on the choice of shape, size and colour

==Early Bronze Age==
During the next thousand years of the Early [[Bronze Age]] (end of 4th–end of 3rd millennium BCE) the same unalloyed copper production of the Chalcolithic (group 2, above) continued for the production of short blades and points. The same metal technique was used for the novel production of long blade weapons
(riveted daggers and knives, heavy tanged swords, and epsilon-shaped axes). The same copper production
technique of casting into an open mould and then hammering and annealing, was used to produce all other
metals as well, including jewelry of thin plates, sometimes decorated, and elongated thin wires (mainly for rings and bracelets) made of unalloyed copper as well as from silver (first appearance) and gold.

Archaeological remains of Early Bronze copper mining and copper smelting in the vicinity of the
mines were found in Trans-Jordan (Feinan), the Arava Valley ([[Timna Valley|Timnah]]), and southern [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]].&lt;ref name="Shalev1994"&gt;Shalev, S. 1994. The change in metal production from the Chalcolithic period to the Early Bronze Age in Israel and Jordan. Antiquity 68: 630–637.&lt;/ref&gt; The only production remains of metal are those of copper and include copper slag, prills, and amorphous copper lumps and small shallow ball-shaped clay crucibles with a socket. In the Early Bronze I site of the [[Ashkelon]] Marina,&lt;ref name="Godfrey"&gt;Godfrey-Smith, D.I., Shalev, S. 2002. Determination of usage and absolute chronology of a pit feature at the Ashkelon Marina, Israel, archaeological site. Geochronometria 21: 163–166.&lt;/ref&gt; in the southern part of the Israeli coast, small shallow open pits, probably for the melting of copper in a crucible, were found next to copper industrial remains. 

All pits showed a similar structure of a red soil burnt layer covered within by a white thin layer of [[calcite]]. No archaeological material was found associated with these man-made rudimentary remains. In the vicinity, and detached from the installations, scattered remains of pottery sherds, bone fragments, copper slag remains, and some pieces of clay crucibles were found. They were dated to Early Bronze Age I. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages of the fill of the pits and thermoluminescence (TL) ages of quartz grains extracted from the hardened red layer of the pits showed that the last burning activity was conducted during the same period: 5260 ± 380 years ago (OSL) and 5180 ± 380 years ago (TL).&lt;ref name="Godfrey"/&gt; 

Most of the metal products are found in burials, and are mainly from the Early Bronze I. The same types of metals continue in sites and tombs throughout the entire Early Bronze and all over the local distribution map of Early Bronze sites in Israel, from the Upper Galilee in the north to Ein Besor and Malhata in the northern Negev. A single hoard of copper objects probably from the Early Bronze I was found with no related archaeological context in the
fields of [[Kfar Monash]].&lt;ref&gt;Hestrin, R., Tadmor, M. 1963. A hoard of tools and weapons from Kfar Monash, Israel Exploration Journal 13: 265–288.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Early Bronze period the Southern Levant's metal industry became more specialized and organized in separated places for the different parts of production,&lt;ref name="Shalev1994"/&gt; and the products became more homogenous, as did the different materials and modes of production. For the first time in the Southern Levant's metal history, significant typological and technological affiliations to the growing metal industries in the two major imperial centers (Egypt and Mesopotamia) on both sides of the “[[Fertile Crescent]]” were visible. During all the Early Bronze Age there is no archaeometallurgical evidence for bronze production and no bronze objects were found during this period in the Southern Levant as opposed to unalloyed copper.

[[File:MBII ribbed dagger Rishon Le-Zion.png|thumb|left|A Middle Bronze Age Ribbed Dagger found in Rishon Le-zion, Israel]]

==Middle Bronze Age==
In the Middle Bronze (MB) Age (end of 3rd–middle of 2nd millennium BCE) hundreds of metal objects were
found. The development of more complex weapons (longer daggers, swords, complex battle axes, etc.) was
possible by alloying the copper with [[arsenic]] or with [[tin]]. All the MBII weapons that were analyzed were made of copper alloyed either with tin (14%–2% Sn) or with arsenic (4.3%–0.5% As), sometimes with a mixture of both usually in low concentrations. These changes in the metal properties of weapons are also reflected in the composition of small objects, like toggle pins that were probably made mainly from re-melting of scrap.&lt;ref&gt;Shalev, S. 2002. Metal artifacts. In: Kempinski, A., ed. Tel
Kabri—the 1986–1993 excavation seasons. Tel Aviv University, Institute of Archaeology, Monograph Series
20, Tel Aviv, pp. 307–318.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lead]] (Pb) started to play a greater role as a major alloy for thick casts of copper-based objects, mainly of battle axes &lt;ref&gt;Philip, G. 1989. Metal weapons of the Early and Middle Bronze age in Syria-Palestine. BAR Int. Series 526.&lt;/ref&gt; during this period. 

Although two definite major alloying compositions for the production of MBII copper-based artifacts, (1)copper with arsenic and (2) copper with tin, are detected, to date no visible connection of specific alloy with specific type of object or different periods has been seen: both alloys appear in similar objects and in burials dated to the beginning as well as to later parts of the ca. 400 years of the MBII age. Currently, there is no visible correlation between any specific alloying tradition and the spatial distribution of finds, as well. Similar objects made of arsenical coppers and of tin bronze were found in the same geographic region and identical objects with similar metal composition were found in distant areas like [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Upper Egypt]]. The difference in the overall alloying pattern curve in [[Jericho]] and in [[Tell El-Dab'a]] shown by Philip (1995)&lt;ref&gt;Philip, G. 1995. The same but different: a comparison of Middle Bronze Age metalwork from Jericho and Tall ad-Dab’a. In: Studies in the history and archaeology of Jordan V. pp. 523–530.&lt;/ref&gt; does not necessarily have to be related to two different production centers, but could as well be the result of comparing different groups of objects (i.e., more prestigious weapons of control alloying either with tin or with arsenic) at Tell El Dab’a and similar objects mixed with simpler copper-based ones (like simple daggers, knives, toggle pins, etc.) in Jericho &lt;ref&gt;Khalil, L. 1980. The composition and technology of ancient copper alloy artifacts from Jericho and related sites. Unpublished Ph.D. Thesis, Institute of Archaeology, London.&lt;/ref&gt; and/or types like the spearheads that have more mixed, low levels of both alloys.

Gesher—final report. Annual of the American School of Oriental Research, Vol. 62, Boston, pp. 109–114.
&lt;/ref&gt; does add knowledge concerning production modes. The thicker the object is, the more lead was
deliberately added to the cast. The highest amounts of lead were measured in the duckbill axes, less in the flat socketed axes, and much less in thinner blades like spears and daggers, which were much more worked and annealed after being cast. This observation corresponds well with the controlled alloying of the duckbill axes and ribbed daggers (with much less lead in the latter) from the MBIIa, but does not correspond with the spears. Although they are derived mainly from MBIIa contexts, their composition is less controlled and more varied. There might be a connection between the level of allowing control and the investment in the cast — the more complex types, like duckbill and flat socketed axes and ribbed daggers, are usually cast in steatite, two-piece closed and well-carved moulds.&lt;ref name="philip2006"/&gt;
On the other hand, some of the less controlled alloyed types, like spearheads and knives as well as more simple tools such as chisel points, were mainly cast into open, relatively roughly carved limestone moulds.

==Late Bronze Age==
Hundreds of metal artefacts were found from the Late Bronze Age (second half of 2nd millennium BCE): ca.
200 blade weapons, 140 metal vessels, some working tools, small arrowheads, and decorative objects. All
the blades analyzed &lt;ref name="shalev2004"&gt;Shalev, S. 2004. Swords and daggers in Late Bronze Age Canaan. Praehistorische Bronzefunde (PBF) Vol. IV, 13. Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur, Mainz.&lt;/ref&gt; were made of tin bronze and most of all the other copper-based objects are either tin bronze alloy or have tin in their metal as impurity.

At this stage, large quantities of copper and tin ingots (i.e., 10 tons of Cu and 3 tons of Sn ingots in one cargo of [[Uluburun]] shipwreck from the 14th century BCE) were found all over the coasts of the Mediterranean and in several shipwrecks under the sea, mainly off the southern coast of Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;Budd, P., Pollard, A.M., Scaife, B., Thomas, R.G. 1995.

Journal of Mediterranean Archaeology 8(1): 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt; In Canaan at that time, Cypriot, Egyptian, Syrian, and Mesopotamian types of bronze objects were found, besides the local Canaanite metal collection.&lt;ref name="shalev2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gershuny, L. 1985.

Axes and adzes from Canaan. Praehistorische Bronzefunde (PBF) Vol. IX, 19. Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur, Mainz.&lt;/ref&gt; These were all basically made of tin bronze. The “prestige” objects like sickle blade swords or cast-hilt daggers were alloyed with highquality (11–13% by weight) Sn, whereas the simpler and probably less expensive objects had lower levels of tin in the metal.

==Iron Age==
Copper and copper-based metals continued to be the major metal in use during the first part of the [[Iron Age]] (end of 2nd–beginning of 1st millennium BCE). Bronze scrap re-melting continued (mainly v-shaped clay crucibles, slags, clay tuyères) and structures of open campfires full of metal production remains were found in several sites in Israel associated mainly with the [[Philistines]] and the [[Sea People]] settlements on the northern Sharon coast between modern Tel Aviv and Haifa, e.g., [[Tel Qasile]], [[Tel Gerisa]], [[Tel Dor]], and [[Tel Dan]],&lt;ref&gt;Shalev, S. 1993a. Metal production and society at Tel Dan. In: Biblical archaeology today, 1990. Proceedings of the Second International Congress on Biblical Archaeology, Jerusalem, pp. 57–65.&lt;/ref&gt; in northern Israel. Only later in the Iron Age &lt;ref&gt;Waldbaum, J.C. 1999. The coming of iron in the Eastern Mediterranean: thirty years of archaeological and technological research. In: Pigott, V.C., ed. The archaeometallurgy of the Asian old world. University Museum Monograph 89, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, pp. 27–57.&lt;/ref&gt; did metallic iron start to play a major role as a base metal for tools and weapons.

Sediments exposed to high temperatures: reconstructing pyrotechnological processes in Late Bronze and Iron Age strata at Tel Dor (Israel). Journal of Archaeological Science 34: 358–373.&lt;/ref&gt; enabled the identification of the exact locations of metal working during the end of the Late Bronze Age and the Iron Age. It was also possible to partially reconstruct the pyrotechnological events that probably involved re-melting bronze in an open fireplace.&lt;ref&gt;Berna, F., Goldberg, P. 2007. Assessing Paleolithic pyrotechnology and associated hominin behavior in Israel. Isr. J. Earth Sci. 56: 107–121&lt;/ref&gt; Even after thousands of years the ash, charcoal, calcite, and burnt ground in the immediate vicinity of the metal work area retained significantly higher values of copper (circa 0.05 wt% Cu) than the surrounding archaeological layers. 

During Iron Age II and III and the Persian Period (the first half of the first millennium BCE), copper-based objects continued to be present beside growing numbers of iron products. Silver hoards containing small tongueshaped bar chunks or scrapped jewellery became more and more common in the archaeological context in Israel as well as all over the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, C.M. 2007. Silver in the Age of Iron and the Orientalizing economies of archaic Greece. Ph.D. thesis, University of California, Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar phenomenon was evident during the Persian Period on the coast of Israel, where copper and copper-based objects were found in relatively large quantities &lt;ref&gt;Shalev, S., Kamil, S. 2006. Metal finds from Tel Michal. In: Gorgonzelzany, A., ed. Tel Michal 1996. Jerusalem, pp.
93–07.&lt;/ref&gt; and with parallels in other sites all around the Mediterranean Sea. What could be defined as a basic [[Phoenicia]]n metal “kit” is composed mainly of the “Irano–Scythian” shape of three winged and socketed arrowheads made mainly of tin bronze, sometimes with arsenic and/or lead and left as-cast, and “hand”-like decorated fibulae made of good quality (7 wt%–12 wt% Sn) tin bronze and lead (up to 17 wt% Pb). They underwent mechanical treatment after casting and an extensive final cold working in the area where the needle spring was fastened into the fibulae body. Long unalloyed copper nails that were found in coastal sites as well as part of the structure of ships were found in the [[Ma'agan Michael Ship|shipwreck from Ma’agan Mikhael]].&lt;ref&gt;Kahanov, Y., Doherty, C., Shalev, S. 1999. The metal nails from the Ma’agan Mikhael ship. The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology 28.3: 277–288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly known as the Oriental Library, the '''Oriental Research Institute''' (ORI) at [[Mysore]], [[India]], is a research institute which collects, exhibits, edits, and publishes rare manuscripts written in various scripts like [[Devanagari]] ([[Sanskrit]]), [[Brahmic scripts|Brahmic]] ([[Kannada]]), Nandinagari ([[Sanskrit]]), Grantha, [[Malayalam]], Tigalari, etc.

The Oriental Library was started in 1891 under the patronage of Maharaja [[Chamaraja Wodeyar|Chamarajendra Wadiyar X]]. It is located at the northern end of Krishnaraja Boulevard (adjacently opposite to [[University of Mysore|Mysore University]]'s Crawford Hall), in the architecturally attractive Jubilee Hall built in 1887 to commemorate the golden jubilee of Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria's]] accession to the British throne. It was a part of the Department of Education until 1916, in which year it became part of the newly established [[University of Mysore]]. The Oriental Library was renamed as the Oriental Research Institute in 1943.

==Work==
From the year 1893 to date the ORI has published nearly two hundred titles. The library features rare collections such as the ''[[Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics]]'' by [[James Hastings]], ''A Vedic Concordance'' by [[Maurice Bloomfield]], and critical editions of the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]''. It was the first public library in Mysore city for research and editing of manuscripts. The prime focus was on [[Indology]]. The institute publishes an annual journal called ''Mysore Orientalist''. Its most famous publications include [[Kautilya]]'s ''[[Arthashastra]]'', written in the 4th century BC, edited by Dr. R. Shamashastri, which brought international fame to the institute when published in 1909. 

One day a man from Tanjore handed over a manuscript of Arthashastra written on dried palm leaves to Dr Rudrapatnam Shamashastry, the librarian of Mysore Government Oriental Library now ORI. Shamashastry’s job was to look after the library’s ancient manuscripts. He had never seen anything like these palm leaves before. Here was a book that would revolutionise the knowledge of India's great past. This palm leaf manuscript is preserved in the library, now named Oriental Research Institute. The pages of the book are filled with 1500-year-old Grantha script. It looks like as if they have been printed but the words have been inscribed by hand. Other copies of Arthashastra were later discovered later in other parts of India.&lt;ref&gt;JOYLAND (ourjoyland.in) issue 22 Mar 2017, page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context, my mind remembering a day which was the His Excellency Krishnaraja Wodeyar went to Germany at the time of Dr. R. Shamashastry were working as a curator of Oriental Library, Mysore, The King sat in a meeting held in Germany and introduced himself as the King of Mysore State. Immediately a man stood up and asked, "Are you from our Dr. R. Shamashastry's Mysore?" Because the ''Arthashastra'' edited by him took a fame worldwide. The King wondered and came back to Mysore immediately to see Dr. R. Shamashastry, and also Dr. R. Shamashastry appointed as Asthana Vidwan. ''[[Sritattvanidhi]]'', is a compilation of [[slokas]] by [[Krishnaraja Wodeyar III]]. Three edited manuscripts ''Navaratnamani-mahatmyam'' (a work on [[gemology]]), ''Tantrasara-sangraha'' (a work on sculptures and architecture), and ''Vaidashastra-dipika'' (an ayurvedic text), ''Rasa-kaumudi'' (on mercurial medicine)all of them with English and Kannada translation, are already in advanced stages of printing.

[[File:Oriental Research Institute, Mysore.jpg|thumb|300px|right|&lt;center&gt;Oriental Research Institute&lt;/center&gt;]]

The ORI houses over 45,000 [[Palm leaf manuscript]] bundles and the 75,000 works on those leaves. The manuscripts are [[Talipot palm|palm]] leaves cut to a standard size of 15&amp;nbsp;cm by 3.5&amp;nbsp;cm. Brittle palm leaves are sometimes softened by scrubbing a paste made of [[Finger millet|ragi]] and then used by the ancients for writing, similar to the use of [[papyrus]] in ancient Egypt. Manuscripts are organic materials that run the risk of decay and are prone to be destroyed by [[silverfish]]. To preserve them the ORI applies [[lemon grass]] oil on the manuscripts which acts like a [[pesticide]]. The lemon grass oil also injects natural fluidity into the brittle palm leaves and the [[hydrophobic]] nature of the oil keeps the manuscripts dry so that the text is not lost to decay due to humidity.

The conventional method followed at the ORI was to preserve manuscripts by capturing them in [[microfilm]], which then necessitated the use of a microfilm reader for viewing or studying. Once the ORI has [[digitized]] the manuscripts, the text can be viewed and manipulated by a computer. Software is then used to put together disjointed pieces of manuscripts and to correct or fill in any missing text. In this manner, the manuscripts are restored and enhanced. The original palm leaf manuscripts are also on reference at the ORI for those interested.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14671">'''Pantisocracy''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] πᾶν and ἰσοκρατία meaning "equal or level government by/for all") was a utopian scheme devised in 1794 by the poets [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and [[Robert Southey]] for an [[egalitarian]] community. It is a system of government where all rule equally. They originally intended to establish such a community on the banks of the [[Susquehanna River]] in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Coleridge |last=Newlyn |first=Lucy |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-65909-4 |pages=129 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_sF-QCKwnSIC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=Pantisocracy#PPA129,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but by 1795 Southey had doubts about the viability of this and proposed moving the project to [[Wales]]. The two men were unable to agree on the location, causing the project to collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Romantic Indians: Native  Americans, British Literature, and Transatlantic Culture, 1756–1830 |last=Fulford |first=Tim |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-927337-5 |pages=120–121 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=JRWDvjsIfeMC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=Pantisocracy#PPA120,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==

Coleridge and Southey believed that contemporary society and politics were responsible for cultures of servitude and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, John (1990).  ''Coleridge's Political Thought'', p. 8. St. Martin's Press, New York. {{ISBN|0-312-03645-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having abandoned these corrupting influences along with [[personal property]] for a fresh start in the wilderness, the Pantisocrats hoped that men might be governed by the “dictates of rational benevolence.”

As spelled out by Southey, the utopian community he and Coleridge planned was to be built on two principles: "Pantisocracy" (meaning government by all) and "Aspheterism" (meaning general ownership of property).&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge, Samuel Taylor. Ed. Ernest Coleridge. (1895). ''Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge'', vol. 1, p. 73. Houghton Mifflin &amp; Co., Boston and New York. {{ISBN|1-4212-7161-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme called for a small group of educated individuals to give up their possessions and labor together for the [[common good]]. Few regulations would be necessary to govern the colony and decisions would be made so as to avoid one man having more power than another. Coleridge envisioned Pantisocracy as a way to minimize the greed among men.&lt;ref name="Woodring"&gt;Woodring, Carl R.. ''Politics in the Poetry of Coleridge'', p. 63. The University of Wisconsin Press, Madison.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Coleridge and Southey hoped to enjoy a more relaxing existence than was possible in England, and expected that each member of the community would have to work just two to three hours per day to sustain the [[colony]].&lt;ref name="MacGillivray"&gt;MacGillivray, J.R., Ed. Malcolm Wallace (1931). "The Pantisocracy Scheme and Its Immediate Background" in ''Studies in English''. The University of Toronto Press, Toronto. {{oclc|27738043}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|132}}

The Pantisocrats viewed their attempt as not only a search for personal domestic peace, but also as an attempt to change the status quo in England.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, John (1990).  ''Coleridge's Political Thought'', p. 9. St. Martin's Press, New York. {{ISBN|0-312-03645-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; One influence on the plan was disillusionment with the [[French Revolution]] and with the current politics of [[England]], from which Coleridge may have sought solace through a utopian escape.&lt;ref name="Woodring" /&gt;  Coleridge viewed the utopian scheme as an [[experiment]] that, if successful, might be gradually extended to a larger citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Sister Eugenia (1930).  "Coleridge's Scheme of Pantisocracy and American Travel Accounts", in ''PMLA'' p. 1079. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/457827] 28/1/2010&lt;/ref&gt; Coleridge also hoped that through a more active, natural lifestyle he would live a healthier and more wholesome existence with his family.&lt;ref name="Woodring1"&gt;Woodring, Carl R. (1961). ''Politics in the Poetry of Coleridge'', p. 69. The University of Wisconsin Press, Madison.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and inspirations==

Like many utopian societies, the Pantisocracy envisioned by Coleridge and Southey owed its origins to Plato's ideal commonwealth, envisioned in the later books of ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' and in ''[[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]]''.&lt;ref name="MacGillivray" /&gt;{{rp|134}} More modern examples for the Pantisocrats included [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More’s]] [[Utopia (book)|''Utopia'']], [[Francis Bacon|Francis Bacon’s]] ''[[New Atlantis]]'', [[Tommaso Campanella|Tommaso Campanella’s]] ''Civitas Solis'', and the accounts of [[Cotton Mather]].

The Pantisocrats were also heavily influenced by contemporary travel accounts of the new world.&lt;ref&gt;Sister Eugenia (1930).  "Coleridge's Scheme of Pantisocracy and American Travel Accounts", in ''PMLA'' p. 1069-1074. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/457827] 28/1/2010&lt;/ref&gt; Many writers who visited the new world (including [[Jacques Pierre Brissot|J. P. Brissot]], [[Thomas Cooper (US politician)|Thomas Cooper]], and [[Joseph Priestley]]) described a fresh and inviting country, whose inhabitants were untainted by the evils of society. Coleridge and Southey poured over these and other accounts of the American continent.

==Beginnings==

As early as November, 1793, Robert Southey was envisioning a utopia in the US.&lt;ref name="Southey"&gt;Southey, Rev. Charles Cuthbert, Ed. (1850). ''The Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey'', vol. 1, p. 211. Longman, Brown, Greene, and Longmans, London. {{ISBN|1-4255-6343-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1794, Coleridge left [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] to visit [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and there met Southey, a student and poet.&lt;ref name="MacGillivray" /&gt;{{rp|157–158}} Within weeks, Southey and Coleridge were deep in the planning stages of Pantisocracy.

In July, Coleridge left Oxford for a walking tour of Wales with his friend (and Oxford graduate), Joseph Hucks. Throughout July, Coleridge corresponded regularly with Southey about their plans. Coleridge even went so far as to share his enthusiasm for Pantisocracy with many of the people he and Hucks met along the road, offending several listeners with their radical ideas. During the walking tour Coleridge also encountered an old flame, Mary Evans, and his interaction with her momentarily drove thoughts of Pantisocracy from his mind. On August 3, Coleridge and Hucks rejoined Southey in Bristol.&lt;ref name="MacGillivray" /&gt;{{rp|159}}

In Bristol, Southey and Coleridge continued to flesh out their plans, and spoke openly of their radical ideas. One listener was John Poole, cousin of [[Thomas Poole (tanner)|Tom Poole]] of Nether Stowey, who writes of his encounter with the two young men: “Each of them was shamefully hot with Democratic rage as regards politics, and both [[Infidel]] as to religion. I was extremely indignant…”.&lt;ref name="MacGillivray" /&gt;{{rp|159}}

During this time the young men also became acquainted with the family of Mrs. Fricker, a widow whose daughters seemed willing to join in the scheme (as Mrs. Southey and Coleridge).&lt;ref name="OX"&gt;Beer, John, (2004). "Samuel Taylor Coleridge", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford University Press, Oxford. http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5888&lt;/ref&gt; Southey became interested in Edith and Coleridge began showing interest in Sara.

==Further planning and practical implications==

In the autumn of 1794, Coleridge began seriously to investigate the practical problems of setting up a community in America. During this time he encountered George Dyer, a student familiar with Priestley (who at the time was already living in Pennsylvania), and also spoke with a land agent. In a letter to Southey on September 6 he writes:&lt;ref&gt;Southey, Rev. Charles Cuthbert, Ed. (1850). ''The Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey'', vol. 1, p. 193-196. Longman, Brown, Greene, and Longmans, London. {{ISBN|1-4255-6343-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|[The land agent] says £2000 will do; that he doubts not we can contract for our passage under £400; that we shall buy the land a great deal cheaper when we arrive in American than we could do in England…That twelve men may easily clear 300 acres in four or five months; and that, for 600 dollars, a thousand acres may be cleared and houses built on them. He recommends the Susquehannah for its excessive beauty and its security from hostile Indians.}}

Neither Coleridge nor Southey possessed the requisite wealth, but plans were laid for a spring departure in 1795.&lt;ref name="MacGillivray" /&gt;{{rp|165}} The young men hoped that other, wealthier immigrants who would join in the endeavor would be willing to fund it. Returning to Cambridge in late September, Coleridge began to spread word of the plan.

Coleridge at this time envisioned the community including “twelve men with their families,” among whom the costs would be split, with the wealthier members of the community making up for the shortcomings of the poorer members.&lt;ref name="MacGillivray" /&gt;{{rp|166}} Besides money, other practical issues arose. Having little ability in farming or carpentry, the young men planned to acquire these skills over the winter in time for a March departure. Among the families who were planning to make the voyage were children, and Coleridge worried that they might already be deeply prejudiced by society, which could subvert and corrupt the Pantisocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge, Samuel Taylor. Ed. Ernest Coleridge. (1895). ''Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge'', vol. 1, p. 168. Houghton Mifflin &amp; Co., Boston and New York. {{ISBN|1-4212-7161-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disillusionment==

As the date set for departure arrived and the financial difficulties in undertaking the journey remained unsolved, the would-be emigrants began to lose excitement and resolve.&lt;ref name="MacGillivray" /&gt;{{rp|168}} Besides their lack of funds, other concerns challenged the Pantisocrats. Contrary to the glowing travel narratives that Coleridge pored over while researching the prospect of settling in America, other accounts of American life were less encouraging, and described a difficult and laborious existence.&lt;ref&gt;Sister Eugenia (1930). "Coleridge's Scheme of Pantisocracy and American Travel Accounts", in ''PMLA'' p. 1079-1081. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/457827] 28/1/2010&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of Thomas Cooper’s ''Some Information Respecting America,'' (one of the positive accounts of the [[New World]] that Coleridge consulted) a reviewer describes Cooper and those like him as “rival auctioneers, or rather show-men, stationed for the allurement of incautious passengers. 'Pray, ladies and gentlemen, walk in and admire the wonders of Kentucky—Pray, stop and see the incomparable beauties of the Susquehanna.'”

Coleridge also faced personal challenges in carrying out the scheme. He received a letter from Mary Evans which argued against the plan, and his feelings for her for a time swayed him against Pantisocracy.&lt;ref name="OX" /&gt; Learning that she had become engaged, Coleridge turned his attention back to Pantisocracy and Sara Fricker. Under pressure from Southey to act with regard to Sara (both because of the demands of Pantisocracy and also because she was being courted by other men), Coleridge married Sara in October 1795.

As plans bogged down, Southey and Coleridge eventually reached an impasse. Southey at one point advocated taking servants to the new world to do the hard work, a proposition Coleridge scoffed at. Southey and other would-be Pantisocrats also considered a less ambitious plan: the purchase of a common farm in Wales. Coleridge, still dreaming of the new world, felt that this compromise failed to meet the standards of Pantisocracy. In a letter to Southey he complains that private resources would not be abandoned at the farm in Wales and that, "In short, we were to commence partners in a petty farming trade."&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge, Samuel Taylor. Ed. Ernest Coleridge. (1895). ''Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge'', vol. 1, p. 140. Houghton Mifflin &amp; Co., Boston and New York. {{ISBN|1-4212-7161-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the winter of 1795, the dream of Pantisocracy had all but died out.

==Impact on Coleridge==

There are two of Coleridge’s poems that directly address the plans he and Southey were envisioning. "Pantisocracy," a sonnet sent to Southey in a letter of September 18, 1794, was not published during Coleridge’s lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge, Samuel Taylor. Ed. William Keach. (1997). ''The Complete Poems'', p. 57-58. Houghton Mifflin &amp; Co., Boston and New York. {{ISBN|1-4212-7161-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second sonnet, "On the Prospect of Establishing a Pantisocracy," has also been attributed to Coleridge, and was first published in 1826. Many of Coleridge's other works of the time implicitly suggest the New World, and may owe a debt to his musings over the Susquehanna.&lt;ref&gt;Cottle, Joseph. (1847). ''Reminiscences of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey'', p. 22. Houlston and Stoneman, London.&lt;/ref&gt; An early version of the poem "To a Young Ass" also makes mention of Pantisocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Woodring, Carl R. (1961). ''Politics in the Poetry of Coleridge'', p. 70. The University of Wisconsin Press, Madison. {{ISBN|978-0-299-02440-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pantisocracy presented Coleridge a practical outlet for ideas he had previously only considered theoretically.&lt;ref&gt;Colmer, John. Ed. R.L. Brett. (1971). '"Coleridge and Politics," in ''Writers and Their Background: S.T. Coleridge'' p. 254 . G. Bell &amp; Sons, London. {{ISBN|0-7135-1900-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the scheme never produced an actual community, it did impact Coleridge's philosophical thinking. His lectures of the time reflect his Pantisocratic thinking on social relations and wealth. He wrote of the scheme years afterward that it was “a plan as harmless as it was extravagant” but it can be argued that much of the fantastic imagery and political thoughts present in his work owe a debt both to Pantisocracy and to the research he conducted in preparation for his voyage.&lt;ref&gt;Sister Eugenia (1930).  "Coleridge's Scheme of Pantisocracy and American Travel Accounts", in ''PMLA'' p. 1084. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/457827] 28/1/2010&lt;/ref&gt; On a literal level, perhaps the greatest impact Pantisocracy had on the young Coleridge was the addition of Sara Fricker (and their subsequent family) to his life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36536">'''Plaçage''' was a recognized extralegal system in French and Spanish slave colonies of North America (including the Caribbean) by which ethnic European men entered into civil unions with [[person of color|non-Europeans]] of African, Native American and mixed-race descent. The term comes from the French ''placer'' meaning "to place with". The women were not legally recognized as wives but were known as ''placées''; their relationships were recognized among the [[free people of color]] as ''mariages de la main gauche'' or [[Morganatic marriage|left-handed marriages]]. They became institutionalized with contracts or negotiations that settled property on the woman and her children, and in some cases gave them freedom if enslaved. The system flourished throughout the [[Louisiana (New France)|French]] and [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Spanish colonial]] periods, reaching its zenith during the latter, between 1769 and 1803.

It was widely practiced in New Orleans, where planter society had created enough wealth to support the system. It also took place in the Latin-influenced cities of [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]] and [[Biloxi, Mississippi]]; [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], [[Alabama]]; [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] and [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], [[Florida]];&lt;ref&gt;''Chained to the Rock of Adversity, To Be Free, Black &amp; Female in the Old South,'' edited by Virginia Meacham Gould, University of Georgia Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Saint-Domingue]] (now the Republic of [[Haiti]]). Plaçage became associated with [[New Orleans]] as part of its cosmopolitan society.

In recent years, at least three historians (''viz.'' Kenneth Aslakson, Emily Clark, and Carol Schlueter) have challenged the [[historicity]] of plaçage and have referred to many of its features, including quadroon balls, as "a myth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mixedracestudies.org/wordpress/?tag=quadroon-balls|title=Mixed Race Studies   » quadroon balls|website=www.mixedracestudies.org|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/stacy-parker-aab/quadroons-for-beginners-d_b_3869605.html|title=Quadroons for Beginners: Discussing the Suppressed and Sexualized History of Free Women of Color with Author Emily Clark|first=Stacy Parker Le|last=Melle|date=4 September 2013|website=huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and development of the plaçage system==
The plaçage system developed from the predominance of men among early colonial populations, who took women as consorts from Native Americans, current free women of color that came to America from places such as Saint-Domingue and some enslaved Africans. Adding to what was known as free people of color in Louisiana, and especially New Orleans, during the colonial years, from whom wealthy men would choose. In this period there was a shortage of European women, as the colonies were dominated in the early day by male explorers and colonists. Given the harsh conditions in Louisiana, persuading women to follow the men was not easy. France recruited willing farm- and city-dwelling women, known as casket or ''[[casquette girl]]s'', because they brought all their possessions to the colonies in a small trunk or casket. France also sent women convicted along with their debtor husbands, and in 1719, deported 209 women felons "who were of a character to be sent to the French settlement in Louisiana."&lt;ref name=Morlas&gt;Katy F. Morlas, "La Madame et la Mademoiselle," graduate thesis in history, Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; (France also relocated young women orphans known as [[King's Daughters]] ({{lang-fr|filles du roi}}) to their colonies for marriage: to both Canada and Louisiana.)

[[Image:departcassettegirls.jpg|left|thumbnail|A print by Dupin after [[Jean-Antoine Watteau]] depicting "comfort women" embarking unwillingly for the Americas. Whether "comfort women", "casket girls", or aristocrats, French women were reluctant to migrate to the French colonies.]]
Historian Joan Martin maintains that there is little documentation that "casket girls", considered among the ancestors of white French Creoles, were brought to Louisiana. The [[Ursulines|Ursuline order of nuns]] supposedly chaperoned the casket girls until they married, but the order has denied they followed this practice. Martin suggests this was a myth, and that interracial relationships occurred from the beginning of the encounter among Europeans, Native Americans and Africans. She also writes that some Creole families who today identify as white had ancestors during the colonial period who were African or [[multiracial]], and whose descendants married white over generations.&lt;ref&gt;Joan M. Martin, ''Placage and the Louisiana Gens de Couleur Libre'', in [[Creole language|Creole]], edited by Sybil Kein, Louisiana State University Press, Baton Rouge, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through warfare and raids, Native American women were often captured to be traded, sold, or taken as wives. At first, the colony generally imported African men to use as slave labor because of the heavy work of clearing to develop plantations. Over time, it also imported African women as slaves. Marriage between the races was forbidden according to the [[Code Noir]] of the eighteenth century, but interracial sex continued. The upper class [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] men during this period often did not marry until their late twenties or early thirties. [[Premarital sex]] with an intended white bride, especially if she was of high rank, was not permitted socially.

===Free people of color===
White male colonists, often the younger sons of noblemen, military men, and planters, who needed to accumulate some wealth before they could marry, took women of color as consorts before marriage or in some cases after their first wives died. Merchants and administrators also followed this practice if they were wealthy enough. When the women bore children, they were sometimes emancipated along with their children. Both the woman and her children might take the surnames of the man. When Creole men reached an age when they were expected to marry, some also kept their relationships with their placées, but this was less common. A wealthy white man could have two (or more) families: one legal, and the other not. Their mixed-race children became the nucleus of the class of [[free people of color]] or ''[[gens de couleur|gens de couleur libres]]'' in Louisiana and Saint-Domingue. After the [[Haitian Revolution]] in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, many refugees came to New Orleans, adding a new wave of French-speaking free people of color.

During the period of French and Spanish rule, the ''gens de couleur'' came to constitute a third class in New Orleans and other former French cities - between the white Creoles and the mass of black slaves. They had certain status and rights, and often acquired education and property. Later their descendants became leaders in New Orleans, holding political office in the city and state, and becoming part of what developed as the [[African-American middle class]] in the [[United States]].

By 1788, 1500 Creole women of color and black women were being maintained by white men.&lt;ref&gt;Monique Guillory, "Under One Roof: The Sins and Sanctity of the New Orleans Quadroon Balls", in ''Race Consciousness'', edited by Judith Jackson Fossett and Jeffrey A. Tucker, New York University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain customs had evolved. It was common for a wealthy, married Creole to live primarily outside New Orleans on his [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] with his white family. He often kept a second address in the city to use for entertaining and socializing among the white elite. He had built or bought a house for his placée and their children. She and her children were part of the society of Creoles of color. The white world might not recognize the placée as a wife legally and socially, but she was recognized as such among the Creoles of color. Some of the women acquired [[slavery|slaves]] and plantations. Particularly during the Spanish colonial era, a woman might be listed as owning slaves; these were sometimes relatives whom she intended to free after earning enough money to buy their freedom.

While in New Orleans (or other cities), the man would cohabit with the placée as an official "boarder" at her Creole cottage or house. Many were located near [[Rampart Street]] in New Orleans-—once the demarcation line or wall between the city and the frontier. Other popular neighborhoods for Creoles of color were the [[Faubourg Marigny]] and [[Tremé]]. If the man was not married, he might keep a separate residence, preferably next door or in the same or next block as his placée. He often took part in and arranged for the upbringing and education of their children. For a time both boys and girls were educated in France, as there were no schools in New Orleans for mixed-race children. As supporting such a plaçage arrangement(s) ran into thousands of dollars per year, it was limited to the wealthy.

===Inheritance and work===
Upon the death of her protector, the placée and her family could, on legal challenge, expect up to a third of the man's property. Some white lovers tried, and succeeded, in making their mixed-race children primary heirs over other white descendants or relatives. A notable inheritance case was the daughters of [[Nicolás María Vidal]], a former high official in Spanish Louisiana, who with their mother, Eufrosina Hisnard, successfully petitioned the U.S. government in the 1830s to intercede on their behalf to secure a portion of Vidal's estate.&lt;ref name="Congress1834"&gt;{{cite book|author=United States Congress|title=American State Papers: Documents, Legislative and Executive, of the Congress of the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MhVFAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA868|year=1834|publisher=Gales and Seaton|location=Washington, D.C.|chapter=Transactions in the Floridas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ClintonGillespie1997"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clinton|first1=Catherine|last2=Gillespie|first2=Michele|title=The Devil's Lane: Sex and Race in the Early South|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=37q5j7Ix-fkC&amp;pg=PA239|accessdate=17 October 2018|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|isbn=978-0-19-802721-8|pages=238–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The women in these relationships often worked to develop assets: acquiring property, running a legitimate rooming-house, or a small business as a hairdresser, [[marchande]] (female street or country merchant/vendor), or a seamstress. She could also become a placée to another white Creole. She sometimes taught her daughters to become placées, by education and informal schooling in dress, comportment, and ways to behave. A mother negotiated with a young man for the dowry or property settlement, sometimes by contract, for her daughter if a white Creole were interested in her. A former placée could also marry or cohabit with a Creole man of color and have more children.

[[File:FashionableMarquisB.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Creole woman of color with maid, from a watercolor series by Édouard Marquis, New Orleans, 1867]]
[[Image:Creole women of color out taking the air, from a watercolor series by Édouard Marquis, New Orleans, 1867.jpg|upright|thumb|Creole women of color out taking the air, from a watercolor series by Édouard Marquis, New Orleans, 1867]]

Contrary to popular misconceptions, placées were not and did not become prostitutes. Creole men of color objected to the practice as denigrating the virtue of Creole women of color, but some, as descendants of white males, benefited by the transfer of social capital. Martin writes, "They did not choose to live in concubinage; what they chose was to survive."{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, after Reconstruction and with the reassertion of white supremacy across the former Confederacy, the white Creole historians, [[Charles Gayarré]] and [[Alcée Fortier]], wrote histories that did not address plaçage in much detail. They suggested that little race mixing had occurred during the colonial period, and that the placées had seduced or led white Creole men astray. They wrote that the French Creoles (in the sense of having long been native to Louisiana) were ethnic Europeans who were threatened by the spectre of race-mixing like other Southern whites.

Gayarré, when younger, was said to have taken a woman of color as his placée and she had their children, to his later shame. He married a white woman late in life. His earlier experience inspired his novel ''Fernando de Lemos''.

==Notable placées==

===Marie Thérèse Metoyer===
[[Marie Thérèse Metoyer]] ''dite'' [[Coincoin]] became an icon of black female entrepreneurship in colonial Louisiana. She was born at the frontier outpost of [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]] on [[Cane River]] in August 1742 as a slave of the post founder, the controversial explorer [[Louis Juchereau de St. Denis]]. She would be, for twenty years, the placée of a French colonial merchant-turned-planter, [[Claude Thomas Pierre Métoyer]] two years her junior. At the onset of their plaçage, she was already the mother of five children; she would bear ten more to Métoyer. In 1778, he freed her after the parish priest filed charges against Coincoin as a "public concubine" and threatened to have her sold at New Orleans if they did not end their relationship. As a free woman, she remained with Métoyer until 1788, when his growing fortune persuaded him to take a wife who could provide legal heirs. (He chose another Marie Thérèse, a white Créole of French and German birth.)

In setting Coincoin aside, Métoyer donated to her his interest in 80 [[arpent]]s, about {{convert|68|acre|m2}} of unpatented land, adjacent to his plantation, to help support their free-born offspring. On that modest tract, Coincoin planted tobacco, a valuable commodity in the struggling colony. She and her children trapped bears and wild turkeys for sales of meat, hide, and oil locally and at the New Orleans market. She also manufactured medicine, a skill shared by her freed-slave sister Marie Louise ''dite'' Mariotte and likely one acquired from their African-born parents. With this money, she progressively bought the freedom of four of her first five children and several grandchildren, before investing in three African-born slaves to provide the physical labor that became more difficult as she aged. After securing a colonial patent on her homestead in 1794, she petitioned for and was given a land concession from the Spanish crown. On that piney-woods tract of 800 arpents (667 ac) on Old Red River, about 5&amp;nbsp;mi from her farmstead, she set up a vacherie (a ranch) and engaged a Spaniard to tend her cattle. Shortly before her death in 1816, Coincoin sold her homestead and divided her remaining property (her piney-woods land, the three African slaves, and their offspring) among her own progeny.

As often happened among the children of plaçages, Coincoin's one surviving daughter by Métoyer, Marie Susanne, became a placée also. As a young woman, apparently with the blessing of both parents, she entered into a relationship with a newly arrived physician, Joseph Conant from New Orleans. When he left Cane River, soon after the birth of their son, she formed a second and lifelong plaçage with a Cane River planter, Jean Baptiste Anty. As a second-generation entrepreneur, Susanne became far more successful than her mother and died in 1838 leaving an estate of $61,600 (equivalent to $1,500,000 in 2009 currency).

Modern archaeological work at the site of Coincoin's farmstead is documenting some of the aspects of her domestic life. A mid-nineteenth century dwelling, now dubbed the Coincoin-Prudhomme House although it was not the actual site of her residence, commemorates her within the Cane River National Heritage Area. Popular lore also has, erroneously, credited her with the ownership of a Cane River plantation founded by her son Louis Metoyer, known today as [[Melrose Plantation]], and its historic buildings Yucca House and [[African House]]. Her eldest half-French son, [[Nicolas Augustin Métoyer]], founded [[St. Augustine Parish (Isle Brevelle) Church]], the spiritual center of Cane River's large community of Creoles of color who trace their heritage to Coincoin.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Elizabeth Shown.

===Eulalie de Mandéville===

There were many other examples of white Creole fathers who reared and carefully and quietly placed their daughters of color with the sons of known friends or family members. This occurred with [[Eulalie de Mandéville]], the elder half-sister of color to the eccentric nobleman, politician, and land developer [[Bernard de Marigny|Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandéville]]. Taken from her slave mother as a baby, and partly raised by a white grandmother, 22-year-old Eulalie was "placed" by her father, [[Count Pierre Enguerrand Philippe, Écuyer de Mandéville, Sieur de Marigny]], with [[Eugène de Macarty]], a member of the famous [[French people|French]]-[[Irish people|Irish]] clan in 1796. Their alliance resulted in five children and lasted almost fifty years.&lt;ref name=Morlas/&gt;

[[Image:BernardMarignyPortrait.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Portrait of Bernard de Marigny, flamboyant Creole millionaire and the half-brother of Eulalie de Mandéville de Macarty.]]
Macarty, like some white Creoles, never married a white woman.

[[Image:AugustinDeMacarty.jpg|right|thumb|Portrait of Augustin de Macarty, military man, mayor of New Orleans, and brother of Eugène de Macarty.]]
In contrast to the Macartys' stable relationship, Eugène's brother [[Augustin de Macarty]] was married and was said to have had numerous, complex affairs with Creole women of color. When he died, several women made claims on behalf of their children against his estate.&lt;ref&gt;Violet Harrington Bryan, "Marcus Christian's Treatment of Les Gens de Couleur Libre", in Creole, edited by Sybil Kein, Louisiana State University Press, Baton Rouge, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

On his deathbed in 1845, Eugène de Macarty married Eulalie. He willed her all of his money and property, then worth $12,000. His white relatives, including his niece, [[Madame LaLaurie|Marie Delphine de Macarty LaLaurie]], contested the will. The court upheld his will. After Eulalie's death, their surviving children defeated another attempt by Macarty's relatives to claim his estate, by then worth more than $150,000. Eulalie de Mandéville de Macarty became a successful [[marchande]] and ran a dairy. She died in 1848.

===Rosette Rochon===
&lt;span id="RosetteRochon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:rosetterochon.gif|right|thumbnail|Sketch of Rosette Rochon: banker, speculator, entrepreneur, and placée.]] --&gt;

[[Rosette Rochon]] was born in 1767 in colonial [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], the daughter of Pierre Rochon, a shipbuilder from a Québécois family (family name was Rocheron in [[Québec]]), and his mulâtresse slave-consort Marianne, who bore him five other children. Once Rosette reached a suitable age, she became the consort of a Monsieur Hardy, with whom she relocated to the colony of [[Saint Domingue]]. During her sojourn there, Hardy must have died or relinquished his relationship with her; for in 1797 during the Haitian Revolution, she escaped to New Orleans, where she later became the placée of Joseph Forstal and Charles Populus, both wealthy white New Orleans Creoles.

Rochon came to speculate in real estate in the [[French Quarter]]; she eventually owned rental property, opened grocery stores, made loans, bought and sold mortgages, and owned and rented out (hired out) slaves. She also traveled extensively back and forth to [[Haiti]], where her son by Hardy had become a government official in the new republic. Her social circle in New Orleans once included [[Marie Laveau]], [[Jean Lafitte]], and the free black contractors and real estate developers [[Jean-Louis Doliolle]] and his brother [[Joseph Doliolle]].

In particular, Rochon became one of the earliest investors in the [[Faubourg Marigny]], acquiring her first lot from [[Bernard de Marigny]] in 1806. Bernard de Marigny, the Creole speculator, refused to sell the lots he was subdividing from his family plantation to anyone who spoke English. While this turned out to be a losing financial decision, Marigny felt more comfortable with the French-speaking, Catholic free people of color (having relatives, lovers, and even children on this side of the color line). Consequently, much of Faubourg Marigny was built by free black artisans for free people of color or for French-speaking white Creoles. Rochon remained largely illiterate, dying in 1863 at the age of 96, leaving behind an [[Estate (law)|estate]] valued at $100,000 (today, an estate worth a million dollars).

===Marie Laveau===
[[Marie Laveau]] (also spelled Leveau, Laveaux), known as the [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] queen of New Orleans, was born between 1795 and 1801 as the daughter of a white Haitian plantation owner, Charles Leveaux, and his mixed black and Indian placée Marguerite Darcantel (or D'Arcantel). Because there were so many whites as well as free people of color in [[Haiti]] with the same names, Leveaux could also have been a free man of color who owned slaves and property as well. All three may have escaped Haiti along with thousands of other Creole whites and Creoles of color during the slave uprisings that culminated in the French colony's becoming the only independent black republic in the New World.

At 17, Marie married a Creole man of color popularly known as [[Jacques Paris]] (however, in some documents, he is known as [[Santiago Paris]]). Paris either died, disappeared or deliberately abandoned her (some accounts also relate that he was a merchant seaman or sailor in the navy) after she produced a daughter. Laveau was styling herself as the Widow Paris and was a hairdresser for white matrons (she was also reckoned to be an herbalist and [[yellow fever]] nurse) when she met [[Louis-Christophe Dumesnil de Glapion]] and in the early 1820s, they became lovers.

Marie was just beginning her spectacular career as a [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] practitioner (she would not be declared a "queen" until about 1830), and Dumesnil de Glapion was a fiftyish white Creole veteran of the [[Battle of New Orleans]] with relatives on both sides of the color line. Recently,{{vague|date=September 2016}} it has been alleged that Dumesnil de Glapion was so in love with Marie, he refused to live separately from his placée according to racial [[convention (norm)|custom]]. In an unusual decision, Dumesnil de Glapion [[Passing (racial identity)|passed]] as a man of color in order to live with her under respectable circumstances—thus explaining the confusion many historians have had whether he was truly white or black.&lt;ref&gt;Caryn Cosse Bell, "The Real Marie Laveau", review of Voodoo Queen: The Spirited Lives of Marie Laveau, by Martha Ward, University Press of Mississippi, Jackson, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is popularly thought that Marie presented Dumesnil de Glapion with fifteen children, only five are listed in vital statistics and of these, two daughters—one the famous Marie Euchariste or [[Marie Leveau II]]—lived to adulthood. Marie Euchariste closely resembled her mother and startled many who thought that Marie Leveau had been resurrected by the black arts, or could be at two places at once, beliefs that the daughter did little to correct.

Sebastopol: This [[Plantation complexes in the Southeastern United States#Plantation house|plantation house]] and property was built and cultivated by Don Pedro Morin in the 1830s in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana. It was bought twenty years later by Colonel Ignatius Szymanski a Polish American who later served in the Confederate Army, and renamed Sebastopol. At his death, Colonel Szymanski willed this estate to his placée Eliza Romain, a free woman of color, and to their son John Szymanski.

==Quadroon balls==
The term [[quadroon]] is a fractional one referring to a person with one white and one mulatto parent, some courts would have considered one-fourth Black. The "quadroon balls" were social events designed to encourage mixed-race women to form liaisons with wealthy white men through a system of concubinage known as plaçage.&lt;ref&gt;Monique Guillory, "Under One Roof: The Sins and Sanctity of the New Orleans Quadroon Balls", 68-9&lt;/ref&gt; Monique Guillory writes about quadroon balls that took place in New Orleans, the city most strongly associated with these events. She approaches the balls in context of the history of a building the structure of which is now the Bourbon Orleans Hotel. Inside is the Orleans Ballroom, a legendary, if not entirely factual, location for the earliest quadroon balls.

[[File:SignaresBal.jpg|thumb|Depiction of a [[signare]] ball in colonial [[Saint-Louis, Senegal]].]]

The origin of quadroon balls can be traced to the ''[[redoutes des filles de couleur]]'' in [[Cap-Francais]] in the French colony of [[Saint Domingue]].&lt;ref name=Atlantic&gt;Jorge Canizares-Esguerra, Matt D. Childs, James Sidbury: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Vxx0F6zZUfwC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=redoutes+des+filles+de+couleur+saint+domingue&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NhDck48HCS&amp;sig=MqL4IUUKqWS5Oa7DwwusI4w6suM&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjA6Z618LHVAhUSalAKHdYMCT0Q6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=redoutes%20des%20filles%20de%20couleur%20saint%20domingue&amp;f=false The Black Urban Atlantic in the Age of the Slave Trade]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Burnard, John Garrigus: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=FNM7DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=saint+domingue+white+women&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiak8LRta_VAhVmQZoKHVyhDY0Q6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=quadroon%20balls&amp;f=false The Plantation Machine: Atlantic Capitalism in French Saint-Domingue]''&lt;/ref&gt;  The French colony, where the male population outnumbered women, white women were few and there were few alternatives to prostitution for free women of color, was known in the Caribbean for its "Mulatto Courtesans", whose trademark was elegance, a haughty demeanor and the demand to be courted.&lt;ref name=Atlantic/&gt; As there were no brothels in the colony, where sex workers worked independently, these balls were the place where the most exclusive courtesans met their clients; having met, they were set up as the official housekeeper or openly kept as mistresses,&lt;ref name=Atlantic/&gt; and when their male client died or left for France, they were normally left with money, property or slaves for their future support.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart R. King: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ESy9AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=juli+dahey+saint+domingue&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nlcLr4Wg4y&amp;sig=-MjhjIZwwApjYg6s_9H0cOWRfQo&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eJ-UVIBL4qLIA9KtgdAN&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=juli%20dahey%20saint%20domingue&amp;f=false Blue Coat Or Powdered Wig: Free People of Color in Pre-revolutionary Saint Domingue]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1805, a man named Albert Tessier began renting a dance hall where he threw twice weekly dances for free quadroon women and white men only.&lt;ref&gt;Monique Guillory, "Under One Roof: The Sins and Sanctity of the New Orleans Quadroon Balls", 80&lt;/ref&gt; These dances were elegant and elaborate, designed to appeal to wealthy white men. Although race mixing was prohibited by New Orleans law, it was common for white gentleman to attend the balls, sometimes stealing away from white balls to mingle with the city's quadroon female population. The principal desire of quadroon women attending these balls was to become ''placée'' as the mistress of a wealthy gentleman, usually a young white Creole or a visiting European.&lt;ref&gt;Monique Guillory, "Under One Roof: The Sins and Sanctity of the New Orleans Quadroon Balls", 81&lt;/ref&gt; These arrangements were a common occurrence, Guillory suggests, because the highly educated, socially refined quadroons were prohibited from marrying white men and were unlikely to find Black men of their own status.

A quadroon's mother usually negotiated with an admirer the compensation that would be received for having the woman as his mistress. Typical terms included some financial payment to the parent, financial and/or housing arrangements for the quadroon herself, and, many times, paternal recognition of any children the union produced. Guillory points out that some of these matches were as enduring and exclusive as marriages. A beloved quadroon mistress had the power to destabilize white marriages and families, something she was much resented for.

According to Guillory, the system of plaçage had a basis in the economics of mixed race. The plaçage of black women with white lovers, Guillory writes, could take place only because of the socially determined value of their light skin, the same light skin that commanded a higher price on the slave block, where light skinned girls fetched much higher prices than did prime field hands.&lt;ref&gt;Monique Guillory, "Under One Roof: The Sins and Sanctity of the New Orleans Quadroon Balls", 82&lt;/ref&gt; Guillory posits the quadroon balls as the best among severely limited options for these near-white women, a way for them to control their sexuality and decide the price of their own bodies. She contends, "The most a mulatto mother and a quadroon daughter could hope to attain in the rigid confines of the black/white world was some semblance of economic independence and social distinction from the slaves and other blacks" (83). She notes that many participants in the balls were successful in actual businesses when they could no longer rely on an income from the plaçage system. She speculates they developed business acumen from the process of marketing their own bodies.

'''''Printing and the Mind of Man''''' is a book first published in 1967 and based on an exhibition in 1963. 

'''''PMM''''', as it is usually abbreviated, is regarded as a standard [[Bibliography|bibliographical]] reference, and offers a survey of the impact of [[printing|printed books]] on the development of [[western culture|western civilization]].

The book developed from an exhibition put on at two locations to coincide with the 1963 [[International Printing Machinery and Allied Trades Exhibition]] (IPEX). At the behest of typographer [[Stanley Morison]] it was decided to put together an exhibition of the contribution printing had made to the enlargement of human knowledge. A display at [[Earls Court]] concentrated on the technical side of printing, while a display at the [[British Museum]] looked more at fine printing. However, both displays had the quite novel intention of promoting the study of books for their role in advancing factual knowledge, rather than for their aesthetics. [[Ian Fleming]], who lent 40 books from his library, was among the private collectors who contributed to the exhibition.

The catalogue, (which might be considered the pre-first edition of ''PMM'') was printed by [[Oxford University Press]], edited by [[John_Carter_(author)|John Carter]], Stanley Morison, Percy H. Muir and others and entitled: ''Catalogue of a display of printing mechanisms and printed materials arranged to illustrate the history of Western civilization and the means of the multiplication of literary texts since the 15th century, organised in connection with the eleventh International Printing Machinery and Allied Trades Exhibition, under the title Printing and the Mind of Man, assembled at the British Museum and at Earls Court, London, 16–27 July 1963''.

A book-length edition, revised and enlarged, was printed at [[Cambridge University Press]] and published in 1967 by [[Orion Publishing Group|Cassell]] in London and Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston in New York. This first book edition was entitled '''''Printing and the Mind of Man, a descriptive catalogue illustrating the impact of print on the evolution of Western civilization during five centuries'''''. It was edited by John Carter and Percy H. Muir and expanded upon the theme of the impact of printing on human thought.

A second revised edition was published in 1983 by Karl Pressler in [[Munich]] ({{ISBN|3-9800047-3-2}}).

'''''La Revue Archéologique''''', published in [[Paris]] is one of the oldest, longest-running scientific journals. First appearing in 1844, it is neither the organ of an institution nor of any school, but has complete independence, under the guidance of its current editor, Marie-Christine Hellmann. ''La Revue Archéologique'' appears twice annually.

Its center of interest has remained [[Classical Antiquity]] since its origins, but its sphere of interest extends beyond, to the [[Ancient Near East]], [[Anatolia]], [[Etruscans|Etruscan Italy]] and [[Central Asia]].

'''Ridge and furrow''' is an [[Archaeology|archaeological]] pattern of ridges (Medieval Latin ''sliones'') and troughs created by a system of [[plough]]ing used in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]], typical of the [[open field system]]. It is also known as '''rig''' (or '''rigg''') '''and furrow''', mostly in the North East of England and in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Levick|first=Paula|title=Ridge and Furrow|url=https://www.archeox.net/fact-sheets/ridge-and-furrow|work=Archaeology of East Oxford|accessdate=17 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219171656/https://www.archeox.net/fact-sheets/ridge-and-furrow|archivedate=19 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RiggSpellingExampleBreamish&gt;{{cite web|title=Breamish Valley Archaeology Project|url=http://www.northumberlandnationalpark.org.uk/understanding/historyarchaeology/hillfortheritageintroduction/breamishvalleyproject|publisher=Northumberland National Park Authority|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://canmore.org.uk/thesaurus/1/54/RIG%20AND%20FURROW|title=RIG AND FURROW {{!}} Canmore|website=canmore.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest examples date to the immediate post-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period and the system was used until the 17th century in some areas, as long as the open field system survived. Surviving ridge and furrow topography is found in Great Britain, Ireland and elsewhere in Europe.  The surviving ridges are parallel, ranging from {{Convert|3|to|22|yd|m|0}} apart and up to {{Convert|24|in|cm}} tall – they were much taller when in use. Older examples are often curved. 

Ridge and furrow topography was a result of ploughing with non-reversible ploughs on the same strip of land each year.  It is visible on land that was ploughed in the Middle Ages, but which has not been ploughed since then.  No actively ploughed ridge and furrow survives.

The ridges or ''lands'' became units in landholding, in assessing the work of the [[ploughman]] and in reaping in autumn.&lt;ref name=Homans&gt;[[George C. Homans]], ''English Villagers of the Thirteenth Century'', 2nd ed. 1991: "The Skills of Husbandmen" pp44ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[Image:Ploughing match from The Powerhouse Museum Collection.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Ploughing with a single-sided plough in a ploughing match, showing furrows heaped towards centre of strip (The different strips will eventually meet). Note that this is not yet ridge and furrow, as the strip has only been ploughed once in this location.]]

Traditional ploughs have the [[Plowshare|ploughshare and mouldboard]] on the right, and so turn the soil over to the right (see [[Plough#Single-sided ploughing|single-sided ploughing]]).  This means that the plough cannot return along the same line for the next furrow.  Instead, ploughing is done in a clockwise direction around a long rectangular strip (a ''land'').  After ploughing one of the long sides of the strip, the plough is removed from the ground at the end of the field, moved across the unploughed ''headland'' (the short end of the strip), then put back in the ground to work back down the other long side of the strip.  The width of the ploughed strip is fairly narrow, to avoid having to drag the plough too far across the headland. This process has the effect of moving the soil in each half of the strip one furrow's-width towards the centre line each time the field is ploughed.

In the Middle Ages each strip was managed by one family, within large open fields held in common (see [[strip cultivation]]), and the locations of the strips were the same each year.  The movement of soil year after year gradually built the centre of each strip up into a ridge, leaving a dip, or "furrow" between each ridge (note that this use of "furrow" is different from that for the small furrow left by each pass of the plough).  The building up of a ridge was called ''filling'' or ''gathering'', and was sometimes done before ploughing began.  The raised ridges offered better drainage in a wet climate: moisture drained into the furrows, and since the ridges were laid down a slope, in a sloping field water would collect in a ditch at the bottom.&lt;ref name=Homans/&gt; Only on some well-drained soils were the fields left flat. In damper soil towards the base of the ridge, pulses ([[pea]]s or [[Vicia faba|bean]]s) or dredge (a mixture of [[oat]]s and [[barley]]) might be sown where [[wheat]] would have become waterlogged, as [[Thomas Tusser]] suggested in the 16th century:

&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em;"&gt;
For wheat till land
Where water doth stand.
Sow pease or dredge
below in that redge.
{{Full|date=August 2018|reason=Need title of poem.}}&lt;/poem&gt;  

The dip often marked the boundary between plots.  Although they varied, strips would traditionally be a [[furlong]] (a "furrow-long") in length, (220 yards, about 200 metres), and from about {{Convert|5|yd|m}} up to a [[chain (unit)|chain]] wide (22 yards, about 20 metres), giving an area of from {{Convert|0.25|to|1|acre|ha|sigfig=1}}.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;[http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba33/ba33feat.html David Hall, "Medieval fields in their many forms", ''British Archaeology'', '''33''']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riverreatrail.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=59&amp;Itemid=120 George Demidowicz, ''Ridge and Furrow Survey (King's Norton)'', Birmingham and Warwickshire Archaeological Society, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eyre/&gt;

In most places ploughing continued over the centuries, and later methods (especially the [[Plough#Reversible_plough|reversible plough]]) removed the ridge and furrow pattern.  However, in some cases the land became grassland, and where this has not been ploughed since, the pattern has often been preserved.  Surviving ridge and furrow may have a height difference of {{Convert|18|to|24|in|m|abbr=on|1}} in places, and gives a strongly rippled effect to the landscape.  When in active use, the height difference was even more, over {{convert|6|ft|m}} in places.&lt;ref name=Eyre&gt;[http://www.bahs.org.uk/AGHR/ARTICLES/03n2a2.pdf Eyre,  S R.

&lt;/div&gt;

==Curved strips==
In the early Middle Ages ploughing was done with large teams of small [[ox]]en (commonly eight oxen in four pairs), and the plough itself was a large, mainly wooden implement.  The team and plough together were therefore many yards long, and this led to a particular effect in ridge and furrow fields.  When reaching the end of the furrow, the leading oxen met the end first, and were turned left along the headland, while the plough continued as long as possible in the furrow (the strongest oxen were [[yoke]]d at the back, and could draw the plough on their own for this short distance).  By the time the plough eventually reached the end, the oxen were standing lined up facing leftwards along the headland.  Each pair was then turned around to walk rightwards along the headland, crossing the end of the strip, and they then started down the opposite furrow.  By the time the plough itself reached the beginning of the furrow, the oxen were already lined up ready to pull it forwards.

The result of this was to twist the end of each furrow slightly to the left, making these earlier ridge and furrows into a slight reverse-S shape.&lt;ref name=Eyre/&gt;  This shape survives in some places as curved field boundaries, even where the ridge and furrow pattern itself has vanished.

If the oxen had been turned right at the end of the furrow, they would immediately have had to turn right again down the returning furrow, making the line of oxen cut across the top of the ploughed strip and thus pulling the plough out of the ground before it reached the end of the furrow, as well as having potential difficulty from two adjacent lines of oxen moving in opposite directions.  Alternatively, if lined up rightwards along the headland, some would already be past the beginning of the new furrow, and these would have to be moved awkwardly sideways into the furrow to be ready to plough.  Turning to the left made one turn at a time and avoided a sideways move.

As oxen became larger and ploughs more efficient, smaller teams were needed.  These took less room on the headland, and straight ploughing became easier – and easier still when [[Draft horse|heavy horses]] were introduced.  Late Middle Ages ridge and furrow is therefore straight.

==Surviving locations==
[[File:Blackhillrig1.jpg|thumb| Rig and furrow at Roughrig reservoir, near Airdrie, Scotland]]
Some of the best-preserved ridge and furrow survives in the [[English counties]] of:
* [[Buckinghamshire]]
* [[Cambridgeshire]]
* [[County Durham]]
* [[Derbyshire]]
* [[Gloucestershire]]
* [[Lincolnshire]]
* [[Leicestershire]]
* [[Northamptonshire]]
* [[Nottinghamshire]]
* [[Oxfordshire]]
* [[Warwickshire]]
* [[West Yorkshire]]

In Scotland, 4-600 acres of rig and furrow survive in one area outside the town of Airdrie.

Ridge and furrow often survives on higher ground where the arable land was subsequently turned over to [[Sheep husbandry|sheep walk]] in the 15th century and has never been ploughed out since by modern ploughing methods, today surviving still as pasture and grazing for sheep where the effect is clearly visible, especially when the sun is low or after a dusting of snow. It is often associated with [[deserted medieval village]]s.

'''Selsey''' is a seaside town and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]], about eight miles (12&amp;nbsp;km) south of [[Chichester]] in [[West Sussex]], England. Selsey lies at the southernmost point of the [[Manhood Peninsula]], almost cut off from mainland [[Sussex]] by the sea. It is bounded to the west by Bracklesham Bay, to the north by Broad Rife (''rife''&lt;ref name=parish96&gt;Parish. A Dictionary of the Sussex Dialect. pp. 96-97&lt;/ref&gt; being the local word for stream or creek), to the east by Pagham Harbour and terminates in the south at [[Selsey Bill]]. There are significant rock formations beneath the sea off both of its coasts, named the Owers rocks and Mixon rocks. Coastal erosion has been an ever-present problem for Selsey.&lt;ref name=scopac1&gt;SCOPAC. [https://www.webcitation.org/6N9kfFwoJ?url=http://www.scopac.org.uk/scopac_sedimentdb/epag/epag.htm ''Sedimentary Study from East Head to Pagham.'']  Section 1.1.
  - The Standing Conference on Problems Associated with the Coastline (SCOPAC) was established in 1986 and consists of local authorities, the Environment agency and others. ''Archaeological evidence demonstrates that the coastline was some 2 to 3km seawards of where it is now at about 5,000 years''. Retrieved 5 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The B2145 is the only road in and out of the town crossing a bridge over the water inlet at Pagham Harbour at a point known as "the ferry". At one time Selsey was  inaccessible at flood tide, and a boat was stationed at the ferry to take horses and passengers to and from Sidlesham.&lt;ref name="horsfield35"&gt;Horsfield. History and Antiquities Vol II p.35.''A man and horse paid twopence; a foot passenger one halfpenny. The farmers and renters paid annually a certain portion of corn..''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Placename==
According to [[Bede]] the name  ''Selsey'' is derived from the Saxon ''Seals-ey'' and can be interpreted as ''the Isle of Sea Calves'' (sea calves are better known as seals).&lt;ref&gt;Bede. p.227&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Heron-Allen]] identified at least twenty different spellings of the place that we now know today as ''Selsey''.&lt;ref name=allen6&gt;Heron-Allen.Selsey Historic. pp.6 - 7&lt;/ref&gt;

A selection of versions as identified by Heron-Allen are:

*''Seoles'' - Old English
*''Seleisi'' - [[Domesday Book]] 1086
*''Celesye'' - Assize Roll 1279

==History==

The earliest evidence of human habitation in the Selsey area goes back to the stone age.&lt;ref&gt;Heron-Allen p.72.&lt;/ref&gt; Various stone implements have been found which date to the [[Palaeolithic]] period.&lt;ref&gt;''Heron-Allen''. Plate XI&lt;/ref&gt; People have been living in the area ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Heron-Allen p.73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mee6"&gt;Mee. pp.5 - 6. The early beginnings of Selsey.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Selsey frag.jpg|thumb|left| 200px|Picture of Anglo-Saxon gold fragments found on Selsey beach&lt;ref name="fragments"&gt;British Museum catalogue and description.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

It is believed that, in the [[Iron Age]], the [[Atrebates]] (one of the [[Belgae]] tribes) built a city at Selsey, similar in status to the pre-Roman urban centre ( ''[[oppidum]]'') at [[Hengistbury Head]] near [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]].&lt;ref name="mee6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roman Sussex-Chichester and the Chilgrove Valley. Alec Down.p.52.''The main oppidum of this shrunken kingdom was probably at Selsey&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;History files. The Tribe of the Atrebates.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;English Heritage. National Monuments Record.&lt;/ref&gt; So far there is no archaeological evidence to confirm this, although some have speculated that the ''old city'' that [[William Camden|Camden]] refers to is, indeed the old Belgae settlement and was located at the Mixon rocks, now south of Selsey Bill.&lt;ref name="cam228"&gt;Cambden. Britannia. p.228. ''At low water there are obscure Remains of that ancient little City where those Bishops resided''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tepns33_76&gt;Richardson. ''The Owers'', p.76. ''If, as seems almost certain, The Mixon is the site of 'the old city' perhaps [[Cymenes ora]] itself...&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chart"&gt;Admiralty Chart 2045 - This chart provides details of the coastal waters around Selsey Bill&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been various finds of silver and gold coins in the Selsey area.&lt;ref&gt;Mee. ''A History of Selsey'', Chapter 2 - The author lists various finds and provides illustrations of the coins found&lt;/ref&gt; Gold coins from the Atrebates rulers named [[Commius]], [[Tincommius]], [[Verica]], [[Eppillus]], and [[Cunobelin]]  were found on the beach in 1877, it is thought that these coins would have been minted locally.&lt;ref name=allen2&gt;Heron-Allen. ''Selsey Historic and Prehistoric'' . Chapter XXI&amp;nbsp;— Description and pictures of coins found.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BMcoins&gt;British Museum Catalogue of pre-Roman coins at Selsey&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient British coins would have been superseded by Roman coins and there have been finds of them too.&lt;ref name=allen2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BMcoins /&gt; In addition, some Anglo-Saxon gold fragments were found on the beach between Selsey and Bognor, these were dated as late  6th/ 8th century and what made them particularly interesting is that they had a [[runic]] inscription on them, the fragments were handed over to the British Museum.&lt;ref name="fragments" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hines. p.448 ''Two bits of gold found on the beach between Selsey and Bognor..''
&lt;/ref&gt;

Selsey was the capital of the [[Kingdom of Sussex]], possibly founded by [[Ælle of Sussex|Ælle]]. [[Wilfrid]] arrived circa 680 and converted the kingdom to Christianity, as recorded by the Venerable [[Bede]].&lt;ref&gt;Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People''. ch.13&lt;/ref&gt; [[Selsey Abbey]] stood at Selsey (probably where [[St Wilfrid's Chapel, Church Norton|Church Norton]] is today),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41746&amp;strquery=church+norton |title=Selsey |editor=L.F.

''History and Antiquities'' Vol II. p.20. ... all cathedral churches should be removed from villages to cities.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Domesday Book ''Selesie'' is mentioned under the [[hundred (country subdivision)|hundred]] of ''Somerley'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opendomesday.org/hundred/somerley/|title=Open Domesday: Hundred: Somerley|last=Powell-Smith|first=Anna|publisher= Anna Powell-Smith|accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''"The Bishop(of Chichester) holds Selesie in domain.&lt;ref name="allen132"&gt;Heron-Allen. Selsey Bill Historic and Prehistoric. p.132. ''That is to say that the Bishop of selsey(or Chichester) holds Selsey in his own hands, or as his own domain. He holds some of his lands in "demesne" for his own use, and lets out parts of it to tenants..&lt;/ref&gt; In the time of King Edward it was rated at ten [[Hide (unit)|hides]],  and so it continues. The [[Arable land|arable]] is seven plough lands.&lt;ref name="allen132"/&gt; There are two ploughs in the [[demesne]], and fourteen villains with eleven [[Indentured servant|bondsmen]] have five ploughs.".&lt;ref name="allen132"/&gt;''&lt;ref name="hors35"&gt;Horsfied. ''History and Antiquities'' Vol II P.35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horspool. Alfred. p.102. A hide is a bit like a form of tax, it is the amount of men required to maintain and defend an area for the King. The Burghal Hideage defines the measurement as one hide would be equivalent to one man. The hidage explains ''for the maintenance and defence of an acres breadth of wall sixteen hides are required''&lt;/ref&gt;

The manor of Selsey remained in the Bishop of Chichesters hands until 1561, when it was taken over by the crown.&lt;ref name="hors35" /&gt;

In 1647, a fatality was recorded following a [[cricket]] match at Selsey when a fielder called Henry Brand was hit on the head by the batsman Thomas Latter, who was trying to [[hit the ball twice|hit the ball a second time]]. The incident repeated one at [[Horsted Keynes]] in 1624. Thomas Latter may have been a relative of Richard Latter, one of the defendants in a cricket-related case at nearby [[Sidlesham]] in 1611.&lt;ref&gt;McCann, p. xxxix.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/main.html |title=From Lads to Lord's; The History of Cricket: 1300 – 1787 |publisher=Stumpsite |first=John |last=Leach |date=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629134518/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/main.html |archivedate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the centuries that Selsey has derived an income from the sea, one of the enterprises was [[smuggling]].&lt;ref name="ch7"&gt;Mee. Ch.7 the author explains the various ways the sea has been important to Selsey. Including wrecks, wrecking and smuggling&lt;/ref&gt; In the eighteenth century Selsey Bill was very much more isolated than it is today, and the sand spit extended farther out to sea. There was only the causeway connected to the mainland and that was covered at high tide.&lt;ref name="horsfield35" /&gt; The approach of the local [[riding officer]] would have been conspicuous in the extreme.&lt;ref name="smugglersbritain"&gt;Smugglers Britain. Description of Selsey Bill and smuggling activities&lt;/ref&gt; The Rectors of Selsey reputedly claimed a tithe on all kegs landed there, and stories also tell of a passageway leading from the Old Rectory (at Church Norton) to the remains of a [[Motte and bailey|Mound]], thought to have been built by the Normans.&lt;ref&gt;SAC. Volume 119. p.221 - talking about the Mound''.. the earthworks were probably constructed in the Norman period and probably soon after 1066..''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mee.p38. There is even a tradition in Selsey that some of the Rectors used to take a 'tythe of kegs'..&lt;/ref&gt; The course of the tunnel was marked by a depression on the surface of the ground as late as 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Heron-Allen p.195. The author speculates that the gullys were built as  part of the Armada defences.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SAC Vol 119. pp.218 -219. Plan of the mound&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1720s one Selsey man ran a regular ferry service to France, traveling back and forth every five weeks, and other prominent Selsey figures made considerable fortunes just from part-time work in the free-trade.&lt;ref name="smugglersbritain"/&gt;

Landings were not confined to Selsey itself: in a single run in 1743 2,000&amp;nbsp;lbs of tea were brought inland at [[West Wittering]] some six miles (10&amp;nbsp;km) away.&lt;ref name="smugglersbritain"/&gt;
[[File:Selsey Tramway 1.jpg|thumb|Selsey Tramway Satirical Postcard circa 1907]]
In 1749 fourteen smugglers, members of the notorious [[Hawkhurst Gang]], were accused of the murder of  Mr. William Galley, a custom-house officer, and Daniel Chater, a shoemaker.&lt;ref&gt;Smugglers and Smuggling. The book provides a narrative on the offence, capture, trial and execution of the smugglers involved.&lt;/ref&gt; Seven were tried and condemned to death at Chichester [[Assizes (England and Wales)|assizes]]; one died in gaol before sentence could be carried out and the other six were hanged at the Broyle north of Chichester.&lt;ref name="platt152"&gt;Platt. Smuggling in the British Isles: A History. pp.152-153&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the bodies of two of the smugglers, John Cobby and John Hammond, were hung in [[gibbets]] at Selsey Bill so that they could be seen at great distance from east and west.&lt;ref&gt;Smugglers and Smuggling. p.124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heron-Allen.'' Historic and Prehistoric''. p.309. and copy of tithe map. The Author says that it is not clear where the gibbets would have stood, but in an old tithe map, there was a ''Gibbet Field'' and he feels that this would have been the most likely place. The field was immediately adjacent to Selsey Bill.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 19th century, Selsey opened its first school. In 1818 premises were granted to the Rector and churchwardens of Selsey which were "on trust to permit the premises to be used for a schoolhouse or free school, for the gratuitous education of such poor children belonging to the Parish of Selsey as the said trustees or successors may think proper."&lt;ref&gt;Mee. p.75&lt;/ref&gt; The school was eventually taken over by the local authority in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Mee. p.80&lt;/ref&gt;

Selsey was connected to Chichester from 1897 to 1935 by a rail link initially called the Hundred of Manhood and Selsey Tramway and later the West Sussex Railway. The light railway rolling stock was all second hand and not very reliable and the journey times lengthy. Various nicknames such as the "Selsey Snail" were attributed to the tram and comic postcards were issued reflecting its poor service.&lt;ref&gt;Mee. pp.84-96. Information on the railway.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sharia''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|ə|ˈ|r|iː|ə}}), '''Sharia law''', or '''Islamic law''' ({{lang-ar|{{large|شريعة}}}} {{IPA-ar|ʃaˈriːʕa|}}) is a [[religious law]] forming part of the [[Islam]]ic tradition.&lt;ref name=oxforddic&gt;{{cite web |title=British &amp; World English: sharia |url=https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/sharia |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=4 December 2015 |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from the religious precepts of Islam, particularly the [[Quran]] and the [[Hadith]]. In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the term ''sharīʿah'' refers to [[God in Islam|God]]'s immutable [[divine law]] and is contrasted with ''[[fiqh]]'', which refers to its human scholarly interpretations.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Calder|2009}} It has been described as "one of the major intellectual achievements of Islam"&lt;ref name="Lewis-ME-223"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Bernard|title=The Middle East, a brief history of the last 2000 years|date=1995|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=NY|isbn=978-0684832807|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its importance in Islam has been compared to that of [[theology]] in [[Christianity]].{{refn|group=note|"What theology is for the Christian, law is for the Muslim."&lt;ref name="Smith-1957-57"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=W|title=Islam in Modern History|date=1957|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; referenced in &lt;ref name="Forte-1978-2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forte|first1=David F.|title=Islamic Law; the impact of Joseph Schacht|journal=Loyola Los Angeles International and Comparative Law Review|date=1978|volume=1|page=2|url=http://www.soerenkern.com/pdfs/islam/IslamicLawTheImpactofJosephSchacht.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The manner of its application in modern times has been a subject of dispute between Muslim traditionalists and reformists.&lt;ref name=oxforddic/&gt;

Traditional [[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence|theory of Islamic jurisprudence]] recognizes four [[sources of sharia]]: the Quran, ''[[sunnah]]'' (authentic hadith), ''[[qiyas]]'' (analogical reasoning), and ''[[ijma]]'' (juridical consensus).&lt;ref name="Esposito, John 2001"&gt;[[John Esposito|John L. Esposito]], [[Natana J. DeLong-Bas]] (2001), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=MOmaDq8HKCgC&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Women in Muslim family law]'', p. 2. [[Syracuse University Press]], {{ISBN|978-0815629085}}. Quote: "[...], by the ninth century, the classical theory of law fixed the sources of Islamic law at four: the ''Quran'', the ''Sunnah'' of the Prophet, ''qiyas'' (analogical reasoning), and ''ijma'' (consensus)."&lt;/ref&gt; Different [[Madhhab|legal schools]]—of which the most prominent are [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanbali]] and [[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Jafari]]—developed methodologies for deriving sharia rulings from scriptural sources using a process known as ''[[ijtihad]]''.&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Islamic Law |editor=John L. Esposito |encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2014 |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/print/opr/t125/e1107}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}  [[Fiqh|Traditional jurisprudence]] distinguishes two principal branches of law, ''[[Ibadah|ʿibādāt]]'' (rituals) and ''[[Muamalat|muʿāmalāt]]'' (social relations), which together comprise a wide range of topics.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;{{sfn|Calder|2009}} Its rulings assign actions to one of [[Ahkam|five categories]]: [[Fard|mandatory]], [[Mustahabb|recommended]], [[Mubah|neutral]], [[Makruh|abhorred]], and [[Haram|prohibited]].&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Calder|2009}} Thus, some areas of sharia overlap with the Western notion of law while others correspond more broadly to living life in accordance with God’s will.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}

Historically, sharia was interpreted by independent jurists ([[mufti]]s). Their legal opinions ([[fatwa]]s) were taken into account by ruler-appointed [[Qadi|judges]] who presided over ''[[qāḍī]]'s'' courts, and by ''maẓālim'' courts, which were controlled by the ruler's council and administered criminal law.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Calder|2009}} [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman rulers]] achieved additional control over the legal system by promulgating their own legal code (''[[Qanun (law)|qanun]]'') and turning muftis into state employees.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} Non-Muslim ([[dhimmi]]) communities had legal autonomy, except in cases of interconfessional disputes, which fell under jurisdiction of qadi's courts.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}

In the modern era, sharia-based criminal laws have been widely replaced by statutes inspired by European models.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Otto|2008|p=19}} Judicial procedures and legal education in the Muslim world were likewise brought in line with European practice.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} While the constitutions of most Muslim-majority states contain references to sharia, its classical rules were largely retained only in [[Status (law)|personal status]] (family) laws.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} Legislative bodies which codified these laws sought to modernize them without abandoning their foundations in traditional jurisprudence.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Mayer|2009}} The [[Islamic revival]] of the late 20th century brought along calls by [[Islamist]] movements for full implementation of sharia, including reinstatement of ''[[hudud]]'' corporal punishments, such as [[stoning]].{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Mayer|2009}} In some cases, this resulted in traditionalist legal reform,{{refn|group=note|While the advocacy of ''hudud'' punishments has gained symbolic importance, and in theory often involved rejection of the stringent traditional restrictions on their application, in practice, in those few countries where they have been reintroduced, they have often been used sparingly or not at all. Their application has varied depending on local political climate.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Otto|2008|p=20}}}} while other countries witnessed juridical reinterpretation of sharia advocated by progressive reformers.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Mayer|2009}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009}}

The role of sharia has become a contested topic around the world. Attempts to impose it on non-Muslims have caused [[Religious violence in Nigeria|intercommunal violence in Nigeria]]&lt;ref&gt;Staff (January 3, 2003).

==Etymology and usage==

=== Contemporary usage ===

The word ''sharīʿah'' is used by Arabic-speaking peoples of the Middle East to designate a prophetic religion in its totality.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=321}} For example, ''sharīʿat Mūsā'' means law or religion of Moses and ''sharīʿatu-nā'' can mean "our religion" in reference to any monotheistic faith.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=321}} Within Islamic discourse, ''šarīʿah'' refers to religious regulations governing the lives of Muslims.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=321}} For many Muslims, the word merely means "justice," and they will consider any law that promotes justice and social welfare to conform to sharia.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}

Jan Michiel Otto distinguishes four senses conveyed by the term ''sharia'' in religious, legal and political discourse:{{sfn|Otto|2008|pp=9–10}}
* ''Divine, abstract sharia'': God's plan for mankind and the norms of behavior which should guide the Islamic community. Muslims of different perspectives agree in their respect for the abstract notion of sharia, but they differ in how they understand the practical implications of the term.
* ''Classical sharia'': the body of rules and principles elaborated by Islamic jurists during the first centuries of Islam.
* ''Historical sharia(s)'': the body of rules and interpretations developed throughout Islamic history, ranging from personal beliefs to state legislation and varying across an ideological spectrum. Classical sharia has often served as a point of reference for these variants, but they have also reflected the influences of their time and place.
* ''Contemporary sharia(s)'': the full spectrum of rules and interpretations that are developed and practiced at present.

A related term ''{{transl|ar|DIN|al-qānūn al-islāmī}}'' ({{lang|ar|{{large|القانون الإسلامي}}}}, Islamic law), which was borrowed from European usage in the late 19th century, is used in the Muslim world to refer to a legal system in the context of a modern state.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=323}}

=== Etymology ===

The primary range of meanings of the Arabic word ''šarīʿah'', derived from the root ''š-r-ʕ'', is related to religion and religious law.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=321}} The lexicographical tradition records two major areas of use where the word ''šarīʿah'' can appear without religious connotation.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=326}} In texts evoking a pastoral or nomadic environment, the word, and its derivatives refer to watering animals at a permanent water-hole or to the seashore, with special reference to animals who come there.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=326}} Another area of use relates to notions of stretched or lengthy.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=326}} This range of meanings is cognate with the Hebrew ''saraʿ'' and is likely to be the origin of the meaning "way" or "path".{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=326}} Both these areas have been claimed to have Within rise to aspects of the religious meaning.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=326}}

Some scholars describe the word ''šarīʿah'' as an archaic [[Arabic]] word denoting "pathway to be followed" (analogous to the Hebrew term [[Halakha]]h ["The Way to Go"]),&lt;ref name=haqq&gt;Abdal-Haqq, Irshad (2006). ''Understanding Islamic Law&amp;nbsp;– From Classical to Contemporary'' (edited by Aminah Beverly McCloud). Chapter 1 ''Islamic Law&amp;nbsp;– An Overview of its Origin and Elements''. [[AltaMira Press]]. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; or "path to the water hole"&lt;ref name="Hashim1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hashim Kamali |first1=Mohammad |authorlink=Mohammad Hashim Kamali |title=Shari'ah Law: An Introduction |date=2008 |publisher=[[Oneworld Publications]] |isbn=978-1851685653 |pages=2, 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=weiss1998/&gt; and argue that its adoption as a metaphor for a divinely ordained way of life arises from the importance of water in an arid desert environment.&lt;ref name=weiss1998&gt;Weiss, Bernard G. (1998). ''The Spirit of Islamic Law''. Athens, Georgia: [[University of Georgia Press]]. p. 17. {{ISBN|978-0820319773}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use in religious texts ===

In the Quran, ''šarīʿah'' and its cognate ''širʿah'' occur once each, with the meaning "way" or "path".{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=321}} The word ''šarīʿah'' was widely used by Arabic-speaking Jews during the Middle Ages, being the most common translation for the word ''torah'' in the 10th-century Arabic Old Testament known as Saʿadya Gaon.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=321}} A similar use of the term can be found in Christian writers.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=321}} The Arabic expression ''Sharīʿat Allāh'' (&lt;span lang="ar" dir="ltr"&gt;شريعة الله&lt;/span&gt; "God’s Law") is a common translation for תורת אלוהים (‘God’s Law’ in Hebrew) and νόμος τοῦ θεοῦ (‘God’s Law’ in Greek in the New Testament [Rom. 7: 22]).&lt;ref&gt;Ullmann, M. (2002), Wörterbuch der griechisch-arabischen Übersetzungen des neunten Jahrhunderts, Wiesbaden, p. 437. Rom. 7: 22: ‘συνήδομαι γὰρ τῷ νόμῳ τοῦ θεοῦ’ is translated as ‘أني أفرح بشريعة الله’&lt;/ref&gt; In Muslim literature, ''šarīʿah'' designates the laws or message of a prophet or God, in contrast to ''[[fiqh]]'', which refers to a scholar's interpretation thereof.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=322}}

==Historical origins==
{{Further|Fiqh|Madhhab|Ahl al-Hadith}}

[[File:Ibnhanbal.jpg|thumb|Juristic exchange between [[Abu Dawood]] and [[Ibn Hanbal]]. One of the oldest literary manuscripts of the Islamic world, dated October 879.]]

According to the traditional Muslim view, there was no "historical development" of Islamic law and its major precepts were all known and passed down directly from the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="Forte-1978-8"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forte|first1=David F.|title=Islamic Law; the impact of Joseph Schacht| journal=Loyola Los Angeles International and Comparative Law Review|date=1978|volume=1|page=8|url=http://www.soerenkern.com/pdfs/islam/IslamicLawTheImpactofJosephSchacht.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of Islamic jurisprudence (''fiqh'') also goes back to the lifetime of Muhammad.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Calder|2009}} In this view, his [[Sahaba|companions]] and followers took what he did and approved of as a model ([[sunnah]]) and transmitted this information to the succeeding generations in the form of [[hadith]].{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Calder|2009}} These reports led first to informal discussion and then systematic legal thought, articulated with greatest success in the eighth and ninth centuries by the master jurists [[Abu Hanifah]], [[Malik ibn Anas]], [[Al-Shafi‘i]], and [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]], who are viewed as the founders of the [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafiʿi]], and [[Hanbali]] legal schools (''[[madhhab]]s'') of Sunni jurisprudence.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}

Modern historians have presented alternative theories of the formation of fiqh.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Calder|2009}} At first Western scholars accepted the general outlines of the traditional account.{{sfn|Jokisch|2015}} In the late 19th century, an influential [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] hypothesis was advanced by [[Ignac Goldziher]] and elaborated by [[Joseph Schacht]] in the mid-20th century.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} Schacht and other scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown |first1=Daniel W.|title=Rethinking tradition in modern Islamic thought |date=1996 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521570770 |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/116836545/Rethinking-Traditions-in-Modern-Islamic-Thought-Daniel-w-Brown |accessdate=10 May 2018 |ref=DWBRTMIT1996 |pages=18–24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the local practices of early Muslim communities (which Schacht calls the `living tradition` of the `ancient schools of law`) and earliest efforts at Islamic jurisprudence{{refn|group=note|“... the essential features of old Muhammadan jurisprudence, such as the idea of the `living tradition` of the ancient schools of law; a body of common doctrine expressing the earliest effort to systematize;  legal maxims which often reflect a slightly later stage, and an important nucleus of legal traditions ... it is safe to say that [this] Muhammadan legal science started in the later part of the Umaiyad period, taking the legal practice of the time as its raw material and endorsing, modifying, or rejecting it, ...” ,&lt;ref name=Schacht-OoMJ-1959-190&gt;{{cite book |title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence |last1=Schacht |first=Joseph |publisher=Oxford University Press |orig-year= 1950 |year= 1959 |page=190 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} were based on a variety of sources, not just the ahadith of Muhammad.{{refn|group=note|“In the time of Shafi’i, traditions from the Prophet were already recognized as one of the material bases of Muhammadan law. Their position in the ancient schools of law was, as we have seen, much less certain.”&lt;ref name=Schacht-OoMJ-1959-40&gt;{{cite book |title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence |last1=Schacht |first=Joseph |publisher=Oxford University Press |origyear= 1950 |year= 1959 |page=40  }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} {{refn|group=note|another example is that an early major works of fiqh — [[Muwatta Imam Malik]] (edited by Shaibani) — contains 429 ahadith by Muhammad but  750 by the [[Sahabah|Companions]], [[Tabi‘un|Successors]] and others,&lt;ref name=Schacht-OoMJ-1959-22&gt;{{cite book |title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence |last1=Schacht |first=Joseph |publisher=Oxford University Press |orig-year= 1950 |year= 1959 |page=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to later works by al-Bukhari, Muslim, etc. that contain only ahadith by Muhammad}}
Furthermore, most hadith and their [[Hadith studies#Sanad and matn|chains of transmission]] were actually created at a later date {{refn|group=note|”a great many traditions in the classical and other collections were put into circulation only after Shafi'i's time;
the first considerable body of legal traditions from the Prophet originated towards the middle of the second century, …”&lt;ref name=Schacht-OoMJ-1959-4&gt;{{cite book |title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence |last1=Schacht |first=Joseph |publisher=Oxford University Press |origyear= 1950 |year= 1959 |page=4  }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
and extended back to Muhammad's companions (despite the efforts of hadith scholars to uncover fabricated isnads), when it became accepted that legal norms must be formally grounded in scriptural sources.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} In his view, the real architect of Islamic jurisprudence was al-Shafi'i, who formulated this and other elements of classical legal theory in his work ''[[Al-Risala (Al-Shafi‘i)|al-risala]]'',{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Jokisch|2015}} but who was preceded by a body of Islamic law not based on primacy of ahadith of  Muhammad. (Muhammad died in 632 CE while Al-Shafi’i began to establish an independent line of legal speculation in 810.) These accounts gave rise to objections, and modern historians generally adopt more cautious, intermediate positions.{{sfn|Jokisch|2015}}

While the origin of hadith remains a subject of scholarly controversy, it is generally accepted that early Islamic jurisprudence developed out of a combination of administrative and popular practices shaped by the religious and ethical precepts of Islam.{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}}{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} It continued some aspects of pre-Islamic laws and customs of the lands that fell under Muslim rule in the aftermath of the [[Early Muslim conquests|early conquests]] and modified other aspects, aiming to meet the practical need of establishing Islamic norms of behavior and adjudicating disputes arising in the early Muslim communities.{{sfn|Lapidus|2014|p=125}} Juristic thought gradually developed in study circles, where independent scholars met to learn from a local master and discuss religious topics.{{sfn|Lapidus|2014|p=125}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=31–35}} At first, these circles were fluid in their membership, but with time distinct regional legal schools crystallized around shared sets of methodological principles.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=31–35}}{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} As the boundaries of the schools became clearly delineated, the authority of their doctrinal tenets came to be vested in a master jurist from earlier times, who was henceforth identified as the school's founder.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=31–35}}{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} In the course of the first three centuries of Islam, all legal schools came to accept the broad outlines of classical legal theory, according to which Islamic law had to be firmly rooted in the Quran and hadith.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Lapidus|2014|p=130}}

== Traditional jurisprudence (''fiqh'') ==

{{Main|Fiqh}}

Fiqh is traditionally divided into the fields of ''[[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence|uṣūl al-fiqh]]'' (lit. the roots of fiqh), which studies the theoretical principles of jurisprudence, and ''furūʿ al-fiqh'' (lit. the branches of fiqh), which is devoted to elaboration of rulings on the basis of these principles.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Schneider|2014}}

=== Principles of jurisprudence (''uṣūl al-fiqh'') ===

{{Main|Principles of Islamic jurisprudence}}

Classical jurists held that human reason is a gift from God which should be exercised to its fullest capacity.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|p=15}} However, they believed that use of reason alone is insufficient to distinguish right from wrong, and that rational argumentation must draw its content from the body of transcendental knowledge revealed in the Quran and through the sunnah of Muhammad.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|p=15}}

Traditional theory of Islamic jurisprudence elaborates how scriptures should be interpreted from the standpoint of linguistics and rhetoric.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} It also comprises methods for establishing authenticity of hadith and for determining when the legal force of a scriptural passage is [[Naskh (tafsir)|abrogated]] by a passage revealed at a later date.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} In addition to the Quran and sunnah, the classical theory of Sunni fiqh recognizes two other sources of law: juristic consensus (''[[Ijma|ijmaʿ]]'') and analogical reasoning (''[[qiyas]]'').{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}} It therefore studies the application and limits of analogy, as well as the value and limits of consensus, along with other methodological principles, some of which are accepted by only certain legal schools.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} This interpretive apparatus is brought together under the rubric of [[ijtihad]], which refers to a jurist's exertion in an attempt to arrive at a ruling on a particular question.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} The theory of [[Twelver Shia]] jurisprudence parallels that of Sunni schools with some differences, such as recognition of reason (''[['Aql|ʿaql]]'') as a source of law in place of ''qiyas'' and extension of the notion of sunnah to include traditions of the [[The Twelve Imams|imams]].{{sfn|Kamali|1999|pp=121–22}}

* ''[[Quran]]'': In Islam, the Quran is considered to be the most sacred source of law.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16–18}} Classical jurists held its textual integrity to be beyond doubt on account of it having been handed down by many people in each generation, which is known as "recurrence" or "concurrent transmission" (''tawātur'').{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16–18}} Only several hundred verses of the Quran have direct legal relevance, and they are concentrated in a few specific areas such as inheritance, though other passages have been used as a source for general principles whose legal ramifications were elaborated by other means.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16–18}}
* ''[[Hadith]]'': The body of hadith provides more detailed and practical legal guidance, but it was recognized early on that not all of them were authentic.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16–18}} Early Islamic scholars developed a methodology for evaluating their authenticity by assessing trustworthiness of the individuals listed in their transmission chains.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16–18}} These criteria narrowed down the vast corpus of prophetic traditions to several thousand "sound" hadiths, which were collected in several canonical compilations.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16–18}} The hadiths which enjoyed concurrent transmission were deemed unquestionably authentic; however, the vast majority of hadiths were handed down by only one or a few transmitters and were therefore seen to yield only probable knowledge.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16-18}}{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}} The uncertainty was further compounded by ambiguity of the language contained in some hadiths and Quranic passages.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16–18}} Disagreements on the relative merits and interpretation of the textual sources allowed legal scholars considerable leeway in formulating alternative rulings.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}
* ''Consensus ([[ijma]])'' could in principle elevate a ruling based on probable evidence to absolute certainty.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=21–22}}{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} This classical doctrine drew its authority from a series of hadiths stating that the Islamic community could never agree on an error.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=21–22}} This form of consensus was technically defined as agreement of all competent jurists in any particular generation, acting as representatives of the community.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=21–22}}{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Kamali|1999|p=146}} However, the practical difficulty of obtaining and ascertaining such an agreement meant that it had little impact on legal development.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=21–22}}{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} A more pragmatic form of consensus, which could be determined by consulting works of prominent jurists, was used to confirm a ruling so that it could not be reopened for further discussion.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} The cases for which there was a consensus account for less than 1 percent of the body of classical jurisprudence.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=21–22}}
* ''Analogical reasoning ([[qiyas]])'': Qiyas is used to derive a ruling for a situation not addressed in the scripture by analogy with a scripturally based rule.{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}} In a classic example, the Quranic prohibition of drinking wine is extended to all intoxicating substances, on the basis of the "cause"  (''ʿilla'') shared by these situations, which in this case is identified to be intoxication.{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}} Since the cause of a rule may not be apparent, its selection commonly occasioned controversy and extensive debate.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=23–24}} Twelver Shia jurisprudence does not recognize the use of qiyas, but relies on reason (''ʿaql'') in its place.{{sfn|Schneider|2014}}

==== Ijtihad ====

{{Main|Ijtihad}}

[[File:Türkischer Mufti.jpg|thumb|Turkish mufti (17th-century Spanish drawing)]]

The classical process of ijtihad combined these generally recognized principles with other methods, which were not adopted by all legal schools, such as ''[[istihsan]]'' (juristic preference), ''[[istislah]]'' (consideration of public interest) and ''[[istishab]]'' (presumption of continuity).{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}} A jurist who is qualified to practice ijtihad is known as a ''mujtahid''.{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} The use of independent reasoning to arrive at a ruling is contrasted with ''[[taqlid]]'' (imitation), which refers to following the rulings of a mujtahid.{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} By the beginning of the 10th century, development of Sunni jurisprudence prompted leading jurists to state that the main legal questions had been addressed and the scope of ijtihad was gradually restricted.{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009c}} From the 18th century on, leading Muslim reformers began calling for abandonment of taqlid and renewed emphasis on ijtihad, which they saw as a return to the vitality of early Islamic jurisprudence.{{sfn|Rabb|2009c}}

==== Decision types (''aḥkām'') ====

{{Main|Ahkam}}

Sharia rulings fall into one of five categories known as “the five decisions” (''al-aḥkām al-khamsa''): [[Fard|mandatory]] (''farḍ'' or ''wājib''), [[Mustahabb|recommended]] (''mandūb'' or ''mustaḥabb''), [[Mubah|neutral]] (''mubāḥ''), [[Makruh|reprehensible]] (''makrūh''), and [[Haram|forbidden]] (''ḥarām'').{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Schneider|2014}} It is a sin or a crime to perform a forbidden action or not to perform a mandatory action.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} Reprehensible acts should be avoided, but they are not considered to be sinful or punishable in court.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|p=20}} Avoiding reprehensible acts and performing recommended acts is held to be subject of reward in the afterlife, while allowed actions entail no judgement from God.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|p=20}} Jurists disagree on whether the term ''[[Halal|ḥalāl]]'' covers the first three or the first four categories.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} The legal and moral verdict depends on whether the action is committed out of necessity (''ḍarūra'').{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}

==== Aims of sharia and public interest ====

{{Main|Maqasid|Maslaha}}

''Maqāṣid'' (aims or purposes) of sharia  and ''maṣlaḥa'' (welfare or public interest) are two related classical doctrines which have come to play an increasingly prominent role in modern times.{{sfn|Duderija|2014|pp=2–6}}{{sfn|Brown|2009}}{{sfn|Gleave|2012}} They were first clearly articulated by [[al-Ghazali]] (d. 1111), who argued that ''maslaha'' was God's general purpose in revealing the divine law, and that its specific aim was preservation of five essentials of human well-being: religion, life, intellect, offspring, and property.{{sfn|Opwis|2007|p=65}} Although most classical-era jurists recognized ''maslaha'' and ''maqasid'' as important legal principles, they held different views regarding the role they should play in Islamic law.{{sfn|Duderija|2014|pp=2–6}}{{sfn|Gleave|2012}} Some jurists viewed them as auxiliary rationales constrained by scriptural sources and analogical reasoning.{{sfn|Duderija|2014|pp=2–6}}{{sfn|Opwis|2007|pp=66–68}} Others regarded them as an independent source of law, whose general principles could override specific inferences based on the letter of scripture.{{sfn|Duderija|2014|pp=2–6}}{{sfn|Opwis|2007|pp=68–69}} While the latter view was held by a minority of classical jurists, in modern times it came to be championed in different forms by prominent scholars who sought to adapt Islamic law to changing social conditions by drawing on the intellectual heritage of traditional jurisprudence.{{sfn|Duderija|2014|pp=2–6}}{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}}{{sfn|Brown|2009}} These scholars expanded the inventory of ''maqasid'' to include such aims of sharia as reform and women's rights ([[Rashid Rida]]); justice and freedom ([[Mohammed al-Ghazali]]); and human dignity and rights ([[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]]).{{sfn|Duderija|2014|pp=2–6}}

===Branches of law===
{{Fiqh}}
{{Further|Topics of sharia law}}
The domain of ''furūʿ al-fiqh'' (lit. branches of fiqh) is traditionally divided into ''ʿibādāt'' (rituals or acts of worship) and ''muʿāmalāt'' (social relations).{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} Many jurists further divided the body of substantive jurisprudence into "the four quarters", called rituals, sales, marriage and injuries.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=28-30}} Each of these terms figuratively stood for a variety of subjects.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=28-30}} For example, the quarter of sales would encompass partnerships, guaranty, gifts, and bequests, among other topics.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=28-30}} Juristic works were arranged as a sequence of such smaller topics, each called a "book" (''kitab'').{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=28-30}} The special significance of ritual was marked by always placing its discussion at the start of the work.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=28-30}}

Some historians distinguish a field of Islamic criminal law, which combines several traditional categories.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009c}}{{sfn|Schneider|2014}} Several crimes with scripturally prescribed punishments are known as ''[[hudud]]''.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} Jurists developed various restrictions which in many cases made them virtually impossible to apply.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} Other crimes involving intentional bodily harm are judged according to a version of ''[[lex talionis]]'' that prescribes a punishment analogous to the crime (''[[qisas]]''), but the victims or their heirs may accept a monetary compensation (''[[Diya (Islam)|diya]]'') or pardon the perpetrator instead; only ''diya'' is imposed for non-intentional harm.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009c}} Other criminal cases belong to the category of ''[[Tazir|taʿzīr]]'', where the goal of punishment is correction or rehabilitation of the culprit and its form is largely left to the judge's discretion.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009c}} In practice, since early on in Islamic history, criminal cases were usually handled by ruler-administered courts or local police using procedures which were only loosely related to sharia.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009c}}

The two major genres of ''furūʿ'' literature are the ''mukhtasar'' (concise summary of law) and the ''mabsut'' (extensive commentary).{{sfn|Calder|2009}}  ''Mukhtasars'' were short specialized treatises or general overviews that could be used in a classroom or consulted by judges.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=10-11}} A ''mabsut'', which usually provided a commentary on a ''mukhtasar'' and could stretch to dozens of large volumes, recorded alternative rulings with their justifications, often accompanied by a proliferation of cases and conceptual distinctions.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=10-11}} The terminology of juristic literature was conservative and tended to preserve notions which had lost their practical relevance.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} At the same time, the cycle of abridgement and commentary allowed jurists of each generation to articulate a modified body of law to meet changing social conditions.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=10-11}} Other juristic genres include the ''qawāʿid'' (succinct formulas meant to aid the student remember general principles) and collections of fatwas by a particular scholar.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}

===Schools of law===
{{main article|Madhhab}}
[[File:Madhhab Map3.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Predominant madhhab by region of the Muslim world]]

The main Sunni schools of law (''madhhabs'') are the [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]] and [[Hanbali]] madhhabs.{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} They emerged in the ninth and tenth centuries and by the twelfth century almost all jurists aligned themselves with a particular madhhab.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} These four schools recognize each other's validity and they have interacted in legal debate over the centuries.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} Rulings of these schools are followed across the Muslim world without exclusive regional restrictions, but they each came to dominate in different parts of the world.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}}  For example, the Maliki school is predominant in North and West Africa; the Hanafi school in South and Central Asia; the Shafi'i school in Lower Egypt, East Africa, and Southeast Asia; and the Hanbali school in North and Central Arabia.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}}{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} The first centuries of Islam also witnessed a number of short-lived Sunni madhhabs.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} The [[Zahiri]] school, which is commonly identified as extinct, continues to exert influence over legal thought.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}}{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} The development of Shia legal schools occurred along the lines of theological differences and resulted in formation of the [[Twelver]], [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] and [[Ismaili]] madhhabs, whose differences from Sunni legal schools are roughly of the same order as the differences among Sunni schools.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} The [[Ibadi]] legal school, distinct from Sunni and Shia madhhabs, is predominant in Oman.{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}}

The transformations of Islamic legal institutions in the modern era have had profound implications for the madhhab system.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}}  Legal practice in most of the Muslim world has come to be controlled by government policy and state law, so that the influence of the madhhabs beyond personal ritual practice depends on the status accorded to them within the national legal system.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} State law codification commonly utilized the methods of ''takhayyur'' (selection of rulings without restriction to a particular madhhab) and ''talfiq'' (combining parts of different rulings on the same question).{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} Legal professionals trained in modern law schools have largely replaced traditional [[ulema]] as interpreters of the resulting laws.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} Global Islamic movements have at times drawn on different madhhabs and at other times placed greater focus on the scriptural sources rather than classical jurisprudence.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} The Hanbali school, with its particularly strict adherence to the Quran and hadith, has inspired conservative currents of direct scriptural interpretation by the [[Salafi]] and [[Wahhabi]] movements.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} Other currents, such as networks of Indonesian ulema and Islamic scholars residing in Muslim-minority countries, have advanced liberal interpretations of Islamic law without focusing on traditions of a particular madhhab.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}}

===Social context===
{{Islamism sidebar|Concepts}}

From the 9th century onward, the power to interpret law in traditional Islamic societies was in the hands of the scholars ([[ulema]]). This separation of powers served to limit the range of actions available to the ruler, who could not easily decree or reinterpret law independently and expect the continued support of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Basim Musallam |title=The Ordering of Muslims Societies |encyclopedia=The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World |editor=[[Francis Robinson]] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1996 |page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through succeeding centuries and empires, the balance between the ulema and the rulers shifted and reformed, but the balance of power was never decisively changed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marshall Hodgson]], ''[[The Venture of Islam]] Conscience and History in a World Civilization Vol 3''. [[University of Chicago]], 1958, pp. 105–08.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of many centuries, imperial, political and technological change, including the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution, ushered in an era of European world [[hegemony]] that gradually included the domination of many of the lands which had previously been ruled by Islamic empires.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marshall Hodgson]], ''The Venture of Islam Conscience and History in a World Civilization Vol 3''. [[University of Chicago]], 1958, pp. 176–77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Ansari, ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World edited by Francis Robinson''. [[Cambridge University Press]], 1996, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the Second World War, the European powers found themselves too weakened to maintain their empires as before.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marshall Hodgson]], ''The Venture of Islam Conscience and History in a World Civilization Vol 3''. [[University of Chicago]], 1958, pp. 366–67.&lt;/ref&gt; The wide variety of forms of government, systems of law, attitudes toward modernity and interpretations of sharia are a result of the ensuing drives for independence and modernity in the Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;Ansari, Sarah.

Most Muslim-majority countries incorporate sharia at some level in their legal framework, with many calling it the highest law or the source of law of the land in their constitution.&lt;ref name=tjmas&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfr.org/religion/islam-governing-under-sharia/p8034 |title=Islam: Governing under Sharia |first1=Toni |last1=Johnson |first2=Mohammed Aly |last2=Sergie |publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]] |date=July 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amanat &amp; Griffel (2007), ''Shari'a: Islamic Law in the Contemporary Context'', Stanford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0804756396}}{{page needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most use sharia for personal law (marriage, divorce, domestic violence, child support, family law, inheritance and such matters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schenker |first1=J G |title=Women's reproductive health: monotheistic religious perspectives |journal=International Journal of Gynecology &amp; Obstetrics |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=77–86 |year=2000 |pmid=10884536 |doi=10.1016/S0020-7292(00)00225-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Khadduri|Liebesny|1955|p={{page needed|date=April 2016}}}} Elements of sharia are present, to varying extents, in the criminal justice system of many Muslim-majority countries.&lt;ref name=nabiad/&gt; [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Yemen]], [[Brunei]], [[Qatar]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Sudan]] and [[Mauritania]] apply the code predominantly or entirely while it applies in some parts of [[Pakistan]] and [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name=nabiad&gt;Nisrine Abiad (2008), Sharia, Muslim States and International Human Rights Treaty Obligations, British Institute of International and Comparative Law, {{ISBN|978-1905221417}}{{Page needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Otto|2010|p=28}}

Since the 1970s, most Muslim-majority countries have faced vociferous demands from their religious groups and political parties for immediate adoption of sharia as the sole, or at least primary, legal framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Abdullahi Ahmed |last1=An-Na'im |title=Human Rights in the Muslim World: Socio-Political Conditions and Scriptural Imperatives |journal=Harvard Human Rights Journal |volume=3 |year=1990 |pages=13–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some moderates and liberal scholars within these Muslim-majority countries have argued for limited expansion of sharia.{{sfn|Otto|2010|pp=29–33}}

===Enforcement===
{{main article|Islamic religious police|Hisbah}}
Sharia is enforced in Muslim-majority nations in a number of ways, including ''mutaween'' (police enforcement) and ''hisbah''. [[mutaween]] ({{lang-ar|{{large|المطوعين، مطوعية}}}} ''{{transl|ar|muṭawwiʿīn, muṭawwiʿiyyah}}'')&lt;ref&gt;''muṭawiʿin''; variant English spellings: mutawwain, muttawa, mutawallees, mutawa’ah, mutawi’, mutawwa' most literally means "volunteers" in the Arabic language, ''[[Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic]]'' by Hans Wehr, edited by J. M. Cowan, 4th edition (1994, {{ISBN|0879500034}}), p. 670.&lt;/ref&gt; are the government-authorized or government-recognized religious police (or clerical [[police]]) of [[Saudi Arabia]]. Elsewhere, enforcement of Islamic values in accordance with sharia is the responsibility of the ''Polisi Perda Syariah Islam'' in Aceh province of [[Indonesia]],&lt;ref&gt;Fealy &amp; White (2008), ''Regional Sharia Regulations in Indonesia: Anomaly or Symptom?'', Chapter: Expressing Islam: Religious life and politics in Indonesia, {{ISBN|978-9812308511}}{{page needed|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (Gaza Strip)]] in parts of Palestine, and the [[Basij]]i Force in Iran.&lt;ref name="rferl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Irans_Basij_Force_Mainstay_Of_Domestic_Security/1357081.html |title=Iran's Basij Force&amp;nbsp;– The Mainstay Of Domestic Security|date= January 15, 2009 |work=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hisbah]] ({{lang-ar|{{large|حسبة}}}} ''ḥisb(ah)'', or hisba) is a historic Islamic doctrine which means "accountability".&lt;ref name=sz&gt;Sami Zubaida (2005), Law and Power in the Islamic World, {{ISBN|978-1850439349}}, pp. 58–60&lt;/ref&gt; Hisbah doctrine holds that it is a religious obligation of every Muslim that he or she report to the ruler (Sultan, government authorities) any wrong behavior of a neighbor or relative that violates sharia or insults Islam. The doctrine states that it is the divinely sanctioned duty of the ruler to intervene when such charges are made, and coercively "command right and forbid wrong" in order to keep everything in order according to sharia.&lt;ref name=lv&gt;Lorenzo Vidino (2013), [http://www.css.ethz.ch/publications/pdfs/Hisba_in_Europe.pdf Hisba in Europe?], European Foundation for Democracy, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Cook (historian)|Michael Cook]]: ''Commanding right and forbidding wrong in Islamic thought.''

===Legal and court proceedings===
{{anchor|Courts}}
[[File:Malacca State Syariah Court.JPG|thumb|Shariah Court in [[Malacca]], [[Malaysia]].]]

Sharia judicial proceedings have significant differences from other legal traditions, including those in both [[common law]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]. Sharia courts traditionally do not rely on lawyers; [[plaintiffs]] and [[defendants]] represent themselves. Trials are conducted solely by the judge, and there is no jury system. There is no pre-trial [[Discovery (law)|discovery]] process, and no [[cross-examination]] of witnesses. Unlike common law, judges' verdicts do not set binding [[precedents]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.jrank.org/pages/7816/Law-Islamic.html Islamic Law&amp;nbsp;– Legal Literature And Institutions, Jurisprudence: The "Sources" of the Law, The Modern Period].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ddc.aub.edu.lb/projects/pspa/qatar.html |title=Qatar: The Duality of the Legal System |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the principle of ''[[stare decisis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://caselaw.findlaw.com/data2/delawarestatecases/493-2003.pdf ''Saudi Arabia Basic Industries Corp. v. Mobil Yanbu Petrochemical Co.'', Supreme Court of Delaware, January 14, 2005 p. 52]. "The Saudi law system differs in critically important respects from the system of legal thought employed by the common law countries, including the United States. Perhaps most significant is that Islamic law does not embrace the common law system of binding precedent and ''stare decisis''. In Saudi Arabia, judicial decisions are not in themselves a source of law, and with minor exceptions, court decisions in Saudi Arabia are not published or even open to public inspection."&lt;/ref&gt; and unlike civil law, sharia is left to the interpretation in each case and has no formally [[Codification (law)|codified]] universal statutes.&lt;ref&gt;Tetley (1999), Mixed Jurisdictions: Common Law v. Civil Law (Codified and Uncodified), La. Law Review, 60, 677&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[rules of evidence]] in sharia courts also maintain a distinctive custom of prioritizing oral testimony.&lt;ref&gt;Fortna, Benjamin C. (March 2011). "Education and Autobiography at the End of the Ottoman Empire". ''[[Die Welt des Islams]]''. New Series, Vol. 41, Issue 1. p. 131. "the literacy rate in the Ottoman Empire in 1900 was between five and ten percent".&lt;/ref&gt; Witnesses, in a sharia court system, must be faithful, that is Muslim.&lt;ref name=av1&gt;Antoinette Vlieger (2012), Domestic Workers in Saudi Arabia and the Emirates, {{ISBN|978-1610271288}}, Chapter 4{{page needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male Muslim witnesses are deemed more reliable than female Muslim witnesses, and non-Muslim witnesses considered unreliable and receive no priority in a sharia court.&lt;ref&gt;Tahir Wasti (2009), The Application of Islamic Criminal Law in Pakistan, Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004172258}}, pp. 126–27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Etannibi E. O. Alemika (2005), "Human Rights and Shariah Penal Code in Northern Nigeria", ''UN Human Rights Monitor'', pp. 110–27&lt;/ref&gt; In civil cases in some countries, a Muslim woman witness is considered half the worth and reliability than a Muslim man witness.&lt;ref name=unicef2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=mfdl1/&gt; In criminal cases, women witnesses are unacceptable in stricter, traditional interpretations of sharia, such as those found in [[Hanbali]] madhhab.&lt;ref name=av1/&gt;

====Criminal cases====
A confession, an oath, or the oral testimony of Muslim witnesses are the main evidence admissible, in sharia courts, for hudud crimes, that is the religious crimes of adultery, fornication, rape, accusing someone of illicit sex but failing to prove it, [[Apostasy in Islam|apostasy]], drinking intoxicants and theft.&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed S.

Testimony to establish the crime of adultery, fornication or rape must be from four Muslim male witnesses, with some [[fiqh]]s allowing substitution of up to three male with six female witnesses; however, at least one must be a Muslim male.&lt;ref&gt;Ajijola, Alhaji A.D. (1989). ''Introduction to Islamic Law''. Karachi: International Islamic Publishers. p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Forensic identification|Forensic evidence]] (''i.e.'', fingerprints, ballistics, blood samples, DNA etc.) and other [[circumstantial evidence]] is likewise rejected in [[hudud]] cases in favor of eyewitnesses, a practice which can cause severe difficulties for women plaintiffs in rape cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kamali |first1=Mohammad Hashim |authorlink=Mohammad Hashim Kamali |year=1998 |title=Punishment in Islamic Law: A Critique of the Hudud Bill of Kelantan, Malaysia |jstor=3382008 |journal=[[Arab Law Quarterly]] |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=203–34 |doi=10.1163/026805598125826102}}{{qn|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mohd Noor |first1=Azman |last2=Ibrahim |first2=Ahmad Basri |year=2008 |title=The rights of a rape victim in Islamic Law |journal=IIUM Law Journal |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=65–83 |url=http://irep.iium.edu.my/id/eprint/5699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim jurists have debated whether and when coerced confession and coerced witnesses are acceptable.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} In the Ottoman Criminal Code, the executive officials were allowed to use torture only if the accused had a bad reputation and there were already indications of his guilt, such as when stolen goods were found in his house, if he was accused of grievous bodily harm by the victim or if a criminal during investigation mentioned him as an accomplice.&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Rudolph |last1=Peters |title=Crime and Punishment in Islamic Law |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521796705 |date=2006 |pages=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confessions obtained under torture could not be used as a ground for awarding punishment unless they were corroborated by circumstantial evidence.&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press"/&gt;

====Civil cases====
{{cite quran|2|282 |s=nosup}} recommends written financial contracts with reliable witnesses, although there is dispute about equality of female testimony.&lt;ref name=mfdl1&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fadel |first1=Mohammad |title=Two Women, One Man: Knowledge, Power, and Gender in Medieval Sunni Legal Thought |journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies |volume=29 |issue=2 |year=2009 |pages=185–204 |ssrn=1113891 |jstor=164016 |doi=10.1017/S0020743800064461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marriage is solemnized as a written financial contract, in the presence of two Muslim male witnesses, and it includes a brideprice ([[Mahr]]) payable from a Muslim man to a Muslim woman. The brideprice is considered by a sharia court as a form of debt. Written contracts are paramount in sharia courts in the matters of dispute that are debt-related, which includes marriage contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Paul Powers |date=2005 |title=Intent in Islamic Law: Motive and Meaning in Medieval Sunnī Fiqh |publisher=Brill Academic |isbn=978-9004145924 |pages=97–110, 125–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written contracts in debt-related cases, when notarized by a judge, is deemed more reliable.&lt;ref name=remes1/&gt;

In commercial and civil contracts, such as those relating to exchange of merchandise, agreement to supply or purchase goods or property, and others, oral contracts and the testimony of Muslim witnesses triumph over written contracts. Sharia system has held that written commercial contracts may be forged.&lt;ref name=remes1&gt;Reem Meshal (2014), ''Sharia and the Making of the Modern Egyptian'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-9774166174}}, pp. 96–101 and Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=timku1&gt;Timur Kuran (2012), The Long Divergence: How Islamic Law Held Back the Middle East, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691156415}}, pp. 246–49 and Chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt; [[Timur Kuran]] states that the treatment of written evidence in religious courts in Islamic regions created an incentive for opaque transactions, and the avoidance of written contracts in economic relations. This led to a continuation of a "largely oral contracting culture" in Muslim-majority nations and communities.&lt;ref name=timku1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/private/ierc/conference_registration/papers/Kuran.pdf "Explaining the Economic Trajectories of Civilizations&amp;nbsp;– Musings on the Systemic Approach"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020235639/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/private/ierc/conference_registration/papers/Kuran.pdf |date=2014-10-20 }} pp. 7, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In lieu of written evidence, oaths are accorded much greater weight; rather than being used simply to guarantee the truth of ensuing testimony, they are themselves used as evidence. Plaintiffs lacking other evidence to support their claims may demand that defendants take an oath swearing their innocence, refusal thereof can result in a verdict for the plaintiff.&lt;ref&gt;Lippman, Matthew Ross; McConville, Seán; Yerushalmi, Mordechai (1988). ''Islamic Criminal Law and Procedure&amp;nbsp;– An Introduction''. New York City: [[Praeger Publishers]]. p. 71. {{ISBN|978-0275930097}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking an oath for Muslims can be a grave act; one study of courts in Morocco found that lying litigants would often "maintain their testimony right up to the moment of oath-taking and then to stop, refuse the oath, and surrender the case."&lt;ref name="frank"&gt;Frank, Michael J. (April 2006). "Trying Times&amp;nbsp;– The Prosecution of Terrorists in the Central Criminal Court of Iraq". ''[[Florida Journal of International Law]]''.{{page needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, defendants are not routinely required to swear before testifying, which would risk casually profaning the Quran should the defendant commit perjury;&lt;ref name="frank"/&gt; instead oaths are a solemn procedure performed as a final part of the evidence process.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

====Diya====
{{main article|Diya (Islam)}}

In classical jurisprudence monetary compensation for bodily harm (''[[Diya (Islam)|diya]]'' or blood money) is assessed differently for different classes of victims. For example, for Muslim women the amount was half that assessed for a Muslim man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Arsani |last1=William |title=An Unjust Doctrine of Civil Arbitration: Sharia Courts in Canada and England |journal=Stanford Journal of International Relations |date=Spring 2010 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=40–47 |url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/sjir/pdf/Sharia_11.2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M Kar (2005), Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures: Family, Law and Politics (Ed: Suad Joseph, Afsāna Naǧmābādī), Brill, {{ISBN|978-9004128187}}, pp. 406–07&lt;/ref&gt; ''Diya'' for the death of a free Muslim man is twice as high as for Jewish and Christian victims according to the Maliki and Hanbali madhhabs and three times as high according to Shafi'i rules.&lt;ref name=ame1/&gt; Several legals schools assessed ''diya'' for [[Magians]] (''[[majus]]'') at one-fifteenth the value of a free Muslim male.&lt;ref name=ame1&gt;Anver M.

Modern countries which incorporate classical ''diya'' rules into their legal system treat them in different ways. The Pakistan Penal Code modernized the Hanafi doctrine by eliminating distinctions between Muslims and non-Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Application of Islamic Criminal Law in Pakistan |author=Tahir Wasti |publisher=Brill |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=88-XutlkJAQC&amp;pg=PA49 |page=49 |year=2009 |isbn=978-9004172258}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Iran, ''diya'' for non-Muslim victims professing one of the faiths protected under the constitution (Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians) was made equal to ''diya'' for Muslims in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford Handbook of Criminal Law |editors=Markus D.

A 2013 survey based on interviews of 38,000 Muslims, randomly selected from urban and rural parts in 39 countries using area probability designs, by the [[Pew Forum|Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life]] found that a majority—in some cases "overwhelming" majority—of Muslims in a number of countries support making sharia the [[law of the land]], including Afghanistan (99%), Iraq (91%), Niger (86%), Malaysia (86%), Pakistan (84%), Morocco (83%), Bangladesh (82%), Egypt (74%), Indonesia (72%), Jordan (71%), Uganda (66%), Ethiopia (65%), Mali (63%), Ghana (58%), and Tunisia (56%).&lt;ref name=pewssp15/&gt; In Muslim regions of Southern-Eastern Europe and Central Asia, the support is less than 50%: Russia (42%), Kyrgyzstan (35%), Tajikistan (27%), Kosovo (20%), Albania (12%), Turkey (12%), Kazakhstan (10%), Azerbaijan (8%). Regarding specific averages, in South Asia, Sharia had 84% favorability rating among the respondents; in Southeast Asia 77%; in the Middle-East/North Africa 74%; in Sub-Saharan Africa 64%; in Southern-Eastern Europe 18%; and in Central Asia 12%.&lt;ref name=pewssp15/&gt;

However, while most of those who support implementation of sharia favor using it in family and property disputes, fewer supported application of severe punishments such as whippings and cutting off hands, and interpretations of some aspects differed widely.&lt;ref name=pewssp15&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Sandra |editor-last=Stence |year=2013 |others=Research: Alan Cooperman, Neha Sahgal, Jessica Hamar Martinez, et al. |title=The World's Muslims: Religion, Politics and Society |publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life |pages=15–19, 46, 147–48 |ref=harv |url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf |accessdate=31 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030223449/http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf# |archive-date=2014-10-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Pew poll, among Muslims who support making sharia the law of the land, most do not believe that it should be applied to non-Muslims.
In the Muslim-majority countries surveyed this proportion varied between 74% (of 74% in Egypt) and 19% (of 10% in Kazakhstan), as percentage of those who favored making sharia the law of the land.{{sfn|Stence|2013|p=48}} Polls demonstrate that for Egyptians, the 'Shariah' is associated with notions of political, social and gender justice.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan A.C.

In 2008, [[Rowan Williams]], the Archbishop of Canterbury, has suggested that Islamic and [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] courts should be integrated into the British legal system alongside ecclesiastical courts to handle marriage and divorce, subject to agreement of all parties and strict requirements for protection of equal rights for women.&lt;ref name="feldman"&gt;{{cite news |last=Feldman |first=Noah |title=Why Shariah? |date=Mar 16, 2008 |newspaper=New York Times Magazine |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/magazine/16Shariah-t.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; His reference to the sharia sparked a controversy.&lt;ref name="feldman" /&gt; Later that year, [[Nicholas Phillips, Baron Phillips of Worth Matravers|Nicholas Phillips]], then [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales]], stated that there was "no reason why sharia principles [...] should not be the basis for mediation or other forms of alternative dispute resolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sharia law 'could have UK role' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7488790.stm |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=Sep 4, 2016 |date=4 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 YouGov poll in the United Kingdom found 40% of Muslim students interviewed supported the introduction of sharia into British law for Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/2461830/Killing-for-religion-is-justified-say-third-of-Muslim-students.html Killing for religion is justified, say third of Muslim students] The Telegraph (July 26, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Broyde]], professor of law at [[Emory University]] specializing in [[alternative dispute resolution]] and [[Jewish law]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.emory.edu/faculty-and-scholarship/faculty-profiles/broyde-profile.html |title=Michael J.

[[Islamic fundamentalism|Fundamentalists]], wishing to return to basic Islamic religious values and law, have in some instances imposed harsh sharia punishments for crimes, curtailed civil rights and violated human rights. Extremists have used the Quran and their own particular version of sharia to justify acts of war and terror against Muslim as well as non-Muslim individuals and governments, using alternate, conflicting interpretations of sharia and their notions of jihad.&lt;ref name=aenexeter/&gt;{{sfn|Horrie|Chippindale|1991|p=4}}{{sfn|Horrie|Chippindale|1991|p=100}}

The sharia basis of arguments advocating terrorism is controversial.

Pearson Prentice Hall. p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; and the terrorist practice of suicide bombing "has no justification in terms of Islamic theology, law or tradition".&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis (with Buntzie Ellis Churchill) 'Islam: The Religion and the People' (2008). Pearson Prentice Hall p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern era the notion of jihad has lost its jurisprudential relevance and instead gave rise to an ideological and political discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wael B.

According to Jan Michiel Otto, Professor of Law and Governance in Developing Countries at [[Leiden University]], "[a]nthropological research shows that people in local communities often do not distinguish clearly whether and to what extent their norms and practices are based on local tradition, tribal custom, or religion. Those who adhere to a confrontational view of sharia tend to ascribe many undesirable practices to sharia and religion overlooking custom and culture, even if high-ranking religious authorities have stated the opposite."{{sfn|Otto|2008|p=30}}

==Criticism==

===Compatibility with western democracy===
{{further information|Islamic ethics|Islam and democracy|Shura|Ijma}}
Ali Khan states that "constitutional orders founded on the principles of sharia are fully compatible with democracy, provided that religious minorities are protected and the incumbent Islamic leadership remains committed to the right to recall".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Ali |last1=Khan |date=September 9, 2002 |title=Will the European Court of Human Rights Push Turkey Toward Islamic Revolution? |journal=Jurist |ssrn=941002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khan, L.

Courts in non-Muslim-majority nations have generally ruled against the implementation of sharia, both in jurisprudence and within a community context, based on sharia's religious background.

===Human rights===
Several major, predominantly Muslim countries have criticized the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) for its perceived failure to take into account the cultural and religious context of non-[[Western world|Western]] countries. Iran declared in the UN assembly that UDHR was "a [[Secularism|secular]] understanding of the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition", which could not be implemented by Muslims without trespassing the Islamic law.&lt;ref&gt;David P. Forsythe (2009), Encyclopedia of Human Rights: Vol. 1, Oxford University Press, pp. 239–45&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic scholars and Islamist political parties consider 'universal human rights' arguments as imposition of a non-Muslim culture on Muslim people, a disrespect of customary cultural practices and of Islam.&lt;ref name=as1999&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Amyn B |last1=Sajoo |date=Spring 1990 |title=Islam and Human Rights: Congruence or Dichotomy |journal=Temple International and Comparative Law Journal |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=23–34 |oclc=81814299}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Kecia |last1=Ali |chapter=Progressive Muslims and Islamic jurisprudence: the necessity for critical engagement with marriage and divorce law |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=2MCcAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT189 |pages=163–87 |editor1-first=Omid |editor1-last=Safi |year=2003 |title=Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism |publisher=Oneworld |isbn=978-1780740454}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], a group representing all Muslim-majority nations, met in Cairo to respond to the UDHR, then adopted the [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Heiner |last1=Bielefeldt |title='Western' versus 'Islamic' Human Rights Conceptions?: A Critique of Cultural Essentialism in the Discussion on Human Rights |journal=Political Theory |volume=28 |issue=1 |year=2000 |pages=90–121 |jstor=192285 |doi=10.1177/0090591700028001005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anver M.

[[Ann Elizabeth Mayer]] points to notable absences from the Cairo Declaration: provisions for democratic principles, protection for religious freedom, freedom of association and freedom of the press, as well as equality in rights and equal protection under the law. Article 24 of the Cairo declaration states that "all the rights and freedoms stipulated in this Declaration are subject to the Islamic ''shari'a''".&lt;ref name=mayer&gt;{{cite book |first1=Ann Elizabeth |last1=Mayer |chapter=Islamic Law and Human Rights: Conundrums and Equivocations |editor1-first=Carrie |editor1-last=Gustafson |editor2-first=Peter H. |editor2-last=Juviler |year=2016 |title=Religion and Human Rights: Competing Claims?: Competing Claims? |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1315502557}}{{page needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the journal ''[[Free Inquiry]]'' summarized the criticism of the Cairo Declaration in an editorial: "We are deeply concerned with the changes to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] by a coalition of Islamic states within the [[United Nations]] that wishes to prohibit any criticism of religion and would thus protect Islam's limited view of human rights. In view of the conditions inside the Islamic Republic of Iran, Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the Sudan, Syria, Bangladesh, Iraq, and Afghanistan, we should expect that at the top of their human rights agenda would be to rectify the legal inequality of women, the suppression of political dissent, the curtailment of free expression, the persecution of ethnic minorities and religious dissenters&amp;nbsp;– in short, protecting their citizens from egregious human rights violations. Instead, they are worrying about protecting Islam."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kurtz, [[Austin Dacey]], and Tom Flynn. "Defaming Human Rights". ''[[Free Inquiry]]''. February/March 2009, Vol. 29, No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[H. Patrick Glenn]] states that sharia is structured around the concept of mutual obligations of a collective, and it considers individual human rights as potentially disruptive and unnecessary to its revealed code of mutual obligations. In giving priority to this religious collective rather than individual liberty, the Islamic law justifies the formal inequality of individuals (women, non-Islamic people).&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, H. Patrick (2014), pp. 199–205&lt;/ref&gt; Bassam Tibi states that sharia framework and human rights are incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tibi |first1=Bassam |title=The Return of the Sacred to Politics as a Constitutional Law The Case of the Shari'atization of Politics in Islamic Civilization |journal=Theoria |volume=55 |issue=115 |pages=91–119 |year=2008 |jstor=41802396 |doi=10.3167/th.2008.5511506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdel al-Hakeem Carney, in contrast, states that sharia is misunderstood from a failure to distinguish ''sharia'' from ''siyasah'' (politics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carney |first1=ABD Al-Hakeem |title=The Desacralisation of Power in Islam |journal=Religion, State and Society |volume=31 |issue=2 |year=2003 |pages=203–19 |doi=10.1080/09637490308281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the United Nations' [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], every human has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change their religion or belief. Sharia has been criticized for not recognizing this human right.

* If a person converts to Islam, or is born and raised as a Muslim, then he or she will have full rights of citizenship in an Islamic state.&lt;ref name=naim96/&gt;
* Leaving Islam is a sin and a religious crime. Once any man or woman is officially classified as Muslim, because of birth or religious conversion, he or she will be subject to the death penalty if he or she becomes an [[Apostasy in Islam|apostate]], that is, abandons his or her faith in Islam in order to become an atheist, agnostic or to convert to another religion. Before executing the death penalty, sharia demands that the individual be offered one chance to return to Islam.&lt;ref name=naim96/&gt;
* If a person has never been a Muslim, and is not a [[kafir]] (infidel, unbeliever), he or she can live in an Islamic state by accepting to be a [[dhimmi]], or under a special permission called ''aman''. As a dhimmi or under aman, he or she will suffer certain limitations of rights as a subject of an Islamic state, and will not enjoy complete legal equality with Muslims.&lt;ref name=naim96/&gt;
* If a person has never been a Muslim, and is a kafir (infidel, unbeliever), sharia demands that he or she should be offered the choice to convert to Islam and become a Muslim; if he or she rejects the offer, he or she may become a dhimmi. Failure to pay the tax may lead the non-Muslim to either be enslaved, killed or ransomed if captured.&lt;ref name=naim96/&gt;

{{main article|Women in Islam|Islam and domestic violence}}

====Domestic violence====
Many claim sharia law encourages domestic violence against women, when a husband suspects ''[[nushuz]]'' (disobedience, disloyalty, rebellion, ill conduct) in his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Farid |last1=Esack |chapter=Islam and Gender Justice: Beyond Simplistic Apologia |chapterurl={{Google books|riz_cIdSq0gC |page=187 |plainurl=yes}} |pages=187–210 |editor1-first=John C. |editor1-last=Raines |editor2-first=Daniel C. |editor2-last=Maguire |year=2014 |title=What Men Owe to Women: Men's Voices from World Religions |publisher=SUNY |isbn=978-0791491553 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars claim wife beating, for ''nashizah'', is not consistent with modern perspectives of the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Hamid R. |last1=Kusha |chapter=Qur'anic Perspectives on Wife Abuse |pages=595–602 |editor1-first=Nicky Ali |editor1-last=Jackson |year=2007 |title=Encyclopedia of Domestic Violence |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0415969680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the verses of the Quran relating to permissibility of domestic violence is [[An-Nisa, 34|Surah 4:34]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alim.org/library/quran/ayah/compare/4/34/men-are-given-authority-over-women-and-corrective-measures-for-disobedient-women-and-arbitration-in-family-disputes |title=Surah 4:34 (An-Nisaa), Alim&amp;nbsp;– Translated by Mohammad Asad, Gibraltar (1980) |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eui.eu/DepartmentsAndCentres/RobertSchumanCentre/Research/InternationalTransnationalRelations/MediterraneanProgramme/MRM/MRM2011/ws04.aspx Salhi and Grami (2011), Gender and Violence in the Middle East and North Africa, Florence (Italy), European University Institute] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927154118/http://www.eui.eu/DepartmentsAndCentres/RobertSchumanCentre/Research/InternationalTransnationalRelations/MediterraneanProgramme/MRM/MRM2011/ws04.aspx |date=September 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharia has been criticized for ignoring women's rights in domestic abuse cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Mathias |last1=Rohe |chapter=Shari'a in a European Context |chapterurl={{Google books|bY1sReuxDy0C |page=93 |plainurl=yes}} |pages=93–114 |editor1-first=Ralpho |editor1-last=Grillo |editor2-first=Roger |editor2-last=Ballard |editor3-first=Alessandro |editor3-last=Ferrari |editor4-first=André J. |editor4-last=Hoekema |editor5-first=Marcel |editor5-last=Maussen |editor6-first=Prakash |editor6-last=Shah |year=2009 |title=Legal Practice and Cultural Diversity |publisher=Ashgate |isbn=978-0754675471 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Funder |first1=Anna |title=''De Minimis Non Curat Lex'': The Clitoris, Culture and the Law |journal=Transnational Law &amp; Contemporary Problems |volume=3 |issue=2 |year=1993 |pages=417–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Zainah |last1=Anwar |chapter=Law-Making in the Name of Islam: Implications for Democratic Governance |chapterurl={{Google books|6Js6QXUbmjYC |page=121 |plainurl=yes}} |pages=121–34 |editor1-first=K S |editor1-last=Nathan |editor2-first=Mohammad Hashim |editor2-last=Kamali |year=2005 |title=Islam in Southeast Asia: Political, Social and Strategic Challenges for the 21st Century |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |isbn=978-9812302830 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bakht |first1=Natasha |title=Family Arbitration Using Sharia Law: Examining Ontario's Arbitration Act and its Impact on Women |journal=Muslim World Journal of Human Rights |volume=1 |issue=1 |year=2007 |ssrn=1121953 |doi=10.2202/1554-4419.1022}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Musawah]], [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|CEDAW]], KAFA and other organizations have proposed ways to modify sharia-inspired laws to improve women's rights in Muslim-majority nations, including women's rights in domestic abuse cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.musawah.org/cedaw-and-muslim-family-laws-search-common-ground |title=CEDAW and Muslim Family Laws: In Search of Common Ground |year=2012 |publisher=[[Musawah]]}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brandt |first1=Michele |last2=Kaplan |first2=Jeffrey A. |title=The Tension between Women's Rights and Religious Rights: Reservations to Cedaw by Egypt, Bangladesh and Tunisia |journal=Journal of Law and Religion |volume=12 |issue=1 |year=1995 |pages=105–42 |jstor=1051612 |doi=10.2307/1051612}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/86247/lebanon-move-to-take-domestic-violence-cases-out-of-religious-courts |title=Lebanon – IRIN, United Nations Office of Humanitarian Affairs (2009) |work=IRINnews|date=2009-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/10/19/uae-spousal-abuse-never-right |title=UAE: Spousal Abuse never a Right |date=October 19, 2010 |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Personal status laws and child marriage====
Shari'a is the basis for personal status laws in most Islamic-majority nations. These personal status laws determine [[women's rights|rights of women]] in matters of marriage, divorce and child custody. A 2011 [[UNICEF]] report concludes that sharia law provisions are discriminatory against women from a human rights perspective. In legal proceedings under sharia law, a woman’s testimony is worth half of a man’s before a court.&lt;ref name=unicef2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/gender/files/REGIONAL-Gender-Eqaulity-Profile-2011.pdf |title=MENA Gender Equality Profile – Status of Girls and Women in the Middle East and North Africa, UNICEF (October 2011) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Except for Iran{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}, Lebanon{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} and Bahrain{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} which allow child marriages{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}, the civil codes in Islamic majority countries do not allow [[child marriage]] of girls. However, with sharia personal status laws, sharia courts in all these nations have the power to override the civil code. The religious courts permit girls less than 18 years old to marry. As of 2011, child marriages are common in a few Middle Eastern countries, accounting for 1 in 6 of all marriages in Egypt and 1 in 3 marriages in Yemen. [[UNICEF]] and other studies state that the top five nations in the world with highest observed child marriage rates – Niger (75%), Chad (72%), Mali (71%), Bangladesh (64%), Guinea (63%) – are Islamic-majority countries where the personal laws for Muslims are sharia-based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc09/docs/SOWC09-CountryExample-Mali.pdf |format=PDF |title=Child Marriage is a Death Sentence for Many Young Girls |publisher=UNICEF |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nour |first=Nawal M. |title=Health Consequences of Child Marriage in Africa |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |volume=12 |issue=11 |pages=1644–49 |year=2006 |pmid=17283612 |doi=10.3201/eid1211.060510 |pmc=3372345}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[Cairo speech]], President Obama spoke out against child marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=B0lwiInZG1E#t=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rape is considered a crime in all countries, but sharia courts in Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Morocco, Syria and Tunisia in some cases allow a rapist to escape punishment by marrying his victim, while in other cases the victim who complains is often prosecuted with the crime of ''[[Zina]]'' (adultery).&lt;ref name=unicef2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/challenges_to_women_security_mena_region.pdf |title=Kendra Heideman and Mona Youssef, Challenges to Women's Security in the MENA Region, Wilson Center (March, 2013) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/article/new-survey-assesses-womens-freedom-middle-east |title=Sanja Kelly (2010) New Survey Assesses Women's Freedom in the Middle East, Freedom House (funded by US Department of State's Middle East Partnership Initiative) |publisher=|date=2005-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Women's right to property and consent====
Sharia grants women the [[right to property|right to inherit property]] from other family members, and these rights are detailed in the Quran.{{sfn|Horrie|Chippindale|1991|p=49}} A woman's inheritance is unequal and less than a man's, and dependent on many factors.{{Quran-usc|4|12}}&lt;ref name=davidpowers/&gt; For instance, a daughter's inheritance is usually half that of her brother's.{{Quran-usc|4|11}}&lt;ref name=davidpowers&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Powers |first1=David S. |title=The Islamic Inheritance System: a Socio-Historical Approach |journal=Arab Law Quarterly |volume=8 |issue=1 |year=1993 |pages=13–29 |jstor=3381490 |doi=10.1163/157302593X00285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 20th century, Islamic law granted Muslim women certain legal rights, such as the right to own property received as [[Mahr]] (brideprice) at her marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Badawi |first=Jamal A. |title=The Status of Women in Islam |journal=Al-Ittihad Journal of Islamic Studies |volume=8 |issue=2 |date=September 1971}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Feldman&gt;{{cite news |authorlink=Noah Feldman |last=Feldman |first=Noah |title=Why Shariah? |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 16, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/magazine/16Shariah-t.html?ei=5070&amp;em=&amp;en=5c1b8de536ce606f&amp;ex=1205812800&amp;pagewanted=all |accessdate=September 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Islamic law does not grant non-Muslim women the same legal rights as the few it did grant Muslim women. Sharia recognizes the basic inequality between master and women slave, between free women and slave women, between Believers and non-Believers, as well as their unequal rights.&lt;ref name=blbr&gt;

Starting with the 20th century, Western legal systems evolved to expand women's rights, but women's rights under Islamic law have remained tied to the Quran, hadiths and their fundamentalist interpretation as sharia by Islamic jurists.&lt;ref name=alik/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Hafez, Mohammed |title=Why Muslims Rebel |journal=Al-Ittihad Journal of Islamic Studies |volume=1 |issue=2 |date=September 2006 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parallels with Western legal systems==

Early Islamic law developed a number of legal concepts that anticipated similar such concepts that later appeared in English [[common law]].&lt;ref name=Makdisi&gt;{{Citation|last=Makdisi|first=John A.|title=The Islamic Origins of the Common Law|journal=[[North Carolina Law Review]]|year=1999|date=June 1999|volume=77|issue=5|pages=1635–1739}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Devichand&gt;{{Cite news|author=Mukul Devichand|title=Is English law related to Muslim law?|publisher=BBC News|date=24 September 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7631388.stm|accessdate=2008-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities exist between the royal English [[contract]] protected by the action of [[debt]] and the Islamic ''Aqd'', between the English [[assize of novel disseisin]] and the Islamic ''Istihqaq'', and between the English [[jury]] and the Islamic ''Lafif'' in classical Maliki jurisprudence.&lt;ref name=Makdisi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Jamila|last=Hussain|title=Book Review: ''The Justice of Islam'' by Lawrence Rosen|journal=[[Melbourne University Law Review]]|volume=30|year=2001|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[law school]]s known as [[Inns of Court]] also parallel [[Madrasah]]s.&lt;ref name=Makdisi/&gt; The methodology of legal [[precedent]] and reasoning by [[analogy]] (''[[Qiyas]]'') are also similar in both the Islamic and common law systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Islamic Finance: Law, Economics, and Practice|first=Mahmoud A.|last=El-Gamal|year=2006|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0521864145|page=16|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; as are the English [[Trust law|trust]] and [[Agency (law)|agency]] institutions to the Islamic ''[[Waqf]]'' and ''[[Hawala]]'' institutions, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gaudiosi |first=Monica M. |title=The Influence of the Islamic Law of Waqf on the Development of the Trust in England: The Case of Merton College |journal=[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]] |volume=136 |issue=4 |date=April 1988 |pages=1231–1261 |doi=10.2307/3312162 |jstor=3312162 |ref=harv|url=http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol136/iss4/6 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Islamic Law: Its Relation to Other Legal Systems|first=Gamal Moursi|last=Badr|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=26|issue=2 – Proceedings of an International Conference on Comparative Law, Salt Lake City, Utah, February 24–25, 1977|date=Spring 1978|pages=187–198 [196–8]|doi=10.2307/839667|jstor=839667|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Devichand/&gt;

Elements of Islamic law also have other parallels in Western legal systems. For example, the influence of Islam on the development of an international law of the sea can be discerned alongside that of the Roman influence.&lt;ref name=Tai&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tai |first1=Emily Sohmer |title=Book Reviews: Hassan S. Khalilieh, ''Admiralty and Maritime Laws in the Mediterranean Sea (ca. 800–1050): The "Kitāb Akriyat al-Sufun" vis-à-vis the "Nomos Rhodion Nautikos"'' |journal=Medieval Encounters |volume=13 |issue=3 |year=2007 |pages=608–12 |doi=10.1163/157006707X222812}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Makdisi states Islamic law also parallels the legal scholastic system in the West, which gave rise to the modern university system.&lt;ref name=G-Makdisi/&gt; He writes that the triple status of ''[[faqih]]'' ("[[Master of Laws|master of law]]"), ''[[mufti]]'' ("professor of [[Fatwā|legal opinions]]") and ''mudarris'' ("teacher"), conferred by the classical Islamic legal degree, had its equivalents in the medieval Latin terms ''[[Magister (degree)|magister]]'', ''[[professor]]'' and ''[[Doctor (title)|doctor]]'', respectively, although they all came to be used synonymously in both East and West.&lt;ref name=G-Makdisi&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Makdisi |first1=George |title=Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=109 |issue=2 |year=1989 |pages=175–82 |jstor=604423 |doi=10.2307/604423}}&lt;/ref&gt; Makdisi suggests that the medieval European doctorate, ''licentia docendi'' was modeled on the Islamic degree ''ijazat al-tadris wa-l-ifta’'', of which it is a word-for-word translation, with the term ''ifta’'' (issuing of fatwas) omitted.&lt;ref name=G-Makdisi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Devin J. |last=Stewart |title=Degrees, or Ijaza |editor=Josef W.

There are differences between Islamic and Western legal systems. For example, sharia classically recognizes only [[natural persons]], and never developed the concept of a [[legal person]], or [[corporation]], i.e., a legal entity that [[Limited liability|limits the liabilities]] of its managers, shareholders, and employees; exists beyond the lifetimes of its founders; and that can own assets, sign contracts, and appear in court through representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Timur |last1=Kuran |authorlink1=Timur Kuran |date=Fall 2005 |title=The Absence of the Corporation in Islamic Law: Origins and Persistence |journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law |volume=53 |issue=4 |pages=785–834 |jstor=30038724}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest prohibitions imposed secondary costs by discouraging record keeping and delaying the introduction of modern accounting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kuran |first1=Timur |title=The logic of financial westernization in the Middle East |journal=Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization |volume=56 |issue=4 |year=2005 |pages=593–615 |doi=10.1016/j.jebo.2004.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such factors, according to Timur Kuran, have played a significant role in retarding economic development in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0895330042162421 "Why the Middle East Is Economically Underdeveloped&amp;nbsp;– Historical Mechanisms of Institutional Stagnation"].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kurdish varieties mostly are written in either of two alphabets: a Latin alphabet introduced by Jeladet Ali Bedirkhan in 1932 (Bedirxan alphabet, or Hawar after the Hawar magazine), and an Perso-Arabic-based Sorani alphabet, named for the historical Soran Emirate of the present-day Iraqi Kurdistan.

While the Latin script is dominating Kurdish mass media everywhere; the Sorani script is just confined in Iraq and Iran. Two additional alphabets, based on the Armenian and Cyrillic scripts, were once used in Soviet Armenia.

==Kirmaşanî latîn alphabet==
[[Kirmaşanî]] (Kermashani) is the Southern branch of Kurdish language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ganj.irandoc.ac.ir/dashboard?q=%D9%86%D8%AD%D9%88&amp;topic_2=359447 | title=نحو کردی قصری بر مبنای دستور زایشی | publisher=Razi University | work=Linguistic thesis | date=2012 | accessdate=20 June 2015 | author=محمد رضا بهادر | pages=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirmaşanî uses [[Hawar alphabet]] with some modifications. Hawar alphabet has 31 letters but Kirmaşanî alphabet has 33 letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Grammaire kurde | publisher=Librairie d'Amérique et d'Orient | author=Celadet Ali Bedirxan, Roger Lescot | year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between the two alphabets goes back to the phonological differences between [[Kurmanji]] and Kirmaşanî. While Kirmaşanî has the   extra letters ł, ň, ř and ü, it lacks ê and o.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=واجنویسی زبان کردی | journal=گاهنامه‌ی ادبی، فرهنگی، اجتماعی کرماشان |date=February 2007  | volume=6 | pages=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]], a '''surface filter''' is type of [[sound change]] that operates not at a particular point in time but over a longer period. Surface filters normally affect any phonetic combination that is not permitted according to the language's phonetic rules and so preserve the [[phonotactics]] of that language. They are also often a source of [[complementary distribution]] between certain sets of sounds.

A trivial example of a surface filter is the replacement of sounds foreign to a language with sounds native to the language. For example, a language that has no front rounded vowels may replace such vowels with either front unrounded or back rounded vowels, whenever it borrows a word containing such a vowel. Strictly speaking, that is not a surface filter, as it is merely the way in which the phonetics of one language are matched to that of another. That example, however, still illustrates the importance of surface filters in preserving the phonological structure of words within the language. Usually, the term applies only to rules that affect both native and borrowed words.

==Examples==
One very common example of a surface filter is [[final-obstruent devoicing]] in which a [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] [[obstruent]] at the end of a word is automatically converted to their unvoiced counterpart. If that were a regular [[sound change]], the devoicing would occur only at a particular point in time, and any new words that entered the language later might end in voiced obstruents. However, new words are automatically "passed through the filter" like earlier words, and their final obstruents are devoiced automatically.

That happens even if there is [[apocope]] of final vowels, with non-final obstruents becoming final. A historical example in Dutch occurs in many verbs, such as ''blazen'' ("to blow"). The original [[Middle Dutch]] first-person singular present form was ''blaze'', but when the final ''-e'' was lost, the form did not become *''blaaz'' (the doubled vowel is only a spelling convention), but the ''-z'' was automatically devoiced to create the modern form, ''blaas''.

Two other examples of surface filters in the history of the [[Germanic languages]] were [[Sievers' law]] and the [[Germanic spirant law]].

Sievers' law caused a restriction on the distribution between ''-j-'' and ''-ij-''. The former appeared after a consonant following a short vowel, and the latter otherwise occurred. The process was automatic and affected even new words and loanwords: the [[Latin]] word ''puteus'' ("pit, well"), for example, was borrowed into Germanic as the two-syllable *''putjaz''. The more-faithful rendering *''putijaz'' was not permitted since the short vowel ''u'' was followed by a single consonant ''t''.

The Germanic spirant law affected combinations of an obstruent that was followed by ''-t-''. Such obstruents were automatically converted into fricatives, with dentals becoming ''-s-'', and devoiced. For example, the Latin word ''scriptum'' ("writing") was borrowed into Germanic as *''skriftiz''. The forbidden combination ''-pt-'' was replaced by ''-ft-''.

==Application==
Surface filters are often formed as a result of sound changes that change the phonetic makeup, and certain sounds or combinations no longer occur in the language. As a consequence, speakers no longer learn to pronounce such combinations and so have difficulty with new words that violate the principles. Then, either the phonology of the language is extended to incorporate such new combinations, or the "inconvenient" combinations are automatically reconstructed into a form that conforms to the phonotactics of the language. If the reconstruction occurs systematically and becomes part of the phonology of the language, the result is a surface filter.

Such phonological rules may continue to apply for an indefinite amount of time. Final-obstruent devoicing in Dutch, for example, has been a phonological rule since [[Old Dutch]], over 1000 years ago. The Germanic spirant law may have been formed as part of [[Grimm's law]] long before written records began, but it ceased to operate shortly after the Germanic languages began to separate, around the middle of the 1st millennium AD.

Sometimes, sound changes occur that directly violate a surface filter, which may cause it to cease operating. Sievers' law presumably lost relevance in the [[West Germanic languages]] after the operation of the [[West Germanic gemination]] since it eliminated the contrast between light and heavy syllables, at the core of the law's operation.

'''Tortilla art''' refers to [[fine art]] that uses [[tortilla]]s{{Citation needed|date=January 2016|reason=this article refers and links to "tortilla", an article about flour, not maize, tortillas. We need a citation to confirm this, if true; or the text needs clarifying and linking to "corn tortilla"}} as a [[canvas]].  The tortilla(s) are baked, often coated with acrylic and painted. The purpose of tortilla art is to reflect the [[Chicano]] cultural roots of the artist. Tortilla art is a technique used in many countries.

According to one tortilla artist,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tortilla Art|url = http://joebravo.net/sample-page/tortilla-art/|website = Joe Bravo|accessdate = 2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|text = "I use the Tortilla as a Canvas because it is an integral part of the Hispanic Culture and my heritage.

'''Transposed Letter Effect''', in psychology, tests any effect on how a word is processed when two letters within the word are switched.

The phenomenon takes place when two letters in a word (typically called a base word) switch positions to create a new string of letters that form a new, [[non-word]] (typically called a transposed letter non-word or TL non-word). It is a form of [[priming (psychology)]] because the transposed letter non-word is able to activate the lexical representation of its base word. A non-word that is created by transposing letters in a base word is significantly more effective at being a prime for that base word than would be a prime created by exchanging letters from the base word with random letters that were not originally in the base word. For example, the TL non-word 'stduent' would be a more effective prime than would be the non-word 'stobent' for the base word student.

Priming is an effect of [[implicit memory]] where exposure to a certain stimulus, event, or experience affects responding to a different stimulus. Typically, the event causes the stimulus to become more salient. The transposed letter effect can be used as a form of priming.

==Relevance==
With any priming task the purpose is to test the initial stages of processing in order to better understand more complex processing. Psychologists use transposed-letter priming to test how people comprehend word meanings. From these findings, people can begin to understand how people learn, develop and understand language. Transposed-letter priming is used in a wide array of experiments and the reasons for using this method can depend on the particular hypothesis.

==Types==

===Close Transpositions===
Switching the position of adjacent letters in the base word is a close [[wikt:transposition|transposition]]. This type of transposition creates the greatest priming effect. For example, an effective prime for the word "computer" would be the TL non-word "comptuer".

===Distant Transpositions===
Forming a prime word by switching the position of nonadjacent letters in the base word is a distant transposition. There is significantly less priming effect in a distant transposition than a close transposition, no matter how distant the two letters are from each other.

==History==
The first study to test the transposed-letter effects was Burner and O’Dowd (1958).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bruner, J. S. &amp; O’Dowd, D.|year=1958|title=A note on the informativeness of parts of words|journal=Language and Speech|volume=1|pages=98–101|doi=10.1177/002383095800100203}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their experiment did not use priming. They showed participants a word that had a two letter switched either at the beginning, in the middle or at the end of the word and they had to determine what the English word was. They measured their response time. Bruner and O’Dowd found that the error at the beginning created the slowest response time, the end was the next slowest and the middle was the fastest. The conclusion to this data was that the beginning and the end were more important for word recognition than the middle. From there, the transposition letter effect was used to test how people process and recognize words using many tasks.

==Transposed Letter Effect in Baboons==
A study by Ziegler et al. (2013) demonstrated that baboons also show similar effects in regards to the transposed letter effect as humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ziegler J. C., Hannagan T., Dufau S., Montant M., Fagot J., Grainger J. | year = 2013 | title = Transposed-letter effects reveal orthographic processing in baboons | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 24 | issue = 8| pages = 1609–1611 | doi=10.1177/0956797612474322}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the study was to find evidence to suggest that baboons use orthographic processing when reading. Previous research has considered transposed letter effects as strong evidence for orthographic processing (Grainger, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Graigner J. (2008). Cracking the orthographic code: An introduction. Language and Cognitive Processing, 23(1), 1-35.&lt;/ref&gt; Baboons were asked to classify strings of letters as either words or non-words by selecting certain shapes (for example, a circle for a word and a square for a non-word). The baboons were shown words they had previously learned and non-words. The non-words were created by using four-letter words, previously learned by the baboons, and either transposing the two middle letters or replacing the two middle letters with different letters (double substitute non-words). Baboons classified TL non-words as words significantly more often than double substitute non-words.

==Theories Effected by Transposed-Letter Priming Effects==

===Theories challenged by effects of transposed-letter priming===
There are a number of theories that have been challenged by the effects shown with transposition-letter priming. These theories mainly have to do with how letters are used to process words.

Slot-based coding theory states that each letter in a word is connected to a particular location, or slot, within that word. One of the major theories that predict letter slots is the interactive activation model created by [[James McClelland (psychologist)|McClelland]] and [[David Rumelhart|Rumelhart]] (1981).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = McClelland J. L., Rumelhart D. E. | year = 1981 | title = An interactive activation model of context effects in letter perception: Part 1. an account of basic findings | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 88 | issue = 5| pages = 375–407 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.88.5.375}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This model assumes that people are letter-position specific when detecting words, so our recognition of words is based on what letters it contains, where the letters are placed within that word and the length of the word itself. Another example is the bayesian reader model created by Norris (2006) which also assumes that the letters in a word are associated with their specific location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Norris, D.|year=2006|title=The bayesian reader: Explaining word recognition as an optimal bayesian decision process|journal=Psychological Review|volume=113|issue=2|pages=327–357|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.113.2.327|pmid=16637764}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many experiments (for example, Perea and Lupker, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;Perea, M. &amp; Lupker, S. J., (2003). Transposed-letter confusability effects in masked form priming. In Kinoshita, S. &amp; Lupker, S. J., (Eds.) Masked Priming: The State of the Art (97-120). New York, NY: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; have shown if you use transposed-letter priming, (for example, priming judge with jugde) you will see a priming effect but if the prime is a word where two letters are changed to other letter (for example, priming judge with jupfe) there is no priming effect. According to the two models discussed we would assume jugde is no more similar to judge than jupfe because the letters are not in the correct slots. In another experiment, TL non-words were more likely to be (incorrectly) classified as actual words than are nonsense control words (Andrews, 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Andrews S | year = 1996 | title = Lexical retrieval and selection processes: Effects of transposed-letter confusability | url = | journal = Journal of Memory and Language | volume = 35 | issue = 6| pages = 775–800 | doi=10.1006/jmla.1996.0040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew’s results are also inconsistent with the many slot-based coding models because even with two of the letters in the incorrect spot they read the word as if spelled correctly.

The parallel distributed processing model proposed by Seidenberg and McClelland (1989) also uses a portion of words but instead of letters they are a small group of letters in the same order as in the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Seidenberg M. S., McClelland J. L. | year = 1989 | title = A distributed, developmental model of word recognition and naming (English) | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 96 | issue = 4| pages = 523–568 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.96.4.523 | pmid=2798649}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the word “judge” would have these groupings: _ju, jud, udg, dge, ge_. This predicts that if part of two words match there will be some priming, but this model still depends on the position of the letters to some extent, so it is not compatible with results from transposed-letter priming.

===Theories supported by effect of transposed-letter priming===
There are a number of theories that are supported by the results shown by the transposed-letter effect.

The SERIOL model (sequential encoding regulated by inputs to oscillations within letter units) described by Whitney (2001) explains processing of words as five levels, or nodes: retinal level, feature level, letter level, bigram level and word level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Whitney C | year = 2001 | title = How the brain encodes the order of letters in a printed word: The SERIOL model and selective literature review | url = | journal = Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 221–243 | doi=10.3758/bf03196158}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the bigram level, the letters detected are turned into a number of pairs. For example, the word “cart” has the bigrams ca, ar, rt, ar, at and ct. The bigrams that more closely represent the location of letters in the words are given more weight. The pairs are then used to form the word. Within this model, letter location is still a factor but is not a defining feature of word processing, so the transposed-letter effect is consistent with this model.

In the SOLAR model (self-organizing lexical acquisition and recognition) described by Davis (1999) each letter is associated with its own level of activation.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, C. J. (1999). The self-organising lexical acquisition and recognition (SOLAR) model of visual word recognition (Doctoral dissertation). University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; The first letter in the word has the highest level of activation and so on until the last word has the lowest level of activation. In this model, position does describe the level of activation for that particular letter but because the activation is successive, two letters beside each other would have a similar activation level. The SOLAR model is consistent with the results of the transposed-letter effect priming because with this effect experiments have shown priming when two adjacent letters are switched but not when two letters farther apart in the word are switched.

Transposed-letter priming was used by Christianson, Johnson and Rayner (2005) on compound words to test the role of morphemes in word processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Christianson K., Johnson R. L., Rayner K. | year = 2005 | title = Letter transpositions within and across morphemes (English) | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume = 31 | issue = 6| pages = 1327–1339 | doi=10.1037/0278-7393.31.6.1327}}&lt;/ref&gt; They switched the letters either within the morphemes (for example, snowball to snowblal) or between morphemes (for example, snowball to snobwall) in the primes and found a greater priming effect within the morphemes than between. This supported the theory that morphemes are used during the processing of compound words because the priming effect was only reduced when the letters were switched over the morpheme boundary and were unable to separate into their separate parts.

'''Women in Housing and Finance (WHF)''' is a membership organization of professionals in the area of [[House|housing]] and [[finance]] located in the greater metropolitan area of [[New York City]].  Founded in 1981, WHF promotes and supports the professional growth of women in housing, finance and development and provides a vehicle through which members share knowledge and experience.

==History==

WHF Founder Cynthia Lewis was living in [[Washington, DC]], working at the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD), during the Carter years, a very heady time for women.  Many were appointed to high level jobs in the Administration. The Washington Women's Network held meetings in the Grand Ballroom of the Washington [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton]] and hundreds of “power women,” and some not-so-powerful, believed that a new era had begun for women. HUD had its share with Secretary Pat Harris and Assistant Secretary [[Donna Shalala]].

Lewis was invited to join a new group called ''Women in Housing and Finance'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whfdc.org/   Women In Housing and Finance, DC]&lt;/ref&gt; composed of women from government agencies, [[Capitol Hill]] staff, and local law firms.  She recently had been put in charge of a regulatory program and was able to make the contacts she needed through the group.

Late in 1979, Lewis came back to New York to work at the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]](FDIC) and she felt very isolated.  With her responsibility for enforcement of the Community Investment Act, Lewis needed to meet people in the field.  So she started to talk to women she met about the need for an “old girls’ network.”  Lewis finally realized that it never would happen unless she did something herself. So Lewis started recruiting.

Connie Gibson, from the New Jersey Mortgage Finance Agency (NJMFA), spoke at a conference Lewis attended at [[Citibank]].  Lewis asked her if she would be interested in a women’s networking group; she was.  Lewis had met Anita Miller when, as Acting Chair of the [[Federal Home Loan Bank Board]] (FHLBB), she spoke at WHF Washington.  She was back in New York at the Ford Foundation and thought it would be a good idea.  Lewis also talked to Fran Levenson (Goldome Bank), Harriette Silverberg ([[Metlife]]), Kathy Wylde (Anchor Savings Bank), Lois Kleinerman (New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR)), Beverly Wettenstein ([[Federal Home Loan Bank Board]] (FHLBB)), Carla Lerman (Bergen County Housing Authority), Jean Lerman (New York City Housing Preservation and Development (HPD)), and Kay Bergin ([[Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation]]).

They all got together in Lewis’s living room in the fall of 1980.  They decided that they should each call ten women and invite them to a luncheon meeting to discuss forming a new organization.  About 50 women came, and it was clear that they were on our way.  Lewis suggested that they affiliate with WHF Washington because it was an established group.  That is how WHF got its name.  Periodically, WHF discussed changing the name, but the Board of Directors always decides that, although WHF welcomes men members, it wants to keep its original identity.

WHF began officially with a luncheon on January 16, 1981 at [[McGraw-Hill]]. Caryl Austrian, President of WHF Washington, and Anita Miller (then with the [[Ford Foundation]]) were the speakers. Beverly Wettenstein notified the media of the event.

On February 4, Cynthia Lewis and the other “founding mothers” — Kay Bergin, Jean Lerman, Harriette Silverberg, Connie Gibson, Dana Cahoon, Lois Kleinerman Bernstein, Beverly Wettenstein, Fran Levenson, and Kathy Wylde — met and formed a steering committee to draft a statement of purpose, by-laws, and membership criteria which required a “level of professionalism consistent with retaining active participation of high-level women.”

This task was completed by August. The first slate of candidates included President Cynthia Lewis, First Vice President Connie Gibson, Second Vice President Fran Levenson, Secretary Lois Bernstein, and Treasurer Mary Williams. They were elected unanimously in October, 1981, together with board members Kay Bergin, Martha Lamar, Carla Lerman, Jean Lerman, Anita Miller, Harriette Silverberg, Beverly Wettenstein, and Kathy Wylde. The members approved the By-laws and an annual budget of $5,000.

==Membership==

WHF’s membership is a diversified group of accomplished individuals drawn from all aspects of housing and finance throughout [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]] and [[Connecticut]].  Members are engaged in [[architecture]], [[banking]], [[law]], [[regional development|development]], [[construction]], [[brokerage]], [[investment banking]], [[marketing]] and [[sales]], municipal [[finance]], [[accounting]], [[property management]], [[historic preservation]] and more.  Members come from the private sector, from state, local and [[List of United States federal agencies|federal agencies]], and from [[not-for-profit]] organizations and [[community groups]].

In 1997, a core group of professionals launched a vibrant New Jersey chapter which presents programs of statewide interest. More recently, WHF added a [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]/Connecticut chapter which has held several interesting and timely events.

Membership has changed over the years.   WHF also periodically discusses becoming more public and aggressively recruiting new members, but it seems that most members prefer keeping the group at roughly the same size.  About 20% of membership changes each year, but it remains around 160-190.  That’s manageable for meetings and or networking.

==Programs==

WHF has been a central resource for women in the housing and finance industry throughout the New York area.  Since its inception, as market cycles have come and gone, WHF has endeavored to present up to the minute information, networking opportunities and professional development for its members.

Programs are scheduled monthly during breakfast, lunch or early evening times.  Speakers and panelists include leaders in their fields as well as key public policy makers.  WHF also hosts professional development programs in small group settings.  These are scheduled to meet the needs of members.

Programs are frequently planned in conjunction with other New York City groups with similar missions, including: Women in Transportation, Women in Real Estate, Women’s City Club, the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], [[Citizens Housing and Planning Council (CHPC)]], [[MOMA]], [[Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy]] and The [[New-York Historical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nyhistory.org/web/ The New-York Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent programs have included the following:

*Affordable Housing Roundtable
*Green Buildings&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbangreencouncil.org/ US Green Building Council]&lt;/ref&gt;(US Green Building Council, New York)
*Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design for Neighborhood Development (LEED-ND)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrdc.org/cities/smartgrowth/leed.asp/  Natural Resources Defense Council]&lt;/ref&gt; (Natural Resources Defense Council)
*American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
*Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chpcny.org /| Citizens Housing and Planning Council]&lt;/ref&gt;(Citizens Housing and Planning Council)
*Home Delivery, Fabricating the Modern Dwelling&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.momahomedelivery.org/  The Museum of Modern Art(MOMA)]&lt;/ref&gt;(MOMA)
*Brownfield Opportunity Act&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npcr.net /| New Partners for Community Revitalization]&lt;/ref&gt;(New Partners for Community Revitalization)
*Local Effects of the Foreclosure Crisis in New York City&lt;ref&gt;[http://furmancenter.org/  Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy]&lt;/ref&gt;(Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy)

==Networking==

Supplementing regular programming, WHF sponsors a series of festive seasonal events enhancing opportunities for members to meet and get to know each other in informal social settings.  These events include a colorful autumn gathering to greet new members, a January holiday party, an adventurous behind the scenes springtime field trip that explores fascinating locales not often available to the general public and an exceptional summer dinner for WHF’s annual membership meeting to conclude the WHF year.  Honored guests and speakers have included [[Elinor Guggenheimer]], [[Alair Townsend]], [[Carol Bellamy]], [[Claire Shulman]], [[Charles Schumer]] and New York City's Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]].

To further fulfill its mission to promote the professional development of its members, WHF maintains a [[job bank]] with an updated list of positions available in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.

WHF is a member of The [[New York Women's Agenda]].

This article focuses on '''Zoroastrianism in the United States'''.

==History==
Historical records indicate that the Zoroastrian presence in America dates back to the 1860s, during California’s Gold Rush, one of the prospectors was a Zoroastrian named Cawasji Zaveri; in 1865, New York’s Evening Post published a letter protesting slavery from a Zoroastrian named Dosabhai Faramji Cama. Other early Zoroastrians include Pestonji Framji Daver, a Parsi who came to San Francisco in 1892, and the first recorded Irani Zoroastrian,Rostam Kermani, who settled in the United States in 1926. It is believed that the first North American Zoroastrian Association was formed in 1929, when a group of seven Zoroastriansin the New York area gathered in one Phiroze Saklatwala’s living room on November 10, 1929.

==Overview==
The oldest fire temple in the United States was one purchased by Arbab Rustam Guiv in New Rochelle. The most notable fire temple in the United States is the Dar-e-Mehr temple located in Pomona, New York. It was purchased in 2001 and subsequently purpose-built with Zoroastriasn tenets and then inaugurated in April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/04/03/zoroastrian-temple-erected-new-york/82588552/|title=Zoroastrian temple erected in New York|website=USAToday.com|access-date=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
In 2006, The United States had the world's third-largest Zoroastrian population at six thousand adherents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/demographics/|title=Zoroastrian Demographics &amp; Group Names|first=K. E.|last=Eduljee|website=www.HeritageInstitute.com|access-date=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on mailing addresses rather than congregations, there are two U.S. counties where Zoroastrians constitute the second-largest religion after Christianity. According to a 2010 census by the [[Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies]], there are also two U.S. counties where Zoroastrians constitute the joint-second-largest religion along with [[Baha'i Faith]], by number of adherents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/06/04/the-second-largest-religion-in-each-state/|title=The second-largest religion in each state|first=Reid|last=Wilson|date=June 4, 2014|website=WashingtonPost.com|access-date=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Federation of Zoroastrian Associations of North America]] (FEZANA) is based in the United States and also quarterly publishes the ''Fezana Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;Hinnells, John R.
