The term ''{{lang|la|anno Domini}}'' is [[Medieval Latin]] and means "in the year of the Lord",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/Anno%20Domini |title=Anno Domini |encyclopedia=Merriam Webster Online Dictionary |year=2003 |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |quote=Etymology: Medieval Latin, in the year of the Lord |accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is often presented using "our Lord" instead of "the Lord",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Anno+Domini |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=782}} "since AD stands for ''anno Domini'', 'in the year of (Our) Lord'"&lt;/ref&gt; taken from the full original phrase "''anno Domini nostri Jesu Christi''", which translates to "''in the year of our Lord Jesus Christ".

This [[calendar era]] is based on the traditionally reckoned year of the [[annunciation|conception]] or [[Nativity of Jesus|birth]] of [[Jesus of Nazareth]], with ''AD'' counting years from the start of this [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]], and ''BC'' denoting years before the start of the era. There is no [[year zero]] in this scheme, so the year AD&amp;nbsp;1 immediately follows the year 1&amp;nbsp;BC. This dating system was devised in 525 by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] of [[Scythia Minor]], but was not widely used until after 800.&lt;ref name="Teresi1997"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/97jul/zero.htm |authorlink=Dick Teresi |first=Dick |last=Teresi |title=Zero |journal=[[The Atlantic]] |date=July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|pp=778–9}}

The [[Gregorian calendar]] is the most widely used [[calendar]] in the world today. For decades, it has been the unofficial global standard, adopted in the pragmatic interests of international communication, transportation, and commercial integration, and recognized by international institutions such as the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.timeanddate.com/newsletter/all-the-time/a-month-of-sundays5.html |last=Eastman |first=Allan |title=A Month of Sundays |publisher=Date and Time |accessdate=2010-05-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506002355/http://www.timeanddate.com/newsletter/all-the-time/a-month-of-sundays5.html |archivedate=2010-05-06 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, [[English language|English]] followed [[Latin]] usage by placing the "AD" abbreviation before the year number.{{efn|This convention comes from grammatical usage. ''{{lang|la|Anno 500}}'' means "in the year 500"; ''{{lang|la|anno domini 500}}'' means "in the year 500 of Our Lord". Just as "500 in the year" is not good English syntax, neither is 500 AD; whereas "AD 500" preserves syntactic order when translated.&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Manual of Style'' 2010, pp. 476–7; Goldstein 2007, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;}} However, BC is placed after the year number (for example: AD&amp;nbsp;{{CURRENTYEAR}}, but 68&amp;nbsp;BC), which also preserves syntactic order. The abbreviation is also widely used after the number of a [[century]] or [[millennium]], as in "fourth century AD" or "second millennium AD" (although conservative usage formerly rejected such expressions).&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Manual of Style,'' 1993, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; Because BC is the English abbreviation for ''Before Christ'', it is sometimes incorrectly concluded that AD means ''After Death'', i.e., after the death of Jesus. However, this would mean that the approximate 33 years commonly associated with the life of Jesus would neither be included in the BC nor the AD time scales.&lt;ref&gt;Donald P. Ryan, (2000), 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Terminology that is viewed by some as being more neutral and inclusive of non-Christian people is to call this the Current or [[Common Era]] (abbreviated as CE), with the preceding years referred to as Before the Common or Current Era (BCE). [[Astronomical year numbering]] and [[ISO 8601]] avoid words or abbreviations related to Christianity, but use the same numbers for AD years.

== History ==
The ''Anno Domini'' dating system was devised in 525 by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] to enumerate the years in his [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table|Easter table]]. His system was to replace the [[Era of Martyrs|Diocletian era]] that had been used in an old [[Easter table]] because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who [[Diocletianic Persecution|persecuted Christians]].{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=767}} The last year of the old table, Diocletian 247, was immediately followed by the first year of his table, AD 532. When he devised his table, [[Julian calendar]] years were identified by naming the [[consul]]s who held office that year—he himself stated that the "present year" was "the consulship of [[Flavius Anicius Probus Iunior|Probus Junior]]", which was 525 years "since the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161226031734/http://hbar.phys.msu.ru/gorm/chrono/paschata.htm Nineteen year cycle of Dionysius] Introduction and First Argumentum.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Dionysius implied that [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Jesus' incarnation]] occurred 525 years earlier, without stating the specific year during which his birth or conception occurred. "However, nowhere in his exposition of his table does Dionysius relate his epoch to any other dating system, whether consulate, [[Olympiad]], [[Anno Mundi|year of the world]], or [[regnal year]] of Augustus; much less does he explain or justify the underlying date."{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=778}}

[[Bonnie J. Blackburn]] and [[Leofranc Holford-Strevens]] briefly present arguments for 2 BC, 1 BC, or AD 1 as the year Dionysius intended for the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] or [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]]. Among the sources of confusion are:{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|pp=778–9}}
* In modern times, [[incarnation]] is synonymous with the conception, but some ancient writers, such as [[Bede]], considered incarnation to be synonymous with the Nativity.
* The civil or consular year began on [[1 January]] but the Diocletian year began on 29 August (30 August in the year before a Julian leap year).
* There were inaccuracies in the lists of consuls.
* There were confused summations of emperors' regnal years.

It is not known how Dionysius established the year of Jesus's birth. Two major theories are that Dionysius based his calculation on the Gospel of Luke, which states that Jesus was "about thirty years old" shortly after "the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar", and hence subtracted thirty years from that date, or that Dionysius counted back 532 years from the first year of his new table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Teres|first=Gustav|date=October 1984|title=Time computations and Dionysius Exiguus|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1984JHA....15..177T|journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy|volume=15|issue=3|pages=177-188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tøndering, Claus, ''[http://www.tondering.dk/claus/cal/years.php The Calendar FAQ: Counting years]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0umDqPOf2L8C&amp;pg=PA347|last=Mosshammer|first=Alden A|title=The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era|location=Oxford|date=2009|pages=345-347}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It has also been speculated by Georges Declercq&lt;ref&gt;Declercq, Georges, "Anno Domini. The Origins of the Christian Era" Turnhout, Belgium, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; that Dionysius' desire to replace Diocletian years with a calendar based on the incarnation of Christ was intended to prevent people from believing the imminent [[End of the world (religion)|end of the world]]. At the time, it was believed by some that the [[resurrection of the dead]] and end of the world would occur 500 years after the birth of Jesus. The old ''[[Anno Mundi]]'' calendar theoretically commenced with the [[Dating creation|creation of the world]] based on information in the [[Old Testament]]. It was believed that, based on the ''Anno Mundi'' calendar, Jesus was born in the year 5500 (or 5500 years after the world was created) with the year 6000 of the ''Anno Mundi'' calendar marking the end of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Wallraff, Martin: Julius Africanus und die Christliche Weltchronik. Walter de Gruyter, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mosshammer, Alden A.: The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era. Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 254, p. 270, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; ''Anno Mundi'' 6000 (approximately AD 500) was thus equated with the resurrection and the end of the world&lt;ref&gt;Declercq, Georges: Anno Domini. The Origins of the Christian Era. Turnhout Belgium. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; but this date had already passed in the time of Dionysius.

=== Popularization ===
The [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] historian the Venerable Bede, who was familiar with the work of Dionysius Exiguus, used ''Anno Domini'' dating in his ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', completed in 731. In this same history, he also used another [[Latin]] term, ''ante vero incarnationis dominicae tempus anno sexagesimo'' ("in fact in the 60th year before the time of the Lord's incarnation"), equivalent to the English "before Christ", to identify years before the first year of this era.&lt;ref&gt;Bede 731, Book 1, Chapter 2, first sentence.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Dionysius and Bede regarded ''Anno Domini'' as beginning at the incarnation of Jesus, but "the distinction between Incarnation and Nativity was not drawn until the late 9th century, when in some places the Incarnation epoch was identified with Christ's conception, i.e., the Annunciation on March 25" (''Annunciation style'').{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=881}}

[[File:Charlemagne Agostino Cornacchini Vatican 2.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of [[Charlemagne]] by [[Agostino Cornacchini]] (1725), at [[St. Peter's Basilica]], Vatican City. Charlemagne promoted the usage of the ''Anno Domini'' epoch throughout the [[Carolingian Empire]].]]
On the continent of [[Europe]], ''Anno Domini'' was introduced as the era of choice of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] by the English cleric and scholar [[Alcuin]] in the late eighth century. Its endorsement by Emperor [[Charlemagne]] and [[List of Frankish Kings#Carolingian dynasty|his successors]] popularizing the use of the epoch and spreading it throughout the [[Carolingian Empire]] ultimately lies at the core of the system's prevalence. According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], [[pope]]s continued to date documents according to [[regnal years]] for some time, but usage of AD gradually became more common in [[Roman Catholic]] countries from the 11th to the 14th centuries.&lt;ref name=CathEncy&gt;Patrick, 1908&lt;/ref&gt; In 1422, [[Portugal]] became the last [[Western Europe]]an country to [[Spanish era|switch to]] the system begun by Dionysius.&lt;ref name=CathEncy-Chron &gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eastern Orthodox]] countries only began to adopt AD instead of the [[Byzantine calendar]] in 1700 when [[Russia]] did so, with others adopting it in the 19th and 20th centuries.

Although ''Anno Domini'' was in widespread use by the 9th century, the term "Before Christ" (or its equivalent) did not become common until much later. Bede used the expression ''"anno igitur ante incarnationem Dominicam"'' (so in the year before the incarnation of the Lord) twice. ''"Anno an xpi nativitate"'' (in the year before the birth of Christ) is found in 1474 in a work by a German monk.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Rolevinck]] in ''[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/80248064097793506388868/index.htm Fasciculus temporum]'' (1474) used ''Anno an xpi nativitatem'' (in the ...(th) year before the birth of Christ) for all years between [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] and [[Jesus]]. "xpi" is the [[Greek language|Greek]] χρι in Latin letters, which is an abbreviation for ''Christi''. This phrase appears upside down in the centre of [[recto|recto folios]] (right hand pages). From Jesus to [[Pope Sixtus IV]] he usually used ''Anno Christi'' or its abbreviated form ''Anno xpi'' (on [[verso]] folios—left hand pages). He used ''Anno mundi'' alongside all of these terms for all years.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1627, the French [[Jesuit]] [[theologian]] [[Denis Pétau]] (Dionysius Petavius in Latin), with his work ''De doctrina temporum'', popularized the usage ''ante Christum'' (Latin for "Before Christ") to mark years prior to AD.&lt;ref&gt;

===New year===
{{See|New Year}}
When the reckoning from Jesus' incarnation began replacing the previous dating systems in western Europe, various people chose different Christian feast days to begin the year: [[Christmas]], [[Annunciation]], or [[Easter]]. Thus, depending on the time and place, the year number changed on different days in the year, which created slightly different styles in chronology:&lt;ref&gt;[[C. R. Cheney]], [http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam032/99027383.pdf ''A Handbook of Dates, for students of British history''], Cambridge University Press, 1945–2000, pp. 8–14.&lt;/ref&gt;
* From 25 March 753 [[Ab urbe condita|AUC]] (today in 1 BC), i.e., notionally from the incarnation of Jesus. That first "Annunciation style" appeared in [[Arles]] at the end of the 9th century, then spread to Burgundy and northern Italy. It was not commonly used and was called ''calculus pisanus'' since it was adopted in [[Pisa]] and survived there till 1750.
* From 25 December 753 AUC (today in 1 BC), i.e., notionally from the birth of Jesus. It was called "Nativity style" and had been spread by Bede together with the ''Anno Domini'' in the early Middle Ages. That reckoning of the Year of Grace from Christmas was used in France, England and most of western Europe (except Spain) until the 12th century (when it was replaced by Annunciation style), and in Germany until the second quarter of the 13th century.
* From 25 March 754 AUC (today in AD 1). That second "Annunciation style" may have originated in [[Fleury Abbey]] in the early 11th century, but it was spread by the Cistercians. [[Florence]] adopted that style in opposition to that of Pisa, so it got the name of ''calculus florentinus''. It soon spread in France and also in England where it became common in the late 12th century and lasted until 1752.
* From Easter, starting in 754 AUC (AD 1). That ''mos gallicanus'' (French custom) bound to a [[moveable feast]] was introduced in France by king [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]] (r. 1180–1223), maybe to establish a new style in the provinces reconquered from England. However, it never spread beyond the ruling élite.
With these various styles, the same day could, in some cases, be dated in 1099, 1100 or 1101.

== Birth date of Jesus ==
{{see also|Date of birth of Jesus|Nativity of Jesus#Date of birth|Chronology of Jesus#Year of Jesus' birth}}
The date of birth of Jesus of Nazareth is not stated in the gospels or in any secular text, but most scholars assume a date of birth between 6 BC and 4 BC.&lt;ref name=JDG324 &gt;{{Cite journal | first = James DG | last = Dunn | title = Jesus Remembered | publisher = Eerdmans Publishing | year = 2003 | page = 324}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical evidence is too fragmentary to allow a definitive dating,&lt;ref&gt;Doggett 1992, p579: "Although scholars generally believe that Christ was born some years before AD 1, the historical evidence is too sketchy to allow a definitive dating".&lt;/ref&gt; but the date is estimated through two different approaches – one by analyzing references to known historical events mentioned in the Nativity accounts in the Gospels of Luke and Matthew, and the second by working backwards from the estimation of the start of the [[ministry of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul &gt;[[Paul L. Maier]] "The Date of the Nativity and Chronology of Jesus" in ''Chronos, kairos, Christos: nativity and chronological studies'' by Jerry Vardaman, Edwin M.

==Other eras==
{{further|Calendar era}}
During the first six centuries of what would come to be known as the Christian era, European countries used various systems to count years. Systems in use included [[List of Roman consuls|consular dating]], imperial [[regnal year]] dating, and [[Anno Mundi|Creation dating]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Although the last non-imperial consul, [[Anicius Faustus Albinus Basilius|Basilius]], was appointed in 541 by Emperor [[Justinian I]], later emperors through [[Constans II]] (641–668) were appointed consuls on the first 1 January after their accession. All of these emperors, except Justinian, used imperial post-consular years for the years of their reign, along with their regnal years.&lt;ref&gt;Roger S. Bagnall and Klaas A. Worp, ''[https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/11125 Chronological Systems of Byzantine Egypt]'', Leiden, Brill, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Long unused, this practice was not formally abolished until Novell XCIV of the law code of [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]] did so in 888.

Another calculation had been developed by the [[Alexandria]]n monk [[Annianus of Alexandria|Annianus]] around the year AD 400, placing the Annunciation on 25 March AD 9 (Julian)—eight to ten years after the date that Dionysius was to imply. Although this incarnation was popular during the early centuries of the [[Byzantine Empire]], years numbered from it, an ''Era of Incarnation'', were exclusively used and are yet used, in [[Ethiopia]]. This accounts for the seven- or eight-year discrepancy between the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] and [[Ethiopian calendar]]s. Byzantine chroniclers like [[Maximus the Confessor]], [[George Syncellus]], and [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]] dated their years from Annianus' [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] of the world. This era, called ''[[Anno Mundi]]'', "year of the world" (abbreviated AM), by modern scholars, began its first year on 25 March 5492 BC. Later Byzantine chroniclers used ''Anno Mundi'' years from 1 September 5509 BC, the [[Byzantine calendar|Byzantine Era]]. No single ''Anno Mundi'' epoch was dominant throughout the [[Christian world]]. [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] in his ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicle]]'' used an era beginning with the birth of [[Abraham]], dated in 2016 BC (AD 1 = 2017 Anno Abrahami).&lt;ref&gt;Alfred von Gutschmid, ''Kleine Schriften'', F. Ruehl, Leipzig, 1889, p.433.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain and Portugal continued to date by the [[Era of the Caesars]] or [[Spanish Era]], which began counting from 38 BC, well into the Middle Ages. In 1422, [[Portugal]] became the last Catholic country to adopt the ''Anno Domini'' system.&lt;ref name=CathEncy/&gt;

The [[Era of Martyrs]], which numbered years from the accession of [[Diocletian]] in 284, who launched the last yet most severe [[persecution of Christians]], was used by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Church of Alexandria]] and is still used, officially, by the Coptic Orthodox and [[Coptic Catholic Church|Coptic Catholic]] churches. It was also used by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian]] church. Another system was to date from the [[crucifixion of Jesus]], which as early as [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus]] and [[Tertullian]] was believed to have occurred in the consulate of the Gemini (AD 29), which appears in some [[Middle Ages|medieval]] manuscripts.

The term ''common era'' does not appear in this book; the term ''Christian era'' [lowercase] does appear a number of times. Nowhere in the book is the abbreviation explained or expanded directly.
&lt;/ref&gt; the alternative abbreviations [[Common Era|CE and BCE]], (sometimes written C.E. and B.C.E.) are sometimes used in place of AD and BC.

The "Common/Current Era" ("CE") terminology is often preferred by those who desire a term that does not explicitly make religious references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/ce_info1.htm |author=Robinson, B.A.|title=Justification of the use of "CE" &amp; "BCE" to identify dates.

For example, Cunningham and Starr (1998) write that "B.C.E./C.E. …do not presuppose faith in [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] and hence are more appropriate for [[interfaith dialog]] than the conventional B.C./A.D."&lt;ref name=Cunningham2004&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=ed. by Philip A.|title=Pondering the Passion : what's at stake for Christians and Jews?|year=2004|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|location=Lanham, Md.

The translated term was 西元 ("xī yuán", "Western Era"). Later, in 1949, the [[China|People's Republic of China]] adopted 公元 (''gōngyuán'', "Common Era") for all purposes domestic and foreign.

== No year zero: start and end of a century ==
{{Further|0 (year)|Astronomical year numbering|Millennium|Century}}
In the AD year numbering system, whether applied to the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] or [[Gregorian calendar]]s, AD 1 is preceded by 1 BC. There is no year "0" between them, so a new century begins in a year which has "01" as the final digits (e.g., 1801, 1901, 2001). New millennia likewise are considered to have begun in 1001 and 2001. This is at odds with the common conception that centuries and millennia begin when the trailing digits are zeroes (1800, 1900, 2000, etc.); for example, the [[Millennium celebrations|worldwide celebration of the new millennium]] took place on New Year's Eve 1999, when the year number ticked over to 2000.&lt;ref name="Teresi1997"/&gt;

For computational reasons, [[astronomical year numbering]] and the [[ISO 8601]] standard designate years so that AD 1 = year 1, 1 BC = year 0, 2 BC = year −1, etc.{{efn|To convert from a year BC to [[astronomical year numbering]], reduce the absolute value of the year by 1, and prefix it with a negative sign (unless the result is zero). For years AD, omit the AD and prefix the number with a plus sign (plus sign is optional if it is clear from the context that the year is after the year 0).&lt;ref&gt;Doggett, 1992, p. 579&lt;/ref&gt;}} In common usage, ancient dates are expressed in the Julian calendar, but ISO 8601 uses the Gregorian calendar and astronomers may use a variety of time scales depending on the application. Thus dates using the year 0 or negative years may require further investigation before being converted to BC or AD.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2440">The '''Barsanti-Matteucci engine''' was the first [[internal combustion engine]]. In late 1851 or early 1852 [[Eugenio Barsanti]], a professor of [[mathematics]], and [[Felice Matteucci]], an [[engineer]] and expert in [[mechanics]] and [[hydraulics]], joined forces on a project to exploit the [[explosion]] and [[Thermal expansion|expansion]] of a gaseous mix of [[hydrogen]] and atmospheric air to transform part of the energy of such explosions into [[mechanical energy]].

==Origin==
The idea originated almost ten years earlier with Barsanti when, as a young man, he was teaching at St. Michael's College in [[Volterra]], Italy. An engineer from [[Milan]] Italy, Luigi de Cristoforis, described in a paper published in the acts of the Lombard Royal Institute of Science, Literature and Art, a pneumatic machine (later built and shown to work) that ran on [[naphtha]] and an air mixture, and which constituted the first liquid fuel engine.

==Prototypes==
During the twelve years of collaboration between Barsanti and Matteucci several prototypes of [[internal combustion engine]]s were realized. It was the first real internal combustion engine,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.barsantiematteucci.it/inglese/index.asp&lt;/ref&gt; constituted in its simplest realization by a vertical cylinder in which an explosion of a mixture of [[air]] and [[hydrogen]] or an [[illuminating gas]] shot a [[piston]] upwards thereby creating a [[vacuum]] in the space underneath. When the piston returned to its original position, due to the action of the [[atmospheric pressure]], it turned a toothed rod connected to a [[sprocket]] wheel and transmitted movement to the driving shaft.
  
==Patents==
Numerous [[patent]]s were obtained by the two [[inventor]]s: the 1854 English&lt;ref&gt;http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=GB&amp;NR=185701655A&amp;KC=A&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=3&amp;date=18571201&amp;DB=EPODOC&amp;locale=en_EP&lt;/ref&gt; and Piedmont patents, the 1861 Piedmont patent of Barsanti, Matteucci and Babacci which was then used as a base to construct the engine of the [[Escher Wyss &amp; Cie.|Escher Wyss]] company of [[Zurich]] and put on exhibit during the first National Expo of Florence in 1861, and the 1861 English patent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13003">'''Bold hypothesis''' (or "bold conjecture") is a concept in the philosophy of science of [[Karl Popper]], first explained in his debut ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]''  (1935) and subsequently elaborated in writings such as ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge'' (1963). The concept is nowadays widely used in the [[philosophy of science]] and in the [[philosophy of knowledge]]. It is also used in the social and behavioural sciences.

==Brief explanation==
Popper's argument is that the growth of scientific knowledge progresses by means of formulating ''bold'' hypotheses, and trying to refute (disprove or falsify) them.  Popper believed that:

{{Quotation|"Bold ideas, unjustified anticipations, and speculative thought, are our only means for interpreting nature: our only organon, our only instrument, for grasping her."&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Popper]], ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery''. London: Routledge, 1992, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

He makes this point more specific in a 1953 lecture, where he argues that, if we aim to explain the world, then:

{{Quotation|"... there is no more rational procedure than the method of trial and error – of conjecture and refutation: of boldly proposing theories; of trying our best to show that these are erroneous; and of accepting them tentatively if our critical efforts are unsuccessful. From the point of view here developed, all laws, all theories, remain essentially tentative, or conjectural, or hypothetical, even when we feel unable to doubt them any longer."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, British Council lecture given at Peterhouse, Cambridge, in Summer 1953. Published under the title "Philosophy of Science: a Personal Report" in C. A. Mace (ed.), British Philosophy in Mid-Century: a Cambridge Symposium. London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1966.[https://webfiles.uci.edu/rsmead/PHIL330/Readings/Popper%20-%20Science%20-%20Conjectures%20and%20Refutations.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

A "bold" hypothesis is a new scientific idea which, if it was true, would be able to predict and/or explain a lot, or a lot more, about the subject  being theorized about.  The "boldness" of a hypothesis depends mainly on:
 
*Its scope – the number and variety of phenomena which it could explain, if it is true (its "explanatory power").
*its novelty or originality – the extent to which the hypothesis is a genuinely ''new'' departure from the received scientific ideas.
*whether it enables new and novel predictions ("predictive power"").
*whether it stimulates new, innovative research ("heuristic power").
*Its degree of applicability or usefulness for scientific research ("utility").
*The effect or impact it has on existing scientific thinking, if it is true. 
 
Once a bold hypothesis has been mooted, Popper argues, scientists try to investigate and test how well the bold hypothesis can stand up to the known evidence, with the aim of finding counter-arguments which would refute or falsify the bold hypothesis.  In this process of testing and criticism, new scientific knowledge is generated. Even if the bold hypothesis turns out to have been wrong, testing it generates new knowledge about what can and cannot be the case. Often it stimulates new research.

Inversely, if a hypothesis lacks the quality of boldness, then it would make very little difference to what scientists already know. It is not "a big deal", i.e. it is not very significant for the theory which exists already. It can contribute rather little to advancing scientific progress, because it does not expand or add to scientific understanding very much.

According to Popper,
{{Quotation|"Science does not rest upon solid bedrock. The bold structure of its theories rises, as it were, above a swamp. It is like a building erected on piles. The piles are driven down from above into the swamp, but not down to any natural or ‘given’ base; and if we stop driving the piles deeper, it is not because we have reached firm ground. We simply stop when we are satisfied that the piles are firm enough to carry the structure, at least for the time being." "&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Popper]], The Logic of Scientific Discovery . London: Routledge, 1992, p.94.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

In Popper's philosophy of science, scientific statements are always provisional, they have limits of application, and they could always be wrong. If a statement cannot even in principle be proved wrong, it cannot be a scientific statement. Thus, in Popper's eyes, the [[falsifiability]] criterion clearly demarcates "science" from "[[non-science]]". This Popperian idea has been very controversial, however. The reason is that it can be quite difficult to test scientifically how true a particular idea is. Even if scientists do ''want'' to test an idea, they may not know yet ''how'' exactly to test it conclusively. Yet, scientists also don't want to abandon a hunch that seems useful, simply because they don't know how to verify it yet. This point is especially important for "bold" new hypotheses, because the very "boldness" of the new hypothesis could mean that it would take a lot of work before adequate tests could be designed.

Some philosophers have argued that, in the real world, scientists operate routinely with at least some metaphysical beliefs for which they have no proof or verification whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Amsterdamski, ''Between Experience and Metaphysics''. Dordrecht: Reidel, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Paul Feyerabend]], the creative processes that lead to a scientific discovery are usually quite reasonable and non-arbitrary. However, the creative processes are by no means fully "rational", and they can be quite unique. Thus, the idea that there is one standard model which can define the rationality of all scientific methods should be rejected.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Feyerabend]], ''Against Method'', 3rd edition. London: Verso, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of his later writings, ''Objective Knowledge'' (1972), Popper argued that:

{{Quotation|"A theory is the bolder the greater its content. It is also the riskier: it is the more probable to start with that it will be false. We try to find its weak points, to refute it. If we fail to refute it, or if the refutations we find are at the same time also refutations of the weaker theory which was its predecessor, then we have reason to suspect, or to conjecture, that the stronger theory has no greater falsity content than its weaker predecessor, and, therefore, that it has the greater degree of [[verisimilitude]]".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, ''Objective Knowledge: an evolutionary approach''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1972, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

This interpretation was criticized by Adolf Grünbaum.&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Grünbaum, "Is the Method of Bold Conjectures and Attempted Refutations Justifiably the Method of Science?". ''The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science'', Vol. 27, No. 2 (Jun., 1976), pp. 105–136.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main criticisms==
Popper’s idea of the role of bold hypotheses in scientific progress has attracted three main kinds of criticisms.
*The idea of a bold hypothesis is itself somewhat vague, because exactly "how bold is bold"?&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Cleveland and Paul T. Sagal, "Bold hypotheses: the bolder the better?", in: ''Ratio'', Vol. 2, No. 2, December 1989, pp. 109–121, at p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; It might just depend on how you look at it. Some new ideas, although they are rather modest in themselves, can make a very large difference to the advancement of scientific research. The "boldness" could refer to the ''content'' of the hypothesis (considered relative to other possible hypotheses), or to the manner or context in which the hypothesis is ''presented'', to its importance for research, or to the ''attitude'' involved. It remains somewhat unclear what kinds of criteria we might use, to credit new hypotheses as "bold" or not. A fashionable scientist might be presented as doing new and bold things, while in reality it was more hype than substance.
*[[Imre Lakatos]] argued, that scientists do not aim to test bold hypotheses mainly in order to ''falsify'' them.&lt;ref&gt;Imre Lakatos, "Falsification and the methodology of scientific research programmes".  In: Imre Lakatos &amp; Alan Musgrave (eds.), ''Criticism and the growth of knowledge''. Cambridge University Press, 1970. pp. 91-195.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they aim mainly to ''confirm'' hypotheses.  A falsified conjecture shows the scientist only "what he does not know", whereas the scientist is more interested in what s/he does know, and what s/he ''can'' know. The scientist is interested in gaining ''positive'' new knowledge, which can be used for practical purposes. The scientist is not primarily interested in “knowing that he doesn’t know things” or in "what is not the case" (other than to rule out possibilities). The scientist wants to know what really ''is'' the case. Scientific statements according to this Lakatosian point of view are not ''falsifiable'' statements, but ''fallible'' statements. Fallible statements are simply statements which could be wrong. Fallible statements include ''both'' testable statements ''and'' statements of which it is known that they could be wrong, although currently we do not know how to test them yet for their truth or falsity (or, the possible tests are technically not yet feasible). Thus, scientific statements are fallible statements which scientists ''intend'' or ''aim'' to test for their truth-content. Lakatos did not regard scientific progress simply as a "trial and error" process, but as a process involving definite "do's and don'ts", which he calls "positive heuristics" and "negative heuristics". He believed Popper's philosophy was inconsistent, because Popper claimed definitive falsification was possible, while denying that absolute positive proof of a hypothesis was possible. In Lakatos's view of science, neither is true. There exist no "crucial experiments" which can either prove or disprove a hypothesis definitively.&lt;ref&gt;Imre Lakatos, "The role of crucial experiments in science". In: ''Studies in History and Philosophy of Science'', Part A 4 (4), pp. 309-325, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; All that really happens, is that scientists decide to accept the results of a test as definitive "for all intents and purposes", even though in principle that methodological decision could later on still be proved wrong. 
*Scientific researchers have argued that Popper’s interpretation does not provide a very realistic picture of what most scientists actually do. They argue that Popper focused on the “glamorous” side of scientific work.  In much, if not most, scientific work in the real world, scientists are not mooting bold hypotheses. Instead, they are working patiently on systematic and detailed tests of a small facet of a much larger theory (or a larger research programme). [[Thomas Kuhn]] called this "[[normal science]]". Thus, progress may come about not so much because somebody has a grandiose new idea, but instead because the careful testing of the details of a theory eventually provides definitive scientific conclusions.

Despite these important criticisms, Popper's concept of bold hypotheses continues to be widely used in the academic world. One reason is that, at some level, the concept does make sense, even if (arguably) Popper himself failed to define its role in scientific research very well. Another reason is that academic progress always requires that a scholar does something genuinely new and "breaks new ground". If a scholar only concerns himself with tiny, uncontroversial and fairly trivial claims, he is unlikely to be rewarded very much for his effort. Plausible and credible bold hypotheses are highly valued in the academic world, so long as they are reasonably consistent with well-established scientific findings, and do not seriously challenge scientific authority. 

In the business community, too, [[innovation]] is very important, to find new ways to reduce costs, increase sales, and increase profits.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Freeman &amp; Luc Soete, ''The economics of industrial innovation'', 3rd ed. London: Pinter 1999; Chris Freeman &amp; Francisco Louçã, ''As time goes by''. Oxford University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; A bold new idea can be worth a lot of money, and therefore, business people are often sympathetic to bold attempts to reframe what is known already and to create new ideas; without such innovations, they would eventually be defeated by competitors who have a better idea. So the idea of a bold hypothesis also continues to have a place in economics, management theory and business administration.

The '''calculus of concepts''' is an abstract language and theory, which was developed to simplify the reasons behind effective messaging when delivered to a specific target or set of targets. The theory aims to maximize the likelihood of desired outcomes, by using messaging elements and techniques while analyzing the delivery mechanisms in certain scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cialdini|first=Robert B.|title=Influence : the psychology of persuasion|year=2007|publisher=Collins|location=New York|isbn=006124189X|edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction of uncertainty, but not its elimination, is often cost effective and practical.

Empowered by the [[Internet of Things|internet of things (IoT)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ashton|first=Kevin|title=That 'Internet of Things' Thing - RFID Journal|url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?4986|publisher=RFID Journal|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the framework looks at numerous device such as [[smart phones]], [[tablet computer|tablets]], [[laptops]], hand held gaming devices, GPS devices, automobile Event Data Recorders and other electronic devices as remote sensors capable of providing data channels.&lt;ref name="Hubris"&gt;{{cite web|title=Calculus of Concepts Case Study - February 2013|url=http://www.hubrisanalytics.com/case-studies/CaseStudyFeb2013.pdf|publisher=Hubris Analytics|accessdate=30 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228034548/http://www.hubrisanalytics.com/case-studies/CaseStudyFeb2013.pdf#|archive-date=2013-02-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By using elements, the theory discovers underlying key concepts and their relations to better understand how messages can by used to elicit desired behaviors through mental model [[heuristics]] and [[biases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klien|first=Gary|title=Streetlights and Shadows: Searching for the Keys to Adaptive Decision Making|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0262516721}}&lt;/ref&gt; The framework does not serve up spam to potential consumers; it is a new paradigm for effective messaging. The nature of the data produced and consumed by devices in the IoT naturally lends itself to location-based awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Associati|first=Casaleggio|title=The Evolution of Internet of Things|url=http://www.casaleggio.it/pubblicazioni/Focus_internet_of_things_v1.81%20-%20eng.pdf|publisher=Casaleggio.it|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Just-in-time compilation|Just-in-time]] and real-time broadcasting of key messages gives the framework an extra dimension, putting it at the forefront of behavioral methodologies. Broadcasting can take place across a number of platforms, text, photographic, video, audio or even direct human contact.

The use of anchoring-and-adjustment, framing and representativeness heuristics provides fertile grounds for “re-wiring” the decision making processes to include either positive or mitigating mental models of a given concept or set of related concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lopes|first=Lola L.|title=The Rhetoric of Irrationality}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The “re-wiring” will often produce results that have a significant impact on later decisions and behaviors on the target audience. The framework analyses key factors that influence the effectiveness of messaging mechanisms and how differing approaches can lead to entirely different results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holiday|first=Ryan|title=Trust Me, I'm Lying: Confessions of a Media Manipulator|year=2012|publisher=Portfolio Hardcover|isbn=159184553X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The calculus of concepts framework has been practically implemented utilizing a combination of [[Naive Bayes]] classification&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zhang|first=Harry|title=The Optimality of Naive Bayes|url=http://www.cs.unb.ca/profs/hzhang/publications/FLAIRS04ZhangH.pdf|publisher=University of New Brunswick|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Support Vector Machines]] (SVM) algorithms to actively identify the key components of a messaging campaign and its effectiveness. The effectiveness of a communications campaign is often measured by numerous results including reach, frequency and duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Corinna Cortes|author2=Vladimir Vapnik|title=Machine Learning|date=September 1995|volume=20|issue=3|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF0|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The training data set for the model implementation utilized the potential messages and delivery mechanisms with Actors, Actions, Objects, Contexts and Indicia as a few examples.

Each concept within the framework is treated by the practical implementation as either an independent or dependent variable (as applicable) and therefore may have a meaningful effect on the outcome of any communication. As with any machine-learning tool the Calculus of Concepts model implementation inputs can be either nominal or ordinal and depending on the particular case.

==Practical example==
Between 2005 and 2012 one of the largest oil companies in China attempted to buy the twelfth biggest oil company in Canada. Initial proposals and takeover plans were rejected due to a number of issues surrounding political tensions.

Stakeholders identified Environment, Context, Domain, Event, Condition, State, Decision, Relation, Actor, Action and Object concepts that needed to be in place to have the key decision makers utilizing the mental models needed to secure the takeover.

Over the next 7 years messaging activities were fielded by the Chinese company and its authorized agents, specifically designed to elicit Ideations and Decisions that would result in the takeover going through. In 2012, the takeover was completed after a coordinated and concerted field messaging activity.&lt;ref name="Hubris" /&gt;

[[Image:lichfieldclose.jpg|thumbnail|300px|right|[[Cathedral Close, Lichfield|Lichfield Cathedral Close]]]]
A '''cathedral close''' is the area immediately around a [[cathedral]], sometimes extending for a hundred metres or more from the main cathedral building. In Europe in the Middle Ages, and often later, it was usually all the property of the cathedral and under the bishop or cathedral's legal jurisdiction rather than that of the city. It normally had gates which were locked at night or when there were disturbances in the city, hence the name. It usually included buildings housing diocesan offices, schools, free-standing chapels associated with the cathedral, and the palace of the [[bishop]] and other [[clergy]] houses associated with the cathedral. They sometimes but not necessarily are arranged in a sort of square around a courtyard, as in the close at [[Salisbury Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salisburycathedral.org.uk/file/map-salisbury-cathedral-closejpg-3 map of the close at [[Salisbury Cathedral]]]&lt;/ref&gt; The German term is [[Domfreiheit]].

Today there are often residences of non-clerics, which may include official or prominent persons such as judges' houses. Until recent local government reforms many cathedral closes still functioned as separate administrative unit: [[St. David's]] cathedral close, in [[Pembrokeshire]], counted as a separate civil parish from that of the adjacent village-city for some 50 years after the [[disestablishment]] in Wales. Others still have the secularised former residences of canons but no resident senior clergy. In other cities, such as [[Trier]], property close to the cathedral is occupied by clergy.

==In literature==

The Barchester novels ([[Chronicles of Barsetshire]]) of [[Anthony Trollope]] are set largely in the cathedral close of the fictional town of Barchester.

* [[Testudinology]]--&gt;
[[File:Testudo kleinmanni.jpg|thumb|A [[Negev tortoise]] (''Testudo werneri''), a critically endangered species of [[tortoise]] endemic to the [[Negev Desert]] of Southern [[Israel]].]]
'''Cheloniology''' ({{IPAc-en|k|əl|oʊ|n|iː|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}}), less commonly known as '''testudinology''' ({{IPAc-en|t|ɛ|s|t|uː|d|ɪ|n|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}}), is the scientific study of [[turtles]]. It is a specific branch of [[herpetology]]. The word cheloniology comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''chelone'', "turtle" and ''logos'', "knowledge". Testudinology, on the other hand, comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''testudo'', "tortoise" and the Greek ''logos'', meaning "knowledge". An individual who studies turtles is known as a '''cheloniologist''' or a '''testudinologist'''.

==Fields of study==

Cheloniologists study turtles, which are members of the [[Order (biology)|order]] ''Testudines'' (also called ''Chelonii''{{cn|date=January 2018}}). This includes freshwater turtles, [[sea turtles]], [[tortoises]], and [[terrapins]]. Professionally, members of this order are commonly called '''chelonians''', as opposed to any of the other names previously mentioned. This cuts down on much confusion, as the distinctions between turtles, tortoises, and terrapins are more [[linguistic]] than they are [[biological]]. All are very closely related.

Within cheloniology, scientists study a wide range of topics including chelonian anatomy, behavior, ecology, evolution, disease, conservation, and many others. Cheloniologists may specialize in one or more of these fields, rather than in general cheloniology.

==Background==

Cheloniology is rooted in [[biology]] and [[zoology]], specifically in [[herpetology]]. As degrees in cheloniology itself are unheard of in universities and colleges, cheloniologists commonly have degrees in the above fields, as well as [[biochemistry]], [[paleozoology]], [[marine biology]], and others.

==Discoveries==

Cheloniologists have somewhat recently discovered that chelonians' organs display [[negligible senescence]]. This discovery has prompted researchers to do more investigation into the chelonian [[genome]] and its impacts on longevity.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Phylogeny of extant chelonians==

The following [[phylogeny]] of [[extant taxon|extant]] chelonians is based on the work of Crawford et al. (2015)&lt;ref name="Crawford et al. 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Crawford, Nicholas G. |display-authors=et al. |year=2015 |title=A phylogenomic analysis of turtles |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |volume=83 |issue= |pages=250–257 |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2014.10.021 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790314003819#articles |pmid=25450099}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Guillon et al.

==Conservation of chelonians==

At somewhere between 48 and 54% of all 330 or so chelonian species being threatened, they are at a much higher risk of [[extinction]] than many other [[vertebrates]]. Of the around 250 species of freshwater and terrestrial turtles, 117 species are considered [[Threatened]], 73 are either [[Endangered]] or [[Critically Endangered]] and 1 is Extinct. All 7 species of [[sea turtles]] are endangered, with some considered critically endangered. Of the 58 species belonging to the [[Testudinidae]] [[family (biology)|family]], 33 species are Threatened, 18 are either Endangered or Critically Endangered, 1 is Extinct in the wild and 7 species are Extinct. 71% of all tortoise species are either gone or almost gone. [[Asia|Asian]] species are the most endangered with around 75% being considered threatened,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Hylton |first=H. |title=Keeping U.S. Turtles Out of China |magazine=Time |date=May 8, 2007 |url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1618565,00.html |accessdate=1 November 2012 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; closely followed by the five endemic species from [[Madagascar]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10211">The '''Common Image Generator Interface''' (CIGI) (pronounced sig-ee), is an on-the-wire data protocol that allows communication between an Image Generator and its host simulation.  The interface is designed to promote a standard way for a host device to communicate with an image generator (IG) within the industry. 

CIGI enables plug-and-play by standard-compliant image generator vendors and reduces integration costs when upgrading visual systems.

[[File:Airplane CIGI-communication.jpg|thumb|Sample communication between an Image Generator Host, and a Viewer.]]

== Background ==

Most high-end simulators do not have everything running on a single machine the way popular home software Flight Simulators are currently implemented. The airplane model is run on one machine, normally referred to as the host, and the out the window visuals or scene graph program is run on another, usually referred to as an Image Generator (IG).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mail-archive.com/flightgear-devel@flightgear.org/msg00183.html&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently there are multiple IGs required to display the surrounding environment created by a host.  CIGI is the interface between the 'host' and the IGs. 

The main goal of CIGI is to capitalize on previous investments through the use of a common interface. CIGI is designed to assist suppliers and integrators of IG systems with ease of integration, code reuse, and overall cost reduction.

In the past most image generators provided their own proprietary interface; every host had to implement that interface making changing image generators a costly ordeal. CIGI was created to standardize the interface between the host and the image generator so that little modification would be needed to switch image generators. The CIGI initiative was largely spearheaded by The Boeing Company during the early 21st century.

The latest version of CIGI (CIGI 4.0) was developed by the Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO) in the form of SISO-STD-013-2014, Standard for Common Image Generator Interface (CIGI), Version 4.0, dated 22 August 2014. SISO-STD-013-2014 is freely available from SISO&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sisostds.org/ProductsPublications/Standards/SISOStandards.aspx/&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Definitions ==

'''Image generator''' – In this context an image generator consists of one or more rendering channels that produce an image that can be used to visualize an “Out-The-Window” scene, or images produced by various sensor simulations such as Infra-red, Day TV, Electro-Optical, and Night Vision.

'''Host simulation''' – In this context a “Host” is the computational system that provides information about the device being simulated so that the image generator can portray the correct scenery to the user. This information is passed via CIGI to the image generator.

== Maturation ==

CIGI 4 is the latest version of the standard as was approved by the [[Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization]] on August 22, 2014.  CIGI became an ''international SISO standard'' known as SISO-STD-013-2014; which contains the CIGI version 4.0 Interface Control Document (ICD)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sisostds.org/ProductsPublications/Standards/SISOStandards.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;.

CIGI 4.0 is the official standard, published by [[Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization | SISO]].  Previous versions of CIGI were spearheaded by Boeing include CIGI v3.3&lt;ref&gt;http://cigi.sourceforge.net/specification.php&lt;/ref&gt;,  in November 2008, v3.2&lt;ref&gt;http://cigi.sourceforge.net/files/CIGI_ICD_3_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; April 2006, v3.1&lt;ref&gt;http://cigi.sourceforge.net/files/CIGI_ICD_3_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; June 2004, v3&lt;ref&gt;http://cigi.sourceforge.net/files/CIGI_ICD_3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; November 2003, v2&lt;ref&gt;http://cigi.sourceforge.net/files/CIGI_ICD_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in March 2002, and the original (v1) in March 2001&lt;ref&gt;http://cigi.sourceforge.net/files/CIGI_ICD_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protocol dependencies ==

UDP: Typically, CIGI uses UDP as its transport protocol, but it should be noted that CIGI does not require a specific transport mechanism, only packet definition conformance. CIGI traffic does not have a well known port; however, the use of ports 8004-8005 has been widely adopted by commercial image generator vendors implementations.  [Ref:&lt;ref&gt;https://wiki.wireshark.org/CIGI&lt;/ref&gt;]

== Development Tools ==

=== Host Emulator ===

The ''Host Emulator'' can be used as a surrogate to manipulate the interface when a simulation Host is not available. It is a Windows-based image generator Host application used to develop, integrate and test image generators that use the CIGI protocol. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for the creation, modification and deletion of entities; manipulation of views; control of environmental attributes and phenomena; and other host functions.

The ''Host Emulator'' has several features that are useful for integration and testing. A free-flight mode allows for fixed-wing and rotorcraft flight, movement along entity axes and free rotation using a joystick or a joystick-like widget.  Scripting and record/playback features support regression testing, demonstrations and other tasks needing exact reproduction of certain sequences of events. A packet-level snoop feature allows the user to examine the contents of CIGI messages, image generator response times and latencies.

A ''Heartbeat Monitor'' Window shows a graphical timing history of the Image Generator’s data frame rate. Other features include explicit packet creation, animation control, missile flyouts and a situation display window (Host Emulator 3.x only).

=== Multi-Purpose Viewer ===

The ''Multi-Purpose Viewer'' (MPV) provides the basic functionality expected of an Image Generator, such as loading and displaying a terrain database, displaying entities and so forth. The Multi-Purpose Viewer can be used as a surrogate to manipulate the interface when a real Image Generator is not available. The MPV is capable of operating with both the Windows and Linux operating systems.

=== CIGI Class Library ===

The CCL is an object-oriented software interface that automatically handles message composition and decomposition (i.e. packing, unpacking and byte swapping to the ICD specification) on both the Host and Image Generator sides of the interface. The CCL interprets Host or Image Generator messages based on compile time parameters. It also performs error handling and translation between different versions of CIGI.

Each packet type has its own class. The individual packet members are accessed through packet class accessors. Outgoing messages are constructed by placing each packet into the outgoing buffer using a streaming operator. Incoming messages are parsed using callback or event-based mechanisms that supply the using program with fully populated packet objects.

=== Current tool suite ===

A set of CIGI development tools for the ''Host Emulator'', and ''CIGI Class Library'' were developed by Chas Whitley and members of the SISO CIGI Product Support Group.  The latest packages are available on the RTeng.Pro website at:

=== Wireshark ===

''Wireshark'' is a free and open source packet analyzer. It is used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communications protocol development, and education.  Wireshark provides a dissector for CIGI packets.  As of October 2016, “The CIGI dissector is fully functional for CIGI version 2 and 3. Version 1 is not yet implemented.”&lt;ref&gt;https://wiki.wireshark.org/CIGI&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Older versions of CIGI ===
A CIGI Interface Control Document (ICD) and development suite is available in open source format. The tools, ICD, and accompanying user documentation can be found and downloaded from the [http://cigi.sourceforge.net/ CIGI sourceforge web site].

The sourceforge version of the MPV is limited in its support of CIGI data packets and is intended to grow as needs arise. The MPV uses CIGI 3 as its interface, but the MPV is backward-compatible with earlier CIGI versions through the use of the CCL. The MPV uses the [[OpenSceneGraph | Open Scene Graph]] library to render a scene. The scene graph is manipulated according to the CIGI commands received from the Host via the CCL. The MPV itself is an application layer that consists of a small kernel leveraging heavily on a plug-in architecture for ease of maintainability and flexibility.

An implementer can implement the interface from scratch, however a full suite of integration tools is available. These tools consist of three elements. The ''Host Emulator'' (HE), the ''Multi-Purpose Viewer'' (MPV), and the ''CIGI Class Library'' (CCL).

'''Comparative religion''' is the branch of the [[study of religions]] concerned with the systematic comparison of the doctrines and practices of the world's [[religion]]s. In general the comparative study of religion yields a deeper understanding of the fundamental philosophical concerns of religion such as [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]], and the nature and forms of [[salvation]]. Studying such material is meant to give one a broadened and more sophisticated understanding of human beliefs and practices regarding the [[sacred]], [[numinous]], [[Spirituality|spiritual]], and [[Divinity|divine]].&lt;ref&gt;"Human beings' relation to that which they regard as holy, sacred, spiritual, and divine" [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] (online, 2006), cited after {{cite web |url=http://www.religionfacts.com/religion/quotes.htm |title=Definitions of Religion |website=Religion facts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of comparative religion, a common geographical classification&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt; of the [[Major religious groups|main world religions]] includes [[Religion in the Middle East|Middle Eastern religions]] (including [[Iranian religions]]), [[Indian religions]], [[East Asian religions]], [[African religions]], [[Native American religion|American religions]], [[Religion in Oceania|Oceanic religions]], and 
[[Classical antiquity|classical]] [[Hellenistic religion]]s.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/497215/classification-of-religions/38029/Normative Charles Joseph Adams, ''Classification of religions: geographical'', Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Social scientists in the 19th century took a strong interest in comparative and "primitive" religion through the work of [[Max Müller]], [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], [[William Robertson Smith]], [[James George Frazer]], [[Émile  Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]], and [[Rudolf Otto]].&lt;ref&gt; Hans Kippenberg, ''Discovering Religious History in the Modern Age'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicholas de Lange]], Professor of Hebrew and Jewish Studies at [[Cambridge University]], says that

{{quote|The comparative study of religions is an academic discipline which has been developed within Christian theology faculties, and it has a tendency to force widely differing phenomena into a kind of strait-jacket cut to a Christian pattern. The problem is not only that other 'religions' may have little or nothing to say about questions which are of burning importance for Christianity, but that they may not even see themselves as religions in precisely the same way in which Christianity sees itself as a religion.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas de Lange, ''Judaism'', Oxford University Press, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Geographical classification ==
According to Charles Joseph Adams, in the field of comparative religion, a common geographical classification discerns&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt; the [[Major religious groups|main world religions]] as follows:&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt;

# Middle Eastern religions, including Judaism, Christianity, Islam and a variety of ancient cults; 
# East Asian religions, the religious communities of China, Japan, and Korea, and consisting of Confucianism, Daoism, the various schools of [[Mahayana]] (“Greater Vehicle”) Buddhism, and [[Shinto|Shintō]]; 
# Indian religions, including early Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism, and Zoroastrianism, and sometimes also the [[Theravada]] (“Way of the Elders”) Buddhism and the Hindu- and Buddhist-inspired religions of South and Southeast Asia; 
# African religions, the ancient belief systems of the various indigenous peoples of Africa, excluding [[ancient Egyptian religion]], which is considered to belong to the ancient Middle East;
# American religions, the beliefs and practices of the various Indigenous peoples of the two American continents; 
# Oceanic religions, the religious systems of the peoples of the Pacific islands, Australia, and New Zealand; and 
# Classical religions of ancient Greece and Rome and their Hellenistic descendants.

=== Middle Eastern religions ===
==== Abrahamic or Western Asian religions ====
{{Main|Abrahamic religion|Western religion|Islamic religion}}

In the study of comparative religion, the category of Abrahamic religions consists of the three [[monotheistic]] religions, [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]], which claim [[Abraham]] (Hebrew ''Avraham'' אַבְרָהָם; Arabic ''Ibrahim'' إبراهيم ) as a part of their sacred history. Smaller religions such as [[Bahá'í Faith]] that fit this description are sometimes included but are often omitted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lisar.lss.wisc.edu/welcome/abrahamic.html Why Abrahamic?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070908060636/http://lisar.lss.wisc.edu/welcome/abrahamic.html |date=8 September 2007 }} Lubar Institute for the Study of the Abrahamic Religions at the University of Wisconsin&lt;/ref&gt;

The original belief in the [[One God]] of Abraham eventually became strictly monotheistic present-day [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. Christians believe that Christianity is the [[Supersessionism|fulfillment]] and continuation of the Jewish [[Tanakh|Old Testament]]. Christians believe that [[Jesus]] (Hebrew ''Yeshua'' יֵשׁוּעַ) is the [[Messiah]] (Christ) foretold in the [[Old Testament]] [[prophecy]], and believe in subsequent New Testament revelations based on the divine authority of Jesus in Christian belief (as the [[Incarnation|Incarnation of God]]). Islam believes the present Christian and Jewish scriptures have been [[Tahrif|corrupted]] over time and are no longer the original divine revelations as given to the [[Revelation#Mass revelation|Jewish people]] and to [[Mosaic authorship|Moses]], [[Pauline Christianity|Jesus]], and other prophets. For Muslims, the [[Qur'an]] is the final, complete revelation from [[God]] (Arabic الله ''[[Allah]]''), who believe it to have been [[divine revelation|revealed]] to [[Muhammad]] alone, who is believed by Muslims to be the [[Prophet of Islam|final prophet of Islam]], and the [[Khatam an-Nabiyyin]], meaning the last of the prophets ever sent by Allah ("seal of the prophets").
Based on the Muslim figure of the [[Mahdī]], the ultimate savior of humankind and the final Imām of the Twelve Imams, [[Báb|Ali Muhammad Shirazi]], later known as Bab, created the Bábí movement out of the belief that he was the gate to the Twelfth Imām. This signaled a break with Islam and started a new religious system, [[Bábism]]. However, in the 1860s a split occurred after which the vast majority of Bábís who considered Mirza Husayn `Ali or [[Bahá'u'lláh]] to be Báb's spiritual successor founded the Bahá'í Movement, while the minority who followed Subh-i-Azal came to be called Azalis.&lt;ref&gt;"But the upshot of the whole matter is, that out of every hundred Bábís probably not more than three or four are Ezelís &lt;nowiki&gt;[sic]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, all the rest accepting Behá'u'lláh &lt;nowiki&gt;[sic]&lt;/nowiki&gt; as the final and most perfect manifestation of the Truth." (Browne (1889) [http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/articles/A-E/browne/brbabism.htm p. 351])&lt;/ref&gt; The Bahá'í division eventually became a full-fledged religion of its own, the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. In comparison to the other Abrahamic religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam, the number of adherents for Bahai faith and other minor Abrahamic religions are not very significant.

Out of the three major Abrahamic faiths, [[Christianity and Judaism]] are the two religions that diverge the most in theology and practice.

The historical interaction of [[Islam and Judaism]] started in the 7th century CE with the origin and spread of Islam. There are many common aspects between Islam and Judaism, and as Islam [[History of Islam|developed]], it gradually became the major religion closest to Judaism. As opposed to Christianity, which originated from interaction between ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Roman empire|Roman]], and [[Hebrew]] cultures, Judaism is very similar to Islam in its fundamental religious outlook, structure, jurisprudence and practice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rabbi David Rosen]], [http://rabbidavidrosen.net/doc/Muslim-Jewish%20Relations/Jewish-Muslim%20Relations,%20Past%20&amp;%20Present%20Nov%2003.doc Jewish-Muslim Relations, Past and Present] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616163849/http://rabbidavidrosen.net/doc/Muslim-Jewish%20Relations/Jewish-Muslim%20Relations%2C%20Past%20%26%20Present%20Nov%2003.doc |date=16 June 2007 }}, November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; There are many traditions within Islam originating from traditions within the [[Hebrew Bible]] or from post-biblical Jewish traditions. These practices are known collectively as the ''[[Isra'iliyat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Justin Jaron Lewis, [http://post.queensu.ca/~jjl/islam.html  Islam and Judaism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405102236/http://post.queensu.ca/~jjl/islam.html |date=5 April 2007 }}, October 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical interaction between [[Christianity and Islam]] connects fundamental ideas in Christianity with similar ones in Islam. Islam accepts many aspects of Christianity as part of its faith{{snd}}with some differences in interpretation{{snd}}and rejects other aspects. Islam believes the [[Qur'an]] is the final revelation from [[God]] and a completion of all previous revelations, including the [[Bible]].

==== Iranian religions ====
{{Main|Proto-Indo-Iranian religion|Iranian religions}}

Several important religions and religious movements originated in [[Greater Iran]], that is, among [[Iranian peoples|speakers of various Iranian languages]]. They include [[Mithraism]], [[Ætsæg Din]], [[Yazdanism]], [[Yarsanism|Ahl-e Haqq]], [[Zurvanism]], [[Mandaeism]], [[Manichaeism]], and [[Mazdakism]].

[[Gautama Buddha]] is mentioned as an [[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]] in the [[Puranic]] texts of Hinduism. Most Hindus believe the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] accepted and incorporated many tenets of Hinduism in his doctrine, however, Buddhists disagree and state there was no such thing as Hinduism at the time of Buddha and in fact, "Indeed, it absorbed so many Buddhist traits that it is virtually impossible to distinguish the latter in medieval and later Hinduism."&lt;ref&gt;MLA style:

He writes, "I do not regard Jainism or Buddhism as separate from Hinduism."&lt;ref&gt; P. 17 ''Gandhi'' By Ronald Terchek&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zoroastrianism]] too is an Indian religion and its founder, [[Zarathushtra Spitama]], was a [[Kashmiri Pandit]] born in [[Kashmir]]. [[BON|Yungdrung Bon]] is another Indian religion and its founder, [[Tonpa Shenrab Miwoche]], was born in [[Dardistan]].

=== East Asian or Taoic religions ===
[[File:Tao.svg|thumb|150px|The [[Chinese character]] depicting ''[[Tao]]'', the central concept in Taoism]]

{{Main|East Asian religions|East Asian Buddhism}}
{{See also|Tao|De (Chinese)}}

A Taoic religion is a religion, or religious philosophy, that focuses on the [[East Asian]] concept of ''[[Tao]]'' ("The Way"). This forms a large group of religions including [[Taoism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Jeung San Do]], [[Shinto]], [[I-Kuan Tao]], [[Cheondoism|Chondogyo]], [[Chen Tao (True Way Cult)|Chen Tao]] and [[Cao Dai]]. In large parts of East Asia, [[Buddhism]] has taken on some taoic features.

''Tao'' can be roughly stated to be the flow of the universe, or the force behind the natural order. It is believed to be the influence that keeps the universe balanced and ordered and is associated with nature, due to a belief that nature demonstrates the ''Tao''. The flow of ''[[Ch'i]]'', as the essential energy of action and existence, is compared to the universal order of ''Tao''. Following the ''Tao'' is also associated with a "proper" attitude, morality and lifestyle. This is intimately tied to the complex concept of ''[[De (Chinese)|De]]'', or literally "virtue" or "power." ''De'' is the active expression of ''Tao''.

Taoism and [[Chinese Chán|Ch'an Buddhism]] for centuries had a mutual influence on each other in China, Korea and Vietnam. These influences were inherited by [[Zen Buddhism]] when Ch'an Buddhism arrived in Japan and adapted as Zen Buddhism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4081">'''Conceptual physics''' is an approach to teaching [[physics]] that focuses on the ideas of physics rather than the often daunting mathematics. It is believed that with a strong [[wikt:conceptual|conceptual]] foundation in physics, students are better equipped to understand the equations and formulas of physics, and to make connections between the concepts of physics and their everyday life. Early versions used almost no equations or math-based problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hewett |first=Paul G. |title=Conceptual Physics |edition=5th |publisher=Little, Brown |year=1985 |isbn=0-316-35974-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul G. Hewitt]] popularized this approach with his textbook ''Conceptual Physics: A New Introduction to your Environment'' in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewitt|first=Paul G.|title=Conceptual Physics: A New Introduction to your Environment|publisher=Little, Brown and Co |year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review at the time, Kenneth Ford noted the emphasis on logical reasoning and said "Hewitt's excellent book can be called physics without equations, or physics without computation, but not physics without mathematics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ford|first=Kenneth W.|title=Conceptual Physics: A New Introduction to Your Environment|journal=Physics Today|date=October 1971|volume=24|issue=10|pages=54–55|doi=10.1063/1.3022390|bibcode = 1971PhT....24j..54H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hewitt's wasn't the first book to take this approach. ''Conceptual Physics: Matter in Motion'' by Jae R. Ballif and William E. Dibble was published in 1969.&lt;ref name="BallifDibble1969"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ballif|first1=Jae R.|author2=William E. Dibble|title=Conceptual Physics: Matter in Motion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zq7vAAAAMAAJ|year=1969|publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Hewitt's book became very successful. As of 2014 it is in its twelfth edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewett|first=Paul G.|title=Conceptual Physics|year=2014|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0-321-90910-7|edition=12th}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 Hewitt wrote a version for high school students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewitt|first=Paul G.|title=Conceptual Physics: The High School Physics Program|year=2009|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-133-64749-5|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of the conceptual approach to teaching physics broadened the range of students taking physics in high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hehn|first=Jack|author2=Michael Neuschatz|title=Physics For All? A Million and Counting!|journal=Physics Today|volume=59|issue=2|date=February 2006|pages=37–43|doi=10.1063/1.2186280|url=http://www.aip.org/statistics/trends/reports/million.pdf|bibcode = 2006PhT....59b..37H }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Enrollment in conceptual physics courses in high school grew from 25,000 students in 1987 to over 400,000 in 2009. In 2009, 37% of students took high school physics, and 31% of them were in Physics First, conceptual physics courses, or regular physics courses using a conceptual textbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=Susan|author2=Casey Langer Tesfaye|title=High School Physics Courses and Enrollments|journal=Focus On|date=August 2010|url=http://www.aip.org/statistics/trends/reports/highschool3.pdf|publisher=American Institute of Physics Statistical Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach to teaching physics has also inspired books for science literacy courses, such as ''From Atoms to Galaxies: A Conceptual Physics Approach to Scientific Awareness'' by Sadri Hassani.&lt;ref name="Hassani2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hassani|first=Sadri|title=From Atoms to Galaxies: A Conceptual Physics Approach to Scientific Awareness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oypZ_a9pqdsC|year=2010|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-0849-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Photuris lucicrescens.jpg|thumb|An adult [[firefly]] (''Photuris lucicrescens'') or "lightning bug" &amp;ndash; a crepuscular [[beetle]]]]

'''Crepuscular''' [[animal]]s are those that are active primarily during [[twilight]] (that is, the periods of [[dawn]] and [[dusk]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://naturalhistory.si.edu/mna/glossary.cfm | title = Glossary | work = North American Mammals | publisher = [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]] – [[National Museum of Natural History]] | date = | access-date = July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is distinguished from [[diurnality|diurnal]] and [[nocturnality|nocturnal]] behavior, where an animal is active during the hours of daylight or the hours of darkness, respectively. The term is not precise, however, as some crepuscular animals may also be active on a moonlit night or during an overcast day. The term [[matutinal]] is used for animals that are active only before sunrise, and [[vespertine (biology)|vespertine]] for those active only after sunset.

The time of day an animal is active depends on a number of factors. [[Predation|Predators]] need to link their activities to times of day at which their prey is available, and prey try to avoid the times when their principal predators are at large. The temperature at midday may be too high or at night too low.&lt;ref name=CrepuscularSummary&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/crepuscular-ansc-01/ |title=Crepuscular | encyclopedia = Macmillan Science Library: Animal Sciences | publisher= Macmillan Reference USA |date= 2001–2006 |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some creatures may adjust their activities depending on local competition. Therefore, for many varied reasons, crepuscular activity may best meet an animal's requirements by compromise.

==Etymology and usage==
The word ''crepuscular'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''crepusculum'' ("twilight").&lt;ref name="Winn"&gt;{{Cite book | title=Dictionary of Biological Psychology | first=Philip | last=Winn | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | isbn=0-415-13606-7 | year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its sense accordingly differs from [[diurnality|diurnal]] and [[nocturnality|nocturnal]] behavior, which respectively peak during hours of daylight and darkness. The distinction is not absolute however, because crepuscular animals may also be active on a bright moonlit night or on a dull day. Some animals casually described as nocturnal are in fact crepuscular.&lt;ref name=CrepuscularSummary /&gt;

Special classes of crepuscular behaviour include [[matutinal]] (or "matinal") and [[vespertine (biology)|vespertine]], denoting species active only in the dawn or only in the dusk, respectively. Those that are active during both morning and evening twilight are said to have a [[bimodal activity pattern]].

==Adaptive relevance==
[[File:GluehwuermchenImWald.jpg|thumb|Fireflies at twilight, long exposure]]
The various patterns of activity are thought to be mainly [[antipredator adaptation]]s, though some could equally well be predatory [[adaptation]]s. Many predators [[Foraging|forage]] most intensively at night, whereas others are active at midday and see best in full sun. Thus, the crepuscular habit may both reduce predation pressure, thereby increasing the crepuscular populations, and in consequence offer better foraging opportunities to predators that increasingly focus their attention on crepuscular prey until a new balance is struck. Such shifting states of balance are often found in ecology.

Some predatory species adjust their habits in response to competition from other predators. For example, the subspecies of [[short-eared owl]] that lives on the [[Galápagos Islands]] is normally active during the day, but on islands like [[Santa Cruz Island (Galápagos)|Santa Cruz]] that are home to the [[Galapagos hawk]], the owl is crepuscular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Frederick|first=Prince|title=Night herons in the day!|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2006/04/15/stories/2006041502340100.htm|work=Metro Plus Chennai|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=15 January 2012|date=2006-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Merck|first=John|title=The community of terrestrial animals|url=http://www.geol.umd.edu/~jmerck/GEOL388/lectures/07.html|work=Field Studies II: The Natural History of the Galápagos Islands|publisher=University of Maryland Department of Geology|accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the relevance to predation, crepuscular activity in hot regions also may be the most effective way of avoiding heat stress while capitalizing on available light.

A '''critical edition''' of an opera has been defined by American [[musicologist]] [[Philip Gossett]] as "an edition that bases itself wherever possible on the very finest and most accurate sources for an opera. That means that it must study the entire performance history of a work."&lt;ref name=GAZZ/&gt;

Gossett continues:
:In some cases of course we have an autograph manuscript, and that helps us, but it is also where many of the problems start, because composers are known to have made mistakes in their autograph manuscripts. And therefore we are required—we feel it is necessary—to intervene and to correct errors that sometimes have been perpetrated on these works by printed editions from the beginning, so they are just mistakes in the old editions, simple mistakes.&lt;ref name=GAZZ&gt;Luiz Gazzola, [http://operalively.com/forums/content.php/535-Exclusive-Opera-Lively-Interview-with-Italian-Opera-scholar-Dr-Philip-Gossett "Exclusive ''Opera Lively'' Interview with Italian Opera scholar Dr. Philip Gossett"] on operalively.com. 17 June 2012. Retrieved 26 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of critical editions of many works from the 19th-century Italian operatic repertory did not begin until the 1950s and resulted from the revival of interest from that time forward in the ''[[bel canto]]'' era—early 1800s to approximately 1850 and known as the ''primo ottocento''—written by [[Gioachino Rossini]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], and [[Giuseppe Verdi]], in addition to many other relatively minor composers who composed many works.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Roger (1998), "The 19th and 20th centuries", in Sadie, Vol. Two, pp. 14—16&lt;/ref&gt; But, as musicologist Ellen Rosand also notes, "the editing of operatic works from the 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;Rosand 1998, pp. 11—13&lt;/ref&gt; the 18th century&lt;ref&gt;Rosand 1998, pp 13—14&lt;/ref&gt; and 19th century provides many considerable challenges.

In an online essay – "What is a critical edition?: Answers to Questions You Never Thought to Ask" – which focuses primarily on Rossini, musicologist Patricia Brauner of the Center for Italian Opera Studies at the University of Chicago explains several different aspects of a critical edition, including the process of producing published editions and the ultimate value of them for performers and conductors.&lt;ref&gt;Brauner, [http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/ciao/Introductory/Essays%20from%20CIAO/Rcritical%20edition.html "What is a critical edition?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Musicologist]]s such as Gossett and [[Roger Parker]] represent parallel approaches to the works of the Italian ''bel canto'' era. The former is now General Editor of ''The Critical Edition of the Works of Giuseppe Verdi''&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/ciao/Introductory/Vavail.html Critical editions of Verdi's operas published by the University of Chicago] on humanities.uchicago.edu&lt;/ref&gt; at the University of Chicago's Center for Italian Opera Studies – in addition to being an acknowledged expert in preparing critical editions of the operas of Rossini – while the other is Professor of Music at [[King's College London]] and editor of many of the operas of Donizetti,&lt;ref&gt;Parker, "The Critical Editions of Gaetano Donizetti's Operas" on ricordi.it&lt;/ref&gt; as well as having written extensively on Verdi. He is the founding co-editor (with Arthur Groos) of the ''Cambridge Opera Journal'', and he continues as General Editor (with Gabriele Dotto, who headed the editorial division of Ricordi until 2001) of ''The Critical Edition of the Operas of Gaetano Donizetti'' published by [[Casa Ricordi]] of Milan.

Gossett clarifies how the existence of these editions may affect performances:
:We don’t believe that everybody has to perform just what we do, because that’s not what they did in the nineteenth century, not what composers did or expected, but we do think that performers should base their work on the finest editions possible, and that’s what we try to produce.&lt;ref name=GAZZ/&gt;

The pioneering work of the major Italian music publishing house, [[Casa Ricordi]], reveals how extensive the company's involvement in restoring the work of 19th-century composers Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, and Verdi has been.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.halleonard.com/bin/CatClassicalCriticaleds.pdf Universal Music Publishing Classical Critical Editions] website&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007, the German publishing house [[Bärenreiter|Bärenreiter-Verlag]] has been producing editions of Rossini's operas,&lt;ref&gt;[http://hum.uchicago.edu/orgs/ciao/Introductory/Barenreiter%20plan.htm "Works of Giacchino Rossini"] on hum.uchicago.edu&lt;/ref&gt; having become the successor to the Fondazione Rossini Pesaro, which produced many editions between 1979 and 2005. Today, many are still published by Ricordi in Europe and in the US by the University of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hum.uchicago.edu/orgs/ciao/Introductory/Ravail.html List of critical editions produced under the Fondazione Rossini, 1979 to 2005] on hum.uchicago.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Dormancy}}
'''Diapause''', when referencing animal dormancy, is the delay in development in response to regularly and recurring periods of adverse environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;The Insects; Structure and Function, 4th Edition. R.F. Chapman, Cambridge University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-521-57048-4}}, p 403.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tauber"&gt;Tauber, M.J., Tauber, C.A., Masaki, S. (1986) ''Seasonal Adaptations of Insects''. Oxford University Press, 414 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be a [[physiological]] state of [[dormancy]] with very specific initiating and inhibiting conditions. Diapause is a mechanism used as a means to survive predictable, unfavorable environmental conditions, such as temperature extremes, drought, or reduced food availability. Diapause is most often observed in [[arthropod]]s, especially [[insect]]s, and in the [[embryo]]s of many of the [[oviparity|oviparous]] [[species]] of fish in the order [[Cyprinodontiformes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9254916 |title=A molecular phylogeny for aplocheiloid fishes (Atherinomorpha, Cyprinodontiformes): the role of vicariance and the origins of annualism |author=Glen E. Collier |author2=William J. Murphy |date= August 1997 |quote=Annual aplocheiloid killifish embryos possess a rare ability among vertebrates to enter stages of developmental arrest (diapause) when subjected to adverse environmental conditions. |volume=14 |issue=8 |journal=Mol. Biol. Evol. |pages=790–9 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activity levels of diapausing stages can vary considerably among species. Diapause may occur in a completely immobile stage, such as the [[pupae]] and eggs, or it may occur in very active stages that undergo extensive migrations, such as the adult [[monarch butterfly]], ''Danaus plexippus''. In cases where the insect remains active, feeding is reduced and reproductive development is slowed or halted.

==Phases of insect diapause==
Diapause in insects is a dynamic process consisting of several distinct phases. While diapause varies considerably from one [[taxon]] of insects to another, these phases can be characterized by particular sets of metabolic processes and responsiveness of the insect to certain environmental stimuli.&lt;ref name="Kostal"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kostal |first1= V |year= 2006 |title= Eco-physiological phases of insect diapause |url= |journal= Journal of Insect Physiology |volume= 52 |issue= |pages= 113–127 |doi=10.1016/j.jinsphys.2005.09.008 |pmid=16332347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diapause can occur during any stage of development in arthropods, but each species exhibits diapause in specific phases of development. Reduced oxygen consumption is typical as is reduced movement and feeding.&lt;ref&gt;The Insects; Structure and Function, 4th Edition. R.F. Chapman, Cambridge University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-521-57048-4}}, pp. 403–404&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Polistes exclamans]]'' only the queen is said to be able to undergo diapause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Bohm |first1= |year= 1972 |title= Effects of environment and juvenile hormone on ovaries of the wasp, Polistes metricus |url= |journal= Insect Physiology |volume= 18 |issue= 1 |pages= 1875–1883 |doi= 10.1016/0022-1910(72)90158-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison of diapause periods===
The sensitive stage is the period when stimulus must occur to trigger diapause in the organism.

The induction phase occurs at a genetically predetermined stage of life, and occurs well in advance of the environmental stress.&lt;ref name="Kostal" /&gt; This sensitive stage may occur within the lifetime of the diapausing individual, or in preceding generations, particularly in egg diapause.&lt;ref name="Huffaker"&gt;Huffaker, C.B. and Gutierrez, A.P., Eds. 1999. Ecological Entomology. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; During this phase, insects are responsive to external cues called token stimuli, which trigger the switch from direct development pathways to diapause pathways. Token stimuli can consist of changes in [[photoperiod]], [[thermoperiod]], or [[allelochemicals]] from food plants. These stimuli are not in themselves favourable or unfavourable to development, but they herald an impending change in environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="Tauber" /&gt;

===Preparation===
The preparation phase usually follows the induction phase, though insects may go directly from induction to initiation without a preparation phase.&lt;ref name="Kostal" /&gt; During this phase, insects accumulate and store molecules such as [[lipids]], [[proteins]], and [[carbohydrates]]. These molecules are used to maintain the insect throughout diapause and to provide fuel for development following diapause termination. Composition of the [[cuticle]] may be altered by changing [[hydrocarbon]] composition and by adding [[lipids]] to reduce water loss, making the organism resistant to desiccation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= HEGDEKAR |first1= B. M. |year= 1979 |title= Epicuticular Wax Secretion in Diapause and Non-diapause Pupae of the Bertha Army worm |url= |journal= Annals of the Entomological Society of America |volume= 72 |issue= 1 |pages= 13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Diapausing [[pupa]]ria of the [[flesh fly]], ''Sarcophaga crassipalpis'', increase the amount of cuticular [[hydrocarbons]] lining the puparium, effectively reducing the ability of water to cross the cuticle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Yoder |first1= J.A. |last2= Denlinger |first2= D.L. |last3= Dennis |first3= M.W. |last4= Kolattukudey |first4= P.E. |year= 1992 |title= Enhancement of diapausing flesh fly puparia with additional hydrocarbons and evidence for alkane biosynthesis by a decarbonylation mechanism |url= |journal= Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology |volume= 22 |issue= 3 |pages= 237–243 |doi=10.1016/0965-1748(92)90060-r}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initiation===
[[Photoperiod]] is the most important stimulus initiating diapause.&lt;ref name=Chapman404/&gt; The initiation phase begins when morphological development ceases.&lt;ref name="Kostal" /&gt; In some cases, this change may be very distinct and can involve [[ecdysis|moulting]] into a specific diapause stage, or be accompanied by color change. [[Enzyme|Enzymatic]] changes may take place in preparation for [[cold hardening]]. For example, only diapausing adults of the fire bug, ''Pyrrhocoris apterus'', have the enzymatic complement that allows them to accumulate [[polyol|polyhydric alcohols]], molecules that help to lower their freezing points and thus avoid freezing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kostal |first1= V. |last2= Tollarova |first2= M. |last3= Sula |first3= J. |year= 2004 |title= Adjustments of the enzymatic complement for polyol biosynthesis and accumulation in diapausing cold-acclimated adults of [[Pyrrhocoris apterus]] |url= |journal= Journal of Insect Physiology |volume= 50 |issue= |pages= 303–313 |doi=10.1016/j.jinsphys.2004.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insects may also undergo behavioural changes and begin to aggregate, [[insect migration|migrate]], or search for suitable [[overwinter]]ing sites.[[File:Angangueo monarchs.jpg|thumb|Overwintering [[monarch butterflies]] in diapause clustering on [[oyamel]] trees. One tree is completely covered in butterflies. These butterflies were located on a preserve outside of [[Angangueo]], [[Michoacán]], [[Mexico]]]]

===Maintenance===
During the maintenance phase, insects experience lowered [[metabolism]] and developmental arrest is maintained.&lt;ref name="Kostal" /&gt; Sensitivity to certain stimuli which act to prevent termination of diapause, such as [[photoperiod]] and [[temperature]], is increased. At this stage, insects are unresponsive to changes in the [[natural environment|environment]] that will eventually trigger the end of diapause, but they grow more sensitive to these stimuli as time progresses.

===Termination===
In insects that undergo obligate diapause, termination may occur spontaneously, without any external stimuli.&lt;ref name="Kostal" /&gt; In facultative diapausers, token [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] must occur to terminate diapause. These [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] may include chilling, freezing, or contact with [[water]], depending on the environmental conditions being avoided. These stimuli are important in preventing the insect from terminating diapause too soon, for instance in response to warm [[weather]] in late [[fall]]. In the [[Edith's checkerspot]] butterfly, individuals must receive enough sunlight in order to terminate the diapause stage and become a fully grown butterfly.&lt;ref name="ten"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weiss |first1=Stuart B. |last2=White |first2=Raymond R. |last3=Murphy |first3=Dennis D. |last4=Ehrlich |first4=Paul R. |title=Growth and Dispersal of Larvae of Checkerspot Butterfly Euphydryas editha |journal=Oikos |date=October 1987 |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=161–166 |doi=10.2307/3565996 |jstor=3565996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Termination may occur at the height of unfavourable conditions, such as in the middle of winter. Over time, depth of diapause slowly decreases until direct development can resume, if conditions are favourable.

===Post-diapause quiescence===
Diapause frequently ends prior to the end of unfavourable conditions and is followed by a state of [[wikt:quiescence|quiescence]] from which the insect can arouse and begin direct development, should conditions change to become more favourable.&lt;ref name="Kostal" /&gt; This allows the insect to continue to withstand harsh conditions while being ready to take advantage of good conditions as rapidly as possible.

==Regulation==
Diapause in insects is regulated at several levels. Environmental stimuli interact with genetic pre-programming to affect [[neuron]]al signalling, [[endocrine]] pathways, and, eventually, metabolic and enzymatic changes.

===Environmental===
Environmental regulators of diapause generally display a characteristic [[season|seasonal pattern]]. In [[temperate]] regions, photoperiod is the most reliable cues of seasonal change.&lt;ref name="Huffaker" /&gt; Depending on the season in which diapause occurs, either short or long days can act as token stimuli. Insects may also respond to changing day length as well as relative day length. Temperature may also act as a regulating factor, either by inducing diapause or, more commonly, by modifying the response of the insect to photoperiod.&lt;ref name="Huffaker" /&gt; Insects may respond to thermoperiod, the daily fluctuations of warm and cold that correspond with night and day, as well as to absolute or cumulative temperature. This is has been observed in many moth species including the [[indian mealmoth]], where individuals diapause in different developmental stages due to environmental temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tzanakakis|first=M. E.|date=1959-11-01|title=An ecological study of the Indian-meal mothPlodia interpunctella(Hübner) with emphasis on diapause|url=http://hilgardia.ucanr.edu/Abstract/?a=hilg.v29n05p205|journal=Hilgardia|language=English|volume=29|issue=5|pages=205–246|doi=10.3733/hilg.v29n05p205|issn=0073-2230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food availability and quality may also help regulate diapause. In the [[desert locust]], ''Schistocerca gregaria'', a plant [[hormone]] called [[gibberellin]] stimulates [[reproduction|reproductive]] development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ellis |first1= P.E. |last2= Carlisle |first2= D.B. |last3= Osborne |first3= D.J. |year= 1965 |title= Desert locusts: sexual maturation delayed by feeding on senescent vegetation |url= |journal= Science |volume= 149 |issue= 3683 |pages= 546–547 |doi=10.1126/science.149.3683.546 |pmid=17843190}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the dry season, when their food plants are in [[senescence]] and lacking gibberellin, the locusts remain immature and their reproductive tracts do not develop.

===Neuroendocrine===
The [[neuroendocrinology|neuroendocrine]] system of insects consists primarily of neurosecretory cells in the [[brain]], the corpora cardiaca, corpora allata and the prothoracic glands.&lt;ref name="Tauber" /&gt; There are several key [[hormone]]s involved in the regulation of diapause: [[juvenile hormone]] (JH), diapause hormone (DH), and [[prothoracicotropic hormone|prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH)]].&lt;ref name="Denlinger"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Denlinger |first1= D.L. |year= 2002 |title= Regulation of diapause |url= |journal= Annual Review of Entomology |volume= 47 |issue= |pages= 93–122 |doi= 10.1146/annurev.ento.47.091201.145137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prothoracicotropic hormone stimulates the prothoracic glands to produce [[ecdysteroids]] that are required to promote development.&lt;ref name="Denlinger" /&gt; Larval and pupal diapauses are often regulated by an interruption of this connection, either by preventing release of prothoracicotropic hormone from the brain or by failure of the prothoracic glands to respond to prothoracicotropic hormone.

The corpora allata is responsible for the production of [[juvenile hormone]] (JH). In the bean bug, ''Riptortus pedestris'', clusters of [[neurons]] on the [[protocerebrum]] called the [[pars lateralis]] maintain reproductive diapause by inhibiting JH production by the [[corpora allata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Shimokawa |first1= K. |last2= Numata |first2= H. |last3= Shiga |first3= S. |year= 2008 |title= [[Neurons]] important for the [[photoperiod]]ic control of diapause in the bean bug, ''Riptortus pedestris'' |url= |journal= Journal of Comparative Physiology |volume= 194 |issue= |pages= 751–762 |doi=10.1007/s00359-008-0346-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adult diapause is often associated with the absence of JH, while larval diapause is often associated with its presence.

In adults, absence of JH causes degeneration of flight [[muscles]] and [[atrophy]] or cessation of development of reproductive tissues, and halts mating behaviour. The presence of JH in larvae may prevent moulting to the next larval [[instar]], though successive stationary moults may still occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Yin |first1= C.M. |last2= Chippendale |first2= G.M. |year= 1979 |title= Diapause of the Southwestern Corn Borer, ''Diatraea grandiosella'': further evidence showing juvenile hormone to be the regulator |url= |journal= Journal of Insect Physiology |volume= 25 |issue= |pages= 513–523 |doi=10.1016/s0022-1910(79)80010-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the corn borer, ''Diatraea gradiosella'', JH is required for the accumulation by the fat body of a storage [[protein]] that is associated with diapause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Brown |first1= J.J. |last2= Chippendale |first2= G.M. |year= 1978 |title= Juvenile hormone and a protein associated with the larval diapause of the Southwestern Corn Borer, ''Diatraea grandiosella'' |url= |journal= Insect Biochemistry |volume= 8 |issue= |pages= 359–397 |doi=10.1016/0020-1790(78)90022-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diapause hormone regulates [[embryo]]nic diapause in the eggs of the [[silkworm]] moth, ''Bombyx mori''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Horie |first1= Y. |last2= Kanda |first2= T. |last3= Mochida |first3= Y. |year= 2000 |title= Sorbitol as an arrester of embryonic development in diapausing eggs of the silkworm, ''Bombyx mori'' |url= |journal= Journal of Insect Physiology |volume= 46 |issue= |pages= 1009–1016 |doi=10.1016/s0022-1910(99)00212-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; DH is released from the [[subesophageal ganglion]] of the mother and triggers [[trehalase]] production by the [[ovaries]]. This generates high levels of [[glycogen]] in the [[egg (biology)|eggs]], which is converted into the polyhydric alcohols [[glycerol]] and [[sorbitol]]. [[Sorbitol]] directly inhibits the development of the embryos. [[Glycerol]] and [[sorbitol]] are reconverted into [[glycogen]] at the termination of diapause.

==Tropical diapause==
Diapause in the [[tropics]] is often initiated in response to [[biotic component|biotic]] rather than [[abiotic component]]s.&lt;ref name="DenlingerD"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Denlinger |first1= D.L. |year= 1986 |title= Dormancy in tropical insects |url= |journal= Annual Review of Entomology |volume= 31 |issue= |pages= 239–264 |doi=10.1146/annurev.en.31.010186.001323 |pmid=3510585}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, food in the form of [[vertebrate]] carcasses may be more abundant following dry seasons, or [[oviposition]] sites in the form of fallen [[trees]] may be more available following rainy seasons. Also, diapause may serve to synchronize mating seasons or reduce competition, rather than to avoid unfavourable climatic conditions.

Diapause in the tropics poses several challenges to insects that are not faced in [[temperate]] zones.&lt;ref name="DenlingerD" /&gt; Insects must reduce their metabolism without the aid of cold temperatures and may be faced with increased water loss due to high temperatures. While cold temperatures inhibit the growth of [[fungi]] and [[bacteria]], diapausing tropical insects still have to deal with these [[pathogens]]. Also, [[predation|predator]]s and [[parasitism|parasites]] may still be abundant during the diapause period.

Aggregations are common among diapausing tropical insects, especially in the orders [[Coleoptera]], [[Lepidoptera]], and [[Hemiptera]].&lt;ref name="DenlingerD" /&gt; Aggregations may be used as protection against [[predation]], since aggregating species are frequently toxic and predators quickly learn to avoid them. They can also serve to reduce water loss, as seen in the fungus [[beetle]], ''Stenotarsus rotundus'', which forms aggregations of up to 70,000 individuals, which may be eight beetles deep. [[Relative humidity]] is increased within the aggregations and beetles experience less water loss, probably due to decreased surface area to volume ratios reducing evaporative water loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Yoder |first1= J.A. |last2= Denlinger |first2= D.L. |last3= Wolda |first3= H. |year= 1992 |title= Aggregation promotes water conservation during diapause in the tropical fungus beetle, ''Stenotarsus rotundus'' |url= |journal= Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata |volume= 63 |issue= |pages= 203–205 |doi=10.1111/j.1570-7458.1992.tb01574.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''dramatistic pentad''' forms the core structure of [[dramatism]], a method for examining motivations that the renowned [[literary critic]] [[Kenneth Burke]] developed.  Dramatism recommends the use of a [[metalinguistic]] approach to stories about human action that investigates the roles and uses of five [[rhetoric]]al elements common to all narratives, each of which is related to a question. These five rhetorical elements form the "dramatistic pentad." Burke argues that an evaluation of the relative emphasis that is given to each of the five elements by a human drama enables a determination of the motive for the behaviour of its [[Character (arts)|character]]s. A character's stress on one element over the others suggests their [[world view]].

Burke introduced the pentad in his 1945 book "A Grammar of Motives". Burke based his pentad on the scholastic hexameter which defines "questions to be answered in the treatment of a topic: Who, what, where, by what means, why, how, when".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; Burke created the pentad by combining several of the categories in the scholastic hexameter. The result was a pentad that has the five categories of: act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose. Burke states, "The 'who' is obviously covered by agent. Scene covers the 'where' and the 'when'. The 'why' is purpose. 'How' and 'by what means' fall under agency. All that is left to take care of is act in our terms and 'what' in the scholastic formula".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pentad also closely follows the journalistic '[[Five Ws]]': who, what, when, where, why. 'Who' maps to agent. 'What' maps to action. 'When' and 'Where' map to scene. 'Why' maps to purpose. There is no direct mapping from the Five Ws to the pentads category of agency but Geoff Hart states "Some authorities add a sixth question, “how”, to this list, but “how to” information generally fits under what, where, or when, depending on the nature of the information." &lt;ref&gt;"The Five Ws of Online Help". by Geoff Hart, TECHWR-L. Retrieved April 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetorical elements of the dramatistic pentad==
The dramatistic pentad comprises the five rhetorical elements: Act, Scene, Agent, Agency, and Purpose. The “world views” listed below reflect the prominent schools of thought during Burke’s time, “without dismissing any of them," to read them "at once sympathetically and critically in relation to each other," and "in a wider context than any of them recognizes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fergusson|first1=Francis|title=Kenneth Burke's A Grammar of Motives|date=1957|publisher=Doubleday Anchor Books|location=NY|pages=193–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act===
Act, which is associated with dramatic action verbs and answers the question "what?", is related to the world view of [[Philosophical realism|realism]]; What happened? What is the action? What is going on? What action; what thoughts? Burke defines the act as that which “names what took place, in thought or deed.” Since an act is likely composed of many separate actions, Burke states that “any verb, no matter how specific or general, that has connotations of consciousness or purpose falls under this category.”&lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene===
Scene, which is associated with the [[Setting (fiction)|setting]] of an act and answers the questions "when?" and "where?", is related to the world view of [[materialism]] and minimal or non-existent [[free will]]. Burke defines the scene as “the background of an act, the situation in which it occurred.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agent===
Agent, which answers the question "by whom?", reflects the world view of [[philosophical idealism]]. Burke defines the agent as “what person or kind of person performed the act.” &lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"/&gt;

===Agency===
Agency (means), which is associated with the person or the organization that committed the deed and answers the question "how?", implies a [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] point of view. Burke defines agency as “what instrument or instruments he used.”&lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"/&gt;

===Purpose===
Purpose, which is associated with meaning and answers the question "why?", indicates that the agent seeks unity through identification with an ultimate meaning of life. Reflects the world view of mysticism. Purpose is inextricably linked to the analysis of “Motive” which, derived from the title of A Grammar of Motives, is the main subject of its analysis. Since Purpose is both the subject of analysis and an element of the dramatistic pentad, it is not a common element to be included in a ratio.

==Ratios within the dramatistic pentad==
In A Grammar of Motives, Burke provides a system of analysis for the Scene-Act ratio and the Scene-Agent ratio, though his analysis of ratios in the analysis of rhetoric is not limited to these. He states that, “The principles of dramatic consistency would lead one to expect such cases of overlap among the terms; but while being aware of them we should firmly fix in our minds such cases as afford a clear differentiation. Our terms leaning themselves towards merger and division, we are here trying to divide two of them while recognizing their possibilities of merger.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus any two dramatistic elements can be analyzed in relation to each other, creating a ratio, and can produce individual, yet separate meanings which are equally valid. However, the rhetor’s selection of elements to compose a ratio should be scrutinized, as it can deflect attention away from or direct attention towards aspects of the rhetor’s desire.

This is what Burke calls the “Ubiquity of the Ratios,” claiming that the composition of ratios “are at the very centre of motivational assumptions,” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1307}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, “The maxim ‘terrain determines tactics’ is a strict localization of the scene-act ratio, with ‘terrain’ as the casuistic equivalent for ‘scene’ in a military calculus of motives, and ‘tactics’ as the corresponding ‘act.’"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|page=1308}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The analysis of a situation as a multi-faceted occurrence is central to Burke’s concept of ratios. 
Likewise, the substitution of a dramatistic element with another can change an interpretation of the motive, allowing the analyst to modify the ratio in order to highlight the importance of a specific factor. For example, “the resistance of the Russian armies to the Nazi invasion could be explained ‘scenically’ in terms of the Soviet political and economic structure; or one could use the act-agent ratio, attributing the power and tenacity to ‘Russian’ traits of character. However, in deriving the act from the scene, one would have to credit socialism as a major scenic factor, whereas a derivation of the act from agents would allow for a much more felicitous explanation from the standpoint of capitalist apologists.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rhetor-agent also has a significant amount of power in crafting the perception of these ratios to their effect, “If an agent acts in keeping with his nature as an agent (act-agent ratio), he may change the nature of the scene accordingly (scene-act ratio) and thereby establish a state of unity between himself and his world (scene-agent ratio)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene-Act ratio===
The scene, or the setting, will contain the act, or the what/actions. The way in which the agent interacts with the scene draws out specific analyses usually related to the atmosphere of the setting. While Burke states that, “It is a principle of drama that the nature of acts and agents should be consistent with the nature of the scene,” some “comic and grotesque works may deliberately set these elements at odds with one another, audiences make allowances for such liberty, which reaffirms the same principle of consistency in its very violation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1302}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects the division of most plays into very literal “acts,” as the agents who construct the scene are very literally “acters” whose work is played against the backdrop of the scene.The actions that a person performs are interpreted through the setting or happenings.&lt;ref name="Burke1978"&gt;Burke,Kenneth."Questions and Answers about the Pentad". National Council of Teachers of English, 1978, p. 332-333.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene-Agent ratio===
A relationship between the agent (person) and the scene (place or setting). A scene can pose restrictions on the agent; in a narrative, the person and place should have some connection.&lt;ref name="Burke1978" /&gt;

===Act-Agent ratio===
While requiring the scene to contain them, the agent does not contain the act. Burke states that, “the agent is an author of his acts,” which can “make him or remake him in accordance with their nature.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1309}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the main principles that separates act and agent, producing a linked cycle which constructs the presentation of the agent’s identity.

==A sixth element==
In A Grammar of Motives, Burke mentions that attitude is “a state of mind,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Situation|date=2001|page=1302}}&lt;/ref&gt; remaining exterior from the pentad, as it is often “a preparation for an act, which would make it kind of symbolic act, or incipient act. But in its character as a state of mind that may or may not lead to an act, it is clearly classified under the head of agent.”. Burke also refers to attitude as a variation of agency.&lt;ref name=Anderson2010 /&gt; Prior to 1969 the term attitude is placed under agency, act or agent and is not considered a sixth element.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 476&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969, Burke places attitude as a new sixth element, yet he does not refer to the pentad as a hexad.&lt;ref name="Anderson2010"&gt;Anderson, F. D., &amp; Althouse, M. T. (2010). “Five Fingers or Six? Pentad or Hexad”. KB Journal, 6(2). Retrieved October 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Attitude is defined as "the preparation for an act, which would make it a kind of symbolic act, or incipient act." The attitude, like the agency, would answer the “how?”.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. (1965). “Permanence and Change”. 1954. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill.&lt;/ref&gt; There is still some uncertainty over whether attitude is an additional element, and thus makes the dramatistic pentad a hexad, or if it is still a sub-element of the original pentad.&lt;ref name="Anderson2010" /&gt; While Burke has never directly stated that the pentad is a hexad, he has admitted that the addition of attitude to the pentad is similar to gaining “another soul” or an “extra existence.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew|title=Disciplining The Master: Finding the Via Media for Kenneth Burke|journal=American Communication Journal|date=2001|volume=4|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have read this as Burke’s desire not to “dispose of” ambiguity, but rather to “study and clarify the resources of ambiguity.”&lt;ref name=Anderson2010 /&gt; As a result, many diagrams of the pentad depict attitude as a derivative of agent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4856">The '''floral axis''' (sometimes referred to as the [[Receptacle (botany)|receptacle]]) is the area of the flower upon which the reproductive organs and other ancillary organs are attached. It is also the point at the center of a floral diagram.many flower in angiosperm apear on floral axis. The floral axis can differ in form depending on the type of plant. For example, [[monocotyledon]]s have a weakly developed floral axis compared to [[dicotyledon]]s, and will therefore rarely possess a floral disc, which is common among dicotyledons.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783540136552|title=The Families of the Monocotyledons - Structure, Evolution, and Taxonomy {{!}} R.M.T.

== Floral diagramming ==

[[Floral diagram]]ming is a method used to graphically describe a flower. In the context of floral diagramming, the floral axis represents the center point around which the diagram is oriented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prenner|first=Gerhard|last2=Bateman|first2=Richard M.|last3=Rudall|first3=Paula J.|date=2010|title=Floral Formulae Updated for Routine Inclusion in Formal Taxonomic Descriptions|jstor=27757066|journal=Taxon|volume=59|issue=1|pages=241–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; The floral axis can also be referred to as the receptacle in floral diagrams or when describing the structure of the flower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Donald R.|date=1967-11-01|title=FLORAL MORPHOLOGY, ORGANOGENESIS AND INTERPRETATION OF THE INFERIOR OVARY IN DOWNINGIA BACIGALUPII|journal=American Journal of Botany|language=en|volume=54|issue=10|pages=1274–1290|doi=10.1002/j.1537-2197.1967.tb10765.x|issn=1537-2197}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main or mother axis in floral diagrams is not synonymous with the floral axis, rather it refers to where the stem of the flower is in relation to the diagram. The floral axis is also useful for identifying the type of symmetry that a flower exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jesson LK, Barrett SC | title = The genetics of mirror-image flowers | journal = Proceedings: Biological Sciences | volume = 269 | issue = 1502 | pages = 1835–9 | date = September 2002 | pmid = 12350272 | pmc = 1691103 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2002.2068 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
The floral axis serves as the attachment point for organs of the flower, such as the reproductive organs (pistil and stamen) and other organs such as the sepals and carpels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/floral-axis|title=Floral axis {{!}} plant anatomy|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The floral axis acts much like a [[Aerial stem modification|modified stem]] and births the organs that are attached to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCoy|first=Ralph W.|date=1940-10-01|title=FLORAL ORGANOGENESIS IN FRASERA CAROLINENSIS|journal=American Journal of Botany|language=en|volume=27|issue=8|pages=600–609|doi=10.1002/j.1537-2197.1940.tb10921.x|issn=1537-2197}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fusion of a plant's organs and the amount of organs that are developed from the floral axis largely depends on the determinateness of the floral axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schaffner|first=John H.|date=1937|title=The Fundamental Nature of the Flower|jstor=2481128|journal=Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club|volume=64|issue=9|pages=569–582|doi=10.2307/2481128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The floral axis does perform different functions for different types of plants. For instance, with [[dicotyledon]]s, the floral axis acts as a nectary, while that is not the case with [[monocotyledon]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  More specialized functions can also be performed by the floral axis. For example, in the plant ''Hibiscus,'' the floral axis is able to proliferate and produce fruit, rendering processes like self pollination unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bergman|first=H.

== Concept ==
The Four cornerstone model was developed by [[Ayman Sawaf]] and Robert Cooper in 1997.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Emotional Intelligence at the Workplace: A preliminary study of male executives in the Public and Private sector organisations|url = http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/iimiimawp/wp01736.htm|first = Kaushal|last = Geetika|first2 = Dholakia|last2 = Jigisha}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple studies and research carried out in regards to emotional intelligence based on this model revealed a marginal qualitative difference between the public and private sector executives and expand on the usage of this model.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The concept focuses on the fact that creative involvement in a stimulating job, opportunity, or an exciting discussion results in an increase in alertness, emotional energy, and performance. Repetitive and boring tasks on the other hand put the performer in danger of dismay, lack of efficiency and making mistakes. This generates its explanation from the fact that professionalism is based on self-discipline, inner guidance and emotional drive.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://ujdigispace.uj.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10210/5556/E.M.%20VERMEULEN_2001_MA.pdf|title = EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE AS DETERMINANTOF THE IDEAL CHARACTERISTICS TO DELIVER THE BEST SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS|last = MARIA VERMEULEN|first = ELIZABETH|date = August 2001|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = |publisher = UNIVERSITY OF WALES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Four Factors ===
The four cornerstone model is mixed model of [[emotional intelligence]] based on four factors labeled as cornerstones:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pre-Doctoral Graduate Personal Emotional Intelligence Assessment - Sumo Nova|url = http://sumonova.com/pre-doctoral-graduate-personal-emotional-intelligence-assessment/|website = sumonova.com|accessdate = 2015-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aarhat&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Aneesh Kurian|title=Adolescents And Emotional Intelligence: A Critical Analysis|journal=Aarhat Multidisciplinary  International Education Research Journal|date=2013|volume=2|issue=5|url=http://amierj.weebly.com/uploads/1/0/8/0/10800505/ak3.pdf|accessdate=23 September 2015|issn=2278-5655}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Emotional literacy – the ability to identify, respect, and express feelings appropriately. This may include practical intuition, emotional honesty, emotional energy and emotional feedback.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Emotional fitness – consists of trust resilience, authenticity and renewal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Emotional depth – involves applying integrity and core values in influencing others without manipulation or control.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Emotional alchemy – blending and tuning emotions to find opportunities and realization of such opportunities by creativity, cognitive thinking and rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This successful use of bacterial mutagenicity as a screen for carcinogenicity confirmed the use of this methodology as a rapid and efficient test, in comparison to animal testing alone, and led to its further development. The availability of such simpler tests in turn gave rise to greater government oversight and testing of compounds to which the public would be exposed.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''galactic plane''' is the [[plane (geometry)|plane]] on which the majority of a disk-shaped [[galaxy]]'s [[mass]] lies. The directions [[perpendicular]] to the galactic plane point to the '''galactic poles'''. In actual usage, the terms ''galactic plane'' and ''galactic poles'' usually refer specifically to the plane and poles of the [[Milky Way]], in which Planet [[Earth]] is located.

Some [[irregular galaxy|galaxies are irregular]] and do not have any well-defined disk. Even in the case of a [[barred spiral galaxy]] like the Milky Way, defining the galactic plane is slightly imprecise and arbitrary since the stars are not perfectly [[coplanar]]. In 1959, the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] defined the position of the Milky Way's north galactic pole as exactly [[right ascension|RA]] = {{RA|12|49}}, [[declination|Dec]] = {{DEC|27|24}} in the then-used [[B1950]] [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]]; in the currently-used [[J2000]] epoch, after [[precession]] is taken into account, its position is RA {{RA|12|51|26.282}}, Dec {{DEC|27|07|42.01}}. This position is in [[Coma Berenices]], near the bright [[star]] [[Arcturus]]; likewise, the south galactic pole lies in the [[constellation]] [[Sculptor (constellation)|Sculptor]].

The "zero of longitude" of [[Galactic coordinate system|galactic coordinates]] was also defined in 1959 to be at position angle 123° from the north [[celestial pole]]. Thus the zero longitude point on the galactic equator was at {{RA|17|42|26.603}}, {{DEC|−28|55|00.445}} (B1950) or {{RA|17|45|37.224}}, {{DEC|−28|56|10.23}} (J2000), and its J2000 position angle is 122.932°. The [[galactic center]] is located at position angle 31.72° (B1950) or 31.40° (J2000) east of north.

'''Geoduck aquaculture''' or geoduck farming is the practice of cultivating [[geoduck]]s (specifically the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] geoduck, ''[[Panopea generosa]]'') for [[Seafood|human consumption]]. The geoduck is a large edible [[seawater|saltwater]] [[clam]], a [[marine (ocean)|marine]] [[bivalve]] [[mollusk]], that is native to the [[Pacific Northwest]].

Juvenile geoducks are planted or seeded on the ocean floor or substrate within the soft intertidal and subtidal zones, then harvested five to seven years later when they have reached marketable size (about 1&amp;nbsp;kg or 2.2&amp;nbsp;lbs).&lt;ref name="DNR"&gt;{{cite web|title=DNR and Geoduck Aquaculture|url=http://www.dnr.wa.gov/BusinessPermits/Topics/ShellfishAquaticLeasing/Pages/aqr_aqua_geoduck_aquaculture.aspx|publisher=Washington State Department of Natural Resources|accessdate=20 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201022551/http://www.dnr.wa.gov/BusinessPermits/Topics/ShellfishAquaticLeasing/Pages/aqr_aqua_geoduck_aquaculture.aspx|archive-date=2013-02-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are native to the Pacific region and are found from [[Baja California]], through the [[Pacific Northwest]] and [[Southern Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Straus|first=K.M.|last2=Crosson|first2=L.M.|last3=Vadopalas|first3=B|title=Effects of Geoduck Aquaculture on the Environment: A Synthesis of Current Knowledge|url=http://www.dnr.wa.gov/Publications/psl_ac_geoduck_lit_review.pdf|publisher=Washington Sea Grant, University of Washington|accessdate=25 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804093137/http://www.dnr.wa.gov/Publications/psl_ac_geoduck_lit_review.pdf|archive-date=2010-08-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
'''1. [[Washington (state)|Washington State]]'''&lt;br&gt;
Wild geoducks had been harvested in Puget Sound, Washington by residents and visitors for hundreds of years, but it was not until 1970 that the Washington Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) auctioned off the first right to commercially harvest wild geoducks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Habitat Conservation Plan for the Washington State Department of Natural Resources’ Wild Geoduck Fishery|url=http://www.dnr.wa.gov/Publications/aqr_geo_hcp_wildstock_final_july_2008.pdf|publisher=Washington State Department of Natural Resources|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research into the viability of farming geoducks began in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Compre"&gt;{{cite web|last=Feldman|first=K.|last2=Vadopalas|first2=B.|last3=Armstrong|first3=D.|last4=Friedman|first4=C.|last5=Hilborn|first5=R.|last6=Naish|first6=K.|last7=Orensanz|first7=J.|last8=Valero|first8=J|title=Comprehensive Literature Review and Synopsis of Issues Relating to Geoduck (Panopea abrupta) Ecology and Aquaculture Production|url=http://protectourshoreline.org/DNR/ComprehensiveLitReview.pdf|publisher=Washington State Department of Natural Resources|accessdate=20 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203185743/http://protectourshoreline.org/DNR/ComprehensiveLitReview.pdf|archive-date=2016-02-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, the development of hatchery and grow-out methods from brood stock were initiated. By 1996, commercial aquaculture had begun. As of 2011, there were 237 commercial sites operating on 145 ha of privately owned properties (including those leased from other private owners).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dunagan|first=Christopher|title=State requires shoreline programs to incorporate geoduck farming standards|url=http://www.kitsapsun.com/news/2011/feb/21/state-requires-shoreline-programs-to-incorporate/|accessdate=25 August 2012|newspaper=Kitsap Sun|date=21 February 2011|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130127081136/http://www.kitsapsun.com/news/2011/feb/21/state-requires-shoreline-programs-to-incorporate/|archive-date=2013-01-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial geoduck aquaculture has been primarily undertaken within the [[intertidal zone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geoduck Aquaculture|url=http://wdfw.wa.gov/fishing/commercial/geoduck/aquaculture.html|work=Wild Stock Commercial Geoduck Clam Fishery|publisher=Washington Department of Fish and WIldlife|accessdate=27 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005023850/http://wdfw.wa.gov/fishing/commercial/geoduck/aquaculture.html|archive-date=2012-10-05|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial harvesting of wild geoducks began in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muse|first=Ben|title=Management of the British Columbia Geoduck Fishery|url=https://www.cfec.state.ak.us/RESEARCH/divefish/GEODUCKS.PDF|publisher=Alaska Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission|accessdate=21 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716091045/http://www.cfec.state.ak.us/RESEARCH/divefish/GEODUCKS.PDF|archive-date=2009-07-16|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, the cultivation method developed in Washington was adopted in British Columbia by Fan Seafoods Ltd and the Underwater Harvesters Association (UHA), a group of 55 licence holders for geoduck and [[horse clam]] fishery. The UHA used this method to initiate a wild geoduck enhancement program by seeding depleted subtidal areas with cultivated juvenile geoducks thereby ensuring continued supply in the wild. It even invented a mechanical seeder that plants cultured juvenile geoducks on subtidal beds. Through a collaboration agreement between the provincial government's Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), Fan Seafoods Ltd. and UHA, five pilot sites were selected in 1996 to study the feasibility of a geoduck aquaculture venture.&lt;ref name="RES2004"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hand|first=C.|last2=Marcus|first2=K.|title=Potential Impacts of Subtidal Geoduck Aquaculture on the Conservation of Wild Geoduck Populations and the Harvestable TAC in British Columbia|url=http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas/Csas/DocREC/2004/RES2004_131_e.pdf|publisher=Fisheries and Oceans Canada|accessdate=20 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225071416/http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/CSAS/Csas/DocREC/2004/RES2004_131_e.pdf|archive-date=2013-12-25|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the provincial government of B.C. licensed UHA to operate the first commercial geoduck farm on 25.3 ha off [[Hernando Island]].&lt;ref name="Hernando"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rud|first=Jeff|title=B.C.

'''3. Other areas'''&lt;br&gt;
No geoduck aquaculture industry exists in [[Southern Alaska]]&lt;ref name="Alaska"&gt;{{cite web|title=Geoduck Clam|url=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=geoduck.main|publisher=Alaska Department of Fish and Game|accessdate=23 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930020800/http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=geoduck.main|archive-date=2012-09-30|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="Market" /&gt; In [[New Zealand]], [[Cawthron]] recently reported successful attempts at rearing juvenile geoducks.

==Geoduck species and their distribution==
''Panopea generosa'' is the geoduck species that is found in the Pacific Northwest and [[Alaska]]. ''[[Panopea globosa]]'', which is another species in the same genus, ''[[Panopea (mollusc)|Panopea]]'', is harvested in Mexico's [[Gulf of California]].

A small wild geoduck fishery exists in [[New Zealand]] for ''[[Panopea zelandica]]'', the "deepwater clam", and in [[Argentina]] for ''[[Panopea abbreviata]]'', the "southern geoduck". A fifth species, ''[[Panopea japonica]]'', the Japanese geoduck, is found in [[Korea]] and [[Japan]], but there is no viable commercial industry in those countries for this species.&lt;ref name="Compre" /&gt;

[[Biomass (ecology)|Biomass]] densities in Southeast Alaska are estimated by divers then inflated by twenty percent to account for geoducks not visible at the time of survey.&lt;ref name=Rumble2012&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rumble, JM |author2=Hebert, KP |author3=Siddon, CE |title=Estimating Geoduck Harvest Rate and Show Factors in Southeast Alaska |journal=In: Steller D, Lobel L, eds.

==Predators and diseases==
Juvenile geoducks are susceptible to attack from predators in their first year when they have not yet burrowed deeply into the substrate. [[Crab]]s, [[sea star]]s, [[predatory]] [[gastropod]]s, and [[flatfish]]es have been observed to feed on them.&lt;ref name=Compre /&gt; Adult geoducks, which are already buried deep in the substrate, are out of reach of most predators except for [[sea otter]]s&lt;ref name=Alaska /&gt; and humans.

In 2012, no infectious diseases had been observed attacking cultured juvenile geoducks planted in the wild up to that point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bower|first=S.M.|title=Geoduck clam (Panopea abrupta): Anatomy, Histology, Development, Pathology, Parasites and Symbionts: Pathology, Parasites and Symbionts Overview|url=http://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/species-especes/shellfish-coquillages/geopath/pathparaoverview-eng.htm|publisher=Fisheries and Oceans Canada|accessdate=20 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605192051/http://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/species-especes/shellfish-coquillages/geopath/pathparaoverview-eng.htm|archive-date=2012-06-05|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surface abnormalities were observed in wild adult geoducks, but the pathogen or pathogens could not be identified. However, a [[protozoa]]n [[parasite]] (''[[Isonema]]'' sp) was believed to be the causal agent of cultured geoduck [[larva]]e mortalities at a [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] experimental hatchery.&lt;ref&gt;Kent, M.L., R.A.

Journal of Invertebrate Pathology 50: 221229.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production methods==
The Washington Department of Fisheries (WDF) Point Whitney Laboratory pioneered research into the aquaculture of geoducks in 1970.  The initial purpose of developing the techniques was to enhance the wild population that was being depleted by commercial fishing. Their first challenge was inducing spawning from wild adult geoducks brought into the hatchery; the second challenge was the survival of the resulting larvae.&lt;ref name=Compre /&gt; As per 2012, research into improving culture techniques is continuing, however the basic environmental conditions for growth of geoducks have already been established.

The techniques for culturing geoducks is similar to that of other bivalves.  Modifications have been made by both academic and private laboratories through the years.&lt;ref name=Compre /&gt;

===Collection of broodstock===
Geoducks [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] from spring to late summer in the wild, peaking in June and July. Because of this timing, an equal number of male and female clams are collected starting in the early fall when [[gametogenesis]] commences. The clams are placed in [[milk crate]]s and maintained in [[polyethylene]] fish totes supplied with flowing [[seawater]] (10-12&amp;nbsp;°C) for several weeks. [[Microalgae]] is added as feed and regular cleaning is carried out to remove biodeposits.

===Spawning method===
Spawning is initiated by changing the seawater and increasing the amount of microalgae to increase the temperature of the water. The higher temperature and abundant supply of microalgal feed induces spawning in males first, then in females.

===Rearing of larvae===
Fertilized geoduck eggs remain floating in the water column for 16 to 35 days until they [[metamorphose]] and settle on the substrate. As larvae, they are kept at a water temperature of 16&amp;nbsp;°C and supplied with microalgal feed with frequent water changes.

===Growing-out method===
Larvae that are ready to metamorphose are collected and placed in a primary nursery system where water temperature is kept at 15-17&amp;nbsp;°C and supplied with microalgal feed. Metamorphosed larvae are characterized by the development of an attachment mechanism known as [[Byssus|byssal threads]].

Once byssal threads have developed, the clams are moved to a secondary nursery system which contains sand as the [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]]. They are kept here until they are large enough to be moved outdoors.

Tertiary nursery systems are made of large outdoor tanks or totes which have the same sand substrate and flowing seawater.  The clams are kept in these systems until they reach a valve length of 5&amp;nbsp;mm, at which point they are ready to be planted.

===Planting and seeding===
Four to five juvenile geoducks are planted inside [[PVC]] tubes that are "wiggled" into the sandy substrate along the intertidal zone during low tide. The PVC tubes are between 5 and 15&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter, with lengths from 20 to 30&amp;nbsp;cm,  about 7&amp;nbsp;cm of which remain above the substrate. The plastic tubes are covered with a mesh net to protect the clams from predators.  The tubes also serve to retain seawater at low tide, which prevents dehydration of the clams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcsga.org/pub/uploads/Geoduck_Fact_Sheet.pdf |title=page 1 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706191711/http://www.pcsga.org/pub/uploads/Geoduck_Fact_Sheet.pdf |archive-date=2010-07-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After one to two growing seasons when the juvenile geoducks have burrowed themselves deep enough into the substrate to be out of reach of predators, the PVC tubes are removed. Not all tidelands are suitable for geoduck aquaculture.  The sand must be deep and clean, and the water must have the right [[salinity]] and degree of cleanliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleece|first=C.|last2=Waller|first2=D.|last3=Fisher|first3=J.|last4=Vanderpham|first4=J.|last5=Reub|first5=G|title=Programmatic biological evaluation of potential impacts of intertidal geoduck culture facilities to endangered species and essential fish habitat|url=http://protectourshoreline.org/taylor/7BiologicalEvaluation.pdf|publisher=Entrix, Inc.

It should be noted that in Washington State, the aquaculture of geoducks occurs on intertidal lands, whereas in British Columbia, geoducks are cultured in [[subtidal]] areas, which necessitates the growing of juvenile geoducks to at least 12&amp;nbsp;mm instead of 5&amp;nbsp;mm before planting.&lt;ref name=Factsheet05 /&gt; Once planted in the subtidal bed, the area is covered with netting to protect the clams from predators (PVC tubes are not stable in subtidal beds due to strong [[Current (ocean)|currents]]).

===Harvesting===
Mature geoducks are left to grow out until they are large enough to be marketable (1.0&amp;nbsp;kg). This can take from five to seven years. Wild and cultured geoducks are harvested by first loosening the substrate around them using a powerful nozzle that ejects high-pressured water. Once loosened, the clams are collected by hand and placed in [[crate]]s for transport to a processing facility.

===Grading and packing===
Although there is no standard grading system for quality, the color of the [[Siphon (mollusc)|siphon]] (the whiter the better) and the size (up to 1&amp;nbsp;kg) are the main determiners of price.&lt;ref name=Market /&gt; Live geoducks are packed in [[cooler]]s and shipped on the same day they are harvested.

==Economic importance==
The geoduck industry produces an estimated 6000 metric tons of clams annually,&lt;ref name=Market /&gt; of which only about 10-13% come from aquaculture. Washington is the largest producer of wild and cultured geoducks.

While exports to Japan have decreased in recent years because of increasing prices, the market in China is expected to soar.

==Management of the industry==

===British Columbia===
Environmental groups and citizens of British Columbia have voiced their concerns about geoduck aquaculture operations in the Province, even though the industry is still in its preliminary stages. Their main issue has been the lack of peer-reviewed studies on the impact geoduck aquaculture practices will have on the environment.&lt;ref name=Hernando /&gt; Most concerned groups point to the situation in Puget Sound, Washington as an example of the environmental harm posed by geoduck farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.responsibleshellfishfarming.ca/maintable.htm |title=Association for Responsible Shellfish Farming PowerPoint Presentation on Geoducks |access-date=2012-09-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218145201/http://www.responsibleshellfishfarming.ca/maintable.htm |archive-date=2012-02-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other concerns being raised include the destruction of the natural aquatic habitat, washed up waste (such as nets), disease outbreaks, competition with wild species, and "purge fishing" or the removable of all wild geoducks in a specific area prior to the planting of cultured geoducks. This procedure is apparently necessary because of the economics of the industry.&lt;ref name="RES2004" /&gt;

The management of Canada's aquaculture sector is headed by the [[Department of Fisheries and Oceans]]. The department shares this responsibility with 17 other departments and agencies at the federal and provincial levels.

Aquaculture in Canada is regulated by three main acts: the [[Fisheries Act]], [[Navigable Waters Protection Act]], and [[Canadian Environmental Assessment Act]]. Other acts that control aquaculture practices include the [[Land Act]], [[Health of Animals Act]], [[Food and Drugs Act]], [[Pest Control Products Act]], and [[Species at Risk Act]].&lt;ref name="FAO_Canada" /&gt; All of these acts specify regulations at the local, state and federal levels, resulting in a total of 73 rules and regulations for the aquaculture industry; these rules and regulations have been described as being conflicting and contradictory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aims.ca/site/media/aims/aquaculture.pdf |title=Johnson Paper |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203185743/http://www.aims.ca/site/media/aims/aquaculture.pdf |archive-date=2016-02-03 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules and regulations have resulted in the aquaculture industry being described as "one of the most heavily regulated in the world".&lt;ref name="AquaAct"&gt;{{cite news|title=Canadians overwhelmingly support regulated expansion of national aquaculture industry|url=http://www.aquaculture.ca/files/article-2011-04-20.php|accessdate=29 September 2012|newspaper=Canadian Aquaculture Industry Alliance Media Centre|date=April 20, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111214042941/http://www.aquaculture.ca/files/article-2011-04-20.php|archive-date=2011-12-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent survey showed that Canadians support the creation of an Aquaculture Act that specifically addresses the needs of the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aquaculture Act|url=http://bcsga.ca/shellfish-economics/aquaculture-act/|work=Shellfish Economics|publisher=BC Shellfish Growers' Association|accessdate=30 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425194254/http://bcsga.ca/shellfish-economics/aquaculture-act/|archive-date=2012-04-25|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DFO collects fees from aquaculture licences and leases, and receives government funding for its research programs.

To address [[consumer]] concerns regarding unsafe aquaculture practices, the DFO launched the [[Aquaculture Sustainability Reporting Initiative]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/aquaculture/lib-bib/sri-ird/pdf/SRI2011_Jan%2009-12%20_English_.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - SRI2011_Jan 09-12 _English_.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824062636/http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/aquaculture/lib-bib/sri-ird/pdf/SRI2011_Jan%2009-12%20_English_.pdf |archive-date=2012-08-24 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This report backs the [[Federal Sustainable Development Strategy]] implemented in 2010, and aims to provide its citizens with information on the sustainable aquaculture practices that government agencies and the aquaculture industry are undertaking or plan to undertake. There are currently 29 participants in this initiative, coming from different sectors such as [[academia]], the aquaculture industry, government agencies, and [[environmental organization]]s.

The Canadian government and the aquaculture industry demonstrate sustainable practices by several means such as federal ([http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/ongc-cgsb/index-eng.html Canadian General Standards Board]) and third-party [[certification]]s ([[International Organization for Standardization]] for traceability of produce).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Certification|url=http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/sustainable-durable/aquaculture/measuring-certification-eng.htm|work=Aquaculture Sustainability|publisher=Fisheries and Oceans Canada|accessdate=1 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410050257/http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/sustainable-durable/aquaculture/measuring-certification-eng.htm|archive-date=2013-04-10|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Aquaculture Sustainability Reporting Initiative]] is patterned after the  [https://www.globalreporting.org/Pages/default.aspx Global Reporting Initiative], which emphasizes reporting transparency and the accountability of an organization's sustainability performance.

The DFO also recently released [http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/aquaculture/lib-bib/asri-irda/asri-irda-2012-eng.htm#_4.1 Aquaculture in Canada 2012: A Report on Aquaculture Sustainability] in which it outlines its performance in terms of sustainability.  The aquaculture industry has also taken steps to develop a Codes of Practice for sustainable operations that are in line with or exceed international standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada: A Leader in Sustainable Aquaculture|url=http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/aquaculture/ref/Can002-eng.htm|work=Aquaculture|publisher=Fisheries and Oceans Canada|accessdate=30 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605091918/http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/aquaculture/ref/Can002-eng.htm|archive-date=2011-06-05|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of geoduck, the UHA has adopted a labeling system ("Market Approved") to ensure that the geoducks that end up in the market are safe to eat, of approved quality, and not illegally harvested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Market Approved" Product|url=http://www.geoduck.org/market-approved-product_en.html|publisher=Underwater Harvesters' Association|accessdate=20 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114112951/http://www.geoduck.org/market-approved-product_en.html|archive-date=2012-11-14|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DFO plans to undertake geoduck aquaculture in subtidal areas. No geoduck production currently occurs on private tidelands, although conversion of other [[shellfish]] aquaculture ventures operating on tidelands to geoduck is also being considered. There is no large-scale commercial production underway yet; ongoing trial farms are currently being studied and assessed. Although tenures to possible geoduck farm sites have been granted, commercial licences have not been issued, except for the one granted to the UHA.&lt;ref name=Hernando /&gt;

'''Marketing and promotion'''
When promoting its products, the Canadian aquaculture industry touts the environmentally sound practices it observes in producing high-quality fish and shellfish. The [[Canadian Aquaculture Industry Alliance]] recently received backing from the DFO with a $1 M investment to promote awareness of the industry and increase sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Government of Canada backs aquaculture marketing initiative|url=http://www.fishnewseu.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7082:government-of-canada-backs-aquaculture-marketing-initiative&amp;catid=46:world&amp;Itemid=56|accessdate=28 August 2012|newspaper=fishnewseu.com|date=November 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203185743/http://www.fishnewseu.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7082:government-of-canada-backs-aquaculture-marketing-initiative&amp;catid=46:world&amp;Itemid=56|archive-date=2016-02-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Aquaculture Innovation and Market Access Program]] (AIMAP) of the DFO aims to encourage technological innovation in the industry to improve its "global competitiveness and environmental performance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aquaculture Innovation and Market Access Program|url=http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/aquaculture/sustainable-durable/index-eng.htm|work=Aquaculture|publisher=Fisheries and Oceans Canada|accessdate=1 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019225551/http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/aquaculture/sustainable-durable/index-eng.htm|archive-date=2012-10-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the case of geoduck there is no formal marketing and promotion underway. Since its main market is China, this industry has relied on connections between [[Vancouver]]-based export businesses with close ties (especially familial ties) to Hong Kong and [[mainland China]] importers. The UHA however has been promoting geoducks in China with support from the federal government.&lt;ref name=Market /&gt;

===Washington State===
[[Geoduck#Environmental impact|Concerns]] have also been raised regarding the impact of geoduck aquaculture on the natural habitat, particularly in [[Puget Sound]]. Currently, geoduck aquaculture in Puget Sound occupies 80 ha of private tidelands which are either owned by aquaculture companies or leased from other landowners.&lt;ref name="DNR" /&gt; (another report put the area at 141 ha&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Farming geoducks: a mixed bag for tidal critters|url=http://earthfix.opb.org/water/article/geoduck-farming-heddy/|accessdate=23 August 2012|newspaper=Oregon Public Broadcasting|date=6 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616010216/http://earthfix.opb.org/water/article/geoduck-farming-heddy/|archive-date=2012-06-16|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Because geoduck aquaculture occurs on private lands, there is minimal government oversight, and environmental concerns raised by the residents are most often left to the aquaculture companies to address, and in some cases for the courts to arbitrate. The aquaculture companies do create their own environmental codes of conduct and best management practices to address such concerns.&lt;ref name="FAO_USA"&gt;{{cite web|title=USA: Promotion and Management of the Sector|url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/countrysector/naso_usa/en#tcN900E3|work=National Aquatic Sector Overview|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|accessdate=1 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101205047/http://www.fao.org/fishery/countrysector/naso_usa/en#tcN900E3|archive-date=2012-01-01|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state government is considering leasing public aquatic lands (state-owned) specifically for geoduck aquaculture.&lt;ref name="DNR" /&gt; It currently leases 849 ha for aquaculture of other shellfish, such as [[oyster]]s, other kinds of clams, and [[mussel]]s. Fees are collected from aquaculture companies, and the resulting revenue is used to manage and protect public aquatic lands throughout the State. Since its statehood in 1889, Washington had been selling tidelands to private individuals, initially as a source of revenue for the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Puget Sound Public Beaches|url=http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/sea/pugetsound/tour/public_shore.html|publisher=Department of Ecology State of Washington|accessdate=24 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123194307/http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/sea/pugetsound/tour/public_shore.html|archive-date=2011-11-23|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1971, when this practice was stopped, the State had already sold about 60% of public tidelands to private ownership. The state currently owns 1 million ha of aquatic lands.

Several state aquatic land statutes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.wa.gov/Publications/aqr_aqua_rcw_wacs.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Document1 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605152938/http://www.dnr.wa.gov/Publications/aqr_aqua_rcw_wacs.pdf |archive-date=2010-06-05 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; enacted under the [http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/sea/sma/st_guide/intro.html Shoreline Management Act] of 1971 gave authority to the DNR to "foster the commercial and recreational use of the aquatic environment for production of food, fibre, income, and public enjoyment from state-owned aquatic lands under its jurisdiction and from associated waters, and to this end the department may develop and improve production and harvesting of seaweeds and sealife attached to or growing on aquatic land or contained in aquaculture containers..."

Aquaculture is given priority in Washington: "The legislature finds that many areas of the state of Washington are scientifically and biologically suitable for aquaculture development, and therefore the legislature encourages promotion of aquacultural activities, programs, and development with the same status as other agricultural activities, programs, and development within the state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RCW 15.85.010 Legislative Declaration|url=http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=15.85.010|publisher=Washington State Legislature|accessdate=1 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215213437/http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=15.85.010|archive-date=2009-12-15|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the national level in the USA, the [http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/aquaculture/ National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] (NOAA) is the lead agency for aquaculture.  In February 2011, this agency released a draft of the [[National Policy for Sustainable Marine Aquaculture in the United States of America]] that aims to protect but, at the same time, utilize the nation's aquatic resources in a sustainable manner as well as encourage the growth of a sustainable aquaculture industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Draft Aquaculture Policy|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/aquaculture/docs/noaadraftaqpolicy.pdf|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=1 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901081154/http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/aquaculture/docs/noaadraftaqpolicy.pdf|archive-date=2012-09-01|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial aquaculture in Washington is regulated by local, state, and federal government entities, each tasked with different responsibilities. Some of the agencies involved are the [[Environmental Protection Agency]], [[Department of Fisheries and Wildlife]], [[US Army Corps of Engineers]], and the [[Food and Drug Administration]]. The decisions of these agencies are governed by several federal acts, such as the [[Clean Water Act]], [[Lacey Act]], [[Federal Water Pollution Control Act]], and [[Animal Health Protection Act]].&lt;ref name=FAO_USA /&gt;

Because of the concerns raised by residents and environmental groups regarding the ecological impact of geoduck aquaculture on private tidelands, the WDNR has adopted a more cautious approach on leasing state-owned aquatic lands for geoduck aquaculture. In 2003, the State legislature instructed the WDNR to explore the feasibility of a geoduck aquaculture program on state-owned tidelands.&lt;ref name=DNR /&gt; In 2007, the state passed House Bill 2220 on Shellfish Aquaculture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Second Substitute House Bill 2220|url=http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/sea/shellfishcommittee/pdf/2220_Final_Bill.pdf|accessdate=13 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329112419/http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/sea/shellfishcommittee/pdf/2220_Final_Bill.pdf|archive-date=2013-03-29|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, among other things, commissions the Washington Sea Grant (WSG) of the [[University of Washington]] to conduct "a series of scientific research studies that examines the possible effects, including the cumulative effects, of the current prevalent geoduck aquaculture techniques and practices on the natural environment in and around Puget Sound, including the Strait of Juan de Fuca". The research is expected to end on December 1, 2013.  The bill further stipulates that not more than 15 ha of state-owned aquatic land be leased for commercial geoduck aquaculture every year until 2014. It also created the [[Shellfish Aquaculture Regulatory Committee]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Washington Department of Ecology|title=Final Progress Report: House Bill 2220 Shellfish Aquaculture Regulatory Committee|date=December 2008|url=https://fortress.wa.gov/ecy/publications/publications/0806024.pdf|journal=|access-date=2012-09-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910232015/https://fortress.wa.gov/ecy/publications/publications/0806024.pdf|archive-date=2015-09-10|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is composed of government agencies, aquaculture producers (2), concerned environmental organizations (2), and landowners (2). The role of the committee is to recommend guidelines and policies for shellfish aquaculture operations. In 2010, the WDNR tok a further step further by opening a dialogue with stakeholders and the public. They created an online forum on geoduck aquaculture to elicit concerns from residents, environmental groups and geoduck farm owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=State DNR launches web-based forum for public dialog|url=http://www.dnr.wa.gov/ResearchScience/News/Pages/2010_4_22_dnr_forum_launch.aspx|accessdate=20 August 2012|newspaper=Washington State Department of Natural Resources|date=22 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824135443/http://www.dnr.wa.gov/ResearchScience/News/Pages/2010_4_22_dnr_forum_launch.aspx|archive-date=2010-08-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marketing and promotion'''
Half of the geoducks produced in Washington are exported to [[Vancouver|Vancouver, BC]]. before being re-exported to the final markets in China and Hong Kong. The remaining half are exported through [[Seattle, WA]] and [[Anchorage, AK]].&lt;ref name=Market /&gt; These three cities have the best air connections to China and Hong Kong. Even though China is Washington's biggest market for geoduck, there is little promotion from the state's geoduck producers there.&lt;ref name=Market /&gt;

==Washington Sea Grant studies==
In order to address priorities set by the Washington State legislature, the WSG is conducting research on three key areas:

# Geochemical and Ecological Consequences of Disturbances Associated with Geoduck Aquaculture Operations in Washington.
# Cultured-Wild Interactions: Disease Prevalence in Wild Geoduck Populations.
# Resilience of Soft-Sediment Communities after Geoduck Harvest in Samish Bay, Washington State.

The WSG released its most recent progress report in February 2012 on the possible effects of geoduck aquaculture on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsg.washington.edu/research/pdfs/reports/GeoduckReport2011.pdf Geoduck Aquaculture Research Program Interim Progress Report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005100336/http://wsg.washington.edu/research/pdfs/reports/GeoduckReport2011.pdf |date=2013-10-05 }}. February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The preliminary results of some of the studies appear to show that geoduck aquaculture does not negatively affect the natural habitat. One of the studies have been completed, and results showed that the seemingly disruptive nature of harvesting geoducks has no effect on the infaunal [[benthos|benthic community]]. The report suggested that because the infauna are already accustomed to natural disturbances such as wave action and extreme weather conditions, harvesting does not affect them any differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.masoncountydailynews.com/news/news-page/26398-geoduck | title=Reality check: Ecological effects of geoduck aquaculture operations in southern Puget Sound | work=Mason County Daily News | date=March 19, 2012 | accessdate=1 September 2012 | last=VanBlaricom | first=Glenn R. | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325143938/http://www.masoncountydailynews.com/news/news-page/26398-geoduck | archive-date=2012-03-25 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This report, however, has garnered criticisms which point out that the studies are not long-term, so the effect of geoduck aquaculture practices

'''''Heliophysics''''' is an aspect of '''''NASA science''''' that enables understanding the [[sun]], [[heliosphere]], and [[planetary environment]]s as a single connected system. In addition to [[sun|solar processes]], this domain of study includes the interaction of [[solar plasma]] and [[solar radiation]] with Earth, the other planets, and [[milky way galaxy|the galaxy]]. By analyzing the connections between the sun, [[solar wind]], planetary space environments, and human's place in the [[milky way galaxy]], the fundamental physical processes that occur throughout the universe are uncovered. Understanding the connections between the Sun and its planets will allow for predicting the impacts of solar interaction on humans, technological systems, and even the presence of life itself. This is also the stated goal of Science Mission Directorate's Heliophysics Research.&lt;ref name=helionasa&gt;

==Local effects==

Furthermore, ''[[heliophysics]]'' of ''NASA science'' views [[sun|the sun]] as an [[star| active star]], and that the earth is physically located within its [[solar atmosphere|atmosphere]]. This view also encompasses the interaction of the earth's [[geophysics|geophysical properties]] with this active star. For example, the sun' light influences all life and processes on Earth.  It is an energy provider that allows and sustains [[life]] on earth. However, the sun also produces streams of [[charged particles | high energy particles]] known as the [[solar wind]], and radiation that can harm life or alter its evolution. Additionally, under the protective shield of [[earth's magnetic field]] and its atmosphere, NASA science sees the Earth as an island in the universe where life has developed and flourished. The origins and fate of life on Earth are intimately connected to the sun's behavior. Hence, NASA science studies [[Heliophysics]] from this perspective.&lt;ref name=helionasa/&gt;&lt;ref name=pesnell&gt;{{cite journal

==Heliophysics research program==

[[Sun#History_of_observation|Methods have been developed]] to see into the internal workings of the sun and understand how the [[earth's magnetosphere]] responds to [[solar activity]]. Further studies are concerned with exploring the full system of complex interactions that characterize the relationship of the Sun with the [[solar system]]. According to NASA, understanding these connections is especially critical as we contemplate our destiny in the third millennium. Heliophysics is needed to facilitate the accelerated expansion of human experience beyond the confines of our earthly home. Recent advances in technology allow us, for the first time, to realistically contemplate voyages beyond the solar system.&lt;ref name=helionasa/&gt;&lt;ref name=pesnell/&gt;

There are three primary objectives that define the multi-decadal studies needed: &lt;ref name=helionasa/&gt;&lt;ref name=burch/&gt;

* To understand the changing flow of energy and matter throughout the Sun, Heliosphere, and Planetary Environments. 
* To explore the fundamental physical processes of space plasma systems. 
* To define the origins and societal impacts of variability in the Earth-Sun System. 
* A combination of interrelated elements is used to achieve these objectives. They include complementary missions of various sizes; timely development of enabling and enhancing technologies; and acquisition of knowledge through research, analysis, theory, and modeling.

== A variable star ==
Earth is located within the extended atmosphere of a [[magnetic]] [[variable star]] that drives the local [[solar system]] and sustains [[Life|life on Earth]]. The Sun is observed to vary from multiple perspectives. The Sun emits light in the [[infrared]], visible, [[ultraviolet]], and at x-ray energies, and it emits a [[magnetic field]], bulk plasma ([[solar wind|the solar wind]]) and energetic particles moving up to nearly the [[speed of light]], and all of these emissions vary.&lt;ref name=big-q-s/&gt;

The intertwined response of the earth and [[heliosphere]] are studied because this planet is immersed in this unseen yet exotic and inherently dangerous environment. Above the protective cocoon of Earth’s lower atmosphere is a plasma soup composed of electrified and magnetized matter entwined with penetrating radiation and energetic particles. The sun has an impact because modern society depends heavily on a variety of technologies that are susceptible to the extremes of [[space weather]] — severe disturbances of the upper atmosphere and of the near-Earth space environment that are driven by the magnetic activity of the Sun. Strong electrical currents driven in the Earth’s surface during auroral events can disrupt and damage modern electric power grids and may contribute to the corrosion of oil and gas pipelines. &lt;ref name=big-q-s&gt;

==Main focus==

Building on NASA’s rich history of exploration of Earth’s neighborhood and distant planetary systems, we are poised to provide a predictive understanding of our place in the solar system. We do not live in isolation; we are intimately coupled with the Sun and the space environment through Earth’s climate system, our technological systems, the habitability of planets and solar system bodies we plan to explore, and ultimately the fate of Earth itself. Variability in this environment affects the daily activities that constitute the underpinning of modern society, including communication, navigation, and weather monitoring and prediction. Because the space environment matters to humans and their technological systems both on Earth and in space, it is essential as a space-faring Nation that we develop an understanding of these space plasma processes. &lt;ref name=focus&gt;
{{NASA
|article=Focus Areas 
|url=https://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/focus-areas//}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Heliosphere===

Plasmas and their embedded magnetic fields affect the formation, evolution and destiny of planets and planetary systems. The heliosphere shields the solar system from galactic cosmic radiation. Our habitable planet is shielded by its [[magnetic field]], protecting it from solar and cosmic particle radiation and from erosion of the atmosphere by the solar wind. Planets without a shielding magnetic field, such as Mars and Venus, are exposed to those processes and evolve differently. And on Earth, the magnetic field changes strength and configuration during its occasional polarity reversals, altering the shielding of the planet from external radiation sources. &lt;ref name=focus/&gt;

===Magnetospheres===

Determine changes in the Earth's magnetosphere, ionosphere, and upper atmosphere in order to enable specification, prediction, and mitigation of their effects. Heliophysics seeks to develop an understanding of the response of the near-Earth plasma regions to space weather. This complex, highly coupled system protects Earth from the worst solar disturbances while redistributing energy and mass throughout. &lt;ref name=burch/&gt;&lt;ref name=focus/&gt;

===Space environment===

Understand the causes and subsequent evolution of solar activity that affects Earth's space climate and environment. The climate and space environment of Earth are significantly determined by the impact of plasma, particle, and radiative outputs from the Sun. Therefore, it is essential to understand the Sun, determine how predictable solar activity truly is, and develop the capability to forecast solar activity and the evolution of disturbances as they propagate to Earth. &lt;ref name=focus/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10957">The '''Human Security Report Project''' ('''HSRP''') is a [[peace and conflict studies]] research group. The Project is presently based at [[Simon Fraser University]]'s School for International Studies at [[Harbour Centre]] in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada,&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report Project: [http://www.hsrgroup.org/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=342&amp;Itemid=68 About the Project] (accessed March 23, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; having formerly been based at the [[University of British Columbia]]'s [[Liu Institute for Global Issues]] in the Human Security Centre.[[Image:HSRP Logo.png|thumb|Human Security Report Project (HSRP)]]

== Publications and services ==
The Project is known primarily for the ''[[Human Security Report 2005]]'', which provided evidence that, according to the Project's data and definitions, there had been a large decline in the number of [[war]]s, [[genocide]]s, and international crises since the end of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report 2005:  [http://www.humansecurityreport.org/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=34&amp;Itemid=69 The HSR In the News] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516033240/http://www.humansecurityreport.org/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=34&amp;Itemid=69 |date=2008-05-16 }} (accessed May 25, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report 2005: [http://www.humansecurityreport.info/HSR2005_PDF/Overview.pdf Overview] (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Project adopts the 'narrow' conception of [[Human Security]]. The distinction between the 'narrow' and 'broad' concepts of Human Security, is summarized [[Human security#Freedom from Fear vs Freedom from Want and beyond|here]] on the Human Security page.&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction in armed conflict in recent history has been referred to as the [[Long Peace]],&lt;ref name="Gaddis1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gaddis|first=John Lewis|title=The Long Peace: Inquiries Into the History of the Cold War|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-504335-9|url=https://www.amazon.com/Long-Peace-Inquiries-Into-History/dp/0195043359}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freedman2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freedman|first1=Lawrence|title=Stephen Pinker and the long peace: alliance, deterrence and decline|journal=Cold War History|volume=14|issue=4|year=2014|pages=657–672|issn=1468-2745|doi=10.1080/14682745.2014.950243}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is general agreement among experts that the frequency of war has declined since at least the 1950s,&lt;ref name="Freedman2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HSC2013"/&gt; despite a widespread misperception that the world has become more dangerous.&lt;ref name="HSC2013"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Human Security Report 2013: The Decline in Global Violence| author = Human Security Research Group, [[Simon Fraser University]]| date = 2013| access-date = 11 November 2018| url = https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/HSRP_Report_2013_140226_Web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fettweis2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fettweis|first1=Christopher J.|title=Unipolarity, Hegemony, and the New Peace|journal=Security Studies|volume=26|issue=3|year=2017|pages=423–451|issn=0963-6412|doi=10.1080/09636412.2017.1306394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the Project published the ''Human Security Brief 2006'', updating the core global trend data from the 2005 ''Report'', and the ''Human Security Brief 2007''. The 2007 ''Brief'' demonstrated that there had been a sharp decline in the incidence of [[Terrorism|terrorist]] violence (measured in terms of numbers of fatalities) around the world. If fatalities from [[political violence]] against [[civilian]]s perpetrated by [[Non-state actor|non-state groups]] in [[Iraq]] are counted as deaths from terrorism, the decline dated mid-2007. This claim was disputed in a press release from the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]'s [[National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism]] (START).&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Brief 2007: [http://www.humansecuritybrief.info/hsb07_chapter1.pdf Chapter 1- Dying to Lose: Explaining the Decline in Global Terrorism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120005915/http://www.humansecuritybrief.info/hsb07_chapter1.pdf |date=2008-11-20 }} (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;University of Maryland Newsdesk: [http://www.newsdesk.umd.edu/sociss/release.cfm?ArticleID=1667 Terrorism Fatalities Up, Not Down UMD Analysis Disputes New Report] (accessed March 22, 2009). {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621114431/http://www.newsdesk.umd.edu/sociss/release.cfm?ArticleID=1667 |date=June 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, START at that time only had incident data to 2004. Subsequent START reports confirmed the large decline in fatalities from terrorism in 2007. One problem with the START project's dataset is that it counts politically motivated killings of civilians in [[civil war]] by non-state actors as terrorism in some contexts, but not in others.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} In Iraq, for example, such killings are counted as acts of terrorism, but the very large number of comparable killings in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]'s civil wars in the 1990s are not. Subsequent to the publication of the 2007 ''Brief'', the incidence of global terrorism has again increased, with most of the increase being in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]]. Further, the 2007 ''Brief'' suggested positive change in Sub-Saharan Africa's security landscape; the number of conflicts being waged in the region more than halved between 1999 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Brief 2007: [http://www.humansecuritybrief.info/hsb07_chapter2.pdf Chapter 2- Towards A New Peace in Africa?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120000129/http://www.humansecuritybrief.info/hsb07_chapter2.pdf |date=2008-11-20 }} (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In late October 2008, the Project published, in conjunction with the [[World Bank]], the ''miniAtlas of Human Security''.&lt;ref name="atlas of human security"&gt;[http://www.miniatlasofhumansecurity.info/en/ miniAtlas of Human Security] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311073705/http://miniatlasofhumansecurity.info/en/ |date=2009-03-11 }} (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; This publication was produced in three languages and is an "at-a-glance guide to global security issues", using a selection of maps and graphics to illustrate security trends, and is part of the World Bank's ''miniAtlas'' series.&lt;ref name="atlas of human security" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.worldbank.org/ecommerce/catalog/simple-search?has_results_p=1&amp;search_type_to_pass=title&amp;search_text=miniAtlas World Bank miniAtlas Series] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717075252/http://publications.worldbank.org/ecommerce/catalog/simple-search?has_results_p=1&amp;search_type_to_pass=title&amp;search_text=miniAtlas |date=2011-07-17 }} (accessed March 23, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; There have been subsequent translations of the ''miniAtlas'' into Russian, Japanese, and Arabic.

In 2010, the Project launched the ''Human Security Report 2009/2010'' at the [[United Nations]]. Part I of the ''Report'' examines "The Causes of Peace" since the end of [[World War II]]. Part II examines "The Shrinking Costs of War", paying particular attention to "indirect deaths" from war-exacerbated disease and [[malnutrition]]. Part III reviews recent trends in organized violence around the world. A hard copy version of the ''Report'' was published by [[Oxford University Press]] early in 2011. The text of the ''Report'' is freely available online at www.hsrgroup.org.

In addition to its publications, the Project runs several free e-services available in a number of delivery formats:

*[[Human Security Gateway]]
*[http://www.hsrgroup.org/our-work/overview.aspx Human Security Research]

== Funding and collaboration ==
The Project works closely with a number of the world's leading research groups in peace and conflict studies, including:&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report Project: [http://www.hsrgroup.org/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=28&amp;Itemid=56 Partners] (accessed March 23, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Peace Research Institute Oslo]], based in [[Norway]]
*The [[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]], based in [[Sweden]]

It has received funding from a number of governments, including:

*Canada's [[Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade]]
*The [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Department for International Development]]
*The [[Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]
*The [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency]]
*The [[Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs]]

The Project is a principal partner of the [[International Relations and Security Network]].

== Criticism ==

Lack of robust conflict data remains a major problem with all attempts to track conflict numbers and fatality trends. The Uppsala Conflict Data Program's has an acknowledged tendency to undercount fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report 2005: [http://www.humansecurityreport.info/HSR2005_PDF/Part2.pdf Part II- The Human Security Audit] (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; But the tendency to undercount does not obscure trends, and both researchers and policymakers who focus on the causes of war and peace are more concerned with trends––are the number of wars/battle deaths increasing or decreasing?––than in absolute numbers. For [[truth and reconciliation commission]]s, the reverse is true. There are various methodologies that can be used to estimate war deaths––incident-based reporting like that undertaken by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program, nationwide retrospective mortality surveys like those undertaken in Iraq and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and censuses. Each has strengths and weaknesses. Uppsala's methodology is, however, the only one that permits timely annual updates for all conflict-affected countries. There are ongoing debates on the validity of data compiling and counting methodology. Part III of the ''Human Security Report 2009/2010'' contains a discussion of these debates.

The '''Industrial Revolution in Scotland''' was the transition to new manufacturing processes and economic expansion between the mid-eighteenth century and the late nineteenth century. By the start of the eighteenth century, a political union between Scotland and England became politically and economically attractive, promising to open up the much larger markets of England, as well as those of the growing [[British Empire]], resulting in the [[Treaty of Union]] of 1707. There was a conscious attempt among the gentry and nobility to improve [[agriculture in Scotland]]. New crops were introduced and [[enclosure]]s began to displace the [[run rig]] system and free pasture. The economic benefits of union were very slow to appear, some progress was visible, such as the sales of linen and cattle to England, the cash flows from military service, and the tobacco trade that was dominated by Glasgow after 1740. Merchants who profited from the American trade began investing in leather, textiles, iron, coal, sugar, rope, sailcloth, glass-works, breweries, and soap-works, setting the foundations for the city's emergence as a leading industrial center after 1815.

The linen industry was Scotland's premier industry in the eighteenth century and formed the basis for the later cotton, jute, and woolen industries. Encouraged and subsidized by the [[Board of Trustees for Fisheries and Manufactures in Scotland|Board of Trustees]] so it could compete with German products, merchant entrepreneurs became dominant in all stages of linen manufacturing and built up the market share of Scottish linens, especially in the American colonial market. Historians often emphasize that the flexibility and dynamism of the Scottish banking system contributed significantly to the rapid development of the economy in the nineteenth century. At first the leading industry, based in the west, was the spinning and weaving of cotton. After the cutting off of supplies of raw cotton from 1861 as a result of the [[American Civil War]] Scottish entrepreneurs and engineers, and its large stock of easily mined coal, the country diversified into engineering, shipbuilding, and locomotive construction, with steel replacing iron after 1870. As a result, Scotland became a center for engineering, shipbuilding and the production of locomotives.

Scotland was already one of the most urbanized societies in Europe by 1800. Glasgow became one of the largest cities in the world, and known as "the Second City of the Empire" after London. [[History of Dundee|Dundee]] upgraded its harbor and established itself as an industrial and trading center. The industrial developments, while they brought work and wealth, were so rapid that housing, town-planning, and provision for public health did not keep pace with them, and for a time living conditions in some of the towns and cities were notoriously bad, with overcrowding, high infant mortality, and growing rates of tuberculosis. Owners to support government sponsored housing programs as well as self-help projects among the respectable working class. Even with the growth of industry there were insufficient good jobs, as a result, during the period 1841–1931, about two million Scots emigrated to North America and Australia, and another 750,000 Scots relocated to England. By the twenty-first century, there were about as many people who were [[Scottish Canadians]] and [[Scottish American]]s as the five million remaining in Scotland.

[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Adam Smith]]. the "father of modern economics"]]
By the start of the eighteenth century, a political union between Scotland and England became politically and economically attractive, promising to open up the much larger markets of England, as well as those of the growing [[British Empire]]. The [[Parliament of Scotland|Scottish parliament]] voted on 6 January 1707, by 110 to 69 to adopt the [[Treaty of Union]]. It was a full economic union. Most of its 25 articles dealt with economic arrangements for the new state known as "Great Britain". It added 45 Scots to the 513 members of the [[House of Commons of Great Britain]] and 16 Scots to the 190 members of the House of Lords, and ended the Scottish parliament. It also replaced the Scottish systems of currency, taxation and laws regulating trade with laws made in London. England had about five times the population of Scotland at the time, and about 36 times as much wealth.&lt;ref&gt;T. C. Smout, "The Anglo-Scottish Union of 1707. I: The Economic Background", ''Economic History Review'', New Series, Vol. 16, No. 3, pp. 455–67 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2592848 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Major factors that facilitated industrialisation in Scotland included cheap and abundant labour; natural resources that included coal, blackband [[ironstone]] and potential water power; the development of new technologies, among them the [[steam engine]] and markets that would buy Scottish products. Other factors that also contributed to the process included the improvement of transport links, which helped facilitated the movement of goods, an extensive banking system, and the widespread adoption of ideas about economic development with their origins in the [[Scottish Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="Finley2001pp198-9"&gt;R.

===Enlightenment===
{{Main|Scottish Enlightenment}}
In the eighteenth century, the Scottish Enlightenment brought the country to the front of intellectual achievement in Europe.&lt;ref name="HermanTwo"&gt;[[Arthur L. Herman|A. Herman]], ''[[How the Scots Invented the Modern World]]'' (London: Crown Publishing Group, 2001), {{ISBN|0-609-80999-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of the Scottish Enlightenment ranged from intellectual and economic matters to the specifically scientific. Adam Smith developed and published ''[[The Wealth of Nations]],'' the first work of modern economics. It had an immediate impact on British [[economic policy]] and still frames discussions on [[globalisation]] and [[tariff]]s.&lt;ref name="Fry"&gt;M. Fry, ''Adam Smith's Legacy: His Place in the Development of Modern Economics'' (London: Routledge, 1992), {{ISBN|0-415-06164-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Key scientific work included the discoveries of [[William Cullen]], physician and chemist, [[James Anderson of Hermiston|James Anderson]], an [[agronomist]], [[Joseph Black]], [[physicist]] and chemist, and [[James Hutton]], the first modern [[geologist]].&lt;ref name="Repcheck"&gt;J. Repcheck, ''The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of the Earth's Antiquity'' (Cambridge, MA: Basic Books, 2003), {{ISBN|0-7382-0692-X}}, pp. 117–43.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Scottish Enlightenment is traditionally considered to have concluded toward the end of the eighteenth century,&lt;ref name="Magnusson"&gt;{{Citation|last=M. Magnusson |title=Review of James Buchan, ''Capital of the Mind: How Edinburgh Changed the World'' |journal=New Statesman |date=10 November 2003 |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200311100040 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5z3JQonlV?url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200311100040 |archivedate=29 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; disproportionately large Scottish contributions to British science and letters continued for another 50 years or more, thanks to such figures as [[James Hutton]], [[James Watt]], [[William Murdoch]], [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]].&lt;ref&gt;E.

===Agricultural revolution===
{{Main|Scottish Agricultural Revolution}}
[[File:George Heriot Swanston03.jpg|thumb|right|alt=man guiding two horses pushing machine |An 1851 illustration showing the reaping machine developed by [[Patrick Bell]]]]
After the union with England in 1707, there was a conscious attempt among the gentry and nobility to improve agriculture in Scotland. The Society of Improvers was founded in 1723, including in its 300 members dukes, earls, lairds and landlords.&lt;ref name=Mackieetal1991pp288-91&gt;J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, ''A History of Scotland'' (London: Penguin, 1991), {{ISBN|0140136495}}, pp. 288–91.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of the century these changes were limited to tenanted farms in East Lothian and the estates of a few enthusiasts, such as [[John Cockburn (Scottish politician)|John Cockburn]] and [[Sir Archibald Grant, 2nd Baronet|Archibald Grant]]. Not all were successful, with Cockburn driving himself into bankruptcy, but the ethos of improvement spread among the landed classes.&lt;ref name="Whyte2001pp206-7"&gt;I. D. Whyte, "Economy: primary sector: 1 Agriculture to 1770s", in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-211696-7}}, pp. 206–7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hay]]making was introduced along with the English plough and foreign grasses, the sowing of rye grass and clover. Turnips and cabbages were introduced, lands enclosed and marshes drained, lime was put down, roads built and woods planted. Drilling and sowing and [[crop rotation]] were introduced. The introduction of the potato to Scotland in 1739 greatly improved the diet of the peasantry. [[Enclosure]]s began to displace the [[Run rig|runrig]] system and free pasture. There was increasing specialisation, with the Lothians became a major centre of grain, Ayrshire of cattle breading and the borders of sheep.&lt;ref name=Mackieetal1991pp288-91/&gt; Although some estate holders improved the quality of life of their displaced workers,&lt;ref name=Mackieetal1991pp288-91/&gt; the Agricultural Revolution led directly to what is increasingly known as the [[Lowland Clearances]],&lt;ref&gt;Robert Allan Houston and Ian D. Whyte, ''Scottish Society, 1500–1800'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), {{ISBN|0-521-89167-1}}, pp. 148–151.&lt;/ref&gt; when hundreds of thousands of cottars and tenant farmers from central and southern Scotland were forcibly moved from the farms and small holdings their families had occupied for hundreds of years.&lt;ref name=Mackieetal1991pp288-91/&gt; Improvement continued in the nineteenth century. Innovations included the first working [[Reaper|reaping machine]], developed by [[Patrick Bell]] in 1828. His rival [[James Smith (inventor)|James Smith]] turned to improving sub-soil drainage and developed a method of ploughing that could break up the subsoil barrier without disturbing the topsoil. Previously unworkable low-lying carselands could now be brought into arable production and the result was the even Lowland landscape that still predominates.&lt;ref name="Sprott2011"&gt;G. Sprot, "Agriculture, 1770s onwards", in M. Lynch, ed., ''Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0199693056}}, pp. 321–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of Scottish agriculture meant that Scotland could support its increased population with food and it released labour that would take part in industrial production.&lt;ref name="Finley2001pp198-9"/&gt;

===Banking===
[[File:Former British Linen Bank, St. Andrew Square Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The former headquarters of the [[British Linen Bank]] in St Andrews Square, Edinburgh]]
The first banks formed in Scotland were the [[Bank of Scotland]] (Edinburgh, 1695) and the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] (Edinburgh, 1727).&lt;ref&gt;R. Saville, ''Bank of Scotland: a History, 1695–1995'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press 1996), {{ISBN|0-7486-0757-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Glasgow would soon follow with branches of its own (notably, the first was to be Dunlop, Houston &amp; Co. in 1749, known as "the Ship Bank" for the image of a ship printed on all their bills)&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meighan, ''Glasgow: A History'' (Amberley Publishing, 2013), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; and Scotland had a flourishing financial system by the end of the century. There were over 400 branches, amounting to one office per 7,000 people, double the level in England. The banks were more lightly regulated than those in England. Historians often emphasise that the flexibility and dynamism of the Scottish banking system contributed significantly to the rapid development of the economy in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Daunton, ''Progress and Poverty: An Economic and Social History of Britain 1700–1850'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995), {{ISBN|0-19-822281-5}}, p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Cowen and R. Kroszner, "Scottish Banking before 1845: A Model for Laissez-Faire?", ''Journal of Money, Credit and Banking'', vol. 21 (2), (May, 1989), pp. 221–31, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1992370 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt; As a joint-stock company the British Linen Company had the right to raise funds through the issue of promissory notes or bonds. With its bonds functioning as bank notes, the company gradually moved into the business of lending and discounting to other linen manufacturers, and in the early 1770s banking became its main activity.&lt;ref name="A. Malcolm, 1950"&gt;C. A. Malcolm, ''The History of the British Linen Bank'' (Edinburgh: T. &amp; A. Constable, 1950), {{ISBN|1446526283}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transport===
The extensive Scottish coastline meant that few parts of the country that were not within easy reach of sea transportation, particularly the central belt that would be the heartland of industrial development. Before the eighteenth century most roads were relatively poor dirt tracks. In the late eighteenth century there were improvements carried out by [[turnpike trusts]] and the creation of a series of [[Old military roads of Scotland|military roads]].&lt;ref name="Finley2001pp198-9"/&gt; Canal building also developed, with four major lowland canals: the [[Forth and Clyde Canal|Forth and Clyde]], [[Union Canal (Scotland)|Union]], [[Monkland Canal|Monkland]] and [[Crinan Canal|Crinan]] and further north the [[Glasgow, Paisley and Johnstone Canal|Paisley]], [[Caledonian Canal|Caledonian]] and [[Aberdeenshire Canal|Inverurie]] canals, carrying thousands of passengers and tons of goods by the early nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Durie, "Movement, transport and tourism" in T. Griffiths and G. Morton, eds, ''A History of Everyday Life in Scotland, 1800 to 1900'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2010), {{ISBN|0748621709}}, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exports===

With tariffs with England abolished, the potential for trade for Scottish merchants was considerable, especially with [[Colonial America]]. However, the economic benefits of union were very slow to appear, primarily because Scotland was too poor to exploit the opportunities of the greatly expanded free market. Scotland in 1750 was still a poor rural, agricultural society with a population of 1.3 million.&lt;ref name="H. Hamilton, 1963"&gt;H. Hamilton, ''An Economic History of Scotland in the Eighteenth Century'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1963).&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Scotland's economy had been ravaged by the [[Darien scheme]]: according to some estimates, half of all the circulating wealth in Scotland went into the scheme. Glasgow merchants had been particularly enthusiastic, and consequently had no ships of their own for twenty years following the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Massie, ''Glasgow: Portraits of a City'' (Barrie &amp; Jenkins, 1989), p. 21-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Some progress was visible, such as the sales of linen and cattle to England, the cash flows from military service, and the tobacco trade that was dominated by Glasgow after 1740. The clippers belonging to the Glasgow [[Tobacco Lords]] were the fastest ships on the route to Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lester, "The Tobacco Lords: A study of the Tobacco Merchants of Glasgow and their Activities", ''Virginia Historical Society'' Vol. 84, No. 1 (1976), [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/4248011?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103494003161 in JSTOR], p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; The trade had started as smuggling during the 1600s, but with the [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]], it became legal and trade picked up.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meighan, ''Glasgow: A History'' (Amberley Publishing, 2013), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Merchants who profited from the American trade began investing in leather, textiles, iron, coal, sugar, rope, sailcloth, glassworks, breweries, and soapworks, setting the foundations for the city's emergence as a leading industrial centre after 1815.&lt;ref&gt;T. M. Devine, "The Colonial Trades and Industrial Investment in Scotland, c. 1700–1815," ''Economic History Review,'' Feb 1976, vol. 29 (1), pp. 1–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The tobacco trade collapsed during the American Revolution (1776–83), when its sources were cut off by the British blockade of American ports. However, trade with the West Indies began to make up for the loss of the tobacco business,&lt;ref&gt;R. H. Campbell, "The Anglo-Scottish Union of 1707. II: The Economic Consequences," ''Economic History Review,'' April 1964 vol. 16, pp. 468–477 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2592849 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the extensive growth of the cotton industry, the British demand for sugar and the demand in the West Indies for herring and linen goods. During 1750–1815, 78 Glasgow merchants not only specialised in the importation of sugar, cotton, and rum from the West Indies, but diversified their interests by purchasing West Indian plantations, Scottish estates, or cotton mills. They were not to be self-perpetuating due to the hazards of the trade, the incident of bankruptcy, and the changing complexity of Glasgow's economy.&lt;ref&gt;T. M. Devine, "An Eighteenth-Century Business Élite: Glasgow-West India Merchants, c 1750–1815," ''Scottish Historical Review,'' April 1978, vol. 57 (1), pp. 40–67.&lt;/ref&gt; Other burghs also benefited. Greenock enlarged its port in 1710 and sent its first ship to the Americas in 1719, but was soon playing a major part in importing sugar and rum.&lt;ref name=Mackie1991p296&gt;J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, ''A History of Scotland'' (London: Penguin, 1991), {{ISBN|0140136495}}, p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linen===
[[File:NewlanarkNL06.jpg|thumb|left|[[New Lanark]], cotton mills and housing on the River Clyde, founded in 1786]]
Linen manufacture was Scotland's premier industry in the eighteenth century and formed the basis for the later cotton, jute,&lt;ref&gt;L. Miskell and C. A. Whatley, "'Juteopolis' in the Making: Linen and the Industrial Transformation of Dundee, c. 1820–1850," ''[[Textile History]],'' Autumn 1999, vol. 30 (2), pp. 176–98.&lt;/ref&gt; and woollen industries.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Durie, "The Markets for Scottish Linen, 1730–1775", ''Scottish Historical Review'' vol. 52, no. 153, Part 1 (April, 1973), pp. 30–49 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25528985 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish industrial policy was made by the [[Board of Trustees for Fisheries and Manufactures in Scotland]], which sought to build an economy complementary, not competitive, with England. Since England had woolens, this meant linen.&lt;ref name=Durie1993/&gt; The Scottish members of parliament managed to see off an attempt to impose an export duty on linen and from 1727 it received subsidies of £2,750 a year for six years, resulting in a considerable expansion of the trade. Paisley adopted Dutch methods and became a major centre of production. Glasgow manufactured for the export trade, which doubled between 1725 and 1738.&lt;ref name=Mackie1991p292&gt;J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, ''A History of Scotland'' (London: Penguin, 1991), {{ISBN|0140136495}}, pp. 292–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Encouraged and subsidised by the Board of Trustees, so that they could compete with German products, merchant entrepreneurs became dominant in all stages of linen manufacturing and built up the market share of Scottish linens, especially in the American colonial market.&lt;ref name=Durie1993&gt;Alastair Durie, "Imitation in Scottish Eighteenth-Century Textiles: The Drive to Establish the Manufacture of Osnaburg Linen," ''Journal of Design History,'' 1993, vol. 6 (2), pp. 71–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The British Linen Company, established in 1746, was the largest firm in the Scottish linen industry in the eighteenth century, exporting linen to England and America.&lt;ref name="A. Malcolm, 1950"/&gt; In 1728, 2.2 million yards of linen cloth had been produced and by 1730 it had already supplanted woollen cloth as the major manufacturing industry. By 1750 it reached 7.6 million and it peaked at 12.1 million yards in 1775. However, there were sharp slumps, particularly in the periods  1734–43 and 1763–72. It was a mainly rural industry, with most of the manufacture carried out in homes, rather than factories. It employed perhaps 100,000 people, four out of five of which were women who spun the flax, while men operated the looms.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p381"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0-7126-9893-0}}, p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government promoted the use of linen from the late 17th century: a 1686 Act of Parliament stated that all Scots were to be buried in Scottish-made linen winding sheets, using Scottish flax. In 1748, an embargo on the import or use of French [[cambric]] provided a further boost to the linen industry.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meighan, ''Glasgow: A History'' (Amberley Publishing, 20013), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1770, [[Glasgow]] was the largest linen manufacturer in Britain, and in 1787, [[Calton, Glasgow]] was the site of Scotland's first industrial dispute when 7,000 weavers went on strike in protest against a 25% cut in their wages. The [[39th Foot]] were sent in, and three people were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meighan, ''Glasgow: A History'' (Amberley Publishing, 20013), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheer linen, which had then come into vogue, was almost unobtainable in Scotland in the 1780s. In a bid to stay competitive, Glasgow manufacturers turned to fine cotton muslin, at which they succeeded so well that it became cheaper than imported Indian muslins.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Swain, ''Scottish Embroidery: Medieval to Modern'' (BT Batsford, 1986), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; With the popularity of Indian muslins, from the 1760s onwards, had come a fashion for [[tambour lace]], or [[sewed muslin]], which briefly became a flourishing business in Ayrshire, thanks to the enterprising spirit of [[Mrs Jamieson]].

==Nineteenth century==

The economy, long based on agriculture,&lt;ref name="H. Hamilton, 1963"/&gt; began to industrialize after 1790. At first the leading industry, based in the west, was the production of cotton. After the cutting off of supplies of raw cotton from 1861 as a result of the [[American Civil War]] the country diversified into engineering, shipbuilding, and locomotive construction, with steel replacing iron after 1870.&lt;ref&gt;O.

===Cotton===
From about 1790 textiles became the most important industry in the west of Scotland, especially the spinning and weaving of cotton. The first cotton spinning mill was opened at [[Penicuik]] in 1778. By 1787 Scotland had 19 mills, 95 by 1795 and there were 192 by 1839. The rise of cotton was the result of a sudden fall in the price of the raw materials, mostly imported from the US, and the availability of a pool of cheap labour caused by population rise and migration. In 1775 137,000&amp;nbsp;lb of raw cotton were being imported into the Clyde and by 1812 it had increased eightfold to over 11 million lb. The capital invested in the industry increased sevenfold between 1790 and 1840.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p383"/&gt; By 1800, cotton was the main industry in the Glasgow area: [[New Lanark]] mills were at the time the largest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meighan, ''Glasgow: A History'' (Amberley Publishing, 20013), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Early production was aided by the new technology of the [[spinning mule]], [[water frame]] and water power.&lt;ref name="Finley2001pp198-9"/&gt; Steam powered machines were introduced into the industry from 1782.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p383"/&gt; However, only about a third of workers were employed in factories and it continued to rely heavily on the [[hand loom]] weaver, working in his own home. In 1790 there were about 10,000 weavers involved in cotton manufacture and by 1800 it was 50,000.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p384"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0-7126-9893-0}}, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt; The cotton industry flourished until in 1861 the American Civil War cut off the supplies of raw cotton.&lt;ref&gt;W. O. Henderson, ''The Lancashire Cotton Famine 1861–65'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1934), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; The industry never recovered, but by that time Scotland had developed heavy industries based on its coal and iron resources.&lt;ref name="A. Whatley, 1997 p. 51"&gt;C. A. Whatley, ''The Industrial Revolution in Scotland'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), {{ISBN|0-521-57643-1}}, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coal===
[[File:Francis Colliery Headgear - geograph.org.uk - 305376.jpg|thumb|left|The headgear at Francis Colliery, Fife]]
Coal mining became a major industry, and continued to grow into the twentieth century, producing the fuel to smelt iron, heat homes and factories and drive steam engines locomotives and steamships. Coal mining expanded rapidly in the eighteenth century, reaching 700,000 tons a year by 1750. Most coal was in five fields across the [[Central Belt]]. The first [[Newcomen Steam Engine]] was introduced into a Scottish colliery in 1719, but water remained the most important source of power for most of the century. With increased demand for household fuel from a growing urban population and the emerging demands of heavy industry, production grew from an estimated 1 million tons a year in 1775, to 3 million by 1830.&lt;ref name="Whyte2001pp211-12"/&gt; Production almost doubled by the 1840s and peaked in 1914 at about 42 million tons a year.&lt;ref name="Whatley2001pp208-9"&gt;C. A. Whatley, "Economy: primary sector: 3 mining and quarrying", in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-211696-7}}, pp. 208–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially increased production was made possible by the introduction of cheap labour, provided from the 1830s by large numbers of Irish immigrants.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p408"/&gt; There were then changes in mining practices, which included the introduction of [[blasting powder]] in the 1850s and the use of mechanised methods of transferring the coal to the surface,&lt;ref&gt;W.

===Iron and steel===
[[File:Monkland Rlies 1848.gif|thumb|right|Map of the Monkland Railways and surrounding lines in 1848]]
The invention of [[James Beaumont Neilson]]'s [[hot blast]] process for smelting iron in 1828 revolutionised the Scottish iron industry, allowing abundant native blackstone iron ore to be smelted with ordinary coal.&lt;ref name="Finley2001pp198-9"/&gt; In 1830 Scotland had 27 iron furnaces and by 1840 it was 70, 143 in 1850 and it peaked at 171 in 1860.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p407"/&gt; Output was over 2,500,000 tons of iron ore in 1857, 6.5 per cent of UK output. Output of [[pig iron]] rose from 797,000 tons in 1854 to peak at 1,206,00 in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;O. Checkland and S. Checkland, ''Industry and Ethos: Scotland 1832–1914'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd ed., 1989), {{ISBN|0748601023}}, pp. 24–5.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Scotland became a centre for engineering, shipbuilding and the production of locomotives.&lt;ref name="A. Whatley, 1997 p. 51"/&gt; In the 1871 census, the workforce in heavy industry overtook textiles in the Strathclyde region and in 1891 it became the majority employer in the country. Toward the end of the nineteenth century, steel production largely replaced iron production.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p407"&gt;M.

===Railways===
Britain was the world leader in the construction of railways, and their use to expand trade and coal supplies. The first successful locomotive-powered line in Scotland, between [[Monklands (district)|Monkland]] and [[Kirkintilloch]], opened in 1826. By the late 1830s there was a network of railways that included lines between Dundee and Arbroath, and connecting Glasgow, Paisley and Ayr. The line between Glasgow and Edinburgh, largely designed for passenger transport, opened in 1842 and proved highly successful. By the mid-1840s the mania for railways had begun.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p410"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0-7126-9893-0}}, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt; A good passenger service established by the late 1840s, and a network of freight lines reduced the cost of shipping coal, making products manufactured in Scotland competitive throughout Britain.&lt;ref name=ChecklandandCheckland1989pp17-52/&gt; The [[North British Railway]] was formed in 1844 to link Edinburgh and eastern Scotland with Newcastle and the next year the [[Caledonian Railway]] began connecting Glasgow and the west to Carlisle. The creation of a dense network in the Lowlands with connections to England would take until the 1870s to complete.&lt;ref name=ChecklandandCheckland1989pp26-7/&gt;

A series of amalgamations meant that five main companies operated 98 per cent of the system by the 1860s. The capital invested in Scottish railways was £26.6 million in 1859 and by 1900 it had reached £166.1 million. The floatation of railway companies was a major factor in the formation of the Scottish stock exchanges and the rise of share holding in Scotland and after the early stages drew in large amounts of English investment.&lt;ref name=ChecklandandCheckland1989pp26-7&gt;O.

===Shipbuilding===
[[File:Govan cranes.JPG|thumb|left|Surviving cranes at the former [[Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company|Fairfield]] shipyard in [[Govan]]]]
Shipbuilding on [[Clydeside]] (the river Clyde through Glasgow and other points) began when the first small yards were opened in 1712 at the [[Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company|Scott family's]] shipyard at Greenock.&lt;ref&gt;J. Shields, ''Clyde Built: a History of Ship-Building on the River Clyde'' (Glasgow: William MacLellan, 1949).&lt;/ref&gt; Major firms included [[William Denny and Brothers|Denny]] of Dumbarton, [[Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company]] of Greenock, [[Lithgows]] of Port Glasgow, Simon and [[Lobnitz]] of Renfrew, [[Alexander Stephen and Sons]] of Linthouse, [[Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company|Fairfield]] of Govan, [[A. &amp; J. Inglis|Inglis]] of Pointhouse, [[Barclay Curle]] of Whiteinch, [[Charles Connell and Company|Connell]] and [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow]] of Scotstoun. Equally important were the engineering firms that supplied the machinery to drive these vessels, the boilers and pumps and steering gear – Rankin &amp; Blackmore, Hastie's and Kincaid's of Greenock, Rowan's of Finnieston, [[Weir Group|Weir's]] of Cathcart, Howden's of Tradeston and [[Doosan Babcock|Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] of Renfrew.&lt;ref&gt;R. Johnston, ''Clydeside Capital, 1870–1920: a Social History of Employers'' (Tuckwell Press, 2000), {{ISBN|1862321027}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest customer was Sir William Mackinnon, who ran five shipping companies in the nineteenth century from his base in Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;J. Forbes Munro, ''Maritime Enterprise and Empire: Sir William Mackinnon and His Business Network, 1823–1893'' (Boydell Press, 2003), {{ISBN|0851159354}}, p. 494.&lt;/ref&gt; The Vulcan works, owned by [[Robert Napier and Sons]] were the first to start the production of large passenger iron ships in the 1840s.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p409"/&gt;

In 1835 the Clyde produced only 5 per cent of the ship tonnage built in Britain. The transition from wooden to iron ships was an uneven one, with wooden ships still cheaper to build until around 1850 and the material continued to be used until the 1860s in ships with composite hulls, like the clipper the ''[[Cutty Sark]]'', which was launched from Dumbarton in 1869. Cost also delayed the transition from iron to steel shipbuilding and as late as 1879 only 18,000&amp;nbsp;tons of steel-built shipping was launched on the Clyde, 10 per cent of all tonnage. A similar process occurred in means of propulsion with shifts from sail to steam and back again between the 1840s and the introduction of the more efficient [[steam turbine]] engine that became dominant in the mid-1880s. Tonnage increased by more than a factor of six between 1880 and 1914.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p409"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0-7126-9893-0}}, p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt; Production peaked during the First World War and the term "Clyde-built" became synonymous with industrial quality.&lt;ref name="Finley2001pp199-200"&gt;R.

===Engineering architecture===
{{Main|Architecture of Scotland in the Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:Forth bridge histo 2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Forth Bridge]] on completion in 1890]]
The nineteenth century saw some major engineering projects including [[Thomas Telford]]'s (1757–1834) stone [[Dean Bridge]] (1829–31) and iron [[Craigellachie Bridge]] (1812–14).&lt;ref&gt;C. Harvie, ''Scotland: A Short History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), {{ISBN|0-19-210054-8}}, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1850s the possibilities of new [[wrought iron|wrought-]] and [[cast-iron]] construction were explored in the building of commercial warehouses in Glasgow. This adopted a round-arched [[Venetian Gothic architecture|Venetian]] style first used by Alexander Kirkland (1824–92) at the heavily ornamented 37–51 Miller Street (1854) and translated into iron in John Baird I's Gardner's Warehouse (1855–56), with an exposed iron frame and almost uninterrupted glazing. Most industrial buildings avoided this cast-iron aesthetic, like William Spence's (1806?–83) [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]] Engine Works built in 1856–58, using massive rubble blocks.&lt;ref name=GlendinningMacInnes&amp;MacKechniep254&gt;M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, ''A History of Scottish Architecture: from the Renaissance to the Present Day'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2002), {{ISBN|978-0-7486-0849-2}}, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important engineering project was the [[Forth Bridge]], a [[cantilever bridge|cantilever]] railway bridge over the [[Firth of Forth]] in the east of [[Scotland]], 14&amp;nbsp;kilometres (9&amp;nbsp;mi) west of central [[Edinburgh]]. Construction of a [[suspension bridge]] designed by [[Thomas Bouch]] (1822–80), was stopped after the collapse of another of his works, the [[Tay Rail Bridge|Tay Bridge]] in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;I. B.

Baxter, ''John Fowler, Benjamin Baker, Forth Bridge'' (Axel Menges, 2nd edn., 1997), {{ISBN|3-930698-18-8}}, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The project was taken over by [[John Fowler (engineer)|John Fowler]] (1817–98) and [[Benjamin Baker (engineer)|Benjamin Baker]] (1840–1907), who designed a structure that was built by Glasgow-based company [[Sir William Arrol &amp; Co.]] from 1883. It was opened on 4 March 1890, and spans a total length of {{convert|2528.7|m}}. It was the first major structure in Britain to be constructed of steel;&lt;ref name="Blanctal"&gt;A. Blanc, M.

==Impact==

===Population and urbanisation===
{{Main|Demographic history of Scotland}}
[[File:Glasgow map 1878.jpg|thumb|left|A map of Glasgow, the "second city of the Empire", in 1878]]
The census conducted by the Reverend [[Alexander Webster]] in 1755 showed the inhabitants of Scotland as 1,265,380 persons.&lt;ref&gt;K. J. Cullen, ''Famine in Scotland: The "Ill Years" of the 1690s'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2010), {{ISBN|0-7486-3887-3}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;123–4.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the first [[Census in the United Kingdom|decadal census]] in 1801, the population was 1,608,420. It grew steadily in the nineteenth century, to 2,889,000 in 1851 and 4,472,000 in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;A. K. Cairncross, ''The Scottish Economy: A Statistical Account of Scottish Life by Members of the Staff of Glasgow University'' (Glasgow: Glasgow University Press, 1953), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

While population fell in some rural areas as a result of the agricultural revolution, it rose rapidly in the towns. Aberdeen, Dundee and Glasgow all grew by a third or more between 1755 and 1775 and the textile town of Paisley more than doubled its population.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p383"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0712698930}}, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland was already one of the most urbanised societies in Europe by 1800.&lt;ref&gt;W. Ferguson, ''The Identity of the Scottish Nation: An Historic Quest'' (1998) [https://www.questia.com/read/54868029 online edition].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1800, 17 per cent of people in Scotland lived in towns of more than 10,000 inhabitants. By 1850 it was 32 per cent and by 1900 it was 50 per cent. By 1900 one in three of the entire population were in the four cities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992pp411-2"/&gt;

Glasgow emerged as the largest city. Its population in 1780 was 43,000, reaching 147,000 by 1820; by 1901 it had grown to 762,000. This was due to a high birth rate and immigration from the countryside and particularly from Ireland; but from the 1870s there was a fall in the birth rate and lower rates of migration and much of the growth was due to longer life expectancy.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992pp411-2"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0712698930}}, pp. 411–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Glasgow was now one of the largest cities in the world, and it became known as "the Second City of the Empire" after London.&lt;ref&gt;J. F. MacKenzie, "The second city of the Empire: Glasgow – imperial municipality", in F. Driver and D. Gilbert, eds, ''Imperial Cities: Landscape, Display and Identity'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2003), {{ISBN|0-7190-6497-X}}, pp. 215–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gravestone of William Beattie and family.JPG|thumb|right|Evidence of high infant mortality on an Edinburgh gravestone]]
[[History of Dundee|Dundee]] upgraded its harbour and established itself as an industrial and trading centre. Dundee's industrial heritage was based on "the three Js": jute, jam and journalism. East-central Scotland became too heavily dependent on linens, hemp, and jute. Despite the cyclical nature of the trade which periodically ruined weaker companies, profits held up well in the nineteenth century. Typical firms were family affairs, even after the introduction of limited liability in the 1890s. The profits helped make the city an important source of overseas investment, especially in North America. However, the profits were seldom invested locally, apart from the linen trade. The reasons were that low wages limited local consumption, and because there were no important natural resources; thus the Dundee region offered little opportunity for profitable industrial diversification.&lt;ref&gt;B. Lenman and Kathleen Donaldson, "Partners' Incomes, Investment and Diversification in the Scottish Linen Area 1850–1921", ''Business History'', Jan 1971, vol. 13(1), pp. 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The industrial developments, while they brought work and wealth, were so rapid that housing, town-planning, and provision for public health did not keep pace with them, and for a time living conditions in some of the towns and cities were notoriously bad, with overcrowding, high infant mortality, and growing rates of tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;C. H. Lee, ''Scotland and the United Kingdom: the Economy and the Union in the Twentieth Century'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1995), {{ISBN|0-7190-4101-5}}, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Mortality rates were high compared with England and other European nations. Evidence suggests a national death rate of 30 per 1,000 in 1755, 24 in the 1790s and 22 in the early 1860s. Mortality tended to be much higher in urban than rural settlements. The first time these were measured, 1861–82, in the four major cities these were 28.1 per 1,000 and 17.9 in rural areas. Mortality probably peaked in Glasgow in the 1840s, when large inflows of population from the Highlands and Ireland combined population outgrowing sanitary provision and combining with outbreaks of epidemic disease. National rates began to fall in the 1870s, particularly in the cities, as environmental conditions improved.&lt;ref&gt;M. Anderson, "Population patterns: 2 since 1770, in M. Lynch, ed., ''Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0-19-969305-6}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;489–91.&lt;/ref&gt; The companies attracted rural workers, as well as immigrants from Catholic Ireland, by inexpensive company housing that was a dramatic move upward from the inner-city slums. This paternalistic policy led many owners to support government sponsored housing programs as well as self-help projects among the respectable working class.&lt;ref&gt;J. Melling, "Employers, industrial housing and the evolution of company welfare policies in Britain's heavy industry: west Scotland, 1870–1920", ''International Review of Social History'', Dec 1981, vol. 26 (3), pp. 255–301.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Class identity===
[[File:Carron Company trademark.jpg|thumb|left|The Carron Company trademark on the Carron Works, the objective of the 1820 [[Radical War]]]]
One of the consequences of industrialisation and urbanisation was the development of a distinct skilled [[working class]]. W. H. Fraser argues that the emergence of a class identity can be located to the period before the 1820s, when cotton workers in particular were involved in a series of political protests and events. This led to the [[Radical War]] of 1820, in which a declaration of a provisional government by three weavers coincided with a strike by Glasgow cotton workers. The climax of the five-day war was a march from [[Glasgow Green]] to [[Falkirk]] to take control of the [[Carron Company|Carron Iron Works]]. It ended in a cavalry charge by government forces at [[Bonnymuir]]. The result was a discouragement of direct political action by workers, although attempts at political reform continued in movements like [[Chartism]] and the [[Eight-hour day|short hours]] movement in the 1830s.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992pp390-1"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0-7126-9893-0}}, pp. 390–1.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1830s the political influence of the working classes was expanded through the widening of the franchise, industrial action and the growth and organisation of trade unionism. There were less than 5,000 eligible voters in Scotland before the [[Reform Act 1832|1832 Reform Act]] saw the enlargement of the franchise to include middle class men of business. The [[Representation of the People (Scotland) Act 1868|1868 Act]] brought in skilled artisans and that of [[Representation of the People Act 1884|1884]] admitted many farm workers, crofters, miners and unskilled men. These changes were supported by trade unions,&lt;ref&gt;O. Checkland and S. Checkland, ''Industry and Ethos: Scotland 1832–1914'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd ed., 1989), {{ISBN|0748601023}}, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; which developed from the mid-century. Concerted industrial action was undertaken by spinners in the cotton industry in 1836-7 after a collapse of foreign markets led to wage cuts, but was ultimately defeated by the factory owners. The most sustained industrial action was in the mining industry, where the owners controlled employment as well as housing and retail trade through the [[truck system]]. In 1887 colliers in the west of Scotland won a major victory over both wages and rents.&lt;ref&gt;O. Checkland and S. Checkland, ''Industry and Ethos: Scotland 1832–1914'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd ed., 1989), {{ISBN|0748601023}}, pp. 86–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish trade unionism in the nineteenth century differed from that in the rest of Britain in that unions were often small and highly localised and lacked higher industrial and national organisation.&lt;ref&gt;W. Kenefick, ''Red Scotland!: The Rise and Fall of the Radical Left, c. 1872–1932'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), {{ISBN|0748625186}}, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Trade councils were established in Edinburgh in 1853 and in Glasgow in 1858 in an attempt to organise on a regional basis, but were often ineffectual.&lt;ref&gt;O. Checkland and S. Checkland, ''Industry and Ethos: Scotland 1832–1914'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd ed., 1989), {{ISBN|0748601023}}, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[new unionism]] of the last two decades of the century saw the dockers and railwaymen organise a network of regional and national support, but this began to wain towards the end of the century and the situation of union parochialism would remain the dominant mode until union amalgamations got under way after 1914.&lt;ref&gt;W. Kenefick, ''Red Scotland!: The Rise and Fall of the Radical Left, c. 1872–1932'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), {{ISBN|0748625186}}, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women===
[[File:Powerloom weaving in 1835.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration of power loom weaving in 1835, showing an idealised view of women working in a clean and spacious environment]]
The industrialisation of Scotland had a major impact of the roles of women. Women and girls formed a much higher proportion of the workforce than elsewhere in Britain and were the majority of workers in some industries. The expansion of flax spinning and the rise of linen industry in the eighteenth century was almost totally dependent on female labour and the situation was similar in the [[sewed muslin]] industry in the West of Scotland towards the end of the century. When flax spinning became mechanised the proportion of men to women was 100:280, the highest proportion of women in the United Kingdom. In Dundee in the 1840s, while male employment increased by a factor of 1.6, female employment went up by 2.5, making it the only large town in Scotland with the majority of its female population in paid employment. In cotton in the nineteenth century women and girls accounted for 61 per cent of the workforce in Scottish mills, compared with 50 per cent in Lancashire. Although most women were employed in the textile industries, they were also a significant proportion of the workforce in other areas, making up 12 per cent of underground workers in mining, compared with 4 per cent in Britain overall.&lt;ref name=Whatley1997pp74-5&gt;C. A. Whatley, ''The Industrial Revolution in Scotland'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), {{ISBN|0521576431}}, pp. 74–5.&lt;/ref&gt;  The expanded opportunities for women, and the extra income they and children brought into the household, probably did the most to help increase living standards for working-class families.&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Whatley, ''The Industrial Revolution in Scotland'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), {{ISBN|0521576431}}, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of women in workforce peaked in the 1830s. As heavy industry began to dominate there were less opportunities for women.&lt;ref name=Whatley1997pp74-5/&gt; From the mid-nineteenth century there were a series of laws that limited female roles in industry, beginning with the Mines Regulation Act of 1842, which prevented them from working underground. This put 2,500 women out of work in the east of Scotland, causing real hardship as their contribution to the family economy was vital. This was followed by a series of factory acts that placed restrictions on the employment of women. Many of these acts were brought in because of pressure from trade unions who were attempting to secure a living wage for their male members. Women had relatively little involvement in official trade unions for much of the period of industrialisation. However, they were frequently involved in unofficial disputes, the first being recorded in 1768 and of which there are known to have been 300 strikes that involved women between 1850 and 1914. Towards the end of the century there were increasing attempts to unionise women. The Scottish Women's Trade Council (SWTC) was formed in 1887. From this emerged the [[Women's Protective and Provident League]] (WPPL) and the Glasgow Council for Women's Trades (GCWT). In 1893, the National Federal Council of Scotland for Women's Trades (NFCSWT) was established and the Scottish Council for Women's Trades (SCWT) in 1900. By 1895 the NFCSWT alone had an affiliated membership of 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Brown, "Women: 1770s onwards", in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007), {{ISBN|0199234825}}, pp. 647–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Migration===
[[File:Scottish poster advertising emigration to New Zealand.jpg|thumb|upright|left|"First Scottish Colony for New Zealand" – 1839 poster advertising emigration from Scotland to New Zealand]]
The growth of industry resulted in the arrival of large numbers of workers from Ireland who moved into the factories and mines in the 1830s and 1840s.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p395"/&gt; Many were seasonal workers employed as [[navvies]] on the construction of docks, canals and then railways.&lt;ref name=McCarrery2001pp331-3/&gt; An estimated 60–70 per cent of colliers in Lanarkshire were Irish by the 1840s.

[[Image:Safety Layer Protection.png|thumb|300px|Safety Layer Protection.]]

An '''industrial safety system''' is a countermeasure crucial in any [[hazard]]ous [[manufacturing plant|plant]]s such as [[Petroleum industry|oil and gas]] plants and [[nuclear plant]]s. They are used to protect [[human]], [[industrial plant]], and the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] in case of the [[process manufacturing|process]] going  beyond the allowed control margins.

As the name suggests, these systems are not intended for controlling the process itself but rather protection. [[Process control]] is performed by means of [[process control system]]s (PCS) and is [[interlock]]ed by the [[safety]] systems so that immediate actions are taken should the process control systems fail.

Process control and safety systems are usually merged under one system, called ''[[Integrated Control and Safety System]]'' (ICSS).
Industrial safety systems typically use dedicated systems that are [[safety integrity level|SIL 2]] certified at minimum; whereas control systems can start with [[safety integrity level|SIL 1]]. SIL applies to both hardware and software requirements such as cards, processors redundancy and voting functions.

==Types==
There are 2 main types of industrial safety systems in process industry:&lt;ref&gt;Most of this article is summarized from some [[Yemen LNG]] documentation on safety systems, No. YE-001-30-POC-JBS-25300 and YE-001-30-POC-JBS-25200.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Process Safety System or Process Shutdown System, (PSS).
* Safety Shutdown System (SSS): This includes Emergency Shutdown-(ESD) and Emergency Depressurization-(EDP) Systems.
A third system also exists which acts as a barrier and contains the spray out of hot oil &amp; gases from flanges, valves &amp; pipe joints. These systems are popularly known as safety spray shields and flange guards.The use of spray guards is mandated by OSHA.

== ESD ==
These systems may also be redefined in terms of ESD/EDP levels as:
* ESD level 1: In charge of general plant area shutdown, can activate ESD level 2 if necessary. This level can only be activated from main [[control room]] in the process industrial plants.
* ESD level 2: This level shuts down and isolates individual ESD zones and activates if necessary EDP.
* ESD level 3: provides "liquid inventory containment".

===SSS===
The safety shutdown system (SSS) shall shut down the facilities to a safe state in case of an emergency situation, thus protecting personnel, the environment and the asset. The safety shutdown system shall manage all inputs and outputs relative to emergency shutdown (ESD) functions (environment and personnel protection). This system might also be fed by signals from the main fire and gas system.

===FGS===
The main objectives of the fire and gas system are to protect personnel, environment, and plant (including equipment and structures).
The FGS shall achieve these objectives by:
* Detecting at an early stage, the presence of flammable gas,
* Detecting at an early stage, the liquid spill (LPG and LNG),
* Detecting incipient fire and the presence of fire,
* Providing automatic and/or facilities for manual activation of the [[fire protection]] system as required,
* Initiating environmental changes to keep liquids below their [[flash point]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.falckproductions.com/resources/fire-safety-and-firewatch/flashpoints-industrial-workplaces/|title=Flash Points and Industrial Fire Safety Videos|publisher=Falck Productions|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Initiating signals, both audible and visible as required, to warn of the detected hazards,
* Initiating automatic shutdown of equipment and ventilation if 2 out of 2 or 2 out of 3 detectors are triggered,
* Initiating the exhausting system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;amp;p_id=10631|title=Ventilation. - 1926.57|publisher=U.S. DOL, OSHA|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== EDP ==
Due to closing ESD valves in a process, there may be some trapped [[flammable]] [[fluid]]s, and these must be released in order to avoid any undesired consequences (such as [[pressure]] increase in vessels and [[piping]]). For this, emergency depressurization (EDP) systems are used in conjunction with the ESD systems to release (to a safe location and in a safe manner) such trapped fluids.

== Pressure safety valves ==
[[Pressure safety valve]]s or PSVs are  usually used as a final safety solution when all previous systems fail to prevent any further pressure accumulation and protect vessels from rupture due to [[overpressure]] by their designed  action.

'''The Institution of Environmental Sciences''' (IES) is a UK professional body leading debate, dissemination and promotion of environmental science and sustainability. The IES has ties with [[higher education]] and promotes and supports environmental sciences and [[sustainable development]] in universities and colleges nationally and internationally.

The IES is a charitable organisation, which raising public awareness of [[environmental science]] by supporting professional scientists and academics working in the area.

IES is a constituent body of both the [[Society for the Environment]] (SocEnv), and the [[Science Council]] which enables IES members to progress  to [[Chartered Environmentalist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socenv.org.uk/members/list-of-member-bodies/|title=Licensed Partners|work=socenv.org.uk|accessdate=2 Jan 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820024214/http://www.socenv.org.uk/members/list-of-member-bodies/|archivedate=2007-08-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chartered Scientist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencecouncil.org/about-us/our-members-and-licensed-bodies/|title=Licensed Partners|work=sciencecouncil.org/|accessdate=2 Jan 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; status

==History==
The Institution of Environmental Sciences was founded as a result of an initiative by Dr John Rose during a series of meetings held during 1971-1972 at the Royal Society in London and chaired by Lord Burntwood.

==Affiliations==
The IES is a member of the [[Society for the Environment]], the [http://www.sciencecouncil.org Science Council] and the [http://www.efaep.org European Network of Environmental Professionals].

The IES provides administration for two sister organisations. The [http://www.ches.org.uk/ Committee of Heads of Environmental Science] who accredit programmes of study in universities and to support and promote the discipline in higher education and the [[Institute of Air Quality Management]].

==Publications==
The IES produces four editions of its journal '''environmental SCIENTIST''' each year. Articles are written by experts and professionals working in the environmental field. Each issue examines a topic of importance to environmental science; an expert in the area acts as guest editor, introducing the articles and providing an overview of the subject at hand.  Previous editions of the journal can be viewed on the [http://www.the-ies.org/environmental_scientist IES website].

The IES produces reports that are available to download from [http://www.the-ies.org/reports the website].

In addition to the journal and reports, the IES produces a monthly newsletter, '''ES News''', focusing on a lighter dissemination of expert knowledge and the sharing of institution news.

== Background ==
The construction industry has suffered from a productivity decline since the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Why Construction Industry Productivity is Declining | work=Steven G. Allen, [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] no. 1555, Feb., 1985 | url=http://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/1555.html | accessdate=2008-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2014|title=Construction Productivity in Decline|url=http://www.leanconstruction.org/media/docs/PEJune14_Construction.pdf|journal=PE Magazine|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while all other non-farm industries have seen large boosts in productivity.  The problems in contemporary construction include buildings that are behind schedule and over budget as well as adverse relations among the [[owner]], [[general contractor]], and [[architect]].  Using ideas developed by Toyota in their [[Toyota Production System]] and computer technology advances,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Integrated Project Delivery builds a brave, new BIM world | work=Building Design+Construction, April 1, 2008 | url=http://www.bdcnetwork.com/integrated-project-delivery-builds-brave-new-bim-world | accessdate=2013-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; the integrated project delivery method is designed to solve these key construction problems.  The new focus in IPD is the final value created for the owner, the finished building. Rather than each participant focusing exclusively on their part of construction without considering the implications on the whole process, the IPD method brings all participants together early with collaborative incentives to maximize value for the owner. This collaborative approach allows informed decision making early in the project where the most value can be created.  The close collaboration eliminates a great deal of waste in the design, and allows data sharing directly between the design and construction team eliminating a large barrier to increased productivity in construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Cost Analysis of Inadequate Interoperability in the U.S. Capital Facilities Industry | work=[[U.S. Department of Commerce]] Technology Administration, [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], Aug., 2004 | url=http://www.bfrl.nist.gov/oae/publications/gcrs/04867.pdf | accessdate=2008-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== IPD in practice ==

Integrated project delivery is a delivery system that seeks to align interests, objectives and practices, even in a single business, through a team-based approach. The primary team members include the architect, key technical consultants as well as a general contractor and key subcontractors. The IPD system is a process where all disciplines in a construction project work as one firm, creating faster delivery times, lower costs, no litigation and a more enjoyable process for the entire team – including the owner.

IPD combines ideas from integrated practice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=    * Integrated practice in perspective: A new model for the architectural profession | work=[[Architectural Record]], May, 2007 | url=http://archrecord.construction.com/practice/projDelivery/0705proj-1.asp | accessdate=2008-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[lean construction]] to solve several problems in contemporary construction such as low productivity and waste, time overruns, quality issues, and conflicts during construction among the key stakeholders of owner, architect and contractor.  The growing use of [[building information modeling]] in the construction industry is allowing far greater information collaboration between project participants using IPD and considered an important tool to increasing productivity throughout the construction process.

Unlike the [[design–build]] project delivery method which typically places the contractor in the leading role on a building project, IPD represents a return to the "master builder" concept where the entire building team including the owner, [[architect]], [[general contractor]], [[building engineer]]s, fabricators, and [[subcontractor]]s work collaboratively throughout the [[construction]] process.

Note: Job Order Contracting, JOC is form of integrated project delivery that specifically targets repair, renovation, and minor new construction.  It has proven to be capable of delivering over 90% of projects on-time, on-budget, and to the satisfaction of all participants and stakeholders.  [https://4buildingtogetherdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/2015-joc-report.pdf JOC Research Report.]

Note: A significant criticism of IPD is the absence of any mention or effort to integrate project safety into the method.  Excluding safety will likely lead to poor safety performance on projects using IPD.

== Multi-Party Agreements ==
One common way to further the goals of IPD is through a multi-party agreement among key participants. In a multi-party agreement (MPA), the primary project participants execute a single contract specifying their respective roles, rights, obligations, and liabilities. In effect, the multi-party agreement creates a temporary virtual, and in some instances formal, organization to realize a specific project. Because a single agreement is used, each party understands its role in relationship to the other participants. Compensation structures are often open-book, so each party’s interests and contributions are similarly transparent. Multi-party agreements require trust, as compensation is tied to overall project success and individual success depends on the contributions of all team members. For an MPA to be successful, the participants must be committed to working as a team to achieve team goals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Common forms of multi-party agreements include 
* project alliances, which create a project structure where the owner guaranteed the direct costs of non-owner parties, but payment of profit, overhead and bonus depends on project outcome; 
* a single-purpose entity, which is a temporary, but formal, legal structure created to realize a specific project; 
* and relational contracts, which are similar to Project Alliances in that a virtual organization is created from individual entities, but it differs in its approach to compensation, risk sharing and decision making.

== The role of technology in IPD ==

The adoption of IPD as a standard for collaborative good practice on [[construction]] projects presents its own problems. As most construction projects involve disparate stakeholders, traditional IT solutions are not conducive to collaborative working. Sharing files behind IT [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]], large email attachment sizes and the ability to view all manner of file types without the native software all make IPD difficult. 

The need to overcome collaborative IT challenges has been one of the drivers behind the growth of online [[construction collaboration technology]]. Since 2000, a new generation of technology companies evolved using [[SaaS]] to facilitate IPD in a smooth and efficient manner. 

This [[collaboration software]] streamlines the flow of documentation, communications and workflows ensuring everyone is working from 'one version of the truth'. [[Collaboration software]] allows users from disparate locations to keep all communications, documents &amp; drawings, forms and data, amongst other types of electronic file, in one place. [[Version control]] is assured and users are able to view and mark up files online without the need for native software.  The technology also enables project confidence and mitigates risk thanks to inbuilt audit trails.

In [[mathematics]], a set of natural numbers is called a '''K-trivial set''' if its [[Upper set|initial segments]] viewed as binary strings are easy to describe: the prefix-free [[Kolmogorov complexity]] is as low as possible, close to that of a [[recursive set|computable set]]. Solovay proved in 1975 that a set can be K-trivial without being computable.

The [[Schnorr–Levin theorem]] says that random sets have a  high initial segment complexity. Thus the K-trivials  are far  from random. This is why these sets  are studied in the field of [[Algorithmically random sequence|algorithmic randomness]], which is a subfield of [[Computability theory]]  and related to  [[algorithmic information theory]] in [[computer science]].

At the same time, K-trivial sets are close to computable. For instance,   they are all [[superlow]], i.e. sets whose [[Turing jump]] is computable from the [[Halting problem]], and form a [[Turing ideal]], i.e. class of sets closed under  [[Turing join]] and closed downward under [[Turing reduction]].

== Definition ==

Let K be the prefix-free [[Kolmogorov Complexity]], i.e. given a string x, K(x) outputs the least length of the input string under a [[Chaitin's constant#Background|prefix-free universal machine]].  Such a machine, intuitively, represents a universal programming language with the property that no valid program can be obtained as a proper extension of another valid program. For more background of K, see e.g. [[Chaitin's constant]].

We say a set A of the [[natural numbers]] is K-trivial via a constant  b ∈ ℕ    if

:&lt;math&gt;\forall n K(A\upharpoonright n)\leq K(n)+b &lt;/math&gt;.

A set is K-trivial if it is K-trivial via some constant.&lt;ref&gt;A. Nies (2009). Computability and Randomness, Oxford Science Publications, {{ISBN|978-0199230761}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Downey, Rodney G., Hirschfeldt, Denis R. (2010), "Algorithmic Randomness and Complexity", {{ISBN|978-0-387-68441-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brief history and development ==

In the early days of the development of K-triviality, attention was paid to separation of K-trivial sets and [[Recursive set|computable sets]].

Chaitin  in his 1976 paper &lt;ref&gt;Gregory J. Chaitin (1976),
    "Information-Theoretic Characterizations of Recursive Infinite Strings",
    Theoretical Computer Science
Volume 2, Issue 1, June 1976, Pages 45–48&lt;/ref&gt;   mainly studied sets such that there exists  b ∈ℕ  with

:&lt;math&gt; \forall n C(A\upharpoonright n)\leq C(n)+b&lt;/math&gt;

where  C denotes the plain [[Kolmogorov complexity]]. These sets are   known as C-trivial sets. Chaitin showed they coincide with the computable sets. He also showed that the  K-trivials are computable in the [[halting problem]]. This class of sets is commonly known as &lt;math&gt;\Delta_2^0&lt;/math&gt; sets in [[arithmetical hierarchy]].

[[Robert M. Solovay]] was the first to construct a noncomputable K-trivial set, while construction of a computably enumerable such A was attempted by [[Cristian S. Calude|Calude]], Coles &lt;ref&gt;Cristian Calude, Richard J. Coles, Program-Size Complexity of Initial Segments and Domination Reducibility, (1999), proceeding of: Jewels are Forever, Contributions on Theoretical Computer Science in Honor of Arto Salomaa&lt;/ref&gt; and other unpublished constructions by Kummer of a K-trivial, and Muchnik junior of a low for K set.

=== Developments 1999–2008 ===

In the context of computability theory, a cost function is a computable function

:&lt;math&gt;c: \mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{Q}^{\geq 0}.&lt;/math&gt;

For a computable approximation &lt;math&gt;\langle A_s \rangle&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\Delta_2^0&lt;/math&gt; set ''A'', such a function measures the cost ''c''(''n'',''s'')  of changing the approximation to A(n)  at stage s. The first [[Loss function|cost function]] construction was due to  Kučera and Terwijn.&lt;ref&gt;Antonin Kučera and Sebastiaan A. Terwijn (1999), "Lowness for the Class of Random Sets", The Journal of Symbolic Logic Vol. 64, No. 4 (Dec., 1999), pp. 1396–1402&lt;/ref&gt; They built a [[computably enumerable]] set that is low for Martin-Löf-randomness  but not computable. Their cost function was adaptive, in that the definition of the cost function depends on the computable approximation of the &lt;math&gt;\Delta_2^0&lt;/math&gt; set being built.

A cost function construction of a  K-trivial [[computably enumerable]] noncomputable set first appeared in Downey et al.&lt;ref&gt;Rod G. Downey,
Denis R. Hirschfeldt,
Andr ́e Nies,
Frank Stephan, "Trivial Reals", Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science 66 No. 1 (2002), URL: {{cite web |url=http://www.elsevier.nl/locate/entcs/volume66.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051003194223/http://www.elsevier.nl/locate/entcs/volume66.html |archivedate=2005-10-03 |df= }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

We say a &lt;math&gt;\Delta_2^0&lt;/math&gt; set ''A'' obeys a cost function ''c'' if there exists a computable approximation of A, &lt;math&gt;\langle A_s: s\in \omega\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;S=\Sigma_{x,s} c(x,s)[x&lt;s \wedge \text{x is the least s.t. }A_{s-1}(x)\neq A_s(x)] &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

K-trivial sets are characterized&lt;ref name="AndreNies"&gt;André Nies, (2005), "Lowness properties and randomness", ''Advances in Mathematics'', Volume 197, Issue 1, 20 October 2005, Pages 274–305&lt;/ref&gt; by obedience to  the [[Standard cost function]], defined by

:&lt;math&gt;c_K (x,s)=\Sigma_{x &lt; y\leq s} 2^{-K_s(x)}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;K_s(x)=\min \{|\sigma|: \mathbb{U}_s(\sigma)=x\}&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}_s&lt;/math&gt; is the ''s''-th step in a computable approximation of a fixed universal prefix-free machine &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Sketch of the construction of a non-computable K-trivial set ====

In fact the set can be made [[promptly simple]]. The idea is to meet the prompt simplicity requirements,

:&lt;math&gt;PS_e: |W_e|=\infty\Rightarrow\exists s \exists x [x\in W_{e,s}\backslash W_{e,s-1} \wedge x\in A_s]&lt;/math&gt;

as well as to keep the costs low. We need the cost function to satisfy the '''limit condition'''

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_x \sup_{s&gt;x}c(x,s)=0&lt;/math&gt;

namely the supremum over stages of the cost for x goes to 0 as x increases. For instance, the [[standard cost function]] has this property. The construction essentially waits until the cost is low before putting numbers into &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to meet the promptly simple requirements. We define a computable enumeration &lt;math&gt;\langle A_s: s\in\omega\rangle&lt;/math&gt; such that

&lt;math&gt;A_0=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;. At stage ''s''&gt;&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp;, for each ''e''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''s'', if &lt;math&gt;PS_e&lt;/math&gt; has not been met yet and there exists ''x''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2''e'' such that &lt;math&gt;x\in W_{e,s}\backslash W_{e,s-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c(x,s)\leq 2^{-e}&lt;/math&gt;, then we put ''x'' into &lt;math&gt;A_s&lt;/math&gt; and declare that &lt;math&gt;PS_e&lt;/math&gt; is met. End of construction.

To verify that the construction works, note first that ''A'' obeys the cost function since at most one number enters ''A'' for the sake of each requirement. The sum ''S'' is therefore at most

:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma_e 2^{-e} &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

Secondly, each requirement is met: if  &lt;math&gt;W_e&lt;/math&gt; is infinite, by the fact that the cost function satisfies the limit condition, some number will eventually be enumerated into A to meet the requirement.

==== Equivalent characterizations ====

K-triviality turns out to coincide with some computational lowness notions, saying that a set is close to computable. The following notions capture the same class of sets.
&lt;ref name="AndreNies"/&gt;

===== Lowness  for ''K'' =====

We say that ''A''  is low for ''K''  if there is ''b'' ∈ ℕ such that

:&lt;math&gt;   \forall n K^A(n)+b \geq K(n). &lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt; K^A&lt;/math&gt; is prefix-free [[Kolmogorov complexity]] relative to  oracle &lt;math&gt; A&lt;/math&gt;.

===== Lowness for Martin-Löf-randomness =====

A is low for Martin-Löf-randomness&lt;ref&gt;Antonin Kučera and Sebastiaan A. Terwijn (1999), "Lowness for the Class of Random Sets", ''The Journal of Symbolic Logic'', Vol. 64, No. 4 (Dec., 1999), pp. 1396–1402&lt;/ref&gt; if whenever Z  is [[Algorithmically random sequence|Martin-Löf random]], it is already [[Algorithmically random sequence|Martin-Löf random]] relative to ''A''.

===== Base for Martin-Löf-randomness =====

''A'' is a base for Martin-Löf-randomness if ''A'' is [[Turing reduction|Turing reducible]] to ''Z'' for some set ''Z'' that is [[Algorithmically random sequence|Martin-Löf random]] relative to ''A''.

&lt;ref name="AndreNies" /&gt;

More equivalent characterizations of K-triviality have been studied, such as: 
# Lowness for weakly-2-randomness;
# Lowness for difference-left-c.e. reals (notice here no randomness is mentioned).

=== Developments after 2008 ===

From 2009 on, concepts from analysis entered the stage.  This helped solving some notorious problems.

One says that a set Y is a positive density point if every effectively closed class containing Y has positive lower Lebesgue density at Y.  Bienvenu, Hölzl, Miller, and Nies&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Bienvenu, Rupert Hölzl, Joseph S. Miller, and André Nies, (2012), "The Denjoy alternative for computable functions", Proceedings of the 29th International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science (STACS 2012), volume 14 of Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics, pages 543–554. Schloss Dagstuhl–Leibniz-Zentrum fuer Informatik, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that a ML-random is Turing incomplete iff it is a positive density point.  Day and Miller&lt;ref&gt;J. Miller, A. Day. (2012) "Cupping with random sets", To appear in the Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society&lt;/ref&gt; used this for an affirmative answer to the ML-cupping problem:&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Nies, Randomness and computability: Open questions. Bull. Symb. Logic. 12 no 3 (2006) 390-410&lt;/ref&gt; A is K-trivial iff for every Martin-Löf random set Z such that A⊕Z compute the [[halting problem]], already Z by itself computes the [[halting problem]].

One says that a set Y is a density-one point if every effectively closed class containing Y has Lebesgue density 1 at Y.  Any  Martin-Löf random set that is not a density-one point computes every K trivial set by Bienvenu, et al.&lt;ref&gt;Bienvenu, Greenberg, Kucera, Nies and Turetsky, "K-Triviality, Oberwolfach Randomness, and Differentiability", Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach, Oberwolfach Preprints (OWP), {{issn|1864-7596}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Day and Miller showed that there is Martin-Löf random set which is a positive density point but not a density one point.  Thus there is an incomplete such Martin-Löf random set which computes every K-trivial set.  This affirmatively answered the [[covering problem]] first asked by Stephan and then published by Miller and Nies.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Nies, Randomness and computability: Open questions. Bull. Symb. Logic. 12 no 3 (2006) 390–410&lt;/ref&gt;  For a summary see L. Bienvenu, A. Day, N. Greenberg, A. Kucera, J. Miller, A. Nies, and D. Turetsky&lt;ref&gt;Computing K-trivial sets by incomplete random sets. Bull. Symbolic Logic. 20, March 2014, pp 80-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Variants of K-triviality have been studied:
* [[Schnorr trivial sets]] where the machines have domain with computable measure.
* [[strongly jump traceable sets]], a lowness property of sets far inside K-triviality.

[[Academic]]-[[History|historical]] research into [[Jewish mysticism]] is a modern multi-discipline [[university]] branch of [[Jewish studies]]. It studies the texts and historical contexts of Judaic mysticism using objective historical-critical methods of [[Religious studies]], such as [[Philology]], [[History of ideas]], [[Social history]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]]. The historical development of Jewish mysticism under study covers the range of phases, forms and expressions, from early Rabbinic [[Merkabah mysticism]], through Medieval [[Hasidei Ashkenaz]] and [[Kabbalah|Classical Kabbalah]], early-modern [[Lurianic Kabbalah|Safed Kabbalah]] and [[Sabbateanism]], to modern [[Hasidism]] and 20th century expressions. It is often seen as a parallel field to academic research into rationalist [[Jewish philosophy]], though some scholars contribute in both areas. In Israel both subjects, together with [[Musar literature|Ethical literature]], share the unbrella department of [[Jewish thought]].

Historical research into Jewish mysticism was first prepared by the 19th century [[Wissenschaft des Judentums]] school, whose [[historiography]] ignored, opposed or downplayed Kabbalah. The founding of the present flourishing University discipline is attributed to [[Gershom Scholem]] and his school in the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] in the 20th century, whose historiography positioned Jewish mysticism as a mainstream vitalising source in the centre of Jewish development. A second generation of scholars are today found in Israel, the United States and Europe. The field is broadly divided into three camps:&lt;ref&gt;''Studies in East European Jewish Mysticism and Hasidism'' (Littman Library of Jewish Civilization). The introduction by [[Joseph Dan]] surveys the field of Jewish mysticism academia today, citing the first two categories as two departments in Universities: the (philological) "mystics" and the (social) "historians". In the past, each kept to separate domains, but now multi-disciplinary crossover fertilisation prevails. The third, religious historiography camp is referenced in the academic scholarship, welcoming the research, but cautioning use of its findings&lt;/ref&gt;
# Professors/researchers of Jewish mysticism/thought in academia, who study Jewish mysticism through its internal textual development
# Professors/researchers of Jewish history/society in academia, who contribute to the study of Jewish mysticism through its external social contexts
# Independent historian researchers outside of Universities, who follow a religious historiography, but use the scholarly academic apparatus of research, sourcing and presentation. This research is most common in relation to Hasidism, due to its social popularisation of Kabbalah. These works are not usually cited in the critical-methodology of academia, but work is being done to examine their findings

Spiritual figures within the Jewish mystical tradition are not listed here, but in [[Timeline List of Jewish Kabbalists]]. Contemporary teachers of Jewish mysticism across the [[Jewish denominations]], listed there, should only be listed here if they also publish scholarly-form historical research into Jewish mysticism. Academic scholars of Jewish mysticism have followed a diverse range in personal belief commitment or detachment to Jewish mysticism, independent of their research.

{{ocean habitat topics|image=Callyspongia sp. (Tube sponge).jpg|caption=[[Coral reef]]s provide marine habitats for tube sponges, which in turn become marine habitats for fishes}}

&lt;!-- This article uses UK English --&gt;
The marine environment supplies many kinds of [[habitat]]s that support marine life. [[Marine life]] depends in some way on the [[seawater|saltwater]] that is in the sea (the term ''marine'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''mare'', meaning sea or ocean). A habitat is an [[ecological]] or [[Natural environment|environmental]] area inhabited by one or more living  [[species]].&lt;ref name="Dickinson 63"&gt;Dickinson, C.I. 1963. ''British Seaweeds.'' The Kew Series&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abercrombie 66"&gt;Abercrombie, M., Hickman, C.J. and Johnson, M.L. 1966.''A Dictionary of Biology.'' Penguin Reference Books, London&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marine habitats''' can be divided into [[coastal]] and [[open ocean]] habitats. Coastal habitats are found in the area that extends from as far as the tide comes in on the [[shoreline]] out to the edge of the [[continental shelf]]. Most marine life is found in coastal habitats, even though the shelf area occupies only seven percent of the total ocean area. Open ocean habitats are found in the deep ocean beyond the edge of the continental shelf.

Alternatively, marine habitats can be divided into [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]] and [[demersal zone]]s. Pelagic habitats are found near the surface or in the open [[water column]], away from the bottom of the ocean. Demersal habitats are near or on the bottom of the ocean. An organism living in a pelagic habitat is said to be a pelagic organism, as in [[pelagic fish]]. Similarly, an organism living in a demersal habitat is said to be a demersal organism, as in [[demersal fish]]. Pelagic habitats are intrinsically shifting and ephemeral, depending on what [[ocean current]]s are doing.

Marine habitats can be modified by their inhabitants. Some marine organisms, like [[coral]]s, [[kelp]], [[mangrove]]s and [[seagrass]]es, are [[ecosystem engineer]]s which reshape the marine environment to the point where they create further habitat for other organisms.
__TOC__
{{clear}}

==Overview==
[[File:BlueMarble-2001-2002.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Only 29 percent of the world surface is land. The rest is ocean, home to the marine habitats. The oceans are nearly four kilometres deep on average and are fringed with coastlines that run for nearly 380,000 kilometres.|alt=Two views of the ocean from space]]

In contrast to terrestrial habitats, marine habitats are shifting and ephemeral. Swimming organisms find areas by the edge of a [[continental shelf]] a good habitat, but only while [[upwelling]]s bring nutrient rich water to the surface. Shellfish find habitat on sandy beaches, but storms, tides and currents mean their habitat continually reinvents itself.

The presence of [[seawater]] is common to all marine habitats. Beyond that many other things determine whether a marine area makes a good habitat and the type of habitat it makes. For example:
* temperature – is affected by geographical [[latitude]], [[ocean currents]], [[weather]], the discharge of rivers, and by the presence of [[hydrothermal vent]]s or [[cold seep]]s
* sunlight – [[photosynthetic]] processes depend on how deep and [[turbid]] the water is
* nutrients – are transported by ocean currents to different marine habitats from [[land runoff]], or by upwellings from the deep sea, or they sink through the sea as [[marine snow]]
* salinity – varies, particularly in [[estuaries]] or near [[river delta]]s, or by hydrothermal vents
* dissolved gases – oxygen levels in particular, can be increased by wave actions and decreased during [[algal bloom]]s
* acidity – this is partly to do with dissolved gases above, since the acidity of the ocean is largely controlled by how much carbon dioxide is in the water.
* turbulence –  [[ocean wave]]s, fast currents and the agitation of water affect the nature of habitats
* cover – the availability of cover such as the adjacency of the [[Benthic zone|sea bottom]], or the presence of [[Pelagic fish#Floating objects|floating objects]]
* the occupying organisms themselves – since organisms modify their habitats by the act of occupying them, and some, like corals, kelp, mangroves and seagrasses, create further habitats for other organisms.

The ocean occupies 71 percent of the world surface, averaging nearly four kilometres in depth. There are five major oceans, of which the [[Pacific Ocean]] is nearly as large as the rest put together. Coastlines fringe the land for nearly 380,000 kilometres.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Marine habitats can be broadly divided into [[pelagic]] and [[demersal]] habitats.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Pelagic habitats are the habitats of the open [[water column]], away from the bottom of the ocean. Demersal habitats are the habitats that are near or on the bottom of the ocean. An organism living in a pelagic habitat is said to be a pelagic organism, as in [[pelagic fish]]. Similarly, an organism living in a demersal habitat is said to be a demersal organism, as in [[demersal fish]]. Pelagic habitats are intrinsically ephemeral, depending on what [[ocean current]]s are doing.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

The land-based [[ecosystem]] depends on topsoil and fresh water, while the marine ecosystem depends on dissolved nutrients washed down from the land.&lt;ref name=science299_5607_673 /&gt;

==Ocean currents==
[[File:Oceanic gyres.png|thumb|left|[[Ocean gyre]]s rotate clockwise in the north and counterclockwise in the south]]

In marine systems, [[ocean current]]s have a key role determining which areas are effective as habitats, since ocean currents transport the basic nutrients needed to support marine life.&lt;ref name="Marietta Ocean"&gt;[http://www.marietta.edu/~biol/biomes/oceans.htm Ocean Habitats] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523231058/http://www.marietta.edu/~biol/biomes/oceans.htm |date=2011-05-23 }} ''Marietta College''. Retrieved 17 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plankton]] are the life forms that inhabit the ocean that are so small (less than 2&amp;nbsp;mm) that they cannot effectively propel themselves through the water, but must drift instead with the currents. If the current carries the right nutrients, and if it also flows at a suitably shallow depth where there is plenty of sunlight, then such a current itself can become a suitable habitat for photosynthesizing tiny algae called [[phytoplankton]]. These tiny plants are the [[Primary production|primary producers]] in the ocean, at the start of the [[food chain]]. In turn, as the population of drifting phytoplankton grows, the water becomes a suitable habitat for [[zooplankton]], which feed on the phytoplankton. While phytoplankton are tiny drifting plants, zooplankton are tiny drifting animals, such as the [[larvae]] of [[fish]] and [[marine invertebrate]]s. If sufficient zooplankton establish themselves, the current becomes a candidate habitat for the [[forage fish]] that feed on them. And then if sufficient forage fish move to the area, it becomes a candidate habitat for larger [[predatory fish]] and other marine animals that feed on the forage fish. In this dynamic way, the current itself can, over time, become a moving habitat for multiple types of marine life.

[[File:Cwall99 lg.jpg|thumb|right|This [[algae bloom]] occupies sunlit [[epipelagic]] waters off the southern coast of England. The algae are maybe feeding on nutrients from [[land runoff]] or [[upwelling]]s at the edge of the continental shelf]]

Ocean currents can be generated by differences in the density of the water. How dense water is depends on how saline or warm it is. If water contains differences in salt content or temperature, then the different densities will initiate a current. Water that is saltier or cooler will be denser, and will sink in relation to the surrounding water. Conversely, warmer and less salty water will float to the surface. Atmospheric winds and pressure differences also produces surface currents, [[Ocean wave|waves]] and [[seiche]]s. Ocean currents are also generated by the gravitational pull of the sun and moon ([[tide]]s), and seismic activity ([[tsunami]]).&lt;ref name="Marietta Ocean" /&gt;

The rotation of the Earth affects the direction ocean currents take, and explains which way the large circular [[ocean gyre]]s rotate in the image above left. Suppose a current at the equator is heading north. The Earth rotates eastward, so the water possesses that rotational momentum. But the further the water moves north, the slower the earth moves eastward. If the current could get to the North Pole, the earth wouldn't be moving eastward at all. To conserve its rotational momentum, the further the current travels north the faster it must move eastward. So the effect is that the current curves to the right. This is the [[Coriolis effect]]. It is weakest at the equator and strongest at the poles. The effect is opposite south of the equator, where currents curve left.&lt;ref name="Marietta Ocean" /&gt;

==Marine topography==
[[File:Ocean gravity map.gif|right|thumb|300px|Map of underwater topography (1995 [[NOAA]])]]

Marine (or seabed or ocean) [[topography]] refers to the shape the land has when it interfaces with the ocean. These shapes are obvious along coastlines, but they occur also in significant ways underwater. The effectiveness of marine habitats is partially defined by these shapes, including the way they interact with and shape [[ocean current]]s, and the way sunlight diminishes when these landforms occupy increasing depths. Tidal networks depend on the balance between sedimentary processes and hydrodynamics however, anthropogenic influences can impact the natural system more than any physical driver.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Coco, Z. Zhou, B. van Maanen, M. Olabarrieta, R. Tinoco, I. Townend. Morphodynamics of tidal networks: Advances and challenges. Marine Geology Journal. 1 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine topographies include [[List of landforms#Coastal and oceanic landforms|coastal and oceanic landforms]] ranging from coastal [[Estuary|estuaries]] and [[shoreline]]s to [[continental shelf|continental shelves]] and [[coral reef]]s. Further out in the open ocean, they include underwater and [[deep sea]] features such as ocean rises and [[seamount]]s. The submerged surface has mountainous features, including a globe-spanning [[mid-ocean ridge]] system, as well as undersea [[volcano]]es,&lt;ref name="ngdc2006" /&gt; [[oceanic trench]]es, [[submarine canyon]]s, [[oceanic plateau]]s and [[abyssal plain]]s.

The mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35{{e|18}}&amp;nbsp;[[metric ton]]s, or about 1/4400 of the total mass of the Earth. The oceans cover an area of 3.618{{e|8}}&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a mean depth of 3,682&amp;nbsp;m, resulting in an estimated volume of 1.332{{e|9}}&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=ocean23_2_112 /&gt;

==Coastal==
[[File:Porto Covo pano April 2009-4.jpg|thumb|360px|right|Coastlines can be volatile habitats]]
{{see also|Coast|Coastal biogeomorphology|Coastal fish}}

[[Coast|Marine coasts]] are dynamic environments which constantly change, like the ocean which partially shape them. The Earth's natural processes, including [[weather]] and [[sea level rise|sea level change]], result in the [[erosion]], [[Accretion (geology)|accretion]] and resculpturing of coasts as well as the flooding and creation of [[continental shelf|continental shelves]] and [[drowned river valley]]s.

The main agents responsible for deposition and [[erosion]] along coastlines are [[wind wave|waves]], [[tide]]s and [[Ocean current|currents]]. The formation of coasts also depends on the [[lithology|nature of the rocks]] they are made of – the harder the rocks the less likely they are to erode, so variations in rock hardness result in coastlines with different shapes.

[[Tide]]s often determine the range over which [[sediment]] is deposited or eroded. Areas with high tidal ranges allow waves to reach farther up the shore, and areas with lower tidal ranges produce deposition at a smaller elevation interval. The tidal range is influenced by the size and shape of the coastline. Tides do not typically cause erosion by themselves; however, [[tidal bore]]s can erode as the waves surge up river [[Estuary|estuaries]] from the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson (2002), p.421.&lt;/ref&gt;

Waves erode coastline as they break on shore releasing their energy; the larger the wave the more energy it releases and the more sediment it moves. Sediment deposited by waves comes from eroded cliff faces and is moved along the coastline by the waves. Sediment deposited by rivers is the dominant influence on the amount of sediment located on a coastline.&lt;ref&gt;Easterbrook (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sedimentology|sedimentologist]] [[Francis Shepard]] classified coasts as ''primary'' or ''secondary''.&lt;ref name="Shepard"&gt;Shepard FP (1937) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30056777 Revised "Classification of Marine Shorelines"] ''The Journal of Geology,'' '''45'''(6): 602–624.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Primary coasts are shaped by non-marine processes, by changes in the land form. If a coast is in much the same condition as it was when sea level was stabilised after the last ice age, it is called a primary coast.&lt;ref name="Shepard" /&gt; "Primary coasts are created by erosion (the wearing away of soil or rock), deposition (the buildup of sediment or sand) or tectonic activity (changes in the structure of the rock and soil because of earthquakes). Many of these coastlines were formed as the sea level rose during the last 18,000 years, submerging river and glacial valleys to form bays and fjords."&lt;ref name=ONR&gt;[http://www.onr.navy.mil/focus/ocean/habitats/beaches2.htm Habitats: Beaches - Coasts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426043554/http://www.onr.navy.mil/focus/ocean/habitats/beaches2.htm |date=2011-04-26 }} ''[[Office of Naval Research]]''. Retrieved 17 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a primary coast is a [[river delta]], which forms when a river deposits soil and other material as it enters the sea.&lt;ref name=ONR /&gt;
* Secondary coasts are produced by marine processes, such as the action of the sea or by creatures that live in it. Secondary coastlines include [[sea cliff]]s, [[barrier island]]s, [[mud flat]]s, [[coral reef]]s, [[mangrove swamp]]s and [[salt marsh]]es.&lt;ref name=ONR /&gt;

[[File:Elevation.jpg|thumb|260px|left|{{legend|#03FCDE|The global continental shelf, highlighted in cyan, defines the extent of coastal habitats, and occupies 5% of the total world area.}}]]

Continental coastlines usually have a [[continental shelf]], a shelf of relatively shallow water, less than 200 metres deep, which extends 68&amp;nbsp;km on average beyond the coast. Worldwide, continental shelves occupy a total area of about 24 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (9 million sq mi), 8% of the ocean's total area and nearly 5% of the world's total area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthtrends.wri.org/text/coastal-marine/variable-62.html Continental shelf areas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202232634/http://earthtrends.wri.org/text/coastal-marine/variable-62.html |date=2008-12-02 }} ''Earth trends''. Retrieved 25 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CIAWorld&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html World] The World Factbook, CIA. Retrieved 26 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the continental shelf is usually less than 200 metres deep, it follows that coastal habitats are generally [[Photic zone|photic]], situated in the sunlit [[epipelagic zone]]. This means the conditions for [[photosynthetic]] processes so important for [[primary production]], are available to coastal marine habitats. Because land is nearby, there are large discharges of nutrient rich [[land runoff]] into coastal waters. Further, periodic [[upwelling]]s from the deep ocean can provide cool and nutrient rich currents along the edge of the continental shelf.

As a result, coastal marine life is the most abundant in the world. It is found in [[tidal pool]]s, [[fjord]]s and [[estuaries]], near sandy shores and rocky coastlines, around [[coral reef]]s and on or above the continental shelf. [[Coastal fish]] include small forage fish as well as the larger [[predator fish]] that feed on them. [[Forage fish]] thrive in inshore waters where high [[Primary production|productivity]] results from [[upwelling]] and shoreline run off of nutrients. Some are partial residents that spawn in streams, estuaries and bays, but most complete their life cycle in the zone.&lt;ref name="Moyle572"&gt;Moyle and Cech, 2004, page 572&lt;/ref&gt; There can also be a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]] between species that occupy adjacent marine habitats. For example, [[fringing reef]]s just below [[low tide]] level have a mutually beneficial relationship with [[mangrove]] forests at high tide level and [[sea grass]] meadows in between: the reefs protect the mangroves and seagrass from strong currents and waves that would damage them or [[erosion|erode]] the sediments in which they are rooted, while the mangroves and seagrass protect the coral from large influxes of [[silt]], fresh water and [[pollution|pollutants]]. This additional level of variety in the environment is beneficial to many types of coral reef animals, which for example may feed in the sea grass and use the reefs for protection or breeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Coastal habitats are the most visible marine habitats, but they are not the only important marine habitats. Coastlines run for 380,000 kilometres, and the total volume of the ocean is 1,370 million cu km. This means that for each metre of coast, there is 3.6 cu km of ocean space available somewhere for marine habitats.

[[File:La Désirade.JPG|thumb|right|Waves and currents shape the intertidal shoreline, eroding the softer rocks and transporting and grading loose particles into shingles, sand or mud]]

===Intertidal===
[[Intertidal zone]]s, those areas close to shore, are constantly being exposed and covered by the ocean's [[tides]]. A huge array of life lives within this zone.

Shore habitats range from the upper intertidal zones to the area where land vegetation takes prominence. It can be underwater anywhere from daily to very infrequently. Many species here are scavengers, living off of sea life that is washed up on the shore. Many land animals also make much use of the shore and intertidal habitats. A subgroup of organisms in this habitat bores and grinds exposed rock through the process of [[bioerosion]].

===Sandy shores===
[[File:The White Rocks near Portrush (1) - geograph.org.uk - 785899.jpg|thumb|right|Sandy shores provide shifting homes to many species]]
{{see also|Beach}}

Sandy shores, also called [[beach]]es, are coastal shorelines where [[sand]] accumulates. Waves and currents shift the sand, continually building and eroding the shoreline. [[Longshore current]]s flow parallel to the beaches, making waves break obliquely on the sand. These currents transport large amounts of sand along coasts, forming [[Spit (landform)|spits]], [[barrier island]]s and [[tombolo]]s. Longshore currents also commonly create [[offshore bar]]s, which give beaches some stability by reducing erosion.&lt;ref name="Habitats: Beaches - Characteristics"&gt;[http://www.onr.navy.mil/focus/ocean/habitats/beaches1.htm Habitats: Beaches - Characteristics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526121836/http://www.onr.navy.mil/focus/ocean/habitats/beaches1.htm |date=2011-05-26 }} ''[[Office of Naval Research]]''. Retrieved 17 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandy shores are full of life, The grains of sand host [[diatom]]s, [[bacteria]] and other microscopic creatures. Some fish and turtles return to certain beaches and [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] eggs in the sand. Birds habitat beaches, like [[gull]]s, [[loon]]s, [[sandpiper]]s, [[tern]]s and [[pelican]]s. [[Aquatic mammal]]s, such sea lions, recuperate on them. [[Clam]]s, [[Littorinidae|periwinkle]]s, [[crab]]s, [[shrimp]], [[starfish]] and [[sea urchin]]s are found on most beaches.&lt;ref name="Habitats: Beaches - Animal &amp; Plant Life"&gt;[http://www.onr.navy.mil/focus/ocean/habitats/beaches3.htm Habitats: Beaches - Animal &amp; Plant Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526121525/http://www.onr.navy.mil/focus/ocean/habitats/beaches3.htm |date=2011-05-26 }} ''[[Office of Naval Research]]''.

Sand is a [[sediment]] made from small grains or [[Particle (ecology)|particles]] with diameters between about 60&amp;nbsp;µm and 2&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;Wentworth CK (1922) [https://www.jstor.org/pss/30063207 "A scale of grade and class terms for clastic sediments"] ''J. Geology,'' '''30''': 377–392.&lt;/ref&gt; Mud (see [[Marine habitats#Mudflats|mudflats]] below) is a sediment made from particles finer than sand. This small particle size means that mud particles tend to stick together, whereas sand particles do not. Mud is not easily shifted by waves and currents, and when it dries out, cakes into a solid. By contrast, sand is easily shifted by waves and currents, and when sand dries out it can be blown in the wind, accumulating into shifting [[sand dune]]s. Beyond the high tide mark, if the beach is low-lying, the wind can form rolling hills of sand dunes. Small dunes shift and reshape under the influence of the wind while larger dunes stabilise the sand with vegetation.&lt;ref name="Habitats: Beaches - Characteristics" /&gt;

Ocean processes grade loose sediments to [[Particle size (grain size)|particle sizes]] other than sand, such as [[gravel]] or [[Cobble (geology)|cobble]]s. Waves breaking on a beach can leave a [[berm]], which is a raised ridge of coarser pebbles or sand, at the high tide mark. [[Shingle beach]]es are made of particles larger than sand, such as cobbles, or small stones. These beaches make poor habitats. Little life survives because the stones are churned and pounded together by waves and currents.&lt;ref name="Habitats: Beaches - Characteristics" /&gt;

===Rocky shores===
[[File:Porto Covo February 2009-2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tidepool]]s on rocky shores make turbulent habitats for many forms of marine life]]
{{see also|Rocky shore|Tidal pool}}

The relative solidity of [[rocky shore]]s seems to give them a permanence compared to the shifting nature of sandy shores. This apparent stability is not real over even quite short geological time scales, but it is real enough over the short life of an organism. In contrast to sandy shores, plants and animals can anchor themselves to the rocks.&lt;ref name="Tour of Rocky Shoreline Habitats"&gt;[http://www.marietta.edu/~biol/biomes/rocky_shores.htm Tour of Rocky Shoreline Habitats] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524105825/http://www.marietta.edu/~biol/biomes/rocky_shores.htm |date=2011-05-24 }} ''Marietta College''. Retrieved 17 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition can develop for the rocky spaces. For example, [[barnacle]]s can compete successfully on open intertidal rock faces to the point where the rock surface is covered with them. Barnacles resist desiccation and grip well to exposed rock faces. However, in the crevices of the same rocks, the inhabitants are different. Here [[mussel]]s can be the successful species, secured to the rock with their [[byssal]] threads.&lt;ref name="Tour of Rocky Shoreline Habitats" /&gt;

Rocky and sandy coasts are vulnerable because humans find them attractive and want to live near them. An increasing proportion of the humans live by the coast, putting pressure on coastal habitats.&lt;ref name="Tour of Rocky Shoreline Habitats" /&gt;

===Mudflats===
[[File:Bnstiltpair.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mudflat]]s become temporary habitats for [[Bird migration|migrating birds]]]]
{{See also|Bay mud}}

[[Mudflat]]s are coastal wetlands that form when mud is deposited by tides or rivers. They are found in sheltered areas such as [[bays]], [[bayous]], [[lagoons]], and [[estuaries]]. Mudflats may be viewed [[geologic]]ally as exposed layers of [[bay mud]], resulting from deposition of [[estuarine]] [[silt]]s, [[clay]]s and marine animal [[detritus]].  Most of the sediment within a mudflat is within the [[intertidal zone]], and thus the flat is submerged and exposed approximately twice daily.

Mudflats are typically important regions for wildlife, supporting a large population, although levels of biodiversity are not particularly high. They are of particular importance to [[migratory bird]]s. In the [[United Kingdom]] mudflats have been classified as a [[Biodiversity Action Plan]] priority habitat.

===Estuaries===
[[File:Conwy Estuary - geograph.org.uk - 575854.jpg|thumb|right|[[Estuaries]] occur when rivers flow into a coastal bay or inlet. They are nutrient rich and have a transition zone which moves from freshwater to saltwater.]]

An [[estuary]] is a partly enclosed [[coastal]] body of [[water]] with one or more [[river]]s or [[stream]]s flowing into it, and with a free connection to the open [[sea]].&lt;ref name="Pritchard"&gt;Pritchard, D. W. (1967) ''What is an estuary: physical viewpoint''. p. 3–5 ''in:'' G. H. Lauf (ed.) ''Estuaries'', A.A.A.S. Publ. No. 83, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; Estuaries form a transition zone between river environments and ocean environments and are subject to both marine influences, such as tides, waves, and the influx of saline water; and riverine influences, such as flows of fresh water and sediment. The inflow of both seawater and freshwater provide high levels of nutrients in both the water column and sediment, making estuaries among the most productive natural habitats in the world.&lt;ref name="McLusky"&gt;McLusky, D.S. and Elliott, M. (2004) "The Estuarine Ecosystem: ecology, threats and management." New York: Oxford University Press Inc. {{ISBN|0-19-852508-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most estuaries were formed by the flooding of river-eroded or glacially scoured valleys when sea level began to rise about 10,000-12,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Wolanski"&gt;Wolanski, E. (2007) "Estuarine Ecohydrology." Amsterdam, The Netherlands: Elsevier. {{ISBN|978-0-444-53066-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are amongst the most heavily populated areas throughout the world, with about 60% of the world’s population living along estuaries and the coast. As a result, estuaries are suffering degradation by many factors, including sedimentation from soil erosion from deforestation; overgrazing and other poor farming practices; overfishing; drainage and filling of wetlands; eutrophication due to excessive nutrients from sewage and animal wastes; pollutants including heavy metals, PCBs, radionuclides and hydrocarbons from sewage inputs; and diking or damming for flood control or water diversion.&lt;ref name="Wolanski"/&gt;

Estuaries provide habitats for a large number of organisms and support very high productivity. Estuaries provide habitats for [[salmon]] and [[sea trout]] nurseries,&lt;ref&gt;Bronwyn M. Gillanders, [http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps2003/247/m247p281.pdf Evidence of connectivity between juvenile and adult habitats for mobile marine fauna: an important component of nurseries]. 2003. ''Marine Ecology Progress Series''&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Bird migration|migratory]] bird populations.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer A. Gill, [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v412/n6845/abs/412436a0.html The buffer effect and large-scale population regulation in migratory birds]. 2001. ''Nature'' 412, 436-438&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the main characteristics of estuarine life are the variability in [[salinity]] and [[sedimentation]]. Many species of [[fish]] and [[invertebrate]]s have various methods to control or conform to the shifts in salt concentrations and are termed [[osmoconformer]]s and [[osmoregulator]]s. Many animals also [[burrowing|burrow]] to avoid [[predation]] and to live in the more stable sedimental environment. However, large numbers of bacteria are found within the sediment which have a very high oxygen demand. This reduces the levels of oxygen within the sediment often resulting in partially [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] conditions, which can be further exacerbated by limited water flux. [[Phytoplankton]] are key primary producers in estuaries. They move with the water bodies and can be flushed in and out with the [[tide]]s. Their productivity is largely dependent on the [[turbidity]] of the water. The main phytoplankton present are [[diatoms]] and [[dinoflagellates]] which are abundant in the sediment.

===Kelp forests===
{{further|Kelp forest}}
[[File:Kelp forest.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kelp forest]]s provide habitat for many marine organisms]]

[[Kelp forest]]s are underwater areas with a high density of [[kelp]]. They form some of the most productive and dynamic [[ecosystem]]s on Earth.&lt;ref name="Mann (1973)"&gt;Mann, K.H. 1973. Seaweeds: their productivity and strategy for growth. Science 182: 975-981.&lt;/ref&gt;   Smaller areas of anchored kelp are called ''kelp beds''. Kelp forests occur worldwide throughout [[temperate]] and [[polar region|polar]] coastal oceans.&lt;ref name="Mann (1973)"/&gt;

Kelp forests provide a unique three-dimensional habitat for marine organisms and are a source for understanding many ecological processes. Over the last century, they have been the focus of extensive research, particularly in [[Trophic dynamics|trophic]] ecology, and continue to provoke important ideas that are relevant beyond this unique ecosystem. For example, kelp forests can influence coastal [[oceanographic]] patterns&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, G.A. and C.D. Winant. 1983. Effect of a kelp forest on coastal currents. Continental Shelf Report 2: 75-80.&lt;/ref&gt; and provide many [[ecosystem services]].&lt;ref name="Steneck 2002"&gt;Steneck, R.S., M.H. Graham, B.J. Bourque, D. Corbett, J.M. Erlandson, J.A. Estes and M.J. Tegner. 2002. Kelp forest ecosystems: biodiversity, stability, resilience and future. Environmental Conservation 29: 436-459.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, humans have contributed to kelp forest degradation. Of particular concern are the effects of [[overfishing]] nearshore ecosystems, which can release [[herbivores]] from their normal population regulation and result in the over-grazing of kelp and other algae.&lt;ref name="Sala1998"&gt;Sala, E., C.F. Bourdouresque and M. Harmelin-Vivien. 1998. Fishing, trophic cascades, and the structure of algal assemblages: evaluation of an old but untested paradigm. Oikos 82: 425-439.&lt;/ref&gt; This can rapidly result in transitions to barren landscapes where relatively few species persist.&lt;ref name="Dayton 1985a"&gt;Dayton, P.K. 1985a. Ecology of kelp communities. Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics 16: 215-245.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequently considered an [[ecosystem engineer]], kelp provides a physical substrate and habitat for kelp forest communities.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, C.G., J. H. Lawton and M. Shachak. 1997. Positive and negative effects of organisms as physical ecosystem engineers. Ecology 78: 1946-1957.&lt;/ref&gt; In algae (Kingdom: [[Protista]]), the body of an individual organism is known as a [[thallus]] rather than as a plant (Kingdom: [[Plantae]]). The morphological structure of a kelp thallus is defined by three basic structural units:&lt;ref name="Dayton 1985a"/&gt;
:* The [[holdfast]] is a root-like mass that anchors the thallus to the sea floor, though unlike true roots it is not responsible for absorbing and delivering nutrients to the rest of the thallus;
:* The [[Stipe (botany)|stipe]] is analogous to a plant stalk, extending vertically from the holdfast and providing a support framework for other morphological features;
:* The [[fronds]] are leaf- or blade-like attachments extending from the stipe, sometimes along its full length, and are the sites of nutrient uptake and photosynthetic activity.
In addition, many kelp species have [[pneumatocyst]]s, or gas-filled bladders, usually located at the base of fronds near the stipe. These structures provide the necessary buoyancy for kelp to maintain an upright position in the water column.

The environmental factors necessary for kelp to survive include hard substrate (usually rock), high nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus), and light (minimum annual [[irradiance]] dose &gt; 50 E m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Druehl 1981"&gt;Druehl, L.D. 1981. The distribution of Laminariales in the North Pacific with reference to environmental influences. Proceedings of the International Congress on Systematic Evolution and Biology 2: 248-256.&lt;/ref&gt;). Especially productive kelp forests tend to be associated with areas of significant oceanographic [[upwelling]], a process that delivers cool nutrient-rich water from depth to the ocean’s [[mixed layer|mixed surface layer]].&lt;ref name="Druehl 1981"/&gt; Water flow and turbulence facilitate nutrient assimilation across kelp fronds throughout the water column.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, W.N. 1980. Effect of boundary layer transport on the fixation of carbon by the giant kelp ''Macrocystis pyrifera''. Marine Biology 56: 103-110.&lt;/ref&gt; Water clarity affects the depth to which sufficient light can be transmitted. In ideal conditions, giant kelp (''Macrocystis spp.'') can grow as much as 30-60 centimetres vertically per day. Some species such as ''Nereocystis'' are [[annual plant|annual]] while others like ''Eisenia'' are [[perennial plant|perennial]], living for more than 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Steneck, R.S. and M.N. Dethier. 1994. A functional group approach to the structure of algal-dominated communities. Oikos 69: 476-498.&lt;/ref&gt; In perennial kelp forests, maximum growth rates occur during upwelling months (typically spring and summer) and die-backs correspond to reduced nutrient availability, shorter photoperiods and increased storm frequency.&lt;ref name="Dayton 1985a"/&gt;

===Seagrass meadows===
[[File:White-spotted puffer.jpg|thumb|right|[[White-spotted puffer]]s like living in seagrass areas]]

[[Seagrass]]es are [[flowering plant]]s from one of four plant families which grow in marine environments. They are called ''seagrasses'' because the leaves are long and narrow and are very often green, and because the plants often grow in large meadows which look like grassland. Since seagrasses [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]] and are submerged, they must grow submerged in the [[photic zone]], where there is enough sunlight. For this reason, most occur in shallow and sheltered coastal waters anchored in sand or mud bottoms.

Seagrasses form extensive beds or meadows, which can be either monospecific (made up of one species) or multispecific (where more than one species co-exist). Seagrass beds make highly diverse and productive [[ecosystem]]s. They are home to [[phylum|phyla]] such as juvenile and adult fish, [[Epiphyte|epiphytic]] and free-living [[Seaweed|macroalgae]] and [[Microphyte|microalgae]], [[mollusk]]s, [[bristle worm]]s, and [[nematode]]s.  Few species were originally considered to feed directly on seagrass [[leaf|leaves]] (partly because of their low nutritional content), but scientific [[review]]s and improved working methods have shown that seagrass [[Herbivore|herbivory]] is a highly important link in the food chain, with hundreds of species feeding on seagrasses worldwide, including [[green turtle]]s, [[dugong]]s, [[manatee]]s, [[fish]], [[Goose|geese]], [[swan]]s, [[sea urchin]]s and [[crab]]s.

Seagrasses are [[ecosystem engineer]]s in the sense that they partly create their own habitat. The leaves slow down water-currents increasing [[sedimentation]], and the seagrass [[root]]s and [[rhizome]]s stabilize the seabed. Their importance to associated species is mainly due to provision of shelter (through their three-dimensional structure in the water column), and due to their extraordinarily high rate of [[primary production]]. As a result, seagrasses provide coastal zones with [[ecosystem services]], such as [[fishing ground]]s, [[Wind wave|wave]] protection, [[oxygen]] production and protection against coastal [[erosion]]. Seagrass meadows account for 15% of the ocean’s total carbon storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Coral reefs ===
[[File:Maldivesfish2.jpg|thumb|right]]
{{Main|Coral reef}}

[[Reef]]s comprise some of the densest and most diverse habitats in the world. The best-known types of reefs are [[tropical]] [[coral reef]]s which exist in most tropical waters; however, reefs can also exist in cold water. Reefs are built up by [[coral]]s and other [[calcium]]-depositing animals, usually on top of a rocky outcrop on the ocean floor. Reefs can also grow on other surfaces, which has made it possible to create [[artificial reef]]s. Coral reefs also support a huge community of life, including the corals themselves, their symbiotic [[zooxanthellae]], tropical fish and many other organisms.

Much attention in marine biology is focused on coral reefs and the [[El Niño]] weather phenomenon. In 1998, coral reefs experienced the most severe mass bleaching events on record, when vast expanses of reefs across the world died because sea surface temperatures rose well above normal.&lt;ref&gt;NOAA (1998) Record-breaking coral bleaching occurred in tropics this year. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], Press release (October 23, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ICRS (1998) Statement on Global Coral Bleaching in 1997-1998. International Coral Reef Society, October 15, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Some reefs are recovering, but scientists say that between 50% and 70% of the world's coral reefs are now endangered and predict that [[global warming]] could exacerbate this trend.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, D., Burke, L., McManus, J., et al.

==Open ocean==
[[File:Earth elevation histogram 2.svg|thumb|left|Elevation-area graph showing the proportion of land area at given heights and the proportion of ocean area at given depths]]
{{See also|Pelagic fish}}

The open ocean is relatively unproductive because of a lack of nutrients, yet because it is so vast, it has more overall [[primary production]] than any other marine habitat. Only about 10 percent of marine species live in the open ocean. But among them are the largest and fastest of all marine animals, as well as the animals that dive the deepest and migrate the longest. In the depths lurk animal that, to our eyes, appear hugely alien.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/blue_planet/open_ocean/ Blue Planet: Open ocean] ''WWF'. Retrieved 17 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surface waters===
[[File:Starr 061214-2478 Chenopodium oahuense.jpg|thumb|right|In the open ocean, sunlit surface [[epipelagic]] waters get enough light for photosynthesis, but there are often not enough nutrients. As a result, large areas contain little life apart from migrating animals.&lt;ref name=sunlit /&gt;]]

The surface waters are sunlit. The waters down to about 200 metres are said to be in the [[epipelagic zone]]. Enough sunlight enters the epipelagic zone to allow [[photosynthesis]] by [[phytoplankton]]. The epipelagic zone is usually low in nutrients. This partially because the organic debris produced in the zone, such as excrement and dead animals, sink to the depths and are lost to the upper zone. Photosynthesis can happen only if both sunlight and nutrients are present.&lt;ref name=sunlit&gt;[http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/blue_planet/open_ocean/surface_waters/ Ocean ecology: sunlit surface waters] ''WWF'. Retrieved 17 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some places, like at the edge of continental shelves, nutrients can [[upwell]] from the ocean depth, or [[land runoff]] can be distributed by storms and ocean currents. In these areas, given that both sunlight and nutrients are now present, phytoplankton can rapidly establish itself, multiplying so fast that the water turns green from the chlorophyll, resulting in an [[algal bloom]]. These nutrient rich surface waters are among the most biologically productive in the world, supporting billions of tonnes of [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]].&lt;ref name=sunlit /&gt;

"Phytoplankton are eaten by [[zooplankton]] - small animals which, like phytoplankton, drift in the ocean currents. The most abundant zooplankton species are [[copepod]]s and [[krill]]: tiny [[crustacean]]s that are the most numerous animals on Earth. Other types of zooplankton include [[jelly fish]] and the [[larvae]] of fish, [[marine worm]]s, [[starfish]], and other marine organisms".&lt;ref name=sunlit /&gt; In turn, the zooplankton are eaten by [[filter feeding|filter-feeding]] animals, including some [[seabird]]s, small [[forage fish]] like herrings and sardines, [[whale shark]]s, [[manta ray]]s, and the largest animal in the world, the [[blue whale]]. Yet again, moving up the [[foodchain]], the small forage fish are in turn eaten by larger predators, such as tuna, marlin, sharks, large squid, seabirds, dolphins, and [[toothed whale]]s.&lt;ref name=sunlit /&gt;

===Deep sea===
[[File:Pelagiczone.svg|thumb|160px|left|Scale diagram of the layers of the pelagic zone]]
{{see also|Deep sea|Deep sea communities}}

The [[deep sea]] starts at the [[aphotic zone]], the point where sunlight loses most of its energy in the water. Many life forms that live at these depths have the ability to create their own light a unique evolution known as [[bio-luminescence]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In the deep ocean, the waters extend far below the epipelagic zone, and support very different types of pelagic life forms adapted to living in these deeper zones.&lt;ref name="Moyle585"&gt;Moyle and Cech, 2004, page 585&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the [[aphotic zone]]'s energy is supplied by the open ocean in the form of [[detritus]]. In deep water, [[marine snow]] is a continuous shower of mostly organic detritus falling from the upper layers of the water column. Its origin lies in activities within the productive [[photic zone]]. Marine snow includes dead or dying [[plankton]], [[protist]]s ([[diatom]]s), fecal matter, sand, soot and other inorganic dust. The "snowflakes" grow over time and may reach several centimetres in diameter, travelling for weeks before reaching the ocean floor. However, most organic components of marine snow are consumed by [[microbe]]s, [[zooplankton]] and other filter-feeding animals within the first 1,000 metres of their journey, that is, within the epipelagic zone. In this way marine snow may be considered the foundation of deep-sea [[mesopelagic]] and [[benthic]] [[ecosystem]]s: As sunlight cannot reach them, deep-sea organisms rely heavily on marine snow as an energy source.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Some deep-sea pelagic groups, such as the [[lanternfish]], [[ridgehead]], [[marine hatchetfish]], and [[Phosichthyidae|lightfish]] families are sometimes termed ''pseudoceanic'' because, rather than having an even distribution in open water, they occur in significantly higher abundances around structural oases, notably [[seamount]]s and over [[continental slope]]s. The phenomenon is explained by the likewise abundance of prey species which are also attracted to the structures.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

[[File:PSM V23 D086 The deep sea fish eurypharynx pelecanoides.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Pelican eel|umbrella mouth gulper]] eel can swallow a fish much larger than itself]]

The fish in the different pelagic and deep water benthic zones are physically structured, and behave in ways, that differ markedly from each other. Groups of coexisting species within each zone all seem to operate in similar ways, such as the small mesopelagic [[Diel vertical migration|vertically migrating]] plankton-feeders, the bathypelagic [[anglerfish]]es, and the deep water benthic [[rattail]]s. "&lt;ref name="Moyle591"&gt;Moyle and Cech, 2004, p. 591&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Acanthopterygii|Ray finned]] species, with spiny fins, are rare among deep sea fishes, which suggests that deep sea fish are ancient and so well adapted to their environment that invasions by more modern fishes have been unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Haedrich1996"&gt;Haedrich RL (1996) [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119203565/abstract "Deep-water fishes: evolution and adaptation in the earth's largest living spaces"] ''Journal of Fish Biology'' '''49'''(sA):40-53.&lt;/ref&gt; The few ray fins that do exist are mainly in the [[Beryciformes]] and [[Lampriformes]], which are also ancient forms. Most deep sea pelagic fishes belong to their own orders, suggesting a long evolution in deep sea environments. In contrast, deep water benthic species, are in orders that include many related shallow water fishes.&lt;ref name="Moyle586"&gt;Moyle and Cech, 2004, page 586&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pelican eel|umbrella mouth gulper]] is a deep sea eel with an enormous loosely hinged mouth. It can open its mouth wide enough to swallow a fish much larger than itself, and then expand its stomach to accommodate its catch.&lt;ref name=EoF&gt;{{cite book |editor=Paxton, J.R.W.N.|author= McCosker, John E.|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Fishes|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|page= 90|isbn= 0-12-547665-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sea floor==

===Vents and seeps===
[[File:Explorer Ridge Zooarium chimney.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zooid|Zooarium]] chimney provides a habitat for vent biota]]

[[Hydrothermal vent]]s along the [[mid-ocean ridge]] spreading centers act as [[oasis|oases]], as do their opposites, [[cold seeps]]. Such places support unique [[marine biome]]s and many new [[marine microorganism]]s and other lifeforms have been discovered at these locations.

===Trenches===
The deepest recorded [[oceanic trench]]es measure to date is the [[Mariana Trench]], near the [[Philippines]], in the [[Pacific Ocean]] at 10,924&amp;nbsp;m (35,838&amp;nbsp;ft). At such depths, [[water pressure]] is extreme and there is no sunlight, but some life still exists. A white [[flatfish]], a shrimp and a jellyfish were seen by the American crew of the [[bathyscaphe]] ''[[Bathyscaphe Trieste|Trieste]]'' when it dove to the bottom in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjsonline.com/watches/articles/0022_3.shtml Seven Miles Down: The Story of The Bathyscaph Trieste.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202144233/http://bjsonline.com/watches/articles/0022_3.shtml |date=2007-02-02 }}, ''Rolex Deep Sea Special'', January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seamounts===
Marine life also flourishes around [[seamount]]s that rise from the depths, where fish and other sea life congregate to spawn and feed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25746">'''Molecular pathological epidemiology''' ('''MPE''', also '''molecular pathologic epidemiology''') is a [[Discipline (specialism)|discipline]] combining [[epidemiology]] and [[pathology]]. It is defined as "epidemiology of [[molecular pathology]] and [[heterogeneity]] of disease".&lt;ref name="Ogino_2014" /&gt; Pathology and epidemiology share the same goal of elucidating [[etiology]] of disease, and MPE aims to achieve this goal at molecular, individual and population levels. Typically, MPE utilizes [[cell tissue|tissue]] pathology resources and data within existing epidemiology studies. [[Molecular epidemiology]] broadly encompasses MPE and conventional-type molecular epidemiology with the use of traditional disease designation systems.

== Disease process ==
Data from [[The Cancer Genome Atlas]] projects indicate that disease evolution is an inherently heterogeneous process.&lt;ref name="Ogino_2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ogino_2012"/&gt; Each patient has a unique disease process (“the unique disease principle”), considering the uniqueness of the [[exposome]] and its unique influence on molecular pathologic process.&lt;ref name="Ogino_2013"/&gt; This concept has been adopted in clinical medicine along with [[precision medicine]] and [[personalized medicine]].

== Methodology ==
In MPE, investigators dissect interrelationships between exposures (e.g., environmental, dietary, lifestyle and genetic factors); alterations in cellular or extracellular molecules (disease molecular signatures); and disease evolution and progression.&lt;ref name="Ogino_2013" /&gt; Investigators can analyze [[genome]], [[methylome]], [[epigenome]], [[metabolome]], [[transcriptome]], [[proteome]], [[microbiome]], [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] and [[interactome]]. A putative risk factor can be linked to specific molecular signatures.

MPE research enables identification of a new [[biomarker]] for potential clinical utility, using large-scale population-based data (e.g., [[P110α|PIK3CA]] [[mutation]] in [[colorectal cancer]] to select patients for [[aspirin]] therapy).&lt;ref name="Ogino_2014"/&gt; The MPE approach can be used following a [[genome-wide association study]] (GWAS), termed "GWAS-MPE approach".&lt;ref name="Ogino_2011"/&gt; Detailed disease endpoint phenotyping can be conducted by means of molecular pathology or surrogate [[histopathology]] or [[immunohistochemistry]] analysis of diseased tissues and cells within GWAS.&lt;ref name="Shen_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garcia-Closas_2013"/&gt;

As an alternative approach, potential risk variants identified by GWAS can be examined in combination with molecular pathology analysis on diseased tissues.&lt;ref name="Gruber_2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Slattery_2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garcia-Albeniz_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nan_2013"/&gt; This GWAS-MPE approach can give not only more precise effect estimates, even larger effects, for specific molecular subtypes of the disease, but also insights into pathogenesis by linking genetic variants to molecular pathologic signatures of disease.&lt;ref name="Ogino_2011" /&gt; Since [[molecular diagnostics]] is becoming routine clinical practice, molecular pathology data can aid epidemiologic research.

== History ==
MPE started as analysis of risk factors (such as smoking) and molecular pathologic findings (such as ''[[KRAS]]'' [[oncogene]] mutation in lung cancer).

Studies to examine the relationship between an exposure and molecular pathologic signature of disease (particularly, cancer) became increasingly common throughout the 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;ref name="Slattery_2002"/&gt;

The use of molecular pathology in epidemiology posed lacked standardized methodologies and guidelines as well as interdisciplinary experts and training programs.&lt;ref name="Sherman_2010"/&gt; MPE research required a new [[conceptual framework]] and methodologies ([[epidemiological method]]) because MPE examines heterogeneity in an [[outcome (probability)|outcome]] variable.&lt;ref name="Ogino_2012b"/&gt;

The term "molecular pathological epidemiology" was used by [[Shuji Ogino]] and Meir Stampfer in 2010.&lt;ref name="Ogino_2010"/&gt; Specific principles of MPE developed following 2010. The MPE [[paradigm]] is in widespread use globally,&lt;ref name="Curtin_2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Galon_2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ku_2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Koshiol_2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fini_2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dogan_2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spitz_2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shanmuganathan_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Esterhuyse_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hagland_2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bishehsari_2014"/&gt; and has been a subject in international conferences.&lt;ref name="Kuller_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Epplein_2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ogino_2015"/&gt;  The International Molecular Pathological Epidemiology (MPE) Meeting Series has been open to research community around the world, its second and third meetings were held in Boston, in December 2014 and May 2016,&lt;ref name="Ogino_MPE_lab"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell_2017"/&gt; respectively.

'''Native Scientist''' is a non-profit organisation created to tackle educational disadvantage through science outreach. It develops and implements outreach and educational programmes that connect migrant pupils and scientists with the aim to promote science and language literacy through [[Content_and_language_integrated_learning|language integrated learning]]. Its aims include inspiring migrant kids across Europe to consider careers in [[Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics|STEM]] and training scientists to communicate their work to non-scientists. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nativescientist.com/about Native Scientist Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017/2018, Native Scientist reached over 1000 pupils in seven different countries and engaged hundreds of scientists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/6c3fe4_a800ed03162748b89c5754d77b2dec4e.pdf Annual Report 17/18]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Projects==

'''Native Schools''': this project brings international scientists to schools, to meet pupils and speak in their native language about science. This project operates in several European countries (England, Scotland, France, Norway, Germany, Sweden, Ireland and the Netherlands) covering 10 different languages (Portuguese, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Polish, Estonian, Greek, Turkish and Arabic).

'''Native Explores''': this project brings pupils to labs or museums. The first events happened at Lancaster University &lt;ref&gt;[https://wp.lancs.ac.uk/native-scientist-lancaster/schedule/ Native Explorers at Lancaster University]&lt;/ref&gt;, King's College London &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kcl.ac.uk/lsm/newsevents/newsrecords/2018/june/language-of-science-crosses-borders.aspx King's College London's News]&lt;/ref&gt; and Dynamic Earth, in Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nativescientist.com/single-post/2018/06/03/Native-Scientist-explores-the-Origin-of-the-Universe-at-Dynamic-Earth Blog: Native Scientist explores the Origin of the Universe at Dynamic Earth]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Native Books''': launched in December 2016, it aims at creating educational resources authored by scientists, which can be used by teachers and parents to promote science and language learning. The first edition is in Portuguese &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nativescientist.com/native-books Uma volta ao mundo com cientistas portugueses]&lt;/ref&gt; and the second one in German. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nativescientist.com/scientistsarehumantoo Wissenschaftler sind auch nur Menschen]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nоva''''' (1968) is a [[science fiction]] novel by American writer [[Samuel R. Delany]]. Nominally [[space opera]], it explores the politics and culture of a future where [[cyborg]] technology is universal (the novel is one of the precursors to [[cyberpunk]]), yet making major decisions can involve using [[tarot]] cards. It has strong mythological overtones, relating to both the [[Holy Grail|Grail Quest]] and Jason's ''[[Argonautica]]'' for the golden fleece. ''Nova'' was nominated for the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] in 1969.&lt;ref name="WWE-1969"&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate=2009-08-24
}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Pringle]] lists it as one of the [[Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels|100 best science-fiction novels]] written since World War II.

After Delany completed ''Nova'' at the age of 25, his published output stopped for several years, although his writing continued. Delany completed the first draft of ''[[Equinox (novel)|Tides of Lust]]'' (author's title, ''Equinox'') in September 1968 (it appeared in 1973). He first completed ''[[Hogg (novel)|Hogg]]'' in June 1969 (though the novel itself would not appear until 1995). With the publication of his next major novel, ''[[Dhalgren]]'' (1975), however, his style had moved on in experimental directions notably different from that of his earlier work.

==Synopsis==
By the year 3172, political power in the galaxy is split between two factions: the older Earth-based Draco and the historically younger Pleiades Federation. Both have interests in the even newer Outer Colonies, where mines produce trace amounts of the prized power source Illyrion, the [[Super-heavy atom|superheavy]] material essential to starship travel and [[terraforming]] planets.

Caught in a feud between aristocratic and economically powerful families, a scarred and obsessed captain from the Pleiades, Lorq Von Ray, recruits a disparate crew of misfits to aid him in the race with his arch-enemy, Prince Red from Draco's Red Shift Ltd., to gain economic leadership by securing a vastly greater amount of Illyrion directly from the heart of a stellar [[nova]]. In doing so, Von Ray will shift the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] of the existing galactic order, which will bring about the downfall of the Red family as well as end [[Earth]]'s dominance over interstellar politics.

As the title indicates, the central [[metaphor]] for the novel is a nova: the destructive implosion/explosion of an entire sun, which, paradoxically, while it destroys most of a solar system, also creates new elements. In the book, at the eruption of a nova, not only do the laws of [[physics]] break down, but so do the laws of politics and [[psychology]]. This idea permeates the entire plot and storyline.

The characters follow a [[quest]] plot line, in which they visit several worlds to gain information necessary to achieve their goal, all the while pursued by the Red family.

Although the novel does not indulge the literary experimentation found in Delany's later books, it maintains a high level of innovation. Some chapters end or begin in mid-sentence. Also, the [[point of view (literature)|point of view]] regularly shifts between Lorq, Katin, and the Mouse. Each page in the book carries a header that gives the year and location of the scene on the page itself (e.g., "Draco, Earth, Paris, 3162"). This is useful because of the flashbacks in the long journey around the galaxy.

==Reception==
[[Algis Budrys]], describing Delany as "the best science-fiction writer in the world," praised ''Nova'' as "highly entertaining to read" and commended Delany's integration of his sociopolitical  extrapolation into his story, his accomplished characterization, and his "virtuosity" in presenting the novel's "classically posed scientific puzzle."&lt;ref&gt;"Galaxy Bookshelf", [[Galaxy Science Fiction]], January 1969, p.189-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Lorq Von Ray'''. Lorq is the scion of the wealthy Von Ray family, the most powerful clan in the Pleiades Federation. Originally a carefree playboy, Lorq is drawn into his family's feud with the Reds and, as a result, becomes obsessed with finding Illyrion. When Prince Red attacks him at a fabulously opulent party in Paris, he scars Lorq's face badly; but Lorq refuses to remove the scarring and as a result carries an air of menace.&lt;br&gt;As the book unfolds, Lorq learns that his family was founded by [[pirates]], who killed members of the Red family in previous generations in order to keep the Pleiades free of Earth-based [[corporations]], although Lorq's ancestors did so with the support of the Pleiades' citizens. The Reds, however, still carry a grudge.&lt;br&gt;Although Lorq Von Ray is described as looking between forty-five and fifty years old, according to the dates in the book he is barely thirty. This may have been a mathematical mistake on Delany's part: in the book's first edition there are several such errors, such as the numbering of the centuries: the year 1850 is in the middle of the nineteenth century, not the eighteenth. The year 2375 is in the middle of the twenty-fourth century, not the twenty-third. But these mistakes have been corrected in more recent editions. A possible explanation for Lorq's age is the Mouse's speculation that Lorq is "aged, not old"; the disparity in Lorq's age and appearance is so wide, however, the Mouse's theory is sometimes hard to hold onto.
* '''The Mouse'''. This is the nickname for Pontichos Provechi, a young [[Romani people|Gypsy]] from Earth, who, by age 18, has led an extremely varied life, and is just beginning to work in a starship navigation crew. He also entertains people by creating illusions and music with his "sensory [[syrinx|syrynx]]" (a sound, scent, and [[hologram]] projector).
* '''Katin Crawford'''. Katin is an intellectual from Earth's [[moon]], who received a [[liberal arts]] education at [[Harvard University]] and who has worked till now at a series of unfulfilling [[clerk|clerical]] positions. Katin is a loner. His passion is to explore various moons across the [[Solar System]]. He also aspires to write a novel, for which he constantly records notes, although the form is obsolete by the time ''Nova'' takes place. The word "novel" is, incidentally, etymologically related to the word "nova." Both come from the Latin ''novum'', which means "something new." Sometimes Katin annoys his colleagues by going off on long lectures on any number of topics; in this capacity, he is sometimes comic, even while acting as the novel's expository voice.
* '''Sebastian and Tyÿ'''. This wandering, working couple consists of Sebastian, a powerful-looking man who is nonetheless gentle—he keeps a number of unusual pets with him, his "flapping black gillies"—and his companion, Tyÿ, a quiet mysterious woman and tarot-card reader. Like many of Delany's characters, Sebastian is racially mixed: Although he has [[Asian people|Asian]] features, his hair is naturally blond. Both are from the Pleiades and consider it an honor to work for the Von Ray family.
* '''Lynceos and Idas'''. These twin brothers are of African descent, but one is an albino. Eventually we learn they are two members of a set of triplets. Having been born and grown up in the Outer Colonies, all three brothers had a tendency to use drugs and make mischief. As a result of one of their pranks, they ended in a type of [[indentured servitude]] and were forced to work in the colonies' Illyrion mines. (Such arrangements are common at that time to "recruit" workers for the mines.) The two talk in tandem. Jokingly Katin calls them a pair of "glorified salt and pepper shakers." Their names come from the twins who were among Jason's crew in his ancient quest for the fleece. Lynceos means lynx-like, i.e., sharp-eyed. Idas suggests someone from the pleasant fields of Mt. Ida.
* '''Prince Red'''. The scion of the Earth-based Red family, Prince was born with only one arm. In place of the other, he wears an artificial limb, which has unnatural strength. Its grip can compress sand into [[quartz]] crystals, which he can throw with the force of bullets. A troublemaker from birth (in his youth, he was forced constantly to shift schools because of discipline problems), he detests Lorq for numerous reasons, some of which he is not consciously aware of.&lt;br&gt;Because of the power his artificial arm gives him, Prince can become extremely violent if anyone so much as mentions his deformity. As a little boy he sprains Lorq's mother's wrist when, innocently, she asks for his hand to take him home when he has gotten into mischief after dark with the other children.
* '''Ruby Red'''. Prince's younger sister, Ruby, is a quiet-spoken woman, who appears to be completely under Prince's control. As an adolescent, Lorq falls in love with her, but she rebuffs him because of their families' hostile histories.&lt;br&gt;Prince appears to have an unhealthy attachment to his sister—which, often, she seems to reciprocate. While their father, Aaron, is still alive at the time of the novel and in charge of the Red's vast industrial holdings, Prince and Ruby are the most visible members of the Red clan.
* '''Dan'''. An Australian drifter whom Lorq first meets while the man is hitchhiking, Dan is the first to suggest to Lorq how a nova might be a source for Illyrion. Unfortunately, by the beginning of the novel, an accident on the first mission has damaged his senses and probably his sanity. He kills himself soon into the book, and most of his appearances take place in flashbacks.

The book's third chapter (of seven) is basically a long [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]] that shows Lorq and Prince's childhoods and the political background against which the story takes place. Lorq first meets Prince and Ruby when they are all youngsters, during an attempt by their parents to end the feud between the families. The meeting ends, however, in disaster and embarrassment, and the fundamentally cruel natures of both Prince and his father Aaron—as well as the senior Von Ray's innate love of violence—become clear.

==Motifs==
'''''Nova''''' has a number of character motifs in common with Delany's later literary and literary-pornographic works: the Mouse, a damaged artist who wears one shoe as does the Kid in the later ''[[Dhalgren]]''; Katin, an intellectual and writer who attempts to record the events around him; the twins Lynceos and Idas, one black, the other albino; and Dan, a barefoot derelict, with a rope holding up his pants.

The novel, storyline, and themes of ''Nova'' are multilayered and complex, and lend themselves to numerous interpretations. As the critic Judith Merrill wrote at the book's publication:

::''Here are (at least some of) the ways you can read ''Nova'': As fast-action far-flung interstellar adventure; as archetypal mystical/mythical allegory (in which the Tarot and the Grail both figure prominently); as modern myth told in the SF idiom . . . The reader observes, recollects, or participates in a range of personal human experience including violent pain and disfigurement, sensory deprivation and overload, man-machine communion, the drug experience, the creative experience – and interpersonal relationships which include incest and assassination, father-son, leader-follower, human-pet, and ''lots'' more.’’&lt;ref&gt;Judith Merril, "Books", F&amp;SF, November 1968, p. 43-46.&lt;/ref&gt;([[Judith Merril]], 1968).

===Space opera===
''Nova'' takes place in a standard [[space opera]] setting with many of the features and tropes peculiar to the genre. Conscientiously the novel emulates many earlier and popular science fiction works.

Delany makes an offhand reference to [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[The Foundation Series|Foundation]] trilogy (a random planet is named "[[Trantor]]"). Additionally, in one scene, a character has a false [[tooth]] with [[poison]] hidden in it, a classical trope from many espionage stories, which [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' had employed three years before. (Unlike in ''Dune'', in ''Nova'' it doesn't work.)

There is also a strong similarity in names between the scientist, Ashton Clark, who, in ''Nova'', has invented the cyborg plugs and sockets centuries before, which pervade the novel, and the name of the fantasy and science fiction writer from the 'thirties and 'forties, [[Clark Ashton Smith]].

Prince’s ability to squeeze sand into glass and quartz fragments strongly parallels the power of many action heroes (most notably [[Superman]]), and the idea of aristocratic families feuding in space is found in numerous other space opera novels. The character of Katin is partially written to resemble the classic "bore" in science fiction literature—a character who constantly gives lectures and explanations to describe the universe of the book.  In ''Nova'', however, Katin is constantly ridiculed for filling this role and on occasion is used for comic relief.

In keeping with this sort of game-playing, in a scene that takes place in a vast museum, the Alkane, in the city of Phoenix on the planet Vorpis, at one point Lorq and Katin hurry through the "FitzGerald Salon," clearly based on the actual "Rubens Salon" in the Louvre Museum in Paris—after the "Mona Lisa" and the "Raft of the Medusa," probably the Louvre's most impressive holdings.

The artist [[Russell FitzGerald]] was a good friend of Delany's and did a number of book and magazine covers for him (including the cover for the first edition of ''Nova'' and the cover for the ''Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction'' edition of "We, in Some Strange Power's Employ, Move on a Rigorous Line" [1968]) and the three covers for the English paperback edition of the three volumes of Delany's Fall of the Towers trilogy. He is thanked at the beginning of ''Nova'', along with their mutual friend, the poet Helen Adam, for helping with "Grail and Tarot lore." FitzGerald had a basement studio on East 2nd Street in New York City's East Village, modeled after a similar studio used by the Victorian artist and illustrator Aubrey Beardsley and known to FitzGerald's friends as "the Black Studio." There FitzGerald worked on a series of large canvases similar in size to the ones by Rubens that line the walls of the Rubens Salon. Delany often visited the Black Studio and even worked there on ''Nova'' in his notebook, while FitzGerald worked on his great hyperreal paintings, the two of them drinking white wine together.

The museum lamp in ''Nova'' that allows paintings to be viewed under the same order of light in which they were created grew out of their studio conversations. Eventually FitzGerald did an entire tarot deck, which his friends referred to as "the ''Nova'' tarot." FitzGerald and "the Black Studio" are the model for the character "Proctor" and ''his'' studio—and the art objects contained in it—in Delany's novel ''Equinox'' (1973). For many years Delany hoped that a FitzGerald painting called ''Götterdämarung'', which he'd painted over the same months as Delany wrote ''Nova'', would eventually make a color cover for the novel. Alas, it never happened. Those interested in FitzGerald's colorful bisexual life can learn more about him in the biography of the San Francisco poet Jack Spicer, ''Poet Be Like God'' (Weslyan University Press; Hanover: 1998), by Lewis Ellingham and Kevin Killian. By the time FitzGerald and his wife and family left New York for Vancouver, B.C., the building housing the Black Studio had been taken over by the New York chapter of the Hells Angels (with whom FitzGerald was on good terms), who stayed on there for many years afterward.

===The tarot and the grail===
Within the future society, reading the Tarot is considered both scientific and accurate. The Mouse is actually ridiculed as old-fashioned and uneducated for his skepticism about such things.

Much of the story revolves around a tarot reading Tyÿ gives Lorq at the beginning of the second mission, in which she rather successfully predicts the stakes and outcome. For example, ''The Tower'' appears, indicating that a powerful family (presumably the Reds or Von Rays) will fall, and the large number of pentacles indicates wealth. Prince and Ruby are represented by the ''King of Swords'' and the ''Queen of Swords'', respectively. An anomaly in the reading, however, occurs when Tyÿ drops ''The Sun''—which Lorq considered to represent a nova—and the Mouse pockets it, thus making it impossible for Tyÿ's reading to include this card.

Smaller Tarot readings dot the rest of the novel. As a young child, Lorq receives a reading indicating a death in his family: within a month, his Uncle Morgan is assassinated. Likewise, Lorq's Aunt Cyana (Morgan's [[widow]]) has Lorq choose a single Tarot card for insight: it is ''The Hanged Man'', reversed, indicating that Lorq will succeed in his quest, but at a very high price.

Delany makes it clear that the Tarot should not be used for outright prediction. As Katin tells the highly skeptical Mouse: "[T]he cards don't actually predict anything. They simply propagate an educated commentary on present situations[.]" (''Nova'', 112). "[Tarot cards] only become superstitious when they are abused, employed to direct rather than guide and suggest." (''Nova'', 113) But, as the plot develops, sometimes it's difficult to distinguish clearly between useful "guiding" and abusive (superstitious) "directing."

The story of scarred Captain Von Ray's obsessive quest for a nova with his crew of outcasts recalls [[Herman Melville|Melville]]'s tale of wounded Captain Ahab's search for the white whale in ''[[Moby-Dick]]''. (In a 1971 article about the current state of Science Fiction, ''[[Time Magazine]]'' writer R. Z. Shepherd wrote, "[''Nova''] suggests ''Moby-Dick'' at a strobe-light show.") In ''Nova'', the events are interpreted by Katin as a quest for the [[Holy Grail]], with Illyrion playing the part of the Grail itself. As in the Grail story, there is a failed attempt to gain it, and someone must make a major self-sacrifice (in ''Nova'', his sanity and senses) in order to succeed.

Katin is constantly trying to find a plot for his novel, and finally decides to use Lorq's adventures with Prince and Ruby—immediately noticing the correspondences with the Grail archetype. By the end of the novel, it becomes clear that ''Nova'' is the book Katin will eventually write.

===Creativity, art, change, and stagnation===
Although the novel takes place in the 32nd century, the society within it is described as highly stagnant, even taking into account the spread of interstellar travel and cyborging. Often, however, the book suggests that those minor characters who repeatedly make this judgment are simply looking for symptoms of change and vitality in the wrong parts of society—a theme ''Nova'' shares with [[Alfred Bester]]'s ''The Stars My Destination''.

Cyana Von Ray Morgan, who is Lorq’s aunt and a [[curator]] at humanity’s largest museum, remarks that one-fourth of the displays at her museum are devoted to the Twentieth century, much the way major museums in Europe and the United States for the last hundred or so years might seem—to some—to have devoted a disproportionate amount of their space to Greek and Roman artifacts. She justifies this by saying that, despite all the progress made by mankind, the Twentieth Century encompasses the greatest change in humanity's fundamental situation: "At the beginning of that amazing century, mankind was many societies living on one world; at its end, it was basically what we are now: an informatively unified society that lived on several worlds." (''Nova'', 156)

In short, within the fictional future of ''Nova'', humanity began to colonize space by the end of the Twentieth Century. A few centuries later, and cyborg implants were invented. The combination of increasingly cheaper Illyrion (the fuel of starships) and universally-adaptable implants has created, by the time of the novel, a highly-mobile and transient [[work force]] and population.

This mobile population has a drawback, however. In a pseudo-intellectual argument raised throughout the novel, characters make reference to a "lack of cultural solidarity" (a concept that vaguely resembles the idea of [[cultural capital]]). Because the population is constantly on the move, there is no shared culture, nor have there been any successful attempts to create new broad-based artistic and cultural movements since the end of the Twentieth Century.

Characters make frequent references to 20th century culture: at Prince’s party in Paris (which takes place in the year 3162), a group of entertainers start performing a song by [[The Mamas &amp; the Papas]]. Katin makes an offhand remark that indicates the [[board game]] [[Monopoly (board game)|Monopoly]] (which was invented during the early 20th century) is still in existence, and has even been adapted to the future society. When he needs to name a "Renaissance Man," Katin mentions [[Bertrand Russell]], despite the passage of more than a millennium since Russell died.

In Cyana Morgan's museum, in addition to the predominance of Twentieth Century-based exhibits, within a hall of paintings, Katin notices that many of the works share the same subjects—and, in many cases, the same names—even though the tags clearly indicate the paintings were created centuries apart, and on different planets. The most famous art collection in the museum is actually a forgery of an existing set of works, and the forgeries are considered more popular and valuable than the originals.

A main interest of the book—unusual for a science fiction novel—is the two approaches to art characterized by the Mouse and Katin. In playing on his sensory syrynx, the Mouse is spontaneous, improvisatory, highly personal and immediately emotional. While he uses whatever material is around him as the basis for his art, the Mouse's creations on his syrynx are, however beautiful, ephemeral and disposable. In [[Nietzsche]]'s terms, he is a [[Dionysian]] artist. Katin on the other hand is (again in Nietzsche's terms) an [[Apollonian]] artist. He is deeply intellectual, highly theoretical, largely impersonal, and concerned with the richness and complexity of the statement his artwork will make in terms of history. The irony of his approach is that, for all the hundreds of thousands of words he has dictated into his recorder about his theory of what the novel should be and do, he is still looking for a subject—a story—that is important enough in historical terms to stand up under all his theorizing.

When the Mouse's approach gets out of control, as the novel dramatizes in one climactic sequence, the instruments of art become murderous weapons. When Katin's approach gets out of hand, the result is paralysis and silence.

The conclusion the Mouse arrives at to Katin's problem—and for the reader appreciating the book on this level, it should be no surprise—is that Lorq's quest itself, which will revise the power structure of the entire galaxy, ''is'' the historically proper subject for Katin's novel, at the same time that Katin realizes he must learn how to employ some of the Mouse's immediacy, spontaneity, and energy. It does not hurt that, by the end of ''Nova'', Lorq's quest has achieved the shape of a [[classical tragedy]]: Lorq has had to sacrifice his senses in the same way that Dan—at the start of the book—has already lost his; and in the way that the Mouse has been so afraid might happen to him. In many ways the novel is about perception itself—its value, its pleasures, the information it allows us to access, the sense it allows us to make of the rich and colorful social universe.

The novel refers repeatedly to a historic "Vega Republic," presumably among the worlds circling the star [[Vega]], which flourished several centuries prior to the novel’s beginning. At one point, apparently, the Republic staged an uprising and attempted to declare both political and cultural autonomy from Earth. During those years the Vegans created a new and different style in furniture, fabrics, and architecture. Many of their artists, musicians, and writers produced highly distinctive work that, in later years, caught the imagination of intellectuals in both Draco and the Pleiades. Before ''Nova'' begins, however, the Vega Republic uprising was violently suppressed, and Katin claims that the ability to identify remnants of Vegan culture has become nothing but an intellectual "parlor game."

As the quest continues, soon Lorq drops the rationalizations for the Red/Von Ray vendetta, except for the fact that his actions, for better or worse, will produce a major cultural shift in humanity, even though nobody can tell what that change will be, or if it will be a positive or negative one.

===Race===
The story's main character, Lorq, is Afropean. His father is of [[Norway|Norwegian]] descent, and his Earth-born mother is [[Senegalese]].

The residents of the Pleiades Federation (and the Outer Colonies) overall are an extremely mixed [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] population. In addition to appearances, characters from the Pleiades sometimes have names that indicate a mixed racial heritage. For example, one of Lorq's childhood friends is named “Yorgos Satsumi,” which contains a clearly Japanese last name, but a first name that is decidedly [[Greece|Greek]].

This is in sharp contrast to the Earth-centered Draco society, where the leaders tend to be uniformly [[White people|Caucasian]]. Individuals from Earth also tend to have extremely "[[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]]ish" names. For example, a character named "Brian" is eventually revealed (at least, in the 2002 edition) to have the full name "Brian Anthony Sanders." Moreover, according to the Mouse, Earth still has problems with racism: he recalls seeing Gypsies [[lynched]] when he was younger.

Ironically, although this racial diversity is considered one of the novel's most innovative features, at the time of its first publication (1968), the inclusion of minority characters proved to be a liability due to the racism ingrained in American culture at the time (see ''Publishing Status'' below).

===Man and machine, society and alienation===
The society of ''Nova'' is in a pre-[[revolutionary]] state. Economic tensions have created a feud between the "new money" Von Ray family and the "old money" Red family, both of whom have a large stake in intergalactic transportation. Shortly before the novel's events (within the lifetime of Lorq's father), the Pleiades region achieved political autonomy from Earth/Draco, and is now an independent federation. At the time of the novel, citizens of the Outer Colonies are beginning to support the idea of independence as well.

In a passage in Chapter Three, the elder Von Ray interprets the tensions in terms of social class, with each major galactic region representing one of the three traditional social classes:
* The Draco Empire, centered on Earth, was the earliest area to be colonized. As such, this colonization was largely controlled and subsidized by large governments and corporations from Earth (most notably, Red Shift Ltd.). Because of this, Draco is largely controlled by the upper class, which retains strong cultural and economic ties to Earth.
* The Pleiades Federation was founded, according to Lorq's father, by a "comparatively middle class" movement, primarily individuals and small businesses that wished to cut ties from Earth and maintain their independence. The main reason for this was that, although the region ''as a whole'' was far from Draco, its many habitable planets are located relatively close to each other, resulting in much cheaper transportation costs. The citizens were so dedicated to keeping out Earth influence that they hired Lorq's great-great grandfather (the founder of the Von Ray clan) to kill any representative of Earth-based megacorporations who tried to stake a claim. As a result, the Pleiades remained distant from Draco, and eventually declared independence without much Earth-based interference.
* The Outer Colonies were colonized solely because of the prospects of Illyrion mining, as the worlds within the region are not particularly hospitable to human habitation. Because of this, large companies subsidized the migration of mine workers to the region, often using trickery, dubious legal measures, and false promises. As a result, the Outer Colonies are almost entirely populated by men and women from the working class and [[Underclass|lower classes]], who had few other prospects.

One thing all characters have in common is their cyborging. Individuals who cannot or will not accept these implants are effectively removed from society. The Mouse, for instance, mentions that his people (the Gypsies) refused the implants and, as a result, were treated with intolerance and even killed on Earth.

Prince’s anger over his artificial arm, while irrational on the surface, is eventually hypothesized to have been caused by its effect on his ability to cyborg. Generally, a person has a total of five implants, two of which are located in the wrists. Since Prince was born with only one arm, he cannot fully connect himself with a machine.

Although the society seems on the edge of a revolution (or some other unspecified major change), the future of the novel is optimistic. As Katin reveals in one of his expository monologues, the problem of [[Marx's theory of alienation|labor alienation]] has been overcome through the use of technology: practically all humans have cyborg socket implants that allow them to interface directly with the machines they use. These sockets are highly adaptable. Characters plug them into everything from small vacuum cleaners to the navigational systems of starships. By directly interfacing with the machines, workers are able to identify with their work, and the result is greater psychological wellbeing and less labor alienation.

===Sex and incest===
''Nova'' was written prior to Delany's turn to sexuality as a major focus of his work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel R. Delany#Themes]]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the novel suggests several sexual subtexts. In the same way that a homoerotic current informs the relationship [[Herman Melville|Melville]] describes between Captain Ahab and the cabin boy Pip in ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', a similar undercurrent vibrates through the scenes between Captain Von Ray and the Mouse.

Throughout the novel, the intelligent and beautiful Ruby remains both loyal and subservient to her brother, Prince, even to the extent of going against her own feelings. Their relationship strongly suggests an [[incestuous]] nature. Prince refuses to allow her to interact with Lorq. In turn, Ruby maintains a close emotional attachment to Prince, one that, in a suggestive scene near the novel’s end, proves disastrous.

===Assassination, pain, and violence===
In ''Nova'', a culturally iconic political [[assassination]] has taken place. The advanced technology at the time allowed millions of people throughout the universe to experience the sensations and emotions of the victim (Secretary Morgan, the leader of the Pleiades Federation) as he died—and, directly afterwards, the emotions of his [[widow]] (and Lorq Von Ray’s aunt), Cyana Von Ray Morgan. The murder was brutal: Morgan was publicly [[garrote]]d at his second [[inauguration]], and almost [[decapitated]]. Although the assassination was eventually revealed to be the work of a single man, ("Underwood"), for a period of time afterwards, many popular [[conspiracy theories]] were developed. To deal with her [[grief]]—and that of Pleiades citizens—Cyana Morgan adopted an extremely [[Stoicism|stoic]] posture and slowly retreated from the public eye.

This death is clearly a dramatic rewriting of the November 1963 "televised" assassination of President [[John F. Kennedy]] in Dallas, Texas, which had taken place only five years before ''Nova'' was published. Cyana Von Ray Morgan, the widow, strongly resembles Kennedy's wife [[Jackie Kennedy|Jacqueline Bauvier Kennedy]] in her responses, her appearance, and her interest in art.

Lorq, Prince, and Ruby—all heirs of wealthy clans who grew up in luxury—live what Lorq refers to as "meaningless" lives, indulging in sex, expensive hobbies (e.g. space-yacht racing), and partying. Lorq's transformation begins when, in a physical fight, Prince scars Lorq's face deeply with his artificial hand. Later in the novel, both Lorq and the Mouse attack Prince and Ruby, causing them great pain. As the novel nears completion, Ruby remarks that, prior to that event, neither she nor her brother had a true concept of what pain was really like; neither of them truly fathomed the importance of their actions and the feud until they were personally hit by it.

Practically all the socially powerful characters have violent natures, which often they try to hide or repress. Despite the elder Von Rays' attempts to end the feud, make peace with Aaron Red, and have their children become friends, the Von Rays cannot escape the fact that the family wealth and status were based on piracy and murder. Although outwardly Aaron Red appears harmless (he is described as bald, portly, and easily embarrassed) and he seems to be friends with members of the Von Ray family, events can bring out his natural violence and reveal him as an abusively indulgent father.

The novel hints at these buried emotions, when, for example, the Von Ray and Red families meet in the Outer Colonies at a reconciliatory reception. Seven-year-old Prince uses his artificial arm and its strength to kill Lorq's mother's pet bird in front of Lorq and Ruby. Later that night, the adults leave to watch the future equivalent of a [[cock fight]], but with winged reptiles rather than roosters. The novel's violence gathers force in an unexpected eruption from Prince against Lorq at his party in Paris; much of the novel tries to explain the origins of this rage.

Both rage and pain are eventually recognized by the mature characters to have been a necessary component of their lives. Lorq realizes that, without Prince's attack to 'wake him up,' he would have gone on with a carefree life; he maintains his scar as a reminder of this. The successful completion of Lorq's quest has an extremely painful outcome for Lorq personally. As well, now that the need for Illyrion mines is gone, we know, the Outer Colonies will collapse socially and economically. The Red heirs fought for the status quo; only near the end of the novel do they experience the pain that goes along with the realization of what Lorq is trying to do.

==''Nova'''s influence==
''Nova'' is considered one of the major forerunners of the [[cyberpunk]] movement. It prefigures, for instance, cyberpunk's staple [[Trope (literature)|trope]] of human interfacing with computers via implants.

While the [[New Wave (science fiction)|New Wave]] of science fiction was concentrating on near-future science fiction stories and the highly subjective exploration of "inner space," in 1968, the year it was published, ''Nova'' seemed a deliberate throw-back to traditional space opera—and space opera at its grandest and most operatic.

While reviews in the American professional science fiction magazines, ''The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction'' and ''Galaxy'', by Judith Merril and [[A. J. Budrys]], respectively, were highly praiseful, the review in the New Wave outlet, England's ''New Worlds'', by [[M. John Harrison]], while acknowledging the skill and energy with which it had been written, called the book a "waste of time and talent."

The novel has always been popular with readers, many of whom have found it, for all its social subtleties, a roller-coaster of a read; but it took a decade-and-a-half for cyberpunk writers and readers to begin praising its handling of drugs, tarot cards, and its off-hand presentation of racial variety, its narrative energy and sense of historical sweep, and finally its exploration of the relationship between politics and art—indeed, for the cyberpunk writers it soon became an iconic text. Characters like the Mouse, Lynceos, Idas, Tyÿ, Sebastian, and even Katin can be seen as [[hippies]], with itinerant lifestyles and [[recreational drug use|drugs]]. As well, the design and effect of the Mouse's sensory syrynx has an overall feel of an expanded 1960s [[Laser lighting display|light show]], of the sort that had then begun to accompany traditional rock concerts.

Writer [[William Gibson]] claimed to be greatly influenced by Delany, and his novel ''[[Neuromancer]]'' includes allusions to ''Nova.'' While Delany's vision of the future is optimistic, however, the cyberpunk movement has a distinctly [[dystopic]] outlook. Gibson's novel includes a character, Peter Riviera, introduced (like the Mouse) in [[Istanbul]], with the same holographic projection powers (although via implants) as the Mouse in ''Nova''; but Gibson's character is a [[psychopath]]. Likewise, Gibson includes a character who awkwardly wears only one shoe; this character (Ashpool) is an insane killer.

==Publishing status==
{{Original research inline|date=January 2010}}
[[Image:Nova-Delany.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cover of 2002 paperback edition.]]
Despite its status, reputation, and influence on science-fiction as a genre, for a dozen years after 1990 (the date of [[Bantam Books]]' final 14th printing), ''Nova'' was [[Out-of-print book|out of print]]. Hardcover copies were highly prized. Not until 2002 did Vintage Books rerelease it.

Over the years before ''Nova'' appeared, Delany had already won the Nebula Award twice for best science fiction novel of the year: ''[[Babel-17]]'' had gained the award in 1967 (in a tie for best novel of 1966 with [[Daniel Keyes]]'s ''[[Flowers for Algernon]]'', a.k.a. ''Charly''). ''The Einstein Intersection'' won him the award the following year in 1968 (for best novel of 1967).

While awaiting publication by Doubleday, ''Nova'' was submitted to ''[[Analog (magazine)|Analog]]'' editor [[John W. Campbell]] for potential serialization. Campbell rejected the novel, saying in a telephone conversation with Delany's agent that, though he'd enjoyed the book, he did not feel his magazine's readership "would be able to relate to a black main character."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyrsf.com/racism-and-science-fiction-.html "Racism and Science Fiction"], Samuel R. Delany, [[The New York Review of Science Fiction]], August 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
Because there was no magazine serialization, however, in its first six months the novel did not get the initially wide exposure to readers that might have helped gain it a Hugo Award—though it was nominated and soon regularly referred to as "the perfect science fiction novel". In the pages of ''[[Galaxy Magazine]]'' (''Analog'''s rival), the August after it appeared, resident critic [[Algis Budrys]] would write, "Samuel R. Delany, right now, as of this book, ''Nova'', not as of some future book or some accumulated body of work, is the best science-fiction writer in the world, at a time when competition for that status is intense. I don't see how a writer can do more than wring your heart while explaining how it works. No writer can"—heady praise for the work of a young man completed before his twenty-sixth birthday.

The Vintage edition of the novel corrects some minor mistakes in the original version. It also adds an entire passage that does not appear in any of the older published versions.

In the Vintage edition, Delany includes a passage in which Prince Red brags about how he is responsible for the death of Brian, a character who disappears, in earlier editions, after a single chapter. In the Vintage edition, toward the end of the book Prince describes how, using his wealth and power, and with no more provocation than a careless comment Brian once made about Prince's arm, Prince systematically destroyed Brian's life, until Brian became [[homeless]] and died of exposure. Prince claims that he has killed some two dozen others in a similar manner for similar reasons.

This passage significantly alters Prince's [[characterization]]. In earlier editions, the worst that could be said of Prince is that he had been "spoiled" and had a violent temper. The new material  turns him into a remorseless [[murderer]] and adds a [[moral]] component to Lorq's quest absent in the earlier versions. If Prince defeats Lorq, the most powerful man in the galaxy will be a psychopathic killer.

The above passage is in the original typescript of ''Nova'', however. It is also in Delany's handwritten version of the novel in his notebooks from 1967. Both are in the Delany Holdings on store in the Howard Gottlieb Archives at the [[Mugar Memorial Library]] of [[Boston University]]. Initially the writer omitted it before publication of the first edition, when a friend who had read the manuscript found that section too extreme. In later years Delany decided to return it to the novel, because he felt readers needed to know what happened to Brian, after he seems to vanish from the book.

Additionally, in the first edition of ''Nova'' it is unclear whether or not Lorq's parents are still alive by the time the novel ends: When Lorq begins his quest, his mother is already dying of a degenerative disorder, but at the end he makes no mention of them, nor does he try to contact them. However, in another (much briefer) passage added in the Vintage Books edition, related to the above, Lorq has a memory that implies both of his parents and Aaron Red (as did Dan and Brian) died during the past ten years. This is in neither the original typescript nor in the notebook version, and is a true addition.

The '''Professional Monitor Company Limited''', better known as '''PMC''', is a [[Great Britain|British]]  [[loudspeaker]] manufacturer, established in 1991. The company's products are widely used within domestic settings, professional [[Recording studio|studios]] and other [[hi-fi]] applications.

The company is one of a handful to have won an [[Emmy]] award in recognition of its "contribution to recording excellence".&lt;ref&gt;http://pmc-speakers.com/about/pmc-history&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
PMC was formed by Peter Thomas (previously of the [[BBC]]) and Adrian Loader (previously of FWO Bauch, an audio distributor) in 1990.&lt;ref name=EA&gt;{{cite web|title=Award Winner PMC|url=http://www.extreme-audio.com/en/index.php?id=yeni%20&amp;tur_id=286|publisher=Extreme Audio|accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They produced their first loudspeaker, the BB5-A, which was a large [[studio monitor]]. The first production versions were sold to the BBC and [[Metropolis Studios]]. The BBC still use the BB5 at the [[Maida Vale]] studios,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Maida Vales 2,3,4|url=http://www.pmc-speakers.com/keyclients/index.php?mode=viewKeyclient&amp;key_id=21|work=Key Clients|publisher=PMC Ltd.|accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and uses other PMC speakers in other locations as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC Wales chooses PMC speakers for monitoring Dr Who and Torchwood|url=http://www.whathifi.com/news/bbc-wales-chooses-pmc-speakers-for-monitoring-dr-who-and-torchwood|accessdate=21 May 2011|newspaper=What Hi-Fi?|date=20 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metropolis now has around fifteen{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} of them installed at its recording and [[Audio mastering|mastering]] facility in [[West (London sub region)|West London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metropolis Mastering|url=http://www.pmc-speakers.com/keyclients/index.php?mode=viewKeyclient&amp;key_id=99|work=Key Clients|publisher=PMC Ltd.|accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Notable users of the BB5 include [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prince|url=http://www.pmc-speakers.com/keyclients/index.php?mode=viewKeyclient&amp;key_id=291|work=Key Clients|publisher=PMC Ltd.|accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stevie Wonder]]'s Wonderland Studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wonderland|url=http://www.pmc-speakers.com/keyclients/index.php?mode=viewKeyclient&amp;key_id=185|work=Key Clients|publisher=PMC Ltd.|accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PMC was awarded an [[Emmy Award]] for their recording work.&lt;ref name=EA /&gt;

==Technology==
PMC uses "Advanced [[Transmission line loudspeaker|Transmission Line]]" technology in all of their loudspeakers. This is a means of loading a drive unit in a [[Speaker cabinets|cabinet]] in such a way as to absorb the unwanted [[audio frequency|frequencies]] that radiate from the rear of the [[speaker driver]]. The speaker is mounted at the end of a folded line within the cabinet, which is lined with foam of varying absorbency. The lowest frequencies are allowed to pass through the line and emerge [[in phase]] from a vent on the front or rear face of the cabinet, in effect acting as a second bass [[speaker driver|driver]]. By absorbing the unwanted bass frequencies, the upper bass and midrange are not masked by [[harmonic distortion]].

The ATL design enables the speakers to produce higher [[sound pressure]] levels and deeper bass extension than is possible with similar sized speakers using either [[Speaker cabinet#Ported (or reflex) enclosures|ported]] or [[Speaker cabinet#Sealed (or closed) enclosures|sealed]] cabinets.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} The speakers can also be played at lower volumes without any loss of [[frequency response]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Terry Knight (host), Curtis Ellzey (videographer, editor) |date=22 September 2008 |title=PMC's Advance Transmission Line Speakers |url=http://www.engineeringtv.com/video/PMCs-Advance-Transmission-Line |format= |medium= |language= |trans_title= |publisher=Engineering TV |location= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=21 May 2011 |time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
PMC manufacturers products for both hi-fi and studio use. The hi-fi products originally grew out of the studio designs. The company also makes a range of on-wall speakers called the Wafer series. These also use the folded transmission line and are voiced identically to the traditional box speakers.

==''Candida''==
[[File:Candida pap 1.jpg|thumb|right|Candida. [[Pap test]] specimen. [[Pap stain]].]]
[[Candida (genus)|''Candida'']] species cause infections in individuals with deficient immune systems. [[Th1 cell|Th1-type]] [[cell-mediated immunity]] (CMI) is required for clearance of a fungal infection.
''[[Candida albicans]]'' is a kind of diploid [[yeast]] that commonly occurs among the human [[gut flora|gut microflora]].  ''C. albicans'' is an [[opportunistic pathogen]] in humans.  Abnormal over-growth of this fungus can occur, particularly in [[immunodeficiency|immunocompromised]] individuals.&lt;ref name="pmid24789109"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Martins N, Ferreira IC, Barros L, Silva S, Henriques M |title=Candidiasis: predisposing factors, prevention, diagnosis and alternative treatment |journal=Mycopathologia |volume=177 |issue=5–6 |pages=223–40 |year=2014 |pmid=24789109 |doi=10.1007/s11046-014-9749-1 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''C. albicans'' has a [[parasexual cycle]] that appears to be stimulated by environmental stress.&lt;ref name="pmid26210747"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bennett RJ |title=The parasexual lifestyle of Candida albicans |journal=Curr. Opin. Microbiol. |volume=28 |issue= |pages=10–7 |year=2015 |pmid=26210747 |pmc=4688137 |doi=10.1016/j.mib.2015.06.017 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Aspergillus''==
[[File:Pulmonary aspergillosis.jpg|thumb|right|Aspergillosis. [[H&amp;E stain]].]]
The most common pathogenic species are ''[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]'' and ''[[Aspergillus flavus]]''. Aspergillus flavus produces [[aflatoxin]] which is both a toxin and a [[carcinogen]] and which can potentially contaminate foods such as nuts. ''Aspergillus fumigatus'' and ''[[Aspergillus clavatus]]'' can cause [[allergic]] disease. Some ''Aspergillus'' species cause disease on grain crops, especially [[maize]], and synthesize [[mycotoxin]]s including [[aflatoxin]]. [[Aspergillosis]] is the group of diseases caused by ''Aspergillus''. The symptoms include fever, cough, chest pain or breathlessness. Usually, only patients with weakened [[immune system]]s or with other [[lung]] conditions are susceptible.&lt;ref name="SanBlasCalderone"/&gt;

The spores of ''[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]'' are ubiquitous in the atmosphere.  ''A. fumigatus'' is an opportunistic pathogen.  It can cause potentially lethal invasive infection in immunocompromised individuals.&lt;ref name="pmid19043401"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Gorman CM, Fuller H, Dyer PS |title=Discovery of a sexual cycle in the opportunistic fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus |journal=Nature |volume=457 |issue=7228 |pages=471–4 |year=2009 |pmid=19043401 |doi=10.1038/nature07528 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''A. fumigatus'' has a fully functional sexual cycle that produces cleistothecia and [[ascospores]].

==''Cryptococcus''==
[[File:Cryptococcus.jpg|thumb|right|Cryptococcus. [[Fine needle aspiration|FNA specimen]]. [[Field stain]].]]
''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]'' can cause a severe form of [[meningitis]] and meningo-encephalitis in patients with [[HIV]] infection and [[AIDS]]. The majority of ''Cryptococcus'' species live in the soil and do not cause disease in humans. ''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]'' is the major human and animal pathogen. ''Cryptococcus laurentii'' and ''Cryptococcus albidus'' have been known to occasionally cause moderate-to-severe disease in human patients with compromised immunity. ''[[Cryptococcus gattii]]'' is endemic to tropical parts of the continent of Africa and Australia and can cause disease in non-immunocompromised people.&lt;ref name="SanBlasCalderone"/&gt;

Infecting ''C. neoformans'' cells are usually phagocytosed by [[alveolar macrophage]]s in the lung.&lt;ref name="pmid16087747"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fan W, Kraus PR, Boily MJ, Heitman J |title=Cryptococcus neoformans gene expression during murine macrophage infection |journal=Eukaryotic Cell |volume=4 |issue=8 |pages=1420–33 |year=2005 |pmid=16087747 |pmc=1214536 |doi=10.1128/EC.4.8.1420-1433.2005 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The invading ''[[C. neoformans]]'' cells may be killed by the release of oxidative and nitrosative molecules by these macrophages.&lt;ref name="pmid2050398"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alspaugh JA, Granger DL |title=Inhibition of Cryptococcus neoformans replication by nitrogen oxides supports the role of these molecules as effectors of macrophage-mediated cytostasis |journal=Infect. Immun. |volume=59 |issue=7 |pages=2291–6 |year=1991 |pmid=2050398 |pmc=258009 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However some ''C. neoformans'' cells may survive within the macrophages.&lt;ref name="pmid16087747" /&gt;  The ability of the pathogen to survive within the macrophages probably determines latency of the disease, dissemination and resistance to [[antifungal]] agents.  In order to survive in the hostile intracellular environment of the macrophage, one of the responses of ''C. neoformans'' is to [[Downregulation and upregulation|upregulate]] [[gene]]s employed in responses to [[oxidative stress]].&lt;ref name="pmid16087747" /&gt; 

The haploid nuclei of ''C. neoformans'' can undergo nuclear fusion ([[karyogamy]]) to become diploid.  These diploid nuclei may then undergo [[meiosis]], including [[genetic recombination|recombination]], resulting in the formation of haploid [[basidiospore]]s that are able to disperse.&lt;ref name="pmid15846346"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lin X, Hull CM, Heitman J |title=Sexual reproduction between partners of the same mating type in Cryptococcus neoformans |journal=Nature |volume=434 |issue=7036 |pages=1017–21 |year=2005 |pmid=15846346 |doi=10.1038/nature03448 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meiosis may facilitate [[DNA repair|repair]] of ''C. neoformans'' DNA in response to macrophage challenge.&lt;ref name="pmid15846346" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein H, Bernstein C, Michod RE (2018). Sex in microbial pathogens. Infection, Genetics and Evolution volume 57, pages 8-25. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2017.10.024&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Histoplasma''==
[[File:Histoplasma pas-d.jpg|thumb|right|Histoplasmosis. [[PASD stain]].]]
''[[Histoplasma capsulatum]]'' can cause [[histoplasmosis]] in humans, dogs and cats. The fungus is most prevalent in the Americas, India and southeastern Asia. It is endemic in certain areas of the [[United States]]. Infection is usually due to inhaling contaminated air.

==''Pneumocystis''==
''[[Pneumocystis jirovecii]]'' (or Pneumocystis carinii) can cause a form of [[pneumonia]] in people with weakened [[immune system]]s, such as premature children, the elderly and [[AIDS]] patients.&lt;ref name=Sherris&gt;{{cite book | author = Ryan KJ; Ray CG (editors) | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8385-8529-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Stachybotrys''==
''[[Stachybotrys chartarum]]'' or "black mold" can cause respiratory damage and severe headaches. It frequently occurs in houses and in regions that are chronically damp{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}.

==Host Defense Mechanisms==

=== Endothermy ===
Mammalian [[endotherm]]y and homeothermy are potent nonspecific defenses against most fungi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = V. A.| last1 = Robert | first2 = A.| title = Vertebrate Endothermy Restricts Most Fungi as Potential Pathogens| journal = The Journal of Infectious Diseases| volume = 200| pages = 1623–1626| year = 2009 | doi = 10.1086/644642| pmid =  19827944| last2 =  Casadevall| issue =  10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Barrier Tissues ===
The [[skin]], [[respiratory tract]], [[gastrointestinal tract]], and the [[Genitourinary_system|genital-urinary tract]] induced inflammation are common bodily regions of fungal infection.

=== Immune Response ===
Studies have shown that hosts with higher levels of [[Cell-mediated_immunity|immune response cells]] such as [[Monocyte|monocytes]]/[[Macrophage|macrophages]], [[Dendritic_cell|dendritic cells]], and [[Natural_killer_T_cell|invariant natural killer (iNK) T-cells]] exhibited greater control of fungal growth and protection against systemic infection. [[Pattern_recognition_receptor|Pattern recognition receptors]] (PRRs) play an important role in inducing an immune response by recognizing specific fungal pathogens and initiating an immune response.
In the case of mucosal [[candidiasis]], the cells that produce [[Cytokine|cytokine IL-17]] are extremely important in maintaining [[Innate_immune_system|innate immunity]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, G.

[[Bioacoustics]] refers to the creation and reception of sound waves among biological organisms. Measured sound emissions by plants as well as differential germination rates, growth rates and behavioral modifications in response to sound are well documented.&lt;ref&gt;Gagliano M, Renton M, Duvdevani N, Timmins M, Mancuso S. Out of Sight but Not out of Mind: Alternative Means of Communication in Plants. Moora M, ed. PLoS ONE. 2012;7(5):e37382. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0037382.&lt;/ref&gt; Plants detect neighbors by means other than well-established communicative signals including volatile chemicals, light detection, direct contact and root signaling.&lt;ref&gt;Smith H. Phytochromes and light signal perception by plants–an emerging synthesis. Nature. 2000;407:585–591. [PubMed]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karban R, Shiojiri K. Ecol Lett 12: 502–506. (doi; 2009. Self-recognition affects plant communication and defense. 10.1111/j.1461–0248.2009.01313.x) [PubMed]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pare PW, Tumlinson JH. Plant volatiles as a defense against insect herbivores. Plant Physiol. 1999;121:325–331. [PMC free article] [PubMed]&lt;/ref&gt; Because sound waves travel efficiently through soil and can be produced with minimal energy expenditure, plants may use sound as a means for interpreting their environment and surroundings. Preliminary evidence supports that plants create sound in root tips when cell walls break.&lt;ref&gt;Gagliano M (in review) Green symphonies: a call for studies on sound communication in plants. [PubMed]&lt;/ref&gt; Because plant roots respond only to sound waves at frequencies which match waves emitted by the plants themselves, it is likely that plants can receive and transduce sound vibrations into signals to elicit behavioral modifications  as a form of below ground communication.&lt;ref name="Gagliano 2012"&gt;Gagliano, M., Mancuso, S., &amp; Robert, D. (2012). Towards understanding plant bioacoustics. Trends in Plant Science, 17(6), 323-325.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buzz pollination]], or sonication, serves as an example of a behavioral response to specific frequencies of vibrations in plants. Some 2000 plants species, including ''Dodecatheon'' and ''Heliamphora'' have evolved buzz pollination in which they release pollen from anthers only when vibrated at a certain frequency created exclusively by bee flight muscles. The vibrations cause pollen granules to gain kinetic energy and escape from pores in the anthers.&lt;ref&gt;Buchmann, S., &amp; Hurley, J. (1978). A biophysical model for buzz pollination in angiosperms. Journal of Theoretical Biology, 72(4), 639-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants emit audio acoustic emissions between 10–240&amp;nbsp;Hz as well as ultrasonic acoustic emissions (UAE) within 20–300&amp;nbsp;kHz. Evidence for plant mechanosensory abilities are shown when roots are subjected to unidirectional 220&amp;nbsp;Hz sound and subsequently grow in the direction of the vibration source.&lt;ref name="Gagliano 2012"/&gt; Using electrograph vibrational detection, structured sound wave emissions were detected along the elongation zone of root tips of corn plants in the form of loud and frequent clicks. When plants are isolated from contact, chemical, and light signal exchange with neighboring plants they are still able to sense their neighbors and detect relatives through alternative mechanisms, among which sound vibrations could play an important role. Furthermore, ultrasonic acoustic emissions (UAE) have been detected in a range of different plants which result from collapsing water columns under high tension.&lt;ref&gt;Laschimke R, Burger M, Vallen H. 2006. Acoustic emission analysis and experiments with physical model systems reveal a peculiar nature of the xylem tension. J Plant Physiol. 163:996–1007 [PubMed]&lt;/ref&gt; UAE studies show different frequencies of sound emissions based on whether or not drought conditions are present. Whether or not UAE are used by plants as a communication mechanism is not known.&lt;ref&gt;Perks MP, Irvine J, Grace J. 2004. Xylem acoustic signals from mature Pinus sylvestris during an extended drought. Ann Forest Sci. 61:1–8&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Although the explicit mechanisms through which sound emissions are created and detected in plants are not known, there are theories which shed light on possible mechanisms. Mechanical vibrations caused by charged cell membranes and walls is a leading hypothesis for acoustic emission generation. Myosins and other mechanochemical enzymes which use chemical energy in the form of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to produce mechanical vibrations in cells may also contribute to sound wave generation in plant cells. These mechanisms may lead to overall nanomechanical oscillations of cytoskeletal components, which can generate both low and high frequency vibrations.&lt;ref name="Gagliano 2012"/&gt;

The '''pressuron''' is a hypothetical [[scalar particle]] which couples to both gravity and matter theorised in 2013.&lt;ref name="2013PhRvD..88d1504M"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Minazzoli, O. |author2=Hees, A. |date=August 2013 |title= Intrinsic Solar System decoupling of a scalar-tensor theory with a universal coupling between the scalar field and the matter Lagrangian |journal=Physical Review D |volume=88 |issue=4 |pages=041504 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.88.041504 |url=http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.88.041504 |accessdate= |quote= |pmid= |bibcode=2013PhRvD..88d1504M |arxiv=1308.2770}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although originally postulated without self-interaction potential, the pressuron is also a [[dark energy]] candidate when it has such a potential.&lt;ref name=2014arXiv1406.6187H&gt;{{cite journal|author=Minazzoli, O.|author2=Hees, A. |date=July 2014  |title= Late-time cosmology of a scalar-tensor theory with a universal multiplicative coupling between the scalar field and the matter Lagrangian |journal=Physical Review D |volume=90 |issue= 2 |pages=023017 |doi= 10.1103/PhysRevD.90.023017|url= http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.90.023017|accessdate= |quote= |pmid= |bibcode=  2014PhRvD..90b3017M|arxiv = 1404.4266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pressuron takes its name from the fact that it decouples from matter in pressure-less regimes,&lt;ref name=2014arXiv1406.6187H/&gt; allowing the [[scalar-tensor theory]] of gravity involving it to pass [[Tests of general relativity#Post-Newtonian tests of gravity|solar system tests]], as well as tests on the [[equivalence principle]], even though it is fundamentally coupled to matter. Such a decoupling mechanism could explain why gravitation seems to be well described by [[general relativity]] at present epoch, while it could actually be more complex than that. Because of the way it couples to matter, the pressuron is a special case of the hypothetical [[Dilaton|string dilaton]].&lt;ref name=1994NuPhB.423..532D&gt;{{cite journal|author=Damour, T.|author2=Polyakov, A.M. |date=July 1994  |title= The string dilaton and a least coupling principle |journal=Nuclear Physics B |volume=423 |issue=  |pages=532–558 |doi= 10.1016/0550-3213(94)90143-0|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0550321394901430|accessdate= |quote= |pmid= |bibcode=  1994NuPhB.423..532D|arxiv = hep-th/9401069}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is one of the possible solutions to the present non-observation of various signals coming from massless or light scalar fields that are generically predicted in string theory.

== Mathematical formulation ==

The action of the [[scalar-tensor theory]] that involves the pressuron &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;S= \frac{1}{c}\int  d^4x \sqrt{-g} \left[ \sqrt{\Phi} \mathcal{L}_m (g_{\mu \nu}, \Psi) + 
 \frac{1}{2\kappa}\left(\Phi  R-\frac{\omega(\Phi)}{\Phi} (\partial_\sigma \Phi)^2-V(\Phi) \right) \right], &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Scalar curvature|Ricci scalar]] constructed from the [[Metric tensor|metric]] &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the metric determinant, &lt;math&gt;\kappa=\frac{8\pi G}{c^4}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; the gravitational constant&lt;ref&gt;Note however that it is different from the [[Gravitational constant|effective constant]] measured with [[Cavendish experiment|Cavendish-type experiments]] (see also [[Scalar-tensor theory]])&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; the [[Speed of light|velocity of light]] in vacuum, &lt;math&gt;V(\Phi)&lt;/math&gt; is the pressuron potential and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_m&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|matter Lagrangian]]&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Electroweak interaction#After electroweak symmetry breaking|Electroweak lagrangian]] and [[Quantum chromodynamics#Lagrangian|Quantum chromodynamics lagrangian]]&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; represents the non-gravitational fields. The gravitational field equations therefore write&lt;ref name=2014arXiv1406.6187H/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R_{\mu \nu}-\frac{1}{2}g_{\mu \nu}R= \kappa~ \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Phi}}T_{\mu \nu}+ \frac{1}{\Phi} [\nabla_{\mu} \nabla_{\nu} -g_{\mu \nu}\Box]\Phi  
+\frac{\omega(\Phi)}{\Phi^2}\left[\partial_{\mu} \Phi \partial_{\nu} \Phi - \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu \nu}(\partial_{\alpha}\Phi)^2\right]-g_{\mu \nu} \frac{V(\Phi)}{2 \Phi} ,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2\omega(\Phi)+3}{\Phi}\Box \Phi= \kappa \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Phi}} \left(  T -  \mathcal{L}_m \right)  - \frac{\omega'(\Phi)}{\Phi} (\partial_\sigma \Phi)^2 + V'(\Phi) - 2 \frac{V(\Phi)}{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt;.

where &lt;math&gt;T_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[stress–energy tensor]] of the matter field,
and &lt;math&gt;T = g^{\mu\nu} T_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is its [[Trace_(linear_algebra)|trace]].

=== Decoupling mechanism ===

If one considers a pressure-free [[perfect fluid]] (also known as a "dust"), the effective material Lagrangian becomes &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_m = - c^2 \sum_i \mu_i \delta(x^\alpha_i)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name=2013PhRvD..88b7506M&gt;{{cite journal
|author=Minazzoli, O.
|date=July 2013
|title=Conservation laws in theories with universal gravity/matter coupling
|journal=Physical Review D
|volume=88
|issue=2
|pages=027506
|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.88.027506

|bibcode= 2013PhRvD..88b7506M
|arxiv = 1307.1590}}&lt;/ref&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mu_i&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the ith particle, &lt;math&gt;x^\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; its position, and &lt;math&gt;\delta(x^\alpha_i)&lt;/math&gt; the [[Dirac delta function]], 
while at the same time the trace of the stress-energy tensor reduces to &lt;math&gt;T = - c^2 \sum_i \mu_i \delta(x^\alpha_i)&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, there is an exact cancellation of the pressuron material source term &lt;math&gt; \left(  T -  \mathcal{L}_m \right) &lt;/math&gt;, and hence the pressuron effectively decouples from pressure-free matter fields.

In other words, the specific coupling between the scalar field and the material fields in the Lagrangian leads to a decoupling between the scalar field and the matter fields in the limit that the matter field is exerting zero pressure. 

=== Link to string theory ===

The pressuron shares some characteristics with the hypothetical [[Dilaton|string dilaton]],&lt;ref name=1994NuPhB.423..532D/&gt;&lt;ref name=Minazzoli2014119&gt;{{cite journal|author=Minazzoli O. |date=July 2014  |title= On the cosmic convergence mechanism of the massless dilaton|journal=Physics Letters B |volume=735 |issue= 2 |pages=119–121 |doi=  10.1016/j.physletb.2014.06.027|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269314004304|accessdate= |quote= |pmid= |bibcode=  2014PhLB..735..119M|arxiv = 1312.4357}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can actually be viewed as a special case of the wider family of possible dilatons.&lt;ref name=PhysRevD.65.023508&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gasperini, M.|author2=Piazza, F.|author3=Veneziano, G.|last-author-amp=yes |date=December 2001  |title= Quintessence as a runaway dilaton |journal=Physical Review D |volume=65 |issue= 2 |pages=023508 |doi= 10.1103/PhysRevD.65.023508|url= http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.65.023508|accessdate= |quote= |pmid= |bibcode=  2002PhRvD..65b3508G|arxiv = gr-qc/0108016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since perturbative [[string theory]] cannot currently give the expected coupling of the string dilaton with material fields in the effective 4-dimension action, it seems conceivable that the pressuron may be the string dilaton in the 4-dimension effective action.

== Experimental search ==

=== Solar System ===

According to Minazzoli and Hees,&lt;ref name=2013PhRvD..88d1504M /&gt; [[Post-Newtonian expansion|post-Newtonian]] tests of gravitation in the Solar System should lead to the same results as what is expected from [[general relativity]], except for gravitational redshift experiments, which should deviate from [[general relativity]] with a relative magnitude of the order of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\omega_0} \frac{P}{c^2 \rho} \sim \frac{10^{-6}}{\omega_0}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; is the current cosmological value of the scalar-field function &lt;math&gt;\omega(\Phi)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; are respectively the mean pressure and density of the Earth (for instance). Current best constraints on the gravitational redshift come from [[Gravity Probe A|gravity probe A]] and are at the &lt;math&gt;10^{-4}&lt;/math&gt; level only. Therefore, the [[scalar-tensor theory]] that involves the pressuron is weakly constrained by Solar System experiments.

=== Cosmological variation of the fundamental coupling constants ===

Because of its non-minimal couplings, the pressuron leads to a variation of the [[Coupling constant|fundamental coupling constants]]&lt;ref&gt;Note that this is a classical effect, and it should not be confused with the [[Coupling constant#Running coupling|quantum running]] of the coupling constants&lt;/ref&gt; in regimes where it effectively couples to matter.&lt;ref name=2014arXiv1406.6187H /&gt; However, since the pressuron decouples in both the [[matter-dominated era]] (which is essentially driven by pressure-less material fields) and the [[dark-energy-dominated era]] (which is essentially driven by dark energy&lt;ref&gt;In the context of the pressuron, dark energy can either be a [[cosmological constant]] or due to a non-vanishing scalar potential &lt;math&gt;V(\Phi)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;), the pressuron is also weakly constrained by current cosmological tests on the variation of the coupling constants.

=== Test with binary pulsars ===

Although no calculations seem to have been performed regarding this issue, it has been argued that [[binary pulsar]]s should give greater constraints on the existence of the pressuron because of the high pressure of bodies involved in such systems.&lt;ref name=2013PhRvD..88d1504M /&gt;

'''Radiation pressure''' is the [[pressure]] exerted upon any surface due to the exchange of [[momentum]] between the object and the [[electromagnetic field]]. This includes the momentum of light or [[electromagnetic radiation]] of any [[wavelength]] which is [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]],  [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]], or otherwise emitted (e.g. [[black body radiation]]) by matter on any scale (from macroscopic objects to dust particles to gas molecules).&lt;ref&gt;Stellar Atmospheres, D.

The forces generated by radiation pressure are generally too small to be noticed under everyday circumstances; however, they are important in some physical processes. This particularly includes objects in [[outer space]] where it is usually the main force acting on objects besides gravity, and where the net effect of a tiny force may have a large cumulative effect over long periods of time. For example, had the effects of the sun's radiation pressure on the spacecraft of the [[Viking program]] been ignored, the spacecraft would have missed Mars orbit by about {{cvt|15000|km|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Hecht, "Optics", 4th edition (p. 57)&lt;/ref&gt; Radiation pressure from starlight is crucial in a number of [[astrophysical]] processes as well. The significance of radiation pressure increases rapidly at extremely high temperatures, and can sometimes dwarf the usual [[Kinetic theory of gases|gas pressure]], for instance in [[Stellar structure|stellar interiors]] and [[thermonuclear weapons]].

Radiation pressure can equally well be accounted for by considering the momentum of a classical electromagnetic field or in terms of the momenta of [[photons]], particles of light. The interaction of electromagnetic waves or photons with matter may involve an exchange of [[momentum]]. Due to the law of [[conservation of momentum]], any change in the total momentum of the waves or photons must involve an equal and opposite change in the momentum of the matter it interacted with ([[Newton's third law of motion]]), as is illustrated in the accompanying figure for the case of light being perfectly reflected by a surface. This transfer of momentum is the general explanation for what we term radiation pressure.

== Discovery ==
[[Johannes Kepler]] put forward the concept of radiation pressure back in 1619 to explain the observation that a tail of a [[comet]] always points away from the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Kepler|author-link=Johannes Kepler|title=[[De Cometis Libelli Tres]]|date=1619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assertion that light, as [[electromagnetic radiation]], has the property of [[momentum]] and thus exerts a [[pressure]] upon any surface it is exposed to was published by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1862, and proven experimentally by Russian physicist [[Pyotr Nikolaevich Lebedev|Pyotr Lebedev]] in 1900&lt;ref&gt;P. Lebedev, 1901, "Untersuchungen über die Druckkräfte des Lichtes", Annalen der Physik, 1901&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Ernest Fox Nichols]] and [[Gordon Ferrie Hull]] in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, E.F &amp; Hull, G.F. (1903) [https://books.google.com/books?id=8n8OAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA5-PA327&amp;dq=torsion+balance+radiation The Pressure due to Radiation], ''The Astrophysical Journal'',Vol.17 No.5, p.315-351&lt;/ref&gt; The pressure is very feeble, but can be detected by allowing the radiation to fall upon a delicately poised vane of reflective metal in a [[Nichols radiometer]] (this should not be confused with the [[Crookes radiometer]], whose characteristic motion is ''not'' caused by radiation pressure but by impacting gas molecules).

== Theory ==
{{See also|Electromagnetic radiation|Speed of light}}
Radiation pressure can be viewed as a consequence of the [[conservation of momentum]] given the momentum attributed to electromagnetic radiation. That momentum can be equally well calculated on the basis of electromagnetic theory or from the combined momenta of a stream of photons, giving identical results as is shown below.

=== Radiation pressure from momentum of an electromagnetic wave ===
{{Main|Poynting vector}}
According to Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism, an electromagnetic wave carries momentum, which will be transferred to an opaque surface it strikes.

The energy flux (irradiance) of a plane wave is calculated using the [[Poynting vector]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt;, whose magnitude we denote by S. S divided by the [[speed of light]] is the density of the linear momentum per unit area (pressure) of the electromagnetic field. That pressure is experienced as radiation pressure on the surface:

:&lt;math&gt;    P_\text{incident}=\frac{\langle S\rangle}{c} = \frac{I_f}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is pressure (usually in [[Pascals]]), &lt;math&gt;I_f&lt;/math&gt; is the incident [[irradiance]] (usually in W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum.

If the surface is planar at an angle &amp;alpha; to the incident wave, the intensity across the surface will be geometrically reduced by the cosine of that angle and the component of the radiation force against the surface will also be reduced by the cosine of &amp;alpha;, resulting in a pressure:

:&lt;math&gt; P_\text{incident} = \frac{I_f}{c} \cos^2 \alpha &lt;/math&gt;

The momentum from the incident wave is in the same direction of that wave.  But only the component of that momentum normal to the surface contributes to the pressure on the surface, as given above.  The component of that force tangent to the surface is not called pressure.&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;

=== Radiation pressure from reflection ===
The above treatment for an incident wave accounts for the radiation pressure experienced by a black (totally absorbing) body. If the wave is [[specularly reflected]], then the recoil due to the reflected wave will further contribute to the radiation pressure. In the case of a perfect reflector, this pressure will be identical to the pressure caused by the incident wave:

:&lt;math&gt;    P_\text{emitted}= \frac{I_f}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

thus ''doubling'' the net radiation pressure on the surface:

:&lt;math&gt;    P_\text{net}=   P_\text{incident} +  P_\text{emitted}= 2 \frac{I_f}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

For a partially reflective surface, the second term must be multiplied by the reflectivity (also known as reflection coefficient of intensity), so that the increase is less than double. For a [[Diffuse reflection|diffusely reflective]] surface, the details of the reflection and geometry must be taken into account, again resulting in an increased net radiation pressure of less than double.

===Radiation pressure by emission===
Just as a wave reflected from a body contributes to the net radiation pressure experienced, a body that emits radiation of its own (rather than reflected) obtains a radiation pressure again given by the irradiance of that emission ''in the direction normal to the surface'' ''I&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'':

:&lt;math&gt;    P_\text{emitted}= \frac{I_e}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

The emission can be from [[black body radiation]] or any other radiative mechanism. Since all materials emit black body radiation (unless they are totally reflective or at absolute zero), this source for radiation pressure is ubiquitous but usually very tiny. However, because black body radiation increases rapidly with temperature (according to the fourth power of temperature as given by the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]]), radiation pressure due to the temperature of a very hot object (or due to incoming black body radiation from similarly hot surroundings) can become very significant. This becomes important in stellar interiors which are at millions of degrees.

=== Radiation pressure in terms of photons ===
{{See also|Photons|Momentum}}
Electromagnetic radiation can be [[wave–particle duality|viewed]] in terms of particles rather than waves; these particles are known as [[photons]]. Photons do not have a rest-mass, however photons are never at rest (they move at the speed of light) and acquire a momentum nonetheless which is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;
p = \dfrac{h}{\lambda} = \frac{E_p}{c},
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''p'' is momentum, ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]], &amp;lambda; is [[wavelength]], and ''c'' is speed of light in vacuum. And ''E&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the energy of a single photon given by: 
:&lt;math&gt;
E_p = h \nu =\frac{h c}{\lambda}
&lt;/math&gt;

The radiation pressure again can be seen as the transfer of each photon's momentum to the opaque surface, plus the momentum due to a (possible) recoil photon for a (partially) reflecting surface. Since an incident wave of irradiance ''I&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' over an area ''A'' has a power of  ''I&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;A'', this implies a flux of ''I&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;/E&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' photons per second per unit area striking the surface. Combining this with the above expression for the momentum of a single photon, results in the same relationships between irradiance and radiation pressure described above using classical electromagnetics. And again, reflected or otherwise emitted photons will contribute to the net radiation pressure identically.

===Compression in a uniform radiation field===

In general, the pressure of electromagnetic waves can be obtained from the [[Electromagnetic_stress–energy_tensor#Algebraic_properties|vanishing of the trace of the electromagnetic stress tensor]]: Since this trace [[Stress–energy_tensor#Stress–energy_of_a_fluid_in_equilibrium|equals 3''P'' - ''u'']], we get
:&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{u}{3}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''u'' is the radiation density per unit volume. 

This can also be shown in the specific case of the pressure exerted on surfaces of a body in [[thermal equilibrium]] with its surroundings, at a temperature ''T'': The body will be surrounded by a uniform radiation field described by the [[Planck law|Planck black body radiation law]], and will experience a compressive pressure due to that impinging radiation, its reflection, and its own black body emission. From that it can be shown that the resulting pressure is equal to one third of the total radiant energy per unit volume in the surrounding space.&lt;ref&gt;Shankar R., ''Principles of Quantum Mechanics'', 2nd edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Bradley W.  &amp; Dale A. Ostlie, ''An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics'', 2nd edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, John David, (1999) ''Classical Electrodynamics''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kardar, Mehran. "Statistical Physics of Particles".&lt;/ref&gt;

By using [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]], this can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{compress} = \frac{u}{3} = \frac{4\sigma}{3c} T^4 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Stefan–Boltzmann constant]].

==Solar radiation pressure==

Solar radiation pressure is due to the sun's radiation at closer distances, thus especially within the [[solar system]].  While it acts on all objects, its net effect is generally greater on smaller bodies since they have a larger ratio of surface area to mass.  All spacecraft experience such a pressure except when they are behind the shadow of a larger [[Orbiting body | orbiting body]].

Solar radiation pressure on objects near the earth may be calculated using the sun's [[irradiance]] at 1&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]], known as the [[solar constant]] or ''G&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;'', whose value is set at '''1361&amp;nbsp;[[Watt|W]]/[[Metre|m]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''' as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All stars have a [[spectral energy distribution]] that depends on their surface temperature.  The distribution is approximately that of [[black-body radiation]].  This distribution must be taken into account when calculating the radiation pressure or identifying reflector materials for optimizing a [[solar sail]] for instance.

===Pressures of absorption and reflection===

Solar radiation pressure at the earth's distance from the sun, may be calculated by dividing the [[solar constant]] ''G&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;'' (above) by the [[speed of light]] c.  For an absorbing sheet facing the sun, this is simply:&lt;ref name="RMG"&gt;Georgevic, R. M. (1973) "The Solar Radiation Pressure Forces and Torques Model", ''The Journal of the Astronautical Sciences'', Vol. 27, No. 1, Jan–Feb. First known publication describing how solar radiation pressure creates forces and torques that affect spacecraft.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; P  = \frac{G_\text{SC}}{c}  \approx  4.5 \cdot 10^{-6}  \textsf{ Pa} = 4.5 \mu \textsf{Pa} &lt;/math&gt;

This result is in the [[S.I.]] unit [[Pascals]], equivalent to N/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ([[Newtons]] per square meter). For a sheet at an angle α to the sun, the effective area ''A'' of a sheet is reduced by a geometrical factor resulting in a force ''in the direction of the sunlight'' of:

:&lt;math&gt; F = \frac{G_\text{SC}}{c } (A \cos \alpha)&lt;/math&gt;

To find the component of this force normal to the surface, another cosine factor must be applied resulting in a pressure ''P'' on the surface of:

:&lt;math&gt; P  =  \frac{F}{A} = \frac{G_\text{SC}}{c} \cos^2 \alpha &lt;/math&gt;

Note, however, that in order to account for the net effect of solar radiation on a spacecraft for instance, one would need to consider the ''total'' force (in the direction away from the sun) given by the preceding equation, rather than just the component normal to the surface that we identify as "pressure".

The solar constant is defined for the sun's radiation at the distance to the earth, also known as one [[astronomical unit]] (AU). Consequently, at a distance of ''R'' astronomical units (''R'' thus being dimensionless), applying the [[inverse square law]], we would find:

:&lt;math&gt; P  = \frac{G_\text{SC}}{c R^2} \cos^2 \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, considering not an absorbing but a perfectly reflecting surface, the pressure is ''doubled'' due to the reflected wave, resulting in:

:&lt;math&gt; P  = 2\frac{G_\text{SC}}{c R^2} \cos^2 \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

Note that unlike the case of an absorbing material, the resulting force on a reflecting body is given exactly by this pressure acting normal to the surface, with the tangential forces from the incident and reflecting waves canceling each other. In practice, materials are neither totally reflecting nor totally absorbing, so the resulting force will be a weighted average of the forces calculated using these formulae.

===Radiation pressure perturbations===
{{See also|Yarkovsky effect|YORP effect|Poynting–Robertson effect}}

Solar radiation pressure is a source of [[Perturbation (astronomy)|orbital perturbations]].  It significantly affects the orbits and trajectories of small bodies including all spacecraft.

Solar radiation pressure affects bodies throughout much of the Solar System.  Small bodies are more affected than large because of their lower mass relative to their surface area.  Spacecraft are affected along with natural bodies (comets, asteroids, dust grains, gas molecules).

The radiation pressure results in forces and torques on the bodies that can change their translational and rotational motions.  Translational changes affect the orbits of the bodies.  Rotational rates may increase or decrease.  Loosely aggregated bodies may break apart under high rotation rates.  Dust grains can either leave the Solar System or spiral into the Sun.

A whole body is typically composed of numerous surfaces that have different orientations on the body.  The facets may be flat or curved.  They will have different areas.  They may have optical properties differing from other aspects.

At any particular time, some facets will be exposed to the Sun and some will be in shadow.  Each surface exposed to the Sun will be reflecting, absorbing, and emitting radiation.  Facets in shadow will be emitting radiation.  The summation of pressures across all of the facets will define the net force and torque on the body.  These can be calculated using the equations in the preceding sections.&lt;ref name="Wright" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RMG" /&gt;

The [[Yarkovsky effect]] affects the translation of a small body.  It results from a face leaving solar exposure being at a higher temperature than a face approaching solar exposure.  The radiation emitted from the warmer face will be more intense than that of the opposite face, resulting in a net force on the body that will affect its motion.

The [[YORP effect]] is a collection of effects expanding upon the earlier concept of the Yarkovsky effect, but of a similar nature.  It affects the spin properties of bodies.

The [[Poynting–Robertson effect]] applies to grain-size particles.  From the perspective of a grain of dust circling the Sun, the Sun's radiation appears to be coming from a slightly forward direction ([[aberration of light]]). Therefore, the absorption of this radiation leads to a force with a component against the direction of movement. (The angle of aberration is tiny since the radiation is moving at the speed of light while the dust grain is moving many orders of magnitude slower than that.)  The result is a gradual spiral of dust grains into the Sun.  Over long periods of time, this effect cleans out much of the dust in the Solar System.

While rather small in comparison to other forces, the radiation pressure force is inexorable.  Over long periods of time, the net effect of the force is substantial.  Such feeble pressures can produce marked effects upon minute particles like [[gas]] [[ion]]s and [[electron]]s, and are essential in the theory of electron emission from the Sun, of [[comet]]ary material, and so on.

Because the ratio of surface area to volume (and thus mass) increases with decreasing particle size, dusty ([[micrometre]]-size) particles are susceptible to radiation pressure even in the outer solar system.  For example, the evolution of the [[Rings of Saturn#Outer rings|outer rings of Saturn]] is significantly influenced by radiation pressure.

As a consequence of light pressure, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Einstein, A.|title=On the development of our views concerning the nature and constitution of radiation. Translated in: The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, vol. 2 (Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1989)|date=1909|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=391}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1909 predicted the existence of "radiation friction" which would oppose the movement of matter. He wrote, “radiation will exert pressure on both sides of the plate. The forces of pressure exerted on the two sides are equal if the plate is at rest. However, if it is in motion, more radiation will be reflected on the surface that is ahead during the motion (front surface) than on the back surface. The backward acting force of pressure exerted on the front surface is thus larger than the force of pressure acting on the back. Hence, as the resultant of the two forces, there remains a force that counteracts the motion of the plate and that increases with the velocity of the plate. We will call this resultant 'radiation friction' in brief.”

===Solar sails===
{{main|Solar sail}}
Solar sailing, an experimental method of [[spacecraft propulsion]], uses radiation pressure from the Sun as a motive force. The idea of interplanetary travel by light was mentioned by [[Jules Verne]] in ''From the Earth to the Moon''.

A sail reflects about 90% of the incident radiation.  The 10% that is absorbed is radiated away from both surfaces, with the proportion emitted from the unlit surface depending on the thermal conductivity of the sail.  A sail has curvature, surface irregularities, and other minor factors that affect its performance.

The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ([[JAXA]]) has successfully unfurled a solar sail in space which has already succeeded in propelling its payload with the [[IKAROS]] project.

==Cosmic effects of radiation pressure==

Radiation pressure has had a major effect on the development of the cosmos, from the birth of the universe to ongoing formation of stars and shaping of clouds of dust and gasses on a wide range of scales.

===The early universe===

The [[photon epoch]] is a phase when the energy of the universe was dominated by photons, between 10 seconds and 380,000 years after the [[Big Bang]].

===Galaxy formation and evolution===

The process of [[galaxy formation and evolution]] began early in the history of the cosmos. Observations of the early universe strongly suggest that objects grew from bottom-up (i.e., smaller objects merging to form larger ones). As stars are thereby formed and become sources of electromagnetic radiation, radiation pressure from the stars becomes a factor in the dynamics of remaining [[Circumstellar disc|circumstellar]] material.

===Clouds of dust and gases===
[[File:Pillars 2014 HST denoise 0.6 12.jpg|thumb|The ''Pillars of Creation'' clouds within the [[Eagle Nebula]] shaped by radiation pressure and stellar winds.]]
The [[gravitational compression]] of clouds of dust and gases is strongly influenced by radiation pressure, especially when the condensations lead to star births.  The larger young stars forming within the compressed clouds emit intense levels of radiation that shift the clouds, causing either dispersion or condensations in nearby regions, which influences birth rates in those nearby regions.

===Clusters of stars===
&lt;!--[[File:M92 arp 750pix.jpg|thumb|250px|Star cluster [[Messier 92]].]]--&gt;
Stars predominantly form in regions of large clouds of dust and gases, giving rise to [[star cluster]]s.  Radiation pressure from the member stars eventually disperses the clouds, which can have a profound effect on the evolution of the cluster.

Many [[open cluster]]s are inherently unstable, with a small enough mass that the [[escape velocity]] of the system is lower than the average [[velocity]] of the constituent stars. These clusters will rapidly disperse within a few million years. In many cases, the stripping away of the gas from which the cluster formed by the radiation pressure of the hot young stars reduces the cluster mass enough to allow rapid dispersal.

===Star formation===

[[Star formation]] is the process by which dense regions within [[molecular cloud]]s in [[interstellar space]] collapse to form [[star]]s. As a branch of [[astronomy]], star formation includes the study of the [[interstellar medium]] and [[giant molecular cloud]]s (GMC) as precursors to the star formation process, and the study of [[protostar]]s and [[young stellar object]]s as its immediate products.  Star formation theory, as well as accounting for the formation of a single star, must also account for the statistics of [[binary star]]s and the [[initial mass function]].

===Stellar planetary systems===
[[File:David A. Aguilar's Red Dwarf Stars.jpg|thumb|A protoplanetary disk with a cleared central region (artist's conception).]]
[[Planetary system]]s are generally believed to form as part of the same process that results in [[star formation]]. A [[protoplanetary disk]] forms by gravitational collapse of a [[molecular cloud]], called a [[solar nebula]],  and then evolves into a planetary system by collisions and gravitational capture. Radiation pressure can clear a region in the immediate vicinity of the star. As the formation process continues, radiation pressure continues to play a role in affecting the distribution of matter.  In particular, dust and grains can spiral into the star or escape the stellar system under the action of radiation pressure.

===Stellar interiors===

In [[star|stellar]] interiors the temperatures are very high. Stellar models predict a temperature of 15&amp;nbsp;MK in the center of the [[Sun]], and at the cores of [[supergiant]] stars the temperature may exceed 1&amp;nbsp;GK. As the radiation pressure scales as the fourth power of the temperature, it becomes important at these high temperatures. In the Sun, radiation pressure is still quite small when compared to the gas pressure. In the heaviest non-degenerate stars, radiation pressure is the dominant pressure component.&lt;ref&gt;Dale A. Ostlie and Bradley W. Carroll, ''An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics'' (2nd edition), page 341, Pearson, San Francisco, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comets===
[[File:Comet Hale-Bopp 1995O1.jpg|thumb|[[Comet Hale–Bopp]] (C/1995 O1). Radiation pressure and solar wind effects on the dust and gas tails are clearly seen.]]
Solar radiation pressure strongly affects [[comet tail]]s.  Solar heating causes gases to be released from the [[comet nucleus]], which also carry away dust grains.  Radiation pressure and [[solar wind]] then drive the dust and gases away from the Sun's direction.  The gases form a generally straight tail, while slower moving dust particles create a broader, curving tail.

== Laser applications of radiation pressure==

=== Optical tweezers===

Lasers can be used as a source of monochromatic light with wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. With a set of lenses, one can focus the laser beam to a point that is &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; in diameter (or &lt;math&gt;r = \frac{\lambda}{2}&lt;/math&gt;). 

The radiation pressure of a 30 mW laser of 1064 nm can therefore be computed as follows: 

&lt;math&gt;A_{rea} = \pi\left(\frac{\lambda}{2}\right)^2 \approx 10^{-12} \text{ m}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;F_{orce} = \frac{P_{ower}} {c} = \frac{30 \text{ mW}} {299792458 \text{ m/s}} \approx 10^{-10} \text{ N}  &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P_{ressure} = \frac{F_{orce}} {A_{rea}} \approx \frac{10^{-10} \text{ N}} {10^{-12} \text{ m}^2} = 100 \text{ Pascal}&lt;/math&gt;

This is used in [[optical tweezers]]. 

=== Other examples===
[[Laser cooling]] is applied to cooling materials very close to absolute zero.  Atoms traveling towards a laser light source perceive a [[doppler effect]] tuned to the absorption frequency of the target element. The radiation pressure on the atom slows movement in a particular direction until the Doppler effect moves out of the frequency range of the element, causing an overall cooling effect.

Large lasers operating in space have been suggested as a means of propelling sail craft in [[beam-powered propulsion]].

The reflection of a laser pulse from the surface of an elastic solid gives rise to various types of elastic waves that propagate inside the solid. The weakest waves are generally those that are generated by the radiation pressure acting during the reflection of the light. Recently, such light-pressure-induced elastic waves were observed inside an ultrahigh-reflectivity [[dielectric mirror]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Požar |first1=T. |last2=Možina |first2=J. |title=Measurement of Elastic Waves Induced by the Reflection of Light. |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=111 |issue=18 |page=185501 |doi=10.1103/Physrevlett.111.185501}}&lt;/ref&gt; These waves are the most basic fingerprint of a light-solid matter interaction on the macroscopic scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Požar |first1=T. |last2=Laloš |first2=J. |last3=Babnik |first3=A. |last4=Petkovšek |first4=R. |last5=Bethune-Waddell |first5=M. |last6=Chau |first6=K.

'''Reverence''' ({{IPA|/ˈrɛvərəns/}}) is "a feeling or attitude of deep [[respect]] tinged with [[awe]]; veneration".&lt;ref&gt;Reverence | Define Reverence at Dictionary.com. (n.d.). Dictionary.com | Free Online Dictionary for English Definitions. Retrieved April 28, 2011, from http://dictionary.reference.com&lt;/ref&gt;  The word "reverence" in the modern day is often used in relationship with [[religion]].  This is because religion often stimulates the emotion through recognition of [[God]], the [[supernatural]], and the [[ineffability|ineffable]].  Reverence involves a humbling of the self in respectful recognition of something perceived to be greater than the self.  Thus religion is commonly a place where reverence is felt.

However, similar to [[awe]], reverence is an emotion in its own right, and can be felt outside of the realm of [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Gibbons|first= Kendyl   |date=  May 15, 2012 |title= Primal reverence |journal= UU World |volume=   XXVII No. 2 |issue= Summer 2012 |pages=  |publisher= [[Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations]] |id=   |doi= |url=  http://www.uuworld.org/ideas/articles/199598.shtml |quote= Reverence is an organic human experience that requires no supernatural explanations.'|accessdate= July 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas awe may be characterized as an overwhelming "[[sensitivity (human)|sensitivity]] to greatness," reverence is seen more as "acknowledging a [[subjectivity|subjective]] response to something [[excellence|excellent]] in a personal ([[moral]] or [[spirituality|spiritual]]) way, but qualitatively above oneself" &lt;ref&gt;Roberts, R. C. (2003). Emotions: An essay in aid of moral psychology. New York: Cambridge University Press. p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; Solomon describes awe as passive, but reverence as active, noting that the [[feeling]] of awe (i.e., becoming awestruck) implies [[paralysis]], whereas feelings of reverence are associated more with active [[engagement]] and responsibility toward that which one reveres.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, R. C. (2002). Spirituality for the skeptic: The thoughtful love of life. New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nature]], [[science]], [[literature]], [[philosophy]], great [[philosophers]], [[leaders]], [[artists]], [[art]], [[music]], [[wisdom]], and [[beauty]] may each act as the stimulus and focus of reverence.

== Religion and music ==
David Pugmire’s article, "The Secular Reception of Religious Music" explores the unique experience of reverence through music.  In particular he looks at how religious music has the capacity to instill emotions of reverence, awe, wonder, and veneration in secular people who lack the context to fully understand the transcendent through religion.  "Sacred music seems to have a surprising power over unbelievers not just to quicken or delight them as other music does, but also to ply them, as little else can, with what might be called devotional feelings".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"&gt;Pugmire, D. (2006). The Secular Reception of Religious Music. Philosophy, 81(315), 65-79. {{doi|10.1017/S0031819106000040}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Even with this though, Pugmire argues that the secularist cannot fully comprehend the nature of sacred art including sacred music.  "Its undoubted expressiveness can lead him at most to accesses of feeling, not to emotion in the fullest sense, i.e., emotion with appropriate objects sustained by appropriate judgments".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;

Pugmire believes that reverence belongs to the range of emotions that can be classified in their devotional or [[sacred]] forms, "Emotions of reverence, solemnity, agape, hope, serenity, and ecstasy".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  But this classification of emotions poses an interesting question: can any emotion be purely religious?  "A central candidate for a distinctively religious emotion would be reverence".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  But it is not entirely distinct from the rest of the emotions that are not related to transcendence or religion.  "Reverence is indeed graver, and an attitude in which one is more given over, than its secular approximations in the shape of approval or esteem or respect".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  But this does not make it purely religious.  In fact, "[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] was able to claim reverence as our principal moral emotion without invoking any grounding theological basis for this".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  "Similarly for its bracing sibling, awe: it figures in our experience of the sublime, of which Kant purports to find an entirely secular account".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  To connect the secular and the sacred emotions Pugmire looks at the emotions which can be experienced equally in both contexts.  These are, "Love, humility, sorrow, pity, joy, serenity, ecstasy".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  Pugmire then suggests that devotional emotion is: "The transfiguring of mundane emotion into what one might call emotion of the last instance, to the reception and expression of which religious imagery is especially well-suited, and not accidentally".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  The emotion of the last instance refers to the capacity of the emotional imagination to lose the sense of self and engage in the infinite and the ineffable.  Pugmire is suggesting that religion, "Provides a strikingly apt vocabulary for the expression of emotion of the last instance".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  Reverence is perhaps the most critical of these "emotions of the last instance" and can be adequately accessed through religious music.

==Major Theorists of Reverence ==

=== Paul Woodruff ===
[[Paul Woodruff]] in his book, ''Reverence: Renewing a Forgotten Virtue'', assesses the current understanding of the emotion reverence in the modern era.  He assesses that a true understanding of reverence is missing from both modern society and the "modern discussions of the ancient cultures that prized it" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;3).  Specifically these ancient cultures include [[Greece]] and [[China]].  Woodruff’s best definition of Reverence is, "The well-developed capacity to have the feelings of [[awe]], [[respect]], and [[shame]] when these are the right feelings to have" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;8).  Thus Woodruff’s definition of reverence includes the combination of three other emotions: respect, shame, and awe.  "Respect is for other people, shame is over one’s own shortcomings, and awe is usually felt toward something transcendent" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;65).
Although Woodruff acknowledges the relationship between reverence and religion he argues that, "Reverence has more to do with politics than with religion" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;4).  Woodruff in his book is trying to separate the common misunderstanding that reverent emotions can only be related to religion.

Woodruff sees [[ceremony]] and [[ritual]] as key elements in meaningful human life when practiced with reverence.  "Without reverence, rituals are empty" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;19).  Ceremony and ritual are found at home, in meetings, in voting, and in religion and these acts provide the context for feeling reverence.  But often these situations are so common the emotion reverence disappears from human consciousness. "Ritual and reverence in common life are so familiar that we scarcely notice them until they are gone" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;35).  Woodruff argues that, "Reverence, ceremony and respect do not disappear, they cannot disappear from a functioning society" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;36).  He states that "What we are losing is not reverence, but the idea of reverence" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;36).  It is his hope that the importance of reverence will be recognized in society again and that this recognition will better humanity. He proposes to "Restore the idea of reverence to its proper place in ethical and political thought" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;38).

Woodruff understands true reverence to be for things beyond human control.  "The object of reverence is the ideal of unity, because that transcends politics altogether" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;28).  Thus reverence focuses on an ideal that transcends the scope of humankind.  This ideal can vary from God, to unity, to anything else that transcends human capacity.  "Reverence sets a higher value on the truth than on any human product that is supposed to have captured the truth" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;39). He goes on to say that, "The principal object of reverence is Something that reminds us of human limitations" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;65).  Reverence therefore is related to truth and the recognition that mankind cannot acquire absolute truth and that human life is finite.

Woodruff describes how reverence is often activated through [[music]].  Woodruff claims that "Reverence cannot be expressed in a creed; its most apt expression is in music" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;123).  He gives the analogy of a quartet of varying skill levels playing a piece by [[Mozart]].  They embody reverence because: "(1) The musicians have been engaged, more or less harmoniously, on a project as a group; (2) their project involved ceremony; (3) they have felt themselves largely without ego; (4) they have felt themselves to be part of a clearly defined hierarchy that was painless for all of them; and (5) they have achieved in the end a shared feeling of inarticulate awe" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;48-49).  This coincides with his belief that "Art speaks the language of reverence better than philosophy does, and speak(s) it to the reverence that is already in the town" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;25).  By "in the town" Woodruff is referring to the recognition of reverence that is already present.

"In the presence of death we expect ourselves and others to be reverent; the expectation feels natural, and yet the ceremonies through which we express reverence at such times take very different forms in different cultures" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;50).  In his conversation on funerals as times of reverence he makes the point that reverence transcends faith and that it is constant throughout human history even when religions change (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;54.).  "You need not believe in God to be reverent, but to develop an occasion for reverence you must share a culture with others, and this must support a degree of ceremony" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;50).  Reverence is not dependent on religion, but true religious experience is dependent on the emotion reverence.

Paul Woodruff builds his case on reverence by analyzing the historical significance of reverence as a virtue.  In Ancient Greek and Chinese civilizations, "Both cultures celebrate reverence in the belief that it is reverence above all that maintains social order and harmony" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;60).  For the Greeks reverence was rooted in [[mythology]]. "[[Protagoras]] invented a myth in which the highest god gave reverence and justice to human beings as means for the survival of society" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;57).  This foundation was critical because "Emotions affect action; they are motivators" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;62).  Reverence in classical Greek society then motivated the populous to act rightly and be humble to improve society.  "We feel awe for what we believe is above us all as human beings, and this feeling helps us to avoid treating other human beings with contempt" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;63).

Woodruff uses the Greek heroes and Athenian tragedies to illustrate his conception of reverence.  He uses the story of [[Croesus]] by [[Herodotus]] to help shape an understanding of reverence that includes respect for those lower in hierarchical status.  "A reverent soul listens to other people even when they are inferior; that is a large part of remembering that you are human together with them" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;83).  He also illustrates reverence with the [[Iliad]], [[Antigone]], [[Pentheus]], [[Pericles]], [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], [[Oedipus]], and the [[Odyssey]].  Through these figures he shows that reverence was quite significant in Greek culture.  In Oedipus, Woodruff asserts that, "[[Hubris]] is best understood simply as the opposite of reverence, in action or attitude" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;91).

After building his case with a look at classical Greek culture he looks at classical Chinese [[Confucian]] society.   "[[Filial piety]] expresses reverence within the family" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;103).  The most important part of his connection between reverence and the Chinese is his understanding of [[Li (Confucian)|li]].  "Li refers also to civility or reverence" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;105).  One interesting connection between Greek and Chinese societies is that, "Both conceptions of reverence blossom with the passing away of polytheism and the rise of agnosticism.  Reverence survives and flourishes in these circumstances because it is something that human beings need in order to face the most obvious, common, and inevitable facts of human life – [[family]], [[hierarchy]], and [[death]]" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;110).  Most of his information on reverence in Chinese culture derives from the [[Analects]]. Woodruff believes that a break in tradition is not necessarily irreverent and that [[relativism]] is flawed.  People should be critical of all cultures and forms of reverence (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;155).

=== Abraham Maslow ===

[[Abraham Maslow]] in his significant work, ''Religions, Values, and Peak-Experiences'', deals extensively with reverence.  Reverence is critical in having a peak-experience.  He makes the case that peak-experiences happen for the religious and non-religious alike and that they are critical to having a fulfilling life.  For Maslow the distinction between the secular and the profane is unfortunate.  Maslow points out that, "Religionizing only one part of life secularizes the rest of it".&lt;ref name="MAH"&gt;Maslow, A. H. (1964). Religions, values, and peak-experiences, . Columbus: Ohio State University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Maslow contends that religion seeks to make the emotion reverence possible through ritual, but that the familiarity of it often negates any reverent feelings.&lt;ref name="MAH"/&gt;  In defining peak-experiences Maslow states that, "Such emotions as wonder, awe, reverence, humility, surrender, and even worship before the greatness of the experience are often reported".&lt;ref name="MAH"/&gt;  Reverence therefore is a key ingredient in the peak-experiences that make life worth living and make mankind feel fully human.

=== Albert Schweitzer ===

[[Albert Schweitzer]], winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and holder of four PhD degrees, sought for years for the basis of a new worldview. One day, while in a boat on the river in Gabon, it struck him with great force and clarity: "Reverence for life" (In German: Ehrfurcht vor dem Leben).

== Empirical Studies ==

=== Reverence and Patient Recovery ===
Empirical studies on reverence are scarce.  However, one intriguing study on reverence is, "Prayer and reverence in naturalistic, aesthetic, and socio-moral contexts predicted fewer complications following coronary artery bypass," conducted by Ai ''et al.'' (2009).&lt;ref name="AAL et al."&gt;Ai, A. L., Wink, P., Tice, T. N., Bolling, S. F., &amp; Shearer, M. (2009). Prayer and reverence in naturalistic, aesthetic, and socio-moral contexts predicted fewer complications following coronary artery bypass. Journal of Behavioral Medicine, 32(6), 570-581. {{doi|10.1007/s10865-009-9228-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These researchers looked at reverence following a coronary artery bypass.  Ai ''et al.'' (2009) examined a "sense of reverence in religious and secular contexts" by interviewing 177 patients.&lt;ref name="AAL et al."/&gt;  Specifically they were investigating the faith-health relationship and seeking to find if religious forms of reverence practiced through faith and prayer yielded similar results to secular forms of reverence in patient recovery.  Ai ''et al.'' (2009)state that, "Because reverence includes an affective as well as a cognitive component, we see it as a form of positive feeling/emotion associated with injection of the sacred into various worldviews".&lt;ref name="AAL et al."/&gt;  These positive emotions were believed to help in patient recovery.  The first finding of Ai ''et al.'' (2009) was consistent with other research that found "Positive influences of traditional religious involvement on health outcomes".&lt;ref name="AAL et al."/&gt;  The second finding of Ai ''et al.'' (2009) was the "Positive effect of secular reverence on postoperative no-complication".&lt;ref name="AAL et al."/&gt;  From this Ai ''et al.'' (2009) inferred that, "The capacity to sense reverence in significant naturalistic, moralistic, and aesthetic contexts seems to enhance recovery following bypass".&lt;ref name="AAL et al."/&gt;  Strangely, "Religious reverence did not have the same beneficial effect as secular reverence on bypass recovery".&lt;ref name="AAL et al."/&gt;  This inconsistency suggests that more research needs to be done on reverence in patient recovery.

=== Awe ===
Keltner and Haidt’s extensive study on awe focuses on the importance of vastness and accommodation in experiencing awe.  "Vastness refers to anything that is experienced as being much larger that the self".&lt;ref name="KD % HJ 297-314"&gt;Keltner, D., &amp; Haidt, J. (2003). Approaching awe, a moral, spiritual, and aesthetic emotion. Cognition and Emotion, 17(2), 297-314. {{doi|10.1080/02699930302297}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accommodation refers to the "Process of adjusting mental structures that cannot assimilate a new experience".&lt;ref name="KD % HJ 297-314"/&gt;  Their research on awe, which is a part of reverence, and how it is experienced through moral, spiritual, and aesthetic means, sheds light on the greater understanding of reverence.  Their study also consists of a comprehensive summary on what has been "Written about awe in religion, philosophy, sociology, and psychology" and their own addition of "Related states such as admiration, elevation, and the epiphanic experience".&lt;ref name="KD % HJ 297-314"/&gt;

Haidt (2000) &lt;ref&gt;Haidt, J. (2000). The positive emotion of elevation. Prevention and Treatment, 3 Article 3. p 287. Available online at: http://journals.apa.org/prevention/volume3/pre0030003c.html&lt;/ref&gt; notes that since Maslow (1964) &lt;ref name="MAH"/&gt; studied the changes that [[actualizing]] experiences can bring about in people's identities and in their [[moral]] and [[spirituality|spiritual]] lives, little [[empirical research]] has been done to examine the peak experiences and moral transformations associated with positive moral emotions such as [[gratitude]], [[elevation]], [[awe]], admiration, and reverence.  Haidt’s own work in these areas suggests that potent feelings of reverence may be associated with the peak experiences accompanying moral transformations, where, "Powerful moments of elevation sometimes seem to push a mental ‘reset button,’ wiping out feelings of [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] and replacing them with feelings of [[hope]], [[love]], and [[optimism]], and a sense of moral inspiration." &lt;ref&gt;Haidt, J. (2000), p 287&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art and Mortality ===
Great artists in the creation of their art sometimes give concrete form to the culturally derived [[beliefs]], [[values]], and group identities that provide meaning and purpose to [[existence]]. Moreover, reverence for artwork that instantiates these central aspects of [[culture]] can provide a means of buffering the [[existential]] [[anxiety]] that follows from reminders of the inevitability of human mortality.&lt;ref&gt;Landau, M. J., Sullivan, D., &amp; Solomon, S. (2010) On graves and graven images: A terror management analysis of the psychological functions of art. European Review of Social psychology, 21, 114-154&lt;/ref&gt;  Across history, cultures have revered art as a "forum for representing in an enduring medium those individuals who are held up as embodiments of [[virtue]] and lasting significance." &lt;ref&gt;Landau et al. (2010), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transpersonal Reverence ===
Thomas and Schlutsmeyer in, "A Place for the Aesthetic in Experiential Personal Construct Psychology," look at reverence through the lens of experiential personal construct psychology (EPCP).   Leitner &amp; Pfenninger, in 1994, theorized this form of psychology in "Sociality and optimal functioning."  Under this umbrella of psychology, "Reverence felt in meaningful interpersonal connectedness is one starting point for the development of a larger sense of connection with the world and the many others (human and nonhuman) in it".&lt;ref name="TJC &amp; SMW"&gt;Thomas, J. C., &amp; Schlutsmeyer, M. W. (2004). A place for the aesthetic in experiential personal construct psychology. Journal of Constructivist Psychology, 17(4), 313-335. {{doi|10.1080/10720530490483239}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is referred to as transpersonal reverence.
Thomas and Schlutsmeyer make the case for reverence in therapy: "In EPCP, reverence, as we stated earlier, is a goal of therapy, a sign of optimal functioning".&lt;ref name="TJC &amp; SMW"/&gt;  The therapist must revere the patient and the patient must learn to revere others and themselves in order for the therapy to be effective.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11668">'''Signed zero''' is [[zero]] with an associated [[Plus and minus signs|sign]]. In ordinary arithmetic, the number 0 does not have a sign, so that −0, +0 and 0 are identical. However, in [[computing]], some number representations allow for the existence of two zeros, often denoted by '''−0''' ('''negative zero''') and '''+0''' ('''positive zero'''), regarded as equal by the numerical comparison operations but with possible different behaviors in particular operations. This occurs in the ''sign and magnitude'' and ''ones' complement'' [[signed number representation]]s for integers, and in most [[floating-point number]] representations. The number 0 is usually encoded as +0, but can be represented by either +0 or −0.

The [[IEEE 754]] standard for floating-point arithmetic (presently used by most computers and programming languages that support floating point numbers) requires both +0 and −0. Real arithmetic with signed zeros can be considered a variant of the [[extended real number line]] such that 1/−0 = −[[infinity|∞]] and 1/+0 = +∞; [[Division (mathematics)|division]] is only [[Indeterminate form|undefined]] for [[Plus-minus sign|±]]0/±0 and ±∞/±∞.

Negatively signed zero echoes the [[mathematical analysis]] concept of approaching 0 from below as a [[one-sided limit]], which may be denoted by ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0−, or ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;↑0.  The notation "−0" may be used informally to denote a small negative number that has been [[rounding|rounded]] to zero.  The concept of negative zero also has some theoretical applications in [[statistical mechanics]] and other disciplines.

It is claimed that the inclusion of signed zero in IEEE&amp;nbsp;754 makes it much easier to achieve numerical accuracy in some critical problems,&lt;ref&gt;[[William Kahan]], "Branch Cuts for Complex Elementary Functions, or Much Ado About Nothing's Sign Bit", in [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=59678 ''The State of the Art in Numerical Analysis''] (eds. Iserles and Powell), Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular when computing with [[complex number|complex]] elementary functions.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Kahan]], [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/Math185/Derivative.pdf Derivatives in the Complex z-plane], p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the concept of signed zero runs contrary to the general assumption made in most mathematical fields that negative zero is the same thing as zero.  Representations that allow negative zero can be a source of errors in programs, if software developers do not take into account that while the two zero representations behave as equal under numeric comparisons, they yield different results in some operations.

==Representations==
The widely used [[two's complement]] encoding does not allow a negative zero.  In a 1+7-bit [[signed magnitude|sign-and-magnitude]] representation for integers, negative zero is represented by the bit string {{gaps|1000|0000}}. In an 8-bit [[one's complement]] representation, negative zero is represented by the bit string {{gaps|1111|1111}}. In all three encodings, positive zero is represented by {{gaps|0000|0000}}.

[[Image:IEEE 754 Single Negative Zero.svg|thumb|right|400px|Negative zero by IEEE 754 representation in [[binary32]] ]]
In [[IEEE floating-point standard|IEEE 754]] binary floating point numbers, zero values are represented by the biased exponent and [[significand]] both being zero. Negative zero has the sign bit set to one.  One may obtain negative zero as the result of certain computations, for instance as the result of [[arithmetic underflow]] on a negative number, or &lt;code&gt;−1.0×0.0&lt;/code&gt;, or simply as &lt;code&gt;−0.0&lt;/code&gt;.

In [[IEEE 754-2008|IEEE 754]] decimal floating point encoding, a negative zero is represented by an exponent being any valid exponent in the range for the encoding, the true significand being zero, and the sign bit being one.

==Properties and handling==
The IEEE 754 floating point standard specifies the behavior of positive zero and negative zero under various operations.  The outcome may depend on the current [[floating point#Rounding modes|IEEE rounding mode]] settings.

===Notation===
In systems that include both signed and unsigned zeros, the notation &lt;math&gt;0^+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0^-&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes used for signed zeros.

===Arithmetic===
Addition and multiplication are commutative, but there are some special rules that have to be followed, which mean the usual mathematical rules for algebraic simplification may not apply. The &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; sign below shows the signed result of the operations.

The usual rule for signs is always followed when multiplying or dividing:

* &lt;math&gt;\frac{-0}{ \left| x \right| } = -0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; different from 0)
* &lt;math&gt;(-0) \cdot (-0) = +0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

There are special rules for adding or subtracting signed zero:

* &lt;math&gt;x + (\pm 0) = x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; different from 0)
* &lt;math&gt;(-0) + (-0) = (-0) - (+0) = -0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(+0) + (+0) = (+0) - (-0) = +0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x - x = x + (-x) = +0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (for any finite &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, −0 when rounding toward negative)

Because of negative zero (and also when the rounding mode is upward or downward), the expressions {{nowrap|−(''x'' − ''y'')}} and {{nowrap|(−''x'') − (−''y'')}}, for floating-point variables ''x'' and ''y'', cannot be replaced by {{nowrap|''y'' − ''x''}}. However {{nowrap|(−0) + ''x''}} can be replaced by ''x'' with rounding to nearest (except when ''x'' can be a [[NaN#Signaling NaN|signaling NaN]]).

Some other special rules:

* &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-0} = -0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speleotrove.com/decimal/daops.html#refsqrt|title=Decimal Arithmetic: Arithmetic operations{{snd}}square-root|first=Mike|last=Cowlishaw|authorlink=Mike Cowlishaw|date=7 April 2009|publisher=speleotrove.com ([[IBM Corporation]])|accessdate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{-0}{-\infty} = +0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;  (follows the sign rule for division)
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{\left|x\right|}{-0} = -\infty\,\!&lt;/math&gt;  (for non-zero &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, follows the sign rule for division)
* &lt;math&gt;{\pm 0} \times {\pm \infty} = \mbox{NaN}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; ([[Not a Number]] or interrupt for [[indeterminate form]])
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pm 0}{\pm 0} = \mbox{NaN}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Division of a non-zero number by zero sets the divide by zero [[flag (computing)|flag]], and an operation producing a NaN sets the invalid operation flag. An [[exception handling|exception handler]] is called if enabled for the corresponding flag.

===Comparisons===
According to the IEEE&amp;nbsp;754 standard, negative zero and positive zero should compare as equal with the usual (numerical) comparison operators, like the &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; operators of [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Java programming language|Java]].  In those languages, special programming tricks may be needed to distinguish the two values:

* [[Type punning]] the number to an integer type, so as to look at the sign bit in the bit pattern;
* using the ISO C &lt;code&gt;copysign()&lt;/code&gt; function (IEEE&amp;nbsp;754 copySign operation) to copy the sign of the zero to some non-zero number;
* using the ISO C &lt;code&gt;signbit()&lt;/code&gt; macro (IEEE&amp;nbsp;754 isSignMinus operation) that returns whether the sign bit of a number is set;
* taking the reciprocal of the zero to obtain either 1/(+0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+∞ or 1/(−0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−∞ (if the [[division by zero]] exception is not trapped).

Note: [[Cast (computer programming)|Casting]] to integral type will not always work, especially on two's complement systems.

However, some programming languages may provide alternative comparison operators that do distinguish the two zeros. This is the case, for example, of the &lt;tt&gt;equals&lt;/tt&gt; method in Java's &lt;code&gt;Double&lt;/code&gt; wrapper class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Double.html#equals%28java.lang.Object%29 http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Double.html#equals(java.lang.Object)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific uses==
Informally, one may use the notation "−0" for a negative value that was rounded to zero.  This notation may be useful when a negative sign is significant; for example, when tabulating [[Celsius]] temperatures, where a negative sign means ''below freezing''.

In statistical mechanics, one sometimes uses [[negative temperature]]s to describe systems with [[population inversion]], which can be considered to have a temperature greater than positive infinity, because the coefficient of energy in the population distribution function is &amp;minus;1/Temperature. In this context, a temperature of &amp;minus;0 is a (theoretical) temperature larger than any other negative temperature, corresponding to the (theoretical) maximum conceivable extent of population inversion, the opposite extreme to +0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Charles Kittel|Kittel, Charles]] and [[Herbert Kroemer]] | title=Thermal Physics (2nd ed.) | publisher=W.

'''Speech-Language Pathology''' is a field of expertise practiced by a [[clinician]] known as a '''speech-language pathologist''' ('''SLP'''), also sometimes referred to as a '''speech and language therapist'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brady|first=Marian C.|last2=Kelly|first2=Helen|last3=Godwin|first3=Jon|last4=Enderby|first4=Pam|last5=Campbell|first5=Pauline|date=2016-06-01|title=Speech and language therapy for aphasia following stroke|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=6|pages=CD000425|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000425.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=27245310|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a '''speech therapist'''. SLP is considered a "related health profession" along with [[audiology]], optometry, [[occupational therapy]], [[Psychologist|clinical psychology]], [[physical therapy]], and others. The field of SLP is distinguished from other "related health professions" SLPs are legally permitted to conclude to certain disorders which fall within their scope of practice. SLPs specialize in the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of [[communication disorders]] ([[Speech disorder|speech disorders]] and [[Language disorder|language disorders]]), cognitive-communication disorders, [[voice disorders]], and [[dysphagia|swallowing disorders]]. SLPs also play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of [[autism spectrum disorder]] (often in a team with pediatricians and psychologists).

A common misconception is that speech-language pathology is restricted to adjusting a speaker's speech sound articulation to meet the expected normal pronunciation, such as helping English speaking individuals enunciate the traditionally difficult "r". SLPs can also often help people who stutter to speak more fluently. Articulation and fluency are only two facets of the work of an SLP, however. In fact, speech-language pathology is concerned with a broad scope of speech, language, swallowing, and voice issues involved in communication,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/policy/SP2016-00343/#Service_Delivery_Areas|title=Scope of practice in speech-language pathology [Service Delivery Areas]|last=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association|first=|date=2016|website=www.asha.org/policy|publisher=|access-date=September 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of which include:

* Word-finding and other semantic issues, either as a result of a specific language impairment (SLI) such as a language delay or as a secondary characteristic of a more general issue such as dementia.
* Social communication difficulties involving how people communicate or interact with others (pragmatics).
* Structural language impairments, including difficulties creating sentences that are grammatical (syntax) and modifying word meaning (morphology).
* Literacy impairments (reading and writing) related to the letter-to-sound relationship (phonics), the word-to-meaning relationship (semantics), and understanding the ideas presented in a text (reading comprehension).
* Voice difficulties, such as a raspy voice, a voice that is too soft, or other voice difficulties that negatively impact a person's social or professional performance.
* Cognitive impairments (''e.g.'', attention, memory, executive function) to the extent that they interfere with communication.

The components of [[speech communication|speech]] production include:
* [[phonation]] (producing sound)
* [[resonance]]
* [[fluency]]
* [[Intonation (linguistics)|Intonation]]
* [[pitch (music)|Pitch]] variance;
* [[Human voice|Voice]] (including [[aeromechanics|aeromechanical]] components of [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]])
The components of [[language]] include:
* [[Phonology]] (manipulating sound according to the rules of a language);
* [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]] (understanding components of words and how they can modify meaning);
* [[Syntax]] (constructing sentences according to the [[grammar|grammatical]] rules of a target language);
* [[Semantics]] (interpreting signs or symbols of communication such as words or signs to construct meaning);
* [[Pragmatics]] (social aspects of communication).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Frances K. | last = Block | author2 = Amie Amiot|author3= Cheryl Deconde Johnson|author4= Gina E.

Swallowing disorders include difficulties in any system of the swallowing process (''i.e.'' oral, pharyngeal, esophageal), as well as functional [[dysphagia]] and [[feeding disorder]]s. Swallowing disorders can occur at any age and can stem from multiple causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/policy/SP2016-00343/|title=Scope of Practice in Speech-Language Pathology|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The profession==
Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) provide a wide range of services, mainly on an individual basis, but also as support for individuals, families, support groups, and providing information for the general public. SLPs work to prevent, assess, diagnose, and treat speech, language, social communication, cognitive-communication, and swallowing disorders in children and adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speech-Language Pathologists|url=http://www.asha.org/Students/Speech-Language-Pathologists/|website=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speech services begin with initial screening for communication and swallowing disorders and continue with assessment and diagnosis, consultation for the provision of advice regarding management, intervention, and treatment, and providing counseling and other follow up services for these disorders. Services are provided in the following areas:
* cognitive aspects of communication (''e.g.'', attention, memory, problem-solving, executive functions).
* speech ([[phonation]], [[Manner of articulation|articulation]], fluency, resonance, and [[human voice|voice]] including aeromechanical components of respiration);
* language ([[phonology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], [[semantics]], and pragmatic/social aspects of communication) including comprehension and expression in oral, written, graphic, and manual modalities; [[language processing]]; preliteracy and language-based literacy skills, phonological awareness.
* swallowing or other upper aerodigestive functions such as infant feeding and aeromechanical events (evaluation of esophageal function is for the purpose of referral to medical professionals);
* voice (hoarseness (dysphonia), poor vocal volume (hypophonia), abnormal (''e.g.'' rough, breathy, strained) vocal quality. Research demonstrates [[voice therapy]] to be especially helpful with certain patient populations; individuals with Parkinson's Disease often develop voice issues as a result of their disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Factor|first1=Stewart|last2=Weiner|first2=William|title=Parkinson's disease: Diagnosis &amp; clinical management : Second edition|date=2008|publisher=Demos Medical Publishing|location=U.S.|isbn=9781933864006|pages=77–83|edition=2nd, rev. and updat;2; ed.).}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* sensory awareness related to communication, swallowing, or other upper aerodigestive functions.

Speech, language, and swallowing disorders result from a variety of causes, such as a stroke,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richards|first1=Emma|title=Communication and swallowing problems after stroke|journal=Nursing and Residential Care|date=June 2012|volume=14|issue=6|pages=282–286|doi=10.12968/nrec.2012.14.6.282}}&lt;/ref&gt; brain injury,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Editors, Nathan D.

===Multi-discipline collaboration===

SLPs collaborate with other health care professionals, often working as part of a multidisciplinary team. They can provide information and referrals to [[audiologist]]s, [[physician]]s, neonatal specialists &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Mathisen, B. A., Carey, L.

London: Jessica Kingsley Publishers.|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781785922206|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[parent]]s as dictated by the individual client's needs.  For example, the treatment for patients with [[cleft lip and palate]], often requires multidisciplinary collaboration. Speech-language pathologists can be very beneficial to help resolve speech problems associated with cleft lip and palate. Research has indicated that children who receive early language intervention are less likely to develop compensatory error patterns later in life, although speech therapy outcomes are usually better when surgical treatment is performed earlier.&lt;ref name="revistaOMF"&gt;

SLPs may also work as part of the support structure in the education system, working in both public and private [[school]]s, [[college]]s, and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/details/default.aspx?id=288 |title=Speech and language therapist - NHS Careers |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some SLPs also work in community health, providing services at prisons and [[youth detention center|young offenders' institutions]] or providing expert testimony in applicable court cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcslt.org/speech_and_language_therapy/what_is_an_slt |title=What is speech and language therapy? }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association's (ASHA's) 2005 approval of the delivery of speech/language services via video conference or telepractice, SLPs in the United States have begun to use this service model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asha.org/telepractice/ |title=ASHA Telepractice Position Statement |publisher=Asha.org |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
SLPs conduct research related to communication sciences and disorders, swallowing disorders, or other upper aerodigestive functions.

===Education and training===
====United States====
In the United States, speech-language pathology is a Master's entry-level [[professional degree]] field. [[Clinicians]] must hold a master's degree in Communicative Disorders/Speech-Language Pathology (''e.g.'' M.A., M.S., or M.Ed.) that is from a university that holds [[regional accreditation]] and from a communication sciences and disorders program that is accredited by the [[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]] (ASHA), the profession's national governing body as well as individual state's governing board. Programs that offer the M.Ed. degree are often housed within a university's [[College of education]], but offer the same education and training as programs with a M.A. or M.S. degree. Beyond the master's degree, some SLPs may choose to earn a clinical doctorate in Speech-Language Pathology (''e.g.'' CScD or SLPD), or a doctoral degree that has a research and/or professional focus (''e.g.'', Ph.D., or Ed.D.). All degrees must be from a university that holds [[regional accreditation]], but only the master's degree is accredited by the [[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]] (ASHA).

All clinicians are required to complete 400 clinical hours (25 observation hours often completed during the undergraduate degree and 375 hours of graduate Clinical Practicum).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/Accreditation-Standards-Graduate-Programs.pdf | title=Standards for Accreditation of Graduate Education Programs in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology | publisher=CAA | date=January 1, 2008 | accessdate=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They must pass multiple [[comprehensive exams]] also called Knowledge and Skills Acquisition (KASA) exams.

After all the above requirements have been met during the SLP's path to earning the graduate degree, SLPs must state licensure and national certification by:
* Passing the National Speech-Language Pathology board exam (Praxis).
* Successfully complete a clinical fellowship year (CFY) as a clinical fellow (CF) under the mentorship of a fully licensed mentor clinician. The CFY is no less than 36 weeks of full-time experience, totaling a minimum of 1260 hours. During the CFY, the CF cannot earn CFY hours unless they work more than 5 hours in a week and cannot earn any CFY hours beyond 35 hours in a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/certification/Clinical-Fellowship.htm|title=Speech-Language Pathology Clinical Fellowship|website=www.asha.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Receive [[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]] (ASHA) Certificate of Clinical Competence (CCC) and full state licensure to practice, following successful completion of clinical fellowship year(CFY).
* States are responsible for licensure of clinicians and other professionals and, as far as the new SLP, these requirements are often similar to that of the CFY. Following the state licensure procedures and national certification requirements are usually done simultaneously.

Maintaining licensure through continuing education:
* To maintain licensure, SLPs are required to participate in periodic earning of Continuing Educational Units (CEU).

Continuing education and training obligations:
* Educate, supervise, and mentor future SLPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cplol.eu/eng/profil_professionnel.html |title=Professional Profile of the Speech and Language Therapist |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Participate in continuing education.
* Educate and provide in-service training to families, caregivers, and other professionals.
* Train, supervise, and manage speech-language pathology assistants (SLPA) and other support personnel.
* Educating and counseling individuals, families, co-workers, educators, and other persons in the community regarding acceptance, adaptation, and decisions about communication and swallowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/docs/html/PI2010-00317.html |title=Roles and Responsibilities of Speech-Language Pathologists in Schools |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional suffix:
* Credentials of a clinical fellow typically read as: MA, MS, or M.Ed, CF-SLP (''e.g.'', Jane Doe, MA, CF-SLP).
* Credentials of a fully licensed SLP commonly read as: MA, MS, or M.Ed, CCC-SLP (''e.g.'', Jane Doe, MA, CCC-SLP), indicating a practitioner's graduate degree and successful completion of the fellowship year/board exams to obtain the "three Cs" the Certification of Clinical Competence, in speech-language pathology.

===Salary information===
Salaries of SLPs depend on a variety of factors including educational background, work experience, and location. The ASHA 2016 Schools Survey revealed that SLPs received a median academic year salary of 62,000, which is a 2% increase from the latest Schools Survey done in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/2016-Schools-Survey-SLP-Salary-Trends.pdf|title= Schools Survey Report: SLP Annual Salary and Hourly Wage Trends 2004–2016 |website=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, ASHA released results for the 2015 SLP Health Care Survey which placed the median salary for SLPs working within the health care industry at $75,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/2015-SLP-Health-Care-Survey-Annual-Salaries.pdf|title=SLP Health Care Survey 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, salaries can range from $47,000–116,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/speech-language-pathologist/salary |title= Speech-Language Pathologist Salary |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= www.usnews.com |publisher= U.S. News |access-date= 8 March 2018 |quote=Speech-language pathologists have seen a spike in pay the past few years.

==Methods of assessment==
For many parents, the decision of whether or not to enroll students into school-based speech therapy or privately practiced therapy is challenging. Speech Pathologists work as part of a team alongside teachers, counselors, social workers and parents when in a school setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://explorehealthcareers.org/career/speech-language-hearing/speech-language-pathologist/|title=Speech-Language Pathologist {{!}} explorehealthcareers.org|website=explorehealthcareers.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because school-based speech therapy is run under state guidelines and funds, the process of assessment and qualification is more strict. To qualify for in-school speech therapy, students must meet the state's criteria on language testing and speech standardization. Due to such requirements, some students may not be assessed in an efficient time frame or their needs may be undermined by criteria. For a private clinic, students are more likely to qualify for therapy because it is a paid service with more availability.  {{details|Speech and language assessment}}

==Clients and patients==
Speech-language pathologists work with clients and patients who may present with a wide range of issues.

===Infants and children===

In the US, some children are eligible to receive speech therapy services, including assessment and lessons through [[speech and language pathology in school settings|the public school system]]. If not, private therapy is readily available through personal lessons with a qualified Speech-Language Pathologist or the growing field of telepractice.&lt;ref&gt;http://asha.org/telepractice/&lt;/ref&gt; Teleconferencing tools such as Skype are being used more commonly as a means to access remote locations in private therapy practice, such as in the geographically diverse south island of New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;http://vocalsaints.co.nz/&lt;/ref&gt; More at-home or combination treatments have become readily available to address specific types of articulation disorders. The use of mobile applications in speech therapy is also growing as an avenue to bring treatment into the home.

In the UK, children are entitled to an assessment by local NHS Speech and Language Therapy teams, usually after referral by health visitors or education settings, but parents are also entitled to request an assessment directly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/pages/helping-your-childs-speech.aspx#close&lt;/ref&gt; If treatment is appropriate, an educational plan will be drawn up. Speech therapists often play a role in multi-disciplinary teams where a child has speech delay or disorder as part of a wider health condition.

'''Stereopsis recovery''', also '''recovery from stereoblindness''', is the phenomenon of a [[stereoblind]] person gaining partial or full ability of stereo vision ([[stereopsis]]).

Recovering stereo vision as far as possible has long been established as an approach to the therapeutic treatment of stereoblind patients. Treatment aims to recover stereo vision in very young children, as well as in patients who had acquired but lost their ability for stereopsis due to a medical condition. In contrast, this aim has normally not been present in the treatment of those who missed out on learning stereopsis during their first few years of life. In fact, the acquisition of binocular and stereo vision was long thought to be impossible unless the person acquired this skill during a [[critical period]] in infancy and early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: {{cite journal|author=Uri Polat|title=Restoration of underdeveloped cortical functions: Evidence from treatment of adult amblyopia|journal=Restorative Neurology and Neuroscience|volume=26|number=4-5|year=2008|pages=413–424}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis normally went unquestioned and has formed the basis for the therapeutic approaches to binocular disorders for decades. It has been put in doubt in recent years. In particular since studies on stereopsis recovery began to appear in scientific journals and it became publicly known that neuroscientist [[Susan R. Barry]] achieved stereopsis well into adulthood, that assumption is in retrospect considered to have held the status of a scientific [[dogma]].&lt;ref name="barry-2009"&gt;Susan R. Barry (2009) ''Fixing My Gaze: A Scientist's Journey into Seeing in Three Dimensions''. New York: Basic Books. {{ISBN|978-0-465-02073-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[…] The book's main contribution, however, is exposing the wrong-headed dogma that acuity and binocular vision can be restored only during a critical developmental period." —''New England Journal of Medicine''. (See introductory pages of: Susan R. Barry (2009) ''Fixing My Gaze.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[…] Part memoir and part science, ''Fixing My Gaze'' is a fitting tribute to the determination of a patient and her optometrist in challenging conventional wisdom and dogma." —''Journal of Behavioral Optometry''. (See introductory pages of: Susan R. Barry (2009) ''Fixing My Gaze.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="astle-etal-2011a"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Andrew T. Astle|author2=Paul V. McGraw|author3=Ben S. Webb|title=Myth exploded: Recovery of stereo acuity in adults with amblyopia|journal=BMJ Case Reports|year=2011|doi=10.1136/bcr.07.2010.3143|pmid=22707543|pmc=3062842|volume=2011|issue=feb21 2|pages=bcr0720103143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very recently, there has been a rise in scientific investigations into stereopsis recovery in adults and youths who have had no stereo vision before. While it has now been shown that an adult ''may'' gain stereopsis, it is currently not yet possible to predict how likely a stereoblind person is to do so, nor is there general agreement on the best therapeutic procedure. Also the possible implications for the treatment of children with [[infantile esotropia]] are still under study.

In cases of acquired strabismus with [[double vision]] (diplopia), it is long-established state of the art to aim at curing the double vision and at the same time recovering a patient's earlier ability for stereo vision. For example, a patient may have had full stereo vision but later had diplopia due to a medical condition, losing stereo vision. In this case, medical interventions, including [[vision therapy]] and [[strabismus surgery]], may remove the double vision and recover the stereo vision which had temporarily been absent in the patient.

Also when children with congenital (infantile) strabismus (e.g. [[infantile esotropia]]) receive strabismus surgery within the first few years or two of their life, this goes along with the hope that they may yet develop their full potential for [[binocular vision]] including stereopsis.

In contrast, in a case where a child's eyes are straightened surgically after the age of about five or six years and the child had no opportunity to develop stereo vision in early childhood, normally the clinical expectation is that this intervention will lead to cosmetic improvements but not to stereo vision. Conventionally, no follow-up for stereopsis was performed in such cases.

For instance, one author summarized the accepted scientific view of the time with the words: "Stereopsis will never be obtained unless [[amblyopia]] is treated, the eyes are aligned, and binocular fusion and function are achieved before the critical period for stereopsis ends. Clinical data suggest that this occurs before 24 months of age,[…] but we do not know exactly when it occurs, because crucial pieces of basic science information are missing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nigel W. Daw|title=Critical Periods and Amblyopia|journal=Archives of Ophthalmology: Mechanisms of Ophthalmic Disease|date=April 1998|volume=116|number=4|pages=502–505|doi=10.1001/archopht.116.4.502}}&lt;/ref&gt; For purposes of illustration, reference is made to a book of doctors' handouts for patients, written for the general public and published in 2002, which summarizes the limitations in the terms in which they, at the time, were fully accepted as [[Medical consensus|medical state of the art]] as follows: "If an adult has a childhood strabismus that was never treated, it is too late to improve any amblyopia or [[depth perception]], so the goal may be simply cosmetic – to make the eyes appear to be properly aligned – though sometimes treatment does enlarge the extent of side vision."&lt;ref&gt;Melvin L. Rubin, Lawrence A. Winograd: ''Taking Care of Your Eyes: A Collection of the Patient Information Handouts Used by America's Leading Eye Doctors'', Triad Records (September 2002), {{ISBN|978-0937404614}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has only been accepted very recently that the therapeutic approach was based on an unquestioned notion that has, since, been referred to as "myth" or "dogma".&lt;ref name="astle-etal-2011a"/&gt;

Recently, however, stereopsis recovery is known to have occurred in a number of adults. While this has in some cases occurred after visual exercises or spontaneous visual experiences, recently also the medical community's view of strabismus surgery has become more optimistic with regard to outcomes in terms of binocular function and possibly stereopsis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A. Dickmann|author2=S. Aliberti|author3=M.T. Rebecchi|author4=I. Aprile|author5=A. Salerni|author6=S. Petroni|author7=R. Parrilla|author8=V. Perrotta|author9=E. Di Nardo|author10=E.

:"The majority of adults will experience some improvement in binocular function after strabismus surgery even if the strabismus has been longstanding. Most commonly this takes the form of an expansion of binocular visual fields; however, some patients may also regain stereopsis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The efficacy of strabismus surgery in adults: a review for primary care physicians|journal=Postgraduate Medical Journal|date=April 2011|volume=87|number=1026|pages=269–273|doi=10.1136/pgmj.2010.108670}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Scientific investigations on residual [[neuroplasticity|neural plasticity]] in adulthood now also include studies on the recovery of stereopsis. Now it is a matter of active scientific investigation under which conditions and to which degree binocular fusion and stereo vision can be acquired in adulthood, especially if the person is not known to have had any preceding experience of stereo vision, and how outcomes may depend on the patient's history of therapeutic interventions.

== Examples and case studies ==
[[File:9.13.09OliverSacksByLuigiNovi.jpg|thumb|[[Oliver Sacks]] was the first to make the story of Susan Barry, whom he nicknamed "Stereo Sue", known to the general public.]]
Stereopsis recovery has been reported to have occurred in a few adults as a result of either medical treatments including [[strabismus surgery]] and [[vision therapy]], or spontaneously after a stereoscopic [[3D cinema]] experience.

=== Personal reports in ''Fixing my Gaze'' ===
The most renowned case of regained stereopsis is that of neuroscientist [[Susan R. Barry]], who had had alternating [[infantile esotropia]] with [[diplopia]], but no amblyopia, underwent three [[Strabismus surgery|surgical corrections]] in childhood without achieving binocular vision at the time, and recovered from stereoblindness in adult age after [[vision therapy]] with optometrist Theresa Ruggiero. Barry's case has been reported on by neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]].&lt;ref name="sacks-2006"&gt;{{cite news|author=Oliver Sacks|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/06/19/060619fa_fact_sacks |title=Stereo Sue: Why two eyes are better than one|journal=The New Yorker|date=19 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[David H. Hubel]], winner of the 1981 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] with [[Torsten Wiesel]] for their discoveries concerning information processing in the visual system, commented positively on her case.&lt;ref name="barry-2009-p138-140"&gt;Susan R. Barry: ''Fixing my Gaze'', 2009, pages 138-140&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Barry published a book ''Fixing My Gaze: A Scientist's Journey into Seeing in Three Dimensions'', reporting on her own and several other cases of stereopsis recovery.&lt;ref name="barry-2009"/&gt;

In her book ''Fixing my Gaze'', Susan Barry gives a detailed description of her surprise, elation and subsequent experiences when her stereo vision suddenly set in.

Hubel wrote of her book:
{{Quote box|“It has been widely thought that an adult, cross-eyed since infancy, could never acquire stereovision, but to everyone's surprise, Barry succeeded. In ''Fixing my Gaze'', she describes how wonderful it was to have, step-by-step, this new 3D world revealed to her. And as a neurobiologist she is able to discuss the science as an expert, in simple language.”|source=David H. Hubel, winner of the Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine, John Franklin Enders Professor of Neurobiology, Emeritus, Harvard Medical School.&lt;ref name="barry-2009"/&gt;}}

Her book includes reports of further persons who have had similar experiences with stereopsis recovery. Barry cites the personal experiences of several persons,&lt;!--Comment: the names ofpatients and their optometrists are purposely not listed here in Wikipedia out of respect of their privacy as ordinary people who may not wish to have their names retrieved by search engines, and the names make no difference to the message here--&gt; including a man who was an artist and described his experience of seeing with stereopsis as "that he could see one hundred more times [[negative space]]",&lt;ref&gt;Susan R. Barry: ''Fixing my Gaze'', pages 123&lt;/ref&gt; a woman who had been amblyopic before seeing in 3D described how empty space now "looks and feels palpable, tangible—alive!",&lt;ref&gt;Susan R. Barry: ''Fixing my Gaze'', pages 123-124&lt;/ref&gt; a woman who had been strabismic since age two and saw in 3D after taking vision therapy and stated that "The coolest thing is the feeling you get being “in the dimension”",&lt;ref&gt;Susan R. Barry: ''Fixing my Gaze'', page 124&lt;/ref&gt; a woman who felt quite alarmed at the experience of suddenly seeing roadside trees and signs [[looming]] towards her,&lt;ref&gt;Susan R. Barry: ''Fixing my Gaze'', pages 128-129&lt;/ref&gt; and two women who experienced an abrupt onset of stereo vision with a wide-angled view of the world, the first stating: "I was able to take in so much more of the room than I did before" and the second: "It was very dramatic as my [[peripheral vision]] suddenly filled in on both sides".&lt;ref name="barry-p129-131"&gt;Susan R. Barry: ''Fixing my Gaze'', pages 129-131&lt;/ref&gt;

Common to Barry and at least one person on whom she had reported is the finding that also their [[Visual space|mental representation of space]] changed after having acquired stereo vision: that even with one eye closed the feeling is to see "more" than seeing with one eye closed before recovering stereopsis.&lt;ref name="barry-p129-131"/&gt;

[[File:RealD glasses.jpg|thumb|Although stereoblind, Bridgeman used polarized glasses in a 3D cinema and could suddenly see in 3D.]]

=== Further cases in the media ===
Apart from Barry, another formerly stereoblind adult whose acquired ability for stereopsis has received media attention is neuroscientist Bruce Bridgeman, professor of psychology and psychobiology at [[University of California Santa Cruz]], who had grown up nearly stereoblind and acquired stereo vision spontaneously in 2012 at the age of 67, when watching the 3D movie [[Hugo (movie)|Hugo]] with polarizing 3D glasses. The scene suddenly appeared to him in depth, and the ability to see the world in stereo stayed with him also after leaving the cinema.&lt;ref&gt;Morgen Peck: [http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120719-awoken-from-a-2d-world/all How a movie changed one man’s vision forever], BBC Future, 19 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry B.

== Recent scientific investigations ==
There is a growing recent body of scientific literature on investigations into the recovery of stereopsis in adults which started to appear shortly before Oliver Sacks' ''The New Yorker'' publication&lt;ref name="sacks-2006"/&gt; drew public attention to Barry's discovery. A number of scientific publications have systematically assessed patients' post-surgical stereopsis,&lt;ref name="kim-etal-2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=S. Kim|author2=S.T. Yi|author3=Y.A.

=== Post-surgical stereopsis ===
Certain conditions are known to be a prerequisite for stereo vision, for instance, that the amount of horizontal deviation, if any is present, needs to be small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=David A.

Holmes|title=Maximum angle of horizontal strabismus consistent with true stereopsis|journal=Journal of American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus|volume=8|number=1|date=February 2004|pages=28–34|doi=10.1016/j.jaapos.2003.08.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In several studies it has been recognized that surgery to correct strabismus can have the effect of improving binocular function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=John D.

Among the investigations into post-surgical stereopsis is a publication of 2005 that reported on a total of 43 adults over 18 years of age who had surgical correction after having lived with from constant-horizontal strabismus for more than 10 years with no previous surgery or stereopsis, with visual acuity of 20/40 or more also in the deviating eye; in this group, stereopsis was present in 80% of exotropes and 31% of esotropes, with the recovery of stereopsis and stereoacuity being uncorrelated to the number of years the deviation had persisted.&lt;ref name="kim-etal-2005"/&gt; A study that was published 2006 included, aside an extensive review of investigations on stereopsis recovery of the last decades, a re-evaluation of all those patients who had had congenital or early-onset strabismus with a large constant horizontal divergence and had undergone strabismus surgery in the years 1997–1999 in a given clinic, excluding those who had a history of neurologic or systemic diseases or with organic retinal diseases. Among the resulting 36 subjects aged 6–30 years, many had regained binocular vision (56% according to an evaluation with [[Bagolini Striated Glasses Test|Bagolini striated glasses]], 39% with Titmus test, 33% with [[Worth 4 dot test|Worth 4-dot]] test, and 22% with Random dot E test) and 57% had stereoacuity of 200 [[Second of arc|sec of arc]] of better, leading to the conclusion that some degrees of stereopsis can be achieved even in cases of infantile or early-childhood strabism.&lt;ref name="gharabaghi-azadeh-2006"/&gt; Another study  found that some chronically strabismic adults with good vision could recover fusion and stereopsis by means of surgical alignment.&lt;ref name="fatima-etal-2009"/&gt;

In contrast, in a study in which a group of 17 adults and older children of at least 8 years of age, all of whom received strabismus surgery and post-operative evaluation after long-standing untreated [[infantile esotropia]], most showed binocular fusion when tested with Bagolini lenses and an increased [[visual field]], but none demonstrated stereo fusion or stereopsis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Anthony David Neil Murray|author2=Jane Orpen|author3=Carolyn Calcutt|title=Changes in the functional binocular status of older children and adults with previously untreated infantile esotropia following late surgical realignment|journal=Journal of American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus|volume=11|number=2|date=April 2007|pages=125–130|doi=10.1016/j.jaapos.2006.10.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stereoacuity]] is limited by the [[visual acuity]] of the eyes, and in particular by the visual acuity of the weaker eye. That is, the more a patient's vision of any one of the two eyes is degraded compared to the 20/20 vision standard, the lower are the prospects of improving or re-gaining stereo vision, unless visual acuity itself were improved by other means. Strabismus surgery itself does not improve visual acuity.

=== Stereopsis following training procedures ===
[[Eye exercises|Orthoptic exercises]] have proven to be effective for reducing symptoms in patients with convergence insufficiency and decompensating [[exophoria]] by improving the near-point convergence of the eyes that is necessary for binocular fusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=S. Aziz|author2=M. Cleary|author3=H.K. Stewart|author4=C.R. Weir|title=Are orthoptic exercises an effective treatment for convergence and fusion deficiencies?|journal=Strabismus|date=December 2006|volume=14|number=|pages=183–189|pmid=17162439|doi=10.1080/09273970601026185|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments on monkeys, published 2007, revealed improvements in stereoacuity in monkeys who, after having been raised with binocular deptivation through prisms for the first two years, were exposed to extensive psychophysical training. Their stereo vision recovered in part, but remained far more limited than that of normally raised monkeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=C. Nakatsuka|title=Effects of Perceptual Learning on Local Stereopsis and Neuronal Responses of V1 and V2 in Prism-Reared Monkeys|journal=AJP: Journal of Neurophysiology|date=April 2007|volume=97|number=4|pages=2612–2626|doi=10.1152/jn.01001.2006|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] have stated that [[perceptual learning]] appears to play an important role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dennis M. Levi|title=Perceptual learning in adults with amblyopia: A reevaluation of critical periods in human vision|journal=Developmental Psychobiology|volume=46|number=3|pages=222–232|date=April 2005|doi=10.1002/dev.20050}}&lt;/ref&gt; One investigation, published 2011, reported on a study on human stereopsis recovery using [[perceptual learning]] which was inspired by Barry's work. In this study, a small number of stereoblind subjects who had initially been stereoblind or stereoanomalous recovered stereopsis using perceptual learning exercises. Alongside the scientific assessment of the extent of recovery, also the subjective outcomes are described: "After achieving stereopsis, our observers reported that the depth “popped out,” which they found very helpful and joyful in their everyday life. The anisometropic observer GD noticed “a surge in depth” one day when shopping in a supermarket. While playing table tennis, she feels that she is able to track a ping-pong ball more accurately and therefore can play better. Strabismic observer AB is more confident now when walking down stairs because she can judge the depth of the steps better. Strabismics AB, DP, and LR, are able to enjoy 3D movies for the first time, and strabismic GJ finds it easier to catch a fly ball while playing baseball."&lt;ref name="ding-levi-2011a"/&gt; In a follow-up study, the authors of this study pointed out that the stereopsis that was recovered following perceptual learning was more limited in resolution and precision compared to normal subjects' stereopsis.&lt;ref name="ding-levi-2011b"/&gt; [[Dennis M.

[[File:Emacs Tetris vector based detail.svg|upright|thumb|[[Tetris]] is a popular video game from the 1980s. A modified version of the game (not shown here) has been used for dichoptic training.]]
There have been several attempts to make use of modern technology for enhanced binocular eye training, in particular for treating [[amblyopia]] and [[Suppression (eye)|interocular suppression]]. In some cases these modern techniques have improved patients' stereoacuity. Very early technology-enhanced vision therapy efforts have included the [[cheiroscope]], which is a [[haploscope]] in which left- and or right-eye images can be blended into view over a drawing pad, and the subject may be given a task such as to reproduce a line image presented to one eye. However, historically these approaches were not developed much further and they were not put to widespread use. Recent systems are based on [[dichoptic presentation]] of the elements of a [[video game]] or [[virtual reality]] such that each eye receives different signals of the virtual world that the player's brain must combine in order to play successfully.

One of the earliest systems of this kind has been proposed by a research group in the [[University of Nottingham]] with the aim of treating amblyopia, using virtual reality masks&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/WO2003092482A1?hl=en Patent WO2003092482 A1 Ocular display apparatus for assessment and measurement of and for treatment of ocular disorders, and methods therefor], priority date 4 May 2002, publication date 13 November 2003, Isabel Ash et al.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eastgate-etal-2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eastgate RM, Griffiths GD, Waddingham PE, Moody AD, Butler TK, Cobb SV, Comaish IF, Haworth SM, Gregson RM, Ash IM, Brown SM |title=Modified virtual reality technology for treatment of amblyopia |journal=Eye (London, England) |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=370–4 | date=March  2006 |pmid=15832182 |doi=10.1038/sj.eye.6701882 |url= |issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|author=Gareth Mitchell|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4849244.stm|journal=BBC News|title=Video games tackle 'lazy eye'|date=28 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; or commercially available [[Active shutter 3D system|3D shutter glasses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=N.

Another system of dichoptic presentation for binocular vision therapy has been proposed by researchers of the Research Institute of the [[McGill University]] Health Centre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/WO2009053917A1?hl=en Patent WO 2009053917 A1 Binocular vision assessment and/or therapy], priority date 23 October 2007, publication date 30 April 2009, Robert F.

== Health care policy matters ==
[[File:Prismenglaeser2.jpg|thumb|Prism lenses (here unusually thick) are used for pre-operative prism adaptation.]]
Health insurances always review therapies in terms of [[Clinical governance#Clinical effectiveness|clinical effectiveness]] in view of existing scientific literature, benefit, risk and cost. Even if individual cases of recovery exist, a treatment is only considered effective under this point of view if there is sufficient likelihood that it will predictably improve outcomes.

In this context, medical coverage policy of the global health services organization [[Cigna]] "does not cover [[vision therapy]], [[Optometry|optometric]] [[Vision training|training]], [[eye exercises]] or [[orthoptics]] because they are considered experimental, investigational or unproven for any indication including the management of visual disorders and learning disabilities" based on a bibliographic review published by Cigna which concludes that "insufficient evidence exists in the published, [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] literature to conclude that vision therapy is effective for the treatment of any of the strabismic disorders except preoperative [[prism]] adaptation for acquired esotropia".&lt;ref&gt;[https://cignaforhcp.cigna.com/public/content/pdf/coveragePolicies/medical/mm_0221_coveragepositioncriteria_vision_therapy_orthoptics.pdf Cigna Medical Coverage Policy], Coverage policy number 0221, effective 15 November 2012, for review 15 November 2013 (downloaded 20 July 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the U.S. [[managed health care]] company [[Aetna]] offers vision therapy only in contracts with [[Health insurance in the United States#Supplemental coverage|supplemental coverage]] and limits its prescriptions to a number of conditions that are explicitly specified in a list of vision disorders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/400_499/0489.html Clinical policy bulletins: Vision therapy], Number 0489, 4 June 2013, for review 13 June 2013 (downloaded 21 July 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Waspstinger1658-2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Wasp]] stinger, with droplet of [[venom (poison)|venom]]]]

A '''stinger''', or '''sting''', is a sharp [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] found in various [[animal]]s (typically [[arthropod]]s) capable of injecting [[venom]], usually by piercing the [[epidermis]] of another animal.  

An [[insect]] sting is complicated by its introduction of [[venom]], although not all stings are venomous.  Bites, which can introduce [[saliva]] as well as additional pathogens and diseases, are often confused with stings.  Specific components of venom are believed to give rise to an [[Allergy|allergic reaction]], which in turn produces skin lesions that may vary from a small itching wheal, or slightly elevated area of the skin; to large areas of inflamed skin covered by [[Vesicle (dermatology)|vesicles]] and crusted [[lesions]].

Stinging insects produce a painful swelling of the skin, the severity of the lesion varying according to the location of the sting, the identity of the insect and the sensitivity of the subject. Many species of [[bee]]s and [[wasp]]s have two poison glands, one gland secreting a [[toxin]] in which [[formic acid]] is one recognized constituent, and the other secreting an [[alkaline]] [[neurotoxin]]; acting independently, each toxin is rather mild, but when they combine through the sting, the combination has strong irritating properties. In a small number of cases the second occasion of a bee or wasp sting causes a severe allergic reaction known as [[anaphylaxis]].

Hornets, some [[ant]]s, [[centipede]]s, and [[scorpion]]s also sting.

A few insects leave their stinger in the wound, but this is overstated.  For example, of the 10,000 species of bees worldwide, only the half-dozen species of honeybees (''[[Honey bee|Apis]]'') are reported to have a barbed stinger that cannot be withdrawn; of wasps, all are reported to have smooth stingers.  A sting, and especially multiple stings, may give rise to severe systemic symptoms which may lead to death; this most frequently occurs with a few social bees and wasps.

==Arthropods==
[[File:Vespula vulgaris SEM Sting 01.jpg|right|thumb|[[Yellowjacket]] sting in its sheath in the [[scanning electron microscope]].]]
Among arthropods, a sting or stinger is a sharp organ, often connected with a venom gland and adapted to inflict a wound by piercing, as with the caudal sting of a [[scorpion]]. Stings are usually located at the rear of the animal. Animals with stings include bees, wasps (including [[hornet]]s) and [[scorpion]]s.&lt;ref name="Eisner2005"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Thomas Eisner |author2=Maria Eisner |author3=Melody Siegler |year=2005 |title=Secret Weapons: Defences of Insects, Spiders, Scorpions, and other Many-legged Creatures |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |isbn=978-0-674-01882-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oxford Dictionaries |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/stinger |website=oxforddictionaries.com |accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:ScorpionBarb.jpg|thumb|left| [[Scorpion]] stinger]]

In all stinging [[Hymenoptera]] the sting is a modified [[ovipositor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shing |first1=H. |last2=Erickson |first2=E. H. |title=Some ultrastructure of the honeybee (''Apis mellifera'' L.) sting |journal=Apidologie |date=1982 |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=203–213 |url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00890568/document |doi=10.1051/apido:19820301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most other stings, [[honey bee]] workers' stings are strongly barbed and lodge in the flesh of [[mammal]]s upon use, tearing free from the honey bee's body, killing the bee within minutes.&lt;ref name="Eisner2005"/&gt; The sting has its own [[ganglion]], and it continues to saw into the target's flesh and release venom for several minutes. This trait is of obvious disadvantage to the individual but protects the hive from attacks by large animals.  The barbs of a honey bee's attack are only suicidal if the skin is elastic, as is characteristic of vertebrates such as birds and mammals; honey bees can sting other insects repeatedly without dying. 

The sting of nearly all other bees and other sting-bearing organisms is not barbed and can be used to sting repeatedly.  The description of barbed or unbarbed is not precise: there are barbs on the stings of [[yellowjacket]] wasps and the [[Mexican honey wasp]], but the barbs are so small that the wasp can successfully withdraw her sting apparatus from victim's skin.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

The stings of some wasps, such as those of the ''[[Polistes versicolor]]'', contain relatively large amounts of [[5-hydroxytryptamine]] (5-HT) in its venoms. The 5-HT in these venoms has been found to play at least two roles: one as a pain-producing agent and the other in the distribution and penetration of the paralyzing components to vulnerable sites in the offender. This helps in the rapid immobilization of the animal or of the body parts receiving the venom.&lt;ref&gt;Welsh, John H., and Carolyn S. Batty. "5-Hydroxytryptamine Content of Some Arthropod Venoms and Venom-containing Parts." Toxic on 1.4 (1963): 165-70. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spiders only bite, although some tarantulas have [[urticating hairs]].  Certain caterpillars also have urticating hairs.

==Other animals==
Organs that perform similar functions in non-arthropods are often referred to as "stings". These organs include the modified [[dermal denticle]] of the [[stingray]], the [[Platypus venom|venomous spurs]] on the hind legs of the male [[platypus]], and the [[cnidocyte]] [[tentacle]]s of the [[jellyfish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/sting#sting__4|title=sting: definition of sting in Oxford dictionary (American English) (US)|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''sting'' was historically often used for the [[fang]] of a [[snake]],&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed. "Sting ... Applied also to the fang or venom-tooth (and erroneously to the forked tongue) of a poisonous serpent."&lt;/ref&gt; although this usage is uncommon today. Snakes are said, correctly, to [[snake-bite|bite]], not sting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="57148">'''Xenoestrogens''' are a type of [[xenohormone]] that imitates [[estrogen]]. They can be either synthetic or natural [[chemical compound]]s.  Synthetic xenoestrogens include some widely used industrial compounds, such as [[Polychlorinated biphenyls|PCBs]], [[Bisphenol A|BPA]], and [[phthalates]], which have estrogenic effects on a living organism even though they differ chemically from the estrogenic substances produced internally by the [[endocrine system]] of any organism.  Natural xenoestrogens include [[phytoestrogen]]s which are plant-derived xenoestrogens.  Because the primary route of exposure to these compounds is by consumption of phytoestrogenic plants, they are sometimes called "dietary estrogens".  [[Mycoestrogen]]s, estrogenic substances from [[fungus|fungi]], are another type of xenoestrogen that are also considered [[mycotoxin]]s.

Xenoestrogens are clinically significant because they can mimic the effects of endogenous estrogen and thus have been implicated in [[precocious puberty]] and other disorders of the reproductive system.&lt;ref name="Aksglaede_2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Herman-Giddens_1997"/&gt;

Xenoestrogens include pharmacological estrogens (estrogenic action is an intended effect, as in the drug [[ethinylestradiol]] used in [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|contraceptive pill]]), but other chemicals may also have estrogenic effects. Xenoestrogens have been introduced into the environment by industrial, agricultural and chemical companies and consumers only in the last 70 years or so, but archiestrogens have been a ubiquitous part of the environment even before the existence of the human race given that some plants (like the cereals and the legumes) are using estrogenic substances possibly as part of their natural defence against [[herbivore]] animals by controlling their fertility.&lt;ref name="pmid3203635"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hughes CL | title = Phytochemical mimicry of reproductive hormones and modulation of herbivore fertility by phytoestrogens | journal = Environ.

Xenoestrogens are also called "environmental hormones" or "EDC" (Endocrine Disrupting Compounds).   Most scientists that study xenoestrogens, including [[The Endocrine Society]], regard them as serious environmental hazards that have [[Endocrine disruptor|hormone disruptive effects]] on both wildlife and humans.&lt;ref name="isbn0-911131-35-3"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bern HA |author2=Blair P |author3=Brasseur S |author4=Colborn T |author5=Cunha GR |author6=Davis W |author7=Dohler KD |author8=Fox G |author9=Fry M |author10=Gray E |author11=Green R |author12=Hines M |author13=Kubiak TJ |author14=McLachlan J |author15=Myers JP |author16=Peterson RE |author17=Reijnders P.J.H. |author18=Soto A |author19=Van Der Kraak G |author20=vom Saal F |author21=Whitten P |veditors=Clement C, Colborn T | title = Chemically-induced alterations in sexual and functional development -- the wildlife/human connection | chapter =  Statement from the Work Session on Chemically-Induced Alterations in Sexual Development: The Wildlife/Human Connection | edition = | language = | publisher = Princeton Scientific Pub.

== Mechanism of action ==
The onset of puberty is characterized by increased levels of hypothalamic gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH triggers the secretion of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) and [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) from the [[anterior pituitary gland]], which in turn causes the ovaries to respond and secrete [[estradiol]].  Increases in gonadal estrogen promote breast development, female fat distribution and skeletal growth.  Adrenal androgen and gonadal androgen result in pubic and axillary hair.&lt;ref name="Speroff_1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roy_2009"/&gt; Peripheral precocious puberty caused by exogenous estrogens is evaluated by assessing decreased levels of gonadotrophins.&lt;ref name="Massart_2006"/&gt;

Hormones or substances with hormone disrupting capability may interfere with pubertal development by actions at different levels – hypothalamic-pituitary axis, gonads, peripheral target organs such as the breast, hair follicles and genitals.  Exogenous man made chemicals that mimic estrogen can alter the functions of the endocrine system and cause various health defects by interfering with synthesis, metabolism, binding or cellular responses of natural estrogens.&lt;ref name="Roy_2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Toppari_2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caserta_2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Danzo_1998"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Danzo BJ | title = The effects of environmental hormones on reproduction | journal = Cell.

Although the physiology of the reproductive system is complex, the action of environmental exogenous estrogens is hypothesized to occur by two possible mechanisms. Xenoestrogens may temporarily or permanently alter the feedback loops in the brain, pituitary, gonads, and thyroid by mimicking the effects of estrogen and triggering their specific receptors or they may bind to hormone receptors and block the action of natural hormones.  Thus it is plausible that environmental estrogens can accelerate sexual development if present in a sufficient concentration or with chronic exposure.&lt;ref name="Toppari_2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Danzo_1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Louis_2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Raiser_2006"/&gt; The similarity in the structure of exogenous estrogens and the estrogens has changed the hormone balance within the body and resulted in various reproductive problems in females.&lt;ref name="Roy_2009"/&gt; The overall mechanism of action is binding of the exogenous compounds that mimic estrogen to the estrogen binding receptors and cause the determined action in the target organs.&lt;ref name="Mueller_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mueller SO | title = Xenoestrogens: mechanisms of action and detection methods | journal = Anal Bioanal Chem | volume = 378 | issue = 3 | pages = 582–7 |date=February 2004 | pmid = 14564443 | doi = 10.1007/s00216-003-2238-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a concern that xenoestrogens may act as false messengers and disrupt the process of [[reproduction]]. Xenoestrogens, like all estrogens, can increase growth of the [[endometrium]], so treatments for [[endometriosis]] include avoidance of products which contain them. Likewise, they are avoided in order to prevent the onset or aggravation of [[adenomyosis]]. Studies have implicated observations of disturbances in wildlife with estrogenic exposure.  For example, discharge from human settlement including runoff and water flowing out of wastewater treatment plants release a large amount of xenoestrogens into streams, which lead to immense alterations in aquatic life.  With a [[bioaccumulation]] factor of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; –10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, fish are extremely susceptible to pollutants.&lt;ref name="Williams_1998"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Williams DE, Lech JJ, Buhler DR | title = Xenobiotics and xenoestrogens in fish: modulation of cytochrome P450 and carcinogenesis | journal = Mutat.

When comparing fish from above a wastewater treatment plant and below a wastewater treatment plant, studies found disrupted ovarian and testicular histopathology, gonadal intersex, reduced gonad size, vitellogenin induction, and altered sex ratios.&lt;ref name="Vajda_2008"/&gt;

The sex ratios are female biased because xenoestrogens interrupt gonadal configuration causing complete or partial sex reversal.  When comparing adjacent populations of white sucker fish, the exposed female fish can have up to five oocyte stages and asynchronously developing ovaries versus the unexposed female fish who usually have two oocyte stages and group-synchronously developing ovaries.  Previously, this type of difference has only been found between tropical and temperate species.&lt;ref name="Vajda_2008"/&gt;

Sperm concentrations and motility perimeters are reduced in male fish exposed to xenoestrogens in addition to disrupt stages of spermatogenesis.&lt;ref name="pmid15159524"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vajda_2008"/&gt;  Moreover, xenoestrogens have been leading to vast amounts of intersex in fish.  For example, one study indicates the numbers of intersex in white sucker fish to be equal to the number of males in the population downstream of a waste water treatment plant.  No intersex members were found upstream from the plant.  Also, they found differences in the proportion of testicular and ovarian tissue and its degree of organization between the intersex fish.&lt;ref name="Vajda_2008"/&gt;  Furthermore, xenoestrogens expose fish to CYP1A inducers through inhibiting a putative labile protein and enhancing the Ah receptor, which has been linked to epizootics of cancer and the initiation of tumors.&lt;ref name="Williams_1998"/&gt;

The induction of CYP1A has been established to be a good bioindicator for xenoestrogen exposure.  In addition, xenoestrogens stimulate vitellogenin (Vtg), which acts as a nutrient reserve, and Zona readiata proteins (Zrp), which forms eggshells.  Therefore, Vtg and Zrp are biomarkers to exposure for fish.&lt;ref name="pmid10856602"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Arukwe A, Celius T, Walther BT, Goksøyr A | title = Effects of xenoestrogen treatment on zona radiata protein and vitellogenin expression in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) | journal = Aquat.

=== Impact ===

The ubiquitous presence of such estrogenic substances is a significant health concern, both individually and for a population. Life relies on the transmission of biochemical information to the next generation, and the presence of xenoestrogens may interfere with this transgenerational information process through "chemical confusion" (Vidaeff and Sever),&lt;ref name="pmid15808781"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vidaeff AC, Sever LE | title = In utero exposure to environmental estrogens and male reproductive health: a systematic review of biological and epidemiologic evidence | journal = Reprod.

==== Tuscany precocious puberty cases ====
Dr. Massart and colleagues from the [[University of Pisa]] studied the increased prevalence of precocious puberty in a region of northwest Tuscany. This region of Italy is represented by a high density of navy yards and greenhouses where exposures to pesticides and mycoestrogens (estrogens produced by fungi) are common.   Although unable to identify a definitive cause of the high rates of precocious puberty, the authors concluded environmental pesticides and herbicides may be implicated.&lt;ref name="Massart_2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Massart F, Meucci V, Saggese G, Soldani G | title = High growth rate of girls with precocious puberty exposed to estrogenic mycotoxins | journal = J.

==== Dairy contamination ====
Animal feed was contaminated with several thousand pounds of polybrominated biphenyl in Michigan in 1973 resulting in high exposures of PBB in the population via milk and other products from contaminated cows.  Perinatal exposure of children was estimated by measuring PBB in serum of mothers some years after exposure.  Girls that had been exposed to high PBB levels through lactation had an earlier age of menarche and pubic hair development than girls who had less perinatal exposure.  The study noted there no differences found in the timing of breast development among the cases and controls.&lt;ref name="Toppari_2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Raiser_2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogan_2007"/&gt;

==== Fish contamination ====
The Great Lakes have been polluted with industrial wastes (mainly PCBs and DDT) since the beginning of the 20th century.  These compounds have accumulated in birds and sports fish.  A study was designed to assess the impact of consumption of contaminated fish on pregnant women and their children.  Concentrations of maternal serum PCB and DDE and their daughters' age at menarche were reviewed.  In multivariate analysis, DDE but not PCB was linked with a lowered age of menarche.&lt;ref name="Raiser_2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Den_Hond_Schoeters_2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogan_2007"/&gt; Limitations of the study included indirect measurement of the exposure and self reporting of menarche.&lt;ref name="Raiser_2006"/&gt;

==== Implications ====

Precocious puberty has numerous significant physical, psychological and social implications for a young girl. Unfortunately, premature pubertal growth spurt and accelerated bone maturation will result in premature closure of [[distal]] [[epiphysis]] which causes reduced adult height and short stature.&lt;ref name="Cesario_Hughes_2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cesario SK, Hughes LA | title = Precocious puberty: a comprehensive review of literature | journal = J Obstet Gynecol Neonatal Nurs | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 263–74 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17489932 | doi = 10.1111/j.1552-6909.2007.00145.x | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, US Food and Drug Administration has recommended to not take estrogen in food of more than 3.24&amp;nbsp;ng per day for females.&lt;ref name="Partsch_Sippell_2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Partsch CJ, Sippell WG | title = Pathogenesis and epidemiology of precocious puberty.

The current literature is inadequate to provide the information we need to assess the extent to which environmental chemicals contribute to precocious puberty.&lt;ref name="Wang_2005"/&gt; Gaps in our knowledge are the result of limitations in the designs of studies, small sample sizes, challenges to conducting exposure assessment and the few number of chemicals studied.&lt;ref name="Wang_2005"/&gt; Unfortunately exposure is inferred and not actually measured in available studies.&lt;ref name="Caserta_2008"/&gt; The ability to detect the possible role of chemicals in altering pubertal development is confounded by many nutritional, genetic and lifestyle factors capable of affecting puberty and the complex nature of the reproductive endocrine system.&lt;ref name="Guillette_2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meeker_2009"/&gt; Other research challenges include shifts in exposure levels among populations over time and simultaneous exposures to multiple compounds.&lt;ref name="Meeker_2009"/&gt; Overall the literature does not with certainty support the contention that environmental chemicals or dietary factors are having widespread effects on human sexual development.  However data does not refute such a hypothesis either.  Accelerated sexual development is plausible in individuals exposed to high concentration of estrogenic substances.  There is a concerning steady increase in exposure to a wide variety of xenoestrogens in the industrial world.  Further research is needed to assess the impact of these compounds on pubertal development.

=== In other animals ===

Non-human animal studies have shown that exposure to environmental contaminants with estrogenic activity can accelerate the onset of puberty.  A potential mechanism has been described in rats exposed to DDT or beta-estradiol in which GnRH pulsatile secretion was found to be increased.&lt;ref name="Raiser_2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nikaido_2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nikaido Y, Yoshizawa K, Danbara N, Tsujita-Kyutoku M, Yuri T, Uehara N, Tsubura A | title = Effects of maternal xenoestrogen exposure on development of the reproductive tract and mammary gland in female CD-1 mouse offspring | journal = Reprod.

== Common environmental estrogens ==

=== Atrazine ===
[[Atrazine]] is widely used as an herbicide to control broad-leaf weed species that grow in crops such as corn, sugarcane, hay and winter wheat. Atrazine is also applied to Christmas trees, residential lawns, golf courses, and other recreational areas. Atrazine is the second largest selling pesticide in the world and estimated to be the most heavily used herbicide in the United States.&lt;ref name="Roy_2009"/&gt;

=== BPA ===
BPA ([[Bisphenol A]]) is the monomer used to manufacture [[polycarbonate]] plastic and epoxy resins used as a lining in most food and beverage cans.  BPA global capacity is in excess of {{convert|6.4|e9lb|kg}} per year and thus is one of the highest-volume chemicals produced worldwide.&lt;ref name="vom_Saal_Hughes_2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=vom Saal FS, Hughes C | title = An extensive new literature concerning low-dose effects of bisphenol A shows the need for a new risk assessment | journal = Environ.

But in the case of epoxypolymers formed from bisphenol A, it is not possible to release bisphenol A by such a reaction.  It is also noteworthy that, of the bisphenols, bisphenol A is a weak xenoestrogen.  Other compounds, such as bisphenol Z, have been shown to have stronger estrogenic effects in rats.&lt;ref name="Reid_1944"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=E.

PCBs were manufactured primarily for use as insulating fluids and coolants given their chemical stability, low flammability and electrical insulating properties.  PCBs were banned in 1979 but like DDT continue to persist in the environment.&lt;ref name="Roy_2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caserta_2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogan_2007"/&gt;

===Phthalates===
[[Phthalates]] are plasticizers providing durability and flexibility to plastics such as polyvinyl chloride. High molecular weight phthalates are used in [[flooring]], wall coverings and medical device such as intravenous bags and tubing.  Low molecular weight phthalates are found in perfumes, lotions, cosmetics, varnishes, lacquers and coatings including timed releases in pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref name="Roy_2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Patisaul_2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nilsson_2000"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nilsson R | title = Endocrine modulators in the food chain and environment | journal = Toxicol Pathol | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 420–31 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10862560 | doi =10.1177/019262330002800311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zeranol===
[[Zeranol]] is currently used as an anabolic growth promoter for [[livestock]] in the US&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=US Food and Drug Administration|title=21CFR522.2680|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=522.2680|accessdate=14 June 2014|ref=21CFR522.2680}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Health Canada|title=Questions and Answers - Hormonal Growth Promoters|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/vet/faq/growth_hormones_promoters_croissance_hormonaux_stimulateurs-eng.php|accessdate=14 June 2014|quote=There are six hormonal growth promoters approved in Canada for use in beef cattle: three natural - progesterone, testosterone and estradiol-17ß; and three synthetic - trenbolone acetate (TBA), zeranol and melengestrol acetate (MGA).}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been banned in the [[EU]] since 1985,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Agriculture and Fisheries (including Agro-industry, Food technologies, Forestry, Aquaculture and Rural Development) |title=Development, validation and harmonisation of screening and confirmatory tests to distinguish zeranol abuse from fusarium toxin contamination in food animals |url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/agro/fair/en/uk3443.html |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=14 June 2014 |quote=The use of zeranol for growth promotion in food animals was banned in the EU in 1985. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305071349/http://ec.europa.eu/research/agro/fair/en/uk3443.html |archivedate=March 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but is still present as a contaminant in food through meat products that were exposed to it.&lt;ref name="Roy_2009"/&gt;
