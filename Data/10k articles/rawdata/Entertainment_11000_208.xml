'''Apple TV''' is a [[digital media player]] and [[microconsole]] developed and sold by [[Apple Inc.]] It is a small [[networking hardware|network appliance]] and entertainment device that can receive digital data such as music or video from specific sources and stream it to a [[television]] that has HDMI input.

Apple TV is an [[HDMI]]-compliant source device. To use it for viewing, it has to be connected to an [[enhanced-definition television|enhanced-definition]] or [[high-definition television|high-definition]] [[widescreen]] television via an HDMI cable. The device has no integrated controls and can only be controlled externally, either by an [[Apple Remote]] or [[Siri Remote]] control device (with which it is sold) using its infrared/Bluetooth capability, by the [[Remote (Apple software)|Apple TV Remote app]] (downloadable from [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]) on [[iOS]] devices, such as the [[iPhone]], [[iPod Touch]], [[iPad]], and [[Apple Watch]], using its [[Wi-Fi]] capability, or by some third-party [[remote control|infrared remotes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Apple TV: Can I program my universal remote to work with Apple TV |url=https://www.apple.com/shop/question/answers/readonly/tag/appletv/can-i-program-my-universal-remote-to-work-with-apple-tv/QFPXHYX7XY9HCCFYC |website=Apple |publisher=Apple |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Can the Apple TV bring everything under (remote) control? |url=https://www.macworld.com/article/3011167/home-players/how-to-use-any-remote-control-with-your-apple-tv.html |website=Macworld |publisher=Macworld |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its Wi-Fi capability is also used to receive digital content from various iOS apps using [[AirPlay]] or directly from the [[iTunes Store]], which is then streamed to the TV. It also plays digital content from the [[iTunes Store]], [[Netflix]], [[Stan (company)|Stan]], [[Foxtel Now]], [[Hulu]], [[Now TV (UK)|Now TV]] ([[United Kingdom|UK]] only), [[Sling TV|SlingTV]], [[PlayStation Vue]], [[Amazon Video|Amazon Prime Video]], [[DirecTV]], [[YouTube]], [[Red Bull TV]] and [[Vevo]] along with [[HBO Now]], [[Showtime Anytime]], [[Starz]], and the [[TV Everywhere]] portals of several cable and broadcast networks, and the video subscription portals of three of the four major North American sports leagues: [[MLB.tv]], [[NBA League Pass]], and [[National Hockey League#Out-of-market packages|NHL.tv]]. It plays content from any [[macOS]] or [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] computer running [[iTunes]]. Apple began to promote the Live Tune-In feature that allows the viewer to ask [[Siri]] to tune to live streams of [[CBS]], [[ESPN]], and [[Disney XD]] among many others that support Live Tune-In.

==History==

===Predecessors===

In an early attempt to enter the home entertainment industry, Apple released the [[Macintosh TV]] in 1993. Macintosh TV had a 14-inch CRT screen along with a TV tuner card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=When Apple flops: The worst Apple products of all time |url=https://www.networkworld.com/article/2236724/data-center/when-apple-flops--the-worst-apple-products-of-all-time.html |website=Network World |publisher=Network World |accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This did not prove to be a success, as only 10,000 units of Macintosh TV were sold up to its discontinuation in 1994.&lt;ref name="appgragh"&gt;{{cite web |title=Apple TV: The history of Apple's bid to take over your living room |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/11849521/Apple-TV-The-story-of-Apples-bid-to-take-over-your-living-room.html |website=Telegraph UK |publisher=Telegraph UK |accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple's next foray into the television industry came with the [[Apple Interactive Television Box]], also in 1994. Apple Interactive Television Box was a collaboration venture between Apple, BT and [[Belgacom]] but it never went on full sale.&lt;ref name="appgragh"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=APPLE TV PROTOTYPE SELLS ON EBAY FOR 46 BUCKS |url=https://www.wired.com/2010/05/apple-tv-prototype-sells-on-ebay-for-46-bucks/ |website=Wired |publisher=Wired |accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple's last major attempt to enter the home entertainment market before Apple TV occurred with their launch of [[Apple Bandai Pippin]] in the late 1990s. Apple Bandai Pippin combined a home game console with a networked computer.&lt;ref name="appgragh"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=When Apple Failed |url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/10/29/apple-product-flops-tech-personal-cx_ag_1030apple.html |website=Forbes |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1st generation===
[[File:Macworld San Francisco banner "Introducing Apple TV"-2007-01-09.jpg|thumb|Macworld San Francisco banner "Introducing Apple TV", January 9, 2007]]
Apple TV was unveiled as a work in progress called '''"iTV"''' on September 12, 2006 using a modified [[Front Row (software)|Front Row]] interface using the [[Apple Remote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Peter|title=Apple 'It's Showtime!' event|work=[[MacWorld]]|date=September 12, 2006|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/52855/2006/09/showtime.html|accessdate=September 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eran|first=Daniel|title=How Apple's iTV Media Strategy Works|work=RoughlyDrafted Magazine|date=September 13, 2006|url=http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/21133BEF-61B4-40C1-A976-5C1360E60694.html|accessdate=June 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple started taking pre-orders for Apple TV on January 9, 2007. The name "iTV" was originally going to be used to keep the product in line with the rest of their "i"-based products (iMac, iPod, etc.), but was not used because the British terrestrial broadcast network [[ITV Network|ITV]] holds the rights to the name in the UK and threatened to take legal action against Apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/9076502/ITV-warns-Apple-not-to-brand-smart-television-iTV.html | title=ITV warns Apple not to brand smart television 'iTV' | accessdate=February 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple TV first shipped on March 21, 2007 with a 40&amp;nbsp;[[gigabyte|GB]] [[hard disk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2007/03/21Apple-TV-Now-Shipping/ |title=Apple TV Now Shipping |date=March 21, 2007 |accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A updated model with a 160&amp;nbsp;GB HDD was released on May 31, 2007; subsequently, Apple ceased selling the 40&amp;nbsp;GB HDD version on September 14, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/142782/2009/09/apple_drops_price_of_apple_tv_16gb_to_229.html|title=Apple drops price of 160GB Apple TV, kills 40GB model|first=Aayush|last=Arya|date=September 14, 2009|work=MacWorld|accessdate=September 14, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005103947/http://www.macworld.com/article/142782/2009/09/apple_drops_price_of_apple_tv_16gb_to_229.html|archivedate=October 5, 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 15, 2008, a software upgrade was announced; this turned the Apple TV into a stand-alone device which removed the requirement for a computer running iTunes on Mac OS X or Windows to stream or sync content to it, and making most of the Apple TV's hard disk redundant. The update allowed the iTunes Store content to be directly rented and purchased, as well as photo streaming and podcast downloads from [[MobileMe]] (which was called [[.Mac]] at the time) and [[Flickr]].&lt;ref name="SWUpdates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3187|title=Apple TV: About Apple TV software updates|date=November 19, 2008|publisher=Apple|accessdate=November 20, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205100216/http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3187|archivedate=December 5, 2008|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Front Row became deprecated, and a new interface was introduced for the original Apple TV in which content was organized into six categories, all of which appeared in a large square box on the screen upon startup (movies, TV shows, music, [[YouTube]], podcasts, and photos) and presented in the initial menu, along with a "Settings" option for configuration, including software updates.&lt;ref name="MacNN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macnn.com/articles/08/02/12/apple.tv.gallery|title=Gallery: Apple TV Take 2 software update|date=February 12, 2008|publisher=MacNN|accessdate=March 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1600|title=How to update Apple TV software|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|date=September 2, 2008|accessdate=March 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 10, 2008, Apple released the [[iTunes Remote]] app on the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/07/10/apples-remote-control-application-for-itunes-and-apple-tv/|title=Apple's Remote: turns your iPhone into a WiFi remote control|first=Thomas|last=Ricker|work=[[Engadget]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|date=July 10, 2008|accessdate=July 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Apple TV 2.1 software update that added recognition for the [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]] as remote control devices intended as a software alternative to the Apple Remote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuaw.com/2008/07/10/apple-tv-2-1-update-goes-live-adds-mobileme-support/|title=Apple TV 2.1 update goes live, adds MobileMe support|first=Cory|last=Bohon|work=The Unofficial Apple Weblog|publisher=[[AOL]]|date=July 10, 2008|accessdate=July 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later updates to the Apple TV, iTunes, and Remote software added support for the [[iPad]], and introduced support for new features as they were added to iTunes.

In July 2011, Apple discontinued the Front Row interface for Mac users.&lt;ref name="front_row_mac_discontinued_2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1161284/farewell_frontrow.html|title=Farewell Front Row|last=Breen|first=Christopher|date=July 22, 2011|website=[[Macworld]]|publisher=[[International Data Group]]|access-date=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 9, 2015, Apple discontinued service and support for the first generation Apple TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://9to5mac.com/2015/08/28/apple-tvs-ipods-cinema-display-obsolete-sept-8/|title=Apple TVs (plus iPods &amp; Cinema Displays) hitting obsolete status day before new hardware on Sept 9|work=9to5Mac}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning May 25, 2018, iTunes Store is no longer accessible from the device, due to its obsolete security standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT208104|title=About iTunes Store availability|date=February 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2nd and 3rd generation===
The second generation Apple TV was unveiled on September 1, 2010, and was the first to run on a variant of [[iOS]].&lt;ref name="newappletv"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Overhauled Apple TV unveiled |work=The Spy Report |publisher=Media Spy |date=September 2, 2010 |url=http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/09/02/overhauled-apple-tv-unveiled |accessdate=September 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313133403/http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/09/02/overhauled-apple-tv-unveiled/ |archivedate=March 13, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newappletv1"&gt;{{Cite news|title=From Apple, a Step Into Social Media for Music|work=The New York Times|first=Miguel|last=Helft|date=September 1, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/02/technology/02apple.html|accessdate=September 8, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902034655/http://www.nytimes.com//2010//09//02//technology//02apple.html |archivedate=September 2, 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newappletv2"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Apple Goes 'Wild' Over New iPods|publisher=ABC News|first=Ki Mae|last=Heussner|date=September 1, 2010|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/apples-ipods-unveiled-ceo-steve-jobs/story?id=11534551|accessdate=September 8, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100904133427/http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/apples-ipods-unveiled-ceo-steve-jobs/story?id=11534551|archivedate=September 4, 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device is housed in a smaller, all-black case, one-quarter the size of the original. This model replaced the internal [[hard drive]] with 8 GB internal flash storage, enough local storage for buffering purposes; all media became streamed, instead of synced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Apple-TV-2nd-Generation-Teardown/3625/2|title=Apple TV 2nd Generation Teardown&amp;nbsp;— Page 2|publisher=iFixit|accessdate=March 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015 the [[YouTube]] app was removed from 2nd generation Apple TVs due to an [[API]] change by [[Google]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://9to5mac.com/2015/05/04/apple-pulls-youtube-from-older-2nd-gen-apple-tvs-after-planned-google-api-change/ Apple pulls YouTube from older 2nd-gen Apple TVs after planned Google API change]. 9to5Mac. 4 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the March 7, 2012 presentation that mainly dealt with the [[iPad (3rd generation)|third generation iPad]], Apple CEO [[Tim Cook]] announced a third version of the Apple TV. While being externally identical to the second generation model, the third generation Apple TV includes a single-core [[Apple A5|A5]] processor which also allows for [[1080p]] content support from iTunes and [[Netflix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple |url=https://www.apple.com/appletv/specs.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809061434/http://www.apple.com/appletv/specs.html |archivedate=August 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple silently released a third generation "Rev A" on January 28, 2013 with component changes included. By October 2016, Apple had phased out the Apple TV third generation, with Apple Store employees instructed to pull all units and demo units from store shelves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple discontinues third-gen Apple TV, removes it from online store|url=https://9to5mac.com/2016/10/04/apple-tv-third-gen-discontinued/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amazon Video]] was automatically added to 3rd generation Apple TVs running 7.2.2 on December 6, 2017.&lt;ref name=amazonvideo /&gt;

===4th and 5th generation===
On September 9, 2015, Apple announced the 4th generation Apple TV at [[List of Apple Inc. media events#Apple Special Event (September 9, 2015)|an Apple Special Event]], where [[Tim Cook]] took the stage and said "The future of television is apps". While matching the form factor of the 2nd and 3rd generation models, the 4th generation model is significantly taller. In contrast to the old remote's arrow button, the 4th generation Apple TV's touch remote integrates swipe-to-select features and [[Siri]] support. This release also included a built-microphone and an [[accelerometer]] ([[Inertial measurement unit|IMU]]).

The 4th generation model also uses a new operating system, [[tvOS]], with an associated [[app store]], allowing download of third-party apps for video, audio, games and other content. Upon release, the third-party apps were available from a limited range of providers, with new [[API]]s providing opportunities for more third-party apps. A requirement of new apps and games is that they must include interfacing with the new touchpad-enabled Siri remote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Apple TV game developers are required to support the Siri remote|url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/09/16/apple-tv-siri-remote-required-for-games/|website=Engadget|accessdate=September 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4th generation Apple TV started shipping in October 2015. Upon launch, there were several unexpected issues which included incompatibility with [[Remote (Apple software)|Apple's Remote]] app for iOS and [[watchOS]].&lt;ref name="AI remote info 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/10/30/new-apple-tv-incompatible-with-apples-own-remote-app-for-ios-and-watchos|title=New Apple TV incompatible with Apple's own Remote app for iOS and watchOS|first=Mikey|last=Campbell|date=October 30, 2015|accessdate=January 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These issues were fixed by Apple on December 8, 2015 in tvOS 9.1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2015/12/08/apple-tv-remote-support-new-apple-tv/|title=Apple Remote App for iOS Now Works With New Apple TV Following tvOS 9.1 Update|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] initially declined to develop an [[Amazon Video]] application for Apple TV, and announced in October 2015 it would stop selling Apple TVs, and removed 3rd generation [[stock keeping unit|SKUs]].&lt;ref name="9to5mac amazon info 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://9to5mac.com/2015/10/30/amazon-apple-tv-pulled|title=Amazon follows through on threat, yanking all Apple TV hardware from leading online retail store|first=Jeremy|last=Horwitz|date=October 30, 2015|accessdate=January 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2017 Amazon reversed their stance and released an Amazon Video app,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/06/05/amazon-prime-video-apple-tv/|title=Apple Confirms Amazon Prime Video Coming to Apple TV Later This Year|last=Broussard|first=Mitchel|date=June 5, 2017|publisher=MacRumors|access-date=September 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and resumed sales of Apple TVs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apnews.com/5647a00a95db4e92aaaf5a812ac6927d/Amazon-making-nice,-prepares-sales-of-Apple-TV,-Chromecast|title=Amazon making nice, prepares sales of Apple TV, Chromecast|date=December 15, 2017|accessdate=December 19, 2017|publisher=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 13, 2016, Apple released the [[tvOS 10]] software update for the Apple TV, bringing an all new remote app, single-sign on, dark mode, [[HomeKit]] support, and other features to the 4th generation Apple TV.

On September 12, 2017, Apple announced the 5th generation Apple TV, named Apple TV 4K, which supports [[4K resolution|2160p]] output, [[high-dynamic-range video|HDR10]], [[Dolby Vision]], and includes a faster [[Apple A10X Fusion]] processor. [[Dolby Atmos]] support was added in tvOS 12.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/4/17413250/apple-tv-update-tvos-dolby-atmos-support-spectrum-wwdc-2018 The Apple TV is finally getting Dolby Atmos support].

Following the announcement of the new models, the 64&amp;nbsp;GB version of the 4th generation Apple TV was discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/09/apple-tv-4k-brings-home-the-magic-of-cinema-with-4k-and-hdr/ Apple TV 4K brings home the magic of cinema with 4K and HDR].

==Features==
Apple TV allows consumers to use an [[HDTV]] to stream video, music, and podcasts as well as downloading apps and games from the tvOS App Store. The first, second, and third generations offered limited content which Apple had provisioned to work with Apple TV. These have now been discontinued&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://9to5mac.com/2016/10/04/apple-tv-third-gen-discontinued/ |title=Apple discontinues third-gen Apple TV, removes it from online store |publisher=9to5mac.com |access-date=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of the fourth generation Apple TV, with an OS based on [[iOS]] called tvOS which lets developers create their own apps with their own interface that run on Apple TV. These include multimedia, music apps, and games.

Features of Apple TV include:
*'''Video Streaming'''
**Users of Apple TV can rent or buy movies and TV shows from the [[iTunes Store]], or stream video from a variety of services found in the tvOS App Store such as [[Netflix]], [[Amazon Video|Amazon Prime Video]], [[Hulu]], [[YouTube]], [[Vimeo]], [[HBO Now]], [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], [[Sling TV]], and [[DirecTV Now]].
**Users can stream live and on-demand content from apps that support login through a cable provider by way of one universal app called [[Apple TV (software)|TV]]. The upcoming single-sign on feature in tvOS 10.1 will allow users to log in to all of these apps at once, bypassing the need to authenticate each individually.
*'''Music and Podcasts Streaming'''
**Users can access their music and podcasts libraries that they purchased in iTunes through iCloud through the Music and Podcasts apps, respectively. In addition, users can also subscribe to music streaming services such as [[Apple Music]], [[Pandora Music]], [[Qello]], and [[Vevo]] and access content that way.
*'''Photos'''
**The built in Photos app syncs user photos from [[iCloud]] Photo Library and displays them on TV. In addition, users can download third-party apps like [[Adobe Lightroom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.adobe.com/lightroomjournal/2016/07/lightroom-for-apple-tv.html |title=Announcing Lightroom for Apple TV |website=blogs.adobe.com |access-date=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to view, edit and share them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How to sync Apple iPhone photos to iPad, Mac, Apple TV |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/15/how-to-sync-apple-iphone-photos-to-ipad-mac-apple-tv.html |website=CNBC |publisher=CNBC |accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Apps and Games'''
**With the fourth generation Apple TV and later, users can download apps and games from the tvOS App Store. This app store is similar to the one found on the Apple [[iPhone]] and [[iPad]].
**Apps can now be ported from iOS easily by developers since tvOS and iOS share a common codebase and kernel. 
***Examples include the [[Papa John's Pizza]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://9to5mac.com/2016/08/30/papa-johns-apple-tv-pizza-delivery/ |title=Papa John's now lets you order pizza straight from your Apple TV |publisher=9to5mac.com |access-date=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; app which allows for users to order pizza right from Apple TV and [[Zillow]] which allows users to search for homes right on their TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Apple TV Can Help You Find a New Home |url=https://www.lifewire.com/apple-tv-can-help-you-find-a-new-home-4092157 |website=Lifewire |publisher=Lifewire |accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[NASA]] app for Apple TV includes live streaming of [[NASA TV]] content, including [[International Space Station]] missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NASA app for Apple TV adds live streaming from ISS, on-demand video, 15k photos &amp; more |url=https://9to5mac.com/2016/06/22/nasa-app-apple-tv-4th-gen/ |website=9to5Mac |publisher=9to5Mac |accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Games use the Accelerometer and Gyroscope along with the touchpad found on the Siri Remote for control. External Bluetooth game controllers can also be paired.
***Examples include Asphalt 8, which can be played using the Siri Remote.
*'''Casting and Mirroring'''
**With [[AirPlay]], users can stream or mirror content wirelessly from an iOS device or Mac. AirPlay can be accessed by swiping up from the bottom of the screen in Control Center on iOS or in the Menu Bar on a Mac. Its functions include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204289 |title=How to AirPlay content from your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch |website=support.apple.com |access-date=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
***Casting, which allows users to wirelessly send video or audio from their iPhone, iPad, or Mac to the Apple TV.
***Mirroring, which allows users to wirelessly mirror their Mac screen or AirPlay device which to the TV, using it as a second monitor.
***Peer-to-Peer AirPlay, which uses Bluetooth to connect if the Apple TV and the iOS Device/Mac are not on the same Wi-Fi network.
*'''Siri'''
**Since the 4th generation model, [[Siri]] is built into Apple TV. Siri enables voice dictation in text fields, including usernames and passwords.
**Universal search is available for a wide number of apps in the [[United States]], but the feature is limited to [[iTunes]] and [[Netflix]] in [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Germany]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. In [[Australia]], universal search supports movies and TV shows in [[iTunes]], [[Netflix]], and [[Stan (company)|Stan.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How to find something you'll like on Netflix, Stan and Presto |url=https://www.businessinsider.com.au/how-to-find-something-youll-like-on-netflix-stan-and-presto-2016-1 |website=Business Insider Australia |publisher=Business Insider Australia |accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205321|title=About Search on your Apple TV (4th generation) - Apple Support|website=support.apple.com|access-date=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple has been expanding the feature to encompass additional channels worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macrumors.com/2016/06/21/apple-tv-universal-search-9-new-channels/|title=Apple TV Universal Search Gains Support for 9 New Channels Including Food Network and HGTV|last=Clover|first=Juli|access-date=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''HomeKit'''
**The third generation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT207057|title=Automate and remotely access your HomeKit accessories|work=Apple Support|access-date=2018-01-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple TV and later can also be used as a home hub to control HomeKit devices, such as locks, thermostats, or garage doors either locally or over the Internet. HomeKit Automation, such as automatic implementation of scenes, multiple user support and using Siri to control devices is possible with a fourth generation Apple TV or later.
*'''General'''
**HDMI CEC to control other devices in a user's home theater setup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205225|title= Control your TV or receiver with your Siri Remote or Apple TV Remote - Apple Support|website=support.apple.com|access-date=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**App Switcher which enables users to switch apps.
**Aerial Screensaver which allows the TV to display a flyover view of a city when Apple TV is inactive. Screensavers can also be invoked from the home screen by pressing menu on the Siri Remote once.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/tips/comments/aerial-screensavers-on-the-new-apple-tv|title= Aerial Screensavers on the new Apple TV |publisher=ilounge.com|access-date=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== App Store ===
*With the fourth generation Apple TV and tvOS, Apple announced an App Store which will allow any developer to make apps using the APIs available specifically tailored towards the TV.&lt;ref name="api_4_gen"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://9to5mac.com/2015/10/03/tim-cook-apple-tv-universal-search/|title=Tim Cook: Apple will offer an Apple TV API to open up universal search beyond initial launch partners|last=Mayo|first=Benjamin|date=October 3, 2015|publisher=9to5Mac|access-date=September 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, since tvOS is based on iOS, any developer can port over apps from iOS and with a few modifications, as Apple stated on stage, and can make them available for all tvOS users with the App Store. The App Store will not be available to previous Apple TVs and will be a feature of the fourth generation Apple TV onward.

=== Accessibility ===
Since tvOS and [[watchOS]] are based on iOS, they have inherited many of the accessibility features of [[iOS]] and [[macOS]]&lt;ref name="apple_accessiblity_tvOS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/accessibility/tvos/|title=Accessibility on tvOS|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|access-date=September 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are compatible with Apple's entire product line including the [[Apple Watch]] as a [[remote control]]ler for the Apple TV.

tvOS includes the Apple technologies of [[VoiceOver]], Zoom, and [[Siri]] to help the [[blindness|blind]] and those with low vision. Pairing a [[Bluetooth keyboard]] with the tvOS on the Apple TV enables another accessibility feature that also is an incorporation of VoiceOver. When typing, VoiceOver mirrors with an audio voice, each character pressed on the keyboard and repeated again when it is entered. The Apple TV is designed to work with the [[Apple Wireless Keyboard]] or the [[Magic Keyboard|Apple Magic Keyboard]].

Apple TV with and without tvOS supports [[closed captioning]], so the deaf or hard of hearing can properly watch TV episodes and feature-length movies. Compatible episodes and movies are denoted with a CC (closed captioning) or SDH (Descriptive Audio) icon in the iTunes Store either on the Apple TV or in iTunes itself. The viewer can customize the captions in episodes or movies with styles and [[font]]s that are more conducive to their hearing and/or visual impairment.&lt;ref name="cc_4th_gen"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202772|title=Turn on closed captions and subtitles on your Apple TV|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|access-date=September 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple's Remote app on iOS devices allows control of the Apple TV from an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch.&lt;ref name="remote_app_cnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/how-to/what-to-do-if-you-lose-your-apple-tv-remote/|title=What to do if you lose your Apple TV remote|last=Elliott|first=Matt|date=March 2, 2017|website=[[CNET]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|access-date=September 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restrictions===
Similar to Google's redesign of YouTube, Apple has restricted access to most viewed charts on movies and podcasts. They are replaced by "Top Movies", "Top Podcasts", and "Editor's Picks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What's wrong with Apple TV |url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1140859/appletv.html |website=Mac World |publisher=Macworld |accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parental controls allow consumers to limit access to Internet media service content via "Restrictions" settings; individual services can be turned off (e.g., to reduce clutter), icons can be rearranged via the tap-and-hold technique ''à la'' iOS. Internet media is split into four categories: "Internet Photos", "[[YouTube]]", "[[Podcast]]s", and "Purchase and Rental".  Each of the categories is configured by a parental control of "Show", "Hide" or "Ask" to prompt for a 4-digit PIN. In addition, movies, TV shows, music and podcasts can be restricted by rating.&lt;ref name=ExtremeTech&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extremetech.com/computing/79958-hands-on-with-apple-tv-20 |title=Hands On with Apple TV 2.0 |first=Jim |last=Lynch |date=February 15, 2008 |publisher=[[ExtremeTech]] |accessdate=February 19, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple TV in synchronization mode works in a way similar to the [[iPod]].

Apple TV can also function as a [[peer-to-peer]] [[digital media player]], streaming content from iTunes libraries and playing the content over the network.&lt;ref name=arsReview&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/hardware/reviews/2007/03/appletv.ars|title=Apple TV: an in-depth review|first=Jacqui|last=Cheng|author2=Ecker, Clint|date=March 27, 2007|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=April 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNNReview&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/ptech/03/27/apple.tv/index.html|title=Review: Apple TV best for iTunes addicts|first=John P.|last=Falcone|date=March 27, 2007|publisher=CNN|accessdate=April 3, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410041724/http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/ptech/03/27/apple.tv/index.html|archivedate=April 10, 2007|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1st generation Apple TVs can stream content from up to five computers or iTunes libraries. Also, five Apple TVs can be linked to the same iTunes library. The 2nd generation Apple TV onwards allows users to stream content from more than one iTunes library: these additional iTunes libraries can be on the same or on different computers. This is possible when Apple TV and every iTunes library from which you want to stream content meet all of the following conditions: (1) the Apple TV and the iTunes library you are streaming from are both on the same local network, (2) each uses the iTunes "Home Sharing" feature, and (3) each are using the same "Home Sharing" Apple ID.

4th generation Apple TVs and newer can also stream content locally using third party apps such as [[Plex (software)|Plex]] and [[VLC media player]].

====Supported formats====
Apple TV natively supports the following audio, video, and picture formats (although with the 4th generation, apps may use alternative built-in software in order to play other codecs and formats, e.g. [[VLC media player]]):

===Connectivity===
[[File:Apple TV back.jpg|thumb|Back of 1st generation Apple TV]]
[[File:Apple TV 2nd Generation back.jpg|thumb|Back of 2nd &amp;amp; 3rd generation Apple TV]]
Apple TV streams video through an [[HDMI]] cable (Type A) connected to the TV's HDMI port. [[Sound|Audio]] is supported through the [[TOSLINK|optical]] or HDMI ports. The device also has a [[Micro-USB]] port, which is reserved for service and diagnostics. The device connects through [[Ethernet]] or [[Wi-Fi]] to the computer for digital content from the Internet and local networks. Apple TV does not come with audio, video or other cables, which must be acquired additionally as required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple TV technical specifications|url=https://www.apple.com/appletv/specs/|accessdate=June 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the previous Apple TV, media files could be transferred directly onto the device by syncing with another computer. Once content was stored on the device's hard drive, Internet connectivity was no longer needed to view content.&lt;ref name=NoNetwork&gt;{{cite news|title=Apple Tries to Bridge Computer Desk, Living Room|first=Rob|last=Pegoraro|work=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/28/AR2007032802156.html|date=March 29, 2007|accessdate=June 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not the case with the later models, which do not have a hard drive for storing media.

The 1st generation Apple TV had [[component video]] and [[RCA connector]] audio ports, both removed in the 2nd generation. The device does not have [[RCA connector|RCA/composite video]] or [[F connector|F/RF]] connectors.&lt;ref name=CNNReview /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/appletv/specs.html|title=Apple TV&amp;nbsp;– Tech Specs|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|accessdate=April 3, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407181857/http://www.apple.com/appletv/specs.html|archivedate=April 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with the 4th generation Apple TV, Apple removed the [[TOSLINK|optical]] audio port. Apple also enhanced the HDMI port by adding support for [[HDMI 1.4]]. The 4th generation also removed the [[Micro-USB]] port in favor of the reversible [[USB-C]] port and the 5th generation removed USB entirely.

===AirPlay===
{{Main|AirPlay}}
AirPlay allows iOS devices or an [[AirPort]]-enabled computer with the [[iTunes]] music player to send a [[streaming media|stream]] of music to multiple (three to six, in typical conditions) stereos connected to an [[AirPort Express]] (the audio-only antecedent of Apple TV) or Apple TV.&lt;ref name=AirPlayHelp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3291|title=Apple TV: Using AirPlay|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|date=November 20, 2008|accessdate=March 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AirPort Express' streaming media capabilities use Apple's [[RAOP|Remote Audio Output Protocol]] (RAOP), a proprietary variant of [[RTSP]]/[[Real-time Transport Protocol|RTP]]. Using [[Wireless Distribution System|WDS]]-bridging,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2044|title=Apple WDS Setup|publisher=Support.apple.com|date=February 11, 2011|accessdate=March 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the AirPort Express can allow AirPlay functionality (as well as Internet access, file and print sharing, etc.) across a larger distance in a mixed environment of wired and up to 10 wireless clients.

Speakers attached to an AirPort Express or Apple TV can be selected from within the "Remote" iPhone/iPod Touch program, allowing full AirPlay compatibility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/itunes/remote |title=iTunes Remote |publisher=Apple |date=September 13, 2011 |accessdate=March 28, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329190808/http://www.apple.com/itunes/remote/ |archivedate=March 29, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see "Remote control" section below).

This includes Siri, Touchpad, and Home Buttons, along with a now playing screen.

[[File:Apple tv gen 4 remote.jpeg|thumb|The [[Siri Remote|Apple Siri Remote]] is included with the fourth generation Apple TV and later, as well as being sold by itself.|alt=Apple Siri Remote Controller]]
On September 9, 2015, Apple announced the new Siri Remote for the 4th generation Apple TV (although in some territories, Apple have kept the name Apple TV Remote, due to Siri functionality not being enabled on it in that territory).&lt;ref name="Apple not siri remote 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/hk/en/tv/specs|title=Apple TV -Tech Specs - Apple (HK)|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a completely redesigned remote that features dual microphones for [[Siri]] support and a glass touch surface for navigation around the interface by swiping or tapping and scrubbing to fast forward or rewind. Also, it has a menu and home button, a Siri button to invoke Siri, a Play/Pause button, and a Volume Up/Down button to control the volume on the TV. The Siri Remote will communicate with the Apple TV via Bluetooth rather than infrared, removing the requirement of a line-of-sight with the device. This new remote is only supported by the 4th generation Apple TV and later and will not work with earlier generations.

===Siri===
Beginning with the 4th generation Apple TV, the remote includes two microphones and a button to activate [[Siri]]. Siri on the Apple TV has all of the functions of Siri on iOS 9; it can also respond to requests specifically for the TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=9 Siri commands to use with your Apple TV remote |url=https://www.cnet.com/how-to/siri-commands-to-use-with-apple-tv-remote/ |website=CNET |publisher=CNET |accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the viewer can ask Siri to search for a TV show or movie and it will search across multiple different sources to tell the user where the content is available to watch. It can also do things such as Play/Pause,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Everything You Can Say to Siri on the New Apple TV |url=https://fieldguide.gizmodo.com/everything-you-can-say-to-siri-on-the-new-apple-tv-1759487086 |website=Gizmodo |publisher=Gizmodo |accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rewind/Fast Forward, skip back 15 seconds and temporarily turn on captioning when asked "what did he say?" or "what did she say?", open a specific app, and more.

==Software==
===1st generation===
The original Apple TV ran a modified build of [[Mac OS X Tiger|Mac OS X v10.4]] Tiger&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/apple-tv/apple-tv-faq/apple-tv-operating-system-mac-os-x-applications-running-windows-ipod-games.html | title=What operating system do the Apple TV models use? Do they run Mac OS X? Do they run iOS? | publisher=EveryMac | date=April 12, 2013 | accessdate=September 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Apple TV Software 1.0====
Apple TV software 1.0 presented the user with an interface similar to that of [[Front Row (software)|Front Row]]. Like Front Row on the Mac, it presents the user with seven options for consuming content. Movies, TV Shows, Music, Podcasts, Photos, Settings, and Sources. It was a modified version of OS x v10.4 Tiger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=From hobby to hero: The history of Apple TV |url=https://www.cultofmac.com/387297/hobby-hero-history-apple-tv/ |website=Cult of Mac |publisher=Cult of Mac |accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Apple TV Software 2.0====
In February 2008, Apple released a major and free upgrade to the Apple TV, labelled "Take Two"(2.0). This update did away with Front Row and introduced a new interface in which content was organized into six categories, all of which appeared in a large square box on the screen upon startup (movies, TV shows, music, [[YouTube]], podcasts, and photos) and presented in the initial menu, along with a "Settings" option for configuration, including software updates.&lt;ref name="MacNN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

====Apple TV Software 3.0====
In October 2009, Apple released a minor upgrade for the Apple TV called "Apple TV Software 3.0".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Picking the Ultimate Home Entertainment Box: Apple TV 3.0, why it's triple the meh |url=https://www.pcauthority.com.au/news/picking-the-ultimate-home-entertainment-box-apple-tv-30-why-its-triple-the-meh-160216 |website=PC Authority Australia |publisher=PC Authority Australia |accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This update replaced the interface in version 2.0 with a new interface which presented seven horizontal columns across the top of the screen for the different categories of content (Movies, TV Shows, Music, Podcasts, Photos, Internet, and Settings).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hands On with Apple TV 3.0 |url=https://www.pcmag.com/g00/feature/245546/hands-on-with-apple-tv-3-0?i10c.encReferrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8%3D&amp;i10c.ua=1&amp;i10c.dv=14 |website=PC Mag |publisher=PC Mag |accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This update also added features such as content filtering, iTunes Extras, new fonts, and a new Internet radio app. The maximum resolution increased in both the 40 GB and 160 GB version to include 1080P.

One new feature in particular was the 'Genius' playlist option allowing for easier and more user friendly playlist creating&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=12 Things You Need To Know About Apple TV 3.0 |url=https://gizmodo.com/5393023/12-things-you-need-to-know-about-apple-tv-30 |website=Gizmodo |publisher=Gizmodo |accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2nd and 3rd generation===
{{see also|tvOS#Version history}}
[[File:Apple TV 5.2.jpg|thumb|alt=The third Apple TV interface|The [[user interface]] used in the third generation Apple TV series featured a [[rounded rectangle]] tile interface.]]
The 2nd and 3rd generation Apple TVs run a version of [[iOS]], rather than the modified Mac OS X of the original model.

The interface on Apple TV Software 4 is similar to that of previous versions, with only minor changes and feature additions throughout. In March 2012, Apple released a major new software update, with the Apple TV 3rd generation, labeled as Apple TV Software 5 (iOS 5.1), which shipped with the new 3rd generation Apple TV. This update completely revised the look of the home screen to make it resemble the icon grid seen on iOS. Instead of 7 columns, content and third-party channels are shown in a tiled grid format, which can be rearranged. Throughout the years, for Apple TV Software 5-6, Apple released minor revisions, content additions, and feature updates.

The Apple TV Software 7.0 features a flat look similar to iOS 7 and OS X Yosemite and adds features such as Peer-To-Peer AirPlay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2013 Apple TV revision gets its first exclusive feature: iOS 8's Peer-to |url=https://9to5mac.com/2014/09/23/peer-to-peer-airplay-apple-tv-ios-8/ |website=9to5mac |publisher=9to5mac |accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Version 8.0 was skipped.

The final OS update for the third-generation Apple TV is Apple TV Software 7.2.2 (iOS 8.4.2) since it does not support tvOS 9.0 or later. However, it does support [[Amazon Video]], which was automatically added to those Apple TVs running 7.2.2 on December 6, 2017.&lt;ref name=amazonvideo&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/12/06/amazon-prime-video-app-available-apple-tv/|title=Amazon Prime Video app rolling out to Apple TV App Store|date=2017-12-06|work=9to5Mac|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===4th and 5th generation===
{{see also|tvOS}}
The fourth generation Apple TV and later run an [[operating system]] called ''[[tvOS]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=These are the most popular apps on Apple's new App Store |url=http://fortune.com/2015/11/02/new-apple-app-store/ |website=Fortune |publisher=Fortune |accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which does not support the earlier generations of Apple TV. It features an app store, allowing third-party app developers to release their own apps on the platform.&lt;ref name="AT ATV4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/09/apple-unveils-huge-apple-tv-upgrade-with-app-store-siri-more|title=Apple unveils 64GB Apple TV for $199, 32GB model for $149|website=[[Ars Technica]]|first=Andrew|last=Cunningham|location=San Francisco, California|date=September 9, 2015|accessdate=September 9, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909224319/http://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/09/apple-unveils-huge-apple-tv-upgrade-with-app-store-siri-more|archivedate=September 9, 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new software also features support for Siri voice control. The tvOS [[software development kit]] (SDK) for developing tvOS apps is included in [[Xcode]] 7.1 and later.&lt;ref name="Apple dev tvos 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/tvos|title=tvOS for Developers|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=September 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new development feature, App Thinning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=APPLE TV IS A RADICAL RETHINKING OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE HARDWARE AND GAMES YOU OWN |url=https://www.polygon.com/features/2015/10/26/9604068/apple-tv-app-size-limit-technology-slicing-tags-200-mb |website=Polygon |publisher=Polygon |accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used in the Apple TV, running on tvOS, due to the storage restrictions of the device (32GB and 64GB) and the dual-use of the [[Flash memory|NAND Flash Memory]] to precache movies from Apple's content servers as well as storage for downloaded applications from the tvOS App Store. Apple's aim is to limit the size of application downloads and steering users towards downloading individual segments of apps in order to better manage storage space. Developers have reacted with criticism towards the download size limits, arguing that it leads to situations where game data is purged and has to be re-downloaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2015/10/26/9604068/apple-tv-app-size-limit-technology-slicing-tags-200-mb|title=Apple TV is a radical rethinking of your relationship with the hardware and games you own|website=Polygon|accessdate=November 3, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027132144/http://www.polygon.com/features/2015/10/26/9604068/apple-tv-app-size-limit-technology-slicing-tags-200-mb|archivedate=October 27, 2015|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
===Functionality===
Apple TV contains neither a TV tuner nor a [[digital video recorder|personal video recorder]].&lt;ref name=arsReview /&gt;&lt;ref name=rogueReview/&gt; Both capabilities can be applied to the connected home computer through various third-party products, such as allowing PVR software to connect to iTunes and enable scheduled HDTV recordings to play automatically via Apple TV for playback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuaw.com/2007/04/18/elgato-releases-eyetv-2-4-update|title=Elgato releases EyeTV 2.4 update|first=Erica|last=Sadun|date=April 18, 2007|publisher=The Unofficial Apple Weblog|accessdate=April 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Front Row (software)|Front Row]] interface lacks some iTunes functionality, including rating items, checking the account balance, adding funds to the account, synchronizing from more than one computer,&lt;ref name="Chartier"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuaw.com/2007/03/29/apple-tv-what-you-cant-do|title=Apple TV: What you can't do|first=David|last=Chartier|date=March 29, 2007|publisher=The Unofficial Apple Weblog|accessdate=April 4, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502012513/http://www.tuaw.com/2007/03/29/apple-tv-what-you-cant-do|archivedate=May 2, 2007|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; full [[Internet radio]] support,&lt;ref name=CNNReview/&gt;&lt;ref name=score30&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roughlydrafted.com/2009/02/05/how-apple-tv-can-score-at-the-big-30|title=How Apple TV can score at the big 3.0|first=Daniel Eran|last=Dilger|date=February 5, 2009|publisher=RoughlyDrafted Magazine|accessdate=March 17, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209141624/http://www.roughlydrafted.com/2009/02/05/how-apple-tv-can-score-at-the-big-30|archivedate=February 9, 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2007/03/07/apple-tv-might-have-games-eventually|title=Apple TV might have games, eventually|first=Justin|last=Berka|date=March 7, 2007|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=July 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Movies rented on Apple TV must be watched on Apple TV, unlike iTunes rentals, which can be transferred to any video-enabled iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV.&lt;ref name=HowToRentMovies&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1498 |title=How to rent a movie from the iTunes Store on Apple TV |date=December 1, 2008 |publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] |accessdate=March 12, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227161531/http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1498 |archivedate=February 27, 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1415|title=iTunes Store movie rental usage rights in the United States|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|date=December 17, 2008|accessdate=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Movies purchased on Apple TV can be moved to a video-enabled iPod or iPhone via iTunes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/01/16/itunes-and-apple-tv-rentals-and-purchases-what-you-can-and-can/4 |title=iTunes and Apple TV rentals and purchases: what you can (and can't) do |first=Ryan |last=Block |date=January 16, 2008 |work=[[Engadget]] |accessdate=March 17, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524061423/http://www.engadget.com/2008/01/16/itunes-and-apple-tv-rentals-and-purchases-what-you-can-and-can/4 |archivedate=May 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple TV prior to 4th generation does not support the [[Consumer Electronics Control|HDMI Consumer Electronics Control]] ([[HDMI CEC]]) protocol.

On the Apple TV (2nd generation), digital output audio is up-sampled to 48&amp;nbsp;kHz, including [[lossless compression|lossless]] CD rips at [[44,100 Hz|44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz]]. Although this is a higher frequency and the difference is not audible in most cases, it falls short of digital transmission of data standards due to the audio not being 'bit perfect'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avhub.com.au/editors-blog/sound-image/all-about-the-numbers-396105 |title=All about the numbers... |publisher=AVHub.com.au |date=February 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sales==
===1st generation===
Within the first week of presales in January 2007, Apple TV was the top pre-selling item at the [[Apple Store (online)|Apple Store]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/07/01/17/briefly_apple_tv_tops_best_seller_list_at_apple_store.html|title=Apple TV tops best seller list at Apple Store|date=January 17, 2007|publisher=[[Apple rumors community#AppleInsider|AppleInsider]]|accessdate=July 18, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629123222/http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/07/01/17/briefly_apple_tv_tops_best_seller_list_at_apple_store.html|archivedate=June 29, 2007|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orders exceeded 100,000 units by the end of January and Apple began ramping-up to sell over a million units before the 2007 holiday season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://applerecon.wordpress.com/2007/01/24/apple-tv-blowing-away-expectations|title=Apple TV Blowing Away Expectations|author=staff|date=January 24, 2007|publisher=Apple Recon|accessdate=September 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts began calling it a "[[DVD]] killer"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redherring.com/Home/21384 |title=Apple TV: DVD Killer? |first=Scott |last=Martin |date=February 20, 2007 |publisher=redherring.com |accessdate=July 18, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202061205/http://redherring.com/Home/21384 |archivedate=February 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that could enable multiple services. Analysts also predicted that Apple could sell up to 1.5&amp;nbsp;million units in the first year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wealthdaily.com/articles/apple+tv-itunes-cable+tv/926|title=Apple's Next Evolution|first=Steve|last=Christ|date=March 22, 2007|work=Wealth Daily|accessdate=March 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the [[Apple Store (retail)|Apple Store]], [[Best Buy]] was one of the first retailers to carry the device;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-6169447-7.html|title=Best Buy finagles Apple TV exclusive|first=Erica|last=Ogg|date=March 21, 2007|publisher=[[CNET]]|accessdate=July 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Target Corporation|Target]] and [[Costco]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2007/04/apple-tv-shows-up-at-target-and-costco.ars|title=Apple TV shows up at Target and...Costco?|first=Jacqui|last=Cheng|date=April 30, 2007|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=June 18, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604004621/http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2007/04/apple-tv-shows-up-at-target-and-costco.ars|archivedate=June 4, 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed shortly thereafter.

Two months into sales, [[Forrester Research]] predicted at the time that Apple would only sell a million Apple TV units, because consumers prefer  advertisement-supported content over paid content. Forrester predicted that cable companies would be the clear winners over content providers such as the iTunes Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alwayson.goingon.com/permalink/post/14156 |title=Apple TV Sales Will Stall at 1 Million |first=Andy |last=Plesser |date=May 24, 2007 |publisher=AlwaysOn |accessdate=July 18, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013154449/http://alwayson.goingon.com/permalink/post/14156 |archivedate=October 13, 2007 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, Apple released YouTube functionality and Jobs stated that Apple TV was a "DVD player for the Internet". Some market analysts predicted that YouTube on Apple TV "provides a glimpse of this product's potential and its future evolution",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/analysts-now-see-apple-tv/story.aspx?guid=%7B85872984-D593-455E-A994-7E706216B603%7D|title=Apple boosts analysts' hopes for Apple TV|first=Rex|last=Crum|date=May 31, 2007|work=[[MarketWatch]]|publisher=[[CBS]]|accessdate=July 18, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703074522/http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/analysts-now-see-apple-tv/story.aspx?guid=%7B85872984-D593-455E-A994-7E706216B603%7D|archivedate=July 3, 2007|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; but overall, analysts had mixed reactions regarding the future of Apple TV. Some negative reactions followed after Jobs referred to the device as a "hobby", implying it was less significant than the Macintosh, iPod, and iPhone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2007/05/30/steve-jobs-live-from-d-2007|title=Steve Jobs live from D 2007|first=Ryan|last=Block|date=May 30, 2007|work=[[Engadget]]|accessdate=June 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fourth quarter of 2008, sales were triple that of the fourth quarter of 2007.&lt;ref name=Sales&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roughlydrafted.com/2009/01/21/apple-tv-sales-up-threefold-will-see-continued-investment|title=Apple TV sales up threefold, will see continued investment|first=Prince|last=McLean|date=January 21, 2009|publisher="RoughlyDrafted Magazine"|accessdate=March 14, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201012512/http://www.roughlydrafted.com/2009/01/21/apple-tv-sales-up-threefold-will-see-continued-investment|archivedate=February 1, 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Apple's first-quarter 2009 financial results conference call, acting chief executive Tim Cook stated that Apple TV sales increased three times over the same quarter a year ago. Cook mentioned that the movie rental business was working well for Apple, Apple would continue investment in movie rentals and Apple TV, but Apple TV is still considered a hobby for the company.&lt;ref name=Sales/&gt;  Due to the growth of digital TV and consumers turning to Internet media services, an analyst at the time predicted sales of 6.6 million Apple TVs by the end of 2009.&lt;ref name=plandvr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/is-apple-planning-a-dvr-and-web-enabled-tv-set--559416|title=Is Apple planning a DVR and web-enabled TV set?|date=March 2, 2009|publisher=TechRadar.com|accessdate=March 18, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306090917/http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/is-apple-planning-a-dvr-and-web-enabled-tv-set--559416|archivedate=March 6, 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2nd generation===
The second generation sold 250,000 units in the first two weeks it was available. On December 21, 2010, Apple announced that they had sold 1 million units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Apple Stock Watch|url=http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/apple_tv_sales_hit_250000_in_q4/|title=Apple TV Sales Hit 250,000 in Q4|publisher=MacObserver|accessdate=March 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second fiscal quarter of 2011, it had topped 2 million in total sales, with 820,000 sold in that quarter alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/19/total_shipments_of_new_apple_tv_top_2_million_820k_sold_last_quarter_report.html AppleInsider: Total shipments of new Apple TV top 2 million, 820K sold last quarter&amp;nbsp;– report. April 19, 2011.] Apple TV Second Generation holds 32 Percent of Internet Connected TV Markets&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 24, 2012, Apple announced they had sold 1.4 million units in the first fiscal quarter of 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maximejohnson.com/techno/2012/01/apple-q1-2012-un-autre-trimestre-record-pour-apple|title=Apple Q1 2012: le trimestre de tous les records|publisher=Maximejohnson.com |accessdate=March 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2.8 million units in all of fiscal year 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/321818-apple-s-ceo-discusses-q1-2012-results-earnings-call-transcript |title=Apple's CEO Discusses Q1 2012 Results - Earnings Call Transcript |accessdate=April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (4.2 million units through January 1, 2012).

===3rd generation===
Tim Cook announced at the [[All Things Digital]] conference in May 2012 that Apple had sold 2.7 million of the 3rd generation model in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technobuffalo.com/companies/apple/apple-tv-has-sold-2-7-million-units-this-year-says-tim-cook |title=Apple TV has Sold 2.7 Million Units This Year, Says Tim Cook |accessdate=April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Q4 FY2012 earnings call, [[Engadget]] reported comments from Tim Cook that Apple had shipped 1.3 million Apple TV units in the 4th Quarter (presumed to be 3rd generation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/10/25/apple-q4-2012-earnings-35-97-billion-in-revenue-8-67-eps/ |title=Apple Q4 2012 earnings: $36 billion in revenue, $8.2 billion net profit |accessdate=April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacObserver reported statements by Tim Cook in the Q1 FY2013 earnings call that Apple sold over 2 million Apple TV units in the December Quarter (presumed to be 3rd generation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://liveblog.macobserver.com/ |title=Apple Earnings Report Q1 - 2013 on January 23rd, 2013 |accessdate=April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These reports lead to a cumulative volume of the 3rd generation device of 6 million units, as of January 1, 2013.

On February 28, 2014, at Apple's shareholders meeting, Apple CEO [[Tim Cook]] announced that in 2013 Apple TV brought in 1 billion dollars of revenue for Apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/02/28/us-apple-tv-idUKBREA1R1O420140228|title=Apple CEO promises new products, says Apple TV no longer a 'hobby'|agency=Reuters UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A market survey published by Parks Associates in December 2014 found that Apple TV has lost consumer traction to [[Chromecast|Google Chromecast]], garnering only a 17% market share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rapidtvnews.com/2014120336299/apple-tv-fades-away-in-streaming-video-player-market.html |title=Apple TV fades away in streaming video player market |publisher=Rapid TV News|date=December 3, 2014 |accessdate=December 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Cook announced at the [[Apple Watch]] conference on March 9, 2015, that Apple had sold a total of 25 million Apple TVs up to that point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gigaom.com/2015/03/08/apple-watch-launch-live-blog-spring-forward/ |title=Live blog: The Apple Watch |accessdate=March 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===4th generation===
In the January 27, 2016, Apple earnings call, CEO Tim Cook stated that the Apple TV had record sales. However, no specific sales figures were mentioned; Apple TV is included in an "Other products" category, which also includes the [[Apple Watch]], [[iPod]]s, and [[Beats Electronics|Beats]] products, and is not broken down by individual products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macrumors.com/2016/01/26/apple-watch-apple-tv-record-sales/|title=Apple Watch and Apple TV See Record Quarterly Sales|date=January 26, 2016|author1=Juli Clover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Assault Heroes''''' is an arcade-style, [[Shoot 'em up|top-down shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[Wanako Games]]. The game has the player driving [[4x4]] vehicles, piloting [[speedboat]]s, or proceeding on foot against enemy hordes. Players can play alone or co-operatively, including both online and offline 2-player co-operative modes.

''Assault Heroes'' was originally available as an [[Xbox Live Arcade]] title. On March 19, 2008, its price was lowered when the game joined the Arcade Hits lineup. A [[Microsoft Windows]] retail version was released on October 23, 2007 and the PS3 retail version was added to the [[PlayStation Network]] on January 28, 2010 by [[Konami]] exclusively in the United States. As of today, the PS3 digital version is no longer available for purchase.

==Story==
Originally designed as an Xbox Live Arcade title, ''Assault Heroes'' features only minimal story elements.  According to the game, the player controls "the last surviving member of an elite forces unit" searching for a secret enemy [[laboratory]].  Once located (near the end of the game), the goal is to destroy the lab and escape.

==Gameplay==
Over the course of the game (which is very similar to the 1987 [[video game]] ''[[Time Soldiers]]''), players battle through five progressively more difficult levels.  In addition to countless lesser foes, each level generally contains several "[[boss (video games)|bosses]]" which must be defeated in order to proceed.  Using the left [[thumbstick]] to move and the right thumbstick to aim/shoot (when playing on the Xbox 360 &amp; PS3), players dodge enemy fire while inflicting damage upon foes utilizing three primary weapons:

* [[Minigun]] - A traditional [[machine gun]] with a high rate of fire.
* [[Flak cannon]] - A cannon that, while slow, can produce devastating results.
* [[Flamethrower]] - A short-ranged weapon that continuously spews flame.

Player vehicles have access to these primary weapons at all times and can switch between them with a button press.  Weapons have unlimited [[ammunition]], although the flamethrower will "cut out" briefly if used without interruption for a period of time.  Each weapon can be upgraded (up to three times) by collecting an appropriate [[power-up]] during play, although upgrades are lost if the player is killed.

Vehicle health depletes when damage is taken, but slowly replenishes over time.  If a vehicle is destroyed, players are not immediately killed, but are instead thrown from the vehicle and must proceed on foot.  While on foot, players are exceptionally frail and have only a small machine gun with which to defend themselves.  If a player lacking a vehicle survives for a certain period of time, a new vehicle is automatically delivered and can be immediately boarded.  Players can also temporarily leave their vehicle of their own free will, usually to collect [[power-up]]s which are not accessible from within a vehicle.

===Special weapons===
In addition to the standard weapons which vehicles are equipped with, players also have access to a limited number of ''[[grenade]]s'' and ''[[nuclear weapon|nukes]]''.  Grenades are "thrown" from the current position towards a crosshair, and inflict heavy damage on anything they hit.  Nukes (referred to as "smart bombs" in many other titles) explode in an area around the player, causing massive carnage to everything caught within the blast radius.

Additional quantities of both weapon types can be found and collected as power-ups during the game, with grenades being substantially more plentiful than nukes.

===Bonus areas===
Each level features a single underground bonus area.  These are accessed by entering a specially-marked structure, which then transports the player(s) into an underground bunker.  While underground, players are always on foot, and hence are easily killed.  However, if players do die during these bonus sections, no life is actually lost; instead, players are immediately returned to the main (above ground) level and continue as before.

At the end of each underground area is an extra life (or "[[1-up]]"), earned for successfully completing the sub-level.

===Multiplayer play===
When playing with two players, both players share the same screen and work co-operatively to destroy enemy forces.  Players cannot harm each other directly, although they can scroll (or refuse to scroll) the screen in a manner which can be problematic for the other player.  The game does not increase or otherwise change the quantity and difficulty level of enemy forces based on the presence of a second player.  As a result, having a second player can make gameplay somewhat easier.

Players can play multiplayer either offline, or online via [[Xbox Live]] or [[PlayStation Network|PSN]].  When playing offline, high scores are not recorded on the leaderboards for either player if one of the players is using a local account.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5630">[[File:Balloon vendor.JPG|thumb|200px|A balloon artist in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]]]
'''Balloon modelling''' or '''balloon twisting''' is the shaping of special modelling [[balloon]]s into almost any given shape, often a '''balloon animal'''. People who create balloon animals and other twisted balloon sculptures are called Twisters, Balloon Benders and Balloon Artists. Twisters often perform in restaurants, at birthday parties, fairs and at public and private events or functions.

Two of the primary design styles are "single balloon modelling", which restricts itself to the use of one balloon per model, and "multiple balloon modelling", which uses more than one balloon. Each style has its own set of challenges and skills, but few twisters who have reached an intermediate or advanced skill level limit themselves to one style or another. Depending on the needs of the moment, they might easily move between the one-balloon or multiple approaches, or they might even incorporate additional techniques such as "weaving" and "stuffing". Modelling techniques have evolved to include a range of very complex moves, and a highly specialized vocabulary has emerged to describe the techniques involved and their resulting creations.

Some twisters inflate their balloons with their own lungs, and for many years this was a standard and necessary part of the act. However, many now use a pump of some sort, whether it is a hand pump, an electric pump plugged in or run by a battery pack, or a compressed gas tank containing air or nitrogen. Twisters do not generally fill their creations with helium, as these designs will not usually float anyway. The balloons for twisting are too porous for helium and the designs are generally too heavy for their size for helium to lift.

==Origins==
[[File:Herman Bonnert "Balloon Tricks".jpg|thumb|Herman J. Bonnert circa 1934 at a magic convention, showing some his creations for his "Balloon Tricks" act.]]
The origins of balloon modelling are unknown. The 1975 book by "Jolly the Clown" Petri credits "Herman Bonnert from Pennsylvania at a magician's convention in 1939" as being the first balloontwister.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, Ralph. [http://www.balloonhq.com/column/dewey/aug06/ Balloon History] BalloonHQ Column. Accessed 10/5/07&lt;/ref&gt; Val Andrews, in ''Manual of Balloon Modeling, Vol. 1, An Encyclopedic Series'', credits H.J. Bonnert of [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] as being the "daddy of them all".&lt;ref name = "history"&gt;Andrew, Val. ''Manual of Balloon Modeling, Vol. 1, An Encyclopedic Series'' 1981, Magico Magazine, NYC quoted on [http://www.balloonhq.com/faq/history.html Balloon History] BalloonHQ. Accessed 10/5/07&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Church III states, "Frank Zacone from Youngstown, Ohio was doing a balloon act during the 1940s and had been doing the act for some time."&lt;ref name = "history"/&gt;  Another candidate for first balloon twister is [[Henry Maar]].&lt;ref name="Joe"&gt;Maar, Joseph.[http://www.tmyers.com/marr.html The Story of Henry Maar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930075403/http://www.tmyers.com/marr.html |date=2007-09-30 }} TMyers.com 6/20/06 Accessed 10/5/07&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Smurf Parody Hats.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Smurf]] Parody hats made with 360 balloons.]]
Two essential items are required for balloon twisting:
* An assortment of balloons, usually in various [[colors]]. Balloon sizes are usually identified by a number: the most common size of twisting balloons is called a "260", as it is approximately two inches in diameter and 60&amp;nbsp;inches long. Thus, a "260" is 2×60 inches and a "160" is 1×60 inches when fully blown up. Although these are the most common sizes used, there are dozens of other shapes available as well.
* An inflation device. The most common methods are [[air pump]]s similar to [[bicycle pump]]s, electric [[air compressor]]s, and via the mouth. Inflating a balloon via the mouth is difficult and can be dangerous. Particularly well-trained and talented twisters, however, can blow-up several balloons at once, and some can even blow up 160s, which are much more difficult to mouth-inflate than the more common 260s, as their narrowness requires a great deal more strength and breath pressure to inflate.

==Common models==
===Single balloon===
*Basic four-legged animal: Three locking twists. The first forms nose, ears/face, and neck; the second, front legs and body; the third, back legs and tail. Different proportions can be used to represent a [[dachshund]], a [[giraffe]], etc.
*Elephant: A hook twist trunk followed by a bean twist face and two large "elephant ear" twists, finished with two locking twists as above.
*Monkey
*Bear
*Helmet: Three bubble roll through sized to fit a person's head.
*Sword: Twofold twists form the cross piece, with one short and one long bubble forming the handle and blade.
*Tommy gun

===Multiple balloon===
*Characters
*Monkey on palm tree
*Penguins
*Big dog
*Bear on heart
*Octopus
*Flowers
*Mask to wear
*Tortoise

'''''Bloodforge''''' is a [[third-person view]] [[hack and slash]] [[action game]] developed by [[Climax Studios]], [[Microsoft Studios (game studio)|Microsoft Studios]] and Imagination Studios, and published by Microsoft Studios for [[Xbox Live Arcade]] in 2012. The game follows a warrior named Crom, who lusts for revenge against the [[Celtic pantheon|Celtic gods]] that betrayed his life of peace, making him slay his own family.

==Gameplay==
''Bloodforge'' is a [[hack and slash]] game in which the player must combat his enemies with an array of weaponry. The player uses an equipped weapon to attack opponents until they are defeated or get until they get disoriented (signaled by an icon on the head), where Crom can then perform a gruesome finishing move on the opponent. This gives the player more Blood which is the currency in the game. The more damage done to the enemy, the more Blood that is spilled, thereby rewarding the player with excessive amounts of Blood that can be then be used for purchasing upgrades for special abilities. The main weapons of the game are sword, war hammer, claws, and crossbow. All which have three available weapon upgrades. The Health Bar is shown at the top left of the screen in green, along with a Rage bar in red. Health and a variety of Runes can be found in breakable cairns, the player can also find [[Magic point|Mana]] runes which recharge the Rune Bar.

==Plot==
Crom is a powerful and brute Celtic warrior who abandoned his life of battle to dwell in comfort with his beautiful wife, Alena. The story begins with Crom on a hunting trip as he dreams a horrific encounter with [[Arawn]], the king of the netherworld realm of [[Annwn]]. Crom hastily returns home, only to find his village seemingly attacked by demons. Crom, consumed with rage, begins searching for his beloved Alena, he drives his sword into yet another demon, which transforms back into Alena. Disoriented and stricken with grief, Crom encounters the goddess [[Morrigan]], who then leads him to the shrine of his ancestors, where he finds a mysterious gauntlet. She informs Crom that if he wants to exact his vengeance upon the god, he must traverse the Bloodforge. Crom accepts his overturn with fate and unleashes his unrelenting fury on all those who oppose him. Crom ventures off to discover the Bloodforge, massacre legions of demons, warriors, monsters, and butcher the very gods who betrayed him, including Aerten, the goddess of fate.

==History==
''Bloodforge'' was developed by [[Climax Studios]] who collaborated with [[Microsoft]] to work on the game to only be released on [[Xbox 360]] for the [[Xbox Live Arcade]]. After the game was completed, Microsoft decided to publish the game themselves and complete it under [[Microsoft Studios (game studio)|Microsoft Studios]]. ''Bloodforge'' was then released on April 25, 2012 on XBLA. An update on July 27 dramatically improved the camera, re-balanced difficulty and corrected issues with awards and achievements not unlocking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christine Mitchell|url=http://www.xblafans.com/bloodforge-reforged-with-new-title-update-53717.html|title=Bloodforge reforged with new title update|publisher=xblafans |date=2012-08-27 |accessdate=2014-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Critical reception towards the game was generally unfavourable. ''Bloodforge'' received a low rating of only 42/100 at review aggregation website [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name = Metacritic&gt;{{cite web |author=Metacritic staff |title=Bloodforge for Xbox 360 reviews |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/bloodforge |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''broadcasting of sports events''' (also known as a '''sportscast''') is the live coverage of [[sport]]s as a [[television program]], on [[radio]], and other [[broadcasting]] media.  It usually involves one or more [[sports commentator]]s describing the events as they happen.

==By country==

===Canada===
{{See also|East Coast bias}}
Broadcasting of sports started with descriptions of play sent via [[telegraphy|telegraph]] in the 1890s. In 1896, a telegraph line was connected to the [[Victoria Rink]] in [[Montreal]] to update fans in [[Winnipeg]] of the [[Stanley Cup]] challenge series between Montreal and Winnipeg [[ice hockey]] teams. In 1923, the first radio broadcast of an ice hockey game took place on 8 February, with the broadcast of the third period of a game between Midland and North Toronto of the [[Ontario Hockey Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Mr. Kitchen, p.246&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that month, the first full-game broadcast took place in Winnipeg. That same season, hockey broadcasting pioneer [[Foster Hewitt]] made his first broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Hewitt called a [[Canada]]-wide radio broadcast of an NHL game between the [[Detroit Red Wings]] and the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]].  Always starting the broadcast with "Hello, Canada, and hockey fans in the United States and [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]]!"; this phrase stuck around (albeit without the "Newfoundland" portion after the dominion confederated into Canada in 1949) all the way to [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC's]] first national television broadcast (the first actual broadcast was on [[Closed-circuit television|closed-circuit]] in [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in Spring 1952) of ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'' in October 1952.  Today it is consistently among the highest-rated programs in Canada.

Broadcasting of the [[Canadian Football League]] has been a fixture of Canadian television since the CBC's debut in 1952. From 1962 (one year after the debut of [[CTV Television Network|CTV]]) through 2007, there were two separate CFL contracts: one for CBC, and one for CTV (or a sister channel such as cable outlet [[The Sports Network|TSN]]). Terrestrial television broadcasts of CFL games ended in 2008, when TSN acquired exclusive TV rights to the league.

American sports broadcasts are widely available in Canada, both from Canadian stations and from [[border blaster]]s in the United States. In order to protect Canadian broadcasters' advertising, broadcast stations can invoke [[simultaneous substitution]]: any cable or satellite feed of an American station broadcasting the same program as a Canadian broadcast station must be [[blackout (broadcasting)|blacked out]] and replaced by the Canadian feed. This rule is part of the reason the NFL, which is broadcast on terrestrial television in the United States but has no direct presence in Canada, is also broadcast on terrestrial TV in Canada, while the CFL no longer is (the CFL is broadcast only on cable in the United States); the simultaneous substitution benefits are not extended to cable stations. For the purposes of [[regional sports network|regional sports broadcasting]], the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] and [[Toronto Raptors]] both claim all of Canada as their "territory," allowing Blue Jays and Raptors games to be broadcast nationwide.

===Ireland===
The first live commentary on a field sport anywhere in Europe was when Paddy Mehigan covered the All-Ireland Hurling Semi-Final between Kilkenny and Galway on 29 August 1926. This game is credited with being the first mainly because the BBC was prevented from broadcasting sporting events before 7.00pm as a means of protecting British newspaper sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/archives/exhibitions/1411-radio-sports-commentary/1412-early-years-of-broadcasting/|title=The Early Years of Broadcasting|author=|date=|website=rte.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The first sports event broadcast in the United Kingdom was a [[Rugby union|Rugby Union]] international between [[England national rugby union team|England]] and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]], broadcast from [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]] in January 1927. Two weeks later the first broadcast of a [[association football|football]] match took place, with the BBC covering [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal's]] league fixture against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] at [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]]. Listeners to the broadcast could use numbered grids published in the Radio Times in order to ascertain in which area of the pitch the action was taking place due to a second commentator reading out grid references during the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/ggm-40-highbury-stages-first-live-broadcast |title=GGM 40: Highbury stages first live broadcast |publisher=Arsenal.com |date=2007-08-02 |accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Kingdom saw the first live television broadcast of a [[association football|football]] match, with the BBC showing a specially arranged fixture between Arsenal and Arsenal Reserves on 16 September 1937.

The British media is dominated by national outlets, with local media playing a much smaller role. Traditionally the [[BBC]] played a dominant role in televising sport, providing extensive high-quality advertisement free coverage and free publicity in exchange for being granted broadcast rights for low fees. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] broadcast a smaller portfolio of events, and [[Channel 4]] broadcast a few events from the 1980s, mainly horse races and so-called minority sports. In the early 1990s this arrangement was shaken up by the arrival of [[pay-TV]] in the form of BSkyB.  Their dedicated sports channels have since become the only place for some major sports to be seen. Starting in 2006 the Irish company [[Setanta Sports]] emerged as a challenger to Sky Sports' dominance of the British pay-TV sports market; however, Setanta's UK channel went into bankruptcy administration and off the air in 2009. Between 2009 and 2013 [[ESPN Inc.|ESPN]] made [[BT Sport ESPN|an attempt]] to challenge Sky Sports before its British operations were bought out by Sky's current main competitor, [[BT Sport]]; a subsidiary of the former national telecommunications monopoly [[BT plc]].  There are also a dedicated UK version of [[Eurosport]], called British Eurosport, and [[Eleven Sports]].

Radio sports coverage is also important. [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] broadcasts almost all major sports events. It now has a commercial rival called [[Talksport]], but this has not acquired anywhere near as many exclusive contracts as [[Sky Sports]] and dedicates much of its airtime to sports discussions and phone-ins; [[Absolute Radio]] has also begun acquiring sports rights. [[BBC Local Radio]] also provides extensive coverage of sport, giving more exposure to second-tier clubs which get limited national coverage.

===United States===
National and local media both serve major roles in broadcasting [[sports in the United States]]. Depending on the league and event, telecasts are often shown live on [[network television]] (traditionally on weekends and during major events {{emdash}} either national through a [[Television network]], or in some cases, regionally [[Television syndication|syndicated]] by an operation such as [[Raycom Sports]] or a team), and nationally available [[cable channel]]s (such as [[ESPN (United States)|ESPN]] or [[Fox Sports 1]]). In some leagues (such as the [[NHL]] and the [[NBA]]), events are also primarily shown by [[regional sports network]]s groups (such as [[Fox Sports Networks]]), networks which air telecasts for teams of local interest, which are usually only carried within the relevant market. Additionally, cable channels also exist that are dedicated to specific types of sports, certain [[college sports]] conferences, or a specific league. [[Pay-per-view]] broadcasts are typically restricted to combat sports such as boxing, mixed martial arts or professional wrestling.

Radio broadcasts are extensive. The national leagues each have national network coverage of league high games in addition to local radio coverage originating with each team, with [[ESPN Radio]] and [[Westwood One (current)|WestwoodOne]] controlling national rights to the major team sports and the motorsports circuits operating their own networks. Local radio broadcasts cover a wide variety of sports, ranging from the majors to local school and recreational leagues.

Internet broadcasts are also common, though college and major professional sports either use a [[pay wall]] or subscriber-based systems such as [[TV Everywhere]] to extract payment. Telephone broadcasts are rare, although a few companies provide the service.

==== History ====
In 1911, more than 1,000 people gathered in downtown [[Lawrence, Kansas]] to watch a mechanical reproduction of the [[1911 Kansas vs. Missouri football game]] while it was being played.  A [[Western Union]] telegraph wire was set up direct from [[Columbia, Missouri]].  A group of people then would announce the results of the previous play and used a large model of a football playing field to show the results.  Those in attendance cheered as though they were watching the game live, including the school's legendary ''[[Rock Chalk, Jayhawk]]'' cheer.&lt;ref name="mech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2011/nov/27/100-years-ago-football-fans-enjoy-mechanized-repro/?print|publisher=[[Lawrence Journal-World]]|accessdate=27 December 2011|title=100 years ago: Football fans enjoy mechanized reproduction of KU-MU game|date=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first voice broadcast of a sporting event took place on 11 April 1921 when Westinghouse station [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]] in [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] broadcast a 10-round, no decision [[boxing|boxing match]] between [[Johnny Dundee]] and Johnny Ray at Pittsburgh's [[Motor Square Garden]].&lt;ref name="RadioFirst"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kdka.cbslocal.com/2010/04/01/kdka-firsts/|title=KDKA Firsts|year=2010|publisher=KDKA|accessdate=8 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, an experimental [[telegraphy|telegraph]] broadcast of the 1919 [[State Farm Lone Star Showdown|Lone Star Showdown]] was held on Thanksgiving Day of that year on experimental station 5XB, the predecessor of [[WTAW (AM)|WTAW]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w5ac.tamu.edu/5xb.php |title=First Play-By-Play Football Broadcast |publisher=W5AC |date= |accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[Major League Baseball on the radio|radio broadcast of a baseball game]] occurred on 5 August 1921 over KDKA from Pittsburgh's [[Forbes Field]].  Harold W. Arlin announced a game between the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] and the [[Philadelphia Phillies]].  Two months later, on 8 October 1921, from the same Forbes Field, Arlin announced the [[1921 West Virginia vs. Pittsburgh football game|first live radio broadcast]] of a college football game on KDKA when he gave the play-by-play action of the [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|University of Pittsburgh]] victory over [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia University]].

On 17 May 1939, the United States' first televised sporting event, a college baseball game between the [[Columbia Lions]] and [[Princeton Tigers]], was broadcast by [[NBC]] from Columbia's [[Robert K. Kraft Field at Lawrence A. Wien Stadium|Baker Field]].&lt;ref name="MBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=sportsandte|title=SPORTS AND TELEVISION|year=2008|publisher=Museum of Broadcast Communications|accessdate=30 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CCT"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct_archive/spr99/34a.html|title=Baker Field: Birthplace of Sports Television|last=Koppett|first=Leonard|date=Spring 1999|work=Columbia College Today|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=30 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The world's first live televised sporting event had been the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin.&lt;ref name="TVHistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvhistory.tv/1936%20German%20Olympics%20TV%20Program.htm|title=1936 German Olympics|year=2010|publisher=Television History|accessdate=17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  On 30 September 1939, the first [[American football]] game, a college contest between [[1939 Waynesburg vs. Fordham football game|Fordham and Waynesburg College]] was broadcast on television.&lt;ref name="FirstSportsTV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsknowhow.com/football/history/football-history-4.shtml|title=Sports Knowhow|year=2010|publisher=Sports Knowhow|accessdate=8 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first nationwide broadcast of college football, which was also the first live sporting event seen coast-to-coast, was a game between [[Duke Blue Devils football|Duke University]] and the University of Pittsburgh that was televised by NBC on 29 September 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MqLdmm6zT8YC&amp;lpg=PA50%5C&amp;ots=owIESUpRKR&amp;pg=PA50 | editor-first=Paul M. | editor-last=Pedersen | editor2-first=Janet B. | editor2-last=Parks | editor3-first=Jerome | editor3-last=Quarterman | editor4-first=Lucie | editor4-last=Thibault | title=Contemporary Sport Management | edition=4th | publisher=Human Kinetics | location=Champaign, IL | year=2011 | page=50 | ISBN=978-0-7360-8167-2 | accessdate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[College football on television|broadcasting of college football games]] on television in the United States has been a fixture of the major networks on a continuous basis since that time. The NCAA severely restricted broadcasts of college football from the 1950s until a judge ruled that the action was a violation of antitrust rules in [[NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma|1984]], which allowed for a much greater expansion of college football broadcasting.

NBC broadcast the first televised [[National Football League]] (NFL) game when they carried the 22 October 1939 game between the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] and the [[Brooklyn Dodgers (NFL)|Brooklyn Dodgers]]. The same year, the first nationwide radio broadcast of an NFL championship game was carried on the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]].  While the NFL had weak television deals that ranked behind college football and even the [[Canadian Football League]] in the 1950s, the [[National Football League on television|broadcast rights of the NFL]] would go on to become an important property following the [[1958 NFL Championship Game|1958 NFL Championship]] and the later establishment of the [[American Football League]] in 1960. ''[[Monday Night Football]]'', ''[[NFL on Fox]]'', and ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football]]'' have changed the landscape of American football broadcasts, including the scheduling of the [[Super Bowl]], transforming it from an afternoon broadcast into a primetime spectacle. The price for the NFL's broadcast rights has increased steadily over the past several decades, in part because of bidding wars between the numerous networks and the [[fear of missing out|fear of losing stature]] due to the loss of NFL programming; as of the most recent contract the league nets annual fees of over $6 billion, or half of the league's overall revenue, from television rights alone. Four of the five major sports television units in the United States, and the four companies that control all of the major broadcast networks, currently own some NFL rights.

NBC also broadcast an NHL game in 1940; the league would briefly air games in the 1950s, but due to a dispute over how much of the rights fee money the players would receive (and difficulties programming around the two Canadian teams in the league [[Original Six|at the time]]), the NHL refused to televise its games in the United States for six years in the 1960s. For this reason, as well as the regional nature of the sport, televised NHL games have struggled to gain a foothold on American television for the past several decades, trailing the other leagues in ratings. After several decades of bouncing around various networks (and a stretch from 1975 to 1994 when the league had no permanent broadcast partner), the NHL established a stable broadcast partner in 2004, when [[NHL on NBC|NBC]] and what was then [[NHL on Versus|Outdoor Life Network]] (now [[NBCSN]]) took over NHL broadcast rights; they have since renewed those rights through 2021.

The first-ever television broadcast of a basketball game occurred on 28 February 1940 when the University of Pittsburgh defeated [[Fordham Rams|Fordham]] at [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]] on [[National Broadcasting Corporation|NBC]] station W2XBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.americansportscastersonline.com/sportscastingfirsts.html | title=American Sportscasters Online: Sportscasting firsts | publisher=American Sportscasters Association | accessdate=2012-03-25 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GO9ChSxN?url=http://www.americansportscastersonline.com/sportscastingfirsts.html | archivedate=5 May 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional basketball has been aired on television since 1953, shortly after the founding of the [[National Basketball Association]], and has been aired on television ever since. College basketball, on the other hand, was much later in gaining a television foothold. Although the NCAA Tournament has aired since 1962, it was not until the mid-1970s that regular-season college basketball games would air on major network television.

Outside of the networks, the only other source for national sports television was through early [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] networks. Sports Network Incorporated (SNI), later renamed the [[Hughes Television Network]], carried [[Cleveland Browns]] (NFL) games in the 1950s and NHL games in the late 1970s, after the NHL lost its contract with NBC. [[TVS Television Network]] helped popularize the broadcasts of college basketball and also gave an outlet to the short-lived [[World Football League]]. [[Mizlou Television Network]] earned a reputation for carrying a large number of college football [[bowl game]]s in an era when televised college football was highly restricted. Modern syndication networks still exist for sporting events, such as [[Raycom Sports]] and [[American Sports Network]], both of which specialize in college sports.

The debut of [[ESPN]] in 1979 revolutionized the broadcasting of sports events. Within several years of ESPN's founding as a basic cable channel, it had developed a stable of sports broadcasts ranging from major leagues to oddities. ESPN has since grown into a massive multiplexed network, with several channels and a large news bureau that has led to the network bestowing the title of "Worldwide Leader in Sports" upon itself. Cable, and later digital cable and satellite, greatly expanded the number of channels (and, by extension, the room for broadcasting sports events) available on a given set, and also gave channels such as ESPN the ability to broadcast direct and nationwide, as opposed to dealing with local affiliates. Syndication networks gave way to [[regional sports network]]s, which carried broadcasts of local sports on a far greater scale than full-service broadcast stations could provide at the time; these combined with [[out-of-market sports package]]s (which debuted in the 1990s) allowed the carriage of these networks' sporting events across the country. However, with the increased availability of sports to broadcast came increasing rights fees, which could be recovered by the newly authorized practice of collecting [[retransmission consent]] fees from cable subscribers, which has led to numerous disputes and the dropping of channels from cable lineups. Individual leagues began launching their own networks in the 2000s; specialty networks of other sports have had varying levels of success.

One of the first live high-definition sports broadcasts in the U.S. took place in September 1998 in which a football game between [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]] and [[West Virginia University|West Virginia]], aired on [[WBNS-TV]]. The station claims this to have been the first locally produced HD broadcast in the U.S.; however, as several other stations throughout the country also lay claim to this distinction, the veracity cannot be verified. It is widely considered the first ever live sports game in HD in the U.S. produced using a production truck and transmission vehicle from [[NHK]], [[Japan]]'s national [[public broadcaster|public broadcasting organization]].&lt;ref&gt;NHK: [http://www.nhk.or.jp/pr/english/profile/pforile.html Profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internet has also allowed greater broadcasting of sports events, both in video and audio forms and through free and subscription channels. With an Internet broadcast, even a locally broadcast high school football game can be heard worldwide on any device with an audio output and an Internet connection. Individual leagues (including major ones) all have subscription services that allow subscribers to watch their sporting events for a fee.

One of the first live sporting events in the U.S. to be streamed was the Ohio State spring football game in 2001 by [[WBNS-TV]]. The game was delivered on [[RealVideo]], a compressed video format, on the [[RealPlayer]] media player platform on the station's website. It also was distributed to [[Windows Mobile]] mobile devices using the [[Windows Media Player]] format, including [[Compaq]]'s [[IPAQ]] [[personal digital assistant]] which required an [[ExpressCard]] to connect to the [[Internet]].

==Broadcasting rights and contracts==
{{See also|List of sports television broadcast contracts}}
Broadcasting rights and contracts limit who can show footage of the event.

In the [[United Kingdom]] [[BSkyB]] based its early marketing largely on its acquisition of the broadcast rights of the top division of the [[English league football]], which as part of the deal with [[The Football Association]] broke away from [[English Football League|The Football League]] to become the [[Premier League]]. This prevented the footage of any major Premier League football game being shown on free-to-air television until much later that evening (as highlights), something the [[European Commission]] were very unhappy about. Following warnings of legal action to stop the monopoly, an announcement was made that an alternative structure would be in place when the contract ended in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4444684.stm |title=Football deal ends BSkyB monopoly |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-11-17 |accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], team sports are broadcast by [[Television network|networks]] usually only in "game of the week" or championship situations, except for the NFL (see [[National Football League on television|NFL on television]]) and motorsport.  Other sports are broadcast by [[sports channels]], and are limited by who can view them based on various rules set by the leagues themselves, resulting in [[sports blackout|blackouts]]. These limitations can be legally overlooked by purchasing [[out-of-market sports package]]s, such as MLB Extra Innings or [[NFL Sunday Ticket]]. Regular season games involving local teams (except the NFL) may also be viewed on those local stations or regional sports channels that have a contract to broadcast that team's games.

Events that have been described as "the most watched" per various definitions include the [[FIFA World Cup]], [[Summer Olympic Games]], [[Cricket World Cup]], [[UEFA Champions League]], [[Tour de France]], [[Rugby World Cup]] (rugby union), [[Indian Premier League]], [[Super Bowl]], and the FIA [[Formula One]] World Championship.

===Anti-siphoning laws===
[[File:Ellen van Dijk NED (8597988270).jpg|thumb|[[Ellen van Dijk]] filmed from a motor during the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].]]

In some countries, broadcast regulations referred to as "[[anti-siphoning law]]s" exist in order to ensure that coverage of major sporting events of national importance—often covering major events such as the Olympics, [[FIFA World Cup]], and national team events in culturally-significant sports—are available on free-to-air, terrestrial television, rather than exclusively on pay television. Some larger events (particularly the Olympics) may be covered under rules allowing a portion of the event to be televised by a pay TV partner if a specific minimum of coverage is broadcast free-to-air, or if an extended highlights package is available on a delay to a free-to-air broadcaster.

In the United States, an attempt by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] to introduce similar restrictions on cable broadcasts of specific sporting events and recent films as to not cannibalize broadcast TV, was deemed unconstitutional in the 1977 court case ''[[HBO|Home Box Office, Inc.]] v. FCC''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/567/9/194284/|title=Home Box Office, Inc., Petitioner, v.

These networks receive revenue from both advertising and carriage fees charged to television providers (and passed onto consumers as part of the cost of service), and can provide an outlet for expanded coverage of "niche" events with dedicated audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-sports-channels-20161128-story.html|title=The rise of sports TV costs and why your cable bill keeps going up|last=James|first=Meg|website=latimes.com|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-2000s and early 2010s, most major U.S. sports leagues (barring the [[National Football League]], which has historically stipulated that all games be shown on terrestrial television in at least the markets of the teams involved) had begun to steadily decrease their presence on broadcast television, and allow more of their content (including post-season coverage in many cases) to air on cable networks, and more recently, digital-only outlets. The [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] and national championship games in [[college football]] have also largely moved to cable (since 2016, the semi-finals of the former only air on broadcast television in odd-numbered years).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/ca/other-sports/news/as-sports-shift-from-broadcast-to-cable-digital-may-be-next-frontier/1jlbh6i1la6vv1wrscc256ib5z|title=As sports shift from broadcast to cable, digital may be next frontier|date=2015-03-31|work=Sporting News|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://awfulannouncing.com/espn/major-sporting-events-becoming-even-dispersed-across-television.html|title=Major sporting events are becoming even more dispersed across television|date=2017-03-29|work=Awful Announcing|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/12/if-you-dont-watch-sports-tv-is-a-huge-rip-off-so-how-do-we-fix-it/265814/|title=If You Don't Watch Sports, TV Is a Huge Rip-Off (So, How Do We Fix It?)|last=Thompson|first=Derek|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Team-owned channels ===

Several sports teams in the United States have their own channels, or own shares in other sports networks. For example, the [[Boston Red Sox]] and [[Boston Bruins]] own [[New England Sports Network]], which retains the New England area television broadcast rights for the majority of Red Sox games (except nationally televised games). The [[New York Mets]] own [[SportsNet New York]] jointly with [[Comcast]] and [[Time Warner Cable]]. [[Madison Square Garden]] has its own network as well, [[MSG (TV channel)|MSG]], where they broadcast [[New York Rangers]], [[New York Knicks]], [[New York Islanders]] and high school sports games, as well as original shows. [[Altitude Sports and Entertainment|Altitude]] airs games of all Denver-based teams owned by Kroenke Sports Enterprises. [[Mid-Atlantic Sports Network]] is a partnership between the [[Washington Nationals]] and [[Baltimore Orioles]].

The [[Longhorn Network]], in which ESPN owns a stake, is even more specialized, designed as an outlet for the [[Texas Longhorns|athletic program]] of the [[University of Texas at Austin]] (although it has also aired [[UTSA Roadrunners football|football games]] of the [[University of Texas System|UT system's]] [[University of Texas at San Antonio|San Antonio campus]]).

Team-owned channels are also common in Europe, most notably [[Barça TV]], [[Benfica TV]], [[Galatasaray TV]], [[Manchester United TV]] and [[Real Madrid TV]].

== History ==
Dance has been used therapeutically for thousands of years. It has been used as a healing ritual in the influence of fertility, birth, sickness, and death since early human history. Over the period from 1840 to 1930, a new philosophy of dance developed in Europe and the United States, defined by the idea that movement could have an effect on the mover vis-a-vis that dance was not simply an expressive art.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, H. (1992) "Torque: The new kinaesthetic of the twentieth century". In Crary, J. and S. Kwinter (Ed.) ''Zone 6: Incorporations.'' New York: Urzone {{ISBN|9780942299298}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a general opinion that Dance/movement as active imagination was originated by Jung in 1916,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.routledge.com/Dance-Therapy-and-Depth-Psychology-The-Moving-Imagination/Chodorow/p/book/9780415041133|title=Dance Therapy and Depth Psychology: The Moving Imagination (Paperback) - Routledge|last=Chodorow|first=Joan|date=1991|website=Routledge.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  developed in the 1960s by dance therapy pioneer Mary Whitehouse&lt;nowiki/&gt;. [[Tina Keller-Jenny]] and other therapists started practicing the therapy in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=xywBCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=Authentic+Movement+Tina+Keller#v=onepage&amp;q=Authentic+Movement+Tina+Keller&amp;f=false|title=Authentic Movement: Moving the Body, Moving the Self, Being Moved: A Collection of Essays - Volume Two|last=Pallaro|first=Patrizia|date=2007-01-15|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=1846425867|location=London|pages=33|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual establishment of dance as a therapy and as a profession occurred in the 1950s, beginning with future American Dance Therapy Association founder Marian Chace.&lt;ref name="Strassel 2011 50"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Strassel |first=Juliane |author2=Daniel Cherkin |author3=Lotte Steuten |author4=Karen Sherman |author5=Hubertus Vrijhoef  |title=A Systematic Review of the Evidence for the Effectiveness of Dance Therapy |journal=Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine|date=May–June 2011 |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=50–9 |pmid=22164813}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First wave ===
[[Marian Chace]], spearheaded the movement of dance in the medical community as a form of therapy. She is considered the principal founder of what is now dance therapy in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://www.adta.org/resources/chace_bio.cfm "Who was Marian Chace?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730144237/http://www.adta.org/resources/chace_bio.cfm |date=30 July 2007 }} American Dance Therapy Association.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, through her work, dance was first introduced to western [[medicine]]. Chace was originally a [[dance]]r, [[Choreography|choreographer]], and performer. After opening her own dance school in [[Washington, D.C.]], Chace began to realize the effects [[dance]] and movement had on her students.&lt;ref name="Levy, Fran J. 1988"&gt;Levy, Fran J. '1988) ''Dance Movement Therapy: A Healing Art''. Reston, VA: The American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation, and Dance.&lt;/ref&gt; The reported feelings of wellbeing from her students began to attract the attention of the medical community, and some local doctors began sending patients to her classes. She was soon asked to work at [[St. Elizabeths Hospital|St. Elizabeth’s Hospital]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] once psychiatrists too realized the benefits their patients were receiving from attending Chace’s dance classes.&lt;ref name="cancer.org"&gt;[http://cancer.org/doctoor/MIT/content/MIT_2_3X_Dance_Therapy.asp "Dance Therapy"]. American Cancer Society.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 Chace became the first president of the [[American Dance Therapy Association]], an organization which she and several other DMT pioneers founded.&lt;ref name="Levy, Fran J. 1988" /&gt; According to the ADTA, dance is "the psychotherapeutic use of movement as a process which furthers the emotional, social, cognitive, and physical integration of the individual."

=== Second wave ===
The second wave of Dance Movement Therapy came around the 1970s to the 1980s and it sparked much interest from American therapists. During this time, therapists began to experiment with the psychotherapeutic applications of [[dance]] and movement. As a result of the therapists' experiments, DMT was then categorized as a form of [[psychotherapy]]. It was from this second wave that today’s Dance Movement Therapy evolved.&lt;ref name="Levy, Fran J. 1988" /&gt;

== Principles ==
The theory of DMT is based mainly upon the belief that body and mind interact. Both conscious and unconscious movement of the person, based on the dualist mind body premise, affects total functioning, and also reflects the individual’s personality. Therefore, the therapist-client relationship is partly based on non-verbal cues such as body language. Movement is believed to have a symbolic function and as such can aid in understanding the self. Movement improvisation allows the client to experiment with new ways of being and DMT provides a manner or channel in which the client can consciously understand early relationships with negative stimuli through non-verbal mediation by the therapist.&lt;ref name="Levy, Fran J. 1988" /&gt;

Through the unity of the [[bodymind|body]], [[bodymind|mind]], and [[spirit]], DMT provides a sense of wholeness to all individuals. The body refers to the "discharging of energy through muscular-skeletal responses to stimuli received by the brain." The mind refers to "mental activities...such as memory, imagery, perception, attention, evaluation, reasoning and decision making." The spirit refers to the "subjectively experienced state of feeling in engaging in or empathically observing dancing."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hanna|first1=Judith|title=The Power of Dance: Health and Healing|journal=The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine|date=2007|volume=1|issue=4|pages=323–331|pmid=9395627|doi=10.1089/acm.1995.1.323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dance therapy works to improve the social skills, as well as relational dynamics among the clients that choose to participate in it to better improve their [[quality of life]]. Through this form of therapy clients will gain a deeper sense of self-awareness through a meditative process that involves movement, motion, and realization of one's body. Dance therapy is different from other forms of rehabilitative treatments because it allows creative expression and is more holistic, meaning it treats the full person: mind, body, and spirit.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Meekums, Bonnie, Dance Movement Therapy, (Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications Inc.).&lt;/ref&gt;

== The therapy process ==
The therapy process has four stages, which occur during DMT and can be a creative time for both the therapist and patient(s). Each stage contains a smaller set of goals which correlate to the larger purpose of DMT. The stages and goals of DMT vary with each individual. Although the stages are progressive, the stages are usually revisited several times throughout the entire DMT process. The four stages are:

: Preparation: the warm-up stage, a safe space is established without obstacles nor distractions, a supportive relationship with a witness is formed, comfort for participants to be familiar with moving with their eyes closed.

: Incubation: leader verbally prompts participant to go into subconscious, open-ended imagery used to create an internal environment that is catered to the participant, relaxed atmosphere, symbolic movements.

: Illumination: process which is integrated through conscious awareness via dialogue with witness, self-reflection in which the participant uncovers and resolves subconscious motivations, increased self awareness, can have positive and negative effects.

: Evaluation: discuss insights and significance of the process, prepare to end therapy&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Dance styles used ==
A variety of approaches to dance and movement are used in DMT depending on the needs to the client. These may include codified dance forms (such as partner dances, [[Modern dance|Modern Dance]], ballet, folk and circle dances etc.), creative movement, improvisation and choreographic process, as well as somatic practices, Movement Analysis, [[Authentic Movement]] and [[body psychotherapy]].&lt;ref name="Strassel 2011 53"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strassel|first=Juliane|author2=Daniel Cherkin |author3=Lotte Steuten |author4=Karen Sherman |author5=Hubertus Vrijhoef |title=A Systematic Review of the Evidence for the Effectiveness of Dance Therapy|journal=Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine|date=May–June 2011|volume=17|issue=3|pages=53, 50–59 |pmid=22164813}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practitioner may use any approach to movement and dance which they are familiar with adapted to the frame of DMT.

== Research ==

=== Proposed mechanisms ===
Various hypothesis have been proposed for mechanisms by which dance therapy may benefit participants. There is a social component to dance therapy, which can be valuable for psychological functioning through human interaction. Another possible mechanism is the music that is used during the session, which may be able to reduce pain, decrease anxiety, and increase relaxation. Since dance requires learning and involves becoming active and discovering capacities for movement, there is also the physical training that could provide benefits as well. Dancing may be considered more uplifting and enjoyable than other types of exercise. Dance therapy can also involve nonverbal communication, "which enables participants to express their feelings without words. This might be helpful when normal communication is absent or has broken down (eg, for patients with [[dementia]])."&lt;ref name=Strassel&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strassel|first=JK|author2=Cherkin, DC |author3=Steuten, L |author4=Sherman, KJ |author5= Vrijhoef, HJ |title=A systematic review of the evidence for the effectiveness of dance therapy.|journal=Alternative therapies in health and medicine|date=May–Jun 2011|volume=17|issue=3|pages=50–9|pmid=22164813}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Studies ===
A Cochrane review entitled ''Dance therapy for schizophrenia'' in 2013&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cochrane.org/CD006868/SCHIZ_dance-therapy-for-schizophrenia Dance therapy for schizophrenia]. Cochrane (2013-10-04). Retrieved on 2015-12-04.&lt;/ref&gt; concluded:

{{quote|"Overall, because of the small number of participants, the findings are limited. There is little evidence to support or refute the use of dance therapy. Larger studies and trials are needed that focus on important outcomes (such as rates of relapse, quality of life, admission to hospital, leaving the study early, cost of care and satisfaction with treatment). Further research would help clarify whether dance therapy is an effective and holistic treatment for people with schizophrenia, especially in terms of helping people cope with negative symptoms that do not respond so well to antipsychotic drugs."}}

A review by [[Cochrane Collaboration|the Cochrane Collaboration]] entitled ''Dance/movement therapy for cancer patients'' was updated in January 2015&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cochrane.org/CD007103/GYNAECA_dancemovement-therapy-for-cancer-patients Dance/movement therapy for cancer patients]. Cochrane (2015-01-07). Retrieved on 2015-12-04.&lt;/ref&gt; to say:

{{quote|"The three studies included a total of 207 participants, which were women with breast cancer. The studies were small in size. We found no evidence of an effect for depression, stress, anxiety, fatigue, and body image. The findings of individual studies suggest that dance/movement therapy may have a beneficial effect on the quality of life, somatization (i.e. distress arising from perceptions of bodily dysfunction) and vigor of women with breast cancer. No adverse effects of dance/movement therapy interventions were reported."}}

The most recent Cochrane review for DMT was in February 2015 entitled ''Is dance movement therapy an effective treatment for depression? A review of the evidence''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cochrane.org/CD009895/DEPRESSN_is-dance-movement-therapy-an-effective-treatment-for-depression-a-review-of-the-evidence Is dance movement therapy an effective treatment for depression? A review of the evidence]. Cochrane (2015-02-19). Retrieved on 2015-12-04.&lt;/ref&gt; The findings stated:
{{quote|"Due to the low number of studies and low quality of evidence, it was not possible to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of DMT for depression. It was not possible to compare DMT with medication, talking therapies, physical treatments or to compare types of DMT due to lack of available evidence. Key findings were:&lt;br /&gt;
Overall, there is no evidence for or against DMT as a treatment for depression. There is some evidence to suggest DMT is more effective than standard care for adults, but this was not clinically significant. DMT is no more effective than standard care for young people.&lt;br /&gt;
Evidence from just one study of low methodological quality suggested that drop-out rates from the DMT group were not significant, and there is no reliable effect in either direction for quality of life or self esteem. A large positive effect was observed for social functioning, but since this was from one study of low methodological quality the result is imprecise."}}

One review of the effect of DMT on [[Parkinson's disease]] noted that there have been few studies in this area. DMT appears to meet most requirements for exercise programs for patient's with Parkinson's. Benefits in gait function, balance, and quality of life were found in short-term studies, though further studies need to be done to see if any of these benefits are seen long-term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Earhart|first=GM|title=Dance as therapy for individuals with Parkinson disease.|journal=European Journal of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine|date=Jun 2009|volume=45|issue=2|pages=231–8|pmid=19532110|pmc=2780534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest Cochrane review entitled ''Dance Movement Therapy for Dementia'' published in 2017 concluded that there we no high quality trials to assess the effect of DMT on behavioural, social, cognitive and emotional symptoms in people with dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karkou|first=Vicky|last2=Meekums|first2=Bonnie|date=2017-02-03|title=Dance movement therapy for dementia|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=2|pages=CD011022|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011022.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmid=28155990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits ===

Research has found that using dance movements as a form of therapy activates several brain functions at once: kinesthetic, rational, musical, and emotional. This type of movement requires mental, physical, and emotional strength to work simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verghese|first1=J|last2=Lipton|first2=R.B.|last3=Katz|first3=M.J.|last4=Hall|first4=C.B.|last5=Derby|first5=C.A.|last6=Kuslansky|first6=G|last7=Ambrose|first7=A.F.|last8=Sliwinski|first8=M|last9=Buschke|first9=H|title=Leisure activities and the risk of dementia in the elderly|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=2003|volume=348|pages=2508–2516|doi=10.1056/nejmoa022252|pmid=12815136}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one research study{{specify|date=November 2017}}, senior citizens were placed in a 21-year study to see if any physical or cognitive recreational activity influenced mental acuity.  Researchers monitored rates of dementia in the elderly participants. The study included cognitive activities such as reading books, doing crossword puzzles, and playing musical instruments and physical activities such as golf, walking for exercise, and dancing. Results showed that almost none of the physical activities appeared to offer any defense against dementia. The activity with the highest percentage of protection against dementia was dancing frequently (76%). It was the greatest risk reduction of any activity studied, cognitive or physical. This is because dance therapy combines multiple areas of the brain to work together at once rather than just stimulating one area at a time.

Dance therapy is found to have beneficial results on children who have been abused. Research has found that this therapy is a useful form of support and intervention for these children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goodill|first1=S|title=Dance/movement therapy with abused children|journal=The Arts in Psychotherapy|date=1987|volume=14|pages=59–68|doi=10.1016/0197-4556(87)90035-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=November 2017}} Through a case study with a sexually abused female, the researcher stated that the individual felt a sense of empowerment after the dance therapy sessions and reported greater success in school. The individual also felt a stronger sense of self-confidence and a higher view of self-esteem.{{primary source inline|date=November 2017}} The study states that using dance therapy would be a beneficial experience in a multi-disciplinary treatment for abused and neglected children.

Another researcher studied the effects of dance therapy with children at risk of abuse and their relationship with their mothers. During this study, mothers and their children were surveyed on their relationship prior to the session, asking questions regarding their communication, physical touch, and sense of security felt by the child. After the dance therapy session, the participants were surveyed again with the same measure. The results reported a stronger bond between mother and child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meekums|first1=B|title=Dance/movement therapy with mothers and young children at risk of abuse|journal=The Arts in Psychotherapy|date=1981|volume=18|pages=223–230}}&lt;/ref&gt; The participants reported a stronger sense of belonging in the pair and felt more openness in terms of communication. Through dance therapy practices, these mother and daughter pairs were able to develop a starting point in rebuilding their relationship.

The effects of dance intervention were also found to be therapeutic to psychiatric participants and those who are emotional disturbed. In one research study, psychiatric patients were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: a dance group in a traditional dance circle, a group that just listened to the music, and another group that rode stationary bikes without music but same time duration as the dance circle. While all three conditions lessened or stabilized the condition of the patients, the results found that the dance group benefitted the most from the dance intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koch|first1=S.C.|last2=Morlinghaus|first2=K|last3=Fuchs|first3=T|title=The joy dance: Specific effects of a single dance intervention on psychiatric patients with depression|journal=The Arts in Psychotherapy|date=2007|volume=34|pages=340–349|doi=10.1016/j.aip.2007.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=November 2017}} The dance circle group reported less depression and more vitality than the other groups. This study shows that not just physical activity or listening to music is enough; the combining of the two into dance is the most beneficial for achieving a positive impact.

Another research study completed with children in psychiatry also showed a positive relationship with this type of therapy. The ending result was a newfound cohesion among children who were previously labeled disorderly and misbehaved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Erfer|first1=T|title=Moving toward cohesion: Group dance/movement therapy with children in psychiatry|journal=The Arts in Psychotherapy|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=November 2017}} The participants reported an increase in self-confidence and a positive body image after the dance intervention. The children had stronger communication and social skills, such as team work, after the dance intervention.

=== Adverse effects ===

Most trials studying dance therapy did not specifically comment on whether or not adverse effects occurred, though one noted a broken finger, thought to be related to dancing.&lt;ref name=Strassel/&gt;

== Organizations ==
Organizations such as the [[American Dance Therapy Association]] were created in order to uphold high standards in the field of DMT. Such organizations help connect individuals to therapists and DMT.&lt;ref name="adta.org"&gt;[http://www.adta.org/about/who.cfm "Who We Are"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101185845/http://www.adta.org/about/who.cfm |date=1 November 2008 }}. American Dance Therapy Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American Dance Therapy Association ===
[[American Dance Therapy Association]] (ADTA) was founded in 1966 in order to uphold high standards throughout dance therapy. The [[American Dance Therapy Association|ADTA]] was created by Marian Chace, the first president of the [[American Dance Therapy Association|ADTA]], and other pioneers in dance movement. Along with setting standards for which therapists must attain to become licensed therapists, [[American Dance Therapy Association|ADTA]] keeps an updated registry of all movement/dance therapists who have met [[American Dance Therapy Association|ADTA’s]] standards. In addition, [[American Dance Therapy Association|ADTA]] also publishes the American Journal of Dance Therapy and sponsors annual professional conferences.&lt;ref name="adta.org"/&gt;

=== Association for Dance Movement Psychotherapy, United Kingdom ===
The Association for Dance Movement Psychotherapy, United Kingdom (ADMP UK) was one of the first organizations established to regulate the field of dance therapy. ADMP UK accredits therapists and oversees that all regulations are followed.&lt;ref name="Payne, Helen 2006"&gt;Payne, Helen (2006) ''Dance Movement Therapy: Theory, Research, and Practice''.

Allied professions are areas that a person could do, special studies, short courses, or eventually become trained in the area of DMT.&lt;ref name=Payne&gt;{{cite book|last=Payne|first=Helen|title=Dance Movement Therapy: Theory and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EKJQGnEcCSEC&amp;pg=PP1|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780203359266|date=2004-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Therapist qualifications ==
[[American Dance Therapy Association|ADTA]] is the main regulator of the required education and training in order to become a dance/movement therapist in the USA.&lt;ref name="adta.org"/&gt; A [[master’s degree|master's degree]] is required to become a dance/movement therapist. "Registered Dance/Movement Therapist" (R-DMT) is the title given to entry-level dance/movement therapists who have completed requisite education and a minimum 700-hour supervised clinical internship. Those who have completed over 3,640 hours of supervised professional clinical work may hold the advanced credential "Board Certified Dance/Movement Therapist (BC-DMT).&lt;ref name="cancer.org"/&gt;

== Education ==
Typically becoming a dance therapist requires a graduate degree of at least a Master's level. There is no specific undergraduate degree, however many practitioners hold undergraduate degrees fields in, or related to, psychology or dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adta.org/Default.aspx?pageId=378251 |title=Undergraduate Coursework |deadurl=yes |accessdate=5 December 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214095502/http://www.adta.org/Default.aspx?pageId=378251 |archivedate=14 December 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All master's degrees in the UK and the USA require clinical placements, personal therapy and supervision, as well as experiential and theoretical learning, and typically require between 2 and 3 years to complete. Upon completion of a Masters graduates are eligible to register as Dance Movement Therapists/Psychotherapists with their professional associations. In the UK graduates may also register with the UK Council of Psychotherapists(UKCP).

It is also possible to register as a Dance Movement Therapist/Psychotherapist without a DMT/DMP Masters. This usually requires equilvilant psychotherapeutic training and substantial experience of applying dance into therapeutic settings.

'''''Dedication 3''''' is a [[Mixtape#Mixtapes in hip hop|mixtape]] by [[Lil Wayne]], hosted by [[DJ Drama]]. It is the sequel to its predecessors, ''[[The Dedication]]'' and the highly successful ''[[Dedication 2]]'', becoming the third in Lil Wayne's "Gangsta Grillz" series. Lil Wayne also told MTV, "''[[Tha Carter IV]]'' is nice but you need to be looking for ''Dedication 3''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1594678/20080912/lil_wayne.jhtml "Lil' Wayne Preps Mixtape And Tha Carter IV; Juelz Santana Plans Skull Gang Takeover: Mixtape Monday"], Shaheem Reid, [[MTV.com]], September 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Although ''Dedication 3'' was a major success, it failed to match that of its predecessors despite gaining some attention. The mixtape has sold over 70,000 copies in the United States, despite being available for free download. Besides the interludes, a majority of the mixtape has Wayne using [[auto-tune]] and rapping alongside artists signed to his label, [[Young Money Entertainment]].

'''''Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening''''', released in Japan as {{Nihongo|'''''Devil May Cry 3'''''|デビル メイ クライ 3|Debiru Mei Kurai Surī|lead=yes}}, is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[hack and slash]] [[video game]] directed by Hideaki Itsuno, developed and published by [[Capcom]], released in 2005 for the [[PlayStation 2]] and ported to [[Microsoft Windows]] in 2006. The game is a prequel to the original ''[[Devil May Cry (video game)|Devil May Cry]]'', with a younger [[Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]].&lt;ref name="Miguel Lopez"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ps2.gamespy.com/playstation-2/devil-may-cry-3/584486p1.html|title=Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening|accessdate=November 15, 2012|publisher=GameSpy|date=February 1, 2005|author=Lopez, Miguel}}&lt;/ref&gt; It introduces new combat mechanics with an emphasis on combos and fast paced action. The story is told primarily in [[cutscene]]s using the [[game engine|game's engine]], with several [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] [[full motion video]]s.

Set several years before the events of the first ''Devil May Cry'' in an enchanted tower, ''Temen-ni-gru'', the story centers on the dysfunctional relationship between Dante and his brother [[Vergil (Devil May Cry)|Vergil]]. 

''Devil May Cry 3'' was praised by critics yet received some criticisms for its high level of difficulty in the North American version. This was rectified by the release of the easier and rebalanced Special Edition of the game.&lt;ref name="GameSpyTooHard"&gt;{{cite web|author=Lopez, Miguel|url=http://ps2.gamespy.com/playstation-2/devil-may-cry-3/592530p1.html|title=Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening Review|accessdate=July 20, 2008|publisher=GameSpy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GameSpotTooHard"&gt;{{cite web|author=Kasavin, Greg|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/devilmaycry3/review.html|title=Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening for PlayStation 2 Review|accessdate=July 20, 2008|publisher=GameSpot|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206163248/http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/devilmaycry3/review.html|archivedate=December 6, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The game was re‐released in 2006 as {{Nihongo|'''''Devil&amp;nbsp;May&amp;nbsp;Cry&amp;nbsp;3: Dante’s&amp;nbsp;Awakening, Special&amp;nbsp;Edition'''''|デビル&amp;nbsp;メイ&amp;nbsp;クライ&amp;nbsp;3 Special&amp;nbsp;Edition}} with a recalibrated difficulty curve, the addition of mid-mission checkpoints, "GOLD mode", and Vergil as a playable character. Combined sales of both versions were over 2.3 million, and a 2005 [[Devil May Cry 3 (manga)|manga]] prequel to the game&lt;!--Which game? This or ''Devil May Cry''?--&gt; was published in Japan and later the United States.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Devil May Cry 3 gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Man dressed in red, shooting in a dimly lit room|Dante firing Ebony and Ivory at an opponent]]
The gameplay in ''Devil May Cry 3'' consists of levels ("missions") in which players battle enemies, carry out [[Platform game|platforming]] tasks and solve [[Puzzle video game|puzzles]] to progress through the story. The player's performance in each mission is graded from D through C, B and A, with top marks of S and SS. Grades are based on time taken to complete a mission, the number of red orbs (game currency, obtained from defeated enemies) gathered, "stylish" combat, item usage and [[Health (gaming)#Hit points|damage received]].&lt;ref name="booklet"&gt;{{cite book|title = Devil May Cry 3 Instruction Booklet|publisher = [[Capcom]]| year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Stylish combat is the performance of a series of attacks while avoiding damage, and is tracked by an on-screen gauge. The longer a player attacks without repetition and evades damage, the higher the score.&lt;ref name="booklet"/&gt; The gauge registers "Dope" after a few attacks, progressing through "Crazy", "Blast", "Alright", "Sweet", "SShowtime" to peak at "SSStylish". If Dante receives damage, the style rating falls; if the gauge is "Crazy" or below, it will reset. ''Devil May Cry 3''{{'}}s battle system allows a player to link attacks, with each weapon having a set number of attacks. 

The Devil Trigger enables the player's character to assume a demonic form. This alters the character's appearance, increases attack and defense, restores health and enables special attacks. This is a departure from the previous titles, where Dante draws power from weapons and items he procures throughout the game. The Devil Trigger state lasts as long as there is energy in the Devil Trigger gauge; the gauge rises by attacking (or taunting) enemies in normal mode, and falls when using the Devil Trigger transformation or other abilities using Devil Trigger power (such as the Quicksilver and Doppelganger styles, described below).&lt;ref name="booklet"/&gt; The Devil Trigger mode is not available to Dante until one-third of the way through the game, while Vergil (playable in the special edition) has the ability at the outset.

In Devil May Cry 3, Dante can switch between all 4 currently equipped weapons (two guns, two melee) mid-combo on the fly. Allowing for far greater combat freedom and variety than in previous Devil May Cry games. The other major difference from previous ''Devil May Cry'' games is ''Devil May Cry 3''{{'}}s combat system, which allows a player to choose one of Dante's four combat styles; each style has a different focus and techniques. Style selection is available at the beginning of each level and during gameplay at [[Saved game#Checkpoints|checkpoints]].&lt;ref name="GameSpyTooHard"/&gt; The styles are ''Trickster'', for dodging and agility; ''Swordmaster'', with abilities for swords and other weapons; ''Gunslinger'', with firearms techniques and ''Royal Guard'', which allows a player to repel attacks with a button press (storing energy for retaliation). Later in the game, a player accesses two additional styles: ''Quicksilver'' (slowing enemies, while the character attacks at normal speed) and ''[[Doppelgänger]]'' (creating a shadow double who fights alongside Dante). A second player may control the shadow double by pressing "Start" on a second controller. A two-player mode, similar to the Doppelgänger style, is accessible while Dante and Vergil battle [[Characters of Devil May Cry#Arkham|Arkham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.devilmaycry.org/devil-may-cry-3/styles/ | title=List of styles in Devil May Cry 3 | publisher=devilmaycry.org | accessdate=July 20, 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720175259/http://www.devilmaycry.org/devil-may-cry-3/styles/ | archivedate=July 20, 2008 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[special edition]] Vergil has another style, ''Dark Slayer'', which is similar to Trickster.

==Plot==
{{see also|Characters of Devil May Cry}}
''Devil May Cry 3'' - a prequel to the first game - opens in Dante's yet-unnamed shop in an American metropolis. A mysterious man, Arkham, arrives with an invitation from Dante's brother Vergil in the guise of a demonic attack.&lt;ref&gt;'''Dante:''' Damn it! you guys totally wrecked my shop and I haven't even named it yet! (''Devil May Cry 3'') Capcom, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''Arkham:''' Is your name Dante? Son of Sparda? '''Dante:''' Where did you hear that? '''Arkham:''' From your brother. He sent this invitation to you. Please, accept it.. '''Dante:''' Invitation huh? (''Devil May Cry 3'') Capcom, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; After Dante defeats his adversaries, a huge tower erupts from the ground nearby, eclipsing the sprawling city surrounding it.&lt;ref name="Miguel Lopez"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''Arkham:''' Well? Doesn't it excite you? The Temen-ni-gru has revived. The Great One who once ruled this earth as the medium between the Human world, and the Demon world. Isn't it a magnificent view? The greatest minds of their time, those who revered Evil, constructed this glorious edifice. Now after two millenniums of confinement it can at last fulfill the purpose for which it was intended - '''Vergil:''' That's... none of my concern. Did he have it? (''Devil May Cry 3'') Capcom, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Sensing that Vergil is on the structure, Dante interprets this as a challenge.&lt;ref&gt;'''Dante:''' It's been nearly a year since we last met. Where does the time go? No doubt you've got some fun planned for me. Right Vergil? (''Devil May Cry'') Capcom, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He begins fighting demons during his journey; once defeated, they become his weapons.&lt;ref&gt;'''Cerberus:''' You are not a human, are you? '''Dante:''' Who knows? I'm not even sure myself. '''Cerberus:''' Regardless, you have proved your strength. I acknowledge your ability. Take my soul and go forth. You have my blessing. '''Dante:''' Too easy! (''Devil May Cry 3'') Capcom, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Dante is attacked by a woman on a motorcycle who turns out to be [[Characters of Devil May Cry#Lady|Mary]], Arkham's daughter, who wants revenge on her father for causing her mother's death.&lt;ref&gt;'''Vergil:''' Why didn't you kill her? Perhaps, because she is your daughter? Did some pesky fatherly love get in your way? '''Arkham:''' That is none of your - '''Vergil:''' To further your study of the black arts, you sacrificed your loving wife, to become a devil as well. Knowing this I thought you'd be more useful to me, but I was wrong. No wonder your attainment of power is incomplete. (''Devil May Cry 3'') Capcom, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''Mary:''' Shut up! He was obsessed with becoming a devil, so much he killed his own wife. For that he butchered innocent people too. He's the most vile kind of creature. To top it off, that filthy scum... is my father. '''Dante:''' Well, we have something in common. I have a dysfunctional family too.'''Mary:''' And what would you know about family? You're a demon! This is my father. My family! This was all supposed to end by my hand! (''Devil May Cry 3'') Capcom, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Arkham works for Vergil; they plan to take Dante's half of their mother's amulet and use its power on the tower to connect the human and demonic worlds.&lt;ref&gt;'''Vergil:''' Why isn't this working?! is there something missing? Must more blood be shed? '''Dante''' : You seem to be in a bad mood. '''Vergil:''' Dante. '''Dante:''' So my mother's amulet is the key that unlocks the door to the Demon World. Good Plan, Pop. '''Vergil:''' Just the opposite actually... Originally it was the key to the Demon World but was given to humans as a gift. '''Dante:''' It doesn't matter to me one way or the other. More importantly I've came all this way. I'm sure you have time for one more game, right? '''Vergil:''' Why not? After all we share the same blood. I'll just use more of yours to undo daddy's little spell. '''Dante:''' So you want a piece of me. literally. Okay, bro. come and get it, if you can! (''Devil May Cry 3'') Capcom, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

After a number of battles and an encounter with a being named Jester,&lt;ref&gt;'''Jester:''' That could be a problem. Just hear me out. You got nothing to lose, right? My name is Jester, and I know a thing or two about this place. That thing there, is a power generator for this entire sector. In order to open the door, you need to apply a little something to it first. Do you know what that is, kid? Or is that too difficult for you? Ahahahahahaha - (''Devil May Cry 3'') Capcom, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Dante reaches the tower's summit and battles Vergil. Vergil defeats Dante, steals his amulet and leaves; Dante's dormant demonic powers emerge, and he sets out in pursuit.&lt;ref&gt;'''Vergil:''' Why do you refuse to gain power? The power of our father Sparda? '''Dante:''' Father? I don't have a father. I just don't like you, that's all. '''Vergil:''' Foolishness, Dante, foolishness. Might controls everything. And without strength, you can't protect anything. Let alone yourself. (''Devil May Cry 3'') Capcom, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He catches Vergil in a control room in the tower's basement, where Vergil cannot reactivate the tower. The brothers fight again, until they are interrupted by Mary and Jester. Jester reveals himself as Arkham, who has manipulated them all to reactivate the tower to reach the demonic world. There he plans to steal the Force Edge, the dormant form of [[Characters of Devil May Cry#Sparda|Sparda]]'s sword with his power, using it to rule a demon-infested Earth.&lt;ref&gt;'''Jester:''' It was quite a ride, you know! If any of you had died before getting here, our little plan would have gone to waste! Therefore, my job was to get you to battle each other in order to weaken you. But at the same time, I needed to guide you here and make sure you were kept alive. I even went so far as dressing like a complete idiot! (''Devil May Cry 3'') Capcom, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sins"&gt;'''Arkham:''' He plucks the threads that make us dance, finger and toe! We surrender in joy to the lowest of the foul and rank; we submerge through darkness, rancid filth. Hour by hour, we move downward, ever closer to Hell, in a slow, steady gait. Now, let the world resonate! Sloth! Gluttony! Greed! Envy! Lust! Wrath! And pride! A bell of chaos that tolls human desires! After two thousand long years, the once sealed gate to the demonic world will open! Destruction! Carnage and Despair! Let your instincts drive you! Entrap this world in fear! As its very name Temen-ni-gru strikes terror into the heart of mankind. Then I will become the ultimate ruler of this wasteland engulfed with pandemonium. The demonic power that Sparda once imprisoned... will be mine! (''Devil May Cry 3'') Capcom, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The tower transforms as the spell is broken; Arkham is carried to the summit, and Vergil disappears in the confusion.

Dante battles his way back up the tower, fighting Mary for the right to pursue Arkham. He is victorious, and Mary lends him her most-powerful weapon. Reaching the summit, Dante crosses to the demonic world and catches Arkham (who has assumed Sparda's demonic form). Overwhelmed by power, Arkham transforms into a blob-like creature who battles Dante. During the fight Vergil reappears, and the brothers work together to expel Arkham from the demonic world; weakened, Arkham lands on the tower (where Mary kills him). In the demonic world, Dante and Vergil fight for ownership of the Force Edge and the amulet halves. After his defeat Vergil remains as the portal closes, vanishing into the darkness with his half of the amulet.&lt;ref&gt;'''Vergil:''' No one can have this Dante. It's mine. It belongs to a son of Sparda. Leave me and go, if you don't want to be trapped in the demon world. I'm staying. This place, was our father's home. (''Devil May Cry 3'') Capcom, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Dante meets Mary outside the tower; they form a friendship and the beginnings of a partnership as demon-slayers and he names his shop "Devil May Cry".&lt;ref&gt;'''Mary:''' Are you crying? '''Dante:''' It's only the rain. '''Mary:''' The rain already stopped. '''Dante:''' Devils never cry. '''Mary:''' I see. Maybe somewhere out there even a devil may cry when he loses a loved one. Don't you think? '''Dante:''' Maybe. (''Devil May Cry 3'') Capcom, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''Mary:''' Oh, speaking of a kind devil, he finally decided on a name for his shop. It took him quite a while to pick one. Want to know the name? Devil May Cry. (''Devil May Cry 3'') Capcom, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; A scene after the credits shows Vergil in the demonic world, weak but determined, as he charges into battle against his father's old foe [[Characters of Devil May Cry#Mundus|Mundus]].&lt;ref&gt;'''Vergil:''' It would be fun to fight with the Prince of Darkness. If my father did it, then I should be able to do it too! (''Devil May Cry 3'') Capcom, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

After the mixed reception of ''Devil May Cry 2'', Capcom developed ''Devil May Cry 3'' in a similar manner to the series' more critically acclaimed first game, ''Devil May Cry''; its gameplay elements, such as environment size and battle engine, were reexamined. Other aspects of ''Devil May Cry 2'', such as the toning-down of Dante's cockiness and the game's lack of difficulty, were brought back in line with ''Devil May Cry''.&lt;ref name="Gamedailybiz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biz.gamedaily.com/industry/toppers/?id=9336 |title=Devil May Cry 3 Poised for Success |date=April 6, 2005 |publisher=GameDaily |author=Brightman, James |accessdate=April 12, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929092141/http://biz.gamedaily.com/industry/toppers/?id=9336 |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As during the original ''Devil May Cry'' Vergil was said to have been killed by demons early and had his soul under the control of Mundus, [[Bingo Morihashi]] wanted to create an alternate universe in which Vergil was alive. However, Hideki Kamiya gave Morihashi the freedom to retcon this and make Vergil into a living teenager for the events of ''Devil May Cry 3''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry: 3142 Graphic Arts|publisher=Capcom, Udon Entertainment|year=2015|isbn=978-1927925485|pages=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a pre-release interview with the game's producer, Tsuyoshi Tanaka, the focus of the game's design was a battle system which allowed a player to control weapons in new, "stylish" ways. This coincided with the design of a new type of [[Virtual camera system|in-game camera]] which kept the character in focus, avoiding disorientation in crowded battle scenes. ''Devil May Cry 2''{{'}}s difficulty was reduced for greater acceptance in the Japanese market, but this move cost the game support elsewhere. To remedy this, the Japanese release of ''Devil May Cry 3'' had a lower degree of difficulty than the North American and European releases and Dante was a younger, more arrogant character than  he was in the previous games.&lt;ref name="Tanaka"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pages/video_player/popup.php?sid=6117480&amp;pid=920607 |title=Interview with Tsuyoshi Tanaka |publisher=GameSpot |accessdate=April 18, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930205840/http://www.gamespot.com/pages/video_player/popup.php?sid=6117480&amp;pid=920607 |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reuben Langdon]] provided the character's voice and [[motion capture]].

Capcom promoted ''Devil May Cry 3''{{'}}s release with a multimillion-dollar television campaign and extensive advertising in video-game magazines; both emphasized the game's plot and number of fighting styles.&lt;ref name="Gamedailybiz"/&gt; The company produced a second, "special" edition, released in North America on January 24, 2006. A Microsoft Windows version, with minor graphics changes, was developed by SourceNext; it was released by [[Ubisoft]] on June 28, 2006 in Europe and October 16, 2006 in North America. The Devil Trigger versions of Dante and Vergil were designed by [[Atlus]]' [[Kazuma Kaneko]], who previously collaborated on ''[[Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner]]'', ''[[Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne]]'' and ''[[Revelations: Persona|Persona]]''.&lt;ref name="IGNKanekoDesign"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3134856&amp;did=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041106214235/http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3134856&amp;did=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 6, 2004 |title=Devil May Cry 3 PS2 Preview, Devil May Cry 3 PlayStation 2 Preview |publisher=1Up |accessdate=July 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GameSpotKanekoDesign"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6107931.html |title=Atlus designer Kazuma Kaneko working on Devil May Cry 3 - News at GameSpot |publisher=GameSpot |accessdate=July 20, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929223856/http://www.gamespot.com/news/6107931.html |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Devil May Cry 3''{{'}}s release Capcom introduced merchandise based on the game, including a [[Devil May Cry 3 (manga)|manga]] (written by Suguro Chayamachi and published by [[Tokyopop]] in North America) and a Dante [[action figure]] manufactured by [[Kaiyodo#Revoltech|Revoltech]].

=== {{anchor|''Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition''}}Special edition ===
At the 2005 [[Tokyo Game Show]], Capcom announced a special edition of ''Devil May Cry 3'' with gameplay changes and additional content.&lt;ref name="TGS2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/devilmaycry3/news_6133197.html|title=TGS 2005: Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition Confirmed|date=September 14, 2005|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=July 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The special edition was released on January 24, 2006 as part of the PlayStation 2 [[Greatest Hits (video games)|greatest-hits]] collection, and it was later confirmed that the PlayStation 2 version of the game would be released in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ps2.ign.com/objects/771/771533.html#reviews|title=Release dates and production teams of Devil May Cry 3|publisher=IGN|accessdate=July 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition'' went on to sell 1 million units.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Most notable additions to the game are, Dante's twin brother Vergil, who is now playable. Other changes included an additional [[survival mode]], "Bloody Palace", with 9,999 levels; a Jester fight early in the game, with optional fights later; a "Turbo Mode", increasing game speed by 20 percent; an easier GOLD mode"continue" feature, allowing a player to revive a character or restart a lost fight, and rebalanced difficulty. Vergil's gameplay differed from Dante's; although Dante was weaker than Vergil in terms of skills and combos, he was easier to control. Because of the game's space limitations, not all of Vergil's moves were included in the special edition.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/news/postmortem-dmc3se|title=Postmortem on DMC3:SE|author=Mielke, James|publisher=1UP.com|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130624224635/http://www.1up.com/news/postmortem-dmc3se|archive-date=June 24, 2013|dead-url=yes|accessdate=June 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vergil has one style, "Dark Slayer" (similar to Dante's "Trickster" style), with evasive maneuvers which can be [[experience point|leveled-up]] twice like Dante's four styles. He has three weapons: a [[katana]] known as Yamato, Beowulf [[Gauntlet (glove)|gauntlets]] and [[greave]]s and the Force Edge [[Basket-hilted sword|broadsword]]. Vergil has two ranges of attack: "Summoned Swords" (creating magical swords for a variety of effects)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameslave.co.uk/content/devil-may-cry-3-special-edition-review/|title=Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition Review|publisher=Gameslave|accessdate=July 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Judgment Cut" (creating spheres of force).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/680/680872p1.html|title=DMC3: SE  - PlayStation 2 Preview at IGN|publisher=IGN|accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new boss is Jester, a character encountered several times in first-edition cutscenes but not fought. In ''Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition'', he is a boss who may be fought three times.

=== PC ===
On February 1, 2006, [[Ubisoft]] announced that they would be releasing a [[Microsoft Windows]] version of the game developed by SourceNext.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=7998|title=Ubisoft To Publish Capcom Titles On PC|date=February 1, 2006|publisher=Gamasutra|accessdate=July 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European PC version was the first one released (before the special-edition PlayStation 2 version in that region), on June 28, 2006. The Japanese version was released two days later, and the North American version on October 16. 

=== Devil May Cry HD ===
''Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition'' was re-released in the ''Devil May Cry HD Collection'' for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] (with ''Devil May Cry'' and ''Devil May Cry 2'') on April 3, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/12/20/devil-may-cry-hd-collection-release-date-announced|title=Devil May Cry HD Collection Release Date Announced|author=Goldfarb, Andrew|date=December 20, 2011|publisher=IGN|accessdate=July 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[review aggregator]] website [[Metacritic]] gave the ''Special Edition'' on PlayStation 2 an 87 out of 100.&lt;ref name="MCPS2SE" /&gt; It was included on ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'s}} list of the top 50 games of 2005, and the special edition received a "Game of the Month" award.&lt;ref name="GameInformer"&gt;{{cite book | title=Game Informer (Issue #153) - January| year=2006| page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 [[IGN]] ranked it 18th on its list of the top 100 PlayStation 2 games,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ie.ign.com/top/ps2-games/18|title=Top 100 PlayStation 2 Games |publisher=IGN|accessdate=November 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a ''[[GamePro]]'' retrospective that year rated it the 28th-best game for the PS2.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101225071223/http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/205779/the-36-best-ps2-games-page-2-of-5 The 36 Best PS2 Games, page 2, Feature Story from GamePro]&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviews typically praised the game for avoiding its predecessor's mistakes and for customization options, gameplay, combat engine and the musical score despite the contradicting plot lines and character arcs. The style-based combat engine was considered to produce fighting sequences superior to games such as ''[[Ninja Gaiden (2004 video game)|Ninja Gaiden]]'' and ''[[Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones]]'',&lt;ref name="Gamestm"&gt;{{cite book| title= Games TM (Issue #30) - March| year=2005| pages=120–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the camera and controls were praised.&lt;ref name="GameSpotTooHard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gamepro"&gt;{{cite web| author=Clockwork Crow| url=http://www.gamepro.com/sony/ps2/games/reviews/42648.shtml| title=Devil May Cry 3 review| publisher=[[GamePro]]| date=March 1, 2005|accessdate=July 20, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080806115534/http://www.gamepro.com/sony/ps2/games/reviews/42648.shtml |archivedate=August 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GameSpyGOTY2k6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goty.gamespy.com/2006/ps2/index3.html|title=GameSpy's Game of the Year 2006|accessdate=July 20, 2008|publisher=GameSpy|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907095048/http://goty.gamespy.com/2006/ps2/index3.html|archivedate=September 7, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gamecritics.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jones, Scott|url=http://www.gamecritics.com/review/dmc3/main.php|title=Devil May Cry 3 review|publisher=Gamecritics.com|date=May 25, 2005|accessdate=July 20, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709031201/http://www.gamecritics.com/review/dmc3/main.php|archivedate=July 9, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="G4"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.g4tv.com/xplay/features/51350/Devil_May_Cry_3_Review.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427040931/http://www.g4tv.com/xplay/features/51350/Devil_May_Cry_3_Review.html| archivedate=April 27, 2006|title=Devil May Cry 3 review|publisher=G4| accessdate=July 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Devil May Cry 3'' was included in the 2010 book, ''[[1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die|last=Mott |first=Tony |authorlink= |year=2010 |publisher=[[Quintessence Editions Ltd.]]|location=London |isbn=978-1-74173-076-0 |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The North American high level of difficulty in the non-special edition was criticized in otherwise-positive reviews. Critics disagreed with Capcom's decision to make the Japanese version's "hard" mode the North American  "normal" mode,&lt;ref name="Euro Gamer"&gt;{{cite web|author=Reed, Kristan| title=Devil May Cry review|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=58841|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|date=April 29, 2005|accessdate=July 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNDMC3"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dunham, Jeremy|url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/590/590779p1.html| title=Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening review|publisher=IGN|date=February 25, 2005|accessdate=July 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The European version of Devil May Cry 3 had the same normal mode as the Japanese version, but maintained the yellow orb continue system of the North American version. &lt;ref&gt;https://platinumparagon.wordpress.com/2018/03/12/why-devil-may-cry-3-was-harder-in-america/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vergil gameplay DMC3.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Character dressed in blue, striking out with a sword|Vergil attacking with his sword, Yamato. His addition as a playable character in the special edition was well received by critics]]

The PC version was considered vastly inferior to the PlayStation 2 version due to the poor porting process. Issues included its [[game engine]] (thought rough and underpowered), its controls and the inability to [[saved game|save the game]] and exit, a feature of most PC games.&lt;ref name="GameSpotPC"&gt;{{cite web|author=Kasavin, Greg|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/devilmaycry3specialedition/review.html|title=Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition for Personal computer review|publisher=GameSpot|date=October 21, 2006|accessdate=July 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeremy Dunham of [[IGN]] gave the PC version a score of 5.8 out of 10 (compared to the PS2 version's 9.6),&lt;ref name="IGNDMC3"/&gt; citing its "awful performance" and "craptacular controls".&lt;ref name="IGNPC"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dunham, Jeremy|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/747/747615p1.html|title=Devil May Cry 3 for PC review|publisher=IGN|date=October 22, 2006|accessdate=July 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Encyclopedia of Domestic Animation''''' ({{lang-ru|Энциклопедия отечественной мультипликации}}; [[Romanization of Russian|transliterated]] ''Entsiklopediya otechestvennoy multiplikatsiyi'') is a collection of biographies and filmographies of the masters of [[Russia]]n and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[animation]]. It was released at the [[12th Open Russian Festival of Animated Film]] in March 2007, and its general release happened on March 11.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animator.ru/index.phtml?p=show_news&amp;nid=703 News release] at [[Animator.ru]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first attempt at recording the complete [[History of Russian animation|history of Russian and Soviet animation]].

The encyclopedia was written by Sergey Kapkov and compiled with the help of several journalists and editors over the course of a few years.  A huge amount of information was gathered from interviews with living members of the profession.  This was partly out of necessity because of the destruction of some archives in the post-Soviet period, notably that of [[Soyuzmultfilm]].&lt;ref name="utro"&gt;[http://www.utro.ru/articles/2007/03/16/633197.shtml  В истории мультипликации почти не осталось тайн], ''16-03-2007''. Утро.&lt;/ref&gt; Letters with requests for help were sent out to all of the former Soviet republics, though in some countries such as [[Estonia]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] they were totally ignored.&lt;ref name="mibf"&gt;[http://www.mibf.ru/BooksOfRussia/2005/Pressbyl/?id=140 Энциклопедия мультипликации - впервые в России] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070927003845/http://www.mibf.ru/BooksOfRussia/2005/Pressbyl/?id=140 |date=2007-09-27 }}. MIBF.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because so much information was dependent on oral sources, it was decided not to call it an academic edition.  Kapkov said of the book, "we are not insured from some possible mistakes".&lt;ref name="mibf" /&gt;

The book contains 1050 biographies (each of which contains an exhaustive filmography) of people involved in animation of all sorts of different professions:&lt;ref name="arthouse"&gt;[http://www.arthouse.ru/news.asp?id=3893 Вышла «Энциклопедия отечественной анимации»] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724114850/http://www.arthouse.ru/news.asp?id=3893 |date=2011-07-24 }}, ''22-03-2007'' "Время". Дина Годер.&lt;/ref&gt; directors, artists, animators, writers, camera operators, editors, composers, voice actors and critics.  It covers the historical period from 1912, when [[Ladislas Starevich]] made the first Russian animated film with insect skeletons, to the present day.&lt;ref name="rossiya"&gt;[http://www.utro-russia.ru/news.html?id=28505 Энциклопедия отечественной анимации]. ''12-04-2007''. Utro-russia.ru&lt;/ref&gt;  The introduction, which summarizes this whole history, was written by Larisa Malyukova.

Upon the book's release, many animators (especially from former Soviet republics) contacted the authors and provided additional information about themselves and their colleagues, as well as some factual corrections.&lt;ref name="utro" /&gt; Because of this and the book's unexpected success at the book fair "Books of Russia" («Книги России»), future updated editions are planned.&lt;ref name="mibf" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4490">'''Ethnovideography''' is a methodology of using [[video]] in the study of [[people]]s, [[community|communities]], groups or sub-groups.&lt;ref&gt;Flor, A.G. 2002. ''Ethnovideography''. SEAMEO-SEARCA and CIP-UPWARD&lt;/ref&gt; It espouses the use of video to document reality instead of "creating" realities. Hence, ethnovideographic presentations are unscripted. Narrations, background music, sound effects and special effects are not employed. The use of artificial lighting, obtrusive hardware, production crews and all but the simplest camera technique are discouraged. 

Although originally experimented upon by the [[Los Baños, Laguna|Los Baños]] science community in the [[Philippines]] in the early 1990s as adjuncts to [[environmental impact assessment]]s (EIAs), studies of indigenous knowledge systems and documentation of agricultural [[best practice]], it traces its roots in the [[cinéma vérité]] movement of the 1950s and 1960s, the difference being its emphasis on small format or digital format video and its adoption of extra-sociological subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Flor, A.G. 1983. Participatory Film-Making: A Structural Analysis of Cinema Direct. ''DevCom Quarterly''. UPLB Institute of Development Communication&lt;/ref&gt; Being a methodology, ethnovideography is theory-based and adopts a set of procedures or protocols.

==History==
The earliest mention of ethnovideography in current literature comes from an [[Asian Development Bank]] project document written by a team of environmental consultants headed by Sylvia Guerrero, former Dean of the [[University of the Philippines]] College of Social Work and Community Development. Guerrero et al. (1992) defined ethnovideography as:

''...a research procedure developed at the UPLB Institute of Development Communication, which makes use of small-format video-generated non-alphanumeric data for social analysis. This procedure entails video documentation of five types of subjects: people, places, processes, events and social problems...''&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, S.H. 1992. ''Inception Report for Improving the Implementation of Environmental impact Assessment''. Asian Development Bank&lt;/ref&gt; 

Credited for coining the term ethnovideography as well as its development as a methodology, Alexander Flor considers it more than a research procedure but a [[knowledge management]] system and a form of development intervention as well. Flor was a professor of [[development communication]] at the [[University of the Philippines Los Banos]] who underwent a [[Fulbright]]-PAEF post-doctoral tour in the US in 1989. The tour included a summer at the [[USC Center for Visual Anthropology]], wherein exposure to the use of video in urban anthropology contributed to his early constructs on ethnovideography. Other influences include Professor Alain Martenot who mentored Flor on [[Direct Cinema]] technique under a French Foreign Ministry grant. His early work on ethnovideography was sponsored by the Users' Perspectives with Agricultural and Rural Development (UPWARD) facility of the Lima-based [[International Potato Center]]. Succeeding research were conducted mostly by [[development communication]] graduate students, e.g. Bandara,&lt;ref&gt;Bandara, R. 1994. ''Usefulness and Effectivity of Ethnovideography as a Training Tool in Sri Lanka''. University of the Philippines Los Banos Graduate School&lt;/ref&gt; Hardono,&lt;ref&gt;Hardono.1993. ''Usefulness and Effectivity of Ethnovideography in Documenting Indigenous Knowledge on Sustainable Agriculture in Indonesia''. University of the Philippines Los Banos Graduate School&lt;/ref&gt; and Maya.&lt;ref&gt;Iis Nana Maya. 1993. ''Usefulness and Effectivity of Ethnovideography in Research Agenda Setting''. University of the Philippines Los Banos Graduate School&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, ethnovideographic studies have been uploaded to [[YouTube]].

In 2002, the book [http://openlibrary.org/works/OL5866684W/Ethnovideography Ethnovideography: Video Based Indigenous Knowledge Systems] was co-published by [http://www.searca.org SEAMEO-SEARCA] and [[International Potato Center|CIP]]-UPWARD.

'''''Factotum''''' is a 2005 French-Norwegian [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] co-written and directed by [[Bent Hamer]], adapted from the 1975 [[Factotum (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Charles Bukowski]]. It stars [[Matt Dillon]] as Bukowski’s alter ego, [[Henry Chinaski]]. Although events in the book take place in Los Angeles in the 1940s, the film has a contemporary setting.

==Plot==
Henry 'Hank' Chinaski ([[Matt Dillon]]) is working toward becoming a writer while struggling with alcoholism and holding various menial jobs. The film follows Chinaski as he works at, and gets fired from, various jobs, which include cleaning a massive sculpture, delivering ice, working at a pickle factory, and in a bicycle shop. In the course of sampling the smorgasbord of short-lived occupations, he meets up with assorted eccentric, frequently alcoholic characters.

The first woman Chinaski meets in a bar becomes his most consistent companion throughout the film. Jan ([[Lili Taylor]]), like Chinaski, is an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]]. He moves in and becomes her lover and drinking partner. They co-exist comfortably in languid squalor until Chinaski becomes upset after an altercation where he beats a wealthy man at the racing track who refuses to give up his seat. Initially polite, Chinaski assaults the man after Jan challenges his behavior. Soon after, Chinaski leaves Jan.

Unemployed again and scoring his next drink, Hank meets another female barfly, Laura ([[Marisa Tomei]]), who feels sorry for Chinaski and helps him procure alcohol with the help of her wealthy "sugar daddy" Pierre, an eccentric older man. After a strange misadventure on Pierre's boat, Chinaski briefly returns to Jan, who is now working as a chambermaid at a hotel. A pivotal scene occurs with Jan after Chinaski discovers that he has caught a case of the [[pubic lice|"crabs"]] from her. Chinaski gains work but quickly loses his job after deciding to drink instead of completing cleaning a large statue.

Chinaski and Jan again break up after realizing their relationship has become boring and predictable and that they no longer really need each other. Jan moves in with a wealthy man who was the person assaulted before by Chinaski. By the film's end Chinaski finds that he is most comfortable being alone with just his alcohol and his writing to keep him company. In the final scene Chinaski justifies his lifestyle. While drinking, and watching a topless pole dancer, he describes the costs, persistence needed, and rewards of writing. In voiceover he says, "If you’re going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don’t even start. This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives and maybe even your mind... You will be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire. You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. It’s the only good fight there is."

==Cast==
* [[Matt Dillon]] ... [[Henry Chinaski]]
* [[Lili Taylor]] ... Jan
* [[Marisa Tomei]] ... Laura
* [[Adrienne Shelly]] ... Jerry
* [[Fisher Stevens]] ... Manny
* [[Karen Young (actress)|Karen Young]] ... Grace
* [[Didier Flamand]] ... Pierre

==Production==
The film is principally a French-Norwegian co-production, although with an American cast. It was released in Norway in 2005 and distributed in the U.S. by IFC Films in 2006. It was released on DVD in the U.S. on 26 December 2006.

Bukowski's [[picaresque novel]], also titled ''[[Factotum (novel)|Factotum]]'', was published in 1975. The book and the film both center on the character of [[Henry Chinaski]], Bukowski’s [[alter ego]], who appears in much of his fiction. Although events in the book take place in Los Angeles in the 1940s, the film has a contemporary setting, and was shot in [[Minneapolis]].&lt;ref&gt;For the location see {{cite web|last1=Turan|first1=Kenneth|title=Factotum' is true to the grit, poetry of Charles Bukowski|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/aug/18/entertainment/et-factotum18|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bukowski's poems===
The script also makes use of Bukowski's poems published in ''What Matters Is How Well You Walk Through the Fire'' and ''The Days Run Aways Like Horses Over the Hill'', and some of Bukowski's notebook entries published in ''[[The Captain Is Out to Lunch and the Sailors Have Taken Over the Ship]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See "Opening Credits" of film, ''Factotum''.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Matt Dillon reads the poem "Roll The Dice" (from  ''What Matters Is How Well You Walk Through the Fire'') in a [[voiceover]] at the end of the film.

'''First Rain''' is an annual event held at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] (UCSC) which began at [[Porter College]]. It is also known as the '''Naked Run'''. During the first rainfall of the school year, students run naked through the campus, generally starting at Porter College.

==History==
First Rain started in [[fall]] of 1989, following the weeks of the [[Loma Prieta earthquake]], which hit only 10 miles from the campus and was a frightening event for the students of this university.&lt;ref&gt;http://quake89.ucsc.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.ucsc.edu/speccoll/the-loma-prieta-earthquake-20-years-later The Loma Prieta Earthquake 20 Years Later from UC Santa Cruz Library ]&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning at [[Porter College]], they proceeded to walk across the length of the UCSC campus naked.  This was the beginning of the tradition of First Rain. The First Rain began because students were afraid to sleep inside the Porter College [[dormitory|dorms]] after the earthquake. The Porter students supported each other in a large outdoor sleepover. In a community game of dares, they dared each other to run around naked.  Although some students slept outside in the [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quad]] the first night following the earthquake, the dorms were quite safe, and students moved back in almost immediately.

==Traditions and rules==
Circa 2007, First Rain's prerequisite formation rules were formed in order to give more students the chance to run:&lt;ref name="ucscfirstrain.com"&gt;http://ucscfirstrain.com/&lt;/ref&gt;
* the run would only form on a school night
* the rain had to fall almost nonstop that evening (from around 6:00pm to 11:00pm)
* at 10:00 pm, the run would begin in Porter.
* the run ends at the swimming pool of Opers.
Historically however, First Rain runs did not have prerequisites to be met before beginning: these rules did not exist before the mid-2000s. From its beginning, the rules were very simple: as soon as the first heavy rains of the year fell, students were to disrobe and run. &lt;ref name="ProctorWayneBook"&gt;{{cite book

|last= Hendrickson
|first= Wayne
|year= 1998
|publisher= Hearth &amp; Home Productions
|location= Mount Hermon, California
|pages= 103–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;
And in the recent years of the severe California drought, these relatively new rules for First Rain became more difficult to maintain, inspiring talks among the student body as to what makes a "real" First Rain.

Aiming to make this event a yearly tradition as it is at other universities, the students decided on running during the first rain of every school year (since other events, like the first school day or first snow had already been taken by other universities).&lt;ref name="hendrickson"&gt;{{cite speech

 | last = Hendrickson
 | authorlink =
 | date = 2007-05-16
 | location = Fireside Lounge, Porter College, UCSC
 | url =

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The First Rain tradition has expanded into a more organized event with the addition of the rules. Beginning spontaneously, the students group in the Porter quad and then run from college to college and gather more people as they pass.&lt;ref&gt;http://snapjudgment.org/first-first-rain-uc-santa-cruz&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not a sanctioned event, the campus safety officers and campus police rarely make arrests and appear mainly to assure the safety of the night runners and to discourage them from damaging school property.

It is highly discouraged and against the spirit of the run to take photographs of the runners that may violate their privacy.&lt;ref name="ucscfirstrain.com"/&gt;

'''''Friday the 13th Part III''''' (also known as '''''Friday the 13th Part 3: 3D''''') is a 1982 American [[slasher film]] directed by [[Steve Miner]] and produced by [[Frank Mancuso Jr.]]. It is the third installment in the [[Friday the 13th (franchise)|''Friday the 13th'' film series]], and stars [[Dana Kimmell]], [[Richard Brooker]], Paul Kratka, [[Larry Zerner]], and [[Tracie Savage]]. Set after the events of ''[[Friday the 13th Part 2]]'', the plot concerns a teenage girl and her friends on vacation at a house on Crystal Lake, where a wounded [[Jason Voorhees]] has taken refuge. The film marks the debut of antagonist Jason Voorhees wearing his signature [[goaltender mask|hockey mask]], which has become a trademark of both the character and the franchise, as well as an icon in [[American cinema]] and horror films in general. 

Originally, the story was supposed to focus on [[Ginny (Friday the 13th)|Ginny Field]], who checked herself into a mental institution after her traumatic battle with Jason Voorhees in the [[Friday the 13th Part 2|previous film]]. The film would have been similar to ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'' (1981), with Jason tracking down Ginny in the mental hospital, but the concept was abandoned when [[Amy Steel]] declined to reprise her role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-line-up.com/friday-the-13th-part-2-amy-steel-interview/|title=The Girl That Got Away from Jason: An Interview with Amy Steel from Friday the 13th Part 2|work=The Lineup|author=Ferri, Jessica|date=January 13, 2017|accessdate=February 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Friday the 13th Part III'' was originally released in [[3D film|3D]] amongst other horror films such as ''[[Jaws 3-D]]'' and ''[[Amityville 3-D]]'', and is the only film in the series to be released in 3-D. The film was intended to end the series as a trilogy, however the film did not include a moniker in its title to indicate it as such. The film was theatrically released on August 13, 1982, grossing over $36.6 million at the US [[box office]] on a budget of $2.3 million despite negative reviews. The film was the first to remove ''[[E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial]]'' from the number-one box office spot and became the second highest-grossing horror film of 1982, behind ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]''. It has the third most attendance of any film in the ''Friday the 13th'' series, with approximately 11,762,400 tickets sold during its initial run.&lt;ref name=seriesbo&gt;{{cite web|title=Friday the 13th Movies at the Box Office|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=fridaythe13th.htm&amp;adjust_yr=1&amp;p=.htm|website=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Following the events of [[Friday the 13th Part 2|the previous film]], a badly injured and unmasked [[Jason Voorhees]] goes to a lakefront store for a change of clothes. While there, he murders the store owners. Harold is killed with a meat cleaver slammed into his chest, and his wife Edna is impaled through the back of the head with a knitting needle. Meanwhile, Chris Higgins and her friends travel to Higgins Haven, her old home on Crystal Lake, to spend the weekend. The gang includes pregnant Debbie, her boyfriend Andy, prankster Shelly, his blind date Vera (who does not reciprocate his feelings) and stoners Chuck and Chili. After running into a man named Abel, who warns them to turn back, the gang meets Chris' boyfriend Rick at their destination.

At a convenience store, Shelly and Vera get into a confrontation with bikers Ali, Fox, and Loco. Shelly gets in the car and knocks down their motorcycles, impressing Vera. Later, the bikers show up at Higgins Haven, where they take the gas out of the van and attempt to burn the barn down to get even. Jason, who has been hiding in the barn, murders Fox and Loco with a pitchfork before beating Ali unconscious with a pipe wrench. That night, Chris and Rick head out into the woods. Chris tells Rick the main reason she returned is to confront her fears, and she explains about how she was attacked by a deformed man two years earlier, causing her to leave Crystal Lake in order to escape the trauma. 

Back at Higgins Haven, Shelly scares Vera with a [[goaltender mask|hockey mask]] and then wanders into the barn, where Jason slashes his throat. Taking his mask to conceal his face, Jason proceeds to murder the rest of the group.  Vera retrieves Shelly's wallet from under the dock and is shot in the eye with a [[speargun]]. Jason enters the house and bisects a hand-standing Andy with a machete. Debbie finishes her shower and rests on a hammock, where Jason thrusts a knife through her chest from beneath. When the power goes out in the house, Chuck goes downstairs to the basement only for Jason to hurl him into the fuse box, electrocuting him. Chili is then impaled with a hot fire poker.

When Rick's car dies, Chris and Rick are forced to walk back to the house to find it in disarray. Rick steps outside to search the grounds, but Jason grabs him and crushes his skull with his bare hands. Jason then confronts Chris, who narrowly escapes the house and tries to flee in her van. The van breaks down and Chris makes her way to the barn to hide, but Jason attacks her again. Inside the barn, Chris strikes Jason over the head with a shovel, and hangs him. He remains conscious and unmasks himself temporarily to free himself from the noose, where Chris recognizes him as the man who attacked her two years ago. A revived Ali tries to attack Jason, but he is quickly dispatched. The distraction allows Chris to strike Jason in the head with an axe. Jason staggers momentarily towards her before finally collapsing. Exhausted, Chris pushes a [[canoe]] out into the lake and falls asleep.

Chris has a nightmare of an unmasked Jason running towards her from the house before disappearing, which then turns into the decomposing body of [[Pamela Voorhees]], with her head attached, emerging from the lake to pull her in. The following morning, the police arrive and escort a traumatized Chris from Higgins Haven. Jason's body is shown to still be lying in the barn as the lake is shown at peace once again.

==Analysis==
The film scholar Jim Harper has noted ''Friday the 13th Part III'' for its [[final girl]] character, Chris, suffering from childhood [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] resulting from [[sexual assault]], which leaves her unable to engage in intimate relationships{{sfn|Harper|2004|p=37}}, although there is no undisputed evidence of what has really happened to her. In the film, Chris' trauma stems from an attack she survived from Jason Voorhees, which leaves her "mentally scarred."{{sfn|Harper|2004|p=37}} According to Jim Harper's interpretation, in comparison to the final girl characters in other contemporaneous slasher films such as ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978) or ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' (1984), Chris' failure to engage in sexual relations is a function of trauma as opposed to "repress[ion] or dysfunct[ion]."{{sfn|Harper|2004|p=38}}

==Production==
===Screenplay===
Initially, one of the earlier drafts for ''Part III'' was Ginny ([[Amy Steel]]) from the previous film being sent to a psychiatric hospital and confined there. Suffering from the events of ''Part 2'', she eventually finds out that Jason Voorhees survived from his wound and tracks her down to the hospital, murdering the staff and other patients at the hospital.&lt;ref name=clm&gt;{{cite av media|title=Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th|year=2013|publisher=RLJ Entertainment|medium=Documentary|format=Blu-ray|people=Farrands, Daniel (dir.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Steel turned down the role due to her involvement in other projects, resulting in significant script changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weminoredinfilm.com/2014/02/14/13-things-you-may-not-know-about-friday-the-13th-part-3/|title=13 Things You May Not Know About Friday the 13th Part 3|work=We Minored in Film|accessdate=  November 11, 2015|author=Konda, Kelly|date=February 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Screenwriter Ron Kurz, who had written ''Part II'', was offered to write the screenplay, but also turned the project down.&lt;ref name=clm/&gt; Husband-and-wife screenwriting duo Martin Kitrosser and Carol Watson instead were hired to write the screenplay for ''Part III'', completing the first draft.&lt;ref name=clm/&gt; Paramount subsequently brought in Petru Popescu to alter the screenplay and make it "more sinister and menacing."&lt;ref name=clm/&gt; Though the final filmed version of the script contained significant contributions from Popescu, he remained uncredited.&lt;ref name=clm/&gt;

The script for ''Part III'' called for Jason to wear a mask to cover his face, having worn a bag over his head in ''Part 2''; this mask would become a trademark for the character, and one instantly recognizable in popular culture in the years to come.&lt;ref name=amc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fridaythe13thfilms.com/bts/script3.html|title=Friday the 13th Part 3: Script|accessdate=February 25, 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130426003131/http://www.fridaythe13thfilms.com/bts/script3.html|archivedate=April 26, 2013|deadurl=no|via=Fridaythe13thFilms.ocm|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3245216/11-looks-of-terror-jasons-mask-throughout-the-years/|title=11 Looks of Terror!!!

===Casting===
Screenwriter Popescu said casting was based on looks rather than talent,&lt;ref name=week&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theweek.com/articles/543945/friday-13th-part-iii-how-80s-horror-franchise-bet-all-3d--won|title=Friday the 13th Part III: How an '80s horror franchise bet it all on 3-D — and won|last=Meslow|first=Scott|work=[[The Week]]|date=March 13, 2015|accessdate=June 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recalled that his vision of the characters was at significant odds with the cast chosen by director Steve Miner.&lt;ref name=clm/&gt; Dana Kimmel was cast in the lead role of Chris Higgins after Miner had become aware of her involvement in ''[[Sweet Sixteen (1983 film)|Sweet Sixteen]]'', another slasher film.&lt;ref name=clm/&gt; Tracie Savage, who had previously worked as a child actor, was offered the role through her agent.&lt;ref name=clm/&gt; Larry Zerner was discovered by casting directors while walking along a street, and was offered the role of Shelly.&lt;ref name=clm/&gt; For the role of Jason Voorhees, Miner cast British stuntman Richard Brooker.&lt;ref name=clm/&gt;

===Filming===
Georgetown Productions, who had produced the previous two installments in the ''Friday the 13th'' series, was initially involved in the pre-production of ''Part III'', agreeing with distributor [[Paramount Pictures]] to shoot the film with [[3D film|3-D]] cameras,&lt;ref name=afi/&gt; making it the first Paramount film produced in 3-D since ''[[Jivaro (film)]]'' in 1954. Paramount leased two 3-Depix cameras from the photography company Marks Polarized Corporation to shoot the film.&lt;ref name=afi/&gt; Simultaneously, Paramount executive Al Lo Presti was researching current 3-D camera technology with the intention of developing a 3-D lens to be owned and used exclusively by Paramount.&lt;ref name=afi/&gt; 

According to a September 1982 issue of ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, Sirius II Corp. owner Gale Weaver visited the set of ''Friday the 13th Part III'', reportedly over producer Frank Mancuso, Jr.'s worries that faulty projection lenses at cinemas would prevent the film from having a wide theatrical release.&lt;ref name=afi/&gt; Over a two-week period, Weaver developed a prototype lens that would be adaptable to "almost all theater projectors"; Paramount subsequently awarded Sirius II Corp. $1 million to manufacture the lenses, which would be used in projection-- to the exclusion of Marks projection lenses.&lt;ref name=afi/&gt; Marks Polarized Corporation subsequently filed a $25 million lawsuit against Paramount, alleging that the studio was "monopolizing the marketing of 3-D exhibition materials, as well as providing deductions to theaters choosing to lease projection lenses directly from Paramount."&lt;ref name=afi/&gt; Paramount ultimately agreed to credit Marks Polarized Corporation onscreen with the statement: "Filmed utilizing the Marks 3-Depix® Converter," but the company was denied an [[injunction]] that would have required Paramount to change its equipment.&lt;ref name=afi/&gt;

''Friday the 13th Part III'' was shot on location at the Valuzet Movie Ranch in [[Saugus, California]].&lt;ref name=afi&gt;{{cite web|work=[[American Film Institute]] Catalog|title=Friday the 13th Part III|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/56785|accessdate=February 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The house, barn, and lake featured in the film were all custom-built.&lt;ref name=clm/&gt; The house remained on the ranch lot until it burnt down in 2012.&lt;ref name=clm/&gt; Additional photography for the film's grocery store scenes took place at a small market in [[Green Valley, Los Angeles County, California|Green Valley, California]].&lt;ref name=clm/&gt; Because of the newness of the 3-D camera lenses, the shooting process was extensive, with the crew sometimes taking hours to set up a shot, and the cast performing multiple takes of scenes in order for the cinematographer to properly capture the 3-D effects.&lt;ref name=clm/&gt; 

The decision to dress Jason Voorhees in his now-signature [[hockey mask]] occurred during a lighting check on set; the film's 3-D effects supervisor Martin Sadoff was a hockey fan, and supplied a [[Detroit Red Wings]] goaltender mask to Miner.{{sfn|Bracke|2006|pages=84–94}} Miner loved the mask, but during test shots found it was too small. Using a technique called VacuForm, makeup effects director Doug White enlarged the mask and created a new mold to work with. After White finished the molds, art director Terry Ballard placed new red triangles on the mask to give it a unique appearance. Holes were also punched into the mask, and the markings were altered, making it different from Madoff's original template.{{sfn|Bracke|2006|pages=84–94}} There were two prosthetic face masks created for Richard Brooker to wear underneath the hockey mask. One mask was composed of approximately 11 different appliances, and took about six hours to apply to Brooker's face; this mask was used for scenes where the hockey mask was removed. In the scenes where the hockey mask is over the face, a simple head mask was created. This one piece mask would simply slip on over Brooker's head, exposing his face but not the rest of his head.{{sfn|Bracke|2006|pages=84–94}}

The film's music was composed by [[Harry Manfredini]], who previously composed the scores of the series' first two installments.{{sfn|Lentz|2001|pages=1118–19}} A [[disco]] theme was also included in the film, co-written by Manfredini and [[Michael Zager]], who shared a credit with a fictional band called Hot Ice.&lt;ref name=clm/&gt; The theme was included on releases of the film's soundtrack, and according to Manfredini, became popular at disco and [[gay bar|gay club]]s at the time.&lt;ref name=clm/&gt;

Upon the release of the third film in 1982, [[Gramavision Records]] released a [[LP album]] of selected pieces of Manfredini's scores from the first three ''Friday the 13th'' films.{{sfn|Bracke|2006|pages=84–94}} On January 13, 2012, La-La Land Records released a limited edition 6-CD boxset containing Manfredini's scores from the first six films.

==Release==
''Friday the 13th Part III'' was released theatrically in the United States on Friday, August 13, 1982.&lt;ref name=amc&gt;{{cite web|work=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]|title=Friday the 13th, Part III|series=Greatest Movie Series Franchises of All Time: Friday the 13th|url=http://www.filmsite.org/series-friday13th3.html|accessdate=February 25, 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180226030824/http://www.filmsite.org/series-friday13th3.html|deadurl=no|archivedate=February 26, 2018|author=Dirks, Tim|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first-ever 3-D film to receive a wide domestic release, opening on 1,079 screens.&lt;ref name=afi/&gt; Of these screens, 813 were 3-D capable, while the remainder consisted of drive-in theaters which were unable to accommodate the format.&lt;ref name=afi/&gt; In order to allow non-3-D-capable theaters to screen the film, Paramount completed a seven-week-long conversion process that cost $2 million, "an amount equal to the picture’s entire negative cost."&lt;ref name=afi/&gt; It was also the first film in the series to be presented in [[Dolby Stereo]] upon its theatrical release.

===Box office===
The film grossed $9,406,522 its opening weekend and broke the horror opening record held by the original ''Friday the 13th'' (1980). Domestically, the film made a grand total of $36,690,067. It placed number 21 on the list of the top-grossing films of 1982, facing strong competition from other high-profile horror releases such as ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]'', ''[[Creepshow]]'', ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'', ''[[Halloween III: Season of the Witch]]'', ''[[Visiting Hours]]'', ''[[Amityville II: The Possession]]'', ''[[Silent Rage]]'', ''[[The Beast Within]]'', ''[[Cat People (1982 film)|Cat People]]'' and ''[[Venom (1981 film)|Venom]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Friday the 13th Part III (1982)|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=friday13th3.htm|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=February 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981)|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=friday13th2.htm|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=February 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2014, it still stands as the fourth highest-grossing film in the ''Friday the 13th'' series and the third best selling in ticket sales; with approximately 11,762,400 tickets sold, it is surpassed only by the [[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|1980 original]] with 14,778,700 tickets and [[Freddy vs. Jason]] with 13,701,900 tickets). The film also stands as the tenth highest-grossing R-rated film of 1982, the second-highest grossing horror film of 1982, the sixth largest box office opening of 1982, and adjusted for inflation it is the ninth highest-grossing [[slasher film]] of all time.&lt;ref name=seriesbo/&gt;

===Critical response===
''Friday the 13th Part III'' received generally negative reviews from critics upon its theatrical release. The review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 12% of 25 film critics have given the film a positive review; the average rating is 3.6 out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Friday the 13th Part 3 (1982)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/friday_the_13th_part_3/|work=[[Flixster]]|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate= December 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Linda Gross noted: "Ironically, ''Friday the 13th Part 3'' is so terrible that ''Friday the 13th Part 1'' and ''Friday the 13th Part 2'' don't seem so bad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Gross, Linda|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|title='Friday the 13th Part 3' Even Worse|date=August 16, 1982|page=G6|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/doc/153227145.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Aug+16%2C+1982&amp;author=Gross%2C+Linda&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+%281923-Current+File%29&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=G6&amp;desc=%27FRIDAY+THE+13TH+PART+3%27+EVEN+WORSE|series=Section VI}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated that it "would be a little better than ''Part I'' or ''Part II'' even without 3-D". In continuing to compare the film to its predecessors, Maslin commented that "it's a little more adept at teasing the audience."&lt;ref name=maslin&gt;{{cite web|last=Maslin|first=Janet|title=Movie Review – Friday the 13th Part 3|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A0CE7DA143BF930A2575BC0A964948260|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=December 9, 2012|date=August 13, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Schickel of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine wrote: "Maybe all sequels should be made in 3-D... It is all so gruesome that horror turns to humor and fun comes from the appreciation of being cleverly conned by Steve Miner. The way the eyeball of one of Jason's victims pops out of his skull and seems to sail over the audience's head is alone worth buying a ticket and putting on funny glasses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|title=Friday the 13th Part III|author=Schickel, Richard|p=89|date=August 30, 1982|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene Siskel]] praised the film's "impressive" 3-D effects, particularly in the opening credits, also noting its slowburn approach, as the "heavy-duty slaughter doesn't come until one hour into the film," but criticized it for "lingering over the impending deaths the young women, who are stalked by the camera so we find ourselves in the revolting position of stalking them too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author=Siskel, Gene|author-link=Gene Siskel|title='Friday—Part III': Usual gore spoils cheery 3-D star|p=7|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23267420/chicago_tribune/|via=Newspapers.com}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entertainment-trade magazine ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' provided a general consensus stating, "''Friday the 13th'' was dreadful and took in more than $17 million. ''Friday the 13th Part 2'' was just as bad and took in more than $10 million. ''Friday the 13th Part 3'' is terrible, too." The magazine added, "There are some dandy 3-D sequences, however, of a yo-yo going up and down and popcorn popping."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Variety Staff|title=Review – Friday the 13th Part III|url=https://variety.com/1981/film/reviews/friday-the-13th-part-iii-1200425206/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=  December 9, 2012|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, ''[[TV Guide]]'' awarded the film one out of five stars, noting that it "exploits precisely the same formula plot as its predecessors, though the gore is a bit deemphasized, with the special-effects crew concentrating on the nicely done 3-D depth work for a change. It's still trash, however, and also made a ridiculous amount of money."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[TV Guide]]|title=Friday the 13th Part III|url=http://www.tvguide.com/movies/friday-the-13th-part-iii/review/123802/|author=TV Guide Staff|accessdate=December 23, 2017}} {{rating|1|5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a retrospective, Scott Meslow of ''[[The Week]]'' called it "an under-sung camp classic — cornier and goofier than either of its predecessors".&lt;ref name=week/&gt; 

The film has been noted by critics as one of the most violent of the series, with a total of fourteen deaths.{{sfn|Clover|2015|p=82}} Jason's mask in this film became the molded appearance of Jason in ''[[Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter]]'' and in later installments. For his appearance in the film, Jason Voorhees was nominated for [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains]] as one of the Top 50 Villains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=400 nominated screen characters AFI's Top 50 heroes and top 50 villains|url=http://www.afi.com/100Years/downloads.aspx|work=[[American Film Institute]]|accessdate=February 25, 2018|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meslow cites the film's 3-D effects as paving the way for later horror films which also used the technique.&lt;ref name=week/&gt;

==Home media==
''Friday the 13th Part III'' was first made available on home video on [[VHS]], [[Betamax]], [[Capacitance Electronic Disc|CED]], and [[LaserDisc]] and later on [[DVD]], with the film presented only in 2D form. There was also a [[Video High Density|VHD]] release for Japan (''[[Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter|Part IV]]'' and ''[[Friday the 13th: A New Beginning|Part V]]'' would follow). The 3-D version of the film was eventually released as a part of the film's DVD "Deluxe Edition" on February 3, 2009. The "Deluxe Edition" and eventual [[Blu-ray]] release include both the 2D and 3-D versions of the film, as well as two pairs of cyan and red 3-D glasses designed to look like Jason's mask.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Liebman|first=Martin|title=Friday the 13th Part 3 Blu-ray Review|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Friday-the-13th-Part-3-Blu-ray/4733/#Review|publisher=Blu-ray.com|accessdate=8 December 2012|date=12 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''La Bella Ingeborg''' ('''Valborg Elisabeth Gröning''', but often referred to as '''Bojan'''),&lt;ref name="Montessori"&gt;[http://www.skola.gavle.se/monte/docs/Projekt/Lite%20historia%20ikring%20cirkus.htm Lite historia ikring cirkus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051108141533/http://www.skola.gavle.se/monte/docs/Projekt/Lite%20historia%20ikring%20cirkus.htm |date= 8 November 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Gävle]] 3 April 1890 - 24 December 1970) was a Swedish [[circus]] princess, introduced as "The Prodigy Child".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lansmuseetgavleborg.se/pages.asp?PageID=172&amp;MenuID=1135 Manegen – Ateljé och cirkusutställning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812035512/http://www.lansmuseetgavleborg.se/pages.asp?PageID=172&amp;MenuID=1135 |date=12 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ingeborg was born into poverty and put up for adoption at the age of four by circus artists Julia Andersson and Knut Lindberg.&lt;ref name="Montessori" /&gt; At age 15, she married a [[circus clown]], '''Charles Bazola'''. They travelled around the world performing with the circus Fortuna &amp; Bazola. 

After Ingeborg gave birth to a daughter, '''Héléne Bazola''', the couple moved back to Gävle. Ingeborg delivered newspapers for a living before she died in 1970. She is buried at the cemetery in [[Gävle]], in a grave with other circus artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gavlepocket.se/Gavle_pocket_Hela_boken.pdf Kultur- och fritidsguide: A till Ö i Gävleregionen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110428205217/http://www.gavlepocket.se/Gavle_pocket_Hela_boken.pdf |date=28 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Henry Sargent''' (21 November 1894 – 7 May 1963), best known by his [[stage name]] '''Max Miller''' and also known as "The Cheeky Chappie", was an English [[comedian]] who was widely regarded as the greatest stand-up comedian of his generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Vol. 38|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-861388-1|pages=215–216}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made films, toured in [[revues]] and [[music hall]], and sang and recorded songs, some of which he wrote. He was known for his flamboyant suits, his wicked charm, and his risqué jokes which often got him into trouble with the censors.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Miller was born as Thomas Henry Sargent on 21 November 1894 in Hereford Street, [[Kemptown, Brighton|Kemptown]], [[Brighton]], [[Sussex]].  He was the second child of James Sargent, a labourer and Alice (née West), a flower seller; Miller had three brothers and two sisters. His parents were poor and often unable to pay rent so were forced to move to other parts of the town. Owing to this, Miller frequently changed schools until he reached 12, when he left altogether.  He tried various jobs, labouring, delivering milk, selling fish and chips, [[caddying]] at the Brighton and Hove Golf Course and finally trained to be a [[motor mechanic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Richard Anthony|title=Old Time Variety - An Illustrated History|year=2011|publisher=Remember When|location=Barnsley|isbn=978-1-84468-1242|pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a youth he was nicknamed "Swanky Sargent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=East|first=John E.|title=Max Miller the Cheeky Chappie|year=1977|publisher=W. H. Allen|location=London|isbn=0491-02260-3|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the outbreak of the [[First World War|war]] in 1914, Miller volunteered for the army. He joined the [[Royal Sussex Regiment]] and, after serving in France, was posted to India and a year later to [[Mesopotamia]], where he was temporarily blinded for three days. This experience stayed with him all his life, and in later years he did much work to help the blind. During his time in the army, he started a troops’ [[Concert Party (entertainment)|concert party]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Stage|date=21 February 1952|page=1|title=The Incomparable Max Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Start of career in show business===

Demobilized from the army, he found work to be in short supply. He had lost his mother to the [[1918 flu pandemic]]. He had his sights on performing in [[London]] and obtained a booking in the [[Shoreditch]] Hall in 1919. He was not experienced enough for the type of venue and lasted only a week. Returning to [[Brighton]] he saw an advertisement for artists to join Jack Sheppard’s concert party in an alfresco theatre on Brighton beach. He applied and joined as a light comedian for the 1919 summer season.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; While with the concert party, he met his wife Frances Kathleen Marsh, who was a [[contralto]] in the group.&lt;ref name="The Stage, 28 July 1921, p.4 advertisement"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Stage|date=28 July 1921|page=4|title=Kathleen Marsh Contralto, Soubrette &amp; Dancer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kathleen Marsh came from a [[middle-class]] family whose parents came to Brighton from [[Dorset]] shortly before she was born in 1896. Her elder brother Ernest Marsh served as a Brighton [[alderman]] for 43 years and became [[mayor]] of the then town from 1949 to 1950.

In summer 1920 Harry toured nationwide in ''The Rogues'', a concert party. The following year Harry and Kathleen toured in a revue/musical called ''The Girl''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Stage|date=30 December 1920|page=4|title=The Girl}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in [[Plymouth]] they married at the parish church in Tormoham, [[Devon]] on 17 February 1921. As well as being a performer, Kathleen was an astute businesswoman and thereafter did much to develop her husband's career. She suggested that he should change his name to Max Miller. Later a press notice described Max as the Cheeky Chappie, and the nickname stuck.

Max and Kathleen formed a [[double act]] for a while but it became obvious to her that Max was the stronger performer and that he would be better as a solo act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Richard Anthony|title=Old Time Variety: an Illustrated History|year=2011|publisher=Remember When|location=Barnsley|isbn=978 1 84468 124 2|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On the road to stardom===

Through the '20s, he was regularly touring in revues. In 1922 he was in a show presented by the Sydney Syndicate, ''There You Are Then''. In 1923 he toured with the Ernest Binn Arcadians. 1924 saw him joining a revue called ''Crisps''. But during that summer he returned to Jack Sheppard’s Concert Party on the Brighton seafront.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Stage|date=12 June 1924|page=19|title=BRIGHTON Jack Sheppard's Entertainers}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925 he continued in the revue ''Crisps'' and in November joined the cast of ''Ten to One On'' which starred [[Jimmy James (comedian)|Jimmy James]]. This show ran until February 1926 when he got work in variety or cine-variety, the latter a show half film and half live acts. In September he was booked in the [[Holborn Empire]], his first engagement there, where he was spotted by impresario [[Tom Arnold (theatre impresario)|Tom Arnold]] who booked him to star in his next revue, ''Piccadilly''. It opened in [[Birmingham]] and toured the country. His co-star was the 21-year-old [[Florence Desmond]]. After that he was booked by [[Fred Karno]] to appear in ''The Show'' and in May joined a touring cabaret revue called ''XYZ'' to the end of the year. After a few weeks in variety, he was back in revue starring in Francis Laider’s ''Tipperary Tim''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gänzl|first=Kurt|title=The British Musical Theatre Volume II|year=1986|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0333397442|pages=290, 294}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kept him busy until February 1929 when he appointed a new agent, Julius Darewski. This was a turning point in his career. In May he made his first appearance at the [[London Palladium]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Stage|date=16 May 1929|pages=3, 13|title=London Palladium Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in variety. He returned there in October and, in November, joined the cast of ''Fools in Paradise'' which took him to March 1930. This would be his last revue for some time.

Miller much preferred to perform solo, and from 1930 onwards, he appeared in variety in various large theatres including the London Palladium and the [[Holborn Empire]]. In those days instant success was unheard of, and Miller, like any other performer, had to earn his fame through a long apprenticeship. In May 1931 he appeared in his first [[Royal Variety Performance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Stage|date=14 May 1931|page=4|title=Royal Variety Performance}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radio]] broadcasts followed.

In 1932 he made his first recording, ''Confessions of a Cheeky Chappie'', on the [[Broadcast Twelve Records]] label. After this initial success, he was wooed by [[HMV Records|HMV]] and made a number of records for them. In 1953 he changed to [[Philips Records|Philips]] and then to [[Pye Records|Pye]].

Miller was given a [[cameo role]] in the film ''[[The Good Companions (1933 film)|The Good Companions]]''. In it he played the part of a music publisher selling a song to a pianist, played by [[John Gielgud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morley|first=Sheridan|title=John Gielgud: The Authorised Biography of John Gielgud|year=2001|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton|location=London|isbn=0-340-36803-9|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was not credited for his role, his three-minute debut was impressive, got him noticed and led to his making a further 13 films working up from small parts to starring roles. Considered his best film, ''[[Educated Evans]]'' (1936), which was based on an [[Edgar Wallace]] story and filmed by [[Warner Bros.]], has been [[Lost film|lost]]. His last but one film was ''[[Hoots Mon! (1940 film)|Hoots Mon!]]'' (1940). He played the part of a southern [[England|English]] comedian called Harry Hawkins. In the film there is a scene in which Harry Hawkins appears on the stage in a [[variety theatre]]. The act is Miller’s, and the sequence is the only one in existence giving us an idea of his stage act. It is invariably included in any [[documentary film|documentary]] made about him.

===Stardom===

[[File:Max Miller plaque.JPG|thumb|Commemorative plaque at 160 Marine Parade, Brighton (2006)]]
Miller’s act on a variety bill usually lasted between 20 and 30 minutes. It would begin with the orchestra playing his [[Theme music|signature tune]], ''[[Mary from the Dairy]]''. A [[Followspot|spotlight]] aimed on the curtain by the wings would anticipate his appearance. There would be excitement in the audience. He would sometimes wait for up to 10 seconds until he appeared leading to resounding applause, walk to the [[microphone]] and just stand there in his costume, a gloriously colourful suit with [[plus-fours]], a [[kipper tie]], [[trilby]] and [[spectator shoe|co-respondent shoes]] and wait for the laughter to begin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Major|first=John|title=My Old Man - A Personal History of Music Hall|year=2012|publisher=Harper Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-00-745013-8|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Miller's material was risqué, he never swore on stage and disapproved of those who did. He used [[double entendre]] and when telling a joke would often leave out the last word or words for the audience to complete.

His act would be punctuated by songs, sentimental songs like ''My Old Mum'' or comic songs such as ''Twin Sisters''. Sometimes he would accompany himself on guitar or entertain with a [[soft shoe]] shuffle. He wrote and co-wrote a number of songs.

He was very much a [[southern England|southern English]] comedian. He preferred being booked in theatres in London or the south, so he could return to his beloved Brighton after a show. But in 1932 he embarked on his only overseas tour, when he sailed to [[Cape Town]] to appear in [[Johannesburg]] and [[Pretoria]], [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Balmoral Castle Passenger List: date of departure 22 April 1932 ([[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]])&lt;/ref&gt;

After a number of years as a solo act in variety, he appeared in [[George Black (producer)|George Black]]’s wartime revue ''Haw Haw!'' at the Holborn Empire from December 1939 to July 1940. George Black’s next revue ''Apple Sauce'' opened in August 1940 at the Holborn Empire co-starring [[Vera Lynn]]. After the theatre was bombed, the show transferred to the [[London Palladium]] where it ran until November 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Stage|date=27 February 1941|page=3|title=Apple Sauce}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that Miller was back touring in variety and broke all records as the highest paid variety artist, earning £1,025 in a single week at the [[Coventry]] Hippodrome in February, 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=East|first=John M.|title=Max Miller the Cheeky Chappie|year=1977|publisher=W. H. Allen|location=London|isbn=0491-02260-3|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, he topped the bill in ''[[Bernard Delfont]] presents International Variety'' at the [[London Casino]]. In his review of the show, Lionel Hale, theatre critic of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', described Miller as the "Gold of the music hall".&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Mail'', 28 October 1947&lt;/ref&gt;

===The comeback===

Miller appeared in three [[Royal Variety Performance]]s (1931, 1937 and 1950). In the last he was annoyed that he was only given six minutes while the American comedian [[Jack Benny]] got 20 minutes, so he abandoned his script and went on for 12 minutes ending with riotous applause. But this had a devastating effect on the schedule. [[Val Parnell]], the producer, was furious and told Miller that he would never work for him again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fisher|first=John|title=Funny Way to be a Hero.|year=1973|publisher=Muller|location=London|isbn=9780584100976|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after 18 months of Miller touring in secondary theatres, he was invited back to the "number ones", the [[Moss Empires]] and returned in triumph to the London Palladium. This revitalised his career and with it came a new recording contract, this time with [[Philips]]. He was back on radio and appeared on television, but his television appearances were never a great success. The new medium did not suit his style; he needed the feedback only a live theatre audience could give him and the freedom to use his naughty material.

Miller appeared regularly in all the large variety halls in and around London, the [[Hackney Empire]], Chelsea Palace, Chiswick, Finsbury Park and Wood Green Empires, Metropolitan Music Hall and it was in the latter he recorded the [[LP album|LP]], ''Max at the Met''&lt;ref&gt;''Max at the Met'': [[Nixa Records|Nixa]] NPT 19026&lt;/ref&gt; in 1957.

===The final years===

In 1958 Miller suffered a [[heart attack]]. After recovery he needed to take life easier. His last [[West End theatre|West End]] appearance took place at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]] in April 1959 and the last ever in variety in [[Folkestone]] in December 1960. He continued to make records, his last in January 1963 with [[Lonnie Donegan]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Market Song'' and ''Tit Bits'': [[Pye Records|Pye]] 7N 15493&lt;/ref&gt; He died&lt;ref&gt;''Times Obituary'', 9 May 1963&lt;/ref&gt; on 7 May 1963 in his home and was [[cremated]] in the Downs Crematorium, Brighton. A memorial tablet is mounted on a wall in the Garden of Remembrance. His wife Kathleen outlived him by nine years, dying in a [[Hove]] nursing home in 1972.

With dwindling work in variety, brought about by the increasing popularity of television, he commented, "When I’m dead and gone, the game’s finished".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=East|first=John M.|title=Max Miller the Cheeky Chappie|year=1977|publisher=W H Allen|location=London|isbn=0491-02260-3|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has frequently been suggested that [[John Osborne]] modelled the character [[Archie Rice]] in his play ''[[The Entertainer (play)|The Entertainer]]'' on Miller. John Osborne denied it and in his autobiography he wrote, "This is not so. Archie was a man. Max was a god, a saloon-bar [[Priapus]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Osborne|first=John|title=A Better Class of Person: An Autobiography 1929-1956|year=1981|publisher=Dutton|isbn=0525066349|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship==

The laws on censorship were strict during Miller's lifetime. Those responsible for censorship were the [[Lord Chamberlain]] in London and local [[police authority|watch committees]] in the provinces. Miller's material needed approval by those bodies but by using [[innuendo]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/7373 ''Beyond a Joke'' Richard A Baker]&lt;/ref&gt; leaving out the last word or words of a joke, he  could get away with much risqué and saucy material. However, he never swore or told a 'dirty joke' on stage.

In one of his acts he would take from his pocket two books, one a white book and the other a blue book, explaining to the audience that these are joke books and asking them which the audience would like; the crowd almost always chose the blue book. The jokes in the ‘blue book’ were the naughty ones. For example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I went skating the other week with a young lady on ice and we’d been going around for quite a while and she kept on falling down.&lt;br /&gt;I said, “Have you hurt yourself?”&lt;br /&gt; She said, “No, I’m sorry to spoil your fun.” &lt;br /&gt;I said, “You’re not spoiling my fun. It’ll keep on ice.”&lt;ref&gt;''That's Nice Maxie'': Pye LP #NPL18064 (1961)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Or he would leave the last word out for the audience to finish and blamed them if they laughed.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When roses are red,&lt;br /&gt;
They’re ready for plucking.&lt;br /&gt;
When a girl is sixteen,&lt;br /&gt;
She’s ready for … ’Ere&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fisher|first=John|title=Funny Way to be a Hero|year=1973|publisher=Muller|location=London|isbn=0584100973|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

He would then say, "I know exactly what you are saying to yourself, you’re wrong, I know what you’re saying. You wicked lot. You’re the sort of people that get me a bad name!"

It was said that Miller was banned by the BBC twice, first in the 1930s&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Express'',p.23, 30 September 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; and then in the 1950s. But these rumours only helped Miller's reputation as daring and naughty, and led to increased box office sales.

==Legacy==

Miller influenced many comedians during his lifetime and since. His jokes live on and are often told by other comedians. The late comedian [[Max Bygraves|Walter William Bygraves]] became known as "Max Bygraves" after his impersonation of Miller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bygraves|first=Max|title=I Wanna Tell You a Story|year=1976|publisher=W. H. Allen|location=London|isbn=0491015968|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Miller is also featured on the cover of [[the Beatles]]' "[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (album)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]".

The biography, ''Max Miller the Cheeky Chappie'' by John M. East was published in 1977. A paperback version was issued in 1993 with additional material. Two paperbacks containing Miller's jokes have been published: ''The Max Miller Blue Book'' compiled by [[Barry Took]] and illustrated by cartoonist Trog (1975)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Took|first=Barry|title=The Max Miller Blue Book|year=1975|publisher=Robson Books|location=London|isbn=0-903895-53-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and ''The Max Miller Appreciation Society's Blue Book'' compiled by members with a foreword by [[Roy Hudd]] (2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Max Miller Appreciation Society's Blue Book|year=2001|publisher=The Max Miller Appreciation Society|location=Brighton|isbn=0-9541345-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several radio and television documentaries have been produced including [[Gerald Scarfe]]’s ''The Girls Who Do'' (''40 Minutes'', BBC, 1989) and ''[[Heroes of Comedy: Max Miller]]'' (1994). ''[[Here's a Funny Thing]]'' a play featuring [[John Bardon]] by R.W. Shakespeare which had been staged at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Stage|date=29 January 1981|page=11|title=Distilling the Essence of Genius Max Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and at the [[Fortune Theatre]] in London was broadcast on [[Channel Four]] in November 1982

In 1999 the Max Miller Appreciation Society was formed in Brighton. Its main purpose is to keep his memory alive. It has erected a bronze statue sculptured by [[Peter Webster (artist)|Peter Webster]] in the [[Royal Pavilion]] Gardens, New Road, Brighton (unveiled 1 May 2005; re-sited August 2007) and mounted two [[blue plaque]]s on his former homes on Ashcroft in Kingston Lane, [[Shoreham-by-Sea]] (2000) and at 160 Marine Parade, Brighton (2006). In 2009 the Society curated an exhibition devoted to Miller's life and career in Bardsley's Fish Restaurant, Baker Street, Brighton.

The current titleholder is Nirada Chetsadapriyakun who won 2nd Runner-up in ''Miss All Nations Thailand 2017''. She will represent [[Thailand]] at [[Miss Earth 2018]].

== History ==

===2001-2012 and 2015-2017===
The first ever Thai representative in Miss Earth was Victoria Wachholz who participated in [[Miss Earth 2001]]. In 2002, Bangkok Broadcasting &amp; T.V. Co., Ltd. ([[Channel 7 (Thailand)|Channel 7]]) was awarded the rights and conducted the [[Miss Thailand Universe]] pageant and sent the winner to [[Miss Universe 2002]] while the 1st Runner-up to Miss Earth pageant. In 2004, Radchadawan Khampeng competed in [[Miss Earth 2004]] and placed in the Top 8 and became Thailand's first semi-finalist in the Miss Earth pageant.

[[File:Miss Earth Thailand Logo.png|thumb|150px|right|Miss Earth Thailand's logo in 2014]]

In 2012, [[Royal Thai Army Radio and Television Channel 5]] was awarded the rights to host and changed name of the pageant. The pageant sent 1st Runner-up to compete at [[Miss Earth]] where it was represented by [[Waratthaya Wongchayaporn]].

The second title of Miss Grand Thailand was designated as Miss Earth Thailand won by [[Sasi Sintawee]].

The '''Multiverse''' is the [[shared fictional universe]] depicted on ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' cards, novels, comics, and other supplemental products.&lt;ref&gt;http://epicstream.com/news/Magic-The-Gathering-Finally-Meets-Dungeons--Dragons-For-The-Ultimate-Fantasy-RPG&lt;/ref&gt; Though ''Magic'' is a strategy game, an intricate storyline underlies the cards released in each expansion.  On the cards, elements of this [[multiverse]] are shown in the card art and through quotations and descriptions on the bottom of most cards (called [[flavor text]]). Novels and anthologies published by [[HarperPrism]] and [[Wizards of the Coast]] (WOTC), and the [[comic book]]s published by [[Valiant Comics|Armada Comics]] expand upon the settings and characters hinted at on the cards. WOTC also publishes a weekly story (most often related to the plane explored in the current expansion set) in the Magic Fiction column, previously known as Official Magic Fiction and Uncharted Realms.

In the early days of the game, the name 'Dominia' was used to describe the story universe but, due to confusion with the name of the plane/planet where the central events of ''Magic'' occur ([[#Dominaria|Dominaria]]), it fell into disuse and was replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dommermuth|first=Brady|title=Ask Wizards - February, 2007|url=http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/ask-wizards-february-2007-2007-02-01|work=Daily MTG|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cosmology==
The Multiverse is a collection of planes (described somewhat like [[pocket universe]]s) which are usually named after the primary planet contained within them. Travel between these planes is possible, and powerful beings known as Planeswalkers are capable of traversing between them.&lt;ref&gt;https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/you-are-planeswalker-2008-07-25&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Blind Eternities===

The Blind Eternities is the term more commonly used to describe the space between the planes of reality. Filled with chaotic, raw energies such as Aether, Mana and temporal energy, it is a place where matter and life as known within the planes of reality cannot subsist. (The only exceptions are the Planeswalkers, who briefly pass physically through it when they "walk" between planes.) As such, not much is known or understood about the Blind Eternities. Unfathomable, reality-warping cosmic horrors known as the Eldrazi are said to be born there.

===Aether===

Aether (previously spelled Æther) is the main type of energy filling the blind eternities, although it can also appear in variable quantities within the planes. It is inextricably associated with magic within Magic's [[shared fictional universe]] and the use of the word in several Magic cards implies that casting magic involves channeling and manipulating Aether. Similarly, "summoning" the creatures around which combat and much of gameplay in Magic revolves is described as "pulling (them) from the Aether".

===Dominaria===
The majority of the ''Magic'' story was set on the plane of Dominaria prior to [[Mirrodin]], encompassing long time periods each detailed in certain card sets or books. Dominaria is a unique nexus between all the other planes of the Multiverse.  Occasionally, such as in [[Time Spiral]], the storyline returns to it.

==Storylines==
* '''The Thran''':  The Thran were a race of master artificers who were destroyed by [[Yawgmoth]] and his [[Phyrexians]] (converted Thran following him) during the Thran-Phyrexian War about 5,000 years before the [[Antiquities (Magic: The Gathering)|Brothers]]. They are only hinted at in the game, but [[J. Robert King]]'s novel ''The Thran'' explores their culture in some depth.
* '''[[Antiquities (Magic: The Gathering)|The Brothers' War]]''': War between Urza and Mishra, two brothers who were trained by the archaeologist and artificer Tocasia in creating magical devices based on ancient Thran technology. As their powers grew, so did their enmity, eventually erupting in an all-out war utilizing powerful constructs. Marshalling vast armies aided by their impressive machines (some of the old Thran Empire, some newly made) the brothers staged a series of battles. The war devastated the land of Terisiare on the plane of Dominaria and culminated in a world-devastating climax on the island of Argoth. This caused the Dark, the climate changes which led to the Fall of the Sarpadian Empires and finally to the Ice Age. This story is the basis for the ''Antiquities'' expansion and later the ''Urza's Saga'' Block.
* '''[[The Dark (Magic: The Gathering)|The Dark]]'''  The devastation wrought by the Brothers led to the fall of many civilizations and the beginning of a Dark Age in Dominaria. The destruction of Argoth caused a [[nuclear winter]] that would later lead to the Dominarian Ice Age.  This story is portrayed in the ''Fallen Empires'' and ''The Dark'' expansions. In this age Terisiare's survivors were bitterly opposed to magic. Tiny, insular villages dotted a wasted, goblin-infested landscape. Fanatical priests controlled a few powerful city-states. Preachers and witch-hunters hunted the countryside for the few remaining wizards. Despite this oppression, it is during this era that mortal wizards first discover the five-color nature of magic. This story is fully explained in the novel ''The Gathering Dark'' by Jeff Grubb. The following Ice Age is detailed in ''Eternal Ice'' and ''The Shattered Alliance'', also by Jeff Grubb.
*'''[[Fallen Empires (Magic: The Gathering)|Fallen Empires]]''' The harsh climatic changes that followed the destruction of Argoth caused the southern continent, Sarpadia, to struggle for survival. The elves and humans of Sarpadia begin breeding primitive but adaptable subspecies: saprolings and thrulls, respectively. These creatures soon turn on their creators and terrorize the people of Sarpadia, while the Merfolk suffered an invasion of crustacean-like homarids, which benefitted from the cooling oceans. Barraged by invading orcs, goblins, homarids, thrulls, and even fungus, the civilizations of Sarpadia are destroyed, and the continent falls into darkness.
*'''[[Ice Age (Magic: The Gathering)|The Ice Age]]''':  The climate-altering effects of the devastation continued leading to a global ice age. New empires rose and fought in the cold. Eventually this cooling climate was reversed and life returned to normal.  This story is portrayed in the ''Ice Age'', ''Alliances'', and ''Coldsnap'' expansions, and in the novels ''Eternal Ice'' and ''Shattered Alliance'' by Jeff Grubb. Jeff Grubb also wrote a short story "continuing" the story for ''Coldsnap'', which is located in the Player's Guide insert you can find in a ''Coldsnap'' Fat Pack.
*'''[[Homelands (Magic: The Gathering)|The Homelands]]'''  This short interlude depicts the decimated plane of Ulgrotha, in which many civilizations struggle for power against Baron Sengir, a powerful vampire who has manipulated a number of other characters into serving his ends. The [[planeswalker]]s Serra and Feroz turn the balance in favor of the light, but are killed in battle against a crazed alien planeswalker. The story has no concrete ending.
*'''[[Mirage (Magic: The Gathering)|Jamuraa]]''': The story concerns three of the most powerful nations of [[Jamuraa]] (a tropical continent) — the militaristic kingdom of the Zhalfirins, the religious state of Femeref, and the trading province of the Suq'Ata empire. Zhalfir was the warrior nation, based mainly on red. Femeref was mainly white, and featured clerics and healers, while the seafaring traders of Suq'Ata were mostly blue. Mirage concerned these three nations and their struggle against the evil wizard Kaervek. Kaervek has imprisoned the powerful wizard and diplomat Mangara in an amber prison and the bulk of the story details the Jamuraans attempting to free Mangara. In addition to these events the [[planeswalker]] Teferi has caused his island to disappear from existence for almost 200 years. It is the phasing of the entire island that led Kaervek and Mangara to Jamuraa in the first place.
*'''The Phyrexian Invasion''':  After millennia of peace, the machine-like Phyrexians, who originate on a hellish mechanical world, invade the world of Dominaria led by the former Thran [[Yawgmoth]] from the [[pocket universe]] of Rath. The Phyrexian invasion divides in many sub-stories.
** '''[[Urza block|The Urza Saga]]''': Following the destruction of Argoth, Urza becomes a planeswalker and foresees the invasion of Dominaria. Urza's travels lead the war to the peaceful universe of Serra's realm which is destroyed by Phyrexian armies; survivors of the plane flee to Dominaria and Ulgrotha. In preparation for the invasion, Urza creates the Tolarian academy, a research and development laboratory-school in which he and other mighty wizards train mages for the upcoming invasion and  experiment on weaponry development, time-travel and genetic manipulation in hopes of creating a defensive army. The time experiments lead to a temporal collapse and the academy becomes laced with time fractures, which are both dangerous and useful to the inhabitants. Urza himself develops a fearful Legacy Weapon and Karn, a self-aware golem which, combined, can defeat any foe.  This story arc is linked to The Thran, Antiquities, The Dark, Ice Age and Homelands and is depicted in the books ''The Brothers War'', ''Planeswalker'' and ''Time Streams''.
** '''[[Rath block|The Legacy]]''': This follows the travels of many brave adventurers from all across Dominaria who, aboard Urza's vessel "The Weatherlight", seek to collect the different artifacts left by Urza and necessary to assemble the Legacy Weapon. Opposed to them, many Phyrexian allies or lords will try to stop them from their quest. This story arc is the longest in the Magic continuity, and its characters are depicted in the Weatherlight, Tempest, Stronghold, Exodus, Mercadian Masques, and Nemesis card sets; later, the story continues and concludes in the Invasion arc.
** '''[[Masques block|Prophecy]]''':  Parallel to the "Legacy" history, and following the Mirage and Urza's Saga histories, in Dominaria the warrior kingdom of Keld ensues war all across Jamuraa. Many wizards from the Tolarian academy aid the federation of Jamuraa and succeed in stopping the Keldons' warmongering.
** '''[[Invasion (Magic: The Gathering)|The Invasion]]''': The dreaded Phyrexians finally come to Dominaria across many "planar portals" and Urza, who has been spending thousands of years planning a defense against the Invasion, implements his plans. The Weatherlight leads the Dominarian forces, but the widespread chaos, and the uncompromising nature of Urza's tactics, threaten to destroy the plane. The arrival of Yawgmoth himself leads to the Apocalypse, but he is finally defeated by the fully assembled Legacy Weapon. The Invasion itself occurs in the ''Invasion'' block, but is linked to all previous story arcs. From this point on, the publishers switch to a series of self-contained plotlines with occasional links to older stories, rather than sweeping epics spanning years of card releases.
*'''[[Odyssey (Magic: The Gathering)|Odyssey]]''': One hundred years after the devastation of the Invasion, Dominaria is still in the process of rebuilding. This part of the story takes place in Otaria, a devastated continent that was, surprisingly, the place least affected by the Invasion. It centers on Kamahl, a barbarian, and his quest to get the Mirari, a magical orb of seemingly endless power.
**'''[[Onslaught (Magic: The Gathering)|Onslaught]]''': Having acquired the Mirari with devastating effects, Kamahl renounces it and tries to be rid of it, but the events he triggered have gone far beyond his control. The story shifts to a battle between Akroma, an angel, and Phage, Kamahl's corrupted sister, who kills with a touch. As zealous armies gather behind each of them, Kamahl needs to end their escalating conflict before Otaria itself is decimated. To this end, he recovers the slumbering Mirari and allies himself with three ancient gods who have been waiting for these events to happen again. This story is linked to Mirrodin, and sets the scene for the first major storyline not set on Dominaria.
*'''[[Mirrodin]]''':  The story of Mirrodin takes place on a new, metal world, created by the planeswalker Karn and populated by races stolen from other worlds. Glissa, an elf, and her allies strive to assemble the mythical Kaldra, so that they can defeat the crazed Memnarch, who lives inside the hollow world. All the while, we learn about the history of Mirrodin, and its loose, but nonetheless present, connection to previous storylines based on Dominaria. The Mirrodin story is the first of the new year-long, three-set story arcs, having started in 2003 with the release of ''Moons of Mirrodin'' and continuing with 2004's ''The Darksteel Eye'' and ''The Fifth Dawn''.
*'''[[Kamigawa|The Kami War]]''': The plane of Kamigawa is naturally divided in two: the kakuriyo Kami world (spirit world) and the utsushiyo material world; both working and operating harmoniously until the Kami began to attack the material world twenty years before the story opens. The books follow the lone [[samurai]] Toshiro Umezawa and the princess Michiko as they try to bring peace to Kamigawa. As well as giving the game an unusual, strong Oriental feel, this storyline is interesting in that the designers deliberately tried to give the story a strong influence over the game itself. Instead of relying on the traditional "color wheel" conflict (the game of Magic: the Gathering is based on a five-point circle of allied and enemy color affiliations), the color of any given card may often be less important than whether it has a Kami or Material theme.
*'''[[Ravnica]]''': Ravnica is a plane covered almost entirely in cityscape. The city's ten "guilds", political organizations each based on a different two-color mana pairing, warred for a long period of time. After the conflict, a magical document, the Guildpact, was created to ensure that the plane remained at peace and that the guilds would constrain themselves to their social roles. The main storyline begins 9,999 years later, as anticipation of the decimillennial anniversary builds. The once-noble guilds have corrupted and decayed over time, and a great political gridlock is all that keeps Ravnica stable. A series of protagonists - most notably Agrus Kos, a law enforcement officer from the Boros League, and Teysa Karlov, a lawmage from the Orzhov Syndicate, uncover the plots of the various guildmasters, as well as the ambitions of the "secret guild", House Dimir. The flavor of the cards again exerted considerable influence over the mechanics of the game, encouraging players to build decks devoted to a particular guild.
*'''[[Time Spiral (Magic: The Gathering)|Time Spiral]]''': The Time Spiral block returns to a post-apocalyptic Dominaria. Teferi, a planeswalker, abandoned Urza during the Phyrexian Invasion by "phasing" (temporarily removing from reality) two landmasses known as Shiv and Zhalfir out. He returns to Dominaria to find it in a state of ruin. In addition to having been almost totally devastated by the Apocalypse, mysterious "time rifts" have opened in the skies across the plane, making planeswalking and spellcasting more difficult. Teferi wants to ensure that Zhalfir and Shiv return to Dominaria safely - however, the time rifts, and the considerably deteriorated state of the plane itself, mean that the two continents no longer "fit." Should Zhalfir and Shiv land, Dominaria and the entire Multiverse would be destroyed. The Time Spiral block was billed as Magic's [[nostalgia]] block, and would revisit themes and characters from every storyline up to the end of the Otaria arc. As the Invasion did before, the Time Spiral story is linked to any other story arc before it, harkening back to many earlier settings and characters, even those outside of Dominaria.  It was during this block that The Mending occurred, greatly reducing the powers of all planeswalkers.
*'''[[Lorwyn]]''': Whereas most blocks consist of three sets, it was decided to turn the 2007/08 block into two mini blocks of two sets each. The focus of the first is the plane of Lorwyn, an idyllic, perpetually sunlit world populated by a wide variety of civilized species. These tribes are generally peaceful but keen to keep to themselves. The story centers around an elf outcast named Rhys who has triggered a series of events foreseen by his mentor, Colfenor, and a flamekin pilgrim named Ashling who believes her path and Rhys's are the same. The coming [[Aurora (astronomy)|Aurora]], an annual event when the plane darkens and lights appear in the sky, is the key to whatever it is that Rhys needs to do.
**'''[[Shadowmoor]]''': Rather than passing harmlessly as it normally does, the Aurora instead transforms Lorwyn into an eerie reflection of itself. The idyllic, sunlit world is replaced by the shadows and omnipresent malice of Shadowmoor. Landscapes, races and even individuals become twisted alternatives with no indication that their Lorwyn selves ever existed. Ashling, now known as the Extinguisher, has a central role in this shift, and it falls to Rhys (an elvish hero in this place) and Maralen, a mysterious elf and one of the very few unchanged by the transformation, to discover why.
*'''[[Alara block|Alara]]''': The plane of Alara was shattered long ago by an unknown force; it is now split unequally into five unique shards, each having no knowledge of the others. Each shard was denied two of the five colors of magic by the event (the inhabitants of each shard have had no recollection of the missing two colors of mana for centuries), and have evolved around their remaining three: The militant, feudal, sun-dappled plane of Bant; the scientific, order-obsessed, windy and cloud covered plane of Esper; the desperate, lifeless, blackened plane of Grixis; the violent, harsh, volcanic plane of Jund; and the green, lush, stampeding plane of Naya. Many species die off, evolve, or border extinction in each shard due to insufficient mana sustenance (Zombies can't survive without black mana, angels can't survive without white mana, etc.), and others thrived. The force that shattered the plane is unknown, but believed to be the five-headed hydra Progenitus (for unknown reasons) who disappears at the shattering of the plane and reappears in the expansion "Alara - Conflux" when the shards are reunited.
**'''Conflux''': As the Shards of Alara draw closer together, the millennia-long machinations of a hidden evil come closer to bearing a dire harvest. Nicol Bolas, once one of the most powerful planeswalkers, has been manipulating the civilizations of Alara for his own reasons. As the shards violently collide with each other after centuries apart, war erupts on all sides, and in the chaos, Bolas seeks to harness the power of the Maelstrom, the chaotic center of the plane where all five colors come together in a magical storm of unimaginable energies and power. The planeswalker Elspeth Tirel and the valiant knight Rafiq start to catch wind of an insidious plot and begin investigating.
*'''[[Zendikar]]''': A new plane is introduced: Zendikar, a world with powerful, uncontrollable mana and many dangerous features, including the Roil. Planeswalkers are drawn to Zendikar because of its powerful mana. Many of Zendikar's residents must fight against the land itself as mountains become alive and forests move. It is revealed that thousands of years ago three planeswalkers locked powerful, unstoppable beings known as the Eldrazi in a complex prison on Zendikar, causing the plane's complex problems. When three more planeswalkers enter the prison, the Eldrazi are released and start destroying Zendikar as they cannot escape from the plane.
*'''[[Scars of Mirrodin]]''': As the storyline returns to the metallic plane of Mirrodin, it is found divided.  A corrupted Karn has returned and brought with him the rot of Phyrexia.  As the world faces off, Mirran versus Phyrexian, the idyllic plane is brought to a new form.  This set also marked a deviation from the five color wheel, instead pushing players to align their decks to the Mirran or Phyrexian side of the conflict; to reenforce this, they created a web site devoted to the war where the player can switch between sides. In February 2011, it was announced that Phyrexia had won, and the set New Phyrexia played out as a war amongst five Praetors of Phyrexia, battling each other for dominance.
*'''[[Innistrad]]''': A new plane is introduced: Innistrad, set in a gothic-themed world, where vampires, werewolves, and demons run rampant. Before the events of the block, the human population of Innistrad was constantly beset by supernatural creatures. In response, the planeswalker Sorin created the arch-angel Avacyn to protect the humans. Avacyn set out to eradicate all of Innistrad's demons, leading to an epic battle against the elder demon, Griselbrand. During the battle, Griselbrand was able to trick Avacyn into locking both beings in the magical prison known as the Helvault. With Avacyn gone, the angel's protection disappeared and soon creatures of darkness were free to prey on mankind once more. When Sorin finds out about this he goes straight to Innistrad (presumably from Zendikar) to see what can be done. While he is searching for Avacyn, Liliana Vess is there searching for Griselbrand so she can slay him and release herself from their bargain for Liliana's soul. Liliana discovers the Hellvault and releases Griselbrand and Avacyn. Liliana slays Griselbrand, and Avacyn's restored powers guard humanity from the zombies, werewolves, and dangers of Innistrad.
*'''[[Return to Ravnica]]''': Returning to the megalopolis of Ravnica, the guilds have been in a state of constant warfare ever since the events of Dissension, when the Guildpact was dissolved. The Izzet League's guild leader Niv-Mizzet discovers a maze passing through the Tenth District of the city. He sets his entire guild on figuring out the point of this "Implicit Maze". It is learned later in the story that the being who traverses the maze will become the Ruler of Ravnica. Niv-Mizzet makes an announcement all over the city of Ravnica, asking all guilds to send a champion to run the maze. The planeswalker Jace Beleren solves the mystery of the maze and lauds himself the Living Guildpact, settling disputes for the ten guilds.
*'''[[Theros]]''': On a new plane, Theros, based on the heroes, myths, and monsters of [[Ancient Greece]], Elspeth arrives and is declared the Champion of the sun god, Heliod. The planeswalker Xenagos becomes the God of Revels, angering the established pantheon of the other Gods. Heliod gives Elspeth the Godsend, a sword with which to slay Xenagos. Ajani Goldmane, another planeswalker, helps Elspeth to kill Xenagos. Meanwhile, the planeswalker Kiora is searching the seas of Theros for something that will help to defeat the Eldrazi that will inevitably eventually destroy the Multiverse. The merfolk begin to worship Kiora, mistaking her for Thassa, the God of the Sea. At this point all of the Gods of Theros are very angry at the planeswalkers. After Elspeth kills Xenagos, Heliod takes the Godsend and kills Elspeth with it, sending Elspeth to the underworld of Theros. Ajani is angered and stays on Theros looking for a way to get even with the Gods.
*'''[[Khans of Tarkir]]''': A new plane (Tarkir) is the setting of this block. Tarkir is the homeworld of Sarkhan Vol, a planeswalker known for an obsession with dragons, and the five warring clans, each aligned towards 3 colours. The Mardu (RWB), The Abzan (WBG), The Jeskai (URW), The Sultai (BGU) and the Temur (GUR). All dragons have gone extinct on Tarkir, hunted to extinction by the 5 clans many years ago, but Sarkhan returns to find the source of the voice within his mind. The Planeswalker Sorin also comes to Tarkir where he discovers that Ugin, one of the Planeswalkers that helped to seal the Eldrazi on Zendikar, has died many years ago. Sorin leaves Tarkir saddened by this loss. With the help of the Jeskai leader Narset, Sarkhan makes his way to the resting place of Ugin and travels back in time through the Nexus (the remains of Ugin form this Nexus) but not before he sees Narset killed by Zurgo Helmsmasher, Khan of the Mardu.
**'''[[Fate Reforged]]''': Sarkhan travels through the Nexus 1000 years into the past and discovers the world of Tarkir before the fall of the Dragons. He discovers that the Dragons are formed within great tempests and that these tempests are powered by Ugin himself. He arrives in time to see Ugin confront his nemesis Nicol Bolas, Sarkhan's old master (although at this point in time Nicol Bolas had not met Sarkhan yet). Sarkhan sees Nicol Bolas kill Ugin and leave Tarkir, leaving Sarkhan distraught that he could not save the great Dragon. Using the power of the Hedron he had recovered from Zendikar, Sarkhan encases Ugin within a cocoon of Hedrons and seals him away to save his life. This act changes the future history of Tarkir, as with Ugin still alive the Dragon Tempests would never end, preventing the humans from hunting the Dragons into extinction. Due to his actions changing his own past, Sarkhan is pulled from the past Tarkir and back into the present.
**'''[[Dragons of Tarkir]]''': Sarkhan returns to the present day Tarkir to find the Dragons have survived and now live together with the humans. Although the 5 clans still clash among each other, they are now led by the powerful Dragon Lords instead of the human Khans of Sarkhan's own past. He sees many people he knew from his own timeline, however none of them remember him and all have changed as Sarkhan's actions have influenced this new Tarkir. Sarkhan travels again to the resting place of Ugin and discovers the revived Elder Dragon is gone. He cannot sense Ugin's power in his plane but takes refuge in the fact that Ugin is safe. Sarkhan then goes to find Narset where he discovers his old friend has now left the confines of the Dragons Clans and has learnt the secret history of Tarkir, including the history of Sarkhan himself. We also learn that Narset's spark has ignited and she has become a Planeswalker. We leave the pair on Tarkir, neither of them intending to leave for a long time, with too much to see and learn upon the reinvigorated plane of Tarkir.
*'''[[Battle for Zendikar]]''': The set picks up the storyline of Zendikar where the released Eldrazi devastate the plane. Ulamog, one of the 3 released Eldrazi titans, slowly consumes the land itself. The Zendikari population either flees or unites their strength to fight the Eldrazi together under the leadership of the planeswalker Gideon Jura. Gideon also convinces Jace on Ravnica to help Zendikar. Jace agrees, also since he is partly responsible for releasing the Eldrazi from their prison. He is convinced that the hedrons and leylines of the plane are the key to imprison the Eldrazi once again. The planeswalker Nissa with her unique connection to the plane itself and Kiora, with the weapon she stole from Thassa on Theros join the fight as well. With joint forces the Planeswalker and the Zendikari build a trap of aligned hedrons. For a moment they can imprison Ulamog again, but they were sabotaged by the reignited Demon Planeswalker Ob Nixilis who frees Ulamog, seeking revenge on Nissa and destruction of the plane he despises. He awakens Kozilek as well leaving the Plane with two ravaging Eldazi titans.
*'''[[Shadows over Innistrad]]''': The denizens of Innistrad are beset on all sides.  Their faith in the archangel Avacyn brought them strength when fighting against demons, werewolves, vampires, and all manners of horrors.  But, now the mighty protector of the plane has been twisted into something monstrous by an outside influence.  A very familiar force has stepped into the gothic world, and its corrupting tendrils now touch everything.  The next set, Eldritch Moon, focuses on the fact that Emrakul, the most powerful Eldrazi titan who had been missing from the Battle for Zendikar storyline, is now on Innistrad. Together, the Gatewatch must find a way to save the plane from Emrakul's influence. This story also focuses on cosmic horror instead of the traditional gothic horror of old Innistrad.
*'''[[Kaladesh]]''': The Gatewatch go to Chandra Nalaar's home world, the titular plane of Kaladesh, where she finds her mother (presumed dead) and almost kills Tezzeret. Tezzeret later kidnaps Rashmi, winner of the famous Inventor's Fair, and begins a dastardly plot to control the ruling Consulate. With the Consulate imprisoning inventors and confiscating their devices following the Fair, tensions between the populace and the government reach a boiling point, as depicted in Aether Revolt. The block focuses on a Steampunk aesthetic, with the steam replaced by the powerful material aether.
*'''[[Amonkhet]]''': The Gatewatch set out to destroy the evil dragon planeswalker Nicol Bolas after learning of his dominion over the titular desert plane Amonkhet. In the desert, they find a city (Naktamun) teeming with food, water, and life, ruled by five gods, with Bolas seemingly absent altogether. The people of Naktamun train their entire lives to die in ritual combat, hoping to experience pure bliss in the afterlife when the God-Pharaoh (Bolas) returns to Amonkhet. In Hour of Devastation, Bolas returns as prophesied, only to raze Naktamun and reveal the true purpose of the training and combat: to create an army of physically-perfect and combat-adept mummies to serve as an unquestionably loyal army. The block's setting is based ancient Egypt, with themes of social hierarchy and contrast between life and death.
*'''[[Ixalan]]''': The plane is home to four primary tribes, each with distinct synergies and advantages that draw off of one another.  As for the tale: the golden city of Orazca, bured deep in the jungle, houses a great secret.  The immortal sun, an artifact of immense power, is hidden there.  Now, that secret has become known.  The great forces of the plane gather to combat one another in a contest to see who will claim the mighty prize.  The merfolk River Herals, the vampiric Legion of Dusk, the Brazen Coalition of pirates, and the Sun Empire's dinosaur riders all meet in open conflict to decide the fate of their world.
*'''[[Dominaria]]''': A return to the place of so many of Magic: The Gathering's storylines in celebration of the game's 25th anniversary.

==Additional plots==
There are numerous other smaller plots and subplots that take place in Dominaria and on the many planes of the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|multiverse]] of '''Dominia''' as well as events after the invasion of Dominaria by the Phyrexians.

* The sets from ''Weatherlight'' up to ''Apocalypse'' follow the epic story arc of the crew of the airship ''Weatherlight'', their trek across several planes, and their ultimate role in defending Dominaria from the Phyrexian invasion.
* The sets from ''Odyssey'' to ''Scourge'', set in the era of upheaval after the Invasion, involve the Dominarian continent of Otaria and the struggle between various factions for the powerful artifact known as the Mirari.
* The sets from ''Mirrodin'' to ''Fifth Dawn'' are set in the world of Mirrodin, where artificial and natural life are inseparably entwined.
* Several [[Magic: The Gathering video games]] have their own storylines and worlds.
* Starting with The Mending during ''Time Spiral'', many of the stories revolve around the newly created, de-powered Planeswalkers. These characters recur in multiple sets, and may receive reprints or entirely new cards in new sets.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1420">{{nihongo|'''Nininbaori'''|二人羽織り}} is a [[Culture of Japan|Japanese]] [[comedy|comedic]] act where two people wear the same large [[Coat (clothing)|coat]] ([[Kimono#Accessories and related garments|''haori'']]) and pretend to be one ([[Kyphosis|hunchbacked]]) person.  One person is the "face" and the other is the "arms".  Humor arises from the arms never being coordinated with the face.

This type of [[sketch comedy|skit]] is considered a staple of Japanese comedy, traditional{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} and modern, and is commonly used as a part of comedy shows; both live stage performances and [[Owarai]] (television comedy).

==Use in the media==
* In [[manga]] ''[[I"s]]'', Ichitaka and Iori are made to perform a ''nininbaori'' act.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:WhoseLine03.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Kathy Greenwood]] and [[Ryan Stiles]] act out a scene while [[Colin Mochrie]] provides the Helping Hands.]] --&gt;
* The basic concept of ''nininboari''-type humour is seen in the comedy of many cultures. The [[English language|English]] comedy show ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (disambiguation)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'' has a similar act called "[[List of games from Whose Line Is It Anyway?|Helping Hands]]".

'''Pancrase Inc.''' is a [[mixed martial arts]] promotion company founded in Japan in 1993 by professional wrestlers [[Masakatsu Funaki]] and  [[Minoru Suzuki]].

The name was based on ''[[pankration]]'', a fighting sport in the [[Ancient Olympic Games]]. Suzuki and Funaki practised [[catch wrestling]]. They based the promotion and its rules on [[professional wrestling]]. The promotion's champions were called "King of Pancrase".

The rules allowed closed-fisted punches, except to the head, and [[Strike (attack)#Palm strike|palm strike]]s to the head. A wrestler must break a [[submission hold]] when the opponent reaches the ropes, but a wrestler who claims a rope break loses a point. A wrestler who claims a specified number of rope breaks (between three and five) was disqualified. From 1998 to 2000, the promotion changed its rules to resemble other [[mixed martial arts]] promotions.

Pancrase participant [[Guy Mezger]] said that "there was &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''[[sic]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; not very many works [predetermined outcomes]. Maybe 4 or 5 total and most of them were before I was fighting for them. I hate when people say that there was [''sic''] so many works in Pancrase, they truly do not know what they are talking about".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfuk.tripod.com/interviews_01/mezger_1.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011231041330/http://sfuk.tripod.com/interviews_01/mezger_1.html|archivedate=December 31, 2001|deadurl=yes|title=Guy Mezger Interview|date=July 21, 2001|first=Antony|last=Finnegan|website=SFUK|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2007, ''Pancrase: Legends of Mixed Martial Arts'' aired weekly on [[ImaginAsian TV]]. The network folded in 2011.

In 2008, the [[Fight Network]] began airing Pancrase events in Canada and the U.K.

In 2015, Pancrase signed an exclusive, long-term deal to be streamed live and exclusively on [[UFC Fight Pass]]. Fight Pass also added all of Pancrase's historical fights to its library on a video-on-demand basis. 

==History==

===Establishment and first event===
In 1993, [[Masakatsu Funaki]], [[Minoru Suzuki]], [[Ken Shamrock]], Takaku Fuke, and others from the shoot-style [[Fujiwara Gumi]] wrestling promotion left the company, due to (mentor and promoter) [[Yoshiaki Fujiwara]]'s decision to cooperate with the likes of [[Universal Lucha Libre]] and W*ING and favoring showmanship over in-ring work. As suggested by [[Karl Gotch]], Pancrase was formed by Funaki, Suzuki and Fuke, and the promotion would focus on pure shoot-style [[wrestling]] with limited gimmicks and no predetermined outcomes.

Funaki and Suzuki were students of wrestler [[Antonio Inoki]]. They were inspired by the 1976 [[Muhammad Ali vs. Antonio Inoki]] event that pit a boxer against a wrestler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2016/06/what-role-did-boxer-muhammad-ali-play-in-early-mma-let-ali-vs-inoki-author-josh-gross-explain|title=What role did boxer Muhammad Ali play in early MMA? Let 'Ali vs. Inoki' author Josh Gross explain|work=[[MMAjunkie]]|date=June 13, 2016|accessdate=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2013/5/2/4220042/ufc-mma-history-origins-pride-fc-rickson-gracie-Nobuhiko-Takada|title=MMA Origins: Fighting For Pride|website=BloodyElbow|last=Grant|first=T. P.|date=May 2, 2013|accessdate=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 16, 1993, they established '''World Pancrase Create Inc.''' (WPC) with the capital of 30,000,000 Japanese yen. Masami Ozaki was chosen for its Executive president at that time, and the head office was located in the district of [[Minamiazabu, Minato, Tokyo|Minamiazabu]] in [[Minato, Tokyo|Minato ward]] in [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref&gt;(Japanese)[http://www.pancrase.co.jp/info/office.html  株式会社ワールドパンクラスクリエイト World Pancrase Create　Co., Ltd.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722094327/http://www.pancrase.co.jp/info/office.html |date=2011-07-22 }} pancrase.co.jp Retrieved on 2011-02-20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pancrase.co.jp/en/htm/cominfo.html Company Profile] pancrase.co.jp　Retrieved on 2011-02-20&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 1993, Pancrase promoted their first event at [[Tokyo Bay NK Hall]]. All the matches were finished with knockout and submission.

===Early era===
The first King Of Pancrase Open Weight champion was [[Ken Shamrock]] (later becoming famous for his exploits in the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]]), who had previous experience in the newborn [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Japan)|UWF]] and Fujiwara Gumi. Over the years, Funaki and Suzuki held the title alongside other big names, such as [[Bas Rutten]], [[Frank Shamrock]] and [[Guy Mezger]].

Pancrase now recognizes King of Pancrase titles in the super heavyweight, heavyweight, light heavyweight, middleweight and welterweight divisions, and there are plans to award new lightweight and featherweight champions in the future. The open weight title was recently restored and is currently held by [[Josh Barnett]], who formerly competed in [[Pride Fighting Championships|PRIDE]] and the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]]. Minoru Suzuki no longer competes for Pancrase, as he returned to regular professional wrestling in 2003 as a freelancer, but he primarily competes in [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]].

===Change of management===
In May 2008, "'''Pancrase Inc.'''" was established as a new management company for Pancrase, and WPC alienated Pancrase Inc. their all of business as on May 27, 2008. When Pancrase Inc. was established, Yasushi Sakamoto, a managing director of WPC, was installed as the Executive president.

On October 14, 2008, Pancrase Inc. moved its office to [[Toshima, Tokyo|Nishi Ikebukuro in the ward of Toshima]] in [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boutreview.com/2/news/pancrase/item_1333.html 事務所を南麻布から西池袋に移転 Moving office from Minamiazabu to Nishi Ikebukuro] boutreview.com Retrieved on 2011-02-20&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, Pancrase Inc. moved its office from [[Toshima, Tokyo|Nishi Ikebukuro]] to [[Aobadai, Meguro, Tokyo|Aobadai in ward of Meguro]] in Tokyo, and moved again to [[Koto, Tokyo|Kameido in the ward of Koto]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boutreview.com/2/news/pancrase/item_5256.html パンクラス事務所、中目黒から亀戸に移転　The office of Pancrase moves from Nakameguro to Kameido] boutreview.com Retrieved on 2011-02-20&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 2010, [[Ryo Kawamura]], who was the current [[mixed martial artist]] was installed as the executive president. Yasushi Sakamoto, the former president, had become a managing director.

Kawamura held a press conference in [[Yokohama, Kanagawa]] on October 22, and explained about restructuring and announced that "'''Commission Council'''" had been established as a third party

On June 1, 2012, Pancrase announced that the promotion had been sold to Masakazu Sakai and his [[Smash (professional wrestling)|Smash]] organization, with Sakai taking over as the new president and his partner [[Yuji Shimada]] as the event producer of the promotion. As part of the reconstruction of Pancrase, the new owners intend to replace rings with cages, holding events to test the new format in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://sportsnavi.yahoo.co.jp/fight/headlines/20120601-00000006-spnavi-fight.html | title = パンクラスがSmashに経営権譲渡　「世界標準」へケージ導入も | date=June 1, 2012 | accessdate=June 1, 2012 | work=Sports Navi | publisher=[[Yahoo!]] | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.smashxsmash.jp/news/smash/smash_1.html | title = Smashからのお知らせ | date=June 1, 2012 | accessdate=June 1, 2012 | last=Sakai | first=Masakazu | work=[[Smash (professional wrestling)|Smash]] | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pancrase.co.jp/rls/2012/smash.html | script-title=ja:パンクラスの"世界標準"化計画 | date=June 1, 2012 | accessdate=June 1, 2012 | work=Pancrase | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pancrase 257 on March 30, 2014 was the last event where Pancrase used a ring and by Pancrase 258 on May 11, 2014, Pancrase adopted the Decagon or the ten-sided cage of their American partners [[World Series of Fighting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.clarosports.com/news_stories/pancrase-258-koyama-talked-about-why-he-chose-pancrase-12826628# | title = PANCRASE 258 - Koyama Talked About Why He Chose PANCRASE | date=May 1, 2014 | accessdate=May 1, 2014 | work=Abu Dhabi Combat Club }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fightsportasia.com/2014/03/30/full-results-pancrase-257/ | title = Full Results: PANCRASE 257 | date=March 30, 2014 | accessdate=March 30, 2014 | work=FightSport Asia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pancrase Korea==
Pancrase Korea is the [[South Korea]]n subsidiary of the Pancrase Inc. and held several events from 2007 to 2010. The first Pancrase Korea event was an amateur one held on March 10, 2007 in [[Busan]] and the last one was the semi-professional ''Neo-Blood Tournament 2 &amp; Hybrid Challenge 12'' held on September 12, 2010 in [[Seoul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pancrase.egloos.com/|title=PANCRASE KOREA OFFICIAL BLOG|author=PANCRASE KOREA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cafe.daum.net/pancrasekorea/|title=Daum ī|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==

===Old rules===
Aside from the traditional grappling rules (e.g., no biting, no eye-gouging) the rules were formerly as follows:
* No elbows to the head (neither while standing nor on the ground).
* No closed-fist strikes to the head (neither while standing nor on the ground).
* No knees to the head on the ground.
* No kicks/stomps to the head on the ground.
* If a participant gets too close to the ropes, he is stood back up on the feet. (as opposed to PRIDE's re-centering in the middle of the ring)
* Non-title matches consist of one 15 minute round, while title matches consist of one 30 minute round.
* If a participant is caught in a submission and taps out (whether unable to reach the ropes or not), it is a loss.
* Five "escapes" are given to each fighter at the start of every match. An escape can be used when caught in a submission near the ropes, in which case the participant can grab them, be stood back on the feet and have one point deducted. Once a participant has used all of his escapes, it is a loss.
* For knockouts, a ten-count similar to boxing and kickboxing is used. If the participant is unable to answer the ten-count, it is declared a TKO and that fighter has lost the match. However, if the participant is able to answer the ten-count, the fight resumes and one point is deducted.
* If, at the end of regulated time, neither fighter has submitted, been knocked out, or lost all their points, a decision is rendered based on who lost fewer points. If neither fighter lost any points, or both lost the same number of points, the fight is declared a draw.
* In the 1994 King of Pancrase tournament, the rules were slightly different, in that the first round had one 10-minute round and three rope escapes, and the finals had one 20 minute round with three rope escapes.
* For a short period of time when [[Bas Rutten]] was the King of Pancrase, heelhooks were banned because of the frequency of injuries.
* Strikes on the ground - whether closed fist to the body or open hand to the head - were discouraged by the fans, but still legal.

===Present-day rules===
After the [[1999 in Pancrase#Pancrase: 1999 Anniversary Show|6th Anniversary Show in September of 1999]], Pancrase began to use a ruleset similar to that of [[Pride FC]], but prohibits knees to the head of grounded opponents.

In May 2014, Pancrase adopted the [[Association of Boxing Commissions|Association of Boxing Commissions and Combative Sports]] rules, better known as the [[Mixed martial arts rules|Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]].

'''Phule's Company''' is a series of [[comic science fiction|comic]] [[military science fiction]] novels by [[Robert Asprin]], beginning with ''[[Phule's Company]]'' and ending with ''[[Phule's Errand]]''.

The series takes place centuries in the future, where humans and other species have come together to form the Interplanetary Alliance, a federation government of numerous planets.  The Alliance's military includes not only the [[Space Legion]], but also the Regular Army and Starfleet. The Space Legion is considered the lowest on the totem pole, and the laughingstock of the armed forces. Space Legion protocol has all persons using a pseudonym chosen upon enlistment, and commissions are purchased. It is a violation of Legion rules to release ''another'' Legion member's real name, but not to reveal one's own.&lt;ref name="company"&gt;Robert Asprin, '''Phule's Company''', Ace Books. {{ISBN|0-441-66251-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being court-martialed for inadvertently ordering the strafing of a peace conference, Captain Jester is shipped off to command the Omega Company, a dumping ground for the Legion's foul-ups and misfits. Applying his well honed business sense to the running of the unit, he soon turns it around, winning the almost fanatical loyalty of his troops and turning the "Omega Mob", as it is affectionately nicknamed, into a crack unit. In each book, General Blitzkrieg contrives to send the unit on yet another 'impossible' assignment. They usually manage to come through unscathed.

The names of many in the series are based on puns.

==Main characters==

===Willard Phule===
{{main article|Willard J. Phule}}
Willard J. Phule is the super-rich [[heir apparent]] of Phule-Proof Munitions, currently serving in the [[Space Legion]]. His Legion name is ''Jester,'' and holds the rank of Captain, being addressed thus as ''Captain Jester,'' and occasionally and inappropriately as ''Captain Phule'' or ''Captain Clown.'' Originally having the Legion name was ''Lieutenant Scaramouche'', Phule was brought up on charges and to be court-martialed for ordering the strafing of a peace conference, owing, as he put it, to a “communications error.”

Since Phule-Proof is the Legion's arms and munitions supplier as well as the largest employer of their retirees, Legion Headquarters sees court-martialing the owner’s son as potentially disastrous. He is instead promoted to the rank of Captain and shipped off to Haskin's Planet to command the Omega Company, a dumping ground for the Legion's foul-ups and misfits. It is envisioned that this posting to such an unruly, undesirable outfit might encourage him to resign his commission.

Phule is no fool, and recognizes this promotion's true intent. However, he decides to accept the challenge. Instead of the potentially abysmal assignment it was meant to be he sets out using his business acumen and determination to turn around the unruly “Omega Mob” into a crack military unit, giving the Jester the last laugh.

Phule is a strong-willed individual, with a strong dislike for stereotyping, and not infrequently finds himself in conflict with other authority figures such as his father. Although of a wealthy background, he takes pride that his own fortune is largely self-made: although he started his business empire with a loan from his father, that loan was swiftly repaid. He is also very loyal to his people, going far above what officers would normally do for their soldiers and reacting aggressively to insults towards them. However, Phule can be over-industrious: he has been known to work himself to the point of exhaustion.  He is not above using his enormous wealth to buy his way out of a situation, but typically does so only as a last resort.  He is also not above using his real name and status to bully or cajole others into doing what he wants.  However, regardless of how he wins a personal confrontation, he is always supremely magnanimous in victory and can usually manage to win over the person he's in conflict with.  His not inconsiderable talents include finance, group dynamics, military tactics and strategy, leadership, and public relations.

===Beeker===
Phule's butler, confidante, and the narrator throughout the series.  Though not technically a member of the unit, Beeker is highly respected by most of the company, and often provides its members with sage advice. While he has become quite wealthy in his years of service to Phule, he is still manifestly determined to continue his service to Phule out of companionship and friendship.

===Top Sergeant Brandy===
The Company First Sergeant, Brandy is the stereotypical hard-bitten veteran. In ''Phule's Paradise'', Tusk-anini speculates that she is in love with Captain Jester and unaware of the fact. She is one of three female members of Phule's Company who became [[centerfold]] models without his knowledge. Although a physical description is not given in the stories beyond the fact that she is a very big woman, but not fat, you get the impression that she is Amazonian: very good looking, in early middle age, over 6 feet tall, and thoroughly three-dimensional.  She is also an old hand at brawling.  In one scene she got in a scuffle with Tusk-anini, a {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} alien (see below) and even after he knocked her down with the first punch, she put him in the hospital with a concussion.  All in all, a great lady to have on your side when things get tough.

===Lt Rembrandt===
The senior of Phule's two junior officers, Rembrandt is also an aspiring artist. Beeker notes that before meeting Phule she specialised in landscapes, but after he took over the company she expressed an interest in painting a nude portrait of him.  Rembrant, or "Remmie", initially lacks confidence and is content to let the NCO's run the company.  Phule's major concern with her is teaching her to develop the habit of command, to trust her judgement, and to learn to exercise her authority. When circumstances put her in command of the Omega Mob in ''[[Phule's Paradise]]'', she performs decisively, including standing up to Colonel Battleaxe, Phule's immediate superior, when the situation required her to do so. Although Battleaxe recommended her for a command of her own, like Lt. Armstrong she is content to remain as one of Phule's subordinates.

===Lt Armstrong===
The son of a heroic but dead military officer,  Armstrong is initially an uptight caricature of the career Regular Army officer. A rant he delivers while drunk reveals he resents living in the shadow of his father, whom he feels he can never live up to because of the man's legendary status. Once Phule takes him under his wing, he begins to loosen up and learns to mix his military bearing along with compassion.  At first, Armstrong is jealous of and contemptuous of Lt. Rembrandt, and takes any given opportunity to show her up.  He soon learns to see her strengths, however, and the two form an excellent working relationship, helping each other out whenever they can. Like Lt. Rembrandt, he turned down promotion and a command of his own to stay with Captain Jester and the Omega Company.

===Tusk-anini===
Tusk-anini (or Tusk) is a Volton (sometimes incorrectly referred to as "Voltron"), a race with [[warthog]]-like features. His species is large and imposing, but pacifistic by nature. Captain Jester paired him with Super Gnat, and this pairing, like most of the other Omega Company partnerships, benefited both partners greatly. He doesn't like to fight but will if necessary, especially to protect his partner (often from her own temper). Tusk does not often take the bit in his teeth, but when he does it is best to step out of his way or do what he is asking you to do. He is the Legionnaire most loyal to Phule. He is also quite intelligent, and since he only sleeps a few minutes a day he spends his wealth of free time reading a daunting variety of human books to better learn the language and culture.  He prides himself on not needing a translation device to communicate.  Phule promotes him to corporal and makes him the company clerk. Tusk-anini plans to be a teacher after his enlistment is over.

===Super Gnat===
The shortest Legionnaire in the unit, the diminutive Super-Gnat has the hottest temper. In the first book, she often exploded at the mere use of the word "short", even if it did not concern her. Her partnership with Tusk-anini calms her, and while she still has a fiery temper, she learned to control it once she found that Tusk-anini was fighting people who made fun of her, to keep her from getting hurt trying to fight them. It is revealed that she was married to a martial arts instructor, and is a black belt in multiple disciplines.  However, when she loses her temper she usually is unable to call upon these skills, and loses most of her impulsive fights. Super-Gnat has taken fencing lessons from Phule and is one of the three female members of Phule's Company who became centerfold models without his knowledge.

===Sushi===
The product of a wealthy family, Sushi was acquainted with Phule socially before they separately joined the Space Legion. In Sushi's case this decision was made after he lost a fortune he had embezzled to gambling debts. Sushi eventually initiates a one-man takeover of the [[Yakuza]], the Japanese mafia.

===Do-Wop===
Do-Wop is something of a [[kleptomania]]c, and Phule's reason for pairing him with Sushi was similar to the reasons he paired up other members of the unit: to balance each other.  In this case, he hoped that Do-Wop would teach Sushi to learn to have fun and relax; and that Sushi could teach Do-Wop to aim a little higher than petty thievery. Unfortunately, their pairing succeeded entirely too well. Now, instead of a petty-grade kleptomaniac and a cold, calculating risktaker that usually held back, Do-Wop and Sushi are Omega Company's greatest masters of larceny. As they also are good planners, they are a force to be reckoned with when the Captain turns them loose on a problem.

===Rose/Mother===
A female Legionnaire, the only original member of Omega Company without a partner. She is terrified of other people and is only capable of mumbling incoherently when addressed directly, except when the speaker is a woman. She is highly skilled as the Company's communications coordinator; in ''[[Phule's Paradise]]'' Tully Bascomb, a legendary casino security chief, suggests she look him up if she ever decides to leave the Legion, to teach "eye in the sky" security monitoring. The lack of face to face contact is the defining factor of Mother's shyness; when not dealing with people in person, she can be something of a smart-ass until the chips are down. She is one of the three female members of Phule's Company who became [[centerfold]] models without his knowledge — to his surprise, it was her idea.

===Escrima===
Named after the Filipino form of martial arts, Sergeant Escrima is the company's mess sergeant. Hot-tempered, he is a talented chef; he dislikes insults towards his own food or food in general. He is a master in all forms of Philippine martial arts: hand-to-hand combat, knife fighting and especially [[Eskrima|arnis]], Philippine stick fighting. He represented the Omega Mob in a competition against an elite Regular Army unit with the Olympic light saber in [[Phule's Company]] and almost defeated him, despite never having fenced before.

===Chocolate Harry===
Also known as C.H. The company supply sergeant, Harry has a talent for black-marketeering. He is a former member of the Outlaws,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Asprin|first=Robert L.|title=A Phule and his money|year=1999|publisher=Ace Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=0441006582|page=57|author2=Peter J. Heck}}&lt;/ref&gt; a criminal hover-bike club and still maintains his personal bike. One of his trademarks is wearing sleeveless uniforms. He is partners with Louis, one of the Legion's two Sinthians, who rides in a side-car on Harry's bike, wielding a shotgun.  Initially, C.H. doesn't think much of Phule and plans to take advantage of him, but soon learns that Phule is far too intelligent for this and can in fact teach him to play in the big leagues if he toes the line and operates within the parameters Phule gives him.

===General Blitzkrieg===
A senior officer and one of the three Directors of the Space Legion, Blitzkrieg has a personal dislike of Phule and would very much like to force him out of the Legion, after which he intends to retire from the Space Legion and sell his memoirs. His preferred method is to assign the toughest of assignments to the Omega Company ... a strategy that has thus far failed to do anything more than cement the reputation of Phule's Company as an elite body of troops. He also has been known to attempt to throw a monkey wrench into the smooth operation of the Omega Mob by complying with the letter of the regulations. One example of this is Blitzkrieg's responding to Phule's request that a chaplain be assigned to his company by sending him a chaplain from The Church of The King — whose saviour is a Twentieth Century musician.

===Colonel Battleaxe===
The officer who originally assigned Phule to the Omega Company and his immediate superior, Battleaxe fully expected that the tough duty would lead to his resignation. She was surprised but pleased when he instead turned them around and has since become his staunchest defender in the Space Legion, to the point of breaking off her first vacation in years to cross the galaxy and assist him against one of Blitzkrieg's schemes. She is aware that, should Phule be drummed out of the Legion, that the resultibg backlash from Phule-Proof Munitions (to which Phule is heir) would be disastrous to the Space Legion. She has recommended both Rembrandt and Armstrong for commands of their own.

===Flight Leftenant Qual===
The company's Zenobian contact. Though not a member of the unit, he is nevertheless indebted to Phule, whom he met during the first book, with pulling him out of disrepute due to his mistaking a ceremonial vase for a waste receptacle at a prominent reception. This incident led to his placement on an exploration team which crash landed upon the swamp planet, Haskins, whereupon their outfit was discovered and fired upon by Do-Wop of the Omega Company out of ignorance. His species resemble miniature [[allosaur]]s. Due to a malfunction of his [[universal translator]], Qual habitually refers to Willard Phule, aka Captain Jester, as "Captain Clown."

===Rev===
When Captain Jester requested a chaplain for the Omega Company, General Blitzkrieg sent him the Reverend Jordan Ayres,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Asprin|first=Robert L.|title=A Phule and his money|year=1999|publisher=Ace Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=0441006582|pages=10–11|author2=Peter J. Heck}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Church of [[Elvis Presley|The King]]. He is somewhat pudgy with black, slicked back hair and an all too easily recognized face.

The '''Portuguese Association of Theatre Critics''' or '''Associação Portuguesa de Críticos de Teatro''' ('''APCT''') is the leading theatrical critic association in [[Portugal]]. Although it dates back to before the 25th of April 1974, it was formally established on 28 November 1984. Its head office is located at 31 Avenida Duque de Loulé, in [[Lisbon]].

The association was founded by [[Luiz Francisco Rebello]], [[Carlos Porto]], Fernando Midões, [[Jorge Listopad]], Manuela de Azevedo, [[Maria Helena Serôdio]], José Valentim Lemos, Maria Helena Dá Mesquita, Mário Sério, Orlando Neves, [[Tito Lívio]] and José Manuel da Nóbrega.

The formal entry of the Portuguese Association of Theatre Critics internationally occurred in 1987 in [[East Berlin]], at the Tenth Congress of the [[International Association of Theatre Critics]], and was then represented by the Association members Maria Helena and Eugenia Serôdio Vasques.

The Portuguese Association of Theater Critics has developed its activities in various ways, actively intervening in the allocation of annual premiums, and the organization of (and participation in) meetings, seminars and conferences, both nationally and internationally. 

Since 1990, and in various forms, the Portuguese Association of Theater Critics been actively participating in many of the initiatives of the International Association; it was represented in the Executive Committee from 1990 to 1992, when Helena Serôdio was elected as Secretary General, having been successively re-elected in 1994 and 1996. In 1998 she was elected Honorary Secretary General and later passed to direct the International Seminars for young critics. Many young critics and scholars of Portuguese theatre participated in some of these seminars, in several countries.

The most recent Congress of the International Association of Theater Critics, iwas held in October 2003 in [[Bucharest]], when the Portuguese came to join the Executive Committee, represented by Paulo Eduardo Carvalho.

Prostitution has been blamed for a rise in [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= KYRGYZSTAN: Rise in prostitution threatens to fuel jump in HIV/AIDS|work= [[IRIN]]|date=|url= http://irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=33681|accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; the HIV prevalence amongst sex workers is 2%.&lt;ref name="unaids" /&gt;

[[Sex trafficking]] is a problem in the country.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

==Law enforcement==
[[NGO]]s and sex workers report harassment and corruption by law enforcement and forced health checks.&lt;ref name="24kg"&gt;{{cite web|title=Forced Health Checks for Sex Workers in Kyrgyzstan|url=https://24.kg/archive/en/bigtiraj/169074-news24.html/|website=24.kg|accessdate=23 January 2018|language=ru-ru|date=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the setting up of the Police's "Department for Combating Human Trafficking and Crimes Against Public Morality" in 2013, the situation has deteriorated.&lt;ref name="24kg" /&gt; In the capital, [[Bishkek]], the former [[red-light district]] of Pravda Street is now devoid of prostitutes. A few "mamochki" (madams) are on the street, the sex workers being in nearby hotels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lochner|first1=Adriane|title=Kyrgyzstan: Vice Squad Driving Sex Work Underground|url=https://eurasianet.org/s/kyrgyzstan-vice-squad-driving-sex-work-underground|website=Eurasianet|accessdate=23 January 2018|language=en|date=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kyrgyz police officers allegedly exploit female trafficking victims, including some younger than age 18, for sex both in saunas and on the street. Concerns persist about police misconduct and corruption, including allegations that police threaten and extort sex trafficking victims, including minors, and reports that police accept bribes from alleged traffickers to drop cases.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

==Tais Plus==
NGO Таис Плюс (Tais Plus) is an organisation that advocate sex workers rights and provides support and education to sex workers.&lt;ref name="swan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tais Plus, Kyrgyzstan|url=http://swannet.org/node/19|website=Sex Workers' Rights Advocacy Network (SWAN)|accessdate=23 January 2018|language=en|date=12 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nswp"&gt;{{cite web|title=Таис Плюс / Tais Plus|url=http://www.nswp.org/es/members/tais-plus|website=Global Network of Sex Work Projects|accessdate=23 January 2018|language=es|date=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation was started in 1997 by a group of sex workers as a "trade union". In 2000 it was registered as an NGO and received the status of a public organisation.&lt;ref name="swan" /&gt;

Tais Plus were successful in opposing an amendment to the law in 2005 that criminalised sex work, and again in 2012 against a proposed amendment to make prostitution an administrative offence.&lt;ref name="icrse"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nothing about us without us|url=https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/xmlui/bitstream/handle/item/30042/dziuban_stevenson_nothing_about_us_without_us.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|website=ICRSE|accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been estimated that about 90% of street sex workers in [[Kyrgyzstan]] have reached by the organisation's outreach project.&lt;ref name="swan" /&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Kyrgyzstan}}
Kyrgyzstan  is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking abroad, reportedly in [[Turkey]], the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE), [[India]], [[Russia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[South Korea]], and within the country. Underage teenage girls from [[Uzbekistan]] increasingly are subjected to sex trafficking in the southern region of the Kyrgyzstan. Some men and women from Uzbekistan, [[Tajikistan]], and [[Turkmenistan]] transit the country as they migrate to Russia, the UAE, and Turkey, where they may be subjected to sex trafficking.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kyrgyz Republic 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271222.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=23 January 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 124 of the criminal code, entitled “Trafficking in Persons,” criminalises both sex and labour trafficking of adults and children. The article  requires the prosecutor to prove the offender used force, blackmail, fraud, deception, or abduction for cases of sex trafficking regardless of whether the victim is a child or adult. The government initiated five sex trafficking investigations under article 124 in 2016.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Kyrgyzstan as a 'Tier 2' country.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

'''RTL Klub''' is a television station (M-RTL Zrt.) owned by [[RTL Group]] and broadcast in [[Hungary]]. It was one of Hungary's first commercial TV channels and was only three days after the main rival [[TV2 (Hungary)|TV2]] to begin broadcasting.

==About RTL Klub==
Since its start, RTL Klub has focused to gain viewers from the urban population. The channel airs programs mostly for a younger (18–49) audience.

RTL and TV2 aired two similar major reality series simultaneously. While TV2 purchased the rights of ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'', RTL Klub produced its own series called ''Való Világ'' (Real World).
''Való Világ'' had three seasons between 2002 and 2004. Since its second season the show has been much more successful than the rival ''Big Brother''.

RTL is the most watched TV channel in Hungary since 2002, thanks to the daily Hungarian soap opera ''Barátok közt'' (Among Friends), which is the most watched TV programme in Hungary with more than 2 million viewers; the tabloid magazine ''Fókusz'' (Focus) and the game show ''Legyen Ön is milliomos'' (''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]''). Millionaire is off the schedule from September 2007 after seven years and has replaced by ''A Széf'' (''[[Take It Or Leave It (game show)|Take It Or Leave It]]'').

From the fall-winter season of 2005–2006, RTL Klub has started to broadcast popular American TV shows like ''Lost''. The first episode of ''Lost'' had almost 2 million viewers, and a 50% share. This was a record. The next year Prison Break started with almost 1.6 million. Nowadays a TV show at prime time (21:00) can reach 1–1.5 million viewers. In season 2006–2007 ''Prison Break'' was the most watched American series in Hungary.

From the fall season of 2007, RTL Klub has launched two new formats with great success. Poker Face ran like a tournament for six weeks with an average 38–42% share. The other new show was ''[[America's Got Talent|Csillag születik]]'', the Hungarian version of the RTL ''Got Talent'' format. ''Poker Face'' ended with the super final at 18 December and the time slot of it will be occupied by the new game show ''A Széf'' (''[[Take It Or Leave It (game show)|Take It or Leave it]]'').

RTL Klub was the only licensed broadcaster of [[Formula One]] in Hungary from 2002 until 2011. After 10 years RTL decided not to renew the licence for Formula 1. The reason was that they wanted to concentrate mainly for the prime time programs because of the shrinking advertising market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tv24.blog.hu/2011/10/24/a_forma_1_rol_is_lemond_az_rtl "A Forma-1-ről is lemond az RTL" (RTL gives up Formula 1 rights)] October 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The RTL Klub has been the only licensed broadcaster of [[Domino Day]] in Hungary, for 6 years (2004–2009).

From 2010, RTL Klub started with 2 winning formats. First of all the channel after 6 years absence successfully relaunched the [[Való Világ]] franchise. VV4 ran with a 40% SHR among 18-49 demographic.&lt;ref&gt;Est.hu [http://est.hu/cikk/86765 "Való Világ 4: Töretlen siker" (VV4: Great success)] January 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly they purchased the rights of television talent show [[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]]. The show ran with a 50% SHR&lt;ref&gt;Est.hu [http://www.pestiest.hu/cikk/82831/az_x-faktor_megeszi_a_megasztart_reggelire] "Az X-Faktor megeszi a Megasztárt reggelire" (The X Factor eats Megasztár for breakfast)] September 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; among 18-49 demographic which is really high on the Hungarian television market. The Factor crashed the competitor talent show on TV2 so "Megasztár" left the time slot of ''The X Factor'' after a few episodes. 
Because of the success of both format, RTL Klub renewed both show for the 5th and 2nd season respectively. They started in the fall season of 2011.

==Other formats==

* '''[[Barátok közt]]''' (Among Friends): the most watched domestically produced television soap of Hungary. The show started in the fall of 1998, one year after the foundation of RTL Klub. The show remarkably resembles BBC soap-drama, [[EastEnders]]. Initially, it didn't have the expected ratings, however, bound by the contract, RTL Klub had to keep the show running. Since 2000, the third season, the show has been rarely beaten in ratings in its own timeslot. Today, the average rating of the show is about 2 million viewers, and it's a solid foundation of viewers the channel occasionally builds on. Each episode of the series is 10 minutes long, and every weekday two episodes are aired. In between the two episodes, there is a news session as well as the highest value commercial block in Hungarian television.
* '''[[X-Faktor]]''': the licensed version of the talent show [[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]]. The first season started in the fall season of 2010. Because of the great success the 2nd season started one year later. Season 3 started in fall 2012. Season 4 started 1 year later with 3 new judges and 2 new hosts.
* '''[[Való Világ]]''' (Real World): the show is similar to the reality show ''Big Brother'' although there are some major differences between the two formats. VV first started on RTL Klub in 2002. At the same time the rival TV channel (TV2) purchased the rights of the successful Big Brother format. The 1st seasons of the 2 shows had similar ratings but BB was slightly ahead. Since the 2nd season VV crashed the rival format so BB moved to the late night time slot and died quietly. The 2nd season of VV was followed with a 3rd one which had great ratings again. (There was no BB3.) After the 3rd season of VV ended RTL Klub had the format rested for 6 years. In 2010 they relaunched the format with some changes. VV4 was followed by VV5 in 2011. VV6 started in Winter 2014 on RTL II and the channel continues it with a 7th season in Autumn. RTL Klub sold the format of VV to Czech Republic and Slovakia where the show was called Vyvolení. The Czech VV had 3 seasons while the Slovak had 2. In both countries VyVolení (the chosen one) won the time slot against ''Big Brother''.

==Previous formats==
* '''Heti Hetes''' ("The Weekly Seven"): a show where seven known Hungarian comedians (one host and 6 guests) talk about current news, politics and public life. The show was on air from the early years of RTL Klub and the 500th episode was the last to air there. The show moved in 2012's fall to the sister channel [[RTL II (Hungary)|RTL II]].
* '''Legyen Ön is Milliomos''': The licensed version of ''[[Who Wants to be a Millionaire]]''. The series lasted nine seasons, hosted by Hungary's esteemed quiz host, [[:hu:Vágó István|István Vágó]], but it was not going to be renewed after the licensor changed to RTL's major game show format. In September 2009, the show switched to a new format; the host was changed to [[:hu:Fábry Sándor|Sándor Fábry]],a well-known comedian in Hungary, and the players are always a pair of celebrities. It aired once a month but this format was not successful so the show was cancelled again. In March 2012 the show was rebooted again and returned with a new host, [[:hu:Friderikusz Sándor|Sándor Friderikusz]]. It was aired once per week. The show moved in 2012's fall to the sister channel [[RTL II (Hungary)|RTL II]] before being cancelled again in 2013.
* '''Gálvölgyi Show''': a parody show hosted by János Gálvölgyi, featuring short sketches which are parodies of TV shows, Hungarian and international celebrities, and commercials. The show also has several regular sketches, such as a conversation between two working-out rich men, which led to the birth of a decade-old Hungarian catchphrase "Gyúrunk vazze'" ("We're working out, damn it").
* '''Kész Átverés''' (Total Scam): a show similar to the MTV's [[Punk'd]] where the host does pranks on Hungarian and currently visiting celebrities.
* '''Esti Showder''': a very popular talk show being broadcast every second week (except summer) at Thursdays 21:00. It loosely follows the format of NBC's [[The Tonight Show]]. The show features an opening session with the host cracking somewhat actualized jokes and rapidfire humorous monologues, followed by a regular session of ''Design Center'', in which the host ironically presents absurd or downright ridiculous products created and sent to the show by viewers. After the design center, the show features a studio music session which presents successful or potentially successful Hungarian bands, and finally the show presents a talk session where Fábry sits down and talks to different Hungarian celebrities. After 11 years the show hasn't returned at the fall season of 2011. Fábry moved the show to [[Magyar Televízió|m1]].
* '''Celeb vagyok...Ments ki innen!''': the licensed version of British TV show [[I'm a Celebrity... Get Me out of Here!]] The 1st season premiered at the fall 2008.

* '''Balázs Show''': a daily tabloid talk show, which aired every weekday at 16:30. The show followed a slightly more lightened up format than its counterpart, Mónika show. It ended in 2007 after years of success, cited reason being that the host became popular and wanted more serious challenges.
* '''Mónika Show''': a daily tabloid talk show usually featured and tried to resolve family issues. The former Hungarian local authority ''[[:hu:ORTT|National Radio and Television Syndicate]]'' had often punished the channel belong to highly violent behaviour and bad language used by the guests the show. On 8 August 2012, RTL Klub got a '''12-hours break penalty''' for the show.
* '''Szombat Esti Láz''' (Saturday Night Fever): The show is based on the BBC One programme [[Strictly Come Dancing]]. In it famous Hungarian people dance with professional dancers. This show is also very popular. The 2nd season finale had more viewers than the FIFA Football World Cup Final in Hungary. (Italy vs. France), it should however be noted that Hungary were not in the competition hence weakening interest. It had 3 seasons. 2 in 2006 (spring and fall) and 1 in 2008 (fall). The show returned in 2013 spring on [[RTL II (Hungary)|RTL II]].
* '''Győzike''': a documentary-soap about a Hungarian [[Romani people|gypsy]] family. The head of the family called [[Győző Gáspár]], husband and father of two girls, who is a pop/rap singer and he had a band but after the show started in 2005 the band broke up. It used to be a very popular show, bearing similarities to [[MTV]]'s ''[[the Osbournes]]''. It had 7 seasons but the return of the show is unlikely.
* '''Pókerarc''': The Hungarian adaption of the RTL format [[PokerFace (game show)|PokerFace]]. It debuted at November 2007 and broadcast every day at 19.00.

The 2nd season started in fall 2008.
* '''A Kísértés''' (The Temptation): the licensed version of ''[[Temptation Island (TV series)|Temptation Island]]''. The show had one season on RTL Klub in 2004 and had moderate ratings and so it wasn't renewed for a second season.
* '''A Rettegés Foka''' (Fear Factor): It is a licensed version of the American ''[[Fear Factor]]''. It was cancelled after 2 seasons, reruns however are still aired on Cool TV.
* '''Survivor – A sziget''' (Survivor - The Island): the licensed version of the famous hit reality show ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]'', whose international format rights are held by RTL. RTL Klub aired two seasons. The major difference between the Hungarian Survivor and the original one was the winner was selected by a public vote (via SMS or phone calls).
* '''Szeszélyes''' (Capricious): a show similar to long-running ''Szeszélyes Évszakok'' (Capricious Seasons). After the cancellation of the original show, RTL Klub launched its own version with the host [[Imre Antal]], which ran until Antal's death of [[cancer]] in 2008. The channel didn't renew the license for the show because it had considerably lower ratings than the original.
* '''Csíííz!''': the licensed Hungarian version of ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]''.

==Sister TV channels==
RTL Klub has many sister channels. One of the owners of RTL Klub is "IKO Kábeltévé Kft.", which also owns [[Cool TV]], Film+, SportKlub, SportKlub+ (which is a non-airing channel since 2009), DoQ, F&amp;H, Sorozat+, Poén! (which became Prizma in December 2010), Reflektor and Film+2, all of which are in some way related to the IKO's primary channel, RTL Klub.
In 2011, RTL Group acquired seven TV channels from the IKO Kábeltévé (Cool TV, Film+, Film+2, Prizma TV, Sorozat+, Reflektor TV, Muzsika TV).
[[Thematic Cable]] bought SportKlub, DoQ and F&amp;H in 2013 from the RTL Group.
Prizma TV reruns since May 2014 called [[:hu:RTL+|RTL+]].

===Cool TV===
Originally [[Cool TV]] had the target audience of 15–29 urban youths who love music, externals, clothes, trendy lifestyle and extravagance. The channel was launched in 2003 and it is available in 2.5 million households.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://r-time.hu/csatornaink/cool |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101211839/http://r-time.hu/csatornaink/cool |archivedate=2012-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The channel is on a [[24/7]] broadcast schedule, targeting audience not only during the day, but during the night as well. Cool TV airs reruns of series RTL Klub originally purchased or produced as well as series targeting today's youth. These include: ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Married... with Children]]'' (''Egy rém rendes család''), ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', ''[[Footballer's Wives]]'' (''Futbalista feleségek''), ''[[The L Word]]'' (''L''), ''[[Queer as Folk (US TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'' (''A fiúk a klubból''), ''[[The Unit]]'' (''Az egység''), ''[[Dead Like Me]]'' (''Haláli hullák''), ''[[Weeds (TV series)|Weeds]]'' (''Spangli''), ''[[Skins (TV series)|Skins]]'' (''Skins''), ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' (''Született feleségek'')

In 2007, Cool TV launched a series of topical shows produced by the channel, such as ''Cool Live and Cool Night'', featuring younger hosts lent to Cool by RTL Klub. The earlier is a youth lifestyle show, and the latter is an adult show including interviews with Hungarian porn stars and producers, as well as occasionally shown soft-core video clips. {{As of|2013|9|29}}, these talk shows are cancelled.

In 2009, Cool TV purchased the airing rights of the successful Hungarian version of ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (UK TV series)|Whose line is it anyway?]]'', [[Beugró]].

From August 30, 2010, Cool TV changed image and was rebranded, opening for a wider audience. Since then the channel airs mostly crime procedurals like the [[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI franchise]], ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'', ''[[Castle (TV series)|Castle]]'', [[Alarm für Cobra 11 – Die Autobahnpolizei|Cobra 11]], [[The Mentalist]], etc. The move was successful because as of July 2012, Cool TV is the third watched commercial TV channel, and most watched cable channel in Hungary (target audience 18-49, prime time 19.00-23.00), beating main competitor [[Viasat 3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://r-time.hu/csatornaink/cool/ajanlok/cool-a-3-csatorna |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605115841/http://r-time.hu/csatornaink/cool/ajanlok/cool-a-3-csatorna |archivedate=2013-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film+===
[[Film+]] was launched on 15 September 2003, the same time as Cool TV. The channel airs movies which previously aired on RTL Klub [[24/7]]. According to 2012 Hungarian television ratings, Film+ is the third-most-watched cable channel in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;http://sorozatwiki.hu/news.php?readmore=75381&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the early success of the channel, the parent company launched Film+2, which airs movies in the same fashion as Film+.

===Film+2===
Film+2 is a non-violent family channel. This movie channel is devoted partly to female audiences, and partly to family films during the evenings and weekends. It offers comedies, romantic films, adventures and dramas. In the RTL cable portfolio, Film Plusz 2 is the channel that broadcasts most Hungarian films.

===Sport Klub===
The [[Sport Klub]] channel was launched before 2 January 2006. RTL Klub purchased the broadcasting rights of the [[FIFA]] World Cup 2006 but it didn't have enough airing time for all of the matches, and therefore Sport Klub was launched by the parent company to fill in. Now Sport Klub airs various sport activities, such as the French and Italian football league (as partner of [[Digi Sport (Hungary)|Digi Sport]]), tennis, poker, [[NCAA]], athletics, [[futsal]] and box. űThe channel reran the Formula-1 broadcast of the parent channel to 2011. It aired certain matches of the English and the Spanish league, however its main competitors, the sports channels run by the Hungarian public service television [[Magyar Televízió|MTV]], Sport1 and Sport2, have the first pick of the matches they would like to air. To ease up the load on Sport Klub, the parent company also launched the channel SportKlub+, which aired sports events deemed to attract less viewers than the parent channel.

Sport Klub is also available in countries close to Hungary in which countries IKO also operates, including [[Romania]], [[Poland]], [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]].

===[[RTL II (Hungary)|RTL II]]===
In September, 2011 RTL Klub started a project named ''RTL2'' to launch a new RTL channel in [[Hungary]]. In April, 2012 it was announced, that RTL will launch [[RTL II (Hungary)|RTL II]] in September or in October with ''I Love Gjoni'' (reality show); ''Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?'' (Hungarian version) and ''Heti Hetes'' (weekly comedy show on Sunday nights).

In July 2012, something started to promoted on ''RTL Klub'' with these sentences: ''The Life is Nice'' ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''Az élet szép.''), ''The Sky is Blue'' (''Az ég kék.''), ''The Grass is Green'' (''A fű zöld.''), but it wasn't mentioned that these ads are advertising something. In September 2012, it was revealed that these ads advertised ''RTL2'', the new commercial television channel what will launch on October 1, 2012 and it will replace Reflektor TV. In September, it suddenly became an [[Internet meme]] but bloggers and net users were disappointed when they got know the promotion is about ''"just"'' a new TV channel.

At the launch the prime-time schedule of [[RTL II (Hungary)|RTL II]] included series: ''[[Modern Family]]'', ''[[White Collar (TV series)|White Collar]]'', ''[[Terra Nova (TV series)|Terra Nova]]'', ''[[Journeyman (TV series)|Journeyman]]'', ''[[The Forgotten (TV series)|The Forgotten]]'', ''[[Chase (2010 TV series)|Chase]]'', shows moved from RTL Klub: ''[[Who Wants to be a Millionaire]]'' and ''Heti Hetes'' and a new magazine ''Forró nyomon''.

===RTL+===
Prizma TV’s focus is on entertainment and its purpose is to provide something attractive for each generation. Most of its programming consists of beloved familiars, but there are some new audience favourites, too. It airs as [[:hu:RTL+|RTL+]] since May 2014.

===Sorozat+===
Sorozat+ is the channel for fans of series - for those who live in anticipation of the next episode. Sorozat+ offers something for each member of the family, from Latin-American telenovelas to top US series.

===Muzsika TV===
Muzsika TV is a music channel that offers a mix of traditional and modern pieces, featuring the greatest stars of folk and pop music as well as operettas and musicals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12190">The '''Records of Early English Drama (REED)''' is a performance history research project, based at the [[University of Toronto]], Ontario, Canada. It was founded in 1976 by a group of international scholars interested in understanding “the native tradition of English playmaking that apparently flourished in late medieval provincial towns”&lt;ref&gt;Johnston 2006, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; and formed the context for the development of the [[English Renaissance theatre]], including the work of [[Shakespeare]] and his contemporaries.  REED’s primary focus is to locate, transcribe, edit, and publish historical documents from England, Wales, and Scotland containing evidence of drama, secular music, and other communal entertainment and mimetic ceremony from the late [[Middle Ages]] until 1642, when the [[Puritans]] closed the London public theatres. 

From its inception in 1976 to 2016, REED published twenty-seven print collections of records edited by over thirty international scholars.

==History==

During a 1970-71 research trip in [[York]], England, to study manuscripts related to the York cycle of biblical plays (also known as the [[York Mystery Plays]]), Alexandra F. Johnston, an early drama scholar from the University of Toronto, came across a manuscript transcription of a 1433 indenture agreement between the leaders of the medieval Mercers' Guild and their pageant masters. The document contained details of a medieval pageant wagon and sophisticated staging unknown to researchers of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston 2006, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Johnston also met Margaret Dorrell, an Australian graduate student at the [[University of Leeds]], who was working on a similar project related to the York records; the two women decided to collaborate.

Within the next two years, Johnston and Dorrell met other scholars of medieval and Renaissance drama working independently on manuscripts from other English cities (David Galloway of the [[University of New Brunswick]] on [[Norwich]], Reginald Ingram of the [[University of British Columbia]] on [[Coventry]], and Lawrence Clopper of [[Indiana University Bloomington]] on [[Chester]]).&lt;ref&gt;Johnston 2006, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of a scholarly publishing project to find, transcribe, and edit documentary evidence of performance arose from these meetings and was met with interest by the individual researchers and their academic communities. 

In January 1974, Johnston circulated a position paper on the project. Discussions and planning followed and, in February 1975, the inaugural REED meeting was held at [[Victoria University, Toronto|Victoria University]] in the University of Toronto. In 1975-76, Johnston received a Canada Council personal grant for the publication of the York records as a pilot project, and in late 1976, REED was officially launched with a [[Canada Council]] ten-year Major Editorial Grant for the proposed series of collections, establishing REED as a long-term research and publishing project.  Because three of the four initial collections were edited by Canadian researchers, Toronto, Canada, became the home of the project.  

In 1979, REED published its first two collections of records: York, edited by Alexandra F. Johnston and Margaret Rogerson (née Dorrell), and Chester, edited by Lawrence D. Clopper.  Since then the project has expanded its scope from major cities and towns to all the counties of England, Wales, and Scotland, based on historic pre-1642 county borders.

After its inception in 1976, REED produced the bi-annual ''REED Newsletter'' which, in 1997, became the refereed scholarly journal ''[[Early Theatre]]''. 

REED has had close ties to the English Department,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.utoronto.ca/ Department of English, University of Toronto] - Official website.&lt;/ref&gt; the Centre for Medieval Studies&lt;ref&gt;[http://medieval.utoronto.ca/ Centre for Medieval Studies] - Official website.&lt;/ref&gt; (CMS), the Centre for Reformation and Renaissance Studies&lt;ref&gt;[https://crrs.ca/ Centre for Reformation and Renaissance Studies] - Official website.&lt;/ref&gt; (CRRS), and the Graduate Centre for Study of Drama.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dramacentre.utoronto.ca/ Graduate Centre for Study of Drama] - Official website.&lt;/ref&gt;   From 1976 to 2009 the project was based at Victoria University in the University of Toronto.  In 2009 the offices of the project moved to the English Department.  REED retains active relationships with the English Department, the CMS, and the [[University of Toronto Libraries]]. REED’s internal governance is provided by an Executive Board of senior scholars in early drama and related fields, with digital advisors and collections editors drawn from Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. 

REED has collaborated with the [[Poculi Ludique Societas]] (PLS) to mount four productions of full cycles of medieval biblical dramas: the ''York Plays''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beadle |first=Richard |title=The York Plays: A Critical Edition of the York Corpus Christi Play as recorded in British Library Additional ms 35290. |year=2009 |volume=2 vols. |place=Oxford |publisher=Oxford UP for the Early English Text Society |isbn=0-1995-9036-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also called the [[York Mystery Plays]]) in 1977 and 1998, and the ''Chester Plays'' (also called the [[Chester Mystery Plays]]) in 1983 and 2010,&lt;ref&gt;[http://groups.chass.utoronto.ca/plspls/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/index.html The Chester Plays] - an acting text adapted by Alexandra F. Johnston for the 2010 performances.&lt;/ref&gt; with participation from international amateur theatre groups.

In November 2002, REED, in partnership with the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]], hosted the Picturing Shakespeare symposium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nolan |first=Stephanie |date=22 December 2001 |title=Experts to Debate Sanders Painting |work=Globe and Mail |page=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nolan |first=Stephanie |title=Face-off over a Portrait |work=Globe and Mail |date=20 November 2002 |page=R5}}&lt;/ref&gt; an exhibition of and an accompanying public symposium regarding the [[Sanders portrait]], an Elizabethan painting reputed to be the only one of Shakespeare made during his lifetime.

In addition to revealing evidence of vernacular entertainment activities, the research work for the collections produces a body of knowledge regarding professional travelling entertainers, their patronage, and their performance venues.  This cumulative information was first launched for public use through the Patrons and Performances&lt;ref name="PandP" /&gt; website in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, Audrey and Sally-Beth MacLean, “Introduction,” p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2011, REED collaborated with the [[Department of Digital Humanities, King's College London]], and the Department of English at the [[University of Southampton]] to create ''Early Modern London Theatres''&lt;ref name="EMLoT" /&gt; (''EMLoT''), a research database and educational resource, with learning modules.  ''EMLoT'' gathers documents related to professional theatres north and south of the Thames up to 1642 and bibliographic information about their subsequent transcriptions, documenting how scholars “got [their] information about the early theatres, from whom and when.”&lt;ref&gt;Principal investigator John McGavin quoted in {{cite magazine |last=Reisz |first=Matthew  |title=Reading the Riot Acts and Scenes of London's Violent Theatrical Past |date=3 March 2011 |url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/reading-the-riot-acts-and-scenes-of-londons-violent-theatrical-past/415326.article |magazine=[[Times Higher Education]] |access-date=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, to mark the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s death, REED collaborated with the [[BBC]] and [[The British Library]] to produce an ongoing public website titled Shakespeare on Tour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03fcz11 Shakespeare on Tour] - Official website.&lt;/ref&gt;   Many REED editors contributed stories and images from their research in the Elizabethan period to help raise “the curtain on performances of The Bard’s plays countrywide from the 16th Century to the present day.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03fcz11 |title=Shakespeare on Tour, Homepage |access-date=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Throughout its existence, REED maintained its primary focus and published about six collections each decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reed.utoronto.ca/print-collections-2/print-collections/ |title=Published Collections |publisher=REED |access-date=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, REED published its last print collection (''Civic London to 1558'', edited by Anne Lancashire),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=King |first=Pamela |url=http://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/private/reed-drama/ |title=Unbroken REED |magazine=Times Literary Supplement |date=26 May 2017 |access-date=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 2017, the first digital collection (''Staffordshire'', edited by Alan B. Somerset) was made freely available on its publication website, ''REED Online''&lt;ref name="REEDonline" /&gt;. All subsequent collections will be added to this database and website.

REED has received substantial funding from private individuals and foundations (including the Jackman Foundation), the [[Canada Council]], and the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council]] in Canada; the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] and the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]] in the U.S.; as well as the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] and [[The British Academy]] in the U.K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Rynor |first=F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21928">In [[Social psychology (psychology)|social psychology]], '''social value orientation''' ('''SVO''') is a person's preference about how to allocate resources (e.g. money) between the self and another person. SVO corresponds to how much weight a person attaches to the welfare of others in relation to the own. Since people are assumed to vary in the weight they attach to other peoples' outcomes in relation to their own, SVO is an [[Differential psychology|individual difference]] variable. The general concept underlying SVO has become widely studied in a variety of different scientific disciplines, such as [[economics]], [[sociology]], and [[biology]] under a multitude of different names (e.g. ''[[social preferences]]'', ''other-regarding preferences'', ''welfare tradeoff ratios'', ''social motives'', etc.).

==Historical background==
The SVO construct has its history in the study of interdependent decision making, i.e. strategic interactions between two or more people. The advent of [[Game theory]] in the 1940s provided a formal language for describing and analyzing situations of interdependence based on [[utility theory]]. As a simplifying assumption for analyzing strategic interactions, it was generally presumed that people only consider their own outcomes when making decisions in interdependent situations, rather than taking into account the interaction partners' outcomes as well. However, the study of human behavior in [[social dilemma]] situations, such as the [[Prisoner's dilemma]], revealed that some people do in fact appear to have concerns for others.

In the [[Prisoner's dilemma]], participants are asked to take the role of two criminals. In this situation, they are to pretend that they are a pair of criminals being interrogated by detectives in separate rooms. Both participants are being offered a deal and have two options. That is, the participant may remain silent or confess and implicate his or her partner. However, if both participants choose to remain silent, they will be set free. If both participants confess they will receive a moderate sentence. Conversely, if one participant remains silent while the other confesses, the person who confesses will receive a minimal sentence while the person who remained silent (and was implicated by their partner) will receive a maximum sentence. Thus, participants have to make the decision to cooperate with or compete with their partner. 

When used in the lab, the dynamics of this situation are stimulated as participants play for points or for money. Participants are given one of two choices, labeled option C or D. Option C would be the cooperative choice and if both participants choose to be cooperative then they will both earn points or money. On the other hand, Option D is the competitive choice. If just one participants chooses option D, that participant will earn points or money while the other player will lose money. However, if both participant pick D, then both of them will lose money. In addition to displaying participant's '''social value orientations''', it also displays the dynamics of a mixed-motives situation.&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth, D.R. (2006). Conflict. In Forsyth, D. R., Group Dynamics (5th Ed.) (P. 378-407) Belmont: CA, Wadsworth, Cengage Learning&lt;/ref&gt; 

From behavior in strategic situations it is not possible, though, to infer peoples' motives, i.e. the joint outcome they would choose if they alone could determine it. The reason is that behavior in a strategic situation is always a function of both peoples' preferences about joint outcomes ''and'' their beliefs about the intentions and behavior of their interaction partners.

In an attempt to assess peoples' preferences over joint outcomes alone, disentangled from their beliefs about the other persons' behavior, David M. Messick and Charles G. McClintock in 1968&lt;ref name="Messick68"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Motivational Bases of Choice in Experimental Games | last = Messick| first = D. M. |author2=McClintock, C. G.  | year = 1968 | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | pages = 1–25 | volume = 4 | doi = 10.1016/0022-1031(68)90046-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; devised what has become known as the ''decomposed game technique''. Basically, any task where one decision maker can alone determine which one out of at least two own-other resource allocation options will be realized is a ''decomposed game'' (also often referred to as [[dictator game]], especially in [[economics]], where it is often implemented as a constant-sum situation). 

By observing which own-other resource allocation a person chooses in a ''decomposed game'', it is possible to infer that person's preferences over own-other resource allocations, i.e. ''social value orientation''. Since there is no other person making a decision that affects the joint outcome, there is no interdependence, and therefore a potential effect of beliefs on behavior is ruled out.

To give an example, consider two options, A and B. If you choose option A, you will receive $100, and another (unknown) person will receive $10. If you choose option B, you will receive $85, and the other (unknown) person will also receive $85. This is a ''decomposed game''. If a person chooses option B, we can infer that this person does not only consider the outcome for the self when making a decision, but also takes into account the outcome for the other.

==Conceptualization==
When people seek to maximize their gains, they are said to be '''proself'''. But when people are also concerned with other's gains and losses, they are said to be '''prosocial'''. There are four categories within SVO. Individualistic and competitive SVOs are proself while cooperative and altruistic SVOs are prosocial:&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth, D.R. (2006). Conflict. In Forsyth, D. R., Group Dynamics (5th Ed.) (P. 378-407) Belmont: CA, Wadsworth, Cengage Learning&lt;/ref&gt; 

*'''Individualistic orientation''': Members of this category are concerned only with their own outcomes. They make decisions based on what they think they will personally achieve, without concern for others outcomes. They are focused only on their own outcomes and therefore do not get involved with other group members. they neither assist nor interfere. However their actions may indirectly impact other members of the group but such impact is not their goal.
*'''Competitive orientation''': Competitors much like individualists strive to maximize their own outcomes, but in addition they seek to minimize others outcomes. disagreements and arguments are viewed as win-lose situations and competitors find satisfaction in forcing their ideas upon others. A competitor has the belief that each person should get the most they can in each situation and play to win every time. Those with competitive SVOs are more likely to find themselves in conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth, D.R. (2006). Conflict. In Forsyth, D. R., Group Dynamics (5th Ed.) (P. 378-407) Belmont: CA, Wadsworth, Cengage Learning&lt;/ref&gt; Competitors cause cooperators to react with criticism to their abrasive styles. However, competitors rarely modify their behavior in response to these complaints because they are relatively unconcerned with maintaining interpersonal relations.
*'''Cooperative orientation''': Cooperators tend to maximize their own outcomes as well as other's outcomes. They prefer strategies that generate win-win situations. When dealing with other people they believe that it is better if everyone comes out even in a situation.
*'''Altruistic orientation''': altruists are motivated to help other who are in need. Members of this category are low in self-interest. They willingly sacrifice their own outcomes in the hopes of helping others achieve gain.

However, in 1973 Griesinger and Livingston &lt;ref name="Living73"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Toward a model of interpersonal motivation in experimental games | last = Griesinger |first = D. W. |author2=Livingston, J. W.  | year = 1973 | journal = Behavioral Science | pages = 173–188 | volume = 18 | doi = 10.1002/bs.3830180305| issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided a geometric framework of SVO (the ''SVO ring'', see ''Figure 1'') with which they could show that SVO is in principle not a categorical, but a continuous construct that allows for an infinite number of social value orientations. 

[[File:SVO Ring.pdf|thumb|''Figure 1'': The SVO ring &lt;ref name="Living73"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Liebrand84"/&gt;]]

The basic idea was to represent outcomes for the self (on the ''x-axis'') and for the other (on the ''y-axis'') on a [[Cartesian plane]], and represent own-other payoff allocation options as coordinates on a circle centered at the origin of the plane. If a person chooses a particular own-other outcome allocation on the ring, that person's SVO can be represented by the [[angle]] of the line starting at the origin of the Cartesian plane and intersecting the coordinates of the respective chosen own-other outcome allocation. 

If, for instance, a person would choose the option on the circle that maximizes the own outcome, this would refer to an ''SVO angle'' of &lt;math&gt;0^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;, indicating a perfectly individualistic SVO. An angle of &lt;math&gt;45^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt; would indicate a perfectly cooperative (maximizing joint outcomes) SVO, while an angle of &lt;math&gt;-45^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt; would indicate a perfectly competitive (maximizing relative gain) SVO. This conceptualization indicates that SVO is a continuous construct, since there is an infinite number of possible SVOs, because angular degrees are [[Continuous function|continuous]]. 

This advancement in the conceptualization of the SVO construct also clarified that SVO as originally conceptualized can be represented in terms of a [[utility function]] of the following form

&lt;math&gt; U_{(\pi_{s}, \pi_{o})} = a*\pi_{s} + b*\pi_{o}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\pi_{s}&lt;/math&gt; is the outcome for the self, &lt;math&gt;\pi_{o}&lt;/math&gt; is the outcome for the other, and the parameters indicate the weight a person attaches to the own outcome (&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;) and the outcome for the other (&lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;).

==Measurement==
Several different measurement methods exist for assessing SVO.&lt;ref name="AuKwong2004"&gt;{{cite book|title=Contemporary psychological research on social dilemmas|year=2004|publisher=New York: Cambridge University Press|author=Au, W.T.|author2=Kwong, J.Y.Y. |editor=Suleiman, R. |editor2=Budescu, D. |editor3=Fischer, I. |editor4=Messick, D.|pages=71–98|chapter=Measurement and effects of social-value orientation in social dilemmas}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basis for any of these measures is the ''decomposed game technique'', i.e. a set of non-constant-sum [[dictator game]]s. The most commonly used SVO measures are the following.

===Ring Measure===
The Ring measure was devised by Wim B. G. Liebrand in 1984&lt;ref name="Liebrand84"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = 'The effect of social motives, communication and group size on behaviour in an n-person multi stage mixed motive game | last = Liebrand |first = W. B. G. | year = 1984 | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology | pages = 239–264| volume = 14 | doi = 10.1002/ejsp.2420140302| issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is based on the geometric SVO framework proposed by Griesinger and Livingston in 1973.&lt;ref name="Living73"/&gt; In the Ring measure, subjects are asked to choose between 24 pairs of options that allocate money to the subject and the "other". The 24 pairs of outcomes correspond to equally spaced adjacent own-other-payoff allocations on an ''SVO ring'', i.e. a circle with a certain radius centered at the origin of the Cartesian plane. The vertical axis (y) measures the amount of points or money allocated to the other and the horizontal axis (x) measures the amount allocated to the self. Each pair of outcomes corresponds to two adjacent points on the circle. Adding up a subject's 24 choices yields a ''motivational vector'' with a certain length and angle. The length of the vector indicates the consistency of a subject's choice behavior, while the angle indicates that subject's SVO. Subjects are then categorized into one out of eight SVO categories according to their SVO angle, given a sufficiently consistent choice pattern. This measure allows for the detection of uncommon pathological SVOs, such as masochism, sadomasochism, or martyrdom, which would indicate that a subject attaches a negative weight (&lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt;) to the outcome for the self given the utility function described above.

===Triple-Dominance Measure===
The triple-dominance measure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Lange|first=P.A.M. |author2=Otten, W. |author3=De Bruin, E.M.N. |author4=Joireman, J.A. |title=Development of prosocial, individualistic, and competitive orientations: Theory and preliminary evidence|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1997|volume=73|issue=4|pages=733–746|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.73.4.733|url=http://www.paulvanlange.com/s/VanLange1997.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; is directly based on the use of ''decomposed games'' as suggested by Messick and McClintock (1968).&lt;ref name="Messick68"/&gt; Concretely, the triple-dominance measure consists of nine items, each of which asks a subject to choose one out of three own-other-outcome allocations. The three options do have the same characteristics in each of the items. One option maximizes the outcome for the self, a second option maximizes the sum of the outcomes for the self and the other (joint outcome), and the third option maximizes the relative gain (i.e. the difference between the outcome for the self and the outcome for the other). If a subject chooses an option indicating a particular SVO in at least six out of the nine items, the subject is categorized accordingly. That is, a subject is categorized as ''cooperative/prosocial'', ''individualistic'', or ''competitive''.

===Slider Measure===
The Slider measure&lt;ref name=Murphy2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=R.O.|author2=Ackermann, K.A. |author3=Handgraaf, M.J.J. |title=Measuring social value orientation|journal=Journal of Judgment and Decision Making|year=2011|volume=6|issue=8|pages=771–781|url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~baron/journal/11/m25/m25.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; assess SVO on a continuous scale, rather than categorizing subjects into [[Nominal category|nominal]] motivational groups. The instrument consists of 6 primary and 9 secondary items. In each item of the paper-based version of the Slider measure, a subject has to indicate her most preferred own-other outcome allocation out of nine options. From a subject's choices in the primary items, the ''SVO angle'' can be computed. There is also an [https://web.archive.org/web/20120208084452/http://vlab.ethz.ch/svo/SVO_Slider/SVO_Slider.html online version of the Slider measure], where subjects can ''slide'' along a continuum of own-other payoff allocations in the items, allowing for a very precise assessment of a person's SVO. The secondary items can be used for differentiating between the motivations to maximize the joint outcome and to minimize the difference in outcomes ([[inequality aversion]]) among prosocial subjects. The SVO Slider Measure has been shown to be more [[Reliability (psychometrics)|reliable]] than previously used measures, and yields SVO scores on a continuous scale.&lt;ref name=Murphy2011/&gt;

==Neuroscience and Social Value Orientation==
Some recent papers have explored whether Social Value Orientation is somehow reflected on human brain activity. A functional magnetic resonance imaging study &lt;ref&gt;Christopoulos, GI &amp; King-Casas B. (2015). With you or against you: Social orientation dependent learning signals guide actions made for others, NeuroImage, Volume 104, 1 January 2015, Pages 326-335.&lt;/ref&gt;found that responses of Medial Prefrontal Cortex - an area that is typically associated with social cognition- mirrored preferences over competitive, individualistic and cooperative allocations. Similar findings in this or neighboring areas (ventromedial and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex) have been reported elsewhere &lt;ref&gt;
Kuss K, Falk A, Trautner P, Montag C, Weber B, Fliessbach K. Neuronal correlates of social decision making are influenced by social value orientation—an fMRI study. Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience. 2015;9:40. doi:10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00040.
&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Stylized facts==
SVO has been shown to be predictive of important behavioral variables, such as:

*cooperative behavior in [[social dilemma]]s &lt;ref name=Balliet2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Balliet|first=D.|author2=Parks, C. |author3=Joireman, J. |title=Social value orientation and cooperation in social dilemmas: A meta-analysis|journal=Group processes &amp; Intergroup relations|year=2009|volume=12|issue=4|pages=533–547|doi=10.1177/1368430209105040}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[helping behavior]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McClintock|first=C.G.|author2=Allison, S.T. |title=Social value orientation and helping behavior|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|year=1989|volume=19|issue=4|pages=353–362|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1989.tb00060.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[donation|donation behavior]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Lange|first=P.A.M.|author2=Bekkers, R. |author3=Schuyt, T. |author4= Van Vugt, M. |title=From games to giving: Social value orientation predicts donations to noble causes|journal=Basic and Applied Social Psychology|year=2007|volume=29|issue=4|pages=375–384|doi=10.1080/01973530701665223|url=http://www.professormarkvanvugt.com/files/FromGamestoGiving-BasicAndAppliedSocialPsychology-2007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[negotiation|negotiation behavior]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Dreu|first=C.K.W. |author2=Van Lange, P.A.M. |title=The impact of social value orientations on negotiator cognition and behavior|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=1995|volume=21|issue=11 |pages=1178–1188|url=http://dare.uva.nl/document/2913|doi=10.1177/01461672952111006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, it has been shown that individualism is prevalent among very young children, and that the frequency of expressions of prosocial and competitive SVOs increases with age. Among adults, it has been shown repeatedly that prosocial SVOs are most frequently observed (up to 60 percent), followed by individualistic SVOs (about 30-40 percent), and competitive SVOs (about 5-10 percent). Evidence also suggests that SVO is first and foremost determined by [[socialization]], and that [[genetic predisposition]] plays a minor role in SVO development.&lt;ref name="AuKwong2004"/&gt;

==Broader perspectives==
The SVO construct is rooted in [[Social psychology (psychology)|social psychology]], but has also been studied in other disciplines, such as [[economics]].&lt;ref name="Offernman96"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Value Orientations, Expectations and Voluntary Contributions in Public Goods | last = Offerman |first = T. |author2=Sonnemans J. |author3=Schram A. | year = 1996 | journal = The Economic Journal | pages = 817–845| volume = 106 | issue = 437 | doi = 10.2307/2235360 | publisher = Blackwell Publishing | jstor = 2235360}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the general concept underlying SVO is inherently interdisciplinary, and has been studied under different names in a variety of different scientific fields; it is the concept of distributive preferences. Originally, the SVO construct as conceptualized by the ''SVO ring framework''&lt;ref name="Living73"/&gt; did not include preferences such as [[inequality aversion]], which is a distributive preference heavily studied in [[experimental economics]]. This particular motivation can also not be assessed with commonly used measures of SVO, except with the ''SVO Slider Measure''.&lt;ref name=Murphy2011/&gt; The original SVO concept can be extended, though, by representing peoples' distributive preferences in terms of [[utility function]]s, as is standard in [[economics]]. For instance, a representation of SVO that includes the expression of a motivation to minimize differences between outcomes could be formalized as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Radzicki|first=J.|title=Technique of conjoint measurement of subjective value of own and other's gains|journal=Polish Psychological Bulletin|year=1976|volume=7|issue=3|pages=179–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt; U_{(\pi_{s}, \pi_{o})} = a*\pi_{s} + b*\pi_{o} - c*|\pi_{s} - \pi_{o}| &lt;/math&gt;.

Several utility functions as representations of peoples' concerns for the welfare of others have been devised and used (for a very prominent example, see Fehr &amp; Schmidt, 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fehr|first=E.|author2=Schmidt, K.M. |title=A theory of fairness, competition, and cooperation|journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics|year=1999|volume=114|issue=3|pages=817–868|doi=10.1162/003355399556151|url=http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/114/3/817.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in [[economics]]. It is a challenge for future interdisciplinary research to combine the findings from different scientific disciplines and arrive at a unifying theory of SVO. Representing SVO in terms of a utility function and going beyond the construct's original conceptualization may facilitate the achievement of this ambitious goal.

The '''Squeeze Box''' is an [[Magic (illusion)|illusion]] designed and originally performed by [[André Kole]].

== Effect ==
A person (the [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] or the [[magician's assistant|assistant]]) enters a horizontal box and extends their head out one end and their feet out of the other. A wheel is spun, squeezing both ends of the box towards the middle until the person's head is right next to their feet. The feet move throughout the effect and the person's hands can be shown out the top of the box. The box is stretched back out and the person emerges unharmed.

==History==
Star Music was founded in February 1995 as Star Recording, Inc. with Star Records as its label. The record label was created by ABS-CBN Corporation to diversify its functions from a broadcast media to a full entertainment company. Commercial operations of the label started in September 1995, signing an exclusive distribution agreement with [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music Entertainment Philippines]] (now Ivory Music and Video) in the entire country, except in Metro Manila. Due to its distribution agreement with Sony, Star Records endured problems with distributing titles in Metro Manila. In August 1996, the record label engage into licensing deals in order to strengthen its production base and gain entry into the Metro Manila market. It first signed a 3-year license agreement with JML Records, a local rock label. The deal enabled the label to gain control of its catalogue of 30 titles. Later, Star Records signed deals with foreign-independent labels such as Beaver Music of the [[Netherlands]], Music of Life of the [[United Kingdom]], and Rox of [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pari.com.ph/members/star.html | title=Star Records, Inc. Corporate Profile | publisher=''[[Philippine Association of the Record Industry]]'' | accessdate=March 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1996, Star Records renewed its licensing deal with Sony which also includes 30 dealerships in Metro Manila. The deal enabled the label to get a significant presence in Metro Manila's market. By December of the same year, the label's number of signed artists increased to twenty artists. In June 1997, Star Records signed a distribution and licensing agreement with [[Taiwan]]'s [[Rock Records]], which also involved products from about forty independent European and American labels. Also under this deal, albums by named international artists helped improved Star Records' market profile.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

In 2007, Star Records launched Acel, the former vocalist of the rock band [[Moonstar88]], as the country's first digital artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/music/807/songwriter-acel-to-be-launched-as-the-countrys-first-digital-artist- | title=Songwriter Acel to be launched as the country’s first digital artist | publisher=''[[Philippine Entertainment Portal]]'' | date=June 22, 2007 | accessdate=March 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015, the record label celebrates its 20th anniversary.

In 2013, Star Recording, Inc. and Star Songs, Inc. were both merged to [[Star Cinema|ABS-CBN Film Productions]]. In 2014, it changed its name to Star Music. In the same year, they launched their very own music downloading website. This is also the time where Star Music started to release their songs on iTunes, Spotify, and other music downloading and streaming websites and applications. They also revamped their YouTube channel as a response to the current trend in the consumption of music and video contents on the internet.

In September 2015, Star Music acquired the copyrights to around 116 original compositions of [[Tito Sotto]], [[Vic Sotto]] and [[Joey de Leon]] which includes songs popularized by 1970s group [[VST &amp; Co.]], [[Sharon Cuneta]], and [[Nora Aunor]], and popular songs such as "Ipagpatawad Mo", "Tayo'y Magsayawan" and "Awitin Mo, Isasayaw Ko."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=LOOK: Toni reunites with Tito, Vic and Joey|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/09/21/15/look-toni-reunites-tito-vic-and-joey|date=September 21, 2015|publisher=[[ABS-CBN News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Suikoden Tactics''''', originally released in [[Japan]] as {{nihongo|'''''Rhapsodia'''''|ラプソディア|Rapusodia}}, is a [[tactical role-playing game|tactical role-playing video game]] developed and published by [[Konami]] for the [[PlayStation 2]] console as part of their ''[[Suikoden]]'' series.  Initially released in Japan and North America in late 2005, the game was later made available in Europe and the PAL region in early 2006.  It is the first strategy-based installment of the series, using tactical, grid-based combat instead of the [[turn-based strategy|turn-based]] battles employed by previous games in the series.  The game's music was composed by series veteran Norikazu Miura and features the opening theme "Another World" performed by Japanese vocalist yoshiko.

The game's [[fantasy]] story is told in two parts, taking place both before and after the events of ''[[Suikoden IV]]'' released one year earlier, and features appearances by characters from the title. Players assume the role of Kyril, a young man investigating the power of mysterious weapons called "Rune Cannons," which hold strange powers of transformation.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Suikodentactics.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A battle sequence]]
''Suikoden Tactics'' is a [[tactical role-playing game]] and thus shares many traits with the [[genre]]. The player controls a young man named Kyril, and advances the plot by completing tactical battles and talking with other characters. The player can also recruit new characters to his cause, which often involves a short [[sidequest]]. In towns, the player can gather information, sharpen character's weaponry, learn new skills, and buy equipment.
Each character may use special "Runes" or items to imbue terrain squares with various elements. Characters each have a particular element on which their attack and defence is boosted by a significant amount when they occupy a space with the corresponding element, and the reverse is true if the character occupies a space with an element the character is weak to.

Another feature of the battle system in Suikoden Tactics is its use of supporting characters.  Such characters have no offensive value, as they can not attack, but impart various effects on the playing field such as healing, stealing, digging, and stat buffing.

Aside from that, the elemental runes and weapon runes from previous games return. Elemental Runes all have as their level 1 spell, a magic that turns an area of the playing field of a certain element. Weapon runes in Suikoden Tactics operate differently from previous Suikoden games. Instead of a single attack with infinite uses, weapon runes impart three different attacks that operate similarly to spell runes, as each attack is defined by a certain number of charges before it can no longer be used, although all MP would be recharged upon a level-up.

==Story==

The story of ''Suikoden Tactics'' begins about seven years before the events of ''[[Suikoden IV]]'', and establishes the reason why Kyril is determined to search out and destroy the Rune Cannons.  The prequel part of Suikoden Tactics ends with a traumatic event for Kyril, and how Brandeau gains the possession of the Rune of Punishment.

The game leaps forward about three years after the events of ''Suikoden IV'' takes place.  From here on, Kyril begins his investigation on Rune Cannons and eventually leads him north into the Kooluk Empire.  Kyril meets a mysterious man, Iskas, who hints at a connection between Rune Cannons and Kooluk.  From there, Kyril investigates further about connections between Kooluk and Rune Cannons, and soon leads Kyril to Kika and her pirate crew.  Clues turn Kyril's journey north, first to the fortress of El Eal, then finally into the Kooluk Empire itself.

During his investigation in the Kooluk Empire, Kyril and his company meets up with a young aristocrat girl named Corselia, who is later revealed as the granddaughter of the Emperor of the Kooluk Empire.  It is also here that Iskas finally reveals his real intentions and begins a plot to antagonize Kyril.

==Soundtrack==
The music for ''Suikoden Tactics'' was composed and arranged by [[Norikazu Miura]], who would go on to also compose the soundtrack of ''[[Suikoden V]]''.  The opening theme "Another World" was performed by [[yoshiko]].&lt;!-- Lowercase intentional.--&gt;  The music was released first as the ''Rhapsodia Privilege Collection'' was released on September 22, 2005.  It is a single CD containing selected tracks from the game as well as remixes from other ''Suikoden'' soundtracks.  It also features a preview of "Castle of Dawn," the music for the Ceras Lake castle in  ''[[Suikoden V]]'', which was at the time unpublished.  A week later on September 28, the ''Rhapsodia Original Soundtrack'' was released as a full compilation of the music in the game over 2 CDs.

''Suikoden Tactics'' was met with a fairly positive response in Japan, selling approximately 64,472 within its first year, enough to qualify it for a re-release under [[Sony]]'s "PlayStation the Best" distinction in November 2006 at a budget price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gensopedia.duefiumi.com/index.php?title=Suikoden_sales_figures |title=Suikoden sales figures |publisher=Gensopedia |date=July 3, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002150432/http://gensopedia.duefiumi.com/index.php?title=Suikoden_sales_figures |archivedate=October 2, 2008 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Famitsu]]'' gave it a score of two eights, one seven, and one eight for a total of 31 out of 40.&lt;ref name="Fami" /&gt;

The game received "average" reviews according to the [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] website [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MC" /&gt; [[GameSpot]] praised the game's user-friendliness and battle design, stating that the game was "fun for veterans and newcomers alike", yet found the game's "weak story and characters" and "spotty voice acting" to be its low points.&lt;ref name="GSpot" /&gt; [[IGN]] also found the game's battle system to be engaging, but ultimately declared the game's plot to be "paltry", urging the player to "[e]xpect more from battles rather than plotlines."&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; Conversely, ''[[Game Informer]]'' found the game too confusing with haphazard battle scenes, stating, "I'd rather have a simple and well-balanced game than a complicated and lopsided one, and ''Suikoden Tactics'' definitely has too many short legs."&lt;ref name="GI" /&gt; ''[[Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine]]'' stated that the gameplay "works when it's not broken", but was hindered by "boring" story sequences and "awful" graphics.&lt;ref name="OPM" /&gt;

[[Eurogamer]] found the game to be lackluster when compared to other tactical-based role-playing games, particularly those developed by [[Nippon Ichi Software]], declaring that ''Suikoden Tactics''{{'}}s "[b]attles are fun and fairly compulsive but this is a game we've played many times over, usually presented better, executed more beautifully and intertwined with a far superior story."&lt;ref name="Euro" /&gt;  [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]]'s ''[[X-Play]]'' echoed their sentiment, stating that "despite some interesting play mechanics, it's not nearly as deep as some of the other games on the market right now."&lt;ref name="XPlay" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3821">'''''TV Times''''' was an Australian [[magazine]], issued weekly, first published as a [[Sydney, Australia|Sydney]]-only publication in June 1958. The publication previewed upcoming storylines for popular television programs airing in Australia, featured interviews and a full weekly program guide. It was a long time rival to ''[[TV Week]]'' magazine until it was incorporated into that magazine in 1980.

== History ==
"TV Times" evolved out of a magazine titled ''TV News'', launched by the [[ABC Television|ABC]] in June 1958. It joined rival publications ''Television Preview'', produced by the Television Owners Club of Australia and launched in 1957, and an Australian Consolidated Press magazine titled "TV Times". They were joined in July 1958 by a Sydney edition of ''TV Week'', which had been publishing in Melbourne since December 1957 as ''TV-Radio Week''.

It was thought that four television titles in the market was unsustainable so ACP entered into a co-publishing deal with the ABC, which saw their respective magazines merged to become ''TV News-Times'' (soon simplified to ''TV Times''). By the end of the year, ''Television Preview'' was incorporated into ''TV Week'', leaving two rival publications in the market for the next two decades. ''TV Times'' notably gave far more space and cover stories to ABC programs than its rival. 

''TV Times'' began a Melbourne edition in August 1959. Both ''TV Times'' and ''TV Week'' continued to expand publication as television launched in other capital cities and regional areas across Australia. By 1961, there were editions covering every capital city except Hobart, which received Melbourne editions plus a local supplement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Keating|url=http://www.austlit.edu.au/austlit/page/9548170|title=Television Magazines|work=Austlit|date=18 November 2016|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''TV Week'' introduced a viewer-voted awards from 1958 called the "Logie Awards" (after John Logie Baird), so TV Times created the rival Australian Film and Television Awards called the "Sammy Awards" from 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://televisionau.com/2009/10/1979-october-13-19.html|title=1979: October 13-19|work=Television.AU|date=2009|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While ''TV Times'' was arguably regarded as more informative, ''TV Week'' began to lead by adding matte colour internal pages in 1962, while ''TV Times'' did little to stay ahead. In July 1968, when ''TV Week'' moved to a larger format, to match that of ''TV Times'', it immediately looked superior to its rival with glossy colour pages and a cleaner layout. Even when ''TV Times'' became a full-colour publication, the quality was considered inferior to that of ''TV Week''. 

In 1979, Southdown Press introduced a local version of the American ''"[[TV Guide]]"''. In 1980, the ABC elected to end its agreement with ACP, which purchased the ABC's interest in ''TV Times''. ACP entered into a partnership with News Limited, with ''TV Times'' immediately being incorporated into ''TV Week'' and the Australian version of ''TV Guide'' also incorporated that year. The revamped publication continued to be known as ''TV Week'' but was now a joint venture between [[Australian Consolidated Press]] and Southdown Press (later [[Pacific Publications]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15129">'''[[Netflix]]''' is an American-based company that offers a service for streaming movies and TV series over the [[Internet]]. Several technical development efforts were required to provide this service.

== Streaming ==
Initial [[DVD]] discs sent to customers via US mail often received criticisms of being scratched and unable to fully play the rented movie. The popularity of Netflix dramatically increased with the addition of streaming through an online queue. This led to the majority of Netflix users reliably streaming movies and television shows rather than receiving physical DVD discs by mail.

Initially streaming starting in 2007 solely using [[Microsoft]] technologies and codecs such as [[VC-1]] for video and [[Windows Media Audio]] (WMA) for audio, the rapid expansion and diversity of Netflix-capable devices have necessitated encoding into many different formats – including [[H.264]] (AVC), VC-1, [[H.263]] and [[High Efficiency Video Coding|H.265 (HEVC)]] for video, and [[Dolby Digital]], [[Dolby Digital Plus]], [[Advanced Audio Coding]] (AAC) and [[Ogg Vorbis]] for audio.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blog.streamingmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/2013SMEast-C101.pdf|title= A Brief History of Netflix Streaming |author= David Ronca |date= May 31, 2013 |accessdate= September 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Netflix, the vast number of codec and bitrate combinations can mean having to encode the same title 120 different times before it can be delivered to all streaming platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/12/complexity-in-digital-supply-chain.html|title=Complexity In The Digital Supply Chain|author=McEntee, Kevin|date=December 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Netflix uses [[adaptive bitrate streaming]] technology to adjust the video and audio quality to match a customer's broadband connection speed and realtime network conditions.

In 2015, [[BT Group|BT]]'s [[YouView]] launched [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] channels and a 4K box to watch it on in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 4K Netflix comes to YouView thanks to BT: Watch Ultra HD shows and films on your box – Pocket-lint|url = http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/136230-4k-netflix-comes-to-youview-thanks-to-bt-watch-ultra-hd-shows-and-films-on-your-box|website = www.pocket-lint.com|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2015, Netflix's 4K catalogue can be watched on BT's Ultra HD box. In order to stream the Ultra HD content, users need the top-tier subscription option.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BT's Ultra HD box can now stream Netflix in 4K|url = https://www.engadget.com/2015/12/21/bt-box-netflix-4k/|website = Engadget|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Netflix provides users the ability to choose their download rates quality of video on its website.

== Netflix API ==
On October 1, 2008, Netflix offered access to its service via a public [[application programming interface]] (API).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Netflix API Launches Tomorrow |url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/netflix_api_launches_tomorrow.php |publisher=ReadWriteWeb |accessdate=September 30, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002035838/http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/netflix_api_launches_tomorrow.php |archivedate=October 2, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Netflix API  allows access to data for all Netflix titles as well as access on a user's behalf to manage his or her movie queue. The API was free and allowed commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mashery.com/customers/netflix |title=Netflix API Management Solution |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216123114/http://www.mashery.com/customers/netflix |archivedate=2013-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A developer network included a forum for asking and answering questions.&lt;ref name="HackingNetflix"&gt;{{cite web| title=New York Times &amp; Rotten Tomatoes Add Netflix "Add" &amp; "Watch" Links |url=http://www.hackingnetflix.com/2009/02/ny-times-rotten-tomatoes-add-netflix-add-play-links.html |publisher=HackingNetflix |accessdate=February 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of using the service included [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and ''[[The New York Times]]'', which allow users to click to add titles to their Netflix queue or begin watching on "Watch Instantly" from their pages,&lt;ref name="HackingNetflix" /&gt; and [[Jinni (search engine)|Jinni]], which enabled one to search within Watch Instantly and imported some user information such as reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Jinni Searches Netflix better than Netflix |url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10199106-2.html |publisher=CNET |accessdate=March 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The API allowed developers to release Netflix applications for mobile devices. For example, on November 16, 2009, Netflix released an official [[Nokia phone|Nokia]] app that allowed some trailer streaming,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blog.netflix.com/2009/11/netflix-for-nokia-phones.html |title= Netflix for Nokia Phones |accessdate =April 2, 2011 |last= Hart |first= Michael |date= November 16, 2009 |publisher=Netflix}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on August 26, 2010, Netflix released an official iPhone app.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.netflix.com/2010/04/netflix-on-iphone.html |title=Netflix on iPhone? |date=April 2, 2010 |publisher=Netflix |accessdate=July 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, in June 2012, Netflix began to cut back the availability of its public API.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Upcoming_Changes_to_the_Netflix_API_Program |title= Upcoming Changes to the Netflix API Program |accessdate= June 21, 2012 |date= June 15, 2012 |publisher= Netflix |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120618004836/http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Upcoming_Changes_to_the_Netflix_API_Program |archivedate= June 18, 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The company instead focused on a small number of known partners using private interfaces, since most of the traffic came from those private interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Netflix API: Top 10 Lessons Learned (so far) |author= Daniel Jacobson and Sangeeta Narayanan |date= July 24, 2014 |url= http://www.slideshare.net/danieljacobson/top-10-lessons-learned-from-the-netflix-api-oscon-2014 |accessdate= September 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In June 2014, Netflix announced that they would be retiring the public API. This became effective November 14, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Netflix is shutting down its public API today |date= November 14, 2014 |author=  Janko Roettgers |work= GigaOm |url= https://gigaom.com/2014/11/14/netflix-is-shutting-down-its-public-api-today/ |accessdate= September 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Netflix then partnered with the developers of eight services deemed to have been the most valuable, including Instant Watcher, Fanhattan, Yidio, and Nextguide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Retiring_the_Netflix_Public_API |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140614024656/http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Retiring_the_Netflix_Public_API |dead-url= yes |archive-date= June 14, 2014 |title= Retiring the Netflix Public API |accessdate= August 11, 2014 |last= Jacobson |first= Daniel |date= June 13, 2014 |publisher= Netflix }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Information technology ==
In 2010, Netflix moved to using [[Amazon EC2]] for its [[information technology]] (IT) resources. Master copies of digital films from [[movie studio]]s are stored on [[Amazon S3]], and each film is encoded into over 50 different versions based on video resolution and audio quality using machines on the [[cloud computing|cloud]]. In total, Netflix has over 1 [[petabyte]] of data stored on Amazon,{{When|date=September 2016}} and the data is sent to [[content delivery network]]s (including [[Akamai Technologies]], [[Limelight Networks]] and [[Level 3 Communications]]) that feed the content to local [[Internet service provider|ISPs]]. Netflix uses a number of pieces of [[open-source software]] in its [[Backend as a service|backend]], including [[Java (software platform)|Java]], [[MySQL]], [[Gluster]], [[Apache Tomcat]], [[Apache Hive|Hive]], Chukwa, [[Apache Cassandra|Cassandra]] and [[Apache Hadoop|Hadoop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=Idu9OKnAOis|title=OSCON Data 2011, Adrian Cockcroft, "Data Flow at Netflix"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, 2012, a storm in the Eastern US caused power outages in a major Amazon data center. This caused a three-hour downtime in Netflix services, and resulted in some improvements to the Netflix recovery software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Netflix uncovers its own system faults following Amazon cloud outage |author= Yevgeniy Sverdlik |date= July 6, 2012 |work= Data Center Dynamics |url= http://www.datacenterdynamics.com/content-tracks/colo-cloud/netflix-uncovers-its-own-system-faults-following-amazon-cloud-outage/66596.article |accessdate= September 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another outage was experienced on December 24, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Netflix streaming down on some devices due to Amazon issues |work= The Verge |author= Bryan Bishop |date= December 24, 2012 |url= https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/24/3801978/netflix-streaming-down-on-some-devices-thanks-to-amazon-issues |accessdate= September 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Netflix developed several technologies to help manage its IT systems, an area known as [[DevOps]]. One tool is called the "simian army", which includes the "[[Chaos Monkey]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= What is Simian Army? |work= Git Hub |url= https://github.com/Netflix/SimianArmy/wiki |accessdate= September 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By intentionally creating different failures, the ability to survive them can be tested under controlled conditions before they affect customers. The technology is claimed under at least one patent, filed in 2010 with inventors Gregory S. Orzell and Yury Izrailevsky.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Validating the resiliency of networked applications |work= US Patent US20120072571 A1 |date= September 20, 2010 |author= Gregory S. Orzell and Yury Izrailevsky |url= https://www.google.com/patents/US20120072571 |accessdate= September 12, 2016 }} Published March 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar approaches were taken in the GameDay software by [[Jesse Robbins]] at [[Amazon.com]], "DIRT" created by at [[Google]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author2=Jesse Robbins|author2link=Jesse Robbins|author3=Kripa Krishnan|author4=John Allspaw|author=Tom Limoncelli|authorlink=Tom Limoncelli|title=Resilience Engineering: Learning to Embrace Failure |url= http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2371297 |journal=ACM Queue |date= September 12, 2012 |accessdate= September 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Chaos Lemur: Testing High Availability on Pivotal Cloud Foundry |author= Paul Harris |date= May 1, 2015 |url= https://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal-cloud-foundry/products/chaos-lemur-testing-high-availability-on-pivotal-cloud-foundry |accessdate= September 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The related software was made available on [[GitHub]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Chaos Monkey Released Into The Wild |author= Cory Bennett and Ariel Tseitlin |work= The Nteflix Tech Blog |date= July 30, 2012 |url= http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/07/chaos-monkey-released-into-wild.html |accessdate= September 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This approach has been used for case studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= DevOps Case Study: Netflix and the Chaos Monkey |date= April 30, 2015 |author= C. Arron Cois |publisher= Software Engineering Institute |url= https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/devops/2015/04/devops-case-study-netflix-and-the-chaos-monkey.html |accessdate= September 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as the title of a 2016 memoir on a life in [[Silicon Valley]], ''[[Chaos Monkeys]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Chaos Monkeys |work= Blog |author= García Martínez |url= http://www.antoniogarciamartinez.com/chaos-monkeys/ |accessdate= September 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Chaos Monkey and Neutron |date= January 29, 2015 |url= http://go.bigswitch.com/rs/974-WXR-561/images/Chaos%20Monkey%20-%20OpenStack%20-%20Big%20Cloud%20Fabric.pdf |accessdate= September 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open Connect ==
Netflix settlement freely [[peering|peers]] with [[Internet service provider]]s (ISPs) directly and at common [[Internet exchange point]]s.
In June 2012, a custom [[content delivery network]] called Open Connect was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Netflix Rolls Out Its Own CDN: Open Connect |date= June 4, 2016 |author=  Ryan Lawler |work= Tech Crunch |url= https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/04/netflix-open-connect/ |accessdate= September 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
For larger ISPs that have over 100,000 subscribers Netflix offers free ''Netflix Open Connect'' [[server appliance]]s that cache Netflix content within the ISPs' [[data center]]s or networks to further reduce [[Internet transit]] costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.netflix.com/openconnect|title=Netflix Open Connect Content Delivery Network|work=netflix.com|accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsavitz/2012/06/05/netflix-shifts-traffic-to-its-own-cdn-akamai-limelight-shrs-hit/|title=Netflix Shifts Traffic To Its Own CDN; Akamai, Limelight Shrs Hit|author=Eric Savitz|date=June 5, 2012|work=Forbes|accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Open Connect appliances are purpose-built servers that focus on low power and high storage density, and run the [[FreeBSD]] operating system, [[nginx]] and the [[Bird Internet routing daemon]].&lt;ref name="cdn2013"&gt;{{Cite web |title= Netflix Content Delivery |work= Content Delivery Summit |date= May 22, 2013 |url= http://blog.streamingmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2013CDNSummit-Keynote-Netflix.pdf |accessdate= September 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By August 2016, Netflix closed its last physical data center, but continued to develop its Open Connect technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Netflix's data centers are dead, long live the CDN! |author= Peter Judge |date= August 20, 2015 |work= Data Center Dynamics |url= http://www.datacenterdynamics.com/content-tracks/colo-cloud/netflixs-data-centers-are-dead-long-live-the-cdn/94661.fullarticle |accessdate= September 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 study at the [[University of London]] detected 233 individual locations over six continents, with the largest amount of traffic in the USA, followed by Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Boffins map Netflix's Open Connect CDN: Six continents, 233 locations, thousands of servers |author= Richard Chirgwin |date= June 22, 2016 |work= The Register |url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/06/22/boffins_map_netflixs_open_connect_cdn/ |accessdate= September 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title= Open Connect Everywhere: A Glimpse at the Internet Ecosystem through the Lens of the Netflix CDN |journal=ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communications Review |volume= 48 |issue= 1 |orig-year=Submitted June 17, 2017 |date=January 2018 |first1=Timm |last1=Böttger |first2=Felix |last2=Cuadrado |first3=Gareth |last3=Tyson |first4=Ignacio |last4=Castro |first5=Steve |last5=Uhlig |arxiv= 1606.05519 |bibcode=2016arXiv160605519B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The NBC Monday Movie''''' was a television [[anthology series]] of films that debuted on February 4, 1963 (in the middle of the [[1962–63 United States network television schedule|1962-63 season)]], and ran off on [[NBC]].  It was referred to as '''''NBC Monday Night at the Movies''''' prior to the mid-1980s. The show moved to Wednesday nights in 1964 as '''''NBC Wednesday Night at the Movies''''', and in 1965, the program moved to Tuesdays, under the title '''''The NBC Tuesday Night Movie'''''. The name would henceforth change depending on what night of the week the program was telecast. By 1968, there was once again a weekly  '''''NBC Monday Night Movie'''''  on the air.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080314052510/http://www.getty.net/texts/tv-67-83.txt http://www.getty.net/texts/tv-67-83.txt] (Cached by [[Internet Archive]])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The idea for the show came about when advertisers opted out of two hour-long shows the network ran on Monday nights for the 1962-1963 season, ''[[It's a Man's World (TV series)|It's A Man's World]]'' and ''[[Saints and Sinners (1962 TV series)|Saints and Sinners]]''. Presumably, both shows were cancelled due to low audience numbers.  Having experienced some success with [[NBC Saturday Night at the Movies]], the network decided to acquire more [[feature film]]s as a stop-gap measure.  A package of 42 movies from [[20th Century Fox]] and 35 titles from [[MGM]] were purchased by the network for both its Monday and Saturday night movie series at a cost of $14 million.&lt;ref&gt;UPI Interview with Don Bays, in charge of movies at NBC. Western Kansas Press, Great Bend, April 27, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;  With a 7:30 pm (EST) start time, the movies of the show's first season were made up of mostly light comedies, an occasional swashbuckler such as ''[[Prince Valiant (1954 film)|Prince Valiant]]'',  and musicals.  These types of films were also chosen because they typically ran under 100 minutes, the normal running-time for a two-hour movie slot in 1963.

In the latter years of ''Monday Night Movie's'' run, mostly [[Television movie|made-for-TV movie]]s were showcased.  The theatrical films were [[Editing|edited]] for content, to remove objectionable material, and occasionally, but not always, to reduce the film's running time to fit into the two-hour time slot. As all widescreen films were then, they were [[pan-and-scan]]ned so the image would fit the standard 4:3 television screen (as opposed to [[letterbox]] format). An exception was [[Show Boat (1951 film)|the 1951 film version of "Show Boat"]], which made its television debut on ''NBC Monday Night at the Movies'' in 1972 and had not been filmed in widescreen. The choice of ''Show Boat'' as a movie offering on the program was rather unusual, given the fact that it was, at the time, a twenty-one-year-old film, rather than a recent one.

==The first two series of films (February 1963-April 1964)==
The first incarnation of ''NBC Monday Night at the Movies'' lasted from February 1963 until early September 1964.  Despite the promise of big name stars each week, the series was no match for the [[CBS]] lineup of game shows and sitcoms such as ''[[The Lucy Show]]'' and ''[[The Danny Thomas Show]]''.  In hopes of better ratings and to re-coup some of their investment, the films in the second list below would be re-broadcast on ''[[NBC Saturday Night at the Movies]]'' in the late spring and summer of 1964.&lt;ref&gt;TV Listings Pages;San Antonio Light Newspaper; San Antonio, TX; September 1963-April 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless otherwise indicated, all films aired from 7:30pm–9:30pm Eastern Time on Monday Nights. The last number in the second list below notes the Nielsen rating the movie received:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1969/1969-11-03-BC.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

These first sixteen titles (all produced by 20th Century Fox studios) were aired on the following dates:&lt;ref&gt;February–May 1963 TV listings of ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{colend}}                                                  
From here through September 9, the above titles were rerun on Monday nights. None of them appeared on NBC's other film series, ''[[Saturday Night at the Movies (NBC series)|Saturday Night at the Movies]]''. The second season began below and mixed in MGM titles with those of 20th Century Fox. Like the above-listed films, these were all television premieres. The Nielsen ratings are listed next to the release year of each title.

One interesting note: There is no entry below for November 25, 1963. This was the Monday after the Friday that [[John F. Kennedy|President John Kennedy]] was assassinated. Monday was the date of the state funeral, which was given all-day coverage by the networks. Understandably, NBC thus postponed broadcasting the musical ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (originally slated for 11/25/63) until later in the season.

From here, reruns were shown for the remainder of the season until mid-September 1964, when NBC announced that it would discontinue ''Monday Night at the Movies''. Instead, a new prime-time movie night, Wednesdays, from 9 until 11 p.m. (ET), became the time slot for the network's alternative film anthology during [[1964-65 United States network television schedule|the 1964-65 season]]&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Val. "NBC-TV Acquires Post-1948 Movies: Buys Paramount Features for Showing in Fall." ''New York Times''. (February 12, 1964): p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; while Saturday nights remained a mainstay for NBC's film broadcasts.

'''''The New Leave It to Beaver''''' (also known as '''''Still the Beaver''''') is an American [[sitcom]] [[sequel]] to the original 1957–1963 sitcom ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]''. The series began with the 1983 reunion [[television movie]] ''Still the Beaver'' that aired on [[CBS]] in March 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=191&amp;dat=19830313&amp;id=i6wvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nC4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6767,1269573&amp;hl=en|title=Mathers returns to star in "Still the Beaver"|date=March 13, 1983|work=Bulletin Journal|page=11|accessdate=May 2, 2016|location=Cape Girardeau, Missouri}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Applebaum1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Irwyn Applebaum|title=The World According to Beaver|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dV8NAAAACAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-1-57500-052-7|page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The success of the television movie prompted the creation of a revival series, also titled ''Still the Beaver'', that aired on the [[Disney Channel]] from 1984 to 1985. In 1986, the series was picked up by [[Turner Broadcasting System|TBS]] where it aired until June 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=King|first1=Susan|title=Retro : A Day in the Life of a Modern Atomic Age Family : TBS AIRS 24 HOURS OF 'LEAVE IT TO BEAVER'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-12-25/news/tv-12722_1_beaver-leave-airs|accessdate=29 January 2016|agency=Los Angeles Times|date=25 December 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|title=Two Studios Announce Exclusive Cable Deals|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/25/arts/two-studios-announce-exclusive-cable-deals.html|accessdate=October 10, 2015|work=New York Times|date=April 25, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''The New Leave It to Beaver'' is one of the rare examples of a television series revival sequel (not [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]]) that revolves around the characters from the original series. Other examples of this include ''[[The New WKRP in Cincinnati]]''  and ''[[What's Happening Now!!]]'', as well as the sequel to ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' and the two sequel series to ''[[The Brady Bunch]]''.

==Synopsis==
The series focuses on [[Wally Cleaver]] ([[Tony Dow]]) and his younger brother, [[Theodore Cleaver|Theodore "Beaver" Cleaver]] ([[Jerry Mathers]]) as adults and with families of their own. The Beaver is divorced and living with his mother, the widowed [[June Cleaver]] ([[Barbara Billingsley]]), along with his two sons, Kip and Oliver. [[Wally Cleaver]] lives next door with his wife [[Leave It to Beaver characters and cast#Wally's friends and classmates|Mary Ellen]], his daughter Kelly and later, his son Kevin. [[Hugh Beaumont]], who played [[Ward Cleaver]] in the original series, had died in 1982. His character, Ward, died in 1977.

Other series regulars included Wally's old friend [[Eddie Haskell]] ([[Ken Osmond]]) and his sons Freddie and Bomber (played by Osmond's two real-life sons), as well as [[Clarence Rutherford|"Lumpy" Rutherford]] ([[Frank Bank]]) and his daughter J.J., with [[Diane Brewster]] returning for four episodes to recreate her role as "Miss Canfield," Beaver's original grade schoolteacher. Some of Beaver's old friends, [[Larry Mondello]] ([[Rusty Stevens]]), and [[Richard Rickover]]  ([[Rich Correll]]), return to the series.

==Plot==
After being devastated in the third World War (known as The Third Division), Japan was divided in two. Several years after the end of the war, a crime organization called Vischio has taken control of the destroyed city of Toshima (formerly Tokyo, Japan's capital city), where they are holding a battle game known as ''Igura''.

''Igura'' is a battle game held in Toshima that may result in the murder of participants. To participate, one must meet with Arbitro and tell him their reason for their decision. Upon meeting with Arbitro, participants are given five dog tags, each engraved like a card in a standard deck of playing cards. One tag must hang from the participant's neck as proof of participation. Participants must then put their lives on the line to collect others' tags, with the goal being to collect a Royal Flush. If a participant collects a Royal Flush set of tags, they earn the right to challenge "Il Re" in battle. Battles end when one party either dies or lets their back touch the ground. The winner takes the loser's tags and is free to do as they please to the loser after that, often resulting in the loser's death.

The game's main character, a young man named Akira, is falsely accused of a crime. Once arrested, a mysterious woman appears before him, offering him freedom if he agrees to participate in Igura and defeat Igura's strongest man: the king, or ''Il Re''. The story follows Akira's life in the harsh, lawless Toshima as he fights both to survive and to unravel the mysteries developing around him.

==Characters==
;{{nihongo|Akira|アキラ}}
:{{Anime voice|[[Kosuke Toriumi]] (PS2, Anime, Drama CD)}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Togani-no-chi-Akira.jpg|left|70px|Akira]] --&gt;
:The game's protagonist. Akira is the cool and silent type. He has grayish hair, blue eyes, and stands at 172cm tall. Likes omelet rice flavored Solids. He grew up as an orphan along with Keisuke. Akira was an undefeated champion of the street fighting game "Bl@ster", where he participated in the RAY district under the name LOST. He was accused of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment, but Emma got him out of jail so he could participate in Igura, which he does with slight reluctance. He usually acts cold and uncaring, but has a very naive side to him. His weapon is a knife.

;{{nihongo|Keisuke|ケイスケ}}
:{{Anime voice|[[Tomokazu Sugita]], credited as "Nanimusha" for the PC and drama CD}}
:Akira's childhood friend and hard-working factory employee. Has brown hair and eyes and is 178cm tall. Likes green curry flavored Solids. They grew up together in the same orphanage. Because he is a bit weak, he has always admired Akira's strength. Though he is a bit quiet and shy, if Akira is involved, he suddenly becomes bold. Upon hearing Akira's situation, Keisuke chases after Akira and also joins Igura, despite his weakness and lack of fighting experience.

;{{nihongo|Rin|リン}}
:{{Anime voice|[[Jun Fukuyama]], credited as "Hayato Kiryuin" for the PC and drama CD}}
:A young blond, blue-eyed boy participating in Igura. 154cm tall. Though he is sometimes mistaken for a girl because of his small body, he is quite strong and able to get by in Igura. He helps Akira around the town and cheers up Akira when he's down. In the anime, it is mentioned that Rin and Shiki are half brothers, having the same father but different mothers. He is a former Bl@ster participant (from the GHOST area) who fights with two small daggers and also enjoys taking pictures. Likes the [[yakiniku]] flavored Solids. He's also good at parkour, as he jumps from roofs and walls in the manga and anime.

;{{nihongo|Shiki|シキ}}
:{{Anime voice|[[Hikaru Midorikawa]]}}
:A black-haired, red-eyed man standing at 188cm and covered in black clothing who arms himself with a katana. He is the strongest man in Igura. Because he often appears in front of Igura participants and slays them immediately and with no warning, he is extremely feared. Though he kills Igura participants frequently, he neither carries nor collects tags, and thus does not appear to be an Igura participant. He is a violent man shrouded in mystery. The first Il Re who has never been defeated. Shiki formed the Igura in order to battle against Line-compatibles, so he could kill Nano and quell his memories of the first time they met.

;{{nihongo|Motomi|源泉}}
:{{Anime voice|[[Kazuya Ichijō]]}}
:An unshaven, middle-aged information collector who knows a lot about the tournament. Has brown hair and eyes and stands at 183cm tall. He has a friendly, carefree personality and is a heavy smoker. He does not participate in the game, but is in Toshima to observe it. He carries a gun for protection.

;{{nihongo|Arbitro|アルビトロ|Arubitoro}}
:{{Anime voice|[[Masaru Hishi]] (PC, Drama CD), [[Kōsuke Okano]] (PS2, Anime)}}
:Manager of the narcotics organization Vischio. A gaudy blond man who always wears a mask over his face. 181cm tall. Has a strange hobby involving appreciating and modifying the bodies of attractive young men. Due to this "hobby", his mansion is full of statues of nude men and he keeps Kau, a human being, as his pet 'dog'.

;{{nihongo|Kau|狗}}
:Arbitro's beloved 'pet', who is actually a young boy. He has white hair, is covered in black leather and a blindfold, and has a large scar and piercings on his stomach (due to Arbitro's personal preferences), and walks on all fours. Because Arbitro destroyed his eyes and vocal cords, he cannot see or speak. He does, however, have a keen sense of smell, and has been trained to pick up the scent of dog tags to help find rule-breakers within Igura. His name's kanji means "dog" in Japanese. He shows signs of severe Stockholm syndrome.

;{{nihongo|Kiriwar|キリヲ|Kiriwo}}
:{{Anime voice|[[Fuji Bakuhatsu]] (PC, Drama CD), [[Katsuyuki Konishi]] (PS2, Anime)}}
:Executes the rule violators of the tournament. Though he works for Arbitro, his ties to him are loose and he often likes to get him mad. At 200cm, he is a tall, strong man who carries a metal pipe (which he has lovingly named "Mitsuko") as a weapon. He has short, black hair and a scar across his forehead. He is usually seen with Gunji, who he calls "hiyo" or "hiyoko" (which means "baby chick"). Kiriwar likes to mess with Arbitro and seems to not care much about his job. His name is pronounced "Kiriwo" but is officially written as "Kiriwar".

;{{nihongo|Gunji|グンジ}}
:{{Anime voice|[[Kazuya Sugisaki]] (PC, Drama CD), [[Kishō Taniyama]] (PS2, Anime)}}
:Executes the rule violators of the tournament. He is a 195cm tall blond man who fights with metal knuckle claws. He wears a bright red hooded jacket that is open at the front, exposing most of his tattoo-covered torso. Gunji is not very smart and acts spontaneously and violently, and is extremely sadistic in his killings, but still has a fun-loving, childish innocence to him. Gunji has an affinity with name calling. He is usually seen with Kiriwar, who he calls "jijii" ("old man"), calls Arbitro "papa", and Shiki "Shikitty". Gunji seems to confuse cats with dogs, since although Kau is supposed to be a pet "dog", Gunji refers to him as 'Tama', which is a common pet name for a cat. In the manga, he also names a cat that he finds 'Pochi', the common pet name for a dog. Also, though many English-speaking fans spell and pronounce his name as "Gunzi", the name "Gunji" is considered the 'official' name as it is used most often and also used on official merchandise.

;{{nihongo|Emma|エマ|Ema}}
:{{Anime voice|[[Kaori Okuda]] (PC), [[Asako Dodo]] (PS2)}}
:A beautiful one-armed woman. 167cm tall. She is the one who suggests participating in Igura to Akira as a way to free him of his false charge. She is often seen with Gwen. Very little is known about her, but before the war she worked as a scientist. In the manga, by Chayamachi, she is seen taking care of Nano.

;{{nihongo|Gwen|グエン|Guen}}
:{{Anime voice|[[Kikutarō Namerikawa]] (PC), [[Takuo Kawamura]] (PS2)}}
:A serious man in a suit and hat that appears with Emma to convince Akira to participate in Igura. An honest man with a normally harsh expression. 178cm tall.

;{{nihongo|Takeru|猛}}
:{{Anime voice|[[Takezō Koike]] (PC), [[Hideki Ogihara]] (PS2)}}
:A one-eyed youth participating in Igura with an extreme passion to win, no matter what it takes.

;{{nihongo|Nano|ナノ|Nano}}
:{{Anime voice|[[Prof. Shiryuu]] (PC), [[Takumi Yamazaki]] (PS2)}}
:Known as N or Nano, he is an enigmatic figure throughout the game. He is not an Igura participant and carries neither tags nor a weapon, despite the dangers in Toshima. He dresses very conservatively, which adds to his unsettling behavior. 182cm tall. Though he often appears in front of Akira, it is a mystery as to whether he is a friend or foe. Nano's blood is the source of Line. His real name is Nicole Premier.

;{{nihongo|Tomoyuki|トモユキ}}
:{{Anime voice|[[Yuichi Nakamura (voice actor)|Yuichi Nakamura]]}}
:A long-haired man participating in Igura. Though he seems to know Rin, they are not on very good terms with each other.

;{{nihongo|Kazui|カズイ}}
:{{Anime voice|[[Daisuke Hirakawa]]}}
:A black-haired man somehow connected to Rin and Tomoyuki who seems to resemble someone else Rin knows.

;{{nihongo|Touya|トウヤ|Tōya}}
:{{Anime voice|[[Kentarou Itō]]}}
:A young blond man participating in Igura with a team. He is his team's leader. Yukihito is one of his team members.

;{{nihongo|Yukihito|ユキヒト}}
:{{Anime voice|[[Hiroshi Kamiya]]}}
:A red-haired man in his 20s and new character added to "Togainu no Chi: True Blood", the Playstation 2 version of the game. He is a former Bl@ster participant (from AREA: RUDE) who is currently participating in Igura as a member of Touya's team.

He's awakened from sleep when a group of police break into his room and pin the blame for a recent murder on him, a crime which carries a sentence of life imprisonment. With no way to defend himself against the charges, Akira waits in fear for his life. He's visited in jail by a woman named Emma who offers him the only alternative to a life spent in captivity - join a higher-stakes fighting competition, and defeat the man at the top. Faced with no other option, Akira gathers his things and leaves for the city of Toshima, where the Igura competition is held. He has nothing more than the clothes on his back and the dog tags that peg him as a participant, so when some thugs show up to harass him and take a hit of a drug giving them super powers, he has little recourse. He's only saved by a man dressed in black, who brutally murders his attackers with his sword. The man threatens Akira as well, only letting him leave with his life when Akira shows too much pride to beg for his life.

[[File:Light Painting Urbex.jpg|thumb|300px| [[Light painting]] inside an abandoned limestone quarry in [[France]].]]
'''Urban exploration''' (often shortened as '''UE''', '''urbex''' and sometimes known as '''roof-and-tunnel hacking''') is the exploration of man-made structures, usually abandoned ruins or not usually seen components of the man-made environment. Photography and historical interest/documentation are heavily featured in the hobby and, although it may sometimes involve trespassing onto private property, this is not always the case.&lt;ref name="SFGATE_062008"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Art of Urban Exploration|last=Nestor|first=James|date=19 August 2007|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=20 June 2008|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/08/19/CMA4QVBMQ.DTL}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=May 2017}} Urban exploration may also be referred to as '''draining''' (an alternate form of urban exploring where drains are explored), '''urban spelunking''', '''urban rock climbing''', '''urban caving''', or '''building hacking'''.

The nature of this activity presents various risks, including both physical danger and, if done illegally and/or without permission, the possibility of arrest and punishment. Some activities associated with urban exploration violate local or regional laws and certain broadly interpreted [[Anti-terrorism legislation|anti-terrorism laws]], or can be considered [[trespass]]ing or invasion of privacy.&lt;ref name="trespassingUE_93009"&gt;{{cite news|title=Complete Guide to Urban Exploration|last=Haeber|first=Jonathan|date=21 December 2008|publisher=Bearings|accessdate=30 September 2009|url=http://www.terrastories.com/bearings/urban-exploration-guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exploration sites==
[[File:Urban Explorer in the entrance of technical gallery.jpg|thumb|Urban explorers at the entrance of a technical gallery under construction in Paris, France]]

===Abandonments===
{{redirect|Haikyo|the talent agency|Tokyo Actor's Consumer's Cooperative Society}}
[[File:Thomas Bresson - Fort du Salbert-8 (by).JPG|thumb|Abandoned Salbert fortifications]]
Ventures into abandoned structures are perhaps the most common example of urban exploration. At times, sites are entered first by locals and may suffer from large amounts of [[graffiti]] and other acts of [[vandalism]], while other locations may be better preserved. Although targets of exploration vary from one country to another, high-profile abandonments include [[List of abandoned amusement parks|amusement parks]], [[grain elevator]]s, [[factories]], [[power plants]], [[missile silo]]s, [[fallout shelters]], [[hospital]]s, [[Psychiatric hospital|asylums]], [[schools]], [[poor houses]], and [[sanatorium]]s.

In Japan, abandoned infrastructure is known as {{nihongo3||廃虚|haikyo}} (literally "ruins"), but the term is synonymous with the practice of urban exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Michael | last = Gakuran | title = The Hazards of Haikyo and Urban Exploration | url = http://gakuran.com/the-hazards-of-haikyo-and-urban-exploration/ | accessdate = 2011-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{nihongo3|||Haikyo}} are particularly common in Japan because of its rapid industrialization (e.g., [[Hashima Island]]), damage during [[World War II]], the [[Japanese asset price bubble|1980s real estate bubble]], and the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyoweekender.com/2010/05/haikyo-abandoned-treasure/|title=Haikyo: Abandoned Treasure|work=Weekender|date=May 2010|accessdate=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many explorers find decay of uninhabited space to be profoundly beautiful, and some are also proficient [[Photographer|freelance photographers]] who document what they see, as is the case with those who document some of the [[infrastructure]] of the former [[USSR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shevchenko|first=Vitaly|title=The urban explorers of the ex-USSR|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-26018424|accessdate=12 February 2014|publisher=BBC|date=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abandoned sites are also popular among [[historians]], [[Historic preservation|preservationists]], [[architects]], [[archaeologists]], [[Industrial Archaeology|industrial archaeologists]], and [[ghost hunting|ghost hunters]].

===Active buildings===
Another aspect of urban exploration is the practice of exploring active or ''in use'' buildings which includes gaining access, by various means, to secured or "member-only" areas, mechanical rooms, roofs, elevator rooms, abandoned floors, and other normally unseen parts of working buildings. The term "infiltration" is often associated with the exploration of active structures. People entering restricted areas may be committing [[trespass]], and [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] [[prosecution]] may result.

===Catacombs===
[[File:Catacombes de Paris.jpg|thumb|Catacombs (France)]]
[[Catacombs]] such as those found in [[Catacombs of Paris|Paris]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map|url=https://www.pdf-maps.com/maps/105662/paris-underground-map/|title=Paris Underground Map|publisher=Michel-Eugène Lefébure de Fourcy|year=1841}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catacombs of Rome|Rome]], [[Odessa Catacombs|Odessa]], and [[Catacombs of San Gennaro|Naples]] have been investigated by urban explorers. The [[Mines of Paris]], comprising much of the underground tunnels that are not open to public tourism like the catacombs, have been considered the "[[Holy Grail]]" by some due to their extensive nature and history. Explorers of these spaces are known as [[cataphile]]s.

===Sewers and storm drains===
[[File:St Paul storm drain.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Storm drain outfall in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]]]
Entry into [[storm drain]]s, or "draining", is another common form of urban exploration. Groups devoted to the task have arisen, such as the [[Cave Clan]] in [[Australia]]. Draining has a specialized set of guidelines, the foremost of which is "When it rains, no drains!" The dangers of becoming entrapped, washed away, or killed increase dramatically during a heavy rainfall.

A small subset of explorers enter [[sanitary sewer]]s. Sometimes they are the only connection to caves or other subterranean features. Sewers are among the most dangerous locations to explore owing to risk of poisoning by buildups of toxic gas (commonly [[methane]] and [[hydrogen sulfide]]).

===Transit tunnels===
[[File:DPS-01 and AS1A in D6 tunnel.jpg|thumb|right|Diesel trains in a tunnel of [[Metro-2]] D6 line in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]]]
Exploring active and abandoned subway and underground railway tunnels, bores, and [[Ghost station|stations]] is often considered to be trespassing and can result in civil prosecution, due to security concerns. As a result, this type of exploration is rarely publicized. An important exception to this is the abandoned [[Rochester Industrial and Rapid Transit Railway|subway of Rochester, New York]], the only American city to have an abandoned, formerly used, subway system. The [[Cincinnati subway]] is also abandoned, but was never completed and placed into service.

===Utility tunnels===
{{main article|Utility tunnel}}
[[File:Schiffbau tunnel.jpg|thumb|[[Utility tunnel]] in the center of [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]]]]

[[University|Universities]], and other large institutions such as hospitals, often distribute hazardous [[superheated steam]] for heating or cooling buildings from a [[district heating|central heating plant]]. These pipes are generally run through utility tunnels, which are often intended to be accessible solely for the purposes of maintenance. Nevertheless, many of these steam tunnels, especially those on college campuses, often also have a tradition of exploration by students. This practice was once called "vadding" at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], though students there now refer to it as [[roof and tunnel hacking]].

Some steam tunnels have dirt floors, poor lighting and temperatures upwards of {{convert|45|C|F}}. Others have concrete floors, bright light, and more moderate temperatures. Most steam tunnels have large intake fans to bring in fresh air and push the hot air out the back, and these fans may start without warning.  Most active steam tunnels do not contain airborne [[asbestos]], but proper breathing protection may be required for other respiratory hazards. Experienced explorers are very cautious inside active utility tunnels, since pipes can spew boiling hot water or steam from leaky valves or pressure relief blowoffs.  Frequently there are puddles of muddy water on the floor, making slips and falls a special concern near hot pipes.

Steam tunnels have generally been secured more heavily in recent years, due to their frequent use for carrying communications network backbone cables,  increased safety and liability concerns, and perceived risk of their use in terrorist activities.

==Popularity==
The rise in the popularity of urban exploration can be attributed to its increased media attention. Recent television shows, such as ''Urban Explorers'' on the [[Discovery Channel]], ''[[MTV's Fear]]'', and the ''[[Ghost Hunting]]'' exploits of [[The Atlantic Paranormal Society]] have packaged the hobby for a popular audience.  The fictional film ''[[After... (film)|After...]]'' (2006), a hallucinatory thriller set in Moscow's underground subways, features urban explorers caught up in extreme situations. Talks and exhibits on urban exploration have appeared at the fifth and sixth [[Hackers on Planet Earth]] Conference, complementing numerous newspaper articles and interviews.

Another source of popular information is ''[[Cities of the Underworld]]'', a documentary series which ran for three seasons on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]], starting in 2007.  This series roamed around the world, showing little-known underground structures in remote locales, as well as right under the feet of densely packed city-dwellers.

In April 2014, an article was posted by [[BuzzFeed|Buzzfeed]] on abandoned malls across the United States, which featured works by Cleveland-based photographer Johnny Joo among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/completely-surreal-pictures-of-americas-abandoned-malls|title=Completely Surreal Photos Of America's Abandoned Malls|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article rose to over 2 million views overnight, and could most likely be cited as one that brought attention of urban exploration and abandoned places more to the public eye.

With the rise in the relative popularity of the hobby due to this increased focus, there has been increasing discussion on whether the extra attention has been beneficial to urban exploration as a whole. The unspoken rule of urban exploring is "take nothing but photographs, leave nothing but footprints", but because of the rising popularity, many individuals who may have other intentions are creating a concern among many property owners.

== Safety and legality ==
[[File:Hill 60 illowra battery port kembla.jpg|thumb|[[Illowra Battery|Hill 60 bunker]]. On the right is a corridor leading to the bunker complex and on the left is the "mushroom tunnel".]]
Urban exploration is a hobby that comes with a number of inherent dangers. For example, [[storm drains]] are not designed with human access as their primary use. They can be subject to [[flash flood]]ing and bad air. There have been a number of deaths in storm water drains, but these are usually during floods, and the victims are normally not urban explorers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boy, 14, drowns in drain during heavy rains|date=4 June 2007|publisher=GNA|accessdate=9 August 2008|url=http://www.modernghana.com/news/137140/1/boy-14-drowns-in-drain-during-heavy-rains.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many old abandoned structures feature hazards such as unstable structures, unsafe floors, broken glass, the presence of unknown chemicals and other harmful substances (most notably [[asbestos]]), [[stray voltage]], and entrapment hazards.  Other risks include freely roaming [[guard dog]]s and hostile [[squatter]]s. Some abandoned locations may be heavily guarded with [[motion detector]]s and active security patrols, while others are more easily accessible and carry less risk of discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Abandoned beauties: Urban explorers find adventure in ruins of old buildings|date=5 December 2004|last=Owen |first=Mary|work=[[U-T San Diego]]|accessdate=27 July 2009|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20041205/news_mz1h5abandon.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Asbestos]] is a long-term health risk for urban explorers, along with breathing in contaminants from dried [[guano|bird feces]], which can cause a condition known as [[Bird fancier's lung|pigeon-breeder's lung]], a form of [[hypersensitivity pneumonitis]]. Urban explorers may use dust masks and [[respirator]]s to alleviate this danger. Some sites are occasionally used by substance abusers for either recreation or waste disposal, and there may be used or infected [[hypodermic syringe|syringe needles]] en route, such as those commonly used with [[heroin]].

The growing popularity of the activity has resulted not just in increased attention from explorers, but also from vandals and law enforcement. The illicit aspects of urban exploring, which may include [[trespassing]] and [[burglary|breaking and entering]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/tyne/content/articles/2008/08/19/urban_explorer_feature.shtml |title=Urban exploration - Richard Shepherd photographs derelict buildings in the North East and further afield. |publisher=BBC Tyne, Broadcasting Centre |date=2008-08-20 |accessdate=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; have brought along with them critical articles in mainstream newspapers.&lt;ref name="PPG_062008"&gt;{{cite news|title=Urban explorers dare to investigate seldom-seen Pittsburgh sites|date=7 September 2003|last=Batz Jr.|first=Bob|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|accessdate=20 June 2008|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/lifestyle/20030907explore0907fnp1.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]], the website of the Sydney [[Cave Clan]] was shut down by lawyers for the Roads and Traffic Authority of [[New South Wales]], after they raised concerns that the portal could "risk human safety and threaten the security of its infrastructure".&lt;ref name="PPG_062008"/&gt; Another website belonging to the Bangor Explorers Guild was criticized by the [[Maine State Police]] for potentially encouraging behavior that "could get someone hurt or killed".&lt;ref name="PPG_062008"/&gt; The [[Toronto Transit Commission]] has used the Internet to crimp subway tunnel explorations, going as far as to send investigators to various explorers' homes.&lt;ref name="PPG_062008"/&gt;

[[Ninjalicious|Jeff Chapman]], who authored ''Infiltration'', stated that genuine urban explorers "never vandalize, steal or damage anything". The thrill comes from that of "discovery and a few nice pictures".&lt;ref name="PPG_062008"/&gt; Some explorers will also request permission for entry in advance.&lt;ref name="legal"&gt;{{cite news|title=Legal Urban Exploration: 7 Tips for Visiting Historical Abandonments|last=Ebaster|first=Al|date=19 September 2007|publisher=[[Web Urbanist]]|url=http://weburbanist.com/2007/09/19/legal-urban-exploration-7-tips-for-visiting-historical-abandonments/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rooftopping==
{{main|Rooftopping}}
[[File:Spidermanhk.jpg|thumb|right|Rooftopping in [[Hong Kong]]]]
"Rooftopping" refers to the ascent of rooftops, cranes, antennas, smokestacks, etc., usually illegally, and for the purpose of getting an [[Epinephrine#Society and culture|adrenaline rush]] and taking [[selfie|selfie photos or videos]] and panoramic photographs of the scene below.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Meet the rooftoppers: the urban outlaws who risk everything to summit our cities | url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/feb/17/rooftoppers-urban-explorers-risk-photographs-skyscrapers-bradley-garrett | work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is chiefly an undertaking of [[millennials]] seeking social-media exposure, and has been especially popular in [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Ash, [https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-39353851/ Article in "BBC News" March 23, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Photographic documentation==
Many urban explorers adhere to the philosophy of cave explorers and outdoors hikers: "Take nothing but pictures. Leave nothing but footprints."&lt;ref name=TQP&gt;{{cite web|title=Motto of the Baltimore Grotto (caving society)|url=http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/4920.html|work=The Quotations Page|publisher=QuotationsPage.com|accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some are photographers who specialize in documenting urban ruins and scenes of industrial decay.  Professional photographers working in this field include [[Julia Solis]], [[Rebecca Lilith Bathory]] Johnny Joo and Andrew L. Moore. Other well-known photographers, such as [[Jan Saudek]], use the interiors of abandoned buildings as backdrops for their figurative and portrait works.

== Methods and technology ==
Some urban explorers use head-cams&lt;!--[[action camera]]s--&gt; such as [[GoPro]] or other [[helmet camera]]s for videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Don’t look down!
