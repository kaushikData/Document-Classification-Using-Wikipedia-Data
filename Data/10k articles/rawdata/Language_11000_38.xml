'''Aghostinho Fernandes''' (born [[Quepem]], [[Goa]] 2 July 1932, died Portugal 29 June 2015) was the author of one of [[Goa|Goa's]] key post-colonial novels, ''Bodki'', which has attracted significant critical attention.

==Biography==

Fernandes studied at the [[Liceu Nacional Afonso de Albuquerque]] before matriculating at the [[Escola Médica Cirúrgica de Goa]]; he considered working in Goa but won a place at the [[Universidade de Coimbra]] to develop his medical training. His first job (1960–62) was directing the campaign against [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] in [[Angola]]. He returned to Portugal and from 1974 to 1982 was a cardiologist at [[Centro Hospitalar das Caldas da Rainha]], as well as working in other hospitals such as the [[Hospital de Santa Maria, Lisbon]]. He was a Member of [[Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia]] and the [[European Society of Cardiology]]. He was the brother of [[John Claro Fernandes]], who became a noted [[Tiatr]] writer and director.&lt;ref&gt;Maria de Lourdes Bravo da Costa Rodrigues, 'Agostinho Fernandes: The forgotten man of letters', ''Navhind Times'', 5 July 2015, http://www.navhindtimes.in/agostinho-fernandes-the-forgotten-man-of-letters/.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

Fernandes's most famous work is the Portuguese-language novel ''Bodki'' (1962). In the words of Everton V. Machado,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The constant clash between modern convictions of the elite raised in a Christian environment and the popular beliefs among the lower social strata of Goa must be re-emphasized within the set of Indo-Portuguese themes, as is very clearly illustrated in the novel ''Bodki'' ... In it, a young physician from the capital finds himself confronting the superstitions of the people of a village, especially those who marginalize the ''bodki'', a Hindu widow, considered to be responsible for all the bad happenings that took place there.&lt;ref&gt;Everton V. Machado, 'Indo-Portuguese Literature and the Goa of its Writers', in ''The making of the Luso-Asian world: Intricacies of Engagement'', ed. by Laura Jarnagin, Portuguese and Luso-Asian Legacies in Southeast Asia, 1511-2011, 1 (Singapore: Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, 2011), pp. 229-38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fernandes was involved in journalism in Goa, Angola and Portugal;&lt;ref&gt;Maria de Lourdes Bravo da Costa Rodrigues, 'Agostinho Fernandes: The forgotten man of letters', ''Navhind Times'', 5 July 2015, http://www.navhindtimes.in/agostinho-fernandes-the-forgotten-man-of-letters/.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote a number of unpublished plays in Konkani; and the poetry collection ''Os Meus proprios pedaços''.&lt;ref&gt;COSTA, Aleixo Manuel da. Dicionário de literatura goesa. Instituto Cultural de Macau, Fundação Oriente, 3 v., 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote the novel ''Por além do além'', published in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Agostinho Fernandes, ''Por além do além'' (Goa: Third Millennium; Editora Terceiro Milénio, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexandra Gripenberg''', also known as '''Alexandra van Grippenberg''', (30 August 1857, [[Lakhdenpokhsky District|Kurkijoki]], [[Finland]] - 24 December 1913) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] social activist, author, editor, newspaper publisher, and elected politician, and was a leading voice within the movement for women's rights in Finland at the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Wayne&gt;{{cite book|last=Wayne|first=Tiffany K.|title=Feminist writings from ancient times to the modern world a global sourcebook and history|publisher=Greenwood|location=Santa Barbara|isbn=0313345813|pages=384–385}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was also known as a [[Fennoman]].

She founded the first official women's rights organization in Finland, the [[Suomen Naisyhdistys]] (Finnish Women's Association), in [[Helsinki]] in 1884. Between 1887–1888, she traveled in England and the United States, to study lessons from the women's movements of those countries. The tour inspired her book ''A Half Year in the New World'' (1889). She served as the treasurer of the [[International Council of Women]] from 1893–1899.

When Finland granted [[women's suffrage]] in 1906 Gripenberg was one of the ten female conservatives elected, along with nine other women belonging to the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic Party]], making her one of the first women to get elected into the [[Parliament of Finland]]. She was elected through the conservative [[Finnish Party]], which proved somewhat difficult for her at times as she was [[Swedish-speaking Finns|Swedish-speaking]] and the party was Finnish-speaking with strong grass roots support in the Finnish countryside.

'''Ambiguity''' is a type of [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] in which several interpretations are [[wikt:plausible#Adjective|plausible]]. A common aspect of ambiguity is [[uncertainty]]. It is thus an attribute of any idea or statement whose [[intention|intended]] meaning cannot be definitively resolved according to a rule or process with a finite number of steps. (The ''[[wikt:ambi-#Prefix|ambi]]-'' part of the [[Terminology|term]] reflects an idea of "[[2 (number)|two]]", as in "two meanings".)

The concept of ambiguity is generally contrasted with [[vagueness]]. In ambiguity, specific and distinct interpretations are permitted (although some may not be immediately obvious), whereas with information that is vague, it is difficult to form any interpretation at the desired level of specificity.

Context may play a role in resolving ambiguity. For example, the same piece of information may be ambiguous in one context and unambiguous in another.

== Linguistic forms ==
[[File:Structural analysis of an ambiguous spanish sentence.svg|thumb|Structural analysis of an ambiguous Spanish sentence:&lt;br /&gt; '''Pepe vio a Pablo enfurecido'''&lt;br /&gt;Interpretation 1: When Pepe was angry, then he saw Pablo&lt;br /&gt;Interpretation 2: Pepe saw that Pablo was angry.&lt;br /&gt;Here, the syntactic tree in figure represents interpretation 2.]]

The [[Polysemy|lexical ambiguity]] of a word or phrase pertains to its having more than one meaning in the language to which the word belongs. "Meaning" here refers to whatever should be captured by a good dictionary. For instance, the word "bank" has several distinct lexical definitions, including "[[Bank|financial institution]]" and "[[Bank (geography)|edge of a river]]". Or consider  "[[apothecary]]". One could say "I bought herbs from the apothecary". This could mean one actually spoke to the apothecary ([[pharmacist]]) or went to the apothecary ([[pharmacy]]).

The context in which an ambiguous word is used often makes it evident which of the meanings is intended. If, for instance, someone says "I buried $100 in the bank", most people would not think someone used a shovel to dig in the mud. However, some linguistic contexts do not provide sufficient information to disambiguate a used word.

Lexical ambiguity can be addressed by algorithmic methods that automatically associate the appropriate meaning with a word in context, a task referred to as [[word sense disambiguation]].

The use of multi-defined words requires the author or speaker to clarify their context, and sometimes elaborate on their specific intended meaning (in which case, a less ambiguous term should have been used). The goal of clear concise communication is that the receiver(s) have no misunderstanding about what was meant to be conveyed. An exception to this could include a politician whose "[[weasel word]]s" and [[obfuscation]] are necessary to gain support from multiple [[Electoral district|constituents]] with [[mutually exclusive]] conflicting desires from their candidate of choice. Ambiguity is a powerful tool of [[political science]].

More problematic are words whose senses express closely related concepts. "Good", for example, can mean "useful" or "functional" (''That's a good hammer''), "exemplary" (''She's a good student''), "pleasing" (''This is good soup''), "moral" (''a good person'' versus ''the lesson to be learned from a story''), "[[righteous]]", etc. " I have a good daughter" is not clear about which sense is intended. The various ways to apply [[prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es can also create ambiguity ("unlockable" can mean "capable of being unlocked" or "impossible to lock").

[[Syntactic ambiguity]] arises when a sentence can have two (or more) different meanings because of the structure of the sentence—its syntax.  This is often due to a modifying expression, such as a prepositional phrase, the application of which is unclear. "He ate the cookies on the couch", for example, could mean that he ate those cookies that were on the couch (as opposed to those that were on the table), or it could mean that he was sitting on the couch when he ate the cookies.  "To get in, you will need an entrance fee of $10 or your voucher and your drivers' license."  This could mean that you need EITHER ten dollars OR BOTH your voucher and your license.  Or it could mean that you need your license AND you need EITHER ten dollars OR a voucher.  Only rewriting the sentence, or placing appropriate punctuation can resolve a syntactic ambiguity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Critical Thinking, 10th ed., Ch 3, Moore, Brooke N. and Parker, Richard.  McGraw-Hill, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
For the notion of, and theoretic results about, syntactic ambiguity in artificial, [[formal languages]] (such as computer [[programming language]]s), see [[Ambiguous grammar]].

[[Spoken language]] can contain many more types of ambiguities which are called phonological ambiguities, where there is more than one way to compose a set of sounds into words. For example, "ice cream" and "I scream". Such ambiguity is generally resolved according to the context. A mishearing of such, based on incorrectly resolved ambiguity, is called a [[mondegreen]].

[[Semantic ambiguity]] happens when a sentence contains an ambiguous word or phrase—a word or phrase that has more than one meaning.   In "We saw her duck" (example due to Richard Nordquist), the word "duck" can refer either
# to the person's bird (the noun "duck", modified by the possessive pronoun "her"), or
# to a motion she made (the verb "duck", the subject of which is the objective pronoun "her", object of the verb "saw").&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Lexical ambiguity is contrasted with semantic ambiguity. The former represents a choice between a finite number of known and meaningful context-dependent interpretations. The latter represents a choice between any number of possible interpretations, none of which may have a standard agreed-upon meaning. This form of ambiguity is closely related to [[vagueness]].

Linguistic ambiguity [[Ambiguity (law)|can be a problem in law]], because the interpretation of written documents and oral agreements is often of paramount importance.

Philosophers (and other users of logic) spend a lot of time and effort searching for and removing (or intentionally adding) ambiguity in arguments because it can lead to incorrect conclusions and can be used to deliberately conceal bad arguments. For example, a politician might say, "I oppose taxes which hinder economic growth", an example of a glittering generality. Some will think he opposes taxes in general because they hinder economic growth. Others may think he opposes only those taxes that he believes will hinder economic growth. In writing, the sentence can be rewritten to reduce possible misinterpretation, either by adding a comma after "taxes" (to convey the first sense) or by changing "which" to "that" (to convey the second sense) or by rewriting it in other ways. The devious politician hopes that each constituent will interpret the statement in the most desirable way, and think the politician supports everyone's opinion. However, the opposite can also be true – an opponent can turn a positive statement into a bad one if the speaker uses ambiguity (intentionally or not). The logical fallacies of amphiboly and equivocation rely heavily on the use of ambiguous words and phrases.

In [[continental philosophy]] (particularly phenomenology and existentialism), there is much greater tolerance of ambiguity, as it is generally seen as an integral part of the human condition. [[Martin Heidegger]] argued that the relation between the subject and object is ambiguous, as is the relation of mind and body, and part and whole.[3] In Heidegger's phenomenology, Dasein is always in a meaningful world, but there is always an underlying background for every instance of signification. Thus, although some things may be certain, they have little to do with Dasein's sense of care and existential anxiety, e.g., in the face of death. In calling his work Being and Nothingness an "essay in phenomenological ontology" [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] follows Heidegger in defining the human essence as ambiguous, or relating fundamentally to such ambiguity. [[Simone de Beauvoir]] tries to base an ethics on Heidegger's and Sartre's writings (The Ethics of Ambiguity), where she highlights the need to grapple with ambiguity: "as long as philosophers and they [men] have thought, most of them have tried to mask it...And the ethics which they have proposed to their disciples have always pursued the same goal. It has been a matter of eliminating the ambiguity by making oneself pure inwardness or pure externality, by escaping from the sensible world or being engulfed by it, by yielding to eternity or enclosing oneself in the pure moment." Ethics cannot be based on the authoritative certainty given by mathematics and logic, or prescribed directly from the empirical findings of science. She states: "Since we do not succeed in fleeing it, let us, therefore, try to look the truth in the face. Let us try to assume our fundamental ambiguity. It is in the knowledge of the genuine conditions of our life that we must draw our strength to live and our reason for acting". Other continental philosophers suggest that concepts such as life, nature, and sex are ambiguous. Corey Anton has argued that we cannot be certain what is separate from or unified with something else: language, he asserts, divides what is not, in fact, separate. Following Ernest Becker, he argues that the desire to 'authoritatively disambiguate' the world and existence has led to numerous ideologies and historical events such as genocide. On this basis, he argues that ethics must focus on 'dialectically integrating opposites' and balancing tension, rather than seeking a priori validation or certainty. Like the existentialists and phenomenologists, he sees the ambiguity of life as the basis of creativity.

In literature and rhetoric, ambiguity can be a useful tool. Groucho Marx's classic joke depends on a grammatical ambiguity for its humor, for example: "Last night I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got in my pajamas, I'll never know". Songs and poetry often rely on ambiguous words for artistic effect, as in the song title "Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue" (where "blue" can refer to the color, or to sadness).

In the narrative, ambiguity can be introduced in several ways: motive, plot, character. [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] uses the latter type of ambiguity with notable effect in his novel ''The Great Gatsby''.

[[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]] employ the concept of paradox synonymously with 'ambiguity'. Many Christians and Jews endorse Rudolf Otto's description of the sacred as 'mysterium tremendum et fascinans', the awe-inspiring mystery which fascinates humans.[dubious – discuss] The orthodox Catholic writer G. K. Chesterton regularly employed paradox to tease out the meanings in common concepts which he found ambiguous or to reveal meaning often overlooked or forgotten in common phrases. (The title of one of his most famous books, Orthodoxy, itself employing such a paradox.)

Metonymy involves the use of the name of a subcomponent part as an abbreviation, or jargon, for the name of the whole object (for example "wheels" to refer to a car, or "flowers" to refer to beautiful offspring, an entire plant, or a collection of blooming plants). In modern vocabulary, critical semiotics,[9] metonymy encompasses any potentially ambiguous word substitution that is based on contextual contiguity (located close together), or a function or process that an object performs, such as "sweet ride" to refer to a nice car. Metonym miscommunication is considered a primary mechanism of linguistic humor.

== Music ==
In [[music]], pieces or sections which confound expectations and may be or are interpreted simultaneously in different ways are ambiguous, such as some [[polytonality]], [[polymeter]], other ambiguous [[metre|meters]] or [[rhythm]]s, and ambiguous [[phrase (music)|phrasing]], or (Stein 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;79) any [[aspect of music]]. The [[music of Africa]] is often purposely ambiguous. To quote [[Donald Francis Tovey|Sir Donald Francis Tovey]] (1935, p.&amp;nbsp;195), "Theorists are apt to vex themselves with vain efforts to remove uncertainty just where it has a high aesthetic value."

== Visual art ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
[[File:Necker cube.svg|The [[Necker cube]], an ambiguous image|thumb]]
In visual art, certain images are visually ambiguous, such as the [[Necker cube]], which can be interpreted in two ways. Perceptions of such objects remain stable for a time, then may flip, a phenomenon called [[multistable perception]].
The opposite of such ambiguous images are [[impossible object]]s.

Pictures or photographs may also be ambiguous at the semantic level: the visual image is unambiguous, but the meaning and narrative may be ambiguous: is a certain facial expression one of excitement or fear, for instance?

== Constructed language ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
Some [[Constructed language|languages have been created]] with the intention of avoiding ambiguity, especially [[Polysemy|lexical ambiguity]]. [[Lojban]] and [[Loglan]] are two related languages which have been created for this, focusing chiefly on syntactic ambiguity as well. The languages can be both spoken and written. These languages are intended to provide a greater technical precision over big natural languages, although historically, such attempts at language improvement have been criticized. Languages composed from many diverse sources contain much ambiguity and inconsistency. The many exceptions to [[syntax]] and [[semantic]] rules are time-consuming and difficult to learn.

== Computer science ==
In computer science, the [[SI prefix]]es [[kilo-]], [[mega-]] and [[giga-]] were historically used in certain contexts to mean either the first three powers of 1024 (1024, 1024&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 1024&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) contrary to the [[metric system]] in which these units unambiguously mean one thousand, one million, and one billion. This usage is particularly prevalent with electronic memory devices (e.g. [[DRAM]]) addressed directly by a binary machine register where a decimal interpretation makes no practical sense.

Subsequently, the Ki, Mi, and Gi prefixes were introduced so that [[metric prefix#Binary prefixes|binary prefixes]] could be written explicitly, also rendering k, M, and G ''unambiguous'' in texts conforming to the new standard — this led to a ''new'' ambiguity in engineering documents lacking outward trace of the binary prefixes (necessarily indicating the new style) as to whether the usage of k, M, and G remains ambiguous (old style) or not (new style). Note also that 1 M (where M is ambiguously 1,000,000 or 1,048,576) is ''less'' uncertain than the engineering value 1.0e6 (defined to designate the interval 950,000 to 1,050,000), and that as non-volatile storage devices began to commonly exceed 1 GB in capacity (where the ambiguity begins to routinely impact the second significant digit), GB and TB almost always mean 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; [[bytes]].

== Mathematical notation ==
[[Mathematical notation]], widely used in [[physics]] and other [[science]]s, avoids many ambiguities compared to expression in natural language. However, for various reasons, several [[Lexical (semiotics)|lexical]], [[syntactic]] and [[semantic]] ambiguities remain.

=== Names of functions ===
The '''ambiguity''' in the style of writing a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] should not be confused with a [[multivalued function]], which can (and should) be defined in a deterministic and unambiguous way. Several [[special function]]s still do not have established notations. Usually, the conversion to another notation requires to scale the argument or the resulting value; sometimes, the same name of the function is used, causing confusions. Examples of such underestablished functions:
* [[Sinc function]]
* [[Elliptic integral#Complete elliptic integral of the third kind|Elliptic integral of the third kind]]; translating elliptic integral form [[MAPLE]] to [[Mathematica]], one should replace the second argument to its square, see [[Talk:Elliptic integral#List of notations]]; dealing with complex values, this may cause problems.
* [[Exponential integral]]&lt;ref name="irene"&gt;{{cite book |first1=M. |last1=Abramovits |first2=I. |last2=Stegun |title=Handbook on mathematical functions |page= 228 |url=http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_228.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expressions ===
Ambiguous expressions often appear in physical and mathematical texts.
It is common practice to omit multiplication signs in mathematical expressions. Also, it is common to give the same name to a variable and a function, for example, &lt;math&gt;f=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Then, if one sees &lt;math&gt;f=f(y+1)&lt;/math&gt;, there is no way to distinguish whether it means &lt;math&gt;f=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; '''multiplied''' by &lt;math&gt;(y+1)&lt;/math&gt;, or function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; '''evaluated''' at argument equal to &lt;math&gt;(y+1)&lt;/math&gt;. In each case of use of such notations, the reader is supposed to be able to perform the deduction and reveal the true meaning.

Creators of algorithmic languages try to avoid ambiguities. Many algorithmic languages ([[C++]] and [[Fortran]]) require the character * as symbol of multiplication. The [[Wolfram Language]] used in [[Mathematica]] allows the user to omit the multiplication symbol, but requires square brackets to indicate the argument of a function; square brackets are not allowed for grouping of expressions. Fortran, in addition, does not allow use of the same name (identifier) for different objects, for example, function and variable; in particular, the expression '''f=f(x)''' is qualified as an error.

The order of operations may depend on the context. In most [[programming language]]s, the operations of division and multiplication have equal priority and are executed from left to right. Until the last century, many editorials assumed that multiplication is performed first, for example, &lt;math&gt;a/bc&lt;/math&gt; is interpreted as &lt;math&gt;a/(bc)&lt;/math&gt;; in this case, the insertion of parentheses is required when translating the formulas to an algorithmic language. In addition, it is common to write an argument of a function without parenthesis, which also may lead to ambiguity.
Sometimes, one uses ''italics'' letters to denote elementary functions.
In the [[scientific journal]] style, the expression
&lt;math&gt; s i n \alpha&lt;/math&gt;
means
product of variables
&lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, although in a slideshow, it may mean &lt;math&gt;\sin[\alpha]&lt;/math&gt;.

A comma in subscripts and superscripts sometimes is omitted; it is also ambiguous notation.
If it is written &lt;math&gt;T_{mnk}&lt;/math&gt;, the reader should guess from the context, does it mean a single-index object, evaluated while the subscript is equal to product of variables
&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, or it is indication to a trivalent tensor.
The writing of &lt;math&gt;T_{mnk}&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;T_{m,n,k}&lt;/math&gt; may mean that the writer either is stretched in space (for example, to reduce the publication fees) or aims to increase number of publications without considering readers. The same may apply to any other use of ambiguous notations.

Subscripts are also used to denote the argument to a function, as in &lt;math&gt;F_{x}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;!--
Some scientific journals use superscripts to indicate citations. If one cites reference number 6 about [[coherent addition of lasers]], the centenve may read as follows:
Practically, the number of lasers, which can be combined in such a way, does not exceed 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.
"Oh, this very powerful method allows for the combination of a million lasers,"
the reader may think. To avoid such ambiguity, [[citations]] in Wikipedia appear inside square bracket &lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;.
!--&gt;

=== Examples of potentially confusing ambiguous mathematical expressions ===
&lt;math&gt;\sin^2\alpha/2&lt;/math&gt;, which could be understood to mean either &lt;math&gt;(\sin(\alpha/2))^2&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(\sin(\alpha))^2/2&lt;/math&gt;. In addition, &lt;math&gt;\sin^2(x)&lt;/math&gt; may mean &lt;math&gt;\sin(\sin(x))&lt;/math&gt;, as &lt;math&gt;\exp^2(x)&lt;/math&gt; means &lt;math&gt;\exp(\exp(x))&lt;/math&gt; (see [[tetration]]).

&lt;math&gt;\sin^{-1}\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, which by convention means &lt;math&gt;\arcsin(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;, though it might be thought to mean &lt;math&gt;(\sin(\alpha))^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;\sin^{n} \alpha&lt;/math&gt; means &lt;math&gt;(\sin(\alpha))^{n}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;a/2b&lt;/math&gt;, which arguably should mean &lt;math&gt;(a/2)b&lt;/math&gt; but would commonly be understood to mean &lt;math&gt;a/(2b)&lt;/math&gt; .

=== Notations in quantum optics and quantum mechanics ===
It is common to define the [[coherent states]] in [[quantum optics]] with &lt;math&gt;~|\alpha\rangle~ &lt;/math&gt; and states with fixed number of photons with &lt;math&gt;~|n\rangle~&lt;/math&gt;. Then, there is an "unwritten rule": the state is coherent if there are more Greek characters than Latin characters in the argument, and &lt;math&gt;~n~&lt;/math&gt;photon state if the Latin characters dominate. The ambiguity becomes even worse, if &lt;math&gt;~|x\rangle~&lt;/math&gt; is used for the states with certain value of the coordinate, and &lt;math&gt;~|p\rangle~&lt;/math&gt; means the state with certain value of the momentum, which may be used in books on [[quantum mechanics]]. Such ambiguities easily lead to confusions, especially if some normalized [[adimensional]], [[dimensionless]] variables are used. Expression &lt;math&gt; |1\rangle &lt;/math&gt; may mean a state with single photon, or the coherent state with mean amplitude equal to 1, or state with momentum equal to unity, and so on. The reader is supposed to guess from the context.

=== Ambiguous terms in physics and mathematics ===
Some physical quantities do not yet have established notations; their value (and sometimes even [[dimension]], as in the case of the [[Einstein coefficients]]), depends on the system of notations. Many terms are ambiguous. Each use of an ambiguous term should be preceded by the definition, suitable for a specific case. Just like [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] states in [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]: "... Only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wittgenstein |first=Ludwig |title=Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus |page=39 |publisher=Dover Publications Inc. |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-486-40445-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A highly confusing term is ''gain''. For example, the sentence "the gain of a system should be doubled", without context, means close to nothing.&lt;br /&gt;
It may mean that the ratio of the output voltage of an electric circuit to the input voltage should be doubled.&lt;br /&gt;
It may mean that the ratio of the output power of an electric or optical circuit to the input power should be doubled.&lt;br /&gt;
It may mean that the gain of the laser medium should be doubled, for example, doubling the population of the upper laser level in a quasi-two level system (assuming negligible absorption of the ground-state).

The term ''intensity'' is ambiguous when applied to light. The term can refer to any of [[irradiance]], [[luminous intensity]], [[radiant intensity]], or [[radiance]], depending on the background of the person using the term.

Also, confusions may be related with the use of [[atomic percent]] as measure of concentration of a [[dopant]], or [[Optical resolution|resolution]] of an imaging system, as measure of the size of the smallest detail which still can be resolved at the background of statistical noise. See also [[Accuracy and precision]] and its talk.

The [[Berry paradox]] arises as a result of systematic ambiguity in the meaning of terms such as "definable" or "nameable". Terms of this kind give rise to [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious circle]] fallacies. Other terms with this type of ambiguity are: satisfiable, true, false, function, property, class, relation, cardinal, and ordinal.&lt;ref&gt;Russell/Whitehead, Principia Mathematica&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical interpretation of ambiguity ==
[[File:Necker cube and impossible cube.svg|The [[Necker cube]] and [[impossible cube]], an underdetermined and overdetermined object, respectively.|thumb]]
In mathematics and logic, ambiguity can be considered to be an instance of the logical concept of [[underdetermination]]—for example, &lt;math&gt;X=Y&lt;/math&gt; leaves open what the value of ''X'' is—while its opposite is a [[self-contradiction]], also called [[inconsistency]], [[paradoxicalness]], or [[oxymoron]], or in mathematics an [[inconsistent system]]—such as &lt;math&gt;X=2, X=3&lt;/math&gt;, which has no solution.

Logical ambiguity and self-contradiction is analogous to visual ambiguity and [[impossible object]]s, such as the Necker cube and impossible cube, or many of the drawings of [[M. C. Escher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Araona''' or '''Cavina''' is an indigenous language spoken by the [[South America]] [[Araona people]]; about 90% of the 90 Araona people are fluent (W. Adelaar). Use of the language amongst the tribe is considered vigorous although [[Spanish language|Spanish]] knowledge is increasing. The Araonans live in the headwaters of the Manupari river in northwest [[Bolivia]]. Their language has a dictionary and portions of the [[Bible]] have been translated into Araona.

Capachene and Machui are dialects of either Araona or of [[Cavineña language|Cavineña]].

==History==
The Araona people and their language were long ignored in the written, European-based historical traditions, long after the [[European colonization of the Americas|Conquest of the Americas]] and what is now Bolivia. The first written historical mention of the Araona people and their language comes from the Franciscan missionaries Manuel Mancini and Fidel Codenach in the late 1800s, were unable to found any sort of mission in this area of the La Paz department because of the conditions on the ground. The Araona were the most populous ethnic group in the region of Colonia Nacional, and where one of the many indigenous groups who were displaced from their villages and used as slaves for the rubber industry at the end of the 19th century. Those who managed to survive and escape from servitude went on to establish themselves in various settlements in the area between the Manorimi and Monopare Rivers. In 1965, Protestant Evangelical activists and missionaries from the ''[[SIL International|Instituto de Lingüístico Verano]]'' created a permanent settlement and cooperated with the Araona communities to establish links with other indigenous groups.

==Phonology==
The Araona [[phoneme|phonemic]] inventory consists of four vowels ({{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}), and 19 consonants.&lt;ref name=ijoal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Key|first1=Mary Ritchie|last2=Tugwell|first2=R.

[[File:Univac bit bucket.JPG|thumb|right|The chip receiver (or "bit bucket") from a UNIVAC key punch]]

In [[computing]] [[jargon]], the '''bit bucket''' is where lost [[computer]]ized data has gone, by any means; any [[data]] which does not end up where it is supposed to, being lost in [[transmission (telecom)|transmission]], a [[computer crash]], or the like, is said to have gone to the bit bucket &amp;mdash; that mysterious place on a computer where lost data goes, as in:

{{Quote|text=The errant byte, having failed the parity test, is unceremoniously dumped into the bit bucket, the computer's wastepaper basket.|sign=Erik Sandberg-Diment|source=''New York Times'', July 9, 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sandberg-Diment |first=Erik |date=July 9, 1985 |title=Parity: An Elegantly Simple Approach to Errors |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/09/science/personal-computing-parity-an-elegantly-simple-approach-to-errors.html |newspaper=New York Times |location=New York, N.Y. |publisher=New York Times Company |accessdate=8 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

== History ==
Originally, the bit bucket was the container on [[teleprinter|Teletype]] machines or [[IBM]] [[key punch]] machines into which [[chad (paper)|chad]] from the [[paper tape]] punch or [[punched card|card]] punch was deposited;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cutler |first=Donald I. |year=1964 |title=Introduction to Computer Programming |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8ecmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=bucket |location= |publisher=Prentice-Hall |page=108 |isbn= |accessdate=8 November 2013 |quote=The lost bits fall into a container called a bit bucket. They are emptied periodically and the collected bits are used for confetti at weddings, parties, and other festive occasions. }}&lt;/ref&gt; the formal name is "chad box" or (at IBM) "chip box".

The term was then generalized into any place where useless bits go, a useful computing concept known as the [[null device]].

'''Brownfield land''' is a term used in [[urban planning]] to describe any previously developed land that is not currently in use, whether contaminated or not or, in North America, more specifically to describe [[real property|land]] previously used for [[industry|industrial]] or commercial purposes with known or suspected [[pollution]] including [[soil contamination]] due to [[hazardous waste]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tang|first1=Yu-Ting|last2=Nathanail|first2=C.

== Definition ==
===Canada===
Environment Canada defines brownfields as "abandoned, idle or underutilized commercial or industrial properties [typically located in urban areas] where past actions have caused environmental contamination, but which still have potential for redevelopment or other economic opportunities."&lt;ref name="fcsp"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.federalcontaminatedsites.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=E79BE042-1 |title=About the Sites |date=2016-10-03 |publisher=Federal Contaminated Sites Portal, Environment Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===

The term ''brownfields'' first came into use on June 28, 1992, at a [[United States Congress|U.S. congressional]] field hearing hosted by the Northeast Midwest Congressional Coalition. Also in 1992, the first detailed policy analysis of the issue was convened by the [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga County]] Planning Commission. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] selected Cuyahoga County as its first brownfield pilot project in September 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=October 2006 | title=Brownfields Program Achievements Linked to Early Success | pages=1–3 | url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Adobe/PDF/P100829D.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] | accessdate=2012-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term applies more generally to previously used land or to sections of industrial or commercial facilities that are to be upgraded.&lt;ref name="tandfonline5"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3846/16486897.2012.659030#.UkWNLm3WhDQ |vauthors=Maliene V, Wignall L, Malys N |title=Brownfield Regeneration: Waterfront Site Developments in Liverpool and Cologne |journal=Journal of Environmental Engineering and Landscape Management |volume=20 |issue= 1 |pages= 5–16 |year= 2012 |doi= 10.3846/16486897.2012.659030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brownfield land is an area of land previously used or built upon, as opposed to [[greenfield land]], which has never been built upon.{{citation needed||date=February 2017}} It is a term used in [[urban planning]] to describe [[real property|land]] within certain legal exclusions and additions, which was previously used for [[industry|industrial]] or commercial purposes, where its expansion, redevelopment or reuse may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant or contaminant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brownfieldscenter.org/glossary.cfm#b |format=URL|publisher=Environmental Law Institute|title=Glossary of Brownfields Terms|accessdate=2015-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.cabernet.org.uk/resourcefs/427.pdf|title=Sustainable Brownfield Regeneration|work=Concerted Action on Brownfield and Economic Regeneration Network|publisher=University of Nottingham|year=2006|isbn=0-9547474-5-3|p=3|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402092802/http://www.cabernet.org.uk/resourcefs/427.pdf|archivedate=2015-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Land that is more severely contaminated and has high concentrations of hazardous waste or pollution, such as a [[Superfund]] site, does not fall under the brownfield classification.{{citation needed||date=February 2017}} ''Mothballed brownfields'' are properties that the owners are not willing to transfer or put to productive reuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/brownfields/success/showcase/sc_milwauke.htm |format=URL |publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|title=Brownfields Showcase Community Fact Sheet|accessdate=2009-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=February 2017}}

Brownfield status is a legal designation which places restrictions, conditions or incentives on redevelopment and use on the site.{{citation needed||date=February 2017}}

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, the term 'brownfield' has a colloquial meaning roughly equivalent to the American usage described above, i.e. vacant or derelict land or property, usually industrial in nature. In terms of [[Town and country planning in the United Kingdom|British Town and Country Planning]], however, the meaning of 'brownfield' is more complex, and is often conflated with the technical term 'previously developed land' (PDL). PDL was originally defined in planning policy for housing development in England and Wales, and was carefully distinguished in such policy from 'brownfield', which was undefined but considered to be different.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.housinglin.org.uk/_library/Resources/Housing/Policy_documents/PPS3.pdf Planning Policy Statement 3: Housing] June 2000. 29pp, Department for Communities and Local Government, Crown Copyright {{ISBN|011 753976 7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26}} The definition from the 2012 National Planning Policy Guidance, which only applies to England, uses the terms 'brownfield' and 'previously developed land' interchangeably:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-planning-policy-framework--2 National Planning Policy Framework] 2012, 65 pp, Department for Communities and Local Government, {{ISBN|9781409834137}},&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
"Land which is or was occupied by a permanent structure, including the curtilage of the developed land (although it should not be assumed that the whole of the curtilage should be developed) and any associated fixed surface infrastructure. This excludes: 
* land that is or has been occupied by agricultural or forestry buildings;
* land that has been developed for [[minerals extraction]] ([[mining]]) or waste disposal by landfill purposes where provision for restoration has been made through development control procedures; 
* land in built-up areas such as private residential gardens, parks, recreation grounds and allotments; and
* land that was previously-developed but where the remains of the permanent structure or fixed surface structure have blended into the landscape in the process of time."

==Locations and contaminants==
Generally, brownfield sites exist in a city's or town's industrial section, on locations with abandoned [[factory|factories]] or commercial buildings, or other previously polluting operations like steel mills, refineries or landfills.&lt;ref name="contamin"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/contaminated-land/overview |title=Contaminated land -Overview |date=10 November 2016 |publisher=Crown Copyright  |location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Small brownfields also may be found in older residential neighborhoods, as for example [[dry cleaning]] establishments or [[gas station]]s produced high levels of subsurface contaminants.

Typical contaminants found on contaminated brownfield land include [[hydrocarbon]] spillages, [[solvent]]s, [[pesticide]]s, heavy metals such as [[lead]] (e.g., paints), [[tributyl tin]]s, and [[asbestos]].&lt;ref name="contamin" /&gt;  Old maps may assist in identifying areas to be tested.

==Brownfield status by country==
The primary issue facing all nations involved in attracting and sustaining new uses to brownfield sites is that industries are globally oriented and respond to global market forces.{{citation needed||date=February 2017}} This directly affects brownfield reuse, such as limiting the effective economic life of the use on the revitalized sites.{{citation needed||date=February 2017}}

===United States===
[[United States]] estimates suggest there are over 500,000 brownfield sites contaminated at levels below the [[Superfund]] caliber (the most contaminated) in the country.{{citation needed||date=February 2017}} While historic land use patterns created contaminated sites, the Superfund law has been criticized as creating the ''brownfield phenomenon'' where investment moves to greenfields for new development due to severe, no-fault liability schemes and other disincentives.{{citation needed||date=February 2017}} The Clinton-Gore administration and US [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] launched a series of brownfield policies and programs in 1993 to tackle this problem.{{citation needed||date=February 2017}}

===Canada===
[[Canada]] has an estimated 200,000 "contaminated sites" across the nation.{{citation needed||date=February 2017}} {{As of|2016}} Canada had about 23,078 federally contaminated sites, from abandoned mines, to airports, lighthouse stations, and military bases, which are classified into N 1,2,or 3, depending on a score of contamination, with 5,300 active contaminated sites, 2,300 suspected sites and 15,000 listed as closed because remediated or no action was necessary.&lt;ref name="inventory"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.federalcontaminatedsites.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=D510E7A9-1 |title=Inventory of Sites-How many federal contaminated sites are there in Canada? |date= 2016-10-03 |publisher=Federal Contaminated Sites Portal, Environment Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The provincial governments have primary responsibility for brownfields.{{citation needed||date=February 2017}} The provinces´ legal mechanisms for managing risk are limited, as there are no tools such as "No Further Action" letters to give property owners finality and certainty in the cleanup and reuse process.{{citation needed||date=February 2017}} Yet, Canada has cleaned up sites and attracted investment to contaminated lands such as the [[Moncton]] rail yards.{{citation needed||date=February 2017}} A strip of the Texaco lands in Mississauga is slated to be part of the [[Waterfront Trail]].{{citation needed||date=February 2017}} However, Imperial Oil has no plans to sell the {{convert|75|acre|adj=on}} property which has been vacant since the 1980s.

According to their 2014 report on federally contaminated sites, the Parliamentary Budget Officer estimated that the "total liability for remediating Canada’s contaminated sites reported in the public accounts [was] $4.9 billion."&lt;ref name="Canada 2014" /&gt;{{rp|1}} The report listed significant sites called the Big Five with a liability of $1.8 billion: [[Faro, Yukon|Faro mine]], [[Colomac Mine]], [[Giant Mine]], [[North Warning System|Cape Dyer-DEW line]] and [[CFB Goose Bay|Goose Bay Air Base]]. The [[Port Hope, Ontario]] site has a liability of $1 billion.&lt;ref name="Canada 2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pbo-dpb.gc.ca/files/files/Federal%20Contaminated%20Sites%20Cost%20EN.pdf | title=Federal Contaminated Sites Cost | work=Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) | date=10 April 2014 | accessdate=5 September 2015 | author=Rod Story, Tolga Yalkin | pages=41 | location=Ottawa, Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt; Port Hope has the largest volume of historic low-level [[radioactive]] wastes in Canada, resulting from "radium and uranium processing in Port Hope between 1933 and 1988 by the former Crown corporation [[Eldorado Mining and Refining Limited|Eldorado Nuclear Limited]] and its private sector predecessors.&lt;ref name="Port Hope 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.llrwmo.org/en/porthope/index.html |title=Port Hope Area Initiative |accessdate=January 13, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820223713/http://www.llrwmo.org/en/porthope/index.html |archivedate=August 20, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010 it was projected that it would cost well over a billion dollars for the soil remediation project, it was the largest such cleanup in Canadian history. The effort is projected to be complete in 2022.&lt;ref name="Port_Hope_cleanup"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/ontario/2014/01/13/port_hope_properties_tested_for_radiation.html|title=Port Hope properties tested for radiation|accessdate=January 14, 2013 |author=Carola Vyhnak|date=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015 the $86,847,474 contract "to relocate the historic low-level radioactive waste and marginally contaminated soils from an existing waste management facility on the shoreline of Lake Ontario to the new, state-of-the-art facility about a kilometre north of the current site." was undertaken.&lt;ref name="Port Hope 2015"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=1011739 | title=Contracts Awarded for Port Hope Area Initiative | work=Natural Resources Canada | date=30 July 2015 | accessdate=5 September 2015 |location=Ottawa, Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also "$1.8 billion for general inventory sites" and "$200 million for other sites."&lt;ref name="Canada 2014" /&gt;{{rp|1}} The same report claimed the inventory currently lists 24,990 contaminated sites."
 
The federal government exercises some control over environmental protection, the "provincial and territorial governments issue the bulk of legislation regarding
contaminated sites."&lt;ref name="Canada 2014" /&gt;{{rp|4–5}} Under the Shared-Responsibility Contaminated Sites Policy Framework (2005), the government may provide funding for the remediation of nonfederal sites, if the contamination is related to federal government activities or national security. See Natural Resources Canada (2012)

===Denmark===
While [[Denmark]] lacks the large land base which creates the magnitude of brownfield issues facing countries such as Germany and the U.S., brownfield sites in areas critical to the local economies of Denmark’s cities require sophisticated solutions and careful interaction with affected communities. Examples include the cleanup and redevelopment of former and current ship building facilities along [[Copenhagen]]’s historic waterfront. Laws in Denmark require a higher degree of coordination of planning and reuse than is found in many other countries.

===France===
In France, brownfields are called "friches industrielles" and the Ministère de l'Écologie, du Développement Durable et de l'Énergie (MEDDE) maintains a database of polluted sites named BASOL, with "more than 4000 sites".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://basol.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/faq.htm#q9 |title= 9. Combien y a-t-il de sites pollués ? |date=n.d. |publisher=Ministère de l'Écologie, du Développement Durable et de l'Énergie (MEDDE) }}&lt;/ref&gt; of about 300 000 to 400 000 potentially polluted sites total (around 100 000 ha),&lt;ref name="ademe"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ademe.fr/collectivites-secteur-public/integrer-lenvironnement-domaines-dintervention/urbanisme-amenagement/dossier/reconversion-friches-urbaines/friches-urbaines-scot-plu |title=Les friches urbaines dans les SCoT et les PLU |date=28 August 2014 |publisher=ADEME }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a historical inventory named BASIAS, maintained by the Agence de l'Environnement et de la Maitrise de l'Energie (ADEME).

===Germany===
[[Germany]] loses greenfields at a rate of about 1.2 square kilometres per day for settlement and transportation infrastructure. Each of the approximately 14,700 local municipalities is empowered to allocate lands for industrial and commercial use. Local control over reuse decisions of German brownfield sites ("Industriebrache") is a critical factor. Industrial sites tend to be remote due to zoning laws, and incur costly overhead for providing infrastructure such as utilities, disposal services and transportation.{{citation needed||date=February 2017}}
In 1989, a brownfield of the Ruhrgebiet became [[Internationale Bauausstellung Emscher Park|Emscher Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dac.dk/en/dac-cities/sustainable-cities/all-cases/green-city/emscher-park-from-dereliction-to-scenic-landscapes/ |title=Emscher Park: From dereliction to scenic landscapes |date=n.d. |publisher=Danish Architecture Centre |location=Kopenhagen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] centuries of industrial use of lands which once formed the birthplace of the [[industrial revolution]] have left entire regions in a brownfield status. New legislation in the UK may provide a needed incentive for brownfield cleanup and redevelopment. Cleanup laws are centered on the premise that the remediation should be "fit for the purpose".

== Redevelopment ==

===Valuation and financing===
Acquisition, adaptive re-use, and disposal of a brownfield site requires advanced and specialized [[Real estate appraisal|appraisal]] analysis techniques.  For example, the [[highest and best use]] of the brownfield site may be affected by the contamination, both before and after remediation.  Additionally, the value should take into account residual stigma and potential for third-party liability. Normal appraisal techniques frequently fail, and appraisers must rely on more advanced techniques, such as [[contingent valuation]], case studies, or statistical analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A 2014 study of EPA brownfield cleanup grants from 2002 through 2008 found an average benefit value of almost $4 million per brownfield site (with a median of $2,117,982).&lt;ref name="atl14"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.citylab.com/cityfixer/2014/07/how-much-cleaning-up-brownfields-is-really-worth/375234/ |title=How Much Cleaning Up Brownfields Is Really Worth |last=Kriston Capps |date=Jul 29, 2014 |publisher=The Atlantic Monthly }}&lt;/ref&gt;
To expedite the cleanup of brownfield sites in the US, some environmental firms have teamed up with insurance companies to underwrite the cleanup and provide a guaranteed cleanup cost to limit land developers' exposure to environmental remediation costs and pollution lawsuits. The environmental firm first performs an extensive investigation.{{citation needed||date=February 2017}}

=== Remediation strategies ===
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2011}}
Innovative [[environmental remediation|remediation]] techniques used at distressed brownfields in recent years include [[in situ thermal remediation]], [[bioremediation]] and [[in situ oxidation]]. Often, these strategies are used in conjunction with each other or with other remedial strategies such as [[soil vapor extraction]]. In this process, vapor from the soil phase is extracted from soils and treated, which has the effect of removing contaminants from the soils and [[groundwater]] beneath a site. Binders can be added to contaminated soil to prevent chemical leaching.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.asla.org/2011awards/183.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Some brownfields with heavy metal contamination have even been cleaned up through an innovative approach called [[phytoremediation]], which uses deep-rooted plants to soak up metals in soils into the plant structure as the plant grows. After they reach maturity, the plants &amp;ndash; which now contain the heavy metal contaminants in their tissues &amp;ndash; are removed and disposed of as hazardous waste.{{citation needed||date=February 2017}}

Research is under way to see if some brownfields can be used to grow crops, specifically for the production of [[biofuel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2006/brownfields-may-turn-green-with-help-from-michigan-state-research/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michigan State University]], in collaboration with [[DaimlerChrysler]] and NextEnergy, has small plots of [[soybean]], [[Maize|corn]], [[canola]], and [[switchgrass]] growing in a former industrial dump site in [[Oakland County, Michigan]]. The intent is to see if the plants can serve two purposes simultaneously: assist with phytoremediation, and contribute to the economical production of [[biodiesel]] and/or [[ethanol fuel]].{{citation needed||date=February 2017}}

The regeneration of brownfields in the [[United Kingdom]] and in other [[Europe]]an countries has gained prominence due to [[greenfield land]] restrictions as well as their potential to promote the [[urban renaissance]].&lt;ref name="tandfonline5"/&gt; Development of brownfield sites also presents an opportunity to reduce the environmental impact on communities, and considerable assessments need to take place in order to evaluate the size of this opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sustainablebuild.co.uk/brownfieldsites.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barriers===
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2011}}
[[File:Brownfields.gif|thumb|right|Examples of brownfields that were redeveloped into productive properties]]
Many contaminated brownfield sites sit unused for decades because the cost of cleaning them to safe standards is more than the land would be worth after redevelopment. However, redevelopment has become more common in the first decade of the 21st century, as developable land has become less available in highly populated areas, and brownfields contribute to environmental stigma which can delay redevelopment.&lt;ref&gt;Coming Back from Economic Despair. Henry Mayer and Micheal Greenburg. Economic Development Quarterly, August 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, the methods of studying contaminated land have become more sophisticated and costly.{{citation needed||date=February 2017}}

Some states and localities have spent considerable money assessing the [[contamination]] on local brownfield sites, to quantify the cleanup costs in an effort to move the redevelopment process forward. Therefore, federal and state programs have been developed to help developers interested in cleaning up brownfield sites and restoring them to practical uses.{{citation needed||date=February 2017}}

In the process of cleaning contaminated brownfield sites, previously unknown [[underground storage tanks]], buried drums or buried railroad [[tank car]]s containing wastes are sometimes encountered. Unexpected circumstances increase the cost for study and clean-up. As a result, the cleanup work may be delayed or stopped entirely. To avoid unexpected contamination and increased costs, many developers insist that a site be thoroughly investigated (via a [[Phase I Environmental Site Assessment|Phase II Site Investigation]] or Remedial Investigation) prior to commencing remedial cleanup activities.{{citation needed||date=February 2017}}

=== Commercial and residential ===
{{as of|2006}} the [[Atlantic Station]] project in [[Atlanta]], was the largest brownfield redevelopment in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/24/realestate/commercial/24atlanta.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1 |title=Building a City Within the City of Atlanta |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2006-05-24 |accessdate=2014-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Dayton]], like many other cities in the region, is developing [[Tech Town (Dayton)|Tech Town]] in order to attract technology-based firms to Dayton and revitalize the downtown area. {{citation needed||date=February 2017}}In [[Homestead, Pennsylvania]], the site once occupied by [[Carnegie Steel]] has been converted into a successful commercial center, [[The Waterfront]].{{citation needed||date=February 2017}}

[[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], has successfully converted{{when|date=February 2017}} numerous former [[steel mill]] sites into high-end residential, shopping, and offices. Examples of brownfield redevelopment in Pittsburgh include:
* In Pittsburgh's [[Squirrel Hill]] neighborhood, a former [[slag]] dump for steel mills was turned into a $243 million residential development called [[Summerset at Frick Park]].
* In Pittsburgh's [[South Side (Pittsburgh)|South Side]] neighborhood, a former [[LTV Steel]] mill site was transformed into [[Southside Works]], a mixed-use development that includes high-end entertainment, retail, offices, and housing.
* In the [[Hazelwood (Pittsburgh)]] neighborhood, a former [[Jones and Laughlin]] steel mill site was transformed into a $104 million office park called [[Pittsburgh Technology Center]].
* In Herr's Island, a {{convert|42|acre|ha|adj=on|order=flip}} island on the western bank of the [[Allegheny River]], a former rail stop for livestock and meatpacking was transformed into [[Washington's Landing]], a waterfront center for commerce, manufacturing, recreation and upscale housing

===Parks===

== Regulation ==
{{further|Brownfield regulation and development}}

===United States===
In the United States, [[Brownfield regulation and development]] is largely governed by state environmental agencies in cooperation with the [[US Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA). In 1995, the EPA launched the Brownfields Program, which was expanded in 2002 with the [[Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act|Brownfields Law]].&lt;ref name="atl14"/&gt; 
The EPA, together with local and national government, can provide technical help and some funding for assessment and cleanup.&lt;ref name="atl14"/&gt; From 2002 through 2013, the EPA awarded nearly 1,000 grants for clean up, for a total of almost $190 million. It can also provide [[tax incentive]]s for cleanup that is not paid for outright; specifically, cleanup costs are fully [[tax-deductible]] in the year they are incurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/brownfields/tax/index.htm |format=URL|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency | title=Brownfields Tax Incentive | accessdate=2009-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the most important provisions on liability relief are contained in state codes that can differ significantly from state to state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/IssuesResearch/EnvironmentandNaturalResources/BrownfieldsOverviewPage/tabid/13239/Default.aspx |publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures |title=Brownfields Overview Page|accessdate=2009-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, regulation of contaminated land comes from Part IIA of the [[Environmental Protection Act 1990]]; responsibility falls on local authorities to create a "contaminated land register". For sites with dubious past and present uses the Local Planning Authority may ask for a desktop study, which is sometimes implemented as a condition in planning applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southwest-environmental.co.uk/Deskto%20Study_copy%281%29.html |title=Desktop Study Reports - London, Bristol &amp; Exeter |publisher=Southwest Environmental Limited |date= n.d.|accessdate=2014-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CT1''' stands for ''Cordless telephone generation 1'' and is an analog [[cordless telephone]] standard that was standardized by the [[European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations]] (CEPT) in 1984 and deployed in eleven European countries.  The initial set of frequencies provided for a set 40 duplex channels using 25&amp;nbsp;kHz separation, with the phones transmitting in the 914-915&amp;nbsp;MHz band and the base stations in the 959-960&amp;nbsp;MHz band.  These frequencies overlap with those used by channels 120-124 on [[GSM]] [[cellular phone]]s and thus these original frequencies have been withdrawn from use for cordless phones in the countries that originally authorized them.

'''CT1+''' provided in 1987 for a set of 80 additional channels using the same technical standard with 885–887&amp;nbsp;MHz used by the phones and 930–932&amp;nbsp;MHz used by the base stations.  While not part of the original GSM-900 band, the frequencies do overlap with the extended GSM-900 band.  Thus between the advent of digital cordless telephones and the desire to free up spectrum for mobile telephones, these frequencies are being withdrawn for use as well.

'''CT0''' is a term used for pre-CT1 analog cordless telephones that were deployed in a variety of countries with incompatible standards, mostly in the low [[VHF]] frequency range below broadcast [[Band I]].

Since 31 December 2008, CTA1 and CTA2 based phones are forbidden in [[Germany]].

Pictured is a road sign in India, with the [[Perso-Arabic script]] above and the [[Devanagari script]] below, with an English translation at the bottom.]]
In [[sociolinguistics]], '''digraphia''' refers to the use of more than one [[writing system]] for the same language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dale |first=Ian R.H. |title=Digraphia |journal=International Journal of the Sociology of Language |volume=26 |pages=5–13 |year=1980 |doi=10.1515/ijsl.1980.26.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  '''Synchronic digraphia''' is the coexistence of two or more writing systems for the same language, while '''diachronic (or sequential) digraphia''' is the replacement of one writing system by another for a particular language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Cheung |first=Yat-Shing |chapter=The form and meaning of digraphia: the case of Chinese |title=Sociolinguistics Today: International Perspectives |editors=K. Bolton and H. Kwok |location=London |publisher=Routledge |year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of [[Synchronic analysis|synchronic]] digraphia is [[Serbian language|Serbian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ivković | first1 = Dejan | year = 2013 | title = Pragmatics meets ideology: Digraphia and non-standard orthographic practices in Serbian online news forums | url = | journal = Journal of Language and Politics | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 335–356 | doi = 10.1075/jlp.12.3.02ivk }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is equally written in both [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet]] and [[Gaj's Latin alphabet]], and practically all speakers of Serbian can read and write both scripts. Another example is [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] which uses two different writing systems: [[Gurmukhi script]], used in Punjab in India, and [[Shahmukhi alphabet|Shahmukhi]] (an Arabic script), though there is no difference when both of these scripts are read or pronounced. [[Konkani]] is written in no fewer than three scripts; [[Devnagari]], [[Kannada script|Kannada]] and [[Roman script|Roman]]. 

An example of [[Diachronic linguistics|diachronic]] digraphia is [[Turkish language|Turkish]], which replaced a [[Perso-Arabic]] writing system with a Latin-based system in 1928.

Digraphia has implications in [[language planning]], [[language policy]], and [[language ideology]].

==Terminology==
''Digraphia'' "using two writing systems for the same language" is an uncommon term, generally restricted to linguistic contexts.

===Etymology===
English [[wikt:digraphia|''digraphia'']], like [[French language|French]] [[wikt:digraphie|''digraphie'']], [[etymology|etymologically]] derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''di-'' [[wikt:δι-|''δι-'']] "twice" and ''-graphia'' [[wikt:-γραφία|''-γραφία'']] "writing".

''Digraphia'' was modeled upon [[wikt:diglossia|''diglossia'']] "the coexistence of two languages or dialects among a certain population", which derives from Greek ''diglossos'' [[wikt:δίγλωσσος|δίγλωσσος]] "bilingual." [[Charles A. Ferguson]], a founder of [[sociolinguistics]],  coined ''diglossia'' in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ferguson | first1 = Charles A | year = 1959 | title = Diglossia | url = | journal = Word | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 325–340 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grivelet analyzes how the influence of diglossia on the unrelated notion of digraphia has "introduced some distortion in the process of defining digraphia," such as distinguishing "high" and "low" varieties.&lt;ref&gt;Grivelet (2001), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Unseth notes one usage of "digraphia" that most closely parallels Ferguson’s “diglossia,” situations where a language uses different scripts for different domains; for instance, "shorthand in English, [[pinyin]] in Chinese for alphabetizing library files, etc. or several scripts which are replaced by Roman script during e-mail usage."&lt;ref&gt;Unseth (2005), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', which does not yet include ''digraphia'', enters two ''digraph'' terms and ''digraphic''.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' (2009). 2nd ed., v. 4.0.&lt;/ref&gt; First, the [[linguistic]] term ''digraph'' is defined as, "A group of two letters expressing a simple sound of speech". This meaning applies to both two letters representing a single speech sound in [[Digraph (orthography)|orthography]] (e.g., English ''ng'' representing the [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|/ŋ/}}) and a single [[grapheme]] with two letters in [[Typographical ligature#Digraphs|typographical ligature]] (e.g., the [[Old English Latin alphabet]] letter [[æ]]). Second, the [[graph theory]] term ''digraph'' (a [[portmanteau]] from [[directed graph]]) is defined as, "A graph in which each line has a direction associated with it; a finite, non-empty set of elements together with a set of ordered pairs of these elements." The two ''digraph'' terms were first recorded in 1788 and 1955, respectively. The ''OED2'' defines two ''digraphic'' meanings, "Pertaining to or of the nature of a digraph" and "Written in two different characters or alphabets." It gives their earliest examples in 1873 and 1880 (which was used meaning "digraphia"). [[Isaac Hollister Hall]], an American scholar of [[Oriental studies]], described an [[Eteocypriot language]] publication as "bilingual (or digraphic, as both inscriptions are in the same language)."&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Isaac Hollister (1880). "The Cypriote Inscriptions". ''[[Scribner's Monthly]]'', vol. 20, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4YwPAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA205#v=onepage&amp;q=digraphic&amp;f=false p. 205].&lt;/ref&gt; Hall's article was antedated by [[Demetrios Pieridis]]'s 1875 usage of ''digraphic'' instead of ''bilingual'' for an inscription written in both the [[Greek alphabet]] and [[Cypriot syllabary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pierides | first1 = Demetrios | year = 1875 | title = On a digraphic inscription found in Larnaca | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ursMAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;ots=gypDUe5UVx&amp;dq=On%20a%20digraphic%20inscription%20found%20in%20Larnaca&amp;pg=PA38 | journal = Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 38–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

English ''digraphic'' and ''digraphia'' were contemporaneous with their corresponding terms in French linguistics. In 1877, [[Julius Oppert]] introduced ''digraphique'' to describe languages written in [[cuneiform]] syllabaries.&lt;ref&gt;Oppert, Jules (1877). [Review of] François Lenormant, Études sur quelques parties des syllabaires cunéiformes, Paris 1877; idem, Les syllabaires cunéiformes, Paris 1877. Göttingische gelehrte Anzeigen 1877(45–46). 1409–1449.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, [[Auguste Barth]] used French ''digraphisme'' for Cambodian inscriptions written in [[Khmer script]] and [[Brāhmī script]].&lt;ref&gt;Bergaigne, Abel (1893). Inscriptions sanscrites du Cambodge [edited and commented by Auguste Barth]. Notices et extraits des manuscrits de la Bibliothèque Nationale et autres bibliothèques 27(1). 293–588.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, [[Robèrt Lafont]] coined ''digraphie'' regarding the sociolinguistics of French and [[Occitan language|Occitan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lafont | first1 = Robert | year = 1971 | title = Un problème de culpabilité sociologique: La diglossie franco-occitane | url = http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/lfr_0023-8368_1971_num_9_1_5576 | journal = Langue française | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 93–99 | doi=10.3406/lfr.1971.5576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the word "digraphia" is new, the practice is ancient. [[Darius the Great]]'s (c. 522-486 BCE) [[Behistun Inscription]] was written in three [[cuneiform script]]s for [[Old Persian]], [[Elamite language|Elamite]], and [[Babylonian language|Babylonian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Unseth | first1 = Peter | year = 2005 | title = Sociolinguistic parallels between choosing scripts and languages | url = | journal = Written Language &amp; Literacy | volume = 8 | issue = 1| page = 36 | doi=10.1075/wll.8.1.02uns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neologizers===
Four authors independently neologized English ''digraphia'' from ''diglossia''.

The [[Songhay languages|Songhay]] [[linguist]] Petr Zima (1974) first used "digraphia" to describe the [[Hausa language]] having two writing systems, [[Boko (alphabet)|Boko]] ([[Latin script]]) and [[Ajami script]] ([[Arabic script]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zima | first1 = Petr | year = 1974 | title = Digraphia: The case of Hausa | url = http://related.springerprotocols.com/lp/de-gruyter/digraphia-the-case-of-hausa-ZFtJZ8w2Kk | journal = Linguistics | volume = 124 | issue = | pages = 57–69 | doi=10.1515/ling.1974.12.124.57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zima differentiated these paired situations.
*''Digraphia'': "Two types of written form of one language co-exist, based upon the usage of two distinct graphical systems (scripts) by the respective language community."
*''Diorthographia'': "Two types of written form of a particular language co-exist, using the same script, but they are based upon the usage of two distinct orthographies by the same language community."&lt;ref&gt;Zima (1974), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;
Usage of "diorthographia" is unusual. Compare [[dysgraphia]] meaning "a language disorder that affects a person's ability to write" and [[dysorthographia]] "a synonym for [[dyslexia]]".

The [[anthropologist]] James R. Jaquith (1976), who studied unconventional spelling in advertising, used "digraphia" to describe the practice of writing brand names in [[all caps]] (e.g., [[Arrid|ARRID]]). He described digraphia as "the graphic analog of what linguists call diglossia", and defined it as "different versions of a written language exist simultaneously and in complementary distribution in a speech community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jaquith | first1 = James R | year = 1976 | title = Digraphia in advertising: The public as guinea pig | url = | journal = Visible Language | volume = 10 | issue = 4| page = 303 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[sociolinguist]] Ian R. H. Dale (1980) wrote a general survey of digraphia, defined as, "the use of two (or more) writing systems to represent varieties of a single language."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dale | first1 = Ian R. H. | year = 1980 | title = Digraphia | url = http://uk-online.uni-koeln.de/remarks/d5134/rm2173940.doc | journal = International Journal of the Sociology of Language | volume = 26 | issue =  | pages = 5–13 | doi = 10.1515/ijsl.1980.26.5 | access-date = 2011-08-30 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111007201951/http://uk-online.uni-koeln.de/remarks/d5134/rm2173940.doc | archive-date = 2011-10-07 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[sinologist]] and [[lexicographer]] [[John DeFrancis]] (1984) used ''digraphia'', defined as "the use of two or more different systems of writing the same language," to translate Chinese ''shuangwenzhi'' (雙文制 "two-script system") of writing in [[Chinese characters]] and [[Pinyin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = DeFrancis | first1 = John | year = 1984 | title = Digraphia | url = | journal = Word | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 59–66 | doi=10.1080/00437956.1984.11435748}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DeFrancis later explained, "I have been incorrectly credited with coining the term ''digraphia'', which I indeed thought I had created as a parallel in writing to Charles Ferguson’s ''diglossia'' in speech."&lt;ref&gt;DeFrancis, John (2006). [http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp171_chinese_writing_reform.pdf Prospects for Chinese Writing Reform], ''[[Sino-Platonic Papers]]'' 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegyi coined and suggested the terms "bigraphism" and "multigraphism",&lt;ref&gt;Hegyi, O. 1979. Minority and restricted uses of the Arabic alphabet: the aljamiado phenomenon. ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' Vol. 99, No. 2:262-269.&lt;/ref&gt; but he only used them in a footnote (fn. 17, p. 268) and did not promote the use of either of these terms, nor follow up on his insights into the importance of studying "the use of two or more different writing systems for the same language... such cases have been more widespread than commonly assumed."

===Usage===
''Digraphia'' is an uncommon term in current English usage. For instance, the [[Corpus of Contemporary American English]], which includes over 425,000,000 words, lists ''digraphia'' three times in "academic genre" contexts.
 
Stéphane Grivelet, who edited a special "Digraphia: Writing systems and society" issue of the ''[[International Journal of the Sociology of Language]]'', explains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grivelet | first1 = Stéphane | year = 2001 | title = Introduction", "Digraphia: Writing systems and society | url = | journal = International Journal of the Sociology of Language | volume = 150 | issue = | pages = 1–10 | doi=10.1515/ijsl.2001.037}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;After 25 years and various articles on the subject, there are still important differences in the scope of the definition, and the notion itself is rarely used in sociolinguistics, apart from the field of Chinese studies, where the notion of digraphia is nowadays frequently used to describe the coexistence of two writing systems: Chinese script and Pinyin.&lt;ref&gt;Grivelet (2001), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Digraphia''' has some rare synonyms. '''Orthographic diglossia''' antedates digraphia, and was noted by Paul Wexler in 1971."&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, Paul (1971). "Diglossia, language standardization and purism." ''Lingua'' 27, 340. "Orthographic differences are not always a reflection of ethnocultural differences and multiple standards. Different scripts may be used by a single ethnic group for different purposes (e.g., secular versus religious literature), in which case we could speak of 'orthographic diglossia'."&lt;/ref&gt; '''Bigraphism''', '''bialphabetism''', and '''biscriptality''' are infrequently used.

Some scholars avoid using the word "digraphia". Describing terminology for "script obsolescence," [[Stephen D. Houston]], [[John Baines (Egyptologist)|John Baines]], and Jerrold Cooper say, "'Biscript' refers to a text in two different writing systems. 'Biliteracy' and 'triliteracy' label the concurrent use of two or three scripts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Houston |first1=S. |last2=Baines |first2=J. |last3=Cooper |first3=J. |year=2003 |title=Last writing: Script obsolescence in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Mesoamerica |url=http://neareast.jhu.edu/bin/g/o/jc%20Last%20Writing.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History |volume=45 |issue=3 |page=432 |doi=10.1017/s0010417503000227 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical aspects==
Digraphia can be either "synchronic" (or "concurrent") or "diachronic" ("historical" or "sequential"),&lt;ref&gt;DeFrancis (1984), p. 60 uses concurrent and sequential.&lt;/ref&gt; extending [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s classic division between [[synchronic analysis (linguistics)|synchronic linguistics]] and  [[historical linguistics|diachronic linguistics]]. Dale first differentiated "diachronic (or historical) digraphia" ("more than one writing system used for a given language in successive periods of time") and "synchronic digraphia" ("more than one writing system used contemporaneously for the same language").&lt;ref&gt;Dale (1980), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Dale concluded that,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Two primary factors have been identified as operating on a society in the choice of script for representing its language. These are the prevailing cultural influence (often a religion) and the prevailing political influence of the period in which the choice is made. Synchronic digraphia results when more than one such influence is operating and none can dominate all groups of speakers of the language in question [ … ] Diachronic digraphia results when different influences prevail over a given speech community at different times.&lt;ref&gt;Dale (1980), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Some recent scholarship questions the practicality of this synchronic/diachronic distinction. Grivelet contends that, "digraphia is a single sociolinguistic process with two types of outcome (concurrent or sequential digraphia) and with specific features related to the causes and types of development of the various cases.&lt;ref&gt;Grivelet (2001), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Unseth lists and exemplifies four factors that can influence a language community's choice of a script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Unseth | first1 = Peter | year = 2005 | title = Sociolinguistic parallels between choosing scripts and languages | url = | journal = Written Language &amp; Literacy | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 22–29 | doi=10.1075/wll.8.1.02uns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#"To identify themselves with a group." In the 1940s, Mongolia replaced the traditional [[Mongolian script]] first briefly with the [[Mongolian Latin alphabet]] and then, under Soviet influence, with the [[Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet]]. From the 1980s, the Mongolian script was reintroduced into schools for its historical and cultural importance.
#"To distance themselves from a group." In the mid-19th century, the LDS Church developed and promoted the [[Deseret alphabet]] for English. [[Brigham Young]] publicly claimed it was more phonetically accurate than Latin script and would facilitate learning to read and write English. However, historian David Bigler says the Deseret alphabet "demonstrated cultural exclusivism, an important consideration. It also kept secrets from curious non-Mormons, [and] controlled what children would be allowed to read."&lt;ref&gt;Bigler, David (1998). ''Forgotten kingdom: the Mormon theocracy in the American West, 1847–1896'', p. 56. Arthur Clark.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Participation in developments on a broader scale. The choice of a script can influence a group's preparedness to interact with other regional or international groups. For instance, the [[Hmong language]] has numerous alternate writing systems. Hmong who live in Southeast Asia prefer the indigenous [[Romanized Popular Alphabet]] (RPA) or the [[Pahawh Hmong]] [[semi-syllabary]]; Hmong expatriates who live in the United States prefer to romanize names differently, such as Latin ''Hmong'' instead of RPA ''Hmoob''.
#"Linguistic considerations." Sometimes a foreign script is rejected because it is unsuitable for the phonetics of a language. [[Korean language|Korean]] was first written in logographic ''[[Hanja]]'' Chinese characters, but king [[Sejong the Great]] promulgated the [[Hangul]] alphabet, which is better suited for transcribing [[Korean phonology]]. In the present day, [[South Korea]]n uses both ''Hanja'' logographs and ''Hangul'' letters, while [[North Korea]] uses only ''Hangul''.

Linguists who study [[language and gender]] have analyzed gender-differentiated speech varieties ("genderlects", usually spoken by women), and there are a few cases of scripts predominantly used by women. Japanese ''hiragana'' was initially a women's script, for instance, used by [[Murasaki Shikibu]] to write ''[[The Tale of Genji]]''. Chinese [[Nüshu script]] (literally "women's writing) is a simplification of characters that was traditionally used by women in [[Jiangyong County]] of [[Hunan]] province.&lt;ref&gt;Unseth (2005), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only scripts, but also letters can have iconic power to differentiate social groups. For example, the names of many [[heavy metal bands]] (e.g., [[Motörhead]], [[Infernäl Mäjesty]], [[Mötley Crüe]]) use umlauts "to index the musical genre as well as the notion of ‘Gothic’ more generally."&lt;ref&gt;Sebba (2009), p 40.&lt;/ref&gt; This digraphic usage is called the "[[metal umlaut]]" (or "röck döts").

==Synchronic digraphia==
''Synchronic digraphia'' is the coexistence of two or more writing systems for the same language. A modern example is the [[Serbian language]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ivković | first1 = Dejan | year = 2013 | title = Pragmatics meets ideology: Digraphia and non-standard orthographic practices in Serbian online news forums | url = | journal = Journal of Language and Politics | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 335–356 | doi = 10.1075/jlp.12.3.02ivk }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is written in either the [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet]] or [[Gaj's Latin alphabet]]. Although most speakers can read and write both scripts, Roman Catholic Croatians and Muslim [[Bosniaks]] generally use Latin, while Orthodox Serbians commonly use both. However, older indigenous scripts were used much earlier, most notably [[Bosnian Cyrillic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trager | first1 = George L | year = 1974 | title = Writing and writing systems | url = | journal = Current Trends in Linguistics | volume = 12 | issue = | page = 413 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inuktitut]] is also officially digraphic, using both Latin and [[Inuktitut syllabics]]. In [[Hindi-Urdu]], the [[Devanagari]] or [[Persian script]] generally follows the [[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]] standards and the speaker's religious affiliation, though Urdu is sometimes written in Devanagari in India. Digraphia is limited, however, in that most people know only one script.

The [[Japanese writing system]] has unusually complex digraphia. William C. Hannas distinguishes two digraphic forms of Japanese: "true digraphia" of occasionally using ''[[rōmaji]]'' Latin alphabet for a few [[loanwords]] like ''DVD'', and of regularly using three scripts (technically, "trigraphia") for different functions. Japanese is written with ''[[kanji]]'' "Chinese character" [[Logogram|logographs]] used for [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary]]; ''[[hiragana]]'' used for native Japanese words; and ''[[katakana]]'' used for foreign borrowings or graphic emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;Hannas, William C. (1997). ''Asia's Orthographic Dilemma''. University of Hawaii Press, pp. 299-300.&lt;/ref&gt; Take ''Nihon'' for instance, the primary [[Names of Japan|name of Japan]]. It is normally written 日本 (literally, "sun's origin") in ''kanji'' – but is occasionally written にほん in ''hiragana'', ニホン in ''katakana'', or Nihon in ''[[rōmaji]]'' ("romanization"). Japanese users having a certain amount of flexibility in choosing between scripts, and their choices can have social meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sebba | first1 = Mark | year = 2009 | title = Sociolinguistic approaches to writing systems research | url = | journal = Writing Systems Research | volume = 1 | issue = 1| page = 38 | doi=10.1093/wsr/wsp002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Berontoseno Arabica Coffee 250gr in Multiscript.jpg|thumb|247x247px|The use of Javanese script, [[Pegon script|Pegon]] (modified Arabic script) and Latin alphabet for coffee packaging in Indonesia saying ''100% Pure Coffee Powder''.]]
Another example is the [[Malay language]], which most often uses the [[Latin alphabet]], while in certain geographic areas ([[Kelantan]] state of Malaysia, [[Brunei]]) it is also written with an adapted Arabic alphabet called [[Jawi script|Jawi]]. Adaptation of Arabic script is also widely used across [[Malay Archipelago]] since the introduction of [[Islam]]. In Java, [[Javanese people|Javanese]] people, which predominantly ruled by [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhism|Buddha]] kingdoms, have their own writing system called [[Javanese script|Hanacaraka]]. When Islamic power took place, modified Arabic writing system (called [[Pegon script|Pegon]]) was introduced, alongside with the massive introduction of Latin alphabet by western colonialists. This results in the use of three writing systems to write modern Javanese, either based on a particular context (religious, cultural or normal), or sometimes also written simultaneously. This phenomenon also occurred in some other cultures in Indonesia.

An element of synchronic digraphia is present in many languages not using the Latin script, in particular in text messages and when typing on a computer which does not have the facility to represent the usual script for that language. In such cases, Latin script is often used, although systems of transcription are often not standardised.

Digraphia is controversial in modern [[Written Chinese]]. The ongoing [[debate on traditional and simplified Chinese characters]] concerns "diglyphia" or "[[Pluricentric language|pluricentricity]]" rather than digraphia. Chinese digraphia involves the use of both [[Chinese characters]] and [[Hanyu Pinyin]] romanization. Pinyin is officially approved for a few special uses, such as annotating characters for learners of Chinese and transcribing Chinese names.&lt;ref&gt;Xieyan Hincha (2004). [http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp134_chinese_digraphia.pdf Two Steps Toward Digraphia in China]. ''Sino-Platonic Papers'' 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Pinyin continues to be adopted for other functions, such as computers, education, library catalogs, and merchandise labels.&lt;ref&gt;DeFrancis (1984), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Among [[Chinese input methods for computers]], [[Pinyin input method|Pinyin]] is the most popular phonetic method. [[Zhou Youguang]] predicts, "Digraphia is perhaps the key for Chinese to enter the age of Information processing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Youguang | first1 = Zhou | year = 1986 | title = Modernization of the Chinese Language | url = http://plosjournal.deepdyve.com/lp/de-gruyter/modernization-of-the-chinese-language-SmsCBMDYNZ | journal = International Journal of the Sociology of Language | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 7–23 | doi=10.1515/ijsl.1986.59.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many writers, both from China (e.g., [[Mao Dun]] and Zhou Youguang) and from abroad (e.g., John DeFrancis, [[Victor H. Mair]], [[J. Marshall Unger]], and William Hannas&lt;ref&gt;Hannas, William C. (1997). ''Asia's Orthographic Dilemma''. University of Hawaii Press.&lt;/ref&gt;) have argued for digraphia to be implemented as a Chinese language standard. These digraphic reformers call for a generalized used of Pinyin orthography along with Chinese characters. 
Yat-Shing Cheung differentiates three Chinese digraphic situations. (1) Both the High and the Low forms derive from the same script system: traditional and simplified characters. (2) Both forms derive from the same system but the Low form borrows foreign elements: [[Putonghua]] and topolects (or "dialects"). (3) The High and the Low forms derive from two different script systems: Chinese characters and pinyin.&lt;ref&gt;Cheung, Yat-Shing (1992). "The form and meaning of digraphia: the case of Chinese". In K. Bolton and H. Kwok. ''Sociolinguistics Today: International Perspectives''. 210-215. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diachronic digraphia==
"Diachronic" or "sequential digraphia", in which a language switches writing systems, can occur historically through [[language change]] or suddenly through [[language reform]]. "Abrupt script shift can be seen in the change of Turkish from Arabic script to Roman (in one year), while a gradual change of script can be seen in the change from writing Korean in Chinese characters to Hangul (a process that arguably nearly spanned five centuries)."&lt;ref&gt;Unseth (2005), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Azerbaijani language]] provides an "extreme example" of diachronic digraphia; it has historically been written in [[Runic alphabet|runic]], Arabic, Latin, Cyrillic, and again Latin alphabets.&lt;ref&gt;Unseth (2005), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hatcher, Lynley. 2008. Script change in Azerbaijan: acts of identity. ''International Journal of the Sociology of Language'' 192:105–116.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many examples of languages that used to be written in a script, which was replaced later. Examples are [[Romanian language|Romanian]] (which originally used [[Cyrillic]] and changed to [[Latin alphabet|Latin]]) in the 1860s; [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] (which switched from a form of Chinese writing called [[Chữ Nôm]] to the Latin alphabet); [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Somali language|Somali]], and (partially) [[Malay language|Malay]], which all switched from [[Arabic script]] to the [[Latin alphabet]], and many countries of the former Soviet Union, which abandoned the [[Cyrillic]] script after the dissolution of the [[USSR]] such as [[Moldova]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Uzbekistan]] all switched from Cyrillic to Latin. DeFrancis notes, "The old literature in the earlier scripts remains, however, so that all these scripts more or less overlap in use, by scholars involved with early texts, or for reprinting earlier materials for a wider readership and for other limited uses."&lt;ref&gt;DeFrancis (1984), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dry firing''' is the practice of "firing" a [[firearm]] without [[ammunition]] or practicing the manipulation of a firearm with an inert training platform such as a SIRT, Laserlyte, or LaserAmmo training firearm.  If done incorrectly, dry firing may be mechanically damaging to some firearms – especially [[Rimfire ammunition|rimfire]] weapons, where the firing pin in most designs will impact the breech face if the weapon is dry-fired. Because of this, precautions (such as the use of [[snap cap]]s) need to be taken if such a weapon is to be deliberately dry-fired.

==Benefits==
There are many benefits to dry firing.  Learning is faster and can be safer with dry fire.  It's easier to practice without developing a flinch.  Dry fire allows shooters to practice in locations where they couldn't practice with live ammo.  You can practice grip, drawing, sight alignment, trigger control, reloads, malfunctions, and more during dry fire practice. The technique allows people to conduct a safe, economical form of training to improve their shooting skills. An emphasis is placed on safety to prevent an accidental discharge. Training should be conducted in an area with no ammunition and with a suitable backstop.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120801111101/http://beabettershot.com/dry-fire/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, a number of companies have developed methods of enhancing dry fire practice to improve skills. Products that fire a laser, as opposed to a solid projectile, have become increasingly popular. These include chamber inserts available for various caliber firearms, as well as dedicated training pistols or replacement AR-15 bolt carrier groups. There are also a number of target systems for these laser dry fire training aides, that are becoming more affordable and popular. These products help people get more from dry fire practice by providing feedback on shot placement and times, and make dry fire a more enjoyable experience.  In addition, there are training aids such as training cards that provide shooters a variety of drills to do that will help them develop skills that will carry over to live fire.&lt;ref&gt;

==Considerations==
It is generally acceptable to dry fire more modern [[centerfire]] firearms without a cartridge or snap cap for limited volume training. Older designs such as the [[CZ 52]] and [[Colt Single Action Army]] are exceptions. However, dry firing a rimfire firearm, striker based firearms or guns with angled firing pins (such as revolvers with hammer-mounted firing pins or older shotguns) can damage the gun. Furthermore, damage can occur to the [[chamber (weaponry)|chamber]] mouth of a rimfire firearm.&lt;ref name="Dunlap1963"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunlap|first=Roy F. |title=Gunsmithing: A Manual of Firearms Design, Construction, Alteration, and Remodeling.

Dry firing in [[archery]], also known as "dry loosing", refers to the releasing of a drawn [[bow and arrow|bow]] without an arrow.  This practice should be avoided as much as possible, because without the mass of the arrow to absorb the [[elastic energy]] released, the energy is instead dissipated through vibration of the bowstring and the bow limbs, and can do significant structural damage to the bow itself.  [[Compound bow]]s are particularly susceptible to damage due to high tension and numerous moving parts.  Dry firing a modern high-poundage compound bow even once may cause a combination of cracked limbs, bent axles, string derailment, cam warpage, string/cable failure, cable slide failure, and can even cause the bow to shatter.  While some bows can survive a dry fire with no apparent damage, typically manufacturers do not warrant their bows for dry firing, and any bow that has been dry fired needs to be thoroughly inspected for damage before shooting again.  In particular, the limbs need to be inspected for cracking around cam axles and the opening of the slot where the cams or pulleys fit in (since they tend to tilt sideways during a dry fire). 

[[Crossbow]]s, with their high draw weights, are even more likely to be damaged by dry firing.

==Etymology==
The term dry firing is most likely derived from the similar phrase "[[dry run (testing)]]", which is a rehearsal or testing process and in the case of the firearm, one is "testing" the trigger action and observing the hammer or striker drop, without using live ammunition. Sources indicate that "dry" originates from exhibitions by late-19th-century fire departments in the [[United States]], where drills (runs) were conducted for public viewing without the use of water (dry).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-dry1.htm |title=Dry run |publisher=World Wide Words |date=2004-07-03 |accessdate=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[broadcast programming|scheduling]] of [[television program]]ming in [[North America]] (namely the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Mexico]]) must cope with different [[time zone]]s. The United States (excluding territories) has six time zones ([[Hawaii–Aleutian Time Zone|Hawaii–Aleutian]], [[Alaska Time Zone|Alaska]], [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific]], [[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]], [[Central Time Zone (North America)|Central]] and [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]]), with further variation in the observance of [[daylight saving time]]. Canada also has six time zones (Pacific, Mountain, Central, Eastern, [[Atlantic Time Zone|Atlantic]] and [[Newfoundland Time Zone|Newfoundland]]). Mexico has four time zones (Pacific, Mountain, Central, and Eastern). This requires [[terrestrial television|broadcast]] and [[cable television|pay television]] networks in each country to shift programs in time to show them in different regions.

==In Canada==
===Broadcast networks===
Canadian broadcasting networks, with six time zones and a much larger percentage of its audience residing in the Mountain Time Zone than in the Central Time Zone, are sometimes able to avoid the issues that affect American programming by airing pre-recorded programs on local time. [[CBC Television]] and [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] created delay centres in [[Calgary]] in the early 1960s in order to allow programming to air in each time zone based on the region.&lt;ref name="broadcasting-history"&gt;{{cite web|title= "Half an hour later in Newfoundland....?" Yes, but why?|url=http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/index3.html?url=http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/networks/Calgary_Delay_Centres.html|date=2014-09-14|archiveurl=http://archive.today/uG6mq|archivedate=2014-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike in the United States, virtually all live events, including live entertainment shows and sports television, are simultaneously broadcast nationwide in Canada. For instance, live shows in Canada are aired to entirety at the same time in all time zones based on Eastern time. Several live U.S. shows are also aired simultaneously in all of Canada, including for viewers in the Pacific Coast (unlike in the United States where some viewers on the same side of the continent depend on tape-delayed broadcasts for some otherwise live events). Conversely, live shows aired in Canada are frequently televised simultaneously for some viewers in the U.S. with access to Canadian broadcast networks.&lt;ref name="broadcasting-history" /&gt;

===Cable and satellite channels===
The vast majority of [[specialty channel|specialty cable and satellite television channels]] in Canada each operate a single feed which is distributed in all time zones. This includes all French language channels, as they predominantly serve [[Francophone]] areas of the country, mostly in Quebec (almost all of which observes Eastern Time). Even many long-standing specialty channels with a general entertainment format use a single national feed, though in many cases they will repeat core primetime programming three hours after first broadcast, such that programs can be promoted as airing at the same time in both the Eastern and Pacific time zones.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Some specialty channels do operate two separate broadcast feeds for [[Eastern Canada|Eastern]] and [[Western Canada]]. The Eastern feed airs programs on an Eastern Time schedule, while the Western feed airs the same programming on a three-hour delay. The separation between feeds is typically implemented at the border between [[Manitoba]] and [[Ontario]], which may result in a program that airs at 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time in Ontario not airing in Manitoba until 12:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. CT (whereas an equivalent program in the U.S. would typically be available at 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. for Central Time viewers). However, one channel, the [[Aboriginal Peoples Television Network]], implements the separation at the border between Manitoba and Saskatchewan.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Watershed and safe harbour===
The [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC) applies more restrictive [[Censorship in Canada|censorship]] regulations to broadcast programming shown in prime time, compared to content transmitted after a [[Watershed (broadcasting)#Canada|watershed]] hour beyond which few children would be likely to be watching. This can be problematic if the same content is broadcast simultaneously nationwide, as the 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. watershed in Vancouver falls at 12:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. in Toronto and 1:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. in St. John's. LGBT specialty broadcaster [[PrideVision]] was particularly affected as, from its launch in 2001 until 2005, its format included more innocuous entertainment programming aimed at the gay community during the day and in prime time and [[hardcore pornography|hardcore]] [[gay pornography|pornographic]] content in the overnight (with the latter expanding into the mid-evening by 2004). The network's adult programming was spun out into a [[Playmen TV|second channel]] so that the parent network, now [[OutTV]], could broadcast its non-explicit entertainment and lifestyle programming across its entire broadcast day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=PrideVision changing its format in preparation of new adult-only channel|url=http://www.channelcanada.com/Article639.html|website=Channel Canada|accessdate=August 20, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028231900/http://www.channelcanada.com/Article639.html|archivedate=October 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United States==

===Time zone feeds===
With four time zones in the [[contiguous United States]], American broadcast [[television network]]s generally broadcast at least two separate feeds to their [[owned-and-operated station]]s and [[network affiliate|affiliates]], as do [[cable channel|cable/satellite channels]]: the "eastern feed" that is aired simultaneously in the Eastern and Central Time Zones, and the "western feed" that is [[broadcast delay|tape-delayed]] three hours for those in the Pacific Time Zone. This ensures that a program, for example, that airs at 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. EST on the East Coast is also shown locally at 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on the West Coast. Networks may also broadcast a third feed specifically for the Mountain Time Zone, on which programs are usually broadcast on a one-hour delay from the Eastern Time Zone. Otherwise, some stations in the Mountain Time Zone use the western feed, while others get a mix of both the Eastern and Pacific feeds.

The Eastern Time Zone is commonly used as a '' de facto'' official time for the United States because it includes the nation's [[capital city]], [[Washington D.C.]]; the most populous city, [[New York City]]; and half of the country's population.&lt;ref&gt;Based on the 2011 population estimate, 46 percent of the American population live in the Eastern time zone, 30 percent in the Central zone; 7 percent in the Mountain zone, and 17 percent in the Pacific zone.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broadcast television===
Effectively, the East, Mountain and West network feeds allow [[prime time]] on [[terrestrial television|broadcast television]] networks to end at 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Central and Mountain and 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific. When it first expanded its programming into prime time in April 1987, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] became the first major broadcast network in the U.S. to offer a "common prime" schedule; this type of scheduling subtracts an hour from the prime time schedule, reducing it to two hours on Monday through Saturdays and three hours on Sundays – ending evening network programming earlier than [[NBC]], [[CBS]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] did – and continue to do (Fox did expand its Sunday primetime schedule into the 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. timeslot in September 1987, before giving back that hour to its stations in September 1993). [[The WB]] and [[UPN]] followed the "common prime" scheduling model when they both launched in January 1995; the replacements for those networks, [[The CW]] and the [[MyNetworkTV]] program service, similarly used that model upon their launches in September 2006.

In 2009, [[PBS]] began using [[Internet server]]s instead of separate feeds for time delaying of its programming to the network's [[network affiliate#Member stations|member stations]]. The servers imitate a delayed program feed, broadcasting the program at the correct airtime as if it were being broadcast via satellite. This was done as PBS had upgraded its main program feed to [[high-definition television|high definition]] (or to [[widescreen]] digital at the very least) in December 2008, but satellite capacity allowed for only Eastern and Pacific time zone feeds, prompting the removal of the Central and Mountain time zone feeds and a shared feed for Alaska and Pacific time zones in February 2009, which created complaints from PBS stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New servers, not separate feeds, will handle PBS time-zone delays (Idaho Public Television in the News)|url=http://idahoptv.org/press/showStory.cfm?StoryID=40733|website=[[Idaho Public Television]]|date= |accessdate=October 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cable and satellite television===
Subscribers to cable or satellite television services may still only receive East Coast feeds for certain channels even if they reside on the West Coast. Some cable channels only offer one broadcast feed, where viewers see the same program in all time zones. For example, until it dropped the program in 2014, [[superstation]]-turned-basic cable channel [[WGN America]] telecast the noon (Central Time) newscast from [[WGN-TV]] in [[Chicago]] at 1:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern in [[Washington, D.C.]] and 10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. Pacific in [[Los Angeles]].

Broadcasters offer East and West Coast feeds of some basic cable channels for viewing in all time zones, allowing viewers who missed a particular program to watch it three hours earlier or later.

The usage of dual feeds of the same channel is a commonplace method for [[pay television|premium channels]] such as [[HBO]], [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] and [[Starz]], in which the Pacific time zone feed of the primary channel is packaged with the East Coast feed of the main channel and the pay service's multiplex channels (if the premium channel has any). Most commonly, the Eastern and Pacific Time Zone feeds of only the main channel are packaged together, although some providers may also provide both coastal feeds of a premium service's multiplex channels. In some cases, cable networks (such as [[United States cable news|cable news]] and [[List of sports television channels|sports channels]]) "fake" the dual feed approach by recycling their same-day prime time programming during the overnight hours on a three (or four) hour cycle; in this case, the programs are automatically rebroadcast at the advertised time (or one hour later) in the Pacific Time Zone.

In the United States, distant over-the-air broadcast stations affiliated with the six broadcast networks are offered by [[direct-broadcast satellite television|direct-broadcast satellite]] providers as well as [[television receive-only|C-band]] services that do not offer locally based affiliates for most individual markets, allowing viewers to choose between the east and west feeds of a given network. These designated stations are usually owned-and-operated stations and/or affiliates of ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox and The CW located in the Eastern and Pacific Time Zones (usually those based in New York City and Los Angeles such as ABC's respective O&amp;Os [network [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated]]] in those markets, [[WABC-TV]] and [[KABC-TV]]). Dish Network and C-band providers also provide CW and MyNetworkTV affiliates designated as superstations (such as [[WPIX]] in New York and [[KTLA]] in Los Angeles), with Dish mainly making them available in markets where it does not carry a [[low-power broadcasting|low-power]], [[digital subchannel]]-only or non-broadcast affiliate of either network (especially in markets served by The CW's quasi-national feed for areas ranked below #98 in [[Nielsen Media Research]] market rankings, [[The CW Plus]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The country's two major satellite providers – [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]] – only offer these de facto coastal feeds in order to provide programming from at least one network to subscribers living in smaller [[media market]]s or rural areas where a network does not have a local affiliate available on the provider, if even presently serving the given location at all. Since the services began offering local network affiliates from additional markets in the early 2000s, many local stations have successfully sued DBS providers to deny access to distant stations carrying programming from the same network as them within their markets. This differs from the subscription television model in Canada, most cable and satellite providers carry distant over-the-air broadcast stations from the U.S. (consisting of both affiliates of the Big Four broadcast networks and minor network affiliates classified as superstations), in addition to O&amp;Os and affiliates of domestically-based networks.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Live events===
For decades, the [[Super Bowl]] (currently aired on rotation by CBS, Fox and NBC) and most sports television programs, including other major national events, have been broadcast to totality live in all time zones across U.S. territories, but also present special problems for local stations. For such events, the networks may either advertise Eastern time only, or list the times in both Eastern and Pacific (e.g. "8 p.m. Eastern/5 p.m. Pacific"). As such, a live Sunday sporting event that is played from 1:00 to 4:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Pacific Time preempts local 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. newscasts on the East Coast. Likewise, a State of the Union address that is televised at 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time preempts local 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. newscasts on the West Coast.

Until recently, several entertainment shows that are broadcast live in the Eastern and Central time zones, including some that originate from Los Angeles (particularly live reality competition shows as ABC's ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' and NBC's ''[[The Voice (U.S. TV series)|The Voice]]''), are tape-delayed in the Mountain and Pacific time zones, thus making it impossible for viewers in those time zones to vote after performance episodes of live reality competition shows finish airing live on the East Coast. The mechanics of the 2014 ABC series ''[[Rising Star (TV series)|Rising Star]]'' — which allowed for live, real-time voting by viewers — would allow the insertion of live reaction segments in the event that a contestant eliminated by low vote totals in the original Eastern/Central time zone broadcast would be saved by results watching the Pacific/Mountain broadcast, but the show was broadcast live across the [[Contiguous United States|mainland U.S.]] except the Pacific time zone. Moreover, ABC noted that the chances of West Coast votes differing substantially from other viewers was statistically small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Rising Star' Producers Consulted Mathematicians Over Time Zone Dilemma|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/rising-star-producers-consulted-mathematicians-707878|author=Michael O'Connell|periodical=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media|Guggenheim Digital Media]]|date=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Rising Star' Producers On How Interactive Talent Show Will Tackle U.S.' 4 Time Zones|url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/05/rising-star-producers-on-how-interractive-talent-show-will-tackle-u-s-4-time-zones/|author=Nellie Andreeva|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Academy Awards]], up until the early 21st century, was the only major U.S. entertainment television event to have been aired to all continental U.S. time zones, but with a tape delay for viewers in Hawaii. Beginning the late 2000s, however, several award shows, such as the [[Golden Globes Awards]] and [[Billboard Music Awards]], joined the Oscars in conducting the same format of live broadcasts in response to longstanding general criticisms from the multimedia industry and viewers alike on some live shows televised real-time to the East Coast but are being [[broadcast delay|tape-delayed]] for West Coast viewers, albeit the fact that some of them originate from Los Angeles area. This is to cater for viewers in the Alaskan, Pacific and Mountain time zones who have frequently complained about [[spoiler (media)|spoiler]]s made by live viewers east of the Rockies during the broadcasts.

Meanwhile, the [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] competitions beginning early 2018, aired currently by NBC, joined the Super Bowl and other major domestic and international sports telecasts in airing live in all time zones across the U.S. territories. Nowadays, most live shows are now being discussed openly at the same time online, as [[social media and television]]'s interaction reached critical mass in the current century in relation to live television, which had gained renewed importance as being "[[event television|DVR-proof]]" for ratings and social purposes amidst the decline of traditional television due to rise of [[streaming media|online streaming]] of the majority of the recent scripted series.

Until 2015, the [[Grammy Awards]] continued to air on delay for the West Coast broadcast. However, beginning the 2016 Grammys telecast, the award show's rightsholder, CBS, began to allow its stations in the Western U.S. to carry the ceremony live as long as they also carry a prime time rebroadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/01/grammys-live-west-coast.html|title=For the First Time Ever, the West Coast Can Watch the Grammys Live, Too|last=Adalian|first=Josef|date=19 January 2016|work=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2017, CBS aired the Grammys live all across the U.S. (inclusive of time zones outside the contiguous U.S.), with a required primetime encore for viewers outside the Eastern and Central time zones. The Grammys continued to use the format in [[60th Annual Grammy Awards|2018]] in coincidence with its broadcast source transfer from Los Angeles to New York, making it the first major award show to have aired live across all U.S. time zones.

Although the [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], currently aired on rotation by ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC, began airing live coast-to-coast in the U.S. in 2010, the awards show followed suit with the Grammys in airing live simultaneously outside the contiguous U.S. time zones with CBS' telecast in 2017. As of {{CURRENTYEAR}}, the [[Tony Awards]] (which are usually broadcast live from New York City) remain the only [[EGOT (disambiguation)|major award]] show to have never conducted live coast-to-coast telecasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/88596-when-will-the-tonys-air-on-the-west-coast-heres-exactly-when-you-can-watch|title=When Will The Tonys Air On The West Coast?|first=Mallory|last=Carra|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some lower-tiered special music telecasts that originate from Los Angeles, such as the [[American Music Awards]], [[People's Choice Awards]] and [[Teen Choice Awards]], remain airing live in the East Coast and tape-delayed for the West Coast as their airtime is often purchased as a [[brokered programming]] arrangement, which also allows [[standards and practices]] to watch the ceremony in advance and determine cuts for profanity or content to insert a [[bleep censor]] or cut-away, and the producers cuts for time and superfluous items such as longer walks than expected by an award winner to the stage or a rare botched performance with the replacement of [[dress rehearsal]] footage. Some technically complicated ceremonies, such as the [[MTV Video Music Awards]], are usually edited before being recorded for broadcast on separate local primetime slots for both coasts.

Similarly, media coverage of [[New Year's Eve]] celebrations in [[New York City]] often leave the Central Time Zone out. ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', though produced in New York City, when broadcast on New Year's Eve took advantage of its later time slot (11:37&amp;nbsp;p.m. Central time) to lampoon this inconsistency by presenting a New Year's celebration for the Central Time Zone. In some locations, New Year's Eve celebrations held in New York might be repeatedly performed live or delayed one hour to correspond to the Central Time Zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Party Like It's 1999?|url=http://archive.southcoasttoday.com/daily/12-97/12-31-97/b01li062.htm|author=Frazier Moore|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[The Standard-Times (New Bedford)|The Standard-Times]]|publisher=The Standard-Times Company|date=December 31, 1997|accessdate=October 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; News channels such as [[CNN]] and sports channels such as [[ESPN]] that frequently broadcast live events offer a single feed that airs in all time zones. About 80 percent of the U.S. population [[East Coast bias|reside in the Central and Eastern time zones]], where the nation's largest city (and the main anchor of television programming) New York is located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oscars exec producer: 'We need to go for comedy'|url= http://www.cnn.com/2012/02/22/showbiz/tv/oscars-producer-telecast-ew/|first=Lynette|last=Rice|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|via=[[CNN]]|date=February 22, 2012|accessdate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the revived prominence of [[live television]] as a major broadcast format in the U.S. in recent decades, networks have resorted into airing live shows by repeated live performances of the telecasts, or a single telecast in real time simultaneously across U.S. time zones.

Occasionally, networks will produce and broadcast the same live event twice in one night - broadcasting once on an East Coast feed, and again on a West Coast feed three hours later. This permits more viewers to watch the broadcast live in prime time (although not all), as the show can air in its usual timeslot in all markets, but incurs the expense and difficulty of delivering two live broadcasts. In some cases, the two broadcasts may intentionally differ, prompting fans to compare notes and post scenes from each version online. While rare, the technique of multiple live broadcasts has been not uncommon for some special live episodes of scripted programs since the late 1990s, such as the ''[[30 Rock]]'' episodes "[[Live Show]]" and "[[Live from Studio 6H]]", ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'' with "[[Alive and Schticking]]", ''[[The West Wing]]'' with "The Debate", and ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'''s fourth-season debut with "Ambush".

Few regularly scheduled prime time shows, both scripted and non-scripted, and sports and non-sports in genre, have been aired to totality at the same time live across all continental U.S. time zones. This format, similar to aforementioned major awards shows, involves airing live on prime time or late night in the East Coast (and late afternoon hours or on prime time, simultaneously and respectively, on the West Coast). As of 2018, NBC remains the foremost proponent of live television, with its broadcasts of ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' being transmitted live across the contiguous U.S. states (and for the former, including for U.S. time zones outside the mainland), with a corresponding prime time or late-night encore for viewers outside the Eastern and Central time zones.

In mid-2018, ''[[American Idol]]'' became the first ever reality competition series - and first ever non-weekend regularly scheduled prime time program - in all of U.S. television to broadcast live&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://deadline.com/2018/04/american-idol-first-simulcast-will-allow-live-voting-across-the-us-1202373605/ |title=‘American Idol’ First: Simulcast Will Allow Live Voting Across The US |last=Haring|first=Bruce|date=April 23, 2018|website=Deadline Hollywood |language=en-US |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423153501/http://deadline.com/2018/04/american-idol-first-simulcast-will-allow-live-voting-across-the-us-1202373605/ |archive-date=April 23, 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in all U.S. territories upon its revival on ABC after its [[American Idol (season 15)|initial first-run finale]] on Fox in 2016, beginning with its live shows in the final stages of the competition. In this manner, viewers in both the West Coast and East Coast are enabled to both view the episodes live at the same time, with the prime time East Coast telecast coinciding with the real-time afternoon telecasts across the Pacific to Hawaii, along with real-time voting with the revealing of its results integrated at the end of the performance nights. Despite the format having been in place for the show since [[American Idol (season 14)|2015]], as part of its nationwide voting expansion, a corresponding warning for viewers outside the Eastern and Central time zones regarding the closing of the voting window will be aired upon their local prime time encore broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/american-idol-air-nationwide-live-telecasts-first-time-1104877 |title='American Idol' to Air Nationwide Live Telecasts for First Time |last=Strause|first=Jackie|date=April 23, 2018|website=The Hollywood Reporter |language=en-US |access-date=May 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on local programming===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}
Local stations and affiliates must schedule their local and [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programming around their respective network's feed. Because primetime programs on the East Coast feed are simulcast in two time zones, stations in the Central Time Zone are affected differently from those in the Eastern Time Zone. An hour of syndicated programming time (between 7:00 and 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. in the Eastern and Pacific time zones) is lost in the Central and Mountain time zones since network primetime in those areas starts at 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., forcing stations in Mountain or Central time (or in parts of both zones) to choose between airing their 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. newscast and another syndicated or locally produced program or airing shows in "blocks" preferred by syndicators (for example, ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' and ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' together or ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' and ''[[The Insider (TV series)|The Insider]]'' together).

The most common set of programming chosen by stations aligned with the [[Big Three television networks]] (ABC, CBS and NBC) is to air a local newscast at 5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., national news at 5:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., another local newscast at 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. and syndicated programming at 6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., though some Fox stations that maintain a newscast schedule comparable to stations tied to the Big Three (commonly stations that were former ABC, NBC and CBS affiliates themselves) carry a 60- or 90-minute block of news from 5:00 to 6:00 (or 6:30) p.m. with an additional half-hour of local news in the 5:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. timeslot as Fox does not air a national evening newscast; a few stations not affiliated with the Big Four networks, such as WGN-TV, KTLA in Los Angeles and [[WJXT]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], [[Florida]], follow a similar scheduling format with their early evening newscasts. Most Big Three affiliates in the Eastern and Pacific time zones follow this early evening newscast model as well, running a 90-minute block of news from 5:00 to 6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., particularly if they run a network's national evening newscast at 6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time. Some stations, regardless of time zone, even show a newscast from 6:00 to 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., which if run on a network station in the Central or Mountain time zones would lead into primetime network programming. Some television stations (such as [[WKYC]] and [[WJW (TV)|WJW]] in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], or [[WJAR]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Rhode Island]]) have recently begun using the fact that primetime in the Eastern Time Zone begins at 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. to their advantage by carrying a newscast during the 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. hour, generally in order to attract viewers who work longer days and cannot return home to watch a 5:00 or 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. newscast.

Many stations that do not carry a newscast in the 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. timeslot in the Central Time Zone (commonly [[Independent station (North America)|independent stations]] and most affiliates of non-historical networks like Fox – which has some stations that air a 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. newscast, though this is not entirely commonplace – [[The CW]] and [[MyNetworkTV]]) air situation comedies or other types of syndicated programming, such as [[reality television|reality series]] or game shows, during that hour. Many stations in the Central Time Zone tend to air one or both parts of the syndicated block at 5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. or even earlier. Another more recent dilemma of the 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. primetime start is that a combination of longer commutes and work hours than in the past have caused many people to not come home from work until after 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., cutting into the potential ratings of shows that start at this time. Of course, the reverse is also true since simultaneous broadcasts offer viewers the chance to watch "prime time television" without having to stay awake until 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.

[[Local programming]] such as [[news broadcasting#television|locally produced newscasts]] are not typically affected as many stations air their morning newscast at 4:00, 4:30, 5:00 or 5:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., and their early evening newscasts at 5:00 and/or 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.; however, the late evening newscast is affected due to the differences in time between time zones, meaning that if the late local news starts at 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Central time on one network station, an affiliate of the same network in the Eastern Time Zone airs its newscast at 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.; network evening newscasts on CBS, ABC, and NBC are affected since they are usually scheduled to air at 6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time (barring preemption due to network sports coverage or at the discretion of the local station, breaking news or [[severe weather]] coverage) in order to sync up with its simultaneous broadcast in the Central Time Zone. Midday newscasts are not necessarily affected, depending on whether the station's affiliated network schedules their daytime lineup simultaneously in the Eastern and Central Time Zones (as with ABC and CBS) or just to the Eastern Time Zone first (as with NBC). The late night program lineups on ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox are also similarly timeshifted, airing a half-hour later (after a newscast or syndicated programming if the station does not run news programming) but are shifted due to the time zone differences (a bigger issue with first-run late night programs that air after 12:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time since the later start time may subject these programs to a potentially decreased audience). Many Fox, CW and MyNetworkTV affiliates, and some independent stations carry a prime time newscast that is similarly affected by the timeshifting of the prime time schedule, meaning that if said late evening newscast starts at 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Mountain Time on one network station, an affiliate of the same network in the Pacific time zone would air its news at 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15845">'''Electronic visit verification''' (often referred to as "'''EVV'''") was patented and invented by a nurse who also is a technologist, entrepreneur and Home Health Care Consultant and Domain Expert.  In 1996 Michelle Boasten, RN designed and created the first clinical documentation information system for Home Health, Home Care and Hospice.  EVV was one part of an overall and comprehensive design for the industry that sits under the umbrella term of "Home Health Care".  Her invention and work are well documented.  The exhaustive patent can be reviewed at the [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=boasten&amp;OS=boasten&amp;RS=boasten US Patent and Trademark website].  

In 1999, Thomas Hoyer, the senior and Chief Policy Maker for Post-Acute Regulations for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS, formerly HCFA) invited Michelle Boasten, RN to the Baltimore CMS offices to demonstrate EVV.  At that meeting, he congratulated the invention and predicted that it would take two decades to see EVV legislation requiring EVV to be mandated as a practice within every Medicare and Medicaid agency providing publicly funded home visits to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Mr. Hoyer's testimony regarding his work in Post-Acute Regulatory Policy can be found in the [https://www.cms.gov/About-CMS/Agency-Information/History/downloads/cmsoralhistory.pdf CMS Oral History Project] that documents the design and implementation of all Medicare and Medicaid Regulations.  This 874-page document at the CMS Website helps to explain to any reader the history of Medicare and Medicaid's design by those who created, drafted and authored the system.

Recognizing that EVV was a critical part of the entire documentation process, the patent covers the entire scope of the work.  EVV has been sectioned out because of its enormous impact on bringing accountability to the industry.  Indeed EVV is a method used to verify visit activity for Home Health (Skilled Service), Home Care (Personal Care Service) and Hospice (End-of-life Service) .  This accountability measure will help to ensure that patients are not neglected.  EVV can and should cut down on fraudulently documented home visits, and is the means of electronically verifying that a caregiver is physically present with the patient. EVV monitors locations of caregivers and is mandated by certain states, including [[Texas]] and [[Illinois]].&lt;ref name=IWeekGPSCuts&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diana|first1=Alison|title=GPS Cuts Fraud, Costs For Home Healthcare|url=http://www.informationweek.com/healthcare/gps-cuts-fraud-costs-for-home-healthcare/d/d-id/1317202|accessdate=3 April 2015|publisher=Information Week|date=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other states do not mandate it, but use it as part of its Medicaid fraud oversight created by the passing of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]] in 2010.&lt;ref name=GTechExpansion/&gt; It is also widely used by employers of home healthcare providers to verify employee's locations and hours of work as well as document patient care. Today, most states and other payers rely on EVV as a more effective monitoring tool than a hand-signed document.

[https://evvworkgroup.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/caring-july-2011-evd-maximizes-service-effectiveness.pdf Electronic Visit Documentation | Caring Magazine Article]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://evvworkgroup.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/caring-july-2011-evd-maximizes-service-effectiveness.pdf|title = Electronic Visit Documentation|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Caring Magazine July-2011|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While verification of a visit using EVV (''Electronic Visit Verification'') is important, it doesn’t universally address the scope of the data set that is collected or the timely integration with the provider’s EMR system. EVD (''Electronic Visit Documentation'') includes EVV-related date, time, and location, but also services, tasks, and other discipline specific information that makes up a complete record of the patient encounter.

Because EVD solutions integrate tightly with a provider’s EMR system, timely management of field staff can occur, enabling providers to effectively respond to scheduling, clinical, or service exceptions. EVD also yields precise  productivity reporting, efficient payroll processing, and generates accurate,and timely claims.

This article, published in Caring Magazine in July, 2011, describes how EVD can help facilitate a proactive approach to combating fraud and abuse and discusses payer models that best enable home health agencies to provide accurate, accountable services.

==History==
[[File:U.S. healthcare GDP.gif|thumb|left|Healthcare spending in the United States as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP).]]
Electronic visit verification was created to help cut down on fraud and ensure that people receive the documented care they need.

Electronic visit verification is widely used throughout the healthcare industry, not solely by government entities. Companies use it for compliance and quality assurance. Employers of home healthcare providers use it to verify employee's locations as well as document patient care. It can also be used to verify hours of work and document time sheets for healthcare workers.

==Health care fraud==
{{main|Health care fraud}}
'''Health care fraud''' includes health insurance fraud, [[drug fraud]], and [[quackery|medical fraud]]. Health insurance fraud occurs when a company or an individual defrauds an insurer or government health care program, such as [[Medicare (United States)]] or equivalent State programs. The manner in which this is done varies, and persons engaging in fraud are always seeking new ways to circumvent the law. Damages from fraud can be recovered by use of the [[False Claims Act]], most commonly under the ''[[qui tam]]'' provisions which rewards an individual for being a "[[whistleblower]]", or [[relator (law)]].&lt;ref name="DOJHealthCareFraudReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/tne/health_care.html|title=Department of Justice|publisher=Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tracking software==
Electronic visit verification is mainly done through the use of [[GPS tracking unit|GPS tracking]] and computer software. It can also include the use of telephone based systems where healthcare workers can call-in from each location.&lt;ref name=CDispatLicense/&gt; GPS can be used to track the location of nurses, or a "check-in" system can be used requiring healthcare providers to clock in when they are at a home visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=State News: Medicaid Bill Headed For Florida Senate Floor|url=http://kaiserhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/state-health-round-up-2/|accessdate=3 April 2015|publisher=Kaiser Health News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electronic Signature ===
Using an EVV solution whether a mobile device or a home telephone in electronic based visit verification caregivers authenticate themselves by entering in their unique ID and password. This ID and password are known and controlled ONLY by the caregiver. The combination of this unique ID and the calling from the patient’s phone creates this electronic signature. Some EVV companies also utilize 2-Factor security requiring yet a 3rd randomly generated code that users receive on a special One-Time password device or key chain.

=== Automatic Number Identification ===
Some companies use  Automatic Number Identification (ANI) technology in order to capture the exact address of a landline phone call and the  patient’s telephone number. This is the same technology that the E-911 people use because it cannot be blocked and it is delivered electronically to the system with the phone call. This allows it to be 100% reliable. The system also time-stamps every call with the exact time the call was made.

=== Automatic Patient Identification ===
Some EVV systems uses the telephone number captured from the telephone company to match the patient’s telephone number that is stored in the patient’s profile record in the database. With this match, the caregiver does not have to know or key in the patient-ID.

ANI enables EVV companies to capture the billing telephone number of patients even if the patient uses caller ID blocking because ANI delivers information electronically. This ensures that the system is 100% reliable in reporting patients’ locations. The system also time-stamps the arrival and departure calls every caregiver makes. In addition, the system uses the telephone number captured from the telephone company to match the patient’s telephone number stored in the patient’s record in your database. This feature of the  system means that when caregivers call  to report data, they don’t have to key in the ID number of patients.

=== Electronic Visit Verification Integration with Back-end systems such as EMR scheduling, billing and clinical systems ===
While '''EVV''' is used by employers to track employees and determine their compensation and to verify payroll of its caregivers and nurses.&lt;ref name="IWeekGPSCuts" /&gt;  synchronizing key information pertinent to the visit in an almost real-time manner. This allows the caregiver to have the most up-to-date information available to them when they call in to document the visit. Collecting EVV and EVD data is very important, but once the data is collected, it has to be entered into the EMR system for documentation, billing and payroll. This is where some EVV companies like take EVV to the next level, integrating with over a dozens of the major EMR companies to seamlessly pass the collected EVV and EVD data automatically to the backend billing and payroll system.  Tight integration for a seamless process is helpful in reducing the number of manual touch points a visit has to go before it can be billed.

Some of the enhance features that EVV providers offer when integrating with back-end EMR systems can include:
*	Imports changed employees, patients, schedules and patient care plans into the system automatically.
*	Sends completed visit information, including care plan results, to the system so that the completed visit can be verified, attended and billed.
*	Delivers visit information to the EMR within minutes of the visit being completed.

Electronic visit verification software integrates with payroll systems that allow companies to employ a cloud-based system that integrates with a mobile app to coordinate schedules, billing, payroll, communication, and patient documentation.&lt;ref name="DNewsDigital"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cho|first1=Hanah|title=Digital and mobile startups are fueling health care innovation in Dallas|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20130615-digital-and-mobile-startups-are-fueling-health-care-innovation-in-dallas.ece|accessdate=3 April 2015|publisher=Dallas News|date=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nurses can update patient files with the system while also submitting working hours to their employers.&lt;ref name="DNewsDigital" /&gt; In contrast, other companies provide a telephone and computer-based system for verification,&lt;ref name="AdvocateLousiana" /&gt; similar to the system implemented in the state of Texas in 2015.&lt;ref name="BHearldGarza"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Garza|first1=Christina R.|title=State phases in new home health verification system|url=http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/premium/article_05fcb60e-0977-11e4-aa2f-0017a43b2370.html|accessdate=3 April 2015|publisher=The Brownsville Herald|date=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Enga-based pidgin is used by speakers of [[Arafundi languages]].

== History ==
The Enga contain more than 150,000 people that occupy the mountainous region ranging from [[Mount Hagen]] and westward to [[Porgera]]. Enga people are known to be sedentary gardeners that grow sweet potatoes as their staple crop. Coffee and pyrethrum are also grown as cash crops in their culture and they also keep pigs, cattle, and fowls. Pigs, pearls, shells, axes, and plumes are items of wealth and signify social occasions when exchanged or circulated. Enga clans have an definite boundaries defining their homesteads across the territory and have been known to fight with each other over land, women, and vengeance. Men and women traditionally occupy different homes because it it believed that women are unclean and can be dangerous to men. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Enga culture does not include a chief or headman, but instead the wealthy men have the political and administrative control. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Enga Dictionary with English Index|last=Lang|first=Adrianne|publisher=Linguistic Circle of Canberra|year=1973|isbn=0858830930|pages=xi-xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Enga alphabet includes 21 different letters, only two of which not being in the English alphabet. 

== Grammar ==

=== Nouns ===
Like the [[American English|English]] language, Enga nouns use the determiners ''dóko'' and ''méndé'' as ''the'' and ''a, some, or else'' respectively. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Semantics of Classificatory Verbs in Enga (And Other Papua New Guinea Languages)|last=Lang|first=Adrianne|publisher=Linguistics Circle of Canberra|year=1975|isbn=085883123|pages=23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akáli dóko epe-ly-á-mo.

''man   the    come-''PRES

''The man is coming.''

Akáli méndé epe-ly-á-mo.

''man     a     come-PRES''

''A man is coming.'' 

[[Noun class|Noun classes]] in Enga have not been studied in great detail just yet, however it is shown to be based primarily on syntactic features. These classes include animates, pronouns, body parts, inanimates, locationals, events, colors, inner states, and minor classes. Nouns may also be inflected for cases such as agentive ''AG ,'' instrumental ''INST,'' possessive ''POSS,'' locative ''LOC'', and temporal. In the chart below it shows the case distribution and the noun classes in relation to one another. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Animates''' can occur in different subclasses such as proper names. Some examples of animates can include ''takánge'' (father), ''endángi'' (mother), ''Aluá'' (a man's name), ''Pasóne'' (a woman's name), or ''mená'' (pig). All of which would include a determiner being either demonstrative or indefinite and can be with the agentive or possessive cases, but not used instrumentally or locative. '''Pronouns''' in the Enga language can easily be identified and can vary from dialects:

* nambá ''I''
* émba ''you''
* baá ''he, she, it''
* nalímba ''we two''
* nyalámbo ''you two''
* dolápo ''they two''
* náima ''we plural''
* nyakáma ''you plural''
* dúpa ''they plural''

These pronouns are similar to animates in that determiners may occur in agentive, and possessive cases, but not used instrumentally or locative. '''Body parts''' are in the animate class and can include words like ''kíngi'' (arm), ''pungí'' (liver), and ''yanúngí'' (skin, body). These differ from the previous classes in which they may have a determiner occur either instrumentally or locative, but not in the agentive or possessive cases. '''Location''' nouns are used to determine the place. These words can include ''kákasa'' (bush), ''Wápaka'' (Wabag- a place), or ''Lakáipa'' (Lagaipa- a river). This class only uses a determiner in the location case and nothing else.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The noun morphology of Enga is an exclusively [[Suffix|suffixing]] language. These suffixes are generally the last member of the noun phrase, being either the determiner or the adjective. This expresses the inflectional categories of the noun such as tense, aspect, person, number, gender or mood. The suffixes can be broken down into two main groups: case suffixes and others. Case suffixes are exclusively expressed in noun and noun phrases while other suffixes can be on either noun and noun phrases or verb and verb phrases.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Enga differentiates nouns from noun phrases though the case endings. There are seven different cases in which these are formally marked: associative ''-pa''(only two)/ ''-pipa'' (two or more), agentive ''-me/-mi,'' instrumental ''-me/mi,'' possessive ''-nya,'' locative ''-nya/-sa/-ka,'' temporal ''-sa/-nya/-pa,'' and vocative ''-oo.''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other suffixes, besides case suffixes, are broken into six different categories and occur only on nouns. There is the conjunctive suffix ''-pi'' meaning 'and' or 'even', two different suffixes ''-le''meaning 'rather' or ''-yalé'' 'like' to indicate similarity, two different suffixes ''-mba'' 'very' or an argumentative ''-mba'' to indicate emphasis or contrast.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These two forms of ''-mba''differ in meaning as well as tone. When it is used in a argumentative sense it is said with a higher tone than previous syllables versus when it is used to emphasize.

Although it includes conjunctive suffixes, Enga does not actually include any conjunction words such as 'and' other than ''pánde'' 'or'. Instead those conjunctive suffixes are used to combine the noun or noun phrase with the all the noun phrases and then typically followed by the determiner.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Verbs ===
The verb morphology of Enga is an incredibly complex concept in the grammar of the language. This is due to the lack of subordinating or coordinating conjunctions such as 'and' or 'because', the lack of modal auxiliaries such as 'can' or 'want', and the lack of prepositions such as 'for' or 'to'. Instead, Enga uses a nearly unlimited number of concepts and kinds of actions expressed through different grammatical devices. The verb is known to dominate the Enga language.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The main verb of a sentenced is always expressed at the end. When there is a question, the suffix ''-pe/-pi''  will occur at the end. 

Akáli dokó-mé mená dóko p-i-á-pe?

man   DET-AG  pig    DET hit-PAST

''Did the man hit the pig?''

Verb morphology in Enga, much like its noun morphology, is exclusively suffixing. There are two different categories in which the verb can be: person-number and tense-mode. There are five different tenses in Enga. This includes a future tense, a present tense, and three different past tenses. The immediate past refers to actions that occurred within the day. The near past refers to actions that occurred the previous day, a time in which the speaker does not recall, or a time before the previous day but is intending on comparing it to other events in the past. Finally, the far past refers to actions that occurred before the previous day.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In terms of person-number, Enga expresses both singular, and plural verbs. However, a dual is also expressed when referring to actions or events that involve exactly two characters or two actions. The verb morphology has only one exception being that verbs are expressed with a prefix ''na-.''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In sentences that express two different subjects or two different actions collectively, there unfortunately is no conjunction like most English speakers are used to. For example the sentence "He went and worked" it would expressed as the following:

Baá p-é-á.                           Baa-mé kalái p-i-á.

he   go-PAST.                      he-AG  work do-PAST.

''He went.''                              ''He worked.''

When conjoined, instead of

Baa p-e-a-pi baa-me kalai p-i-a.

It would be 

Baa-mé pá-o kalái p-i-á.

he-AG  go-O work do-PAST

''He went and worked.''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There are three different '''temporal suffixes'''. The ''-o'' marker expresses the originating, existing, or happening during the same period of time. In verbs that end in a high vowel it would be changed to a ''-u'' marker. The second temporal suffix if the ''-la''  marker which indicates consecutiveness between sentences with the same subject. Finally, the ''-pa''  marker conjoins sentences with different subjects but still contain consecutiveness. 

Baa-mé andá-ka    pitu-'''ú''' kalái pi-ly-a-mó.

she-AG house-LOC sit-'''O''' work do-PRES

''She is working while she is sitting in the house.''

Baa-mé kalái pé-ta-'''la'''         yólé ny-í-á.

he-AG   work do-COM-'''LA''' wage get-PAST

''Having done the work, he received his wage.''

Namba-mé meé                pyó-o kat-e-ó-'''pa'''              baa-mé kalái andáke p-i-á.

I-AG            for no reason do-O  stand-PAST-'''TEMP''' he-AG  work   big      do-PAST

''While I was doing nothing he did a lot of work.'' 

Or

''I did nothing and then he did a lot of work.''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There are two different '''causal suffixes''' ''-pa'' and ''-sa.'' When the verb ends in a suffixed vowel regarding the past, these two suffixes are added together to fully conjugate the verb. 

Baá-mé kalái pyá-a     ná-ep-e-a-mo-'''pa'''           nambá tánge-me kalái ná-i-o. 

he-AG   work do-INF NEG-come-PAST-'''CAUS'''    I        sefl-AG    work NEG-do-PAST

''Since he didn't come to work, I didn't work myself.''

Namba-mé kalái pyá-a     ná-ep-e-o-'''pa/sa'''           baá tánge-me kalái ná-p-i-a.

I-AG            work do-INF NEG-come-PAS-'''CAUS''' he   self-AG    work NEG-do-PAST

''Since I didn't come to work, he didn't work himself.''

Enga also includes '''conditional suffixes'''. These help distinguish what is considered 'real' conditions and 'irreal' conditions. A real condition is one in which real consequences can occur versus an irreal condition which denies the reality of the actions that are expressed as well as their consequences. To express a real conditional clause in the future tense the suffix ''-mo/-no'' are added to the verb with the addition of ''kandao dóko'' followed immediately after. For example when connecting the following two sentences: 

Akáli dóko p-é-á.

man DET go-PAST

''The man went.''

and

Énda dóko p-á-a-'''mo'''.

woman DET go-PAST-'''AUG'''.

''The woman went.''

Together, as a conditional clause, it would form:

Akáli dóko alémbo                       pá-t-a-'''mo      kanda-ó dóko''' énda    dóko wámba andípu p-á-a-'''mo'''.

man DET (day before yesterday) go-FUT-'''AUG''' '''see-O     DET''' woman DET (before today)  go-PAST-'''AUG''' 

''If the man went the day before yesterday, then the woman went earlier today.''

=== Word Order ===
The crucial difference of the Enga language is that the main verb of the sentence will always be found in sentence-final position. This concept causes varying structures based on the type of sentence. In declarative sentences that include a nominal subject and object, the subject will precede the object. This particular word order is known as subject-object-verb or SOV. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Akáli dokó-mé mená dóko p-í-á.y

man DET-AG pig DET hit-PAST

''The man hit the pig.''

The '''Global Strategic Trends Programme''' was established in 2001 to research and forecast potential trends that shape and inform the future strategic context.  It is published by the [[Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre]] (DCDC) which is under the UK's [[Joint Forces Command]] and based in [[Shrivenham]], [[Wiltshire]].

One of the main findings of "Global Strategic Trends out to 2040" is that the era out to 2040 will be a time of transition, characterised by instability both in the relations between states, and in the relations between groups within states.  During this timeframe significant global trends will include; climate change, rapid population growth, resource scarcity, a resurgence in ideology and a shift in global power from West to East.  The struggle to establish an effective system of global governance, is likely to be a central theme of the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/33717/GST4_v9_Feb10.pdf|title=Global Strategic Trends Out to 2040|publisher=Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent Mentions of Global Strategic Trends==

The analysis conducted in Global Strategic Trends was recently highlighted in the UK Public Administration Select Committee Report on Who does UK National Strategy?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmpubadm/435/435.pdf |title=UK Public Administration Select Committee Report on ''Who does UK National Strategy?''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comments included:

'''Professor Peter Hennessy''' - "''You have to have as a good a system for horizon scanning as you possibly can, with all the necessary caveats. For example, we haven’t talked about it yet, but the one that I find the most helpful was an institutionalisation of something that was done in the last defence review, the DCDC people at Shrivenham, the “Shrivenham Scans” as I call them, I find them absolutely fascinating...
''...they produced a very good one [scan], the bulk of which was made public in time for this review and, as far as I can see, it’s having no salience at all in the way the SDSR is being cut—yet another example of an own goal and being less than the sum of our parts. But I’m not defeatist in the way that you might—I suspect you’re teasing me on this because you’re not an opt out of the world man either, are you? It’s not for me to ask you questions."''''

'''Professor Hew Strachan''' - ''"Strategic trends stress those things that are likely to happen to the world, but not much of what they do really focuses on what the United Kingdom is trying to do. It’s extraordinary that DCDC is at Shrivenham, at that distance, (quite apart from the other things that have happened to it), rather than in London and central to the processes that we’re talking about. Professor Hennessy mentioned just now the publication last year of a document called “The Future Character of Conflict”, which was designed to address precisely what its title says, but its arguments are nowhere evident in current thinking in relation to strategy, let alone in relation to the Strategic Defence and Security Review."''

'''Mr Tom Mckane (Director Strategy MOD)''' - ''"As to how these documents are produced, within the department we have the benefit of the Development Concepts and Doctrine Centre, who produce long range views of the world. Their document “Global Strategic Trends” I think you are familiar with. That type of document feeds into the work of the staff at the centre of the department who are responsible for assisting ministers and the Defence Board to think about defence strategy."''

'''Recommendation in Written evidence submitted by Professor Julien Lindley-French - '''"''Cross-government structures under the NSC/Cabinet Office should ideally include a Strategy Group made up of both officials and non-government experts to build on the Stratefic Trends work of DCDC with a specific remit to establish likely forecasts and context for Intelligence and Planning."''

'''Habei''' ({{zh|哈备}}; also known as '''Mani 玛尼'''&lt;ref name="Yang"&gt;[http://www.nssd.org/articles/article_detail.aspx?id=10057023 哈备村玛尼人传统思维方式探析]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Hanoish languages|Southern]] [[Loloish language]] of [[Yunnan]], [[China]]. Hsiu (2018)&lt;ref name="Hsiu2018"&gt;Hsiu, Andrew. 2018. [https://sites.google.com/site/msealangs/home/blog/lolo-burmese Classifications of some lesser-known Lolo-Burmese languages].&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that Habei belongs to the [[Bisoid languages|Bisoid]] branch.

==Background==
Habei is spoken in only one village, namely Habei village 哈备村,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=189370 金平苗族瑶族傣族自治县者米拉祜族乡顶青村委会哈备村]&lt;/ref&gt; Zhemi Township 者米乡, [[Jinping Miao, Yao, and Dai Autonomous County]], Yunnan (''Jinping County Ethnic Gazetteer'' 2013:89, 101).&lt;ref&gt;金平苗族瑶族傣族自治县民族志1979-2010. 金平苗族瑶族傣族自治県民族宗教事務局編. 雲南民族出版社. 2013年8月. {{ISBN|9787536757028}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Habei people refer to their village as ''Kuang An'' (况安), meaning 'old village' (&lt; ''kuang'' 'village' + ''an'' 'old').&lt;ref&gt;Dao Jie [刀洁] . 2012. 哈备村:哈尼文化兼收并蓄的缩影. In ''Ethnic Today'' [今日民族], [http://c.g.wanfangdata.com.cn/periodical/jrmz/2012-9.aspx 2012(9)].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Habei still preserve traditional animist rituals.&lt;ref name="Yang"/&gt;

The Habei language has been documented by Yan (1995) and He &amp; Liu (2011).

==Names==
[[wikt:Autonym|Autonym]]s and [[exonym]]s for the Habei are as follows (Yan 1995:60).
*autonym: ma³³nɛ³³ (蛮尼)
*Yao exonym: ta⁵⁵ka³³ (单嘎)
*Lahu exonym: xa⁴²pe⁵⁵ (哈背)
*Miao exonym: xa³³pe⁵³ (哈备)
*Zhuang exonym: je³³u⁵⁵ (牙乌)
*Hani exonym: xa³³pi⁵⁵, xa³³bø⁵⁵ (哈备)

==Phonology==
Habei has 32 [[syllable onset|onset]]s and 62 [[syllable rime|rime]]s (Yan 1995:67). The [[consonant inventory]] is similar to that of standard [[Hani language|Hani]] of [[Lüchun County]], but also has /f/ and /v/, which Lüchun Hani does not have. Final consonants are -p, -t, -k, -m, -n, and -ŋ.

There are 6 tones. In songs, only 4 tones are recognizable (Yan 1995:67).

[[Image:Flogging demo folsom 2004.jpg|right|thumb|200px|In this flogging demonstration at [[Folsom Street Fair]] 2004 the top is using an advanced double flogger technique.]]
'''Impact play''' is a human [[human sexual behavior|sexual practice]] in which one person (the bottom) is struck (usually repeatedly) by another person (the Top) for the sexual gratification of either or both parties. It is considered a form of [[BDSM]].

There are number of activities that qualify as impact play.

In [[erotic spanking]] the [[sub (BDSM)|sub]] is struck either with the top's open hand, or a rigid implement such a [[Paddle (spanking)|paddle]], [[Walking stick|cane]] or [[riding crop]]. In the latter case the activity is often referred to as ''paddling'', ''caning'' or ''cropping''. The usual targets for spanking are the [[buttock]]s and inner or outer [[thigh]]s.

In erotic [[flagellation]] the [[sub (BDSM)|sub]] is struck with a flexible implement such a [[whip]] or [[belt (clothing)|belt]]. Whips are classified by how many ''falls'' they have:

* ''Single tails'' such as a [[bullwhip]] have a single fall. The associated activity is referred to as ''single tailing''.
* ''Floggers'', such as a [[cat o' nine tails]] have many falls. The associated activity is referred to as ''flogging''.
[[File:Waiting by Balzac.png|thumb|left|A rendered portrait of a woman about to be [[flogged]].]]

For safety, impact play should be done on areas of the human body well protected by fat or muscle; spots to avoid include the kidneys, neck, tailbone, hipbones, the head and all joints. The usual targets for flagellation are the buttocks and the two areas of the upper back below the [[shoulder blade]]s. With care, the thighs, the backs of the calves and the chest can be targets as well. Breasts are another potential, but high-risk, target and should only be used with experience.

The use of a whip means that the Top must take great care to hit the intended target area, and avoid ''wrapping''; when a whip or flogger makes contact with the target area somewhere up its length and the remaining length wraps around the [[sub (BDSM)|sub's]] body to deliver a sharp, non-erotic, and possibly injurious off-target blow, such as to the hipbones or ribs. The longer the falls, the more skill is required by the Top to land a safe blow. Advanced flogging techniques use a pair of floggers employed in a [[martial art]]s style alternating pattern, a technique commonly referred to as "florentining" or "florentine flogging."

Less common forms of impact play include [[Punch (strike)|punching]] and face [[Slapping (strike)|slapping]].

The sensations produced by impact play depend on the area in which the impact is concentrated. Wide implements such as an open hand, paddle or flogger produce a dull "thuddy" sensation. Narrow implements such as a cane, riding crop, belt or single tail produce a sharp "stingy" sensation.

A slapper or smacker may also be used.  This consists of a broad (3 to 4 inch wide) semi flexible leather paddle with rounded and tapered edges, designed to minimize the severity of tip strike.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1376">The '''Italian overture''' is a piece of [[orchestra]]l [[music]] which opened several [[opera]]s, [[oratorio]]s and other large-scale works in the late 17th and early 18th centuries.

An Italian overture typically has a three-[[movement (music)|movement]] structure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Don Michael Randel|title=The Harvard Concise Dictionary of Music and Musicians|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1999|page=486}}&lt;/ref&gt; – the outer movements are quick, the middle movement is slow.

This type of overture was particularly popular among Italian composers such as [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], and in the early 18th century would usually be called ''[[sinfonia]]''. Later, to avoid confusion with other types of sinfonia/[[symphony]], the term ''Italian overture'' was used more frequently.

The structure of the Italian overture/sinfonia was the base from which the [[Classical period (music)|classical]] [[multi-movement]] cycle - used in genres including the [[symphony]], [[concerto]], and [[sonata]] - developed around the middle of the 18th century. For more about the (18th century) relationship between ''Italian'' overtures, other types of overtures (e.g. the ''[[French overture]]'') and early symphonies, see [[sinfonia]].

'''Deve Gowda Javare Gowda'''  (6 July 1915 – 30 May 2016) was a [[Kannada language]] author also known as '''De Ja Gou''' or simply '''Javare Gowda'''. He was disciple of authors [[T.N. Srikantaiah]] and [[Kuvempu]].&lt;ref name="gowda100"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fast"/&gt; His literary career spans over decades in which he wrote over thirty-four biographies in Kannada language and other works including children's literature. He campaigned for the promotion of Kannada language. He had received [[Pampa Prashasti]] (1998), [[Padma Shri]] (2001) and the [[Karnataka Ratna]] (2008) awards for his contributions in literature and education. He became a [[centenarian]] in 2015 and died on 30 May 2016.

== Early life ==
Gowda was born on 6 July 1915 in the village called [[Chakkere]] in the [[Channapatna|Channapatna taluk]] of [[Ramanagara district]] in Karnataka state.&lt;ref name="gowda100"&gt;{{cite news|title=De. Ja. Gow. turns 100|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/de-ja-gow-turns-100/article7393416.ece|accessdate=30 May 2016|work=The Hindu|date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in a poor family and had three siblings. As his parents could not afford to educate all, only his eldest brother went to school and Gowda would graze goats. Having passion for education, Gowda would let go goats on their own and instead come and listen to teachers from outside near a school window. He recollects that on one such day when the goats entered a wealthy landlord's farm and destroyed the crop, his father beat him and the school principal then rescued him and admitted him in third standard, also providing him with uniform and books.&lt;ref name="Bharathi"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=yg-qCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=javare+gowda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjs7OifiIvNAhXEMo8KHSLJCoAQ6AEINzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=javare%20gowda&amp;f=false  |title= Ordinary Feet, Extra-Ordinary Feat |pages=47–50 |author= Dr Veena Bharathi |publisher= Vij Books India Pvt Ltd. |year= 2015 |isbn= 9789384318789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education, career and activities ==
Gowda later went on to study in Bangalore for intermediate classes and completed his BA in Mysore. He wanted to do his BA with History as his major subject but opted for Kannada when he came to know that  notable author [[Kuvempu]] would be teaching it. Gowda had admired Kuvempu's works long before getting associated with him as his student. After completing BA in 1941, he went on to do post graduates MA in Kannada. With little scope of getting a lectureship in any college, he took up a clerical job at the Secretariat in [[Vidhan Soudha]] at Bangalore. He concurrently  studied law but did not pursue it as career when he got post of Kannada lecturer at the [[Central College, Bangalore]]. After three years, he went on to teach at [[Maharaja's College, Mysore]]. Here, he again was associated with Kuvempu and later credited him for his "academic and spiritual enrichment".&lt;ref name="Bharathi" /&gt;

Gowda served as the [[Vice Chancellor]] of [[Mysore University]] from 1969 to 1975 for consecutive two terms. In his tenure as VC he started various post graduates courses in Home Sciences, Criminology, Law and Journalism at the university. He was known for his sharp criticism of the then government policies. While reappointing him as the VC for the second term, the then state governor [[Mohan Lal Sukhadia]] requested "please try to remember that when you criticize the government, do so mildly".&lt;ref name="Bharathi" /&gt; He also wished to start an Afro-Dravidian Institute of post graduate studies called "The Kuvempu Vidyavardhaka Trust", which did not happen because of inadequate  government funding.&lt;ref name="Bharathi" /&gt;

Gowda actively campaigned for promotion of Kannada language. Various encyclopaedias were published in Kannada after his efforts. Kannada was also used in examinations conducted by [[Karnataka Public Service Commission]]. He wrote over thirty-four biographies in Kannada language of eminent personalities like [[B. R. Ambedkar|Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar]], [[Ram Manohar Lohia]], [[Motilal Nehru]], [[Basaveshwara]] and more. He also wrote books for children on [[Albert Einstein]], [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Marie Curie]] and more. He published various books on Kuvempu and ''Soundarya Yogi Kuvempu'' narrates Gowda's experiences with Kuvempu.&lt;ref name="Bharathi" /&gt; In 1970 he chaired the [[Akhila Bharata Kannada Sahitya Sammelana]] which was held at Bangalore.&lt;ref name="gowda100" /&gt;

On 31 January 2006, the [[Assassination of Mahatma Gandhi|death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi]], Gowda observed a dawn-to-dusk fast seeking [[classical language]] status for Kannada. Earlier he had fasted once before for same cause and also threatened to return his [[Padma Shri]] that was conferred on him in 2001. Eventually he did not return the award as he was hopeful of a favourable reply from the then President [[A. P. J. Abdul Kalam]].&lt;ref name="fast"&gt;{{cite news|title=Javare Gowda goes on dawn-to-dusk fast|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/article3247070.ece|accessdate=31 January 2006|work=The Hindu|date=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, ex-minister [[P. G. R. Sindhia]] requested government to confer upon him the title of poet laureate (''Rashtrakavi'') for his contributions to the Kannada language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/Confer-Rashtrakavi-on-De-Javare-Gowda-Ex-minister/articleshow/38020861.cms | title=Confer Rashtrakavi on De Javare Gowda: Ex-minister | work=[[The Times of India]] | date=8 June 2014 | accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, Gowda and five others returned the Aralu Sahitya prize, awarded to them by the [[Kannada Sahitya Parishat]] and [[Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation]] in 2011, to protest the perceived delays into the investigation of writer [[M. M. Kalburgi]]'s death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Six Kannada Writers Return Awards Over Kalaburgi Probe Delay|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/Six-Kannada-Writers-Return-Awards-Over-Kalaburgi-Probe-Delay/2015/10/04/article3061276.ece|accessdate=30 May 2016|work=Indian Express|date=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Six writers to return award to Sahitya Parishat|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/six-writers-to-return-award-to-sahitya-parishat/article7717470.ece|accessdate=30 May 2016|work=The Hindu|date=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life and death ==
Gowda was married to Savithramma. Their son [[J. Shashidhar Prasad]] was also Vice Chancellor of University of Mysore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/javare-gowda-fasts-for-son-shashidhar-prasads-cause/article595441.ece | title=Javare Gowda fasts for son Shashidhar Prasad's cause | work=[[The Hindu]] | date=26 August 2010 | accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gowda became a [[centenarian]] in 2015.&lt;ref name="gowda100"/&gt; In a felicitation program organized by [[Kannada Catholic Christian Association]] on the occasion, he mentioned that he had been worshipping [[Jesus Christ]] for past 25 years and had no faith in Hindu Gods as the religion is based on "discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/De-Ja-Gow-Ive-No-Faith-in-Hindu-Gods/2015/08/31/article3002588.ece | title=De Ja Gow: I've No Faith in Hindu Gods | work=[[Indian Express]] | date=31 August 2015 | accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in [[Mysore]] on 30 May 2016 from heart failure at the Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research where he was admitted on 28 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Javare Gowda passes away|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/javare-gowda-passes-away/article8668258.ece|accessdate=30 May 2016|work=The Hindu|date=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His last rites were performed at the Kuvempu Trust, Mysore. His body was [[Lying in repose|laid in repose]] at his residence in Jayalakshmipuram and at the Chandrakala Hospital. Politicians and writers like [[H. D. Deve Gowda]], [[H. D. Kumaraswamy]], [[S. M. Krishna]] and [[M. Veerappa Moily]] paid tributes to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/de-ja-gow-laid-to-rest/article8675499.ece | title=Kannada writer Javare Gowda laid to rest | work=[[The Hindu]] | date=1 June 2016 | accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and accolades ==
Gowda received his first doctorate in 1975 from the [[Karnatak University]], Dharwad. In 1998, he received doctorate from [[Mysore University]] and in 2006 an honorary doctorate was accorded to him by the [[Kuvempu University]] at Shimoga. He also received [[Nadoja Award]] conferred by the [[Hampi University]].&lt;ref name="Bharathi" /&gt; On his centenary, a 30-minutes documentary was made by director [[Kesari Harvoo]] for the Department of Kannada and Culture.&lt;ref name="gowda100" /&gt;

'''John Strugnell''' (May 25, 1930, [[Chipping Barnet|Barnet]], [[Hertfordshire]], [[England]] &amp;ndash; November 30, 2007, [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]) became, at 23, the youngest member of the team of scholars led by [[Roland de Vaux]], formed in 1954 to edit the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] in [[Jerusalem]]. He was studying Oriental languages at [[Jesus College, Oxford]] when Sir [[Godfrey Rolles Driver]], a lecturer in [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] philology, nominated him to join the Scrolls editorial team.

Although Strugnell had no previous experience in [[palaeography]], he learned very quickly how to read the scrolls. He would be involved in the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] project for more than 40 years.&lt;ref name=bar&gt;Sidnie White Crawford, [http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/archaeology-today/archaeologists-biblical-scholars-works/john-strugnell-1930-2007/ "John Strugnell (1930–2007)" Obituary], ''Bible History Daily'', [[Biblical Archaeology Society]] (11 December 2007). Retrieved 22-11-2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Strugnell was educated at [[St Paul's School (London)|St. Paul's School]], in [[London]]. He took a double first in [[Classics]] and Semitics at the [[University of Oxford]] but never finished his dissertation and had only a master's degree.

Despite not having completed his doctorate, Strugnell was given a position at the [[Oriental Institute, Chicago|Oriental Institute of Chicago]] in 1956-1957, where he met his future wife, Cecile Pierlot, whose father had been [[Prime Minister]] of [[Belgium]] during the [[Second World War]]. He was away from his scrolls again from 1960 to 1967, bow at [[Duke University]], but he returned in summers to continue his efforts in Jerusalem. Still without his doctorate, as he would be for the rest of his life, Strugnell served from 1966 to 1991 as [[Professor]] of [[Christian]] Origins at [[Harvard]].&lt;ref name=times&gt;''[[The Times]]'' obituary December 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He succeeded Pierre Benoit as editor-in-chief of the scrolls in 1984, a position he held until 1990. He was then responsible for bringing [[Elisha Qimron]] and [[Emanuel Tov]] to work on the scrolls, breaking the longstanding exclusion of Israeli scholars.&lt;ref name=bar/&gt; At the same time, he kept [[Theodor Gaster]] and [[Robert Eisenman]] from having access to the scrolls, a situation that was rectified when Strugnell was removed from his post and the scrolls (such as those at the [[Huntington Library]] in California) were opened to the wider scholarly community for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;John Noble Wilford, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/us/09strugnell.html "John Strugnell, Scholar Undone by His Slur, Dies at 77,"] ''The New York Times'' (December 9 2007). Retrieved 22-11-2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Noble Wilford, [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/19/us/open-dead-sea-scrolls-stir-up-new-disputes.html?pagewanted=print&amp;src=pm "Open, Dead Sea Scrolls Stir Up New Disputes,"] ''The New York Times'' (April 19 1992). Retrieved 22-11-2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editor in Chief==
[[File:johnstrugnell2.jpg|Strugnell working in the 'Scrollery'|thumb|right]] 
His production of editions of texts was not large, but they were all exceptionally important, including ''The Angelic Liturgy'', later published as ''Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifices'' (Shirot 'olat ha-Shabbat), and ''An Unpublished halakhic Letter from Qumran'', later known as MMT [or [[4QMMT]]] from the Hebrew (Miqtsat Ma'asei ha-Torah). The last text was edited with [[Elisha Qimron]], who did much of the work. The texts helped to enrich scholarly knowledge of the cultus of the writers of the Dead Sea Scrolls.

Nevertheless, he was a slow worker and the times had changed since it had been acceptable to keep the scrolls protected from what was once considered misuse and hasty publication.

For many years, scholars had accepted the lack of access to unpublished texts and the slow publication of the texts. That changed during Strugnell's editorship, as there came a growing movement of scholars calling for access to the Scrolls. By then, his health had deteriorated. Only one volume was produced under his general editorship, ''The Greek Minor Prophets Scroll from Nahal Hever'', by [[Emanuel Tov]].

==''Ha'aretz'' interview controversy==
In 1990, Strugnell gave an interview to ''[[Ha'aretz]]'' in which he said that Judaism was a "horrible religion" which "should not exist". He also said that Judaism was "a Christian heresy, and we deal with our heretics in different ways. You are a phenomenon that we haven't managed to convert — and we should have managed".&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2013}} 

There was immediate condemnation of his comments, including an editorial in the ''[[New York Times]]''. As a result of the interview, Strugnell was forced to take early retirement on medical grounds at Harvard,&lt;ref name=times/&gt; and he was finally removed from his editorial post on the scrolls project, the Antiquities Authority, which cited his deteriorating health as reason for his removal.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F2061FF63B580C728CDDA80894D9494D81&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fD%2fDead%20Sea%20Scrolls "Scrolls' Editor Is Formally Dismissed,"] ''[[The New York Times]]'' (January 1, 1991). Retrieved 22-11-2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Strugnell later said that he was suffering from stress-induced alcoholism and manic depression when he gave the interview. He insisted that his remarks were taken out of context and that he meant "horrible" only in the [[John Milton|Miltonian]] sense of "deplored in antiquity". In a 2007 interview in ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]'', [[Frank Moore Cross]] said that despite Strugnell's comments, which were based on a [[theology|theological]] argument of the [[Patristic|early Church Fathers]] that [[Christianity]] superseded [[Judaism]], Strugnell had very friendly relationships with a number of Jewish scholars, some of whom signed a letter of support for him which was published in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', January 4, 1991, p. N20.

==Aftermath==
Strugnell had come increasingly under controversy for his slow progress in publishing the scrolls, and his refusal to give scholars free access to the unpublished scrolls. Some{{Who|date=November 2009}} argue the removal of Strugnell from his editorial post ended the more than three-decade blockade that he and other Harvard-educated scholars, such as Notre Dame's [[Eugene Ulrich]], had maintained to keep other scholars from accessing the scrolls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19910922&amp;slug=1306832 'Copies Of Dead Sea Scrolls To Go Public -- Release Would End Scholars' Dispute' - ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' 22 September 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;  The blockade on the publication of the scrolls effected by Strugnell and other members of Harvard's academic community was broken by the combined efforts of [[Hershel Shanks]] of the ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]'' (who had personally waged a 15-year campaign to release the scrolls) and Ben Zion Wacholder of [[Hebrew Union College]], along with his student, Martin Abegg, who published the first facsimile of the suppressed scrolls in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;James R. Adair, Jr, [http://rosetta.reltech.org/TC/vol01/Adair1996.html "Old and New in Textual Criticism: Similarities, Differences, and Prospects for Cooperation,"] '' A Journal of Biblical Textual Criticism'' (1996)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Strugnell insisted that he tried to publish the scrolls as quickly as he could but that his team was the limiting factor.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Shortly after Strugnell was dismissed from his post, he was institutionalized in [[McLean Hospital]] for a period.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} At the time of his death, he was Professor [[Emeritus]] at the [[Harvard Divinity School]].

==Strugnell Library==
In 2003, [[City Seminary]] of [[Sacramento]] acquired Strugnell's library of over 4,000 volumes, including texts on [[Hebrew]], [[Aramaic]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Ethiopic]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]]; large sections on classical studies, [[Patristics]] ([[Early Church]] writings), [[apocryphal]], and [[pseudepigraphal]] (falsely-attributed) literature; and books on [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]], and [[New Testament]] studies. A highlight of the collection is Strugnell's personal copy of the Dead Sea Scrolls ''[[concordance (publishing)|concordance]]''.

The '''kelson''' or '''keelson'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dictionary.com/browse/keelson|title = the definition of keelson|website = Dictionary.com|access-date = 2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the member which, particularly in a wooden vessel, lies parallel with its [[keel]] but above the transverse members such as timbers, frames or in a larger vessel, floors. It is fastened to the keel partly to impart additional longitudinal stiffness to it but principally to bind the longitudinal members (keel and hog) to the transverse members (frames and floors).

== Overview ==
{{Unreferenced|section|date=May 2016}}

In an open boat it is often fastened to the keel and hog in such a way that it can be removed for maintenance. Again, it lies above the boat's frames or timbers as they cross the hog but in this instance, its main function is frequently to provide a means of holding down the bottom boards in such a way that they can easily be removed for maintenance.  The keelson of an open boat is normally arranged to be flush with the bottom boards so as to reduce the chance of the crew's tripping over it.

In an open boat or in a larger vessel, the hog is the structural member which lies immediately above the keel to which it is permanently and securely fastened so that the two form one member to which the lowest [[strake]]s (the garboard strakes) are fastened.

== References ==

* [[Walt Whitman]] refers to a kelson in "[[Song of Myself]]" with the line, "and that a kelson of the creation is love,"
** This line forms the basis of the song "K is for Kelson" by [[Bibio]], from the album [[Mind Bokeh]].
* [[Herman Melville]] refers to a kelson in Chapter 9 of ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' with the line, "Is not the main-truck higher than the kelson is low?"

The '''Kutenai language''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|uː|t|ən|eɪ|,_|-|i}}), also '''Kootenai''', '''Kootenay''', '''Ktunaxa''', and '''Ksanka''', is the native language of the [[Kutenai]] people of [[Montana]] and [[Idaho]] in the United States and [[British Columbia]] in Canada.&lt;ref name="aljazeera" /&gt; It is typically considered a [[language isolate]], unrelated to the Salishan family of languages spoken by neighboring tribes on the coast and in the interior Plateau. The Kutenai also speak ''ʾa·qanⱡiⱡⱡitnam'', Ktunaxa Sign Language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Auld|first1=Francis|title=ʾa·qanⱡiⱡⱡitnam|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/19608956304/|website=Facebook|accessdate=22 June 2017|language=Ktunaxa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Kutenai is typically considered a [[language isolate]]. There have been attempts to place Kutenai in either a Macro-[[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] or Macro-[[Salishan languages|Salishan]] language family, most recently with Salish,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but they have not been generally accepted as proven.&lt;ref&gt;Marianne Mithun. ''The Languages of Native North America'' (1999, Cambridge).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyle Campbell. ''American Indian Languages: The Historical Linguistics of Native America'' (1997, Oxford).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typology==
Like other languages in the area, Kutenai has a rich inventory of consonants and a small inventory of vowels, though there are [[allophone]]s of the three basic phonemic vowels. The lack of a phonemic distinction between [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] and voiceless consonants is much as in other languages of the area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because Kutenai is on the periphery of this linguistic area, the loss of a rich lateral inventory is consistent with other nearby languages, which now have only one or two lateral consonants. One such language group contains the [[Sahaptian languages]], which have had a similar loss of laterals. [[Nez Perce language|Nez Perce]] has {{IPA|/ts/}}, believed to be the lateral affricate in the proto-language. Nez Perce, like Kutenai, lies in the eastern periphery of the Northwest Linguistic area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Another typological analysis investigates the lexical category of [[preverb]]s in Kutenai. This lexical category distinguishes neighboring [[Algonquian languages]], found to the east of the Kootenay Rocky Mountains and near the Kutenai linguistic area.&lt;ref&gt;Dryer, Matthew S. 2002. "A comparison of Preverbs in Kutenai and Algonquian." In D. Pentland (Ed.), ''Proceedings of the Thirtieth Algonquian Conference'' (pp. 63-94). Winnipeg: University of Manitoba.&lt;/ref&gt; Another typological relationship Kutenai could have is the presence of its [[obviative|obviation]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Dryer, Matthew S. 2007. "Kutenai, Algonquian, and the Pacific Northwest from an areal perspective." In H. Wolfart (Ed.), ''Proceedings of the Thirty-Eighth Algonquian Conference'' (pp. 155-206). Winnipeg: University of Manitoba.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dryer, Matthew S. 1992. "A comparison of the obviation systems of Kutenai and Algonquian." ''Papers of the 23rd Algonquian Conference''. Ottawa: Carleton.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==

As of 2012, the Ktunaxa people in Canada are working on a language revitalization effort.&lt;ref name = "aljazeera"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tribal councils from the separate communities of the Ktunaxa nation have contributed a selection of audio recordings of Kutenai words and phrases to the [http://www.firstvoices.com/en/Ktunaxa FirstVoices] website, an online catalogue of the indigenous languages of North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| title = FirstVoices: Ktunaxa Community Portal
| accessdate = 2012-07-08
| url = http://www.firstvoices.com/en/Ktunaxa
}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 2017, the Ktunaxa webpage had 2500 words and 1114 phrases archived, stories and songs recorded, a language learning app available, and First Voices tutor. The FirstVoices Tutor provides lessons and practices in the given language. The Ktunaxa Language app, accessible for iOS devices, is a Ktunaxa dictionary which uses the audio recordings of words and phrases, and provides flashcards with audio, of the vocabulary found on the FirstVoices website.The Ktunaxa nation aims to target younger generations with the FirstVoices materials to teach fluency in the Kutenai language.&lt;ref&gt; Pagliaro, J. 2010. "Technology gives dying languages voice." ''Geolinguistics'' 37: 114-116.&lt;/ref&gt; 

One such example is the ʔaq̓amcommunity of the Ktunaxa Nation, also known as St.Mary's band in Cranbrook B.C, which has a private elementary school called the ʔaq̓amnikSchool. This school, as well as providing standard BC curriculum, teaches the Ktunaxa language and cultural traditions of the people to younger generations. It also has an after school program and a program called Headstart, which helps adults of children up to the age of six learn about teaching the Ktunaxa culture and language to their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aqam.net/services/education-services/%CA%94aq%CC%93amnik%E2%80%99-school|title=ʔaq̓amnik’ School {{!}} aq'am|website=www.aqam.net|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation have founded the [[Salish Kootenai College]], a tribal college on the Flathead reservation in Pablo, Montana. The college offers a certificate program in Native American studies, which requires that students have knowledge of the history and culture of the Salish and Ktunaxa people. The curriculum also offers classes in basic Kutenai language pronunciation and grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Salish Kootenai College | accessdate = 2016-11-11 | url = https://www.skc.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources suggest that the knowledge and preservation of the native communities culture will contribute to the preservation of the communities language, but there is no evidence yet from the Salish Kootenai College to support this claim.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Louise B. 1997. "Tribal College Curricula as Evidence for the Contemporary Use of Indigenous Languages in North America." ''Geolinguistics'' 23: 61-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rocky Mountain College of British Columbia's main campus is in Crancrook B.C on the territory of the Ktunaxa people. As such, the college has collaborated with the Ktunaxa people for 40 years as of 2015. As well as offering indigenous studies classes, the Rocky Mountain College offers basic Ktunaxa classes online, KTUN-101 and KTUN-102, using the FirstVoices website as the primary learning resource. They also offer a Ktunaxa Workshop for beginner learners providing basic phrases and pronunciation, and cultural information of the Ktunaxa people.

==History of description==

The first grammar of Kutenai was compiled by [[Roman Catholic]] missionary Philippo Canestrelli, and was published in 1894 in [[Latin language|Latin]].&lt;ref name=canestrelli1894grammar&gt;{{Cite book
| last = Canestrelli

}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Online text here)

In 1918 Franz Boas published The Kutenai Tales, a transcription and translation of multiple Ktunaxa stories. The stories were gathered by Alexander F. Pierce in 1891 and Boas in 1914 , and told by members of the Ktunaxa people including Andrew Pierre, Numan Pierre, Joe Mission, Andrew Felix, and the major contributor from the community, a man referred to as Barnaby.

Paul L. Garvin did various descriptive work describing the [[phonemics]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and [[syllabification]] in Ktunaxa. He also has two sources of transcriptions of speakers talking.&lt;ref&gt;Garvin, Paul L. 1948. "Kutenai III: Morpheme Distributions (Prefix, Theme, Suffix)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garvin 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 Lawrence Richard Morgan wrote a description of the Kutenai Language as his PhD dissertation through the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. This description is focused on how the language works and specifically defining the working parts of the language. Morgan's work is an exhaustive list of each [[grammatical particle]], [[morpheme]], and [[affix]], with their respective environments and their varying forms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Grammar ==
In general terms, Kutenai is an [[Agglutination|agglutinative]] language, with many grammatical functions being served by both [[prefix (linguistics)|prefixes]] and [[suffix]]es, primarily on the verb, though some affixes select nouns as well.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Mast, Susan J. 1988. "Aspects of Kutenai Morphology." Master's Thesis, University of Pittsburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned above, a distinctive feature of Kutenai is its use of an [[obviative|obviation]] system as a way to track which entities and concepts are particularly central/salient to a story being told and as a grammatical way of clarifying the roles of each entity in sentences with two third-person arguments: "Pronouns, nouns, verbs, and adverbs all take obviative markers",&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; making it particularly different from some more well-known obviation systems (like the Algonquian one, which allows for obviation only on third-person animate nouns). Kutenai also makes use of an [[direct–inverse language|inverse]] system."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Dryer, Matthew S. 1991. "Subject and Inverse in Kutenai." Occasional papers on linguistics No. 16, ''Proceedings from the American Indian Languages Conference'' edited by James E. Redden. (Conference held at the University of California at Santa Cruz.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dryer, Matthew S. 1994. "The discourse function of the Kutenai inverse." ''Voice and inversion'' 28 (1994): 65.&lt;/ref&gt; The language has an overt [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]], ''ʔin'' `to be'.

=== Syntax ===
==== Word order ====
Word order in Kutenai can be flexible in response to [[discourse analysis|discourse]] and [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] concerns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As is the case with many [[head-marking language]]s, it is rare to have both an overt subject and an overt object in a sentence since the morphology of the verb makes it clear who is acting on whom. Morgan states that if it ''is'' appropriate to express both arguments of a verb in a "neutral" context, [[Verb–object–subject|VOS]] word order is preferred; however, it also alternates with [[Verb–subject–object|VSO]] order.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The pre-verbal position can be occupied by adverbs, as seen in these three examples:

{|

|&lt;nowiki&gt;-OBV&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|
| colspan="6" |Crow loves Naʔuti.
|
|}

One aspect of Kutenai that complicates word order somewhat is the fact that the verb is marked for first- or second-person subjects by "affixal or clitic pronouns" that precede the stem, ''hu/hun'' for 'I' and ''hin'' for 'you'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is common in the orthography to write the pronouns as separate words, making it seem as if the word order is Subject Pronoun + Verb (+ Object).

==== Inverse ====
In many languages, conditions for inverse include situations in which the first or second person is in the "object" role, and the third person is the "subject" as in 'She saw you/me.' In Kutenai, however, the situations use specific "first-/second-person object" morphology, separate from the inverse.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As a consequence, Kutenai's inverse system is most clearly observable in interactions between third persons. The following two examples (from Dryer 1991) show the direct and inverse, respectively:

|
| colspan="6" |The (obviative) man saw the (proximate) woman.
|}

==== Clause typing ====
Kutenai [[Dependent clause|subordinate/dependent clauses]] are marked with a ''k'' and a lack of indicative morphology on the verb, as are questions, nominalizations, and relative clauses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ''k'' can cliticize to the material that follows it, as can be seen in this example.

Current research in laboratory phonology draws heavily on the theories of [[metrical phonology]] and [[autosegmental phonology]], and on the statistical methods of [[exploratory data analysis]].

Laboratory phonology is particularly connected with the ''[[Association for Laboratory Phonology]]'', which was founded to promote the approach.  Among the researchers associated with laboratory phonology are [[Janet Pierrehumbert]], [[Mary Beckman]], [[Patricia Keating]] and D. Robert Ladd, who co-authored a paper discussing the approach.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5534">'''Native-language identification''' ('''NLI''') is the task of determining an author's [[first language|native language]] (L1) based only on their writings in a [[second language]] (L2).&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Sze-Meng Jojo, and Mark Dras. [http://anthology.aclweb.org/D/D11/D11-1148.pdf "Exploiting parse structures for native language identification"]. Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
NLI works through identifying language-usage patterns that are common to specific L1 groups and then applying this knowledge to predict the native language of previously unseen texts.
This is motivated in part by applications in [[second-language acquisition]], language teaching and [[forensic linguistics]], amongst others.

== Overview ==
NLI works under the assumption that an author's L1 will dispose them towards particular language production patterns in their L2, as influenced by their native language. This relates to cross-linguistic influence (CLI), a key topic in the field of second-language acquisition (SLA) that analyzes transfer effects from the L1 on later learned languages.

Using large-scale English data, NLI methods achieve over 80% accuracy in predicting the native language of texts written by authors from 11 different L1 backgrounds. This can be compared to a baseline of 9% for choosing randomly.

==Applications==

===Pedagogy and language transfer===
This identification of L1-specific features has been used to study [[language transfer]] effects in second-language acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;Malmasi, Shervin, and Mark Dras. [http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D/D14/D14-1144.pdf "Language Transfer Hypotheses with Linear SVM Weights."] Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP). 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This is useful for developing pedagogical material, teaching methods, L1-specific instructions and generating learner feedback that is tailored to their native language.

===Forensic linguistics===
NLI methods can also be applied in [[forensic linguistics]] as a method of performing authorship profiling in order to infer the attributes of an author, including their linguistic background.
This is particularly useful in situations where a text, e.g. an anonymous letter, is the key piece of evidence in an investigation and clues about the native language of a writer can help investigators in identifying the source.
This has already attracted interest and funding from intelligence agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Ria Perkins. 2014. "Linguistic identifiers of L1 Persian speakers writing in English: NLID for authorship analysis". Ph.D. thesis, Aston University.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==

[[Natural language processing]] methods are used to extract and identify language usage patterns common to speakers of an L1-group. This is done using language learner data, usually from a [[learner corpus]]. Next, [[machine learning]] is applied to train classifiers, like [[support vector machine]]s, for predicting the L1 of unseen texts.&lt;ref&gt;Tetreault et al, [http://anthology.aclweb.org/C/C12/C12-1158.pdf "Native Tongues, Lost and Found: Resources and Empirical Evaluations in Native Language Identification"], In Proc. International Conf. on Computational Linguistics (COLING), 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
A range of ensemble based systems have also been applied to the task and shown to improve performance over single classifier systems.&lt;ref&gt;Malmasi, Shervin, Sze-Meng Jojo Wong, and Mark Dras. [http://anthology.aclweb.org/W/W13/W13-1716.pdf "NLI Shared Task 2013: MQ submission"]. Proceedings of the Eighth Workshop on Innovative Use of NLP for Building Educational Applications. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various linguistic feature types have been applied for this task. These include syntactic features such as constituent parses, grammatical dependencies and part-of-speech tags.
Surface level lexical features such as character, word and lemma [[n-gram|n-grams]] have also been found to be quite useful for this task. However, it seems that character n-grams&lt;ref&gt;Radu Tudor Ionescu, Marius Popescu and Aoife Cahill. [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/COLI_a_00256 "String Kernels for Native Language Identification: Insights from Behind the Curtains"], Computational Linguistics, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radu Tudor Ionescu and Marius Popescu. [https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08349 "Can string kernels pass the test of time in Native Language Identification?"], In Proceedings of BEA12, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; are the single best feature for the task.

== 2013 shared task ==
The Building Educational Applications (BEA) workshop at [[NAACL]] 2013 hosted the inaugural NLI shared task.&lt;ref&gt;Tetreault et al, [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.365.5931&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf "A report on the first native language identification shared task"], 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The competition resulted in 29 entries from teams across the globe, 24 of which also published a paper describing their systems and approaches.

'''Olexander Abramovytsch Beyderman''' ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] {{lang|uk|Олександр Абрамович Бейдерман}}, [[Scientific transliteration]] ''{{lang|uk-Latn|Oleksandr Abramovyč Bejderman}}''; also: Bejderman ; * 1949 in [[Odessa]]) is a [[USSR|Soviet]]-[[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] writer&lt;ref name="Schmalzl1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmalzl|first=Christian|title=Odessa: Kapitel aus der Kulturgeschichte|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nj0_AQAAIAAJ|accessdate=6 April 2011|year=1998|publisher=Lassleben|language=German|pages=139–143}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Jew]]ish descent. He is a lecturer of [[Hebrew]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and English philology at the University of [[Odessa]].

Beyderman writes in [[Yiddish language]], Ukrainian and [[Russian language|Russian]] and is considered to be simultaneously one of the last and more important Yiddish authors in the former areas of Russian Jews. His entree to Soviet literature took place with the assistance of literature functionaries of the time, though he was never an orthodox follower of the [[Socialist realism|dogmas of socialist realism]] and soon found his own style  combining realistic language with harsh expressiveness that outreaches the simplicity of his themes. He treats the [[Holocaust|Extermination of Jews]] in [[World War II]] as well as topics reminiscent of [[Sholem Aleichem]] and other earlier Jewish writers. His depictions range from subtle criticism of society to quasi-blasphemous [[sarcasm]]. His generation is probably the last one to use Yiddish as a literary language. His texts are read in Israel and the United States as well as in [[Ukraine]]. The editions of his novels and plays are more numerous in Russian and Ukrainian. During the last couple of years, Ukrainian has come to play a greater role in his writings.

Beyderman was a Fellow in the [[Moses Mendelssohn|Moses Mendelssohn Centre]] and works for the [[Claims Conference]].

The '''''Paharnic''''' (plural: ''Paharnici''; also known as ''Păharnic'', ''Paharnec'', or ''Păharnec''; [[Moldavian dialect]]: ''Ceașnic'',&lt;ref&gt;Biliarsky, pp. 331–333; Rezachevici (1971), p. 24; Stoicescu, p. 79; Tașcă, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-el|Παχαρνίκοσ}}, ''Pakharnikos'',&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1932), p. 219 &amp; 1934, pp. 206–207&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ru|Пахарник}}, ''Paharnik'') was a [[Historical Romanian ranks and titles|historical Romanian rank]], one of the non-hereditary positions ascribed to the [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyar aristocracy]] in [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]] (the [[Danubian Principalities]]). It was the local equivalent of a [[Cup-bearer]] or ''[[Cześnik]]'', originally centered on pouring and obtaining [[Romanian wine|wine]] for the court of [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Moldavian]] and [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Wallachian Princes]]. With time, it became a major administrative office and, in Wallachia, also had a lesser [[Wallachian military forces|military function]]. The retinue of such boyars, usually called ''Păhărnicei'', was in both countries also a private army.

Dating back to ca. 1400, the ''Paharnici'' were at the forefront of political life in Wallachia over the following two centuries, often as a title associated with the [[Craiovești]] and Florescu boyars. Wallachian ''Paharnici'' were especially important during the 16th and 17th centuries, when they included figures such as [[Lupu Mehedințeanu]], [[Radu Șerban|Șerban of Coiani]], and [[Matei Basarab]]. They and other ''Paharnici'' established means of boyar protection against the social ascent of immigrant [[Greeks in Romania|Greeks]]. Prince [[Constantin Brâncoveanu]], himself a former ''Paharnic'', gave a privileged position to the ''Păhărnicei'', but put to death their controversial ''Paharnic'', [[Staico Bucșanu]]. Before 1700, figures associated with the Moldavian office included close relatives of the monarchs, such as [[Alexandru Coci (boyar)|Alexandru Coci]] and [[Ștefan Lupașcu Hâjdău]]. Though the office itself steadily declined in importance, it was still subjected to a [[Meritocracy|meritocratic]] reform by Prince [[Dimitrie Cantemir]].

The ''Paharnici'' grew in numbers and declined in political relevancy from ca. 1720, with the rise of the [[Phanariotes]], and ultimately fell into a second class of boyars. Their descendants were recognized as a branch of the small boyardom, alongside the ''Păhărnicei''. While these became a rural middle class, the ''Paharnici'' offices were increasingly permeable to the commercial classes of the city. The three groups intertwined, with some ''Paharnici'', including [[Ianache Hafta]] and [[Manuc Bei]], having a noted effect on the development of [[Bucharest]]. Various ''Paharnici'' also participated first-hand in the cultivation of [[Romanian nationalism]], leading up to [[Gavril Istrati]]'s clashes with the Greek "[[Sacred Band (1821)|Sacred Band]]".

From Moldavia, the office was for a while inherited by the [[Russian Empire]], which preserved titular ''Paharnici'' in its [[Bessarabia Governorate]]. In both Moldavia and Wallachia, the [[Regulamentul Organic|Russian regime of 1834–1854]] recognized a multitude of titular ''Paharnici'', from inspectors [[Ion Heliade Rădulescu]] and [[Constantin N. Brăiloiu]] to painter [[Constantin Lecca]]. The proliferation of ''Paharnici'' and other offices, taken up by Moldavian Princes [[Ioan Sturdza|Ioan]] and [[Mihail Sturdza]], contributed to social tensions, and then to a [[Moldavian revolution of 1848|failed revolutionary attempt]]. Following the [[Crimean War]], the position of ''Paharnic'' was abolished, alongside all other historical titles. 

==Name==
''Paharnic'' is a Romanianized term, originating with the [[Church Slavonic in Romania|Church Slavonic]] variant, {{slavonic|Пєхарник}} (''Peharnik'').&lt;ref&gt;Panaitescu, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dimitrie Cantemir]], the intellectual Prince of Moldavia, was the first to note that the institution was copied from the [[Medieval Serbian noble titles|old Serbian nomenclature]], as opposed to other boyar titles, which were originally [[Byzantine bureaucracy and aristocracy|Byzantine]] or (in one case) [[Hungarian nobility|Hungarian]].&lt;ref&gt;Bacalov, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; However, legal historian Ivan Biliarsky notes that both the Serbian and the Romanian term originate with a Byzantine office, the ''[[Pinkernes]]'', being its functional equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;Bilarsky, pp. 329–331, 334–335&lt;/ref&gt; The component Romanian term is ''pahar'' ("glass" or "chalice"), which reached Romanian either from the Hungarian ''pohár'' or the [[Serbo-Croatian]] ''pehar''.&lt;ref&gt;Chirilă, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; After passing through Slavonic, ''Paharnic'' acquired a form in [[History of the Romanian language|historical Romanian]], and [[Romanian Cyrillic]], as {{slavonic|Пъхарникȣ}}, transliterated ''Păharnic'' ({{IPA-ro|pəˈharnic| }}, rather than {{IPA|[paˈharnic]}}). It was still codified in this manner by the early-18th-century scholar [[Anthim the Iberian]].&lt;ref&gt;Chirilă, pp. 31, 92, 163, 272&lt;/ref&gt;

All these terms continued to be spelled in Cyrillic for as long as the titles they represented were in use. However, attempts at [[Romanization of Cyrillic|Romanization]] were made as early as 1468, when ''Paharnic'' appeared as ''Poharnig'' in a [[Renaissance Latin]] document;&lt;ref&gt;Mihaela Paraschiv, "Elemente lexicale alogene în latina documentelor de cancelarie din Moldova", in ''Analele Universității Alexandru Ioan Cuza din Iași. Secțiunea IIIe. Lingvistică'', Vol. LIV, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; this was also rendered as ''Paharnig''.&lt;ref&gt;Biliarsky, p. 332&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1670s, [[Miron Costin]], using standardized [[Polish alphabet|Polish spellings]], produced ''Paharnik''.&lt;ref&gt;Raluca Elisabeta Iftime, "Modelul ortografic polonez în scrieri ale unor cărturari moldoveni din secolele al XVI-lea și al XVII-lea (Luca Stroici și Miron Costin)", in [[Rodica Zafiu]], Isabela Nedelcu (eds.), ''Variația lingvistică: probleme actuale.

Bucharest: [[Bucharest University Press]], 2015.  {{ISBN|978-606-16-0657-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1600, Slavonic documents also admitted a Romanian translation, ''Canatnic'', created from the dialectal ''canată'', "tiny mug".&lt;ref&gt;Ion Penișoară, "Recenzii și prezentări de cărți.

==History==
===Creating the office===
[[File:Treading the Winepress (Isaiah 63; Revelation 14) at Sucevița.png|thumb|330px|[[History of the wine press|Wine press]] in Moldavia, ca. 1600. Fresco from [[Sucevița Monastery]], illustrating the [[Book of Revelation]] as well as the [[Book of Isaiah]]]]
''Paharnici'' or similar were first mentioned in Wallachia under [[Mircea I of Wallachia|Mircea the Old]] (1386–1418) and in Moldavia under [[Alexander I of Moldavia|Alexander the Good]] (1400–1432).&lt;ref&gt;Rezachevici (1971), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The Moldavian version of the office ranked it immediately after the ''[[Spatharios]]''; in Wallachia, it was originally mentioned as below the ''[[Vistier]]'', who was fourth or fifth in line in the [[Sfatul boieresc|Boyar Council]]: the ''[[Ban (title)|Ban]]'', ''[[Vornic]]'', ''[[Logothete]]'', and sometimes also the ''Spatharios'', ranked above them.&lt;ref&gt;Rezachevici (1971), pp. 22–24&lt;/ref&gt; A social and functional differentiation cut across these boyar classes. According to such typologies, some boyar offices were administrative or "public" (''Ban'' or ''Logothete''), while others, including ''Ban'' and ''Spatharios'', were purely military. ''Paharnici'' fell into a third category of offices, deemed "courtly" (''de curte'')—alongside ''[[Clucer]]i'', ''[[Jitnicer]]i'', ''[[Medelnicer]]i'', ''[[Pitar (rank)|Pitari]]'', ''[[Postelnic]]i'', ''[[Sluger]]i'', and ''[[Stolnic]]i''.&lt;ref&gt;Palade, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; 

As summarized by historian Constantin Rezachevici, a ''Paharnic''{{'}}s function was "to fill up the first cup at the prince's table, and while in the country he supervised the princely vineyards and made sure that these were well kept".&lt;ref&gt;Rezachevici (1971), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Biliarsky also notes that the ''Paharnic'' acted as a waiter and a [[Food taster|wine taster]], who made sure that the beverage was safe to drink, being thus "close to and very highly trusted by the ruler."&lt;ref&gt;Biliarsky, pp. 331–332&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning, these attributes alternated with the business of state: in October 1407, ''Paharnic'' Iliaș "Dumitrovscio" was present on the Moldavian delegation which swore fealty to the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]], and consequently fought [[Battle of Grunwald|at Grunwald]].&lt;ref&gt;Tașcă, pp. 7–8, 14&lt;/ref&gt; A variation of the office, already present in 1540s Moldavia, was the ''Paharnic'' in service to the Princess-consort.&lt;ref&gt;Rezachevici (1977), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in Moldavia, ''Paharnici'' had direct control over the ''[[Starosta|Staroste]]'' of [[Cotnari]], who produced the [[Grasă de Cotnari|eponymous sweet wine variety]], seen as the region's best,&lt;ref&gt;Rezachevici (1971), p. 24. See also Aramă &amp; Jecev, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; as well as over the wine regions of [[Dealu Morii]], [[Hârlău]], [[Huși]], and [[Târgu Trotuș]].&lt;ref&gt;Stoicescu, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; After 1482, the Moldavian institution also appeared in the wine-rich [[Panciu]], [[Putna County]], which had been previously disputed between the two principalities.&lt;ref&gt;Pușcă, pp. 359–361&lt;/ref&gt; By 1700, the greater ''Paharnic'' was, ''[[ex officio]]'', the head of Putna's administration, while his assistant only controlled the princely vineyards of Huși.&lt;ref&gt;Mihordea, p. 1090&lt;/ref&gt; Historian N. Stoicescu proposes that the Wallachian ''Paharnici'' may have also exercised some control over the [[Winemaking|winemakers]] of [[Dealurile Buzăului]]. This function remains unattested, but is suggested by the ''Paharnici'' being traditionally reliant on support from that area, on the Wallachian border with Putna.&lt;ref&gt;Stoicescu, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; 

In tandem, ''Paharnici'' in both principalities operated as [[Farm (revenue leasing)|tax farmers]], receiving a small contribution from all other winemakers. This was presented to them personally on September 14 of each year.&lt;ref&gt;Rezachevici (1971), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Moldavia's ''Paharnic'' collected only the wine [[tithe]] known as ''vinărici''.&lt;ref&gt;Stoicescu, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; For the Wallachians, the ''vinărici'' was set at 1,000 barrels of wine yearly, from the wineries of [[Argeș County]] ([[Ștefănești, Argeș|Ștefănești]], [[Topoloveni]]) and [[Vâlcea County]] ([[Drăgășani]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mihordea, p. 1090&lt;/ref&gt; Here, another special tribute, also collected from private [[wine cellar]]s, was generally known as ''păhărnicie'', and was primarily lucrative in [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref&gt;C. C. Giurescu, pp. 346, 354–355; Stoicescu, pp. 78–79. See also Mihordea, p. 1090&lt;/ref&gt; 18th-century sources inform that the ''Paharnic'' of Wallachia also collected the wine tax known as ''cămănărit'', which had its origins in [[feudal aid]] (''plocon'').&lt;ref&gt;Al. Constantinescu, "Ploconul", in ''Studii și Materiale de Istorie Medie'', Vol. VI, 1973, p. 220. See also Mihordea, p. 1090&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early feudal revolts===
[[File:Theodor Aman - Boierii surprinşi la ospăţ de trimişii lui Vlad Ţepeş.jpg|thumb|410px|[[Vlad the Impaler]]'s envoys capturing the boyars during a feast (April 1457), in an 1860s painting by [[Theodor Aman]]]]
The ''Paharnici'' were assisted by their own private army, the ''Păhărnicei'' ("little ''Paharnici''", singular ''Păhărnicel''). At least originally, these were junior members of the aristocracy: the first known Moldavian ''Păhărnicel'', mentioned as such in December 1437, was a ''[[Slavic honorifics|Pan]]'' Ureche. He had earlier been [[Iliaș of Moldavia|Iliaș I]]'s ''Paharnic'', and went on to become his ''Vornic'' in 1438.&lt;ref&gt;Stoicescu, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; At some point in or after 1479, [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]] rewarded another ''Păhărnicel'', Cârstea, with the deeds to [[Ivănești|Coșești]] village.&lt;ref&gt;Cătălina Chelcu, Marius Chelcu, "«...din uricul pe care strămoșii lor l-au avut de la bătrânul Ștefan voievod». Întregiri documentare", in Petronel Zahariuc, Silviu Văcaru (eds.), ''Ștefan cel Mare la cinci secole de la moartea sa'', p. 150. Iași: Editura Alfa, 2003.  {{ISBN|973-8278-27-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in Moldavia, ''Paharnici'' were the only ones mandated to pass judgment in cases involving their retinue.&lt;ref&gt;Aramă &amp; Jecev, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Other records show that they (assisted by the relevant ''[[Burgrave|Pârcălabi]]'') passed judgment in all cases directly involving wine, either at Cotnari or Hârlău.&lt;ref&gt;Aramă &amp; Jecev, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Paharnici'' were nevertheless entirely subject to the Prince's expedient justice, as already shown in the 1480s, when Stephen the Great ordered the execution of his ''Paharnic'' Negrilă, for reasons unrecorded.&lt;ref&gt;Panaitescu, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Wallachian 15th century, the titles of ''Paharnic'' and ''Ban'' were closely associated with a family known as [[Craiovești]]. Its founder, Barbu I, emerged ca. 1431 as ''Paharnic'' of [[Alexander I Aldea]], sitting on the [[Sfatul boieresc|Boyar Council]], but was probably chased out of the country by [[Vlad II Dracul]].&lt;ref&gt;Oprea, pp. 133–136&lt;/ref&gt; This period highlighted the civil war between the houses of [[House of Dănești|Dănești]], to whom the Craiovești were loyal, and the family of Vlad II, or [[House of Drăculești|Drăculești]]. A differentiation of boyar offices first occurred in Wallachia under Dănești rulers. [[Vladislav II of Wallachia|Vladislav II]] (1447–1456) created the Craiovești family as his ''Vlastelini'', presumably meaning "strong" or "immovable boyars".&lt;ref&gt;Donat, pp. 178–179&lt;/ref&gt; That category included the ''Paharnic'' alongside the ''Ban'', ''Vornic'', ''Logothete'' and other lesser dignities. Most of these functions (20/34) went to boyars who were also family with the Prince, descending from the earlier [[House of Basarab]].&lt;ref&gt;Donat, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; 

Later in the 1450s, [[Vlad the Impaler]] staged a boyar purge, reportedly killing all of his Council who identified the Dănești as actual Princes.&lt;ref&gt;Palade, pp. 145–147&lt;/ref&gt; In 1482, [[Basarab Țepeluș cel Tânăr|Basarab Țepeluș]], who also relegated the Craiovești, raised his ''Paharnic'' Mircea to a second position in the Council ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Oprea, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; The first Craiovești Prince, [[Neagoe Basarab]] (reigned 1512–1521), assigned the office of ''Paharnic'' to a more distant relative, Drăghici Florescu, to whom he also gave ownership of [[Tismana]].&lt;ref&gt;Donat, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Teachings'', a political treatise often attributed to Neagoe, go further in proposing that the office of ''Paharnic'' be assigned to foreign mercenaries, thus ensuring [[meritocracy]]. Historian [[P. P. Panaitescu]] notes that this detail, as well as the designation of ''Paharnici'' as ''Credinciari'', establishes that the book is a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;Panaitescu, pp. 214–215&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wallachian ''Paharnic'' was also a rank in the [[Wallachian military forces|feudal levy army]], commanding the ''Păhărnicei'' as a mounted corps.&lt;ref&gt;Rezachevici (1971), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The latter, alongside lesser boyars in service to the ''Paharnici'', formed a special military corps and fiscal category, separate from the retinues of other boyar ranks. There were probably 13 such "orders" in 1580s Moldavia,&lt;ref&gt;Stoicescu, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; where the ''Păhărnicei'' themselves were still relevant landowners. Before 1600, a ''Păhărnicel'' Ionașcu owned the entire village of [[Drăgușeni, Botoșani|Drăgușeni]], which his family later sold to Prince [[Miron Barnovschi]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristotel Crîșmaru, "Drăgușenii în documente istorice (fragmente din monografie)", in ''Hierasus'', Vol. II, 1980, pp. 239–240&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the office of ''Paharnic'' in itself did not guarantee financial independence. In 1557, under Wallachia's [[Pătrașcu the Good]], ''Paharnic'' Vlad of Bârsești became financially destitute and, as one record shows, even faced starvation.&lt;ref&gt;Donat, pp. 103–104&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michael the Brave's boyars===
[[File:Nicolae Grigorescu - Mihai viteazul la Calugareni.jpg|thumb|370px|[[Michael the Brave]] and his military commanders, as depicted in 1857 by [[Nicolae Grigorescu]]]]
With the delegation of military power came the ''Paharnic''{{'}}s involvement in more rebellions. This also coincided with the increase of power for the [[Ottoman Empire]], which was Wallachia and Moldavia's [[Vassal and tributary states of the Ottoman Empire|suzerain power]] throughout the [[Romania in the Middle Ages|Late Medieval]] and [[Early Modern Romania|Early Modern]] eras. In the early 1540s, a holder of the title, Stroe Florescu, followed Șerban of Izvorani and fought against Wallachian Prince [[Radu Paisie]]; both rebels were executed.&lt;ref&gt;Donat, pp. 65–66&lt;/ref&gt; At around the same time, Moldavia's [[Petru Rareș]] was facing boyar rebellions in [[Cârligătura County]], confiscating a village from ''Paharnic'' Ștefan Mânjea and donating another to the loyalist replacement, Nicoară.&lt;ref&gt;Rezachevici (1977), pp. 78–79&lt;/ref&gt; The 1570s witnessed one of several wars between the two principalities, with Moldavia's [[John III the Terrible|John III]] occupying Bucharest, allowing Radu Paisie's putative grandson, [[Vintilă of Wallachia|Vintilă]], to take over as Prince of Wallachia. This days-long reign was probably ended by the supporters of [[Alexander II Mircea|Alexandru Mircea]], including a ''Paharnic'' Bratu.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Cernovodeanu, Nicolae Vătămanu, "Considerații asupra 'calicilor' bucureșteni în veacurile al XVII-lea și al XVIII-lea. Cîteva identificări topografice legate de așezările lor", in ''București. Materiale de Istorie și Muzeografie'', Vol. III, 1965, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1580s, one of Vintilă's surviving brothers, Prince [[Petru Cercel]], ordered the execution of another rebellious ''Paharnic'', Gonțea.&lt;ref&gt;Donat, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1595, Vintilă and Cercel's alleged brother, [[Michael the Brave]], took up the anti-Ottoman cause in the [[Long Turkish War]]. Shortly after, he punished his ''Paharnic'' Iane of Boleasca, taking over Iane's estate at [[Daia]]. This was possibly a payback for cowardice shown in the [[battle of Călugăreni]].&lt;ref&gt;Donat, pp. 88, 143, 144&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Michael's other ''Paharnici'' were held in high esteem for their service, and received villages from Michael's personal land fund: [[Lupu Mehedințeanu]] took the villages of [[Bălăcița|Dobra]] and [[Runcu, Gorj|Ponorălul]]; ''Paharnic'' Turturea was awarded [[Izvoarele, Teleorman|Găuriciu]].&lt;ref&gt;Donat, pp. 213, 214, 224&lt;/ref&gt; A mercenary commander, known as Necula ''Paharnic'', was also awarded the village of Roșiani, in [[Romanați County]].&lt;ref&gt;Donat, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; 

Among the holders of the ''Paharnic'' title since the days of [[Mihnea Turcitul]] was a matrilineal Craiovești, [[Radu Șerban|Șerban of Coiani]], who successfully litigated over his family's assets.&lt;ref&gt;Donat, pp. 40–41, 158&lt;/ref&gt; Șerban continued to serve under Michael the Brave and his son [[Nicolae Pătrașcu]], selling his estates at [[Seaca de Pădure]] and [[Segarcea]] to the former.&lt;ref&gt;Donat, pp. 231, 232, 234&lt;/ref&gt; In 1600, having already conquered the [[Principality of Transylvania (1570–1711)|Principality of Transylvania]], Michael also extended his rule into Moldavia. The uprooted [[Movilești]] regime of Moldavia continued to exist in exile, receiving crucial backing from the loyalist ''Paharnic'' and diplomat, [[Ion Caraiman]].&lt;ref&gt;Ioan D. Condurachi, "Diplomați români în trecut (sec. XIV—XVII) (II)", in ''Țara Bârsei'', Vol. IX, Issues 4–5, July–October 1937, pp. 354–360; Silvia Dulschi, "Țările române în sistemul relațiilor diplomatice medievale", in ''Administrarea Publică'', Issue 3/2016, pp. 135–139&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, during the troubles that followed Michael's downfall, Șerban of Coiani was elected Wallachian Prince by the boyar assembly at [[Sălătrucu]], taking the new name of ''Radu Șerban''.&lt;ref&gt;Ionașcu (1961), pp. 703–710&lt;/ref&gt; 

This new ruler extended his protection to Michael's other associates. Turturea was present by Michael's side at [[Câmpia Turzii]], where Michael was assassinated. He rescued his lord's severed head and kept it as a relic.&lt;ref&gt;Donat, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; Radu Șerban's court also included Mehedințeanu as a ''Paharnic'', until 1611, when he defected to the Ottoman-appointed Prince, [[Radu Mihnea]].&lt;ref&gt;Ionașcu (1961), p. 713&lt;/ref&gt; The office of ''Paharnic'' was also a major station in the career of [[Matei Basarab]], a junior Craiovești boyar; in 1612, Matei began using a personal seal that showed the ''Paharnic'' seated on a throne and carrying his special cane.&lt;ref&gt;D. Cernovodeanu, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Radu Șerban's regime, allied with the [[Holy Roman Empire]], was finally ended by the Ottomans. The deposed Prince tried to return by way of Moldavia, supported by the local Prince, [[Alexandru Movilă]]. However, [[Costea Bucioc]], the Moldavian ''Paharnic'', ended this campaign by refusing to fight.&lt;ref&gt;Horia Dumitrescu, "Un putnean pe tronul Moldovei: Ștefan Tomșa al II-lea (1611–1614, 1621–1623)", in ''Cronica Vrancei'', Vol. XI, 2011, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

Mehedințeanu, who continued to serve as ''Paharnic'', found himself at odds with the new establishment and especially the [[Greeks in Romania|Greek immigrants]], fleeing the country during the reign of [[Alexandru IV Iliaș]] (1616–1618).&lt;ref&gt;Donat, p. 227; C. C. Giurescu, p. 69; Rezachevici (1978), pp. 64–72&lt;/ref&gt; He returned as leader of a popular revolt, taking control of both Bucharest and [[Târgoviște]], where he inspired an anti-Greek pogrom. Appointed Prince by the Ottomans, [[Gabriel Movilă]] handed Mehedințeanu over to [[Iskender Pasha (governor of Ozi)|Iskender Pasha]], who ordered the ''Paharic'' [[Impalement|impaled]] at [[Ciocănești, Călărași|Ciocănești]].&lt;ref&gt;C. C. Giurescu, p. 69; Rezachevici (1978), pp. 67–72&lt;/ref&gt; A decade later, under [[Leon Tomșa]], the office of ''Paharnic'' was held by a Greek, [[Balasache Muselim]], whose tenure sparked another revolt, which peaked at Bucharest and had Matei Basarab among its leaders.&lt;ref&gt;C. C. Giurescu, p. 78; Rezachevici (1978), pp. 73–76&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was weakened when Prince Leon appointed locals to the higher offices, making Barbu Brădescu his new ''Paharnic''. Brădescu switched sides in 1632, helping to seize Wallachia's throne for Matei.&lt;ref&gt;Rezachevici (1978), pp. 75–76&lt;/ref&gt;

In ca. 1655, the ''Paharnic''{{'}}s private army was largely amassed on the border with Moldavia: in [[Buzău County|Buzău]] and [[Râmnicu Sărat County|Râmnicu Sărat Counties]] there were 300–400 ''Păhărnicei''. These were commanded by a Captain, 6 ''Iuzbași'', and 6 ''[[Çavuş|Ceauși]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stoicescu, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; By that moment in history, ''Paharnici'' had declined in relative importance. This was manifest under Matei Basarab, who ordered his new ''Paharnic'', Chisar Rudeanu, to be [[Caning|caned]] in the throne room, then jailed.&lt;ref&gt;Rezachevici (1978), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Under his regime, the ''Păhărnicei'' and other servants of the ''Paharnic'' owed a yearly tax of 8 [[ducat]]s, while boyars subordinated to the ''Spatharios'' paid 12.&lt;ref&gt;Stoicescu, pp. 66, 77, 89&lt;/ref&gt; Both countries' ''Paharnici'' were soon outranked by the ''Stolnici'' and ''[[Comis|Comiși]]''; in Wallachia, however, they continued to command the ''Păhărnicei'', and were also placed in charge of a new cavalry force, the ''Roșii'' ("Redcoats").&lt;ref&gt;Rezachevici (1971), pp. 22, 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; Both groups fought alongside the [[Ottoman Army]] in the [[Polish–Ottoman War (1672–76)|Polish war of 1672]].&lt;ref&gt;Stoicescu, pp. 66, 82&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
After 1650, some Wallachian ''Paharnici'' opposed the steady rise of the [[Cantacuzino family]], whose scion [[Drăghici Cantacuzino]] also held the title in 1661–1662,&lt;ref&gt;Ionașcu (1934), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; while others embraced it. Among the anti-Cantacuzino boyars, 1660s ''Paharnic'' [[Constantin Vărzarul]] plotted, alongside [[Stroe Leurdeanu]], to have [[Constantin I Cantacuzino]] unlawfully executed.&lt;ref&gt;C. C. Giurescu, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; Another such conflict erupted in the early 1680s between Prince [[Șerban Cantacuzino]] and his ''Paharnic'', Papa Buicescul (son of the ''Spatharios'' [[Diicul Buicescul|Diicul]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ionașcu (1934), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Cantacuzinos, the lesser ''Paharnici'' were all placed under the command of the greater ''Paharnic'', who organized them into a single military unit.&lt;ref&gt;Stoicescu, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; By then, the armed retinues, and those of all other high-ranking boyars, were collectively known as ''Feciori'' ("Young Men" or "Boys") or ''Slugi'' ("Servants"). With the peak of [[serfdom]] in both countries, these ''Feciori'' were exclusively recruited from among free or manumitted peasants.&lt;ref&gt;Stoicescu, pp. 63–64&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Constantin Giurescu]], the Wallachian ''Păhărnicei'', as a special set of ''Feciori'', might have been supporting themselves from ''păhărnicie'' revenues, which they collected for their patron.&lt;ref&gt;Stoicescu, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is attested in Moldavia, where, following the drought of September 1663, Princess [[Ecaterina Dabija]] warned ''Feciori'' not to collect the tithe from [[Armenians in Romania|Armenians]] and [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jews]], as this would have exhausted the supply.&lt;ref&gt;Stoicescu, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; 

A Cantacuzino ally, [[Constantin Brâncoveanu]], took the throne in 1688, replacing Șerban. He himself had for long been a regular boyar, first serving as a ''Paharnic'' when he was aged 17.&lt;ref&gt;Panaitescu, p. 462&lt;/ref&gt; During his subsequent reign, the ''Păhărnicei'' appear to have been almost exclusively confined to Râmnicu Sărat County, with some also present in [[Mehedinți County]].&lt;ref&gt;Stoicescu, pp. 76, 78&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Alexandru Ligor notes that, "during and especially after Brâncoveanu's era", the ''Păhărnicei'' and other such boyar retinues "will be more seriously engaged in productive life (in agriculture, in trades, etc.)."&lt;ref&gt;Ligor, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; Brâncoveanu's reign was overall marked by a steady increase in taxation, but the ''Păhărnicei'' were explicitly excluded from some of the new duties, including a levy on vacated villages (''siliști''). Ligor proposes that this exemption reflected the Prince's military priorities, and his secret anti-Ottoman alliance with the [[Tsardom of Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;Ligor, pp. 263–264&lt;/ref&gt;

Brâncoveanu's first ''Paharnic'' was [[Staico Bucșanu]], whose scheming against the regime ended with his public hanging at Bucharest's [[Obor|Outer Market]].&lt;ref&gt;C. C. Giurescu, p. 72; Ionașcu (1934), p. 25; Potra I, p. 370&lt;/ref&gt; His public humiliation and killing were received with hostility by the Bucharest populace.&lt;ref&gt;Potra I, p. 370&lt;/ref&gt; The period thus inaugurated came with a set of administrative reforms, recorded in the princely register, or ''Anatefter''. This shows ''Paharnic'' as one of the great offices, but also creates an overlapping function therein, as ''Cupar'' (from ''cupă'', "cup"); at the top of boyar advancement, these two offices coexisted with ''Spatharios'', ''[[Stolnic]]'', ''[[Clucer]]'', and another new office, that of ''Șufar'' (the intendant of kitchen staffs).&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Giurescu, p. 361&lt;/ref&gt; Under Brâncoveanu, these particular offices were designated as ''Zvolearnici''. In addition to receiving payment from the exercise of their offices, they relied on princely handouts, including [[kaftan]]s colored in accordance with their function.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Giurescu, pp. 361–362&lt;/ref&gt;

Until his own downfall in 1714, Brâncoveanu relied on various other noblemen to fill in Bucșanu's role. One of these, [[Cornea Brăiloiu]], served the Prince as both ambassador and organizer of defense expeditions against the ''[[Kuruc]]ok''.&lt;ref&gt;Vasile Marinoiu, "Marele ban Cornea Brăiloiu și mănăstirea Tismana în timpul domniei lui Constantin Brâncoveanu", in ''Drobeta. Seria Arheologie–Istorie'', Vol. XXIV, 2014, pp. 114, 124, 126, 130&lt;/ref&gt; In 1696, the Greek ''Paharnic'' Vergo was part of a caretaker government of ''[[Caimacam]]i''.&lt;ref&gt;C. C. Giurescu, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Brâncoveanu had another Greek ''Paharnic'', Skarlatakes Mavrocordatos, son of the influential [[Alexander Mavrocordatos]]. In October, Skarlatakes married the Prince's daughter, Ilinca.&lt;ref&gt;Potra I, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; Brâncoveanu also promoted Șerban II Cantacuzino as ''Paharnic'', in which capacity Cantacuzino attended, in 1702, the formal meeting between the Prince and [[William Paget, 6th Baron Paget|Baron Paget]].&lt;ref&gt;Potra I, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Brăiloiu returned as ''Paharnic'' under the last Cantacuzino Prince, [[Ștefan Cantacuzino|Ștefan]], with increased powers that allowed him to set an arbitrary ''vinărici'' and "collect wine as he pleases".&lt;ref&gt;Mihordea, pp. 1080, 1090&lt;/ref&gt;

Moldavia's own ''Paharnici'' and ''Păhărnicei'' greatly increased in number between 1550 and 1650; by 1710, some 24 were permanently present at the princely court in [[Iași]], acting as waiters to the Moldavian Princes' foreign guests.&lt;ref&gt;Stoicescu, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; Though the office's prestige declined, various Moldavian rulers maintained a practice of assigning it, alongside other offices, to their most trusted courtiers, often members of the monarchs' own families. [[Vasile Lupu]] (reigned 1634–1653) made his young nephew, [[Alexandru Coci (boyar)|Alexandru Coci]], a ''Paharnic''; meanwhile Lupu's in-laws, including ''Paharnici'' Alexandru Ciogolea and Neculai Mogâldea, were involved in conspiracies to topple him.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra-Marcela Popescu, "Câteva considerații privind înrudirea unor boieri hicleni cu familia domnitoare în Moldova medievală", in ''Analele Științifice ale Universității Alexandru Ioan Cuza din Iași. Istorie'', Vols. LIV–LV, 2008–2009, pp. 52, 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; Coci and his brother Enache were later tortured and killed by Lupu's rival, [[Gheorghe Ștefan]], at the princely court in [[Podoleni]].&lt;ref&gt;Bacalov, p. 402; Dan Mihăilescu, "O ctitorie a domnitorului moldovean Gheorghe Ștefan în județul Neamț", in ''Acta Moldaviae Meridionalis'', Vols. XV–XVII (Part I), 2004–2006, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1670s, holders of the ''Paharnic'' title included [[Ștefan Lupașcu Hâjdău]], who was both a close relative and in-law of Prince [[Ștefan Petriceicu]].&lt;ref&gt;Bezviconi I, p. 244; Costin Feneșan, "Indigenatul austriac al familiei nobiliare Hâjdău", in ''Archiva Moldaviae'', Vol. II, 2010, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; The office of ''Cupar'' also existed in Moldavia, for instance during Petriceicu's successor [[Antonie Ruset]], who assigned it to his brother Constantin. This function was alluded to in the [[canting arms]] used by the [[Rosetti family]], which prominently feature a silver cup.&lt;ref&gt;Sorin Iftimi, "Heraldică și arhitectură", in ''Monumentul'', Vol. VII, 2006, p. 498&lt;/ref&gt;

Moldavia also experienced a Cantacuzino ascendancy, which resulted in the promotion of Greek boyars, to the irritation of local competitors. The latter sentiment was notably expressed in the anti-Greek outburst of 1673, narrated favorably by chronicler [[Ion Neculce]]. It came shortly after [[Dumitrașcu Cantacuzino]] abdicated, and targeted his courtiers, notably the ''Paharnic'' Mavrodin, who was [[Parading on donkey|paraded on a donkey]] and made to speak [[shibboleth]] phrases in Romanian.&lt;ref&gt;Hoinărescu, pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning to the throne, Petriceicu maintained a court that included Greek boyars such as Ilie Stamatie, who was a ''Paharnic'' of Huși.&lt;ref&gt;Bacalov, pp. 335, 370&lt;/ref&gt; By 1703, the Moldavian Cantacuzinos were in conflict with the Greek Prince [[Constantine Ducas (Moldavian ruler)|Constantine Ducas]], with ''Paharnic'' [[Ilie Cantacuzino]] fleeing the country.&lt;ref&gt;Bacalov, p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; Brâncoveanu's contemporary [[Dimitrie Cantemir]], a native boyar and [[Enlightened absolutism|Enlightened absolutist]], strove to reform the old order, appointing distinguished soldiers, such as Adam Luca, as his ''Paharnici''.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1934), p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; Under Cantemir, the ''Postelnic'' was the seventh of eight boyars admitted to a [[privy council]], while the ''Păhărnicei'' were inducted en masse into a category called ''boiernași'' ("little boyars").&lt;ref&gt;Bacalov, pp. 59–60, 359–360&lt;/ref&gt; His second and final reign was curbed by the [[Pruth River Campaign]], during which Cantemir supported Russia. When he left into exile, he took with him Neculce and the ''Paharnic'' Gheorghiță, both of them against their will.&lt;ref&gt;Bacalov, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phanariote reforms===
[[File:Seal of Wallachian Paharnic Manolache Robe, 1772.svg|thumb|270px|1772 seal of a Wallachian ''Paharnic'', Manolache Robe]]
Progressively over the 1710s, competing dynasties of culturally Greek aristocrats, collectively known as "[[Phanariotes]]", took power as Ottoman intermediaries in both Wallachia and Moldavia. The first such ruler, [[Nicholas Mavrocordatos]], awarded tax privileges to the ''Paharnici'', exempting them from the levy on ''siliști''.&lt;ref&gt;Stoicescu, pp. 77–78&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Păhărnicei'' continued to be a strong presence in the borderland region of Wallachia, where in 1729 they still had a corps and a Captain.&lt;ref&gt;Stoicescu, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; Overtures were made to tone down conflicts between the Romanians and the Greeks in Moldavia, such as when [[Grigore II Ghica]] refused to prosecute a treasonous ''Paharnic'' Gavriil.&lt;ref&gt;Hoinărescu, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; In 1754, [[Matei Ghica]] created more resources for the two ''Paharnici'' of [[Panciu]], allowing them to collect half of the tax revenue previously kept by the ''[[Starosta|Staroste]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Camariano-Cioran, pp. 509, 510; Pușcă, p. 360; Mihordea, pp. 1090, 1096–1097&lt;/ref&gt; However, the erosion of ''Paharnici'' importance continued and was enhanced: under the same Matei Ghica, who ruled over both countries in succession, twenty ''Paharnici'' were created at each court. While some historians credit this anomaly to the Prince,&lt;ref&gt;Grina-Mihaela Rafailă, "Actele domniei lui Matei Ghica aflate în colecția de documente a Muzeului Municipiului București", in ''București. Materiale de Istorie și Muzeografie'', Vol. XXIX, 2015, p. 251; Viorica Răileanu, "Mărturii antroponimice privind unele funcții dregătorești", in Ovidiu Felecan (ed.), ''Numele și numirea: actele Conferinței Internaționale de Onomastică, Ediția 1: Interferențe multietnice în antroponimie, Baia Mare, 19–21 septembrie 2011'', p. 204. Cluj-Napoca: Editura Mega, 2011.  {{ISBN|978-606-543-176-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; others identify his ''Postelnic'', Alexandros Soutzos, as the culprit.&lt;ref&gt;Camariano-Cioran, p. 505&lt;/ref&gt;

Matei's predecessor, [[Mihai Racoviță]], had redesigned the Wallachian table of ranks, making ''Paharnic'' the eighth position, within a second category of boyars. Accordingly, ''Paharnici'' were entitled to 40 ''[[scutelnic]]i'', or clients, and had a yearly salary of 960 [[thaler]]; by comparison, all boyars of the first class received 70 ''scutelnici'' and 1,680 thaler.&lt;ref&gt;Ioana Constantinescu, "Aspecte ale destrămării feudalismului în Țara Românească și Moldova la sfîrșitul secolului al XVIII-lea și începutul secolului al XIX-lea: 'Oamenii de scuteală'", in ''Studii și Materiale de Istorie Medie'', Vol. IX, 1978, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by historian [[Pompiliu Eliade]], "an inflexible protocol govern[ed] the relationship between classes."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Third-class boyars were required to bow down and kiss the [[hem]] of first-class superiors. ''Paharnici'' and others of the intermediary class were only expected to kiss their hand and display timidity in interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt; Under the new Phanariote regulations, these second-class aristocrats could not wear fur kaftans and had special ''[[kalpak]]s'', surmounted by green cushions; their coats could only be colored in dark tones of green, blue, and brown, but, unlike inferior boyars, they were allowed to grow beards.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian-Silvan Ionescu, "Spune-mi cu ce te îmbraci, ca să-ți spun cine ești", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', February 2001, pp. 64–66&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel, scholar [[Nicolae Iorga]] notes, Wallachia's "old ''[[cursus honorum]]'' had yielded to personal assets or demands." Before 1796, the ''Paharnici'' had fallen to ninth or tenth place, but only because higher offices had been "doubled"—for instance, in 1768 there were two Wallachian ''Vornici''.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1933), pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; Another stratification occurred in Moldavia. There were 27 ''Paharnici'' at [[Grigore Callimachi]]'s court: 13 enjoyed the full privileges; 14 were secondary (''vtori-'') and tertiary (''treti-'') ''Paharnici''.&lt;ref&gt;Ghibănescu, pp. 72, 73&lt;/ref&gt; There were still 14 ''Păhărnicei'' performing military duty at the Moldavian court in 1763. Their commander, now called ''Vătaf'' (plural: ''Vătafi''), was a Greek boyar, Miche.&lt;ref&gt;Ghibănescu, pp. 73, 75&lt;/ref&gt; Reduced to the role of rural legatees of the urban ''Paharnic'', the ''Păhărnicei'' of both countries were then stripped of all their remaining tax privileges under [[Constantine Mavrocordatos]]; the ''Paharnici'' themselves were required to pay for any military levy.&lt;ref&gt;Rădescu, pp. 136–138&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, these new norms also stipulated that holders of any boyar rank from the top 19 would be spared taxation. That privilege was also extended to three generations of their descendants, known as ''Mazili'' or ''Mazâli''.&lt;ref&gt;Berindei &amp; Gavrilă, pp. 2033, 2036–2041; Rădescu, pp. 137–139. See also Bacalov, pp. 59–60&lt;/ref&gt; A Western visitor, Friedrich Wilhelm von Bauer, assessed that Mavrocordatos' intervention had only left 100 ''Păhărnicei'' throughout Wallachia, with 12 more performing service for the Prince as ''Mazili''.&lt;ref&gt;Stoicescu, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; By 1760, the boyars, including three ''Paharnici'', had lodged a formal complaint against Mavrocordatos with [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan]] [[Mustafa III]], accusing him of embezzlement.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1934), pp. 205–207&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after Mavrocordatos' death in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)|Russian occupation of 1769]], the chronicler Franz Sulzer noted that the function of Moldavia's great ''Paharnic'' was to reside in Cotnari and collect revenue for [[Queen dowager|Princess-dowager]] Ecaterina. The town, Sulzer noted, had greatly declined.&lt;ref&gt;Horst Fassel, Sorin Chițanu, "Botoșanii în jurnalele de călătorie germane", in ''Hierasus'', Vol. I, 1979, p. 338&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1810, the ''Paharnic'' had fallen to an even lesser position on the table of ranks of Moldavia. It was twelfth, although ahead of the ''Stolnic'' and ''[[Sardar|Serdar]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bezviconi I, p. 18; Iorga (1933), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Păhărnicei''{{'}}s ''Vătafi'' moved in the opposite direction and, by 1796, had been recognized as a component of Wallachia's fifth-class boyardom.&lt;ref&gt;Berindei &amp; Gavrilă, p. 2035&lt;/ref&gt;

''Paharnici'' and ''Păhărnicei'' also had a decorative function at the ceremonies in honor of Wallachia's Phanariote Princes, notably at the coronations of [[Alexander Ypsilantis (1725–1805)|Alexander Ypsilantis]] (1775) and [[Nicholas Mavrogenes]] (1786), and the wedding of Princess Zamfira, daughter of [[John Caradja]] (1782).&lt;ref&gt;Potra I, pp. 71, 73, 76–77, 81, 88, 122&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the holders of the title focused their activity on cultural and educational projects. In [[Oltenia]], Romanian or Greek schools were founded by local ''Paharnici'', including Fota Vlădoianu ([[Craiova]], 1777), Stan Jianu ([[Teslui, Dolj|Preajba]], 1783), and Alexandru Farfara ([[Șimian, Mehedinți|Cerneți]], 1793).&lt;ref&gt;Maria Bălan, "Contribuții la istoria învățământului din Oltenia în secolul al XVIII-lea", in ''Studii și Materiale de Istorie Medie'', Vol. VI, 1973, pp. 292, 293&lt;/ref&gt; The 1780s ''Paharnic'' [[Mihail Fotino]], a Wallachian Greek, became noted for his contributions to jurisprudence and moral philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Valentin Al. Georgescu, "Protimisisul in ''Manualele de legi'' din 1765, 1766 și 1777 ale lui Mihail Fotino. Cu o analiză generală a operei sale juridice și a raporturilor ei cu ''Suplimentul'' publicat de frații Tunusli în 1806", in ''Studii și Materiale de Istorie Medie'', Vol. V, 1962, pp. 281–333; Iorga (1932), pp. 219–224&lt;/ref&gt; By 1806, Toma Carra, the Moldavian ''Paharnic'', was helping to draft a set of modenizing ''[[Digest (Roman law)|Pandects]]'', to be used by Prince [[Alexander Mourouzis]] in reforming the justice system.&lt;ref&gt;Cezar Avram, Roxana Radu, "Acte privind statul și dreptul românesc în perioada regimului fanariot", in ''Analele Universității din Craiova. Seria Istorie'', Vol. XIV, Issue 2, 2009, pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a middle-class and nationalist layer===
[[File:Chevalier Auguste de Henikstein - Bojars du second rang. Caminars.jpg|thumb|330px|"Second-rank boyars" of Wallachia, depicted in 1825 by Auguste de Henikstein]]
Other ''Paharnici'' were primarily involved in administrative or entrepreneurial work. Under Prince [[John Mavrocordatos]], the Bucharest caretakers, or ''[[ispravnic]]i'', comprised ''Paharnic'' [[Nicolae Ruset]].&lt;ref&gt;C. C. Giurescu, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt; In 1724, ''Paharnic'' Manolache owned one of the larger Bucharest bakeries.&lt;ref&gt;C. C. Giurescu, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; By 1804, Wallachian dignitaries included an [[Armenians in Romania|Armenian]] businessman and ''Paharnic'', [[Manuc Bei]], made famous by his establishing of [[Manuc's Inn]].&lt;ref&gt;C. C. Giurescu, p. 324; Siruni, pp. 33–34, 70, 73, 74&lt;/ref&gt; In 1800, while reigning in Wallachia, Mourouzis appointed his ''Paharnic'' Ștefănică, alongside [[Constantin Pastia]], to redesign a system for Bucharest's drainage and sewage.&lt;ref&gt;Potra I, pp. 173–174&lt;/ref&gt; In 1819, Wallachian Prince [[Alexandros Soutzos]] ordered his ''Paharnic'', [[Ianache Hafta]], to carry out a modern [[surveying]] of Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;C. C. Giurescu, p. 265; Potra I, pp. 175, 203, 223&lt;/ref&gt; Another ''Paharnic'', Vasile Iconomu, helped ''Spatharios'' [[Gheorghe Vlahuț]] in capturing a gang of English counterfeiters.&lt;ref&gt;Potra II, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; Moldavia's second-class boyars were similarly dedicated to commercial pursuits. Around 1740, ''Paharnic'' Radu Racoviță established a pioneering glass factory at [[Luizi-Călugăra]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Cernovodeanu, pp. 487&lt;/ref&gt; While ranked as ''Paharnici'', [[Ioniță Cuza]] took up [[usury]] (1770s) and [[Ionică Tăutu]] became one of the major [[tenant farmer]]s in [[Hotin County]] (1810).&lt;ref&gt;P. Cernovodeanu, pp. 483, 484&lt;/ref&gt;

Frictions between the Phanariotes and the provincial second-class boyars continued with some regularity. In one incident of 1799, ''Paharnic'' Constantin Bălăceanu of [[Ialomița County]] refused to carry out an order issued by [[Constantine Hangerli]].&lt;ref&gt;Samarian, pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Constantine Ypsilantis]], another Ialomița ''Paharnic'', Fălcoianu, was charged with embezzlement.&lt;ref&gt;Samarian, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[National awakening of Romania|era of national awakening]], the ''Paharnici'' opposition to the Greeks extended to other classes of foreigners. In 1784, a ''Paharnic'' "Carpoff" made sustained efforts to block the penetration into Moldavia of [[Armenians in Ukraine|Galician Armenians]].&lt;ref&gt;Siruni, pp. 66–67&lt;/ref&gt; ''Paharnic'' Manuc remained one of only three only Armenians to have reached a boyar rank in either country under the Phanariote reigns.&lt;ref&gt;Siruni, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812)|war of 1806]], a Wallachian ''Paharnic'', Ștefan Belu, had a publicized conflict with the [[Bulgarians in Romania|Bulgarians]] colonized at [[Călărași|Lichirești]], who were under the protection of [[Dimitrie Macedonski]].&lt;ref&gt;Samarian, pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;

The Phanariote era also pushed Moldavia and Wallachia into the orbit of the [[Russian Empire]], prompting some boyars to accept Russian suzerainty. In the 1760s, a ''Paharnic'', Semyon Mikulin, moved to [[Novorossiya Governorate|Novorossiya]] and was received into [[Russian nobility]].&lt;ref&gt;Bezviconi II, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; In 1812, pursuant to the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)|Treaty of Bucharest]], [[Bessarabia|eastern Moldavia]] was detached and assigned to Russia. This led to the creation of a [[Bessarabian Governorate]] which recognized Moldavian titles, including that of ''Paharnic'', as the basis for inclusion into Russian nobility.&lt;ref&gt;Bezviconi I, pp. 17–18, 51&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the earliest Bessarabian ''Paharnici'' were Nicolae Done and Toma Stamati. From a Wallachian family, Done served as judge in [[Hotin County]] during the early 1820s; Stamati, who took part in the inaugural [[gentry assembly]], was the father of poet [[Constantin Stamati]].&lt;ref&gt;Bezviconi II, pp. 33, 66–67, 160&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another ''Paharnic'' under Russian rule, Dinu Negruzzi of [[Șirăuți]] was the father of writer [[Costache Negruzzi]].&lt;ref&gt;Bezviconi II, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Under late Phanariotes such as Wallachia's Caradja, the rank of a lesser ''Paharnic'' was openly trafficked: Hagi Ianus, a merchant from Craiova, offered to purchase it at 400 ducats in 1816.&lt;ref&gt;S. Columbeanu, "Caracterul exploatării feudale a țărănimii în deceniile anterioare răscoalei lui Tudor Vladimirescu (1800—1820)", in ''Studii. Revistă de Istorie'', Vol. XIV, Issue 3, 1961, p. 579&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of Soutzos' death in 1821 there were six greater ''Paharnici'' in Wallachia, all of them present at his funeral.&lt;ref&gt;Potra I, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; According to a note by visiting bureaucrat Ignaty Yakovenko, the number of ''scutelnici'' had increased, with each of these ''Paharnici'' commanding the allegiance of 25 clients; the ''Păhărnicei''{{'}}s ''Vătafi'' had three ''scultenici'' of their own.&lt;ref&gt;Traian Ionescu-Nișcov, "Un călător rus despre Principatele romîne de la 1820", in ''Revista Istorică'', Vol. XXIII, Issues 4–6, April–June 1936, pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt; 

The rise of Wallachian clienteles was again curbed in 1821 by an [[Wallachian uprising (1821)|anti-boyar uprising]], under [[Tudor Vladimirescu]]; having a peasant base, this insurgency was probably led by disgruntled third-class boyars.&lt;ref&gt;Dinică Ciobotea, Vladimir Osiac, "1821. Tabăra pandurilor de la Țânțăreni", in ''Analele Universității din Craiova. Seria Istorie'', Vol. XIV, Issue 2, 2009, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1821, the Phanariote warlord [[Alexander Ypsilantis]], leading a "[[Sacred Band (1821)|Sacred Band]]" of [[Greek War of Independence|Greek revolutionaries]], had taken control over Moldavia and parts of Wallachia. Ypsilantis' expedition sparked [[Battle of Dragashani|another Ottoman intervention]], which provided a settling of scores between Romanians and Greeks. Second-class boyars played significant parts: according to Eliade, a ''Spatharios'' and a ''Paharnic'' traveled from one Moldavian town to another, replacing Ypsilantis' men with friendly locals.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Paharnic'' [[Gavril Istrati]] was involved alongside Sturdza in the fight against Sacred Band Greeks, at the head of a [[National Party (Romania)|national party]]. At [[Zvoriștea]], he organized a guerrilla force which flew [[Red flag (politics)|red flags]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1919), pp. 173, 174&lt;/ref&gt; It then marched on [[Botoșani]], driving out the Greek insurgents.&lt;ref&gt;Gorovei, pp. 21–22; Iorga (1919), pp. 173–175&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disintegration===
[[File:Casa Paharnicului.JPG|thumb|330px|''Casa Paharnicului'' in [[Piatra Neamț]], 2012 photograph]]
Istrati's counterpart in Wallachia was Scarlat Cerchez, who organized the reception of Moldavia's first post-Phanariote Prince, [[Ioan Sturdza]].&lt;ref&gt;Samarian, pp. 56, 221&lt;/ref&gt; Even before arriving in his capital, Sturdza rewarded the expectations of [[Romanian nationalism|Romanian nationalists]], inducting his partisans into the boyardom. By 1825, he had created 350 second-class boyars, ''Paharnici'' included.&lt;ref&gt;Ungureanu, pp. 51, 54&lt;/ref&gt; These changes perplexed Moldavia's first-class boyardom, whose delegates asked [[Mahmud II]] to mediate.&lt;ref&gt;Berindei &amp; Gavrilă, p. 2041&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|Russo-Turkish War of 1828]] drove Sturdza into exile in Bessarabia. This moment showed the tensions between the two aristocratic systems, as Sturdza began handing out titles to commoners, and allegedly created a house servant as ''Paharnic''.&lt;ref&gt;Bezviconi I, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-Phanariote agitation ended as a lengthy Russian occupation of both principalities, providing them with a modernizing constitution known as ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]''. Under this system, ''Paharnici'' were a seventh aristocratic rank, below ''Cluceri'' and ahead of ''Serdari''.&lt;ref name="lvnote36"&gt;Laurențiu Vlad, "Scurte note cu privire la cenzura din Țara Românească. Două episoade din biografia lui Constantin N. Brăiloiu (1849–1850, 1858)", in ''Analele Universității București. Seria Științe Politice'', Vol. 4, 2002, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian-appointed Moldavian Prince, [[Mihail Sturdza]], replicated the policy of inducting new boyars, and, in 1835, raised most civil servants into the aristocracy: 140 ''Paharnici'' and 352 ''Serdari'' were counted in the census of 1849.&lt;ref&gt;Ungureanu, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; In 1820, in Botoșani alone there were five ''Paharnici'': Alexandru, Ion Brănișteanu, Necula Dalamaci, Gavril Istrati, and Sterie.&lt;ref&gt;Gorovei, pp. 79–81, 97, 100, 118, 128, 137&lt;/ref&gt; By 1847, the same city held six ''Paharnici'', none of them present in the older count.&lt;ref&gt;Gorovei, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; Nationality restrictions for Armenians were also lifted with the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]]. As noted by scholar [[H. Dj. Siruni]], 35 Armenians became Moldavian boyars in the subsequent social uplift, including ''Paharnici'' Hacic Cerchez at [[Roman, Romania|Roman]] and G. Țăranu at Botoșani.&lt;ref&gt;Siruni, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sturdza's measures were derided by the genealogist [[Constantin Sion]], himself a ''Paharnic''. According to Sion, Sturdza had managed to make boyars out of "the sons of butchers and publicans", and "condemned the country to fall under his companions".&lt;ref&gt;Ungureanu, pp. 54–55&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal and radical ideas]] influenced such perceptions, leading up to the [[Moldavian revolution of 1848|abortive coup of 1848]]. During the preceding crisis in 1846, the ''Paharnic'' Teodor Sion was arrested, alongside ''Spahtarios'' Tucidide Durmuz, for having joined [[Teodor Râșcanu]]'s attempt at [[tax resistance]] against Sturdza.&lt;ref&gt;Ungureanu, pp. 62–63, 65–66&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wallachian and [[Moldavian military forces]] were both restructured, though some importance was paid to the old table of ranks and the concept of ''Mazili''. As such, the radical conspirator [[Ion Câmpineanu]] was allowed to serve as a Wallachian Major because of his descent from a ''Paharnic''.&lt;ref&gt;Hêrjeu, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; By 1841, the role of ''Paharnici'' in Bucharest's government had been formalized, with ''Paharnic'' [[Scarlat Rosetti]] serving as [[Mayor of Bucharest|City Council President]].&lt;ref&gt;Potra I, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; Other boyars of that rank continued to be involved primarily in trade. [[Pitești]] was home to a ''Paharnic'' Berindei, who, by 1855, was a major player in Wallachia's pork trade.&lt;ref&gt;Petre Popa, Paul Dicu, "Participarea piteștenilor la principalele evenimente ale istoriei naționale din epoca modernă", in ''Pitești, Pagini de Istorie. Studii și Comunicări'', Vol. I, 1986, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; In Moldavia's [[Piatra Neamț]], the era is commemorated by a former manor-and-warehouse, known as ''Casa Paharnicului'' ("House of the ''Paharnic''"). It was built by the boyar and grain trader Dimitrie C. Gheorghiadis, who held the office for only part of his career.&lt;ref&gt;Vitalie Josanu, "Comerţul genovez și ecouri culturale occidentale în Moldova și Dobrogea (secolele XIII–XV)", in ''Ioan Neculce.

The title was also held in the 1830s and '40s by two inspector-generals of Wallachia's schools, [[Ion Heliade Rădulescu]]&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan-Duică, pp. 138, 140&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Constantin N. Brăiloiu]],&lt;ref name="lvnote36"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potra II, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by painter [[Constantin Lecca]].&lt;ref&gt;Dana-Silvia Țilică, "Familia Lecca în texte și documente", in ''Revista Bibliotecii Naționale a României'', Nr. 1/2003, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848]], which sought to outlaw boyar ranks, the father of revolutionary [[Gheorghe Magheru]] also served as ''Paharnic'' and administrator of [[Romanați County]].&lt;ref&gt;Cornelia Bodea, ''Lupta românilor pentru unitatea națională, 1834–1849'', pp. 312–313. Bucharest: [[Editura Academiei]], 1967.  {{OCLC|1252020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another ''Paharnic'', the poet [[Grigore Alexandrescu]], discarded his rank and job in the bureaucracy to participate in the revolutionary events.&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan-Duică, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; 

The revolution was defeated, but Russian influence was curbed from 1853, with the [[Crimean War]]. Under the regime of Prince [[Barbu Dimitrie Știrbei]], Wallachian revolutionaries were allowed back home from exile. They included the ''Paharnic'' Rădulescu, who alternated roles between civilian boyar and general in the [[Ottoman Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Adrian-Silvan Ionescu, "Viața mondenă a societății bucureștene în timpul și după revoluția de la 1848", in ''Muzeul Național'', Vol. XI, 1990, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, all boyar ranks and tax privileges were ended by the Convention of Paris (1858), which also opened the way for a [[United Principalities|Moldo–Wallachian union]] in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;C. C. Giurescu, p. 142; Hêrjeu, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; The title continued to be used in the 1860s by those who already held it, including jurists Gheorghe Lehliu and Barbu Slătineanu.&lt;ref&gt;D. Cernovodeanu, pp. 406, 408&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul de Man''' (December 6, 1919 – December 21, 1983), born '''Paul Adolph Michel Deman''',&lt;ref name=Barish2014&gt;{{Cite book |author=Evelyn Barish |year=2014 |title=The Double Life of Paul de Man |place=New York |publisher=W. W. Norton/[[Liveright &amp; Company|Liveright]]|pages=e.g., p. 3. 560 pp. |ISBN=978-0-87140-326-1 |url=http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail.aspx?ID=4294972279 |accessdate=3 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Belgium|Belgian]]-born [[Literary criticism|literary critic]] and [[Literary theory|literary theorist]]. At the time of his death, de Man was one of the most prominent literary critics in the United States—known particularly for his importation of German and French [[philosophy|philosophical]] approaches into Anglo-American literary studies and critical theory.{{citation needed lead|date=May 2014}} Along with [[Jacques Derrida]], he was part of an influential critical movement that went beyond traditional interpretation of literary texts to reflect on the epistemological difficulties inherent in any textual, literary, or critical activity.{{citation needed lead|date=May 2014}} This approach aroused considerable opposition, which de Man attributed to "resistance" inherent in the difficult enterprise of literary interpretation itself.&lt;ref&gt;de Man, Paul, 1982, "[[The Resistance to Theory]]," in ''The Resistance to Theory'', University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, pp. 3-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

De Man began his teaching career in the United States at [[Bard College]]. In 1960 he completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] at [[Harvard University]], then taught at [[Cornell University]], [[Johns Hopkins University]], and the [[University of Zurich]].&lt;ref&gt;Barish 2014, pp. xv, xx&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the faculty in French and Comparative Literature at [[Yale University]], where he was considered part of the [[Yale school (deconstruction)|Yale School]] of [[Deconstruction]]. At the time of his death from cancer, he was [[Sterling Professor]] of the Humanities and chairman of the Department of Comparative Literature at Yale. De Man oversaw the dissertations of [[Gayatri Spivak]] (at Cornell), [[Barbara Johnson]] (at Yale),{{citation needed lead|date=May 2014}} [[Samuel Weber]] (at Cornell), and many other noted scholars.

After his death, a researcher uncovered some two hundred previously unknown articles which de Man had written in his early twenties for Belgian [[Collaborationism|collaborationist]]&lt;ref name=Barish2014 /&gt; newspapers during [[World War II]], some of them implicitly and two explicitly [[Anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]]. These, in combination with revelations about his domestic life and financial history, caused a scandal and provoked a reconsideration of his life and work.&lt;ref name=Atlas1988 /&gt;

==Early life==

Paul de Man was born in [[Antwerp]], Belgium, to a prominent and cultivated upper-class [[Flemish people|Flemish]] family. His maternal great-grandfather was the noted Flemish Poet, [[Jan Van Beers]], and the family spoke French at home. His uncle [[Henri de Man]] (Dutch: Hendrik) was a famous [[socialist]] theorist and politician, who became a Nazi-collaborator during World War II. Paul's father, Robert ("Bob") de Man, was a moderately successful businessman whose firm manufactured X-ray equipment. De Man's father and his mother, Madeleine De Braey, who were first cousins, married over the family's opposition. The marriage proved unhappy.

De Man's early life was difficult and shadowed by tragedy. His mother Madeleine's first pregnancy with her oldest son Hendrik ("Rik," b. 1915) coincided with the intense German bombings of [[World War I]] and strained her physical and mental health. The stillbirth of a daughter two years later pushed her into intermittent but lifelong suicidal [[depression (mood)|depression]]. She was psychologically fragile and had to be watched. The family walked on eggshells and "Bob" de Man found solace with other women. In contrast to Rik, who was backward and a failure in school, Paul dealt with his difficult home life by becoming a brilliant student and accomplished athlete. He was enrolled in the Dutch-speaking cohort of boys admitted to the prestigious and highly competitive Royal Athenaeum of Antwerp. There, he followed his father's career path in choosing to study science and engineering, consistently receiving top marks in all subjects and graduating at the top of his class. He took no courses in literature or philosophy but developed a strong extracurricular interest in both as well as in religious mysticism. In 1936, his brother Rik de Man was killed at the age of 21 when his bicycle was struck by a train at a railroad crossing. The following year, it was Paul, then seventeen, who discovered the body of their mother, who had hanged herself a month before the anniversary of Rik's death.&lt;ref&gt;Barish 2014, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

That fall Paul enrolled in the [[Free University of Brussels]]. He wrote for student magazines and continued to take courses in science and engineering. For stability he turned to his uncle Henri as a patron and surrogate emotional father, later on several occasions telling people Henri was his real father and his real father was his uncle. He fathered a son with [[Romanians|Romanian]]-born Anaïde Baraghian, the wife of his good friend, Gilbert Jaeger. They lived in a menage a trois until August 1942, when Baraghian left her husband.  Paul married her in 1944, and the couple had two more sons together.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, Wendy. ''The Scandal of Pleasure: Art in an Age of Fundamentalism.'' University Of Chicago Press. 24 Nov. 1997. p. 191. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

De Man, Baraghian and Jaeger fled to the south of France near the Spanish border when the Nazis occupied Belgium in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Barish, pp. 99-103&lt;/ref&gt; Uncle Henri, who by then was a self-avowed fascist, welcomed the Nazi invaders, whom he saw as essential for instituting his brand of socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=James |last=Tuttleton|title=Quisling criticism: the case of Paul de Man: a review of David Lehman, 'Signs of the Times: Deconstruction &amp; the Fall of Paul de Man'|website=New Criterion|date= April 1991|url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/Quisling-criticism--the-case-of-Paul-de-Man-5464}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2014|5|3}}{{page needed|date=May 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;J. Gérard Libois and José Gotovitch, L’An 40  (CRISP: Bruxelles, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; For a year, Henri de Man was appointed as de facto puppet Prime Minister of Belgium under the Nazis. Some believed that he used his influence to secure his nephew a position as an occasional cultural critic for ''[[Le Soir]]'', the influential Belgian [[French-language]] newspaper. After contributing an essay, “The Jews in Present-Day Literature,”  to ''Le Soir volé'''s notorious anti-Semitic attack of March 4, 1941, de Man became its official book reviewer and a cultural critic. Later he contributed to the Flemish daily ''Het Vlaamsche Land''; both publications were violently anti-Semitic when under Nazi control. As a cultural critic, de Man would contribute hundreds of articles and reviews to these publications. His writings supported the Germanic ideology and the triumph of Germany in the war, while never referring directly to Hitler himself. In spite of that he maintained friendships with individual Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Barish, e.g. his contacts with G. Goriély, p. 142 and E. Sluszny, pp. 153, 154&lt;/ref&gt;

Holding three different jobs, de Man became very highly paid, but he lost all three between November 1942 and April 1943, failures that resulted from a combination of losing a coup he had launched against one employer and his own incompetence as a businessman at another. After this, de Man went into hiding; the [[Belgian Resistance]] had now begun assassinating prominent Belgian pro-Nazis. He had lost his protection in late 1942, when Uncle Henri, mistrusted by his collaborators on the right and himself marked for death as a traitor by the Belgian Resistance, went into exile.

De Man spent the rest of the war in seclusion reading American and French literature and philosophy and organizing a translation into Dutch of ''[[Moby Dick]]'' by [[Herman Melville]], which he published in 1945. He would be interrogated by prosecutor Roger Vinçotte,&lt;ref&gt;Barish, Evelyn. '' The Double Life of Paul de Man.'' Liveright. 17 March 17, 2014. 194. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; but not charged after the war. Henri de Man was [[Tried in absentia|tried]] and convicted in absentia for [[treason]]; he died in Switzerland in 1953, after crashing his car into an oncoming train, an accident that was almost certainly a suicide.&lt;ref name=Atlas1988&gt;{{Cite journal |author=James Atlas |title=The Case of Paul de Man |journal=New York Times |date=August 28, 1988 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/28/magazine/the-case-of-paul-de-man.html?pagewanted=all |accessdate=3 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Rudnytsky, date unknown, "Rousseau's Confessions, De Man's Excuses," in ''Autobiography, Historiography, Rhetoric'', publisher, city, and page now. unknown.&lt;/ref&gt;{{nonspecific|date=May 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Frank |last=Kermode|title=Paul de Man's Abyss|website=London Review of Books|date=March 16, 1989|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v11/n06/frank-kermode/paul-de-mans-abyss}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2014|5|3}}

==Post-war years==

In 1948 de Man left Belgium and immigrated to [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=Atlas1988/&gt; He had fled as an exile to avoid what became two trials for criminal and financial misdeeds (thefts of money from investors in a publishing company he ran) for which he was convicted in absentia to five years of imprisonment and heavy fines.&lt;ref&gt;Barish, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; Baraghian sailed with their three young sons to [[Argentina]], where her parents had recently immigrated. De Man found work stocking books at the Doubleday Bookstore at New York City's [[Grand Central Station]]. From there he wrote to his friend [[Georges Bataille]], a French philosopher, and through him, he met [[Dwight MacDonald]], a key figure on the New York intellectual and literary scene. At MacDonald's apartment, de Man met the celebrated novelist [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy]]. McCarthy recommended de Man to her friend, [[Artine Artinian]], a professor of French at Bard College, as a temporary replacement while Artinian spent the academic year of 1949–50 in France as a [[Fulbright fellow]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;"De Man was to teach Mr. Artinian's courses, advise Mr. Artinian's advisees, and move into Mr. Artinian's house. By December [1949], de Man had married one of the advisees, a French major named Patricia Kelley, and when the first Mrs. de Man turned up with their three young boys, Hendrik, Robert, and Marc, in the spring of 1950, Patricia de Man [sic] was pregnant."&lt;ref name="lehman"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;De Man persuaded the devastated Baraghian to accept a sum of money, agree to a divorce, and return to Argentina.  She, however, surprised him when she left the eldest boy with him, while he surprised her when his first check proved worthless. The boy was raised by Kelley's parents while she took the younger ones back to Argentina with a promise of [[child support]] that de Man was never to honor.&lt;ref name="lehman"&gt;{{cite web|first=David |last=Lehman|title=Paul de Man: The Plot Thickens|work=New York Times|date=May 24, 1992|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/24/books/paul-de-man-the-plot-thickens.html?pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/The-Many-Betrayals-of-Paul-de/142505/|title=The Many Betrayals of Paul de Man|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2014|5|3}}

De Man married Kelley a first time in June 1950, but did not tell her that he had not actually gotten a divorce and that the marriage was bigamous. They underwent a second marriage ceremony in August 1960, when his divorce from Baraghian was finalized, and later had a third ceremony in Ithaca.&lt;ref name=Smallwood2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harpers.org/archive/2014/03/new-books-56/|title=[Reviews] - New Books, by Christine Smallwood - Harper's Magazine|work=Harper's magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to their son, Michael, born while the couple was at Bard College, they had a daughter, Patsy. The couple remained together until de Man's death, aged 64, in [[New Haven, Connecticut]].

==Academic career==

The de Mans moved to Boston, where Paul earned money teaching conversational French at [[Berlitz Corporation|Berlitz]] and did translations assisted by Patricia de Man; he also gave private French lessons to [[Harvard]] student [[Henry Kissinger]], then running a small center and publication of his own.&lt;ref&gt;Barish 2014, p. 326-7&lt;/ref&gt; There, de Man met [[Harry Levin]], the Harvard Professor of Comparative Literature, and "was invited to join an informal literary seminar that met at Levin's house (alongside, e.g., [[George Steiner]] and [[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} By the fall of 1952, he was officially admitted to graduate study in comparative literature."&lt;ref name=Brooks2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/apr/03/strange-case-paul-de-man/?insrc=hpss|title=The Strange Case of Paul de Man by Peter Brooks|work=nybooks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954 someone sent Harvard an anonymous letter denouncing de Man as a wartime collaborator and questioning his immigration status (a letter not surviving, and known only on the basis of de Man's response to it).&lt;ref&gt;Barish 2014, p. 347-360&lt;/ref&gt; According to Harvard faculty members, de Man offered a thorough and more than satisfactory account of his immigration status and the nature of his political activities.&lt;ref name=Brooks2014/&gt; While he was writing his dissertation, de Man was awarded a prestigious appointment at the [[Harvard Society of Fellows]].&lt;ref&gt;Barish 2014, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, because his thesis was unsatisfactory to his mentors on several counts, and especially its philosophical approach, they were prepared to dismiss him, but he moved immediately to an advanced position at Cornell University, where he was highly valued.&lt;ref&gt;Barish 2014, p. 423-5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Brooks (writer)|Peter Brooks]], who was de Man's undergraduate student at Harvard, and later became his friend and colleague at Yale, wrote that rather than brand de Man as a confidence man, as his critics were inclined to do:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"One might consider this a story of remarkable survival and success following the chaos of war, occupation, postwar migration, and moments of financial desperation: without any degrees to his name, de Man had impressed, among others, [[Georges Bataille|Bataille]], Macdonald, McCarthy, and Levin, and entered the highest precincts of American academia. During the following decade, he contributed nine articles to the newly established ''[[New York Review]]'': astute and incisive short essays on major European writers—[[Hölderlin]], [[Gide]], [[Albert Camus|Camus]], [[Sartre]], [[Heidegger]], as well as [[Borges]]—that display notable cultural range and critical poise.&lt;ref name=Brooks2014/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1966, de Man attended a conference on [[structuralism]] held at [[Johns Hopkins University]], where [[Jacques Derrida]] delivered his celebrated essay, "[[Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences]]"; de Man and Derrida soon became fast friends.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Both were to become identified with [[Deconstruction]]. De Man came to reflect the influence primarily of [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and used deconstruction to study [[Romanticism]], both [[List of romantics|English]] and [[German Romanticism|German]], as well as French literature, specifically the works of [[William Wordsworth]], [[John Keats]], [[Maurice Blanchot]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G.W.F. Hegel]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Friedrich Hoelderlin]] and [[Rainer Maria Rilke]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Following an appointment to a professorship in [[Zurich]], de Man returned to the United States in the 1970s to teach at Yale University, where he served for the rest of his career.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} At the time of his death of cancer at age 64, he was a [[Sterling Professor]] and chairman of the department of comparative literature at Yale.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Contributions to literary theory==

Although de Man's work in the 1960s differs from his later deconstructive endeavors, considerable continuity can also be discerned. In his 1967 essay "Criticism and Crisis," he argues that because literary works are understood to be fictions rather than factual accounts, they exemplify the break between a [[Semiotics|sign and its meaning]]: literature "means" nothing, but critics resist this insight: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"When modern critics think they are demystifying literature, they are in fact being demystified by it. But since this necessarily occurs in the form of a crisis, they are blind to what takes place within themselves. What they call anthropology, linguistics, psychoanalysis, is nothing but literature reappearing like the hydra's head in the very spot where it had been suppressed. The human mind will go through amazing feats to avoid facing 'the nothingness of human matters'."&lt;ref&gt;"Criticism and Crisis" 18 in ''Blindness and Insight''. The phrase "nothingness of human matters" – ''le néant des choses humaines'' – is from a well-known passage about the imagination from [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]'s [[Julie, or the New Heloise|''Julie ou La Nouvelle Héloïse'']] (VI: VIII), which asserts that human happiness lies only in desire and not fulfillment: "The world of illusions is the only one worth inhabiting. Such is the vanity of human matters, outside the realm of the Self-Created Being, that nothing here is beautiful but what is not."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;De Man would later observe that, due to this resistance to acknowledging that literature does not "mean", English departments had become "large organizations in the service of everything except their own subject matter" ("The Return to Philology"). He said that the study of literature had become the art of applying [[psychology]], [[politics]], [[history]], [[philology]] or other disciplines to the literary text, in an effort to make the text "mean" something.

Among the central threads running through de Man's work is his attempt to tease out the tension between rhetoric (which de Man's uses as a term to mean figural language and [[Trope (linguistics)|trope]]) and meaning, seeking moments in the text where linguistic forces "tie themselves into a knot which arrests the process of understanding."&lt;ref&gt;de Man, Paul, "Shelley Disfigured", in Bloom, Harold, et al. ''Deconstruction and Criticism'' (New York, Continuum: 1979), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; De Man's earlier essays from the 1960s, collected in ''Blindness and Insight'',&lt;ref&gt;See de Man, Paul, ''Blindness and Insight: Essays in the Rhetoric of Contemporary Criticism'' (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; represent an attempt to seek these [[paradox]]es in the texts of [[New Criticism]] and move beyond [[Formalism (literature)|formalism]]. One of De Man's central topoi is of the blindness on which these critical readings are predicated, that the "insight seems instead to have been gained from a negative movement that animates the critic's thought, an unstated principle that leads his language away from its asserted stand. . . as if the very possibility of assertion had been put into question."&lt;ref&gt;de Man, Paul, "The Rhetoric of Blindness", ''Blindness and Insight'', 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Here de Man tries to undercut the notion of the poetic work as a unified, atemporal [[Symbol|icon]], a self-possessed repository of meaning freed from the [[Authorial intentionalism|intentionalist]] and affective fallacies. In de Man's argument, formalist and New Critical valorization of the "organic" nature of poetry is ultimately self-defeating: the notion of the verbal icon is undermined by the irony and ambiguity inherent within it. Form ultimately acts as "both a creator and undoer of organic totalities," and "the final insight...annihilated the premises which led up to it."&lt;ref&gt;de Man, Paul, "The Rhetoric of Blindness", ''Blindness and Insight'', p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;{{nonspecific|date=May 2014}}{{page needed|date=May 2014}}

In ''Allegories of Reading'',&lt;ref&gt;See de Man, Paul, ''Allegories of Reading'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;{{nonspecific|date=May 2014}}{{page needed|date=May 2014}} de Man further explores the tensions arising in figural language in Nietzsche, Rousseau, Rilke, and Proust. In these essays, he concentrates on crucial passages which have a [[Metalinguistics|metalinguistic]] function or metacritical implications, particularly those where figural language has a dependency on classical philosophical oppositions ([[essence]]/accident, [[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]]/[[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]], appearance/reality) which are so central to Western [[discourse]]. Many of the essays in this volume attempt to undercut figural totalization, the notion that one can control or dominate a discourse or phenomenon through [[metaphor]]. In de Man's discussion of Nietzsche's ''The Birth of Tragedy'', for instance, he claims that "genetic"{{clarify|date=May 2014}} conceptions of history appearing in the text are undercut by the [[rhetoric]]al strategies Nietzsche employs: "the deconstruction does not occur between statements, as in a logical refutation or a dialectic, but happens instead between, on the one hand, metalinguistic statements about the rhetorical nature of language and, on the other hand, a rhetorical [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] that puts these statements into question."&lt;ref&gt;de Man, ''Allegories of Reading'', 98.&lt;/ref&gt; For de Man, an "Allegory of Reading" emerges when texts are subjected to such scrutiny and reveal this tension; a reading wherein the text reveals its own assumptions about language, and in so doing dictates a statement about [[undecidable problem|undecidability]], the difficulties inherent in totalization, their own readability, or the "limitations of textual authority."&lt;ref&gt;de Man, ''Allegories of Reading'', 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

De Man is also known for his readings of English and [[German Romanticism|German]] [[Romanticism|romantic]] and post-romantic poetry and philosophy (''The Rhetoric of Romanticism''), and concise and deeply ironic essays. Specifically noteworthy is his critical dismantling of the Romantic ideology and the linguistic assumptions which underlie it. His arguments follow roughly as follows. First, de Man seeks to deconstruct the privileged claims in Romanticism of [[symbol]] over [[allegory]], and [[metaphor]] over [[metonymy]]. In his reading, because of the implication of [[Self-concept|self-identity]] and wholeness which is inherent in the Romantics' conception of metaphor, when this self-identity decomposes, so also does the means of overcoming the dualism between [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] and [[Object (philosophy)|object]], which Romantic metaphor sought to transcend. In de Man's reading, to compensate for this inability, Romanticism constantly relies on allegory to attain the wholeness established by the totality of the symbol.&lt;ref&gt;See de Man, "The Rhetoric of Temporality", ''Blindness and Insight''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, in his essay "[[The Resistance to Theory]]", which explores the task and philosophical bases of [[literary theory]], de Man uses the example of the classical ''[[Trivium (education)|trivium]]'' of grammar, rhetoric, and logic to argue that the use of linguistic sciences in literary theory and criticism (i.e. a [[structural linguistics|structuralist]] approach) was able to harmonize the logical and grammatical dimension of literature, but only at the expense of effacing the rhetorical elements of texts which presented the greatest interpretive demands. He posits that the resistance to theory is the resistance to reading, thus the resistance to theory is theory itself. Or the resistance to theory is what constitutes the possibility and existence of theory. Taking up the example of the title of Keats's poem ''The Fall of Hyperion'', de Man draws out an irreducible interpretive undecidability which bears strong affinities to the same term in Derrida's work and some similarity to the notion of incommensurability as developed by [[Jean-François Lyotard]] in ''[[The Postmodern Condition]]'' and ''[[The Differend]]''. De Man argues that the recurring motive of theoretical readings is to subsume these decisions under theoretical, futile generalizations, which are displaced in turn by harsh [[polemic]]s about theory.

==Influence and legacy==

De Man's influence on literary criticism was considerable, in part through his numerous and vocal disciples. Although much of his work brought to bear insights on literature drawn from German philosophers such as Kant and Heidegger, De Man also closely followed developments in contemporary [[French language|French]] literature, criticism, and theory.

Much of de Man's work was collected or published posthumously. His book, ''Resistance to Theory'' was virtually complete at the time of his death. In 1996 a collection of essays, edited by his former Yale colleague Andrzej Warminski, was published by the [[University of Minnesota Press]] under the title,  ''Aesthetic Ideology''.

==Wartime journalism and posthumous controversies==
In 1988, Ortwin de Graef, a Belgian graduate student at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|University of Leuven]], discovered some two hundred articles which de Man had written during World War II for ''[[Le Soir]]''.&lt;ref&gt;For facsimiles of the articles, see Warner Hamacher, Neil Hertz and Thomas Keenan, eds., ''Wartime Journalism 1939–1943 by Paul de Man'' (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; That year a conference on Paul de Man took place at the University of Antwerp. "On the last day, [[Jean Stengers]], a historian at the Free University of Brussels, addressed a topic pointedly titled: "Paul de Man, a Collaborator?"&lt;ref name=Atlas1988/&gt; Then Georges Goriely, professor emeritus of sociology at the Free University of Brussels, rose to deliver what he called "A Personal Testimony":

&lt;blockquote&gt;M. Goriely began by extolling de Man, whom he had known intimately in his youth, as "a charming, humorous, modest, highly cultured" ''homme de lettres'' renowned in Belgian literary circles during their youth. Then the professor dropped his bombshell. De Man, he asserted, wasn't all that he appeared to be. He was "completely, almost pathologically, dishonest," a crook who had bankrupted his family. "Swindling, forging, lying were, at least at the time, second nature to him."&lt;ref name=Atlas1988/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The European press was in an uproar. "There were stories in La ''Quinzaine Litteraire'', the ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', The ''(Manchester) Guardian''. ''Newsweek'' juxtaposed a photograph of de Man with another of Nazis on the march. ''Le Soir'' reported 'a Waldheim ''academique'''."&lt;ref name=Atlas1988/&gt;

De Man's disciples tried to portray the attacks on de Man as a cover for his critics' dislike of Deconstruction, alleging that the attacks were a ruse that used de Man's youthful errors as evidence of what they considered the decadence at the heart of the Continental thought behind de Man and his theories. The controversies quickly spread from the pages of scholarly journals&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida, "Like the Sound of the Sea Deep within a Shell: Paul de Man's War", ''Critical Inquiry'' 14 (Spring 1988), 597–98.&lt;/ref&gt; to the broader media. ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' and the front page of the  ''New York Times'' exposed the sensational details of de Man's personal life, particularly the circumstances of his marriage and his difficult relationships with his children.&lt;ref&gt;"Yale Scholar Wrote for Pro-Nazi Newspaper", ''New York Times'', Dec. 1, 1987, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the most controversial and explicitly anti-semitic essay from this war-time journalism, titled "Jews in Contemporary Literature" (1941), de Man described how "[v]ulgar anti-semitism willingly takes pleasure in considering post-war cultural phenomenon (after the war of 14–18) as degenerate and decadent because they are [enjewished]."&lt;ref name=deMan127-129&gt;Paul de Man. "The Jews in Contemporary Literature." Originally published in ''Le Soir'' (March 4, 1941), Martin McQuillan, translator, in Martin McQuillan, ''Paul de Man. USA'' (Routledge. 2001), pp. 127–29.&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Literature does not escape this lapidary judgement: it is sufficient to discover a few Jewish writers under Latinized pseudonyms for all contemporary production to be considered polluted and evil. This conception entails rather dangerous consequences ... it would be a rather unflattering appreciation of western writers to reduce them to being mere imitators of a Jewish culture which is foreign to them."&lt;ref name=deMan127-129/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The article claimed that contemporary literature had not broken from tradition as a result of the First World War and that
&lt;blockquote&gt;"the Jews cannot claim to have been its creators, nor even to have exercised a preponderant influence over its development. On any closer examination, this influence appears to have extraordinarily little importance since one might have expected that, given the specific characteristics of the Jewish Spirit, the later would have played a more brilliant role in this artistic production."&lt;ref name=deMan127-129/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The article concluded that "our civilization... [b]y keeping, in spite of Semitic interference in all aspects of European life, an intact originality and character... has shown that its basic character is healthy." It concluded that "the creation of a Jewish colony isolated from Europe" as "a solution to the [[Jewish Question|Jewish problem]]" would not entail any "deplorable consequences" for "the literary life of the west."&lt;ref&gt;"Les Juifs dans la littérature actuelle" appears in the same issue, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the only known article in which de Man pronounced such views so openly, though two or three other articles also accept without demurral the disenfranchisement and ostracization of Jews, as some contributors to ''Responses'' have noted.

De Man's colleagues, students, and contemporaries tried to respond to his early writings and his subsequent silence about them in the volume ''Responses: On Paul de Man's Wartime Journalism''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Responses-Paul-Mans-Wartime-Journalism/dp/080327243X|title=Responses: On Paul de Man's Wartime Journalism: Werner Hamacher, Neil H. Hertz, Thomas Keenan: 9780803272439: Amazon.com: Books|work=amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; (edited by Werner Hamacher, Neil Hertz, and Thomas Keenan; Nebraska, 1989). His longtime friend, Jacques Derrida, who was Jewish, published a long piece responding to De Man's critics, declaring:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"To judge, to condemn the work or the man on the basis of what was a brief episode, to call for closing, that is to say, at least figuratively, for censuring or burning his books is to reproduce the exterminating gesture which one accuses de Man of not having armed himself against sooner with the necessary vigilance. It is not even to draw a lesson that he, de Man, learned to draw from the war."&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida, "Like the Sound of the Sea Deep within a Shell: Paul de Man's War", ''Critical Inquiry'' 14 (Spring 1988), 590–65; quote from 651; see also the "Critical Responses" in ''Critical Inquiry'' 15 (Summer 1989, 765–811) and Derrida's reply, "Biodegradables: Seven Diary Fragments", 812–873.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Some readers objected to what they considered was Derrida's objectionable effort to relate criticism of de Man to the greater tragedy of extermination of the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Jon Wiener, "The Responsibilities of Friendship", ''Critical Inquiry'' 15 (Summer 1989): 797.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fredric Jameson]] lengthily defended de Man in ''[[Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism]]'' (1991), observing about de Man's critics that "it does not seem to me that North American intellectuals have generally had the kind of experience of history that would qualify them to judge the actions and choices of people under military occupation."&lt;ref name="Jameson 257"&gt;Fredric Jameson, 1991, ''Postmodernism, or The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism''. Durham, NC: Duke University Press. pp.&amp;nbsp;256–57&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jameson, the efforts to implicate de Man in the Holocaust hinged on a fundamental misunderstanding of Nazi anti-Semitism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The exclusive emphasis on anti-Semitism ignores and politically neutralizes its other constitutive feature in the Nazi period: namely, anticommunism. [The] very possibility of the Judeocide was absolutely at one with and inseparable from the anticommunist and radical right-wing mission of National Socialism (...). But put this way, it seems at once clear that DeMan was neither an anticommunist nor a right-winger: had he taken such positions in his student days (...), they would have been public knowledge.&lt;ref name = "Jameson 257" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Turning to the content and ideology of de Man's wartime journalism, Jameson contended that it was "devoid of any personal originality or distinctiveness," simply rehearsing [[corporatism|corporatist]] commonplaces found in a broad range of European political movements. From this, Jameson concluded that none of the wartime articles "had any relevance to Paul DeMan, for whom the thing dramatically called 'collaboration' was simply a job, in a Europe henceforth and for the foreseeable future [[Greater Germanic Reich|united and German]], and who as long as I knew him personally was simply a good [[liberalism|liberal]]."&lt;ref name = "Jameson 257" /&gt;

Since the late 1980s, some of de Man's followers, many of them Jewish, have pointed out that de Man at no time in his life displayed personal animus against Jews. Shoshana Felman, recounted that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"about a year after the journalistic publication of his compromising statement, he and his wife sheltered for several days in their apartment the Jewish pianist Esther Sluszny and her husband, who were then illegal citizens in hiding from the Nazis. During this same period, de Man was meeting regularly with Georges Goriely, a member of the Belgian Resistance. According to Goriely's own testimony, he never for one minute feared denunciation of his underground activities by Paul de Man."&lt;ref&gt;Shoshana Felman, "Paul de Man's Silence", ''Critical Inquiry'' 15: 4 (Summer, 1989): 704–744&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;But, his disciples and defenders have failed to agree about the nature of de Man's silence about his wartime activities. His critics, on the other hand, point out that throughout his life de Man was not only passively silent but also engaged in an active coverup through lies and misdirections about his past.

The question of de Man's personal history has continued to fascinate scholars, as evidenced by Evelyn Barish's 2014 biography, ''The Double Life of Paul de Man'',.&lt;ref name=Barish2014/&gt; In an advance review published in ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harpers Magazine]]'', Christine Smallwood concluded that, as portrayed by Barish, de Man turns out to have been: "a slippery Mr. [[Tom Ripley|Ripley]], a confidence man, and a hustler who embezzled, lied, forged, and arreared his way to intellectual acclaim."&lt;ref name=Smallwood2014/&gt; Writing in the ''New York Review of Books'', [[Peter Brooks (writer)|Peter Brooks]], who succeeded to de Man's post as Sterling professor at Yale, defended his friend, calling some of Barish's accusations overblown and identifying errors in her footnotes: "One could do a review of Barish's footnotes that would cast many doubts on her scholarship", he complains.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Brooks, “The Strange Case of Paul de Man,” ''The New York Review of Books'', April 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, he cites the footnote Barish provides to support her claim that in 1942 de Man planned to launch a Nazi literary magazine: "I shared this information, and it has since been previously published in Belgian sources not now available to me", noting that this sort of thing "does not pass any sort of muster." Harvard professor [[Louis Menand]], on the other hand, in his review in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', finds Barish's biography important and credible, notwithstanding the presence of occasional errors and exaggerations. Menand writes "[h]er book is a brief for the prosecution. But it is not a hatchet job, and she has an amazing tale to tell. In her account, all guns are smoking. There are enough to stock a miniseries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2014/03/24/140324crat_atlarge_menand?currentPage=all Louis Menand, "The de Man Case: Does a Critic's Past Explain His Criticism?"], ''The New Yorker'', March 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Petro Grigorenko was born in [[Prymorsk Raion|Borisovka]] village&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Abuse of psychiatry for political repression in the Soviet Union: hearing, ninety-second congress, second session|date=1975|volume=Vol. 2|publisher=[[U.S. Government Printing Office]]|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46}} in [[Taurida Governorate]], [[Russian Empire]] (in present-day
[[Zaporizhia Oblast]], [[Ukraine]]).

In 1939, he graduated with honors from the [[Kuybyshev Military Engineering Academy]] and the [[Military Academy of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia]].&lt;ref name=Gluzman&gt;{{cite news|last=Gluzman, Semyon [Семён Глузман]|script-title=ru:Расширенная судебно-психиатрическая заочная экспертиза по делу Григоренко Петра Григорьевича, 1907 г.р., украинца, жителя г.

He went on a military career and reached high ranks during [[World War II]]. After the war, being a decorated [[veteran]], he left active career and taught at the [[Frunze Military Academy]], reaching the rank of a [[Major General]].

In 1949, Grigorenko defended his Ph.D. thesis on the theme "Features of the organization and conduct of combined offensive battle in the mountains."&lt;ref name="Казнимые"&gt;{{cite book|title=Казнимые сумасшествием: Сборник документальных материалов о психиатрических преследованиях инакомыслящих в СССР / Редакторы: А.

In 1961, Petro Grigorenko started to openly criticize what he considered the excesses of the [[Khrushchev]] regime.&lt;ref name=Bursten&gt;{{cite book|author=Bursten, Ben|title=Psychiatry on trial: fact and fantasy in the courtroom|year=2001|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-7864-1078-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hLZnornC1FEC&amp;pg=PA151}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|151}} He maintained that the special privileges of the political elite did not comply with the principles laid down by [[Lenin]].&lt;ref name=Bursten/&gt;{{rp|151}} Grigorenko formed a dissident group — The Group for the Struggle to Revive Leninism.&lt;ref name=Bursten/&gt;{{rp|151}} Soviet psychiatrists sitting as legally constituted commissions to inquire into his sanity diagnosed him at least three times — in April 1964, August 1969, and November 1969.&lt;ref name=Stone&gt;{{cite book|author=Stone, Alan|title=Law, Psychiatry, and Morality: Essays and Analysis|year=1985|publisher=American Psychiatric Pub|isbn=0-88048-209-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GK3Tt0e_fOgC&amp;pg=PA8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}} When arrested, Grigorenko was sent to Moscow's [[Lubyanka prison]], and from there for psychiatric examination to the [[Serbsky Institute]]&lt;ref name=Bursten/&gt; where the first commission, which included Snezhnevsky and Lunts, diagnosed him as suffering from the mental disease in the form of a paranoid delusional development of his personality, accompanied by early signs of cerebral arteriosclerosis.&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt;{{rp|11}} Lunts, reporting later on this diagnosis, mentioned that the symptoms of paranoid development were "an overestimation of his own personality reaching messianic proportions" and "reformist ideas."&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt;{{rp|11}} Grigorenko was not responsible for his actions and was thereby forcibly committed to a special psychiatric hospital.&lt;ref name=Bursten/&gt;{{rp|151}} While there, the government deprived him of his pension despite the fact that, by law, a mentally sick military officer was entitled to a pension.&lt;ref name=Bursten/&gt;{{rp|152}} After six months, Grigorenko was found to be in remission and was released for outpatient follow-up.&lt;ref name=Bursten/&gt;{{rp|152}} He required that his pension be restored.&lt;ref name=Bursten/&gt;{{rp|152}} Although he began to draw pension again, it was severely reduced.&lt;ref name=Bursten/&gt;{{rp|152}}

He became much more active in his dissidence, stirred other people to protest some of the State's actions and received several warnings from the [[KGB]].&lt;ref name=Bursten/&gt;{{rp|152}} In 1968, after Grigorenko protested the [[Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]], he was expelled from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], arrested and ultimately committed to a mental hospital&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gen.

It did not reveal any signs of illness or delusions."&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt;{{rp|11}} The psychiatrists reported that he was not mentally sick, but responsible for his actions.&lt;ref name=Bursten/&gt;{{rp|152}} He had firm convictions which were shared by many of his colleagues and were not delusional.&lt;ref name=Bursten/&gt;{{rp|152}} Having evaluated the records of his preceding hospitalization, they concluded that he had not been sick at that time either.&lt;ref name=Bursten/&gt;{{rp|152}} The KGB brought Grigorenko back to Moscow and, three months later, arranged a second examination at the Serbsky Institute.&lt;ref name=Bursten/&gt;{{rp|152}} Once again, these psychiatrists found that he had "a paranoid development of the personality" manifested by reformist ideas.&lt;ref name=Bursten/&gt;{{rp|152}} The commission, which included Lunts and was chaired by Morozov, recommended that he be recommitted to a special psychiatric hospital for the socially dangerous.&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt;{{rp|12}} Eventually, after almost four years, he was transferred to a regular mental hospital.&lt;ref name=Bursten/&gt;{{rp|152}} On 17 January 1971 Grigorenko was asked whether he had changed his convictions and replied that "Convictions are not like gloves, one cannot easily change them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Barron, John|title=KGB: the secret work of Soviet secret agents|date=1974|publisher=Reader's Digest Press|isbn=0883490099|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lqLiS0USD7UC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Dr. [[Semyon Gluzman]] wrote an in-absentia psychiatric report on Grigorenko.&lt;ref name=Gluzman/&gt;&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed"&gt;{{cite book|title=Medicine betrayed: the participation of doctors in human rights abuses|year=1992|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=1-85649-104-8|page=73|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bMTu_oIfVsIC&amp;pg=PA73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tyDIKu8XsgcC|title=On Dissidents and Madness: From the Soviet Union of Leonid Brezhnev to the "Soviet Union" of Vladimir Putin|last=Voren|first=Robert van|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Rodopi|year=|isbn=9042025859|location=|pages=194|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gluzman came to the conclusion that Grigorenko was mentally sane and had been taken to mental hospitals for political reasons.&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed"/&gt; In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Gluzman was forced to serve seven years in labor camp for defending Grigorenko against the charge of insanity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sabshin"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sabshin, Melvin|title=Changing American psychiatry: a personal perspective|year=2009|publisher=American Psychiatric Pub|isbn=1-58562-307-5|pages=95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fgCUrffGCfcC&amp;pg=PA95}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesty International]] declared Grigorenko a [[prisoner of conscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Prisoners of conscience in the USSR: Their treatment and conditions|date=1975|publisher=Amnesty International Publications|location=London|isbn=0900058137|page=118|url=https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/204000/eur460011975en.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151113193818/https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/204000/eur460011975en.pdf|archivedate=13 November 2015|dead-url=no|format=PDF, immediate download}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grigorenko became the key defender of [[Crimean Tatars]] deported to [[Soviet Central Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Глузман, Семён|title=О чем не написал самиздат|trans-title=About what samizdat did not write|url=http://gazeta.zn.ua/SOCIETY/o_chem_ne_napisal_samizdat.html|work=[[Mirror Weekly]]|date=14 December 2007|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He advised the Tatar activists not to confine their protests to the USSR, but to appeal also to international organizations including the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Redlich, Shimon|title=Jewish appeals in the USSR: An expression of national revival|journal=Soviet Jewish Affairs|date=1974|volume=4|issue=2|pages=24–37|doi=10.1080/13501677408577192|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13501677408577192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grigorenko was one of the first who questioned the  official Soviet version of [[World War II]] history. He pointed out that just prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German attack]] on June 22, 1941, vast Soviet troops were concentrated in the area west of [[Białystok]], deep in occupied [[Poland]], getting ready for a surprise offensive, which made them vulnerable to be encircled in case of surprise [[Germany|German]] attack. His ideas were later advanced by [[Viktor Suvorov]].

==Family==

Petro Grigorenko was married to Zinaida Mikhailovna Grigorenko&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=In the psychiatric hospitals|journal=[[A Chronicle of Current Events]]|page=59|date=1976|issue=Nr 32, 33|publisher=Amnesty International Publications|url=https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/204000/eur460011976eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they had five sons: Anatoly, Georgi, Oleg, Viktor and Andrew.&lt;ref name=Barron/&gt; Two of them died as children.&lt;ref name=Aleshchenko/&gt;

If he did not stop speaking out in defense of human rights and his father, they told him, he would also be sent to the [[psikhushka]].&lt;ref name=Grigorenko/&gt;

==Name spelling versions==
The different Latin spellings of Grigorenko's name exist due to the lack of uniform transliteration rules for the Ukrainian names in the middle of 20th century, when he became internationally known. The correct modern transliteration would be ''Petro Hryhorenko''. However, according to the American identification documents of the late general the official spelling of his name was established as ''Petro Grigorenko''. The same spelling is engraved on his gravestone at the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA|Ukrainian Orthodox Church of St. Andrew]] in [[South Bound Brook, New Jersey]], USA. The same spelling is also retained by his surviving American descendants: son Andrew and granddaughters Tatiana and Olga.

'''Poitevin''' (''Poetevin'') is a language spoken in [[Poitou]], [[France]]. It is one of the regional [[languages of France]] and is not as commonly spoken as it once was, as the standard form of [[French language|French]] now predominates. Poitevin is now classified as one of the [[Oïl languages|langues d'oïl]] but is distinguished by certain features of the [[langue d'oc]]. The language is spoken on what was the border between the two language families of ''oïl'' and ''oc'' (placenames in the region clearly show historical settlement of ''oc'' speakers). The langue d’oïl subsequently spread south, absorbing ''oc'' features.

Poitevin is also widely referred to as ''parlanjhe'' (the language). [[François Rabelais]] wrote that he learned this dialect, along with many other languages and dialects, since he was educated in [[Fontenay-le-Comte]]. [[François Villon]] spoke some Poitevin as well.

The earliest attested written use of the language is in charters and legal documents dating from the 13th century; people who spoke it were known as the [[Poitevins]]. The earliest printed text is dated 1554 (La Gente Poitevinrie). A tradition of theatrical writing and dramatic monologues for performance typifies the literary output in the language, although from the 19th century and in the 20th century (especially with the publication of a weekly paper ''Le Subiet'' from 1901) regular journalistic production was also established. Geste Editions publishes a number of books in/about the Poitevin-Santongese language.
Some linguists assert that the Serments de Strasbourg, the first text in French according to the official state position in France, were actually written in Poitevin.

In 1973, a standard [[orthography]] was proposed.

The easternmost part of the [[Poitou]] ''[[régions in France|région]]'' is home to a minority of [[Occitan]]-speakers though. Outside [[France]] the language is spoken in [[Northern California]], especially in [[Sacramento]], [[Plumas County, California|Plumas]], [[Tehama, California|Tehama]] and [[Siskiyou County, California|Siskiyou]] counties, the latter with both large French ancestry and speaking populations. [[Acadian French]] is the result of a Poitevin-Santongese language blended with French and local innovations or archaisms.

[[File:Stefan Ramult-Pomeranian Dictionary.png|thumb|220px|[[Stefan Ramułt]]'s ''Dictionary of the Pomeranian (Kashubian) language'', published in [[Kraków]], 1893.]]

The '''Pomeranian language''' ({{lang-pl|grupa pomorska języków lechickich}}, {{lang-de|pomoranische Sprache}}) is a group of [[dialects]] from the [[Lechitic languages|Lechitic cluster]] of the [[West Slavic languages]]. In medieval contexts, it refers to the dialects spoken by the [[Pomeranians (Slavic tribe)|Slavic Pomeranians]]. In modern contexts, the term is sometimes used synonymously with "[[Kashubian language|Kashubian]]" and may also include extinct [[Slovincian language|Slovincian]].

The name ''[[Pomerania]]'' comes from [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] {{lang|sla|po more}}, which means "[land] by the sea".&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|de|[http://www.pommersches-landesmuseum.de/kulturreferat-fuer-pommern/aufgaben/aufgaben.html ''Der Name Pommern (po more) ist slawischer Herkunft und bedeutet so viel wie „Land am Meer“.'']}} ({{lang|de|Pommersches Landesmuseum}}, German)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Pomeranian==
{{further|Pomerania during the Early Middle Ages}}

During the [[early Middle Ages|early medieval]] [[Slavic migrations]], the area between the [[Oder]] and [[Vistula]] rivers [[Pomerania during the Early Middle Ages|was settled]] by tribes grouped as [[Pomeranians (Slavic tribe)|Pomeranians]]. Their dialects, sometimes referred to as Ancient Pomeranian, had transitory character between the [[Polabian language|Polabian dialects]] spoken west of [[Pomerania]], and the [[Old Polish language|Old Polish dialects]] spoken to the Southeast. While there are no surviving documents written in Pomeranian, medieval Pomeranian names are mentioned in contemporary documents written in other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zemła |first=M. |title=Lexikon der Sprachen des europäischen Ostens |editor-last=Okuka |editor-first=M. |location=Klagenfurt |year=2002 |pages=965–966 |chapter=Pomoranisch |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slovincian and Kashubian==
{{main|Slovincian|Kashubian language}}
{{further|Pomerania during the High Middle Ages|Ostsiedlung}}

[[Pomerania during the High Middle Ages|During the High Middle Ages]], [[Germans|German]] immigration and assimilation of the Slavic Pomeranians ({{lang|de|[[Ostsiedlung]]}}) introduced [[Low German]] 
[[East Pomeranian dialect|East Pomeranian]], 
[[Central Pomeranian dialect|Central Pomeranian]], and [[Mecklenburgisch-Vorpommersch dialect|{{lang|de|Mecklenburgisch-Vorpommersch|nocat=y}} dialects]], which became dominant in Pomerania except for some areas in the East, where the populace remained largely Slavic and continued the use of the Slavic Pomeranian language. This was especially the case in [[Pomerelia]], where the Slavic population became known as [[Kashubians]] and their language accordingly as [[Kashubian language|Kashubian]]. An insular Slavic Pomeranian dialect spoken northwest of [[Kashubia]] until the 20th century became known as [[Slovincian]]. It is disputed whether Slovincian may be regarded as a dialect of Kashubian or a separate language. Likewise, it is disputed whether Kashubian may be regarded as a dialect of Polish or a separate language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lubaś |first=W. |title=Lexikon der Sprachen des europäischen Ostens |editor-last=Okuka |editor-first=M. |location=Klagenfurt |year=2002 |pages=265–273 |chapter=Kaschubisch |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stefan Ramułt]] (1859–1913) was fascinated by [[Florian Ceynowa]] and decidedly supported giving Kashubian the status of a full-fledged standard language.

==Influence on other dialects==

The Pomeranian language influenced the formation of other [[Polish language]] dialects, such as: the Kociewski, Borowiacki and Krajniacki dialects. Undoubtedly, they belong to the Polish language, but they also have some features in common with the Pomeranian language, which proves their character was transitional.

[[Friedrich Lorentz]] supposed that Kociewski and Borewiacki dialects first belonged to the Pomeranian language and was then Polonized as a result of the Polish colonization of these territories. According to [[Lorentz]], the Krajniacki dialect most probably was originally a part of the Polish language.

The common feature of the Kociewski dialects and the [[Kashubian language]] is, for example, the partial preservation of the so-called “TarT” group and a part of its lexis also. For the Borowiacki dialects and the Pomeranian language, the common feature was affrication of dorsal consonants.

The Pomeranian language also influenced the [[Low German]] dialects, which were used in [[Pomerania]]. After [[Germanisation]], the population of [[Western Pomerania]] started to use the Low German dialects. Those dialects, though, were influenced by the Pomeranian language (Slavic).
Most words originating from Pomeranian can be found in vocabulary connected with fishery and farming. The word {{lang|nds|Zeese}} / {{lang|nds|Zehse}} may serve as an example. It describes a kind of a fishing net and is still known in the Low German dialects of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] today. The word comes from the old Pomeranian word of the same meaning: {{lang|csb|seza}}. It moved to Kashubian and [[Slovincian]] dialects through Low German, and appeared in Pomeranian dictionaries as {{lang|csb|ceza}} meaning “flounder and perch fishing net”. Thus, it is so called “reverse loan-word” as the Pomeranian language borrowed the word from Low German in which it functioned as “[[Pomoranism]]” (a borrowing from the Pomeranian language).

A borrowing from the Pomeranian language which has been used in everyday German language and has appeared in dictionaries is a phrase “{{lang|de|dalli, dalli}}” (it means: come on, come on). It moved to the [[German language]] through the German dialects of [[West Prussia]], and is also present in the Kashubian language (spelled: {{lang|csb|dali, dali}})

==Assessment==

The classification of the Pomeranian [[ethnolect]] is problematic. It was classified by [[Aleksander Bruckner]] as one of the Old [[Polish language|Polish]] dialects. At the same time, he classified the extant [[Kashubian language|Kashubian]] and [[Slovincian]] dialects as those belonging to the Modern Polish language. Other linguists relate the Pomeranian language to the [[Polabian language|Polabian]] group of dialects (forming the Pomeranian-Polabian group). 

After Slovincian and all the Pomeranian dialects (except Kashubian) became extinct, the [[Kashubian language]] is the term most often used in relation to the language spoken by the [[Pomeranians (Slavic tribe)|Pomeranians]]. However, it is still not clear from where the words “[[Kashubians]]” and “Kashubian” ({{lang-pl|Kaszubi}} and {{lang|pl|Kaszubski}}, {{lang-csb|Kaszëbi}} and {{lang|csb|kaszëbsczi}}) originated and how they were brought from the area near [[Koszalin]] to [[Pomerelia]]. None of the theories proposed has been widely accepted so far. There is also no indication Pomeranians wandered from the area of Koszalin to Pomerelia.

While [[Western Pomerania]] was being Germanized, the Germans (both colonizers and Germanized descendants of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] Pomeranians) started using the words “Pomeranian” ({{lang-de|Pommersch}}; {{lang-pl|pomorski|links=no}}) and “Pomeranians” ({{lang-de|Pommern|nocat=y}}; {{lang-pl|Pomorzacy|nocat=y}}) referring to their own population. The part of the Pomeranian population which kept their Slavic language was called the Wends ({{lang-de|Wenden|nocat=y}}) or the Kashubians ({{lang-de|Kaschuben|nocat=y}}). As the West lost its Slavic character, those two terms were more often used in the East.
In 1850, in the preface to his Kashubian-Russian dictionary, [[Florian Ceynowa]] wrote about the language of Baltic Slavic peoples:

: Usually it is called the "Kashubian language", although the "Pomeranian-Slovenian dialect" would be a more proper term

The word dialect was probably used by Ceynowa because he was a follower of [[Pan-Slavism]], according to which all the [[Slavic languages]] were dialects of one Slavic language. In his later works, though, he called his language {{lang|pl|kaszébsko-słovjinsko móva}}.

In 1893, [[Stefan Ramułt]], the [[Jagiellonian University]] linguist, referred to the early history of Pomerania, publishing the ''Dictionary of the Pomoranian i.e. Kashubian Language''. In the preface, Ramułt wrote:

: As Kashubians are the direct descendants of Pomeranians, it is right to use the words Pomeranian and Kashubian as synonyms. Especially as there are other reasons for it as well...

and

: Kashubians and Slavs are what remains of the once powerful Pomeranian tribe and they are the only inheritors of the name Pomeranians.

[[Friedrich Lorentz]] (the author of ''Pomeranian Grammar'' and ''The History of Pomeranian/Kashubian Language'') referred in his works to Ramułt’s dictionary. After Lorentz died, [[Friedhelm Hinze]] published a great Pomeranian dictionary in five volumes ({{lang|de|Pomoranisches Wörterbuch}}), which was based on Lorentz’s writing.

===The status of Kashubian today===

The Pomeranian language, and its only surviving form, Kashubian, traditionally have not been recognized by the majority of Polish linguists, and have been treated in Poland as "the most distinct dialect of Polish". However, there have also been some Polish linguists who treated Pomeranian as a separate language. The most prominent of them were [[Stefan Ramułt]], and [[Alfred Majewicz]], who overtly called Kashubian a language in the 1980s.

Following the collapse of [[communism in Poland]], attitudes on the status of Kashubian have been gradually changing. It is increasingly seen as a fully-fledged language, as it is taught in state schools and has some limited usage on public radio and television.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} A bill passed by the [[Sejm|Polish parliament]] in 2005 recognizes it as the only [[regional language]] in the [[Republic of Poland]], and provides for its use in official contexts in 10 communes where its speakers constitute at least 20% of the population.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

[[File:Iranian Family Tree v2.0.png|thumb|[[Iranian languages]] family tree]]
As Shabaki is one of the [[Zaza–Gorani languages]], it is most similar to languages like [[Gorani language|Gorani]] (Hewrami), [[Bajelani language|Bajelani]], [[Sarli language|Sarli]] and [[Zaza language|Zazaki]]. Because Zaza–Gorani belongs to the [[Northwestern Iranian languages|Northwestern Iranian branch]].

Shabaki is a language in its own right and not a spoken dialect of any other language, with its own vocabulary and pronunciations, despite the fact that words from many other languages have entered into it as a result of the geographical nearness to other ethnic tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.niqash.org/en/articles/society/1862/|title=The Shabak - A Brief Overview|last=Glenewinkel|first=Klaas|work=Niqash|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Situation of the language==
The [[Shabak people]] fear the demise of the Shabaki language especially after the occupation of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS terrorist]] groups to their home in [[Nineveh plains|Nineveh plain]], which led to the displacement of the majority of their population and the other groups residing in that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://telegram7.com/?p=475|title=International Mother Language Day in Karbala, Iraq - Telegram7|date=2015-03-03|work=Telegram7|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''subject''' is a being who has a [[subjective consciousness|unique consciousness]] and/or unique [[personhood|personal experiences]], or an entity that has a relationship with another entity that exists outside itself (called an "[[Object (philosophy)|object]]").

A ''subject'' is an observer and an ''object'' is a thing observed. This concept is especially important in [[Continental philosophy]], where 'the subject' is a central term in debates over the nature of the self.&lt;ref name=:0/&gt; The nature of the subject is also central in debates over the nature of [[subjective experience]] within the Anglo-American tradition of [[analytical philosophy]].

The sharp distinction between subject and object corresponds to the distinction, in the philosophy of [[René Descartes]], between thought and extension. Descartes believed that [[Mental substance|thought]] ([[subjectivity]]) was the essence of the mind, and that [[res extensa|extension]] (the occupation of space) was the essence of matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Descartes|first=René |title=The Principles of Philosophy|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/4391/pg4391-images.html|section=LIII|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==German idealism==
''Subject'' as a key-term in thinking about human [[consciousness]] began its career with the [[German Idealist]]s, in response to [[David Hume]]'s radical [[skepticism]]. The idealists' starting point was Hume's conclusion that there is nothing to the self over and above a big, fleeting bundle of perceptions.  The next step was to ask how this undifferentiated bundle comes to be experienced as a unity&amp;nbsp;– as a single ''subject''. Hume had offered the following proposal:

:"''...the imagination must by long custom acquire the same method of thinking, and run along the parts of space and time in conceiving its objects.''&lt;ref&gt;Hume, David. {{Google books|6c3f0NqRmnUC|The Philosophical Works of David Hume (1826 edition)|page=27|19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and their successors sought to flesh out the process by which the subject is constituted out of the flow of sense impressions.  Hegel, for example, stated in his Preface to the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' that a subject is constituted by "the process of reflectively mediating itself with itself."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/ph/phprefac.htm Preface to the ''Phenomenology of Spirit'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel begins his definition of the subject at a standpoint derived from [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] physics: "the unmoved which is also ''self-moving''" (Preface, para. 22).  That is, what is not moved by an outside force, but which propels itself, has a ''prima facie'' case for subjectivity.  Hegel's next step, however, is to identify this power to move, this unrest that is the subject, as ''pure negativity''.  Subjective self-motion, for Hegel, comes not from any pure or simple kernel of authentic individuality, but rather, it is

::"...the bifurcation of the simple; it is the doubling which sets up opposition, and then again the negation of this indifferent diversity and of its anti-thesis" (Preface, para. 18).

The Hegelian subject's ''modus operandi'' is therefore cutting, splitting and introducing distinctions by injecting negation into the flow of sense-perceptions.  Subjectivity is thus a kind of structural effect&amp;nbsp;– what happens when Nature is diffused, refracted around a field of negativity and the "unity of the subject" for Hegel, is in fact a second-order effect, a "negation of negation".  The subject experiences itself as a unity only by purposively negating the very diversity it itself had produced. The Hegelian subject may therefore be characterized either as "self-restoring sameness" or else as "reflection in otherness within itself" (Preface, para. 18).

The thinking of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Sigmund Freud]] provided a point of departure for questioning the notion of a unitary, autonomous Subject, which for many thinkers in the Continental tradition is seen as the foundation of the [[liberal theory]] of the [[social contract]].  These thinkers opened up the way for the [[deconstruction]] of the subject as a core-concept of [[metaphysics]].

Sigmund Freud's explorations of the [[unconscious mind]] added up to a wholesale indictment of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] notions of subjectivity.

Among the most radical re-thinkers of human self-consciousness was [[Martin Heidegger]], whose concept of ''[[Dasein]]'' or "Being-there" displaces traditional notions of the personal subject altogether. With Heidegger, phenomenology tries to go beyond the classical dichotomy between subject and object, because they are linked by an inseparable and original relationship, in the sense that  there can be no world without a subject, nor the subject without world.&lt;ref&gt;Farina, Gabriella (2014). [http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A14-07.pdf Some reflections on the phenomenological method]". ''Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences'', '''7'''(2):506–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Lacan]], inspired by Heidegger and [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], built on Freud's [[psychoanalytic]] model of the subject, in which the "'''[[Splitting (psychology)|split]] subject'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;" is constituted by a [[double bind]]: alienated from [[jouissance]] when he or she leaves [[the Real]], enters into [[the Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|the Imaginary]] (during the [[mirror stage]]), and separates from the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]] when he or she comes into the realm of language, difference, and [[Demand (psychoanalysis)|demand]] in [[the Symbolic]] or [[the Name of the Father]].&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Stewart, Maire Jaanus, Richard Feldstein (eds.), ''Lacan in the German-Speaking World'', SUNY Press, 2004, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thinkers such as [[structural Marxist]] [[Louis Althusser]] and [[poststructuralist]] [[Michel Foucault]]&lt;ref name=:0&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/en/heartfield-james.htm#n13 |title = Postmodernism and the 'Death of the Subject' |last = Heartfield |first = James |year = 2002 |work = The Death of the Subject |accessdate= 28 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; theorize the subject as a [[social construction]], the so-called '''poststructuralist subject'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Edel Heuven, "The Poststructuralist Subject and the Paradox of Internal Coherence", M.Sc. thesis, Wageningen University and Research, 2017, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Althusser, the "subject" is an [[Ideology|ideological]] construction (more exactly, constructed by the "[[Louis Althusser#Ideological state apparatuses|Ideological State Apparatuses]]"). One's subjectivity exists, "always already" and is discovered through the process of [[Interpellation (philosophy)|interpellation]]. Ideology inaugurates one into being a subject, and every ideology is intended to maintain and glorify its idealized subject, as well as the metaphysical category of the subject itself (see [[antihumanism]]). 

According to Foucault, it is the "effect" of [[power (sociology)#Foucault|power]] and "[[disciplinary institutions|disciplines]]" (see ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'': construction of the subject ('''subjectivation'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; or '''subjectification''', {{lang-fr|assujettissement}}) as student, soldier, "criminal", etc.). Foucault believed it was possible to transform oneself; he used the word '''''ethopoiein'''''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; from the word ''ethos'' to describe the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Foucault | first = Michel | title = The hermeneutics of the subject : lectures at the Collège de France, 1981-1982 | publisher = Picador | location = New York | year = 2006 | pages= 237 | isbn = 9780312425708 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjectification was a central concept in [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]'s work as well.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Genosko (ed.), ''Deleuze and Guattari: Deleuze and Guattari'', Routledge, 2001, p. 1315.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytic philosophy==
In contemporary [[analytic philosophy]], the issue of subject—and more specifically the "point of view" of the subject, or "subjectivity"—has received attention as one of the major intractable problems in [[philosophy of mind]] (a related issue being the [[mind–body problem]]). In the essay "[[What is it like to be a bat?]]", [[Thomas Nagel]] famously argued that explaining [[subjective experience]]—the "what it is like" to be something—is currently beyond the reach of scientific inquiry, because scientific understanding by definition requires an objective perspective, which, according to Nagel, is diametrically opposed to the subjective first-person point of view. Furthermore, one cannot have a definition of objectivity without being connected to subjectivity in the first place since they are mutual and interlocked.

In Nagel's book ''[[The View From Nowhere]]'', he asks: "What kind of fact is it that I am Thomas Nagel?". Subjects have a perspective but each subject has a unique perspective and this seems to be a fact in Nagel's view from nowhere (i.e. the birds-eye view of the objective description in the universe). The Indian view of "Brahman" suggests that the ultimate and fundamental subject is existence itself, through which each of us as it were "looks out" as an aspect of a frozen and timeless everything, experienced subjectively due to our separated sensory and memory apparati. These additional features of subjective experience are often referred to as ''[[qualia]]'' (see [[Frank Cameron Jackson]] and [[Mary's room]]).

'''TERMIUM Plus''' is an electronic [[Termbase|terminological database]] operated and maintained by the Translation Bureau, under the Government of [[Canada]]. The database offers millions of [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] terms from various specialized fields. Terms in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] are also available in the multilingual database.

== History ==
TERMIUM Plus was initially developed by the [[Université de Montréal]] in October 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Gagnon 1994, p. 509&lt;/ref&gt; The database, initially named Banque de Terminologie de l’Université de Montréal (BTUM), was under the direction of Marcel Paré, with a vision to produce the most flexible bilingual language file that would be available to all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dubuc |first1=Robert |title=Termium: System Description |journal=Meta: Journal des traducteurs |date=December 1972 |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=203–219 |doi=10.7202/002642ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; BTUM was initially funded by private donors and government subsidies, and it grew with the help of professionals in the field of translation over the following years.&lt;ref&gt;Gagnon 1994, p. 509&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, the BTUM was able to obtain data and user responses in collaboration with the language services of Bell Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Gagnon 1994, p. 509&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dubuc |first1=Robert |last2=Paré |first2=Marcel |last3=Grégoire |first3=Jean-François |title=Description du système Termium |journal=Lebende Sprachen |date=1978 |volume=23 |issue=1 |page=3–8 |doi=10.1515/les.1978.23.1.3| language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 1974, however, the [[Translation Bureau]] under the Canadian Secretary of State Department showed interest in the operation of BTUM.&lt;ref&gt;Dupont 1989, p. 594&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the Translation Bureau at the time was to standardize terminology throughout the public service, as well as the federal public administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Landry |first1=Alain |title=Termium au service de la traduction |journal=Équivalences |date=1983 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=57–60 |doi=10.3406/equiv.1983.1081| language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adshead 1987, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1976, the Canadian Secretary of State Department officially acquired BTUM, and renamed the database ''TERMIUM'' ('''TERMI'''nologie '''U'''niversité de '''M'''ontréal).&lt;ref&gt;Gagnon 1994, p. 509&lt;/ref&gt; The system was then transferred to the central computer of the [[Federal Government of Canada|federal government]] in [[Ottawa]], and began to integrate approximately 175,000 files that the BTUM initially compiled with the files that the Translation Bureau had been working on.&lt;ref&gt;Gagnon 1994, p. 509&lt;/ref&gt; In the years to follow, the bureau began the sorting process, along with the input process onto the computer. The database grew to 900,000 records by 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Gagnon 1994, p. 509&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
As terminological records grew in the TERMIUM database, the Canadian government received a proposal, in 1985, from a [[Toronto]]-based company to launch TERMIUM in a [[CD-ROM]] format, in order to make the database more accessible to users.&lt;ref&gt;Dupont 1989, p. 595&lt;/ref&gt; By fall of 1987, a pilot project for CD-ROM was launched to investigate the responses from its users, which included services under the Translation Bureau and other private Canadian companies.&lt;ref&gt;Dupont 1989, p. 595&lt;/ref&gt; After some data compilation and investigation, the bureau incorporated an indexing system to improve the speed and accuracy of term extraction.

By 1990, TERMIUM on CD-ROM was commercially available through subscription (with an annual fee of $1,100 to $1,500).&lt;ref&gt;Gagnon 1994, p. 512&lt;/ref&gt; Updates were released every three to four months.&lt;ref&gt;Gagnon 1994, p. 512&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, TERMIUM on CD-ROM received an award from ATIO (The Association of Translators and Interpreters of Ontario).

In October 2009, TERMIUM Plus and an array of language tools under the [https://www.noslangues-ourlanguages.gc.ca/ Language Portal of Canada] were launched with free online access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Public Works and Government Services Canada |title=Government of Canada announces launch of its Language Portal and free access to TERMIUM Plus® for all Canadians - Canada.ca |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/news/archive/2009/10/government-canada-announces-launch-language-portal-free-access-termium-plus-all-canadians.html |website=Government of Canada |accessdate=1 December 2015 |language=en |date=8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
TERMIUM was initially developed to contain terminological records in both of Canada’s official languages (English and French).&lt;ref&gt;Gagnon 1994, p. 510&lt;/ref&gt; As the system upgraded to its third-generation version in 1985, it contained records in other languages such as Spanish, in order to accommodate its growing range of users.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen 1987, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; It is worth noting, however, that in these “multilingual” records, the term in the source language would be in English or French, with its equivalent in a non-official language.&lt;ref&gt;Adshead 1987, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there is a vast collection of specialized domains and fields covered by TERMIUM Plus, ranging from [[Administration (government)|administration]] (including appellations), [[The arts|arts,]] [[science]]s to [[law]] and justice.

Aside from the millions of entries recorded by TERMIUM Plus, the database also contains writing tools for both the English and French language (such as ''The Canadian Style'', a writing [[style guide]]; and ''Dictionnaire des cooccurrences'', a guide to French [[collocation]]s), archived [[Glossary|glossaries]], as well as a link to the Language Portal of Canada (containing various French and English writing resources).

A '''tithe''' ({{IPAc-en|t|aɪ|ð}}; from [[Old English language|Old English]]: ''teogoþa'' "tenth") is a one-tenth part of something, paid as a contribution to a religious organization or compulsory [[tax]] to government.&lt;ref name=burg&gt;{{cite book |title=A World History of Tax Rebellions |author=David F. Burg |year=2004 |pages=viii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T91k6HAODzAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=9780203500897}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, tithes are normally voluntary and paid in [[money|cash]], [[cheque]]s, or [[stock]]s, whereas historically tithes were required and paid in kind, such as agricultural products. Several European countries operate a formal process linked to the tax system allowing some churches to assess tithes.

Traditional [[Jewish law]] and practice has included various forms of tithing since ancient times. [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] commonly practice ''ma'aser kesafim'' (tithing 10% of their income to [[Charity (practice)|charity]]). In modern Israel, Jews continue to follow the laws of agricultural tithing, e.g., ''[[ma'aser rishon]]'', ''[[Terumat Ma'aser|terumat ma'aser]]'', and ''[[ma'aser sheni]]''. 

With respect to [[Christianity]], [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]] taught the Jews that "tithing must be done in conjunction with a deep concern for justice, mercy and faithfulness" (Matthew 23:23).&lt;ref name="SmithEmerson2008"/&gt; Tithing was taught at early Christian [[ecumenical council]]s, including the [[Council of Tours]] in 567, as well as the [[Synod of Mâcon]] in 585, and remains an important doctrine in many [[Christian denominations]], such as the [[Congregationalist Church]]es, [[Methodist Church]]es and [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]].&lt;ref name="SmithEmerson2008"/&gt;

==Ancient Near East==
None of the extant extrabiblical laws of the [[Ancient Near East]] deal with tithing, although other secondary documents show that it was a widespread practice in the Ancient Near East.&lt;ref&gt;D.

"The Tithes in the Old Testament." H. Jagersma Brussels I. Introduction "In the Old Testament as well as in other Ancient Near Eastern literature, we find only scant evidence for the practice of tithing and the collection of tithes."&lt;/ref&gt;

In {{bibleref2 |Genesis |14:18–20}}, [[Abraham]], after rescuing [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]], met with [[Melchizedek]]. After Melchizedek's blessing, Abraham gave him a tenth of everything he has obtained from battle:
{{quote|"Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High, and he blessed Abram, saying, “Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth. And praise be to God Most High, who delivered your enemies into your hand.” Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything.”|Genesis 14:18–20}}

In {{bibleref2|Genesis|28:12–22}}, [[Jacob]], after his [[Vision (spirituality)|visionary]] [[Dream#In Abrahamic religions|dream]] of [[Jacob's Ladder]] and receiving a blessing from God, promises God a tenth:
{{quote|"Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, “Surely the Lord is in this place, and I did not know it.” And he was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.”

So early in the morning Jacob took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it. He called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz at the first. Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear, so that I come again to my father's house in peace, then the Lord shall be my God, and this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house. And of all that you give me I will give a full tenth to you.”|Genesis 28:12–22}}

The tithe system was organized in a three-year cycle, corresponding to the ''[[Shemittah]]''-cycle. These tithes were in reality more like taxes for the people of Israel and were mandatory, not optional giving. This tithe was distributed locally "within thy gates" ({{sourcetext|source=Bible (King James)|book=Deuteronomy|chapter=14|verse=28}}) to support the Levites and assist the poor.

Every year, ''[[First Fruits|Bikkurim]]'', ''[[Terumah]]'', ''Ma'aser Rishon'' and ''Terumat Ma'aser'' were separated from the grain, wine and oil ({{bibleverse| |Deuteronomy |14:22 |JP}}). (As regards other fruit and produce, the Biblical requirement to tithe is a source of debate.) The ''first tithe'' is giving of one tenth of agricultural produce (after the giving of the standard ''[[terumah]]'') to the [[Levite]] (or Aaronic [[Kohen|priests]]). Historically, during the [[First Temple]] period, the first tithe was given to the [[Levite]]s.  Approximately at the beginning of the [[Second Temple]] construction, [[Ezra]] and his [[Beth din]] implemented its giving to the kohanim.&lt;ref&gt;The Talmud [[Adin Steinsaltz]] 1992 "Yet if a priest has first tithe in his possession, he need not give it to a Levite. Ezra penalized the Levites of his generation because they did not return to Eretz Israel with him, and he decreed that first tithe should be given to ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Restoration: Old Testament, Jewish, and Christian perspectives '' p. 329 James M. Scott. 2001 "One says that the Levites were punished because they did not come up to the Land of Israel during Ezra's days. The other says that the first tithe was given to the priests, so that they would have food when they were in a state of ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other offerings which were restricted to consumption within the [[tabernacle]], the ''[[second tithe]]'' could be consumed anywhere . On years one, two, four and five of the ''Shemittah''-cycle, God commanded the [[Children of Israel]] to take a second tithe that was to be brought to the place of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] ({{bibleverse| |Deuteronomy |14:23 |JP}}). The owner of the produce was to separate and bring 1/10 of his finished produce to the [[Old City of Jerusalem]] after separating ''Terumah'' and the [[first tithe]], but if the family lived too far from Jerusalem, the tithe could be redeemed upon coins ({{bibleverse| |Deuteronomy |14:24–25 |JP}}). Then, the Bible required the owner of the redeemed coins to spend the tithe "to buy whatever you like: cattle, sheep, wine or other fermented drink, or anything you wish" ({{bibleverse| |Deuteronomy |14:26 |JP}}). Implicit in the commandment was an obligation to spend the coins on items meant for human consumption.

In years three and six of the ''Shemittah''-cycle the Israelites set aside the (second) tithe instead as the ''[[poor tithe]]'', and it was given to the strangers, orphans, and widows.

The Levites, also known as the Tribe of Levi, were descendants of [[Levi]]. They were assistants to the Aaronic [[Kohen|priests]] (who were the children of [[Aaron]] and, therefore, a subset of the Tribe of Levi) and did not own or inherit a territorial [[Property|patrimony]] ({{sourcetext |source=Bible (King James) |book=Numbers |chapter=18 |verse=21 |range=-28}}). Their function in society was that of temple functionaries, teachers and trusted civil servants who supervised the weights and scales and witnessed agreements. The goods donated from the other Israeli tribes were their source of sustenance. They received from "all Israel" a tithe of food or livestock for support, and in turn would set aside a tenth portion of that tithe (known as the ''[[Terumat hamaaser]]'') for the Aaronic priests.

An additional tithe mentioned in the Book of Leviticus ({{bibleverse-nb||Lv|27:32–33|JP}}) is the [[cattle tithe]], which is to be sacrificed as a ''[[korban]]'' at the [[Temple in Jerusalem]].

===United Kingdom of Israel===
{{further|Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)}}
[[LMLK seal]]s may represent the oldest archaeological evidence of tithing. About 10 percent of the storage jars manufactured during [[Hezekiah]]'s reign (circa 700 BC) were stamped (Grena, 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;376–78). See [[Books of Chronicles|2 Chronicles]] 29–31 for a record of this early worship reformation.

The [[Book of Nehemiah]] also talks about the collection of tithes to Leviim and distribution of Terumah to the priests: {{bibleverse||Nehemiah|13:5|JP}}. People were actually appointed to collect mandatory tithes and place them in specially designated chambers which eventually came to be known as storehouses: {{sourcetext |source=Bible (King James) |book=Nehemiah |chapter=12 |verse=44}}.

===Minor Prophets===
{{further|Minor Prophets}}
The [[Book of Malachi]] has one of the most quoted Biblical passages about tithing, directed to the sons of Jacob:

{{quote|For I, Jehovah, change not; therefore ye, O sons of Jacob, are not consumed. From the days of your fathers ye have turned aside from mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith Jehovah of hosts. But ye say, Wherein shall we return? "Will man rob God? Yet you are robbing me. But you say, ‘How have we robbed you?’ In your tithes and contributions. You are cursed with a curse, for you are robbing me, the whole nation of you. Bring the full tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. And thereby put me to the test, says the Lord of hosts, if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you a blessing until there is no more need. I will rebuke the devourer for you, so that it will not destroy the fruits of your soil, and your vine in the field shall not fail to bear, says the Lord of hosts. Then all nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land of delight, says the Lord of hosts."|{{bibleref2 |Malachi |3:6–12}}}}

==Deuterocanonical==
{{further|Deuterocanonical books|Biblical apocrypha}}
The [[Deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical]] [[Book of Tobit]] provides an example of all three classes of tithes practiced during the [[Babylonian captivity]]:
{{quote|"I would often go by myself to Jerusalem on religious holidays, as the Law commanded for every Israelite for all time. I would hurry off to Jerusalem and take with me the early produce of my crops, a tenth of my flocks, and the first portion of the wool cut from my sheep. I would present these things at the altar to the priests, the descendants of Aaron. I would give the first tenth of my grain, wine, olive oil, pomegranates, figs, and other fruit to the Levites who served in Jerusalem. For six out of seven years, I also brought the cash equivalent of the second tenth of these crops to Jerusalem where I would spend it every year. I gave this to orphans and widows, and to Gentiles who had joined Israel. In the third year, when I brought and gave it to them, we would eat together according to the instruction recorded in Moses’ Law, as Deborah my grandmother had taught me..."|{{bibleref2 |Tobit |1:6-8 |CEB}}}}

==Judaism==
{{Main article|Tithes in Judaism}}
Orthodox Jews continue to follow the laws of [[Heave offering|''Terumah'']] and [[First tithe|''Ma'aser'']] as well as the custom of tithing 10% of one's earnings to charity (''ma'aser kesafim''). Due to doubts concerning the status of persons claiming to be Kohanim or Levi'im arising after severe Roman/Christian persecutions and exile, the Hebrew Bible tithe of 10% for the Levites, and "tithe of the tithe" ({{bibleverse| |Numbers |18:26 |JP}}) of 10% of 10% (1%) for the priests are dealt with in accordance with Jewish Law.{{clarify|date=January 2016}} The [[Mishnah]] and [[Talmud]] contain analysis of the [[Maaser Rishon|first tithe]], [[Maaser Sheni|second tithe]] and [[Maaser Ani|poor tithe]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite Jewish Encyclopedia |noicon=1|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10232-ma-aserot |title=MA'ASEROT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church collection of religious offerings and taxes===
====England and Wales====
The right to receive tithes was granted to the English churches by [[Ethelwulf of Wessex|King Ethelwulf]] in 855. The [[Saladin tithe]] was a royal tax, but assessed using ecclesiastical boundaries, in 1188. The legal validity of the tithe system was affirmed under the [[Statute of Westminster 1285|Statute of Westminster]] of 1285. The [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] led to the transfer of many rights to tithe to secular landowners and [[the Crown]] – and tithes could be extinguished until 1577 under an Act of the 37th year of [[Henry VIII]]'s reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/details/C3252914-details|title=Middlesex: London City without the Walls: St Botolph without Aldgate, parish |work=The National Archives Collection IR 18/5462}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Smith]] criticized the system in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776), arguing that a fixed rent would encourage peasants to work far more efficiently.

[[Tithe#Tithes and tithe law in England before reform|See below]] for a fuller description and history, until the reforms of the 19th century, written by [[Sir William Blackstone]] and edited by other learned lawyers of the period.

[[File:Tithes poster 1837.jpg|thumb|Public notice demanding payment due on Tithes, 1837]]
The system gradually ended with the [[Tithe Commutation Act 1836]], whose long-lasting Tithe Commission replaced them with a commutation payment, land award and/or rentcharges to those paying the commutation payment and took the opportunity to map out (apportion) residual chancel liability where the rectory had been appropriated during the medieval period by a religious house or college. Its records give a snapshot of land ownership in most parishes, the Tithe Files, are a socio-economic history resource. The rolled-up payment of several years' tithe would be divided between the tithe-owners as at the date of their extinction.&lt;ref name=na&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/tithes/ How to look for records of Tithes –  The History of Tithes] The National Archives&lt;/ref&gt;

This commutation reduced problems to the ultimate payers by effectively folding tithes in with rents however, it could cause transitional money supply problems by raising the transaction demand for money. Later the decline of large landowners led [[leasehold estate|tenants]] to become [[freehold (English law)|freeholders]] and again have to pay directly; this also led to renewed objections of principle by non-[[Anglican]]s.&lt;ref&gt;One account of the objections in the 1920s and 1930s appears in the book ''The Tithe War'' by [[Doreen Wallace]] (London: Gollancz, 1934).&lt;/ref&gt; It also kept intact a system of chancel repair liability affecting the minority of parishes where the rectory had been lay-appropriated. The precise land affected in such places hinged on the content of documents such as the content of deeds of merger and apportionment maps.&lt;ref name=na/&gt;

=====Tithe redemption=====
Rent charges in lieu of abolished English tithes paid by landowners were converted by a public outlay of money under the [[Tithe Act 1936]] into [[annuity (financial contracts)|annuities]] paid to the state through the Tithe Redemption Commission. Such payments were transferred in 1960 to the Board of [[Inland Revenue]], and those remaining were terminated by the [[Finance Act 1977]].

The [[Tithe Act 1951]] established the compulsory redemption of English tithes by landowners where the annual amounts payable were less than £1 so abolishing the bureaucracy and costs of collecting small sums of money.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

====France====
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
[[File:Commanderie Coulommiers cour grange aux dimes.jpg|thumb|[[Knights Templar]] tithe barn (''la grange aux dîmes'') with red roof, [[Coulommiers, Seine-et-Marne]], France.]]
In [[France]], the tithes – called "la dîme" – were a land tax. Originally a voluntary tax, the "dîme" became mandatory in 1585. In principle, unlike the [[taille]], the "dîme" was levied on both noble and non-noble lands. The dîme was divided into a number of types, including the "grosses dîmes" (grains, wine, hay), "menues" or "vertes dîmes" (vegetables, poultry), "dîmes de charnage" (veal, lamb, pork). Although the term "dîme" comes from the Latin ''decima [pars]'' ("one tenth", with the same origin as that of the U.S. coin, the [[Dime (United States coin)|dime]]), the "dîme" rarely reached this percentage and (on the whole) it was closer to 1/13th of the agricultural production.

The "dîme" was originally meant to support the local parish, but by the 16th century many "dîmes" went directly to distant abbeys, monasteries, and bishops, leaving the local parish impoverished, and this contributed to general resentment. In the Middle Ages, some monasteries also offered the "dîme" in homage to local lords in exchange for their protection (see [[Feudalism]]) (these are called "dîmes inféodées"), but this practice was forbidden by the Lateran Council of 1179.

All religious taxes were constitutionally abolished in 1790, in the wake of the [[French Revolution]].

====Greece====
There has never been a separate church tax or mandatory tithe on Greek citizens. The state pays the salaries of the clergy of the established [[Church of Greece]], in return for use of real estate, mainly forestry, owned by the church. The remainder of church income comes from voluntary, tax-deductible donations from the faithful. These are handled by each [[diocese]] independently.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

====Ireland====
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
From the [[English Reformation]] in the 16th century, most Irish people chose to remain [[Roman Catholic]] and had by now to pay tithes valued at about 10 per cent of an area's agricultural produce, to maintain and fund the established state church, the [[Anglican]] [[Church of Ireland]], to which only a small minority of the population converted. [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland|Irish Presbyterians]] and other minorities like the [[Quaker]]s and [[Jew]]s were in the same situation.

The collection of tithes was resisted in the period 1831–36, known as the [[Tithe War]]. Thereafter, tithes were reduced and added to rents with the passing of the [[Tithe Commutation Act 1838|Tithe Commutation Act]] in 1836. With the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland by the [[Irish Church Act 1869]], tithes were abolished.

====United States====
While the federal government has never collected a church tax or mandatory tithe on its citizens, states &lt;!---such as Massachusetts, specifically--&gt; collected a tithe into the early 19th century. The United States and its governmental subdivisions also exempt most churches from payment of income tax (under Section [[501(c)(3)]] of the [[Internal Revenue Code]] and similar state statutes, which also allows donors to claim the donations as an income tax [[itemized deduction]]). Also, churches may be permitted exemption from other state and local taxes such as sales and property taxes, either in whole or in part. Clergy, such as ministers and members of religious orders (who have taken a vow of poverty) may be exempt from federal self-employment tax on income from ministerial services. Income from non-ministerial services are taxable and churches are required to withhold Federal and state income tax from this non-exempt income. They are also required to withhold employee's share of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] taxes under [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|FICA]], and pay the employer's share for the non-exempt income.&lt;ref name="IRS517"&gt;

====Spain and Latin America====
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
[[File:Casa reina mora.jpg|thumb|Casa de los Diezmos, [[Canillas de Aceituno]], Málaga, Spain]]
{{Main article|Diezmo}}
Both the tithe (''diezmo''), a levy of 10 per cent on all agricultural production, and "first fruits" (''primicias''), an additional harvest levy, were collected in [[Spain]] throughout the medieval and early modern periods for the support of local [[Catholic]] parishes.

The tithe crossed the Atlantic with the [[Spanish Empire]]; however, the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] who made up the vast majority of the population in colonial [[Spanish America]] were exempted from paying tithes on native crops such as corn and potatoes that they raised for their own subsistence. After some debate, Indians in colonial Spanish America were forced to pay tithes on their production of European agricultural products, including wheat, silk, cows, pigs, and sheep.

The tithe was abolished in several [[Latin America]]n countries, including [[Mexico]], soon after independence from Spain (which started in 1810). The tithe was abolished in Spain itself in 1841, and in Argentina in 1826.

{{Main|Church tax}}
====Austria====
In [[Austria]] a colloquially called [[church tax]] (''Kirchensteuer'', officially called ''Kirchenbeitrag'', i. e. ''church contribution'') has to be paid by members of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Protestant Church]]{{which|date=January 2017}}. It is levied by the churches themselves and not by the government. The obligation to pay church tax can just be evaded by an official declaration to cease church membership. The tax is calculated on the basis of personal income. It amounts to about 1.1 per cent (Catholic church) and 1.5 per cent (Protestant church).{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

====Denmark====
All members of the [[Church of Denmark]] pay a church tax, which varies between municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thedanishparliament.dk/Publications/My_Constitutional_Act_with_explanations/Chapter%207.aspx|title=Chapter 7 - The Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Denmark |last= |first= |date=2013-08-23 |website=Folketinget |access-date=2017-03-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331120111/http://www.thedanishparliament.dk/Publications/My_Constitutional_Act_with_explanations/Chapter%207.aspx|archive-date=31 March 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tax is generally around 1% of the taxable income.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

====Finland====
Members of [[Religion in Finland|state churches]] pay a church tax of between 1% and 2% of income, depending on the municipality. In addition, 2.55 per cent of corporate taxes are distributed to the state churches. Church taxes are integrated into the common national taxation system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://evl.fi/EVLfi.nsf/0/F4798384ACD179A1C22572E5003ACBF9?OpenDocument |title=Verot ja muut tulot |work=EVL.fi |publisher=Suomen evankelisluterilainen kirkko |language=Finnish |accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
[[Germany]] levies a [[church tax]], on all persons declaring themselves to be Christians, of roughly 8–9% of their income tax, which is effectively (very much depending on the social and financial situation) typically between 0.2% and 1.5% of the total income. The proceeds are shared among Catholic, Lutheran, and other Protestant Churches.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

The church tax ([[Kirchensteuer]]) actually traces its roots back as far as the [[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]] of 1803. It was reaffirmed in the [[Reichskonkordat|Concordat of 1933]] between Nazi Germany and the Catholic Church. Today its legal basis is article 140 of the [[Grundgesetz]] (the German "constitution") in connection with article 137 of the [[Weimar constitution]]. These laws originally merely allowed the churches themselves to tax their members, but in Nazi Germany, collection of church taxes was transferred to the German government. As a result, both the German government and the employer are notified of the religious affiliation of every taxpayer. This system is still in effect today. Mandatory disclosure of religious affiliation to government agencies or employers constituted a violation of the original European data protection directives but is now permitted after the German government obtained an exemption.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

Church tax (Kirchensteuer) is compulsory in Germany for those confessing members of a particular religious group. It is deducted at the [[PAYE]] level. The duty to pay this tax theoretically starts on the day one is christened. Anyone who wants to stop paying it has to declare in writing, at their local court of law (Amtsgericht) or registry office, that they are leaving the Church. They are then crossed off the Church registers and can no longer receive the sacraments, confession and certain services; a Roman Catholic church may deny such a person a burial plot.&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/faith/article3544885.ece |newspaper=The Times |title=Excommunication for German Catholics who refuse church tax |date=September 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the government, the taxpayer also must notify his employer of his religious affiliation (or lack thereof) in order to ensure proper tax withholding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19699581 |title=BBC News ''German Catholics lose church rights for unpaid tax'' 2012-09-24 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This opt-out is also used by members of "free churches" (e.g. Baptists) (non-affiliated to the scheme) to stop paying the church tax, from which the free churches do not benefit, in order to support their own church directly.

====Italy====
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
Originally the Italian government of [[Benito Mussolini]], under the [[Lateran treaties]] of 1929 with the [[Holy See]], paid a monthly [[salary]] to [[Catholic]] clergymen. This salary was called the ''congrua''. The eight per thousand law was created as a result of an agreement, in 1984, between the Italian Republic and the [[Holy See]].

Under this law Italian taxpayers are able to vote how to partition the 0.8% ('eight per thousand') of the total income [[tax]] [[IRPEF]] levied by Italy among some specific [[religious]] [[Confession (religion)|confessions]] or, alternatively, to a [[Welfare (financial aid)|social assistance]] program run by the Italian State. This declaration is made on the [[IRPEF]] form. This vote is not compulsory; the whole amount levied by the [[IRPEF]] [[tax]] is distributed in proportion to explicit declarations.

The last official statement of Italian Ministry of Finance made in respect of the year 2000 singles out seven beneficiaries: the Italian State, the [[Roman Catholic Church in Italy|Catholic Church]], the [[Waldenses]], the [[Italian Jews|Jewish Communities]], the [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] and the [[Assemblies of God in Italy]].

The tax was divided up as follows:
*87.17% Catholic Church
*10.35% Italian State
*1.21% Waldenses
*0.46% Jewish Communities
*0.32% Lutherans
*0.28% Adventists of the Seventh Day
*0.21% Assemblies of God in Italy

In 2000, the [[Catholic Church]] raised almost a billion [[euro]]s, while the Italian State received about €100 million euros.

====Scotland====
{{main|Teind}}
In Scotland ''teinds'' were the tenths of certain produce of the land appropriated to the maintenance of the Church and clergy. At the Reformation most of the Church property was acquired by the Crown, nobles and landowners. In 1567 the [[Privy Council of Scotland]] provided that a third of the revenues of lands should be applied to paying the clergy of the reformed [[Church of Scotland]]. In 1925 the system was recast by statute&lt;ref&gt;Church of Scotland (Property and Endowments) Act 1925, Part I.&lt;/ref&gt; and provision was made for the standardisation of stipends at a fixed value in money. The [[Court of Session]] acted as the Teind Court. Teinds were finally abolished by section 56 of the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]].

====Sweden====
Until the year 2000, Sweden had a mandatory [[church tax]], to be paid if one did belong to the [[Church of Sweden]], which had been funneling about $500 million annually to the church. Because of change in legislation, the tax was withdrawn in the year 2000. However, the Swedish government has agreed to continue collecting from individual taxpayers the annual payment that has always gone to the church. But now the tax will be an optional checkoff box on the tax return. The government will allocate the money collected to Catholic, Muslim, Jewish and other faiths as well as the Lutherans, with each taxpayer directing where his or her taxes should go.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

====Switzerland====
There is no official state church in [[Switzerland]]; however, all the 26 cantons (states) financially support at least one of the three traditional denominations — [[Roman Catholic]], [[Old Catholic]], or [[Protestant]] — with funds collected through taxation. Each canton has its own regulations regarding the relationship between church and state. In some cantons, the church tax (up to 2.3 per cent) is voluntary but in others an individual who chooses not to contribute to church tax may formally have to leave the church. In some cantons private companies are unable to avoid payment of the church tax.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Tithes and tithe law in England before reform===
Excerpts from [[Sir William Blackstone]], ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'':

====Definition and classification and those liable to pay tithes====
&lt;blockquote&gt;. . . tithes; which are defined to be the tenth part of the increase, yearly arising and renewing from the profits of lands, the stock upon lands, and the personal industry of the inhabitants:
:the first species being usually called ''predial,''&lt;ref&gt;from praedium, a farm&lt;/ref&gt; as of corn, grass, hops, and wood;
:the second ''mixed'', as of wool, milk, pigs, &amp;c, consisting of natural products, but nurtured and preserved in part by the care of man; and of these the tenth must be paid in gross:
:the third ''personal'', as of manual occupations, trades, fisheries, and the like ; and of these only the tenth part of the clear gains and profits is due.
...
in general, tithes are to be paid for every thing that yields an annual increase, as corn, hay, fruit, cattle, poultry, and the like; but not for any thing that is of the substance of the earth, or is not of annual increase, as stone, lime, chalk, and the like; nor for creatures that are of a wild nature, or ''ferae naturae'', as deer, hawks, &amp;c, whose increase, so as to profit the owner, is not annual, but casual.&lt;ref name = 'BlackstoneII'&gt;{{cite book |last=Blackstone |first=William |title=[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]] vol II |date=1766 |place=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====History====
&lt;blockquote&gt;We cannot precisely ascertain the time when tithes were first introduced into this country.  Possibly they were contemporary with the planting of Christianity among the Saxons, by Augustin the monk, about the end of the fifth century.  But the first mention of them, which I have met with in any written English law, is in a constitutional decree, made in a synod held A.D. 786, wherein the payment of tithes in general is strongly enjoined. This canon, or decree, which at first bound not the laity, was effectually confirmed by two kingdoms of the heptarchy, in their parliamentary conventions of estates, respectively consisting of the kings of Mercia and Northumberland, the bishops, dukes, senators, and people. Which was a few years later than the time that Charlemagne established the payment of them in France, and made that famous division of them into four parts ; one to maintain the edifice of the church, the second to support the poor, the third the bishop, and the fourth the parochial clergy.&lt;ref name = "BlackstoneII" /&gt;{{rp|25}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Beneficiaries====
&lt;blockquote&gt;And upon their first introduction (as hath formerly been observed), though every man was obliged to pay tithes in general, yet he might give them to what priests he pleased; which were called ''arbitrary'' consecrations of tithes: or he might pay them into the hands of the bishop, who distributed among his diocesan clergy the revenues of the church, which were then in common. But, when dioceses were divided into parishes, the tithes of each parish were allotted to its own particular minister; first by common consent, or the appointment of lords of manors, and afterwards by the written law of the land.&lt;ref name = "BlackstoneII" /&gt;{{rp|26}}

...It is now universally held, that tithes are due, of common right, to the [[parson]] of the [[parish]], unless there be a special exemption. This parson of the parish, we have formerly seen, may be either the actual [[Incumbent (ecclesiastical)|incumbent]], or else the [[wikt:appropriator|appropriator]] of the [[Benefice#Church of England|benefice]]: appropriations being a method of endowing monasteries, which seems to have been devised by the regular clergy, by way of substitution to arbitrary consecrations of tithes.&lt;ref name = "BlackstoneII" /&gt;{{rp|28}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Exemptions====
&lt;blockquote&gt;We observed that tithes are due to the parson of common right, unless by special exemption: let us therefore see, thirdly, who may be exempted from the payment of tithes ... either in part or totally, first, by a real composition; or secondly, by custom or prescription.

First, a real composition is when an agreement is made between the owner of the lands, and the parson or vicar, with the consent of the ordinary and the patron, that such lands shall for the future be discharged from payment of tithes, by reason of some land or other real recompence given to the parson, in lieu and satisfaction thereof.

Secondly, a discharge by custom or prescription, is where time out of mind such persons or such lands have been, either partially or totally, discharged from the payment of tithes. And this immemorial usage is binding upon all parties, as it is in its nature an evidence of universal consent and acquiescence; and with reason supposes a real composition to have been formerly made. This custom or prescription is either ''de modo decimandi'', or ''de non decimando''.

A ''modus decimandi'', commonly called by the simple name of a ''modus'' only, is where there is by custom a particular manner of tithing allowed, different from the general law of taking tithes in kind, which are the actual tenth part of the annual increase. This is sometimes a pecuniary compensation, as twopence an acre for the tithe of land : sometimes it is a compensation in work and labour, as that the parson shall have only the twelfth cock of hay, and not the tenth, in consideration of the owner's making it for him: sometimes, in lieu of a large quantity of crude or imperfect tithe, the parson shall have a less quantity, when arrived to greater maturity, as a couple of fowls in lieu of tithe eggs ; and the like. Any means, in short, whereby the general law of tithing is altered, and a new method of taking them is introduced, is called a ''modus decimandi'', or special manner of tithing.&lt;ref name = "BlackstoneII" /&gt;{{rp|28–29}}

A prescription ''de non decimando'' is a claim to be entirely discharged of tithes, and to pay no compensation in lieu of them.  Thus the king by his prerogative is discharged from all tithes. So a vicar shall pay no tithes to the rector, nor the rector to the vicar, for ''ecclesia decimas non folvit ecclesiae''. But these ''personal'' to both the king and the clergy ; for their tenant or lessee shall pay tithes of the same land, though in their own occupation it is not tithable.  And, generally speaking, it is an established rule, that in ''lay'' hands, ''modus de non decimando non valet''. But spiritual persons or corporations, as monasteries, abbots, bishops, and the like, were always capable of having their lands totally discharged of tithes, by various ways: as
#By real composition :
#By the pope's [[Papal bull|bull]] of exemption :
#By unity of possession ; as when the rectory of a parish, and lands in the same parish, both belonged to a religious house, those lands were discharged of tithes by this unity of possession :
#By prescription ; having never been liable to tithes, by being always in spiritual hands :
#By virtue of their order; as the [[Knights Templars|knights templars]], [[cistercians]], and others, whose lands were privileged by the pope with a discharge of tithes. Though, upon the dissolution of abbeys by [[Henry VIII]], most of these exemptions from tithes would have fallen with them, and the lands become tithable again; had they not been supported and upheld by the statute 31 Hen. VIII. c. 13. which enacts, that all persons who should come to the possession of the lands of any abbey then dissolved, should hold them free and discharged of tithes, in as large and ample a manner as the abbeys themselves formerly held them. And from this original have sprung all the lands, which, being in lay hands, do at present claim to be tithe-free: for, if a man can shew his lands to have been such abbey lands, and also immemorially discharged of tithes by any of the means before-mentioned, this is now a good prescription ''de non decimando''. But he must shew both these requisites ; for abbey lands, without a special ground of discharge, are not discharged of course ; neither will any prescription ''de non decimando'' avail in total discharge of tithes, unless it relates to such abbeylands.&lt;ref name = "BlackstoneII" /&gt;{{rp|31–32}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Islam==
{{main article|Zakāt}}
[[Zakāt]] ({{lang-ar|زكاة}} {{IPA-ar|zækæːh|}}) or "alms giving", one of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], is the giving of a small percentage of one's assets to [[charity (practice)|charity]]. It serves principally as the [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] contribution to poor and deprived Muslims, although others may have a rightful share. It is the duty of an Islamic state not just to collect zakat but to distribute it fairly as well.

Zakat is payable on three kinds of assets: wealth, production, and animals. The more well-known zakat on wealth is 2.5 per cent of accumulated wealth, beyond one's personal needs. Production (agricultural, industrial, renting, etc.), is subject to a 10 per cent or 5 per cent zakat (also known as Ushur (عُشر), or "one-tenth"), using the rule that if both labor and capital are involved, 5% rate is applied, if only one of the two are used for production, then the rate is 10 per cent. For any earnings, that require neither labor nor capital, like finding underground treasure, the rate is 20 per cent. The rules for zakat on animal holdings are specified by the type of animal group and tend to be fairly detailed.&lt;ref name=ghamidi&gt;The book ''Meezan'', by Javed Ahmed Ghamidi, published by Al-Mawrid, 2002, Lahore, Pakistan&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims fulfill this religious obligation by giving a fixed percentage of their surplus wealth. Zakat has been paired with such a high sense of righteousness that it is often placed on the same level of importance as performing the five-daily repetitive ritualised prayer ([[salat]]).&lt;ref name=zysow&gt;{{citation |last= Zysow |first= A. Zakāt |title= Encyclopaedia of Islam |edition= Second |editor1= P. Bearman |editor2= Th. Bianquis |editor3= C.E. Bosworth |editor4= E. van Donzel |editor5= W.P. Heinrichs |publisher= Brill |year= 2009}}.{{page needed|date=October 2014}} Available from [http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_COM-1377 Brill Online] (subscription).&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims see this process also as a way of purifying themselves from their greed and selfishness and also safeguarding future business.&lt;ref name=zysow/&gt; In addition, Zakat purifies the person who receives it because it saves him from the humiliation of begging and prevents him from envying the rich.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Neal. Islam; A Concise Introduction. Richmond; Curzon Press. 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Because it holds such a high level of importance the "punishment" for not paying when able is very severe. In the 2nd edition of the ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'' it states, "...the prayers of those who do not pay zakat will not be accepted".&lt;ref name=zysow/&gt; This is because without Zakat a tremendous hardship is placed on the poor which otherwise would not be there. Besides the fear of their prayers not getting heard, those who are able should be practicing this third pillar of Islam because the Quran states that this is what believers should do.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 2 verse 155, "be sure we shall test you with something of fear and hunger, some loss on goods, lives, and fruits. But give glad tidings to those who patiently persevere."&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-Muslims (able-bodied adult males of military age) living in an Islamic state are required to pay [[Jizya]], this exempts them from military service and they do not pay Zakat.

In [[logic]] and [[mathematics]], a '''truth value''', sometimes called a '''logical value''', is a value indicating the relation of a [[proposition]] to [[truth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2018/entriesruth-values/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Shramko|first=Yaroslav|last2=Wansing|first2=Heinrich|date=2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 |}
In [[classical logic]], with its intended semantics, the truth values are ''[[logical truth|true]]''&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;T), and ''[[false (logic)|untrue]]'' or ''[[false (logic)|false]]''&amp;nbsp;(0&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;⊥); that is, classical logic is a [[two-valued logic]]. This set of two values is also called the [[Boolean domain]]. Corresponding semantics of [[logical connective]]s are [[truth function]]s, whose values are expressed in the form of [[truth table]]s. [[Logical biconditional]] becomes the [[equality (mathematics)|equality]] binary relation, and [[negation]] becomes a [[bijection]] which [[permutation|permutes]] true and false. Conjunction and disjunction are [[Dual (mathematics)#Duality in logic and set theory|dual]] with respect to negation, which is expressed by [[De Morgan's laws]]:
: ¬({{math|{{mvar|p}}∧{{mvar|q}}) ⇔ ¬{{mvar|p}} ∨ ¬{{mvar|q}}}}
: ¬({{math|{{mvar|p}}∨{{mvar|q}}) ⇔ ¬{{mvar|p}} ∧ ¬{{mvar|q}}}}

[[Propositional variable]]s become [[Variable (computer science)|variables]] in the Boolean domain. Assigning values for propositional variables is referred to as [[valuation (logic)|valuation]].
&lt;!-- Also something should be written about first-order logics --&gt;

== Intuitionistic and constructive logic ==
{{main|Constructivism (mathematics)}}
In [[intuitionistic logic]], and more generally, [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructive mathematics]], statements are assigned a truth value only if they can be given a constructive proof. It starts with a set of axioms, and a statement is true if one can build a proof of the statement from those axioms. A statement is false if one can deduce a contradiction from it. This leaves open the possibility of statements that have not yet been assigned a truth value.
Unproven statements in intuitionistic logic are not given an intermediate truth value (as is sometimes mistakenly asserted). Indeed, one can prove that they have no third truth value, a result dating back to Glivenko in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intuitionistic-logic-development/#4.3 Proof that intuitionistic logic has no third truth value, Glivenko 1928]&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, statements simply remain of unknown truth value, until they are either proven or disproven.

There are various ways of interpreting intuitionistic logic, including the [[Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation]]. See also [[Intuitionistic logic#Semantics]].

== Multi-valued logic ==
[[Multi-valued logic]]s (such as [[fuzzy logic]] and [[relevance logic]]) allow for more than two truth values, possibly containing some internal structure. For example, on the [[unit interval]] {{closed-closed|0,1}} such structure is a [[total order]]; this may be expressed as the existence of various [[degrees of truth]].

== Algebraic semantics ==
{{main|Algebraic logic}}
Not all [[logical system]]s are truth-valuational in the sense that logical connectives may be interpreted as truth functions. For example, [[intuitionistic logic]] lacks a complete set of truth values because its semantics, the [[Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation]], is specified in terms of [[proof theory|provability]] conditions, and not directly in terms of the [[necessarily true|necessary truth]] of formulae.

But even non-truth-valuational logics can associate values with logical formulae, as is done in [[algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|algebraic semantics]]&lt;!-- if this becomes a dab page linking to [[Algebraic logic]], just remove the link --&gt;. The algebraic semantics of intuitionistic logic is given in terms of [[Heyting algebra]]s, compared to [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] semantics of classical propositional calculus.
&lt;!-- This also has an analogy to vector spaces instead of scalars. But is it encyclopedic enough? --&gt;

== In other theories ==
[[Intuitionistic type theory]] uses [[Type theory|types]] in the place of truth values.

[[Topos]] theory uses truth values in a special sense: the truth values of a topos are the [[global element]]s of the [[subobject classifier]].  Having truth values in this sense does not make a logic truth valuational.

'''Verisimilitude''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|v|ɛr|ɪ|s|ɪ|ˈ|m|ɪ|l|ɪ|tj|uː|d}} is the "lifelikeness" or believability of a [[fiction|work of fiction]]. The word comes from {{lang-la|verum}} meaning truth and ''similis'' meaning similar.&lt;ref&gt; Oxford English Dictionary Online, Second Edition 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Language philosopher [[Stephen Neale|Steve Neale]] distinguishes between two types: '''cultural verisimilitude''', meaning plausibility of the fictional work within the cultural and/or historical context of the real world, outside of the work; and '''generic verisimilitude''', meaning plausibility of a fictional work within the bounds of its own [[list of fictional genres|genre]] (so that, for example, characters regularly singing about their feelings is a believable action within the [[fictional universe]] of a [[musical theatre|musical]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hall |first=Stuart |title=Representation: Cultural Representations and Signifying Practices |location=London |publisher=Sage in association with the Open University |year=1997 |page=360 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dAqycFD4PBsC |via=[[Google Books]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original roots==

Verisimilitude has its roots in both the Platonic and Aristotelian dramatic theory of [[mimesis]], the imitation or representation of nature. For a piece of art to hold significance or persuasion for an audience, according to [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], it must have grounding in reality.

This idea laid the foundation for the evolution of mimesis into verisimilitude in the [[Middle Ages]] particularly in Italian [[heroic poetry]]. During this time more attention was invested in pinning down fiction with theory. This shift manifested itself in increased focus on unity in heroic poetry. No matter how fictionalized the language of a poem might be, through verisimilitude, poets had the ability to present their works in a way that could still be believed in the real world. Verisimilitude at this time also became connected to another Aristotelian dramatic principle, [[decorum]]: the realistic union of style and subject. Poetic language of characters in a work of fiction as a result had to be appropriate in terms of the age, gender or race of the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gordon |last=Teskey |chapter=Renaissance Theory and Criticism |title=The Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism |edition=Second |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This classical notion of verisimilitude focused on the role of the reader in his/her engagement in the fictional work of art. The goal of the novel therefore, as it became a more popular form of verisimilitude, was to instruct and offer a pleasurable experience to the reader. The novel had to facilitate the reader's willingness [[Suspension of disbelief|to suspend his/her disbelief]], a phrase used originally by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert P. |last=Ashley |title=What Makes a Good Novel |journal=The English Journal |volume=60 |issue=5 |year=1971 |pages=596–598 |jstor=813069 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Verisimilitude became the means to accomplish this mindset. To promote the willing suspension of disbelief, a fictional text needed to have credibility. Anything physically possible in the worldview of the reader or humanity's experience was defined as credible. Through verisimilitude then, the reader was able to glean truth even in fiction because it would reflect realistic aspects of human life.

==Continued evolution==

The idea that credibility, and in turn verisimilitude, rested on the reader's sense of the world encountered opposition because of the dilemma it created: every reader and every person does not have the same knowledge of the world. This kind of theory suggests that the novel consisted of distinct parts. The way novelists avoided this dilemma initially was by adding a preface to the work of fiction stating its credibility or by including more references to known history within the text of the fiction. 

As more criticism on the novel surfaced, the inclusion of a preface or a scattering of some historical references was not enough to engage the reader. French theorist [[Pierre Nicolas Desmolets]]' notion that the author should obscure the fiction or art of the novel to avoid destroying illusion: the made up attributes of the text. The novel before was perceived as a work of distinct parts. Now the novel was not thought of in terms of separate parts, but rather as a work as a whole. The novel was a total illusion of life within itself. It was a closed fictional world that could establish its own rules and laws. Verisimilitude then became deeply rooted in structure. The focus of credibility did not rest solely on the external world of the reader; the novel's credibility then could be seen in terms of the novel's own [[internal logic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=F. E. |last=Sparshott |title=Truth in Fiction |journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism |volume=26 |issue=1 |year=1967 |pages=3–7 |jstor=429239 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The focus of verisimilitude was no longer concerned with the reader. The focus shifted to the novel itself. Verisimilitude was a technical problem to resolve within the context of the novel's fictional world. Detail centered on the creation of a logical cause web in the text that then could reinforce the overarching structural logic of the plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ewlyn F. |last=Sterling |title=The Theory of Verisimilitude in the French Novel prior to 1830 |journal=The French Review |volume=40 |issue=5 |year=1967 |pages=613–619 |jstor=384665 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postmodern perspective==

During the rise of the [[Postmodern literature|postmodern]] novel, some critics suggested that truth or significance lies beyond verisimilitude and that only by complete non-discursive freedom to encounter a novel could meaning truly be discovered. Verisimilitude, they argued, was not the first aspect of the text a reader experiences. The reader instead first tries to observe if the novel works as an intelligible narrative. The lens of verisimilitude is applied only after the reader establishes if the novel makes sense or not.

The reader can understand the novel as art but not necessarily as a cultural construction. The novel should challenge the construction of reality. In this sense, it was possible for art to precede reality. Reality had to catch up to the text rather than text staying present to reality. A boundary existed establishing that text does not belong to a current time or situation. In the postmodern context, verisimilitude was less of a concern for the novelist according to some critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mas'Ud |last=Zavarzadeh |title=The Semiotics of the Foreseen: Modes of Narrative in (Contemporary) Fiction |journal=Poetics Today |volume=6 |issue=4 |year=1985 |pages=432–433 |jstor=1771956 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Techniques can include reforestation, [[pest control]], [[nitrification]] and [[denitrification]], [[irrigation]], [[coppicing]] and [[hedge laying]].

Game keeping is the management or control of wildlife for the well being of game and may include killing other animals which share the same [[Ecological niche|niche]] or predators to maintain a high population of the more profitable species, such as pheasants introduced into woodland. In his 1933 book ''Game Management'', [[Aldo Leopold]], one of the pioneers of wildlife management as a science, defined it as "the art of making land produce sustained annual crops of wild game for recreational use".

Pest control is the control of real or perceived pests and can be used for the benefit of wildlife, farmers, game keepers or safety reasons. In the United States, wildlife management practices are often implemented by a governmental agency to uphold a law, such as the Endangered Species Act.

In the United Kingdom, wildlife management undertaken by several organizations including government bodies such as the [[Forestry Commission]], Charities such as the [[RSPB]] and [[The Wildlife Trusts]] and privately hired [[gamekeeper]]s and contractors. Legislation has also been passed to protect wildlife such as the [[Wildlife and Countryside Act]] 1981. The UK government also give [[Subsidy farming|farmers subsidies]] through the [[Countryside Stewardship Scheme]] to improve the conservation value of their farms.

==History==

===Game laws===
{{Main article|Game law}}

The history of wildlife management begins with the game laws, which regulated the right to kill certain kinds of [[fish]] and [[wild animal]] ([[game (food)|game]]). In Britain game laws developed out of the [[forest laws]], which in the time of the Norman kings were very oppressive.  Under [[William the Conqueror]], it was as great a crime to kill one of the king's deer as to kill one of his subjects. A certain rank and standing, or the possession of a certain amount of property, were for a long time qualifications indispensably necessary to confer upon any one the right of pursuing and killing game.

The [[Game Act 1831|Game Act of 1831]] protected [[game birds]] by establishing close seasons when they could not be legally taken. The act made it lawful to take game only with the provision of a game licence and provided for the appointment of [[gamekeeper]]s around the country. The purposes of the law was to balance the needs for preservation and harvest and to manage both [[Natural environment|environment]] and [[Population biology|populations]] of fish and game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildlife.state.co.us/NR/rdonlyres/4557FC8F-2737-452F-8F56-C3C4759244BE/0/WILDLIFE_CONSERVATION_MANAGEMENT.pdf|title=Wildlife Conservation Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Phasianus colchicus 2 tom (Lukasz Lukasik).jpg|right|thumb|The Game Act 1831 protects game birds in England and Wales]]

Early game laws were also enacted in the US; - in 1839 [[Rhode Island]] closed the hunting season for white-tailed deer from May to November.&lt;ref name="Bolen, Eric G. 1999"&gt;Bolen, Eric G., Robinson, William. (1999). Wildlife Ecology and Management. Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other regulations during this time focused primarily on restricting hunting.  At this time, lawmakers did not consider population sizes or the need for preservation or restoration of wildlife habitats.&lt;ref name="Bolen, Eric G. 1999"/&gt;

===Emergence of wildlife conservation===
{{Main article|Wildlife conservation}}

The late 19th century saw the passage of the first pieces of wildlife conservation legislation and the establishment of the first nature conservation societies. The [[Sea Birds Preservation Act 1869|Sea Birds Preservation Act of 1869]] was passed in Britain as the first nature protection law in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=3540740023|title=Coastal Dunes: Ecology and Conservation|author=G. Baeyens, M. L. Martinez|year=2007|page=282|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; after extensive lobbying from the Association for the Protection of Seabirds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/humberside/hi/people_and_places/nature/newsid_9383000/9383787.stm|title=Protecting seabirds at Bempton Cliffs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] was founded as the Plumage League in 1889 by [[Emily Williamson]] at her house in [[Manchester]]&lt;ref name="milestones"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/about/history/milestones.asp |title=Milestones  |publisher=''RSPB'' |accessdate=19 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[advocacy group|protest group]] campaigning against the use of [[great crested grebe]] and [[Black-legged Kittiwake|kittiwake]] skins and feathers in [[fur clothing]]. The group gained popularity and eventually amalgamated with the Fur and Feather League in Croydon to form the RSPB.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/about/history/index.asp |title=History of the RSPB |publisher=''RSPB'' |accessdate=19 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society attracted growing support from the suburban middle-classes as well as support from many other influential figures, such as the [[ornithologist]] Professor [[Alfred Newton]].&lt;ref name="milestones"/&gt;

The [[National Trust]] formed in 1895 with the manifesto to "...promote the permanent preservation, for the benefit of the nation, of lands, ...to preserve (so far practicable) their natural aspect." On 1 May 1899, the Trust purchased two acres of [[Wicken Fen]] with a donation from the amateur naturalist [[Charles Rothschild]], establishing the first nature reserve in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wicken.org.uk/|title=Wicken Fen National Nature Reserve|publisher=Wicken Fen}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rothschild was a pioneer of wildlife conservation in Britain, and went on to establish many other nature reserves, such as one at [[Woodwalton Fen]], near [[Huntingdon]], in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildlifebcnp.org/whats-new-story360.htm Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Northamptonshire and Peterborough]&lt;/ref&gt; During his lifetime he built and managed his estate at [[Ashton Wold]]&lt;ref name = "Pevsner"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Pevsner, Nikolaus| authorlink= | title=The Buildings of England – Northamptonshire| year=1961 | publisher=Yale University Press | location=London and New Haven | isbn=978-0-300-09632-3 | pages=94–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Northamptonshire]] to maximise its suitability for wildlife, especially butterflies. Concerned about the loss of wildlife habitats, in 1912 he set up the Society for the Promotion of Nature Reserves, the forerunner of [[The Wildlife Trusts partnership]].

During the society's early years, membership tended to be made up of specialist [[natural history|naturalists]] and its growth was comparatively slow. The first independent Trust was formed in Norfolk in 1926 as the Norfolk Naturalists Trust, followed in 1938 by the Pembrokeshire Bird Protection Society which after several subsequent changes of name is now the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales and it was not until the 1940s and 1950s that more Naturalists' Trusts were formed in [[Yorkshire]], [[Lincolnshire]], [[Leicestershire]] and [[Cambridgeshire]]. These early Trusts tended to focus on purchasing land to establish [[nature reserve]]s in the geographical areas they served.

===Wildlife management in the US===
The profession of wildlife management was established in the United States in the 1920s and '30s by [[Aldo Leopold]] and others who sought to transcend the purely restrictive policies of the previous generation of conservationists, such as anti-hunting activist [[William T. Hornaday]]. Leopold and his close associate Herbert Stoddard, who had both been trained in scientific forestry, argued that modern science and technology could be used to restore and improve wildlife habitat and thus produce abundant "crops" of ducks, deer, and other valued wild animals.

The institutional foundations of the profession of wildlife management were established in the 1930s, when Leopold was granted the first university professorship in wildlife management (1933, [[University of Wisconsin, Madison]]), when Leopold's textbook 'Game Management' was published (1933), when [[The Wildlife Society]] was founded, when the Journal of Wildlife Management began publishing, and when the first Cooperative Wildlife Research Units were established. Conservationists planned many projects throughout the 1940s. Some of which included the harvesting of female mammals such as deer to decrease rising populations. Others included waterfowl and wetland research. The Fish and Wildlife Management Act was put in place to urge farmers to plant food for wildlife and to provide cover for them.

In 1937, the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act (also known as the Pittman-Robertson Act) was passed in the U.S..  This law was an important advancement in the field of wildlife management.  It placed a 10% tax on sales of guns and ammunition.  The funds generated were then distributed to the states for use in wildlife management activities and research.  This law is still in effect today.

Wildlife management grew after World War II with the help of the GI Bill and a postwar boom in recreational hunting. An important step in wildlife management in the United States national parks occurred after several years of public controversy regarding the forced reduction of the elk population in [[Yellowstone National Park]]. In 1963, [[United States Secretary of the Interior]] [[Stewart Udall]] appointed an advisory board to collect scientific data to inform future wildlife management. In a paper known as the [[Leopold Report]], the committee observed that culling programs at other national parks had been ineffective, and recommended active management of Yellowstone's elk population.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, A. Starker, ''et al''. 1963. "[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/leopold/leopold4.htm The Goal of Park Management in the United States]". ''Wildlife Management in the National Parks''. [[National Park Service]]. Retrieved on September 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elk]] overpopulation in [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]] is thought by many wildlife biologists, such as Douglas Smith, to have been primarily caused by the [[Local extinction|extirpation]] of wolves from the park and surrounding environs. After wolves were removed, elk herds increased in population, reaching new highs during the mid-1930s. The increased number of elk apparently resulted in overgrazing in parts of Yellowstone. Park officials decided that the elk herd should be managed. For approximately thirty years, the park elk herds were culled: Each year some were captured and shipped to other locations, a certain number were killed by park rangers, and hunters were allowed to take more elk that migrated outside the park. By the late 1960s the herd populations dropped to historic lows (less than 4,000 for the Northern Range herd). This caused outrage among both conservationists and hunters. The park service stopped culling elk in 1968. The elk population then rebounded. Twenty years later there were 19,000 elk in the Northern Range herd, a historic high.

Since the tumultuous 1970s, when [[animal rights]] activists and [[environmentalist]]s began to challenge some aspects of wildlife management, the profession has been overshadowed by the rise of [[conservation biology]]. Although wildlife managers remain central to the implementation of the Endangered Species Act and other wildlife conservation policies, conservation biologists have shifted the focus of conservation away from wildlife management's concern with the protection and restoration of single species and toward the maintenance of ecosystems and [[biodiversity]].

==Types of wildlife management==
There are two general types of wildlife management: 

* '''Manipulative management''' acts on a population, either changing its numbers by direct means or influencing numbers by the indirect means of altering food supply, habitat, density of predators, or prevalence of disease. This is appropriate when a population is to be harvested, or when it slides to an unacceptably low density or increases to an unacceptably high level. Such densities are inevitably the subjective view of the land owner, and may be disputed by [[animal welfare]] interests.
* '''Custodial management''' is preventive or protective. The aim is to minimize external influences on the population and its habitat. It is appropriate in a national park where one of the stated goals is to protect ecological processes. It is also appropriate for conservation of a threatened species where the threat is of external origin rather than being intrinsic to the system. [[Do not feed the animals|Feeding of animals by visitors]] is generally discouraged.

==Opposition==
The control of wildlife through killing and hunting has been criticized by [[animal rights]] and [[animal welfare]] activists.&lt;ref name=LACS1&gt;[http://www.league.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=1594&amp;ArticleID=1660 League Against Cruel Sports - Consequences of the Shoot]&lt;/ref&gt; Critics object to the real or perceived [[Cruelty to animals|cruelty]] involved in some forms of wildlife management.-
[[Environmentalism|Environmentalists]] have also opposed hunting where they believe it is unnecessary or will negatively affect biodiversity.&lt;ref name=RSPB1&gt;[http://www.rspb.org.uk/supporting/campaigns/birdsofprey/threatened.asp RSPB - Which birds are threatened]&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of game keeping note that habitat manipulation and predator control are often used to maintain artificially inflated populations of valuable game animals (including introduced exotics) without regard to the ecological integrity of the habitat.

Game keepers in the UK claim it to be necessary for wildlife conservation as the amount of countryside they look after exceeds by a factor of nine the amount in nature reserves and national parks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamekeeperstrust.org.uk/ National Gamekeepers' Organisation Charitable Trust]&lt;/ref&gt;'''

==Management of hunting seasons==
Wildlife management studies, research and lobbying by interest groups help designate times of the year when certain wildlife species can be legally hunted, allowing for surplus animals to be removed. In the United States, hunting season and bag limits are determined by guidelines set by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] for migratory game such as waterfowl and other migratory gamebirds. The hunting season and bag limits for state regulated game species such as deer are usually determined by State game Commissions, which are made up of representatives from various interest groups, wildlife biologists, and researchers.

Open and closed season on deer in the UK is legislated for in the [[Deer Act 1991]] and the [[Deer Act (Scotland) 1996]]

===Open season===
[[Hunting season|Open season]] is when wildlife is allowed to be hunted by law and is usually not during the [[breeding season]].  Hunters may be restricted by sex, age or class of animal, for instance there may be an open season for any male deer with 4 points or better on at least one side.

===Limited entry===
Where the number of animals taken is to be tightly controlled, managers may have a type of lottery system called limited.  Many apply, few are chosen.  These hunts may still have age, sex or class restrictions.

===Closed season===
Closed season is when wildlife is protected from hunting and is usually during its breeding season. Closed season is enforced by law, any hunting during closed season is punishable by law and termed as illegal hunting or [[poaching]].

===Type of weapon used===
In wildlife management one of the conservation principles is that the weapon used for hunting should be the one that causes the least damage to the animal and is sufficiently effective so that it hits the target. Given State and Local laws, types of weapon can also vary depending on type, size, sex of game and also the geographical layout of that specific hunting area.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2265">'''Áine Ní Cheanainn''', [[headmistress]] and co-founder of [[Cumann Scannán na nÓg]], 1907–1999.

Ní Cheanainn was born in Derryvea, [[Kiltimagh]], [[County Mayo]], daughter of a shopkeeper. She was taught locally before attending Carysfort Training College from 1925 to 1927, graduating with a qualification for primary level. She later studied at [[University College Dublin|UCD]], where she obtained an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in education.

She taught at [[Scoil Mhuire]] in [[Howth]] from 1927, and became principal of Scoil Eoin Baiste girls' school in [[Clontarf, Dublin|Clontarf]] in 1941. By the 1950s, Scoil Eoin was one of the most prestigious in Dublin. The following decade she introduced audio-visual equipment, years before their official introduction as part of the curriculum in 1974.

Ní Cheanainn was actively involved in many areas of education, such as the Eigse Raifteri summer school, the Comoradh Mhic Eil, the Irish branch of [[UNESCO]], the Irish-German society, and Corfheile na Scoileanna.

She was a co-founder of [[Cumann Scannán na nÓg]], which was merged with the [[Irish Film Institute]] to form the [[Irish Film Centre]]. She was the only woman appointed to the [[Radio Éireann]] authority, serving from 1960 to 1965, but was disappointed not to be asked to serve a second term. It was at her insistence that the authority's name was changed to [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]] in 1966.

She published a biography of [[John MacHale]] in 1983.

Áine Ní Cheanainn remained unmarried. She spent the last years of her life at Grove Nursing Home, [[Killiney]], [[County Dublin]]. She died in June 1999 and was buried in Kiltimagh, survived by one sister.
