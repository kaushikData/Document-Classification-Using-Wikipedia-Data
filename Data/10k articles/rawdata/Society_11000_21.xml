The '''Abazin''', '''Abazinians''', or '''Abaza''' ([[Abaza language|Abaza]] and [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]]: Абаза; [[Circassian language|Circassian]]: Абазэхэр; {{lang-ru|Абазины}}; {{lang-tr|Abazalar}}; {{lang-ar|أباظة}}) are an ethnic group of the [[Caucasus|Northwest Caucasus]], closely related to the [[Abkhaz people|Abkhaz]] and [[Circassians|Circassian]] people. They live mostly in [[Turkey]], [[Egypt]], and in [[Karachay-Cherkessia]] and [[Stavropol Krai]] in the [[North Caucasus]] region of [[Russia]].

The Abazin originally inhabited the [[Sadzen]] region in the western part of [[Abkhazia]] and migrated from Abkhazia to [[Abazinia]] in 14th and 15th centuries. They later migrated to various regions of the former [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 18th and 19th centuries. Since the late 18th century, their dominant religion is [[Sunni Islam]] ([[Hanafism|Hanafi]]). 

Abaza people speak the [[Abaza language]], a [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian]] language closely related to [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]] and [[Circassian language|Circassian]]. There are two dialects of Abaza spoken in Karachay-Cherkessia: ''Ashkharua'' and ''Tapanta''. The culture and traditions of the Abazin are similar to those of the Circassians. On many old maps Abazin territory is marked as part of [[Circassia]] (Adygea). 

According to the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Russian census]], there were 43,341 Abazins in Russia. An Abazin diaspora exists in [[Turkey]]&lt;ref name=Ethnologue/&gt; [[Egypt]],&lt;ref name=Webster/&gt; and in Middle Eastern countries such as  [[Jordan]] and [[Syria]], most of which are descendants of [[muhajir (Caucasus)|muhajir]]s from the [[Caucasian War]] with the [[Imperial Russia|Russian Empire]].

There is a significant Abazin presence in Turkey. An estimated 150,000 Abaza live in the provinces of [[Eskişehir Province|Eskişehir]], [[Samsun Province|Samsun]], [[Yozgat Province|Yozgat]], [[Adana Province|Adana]], and [[Kayseri Province|Kayseri]]. Most of them belong to Ashkharua clan that fought against the Tsarist army and emigrated to Turkey after losing the battle of Kbaada ([[Krasnaya Polyana]] in today's [[Sochi]]), whereas the Tapanta clan fought with the Russian forces.

'''Arabic literature''' ({{lang-ar|الأدب العربي}} / [[ALA-LC]]: ''al-Adab al-‘Arabī'') is the writing, both [[prose]] and [[poetry]], produced by writers in the [[Arabic language]]. The Arabic word used for literature is ''"[[Adab (Islam)|Adab]]"'', which is derived from a meaning of [[etiquette]], and which implies politeness, culture and enrichment.

Arabic literature emerged in the 5th century with only fragments of the written language appearing before then. The [[Qur'an]], widely regarded by people as the finest piece of literature in the [[Arabic language]],&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; would have the greatest lasting effect on [[Arabic culture]] and its literature. Arabic literature flourished during the [[Islamic Golden Age]], but has remained vibrant to the present day, with poets and prose-writers across the Arab world, as well as rest of the world, achieving increasing success.

==The Qur'an==
===The exemplar of classical literature===
[[File:NaskhQ.JPG|thumb|right|The Qur'an is the most important and authentic example of Arabic literature and definitely the most influential.]]

The [[Qur'an]] had a significant influence on the Arab language. The language used in it is called [[classical Arabic]], and while modern Arabic is very similar, the classical has social prestige. Not only is the Qur'an the first work of any significant length written in the language it also has a far more complicated structure than the earlier literary works with its 114 [[sura]]s (chapters) which contain 6,236 [[ayat]] (verses). It contains [[injunction]]s, [[narrative]]s, [[homily|homilies]], [[parable]]s, direct addresses from God, instructions and even comments on itself on how it will be received and understood. It is also, paradoxically, admired for its layers of metaphor as well as its clarity, a feature it mentions itself in sura 16:103.

The word [[Qur'an]] means 'recite', and in early times the text was transmitted orally. The first attempt at an authentic written version was during the reign of the third 'Rightly Guided Caliph', [[Uthman]] (576-656).

Although it contains elements of both prose and poetry, and therefore is closest to ''[[Rhymed prose|Saj]]'' or [[rhymed prose]], the Qur'an is regarded as entirely apart from these classifications. The text is believed to be [[divine revelation]] and is seen by [[Muslims]] as being eternal or 'uncreated'. This leads to the doctrine of [[i'jaz]] or inimitability of the Qur'an which implies that nobody can copy the work's style.

{{quote|Say, Bring you then ten chapters like unto it, and call whomsoever you can, other than God, if you speak the truth!|sign=11:13}}

This doctrine of i'jaz possibly had a slight limiting effect on Arabic literature; proscribing exactly what could be written. Whilst Islam allows Muslims to write, read and recite poetry, the Qur'an states in the 26th sura ([[Ash-Shu'ara]] or The Poets) that poetry which is blasphemous, obscene, praiseworthy of sinful acts or attempts to challenge the Qu'ran's content and form is forbidden for Muslims.

{{quote|And as to the poets, those who go astray follow them
 Do you not see that they wander about bewildered in every valley?
 And that they say that which they do not do

 Except those who believe and do good works and remember Allah much and defend themselves after they are oppressed; and they who act unjustly shall know to what final place of turning they shall turn back. 
|sign=26:224-227|source=}}

This may have exerted dominance over the pre-Islamic poets of the 6th century whose popularity may have vied with the Qur'an amongst the people. There were a marked lack of significant poets until the 8th century. One notable exception was [[Hassan ibn Thabit]] who wrote poems in praise of [[Muhammad]] and was known as the "prophet's poet". Just as the [[Bible]] has held an important place in the literature of other languages, The Qur'an is important to Arabic. It is the source of many ideas, allusions and quotes and its moral message informs many works.

Aside from the Qur'an the ''[[hadith]]'' or tradition of what Muhammed is supposed to have said and done are important literature. The entire body of these acts and words are called ''[[sunnah]]'' or way and the ones regarded as ''sahih'' or genuine of them are collected into hadith. Some of the most significant collections of hadith include those by [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj]] and [[Muhammad ibn Isma'il al-Bukhari]].

The other important genre of work in Qur'anic study is the ''[[tafsir]]'' or [[Close reading|commentaries]] Arab writings relating to religion also includes many [[sermon]]s and devotional pieces as well as the sayings of [[Ali]] which were collected in the 10th century as ''[[Nahj al-Balaghah]]'' or ''The Peak of Eloquence''.

===Islamic scholarship===
The research into the life and times of Muhammad, and determining the genuine parts of the sunnah, was an important early reason for scholarship in or about the Arabic language. It was also the reason for the collecting of pre-Islamic poetry; as some of these poets were close to the prophet&amp;mdash;[[Labīd|Labid]] actually meeting Muhammad and converting to Islam&amp;mdash;and their writings illuminated the times when these events occurred. Muhammad also inspired the first Arabic [[biography|biographies]], known as ''al-sirah al-nabawiyyah''; the earliest was by [[Wahb ibn Munabbih]], but [[Muhammad ibn Ishaq]] wrote the best known. Whilst covering the life of the prophet they also told of the battles and events of early Islam and have numerous digressions on older biblical traditions.

Some of the earliest work studying the Arabic language was started in the name of Islam. Tradition has it that the caliph [[Ali]], after reading a copy of Qur'an with errors in it, asked [[Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali]] to write a work codifying [[Arabic grammar]]. [[Khalil ibn Ahmad]] would later write ''Kitab al-Ayn'', the first dictionary of Arabic, along with works on [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] and [[music]], and his pupil [[Sibawayh]] would produce the most respected work of Arabic grammar known simply as ''al-Kitab'' or ''The Book''.

Other caliphs exerted their influence on Arabic with [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|'Abd al-Malik]] making it the official language for administration of the new empire, and [[al-Ma'mun]] setting up the ''Bayt al-Hikma'' or [[House of Wisdom]] in [[Baghdad]] for research and translations. [[Basrah]] and [[Kufa]]h were two other important seats of learning in the early Arab world, between which there was a strong rivalry.

The institutions set up mainly to investigate more fully the Islamic religion were invaluable in studying many other subjects. Caliph [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]] was instrumental in enriching the literature by instructing scholars to translate works into Arabic. The first was probably [[Aristotle]]'s correspondence with [[Alexander the Great]] translated by Salm Abu al-'Ala'. From the east, and in a very different literary genre, the scholar [[Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa]] translated the animal [[fable]]s of the ''[[Panchatantra]]''. These translations would keep alive scholarship and learning, particularly that of [[ancient Greece]], during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] in Europe and the works would often be first re-introduced to Europe from the Arabic versions.

==Classical Arabic literature==
===Poetry===
{{Main|Arabic poetry}}
{{Arab culture}}
A large proportion of Arabic literature before the 20th century is in the form of poetry, and even prose from this period is either filled with snippets of poetry or is in the form of ''[[saj']]'' or rhymed prose. The themes of the poetry range from high-flown hymns of praise to bitter personal attacks and from religious and mystical ideas to poems on women and wine. An important feature of the poetry which would be applied to all of the literature was the idea that it must be pleasing to the ear. The poetry and much of the prose was written with the design that it would be spoken aloud and great care was taken to make all writing as mellifluous as possible.

===Non-fiction literature===
====Compilations and manuals====
In the late 9th century [[Ibn al-Nadim]], a [[Baghdad]]i bookseller, compiled a crucial work in the study of Arabic literature. ''Kitab al-Fihrist'' is a catalogue of all books available for sale in Baghdad and it gives an overview of the state of the literature at that time.

One of the most common forms of literature during the [[Abbasid]] period was the compilation. These were collections of facts, ideas, instructive stories and poems on a single topic and covers subjects as diverse as house and garden, women, gate-crashers, blind people, envy, animals and misers. These last three compilations were written by [[al-Jahiz]] the acknowledged master of the form. These collections were important for any ''nadim'', a companion to a ruler or noble whose role was often involved regaling the ruler with stories and information to entertain or advise.

A type of work closely allied to the collection was the manual in which writers like [[ibn Qutaybah]] offered instruction in subjects like etiquette, how to rule, how to be a bureaucrat and even how to write. [[Ibn Qutaybah]] also wrote one of the earliest histories of the Arabs, drawing together biblical stories, Arabic [[Folklore|folk tale]]s and more historical events.

The subject of sex was frequently investigated in Arabic literature. The ''[[ghazal]]'' or love poem had a long history being at times tender and chaste and at other times rather explicit. In the [[Sufi]] tradition the love poem would take on a wider, mystical and religious importance. Sex manuals were also written such as ''[[The Perfumed Garden]]'', ''[[The Ring of the Dove|Ṭawq al-Ḥamāmah]]'' or ''The Dove's Neckring'' by [[ibn Hazm]] and ''Nuzhat al-albab fi-ma la yujad fi kitab'' or ''Delight of Hearts Concerning What will Never Be Found in a Book'' by [[Ahmad al-Tifashi]]. Countering such works are one like ''Rawdat al-muhibbin wa-nuzhat al-mushtaqin'' or ''Meadow of Lovers and Diversion of the Infatuated'' by [[ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah]] who advises on how to separate love and lust and avoid sin.

====Biography, history, and geography====
Aside from the early [[biography|biographies]] of Muhammad, the first major biographer to weigh character rather than just producing a hymn of praise was [[al-Baladhuri]] with his ''[[Genealogies of the Nobles|Kitab ansab al-ashraf]]'' or ''Book of the Genealogies of the Noble'', a collection of biographies. Another important biographical dictionary was begun by [[ibn Khallikan]] and expanded by al-Safadi and one of the first significant [[autobiography|autobiographies]] was ''[[Kitab al-I'tibar]]'' which told of [[Usamah ibn Munqidh]] and his experiences in fighting in the [[Crusade]]s. This time period saw the emergence of the genre of ''tabaqat'' (biographical dictionaries or biographical compendia).&lt;ref&gt;Auchterlonie.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn Khurdadhbih]], an official in the [[Mail|postal service]] wrote one of the first [[Guide book|travel book]]s and the form remained a popular one in Arabic literature with books by [[ibn Hawqal]], [[ibn Fadlan]], al-Istakhri, [[al-Muqaddasi]], [[al-Idrisi]] and most famously the travels of [[ibn Battutah]]. These give a view of the many cultures of the wider [[Islamic]] world and also offer [[Muslim]] perspectives on the non-Muslim peoples on the edges of the empire. They also indicated just how great a trading power the Muslim peoples had become. These were often sprawling accounts that included details of both [[geography]] and [[history]].

Some writers concentrated solely on history like [[al-Ya'qubi]] and [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], whilst others focused on a small portion of history such as [[ibn al-Azraq]], with a history of [[Mecca]], and [[ibn Abi Tahir Tayfur]], writing a history of [[Baghdad]]. The historian regarded as the greatest of all Arabic historians though is [[ibn Khaldun]] whose history ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' focuses on society and is a founding text in [[sociology]] and [[economics]].

====Diaries====
In the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Near East]], Arabic [[Diary|diaries]] were first being written from before the 10th century, though the medieval diary which most resembles the modern diary was that of Ibn Banna in the 11th century. His diary was the earliest to be arranged in order of date (''ta'rikh'' in Arabic), very much like modern diaries.&lt;ref&gt;Makdisi, pp.173&amp;ndash;185.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Literary theory and criticism====
[[Literary criticism]] in Arabic literature often focused on religious texts, and the several long religious traditions of [[hermeneutics]] and textual [[exegesis]] have had a profound influence on the study of secular texts. This was particularly the case for the literary traditions of [[Islamic literature]].

Literary criticism was also employed in other forms of medieval [[Arabic poetry]] and literature from the 9th century, notably by [[Al-Jahiz]] in his ''al-Bayan wa-'l-tabyin'' and ''al-Hayawan'', and by [[Abdullah ibn al-Mu'tazz]] in his ''Kitab al-Badi''.&lt;ref&gt;Van Gelder, pp. 1&amp;ndash;2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiction literature===
[[File:Arabian nights manuscript.jpg|thumb|The Arabic version of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''.]]

In the [[Arab world]], there was a great distinction between ''al-fus'ha'' (quality language) and ''al-ammiyyah'' (language of the common people). Not many writers would write works in this ''al-ammiyyah'' or common language and it was felt that literature had to be improving, educational and with purpose rather than just entertainment. This did not stop the common role of the ''hakawati'' or story-teller who would retell the entertaining parts of more educational works or one of the many Arabic [[fable]]s or [[Folklore|folk-tale]]s, which were often not written down in many cases. Nevertheless, some of the earliest [[novel]]s, including the first [[philosophical novel]]s, were written by Arabic authors.

====Epic literature====
{{Main|Arabic epic literature}}
The most famous example of Arabic fiction is the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights''). It is easily the best known of all Arabic literature, and still affects many of the ideas non-Arabs have about [[Arabic culture]]. A good example of the lack of popular Arabic prose fiction is that the stories of [[Aladdin]] and [[Ali Baba]], usually regarded as part of the ''Tales from One Thousand and One Nights'', were not actually part of the ''Tales''. They were first included in [[French language|French]] translation of the ''Tales'' by [[Antoine Galland]] who heard them being told by a traditional storyteller and only existed in incomplete Arabic manuscripts before that. The other great character from Arabic literature [[Sinbad]] is from the ''Tales''.

The ''One Thousand and One Nights'' is usually placed in the genre of [[Arabic epic literature]] along with several other works. They are usually collections of short stories or episodes strung together into a long tale. The extant versions were mostly written down relatively late on, after the 14th century, although many were undoubtedly collected earlier and many of the original stories are probably pre-Islamic. Types of stories in these collections include [[animal fable]]s, [[proverb]]s, stories of ''[[jihad]]'' or propagation of the faith, humorous tales, moral tales, tales about the wily con-man Ali Zaybaq and tales about the prankster Juha.

====Maqama====
[[Maqama]] not only straddles the divide between [[prose]] and [[poetry]], being instead a form of [[rhymed prose]], it is also part way between fiction and non-fiction. Over a series of short narratives, which are fictionalised versions of real life situations, different ideas are contemplated. A good example of this is a maqama on musk, which purports to compare the feature of different perfumes but is in fact a work of political satire comparing several competing rulers. Maqama also makes use of the doctrine of ''badi'' or deliberately adding complexity to display the writer's dexterity with language. [[Al-Hamadhani]] is regarded as the originator of the maqama and his work was taken up by [[Al-Hariri of Basra|Abu Muhammad al-Qasim al-Hariri]] with one of al-Hariri's maqama a study of al-Hamadhani own work. Maqama was an incredibly popular form of Arabic literature, being one of the few forms which continued to be written during the decline of Arabic in the 17th and 18th centuries.

====Romantic literature====
A famous example of [[Romance (love)|romantic]] [[Arabic poetry]] is ''[[Layla and Majnun]]'', dating back to the [[Umayyad]] era in the 7th century. It is a [[Tragedy|tragic]] story of undying [[love]]. ''Layla and Majnun'' is considered part of the [[platonic Love]] (Arabic: حب عذري) genre, so-called because the couple never marry or consummate their relationship, that is prominent in Arabic literature, though the literary motif is found throughout the world. Other famous Virgin Love stories include ''Qays and Lubna'', ''Kuthair and Azza'', ''[[Marwa and al-Majnun al-Faransi]]'' and ''[[Antarah ibn Shaddad|Antara and Abla]]''.

The 10th century ''[[Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity]]'' features a fictional [[anecdote]] of a "prince who strays from his palace during his wedding feast and, drunk, spends the night in a cemetery, confusing a [[Corpse bride|corpse with his bride]]. The story is used as a gnostic parable of the soul's [[pre-existence]] and return from its terrestrial [[Wiktionary:sojourn|sojourn]]".&lt;ref&gt;Hamori, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another medieval Arabic love story was ''[[Hadith Bayad wa Riyad]]'' (''The Story of Bayad and Riyad''), a 13th-century [[Arabic]] love story. The main characters of the tale are Bayad, a merchant's son and a foreigner from [[Damascus]], and Riyad, a well-educated girl in the court of an unnamed [[Hajib]] (vizier or minister) of 'Iraq which is referred to as the lady. The ''Hadith Bayad wa Riyad'' manuscript is believed to be the only illustrated manuscript known to have survived from more than eight centuries of Muslim and Arab presence in Spain.

Many of the tales in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' are also love stories or involve romantic love as a central theme. This includes the [[frame story]] of [[Scheherazade]] herself, and many of the [[List of stories within One Thousand and One Nights|stories she narrates]], including "[[Aladdin]]", "[[The Ebony Horse]]", "[[The Three Apples]]", "Tale of Tàj al-Mulúk and the Princess Dunyà: The Lover and the Loved", "Adi bin Zayd and the Princess Hind", "Di'ibil al-Khuza'i With the Lady and Muslim bin al-Walid", "The Three Unfortunate Lovers", and others.

There were several elements of [[courtly love]] which were developed in Arabic literature, namely the notions of "love for love's sake" and "exaltation of the beloved lady" which have been traced back to Arabic literature of the 9th and 10th centuries. The notion of the "ennobling power" of love was developed in the early 11th century by the [[Muslim psychology|Persian psychologist]] and [[Early Islamic philosophy|philosopher]], [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]] (known as "Avicenna" in Europe), in his Arabic treatise ''Risala fi'l-Ishq'' (''Treatise on Love''). The final element of courtly love, the concept of "love as desire never to be fulfilled", was also at times implicit in [[Arabic poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;Von Grunebaum, pp. 233&amp;ndash;234.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Murder mystery====
The earliest known example of a [[whodunit]] [[Crime fiction|murder mystery]] was "[[The Three Apples]]", one of the tales narrated by [[Scheherazade]] in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights''). In this tale, a fisherman discovers a heavy locked chest along the [[Tigris]] river and he sells it to the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid Caliph]], [[Harun al-Rashid]], who then has the chest broken open only to find inside it the dead body of a young woman who was cut into pieces. Harun orders his [[vizier]], [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]], to solve the crime and find the murderererer within three days, or be executed if he fails his assignment.&lt;ref&gt;Pinault, pp. 86–91.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suspense]] is generated through multiple [[plot twist]]s that occur as the story progresses.&lt;ref&gt;Pinault, pp. 93, 95 &amp; 97.&lt;/ref&gt; This may thus be considered an archetype for [[detective fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;Pinault, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Satire and comedy====
In [[Arabic poetry]], the genre of [[Satire|satirical]] poetry was known as ''hija''. Satire was introduced into prose literature by the [[Afro-Arab]] author [[al-Jahiz]] in the 9th century. While dealing with serious topics in what are now known as [[anthropology]], sociology and [[Psychology in medieval Islam|psychology]], he introduced a satirical approach, "based on the premise that, however serious the subject under review, it could be made more interesting and thus achieve greater effect, if only one leavened the lump of solemnity by the insertion of a few amusing anecdotes or by the throwing out of some witty or paradoxical observations."&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; He was well aware that, in treating of new themes in his prose works, he would have to employ a vocabulary of a nature more familiar in ''hija'', satirical poetry. For example, in one of his [[Zoology|zoological]] works, he satirized the preference for longer [[human penis size]], writing: "If the length of the penis were a sign of honor, then the [[mule]] would belong to the (honorable tribe of) [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]]". Another satirical story based on this preference was an ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale called "Ali with the Large Member".&lt;ref&gt;Marzolph, van Leeuwen &amp; Wassouf, pp. 97&amp;ndash;98.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 10th century, the writer [[Tha'alibi]] recorded satirical poetry written by the poets As-Salami and Abu Dulaf, with As-Salami praising Abu Dulaf's [[Polymath|wide breadth of knowledge]] and then mocking his ability in all these subjects, and with Abu Dulaf responding back and satirizing As-Salami in return.&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth, pp. 77&amp;ndash;78.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of Arabic [[political satire]] included another 10th-century poet Jarir satirizing Farazdaq as "a transgressor of the [[Sharia]]" and later Arabic poets in turn using the term "Farazdaq-like" as a form of political satire.&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms "[[comedy]]" and "satire" became synonymous after [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' was translated into Arabic in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], where it was elaborated upon by Arabic writers and [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]], such as Abu Bischr, his pupil [[al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], and [[Averroes]]. Due to cultural differences, they disassociated comedy from [[Greek drama]]tic representation and instead identified it with [[Arabic poetry|Arabic poetic]] themes and forms, such as ''hija'' (satirical poetry). They viewed comedy as simply the "art of reprehension", and made no reference to light and cheerful events, or troublous beginnings and happy endings, associated with classical Greek comedy. After the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]], the term "comedy" thus gained a new semantic meaning in [[Medieval literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Webber.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Theatre====
While [[puppet]] theatre and [[passion play]]s were popular in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]],&lt;ref name=Moreh/&gt; live [[theatre]] and [[drama]] has only been a visible part of Arabic literature in the modern era. There may have been a much longer theatrical tradition but it was probably not regarded as legitimate literature and mostly went unrecorded. There is an ancient tradition of public performance amongst [[Shi'i]] Muslims of a play depicting the life and death of [[al-Husayn]] at the [[battle of Karbala]] in 680 CE. There are also several plays composed by Shams al-din Muhammad ibn Daniyal in the 13th century when he mentions that older plays are getting stale and offers his new works as fresh material.

The most popular forms of theater in the medieval Islamic world were puppet theatre (which included hand puppets, [[shadow play]]s and [[marionette]] productions) and live [[passion play]]s known as ''ta'ziya'', where actors re-enact episodes from [[Muslim history]]. In particular, [[Shia Islam]]ic [[Play (theatre)|plays]] revolved around the ''[[shahid|shaheed]]'' (martyrdom) of [[Ali]]'s sons [[Hasan ibn Ali]] and [[Husayn ibn Ali]]. Live secular plays were known as ''akhraja'', recorded in medieval ''[[Adab (behavior)|adab]]'' literature, though they were less common than puppetry and ''ta'ziya'' theater.&lt;ref name=Moreh&gt;Moreh (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Moors]] had a noticeable influence on the works of [[George Peele]] and [[William Shakespeare]]. Some of their works featured Moorish characters, such as Peele's ''[[The Battle of Alcazar]]'' and Shakespeare's ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' and ''[[Othello]]'', which featured a Moorish [[Othello (character)|Othello]] as its title character. These works are said to have been inspired by several Moorish [[delegation]]s from [[Morocco]] to [[Elizabethan England]] at the beginning of the 17th century, ignoring the fact that ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' and ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' were both penned in the 16th century.

====Philosophical novels====
The Arab [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]], [[Ibn Tufail]] (Abubacer)&lt;ref name=Jon&gt;McGinnis &amp; Reisman, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ibn al-Nafis]], were pioneers of the [[philosophical novel]] as they wrote the earliest [[novel]]s dealing with [[Philosophy and literature|philosophical fiction]]. Ibn Tufail wrote the first Arabic novel ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' (''Philosophus Autodidactus'') as a response to [[Al-Ghazali]]'s ''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]''. This was followed by [[Ibn al-Nafis]] who wrote a fictional narrative ''[[Theologus Autodidactus]]'' as a response to Ibn Tufail's ''Philosophus Autodidactus''. Both of these narratives had [[protagonist]]s (Hayy in ''Philosophus Autodidactus'' and Kamil in ''Theologus Autodidactus'') who were [[Autodidacticism|autodidactic]] individuals [[Abiogenesis|spontaneously generated]] in a [[cave]] and living in seclusion on a [[desert island]], both being the earliest examples of a desert island story. However, while Hayy lives alone on the desert island for most of the story in ''Philosophus Autodidactus'' (until he meets a [[castaway]] named Absal), the story of Kamil extends beyond the desert island setting in ''Theologus Autodidactus'' (when castaways take him back to civilization with them), developing into the earliest known [[coming of age]] plot and eventually becoming the first example of a [[science fiction]] novel.

Ibn al-Nafis described his book ''Theologus Autodidactus'' as a defense of "the system of Islam and the Muslims' doctrines on the missions of Prophets, the religious laws, the resurrection of the body, and the transitoriness of the world." He presents rational arguments for bodily [[resurrection]] and the [[immortality]] of the human [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], using both demonstrative [[reasoning]] and material from the hadith corpus to prove his case. Later Islamic scholars viewed this work as a response to the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] claim of Avicenna and Ibn Tufail that bodily resurrection cannot be proven through reason, a view that was earlier criticized by al-Ghazali. Ibn al-Nafis' work was later translated into Latin and English as ''Theologus Autodidactus'' in the early 20th century.

A [[Latin]] translation of Ibn Tufail's work, entitled ''Philosophus Autodidactus'', first appeared in 1671, prepared by [[Edward Pococke]] the Younger. The first English translation by [[Simon Ockley]] was published in 1708, and [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] translations were also published at the time. These translations later inspired [[Daniel Defoe]] to write ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', which also featured a desert island narrative and was regarded as the [[first novel in English]].&lt;ref&gt;Hassan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glassé, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wainwright"&gt;Wainwright.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Philosophus Autodidactus'' also inspired [[Robert Boyle]], an acquaintance of Pococke, to write his own philosophical novel set on an island, ''The Aspiring Naturalist'', in the late 17th century.&lt;ref name="Toomer-222"/&gt; The story also anticipated [[Rousseau]]'s ''[[Emile, or On Education|Émile]]'' in some ways, and is also similar to the later story of [[Mowgli]] in [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' as well the character of [[Tarzan]], in that a baby is abandoned in a deserted tropical island where he is taken care of and fed by a mother [[wolf]]. Other European writers influenced by ''Philosophus Autodidactus'' include [[John Locke]],&lt;ref&gt;Russell, ed., pp. 224&amp;ndash;239.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gottfried Leibniz]],&lt;ref name=Wainwright/&gt; [[Melchisédech Thévenot]], [[John Wallis]], [[Christiaan Huygens]],&lt;ref&gt;Russell, ed., p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Keith (missionary)|George Keith]], [[Robert Barclay]], the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]],&lt;ref&gt;Russell, ed., p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Samuel Hartlib]].&lt;ref name="Toomer-222"&gt;Toomer, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Science fiction====
''Al-Risalah al-Kamiliyyah fil Sira al-Nabawiyyah'' (''The Treatise of Kamil on the Prophet's Biography''), known in [[English language|English]] as ''Theologus Autodidactus'' (which is a phonetic transliteration of the Greek name Θεολόγος Αὐτοδίδακτος, meaning self-taught theologian), written by the [[Arab]]ian polymath [[Ibn al-Nafis]] (1213–1288), is the earliest known [[science fiction]] novel. While also being an early [[desert island]] story and [[coming of age]] story, the novel deals with various science fiction elements such as [[Abiogenesis|spontaneous generation]], [[futurology]], [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|apocalyptic themes]], the [[Islamic eschatology|end of the world and doomsday]], [[resurrection]] and the [[afterlife]]. Rather than giving supernatural or mythological explanations for these events, Ibn al-Nafis attempted to explain these plot elements using his own extensive [[Science in medieval Islam|scientific knowledge]] in [[Medicine in medieval Islam|anatomy, biology, physiology]], [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|astronomy, cosmology]] and [[Geography in medieval Islam|geology]]. His main purpose behind this science fiction work was to explain [[Islam]]ic religious teachings in terms of [[Islamic science|science]] and [[Early Islamic philosophy|philosophy]]. For example, it was through this novel that Ibn al-Nafis introduces his scientific theory of [[metabolism]], and he makes references to his own scientific discovery of the [[pulmonary circulation]] in order to explain bodily resurrection. The novel was later translated into English as ''Theologus Autodidactus'' in the early 20th century.

A number of [[Story within a story|stories within]] the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights'') also feature science fiction elements. One example is "The Adventures of Bulukiya", where the [[protagonist]] Bulukiya's quest for the [[Elixir of life|herb of immortality]] leads him to explore the seas, journey to the [[Garden of Eden]] and to [[Jahannam]], and travel across the [[cosmos]] to different worlds much larger than his own world, anticipating elements of [[Galaxy|galactic]] science fiction;&lt;ref name=Irwin&gt;Irwin, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; along the way, he encounters societies of [[Genie|jinns]],&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; [[mermaid]]s, talking [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpents]], talking [[tree]]s, and other forms of life.&lt;ref name=Irwin/&gt; In another ''Arabian Nights'' tale, the protagonist Abdullah the Fisherman gains the ability to breathe underwater and discovers an underwater [[submarine]] society that is portrayed as an inverted reflection of society on land, in that the underwater society follows a form of [[primitive communism]] where concepts like money and clothing do not exist. Other ''Arabian Nights'' tales deal with lost ancient technologies, advanced ancient civilizations that went astray, and catastrophes which overwhelmed them.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, pp. 211&amp;ndash;212.&lt;/ref&gt; "[[The City of Brass]]" features a group of travellers on an [[Archaeology|archaeological]] expedition&lt;ref&gt;Hamori, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; across the [[Sahara]] to find an ancient lost city and attempt to recover a brass vessel that [[Solomon]] once used to trap a [[Genie|jinn]],&lt;ref&gt;Pinault, pp. 148–149 &amp; 217–219.&lt;/ref&gt; and, along the way, encounter a [[Mummy|mummified]] queen, [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|petrified]] inhabitants,&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; lifelike [[humanoid robot]]s and [[Automaton|automata]], seductive [[marionette]]s dancing without strings,&lt;ref&gt;Hamori, pp. 12&amp;ndash;13.&lt;/ref&gt; and a brass horseman [[robot]] who directs the party towards the ancient city. "[[The Ebony Horse]]" features a robot&lt;ref name=Pinault/&gt; in the form of a flying mechanical horse controlled using keys that could fly into outer space and towards the Sun, while the "Third Qalandar's Tale" also features a robot in the form of an uncanny [[Sailor|boatman]].&lt;ref name=Pinault&gt;Pinault, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; "The City of Brass" and "The Ebony Horse" can be considered early examples of proto-science fiction.

Other examples of early Arabic proto-science fiction include [[al-Farabi]]'s ''Opinions of the residents of a splendid city'' about a [[utopia]]n society, [[Zakariya al-Qazwini|al-Qazwini]]'s futuristic tale of ''Awaj bin Anfaq'' about a man who travelled to Earth from a distant planet, and elements such as the [[flying carpet]].

==The decline of Arabic literature==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
The expansion of the Arab people in the 7th and 8th century brought them into contact with a variety of different peoples who would affect their culture. Most significant for literature was the [[Persian Empire|Persia]]. [[Shu'ubiyya]] is the name of the conflict between the Arabs and Non-Arabs. Although producing heated debate amongst scholars and varying styles of literature, this was not a damaging conflict and had more to do with forging a single Islamic cultural identity. [[Bashshar ibn Burd]], of Persian heritage, summed up his own stance in a few lines of poetry:

:Never did he sing camel songs behind a scabby beast,
:nor pierce the bitter colocynth out of sheer hunger
:nor dig a lizard out of the ground and eat it...

The cultural heritage of the desert dwelling Arabs continued to show its influence even though many scholars and writers were living in the large Arab cities. When [[Khalil ibn Ahmad]] enumerated the parts of poetry he called the line of verse a ''bayt'' or tent and ''sabah'' or tent-rope for a foot. Even during the 20th century this nostalgia for the simple desert life would appear or at least be consciously revived.

A slow resurgence of the [[Persian language]] and a re-location of the government and main seat of learning to [[Baghdad]], reduced the production of Arabic literature. Many Arabic themes and styles were taken up in Persian with [[Omar Khayyam]], [[Farid al-Din Attar|Attar]] and [[Rumi]] all clearly influenced by the earlier work. The Arabic language still initially retained its importance in politics and administration, although the rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]] confined it solely to religion. Alongside [[Persian language|Persian]], the many variants of the [[Turkic languages]] would dominate the literature of the Arab region until the 20th century. Nevertheless, some Arabic influences remained visible.

==Modern literature==
{{Main|Modern Arabic literature}}
During the 19th century, a revival took place in Arabic literature, along with much of Arabic culture, and is referred to in Arabic as "''[[al-Nahda]]''", which means "the Renaissance". This resurgence of writing in Arabic was confined mainly to [[Syria]], [[Egypt]] and [[Lebanon]] until the 20th century when it spread to other countries in the region. This Renaissance was not only felt within the Arab world but also beyond, with a great interest in the translating of Arabic works into European languages. Although the use of the Arabic language was revived, particularly in poetry, many of the [[Trope (linguistics)|tropes]] of the previous literature which served to make it so ornate and complicated were dropped.

Just as in the 8th century, when a movement to translate [[ancient Greek]] and other literature had helped vitalise Arabic literature, another translation movement would offer new ideas and material for Arabic. An early popular success was ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', which spurred a host of [[historical novel]]s on Arabic subjects. Two important translators were [[Rifa'a al-Tahtawi]] and [[Jabra Ibrahim Jabra]].

Throughout the 20th century, Arabic writers in both poetry and prose have reflected the changing political and social climate of the Arab world in their work. Anti-colonial themes were prominent early in the 20th century, with writers continuing to explore the region's relationship with the West until the present day. Internal political upheaval has also been a challenge, with some writers suffering censorship. There are many contemporary Arabic writers, such as Mahmoud saeed (Iraq) who wrote ''Bin Barka Ally'', and ''I Am The One Who Saw (Saddam City)''. Other contemporary writers include [[Sonallah Ibrahim]] and [[Abdul Rahman Munif]], who were imprisoned by the state for their anti-government work. At the same time, others who had written works supporting or praising governments were promoted to positions of authority within cultural bodies. Non-fiction writers and academics have also produced political polemics and criticisms aiming to re-shape Arabic politics. Some of the best known are [[Taha Hussein]]'s ''[[The Future of Culture in Egypt]]'', which was an important work of [[Egyptian nationalism]], and the works of [[Nawal el-Saadawi]] who campaigns for [[women's rights]].

===Poetry===
{{main|modern Arabic poetry}}
{{Quote box|quote=Mention no longer the driver on his night journey and the wide striding camels, and give up talk of morning dew and ruins.&lt;br/&gt;I no longer have any taste for love songs on dwellings which already went down in seas of [too many] odes.&lt;br/&gt;So, too, the ''[[Haloxylon persicum|ghada]]'', whose fire, fanned by the sighs of those enamored of it, cries out to the poets: "Alas for my burning!"&lt;br/&gt;If a steamer leaves with my friends on sea or land, why should I direct my complaints to the camels?|source=&amp;mdash;Excerpt from [[Francis Marrash]]'s ''Mashhad al-ahwal'' (1870), translated by [[Shmuel Moreh]].&lt;ref name="Studies in Modern Arabic Prose and Poetry p. 34"&gt;Moreh (1988), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;|align=right|width=41%}}
Beginning in the 19th and early 20th centuries, as part of what is now called "the Arabic renaissance" or "''[[al-Nahda]]''", poets like [[Francis Marrash]], [[Ahmad Shawqi]] and [[Hafiz Ibrahim]] began to explore the possibility of developing the classical poetic forms.&lt;ref&gt;Moreh (1976), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Somekh, pp. 36&amp;ndash;82.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these neoclassical poets were acquainted with Western literature but mostly continued to write in classical forms, while others, denouncing blind imitation of classical poetry and its recurring themes,&lt;ref name="Studies in Modern Arabic Prose and Poetry p. 34"/&gt; sought inspiration from French or English [[romanticism]].

The next generation of poets, the so-called romantic poets, had begun to a far greater extent to absorb the impact of developments in Western poetry, and felt constrained by neo-classical traditions which the previous generation had tried to uphold. The [[Mahjar]]i poets were emigrants who mostly wrote in the Americas, but were similarly beginning to experiment further with the possibilities of Arabic poetry. This experimentation continued in the Middle East throughout the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Jayyusi (1992), pp. 132&amp;ndash;180.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], there was a largely unsuccessful movement by several poets to write poems in [[free verse]] (''shi'r hurr''). Iraqi poets [[Badr Shakir al-Sayyab]] and [[Nazik Al-Malaika]] (1923-2007), are considered to be the originators of free verse in Arabic poetry. Most of these experiments were abandoned in favour of [[prose poetry]], of which the first examples in modern Arabic literature are to be found in the writings of [[Francis Marrash]],&lt;ref&gt;Jayyusi (1977), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; and of which two of the most influential proponents were Nazik al-Malaika and [[Iman Mersal]]. The development of [[modernist poetry]] also influenced poetry in Arabic. More recently, poets such as [[Adunis]] have pushed the boundaries of stylistic experimentation even further.

Poetry retains a very important status in the Arab world. [[Mahmoud Darwish]] was regarded as the Palestinian national poet, and his funeral was attended by thousands of mourners. Syrian poet [[Nizar Qabbani]] addressed less political themes, but was regarded as a cultural icon, and his poems provide the lyrics for many popular songs.

Two distinct trends can be found in the ''nahda'' period of revival. The first was a neo-classical movement which sought to rediscover the literary traditions of the past, and was influenced by traditional literary genres&amp;mdash;such as the ''[[maqama]]''&amp;mdash;and works like ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''. In contrast, a modernist movement began by translating Western modernist works&amp;mdash;primarily novels&amp;mdash;into Arabic.

In the 19th century, individual authors in [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Egypt]] created original works by imitating classical narrative genres: [[Ahmad Faris Shidyaq]] with ''Leg upon Leg'' (1855), Khalil Khoury with ''Yes... so I am not a Frank'' (1859), [[Francis Marrash]] with ''The Forest of Truth'' (1865), Salim al-Bustani with ''At a Loss in the Levantine Gardens'' (1870), and Muhammad al-Muwaylihi with ''Isa ibn Hisham's Tale'' (1907).&lt;ref name="Logan, ed., p. 573."&gt;Logan, ed., p. 573.&lt;/ref&gt; This trend was furthered by [[Jurji Zaydan]] (author of many historical novels), [[Khalil Gibran]], [[Mikha'il Na'ima]] and [[Muhammad Husayn Haykal]] (author of ''[[Zaynab (novel)|Zaynab]]''). Meanwhile, female writer [[Zaynab Fawwaz]]'s first novel ''Ḥusn al-'Awāqib aw Ghādah al-Zāhirah'' (''The Happy Ending'', 1899) was also influential.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph T. Zeidan, Arab Women Novelists: the Formative Years and Beyond (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1995), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the authors of the ''Encyclopedia of the Novel'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Almost each of the above [works] have been claimed as the first Arabic novel, which goes to suggest that the Arabic novel emerged from several rehearsals and multiple beginnings rather than from one single origin. Given that the very Arabic word "''riwaya''", which is now used exclusively in reference to the "novel", has traditionally conjured up a tangle of narrative genres [...], it might not be unfair to contend that the Arabic novel owes its early formation not only to the appropriation of the novel genre from Europe [...] but also, and more importantly, to the revival and transformation of traditional narrative genres in the wake of [[Napoleon]]'s 1798 expedition into Egypt and the Arab world's firsthand encounter with industrialized imperial Europe.&lt;ref name="Logan, ed., p. 573."/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A common theme in the modern Arabic novel is the study of family life with obvious resonances of the wider family of the Arabic world.{{according to whom|date=October 2012}} Many of the novels have been unable to avoid the politics and conflicts of the region with war often acting as background to intimate family dramas. The works of [[Naguib Mahfuz]] depict life in [[Cairo]], and his [[Cairo Trilogy]], describing the struggles of a modern Cairene family across three generations, won him a [[Nobel prize for literature]] in 1988. He was the first Arabic writer to win the prize.

===Plays===
The musical plays of Maroun Naccache from the mid-1800s are considered the birth of not only [[theatre in Lebanon]], but also modern Arab theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Arabic drama began to be written in the 19th century chiefly in Egypt and mainly influenced and in imitation of French works. It was not until the 20th century that it began to develop a distinctly Arab flavour and be seen elsewhere. The most important Arab playwright was [[Tawfiq al-Hakim]] whose first play was a re-telling of the Qur'anic story of the [[Seven sleepers]] and the second an epilogue for the ''Thousand and One Nights''. Other important dramatists of the region include Yusuf al-Ani from [[Iraq]] and [[Saadallah Wannous]] from [[Syria]].

==Women in Arabic literature==
{{see also|Women's literary salons and societies in the Arab world}}{{Islamic Culture}}

In the words of Clarissa Burt,

:: Despite the historical and social conditions that contributed to an almost total eclipse of women's poetic expression in the literary record as maintained in Arabic culture from the pre-Islamic era through the nineteenth century, with a few significant exceptions, women poets writing in Arabic have made tremendous strides since the dawn of the twentieth century in presenting their poetic offerings in mainstream cultural forums, and contributing to a plethora of new and modern poetic currents in literary cultural throughout the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;Clarissa Burt, 'Arts: Poets and Poetry: Arab States', in Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures, ed. by Suad Joseph (Leiden: Brill, 2003-2007), V: 77-80 (pp. 77-78).&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst not playing a major attested part in Arabic literature for much of its history, women have had a continuing role. Women's literature in Arabic has been relatively little researched, and features relatively little in most Arabic-language education systems, meaning that its prominence and importance is probably generally underrated.&lt;ref&gt;Hoda Thabet, ''Pioneering Female Authors in Egypt and the Levant: An Introduction into the Origins of the Arabic Novel'' (Reykjavík: Háskólaprent, 2013) {{ISBN|978-9979-72-479-7}}; cf.

Meri, 2 vols (New York: Routledge, 2006), II 867, {{cite web|url=http://nelc.uchicago.edu/sites/nelc.uchicago.edu/files/2006%20Women%20Poets%20(Med.%20Islamic.%20Civ.%20Enc.).pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207005116/http://nelc.uchicago.edu/sites/nelc.uchicago.edu/files/2006%20Women%20Poets%20%28Med.%20Islamic.%20Civ.%20Enc.%29.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-07 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Medieval Period===
{{see also|Medieval Arabic female poets}}

In the estimation of Tahera Qutbuddin,

: the citation of women's poetry in the general medieval anthologies is sparse. The earliest anthologists either ignored women poets or made disparaging remarks about them ... In his introduction to the ''Nuzhat al-Julasa'', al-Suyuti refers to a large (at least six-volume) anthology--now lost--of 'ancient' women's poetry ... It would seem from this that women poets may have formed a more dynamic part of the poetic landscape, at least in the earliest classical period, than is generally believed.&lt;ref&gt;Tahera Qutbuddin, 'Women Poets', in ''Medieval Islamic Civilisation: An Encyclopedia'', ed. by Josef W. Meri, 2 vols (New York: Routledge, 2006), II 865-67 (p. 867), {{cite web|url=http://nelc.uchicago.edu/sites/nelc.uchicago.edu/files/2006%20Women%20Poets%20(Med.%20Islamic.%20Civ.%20Enc.).pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207005116/http://nelc.uchicago.edu/sites/nelc.uchicago.edu/files/2006%20Women%20Poets%20%28Med.%20Islamic.%20Civ.%20Enc.%29.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-07 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

(The main modern anthology of medieval Arabic women's writing in English translation is that of Abdullah al-Udhari.)&lt;ref&gt;''Classical Poems by Arab Women: A Bilingual Anthology'', ed. and trans. by Abdullah al-Udhari (London: Saqi Books, 1999) {{ISBN|086356-047-4}}; books.google.co.uk/books/about/Classical_poems_by_Arab_women.html?id=WniBAAAAIAAJ&amp;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-Islamic women's literature seems to have been limited to the genre of ''marathiya'' ('elegy').&lt;ref&gt;Tahera Qutbuddin, 'Women Poets', in ''Medieval Islamic Civilisation: An Encyclopedia'', ed. by Josef W. Meri, 2 vols (New York: Routledge, 2006), II 865, {{cite web|url=http://nelc.uchicago.edu/sites/nelc.uchicago.edu/files/2006%20Women%20Poets%20(Med.%20Islamic.%20Civ.%20Enc.).pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207005116/http://nelc.uchicago.edu/sites/nelc.uchicago.edu/files/2006%20Women%20Poets%20%28Med.%20Islamic.%20Civ.%20Enc.%29.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-07 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest poetesses were [[al-Khansa]] and [[Layla al-Akhyaliyyah]] of the 7th century. Their concentration on the ''ritha&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' or elegy suggests that this was a form deemed acceptable for women to work with. However, the love lyric was also an important genre of women's poetry. The [[Umayyad]] and [['Abbasid]] periods saw professional singing slave girls (''qiyan'', sing. ''quayna'') who sang love songs and accompanied these with music; alongside panegyric and competitive verse-capping, ''qiyan'' also sang love-poetry (''ghazal''). In his ''Risalat al-Qiyan'' (''Epistle of the Singing-Girls''), al-Jahiz (d. 255/868×69) reckoned that an accomplished singer might have a repertoire of 4,000 songs. Pre-eminent 'Abbasid singing-girls included: [['Inan]] (paramour of [[Harun al-Rashid]], r. 786-809); [[Arib al-Ma'muniyya]] (concubine of [[Al-Ma'mun]], r. 813-17); and [[Fadl Ashsha'ira]] (d. 871; concubine of [[Al-Mutawakkil]], r. 847-61). Meanwhile, Harun al-Rashid's half-sister [[‘Ulayya bint al-Mahdī]] (777-825) was also known for her poetic skills, as was the mystic and poet of Basra [[Rabia Basri|Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya]] (d. 801).&lt;ref name="Tahera Qutbuddin 2006"&gt;Tahera Qutbuddin, 'Women Poets', in ''Medieval Islamic Civilisation: An Encyclopedia'', ed. by Josef W. Meri, 2 vols (New York: Routledge, 2006), II 866, {{cite web|url=http://nelc.uchicago.edu/sites/nelc.uchicago.edu/files/2006%20Women%20Poets%20(Med.%20Islamic.%20Civ.%20Enc.).pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207005116/http://nelc.uchicago.edu/sites/nelc.uchicago.edu/files/2006%20Women%20Poets%20%28Med.%20Islamic.%20Civ.%20Enc.%29.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-07 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Women also had an important role in pre-modern periods as patrons of the arts.&lt;ref&gt;[[D. Fairchild Ruggles]], 'Women, Patrons', ed. by Josef W. Meri, 2 vols (New York: Routledge, 2006), II 863-65&lt;/ref&gt;

Writings from medieval moorish Spain attest to several important female writers, pre-eminently [[Wallada bint al-Mustakfi]] (1001–1091), an Umawi princess of al-Andulus, who wrote [[Sufi]] poetry and was the lover of fellow poet [[ibn Zaydun]]; the Granadan poet [[Hafsa Bint al-Hajj al-Rukuniyya]] (d. 1190/91); and [[Nazhun al-Garnatiya bint al-Qulai’iya]] (d. 1100). These and other women writers suggest a hidden world of literature by women.

Despite their lack of prominence among the literary elite, women still played an important part as characters in Arabic literature. ''[[Delhemma|Sirat al-amirah Dhat al-Himmah]]'', for example, is an [[arabic epic literature|Arabic epic]] with a female warrior, Fatima Dhat al-Himma, as protagonist,&lt;ref&gt;Remke Kruk, ''The Warrior Women of Islam: Female Empowerment in Arabic Popular Literature'', Library of Middle East History, 54 (London: Tauris, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Scheherazade]] is famous for cunningly telling stories in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' to save her life.

The Mamluk period saw the flourishing of the Sufi master and poet [['A'isha al-Ba'uniyya]] (d. 1517), who was probably the Arabic-speaking world's most prolific female author before the twentieth century. Living in what is now Egypt and Syria, she came from the [[al-Ba'uni]] family, noted for its judges and scholars, and belonged to the 'Urmawi branch of the [[Qadiriyya]] order. 'A'isha composed at least twelve books in prose and verse, which included over three hundred long mystical and religious poems.&lt;ref name="Tahera Qutbuddin 2006"/&gt;

===Al- Nahda===
{{see also|Al-Nahda}}

The earliest prominent female Arabic writer of the modern period during which the Arab cultural renaissance ([[Al-Nahda]]) took place is [[Táhirih]] (1820–52), from what is now Iran. She wrote fine Arabic and Persian poetry.

[[Women's literary salons and societies in the Arab world]] were also pioneered during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, initially by Christian Arab women, who tended to have more freedom and access to education than their female Muslim counterparts in the Ottoman Empire at the time. [[Maryana Marrash]] (1848−1919) started what is now believed to have been the first salon including women, in [[Aleppo]]. In 1912, [[May Ziade]] (1886-1941) also started a literary salon in [[Cairo]] and in 1922, [[Mary 'Ajami]] (1888−1965) did the same in [[Damascus]]. These salons supported the emergence of women's writing (both literary and journalistic) and women's presses through increased interaction in the male-dominated world of Arab literature.

=== Late 20th Century to Early 21st Century ===
A quote by Clarissa Burt on modern Arab poetry by Female Arab authors: &lt;blockquote&gt;Unlocked from the constraints of the traditional ode, several of these and other women have had long careers of poetry writing, entering into areas of expression of women's experience that had not been presented in print before. In many ways, this poetic work has gone hand in hand with the growth of critical discourse about women's role, status, and experience, and women's desires to be fully participating members of public society. [...] With few exceptions, critical reception in the Arab world of these and other women poets has been lukewarm at best, for the most part, often filled with criticism of their adherence or lack thereof to poetic principles that have been held as prescriptive in mahy schools of Arabic literary criticiam.&lt;ref name="Clarissa Burt 2007 p. 78" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Alongside [[Maryana Marrash]], [[May Ziade]], and [[Mary 'Ajami]], pioneering figures in women's writing in Arabic during this time period are [[Zaynab Fawwaz]] (modern Lebanon/Egypt, 1846–1914), who arguably wrote the first novel in Arabic and was the first woman to write a play in that language as well; [[Aisha Taymur]] (modern Turkey/Egypt, 1840–1902); [[Malak Hifni Nasif]] (under the pseudonym Bahithat al-Badiyya, Egypt 1886-1918); [[Anbara Salam Khalidy]] (modern Palestine/Lebanon, 1897-1988) [[Anbara Salam Khalidy]] (modern Palestine/Lebanon, 1897–1986) and [[Salma al-Kadhimiyya]] (Iraq, 1908–1953, under the pseudonym Umm Nizar).

Since the Second World War, Arabic women's poetry has become markedly more prominent.&lt;ref name="Clarissa Burt 2007 p. 78"&gt;Clarissa Burt, 'Arts: Poets and Poetry: Arab States', in ''Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures'', ed. by Suad Joseph (Leiden: Brill, 2003-2007), V: 77-80 (p. 78).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nazik Al-Malaika]] (Iraq/Egypt, 1923-2007) was daughter of [[Salma al-Kadhimiyya]], who in her own right was a poet and a vanguard of the early nationalist movement. Al-Malaika alongside [[Badr Shakir al-Sayyab]], can be considered the initiator of the Free Verse Movement in Arabic poetry. Al-Malaika's poetry is characterised by thematic variations and the use of imagery. She also wrote ''The Case of Contemporary Poets'' which is considered a major contribution to Arab literary criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=RIB5qT9sGnwC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;lpg=PA152&amp;dq=Salma+al-Kadhimiyya&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IWahXdxYAW&amp;sig=9wK92g_sxw6URS7PdHjKGrCZKp4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiM4Y3tmLrbAhXGchQKHWvXAJ8Q6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Salma%20al-Kadhimiyya&amp;f=false|title=Historical Dictionary of Iraq|last=Ghareeb|first=Edmund A.|last2=Dougherty|first2=Beth|date=2004-03-18|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810865686|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major post-war poetic voices include [[Fadwa Touqan]] (Palestine, 1917-2003), [[Rabāb al-Kāẓimī]] (Iraq, b. 1920), [[Jalīla Riḍa]] (Egypt, 1920-2001), [[Salma Jayyusi]] (Palestine, 1926-), [[Lami'a 'Abbas 'Amara]] (Iraq, b. 1927).

[[Saniya Salih]]'s (Syria 1935-85) poetry appeared in many well-known magazines of her time, particularly ''Shi’r'' and ''[[Mawaqif,]]'' but remained in the shadow of work by her husband, the poet [[Muhammad al-Maghut|Muhammad al-Maghout]]. Her later poems often address her relationship with her two daughters, and many were written during her illness as she died of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arablit.org/2017/06/23/saniyah-saleh/|title=Friday Finds: The Poetry of Underappreciated Saniyah Saleh|date=2017-06-23|work=ArabLit|access-date=2018-06-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, other Arab post-war poetesses include: [[Zubayda Bashīr]] (Tunis, 1938-); [[Ghada al-Samman]] (Syria, 1942-), known not only for poetry but also for short stories and novels, [[Su'ad al-Sabah]] (Kuwait, 1942-) and [[Hamda Khamis]] (Bahrain, 1946-) who is regarded as Bahrain's first female free-verse poet.

More recent Arabic literature has seen an even greater number of female writers' works published: [[Suhayr al-Qalamawi]], [[Ulfat Idilbi|Ulfat Idlibi]], [[Layla Balabakki|Layla Ba'albakki]], [[Zuhrabi Mattummal]], [[Hoda Barakat]] and [[Alifa Rifaat]] are just some of the novelists and prose writers. There has also been a number of significant female authors who also wrote non-fiction work mainly exploring the female condition in Muslim Societies, which includes authors such as [[Zaynab al-Ghazali]], [[Nawal el-Saadawi]] and author/Sociologist [[Fatema Mernissi]].

Women writers in the Arab world have unavoidably courted controversy. [[Layla Balabakki|Layla Ba'albakki,]] for instance, was charged with obscenity and "endangering public morality" a few months after she published her collection of short stories titled ''Tenderness to the Moon'' (1963). The Lebanese vice squad actually traveled to every bookstore where the book was sold to confiscate all remaining copies because of its erotic content.

=== Contemporary Arabic Literature ===
Suffice to say although female Arab authors still risk controversy by discussing explicit themes or taboo topic in their works, it is a theme explored more explicitly and with more vigour due to greater outreach thanks to social media and more international awareness of Arab literature. More current Arab female writers include [[Hanan al-Shaykh|Hanan al-Sheikh]], [[Salwa Al Neimi|Salwa al-Neimi]] (writer, poet and journalist), [[Joumana Haddad|Joumanna Haddad]] (journalist and poet), [[Assia Djebar]]. [[Ahdaf Soueif]] and [[Yasmine El Rashidi|Yasmine El-Rashidi]] amongst others who confront less-talked about topics such as sex, prostitution, homosexuality and political censorship and prosecution within the Arab diaspora and also internationally in relation to Arab emigration.

Contemporary female Arab writers/poets/journalists alongside producing literature and non-fiction works often take on an activist role in their careers in order to highlight and improve the female condition in Arab society. This concept is embodied in female figures such as [[Mona Eltahawy]], who is an award-winning Egyptian columnist and international public speaker. She is best known for her unconventional comments on Arab and Muslim issues and her involvement in global feminism. In 2015, she released her book ''[[Headscarves and Hymens]]'' in which she argues the need for a sexual revolution in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/12/headscarves-and-hymens-why-the-middle-east-needs-a-sexual-revolution-mona-eltahawy-review|title=Headscarves and Hymens: Why the Middle East Needs a Sexual Revolution by Mona Eltahawy – review|last=Aspden|first=Rachel|date=2015-06-12|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary Arab women's literature has been strongly influenced by the diaspora of Arabic-speakers, who have produced writing not only in Arabic but also in other languages, prominently English, French, and German. The Internet is also important in furthering the reach of literature produced in Arabic or Arab regions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is among the younger generation of poets that the Internet has become a platform for mounting collections and sharing poetry. Some of these poets have their own websites, while others are included on ever growing web anthologies being posted by young Arab computer geeks dedicated to the construction of web archives for Arabic poetry and poetic history. Similarly, critical treatment of these women's poetry, while now well established in on-line resources and web-based sites for major paper publications throughout the arab world, has yet to produce clearly defined critical means of articulating emerging values for poetry, for measuring the critical worth of some of these new productions, and for encouraging the production of Arab women's poetry which will have weight, depth, and acclaim comparable to the work of some of the major Arab male poets of our day.&lt;ref&gt;Clarissa Burt, 'Arts: Poets and Poetry: Arab States', in ''Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures'', ed. by Suad Joseph (Leiden: Brill, 2003-2007), V: 77-80 (p. 80).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Literary criticism==
Early on in the Arabic literary world, there has been a culture of academic criticism. The poetry festivals of the pre-Islamic period often pitched two poets against each other in a war of verse in which one would be deemed winner by the audience. Literary criticism also grew into theology, and thus gained a more official status with Islamic study of the Qur'an. Although nothing which might be termed 'literary criticism', in the modern sense, was applied to a work held to be ''i'jaz'' or inimitable and divinely inspired, analysis was permitted. This study allowed for better understanding of the message and facilitated interpretation for practical use, all of which help the development of a critical method important for later work on other literature. A clear distinction regularly drawn between works in literary language and popular works has meant that only part of the literature in Arabic was usually considered worthy of study and criticism.

Some of the first studies of the poetry are ''Qawa'id al-shi'r'' or ''The Rules of Poetry'' by Tha'lab and ''Naqd al-shi'r'' ''Poetic Criticism'' by [[Qudamah ibn Ja'far]]. Other works tended to continue the tradition of contrasting two poets in order to determine which one best follows the rule of classical poetic structure. Plagiarism also became a significant idea exercising the critics' concerns. The works of [[al-Mutanabbi]] were particularly studied with this concern. He was considered by many the greatest of all Arab poets but his own arrogant self-regard for his abilities did not endear him to other writers and they looked for a source for his verse. Just as there were collections of facts written about many different subjects, numerous collections detailing every possible [[Figure of speech|rhetorical figure]] used in literature emerged as well as how to write guides.

Modern criticism at first compared the new works unfavourably with the classical ideals of the past but these standards were soon rejected as too artificial. The adoption of the forms of European [[romantic poetry]] dictated the introduction of corresponding critical standards. [[Taha Hussayn]], himself keen on European thought, would even dare to challenge the Qur'an with modern critical analysis in which he pointed out the ideas and stories borrowed from pre-Islamic poetry.

==Outside views of Arabic literature==
Literature in Arabic has been influential outside the Islamic world. One of the first important translations of Arabic literature was [[Robert of Ketton]]'s translation of the [[Qur'an]] in the twelfth century but it would not be until the early eighteenth century that much of Arabic's diverse literature would be recognised, largely due to [[Arabist]]s such as [[Forster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot]] and his books such as ''Arabic Authors: A Manual of Arabian History and Literature''.

[[Antoine Galland]]'s translation of the ''[[Thousand and One Nights]]'' was the first major work in Arabic which found great success outside the Muslim world. Other significant translators were [[Friedrich Rückert]] and [[Richard Francis Burton|Richard Burton]], along with many working at [[Fort William, India]]. The Arabic works and many more in other eastern languages fuelled a fascination in [[Orientalism]] within Europe. Works of dubious 'foreign' morals were particularly popular but even these were censored for content, such as homosexual references, which were not permitted in [[Victorian era|Victorian society]]. Most of the works chosen for translation helped confirm the stereotypes of the audiences with many more still untranslated. Few modern Arabic works have been translated into other languages.

However, towards the end of the twentieth century, there was an increase of translations of Arabic books into other languages, and Arabic authors began to receive acclaim. Egyptian writer [[Naguib Mahfouz]] has most if not all of his works translated after he won the 1988 [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. Several other writers, including [[Abdul Rahman Munif]] and [[Tayeb Salih]] have been taken quite seriously by Western scholars, and both [[Alaa Al Aswany]]'s ''[[The Yacoubian Building]]'' and [[Rajaa al-Sanea]]'s ''[[Girls of Riyadh]]'' attracted significant Western media attention in the first decade of the twenty-first century.

==Church==
Coachella Valley Church describes itself as an [[Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church]] which is monotheistic, worships a single God referred to as [[Jah]], and uses cannabis as a sacrament. The members, known as Coachellans, believe that the use of cannabis helps elevate people to a higher understanding of self and greater closeness to Jah—who members believe partially resides within each individual. They ritually use cannabis, which they call "God's Holy Healing Sacrament" to deepen love and [[livity]].&lt;ref&gt;http://coachellavalley.church/spirituality/&lt;/ref&gt; The church house on [[The Alameda, San Jose|The Alameda]] has an altar, pews and sacred images "like any other Christian house of worship".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|work=Christian Daily|location=Washington, DC|title=California churches suspected of being illegal marijuana dispensaries|author=Lorraine Caballero|date=November 23, 2017|url=http://www.christiandaily.com/article/california-churches-suspected-of-being-illegal-marijuana-dispensaries/61516.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and legal issues ==
The City of San Jose filed a complaint against the owners and operators of Amsterdam's Garden marijuana dispensary in May 2015 for zoning violations and for not conforming to city regulations on marijuana dispensaries. Amsterdam's Garden was reportedly owned and operated by Sacha Nemcov, who was part of a failed campaign in 2016 to allow for dispensaries all around the city. After the dispensary was shut down, Coachella Church of Cannabis, later renamed Coachella Valley Church, began operations at the same location with reportedly the same operators,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=High praise: 'Pot churches' popping up around California|publisher=[[KPCC]]|location=Pasadena|author=Barbara Feder Ostrov|date=January 12, 2018|url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2018/01/12/79693/high-praise-pot-churches-popping-up-around-califor/}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Nemcov (who also calls himself Donny Lords and Alex Nemcov, according to The San Jose Mercury News). Around November 2017, the operators stated that they were not legally a marijuana dispensary under city regulations but rather a church, and should be exempt from taxation, zoning and other regulations as a legitimate religious group under the United States [[Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act]] (RLUIPA) of 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Baum | first=Julia | title=Church claims religious exemption from local pot laws | website=The Mercury News | location=San Jose, California | date=2017-11-04 | url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/11/03/church-claims-religious-exemption-from-local-pot-laws/ | ref=harv | access-date=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city attorney of San Jose has said: "Whatever their followers want to smoke, that's not the issue. It's the distribution and sale coming from the dispensary."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=[[KTRK-TV]] (ABC 13)|location=Houston, Texas|title=Churches offer marijuana to members, feature pot-smoking Jesus in ads|date=November 21, 2017|url=http://abc13.com/religion/n-california-churches-offer-marijuana-to-members/2677310/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 the attorney said he would file an injunction to prevent cannabis sales on the church premises.

'''Communications in the [[Republic of Artsakh]]''' refers to telephone, satellite and other communication services and regulations in the [[de facto]] independent Republic of Artsakh, that is internationally recognized as [[de jure]] part of [[Azerbaijan]].

The leading Telecommunications operator of the [[Nagorno Karabakh]] is Karabakh Telecom, and the telecommunications sector was developed with Karabakh Telecom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.karabakhtelecom.com|title=Karabakh Telecom site|publisher=Karabakhtelecom.com|accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; investing millions of dollars in mobile telephony, spearheaded by a Lebanese company.

'''D. B. Cooper''' is a media [[epithet]] popularly used to refer to an unidentified man who [[aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] a [[Boeing 727]] aircraft in the [[Pacific Northwest|northwest]] [[United States]], in the airspace between [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]], and [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], on the afternoon of Wednesday, {{nowrap|November 24, 1971.&lt;ref name=hjbowlt&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vuVNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6384%2C3320413 |work=Free Lance-Star |location=(Fredericksburg, Virginia)|agency=Associated Press |last=Grossweiler |first=Ed |title=Hijacker bails out with loot |date=November 26, 1971 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbwac&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bTQVAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1933%2C1906592 |work=The Bulletin |location=(Bend, Oregon) |agency=UPI |title=Wilderness area combed for parachute skyjacker |date=November 26, 1971 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} He extorted $200,000 in ransom ({{Inflation|US|value = 200000|r=-4|fmt=eq|start_year = 1971}}) and parachuted to an uncertain fate. Despite an extensive [[manhunt (law enforcement)|manhunt]] and protracted [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] investigation, the perpetrator has never been located or identified. It remains the only unsolved case of air piracy in commercial aviation history.&lt;ref name="Gray-NYmag2007-10-21" /&gt;{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=135}}&lt;ref name="Pasternak-USNWR2000-07-24" /&gt;

Available evidence and a preponderance of expert opinion suggested from the beginning that Cooper probably did not survive his high-risk jump, but his remains were never recovered.&lt;ref name="FBI-Redux" /&gt; The FBI nevertheless maintained an active investigation for 45 years after the hijacking. Despite a case file that grew to over 60 volumes over that period,&lt;ref name="Seven1996-11-17" /&gt; no definitive conclusions have been reached regarding Cooper's true identity or whereabouts if he survived the jump. The suspect purchased his airline ticket using the [[Pseudonym|alias]] '''Dan Cooper''', but because of a news media miscommunication he became known in popular lore as "D. B. Cooper".

Numerous theories of widely varying plausibility have been proposed over the years by investigators, reporters, and amateur enthusiasts.&lt;ref name="Gray-NYmag2007-10-21" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AP2008-01-02"&gt;{{cite news

The FBI officially suspended active investigation of the case in July 2016, but the agency continues to request that any physical evidence that might emerge related to the parachutes or the ransom money be submitted for analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McNerthney|first1=Casey|title=D.B.

Cooper opened his briefcase long enough for her to glimpse eight red cylinders&lt;ref name="cylinders" /&gt; ("four on top of four") attached to wires coated with red insulation, and a large cylindrical battery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://n467us.com/Data%20Files/Logs%2006-20-2008R.pdf Transcript of Crew Communications] Retrieved February 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; After closing the briefcase, he stated his demands: $200,000 in "negotiable American currency";&lt;ref name="twenty" /&gt; four [[parachute]]s (two primary and two reserve); and a fuel truck standing by in Seattle to refuel the aircraft upon arrival.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=18}} Schaffner conveyed Cooper's instructions to the pilots in the [[cockpit]]; when she returned, Cooper was wearing dark sunglasses.&lt;ref name="Gray-NYmag2007-10-21" /&gt;

The pilot, William Scott, contacted [[Seattle–Tacoma International Airport|Seattle–Tacoma Airport]] [[air traffic control]], which in turn informed local and federal authorities. The 36 other passengers were given false information that their arrival in Seattle would be delayed because of a "minor mechanical difficulty".{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=20}} Northwest Orient's president, [[Donald Nyrop]], authorized payment of the [[ransom]] and ordered all employees to cooperate fully with the hijacker's demands.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=19}} The aircraft circled [[Puget Sound]] for approximately two hours to allow [[Seattle Police Department|Seattle police]] and the FBI sufficient time to assemble Cooper's parachutes and ransom money, and to mobilize emergency personnel.&lt;ref name="Gray-NYmag2007-10-21" /&gt;

Schaffner recalled that Cooper appeared familiar with the local [[terrain]]; at one point he remarked, "Looks like [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] down there," as the aircraft flew above it. He also correctly mentioned that [[McChord Field|McChord Air Force Base]] was only a 20-minute drive (at that time) from Seattle-Tacoma Airport. Schaffner described him as calm, polite, and well-spoken, not at all consistent with the stereotypes (enraged, hardened criminals or [[List of Cuba–United States aircraft hijackings|"take-me-to-Cuba"]] political dissidents) popularly associated with [[air piracy]] at the time. Tina Mucklow, another flight attendant, agreed. "He wasn't nervous," she told investigators. "He seemed rather nice. He was never cruel or nasty. He was thoughtful and calm all the time."&lt;ref name="Gray-NYmag2007-10-21" /&gt; He ordered a second bourbon and water, paid his drink tab (and attempted to give Schaffner the change),&lt;ref name="Gray-NYmag2007-10-21" /&gt; and offered to request meals for the flight crew during the stop in Seattle.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=22}}

FBI agents assembled the ransom money from several Seattle-area banks&amp;nbsp;– 10,000 unmarked 20-dollar bills, most with serial numbers beginning with the letter "L" indicating issuance by the [[Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco]], and most from the 1963A or 1969 series&lt;ref name = "check-six" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;– and made a [[Microform|microfilm]] photograph of each of them.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=25}} Cooper rejected the military-issue parachutes offered by McChord AFB personnel, instead demanding civilian parachutes with manually operated [[ripcord (skydiving)|ripcords]]. Seattle police obtained them from a local [[Parachuting|skydiving]] school.&lt;ref name="crime museum" /&gt;

===Passengers released===
At 5:24&amp;nbsp;p.m. PST, Cooper was informed that his demands had been met, and at 5:39&amp;nbsp;p.m. the aircraft landed at Seattle-Tacoma Airport.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=43}} It was more than an hour after sunset and Cooper instructed Scott to taxi the jet to an isolated, brightly lit section of the [[Airport apron|apron]] and close each window shade&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Mystery: D. B. Cooper |network=NBC |date=October 12, 1988 |series=[[Unsolved Mysteries]] |series-no=1 |number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the cabin to deter police [[sniper]]s. Northwest Orient's Seattle operations manager, Al Lee, approached the aircraft in street clothes to avoid the possibility that Cooper might mistake his airline uniform for that of a police officer. He delivered the cash-filled knapsack and parachutes to Mucklow via the aft stairs. Once the delivery was completed, Cooper ordered all passengers, Schaffner, and senior flight attendant Alice Hancock to leave the plane.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=28}}

During refueling, Cooper outlined his flight plan to the cockpit crew: a southeast course toward [[Mexico City]] at the minimum airspeed possible without stalling the aircraft&amp;nbsp;– approximately {{convert|100|kn|round=5}}&amp;nbsp;– at a maximum {{convert|10000|ft|adj=on}} altitude. He further specified that the [[landing gear]] remain deployed in the takeoff/landing position, the [[Flap (aeronautics)|wing flaps]] be lowered 15&amp;nbsp;degrees, and the cabin remain [[cabin pressurization|unpressurized]].&lt;ref&gt;Rothenberg and Ulvaeus, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Copilot William Rataczak informed Cooper that the aircraft's range was limited to approximately {{convert|1000|mi}} under the specified flight configuration, which meant that a second refueling would be necessary before entering [[Mexico]]. Cooper and the crew discussed options and agreed on [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], [[Nevada]], as the refueling {{nowrap|stop.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=45}}}} With the plane's rear exit door open and its staircase extended, Cooper directed the pilot to take off. Northwest's home office objected, on grounds that it was unsafe to take off with the aft staircase deployed. Cooper countered that it was indeed safe, but he would not argue the point; he would lower it once they were airborne.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|pp=33–34}}

An [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] official requested a face-to-face meeting with Cooper aboard the aircraft, which was denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Rothenberg| first1 = David |last2=Ulvaeus |first2=Marta | title = The New Earth Reader: The Best of Terra Nova | publisher = [[MIT Press]] | year= 1999 | location = [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]] | page = 4 | isbn =  978-0-262-18195-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The refueling process was delayed because of a [[vapor lock]] in the fuel tanker truck's pumping mechanism,{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=32}} and Cooper became suspicious; but he allowed a replacement tanker truck to continue the refueling—and a third after the second ran dry.&lt;ref name="Gray-NYmag2007-10-21" /&gt;

===Back in the air===
[[File:Rwr727tail.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 727]] with the aft airstair open]]
At approximately 7:40&amp;nbsp;p.m., the Boeing 727 took off with only five people onboard: Cooper, pilot Scott, flight attendant Mucklow, copilot Rataczak, and flight engineer H. E. Anderson. Two [[Convair F-106 Delta Dart|F-106]] fighter aircraft were scrambled from McChord Air Force Base and followed behind the airliner, one above it and one below, out of Cooper's view.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=36}} A [[Lockheed T-33]] trainer, diverted from an unrelated [[Air National Guard]] mission, also shadowed the 727 before running low on fuel and turning back near the Oregon–[[California]] state line.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=53}} Overall there were five planes in total trailing the hijacked plane. Not a single one of them reportedly saw him jump and none of them could pinpoint a location where he could have landed.&lt;ref&gt;https://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1846670_1846800_1846854,00.html "Top Ten Famous disappearances"&lt;/ref&gt;

After takeoff, Cooper told Mucklow to join the rest of the crew in the cockpit and remain there with the door closed. As she complied, Mucklow observed Cooper tying something around his waist. At approximately 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., a warning light flashed in the cockpit, indicating that the aft [[airstair]] apparatus had been activated. The crew's offer of assistance via the aircraft's intercom system was curtly refused. The crew soon noticed a subjective change of air pressure, indicating that the aft door was open.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=56}}

At approximately 8:13&amp;nbsp;p.m., the aircraft's tail section sustained a sudden upward movement, significant enough to require trimming to bring the plane back to level flight.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|pp=58, 66}}&lt;ref name="Braggp4"&gt;Bragg, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; At approximately 10:15&amp;nbsp;p.m., the aircraft's aft airstair was still deployed when Scott and Rataczak landed the 727 at Reno Airport. FBI agents, state troopers, sheriff's deputies, and Reno police surrounded the jet, as it had not yet been determined with certainty that Cooper was no longer aboard, but an armed search quickly confirmed his absence.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=48}}

==Investigation==
FBI agents recovered 66 unidentified latent fingerprints aboard the airliner.&lt;ref name="Pasternak-USNWR2000-07-24" /&gt; The agents also found Cooper's black clip-on tie, his tie clip and two of the four parachutes,&lt;ref name="parachutes" /&gt; one of which had been opened and two shroud (suspension) lines cut from its canopy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = F.B.I. reheats cold case | work = [[National Post]] | last = Cowan | first = James | date = January 3, 2008 | url = http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=211616 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20080121231748/http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=211616 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = January 21, 2008 | access-date = January 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities interviewed eyewitnesses in Portland, Seattle, and Reno, and all those who personally interacted with Cooper.

Local police and FBI agents immediately began questioning possible suspects. An Oregon man named D. B. Cooper who had a minor police record was one of the first [[person of interest|persons of interest]] in the case. He was contacted by Portland police on the off-chance that the hijacker had used his real name or the same alias in a previous crime. He was quickly ruled out as a suspect, but a local reporter named James Long, rushing to meet an imminent deadline, confused the eliminated suspect's name with the pseudonym used by the hijacker.&lt;ref&gt;Browning, W.

A precise search area was difficult to define, as even small differences in estimates of the aircraft's speed, or the environmental conditions along the flight path (which varied significantly by location and altitude), changed Cooper's projected landing point considerably.&lt;ref name="new" /&gt; An important variable was the length of time he remained in free fall before pulling his ripcord—if indeed he succeeded in opening a parachute at all.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=68}} Neither of the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] fighter pilots saw anything exit the airliner, either visually or on [[radar]], nor did they see a parachute open; but at night, with extremely limited visibility and cloud cover obscuring any ground lighting below, an airborne human figure clad entirely in black clothing could easily have gone undetected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = D.B.

In an experimental re-creation, Scott piloted the aircraft used in the hijacking in the same flight configuration. FBI agents, pushing a {{convert|200|lb|adj=on}} sled out of the open airstair, were able to reproduce the upward motion of the tail section described by the flight crew at 8:13&amp;nbsp;p.m. Based on this experiment, it was concluded that 8:13&amp;nbsp;p.m. was the most likely jump time.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|pp=80–81}} At that moment the aircraft was flying through a heavy rainstorm over the [[Lewis River (Washington)|Lewis River]] in southwestern Washington.&lt;ref name="new" /&gt;

Initial extrapolations placed Cooper's landing zone within an area on the southernmost outreach of [[Mount St. Helens]], a few miles southeast of [[Ariel, Washington]], near [[Lake Merwin]], an [[artificial lake]] formed by a dam on the Lewis River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = 30 years ago, D.B.

Door-to-door searches of local farmhouses were also carried out. Other search parties ran patrol boats along Lake Merwin and [[Yale Lake]], the reservoir immediately to its east.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|pp=67–68}} No trace of Cooper, nor any of the equipment presumed to have left the aircraft with him, was found.

The FBI also coordinated an aerial search, using fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters from the [[Oregon Army National Guard]], along the entire flight path (known as [[Victor airways|Victor 23]] in standard aviation terminology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aeronautical Information Manual |publisher=Federal Aviation Administration |url=http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim/chap5/aim0503.html |access-date=August 10, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721041334/http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim/Chap5/aim0503.html |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; but "Vector 23" in most Cooper {{Nowrap|literature&lt;ref name="Gray-NYmag2007-10-21" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pasternak-USNWR2000-07-24" /&gt;{{sfn|Nuttall|2010|pp=90–91}})}} from Seattle to Reno. Although numerous broken treetops and several pieces of plastic and other objects resembling parachute canopies were sighted and investigated, nothing relevant to the hijacking was found.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=71}}

Shortly after the spring thaw in early 1972, teams of FBI agents aided by some 200 [[United States Army|Army]] soldiers from [[Fort Lewis]], along with Air Force personnel, National Guardsmen, and civilian volunteers, conducted another thorough ground search of Clark and Cowlitz counties for eighteen days in March, and then an additional eighteen days in April.{{sfn|Olson|2010|p=34}} Electronic Explorations Company, a marine salvage firm, used a [[submarine]] to search the {{convert|200|ft|m|adj=on}} depths of Lake Merwin.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|pp=101–104}} Two local women stumbled upon a skeleton in an abandoned structure in Clark County; it was later identified as the remains of a female teenager who had been abducted and murdered several weeks before.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=86}} Ultimately, the search operation—arguably the most extensive, and intensive, in U.S. history—uncovered no significant material evidence related to the hijacking.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|pp=87–89}}

===Search for ransom money===
A month after the hijacking, the FBI distributed lists of the ransom serial numbers to financial institutions, [[casino]]s, race tracks, and other businesses that routinely conducted significant cash transactions, and to law enforcement agencies around the world. Northwest Orient offered a reward of 15% of the recovered money, to a maximum of $25,000. In early 1972, [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] [[John N. Mitchell]] released the serial numbers to the general public.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt; In 1972, two men used counterfeit 20-dollar bills printed with Cooper serial numbers to swindle $30,000 from a ''[[Newsweek]]'' reporter named Karl Fleming in exchange for an interview with a man they falsely claimed was the hijacker.&lt;ref&gt;[https://vault.fbi.gov/D-B-Cooper%20/D-B-Cooper-Part-1-of-7/view FBI files on Fleming case, released via Freedom of Information Act] Retrieved February 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=July 2018}}

In early 1973, with the ransom money still missing, ''[[The Oregon Journal]]'' republished the serial numbers and offered $1,000 to the first person to turn in a ransom bill to the newspaper or any FBI field office. In Seattle, the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer|Post-Intelligencer]]'' made a similar offer with a $5,000 reward. The offers remained in effect until Thanksgiving 1974, and though there were several near-matches, no genuine bills were found.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=95}} In 1975 Northwest Orient's insurer, Global Indemnity Co., complied with an order from the [[Supreme Court of Minnesota|Minnesota Supreme Court]] and paid the airline's $180,000 claim on the ransom money.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=184}}

===Later developments===
Subsequent analyses indicated that the original landing zone estimate was inaccurate: Scott, who was flying the aircraft manually because of Cooper's speed and altitude demands, later determined that his flight path was significantly farther east than initially assumed.&lt;ref name="Seven1996-11-17" /&gt; Additional data from a variety of sources—in particular [[Continental Airlines]] pilot Tom Bohan, who was flying four minutes behind Flight 305—indicated that the wind direction factored into drop zone calculations had been wrong, possibly by as much as 80 degrees.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|pp=111–113}} This and other supplemental data suggested that the actual drop zone was probably south-southeast of the original estimate, in the drainage area of the [[Washougal River]].{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|pp=114–116}}

===Investigation suspended===
On July 8, 2016, the FBI announced that it was suspending active investigation of the Cooper case, citing a need to focus its investigative resources and manpower on issues of higher and more urgent priority. Local field offices will continue to accept any legitimate physical evidence—related specifically to the parachutes or the ransom money—that may emerge in the future. The 60-volume case file compiled over the 45-year course of the investigation will be preserved for historical purposes at [[FBI headquarters]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] On the FBI website, there is currently a 28-part packet full of evidence gathered over the years. All the evidence is open to the public to read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vault.fbi.gov/D-B-Cooper%20|title=DB Cooper Vault|publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]|access-date=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/seattle/press-releases/2016/update-on-investigation-of-1971-hijacking-by-d.b.-cooper|title=Update on Investigation of 1971 Hijacking by D.B.

==Physical evidence==
The official physical description of Cooper has remained unchanged and is considered reliable. Flight attendants Schaffner and Mucklow, who spent the most time with Cooper, were interviewed on the same night in separate cities,&lt;ref name="FBI-Redux" /&gt; and gave nearly identical descriptions: {{convert|5|ft|10|in}} to {{convert|5|ft|11|in}} tall, {{convert|170|to|180|lb}}, mid-40s, with close-set piercing brown eyes and swarthy skin.&lt;ref name="enigma" /&gt;

In 1978, a placard printed with instructions for lowering the aft stairs of a 727 was found by a deer hunter near a logging road about {{convert|13|mi}} east of [[Castle Rock, Washington]], well north of Lake Merwin, but within Flight 305's basic flight path.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=108}}

In late 2007, the FBI announced that a partial [[DNA]] profile had been obtained from three organic samples found on Cooper's clip-on tie in 2001,&lt;ref name="new"&gt;{{cite web | title = D.B.

In March 2009, the FBI disclosed that Tom Kaye, a [[paleontology|paleontologist]] from the [[Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture]] in Seattle, had assembled a team of "citizen sleuths", including scientific illustrator Carol Abraczinskas and [[metallurgy|metallurgist]] Alan Stone. The group, eventually known as the Cooper Research Team,&lt;ref name="citizensleuths"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensleuths.com/|title=Home - Citizen Sleuths|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; reinvestigated important components of the case using [[GPS]], satellite imagery, and other technologies unavailable in 1971.&lt;ref name="isodbc" /&gt; Although little new information was gained regarding the buried ransom money or Cooper's landing zone, they were able to find and analyze hundreds of minute particles on Cooper's tie using [[electron microscopy]].

In November 2011, Kaye announced that particles of pure (unalloyed) [[titanium]] had also been found on the tie.

==Theories and conjectures==
[[File:Dbc.jpg|thumb|FBI sketches of Cooper, with age progression]]
Over the 45-year span of its active investigation, the FBI periodically made public some of its working hypotheses and tentative conclusions, drawn from witness testimony and the scarce physical evidence.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news| title = F.B.I.

===Suspect profiling===
Cooper appeared to be familiar with the Seattle area and may have been an Air Force veteran, based on testimony that he recognized the city of Tacoma from the air as the jet circled Puget Sound, and his accurate comment to Mucklow that McChord AFB was approximately 20&amp;nbsp;minutes' driving time from the Seattle-Tacoma Airport—a detail most civilians would not know, or comment upon.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=53}} His financial situation was very likely desperate. According to the FBI's retired chief investigator, Ralph Himmelsbach, [[extortion]]ists and other criminals who steal large amounts of money nearly always do so because they need it urgently; otherwise, the crime is not worth the considerable risk.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=96}} Alternatively, Cooper may have been "a thrill seeker" who made the jump "just to prove it could be done."{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=115}}

Agents theorized that Cooper took his alias from a popular [[Belgian comics|Belgian comic book]] series of the 1970s featuring the fictional hero [[Dan Cooper (comics)|Dan Cooper]], a [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] test pilot who took part in numerous heroic adventures, including parachuting. (One cover from the series, reproduced on the FBI web site, depicts test pilot Cooper skydiving in full paratrooper regalia.)&lt;ref name="isodbc" /&gt; Because the Dan Cooper comics were never translated into English, nor imported to the U.S., they speculated that he may have encountered them during a tour of duty in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="isodbc"&gt;{{cite news | title = In Search of D.B.

Evidence suggested that Cooper was knowledgeable about technique, aircraft, and the terrain. He demanded four parachutes to force the assumption that he might compel one or more hostages to jump with him, thus ensuring he would not be deliberately supplied with sabotaged equipment.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=44}} He chose a 727-100 aircraft because it was ideal for a bail-out escape, due not only to its aft airstair but also the high, aftward placement of all three engines, which allowed a reasonably safe jump without risk of immediate incineration by jet exhaust. It had "single-point fueling" capability, a recent innovation that allowed all tanks to be refueled rapidly through a single fuel port. It also had the ability (unusual for a commercial jet airliner) to remain in slow, low-altitude flight without stalling; and Cooper knew how to control its air speed and altitude without entering the cockpit, where he could have been overpowered by the three pilots.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=46}} In addition, Cooper was familiar with important details, such as the appropriate flap setting of 15 degrees (which was unique to that aircraft), and the typical refueling time. He knew that the aft airstair could be lowered during flight—a fact never disclosed to civilian flight crews, since there was no situation on a passenger flight that would make it necessary—and that its operation, by a single switch in the rear of the cabin, could not be overridden from the cockpit.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=136}} Some of this knowledge was virtually unique to [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] paramilitary units.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=43}}

In addition to planning his escape, Cooper retrieved the note and wore dark glasses, which indicated that he had a certain level of sophistication in avoiding the things that had aided the identification of the perpetrator of the best-known case of a ransom: the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]]. It is not clear how he could have reasonably expected to ever spend the money, [[fence (criminal)|fence]] it at a discount or otherwise profit. Although Cooper made the familiar-from-fiction demand of non-sequentially numbered small bills, mass publicity over the Lindbergh case had long made it public knowledge that even with 1930s technology, getting non-sequential bills in a ransom was no defense against the numbers being logged and used to track down a perpetrator. In the Lindbergh case, fencing what he could as hot money and being very careful with what he did personally pass, the perpetrator had been caught through the ransom money nonetheless, with identification and handwriting evidence only brought in at the trial.&lt;ref&gt;Acamstoday, The Lindbergh Case: How Bankers Helped Solve It http://www.acamstoday.org/the-lindberg-case-how-banker-helped-solve-it/&lt;/ref&gt;

Although unconscionably perilous by the high safety, training and equipment standards of [[skydiver]]s, whether Cooper's jump was virtually suicidal is a matter of dispute. The author of an overview and comparison of [[World War II]] aircrew bail-outs with Cooper's drop asserts a probability for his survival, and suggests that like copycat Martin McNally, Cooper lost the ransom during descent. The mystery of how the ransom could have been washed into Tena Bar from any Cooper jump area remains.&lt;ref&gt;Survival Probability Analysis of the D.B. Cooper Hijacking, using Historical Parachuting Data, December 1, 2014, Martin Andrade Jr, MBA, https://martinandrade.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/dbcooperfinalupdated.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Tena Bar find anomalies led one local journalist to suggest Cooper, knowing that he could never spend it, dumped the ransom.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=203}}

According to Kaye's research team, Cooper's meticulous planning may also have extended to the timing of his operation, and even his choice of attire. "The FBI searched but couldn't find anyone who disappeared that weekend," Kaye wrote, suggesting that the perpetrator may have returned to his normal occupation. "If you were planning on going 'back to work on Monday', then you would need as much time as possible to get out of the woods, find transportation and get home. The very best time for this is in front of a four-day weekend, which is the timing Dan Cooper chose for his crime." Furthermore, "if he was planning ahead, he knew he had to hitchhike out of the woods, and it is much easier to get picked up in a suit and tie than in old blue jeans."&lt;ref name = "conclusions" /&gt;

The Bureau were more skeptical, concluding that Cooper lacked crucial skydiving skills and experience. "We originally thought Cooper was an experienced jumper, perhaps even a [[paratrooper]]," said Special Agent Larry Carr, leader of the investigative team from 2006 until its dissolution in 2016. "We concluded after a few years this was simply not true. No experienced parachutist would have jumped in the pitch-black night, in the rain, with a 200-mile-an-hour wind in his face, wearing loafers and a trench coat. It was simply too risky. He also missed that his reserve 'chute was only for training, and had been sewn shut—something a skilled skydiver would have checked."&lt;ref name="isodbc" /&gt; He also failed to bring or request a helmet,{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=15}} chose to jump with the older and technically inferior of the two primary parachutes supplied to him,&lt;ref name="new" /&gt; and jumped into a {{convert|-70|°F|°C}} wind chill without proper protection against the extreme cold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper = USA Today|title=D.B.

The FBI speculated from the beginning that Cooper did not survive his jump.&lt;ref name="isodbc" /&gt; "Diving into the wilderness without a plan, without the right equipment, in such terrible conditions, he probably never even got his 'chute open," said Carr.&lt;ref name="FBI-Redux" /&gt; Even if he did land safely, agents contended that survival in the mountainous terrain at the onset of winter would have been all but impossible without an [[accomplice]] at a predetermined landing point. This would have required a precisely timed jump—necessitating, in turn, cooperation from the flight crew. There is no evidence that Cooper requested or received any such help from the crew, nor that he had any clear idea where he was when he jumped into the stormy, overcast darkness.&lt;ref name="enigma"&gt;"It's an Enigma." [http://www.jcs-group.com/enigma/crimes/cooper.html JCS-Group.com] Recovered January 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recovered bills===
The 1980 cash discovery launched several new rounds of conjecture and ultimately raised more questions than it answered. Initial statements by investigators and scientific consultants were founded on the assumption that the bundled bills washed freely into the Columbia River from one of its many connecting tributaries. An [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] [[Hydrology|hydrologist]] noted that the bills had disintegrated in a "rounded" fashion and were matted together, indicating that they had been deposited by river action, as opposed to having been deliberately buried.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=110}} That conclusion, if correct, supported the opinion that Cooper had not landed near Lake Merwin nor any tributary of the Lewis River, which feeds into the Columbia well downstream from Tina Bar. It also lent credence to supplemental speculation (see [[#Later developments|Later developments]] above) that placed the drop zone near the Washougal River, which merges with the Columbia upstream from the discovery site.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|pp=110–111}}

But the "free floating" hypothesis presented its own difficulties; it did not explain the ten bills missing from one packet, nor was there a logical reason that the three packets would have remained together after separating from the rest of the money. Physical evidence was incompatible with geologic evidence: Himmelsbach observed that free-floating bundles would have had to wash up on the bank "within a couple of years" of the hijacking; otherwise the rubber bands would have long since deteriorated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foia2.fbi.gov/cooper_d_b/cooper_d_b_part07.pdf |title=FBI Freedom of Information Act documents, part 7, p. 15 |format=PDF |access-date=April 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721035908/http://foia2.fbi.gov/cooper_d_b/cooper_d_b_part07.pdf |archivedate=July 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; an observation confirmed experimentally by the Cooper Research Team (see [[#Subsequent FBI disclosures|Subsequent FBI disclosures]] above).&lt;ref name="conclusions"&gt;[http://www.citizensleuths.com/conclusions.html ''Research Conclusions'': Cooper Research Team web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125233029/http://www.citizensleuths.com/conclusions.html |date=November 25, 2011 }}.  Retrieved August 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Geological evidence suggested that the bills arrived at Tina Bar well after 1974, the year of a Corps of Engineers [[dredging]] operation on that stretch of the river. Geologist Leonard Palmer of [[Portland State University]] found two distinct layers of sand and sediment between the clay deposited on the riverbank by the dredge and the sand layer in which the bills were buried, indicating that the bills arrived long after dredging had been completed.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=110}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Cash linked to 'D.B.

That finding, if true, favors an arrival time of less than one year after the event (based on the rubber band experiment), but does not help to explain how the bundles got to Tina Bar, nor from where they came.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citizensleuths.com/palmer-report.html ''Palmer Report'': Cooper Research Team web site].

Alternative theories were advanced. Some surmised that the money had been found at a distant location by someone (or possibly even a wild animal), carried to the riverbank, and reburied there. The sheriff of Cowlitz County proposed that Cooper accidentally dropped a few bundles on the airstair, which then blew off the aircraft and fell into the Columbia River. One local newspaper editor theorized that Cooper, knowing he could never spend the money, dumped it in the river, or buried portions of it at Tena Bar (and possibly elsewhere) himself.{{sfn|Gunther|1985|p=203}} No hypothesis offered to date satisfactorily explains all of the existing evidence.&lt;ref name = "conclusions" /&gt;

==Statute of limitations==
In 1976, discussion arose over impending expiration of the [[statute of limitations]] on the hijacking.

===Kenneth Christiansen===
&lt;!-- [[Kenneth Christiansen (D. B. Cooper suspect)]] redirects here --&gt;
In 2003, a [[Minnesota]] resident named Lyle Christiansen watched a television documentary about the Cooper hijacking and became convinced that his late brother Kenneth was Cooper.&lt;ref name="Gray-NYmag2007-10-21" /&gt; After repeated futile attempts to convince first the FBI, and then the author and film director [[Nora Ephron]] (who he hoped would make a movie about the case), he contacted a [[private investigator]] in [[New York City]]. In 2010 the detective, Skipp Porteous, published a book{{sfn|Porteous|Blevins|2010}} postulating that Christiansen was the hijacker. The following year, an episode of the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]] series ''[[Brad Meltzer's Decoded]]'' also summarized the circumstantial evidence linking Christiansen to the Cooper case.&lt;ref name=BradMeltzer&gt;{{cite episode|series=[[Brad Meltzer's Decoded]]|title=D.B. Cooper|network= [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]]|airdate=January 6, 2011|season=1|number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christiansen enlisted in the army in 1944 and was trained as a paratrooper. The war had ended by the time he was deployed in 1945, but he made occasional training jumps while stationed in [[Japan]] with [[Allied occupation of Japan|occupation forces]] in the late 1940s. After leaving the Army, he joined Northwest Orient in 1954 as a mechanic in the [[South Sea Islands|South Pacific]], and subsequently became a flight attendant, and then a [[purser]], based in Seattle.&lt;ref name="Gray-NYmag2007-10-21" /&gt; Christiansen was 45 years old at the time of the hijacking, but he was shorter (5&amp;nbsp;ft 8 in or 173&amp;nbsp;cm), thinner (150 pounds or 68&amp;nbsp;kg), and lighter complected than eyewitness descriptions.&lt;ref name="Gray-NYmag2007-10-21" /&gt; Christiansen smoked (as did the hijacker), and displayed a particular fondness for bourbon (Cooper's preferred beverage). He was also [[left-handed]]. (Evidence photos of Cooper's black tie show the tie clip applied from the left side, suggesting a left-handed wearer.)&lt;ref name="FBI-Redux" /&gt; Schaffner told a reporter that photos of Christiansen fit her memory of the hijacker's appearance more closely than those of other suspects she had been shown, but could not conclusively identify him.&lt;ref name="Gray-NYmag2007-10-21" /&gt; (Mucklow, who had the most contact with Cooper, has never granted a press interview.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tina Mucklow, D.B.

Christiansen reportedly had purchased a house with cash a few months after the hijacking. While dying of [[cancer]] in 1994, he told Lyle, "There is something you should know, but I cannot tell you." Lyle said he never pressed his brother to explain.&lt;ref name="Gray-NYmag2007-10-21" /&gt; After Christiansen's death, family members discovered gold coins and a valuable stamp collection, along with over $200,000 in bank accounts. They also found a folder of Northwest Orient news clippings which began about the time he was hired in the 1950s, and stopped just prior to the date of the hijacking, despite the fact that the hijacking was by far the most momentous news event in the airline's history. Christiansen continued to work part-time for the airline for many years after 1971, but apparently never clipped another Northwest news story.&lt;ref name="Gray-NYmag2007-10-21" /&gt;

Research by internet web sleuths would later uncover proof that Christiansen did not pay cash for the house he bought after the hijacking, but instead had a mortgage on the house and took 17 years to pay it off. The same search would also uncover proof that Christiansen had sold off almost two dozen acres of land for $17,000 per acre in the mid 90's, thus accounting for the large sum of money in his account at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://website.thedbcooperforum.com/Suspects/ | title=Suspects}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jack Coffelt===
Coffelt was a [[con man]], ex-convict, and purported government [[informant]] who claimed to have been the chauffeur and confidante of [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s last undisputed descendant, great-grandson [[Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith]]. In 1972 he began claiming he was Cooper, and attempted through an intermediary, a former cellmate named James Brown, to sell his story to a [[Hollywood]] production company. He said he landed near [[Mount Hood]], about {{convert|50|mi|km}} southeast of Ariel, injuring himself and losing the ransom money in the process. Photos of Coffelt bear a resemblance to the composite drawings, although he was in his mid-fifties in 1971. He was reportedly in Portland on the day of the hijacking, and sustained leg injuries around that time which were consistent with a skydiving mishap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Has The Mystery of D.B.

Coffelt's account was reviewed by the FBI, which concluded that it differed in significant details from information that had not been made public, and was therefore a fabrication.{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|pp=83–84}} Brown, undeterred, continued peddling the story long after Coffelt died in 1975.

===William Gossett===
Gossett was a [[Marine Corps]], Army, and [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] veteran who saw action in Korea and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. His military experience included advanced jump training and wilderness survival. After retiring from military service in 1973, he worked as an [[ROTC]] instructor, taught military law at [[Weber State University]] in [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]], [[Utah]], and hosted a radio talk show in [[Salt Lake City]] which featured discussions about the [[paranormal]].&lt;ref name="craig"&gt;Craig, John S. "D.B. Cooper Suspect Named: William Pratt Gossett," associatedcontent.com.&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 2003.&lt;ref name="yet" /&gt;

Gossett was widely known to be obsessed with the Cooper hijacking. He amassed a voluminous collection of Cooper-related news articles, and told one of his wives that he knew enough about the case to "write the epitaph for D.B. Cooper". Late in his life he reportedly told three of his sons, a retired Utah judge, and a friend in the Salt Lake City [[public defender]]'s office that he had committed the hijacking.&lt;ref name="yet"&gt;Yet Another D.

According to Galen Cook, a lawyer who has collected information related to Gossett for years, Gossett once showed his sons a key to a [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] [[safe deposit box]] which, he claimed, contained the long-missing ransom money.&lt;ref name="The Canadian PressF.B.I."&gt;{{cite news | title = U.S. lawyer believes notorious fugitive D.B.

In 1988, Gossett changed his name to "Wolfgang" and became a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] priest, which Cook and others interpreted as an effort to disguise his identity.&lt;ref name="craig" /&gt; Other circumstantial evidence includes testimony that Cook claims to have obtained from William Mitchell, a passenger on the hijacked aircraft, regarding a mysterious "physical detail" (which he will not divulge) common to the hijacker and Gossett.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, John S. "1971 D.B. Cooper Letters Linked to Suspect William Gossett," associatedcontent.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Cook also claims to have found "possible links" to Gossett in each of four letters signed by "D.B. Cooper" and mailed to three newspapers within days after the hijacking, although there is no evidence that the actual hijacker created or mailed any of the letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Letter to Gazette Checked in FBI Hunt for Skyjacker | newspaper = [[Reno Evening Gazette]] | date = November 29, 1971 | url = https://newspaperarchive.com/profile/christopher-brooks/clipnumber/23548/ | access-date = December 26, 2015}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Words in 'Skyjacker Note' to Gazette Clipped from Modesto Bee, FBI Told | newspaper = [[Reno Evening Gazette]] | date = November 30, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Gazette Receives Hijacker 'Letter' – Second in a Week | newspaper = [[Reno Evening Gazette]] | date = December 3, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Wesley Rackstraw is a retired pilot and ex-convict who served on an army helicopter crew and other units during the Vietnam War. He came to the attention of the Cooper task force in February 1978, after he was arrested in [[Iran]] and deported to the U.S. to face explosives possession and [[check kiting]] charges. Several months later, while released on [[bail]], Rackstraw attempted to fake his own death by radioing a false [[mayday]] call and telling controllers that he was bailing out of a rented plane over [[Monterey Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/07/12/d-b-cooper-investigation-focuses-on-california-off-the-books-genius-robert-rackstraw/ D.B.

=== Walter R. Reca ===
[[File:71 Walter at Home.jpg|thumb|Walter R. Reca]]
Walter R. Reca (born Walter R.

Reca gave Laurin permission in a notarized letter to share his story after he passed away in 2014, aged&amp;nbsp;80. He also allowed Laurin to tape their phone conversations about the crime over a six&amp;nbsp;week period in late 2008. In the over three&amp;nbsp;hours of recordings, Reca gave new details about the hijacking that the public had not heard before. He also confessed to his niece, Lisa Story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/today/index.ssf/2018/05/db_cooper_case_drops_another_s.html |title=D.B. Cooper case drops another surprising suspect into the spotlight |publisher=OregonLive.com |access-date=July 19, 2018 |language=en-US |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using his years of training to determine the location of the jump, Laurin concluded that D.B. Cooper landed near [[Cle Elum, Washington|Cle&amp;nbsp;Elum, Washington]].

According to written testimony, Jeff Osiadacz, a Cle&amp;nbsp;Elum, Washington native, was driving his dump truck near Cle&amp;nbsp;Elum the night of November&amp;nbsp;24, 1971, when he saw a man walking down the side of the road in the inclement weather. He assumed the man's car had broken down and was walking to get assistance. However he did not have room in his truck to pick him up. He continued toward his destination, the Teanaway Junction Café just outside of Cle&amp;nbsp;Elum. After ordering coffee, the man from the side of the road also entered the café looking like a "drowned rat", according to Osiadacz. The man sat next to him and asked if he would be able to give his friend directions if he called him on the phone. Osiadacz agreed to this and spoke with the man's friend, giving him directions to the cafe. Shortly after that, Osiadacz left for the Grange Hall to play in a band. The man offered to pay for his coffee, and the two amicably parted.

Laurin began his search for the witness, after Reca described the landscape he saw while on his way to the drop zone: two bridges, some distinct lights; and his description of the exterior and interior of the café, as well as his encounter with Osiadacz. He described Osiadacz in detail, recalling that he was wearing western gear and had a guitar case. He dubbed him "Cowboy".

Laurin consulted a map to find these particular landmarks and began making phone calls about the "Cowboy who had driven a dump truck." Laurin was put in contact with Osiadacz, who recalled meeting a man that night, described what he was wearing and what he looked like, and confirmed his identity as Reca after seeing a photo Laurin sent him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2018/05/db_cooper_lived_and_died_in_mi.html |title=D.B.

In 2016, Laurin took the information to publisher Principia Media, who consulted with Joe Koenig, a forensic linguist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.grandhaventribune.com/Local/2018/07/26/GH-residents-play-big-part-in-solving-hi-jacking-mystery|title=GH residents help solve hijacking mystery|newspaper=Grand Haven Tribune |access-date=November 29, 2018|author=Becky Vargo|date=July 26, 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He evaluated all documents, including passports, identification cards, photographs, and newspaper clippings. Koenig found no evidence of tampering or manipulation and deemed all documentation authentic and contemporaneous. After comparing Laurin's research to the available FBI records, he found no discrepancies that eliminated Reca as a suspect. He also thought it particularly significant that Osiadacz's statement of events on the night of November&amp;nbsp;24, 1971 was identical to the account that Reca made five years earlier. Koenig publicly stated at the Principia Media press conference on May&amp;nbsp;17, 2018 that he believes that Walter R. Reca was D.B.&amp;nbsp;Cooper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.king5.com/video/news/forensic-investigator-explains-why-he-believes-walter-reca-is-db-cooper/281-8131681 |title=Forensic investigator explains why he believes Walter Reca is D.B.

===Duane Weber===
Duane L. Weber was a World War II Army veteran who served time in at least six prisons from 1945 to 1968 for burglary and forgery. He was proposed as a suspect by his widow, based primarily on a deathbed confession: Three days before he died in 1995, Weber told his wife, "I am Dan Cooper." The name meant nothing to her, she said; but months later, a friend told her of its significance in the hijacking. She went to her local library to research D.B. Cooper, found [[Max Gunther]]'s book, and discovered notations in the margins in her husband's handwriting.&lt;ref name="Pasternak-USNWR2000-07-24" /&gt;

She then recalled, in retrospect, that Weber once had a nightmare during which he talked in his sleep about jumping from a plane, leaving his fingerprints on the "aft stairs".&lt;ref name="CrimeLibrary10"&gt;{{cite web | title = The D.B. Cooper Story: "I'm Dan Cooper.

Like the hijacker, Weber drank bourbon and chain smoked. Other circumstantial evidence included a 1979 trip to Seattle and the Columbia River, during which Weber took a walk alone along the river bank in the Tina Bar area; four months later Brian Ingram made his ransom cash discovery in the same area.&lt;ref name="Pasternak-USNWR2000-07-24" /&gt;

The FBI eliminated Weber as an active suspect in July 1998 when his fingerprints did not match any of those processed in the hijacked plane,&lt;ref name="CrimeLibrary10" /&gt; and no other direct evidence could be found to implicate him.&lt;ref name="Pasternak-USNWR2000-07-24" /&gt; Later, his DNA also failed to match the samples recovered from Cooper's tie,&lt;ref name="new" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN2011-08-01" /&gt; though the bureau has since conceded that they cannot be certain that the organic material on the tie came from Cooper.&lt;ref name="no match" /&gt;

===William J. Smith===
In November 2018, ''[[The Oregonian]]'' published an article that identified William J. Smith (1928-2018) as a possible suspect. The article was based on research from a U.S. Army data analyst who sent his findings to the FBI in the summer of 2018.&lt;ref&gt; New suspect in D.B.

After high school he enlisted in the Navy and volunteered for combat air crew training, citing his desire to fly. After the Navy, he worked for the Lehigh Valley Railroad, and was impacted by the Penn Central bankruptcy in 1970, the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history up until that time. The article theorized that the loss of his pension created a grudge against the corporate establishment and transportation industry. It also created a sudden need for money due to that loss of pension. In Smith’s high school yearbook, a list of alumni killed in World War II lists an Ira Daniel Cooper, possibly the source for the hijacker’s given name of “Dan Cooper.”&lt;ref&gt; New suspect in D.B.

The Oregonian article states that particles such as aluminum spiral chips found on the clip-on tie could have come from a locomotive maintenance facility. Furthermore, it states that Smith’s information about the Seattle area may have come from his close friend who was stationed at Fort Lewis during World War II. The article also noted that a website devoted to the Lehigh Valley Railroad contained a picture of Smith, and stated that “the resemblance to the wanted-poster sketches was remarkable.”&lt;ref&gt; Lehigh Valley Railroad employee pictures.

Cooper was not the first to attempt air piracy for personal gain.

===Aircraft modifications===
[[File:Db Cooper Vane.JPG|thumb|A Cooper vane in the unlocked position]]
In the wake of multiple "copycat" hijackings in 1972, the FAA required that all Boeing&amp;nbsp;727 aircraft be fitted with a device, later dubbed the "[[Cooper vane]]", that prevents lowering of the aft airstair during flight.&lt;ref name="Wu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ST"&gt;{{cite news | title = D.B.

Himmelsbach famously called Cooper a "rotten sleazy crook"{{sfn|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=116}} but his bold and adventurous crime inspired a cult following that was expressed in song, film, and literature.  Restaurants and bowling alleys in the Pacific Northwest hold regular Cooper-themed promotions and sell tourist souvenirs.  A "Cooper Day" celebration has been held at the Ariel General Store and Tavern each November since 1974 with the exception of 2015, the year its owner, Dona Elliot, died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://themountainnewswa.net/2015/11/16/death-in-the-db-cooper-family-dona-elliott/|title=Death in the DB Cooper "family" – Dona Elliott|last=brucesmith49|date=November 17, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooper has appeared in the storylines of the television series ''[[Prison Break]]'', ''[[The Blacklist (TV series)|The Blacklist]]'', ''[[NewsRadio]]'', and ''[[Numbers (TV series)|Numb3rs]]'', the 2004 film ''[[Without a Paddle]]'', and a book titled ''The Vesuvius Prophecy'', based on ''[[The 4400]]'' TV series.&lt;!-- PLEASE DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL EXAMPLES HERE; if you have a citable example, please consider adding it to the article "D.

  When Schaffner's description was relayed to the FBI command post in Portland, agents pointed out that dynamite sticks are typically brown or beige in color; the eight red cylinders were probably highway or railroad flares. But because they could not be certain, intervention could not be recommended. ({{harvnb|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|pp=40–41}})

  According to most sources, Cooper directed that the ransom be supplied in the form of 20-dollar bills; but Himmelsbach, who was present when the demands were first received, wrote that he specified only "negotiable American currency, denomination not important." ({{harvnb|Himmelsbach|Worcester|1986|p=18}}) All sources agree that the ransom was supplied in the form of 20-dollar bills.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="parachutes"&gt;
  Earl Cossey, the skydiving instructor who supplied the parachutes, told some sources that three of the four parachutes (one primary and both reserves) were returned to him. The FBI has always maintained that only two parachutes, a primary and a cannibalized reserve, were found aboard the plane. ({{harvnb|Gunther|1985|p=50}})

'''Damo''' specifically refers to class of servants during the [[Joseon Dynasty]] who were considered lower than slaves in their overall ranking within Korean society.  Their main responsibility was to serve tea to the gentries. (Damo is literally translated as "Tea Lady".)  Damos were also employed in the palace to work as attendants in various government departments.

Historical records have indicated that in certain times, Damos were used as police officers to investigate crime, mostly for [[adultery]] and other crimes involving women, where male investigators could not ask questions about the case without causing embarrassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kim|first=Hyung-eun|title=Joseon cops similar to police today|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2889370|work=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|accessdate=2013-04-02|date=5 May 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130411050929/http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2889370|archivedate=11 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were required to be " taller than 150 centimeters, be very agile, flexible, lift 40 kilograms of rice, and even withstand large quantities of alcohol without getting drunk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KOREAN TV DRAMA REVIEWS: 다모 (茶母, Damo) |url=http://twitchfilm.net/archives/005168.html |work=[[Twitch Film]] |accessdate=2013-05-24 |date=16 February 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120192126/http://twitchfilm.net/archives/005168.html |archivedate=January 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The damo carried special identification that verified their authority, and were equipped with a small iron flail that could be used to break down doors and rope to apprehend criminals. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.koreanhistory.org/%EC%A3%84%EC%99%80-%EB%B2%8C%EC%9D%98-%EC%82%AC%ED%9A%8C%EC%82%AC-%EB%AA%A9%EA%B5%AC%EB%A9%8D%EC%9D%B4-%ED%8F%AC%EB%8F%84%EC%B2%AD-%EC%A1%B0%EC%84%A0-%EA%B2%BD%EC%B0%B0-%EC%9D%B4/?ckattempt=1&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably, the damo were the first female police with arrest capabilities in the world. 

This unique institution was the main inspiration for the 2003 [[South Korea|Korean]] [[Korean drama|miniseries]] ''[[Damo (TV series)|Damo]]'', which in turn was based on Bang Hak-gi's [[manhwa]] ''Damo Nam-soon''.

'''Daryl Melham''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AM}} (born 26 November 1954) is a former [[Australia]]n politician. He was a [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] member of the [[Australian House of Representatives]] representing the [[Division of Banks]] in [[New South Wales]] from March 1990 until September 2013.

==Early life and education==
Melham was born in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], to a family of Lebanese descent and studied [[law]] and [[economics]] at the [[University of Sydney]], earning an LL.B. and a B.Ec.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansardr%2F1990-09-11%2F0054%22 |title=Daryl Melham MP, First Speech To Parliament |date=11 September 1990 |publisher=[[Parliament of Australia]] |accessdate=20 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aph"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mr Daryl Melham MP|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=4T4 |publisher=[[Parliament of Australia]] |work= Senators and Members |accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Legal career===
Melham was a barrister and solicitor and a public defender before entering politics. He was Vice-President of the New South Wales Labor Party from 1999 until 2002.

Melham worked as a solicitor with the Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales, specialising in criminal law from 1979 to 1987. He was subsequently admitted to the bar as a [[barrister]], and was a public defender until his entry into federal politics in 1990. He is also a foundation member of the NSW Society of Labor Lawyers.

Daryl Melham is a Life Member and the current President of the Revesby Workers' Club.

===Political career===
Elected to Parliament in 1990, Melham entered the Opposition Shadow Ministry following Labor's electoral defeat in 1996. He served as Shadow Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs but resigned in 2000 after a policy disagreement with the then Labor leader [[Kim Beazley]]. He returned to the Opposition Shadow Ministry in 2001 and he was Shadow Minister for Housing, Urban Development and Local Government from December 2003, resigning from the front bench soon after the Labor Party's election defeat in October 2004.

Melham and colleague [[Lindsay Tanner]] were the only Labor MPs to openly speak out against the [[Howard Government]]'s proposed [[Australian Anti-Terrorism Bill 2005|anti-terrorism legislation]] which provides for harsher punishments for [[sedition]] and grants police new [[Deadly force|shoot-to-kill]] powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/the-war-on-terrorism-goes-a-step-too-far/2005/09/14/1126377374136.html |title=The War on Terrorism goes a step too far |author=Melham, Daryl |date=15 September 2005 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=14 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Melham also spoke out against the Howard government's changes to the rules concerning [[Political donations in Australia|political donations]], which allowed donations of up to {{AUD}}10,000 to be given to political parties without public disclosure.&lt;ref name="SMH_Ramsey"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/how-red-tape-strangles-the-ballot-boxes/2007/08/31/1188067365988.html |title=How red tape strangles the ballot boxes |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=1 September 2007 | accessdate=1 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Melham was quoted as saying in May 2006:&lt;ref name="SMH_Ramsey"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"We're going to have the best politicians money can buy, but we won't see [how much]."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Melham resigned as the Federal Labor caucus chair on 30 October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Benson|first=Simon|title=PM Julia Gillard's caucus chairman Daryl Melham resigns|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/pm-julia-gillards-caucus-chairman-daryl-melham-resigns/story-e6frf7jo-1226491889365|accessdate=1 July 2013|newspaper=Herald Sun|date=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 2010 election, Melham's usually high margin in Banks was reduced to a low 1.5%. He lost the seat at the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 federal election]] against the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] candidate, [[David Coleman (Australian politician)|David Coleman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vtr.aec.gov.au/HouseDivisionFirstPrefs-17496-103.htm |title=House of Representatives: NSW: Banks |publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]] |work=Election 2013 |date=13 September 2013 |accessdate=14 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909205309/http://vtr.aec.gov.au/HouseDivisionFirstPrefs-17496-103.htm |archivedate=9 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] include population growth, [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health, economic status, religious affiliations, and other aspects of the population.

The demographic situation in Georgia, like that of some other former Soviet republics (especially [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]]), has been characterized by two prominent features since independence: decline in total population and significant "Georgianization" of the ethnic composition. The proportion of ethnic Georgians increased by full 10 percentage points between 1989 and 2002, rising from 73.7% to 83.7% of the population.&lt;ref name=EGE&gt;Richard H. Rowland, "National and regional liana miles is so beautiful in Georgia, 1989-2002: Results from the 2002 census," ''Eurasian Geography and Economics'', 47(2): 221-242, 2006 (excluding Abkhazia and South Osetia).&lt;/ref&gt;

The population grew steadily while Georgia was part of the [[Soviet Union]] and during the first years of independence, rising from less than 4 million in the 1950s to a peak of 5.5 million in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Statistical yearbooks of Georgian SSR, State Committee of Statistics, Tbilisi, various years {{ru icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Then the trend changed and the population began to decline, dropping to 4.5 million in 2005 according to the estimates by the Georgian Department of Statistics.&lt;ref name=yb2005&gt;''Statistical Yearbook of Georgia 2005'': Population, Table 2.1, p. 33, Department for Statistics, Tbilisi (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; This figure represents the total population, including the separatist regions of [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]], whose population in 2005 was estimated at 178,000 and 49,200, respectively. Without Abkhazia and South Osetia, the population in the regions controlled by the central government of Georgia was 4,321,500 in 2005 and 4,382,100 in 2008&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistics.ge/main.php?pform=47&amp;plang=1 Statistics Georgia: Population by region] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118142119/http://www.statistics.ge/main.php?pform=47&amp;plang=1 |date=2008-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (compare the 2008 figure with the CIA estimate of 4,630,841 for all of Georgia, including Abkhazia and South Osetia&lt;ref name=cia&gt;Georgia in [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gg.html CIA World Factbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114203408/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gg.html |date=2016-11-14 }} 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Georgia was named among the highest-emigration countries in the world (with respect to population) in the 2007 [[World Bank]] report. The 2002 population census in Georgia revealed a net migration loss of 1.1 million persons, or 20% of the population, since the early 90s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=14458 WB Report: Georgia Among Largest Emigration Countries]. ''[[Civil Georgia]]''. January 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The decline in Georgia's population is caused by the emigration in search of employment, and a sharp fall of birth rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/georgians_minority_in_their_own_country/2333072.html|title=Could Georgians Become A Minority In their Own Country?|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504194922/https://www.rferl.org/a/georgians_minority_in_their_own_country/2333072.html|archivedate=2018-05-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 300,000 [[Russian people|Russians]], 200,000 [[Georgian people|Georgians]], 200,000 [[Armenian people|Armenians]],  85,000 [[Greek people|Greeks]], 50,000 [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijanis]], 50,000 [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainians]] and 20,000 [[Jews]] have migrated from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] since independence.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Ethnic groups==

[[Georgians]] are the predominant ethnic group in Georgia, according to the 2014 census 86.8% of the population. The proportion in 2014 was much higher than in preceding censuses as in 2014 (most parts of) [[Abkhazia]] and (most parts of) [[South Ossetia]] were not under government control and therefore not included. As a result of this the proportion of [[Ossetians]] and [[Abkhazians]] was very low (0.4% and 0.3%, respectively).

== Ethnicity and languages ==
The demonym for the people of Mongolia is ''Mongolian''. The name ''Mongol'' usually accounts for people of the [[Mongols|Mongol ethnic group]], thus excluding Turkic groups such as [[Kazakhs]] and [[Tuvans]].

Ethnic [[Mongols]] account for about 97% of the population and consist of [[Khalka Mongols|Khalkh]] and other groups, all distinguished primarily by dialects of the [[Mongolian language]]. The Khalkhs make up 86% of the ethnic Mongol population. The remaining 14% include [[Oirats]], [[Buryats]] and others. Ethnic distinctions among the Mongol subgroups are relatively minor.  Language or tribal differences are not a political or social issue.

Significant ethnic [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] speaker [[Kazakhs]] constitute 3.9% of Mongolia's population. [[Khotons]] and [[Uzbeks|Chantuu]] are Mongolized people with Turkic origin and speak in Mongolian.

In around 1860, part of the [[Middle jüz]] Kazakhs who sought refuge from [[Qing Empire]] massacre in [[Xinjiang]] came to Mongolia and were allowed to settle down in [[Bayan-Ölgii Province]]. There are smaller numbers of [[Russians|Russian]], [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], [[Koreans|Korean]] and [[Americans|American]] people working in Mongolia, since 1990.

[[English language|English]] is the most widely used foreign language followed by [[Russian language|Russian]]. Lately, [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[German language|German]] are gaining popularity.

===Literacy===
Literacy rate is the percentage of people over the age of 15 who can read and write.

''Total population:'' 98.3%&lt;ref name="Census2010"&gt;[http://www.toollogo2010.mn/doc/Main%20results_20110615_to%20EZBH_for%20print.pdf National Census 2010 Preliminary results] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915000000/http://www.toollogo2010.mn/doc/Main%20results_20110615_to%20EZBH_for%20print.pdf |date=September 15, 2011 }} (in Mongolian])&lt;/ref&gt;

After a decline in enrollment ratios during the transition to a market economy in the 1990s, school attendance is now once more near-universal: primary school attendance rate is estimated at 97%, and adult [[literacy]] at 98%.&lt;ref&gt;For the 2000-2006 and 2000-2005 periods, respectively.

== Religions ==
{{Main|Religion in Mongolia}}
[[Image:Enfant de Mongolie.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A young Mongolian boy]]
Various forms of [[Shamanism]] have been widely practiced throughout the history of what is now Mongolia, as such beliefs were common among nomadic people in Asian history. Such beliefs gradually gave way to Tibetan Buddhism, but shamanism has left a mark on Mongolian religious culture, and continues to be practiced.

Traditionally, [[Tibetan Buddhism]] was the predominant religion. However, it was suppressed under the communist regime until 1990, with only one showcase monastery allowed to remain. Since 1990, as liberalization began, Buddhism has encountered a resurgence.

== Urbanization ==
Life in sparsely populated [[Mongolia]] has become more urbanized. Nearly half of the people live in the capital, [[Ulaanbaatar]], and in other provincial centers. Semi nomadic life still predominates in the countryside, but settled agricultural communities are becoming more common. Mongolia's population growth rate is estimated at 1.54% (2000 census). About two-thirds of the total population is under age 30, 36% of whom are under 14.

Key: For population growth 1979 - 2008

* Salmon cells indicate that the population has declined or experienced minimal (&lt;1%) growth.
* Light green cells indicate a growth between 1-2%.
* Dark green cells indicate a growth of greater than or equal to 2%.

The '''eBF conference''' is a three-day event that takes place every year in [[Ostrava]], [[Czech Republic]]. It's the largest European conference focusing on the [[e-enabling]] of the procurement process and [[Eauction]]s. It's structured as an international meeting of procurement professionals from both the public and corporate sectors who, through seminars, workshops, and presentations, share experience, information, and knowledge from the worlds of [[E-procurement|eProcurement]] and [[Esourcing]].&lt;ref&gt;OTÝS, Karel.

The conference first took place in [[Ostrava]] in 2005 when it was a one-day single-topic event. Over the years it has developed and offers participants dozens of programme topics. In 2015 it took place for the 11th time and attracted approximately 400 participants. It features a number of presentation and workshop spaces with specialists from public organisations and the corporate sector, and also experts from several European universities. All of the presenters offer a comparison of trends in procurement using eAuctions and other electronic procurement tools that are used in both the [[Public sector|public]] and [[Private sector|private]] sector throughout the EU.&lt;ref&gt;

== Points of interest ==
For several years the conference has been held under the auspices of the Mayor of Ostrava and organised by the Ostrava company [[NAR marketing]]. The conference is attended by procurement managers, procurement specialists, financial managers, medical equipment suppliers, representatives from cities, municipalities and authorities who are responsible for public procurement, and many more. One of the biggest attractions of eBF is the participation of foreign guests from multinationals such as [[RWE]], Google, and [[Siemens]]. The conference organisers are rebranding it as a festival of the e-enabling of public and corporate procurement, which means that the programme takes place in five spaces concurrently and includes more than 75 speakers. The conference opens with an exhibition where works of art created by the organisers, speakers, and other participants are exhibited. The conference also features the announcement of the winners of the international [[Esourcing]] FSA ([[Fair Sourcing Awards]]) competition. Prizes are awarded to representatives of municipalities and companies, and to individuals who have contributed to the development of eAuctions.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''European Union Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade Action Plan''' (or '''EU FLEGT Action Plan''') is a [[European Union]] initiative to address [[illegal logging]] and the social, economic and environmental harm it causes. The EU adopted the Action Plan in 2003. The plan includes activities in the EU and in tropical countries that export timber and timber products to the EU. These measures include a regulation that prohibits EU businesses from importing or trading illegal timber, and bilateral trade agreements with timber-exporting countries. Much of the FLEGT Action Plan focuses on promoting trade in legal timber products and creating disincentives for trade in illegal products. However, the Action Plan's measures go further by addressing aspects of poor [[governance]] that enable illegal logging to persist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52003DC0251|title = EU Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade Action Plan|year = 2003|accessdate = 30 July 2015|website = |publisher = European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measures==
The EU FLEGT Action Plan envisages action in seven areas:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euflegt.efi.int/vpas-and-the-eu-flegt-action-plan EU FLEGT Facility. VPA Unpacked: VPAs and the FLEGT Action Plan]. Retrieved 16 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Promoting legal trade
* Support to timber-exporting countries
* Financing and investment safeguards
* Support to private-sector initiatives
* Public procurement policies
* Action to address conflict timber

==Progress==

===EU Timber Regulation===
{{main|EU Timber Regulation}}
As envisaged in the EU FLEGT Action Plan, in 2003, the EU adopted new legislation called the EU Timber Regulation. The regulation requires timber importers and traders in the EU to trade only in legal timber and adopt [[due diligence]] procedures to ensure their supply chains are legal. It requires EU member states to have legislation, procedures and penalties in place to enforce the regulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/forests/timber_regulation.htm European Commission. EU Timber Regulation]. Retrieved 20 September 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; By July 2015, 24 of the 28 [[EU member states]] had implemented the EU Timber Regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ec.europa.eu/environment/forests/pdf/EUTR%20implementation%20scoreboard.pdf|title = State of implementation of EU Timber Regulation in 28 Member State|year = 2015|accessdate = 10 October 2015|website = |publisher = European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EC has issued pre-infringement notices against the remaining four countries ([[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]] and Spain).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.blog.clientearth.org/eutr-infringement-procedures-launched-eu-commission/|title = Commission takes action to strengthen EU illegal logging law|year = 2015|accessdate = 31 July 2015|website = |publisher = ClientEarth|last = de Rouvre|first = Diane}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 October 2015, [[WWF (conservation organization)|WWF]] filed a complaint at the Federal Forest Office in Vienna against Austrian company [[Holzindustrie Schweighofer]] for alleged violations of the European Union Timber Regulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eia-global.org/news-media/eia-report-shows-holzindustrie-schweighofers-illegal-activities-wwf-submits EIA Report Shows Holzindustrie Schweighofer’s Illegal Activities, WWF Submits EUTR Complaint.

===Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPAs)===
{{main|Voluntary Partnership Agreement}}
Under the FLEGT Action Plan, in 2005, the EU adopted the FLEGT Regulation. The FLEGT Regulation empowers the [[European Commission]] to negotiate bilateral trade deals called [[Voluntary Partnership Agreements]] with timber-exporting countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ec.europa.eu/environment/forests/flegt.htm|title = FLEGT Voluntary Partnership Agreements|year = 2015|accessdate = 1 August 2015|website = |publisher = European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under a VPA, the partner country agrees to export only legal timber products to the EU, while the EU agrees to give verified legal ('FLEGT-licensed) timber products automatic access to the EU market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.euflegt.efi.int/documents/10180/28299/FLEGT+Briefing+Notes+6+-+Voluntary+Partnership+Agreements/a10165b0-5bef-4e39-8f2a-fda2b1ceb6d5|title = FLEGT Briefing Notes. No. 6. Voluntary Partnership Agreements.|year = 2007|website = |publisher = European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; VPAs are also intended to strengthen forest governance in timber-exporting countries by improving transparency, accountability and stakeholder participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.euflegt.efi.int/how-a-vpa-promotes-good-forest-governance|title = How a VPA promotes good forest governance|year = 2015|accessdate = 25 July 2015|website = VPA Unpacked|publisher = EU FLEGT Facility}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core of each VPA is the description of a timber legality assurance system the partner country will implement to verify the legality of timber products and issue verified legal products with a FLEGT licence.

As of June 2015, six countries were implementing VPAs they have ratified with the EU ([[Cameroon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:22011A0406(02)|title = Cameroon-EU FLEGT Voluntary Partnership Agreement|year = 2011|accessdate = 23 October 2015|website = |publisher = European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Central African Republic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ec.europa.eu/world/agreements/prepareCreateTreatiesWorkspace/treatiesGeneralData.do?step=0&amp;redirect=true&amp;treatyId=9341|title = Central African Republic-EU Voluntary Partnership Agreement|year = 2012|accessdate = 1 October 2015|website = |publisher = European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ghana]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:22010A0319(01)|title = Ghana-EU Voluntary Partnership Agreement|year = 2010|website = |publisher = European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liberia]] [[Indonesia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.150.01.0252.01.ENG|title = Indonesia-EU Voluntary Partnership Agreement|year = 2014|website = |publisher = European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Republic of the Congo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:22011A0406(03)|title = Republic of the Congo-EU Voluntary Partnership Agreement|year = 2013|website = |publisher = European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and nine more countries were negotiating Voluntary Partnership Agreements with the EU ([[Ivory Coast|Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Gabon]], [[Guyana]], [[Honduras]], [[Laos]], [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flegtweek.org/report-information-sessions Juppi, M. &amp; Tagliaferri, M. 2015.

FLEGT Week 2014 Report: Information sessions on FLEGT progress and achievements]. Retrieved 16 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 21 April 2016, the presidents of Indonesia, the European Commission and the European Council confirmed that Indonesia had met the final major requirement of its VPA and was on course to become the world's first country to issue 'FLEGT' licences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/pdf/21_04_2016_en.pdf European Commission. 2016. Environment: EU and Indonesia to start first-ever licensing scheme for legal timber exports. Press release, 21 April 2016]. Retrieved 21 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; As of 15 November 2016, Indonesia is issuing these licences, i.e. only timber that is FLEGT licensed can enter the EU.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flegtlicence.org/flegt-licences-from-indonesia FLEGT licences from Indonesia&lt;/ref&gt;  Among other VPA partner countries, Ghana is also in an advanced stage of implementing its timber legality assurance system ahead of FLEGT licensing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euflegt.efi.int/publications/eu-flegt-facility-highlights-and-insights-from-2015 EU FLEGT Facility. 2016. Annual report. EU FLEGT Facility: Highlights and insights from 2015.]. Retrieved 21 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perspectives==
Critics of the FLEGT Action Plan point out that no FLEGT-licensed timber has yet arrived in the EU and that some EU member states have not yet fully implemented the EU Timber Regulation. Supporters of the FLEGT Action Plan say the time taken to deliver FLEGT licences indicates the rigour and credibility of the process. For instance, Saskia Ozinga of the campaigning organisation [[FERN]] described the FLEGT Action Plan as "the EU's best-ever policy on tropical forests, since it's the first scheme of its kind to address the root causes of illegal logging", and gave evidence of improved governance in Ghana, Liberia and Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.trust.org/item/20150203095445-0t1r6/|title = EU scheme to protect tropical forests should not be scrapped|date = 3 February 2015|accessdate = 5 April 2015|website = |last = Ozinga|first = Saskia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anand Punja of the UK [[Timber Trade Federation]] said the Action Plan "has strongly help create a fairer and more partnership approach to sourcing than before. UK Importers are now much more likely to invest in their supply chains and work in partnership to help their suppliers, some of whom are smaller businesses, to put into place the right procedures and practices to ensure a better approach to forest and timber supply chain management."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.trust.org/item/20150203095445-0t1r6/#comment-1858361407|title = Comment in reaction to article by Saskia Ozinga|year = 2015|accessdate = 21 October 2015|website = |last = Punja|first = Anand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timber trade analyst Rupert Oliver said: "From what I've seen of FLEGT processes in Ghana, Liberia and Indonesia, they have succeeded in bringing groups together who for decades have been at loggerheads and including those who were excluded in the past. There is a strong sense of progress and direction which has often been lacking in other policy initiatives. More importantly they are succeeding in building consensus on key issues in the forest sector beyond what has actually been achieved in many industrialised nations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.trust.org/item/20150203095445-0t1r6/#comment-1832886572|title = Comment in reply to article by Saskia Ozinga|year = 2015|accessdate = 22 October 2015|website = |last = Oliver|first = Rupert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== European Court of Auditors report ==
On 22 October 2015, the [[European Court of Auditors]] issued a report that was critical of the European Commission's management of the FLEGT Action Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.eca.europa.eu/en/Pages/DocItem.aspx?did=33292|title = Special Report No 13/2015: EU support to timber‑producing countries under the FLEGT action plan|year = 2015|accessdate = 22 October 2015|website = |publisher = European Court of Auditors}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report included a detailed response and rebuttal from the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.eca.europa.eu/Lists/ECADocuments/SR15_13/SR_FLEGT_EN.pdf|title = Reply of the Commission. pp 34–45 in EU support to timber‑producing countries under the FLEGT action plan. Special Report 13. European Court of Auditors.|year = 2015|accessdate = 23 October 2015|website = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Independent evaluation of the EU FLEGT Action Plan ==
In July 2014, the [[European Commission]] initiated an independent evaluation of the implementation of the EU FLEGT Action Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.flegt-evaluation.org/the-evaluation/|title = EU FLEGT Action Plan Evaluation|website = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The evaluation team was formed by independent experts from the TEREA – Terre Environnement Aménagement consultancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.flegt-evaluation.org/the-team/|title = FLEGT Action Plan evaluation: the team|website = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report of the independent evaluation, published on 4 May 2016, confirmed that the EU FLEGT Action Plan is a relevant and innovative response to the challenge of illegal logging and that the Action Plan had improved forest governance in all target countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.flegt.org/evaluation/|title = EU FLEGT Action Plan is working, says independent evaluation|website = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related initiatives ==
Since the EU adopted the FLEGT Action Plan, other markets have taken steps to prevent trade in illegal timber products. These include: 
* In the United States, the [[Lacey Act of 1900|2008 amendment to the Lacey Act]]
* In Australia, the Illegal Logging Prohibition Act of 2014

The '''Food and Agriculture Policy Decision Analysis''' (FAPDA) initiative, led by the [[Food and agriculture organization of the United Nations|Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nation]]'s Agricultural Development Economics Division, aims at promoting evidence-based decision making.&lt;ref&gt;Food and Agriculture Policy Decision Analysis http://www.fao.org/in-action/fapda/background/who-we-are/en/ accessed Nov. 2016&lt;/ref&gt; FAPDA collects and disseminates information on food and [[agriculture]] [[policy]] decisions through a freely accessible web-based tool.&lt;ref&gt;FAPDA web-based tool http://www.fao.org/in-action/fapda/tool/#main.html&lt;/ref&gt; It has been gathering information since 2008 from more than 80 countries. Between 2008 and 2016, more than 9000 policy decisions have been gathered on this web-based tool, which allows for policy trend identification and the analysis. At the country level, FAPDA focuses on developing information on policy trends and stability indicators for more transparent and effective policy-making.

Users can directly access and retrieve information by [[country]] or [[region]], date and policy category. [[Ad hoc]] reports can also be produced on selected countries, type of policy or specific topic. They classify policies based on the [http://www.fao.org/in-action/fapda/background/policy-classification/en/ Food and Agriculture Policy Classification] that uses three categories: producer-oriented, consumer-oriented, and trade-oriented and [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] policies, each with their own sub-categories.&lt;ref&gt;FAO. Policy Classification of FAPDA. http://www.fao.org/in-action/fapda/background/policy-classification/en/&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, the tool was updated to include information on policy frameworks as well. Policy frameworks in the tool are classified according to the following broad categories: national socio-economic development, [[food security]] and [[nutrition]], [[agriculture]] and [[rural development]], social protection, [[natural resource]]s, [[trade]] and [[markets]], disaster risk reduction and management, and [[gender]].&lt;ref&gt;FAPDA web-based tool http://www.fao.org/in-action/fapda/web-based-tool/en/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Formosan languages''' are the languages of the [[Taiwanese aborigines|indigenous peoples of Taiwan]], all of which are [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]]. The Taiwanese aborigines recognized by the government are about 2.3% of the island's population. However, far fewer can still speak their ancestral language because of centuries of [[language shift]]. Of the approximately 26 languages of the Taiwanese aborigines, at least ten are [[extinct language|extinct]], another four (perhaps five) are [[endangered language|moribund]],&lt;ref name="zeit"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zeitoun|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Yu|first2=Ching-Hua |title=The Formosan Language Archive: Linguistic Analysis and Language Processing |journal=International Journal of Computational Linguistics and Chinese Language Processing |date=1 July 2005 |volume=10|issue=2 |url=http://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/alDetailedMesh?DocID=1027376x-200507-10-2-167-199-a#Summary |pages=167–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Li|first1=Paul Jen-kuei|last2=Tsuchida|first2=Shigeru|title=Kavalan Dictionary |language=English,Chinese |date=2006|publisher=Institute of Linguistics, Academia Sinica|location=Taipei|isbn=9789860069938|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several others are to some degree [[endangered language|endangered]].

The aboriginal languages of [[Taiwan]] have significance in [[historical linguistics]] since in all likelihood, Taiwan was the [[Austronesian languages#Homeland|place of origin]] of the entire [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language]] family. According to linguist [[Robert Blust]], the Formosan languages form nine of the ten principal branches of the Austronesian language family,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blust |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Blust |date=1999 |title=Subgrouping, circularity and extinction: some issues in Austronesian comparative linguistics |editor1-last=Zeitoun |editor1-first=Elizabeth |editor2-last=Li |editor2-first=Jen-kuei |journal=Selected papers from the Eighth International Conference on Austronesian Linguistics |publisher=Academia Sinica |location=Taipei |isbn=9789576716324 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the one remaining principal branch contains nearly 1,200 [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]] found outside Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diamond|first1=Jared M.|title=Taiwan's gift to the world|journal=Nature|date=17 February 2000|volume=403|issue=6771|pages=709–710|doi=10.1038/35001685|pmid=10693781}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some other linguists disagree with some details of Blust's analysis, a broad consensus has coalesced around the conclusion that the Austronesian languages originated in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Fox|first1=James|title=Current Developments in Comparative Austronesian Studies|journal=ANU Research Publications |conference=Symposium Austronesia, Pascasarjana Linguististik dan Kajian Budaya Universitas Udayana |place=Bali |date=19–20 August 2004 |url=https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/43158|oclc=677432806}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory has been strengthened by recent studies in human population genetics, supporting also the matrilineal nature of the migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trejaut|first1=Jean A|last2=Kivisild|first2=Toomas|last3=Loo|first3=Jun Hun|last4=Lee|first4=Chien Liang|last5=He|first5=Chun Lin|last6=Hsu|first6=Chia Jung|last7=Li|first7=Zheng Yuan|last8=Lin|first8=Marie|last9=Penny|first9=David|title=Traces of Archaic Mitochondrial Lineages Persist in Austronesian-Speaking Formosan Populations|journal=PLoS Biology|date=5 July 2005|volume=3|issue=8|pages=e247|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030247|pmid=15984912|pmc=1166350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Based on recent archaeological evidence as well as linguistic evidence, [[Roger Blench]] (2014)&lt;ref&gt;Blench, Roger. 2014. ''[https://www.academia.edu/9261653/Suppose_we_are_wrong_about_the_Austronesian_settlement_of_Taiwan Suppose we are wrong about the Austronesian settlement of Taiwan?]'' m.s.&lt;/ref&gt; considers the Austronesians in Taiwan to have been a [[melting pot]] of immigrants from various parts of the coast of eastern China that had been migrating to Taiwan by 4,000 B.P. These immigrants included people from the [[foxtail millet]]-cultivating [[Longshan culture]] of [[Shandong]] (with Longshan-type cultures found in southern Taiwan), the fishing-based [[Dapenkeng culture]] of coastal [[Fujian]], and the [[Yuanshan culture]] of northernmost Taiwan which Blench suggests may have originated from the coast of [[Guangdong]]. Based on geography and cultural vocabulary, Blench believes that the Yuanshan people may have spoken [[East Formosan languages|Northeast Formosan languages]]. Thus, Blench believes that there is in fact no "apical" ancestor of Austronesian in the sense that there was no true single [[Proto-Austronesian language]] that gave rise to present-day Austronesian languages. Instead, multiple migrations of various pre-Austronesian peoples and languages from the Chinese mainland that were related but distinct came together to form what we now know as Austronesian in Taiwan. Hence, Blench considers the single-migration model to be inconsistent with both the archaeological and linguistic (lexical) evidence.

==Recent history==
{{main|Taiwanese indigenous peoples}}
All Formosan languages are slowly being replaced by the culturally dominant [[Taiwanese Mandarin]]. In recent decades the [[Taiwan]]ese government started an aboriginal reappreciation program that included the reintroduction of Formosan [[first language]] in Taiwanese schools. However, the results of this initiative have been disappointing.&lt;ref&gt;Huteson, Greg. (2003).  [http://www.sil.org/silesr/2003/silesr2003-012.pdf  ''Sociolinguistic survey  report for the Tona and Maga dialects of the Rukai  Language.'']  SIL Electronic Survey Reports  2003-012, Dallas, TX: SIL International.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, in order to preserve the language of the indigenous people of Taiwan, the council established a Romanized writing system for all Taiwan's aboriginal languages. The council has also helped with classes and language certification programs for members of the indigenous community and the [[Han Chinese]] to help the conservation movement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.galdu.org/web/?odas=4584&amp;giella1=eng&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
{{Main|Austronesian languages#Classification}}
Formosan languages form nine distinct branches of the Austronesian language family (with all other Malayo-Polynesian languages forming the tenth branch of the [[Austronesian]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blust|first1=Robert|title=The Austronesian languages: Revised Edition|journal=Asia-Pacific Linguistics|date=2013|volume=8|pages=30–31|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1885/10191|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of languages==
It is often difficult to decide where to draw the boundary between a language and a dialect, causing some minor disagreement among scholars regarding the inventory of Formosan languages. There is even more uncertainty regarding possible extinct or [[cultural assimilation|assimilated]] Formosan peoples. Frequently cited examples of Formosan languages are given below&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite book | author = 徐中文 | title = 原住民族語言書寫系統建議修正版本報告 | publisher = 原住民族語言研究發展中心 | date = 2018 | url = http://ilrdc.tw/achievement/106_write/pdf/106%E5%B9%B4%E5%8E%9F%E4%BD%8F%E6%B0%91%E6%97%8F%E8%AA%9E%E8%A8%80%E6%9B%B8%E5%AF%AB%E7%AC%A6%E8%99%9F%E7%B3%BB%E7%B5%B1%E5%BB%BA%E8%AD%B0%E4%BF%AE%E6%AD%A3%E7%89%88%E6%9C%AC%E5%A0%B1%E5%91%8A-%E7%B6%B2%E8%B7%AF%E7%89%88.pdf}} &lt;/ref&gt;, but the list should not be considered exhaustive.

==Basic word order==
Most Formosan languages display verb-initial word order (VSO (verb-subject-object) or VOS (verb-object-subject)) with the exception of some [[Northern Formosan languages]], such as [[Thao language|Thao]], [[Saisiyat language|Saisiyat]], and [[Pazih language|Pazih]], possibly from influence from Chinese.

Li (1998) lists the [[word order]]s of several Formosan languages.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Paul Jen-kuei. 1998. "台灣南島語言 [The Austronesian Languages of Taiwan]." In Li, Paul Jen-kuei. 2004. Selected Papers on Formosan Languages. Taipei, Taiwan: Institute of Linguistics, Academia Sinica.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sound changes==
Tanan [[Rukai language|Rukai]] is the Formosan language with the largest number of phonemes with 23 consonants and 4 vowels containing length contrast, while [[Kanakanabu language|Kanakanabu]] and [[Saaroa language|Saaroa]] have the least number of phonemes with 13 consonants and 4 vowels (Blust 2009:165).

'''Harley Street''' is a street in [[Marylebone]], [[central London]], which has been noted since the 19th century for its large number of private [[Specialty (medicine)|specialists]] in [[medicine]] and [[surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marylebonevillage.com/marylebone-journal/street-stories---harley-street|title=Street stories - Harley Street|website=www.marylebonevillage.com|access-date=2017-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named after [[Thomas Harley]] who was [[Lord Mayor of London]] in 1767.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ledbury &amp; District U3A Local History Group|url=http://www.malverngazette.co.uk/news/14844101.Ledbury___District_U3A_Local_History_Group/|accessdate=6 November 2016|publisher=Malvern Gazette|date=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Since the 19th century, the number of doctors, hospitals, and medical organizations in and around Harley Street has greatly increased. Records show that there were around 20 doctors in 1860, 80 by 1900, and almost 200 by 1914. When the [[National Health Service]] was established in 1948, there were around 1,500. Today, there are more than 3,000 people employed in the Harley Street area, in clinics, medical and paramedical practices, and hospitals such as The Harley Street Clinic, Medical Express Clinic, Harley Street Fertility Clinic, [https://www.sonoworld.co.uk Sonoworld Diagnostic Services,]  [[London Women's Clinic|The London Women's Clinic]] and [[The London Clinic]].&lt;ref name=hsguide&gt;''[http://www.harleystreetguide.co.uk/about/history/ History of Harley Street]'' at Harley Street Guide (commercial website)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alisha|first1=Ali|title=Psychological Therapy in London|url=http://theprivatetherapyclinic.co.uk/psychological-therapy/|publisher=The Private Therapy Clinic|accessdate=19 September 2016|location=London|page=7-8|language=English|date=14 July 2013|quote=Counselling Approaches}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.londonwomensclinic.com/|title=IVF Clinics {{!}} Fertility Clinics {{!}} The London Women's Clinic London|website=www.londonwomensclinic.com|access-date=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been speculated that doctors were originally attracted to the area by the development of commodious housing and central proximity to the important railway stations of [[London Paddington station|Paddington]], [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]], [[St Pancras railway station|St Pancras]], [[Euston railway station|Euston]] and, later, [[Marylebone]]. The nearest [[London Underground|Tube]] stations are [[Regent's Park tube station|Regent's Park]] and [[Oxford Circus tube station|Oxford Circus]].

'''&lt;big&gt;Fictional References&lt;/big&gt;'''

In [[Agatha Christie]]’s [[The Secret of Chimneys]] (1925), Lord Caterham ruefully mentions that his doctor advised him to “avoid all worry. So easy for a man sitting in his consulting room in Harley Street to say that.” Earlier in the book, a surgeon in Harley Street is mentioned among names listed in a phone book.

In [[Agatha Christie]]’s ''[[Crooked House]]'' (1949), Edith de Haviland visits Harley Street.

In [[Jane Austen]]'s [[Sense and Sensibility]] (1813), the Dashwood sisters, Lucy Steele, Mrs Jennings, Edward Ferrars, and others spend some of their free time there while in London.

The '''Indian Institute of Sindhology''' (I.I.S.) is a center for advanced studies and research in the fields related to [[Sindhi language]], literature, education, art and culture. Its primary aim is to preserve and promote the [[cultural heritage]] of [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]] Community and ensure its continuity by disseminating it in the younger generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protecting Sindhi culture|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/education/protecting-sindhi-culture/article8008314.ece|website=The Hindu|language=en-IN|date=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Connections: The earlier, better Advanis|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1039823|accessdate=1 July 2016|agency=[[Dawn (newspaper)|DAWN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization is already in the realm of dissemination of the old tenures of the Sindhi Cultural ethos. It has its own active school which operates in a separate wing of the organization's building. Plus to keep a record of the Sindhi Language there are notable books of yesteryear as well a host of audio recordings that the team at the organization has been assembling from different parts of India. The in-house library that acts up as a museum also; looks to play that much vital role in fulfilling the expectations that the organization had its genesis in.

The library in Indian Institute of Sindhology holds thousands of Sindhi Books, many of them are rare ones, on various topics. All the Sindhi magazines published in India and abroad are also displayed and collected there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Report 2007-08|url=http://ncpsl.gov.in/writereaddata/mainlinkfile/File66.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph "Joe" Edward Humphreys''' (October 17, 1872-July 10, 1936) was an American boxing official and announcer. He was one of the most popular fight announcers from the turn of the 20th century up until the 1930s. In his near 50-year career, Humphreys was estimated to have announced over 20,000 boxing matches and officiated many of the top prize fights of the era as the longtime official ring announcer at the old [[Madison Square Garden]] from 1925 up to his death in 1936.

==Biography==
Joseph Edward Humphreys was born in [[New York City]] on October 17, 1872. He grew up at 54 Oliver Street in the [[Lower East Side]], not far from the birthplace of future [[Governor of New York]] [[Alfred E. Smith]], and who later was a childhood friend. His father died when he was 11 years old and became a [[Newspaper hawker|newsboy]] to help support his family. During his years as a newsboy, he was known as a "lusty-lunged youngster" whose voice led him to obtain a position at the [[New York Produce Exchange]] as a broker's page. To make some extra money, Humphreys also began singing in clubs, smokers and benefits. At age 15, he was a bartender and later became a mascot of the old Nonpareil Athletic Club where he was originally introduced to boxing. It was while performing at Gus Maisch's ''Little Casino'' in 1888, a popular establishment near New Bowery, that he agreed to be a last minute replacement as the night's official ring announcer when the regular man was unable to appear. Humphreys became an instant success and became a full-time announcer.&lt;ref name="Article"&gt;"Joe Humphreys, 63, Sports Figure, Dies; Boxing Announcer 43 Years, He Officiated at Famous Championship Fights. Began Work As Newsboy; Boyhood Chum of Ex-Gov. Smith, He Was Singer Before Voice Won Him Chance in Ring". &lt;u&gt;New York Times.&lt;/u&gt; 11 July 1936&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the early 20th century, Humphreys had become the single most popular boxing announcer in the New York-area. Harry Grayson, boxing writer for the ''[[New York World-Telegram]]'' once wrote, "Joe Humphreys had voice, presence, personality, tact, and razorblade Irish wit". He was particularly known for his distinctive and colorful announcing style, mannerisms and catchphrases, most notably, "the win-ah and new champion!" when announcing a title change. He was also able to silence noisy and unruly crowds by shouting "Quiet please!" following with a "mollifying spread of his arms".&lt;ref name="Article"/&gt;

In August 1910, he and actor [[Raymond Hitchcock (actor)|Raymond Hitchcock]] purchased the original Chinese Theatre in [[Chinatown, Manhattan]] and turned it into the first [[movie theatre]] in the area. The movie house failed to catch on in the [[Chinese-American]] community, partly due to the ongoing [[Tong wars]], and they eventually sold the property to the New York Rescue Society for use as a mission.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Asbury|Asbury, Herbert]]. ''The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the New York Underworld''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. (pg. 286, 289) {{ISBN|1-56025-275-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also developed both close friendships and friendly rivalries with fellow announcers [[Tim Hurst (boxing announcer)|Tim Hurst]] and [[Charles J. Harvey]], outlasting Harvey when he retired from announcing to become [[secretary]] of the [[New York State Athletic Commission|New York Boxing Commission]] following the passage of the [[Frawley Law]] in 1911 and eventually became a manager. When [[Tex Rickard]] began promoting boxing at the old [[Madison Square Garden]] in 1925, Humphreys was hired as official ring announcer and was present at many of the top prize fights held at the venue including Jack Dempsey's bouts against [[Georges Carpentier]], [[Luis Firpo]] and [[Gene Tunney]]. He was a major fan of Gene Tunney and Jack Dempsey, regarding the latter as "the most devastating fighter ever to step in the ring". He often claimed that Dempsey's bout against Firpo was "the most exciting he had ever witnessed".&lt;ref name="Article"/&gt;

Humphreys was also highly skilled at using current events during his performances. For example, during the [[Jack Sharkey]] vs. [[Jim Maloney]] on May 20, 1927, he asked the crowd of 40,000 at [[Yankee Stadium]] to stand and observe a moment of silence for [[Charles Lindbergh]] who had left earlier that day on his transatlantic flight from New York to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Mosley, Leonard. ''Lindbergh: A Biography''. Courier Dover Publications, 2000. (pg. 104) {{ISBN|0-486-40964-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humphreys also became involved behind the scenes and was associated with Sam H. Harris in the management of then world bantamweight and featherweight champion [[Terry McGovern (boxer)|Terry McGovern]]. Upon his request, his granddaughter Terry was named in McGovern's honor. In 1929, he publicly stated that he intended to remain an announcer for 50 years. He was never known to take any special care for his voice, save chewing on a [[cough drop]] or when his throat became dry, and was opposed to using [[microphones]] when they were first introduced at Madison Square Garden.&lt;ref name="Article"/&gt;

Humphreys suffered a serious stroke in June, 1933 which sidelined him for only two months. He resumed his role August 17th of that year at Madison square garden. He made a few remarks to an enthusiastic crowd. At the third meeting between [[Barney Ross]] and [[Jimmy McLarnin]] in 1935, he was unable to enter the ring and had to do his introductory announcements from ringside. However, he was so ill that he was unable to attend the championship bout between [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]] and [[James J. Braddock]] on June 13, 1935 and missed the first major fight in his career.&lt;ref name="Article"/&gt;

He spent a month in the hospital and made his in-ring return at Yankee Stadium, welcomed by the 95,000 fans in attendance, to announce Max Baer-[[Joe Louis]] fight on September 24, 1935. Humphreys continued working at Madison Square Garden during the 1935-36 season, but announced only the main events. Although he lived most of his life in New York City, where he exclusively performed during his career, Humphreys spent his later years in [[Red Bank, New Jersey]] and [[New Rochelle, New York]].&lt;ref name="Article"/&gt;

In late-June 1936, Humphreys fell seriously ill and was confined to his home in [[Fair Haven, New Jersey]] for three weeks. On the morning of July 10, he apparently collapsed from heat and was unable to speak coherently. Falling into a coma at around 2:00 pm, he died an hour and a half later. His son and daughter-in-law, as well as his grand daughter Terry, were at his bedside at the time of his death.&lt;ref name="Article"/&gt;

In 1997, Humphreys was inducted into the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] as a "non-participant".

'''Kalmati''' is a [[Baloch people|Baloch]] clan settled in the [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] and [[Sindh]] provinces of [[Pakistan]]. The clan's name comes from the small city of Kalmat, situated between [[Iran]] and [[Pakistan]]. They are part of the [[Hooth]] Tribe, claiming descent from Hooth, a son of [[Mir Jalal Khan|Jalal Khan]]. When the Hooths were ruling [[Kech District|Kech]] [[Makran]], a few members of the tribe settled in Kalmat, near the port of [[Pasni City|Pasni]], in the coastal area of Balochistan. In the 12th century, the Kalmati had spread from Tehs Bandar in the western part of Balochistan to [[Shahbandar (Pakistan)|Shah Bandar]] in [[Sindh]]. Today, the Kalmati tribes live throughout the districts and towns of Balochistan and Shindh.

Kalmatis mostly work in cultivation and business. The famous graveyard called [[Chaukhandi tombs]] in [[Karachi]], is associated with this tribe.&lt;ref&gt;” A Study of Stone Craved Graves" written by Kaleem Lashari&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] historic M. Pikulin in his book says: Kalmati (karmats) is a tribe of names in the oldest legends. The researchers note that this tribe is characterized by a large admixture of [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] elements in all likelihood, the Baluchi-Qarmat is the descendants of the followers of the ancient religious and political sect of the early Middle Ages which in the 11th century portrayed its [[Qarmatians|Qarmatian]] state in [[Multan]] and [[North India|Northern India]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tm/books?id=7Jo5AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=pikulin-beludji&amp;dq=pikulin-beludji&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPmqK6qMTYAhXKAJoKHZq2DFgQ6AEIJzAA|title=Белуджи|last=Пикулин|first=Михаил Григорьевич|date=1959|publisher=Изд-во восточной лит-ры|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Baloch migration to Sindh and Punjab ===
According to Dr. Akhtar Baloch, [[Professor]] at [[University of Karachi]], the Balochis migrated from [[Balochistan region|Balochistan]] during the [[Little Ice Age]] and settled in [[Sindh]] and [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]].

=== The Portuguese ===
In the 15th century, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] captured few ports of modern [[Pakistan]] and [[Oman]], and planned to proceed with annexation of the coastal area of Makran. The Portuguese attacked Makran under the leadership of Vasco de Gama, but were repulsed by forces under the command of Mir Ismail. The Portuguese looted and set coastal villages on fire, but failed to capture the area of [[Makran]]. Cannons of the Portuguese army were found abandoned, lying near the central jail of [[Gwadar]].&lt;ref name="(Pakistan)1907"&gt;{{cite book|author=Baluchistan (Pakistan)|title=Baluchistan district gazetteer series|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jb61AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=28 June 2011|year=1907|publisher=printed at Bombay Education Society's Press|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ishaheel's grave is situated near the Mountain of Batal Gwadar, constructed by Ismaheel during his life. He died in 1468.

After Ismail's regime, his nephew Hammal (kalmati hooth

), son of Jihand Khan(Hooth), became the ruler of Makran. During his rule, the Portuguese initiated several attacks under the command of Lowess Dee Almia, but they were repelled each time, eventually agreeing to a truce wherein the Portuguese agreed not to attack the Makran coastal area. However, when Hammal was at sea with some companions, the Portuguese attacked his ship and too Hammal captive. A statue Hammal resides in a museum on the island of Goha in India, constructed by the Portuguese.

During this time, the Portuguese also attacked Tehs Bandar, which was under the command of Kareem Dad, who died in the attack along with 44 of his soldiers.

=== Resistance in Sindh ===
In the [[Mughal Empire]], the Kalmati tribe had a broad power base [[Hub, Balochistan|Hub]] to [[Keti Bandar]] in the [[Sindh]] province. After the Mughal defeat of the Portuguese from Ran Kach, the Mughals decided that the Kalmati had become a threat to their empire. Mughal emperor, [[Akbar]], plotted with local [[Sardar]]s (Chiefs) to overthrow the local Kalmati chiefs.  However, both being Baloch peoples, as well as a Kalmati force consisting of approximately 20,000 troops, foiled Akbar's plan.  His defeat led him to cede a large tract of agricultural land in Chachkan in Sindh province to the Kalmati, in 1654.  When his successor, Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] also failed in his attempt to break the power of the Kalmati, he ceded even more land to the Kalmati (this time in Sakro), in exchange for them not becoming rebels against the empire. During this period the Kalmati made alliances with other Baloch tribes, creating a Baloch confederacy. Mughal traders used the roads and sea routes in [[Sindh]] and [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]], and the Kalmati Sardar charged Rs. 9,600 per year as taxes from the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]].

=== Attacks of Arghoons ===
When Saleh Baig became [[Mirza]], he began a policy of persecution towards the Kalmati. As part of that persecution, Baig had the family of a person named Mureed executed.  Mureed vowed to not wear the traditional turban ([[Pagri (turban)|Pagri]]) until he had avenged them by killing Baig.  One day in [[Thatta]], Mureed saw Baig patrolling in the city with his protocol staff. Mureed assassinated Baig, and was in turn killed by Baig's protocol staff. This was a difficult period for all the Baloch tribes.

=== War with Kalhoros ===
In the regime of Mia Yar, the Kalmati were the only tribe to refuse to pay taxes to the government of [[Kalhora]].  The tax consisted of 50 camels or their equivalent value. In response, Muhammad Kalhoro attacked [[Malir]], in modern [[Karachi]], with 18,000 troops. The Kalmati became aware of the impending attack, and they relocated their cattle, women and children to a place called Lat Koh (Lat Mountain), situated between [[Gadap Town|Gadap]] and Kon Kor. In the ensuing battle, the government troops defeated the Kalmati tribe, with the remnants fleeing to Lat Koh. These Kalmati were called the Lati or Lateeg.

=== Kalmati lose Karachi to the British ===
On 2 February 1839, two [[Royal Navy|British naval ships]], the H.M.S. Hina and Wales, arrived at [[Manora, Karachi|Manora]] island of Karachi. They called on the Kalmatis to evacuate the port and surrender their arms. The tribe's commander refused to surrender, and replied, according to legend, "I am a Baloch and would prefer to be a martyr than to surrender."

Due to the power of the British forces, the [[Baloch people|Baloch]] began a [[Guerrilla warfare|guerilla war]]. After capturing [[Karachi]], the [[British Raj|British]] had built a military strongholds in [[Manora, Karachi|Manora]] and [[Aram Bagh]] areas of Karachi.

The '''Kemak''' ({{Lang-pt|'''Quémaque'''}}, also known as '''Ema''') people are an ethnic group numbering 80,000 in north-central [[Timor]] island. They primarily live in the district of [[Bobonaro District|Bobonaro]], [[East Timor]], while the rest live in the [[East Nusa Tenggara]] province of [[Indonesia]].

They are close to the Tetum people. The Kemak people speak the [[Kemak language]]. Kemak people are one of the smallest of the 14 Austronesian subgroups in [[Timor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Negrito of Malacca ; Timor: Chants des Éma by Brigitte Clamagirand |author=Andrew Toth |journal=Ethnomusicology |volume=24 |issue = 1|pages=142–145 |doi=10.2307/851330 |date=January 1980 |jstor = 851330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of them are adherents of traditional beliefs, while part of them profess to the Catholic faith.

==History==
{{see also|History of East Timor}}

===Kemak people of Atsabe===
[[File:Atsabe--o bazar-5 (retouched).jpg|thumb|right|A typical traditional clothing called "tais" as seen in a market in [[Atsabe]], circa 1968-1970.]]
Before the colonial period, [[Atsabe]] was one of the centers of [[Timor]] under the ''koronel bote'' (meaning "[[List of rulers of Timor#Kings of Atsabe|Kings"]]) of Atsabe Kemak, which dominated the entire Kemak inhabited areas in [[East Timor]] until the colonial period. The Kemak areas includes the north of present-day [[Bobonaro]], in the northern [[Ainaro]], and in the area of [[Suai, East Timor|Suai]] that were tributary to [[Atsabe]]. The small Kemak empire of Marobo had a peripheral location, which is why the Kemak people there were mixed with the neighboring [[Bunak people]] for generations. [[Atsabe]] was part of a complex alliance system through rituals, marriage and trade, though which the Tetun Dili people of [[Wehali]] with its capital, Laran were established. Laran was at the same time the spiritual center of the entire island. In addition to Tetum Dili and Kemak people, the [[Bunak people]] and [[Mambai people (Timor)|Mambai people]] of [[Aileu]] were also part of this alliance system. Together with the east of the island, the Portuguese called this area [[Belu (province)|Belu]] (also Belos or Behale).

According to the oral traditions of the Atsabe Kemaks people, they came relatively late under the colonial Portuguese rule. One reason could have been the far-reaching dispersal of the inhabitants and the impassibility of the mountainous landscape. Only in the 19th century did the Portuguese-Angolan troops had first invaded the area. The then [[List of rulers of Timor#Kings of Atsabe|Kings]] Dom Tomás Pinto opposed the invaders. But Dom Tomás was defeated and had to go to [[Atambua]] to flee to West Timor. Portuguese sources mentioned the region of [[Atsabe]] and [[Liurai]] only in the middle of the 19th century. The [[Atsabe]] rulers were particularly prone to rebel against the colonial leaders and their presence in the island. Two of Dom Tomás' grandchildren, Nai Resi and Nai Sama later fought for power. While Nai Resi turned against the Portuguese colonialists, Nai Sama supported the Portuguese. Nai Sama was finally executed by his own men, while Nai Resi was captured by the Portuguese in [[Hatulia Administrative Post|Hatulia]] and executed as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Andrea K. Molnar|title='Died in the Service of Portugal': Legitimacy of Authority and Dynamics of Group Identity among the Atsabe Kemak in East Timor |journal=Journal of Southeast Asian Studies |volume=37 |issue=2|pages=335–355 |year=2006|jstor=20072713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portuguese were first regarded as another people with their own ruler. After the resistance to them had failed, the Kemak people accepted the leaders of the Portuguese as part of their higher hierarchy that provided them with a larger army, holy men, the Catholic priests and with a larger Lulic (ritual practitioner). The flag of the Portuguese and even its flagpole were viewed as sacred objects.&lt;ref&gt; Geoffrey C. Gunn, ''Timor Loro Sae: 500 years'' (Macau: Livros do Oriente, 1999),p.284. ISBN 972-9418-69-1&lt;/ref&gt; The colonial rulers, confirmed as administrators of Portugal, were again legitimized by handing over of the flag.

The acceptance of Kemak people for the established Catholicism was closely related to their understanding of the personified holiness. This imported concept of holiness is seen as a stronger expansion of the local's existing traditional Luli. The Catholic priests were given land to build chapels and were allowed to do mission work. But the success of conversion was not much because of the friendless but rather so that one's own spiritual powers can be increased.

Nai Resi's son, Dom Cipriano Gonçalves (Dom Siprianu) became the ruler of [[Atsabe]] in 1912 until 1943. During the Japanese occupation of Timor,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p160561/pdf/book.pdf?referer=281 |title=Land and Life in Timor-Leste: Ethnographic Essays (Darlau: Origins and their significance for Atsabe Kemak identity) |author=Andrea K. Molnar |publisher=Australian National University |year=2011 |isbn=9781921862595 |page=99 |accessdate=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; he and the population of Atsabe made passive resistance. Therefore, Siprianu along with six of his relatives were taken hostage by the Japanese and later executed.

Since the Portuguese education system was reserved for the ruling class, they was also able to secure the leading positions in the colonial administration. The same was true later during the Indonesian occupation, the boundaries of collaboration and apparent cooperation for the protection of its own people were obvious. The East Timorese resistance also found partial support here.

The son of Siprianu and the last ruler of [[Atsabe]], Dom Guilherme Maria Gonçalves became a co-founder of the pro-Indonesian party, [[Timorese Popular Democratic Association]] (APODETI) in 1974, which called for the support of [[East Timor]] to [[Indonesia]]. During the Indonesian occupation, Dom Guilherme was the Governor of Indonesian [[Timor Timur]] from 1978 to 1982. Later, he distanced himself from [[Indonesia]] and went into Portuguese exile. After the East Timorese people had spoken in a 1999 referendum for an independence from [[Indonesia]], pro-Indonesian militias attacked family members and allies of the former ''koronel bote'' (meaning "rulers"). The reason was due to the suspect that the former ruler supported the independence movement.

===Other Kemak communities===
In the spring of 1867, the Kemak people from Lermean (today the municipality of [[Ermera District]]) under the supremacy of [[Maubara]] rose up against the Portuguese colonial masters. Governor Francisco Teixeira da Silva defeated the opposition in an unequal fight. In the decisive battle, which lasted for 48 hours, the rebels had to defend themselves against a superior fire power. 15 villages were taken and burnt down. The number of victims among the Timorese is not known, while the Portuguese counted their own losses with two dead and eight wounded. The territory of Lermeans was divided into the neighboring kingdoms.&lt;ref name="HOT86"&gt;Geoffrey C. Gunn, ''Timor Loro Sae: 500 years'' (Macau: Livros do Oriente, 1999), p.166 ISBN 972-9418-69-1&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868, the Portuguese sent a military force to [[Sucos of East Timor#Bobonaro Municipality|Suco]] Sanirin (Sanir / Saniry) whose ''liurai'' (ruler) refused to pay taxes, and a fort in [[Sucos of East Timor#Bobonaro Municipality|Suco]] Batugade was made to serve as a center for military operations. The Kemak people of [[Sucos of East Timor#Bobonaro Municipality|Suco]] Sanirin were officially Balibo Subdistrict tributary under Batugade military command.&lt;ref name="HOT86"/&gt;

==Religion and social structure==
[[File:Atsabe--Chapéus de chuva B.jpg|thumb|right|Traditional umbrellas (''saluric'' in [[Tetum language]]) used in [[Atsabe]], circa 1968-1970.]]
Like the other ethnic groups of [[East Timor]], the Kemak people today are largely adherents of the Catholic faith. Thus, in the [[Atsabe Administrative Post]] almost all inhabitants are Catholics. It spread particularly during the [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor]] (1975-1999) as a demarcation to the majority Muslim invaders. The church offered protection, criticized the brutal behavior of the occupiers, and was a means of peaceful protest. The veneration of the Virgin Mary, especially in small towns, is particularly marked by numerous religious ceremonies in churches and [[grotto]]es.

Nevertheless, the Christian rites still bear traces of the animistic, traditional religion. Components of the ancient religion are ancestral cult, reliquary worship and the concept of sacred ([[Kemak language]]: ''luli'', [[Tetum language]]: ''lulik'') places. One of them is Mount Dar Lau, which is the mythical place of origin of the Atsabe Kemak people. According to legend, heaven and earth were once connected at this point. Christian priests that kept animistic practices, are revered as holy men with spiritual powers (''Luli''). Such spiritual powers are passed on through a blessing. In doing so, these spiritual forces are not only derived from the office, but rather men who are credited with spiritual forces to join the priesthood.

There are slight variations in the ceremonies between the different groups of Kemak communities, such as the Atsabe Kemak and the Marobo Kemak people.

Society is characterized by a hierarchical division according to the families, the "houses". The house of the ''Koronel'' ([[Tetum language]]: ''Liurai''), the traditional kingship, had their authority derived from their origins in their founding fathers and their ''luli''. The latter could either be both in a person himself as well as in sacred objects. The same applies to the traditional priests (''gases ubu''), who claimed their position on the basis of their origin and ritual knowledge. They were the guardians of sacred history and traditions. Only the king surpasses them in holiness. He also retains the largest share of holy objects, which were handed down from their founding fathers. But the authority of the priests is limited to the rituals. However, it was possible that a person have both secular power, for example, as a village chief, and at the same time a priest. The king of Atsabe had both authorities. In addition, the king's house secured his position of power though strategical marriage policy, the exchange of women and material goods, and the formation of an army to fight in regional feuds and head hunting.

The sacred houses are built together by all men who belong to a tribe line. They meet on a weekend, once a month, for eleven months. At the end of the monthly work is always a small ritual feast celebrated. The sacred houses consist of seven levels, each with four steps. Restriction to the access depends on the degree of kinship. Simple guests are allowed only in the lowest level of the house, friends at least in the second level, married relatives in the third, relatives from neighbouring villages in the fourth and partly in the fifth, those married in the village in the sixth and only the ''Lulik Nain'' (meaning "Lord of the Holy") up to the seventh level. He is the guardian of the house and the sacred objects, which are kept here. At the inauguration of the house, a buffalo is sacrificed and a great feast is celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.easttimorlawandjusticebulletin.com/2013/02/rituals-sacrifice-symbolism-in-timor_1.html |title=Rituals, Sacrifice &amp; Symbolism in Timor-Leste |author=Matthew Libbis |publisher=East Timor Law and Justice Bulletin |date=1 February 2013 |accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funeral ceremonies===
[[File:Atsabe--casa típca.jpg|thumb|right|A traditional house called ''laco'', for meeting the families that are part of a ''Lulic'' (sacred) house and also to receive guests, circa 1968-1970.]]

The burial ceremonies of the Kemak people (''Tau tana mate'') are divided into three phases, namely ''Huku bou'', ''Leko-cicir lia'' and ''Koli nughu''. The burial ceremonies are referred to as black rituals (''Metama no''). It is one of the occasions when the living ones come into contact with their ancestors, which also leads to the renewal and restructuring of the social connections between the living and the dead as well as between the alliance partners, whom are connected by marriage. The house of the "bride-donors" (''ai mea'') and those of the "bride-receptors" play central roles in the burial ceremonies, as in other major events. Before all members of the family have arrived, the ritual cannot be started. The blood of the sacrificial animals that the ''Ai mea'' have donated is used to brush ritual objects and the grave. In times of polygamy, the attendance of second wives and their participation (''Bei-bei'') is an absolute requirement. In addition, there are also the attendance of the entire sides of the family, such as those of the older and younger houses (''ka'ara-aliri''), which are connected by marriage and the friendly and allied ones.

For the Atsabe Kemak people the first phase of burial, the ''Huku bou'', consists of sacrifice of at least five water buffaloes and several goats and pigs. The dead person is then buried in a Christian grave. The second phase, ''Leko-cicir lia'', is the most cost-intensive ritual of the Kemak culture. This is usually performed jointly for several deceased. Only a high status dead person, such as a ''Koronel'', receive an independent ritual. The ritual is usually performed before the beginning of the planting season (August to September), since it is combined with the request to the ancestors for a rich harvest. According to traditional belief, the second rite have not been performed yet for the soul of the deceased and it is said to remain near his house and village (''Asi naba coa pu''). The later the ''leko-cicir lia'' takes place, the more shall the lonely soul long for his society, and therefore will call for the souls of the living to him. An accumulation of deaths within a house is regarded as a sign of such a case. Nevertheless, the ritual is usually carried out only years after the first phase, since the house of the dead must first afford the economic means for such expensive ritual. It is particularly complicated by the concept of the Second Burial. The bones of the deceased are excavated, cleaned and re-buried, while the soul of the dead are guided through ritual songs (''Nele'') of the priest to the village of the ancestors on the [[Tatamailau]], [[East Timor]]'s highest mountain. The songs can take up to 14 hours. During the ritual, water buffaloes are once again presented as animal sacrifices. The severed sexual organs of all sacrificial animals are brought deep into the sacred jungle (''Ai lara hui'') at the end of the ceremony and placed there before ''Bia Mata Ai Pun'' (the origin of spring and trees). The ancestors are conjured up by a song, through the sacrifices of animals, to transfer the souls of the dead to the ancestors. At the end the bones of the dead are again buried. The conclusion is now a Christian Mass, the only reference to the new faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/EastTimor/religion.htm |title=Religion: Catholicism and ancestral cults |author=Andrea K.

There are small number of '''Koreans in the Czech Republic''', comprising both [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea|South]] Koreans.

==North Koreans==

===Students and scholars===
One early Korean scholar in [[Czechoslovakia]] was Han Hŭng-su. Born in 1909, he studied in [[Vienna]], [[Bern]], and [[Fribourg]] in the late 1930s and early 1940s before coming to [[Prague]] in 1942/3. He stayed there for a few years, translating [[Korean literature]] into [[German language|German]] and [[Czech language|Czech]] and writing a book and various articles in those languages about the [[history of Korea]]. A supporter of communism, he chose [[Pyongyang]] as his destination when he returned to the [[Korean peninsula]] in the late 1940s, but was purged near the end of the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.raskb.com/content/han-h%C5%ADng-su-multi-talented-forgotten-korean-scholar-europe|first=Jaroslav|last=Olša|title=Han Hŭng-su: a multi-talented but forgotten Korean scholar in Europe|publisher=[[Royal Asiatic Society]], Korea Branch|date=2013-06-18|accessdate=2013-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most North Korean [[international student]]s in the 1950s studied in either [[Czechoslovakia]] or [[Hungary]]. In 1955, there were student demonstrations at [[Charles University]] in response to the financial assistance and preferential treatment shown to North Korean students.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/102-4-1.shtml|last=Buhler|first=Neal|last2=Zukowski|first2=Stanley|year=1955|title=Discrimination in Education in the People's Democracies|publisher=Mid-European Studies Center, Free Europe Committee|publication-place=New York City|accessdate=2009-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were about 150 North Korean students in Czechoslovakia in 1989, according to the personal testimony of two among them—both students at a dental college in Prague—who defected to South Korea in February that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://archive.deseretnews.com/archive/35815/2-STUDENTS-DEFECT-FROM-N-TO-S-KOREA.html|title=2 Students Defect From N. to S. Korea|date=1989-02-26|accessdate=2009-05-21|periodical=Deseret News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources reported 200. North Korea recalled them all back home after the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Burton|last=Bollag|title=Fall of Communist Governments Has Cut Enrollment of Third-World Students in Eastern-Bloc Universities|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=1990-09-05|volume=37|issue=1|page=A41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guest workers===
There was formerly a contingent of nearly four hundred North Koreans working in the Czech Republic, including about ninety women working as seamstresses in Snezka, a company in [[Náchod]] that manufactures sheets for cars and travel bags, and others in [[Skuteč]].&lt;ref name="PDM"&gt;{{citation|periodical=Prague Daily Monitor|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-20904121_ITM|date=2004-04-01|accessdate=2009-05-20|title=North Korean seamstresses in Skutec attack Czech Television staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChosunIlbo20091028"&gt;{{citation|periodical=Chosun Ilbo|date=2009-10-28|accessdate=2009-12-29|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2009/10/28/2009102800620.html|title=Czech Factory Regrets Departure of N. Koreans}}&lt;/ref&gt; M-Plus, a Czech labour broker company with contacts in the North Korean Ministry of Light Industry, arranged most of their visas and employment contracts. The workers were typically women between 18 and 22 years of age, and came from politically reliable families; they saw their assignment to the Czech Republic as a reward and a good opportunity to earn money.&lt;ref name="WorkingOvertime"/&gt;

According to media reports, about half eventually learned to speak [[Czech language|Czech]] and sometimes socialised with the other workers at their factories, primarily [[Ukrainians in the Czech Republic|Ukrainian migrants]] and local people, discussing work-related topics. European media coverage described the workers as "21st-century slaves", a characterisation which their employers strongly disputed, pointing out that their wages, work hours, and overtime payments were the same as their colleagues of other nationalities.&lt;ref name="ChosunIlbo20091028"/&gt; However, they always moved around in groups, never alone, and were accompanied by a North Korean government minder at all times.&lt;ref name="WorkingOvertime"/&gt; In 2004, a television crew came to [[Skutec]] in an attempt to film and investigate North Korean workers there. However, shortly after their arrival, they were attacked by 30 North Korean women throwing stones, and lost their footage.&lt;ref name="PDM"/&gt; Media figures later speculated that the widespread coverage of the North Korean workers' plight had made them feel threatened, and that the publicity may have actually damaged their standing and put their families in danger.&lt;ref name="RadioPrague"&gt;{{citation|last=Lazarová|first=Daniela|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/article/52370|title=Plight of North Korean seamstresses evokes concern|date=2004-04-02|accessdate=2009-05-21|periodical=Radio Prague}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 Czech police investigation revealed that the women deposited nearly 80% of their wages into a collective bank account; this was further corroborated by testimony from [[North Korean defectors|defector]] Kim Tae-san, formerly an official at the North Korean embassy in Prague.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/09/world/europe/09iht-czech.3465814.html|title=North Korean 'slaves' in Europe? Czech officials monitor freedom of nearly 400 workers|date=2006-11-09|accessdate=2009-05-21|last=Bricker|first=Mindy Kay|periodical=International Herald Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, due to the negative publicity, and pressure from U.S.-based customers due to the [[2006 North Korean nuclear test]] and the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718|resulting sanctions]], many companies stopped employing North Korean guest workers, and the Czech Republic stopped issuing employment visas to them. However, even after the existing visas expired, 144 North Koreans continued to work in the Czech Republic. Media reports speculated that the remaining North Koreans may have been granted individual exemptions by immigration officials, or had been able to obtain other types of visas.&lt;ref name="WorkingOvertime"/&gt;

==South Koreans==

The population of South Koreans in the Czech Republic more than quadrupled between 2005 and 2009, according to the statistics of South Korea's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (South Korea)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade]].&lt;ref name="MOFAT"/&gt; South Korea's National Institute for International Education Development recognises one Korean weekend school in the Czech Republic, the Prague Hangul School (프라하한글학교), founded in January 1997; {{asof|2004|lc=on}}, it employed seven teachers and enrolled 35 students at the kindergarten through middle school levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Korean Language School - Informal|publisher=National Institute for International Education Development|year=2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040507202503/http://www.interedu.go.kr/edu_net/overseas/sch_informal_inform.htm?no=207&amp;page=17&amp;key=|archivedate=2004-05-07|url=http://www.interedu.go.kr/edu_net/overseas/sch_informal_inform.htm?no=207&amp;page=17&amp;key=|accessdate=2009-12-30|chapter=프라하한글학교}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portrayals in popular culture include the show ''[[Lovers in Prague]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=South Korea has Lovers in Prague|first=Kristina|last=Alda|date=2005-11-02|accessdate=2009-05-21|periodical=The Prague Post|url=http://www.thepraguepost.com/articles/2005/11/02/south-korea-has-lovers-in-prague.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://cze.mofat.go.kr/webmodule/common/download.jsp?boardid=3323&amp;tablename=TYPE_LEGATION&amp;seqno=f8c011032f81045fc0057fb1&amp;fileseq=05b06bfb1fd504dfa303b07b|title={{asiantitle|주요 연락처|||a}}|publisher=Embassy of the Republic of Korea|publication-place=Prague|date=2007-11-15|accessdate=2009-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Korean embassy in Prague lists one Roman Catholic church with a Korean priest and five Protestant churches with Korean pastors in the city.&lt;ref name="Embassy"/&gt; Additionally, the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] church ''U Jákobova žebříku'' ("At Jacob's Ladder"), near the [[Kobylisy (Prague Metro)|Kobylisy]] station of the [[Prague Metro]], also hosts services in Korean.&lt;ref name="JacobsLadder"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.rozhlas.cz/nabozenstvi/zpravy/_zprava/465222|title=Češi i Korejci v kostele U Jákobova žebříku/Czechs and Koreans at the Church At Jacob's Ladder|periodical=[[Czech Radio]]|first=Naděžda|last=Hávová|date=2008-06-14|accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also six [[Korean Buddhism|Korean Buddhist]] temples in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name="Korean temples" /&gt;

'''Kot'''  (2001 pop. 3,920)&lt;ref&gt;[http://fatehpur.nic.in/ Fatehpur government website] Retrieved 2011-03-19.&lt;/ref&gt; is a village in the southeast corner of [[Fatehpur district]] in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]]. The village was founded by Malik Bahbal (Izzuddin Malik Babar), a general in the army of  [[Shahabuddin Muhammad Ghauri|ShahabUddin Ghori]] (also Ghauri, Ghouri)  in the 12th century. Kot has 12 smaller satellite villages. They are Kot, Minatara, Maksudanpur,Ghazipur, Manmai, Kulli, Rahmatpur, Shivpuri, Parvezpur(Parbetpur), Adhaiya, oraha, Shahnagar and Ratanpur. The people from the area refer to themselves as Kahkar or kakhar (kayani) also as Khokhars. Another community from this area is the [[Kshatriya]]s, who call themselves Chandrauls, Chandelas or Chandravashi Kshatriya (descendants of King Parikshit).

==History==
The [[Khokhar Khanzada]] tribe, originally numbering almost 100,000, has lived in Kot, Fatehpur district, for nearly 800 years. As of 2011, the population of Khokkhars living in the Kot area is estimated at about 5,000; other Khokkars are scattered around many parts of India. Most of the original population emigrated to [[Pakistan]]. Many others moved to Jabalpur, Bhopal, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Kolkata, Delhi, Visakhapatnam, Bhubneshwar, Bilaspur, Itarsi, Banda, Charkhari (Bundelkhand) and other parts of India. Some emigrated to the Middle East, Dubai, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, the US, Canada, the UK, Germany, and other countries for economic gain. The worldwide  Khokkhar population may be as high as 300,000.

Research indicates that the Kokkhars are the descendants of [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] Persians who, after their defeat by the Arabs in Persia, took refuge in Punjab; the army of King Babar (which was passing through the area) recruited them because of their ferocity in warfare.

Another reference indicates that the Kokkhars are a tribe of the Rajput clan (inferred due to their ruling status in the Kuh-i-Jud regions of [[Punjab region|Punjab]]), and have allied with other clans (such as the Janjua) in pushing back the Ghorid armies from the region.

"Ghakkar" and "Kakar" are other variations of Kokkhar. Although they are not of Chandra, Surya or Agnikula Vansh lineage, they were given the status of Rajput Pathan by the priests of their time; it was not a self-proclaimed title. This demonstrates that the Kokkhars are not Jatts, Thakurs or any other military tribe of India, and may not be an indigenous ethnic group. Many defeated royal figures with Uzbek, Persian and Pashtun origins became Lashkari (allies of passing warlords), the Kokkhars among them. They are mistakenly thought to have been in frequent conflict with the Indian Jatts, Thakurs and Rajputs; rather, they sided with the Jatts, Rajputs and Moguls against the Ghorides.

The term "Kokkhar" is equivalent to "barbarian" in Europe, since they originated in Central Asia. They were Huns, who rapidly attacked and influenced northern India. The Kokkhars played a similar role with respect to northern India's empires as the barbarians (or the Huns) did for the Roman Empire. More research is needed, since much Kokkhar history is currently unknown.

==Ethnicity==

Many Khokkhar elders living in Kot refer to their ancestors as ''Ajbuk'', an Uzbek word meaning "wild warriors". Rivalries (sometimes escalating to armed hostility) have traditionally been frequent between – and within – various Khokkhar groups. Historical and geographic factors have spawned diversity within the Khokkhars. The relationship between tribe and ethnic group is complex, and all Khokkhars (including those in rural areas) consider themselves linked to the [[Pashtun people]] and the armies of the [[Mughal Empire|Moguls]] and [[Alauddin Khalji]].{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Despite a degree of social uniformity, many different phenotypes may be found in the Khokkhar population including blond-haired, blue-eyed Khokkhars. Those with darker features and [[epicanthic fold]]s are considered to be descendants of Kokkhars. Tall, olive-skinned, mustachioed tribesmen and those who combine these features are said to be descendants of the Rajput and Khokkhar dynasties. Although it may be tempting to associate certain physical features with a particular ethnic group, scholars recognize that (since all human populations are capable of intermingling, and do so)  there are more physical differences found within ethnic groups than between them. In general, Khokkhars living in Kot have light skin (nearly Caucasian); they are tall, and resemble the [[Uzbeks]].

==Kot today==

The Afghan and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North Western Frontier's]] rugged environment isolated residential communities and created micro-environments with rigorous survival skills. Kot possesses a similar topography; it is located near the [[Yamuna]] River at high altitude, providing a spectacular scenery of ancient fortified fortresses. Members of the different Kokkhar groups and Khandans residing in different locations must adapt to their own micro-environments.  Many Khokkhars use ''Khan'' as a surname, while others have adopted the surname ''Khokkhar''. Many Khokkhars (in Kot, elsewhere in India and abroad) are involved in business; some are bureaucrats, or otherwise in public service (including members of the military and police forces). India's leading motivational speaker Naseer Khan belongs to Khokkhars from Kot, Fatehpur.More information about exact origin is awaited, Historian Late Mehmudul Hassan Khan from Barkheda Railway Station a place located in Madhya Pradesh state of India  wrote detailed literature which is going to publish in coming days

'''LGBT themes in speculative fiction''' refer to the incorporation of lesbian, gay, [[bisexual]], or [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) themes into science fiction, [[fantasy]], [[horror fiction]] and related genres.{{Ref label|Note1|a|a}} Such elements may include an LGBT character as the protagonist or a major character, or explorations of [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]] or [[gender]] that deviate from the [[heteronormativity|hetero-normative]].

Science fiction and fantasy have traditionally been [[puritanical]] genres aimed at a male readership,&lt;ref name="oxfordresearch"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oziewicz |first1=Marek |title=Speculative Fiction |journal=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Literature |date=29 March 2017 |doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.001.0001/acrefore-9780190201098-e-78 |url=http://literature.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.001.0001/acrefore-9780190201098-e-78 |accessdate=29 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be more restricted than non-genre literature by their [[genre convention|conventions]] of characterisation and the effect that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. However, speculative fiction also gives authors and readers the freedom to imagine societies that are different from real-life cultures. This freedom makes speculative fiction a useful means of examining sexual bias, by forcing the reader to reconsider his or her [[heteronormative]] cultural assumptions. It has also been claimed by critics such as [[Nicola Griffith]] that LGBT readers identify strongly with the [[mutant (fictional)|mutants]], [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|aliens]], and other outsider characters found in speculative fiction.

Before the 1960s, explicit sexuality of any kind was rare in speculative fiction, as the editors who controlled what was published attempted to protect their perceived key market of adolescent male readers. As the readership broadened, it became possible to include characters who were undisguised homosexuals, though these tended to be villains, and lesbians remained almost entirely unrepresented. In the 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began to reflect the changes prompted by the [[civil rights movement]] and the emergence of a [[counterculture]]. [[New Wave (science fiction)|New wave]] and [[feminist science fiction]] authors realised cultures in which homosexuality, bisexuality and a variety of gender models were the norm, and in which sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality were commonplace.

From the 1980s onwards, homosexuality gained much wider mainstream acceptance, and was often incorporated into otherwise conventional speculative fiction stories. Works emerged that went beyond simple representation of homosexuality to explorations of specific issues relevant to the [[LGBT community]]. This development was helped by the growing number of openly gay or lesbian authors and their early acceptance by [[science fiction fandom|speculative fiction fandom]]. Specialist gay publishing presses and a number of awards recognising LGBT achievements in the genre emerged, and by the twenty-first century blatant [[homophobia]] was no longer considered acceptable by most readers of speculative fiction. There was a concurrent increase in representation of homosexuality within non-literary forms of speculative fiction. The inclusion of LGBT themes in comic books, television and film continues to attract media attention and controversy, while the perceived lack of sufficient representation, along with unrealistic depictions, provokes criticism from LGBT sources.

==Critical analysis==
[[File:Hyakinthos.jpg|thumb|[[Anemoi#West wind (Zephyrus)|Zephyr]] and [[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyakinthos]]: Greek mythology, which often features homosexuality, is a source for much modern speculative fiction and mythic figures continue to appear in fantasy stories.&lt;ref name="glbtq1-6"/&gt;]]
{{See also|LGBT themes in horror fiction|LGBT themes in mythology}}

As genres of popular literature, science fiction and fantasy often seem more constrained than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation and the effects that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender.&lt;ref name="glbtq1-6"/&gt; Science fiction in particular has traditionally been a puritanical genre oriented toward a male readership.&lt;ref name="EoSF4"&gt;Clute &amp; Nicholls, p. 1088 "Sex"&lt;/ref&gt; Sex is often linked to disgust in SF and horror,&lt;ref name="EoSF4"/&gt; and plots based on sexual relationships have mainly been avoided in genre fantasy narratives.&lt;ref name=EoF&gt;Clute &amp; Grant, "Sex" p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, science fiction and fantasy can also provide more freedom than [[Realism (arts)|realistic]] literature to imagine alternatives to the default assumptions of heterosexuality and masculinity that permeate many cultures.&lt;ref name="glbtq1-6"/&gt; Homosexuality is now an accepted and common feature of science fiction and fantasy literature, its prevalence due to the influence of lesbian-feminist and gay liberation movements.&lt;ref name="UWx"&gt;Garber &amp; Paleo, p. x "Preface"&lt;/ref&gt;

In speculative fiction, extrapolation allows writers to focus not on the way things are (or were), as non-genre literature does, but on the way things could be different. It provides science fiction with a quality that science fiction critic [[Darko Suvin]] has called "[[cognition|cognitive]] estrangement": the recognition that what we are reading is not the world as we know it, but a world whose differences force us to reconsider our own with an outsider's perspective.&lt;ref name="Suvin cog estrangment"&gt;Darko Suvin, ''Metamorphoses of Science Fiction'', Yale University Press 1979, {{ISBN|978-0-300-02375-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= WP2&gt;{{cite journal |last= Pearson |first= Wendy | title = Alien Cryptographies: The View from Queer| work = Science Fiction Studies| issue = #77, Volume 26, Part 1, March 1999|url=http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/77/pearson77.htm|accessdate= 2008-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the extrapolation involves sexuality or gender, it can force the reader to reconsider his or her [[heteronormative]] cultural assumptions; the freedom to imagine societies different from real-life cultures makes SF an effective tool for examining sexual bias.&lt;ref name="EoSF4"/&gt; In science fiction, such estranging features include technologies that significantly alter sex or [[reproduction]]. In fantasy, such features include figures such as [[mythology|mythological]] [[deities]] and heroic archetypes, who are not limited by preconceptions of human sexuality and gender, allowing them to be reinterpreted.&lt;ref name="glbtq1-6"&gt;Marchesani, pp.1–6&lt;/ref&gt; SF has also depicted a plethora of alien methods of reproduction and sex,&lt;ref name="EoSF4"/&gt; some of which can be viewed as homo- or bisexual through a human [[gender binary|binary-gender]] lens.

In spite of the freedom offered by the genres, gay characters often remain contrived and stereotypical,&lt;ref name="UWxix"&gt;Garber &amp; Lyn Paleo, p. xix "Introduction" by [[Samuel R. Delany]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UWxi"&gt;Garber &amp; Lyn Paleo, p. xi "Preface"&lt;/ref&gt; and most SF stories take for granted the continuation of heteronormative institutions.&lt;ref name="Farah Mendlesohn Eds p. 153"&gt;Edward James and Farah Mendlesohn Eds.,''The Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction'', "Science Fiction and Queer Theory", Wendy Pearson, p. 153. {{ISBN|0-521-01657-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative sexualities have usually been approached [[allegory|allegorically]], or by including LGBT characters in such a way as to not contradict mainstream society's assumptions about [[gender role]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Edward James and Farah Mendlesohn Eds.,''The Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction'', "Science Fiction and Queer Theory", Wendy Pearson, p. 150. {{ISBN|0-521-01657-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Works that feature gay characters are more likely to be written by women writers, and to be viewed as being aimed at other women or girls; big-name male writers are less likely to explore gay themes.&lt;ref name=SFC137&gt;Bacon-Smith, p.137&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==

===Proto-SF===
[[File:carmilla.jpg|thumb|Illustration by [[D. H. Friston]] that accompanied the first publication of lesbian vampire novella ''Carmilla'' in ''The Dark Blue'' magazine in 1872]]
''[[True History]]'' by the Greek writer [[Lucian]] (A.D. 120–185) has been called the earliest surviving example of science fiction&lt;ref name="Fredericks, S.C."&gt;Fredericks, S.C.: [http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/8/fredericks8art.htm “Lucian's True History as SF”], ''Science Fiction Studies'', Vol. 3, No. 1 (March 1976), pp. 49–60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gunn, James E. denotes ''True History'' as "Proto-Science Fiction", p.249&lt;/ref&gt; and the first ever "gay science fiction story".&lt;ref name="First gay pope"&gt;Lynne Yamaguchi Fletcher ''The First Gay Pope and other records'', p. 95, Alyson Publications: 1992 {{ISBN|978-1-55583-206-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrator is suddenly enveloped by a [[typhoon]] and swept up to the moon, which is inhabited by a society of men that are at war with the sun. After the hero distinguishes himself in combat, the king gives him his son the prince in marriage. The all-male society reproduces (male children only) by giving birth from the thigh or by growing a child from a plant produced by planting the left [[testicle]] in the moon's soil.&lt;ref name="encylhomos1"&gt;Dynes, Johansson, Percy &amp; Donaldson, Pg. 752, "Science Fiction"&lt;/ref&gt;

In other proto-SF works, sex itself, of any type, was equated with base desires or "beastliness", as in ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', which contrasts the animalistic and overtly sexual [[Yahoo (Gulliver's Travels)|Yahoos]] with the reserved and intelligent [[Houyhnhnms]].&lt;ref name="EoSF4"/&gt; The frank treatment of sexual topics of pre-nineteenth century literature was abandoned in most speculative fiction,&lt;ref name="EoSF4"/&gt; although Wendy Pearson has written that issues of gender and sexuality have been central to SF since its inception but were ignored by readers and critics until the late twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Hollinger &amp; Gordon, ''Queer Universes: Sexualities in Science Fiction,'' Liverpool UP, 2008, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Early works that contained LGBT themes and showed the gay characters to be morally impure include the first [[lesbian vampire]] story "[[Carmilla]]" (1872) by [[Sheridan Le Fanu]]{{Ref label|Note1|b|b}}&lt;ref&gt;Garber &amp; Paleo, "Carmilla" p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' (1890) by [[Oscar Wilde]], which shocked contemporary readers with its sensuality and overtly homosexual characters.&lt;ref&gt;Garber &amp; Paleo, "The Picture of Dorian Gray" p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[An Anglo-American Alliance]]'', a 1906 novel by Gregory Casparian, was the first SF-themed novel to openly portray a lesbian romantic relationship.&lt;ref name=io9&gt;{{cite news|last=Nevins|first=Jess|title=The First Lesbian Science Fiction Novel, Published in 1906|url=http://io9.com/5847805/the-first-lesbian-science-fiction-novel-published-in-1906|accessdate=October 8, 2011|newspaper=[[io9]]|date=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The pulp era (1920–30s)===
During the [[pulp magazine|pulp]] era,&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of Science Fiction |last=Roberts |first=Adam  |authorlink=Adam Roberts (British writer) |page=195 |year=2006 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=New York |isbn=0-333-97022-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; explicit sexuality of any kind was rare in genre science fiction and fantasy.&lt;ref name="EoSF4"/&gt; For many years, the editors who controlled what was published felt that they had to protect the adolescent male readership that they identified as their principal market.&lt;ref name="EoSF4"/&gt; Although the covers of some 1930s pulp magazines showed scantily clad women menaced by tentacled aliens, the covers were often more lurid than the magazines' contents.&lt;ref name="EoSF4"/&gt; In such a context, writers like [[Edgar Pangborn]], who featured passionate male friendships in his work, were exceptional; almost until the end of their careers, including so much as a kiss would have been too much. Implied or disguised sexuality was as important as that which was openly revealed.&lt;ref name="EoSF4"/&gt; As such, genre SF reflected the social mores of the day, paralleling common prejudices;&lt;ref name="EoSF4"/&gt; This was particularly true of pulp fiction, more so than literary works of the time.&lt;ref name="EoSF4"/&gt;

As the demographics of the readership broadened, it became possible to include characters who were more or less undisguised homosexuals, but these, in accordance with the attitudes of the times, tended to be villains: evil, demented, or effeminate stereotypes. The most popular role for the homosexual was as a 'decadent slaveholding lordling' whose corrupt tyranny was doomed to be overthrown by the young male heterosexual hero.&lt;ref name="encylhomos1"/&gt; During this period, lesbians were almost entirely unrepresented as either heroes or villains.&lt;ref name="encylhomos1"/&gt;

One of the earliest examples of genre science fiction that involves a challenging amount of unconventional sexual activity is the early novel ''[[Odd John]]'' (1935), by [[Olaf Stapledon]]. John is a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] with extraordinary mental abilities who will not allow himself to be bound by many of the rules imposed by the ordinary British society of his time. The novel strongly implies that he seduces an older boy who becomes devoted to him but also suffers from the affront that the relationship creates to his own morals.&lt;ref&gt;Garber &amp; Paleo, "Odd John" p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Golden Age (1940–50s)===
In the [[Golden Age of Science Fiction]],&lt;ref name=History/&gt; the genre "resolutely ignored the whole subject" of homosexuality, according to Joanna Russ.&lt;ref name="UW pg. xxii"&gt;Joanna Russ, Introduction to ''Uranian Worlds: A Guide to Alternative Sexuality in Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror'', p xxii, Ed. Eric Garber, Lyn Paleo G K Hall: 1983 {{ISBN|978-0-8161-1832-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the readership for science fiction and fantasy began to age in the 1950s, however, writers like [[Philip Jose Farmer]] and [[Theodore Sturgeon]] were able to introduce more explicit sexuality into their work. Until the late 1960s, however, few other writers depicted alternative sexuality or revised gender roles, or openly investigated sexual questions.&lt;ref name="EoSF4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SFC135/&gt; The majority of LGBT characters were depicted as caricatures, such as "man-hating amazons", and attempts at portraying homosexuals sympathetically or non-stereotypically were met with hostility.&lt;ref name="Farah Mendlesohn Eds p. 153"/&gt;

Sturgeon wrote many stories during the Golden Age of Science Fiction that emphasised the importance of love, regardless of the current social norms. In his short story "[[The World Well Lost]]" (1953),{{Ref label|Note1|c|c}} first published in ''Universe'' magazine, homosexual alien fugitives and unrequited (and taboo) human homosexual love are portrayed. The tagline for the ''Universe'' cover was "[His] most daring story";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dick Jenssen |url=http://www.spacedoutinc.org/DU-16/WorldWellLost.html |title=Ruminations on The World Well Lost |publisher=Spacedoutinc.org |accessdate=2008-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217073942/http://www.spacedoutinc.org/DU-16/WorldWellLost.html |archivedate=February 17, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; its sensitive treatment of homosexuality was unusual for science fiction published at that time, and it is now regarded as a milestone in science fiction's portrayal of homosexuality.&lt;ref name="UW pg. 130"&gt;Eric Garber, Lyn Paleo ''Uranian Worlds: A Guide to Alternative Sexuality in Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror'', p 130, G K Hall: 1983 {{ISBN|978-0-8161-1832-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to an anecdote related by Samuel R. Delany, when Sturgeon first submitted the story, the editor (Haywood Braun) not only rejected it but phoned every other editor he knew and urged them to reject it as well.&lt;ref name="UW pg. xviii"&gt;Samuel R. Delany, Introduction to ''Uranian Worlds: A Guide to Alternative Sexuality in Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror'', p xviii, Ed. Eric Garber, Lyn Paleo G K Hall: 1983 {{ISBN|978-0-8161-1832-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Hollinger &amp; Gordon, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Sturgeon would later write ''Affair with a Green Monkey'', which examined social stereotyping of homosexuals, and in 1960 published ''[[Venus Plus X]]'', in which a single-gender society is depicted and the protagonist's homophobia portrayed unfavourably.&lt;ref name="encylhomos1"/&gt;

Images of homosexual male societies remained strongly negative in the eyes of most SF authors. For example, when overpopulation drives the world away from heterosexuality in [[Charles Beaumont]]'s short story "The Crooked Man" (1955), first published in ''[[Playboy]]'', inhumane homosexuals begin to oppress the heterosexual minority. In [[Anthony Burgess]]'s ''[[The Wanting Seed]]''  (1962) homosexuality is required for official employment; Burgess treats this as one aspect of an unnatural state of affairs which includes violent warfare and the failing of the natural world.&lt;ref name="encylhomos1"/&gt;

Although not usually identified as a genre writer, [[William S. Burroughs]] produced works with a surreal narrative that estranged the action from the ordinary world as science fiction and fantasy do. In 1959 he published ''[[Naked Lunch]]'', the first of many works such as ''[[The Nova Trilogy]]'' and ''[[The Wild Boys (novel)|The Wild Boys]]'' in which he linked drug use and homosexuality as anti-authoritarian activities.&lt;ref name="glbtq1-6"/&gt;

===The New Wave era (1960–70s)===
{{Quote box|width=25%|align=right|quote=&lt;div style="text-align:left;"&gt;In a little more than a decade, from the late 1960s to 1980, the number of works which contained homosexuality in science fiction and fantasy more than doubled all that had come previously.&lt;/div&gt;

}}
By the late 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began to reflect the changes prompted by the civil rights movement and the emergence of a counterculture.&lt;ref name=GLBTQ3/&gt;  Within the genres, these changes were incorporated into a movement called "the [[New Wave (science fiction)|New Wave]],"&lt;ref name=History/&gt; a movement more sceptical of technology, more liberated socially, and more interested in stylistic experimentation.&lt;ref name=GLBTQ3&gt;Marchesani, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; New Wave writers were more likely to claim an interest in "inner space" instead of outer space. They were less shy about explicit sexuality and more sympathetic to reconsiderations of gender roles and the social status of sexual minorities. Under the influence of New Wave editors and authors such as [[Michael Moorcock]] (editor of the influential ''[[New Worlds (magazine)|New Worlds]]''), sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality and gender multiplied in science fiction and fantasy, becoming commonplace.&lt;ref name="EoSF4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=GLBTQ3/&gt;&lt;ref name="encylhomos2"&gt;Dynes, Johansson, Percy &amp; Donaldson, p. 752, "Science Fiction"&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of gay imagery has also been attributed to the influence of lesbian-feminist and gay liberation movements in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="UW pg. x"&gt;Eric Garber, Lyn Paleo ''Uranian Worlds: A Guide to Alternative Sexuality in Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror'', "Preface" p. x G K Hall: 1983 {{ISBN|0-8161-8573-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, lesbians and gay men became a more visible presence in the SF community and as writers; notable gay authors included [[Joanna Russ]], [[Thomas M. Disch]] and [[Samuel R. Delany]].&lt;ref&gt;Justine Larbalestier Ed., ''Daughters of Earth: Feminist Science Fiction in the Twentieth Century'', "Simians, Cyborgs and Women", Joan Haran, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feminist SF]] authors imagined cultures in which homo- and bisexuality and a variety of gender models were the norm.&lt;ref name="EoSF4"/&gt; [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''[[The Female Man]]'' (1975) and the award-winning story "[[When It Changed]]", showing a female-only lesbian society that flourished without men, were enormously influential.&lt;ref name="UW pg. x"/&gt; Russ is largely responsible for introducing radical lesbian feminism into science fiction;&lt;ref name="UW pg. 118"&gt;Eric Garber, Lyn Paleo ''Uranian Worlds: A Guide to Alternative Sexuality in Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror'', "Joanna Russ", p. 118, G K Hall: 1983 {{ISBN|978-0-8161-1832-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; she has stated that being openly lesbian was bad for her career and sales.&lt;ref name="SFC137" /&gt; Similar themes are explored in [[James Tiptree Jr.]]'s award-winning "[[Houston, Houston, Do You Read?]]"{{Ref label|Note1|d|d}}, which presents a female-only society after the extinction of men from disease. The society lacks stereotypically "male" problems such as war, but is stagnant. The women reproduce via cloning and consider men to be comical. Tiptree was a closeted bisexual woman writing secretly under a male pseudonym,&lt;ref&gt;Alice Sheldon was [[bisexual]]. "I like some men a lot, but from the start, before I knew anything, it was always girls and women who lit me up." Julie Phillips, ''James Tiptree, Jr.: The Double Life of Alice B. Sheldon'', St. Martin's Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houstonvoice.com/2006/9-2/arts/books/books.cfm Houstonvoice.com] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20080804044336/http://www.houstonvoice.com/2006/9-2/arts/books/books.cfm |date=August 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/books/2003173164_tiptree06.html|title=The Seattle Times: Books: "James Tiptree, Jr.": The amazing lives of writer Alice B.

Other feminist utopias do not include lesbianism: [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'' (1969) depicts trans-[[species]] sexuality, in which individuals are neither "male" nor "female" but can have both male and female sexual organs and reproductive abilities, making them in some senses bisexual.&lt;ref name="EoSF4"/&gt; In ''The Language of the Night'', a collection of Le Guin's criticism, she admits to having "quite unnecessarily locked the Gethenians into heterosexuality ... the omission [of the homosexual option] implies that sexuality is heterosexuality. I regret this very much."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/leguin_u.html |title=Glbtq literature: Le Guin, Ursula K |publisher=Glbtq.com |accessdate=2008-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224053710/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/leguin_u.html |archivedate=February 24, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Le Guin often explores alternative sexuality in her works,&lt;ref&gt;Garber &amp; Paleo, "Ursula K Le Guin: Biographical note" p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; and has subsequently written many stories that examine the possibilities SF allows for non-traditional homosexuality,&lt;ref name="Garber1"/&gt; such as the bisexual bonding between clones in "[[Nine Lives (novelette)|Nine Lives]]".{{Ref label|Note1|e|e}}&lt;ref name="encylhomos2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garber &amp; Paleo, "Nine Lives" p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual themes and fluid genders also figure in the works of [[John Varley (author)|John Varley]], who came to prominence in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="EoSF4"/&gt; Many of his stories contain mentions of same-sex love and gay and lesbian characters.&lt;ref&gt;Garber &amp; Paleo, "John Verley: Biographical note" p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; In his "[[Eight Worlds]]" suite of stories and novels, humanity has achieved the ability to change sex on a whim. Homophobia is shown to initially inhibit uptake of this technology, as in his story "Options", as it engenders drastic changes in relationships, with bisexuality eventually becoming the norm for society.&lt;ref&gt;Garber &amp; Paleo, "Options" p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[Gaea trilogy]]'' features lesbian protagonists, and almost all the characters are to some degree bisexual.&lt;ref&gt;Garber &amp; Paleo, "Titan" p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel R. Delany]] was one of the first openly gay science fiction authors;&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Keith Booker, Encyclopedia of Literature and Politics: Censorship, Revolution, and Writing, "Science Fiction" p. 639, 2005, Greenwood Publishing Group, {{ISBN|0-313-33568-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his earliest stories the gay sexual aspect appears as a "sensibility", rather than in overt sexual references. In some stories, such as ''[[Babel-17]]'' (1966), same-sex love and same-sex intercourse are clearly implied but are given a kind of protective colouration because the protagonist is a woman who is involved in a three-person marriage with two men. The affection all three characters share for each other is in the forefront, and sexual activity between or among them is not directly described. In ''[[Dhalgren]]'' (1975), his most famous science fiction novel, Delany peoples his large canvas with characters of a wide variety of sexualities.&lt;ref name="Dhalgrenrev"&gt;David Soyko, "Dhalgren", on-line review (2002) [http://www.sfsite.com/02b/dh122.htm SFSite]&lt;/ref&gt; Once again, sexual activity is not the focus of the novel although there are some of the first explicitly described scenes of gay sex in SF and Delany depicts characters with a wide variety of motivations and behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;David Seed Ed., ''A Companion to Science Fiction'', "Samuel Delany" p. 403, {{ISBN|1-4051-1218-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delany's [[Nebula]]-winning short story "[[Aye, and Gomorrah]]" posits the development of neutered human astronauts and then depicts the people who become sexually oriented toward them. By imagining a new gender and resultant sexual orientation, the story allows readers to reflect on the real world while maintaining an estranging distance. Further award-winning stories featuring gay characters, such as "[[Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones]]", were to follow, all collected in Delany's short story retrospective ''[[Aye, and Gomorrah, and other stories]]''.&lt;ref name="encylhomos2"/&gt; Delany faced censorship from book distribution companies for treatment of these topics.&lt;ref name="EoSF4"/&gt; In later works, gay themes become increasingly central to Delany's works, attracting controversy,&lt;ref&gt;David Seed Ed., ''A Companion to Science Fiction'', "Samuel Delany" p. 404, {{ISBN|1-4051-1218-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some blur the line between science fiction and gay pornography.&lt;ref name="madman"&gt;Delany describes The Mad Man, for example, as a "pornotopic fantasy".{{cite book | last = Delany | first = Samuel R. | authorlink = Samuel R.

Delany's SF series [[Return to Neveryon]] was the first novel from a major US publisher to deal with the impact of AIDS,&lt;ref&gt;Gaétan Brulotte &amp; John Phillips,''Encyclopedia of Erotic Literature', p.324, CRC Press, 2006, {{ISBN|1-57958-441-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he later won the [[William Whitehead Memorial Award]] for lifetime achievement in gay and lesbian writing.&lt;ref&gt;David Seed Ed., ''A Companion to Science Fiction'', "Samuel Delany" p. 399, {{ISBN|1-4051-1218-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most recent gay-themed novel is [[Through the Valley of the Nest of Spiders]].

{{Quote box|width=25%|align=right|quote=&lt;div style="text-align:left;"&gt;Reading over any large body of science fiction referring to gay men and women, one can't avoid seeing it as a system of stereotypes with a few more or less effective tries at a kind of fashionable liberalism&lt;/div&gt;

Other big name SF authors approached LGBT themes in individual works: In ''[[Time Enough for Love]]'' (1973) by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], the main character argues strongly for the future liberty of homosexual sex, but sex for the purpose of procreation remains held as the ideal.&lt;ref name="EoSF4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garber1"&gt;Garber &amp; Paleo, "Time Enough for Love" p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; The female bisexuality in ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' (1961) has been described as mere titillation and male homosexuality in the same work was a "wrongness" deserving pity.&lt;ref&gt;Garber &amp; Paleo, "Stranger in a Strange Land" p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Heinlein's use of sexuality is discussed in an essay entitled "The Embarrassments of Science Fiction" by SF writer [[Thomas Disch]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Nicholls, ''Science Fiction at Large'', "Thomas Disch", "The Embarrassments of Science Fiction", Harper &amp; Row: 1976 ISBN&lt;/ref&gt; Disch was publicly gay from 1968; this came out occasionally in his poetry and particularly in his novel ''[[On Wings of Song (Disch novel)|On Wings of Song]]'' (1979). His other major SF novels also contained bisexual characters: in his [[mosaic novel]] ''[[334 (novel)|334]]'', gay people are referred to as "republicans" in contrast to the straight "democrats".

[[Michael Moorcock]] was one of the first scifi authors to depict positive portrayals of homosexual, lesbian and bisexual relationships and sex in his novels. For example, in his 1965 novel, [[The Final Programme]], most of the leading characters, including the central 'hero' Jerry Cornelius, engage in same sex relationships on multiple occasions and same sex relationships are depicted as entirely normal and without any moralising, negative consequences or gratuitous titillation, this is the case in the whole Jerry Cornelius series and in Moorcock's fiction generally (particularly in the Dancers at the End of Time series) sexuality is seen as polymorphic and fluid rather than based in fixed identities and gender roles.

{{Quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=&lt;div style="text-align:left;"&gt;Lesbians and gay men have become less alien in the world of SF in the last little while; we have, indeed, experienced a minor boom in the publishing of stories of 'alternative sexuality'.

After the pushing back of boundaries in the 1960s and 1970s, homosexuality gained much wider tolerance, and was often incorporated into otherwise conventional SF stories with little comment. This was helped by the growing number of openly gay or lesbian authors,&lt;ref name="encylhomos2"/&gt; such as [[David Gerrold]], [[Geoff Ryman]],&lt;ref name="ryman1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.locusmag.com/2006/Issues/01Ryman.html |title=Geoff Ryman: The Mundane Fantastic |date = January 2006|journal=[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicola Griffith]] and [[Melissa Scott (writer)|Melissa Scott]],&lt;ref name= MSinterv&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.locusmag.com/1999/Issues/01/Scott.html |title=Melissa Scott: Of Masks &amp; Metaphors |accessdate=2008-11-18 |year= 1999 |work=Locus Online |publisher=Locus Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; and transgender writers such as [[Jessica Amanda Salmonson]],&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M.

A number of [[List of gay SF#Themed anthologies|LGBT-themed anthologies]] of speculative short fiction have been published since the 1980s, the first being the science fiction-themed ''Kindred Spirits'' (1984), edited by Jeffrey M. Elliot. These anthologies often focus on particular sexual identities, such as the ''New Exploits of Lesbians'' series with titles in the fantasy (''Magical lesbians'', ''Fairy-tale lesbians'') and horror (''Twilight lesbians'') areas. Others are grouped around particular genres, such as the award-winning ''[[Bending the Landscape]]'' series edited by Nicola Griffith and Stephen Pagel, in which each of the three volumes focus upon [[Bending the Landscape#Bending the Landscape: Science Fiction|science fiction]], [[Bending the Landscape#Bending the Landscape: Fantasy|fantasy]] or [[Bending the Landscape#Bending the Landscape: Horror|horror]]; or the horror-oriented ''Queer Fear'' anthologies, edited by [[Michael Rowe]].

[[David Gerrold]] is an openly gay science fiction writer with a number of LGBT themed works.

Gerrold received a [[Nebula award]] for a semi-autobiographical short story "[[The Martian Child]]" (1994), in which a gay man adopts a child.

[[Geoff Ryman]] wrote several award-winning novels and short stories that prominently feature LGBT characters: The protagonist of ''[[The Child Garden]]'' (1989), an outsider because of her resistance to genetic manipulation and her lesbianism, enters into a relationship with a similarly outcast lesbian polar bear. ''[[Lust (Ryman novel)|Lust]]'' (2001) follows a gay man who finds that his sexual fantasies are magically coming true. ''[[Was (novel)|Was]]'' (1992) includes a gay actor with AIDS and a mentally challenged abused child, linked by their connection to ''The Wizard of Oz'' [[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|books]] and [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|film]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Damien Broderick]], ''Transrealist fiction: Writing in the Slipstream of Science'', p.92&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''Locus'' magazine interview Ryman claimed that the gay and SF genre markets are incompatible: “In 1990, if you had asked me which was the worst thing to be labeled as, gay or an SF writer, I'd have said gay: kills you stone-dead in the market. Then ''Was'' came out.... They had it in the gay section of bookstores and they had stuff in gay magazines, but they didn't say SF — at which point I realized that being a science fiction writer is worse than being gay."&lt;ref name="ryman1"/&gt;

The author describes an inverted world in which mixed-sex marriages are forbidden.  Conception occurs in test tubes. In lesbian families, one of the women carries the child.  Gay male couples turn to surrogate mothers to bring their children to term.  The Netherlands is the only country where mixed-sex marriages are permitted.  In this world intimacy between the opposite sexes is rejected, world history and the classics of world literature have been falsified in order to support the ideology of the homosexual world.

For much of the 20th century, gay relationships were discouraged from being shown in comics which were seen mainly as directed towards children. Until 1989, the [[Comics Code Authority]] (CCA), which imposed ''de facto'' censorship on comics sold through [[news stand]]s in the United States, forbade any suggestion of homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nyberg |first=Amy Kiste |title=Seal of Approval: The History of the Comics Code |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |year=1998 |location=Jackson |pages=143, 175–176 |isbn=0-87805-975-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists had to drop subtle hints while not stating directly a character's orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cagle.msnbc.com/hogan/features/out/out.asp |title=Hogan's Alley |publisher=Cagle.msnbc.com |accessdate=2008-11-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002083335/http://cagle.msnbc.com/hogan/features/out/out.asp |archivedate=October 2, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overt gay and lesbian themes were first found in [[underground comics|underground]] and [[alternative comics|alternative]] titles which did not carry the CCA's seal of approval.

The CCA came into being in response to [[Fredric Wertham]]'s ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'', in which comic book creators were accused of attempting to negatively influence children with images of violence and sexuality, including subliminal homosexuality. Wertham claimed Wonder Woman's strength and independence made her a lesbian,&lt;ref&gt;Wertham, Fredric (1954) ''Seduction of the Innocent'', pp. 192 and 234–235, Rinehart &amp; Company, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that "The Batman type of story may stimulate children to homosexual fantasies."&lt;ref name=Batman/&gt;

In recent years the number of LGBT characters has increased greatly in mainstream superhero comics; however, LGBT characters continue to be relegated to supporting roles, and generate criticism for the treatment gay characters receive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterelton.com/print/2006/10/gaycomics.html |title=Gay Comics 101 |work=Afterelton.com |author=Joe Palmer |accessdate=2008-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322195553/http://www.afterelton.com/print/2006/10/gaycomics.html |archivedate=March 22, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marvel===
[[Alpha Flight]]'s [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]] was the first major gay character in the Marvel universe and remains the most famous gay character in mainstream comics. Created by [[Marvel Comics]] in 1979 as a member of the original Alpha Flight superhero team, Northstar's sexual identity was hinted at early in his history, in 1983 in issues 7 and 8 of ''Alpha Flight'', but not openly stated; his apparent lack of interest in women was chalked up to his obsessive drive to win as a ski champion.&lt;ref name=northstar&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gayleague.com/gay/characters/display.php?id=1 |title=Gay League&amp;nbsp;– Northstar |publisher=Gayleague.com |accessdate=2008-11-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080404084547/http://www.gayleague.com/gay/characters/display.php?id=1 |archivedate = April 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='rzero'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rzero.com/books/gaysuperfull.html |title=Beek's Books&amp;nbsp;– Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Superheroes |publisher=Rzero.com |accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character was finally revealed to be gay in 1992's ''Alpha Flight'' issue 106 and his outing made national headlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterelton.com/print/2008/1/tenbestscificharacters?page=0%2C2 |title=Ten Best Gay and Bisexual Science Fiction Characters &amp;#124; AfterElton.com |publisher=Afterelton.com |author=Marc |accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[Marvel Comics]] revived ''[[The Rawhide Kid]]'' in their [[MAX (comics)|Marvel MAX]] imprint,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/12/11/entertainment/main532702.shtml |title=Comic Book First: Gay Gunslinger, Marvel Comics 'Rawhide Kid' To Bring Style, Wit To West |work=[[CBS News]] |accessdate=2008-10-09 | date=December 11, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; introducing the first openly gay comic book character to star in his own magazine.&lt;ref name='CNN rawhide'&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/12/09/rawhide.kid.gay/ |title=Marvel Comics to unveil gay gunslinger |date=December 9, 2002 |work=[[CNN]] |accessdate=2008-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228173809/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/12/09/rawhide.kid.gay/ |archivedate=February 28, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition of the Rawhide Kid's gay saga was called ''Slap Leather''. According to a CNN. com article, the character's sexuality is conveyed indirectly, through euphemisms and puns, and the comic's style is [[wikt:campy|campy]].&lt;ref name='CNN rawhide'/&gt; Conservative groups quickly protested the gay take on the character and claimed that children would be corrupted by it, and the covers carried an "Adults only" label.

Marvel's policy had stated that all series emphasizing solo gay characters must carry an "Adults Only" label, in response to conservative protests. But in 2006, Marvel editor-in-chief [[Joe Quesada]] claimed that this policy was no longer in force,&lt;ref name=washblade&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washblade.com/print.cfm?content_id=9119 |title=Washington Blade Online |publisher=Washblade.com |accessdate=2008-11-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070319230657/http://www.washblade.com/print.cfm?content_id=9119 |archivedate = March 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Marvel received [[GLAAD]]'s 2005 Best Comic Book Award for its superhero comic book ''[[Young Avengers]]'', which included gay characters but was published as a mainstream book with no warning label.&lt;ref name=washblade/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glaad.org/media/release_detail.php?id=3896 |title=List of winners: 17th Annual GLAAD Media Awards |accessdate=2008-11-17 |work= [[GLAAD]]|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071019105648/http://www.glaad.org/media/release_detail.php?id=3896 |archivedate = October 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, despite protests, Marvel published an issue of Astonishing X-Men in which Northstar married his partner, Kyle.

===DC===
DC often still draws criticism for its use of stereotypes for LGBT characters. [[Firebrand (DC Comics)|Firebrand]], a superhero debuting in 1941, is thought by some to be an early example, with his pink or transparent costume.&lt;ref name=firebrand&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radaronline.com/features/2008/07/unlikely_superheroes_black_panther_elongated_man_rawhide_kid-print.php|title=Radar Online – Hottest Celebrity Gossip &amp; Entertainment News|work=Radar Online|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804083136/http://www.radaronline.com/features/2008/07/unlikely_superheroes_black_panther_elongated_man_rawhide_kid-print.php|archivedate=August 4, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer Roy Thomas penned thought balloons that suggested Firebrand had been involved in a gay relationship with his sidekick and bodyguard Slugger Dunn,&lt;ref name=firebrand/&gt; although these hints never moved beyond subtext. A more modern example is the violent vigilante superhero [[Midnighter]]. The Batman-like Midnighter was shown as being in a relationship with the Superman-like Apollo during their time as members of the superhero team The Authority.&lt;ref name="Lendrum"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal for the Arts, Sciences, and Technology |volume=2 |issue=2 |date=2004 |last=Lendrum |first=Rob |title=Queering Super-Manhood: The Gay Superhero in Contemporary Mainstream Comic Books |publisher=Concordia University |url=http://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/202/300/gr_jrn_arts_sci/v3/pdf/V.2-2PDF/v22_lendrum.pdf |accessdate=2007-10-07 |quote="When Batman and Superman team up they are called 'the World's Finest.'

[[File:Batbed.png|left|thumb|[[Bruce Wayne]] and [[Dick Grayson]]. Panel from ''[[Batman]]'' No. 84 (June 1954), page 24.]]
In addition to true LGBT characters, there has been controversy over various homosexual interpretations of the most famous superhero comic book characters. [[Batman]]'s relationship with [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] has [[Batman#Gay interpretations|famously]] come under scrutiny, in spite of the majority of creators associated with the creator denying that the character is gay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://comicsbulletin.com/batman-gay/ |title=Is Batman Gay? |last= Donald |first=Alan |date=2 February 2002 |website=comicsbulletin.com |access-date=27 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201072032/http://www.comicsbulletin.com/panel/106070953757230.htm |archive-date=1 December 2008 |dead-url=no |quote=if you think Batman's gay, then I'm sure he is … when YOU'RE reading his stories.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist Fredric Wertham, who in ''Seduction of the Innocent'' asserted that "Batman stories are psychologically homosexual", claimed to find a "subtle atmosphere of homoeroticism which pervades the adventures of the mature 'Batman' and his young friend 'Robin'".&lt;ref name=Batman&gt;Wertham, Fredric. ''Seduction of the Innocent''. Rinehart and Company, Inc., 1954. pg. 189–90&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been claimed that Batman is interesting to gay audiences because "he was one of the first fictional characters to be attacked on the grounds of his presumed homosexuality," and "the 1960s TV series remains a touchstone of camp."&lt;ref&gt;Medhurst, Andy. "Batman, Deviance, and Camp." ''The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media''. Routledge: London, 1991. {{ISBN|0-85170-276-7}}, pg. 150&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] has described the relationship between Batman and [[Joker (character)|the Joker]] as a "homophobic nightmare",&lt;ref name=sharret&gt;Sharrett, Christopher. "Batman and the Twilight of the Idols: An Interview with Frank Miller." ''The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media''. Routledge: London, 1991. {{ISBN|0-85170-276-7}}, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt; he views the character as sublimating his sexual urges into crime fighting.&lt;ref name=sharret/&gt;

Some continue to play off the homosexual interpretations of Batman. One notable example occurred in 2000, when DC Comics refused to allow permission for the reprinting of four panels (from ''Batman'' #79, 92, 105 and 139) to illustrate Christopher York's paper ''All in the Family: Homophobia and Batman Comics in the 1950s''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beatty |first=Bart |title=Don't Ask, Don't Tell: How Do You Illustrate an Academic Essay about Batman and Homosexuality? |journal=The Comics Journal |year=2000 |volume= |issue=228 |pages=17–18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another happened in the summer of 2005, when painter Mark Chamberlain displayed a number of watercolors depicting both Batman and Robin in suggestive and sexually explicit poses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mark Chamberlain (American, 1967) |publisher=Artnet |url=http://www.artnet.com/Galleries/Artists_detail.asp?G=&amp;gid=423822183&amp;which=&amp;aid=424157172&amp;ViewArtistBy=online&amp;rta=http://www.artnet.com/ag/fulltextsearch.asp?searchstring=Mark+Chamberlain}}&lt;/ref&gt; DC threatened both artist and the Kathleen Cullen Fine Arts gallery with legal action if they did not cease selling the works and demanded all remaining art, as well as any profits derived from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gallery told to drop 'gay' Batman |date=August 19, 2005 |work=[[BBC News Online]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4167032.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of DC's gay characters, such as Obsidian and Renee Montoya, were changed or essentially erased in [[The New 52]] reboot of 2011. Meanwhile, others, such as Kate Kane, were given far less attention than before the reboot. In 2012 DC announced that an "iconic" character would now be gay in the new DC universe. It was then revealed that [[Alan Scott]], the original Green Lantern was that character. This led to fan outcry because his status as "iconic" is debatable, and he does not actually exist in the mainstream DC universe. This also effectively meant that the already gay character, Obsidian, could not exist as he was Alan Scott's child.

===Manga===
[[Yaoi]] and [[Yuri (genre)|Yuri]] (also known as ''Boys' Love'' and ''Girls' Love,'' respectively, as well as ''Shōnen-ai'' and ''Shōjo-ai'' in the West, although these are not used in Japan due to pedophilic undertones) are Japanese genres which have homosexual romance themes, across a variety of media. Yaoi and yuri have spread beyond Japan: both translated and original yaoi and yuri is now available in many countries and languages. The characters of yaoi and yuri do not tend to self-identify as homosexual or bisexual.&lt;ref name="bonking"&gt;McLelland, Mark.

There is also a style of manga called [[Bara (genre)|Bara]], which is typically written by gay men for a gay male adult audience. Bara often has more realistic themes than yaoi and is more likely to acknowledge homophobia and the taboo nature of homosexuality in Japan. While western commentators sometimes group bara and yaoi together, writers and fans consider them separate genres.&lt;ref name='Suchio on yaoi'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csuchico.edu/~mtoku/vc/Articles/toku/Wil_Toku_BoysLove.html|title="Boys' Love," Yaoi, and Art Education: Issues of Power and Pedagogy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and television==
In general, speculative fiction on television and film has lagged behind literature in its portrayals of homosexuality.&lt;ref name=lesbmom1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afterellen.com/TV/2007/10/topscifimoments |title=Top Lesbian SciFi Moments |accessdate=2008-11-25 |year=2007 |work=[[AfterEllen.com and AfterElton.com|AfterEllen.com]] |quote=Beginning in the '70s in books, the '80s in movies and the '90s on TV, lesbian and bisexual characters and delightfully queer moments have appeared with increasing frequency. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130116081755/http://www.afterellen.com/TV/2007/10/topscifimoments |archivedate=January 16, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual relationships in major speculative fiction franchises have generally been depicted as heterosexual in nature. Inter-species and inter-ethnic relationships have been commonly depicted, while homosexual relationships and transgender characters are more rare.

===Film===
LGBT characters in films began to appear more regularly only in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=lesbmom1/&gt; Films in the late 1920s and early 1930s reflected the liberal attitudes of the day and could include [[sexual innuendo]]s and references to homosexuality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=LaSalle, Mick | title=Dangerous Men: Pre-Code Hollywood and the Birth of the Modern Man | work=[[Thomas Dunne Books]] | year=2002 | isbn=0-312-28311-3 | publisher=Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Press | location=New York, N.Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but from the 1930s until 1968 the film industry in the US followed the [[Production Code]]. The code spelled out what was [[public morality|morally acceptable]] for a public audience; references to sexual "perversions" such as homosexuality were forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artsreformation.com/a001/hays-code.html |title=The Motion Picture Production Code of 1930 (Hays Code) |publisher=Artsreformation.com |accessdate=2008-11-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222092920/http://artsreformation.com/a001/hays-code.html |archive-date=February 22, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://productioncode.dhwritings.com/container.php |title=The Production Code of the Motion Picture Industry (1930–1967) |accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtually all motion pictures produced in the United States adhered to the code,&lt;ref name="Doherty"&gt;Doherty, Thomas [http://my.brandeis.edu/news/item?news_item_id=105052&amp;show_release_date=1 "The Code Before 'Da Vinci'"] ''[[Washington Post]]'' (May 20, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and similar censorship was common in other countries, for example an early version of the first [[lesbian vampire]] film ''[[Dracula's Daughter]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Monsters and Mad Scientists: A Cultural History of the Horror Movie |last=Tudor |first=Andrew |page= 31 |year=1989 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |isbn=0-631-16992-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; a film described in ''[[The Celluloid Closet]]'' as presenting "homosexuality as a predatory weakness",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Celluloid Closet: Homosexuality in the Movies (revised edition) |last=Russo |first=Vito |authorlink= |page=48 |year=1987 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York |isbn=0-06-096132-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; was rejected by the [[British Board of Film Censors]] in 1935, who said in part "...''Dracula's Daughter'' would require half a dozen ... languages to adequately express its beastliness.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Hidden Cinema: British Film Censorship in Action, 1913–1975 |last=Robertson|first=James Crighton|authorlink= |author2=Ray Broadus Browne  |pages=65–6|year=1993 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=0-415-09034-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horror author [[Anne Rice]] has named ''Dracula's Daughter'' as a direct inspiration for her own [[homoerotic]] vampire fiction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Gothic World of Anne Rice |last=Hoppenstand |first=Gary |authorlink= |author2=Ray Broadus Browne  |page=14|year=1996 |publisher=Popular Press | isbn=0-87972-708-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; naming a bar in her novel ''[[Queen of the Damned]]'' "Dracula's Daughter" in honor of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Skal | first=David J. | title=Bloodsuckers and Cocksuckers: A Glossary of Vampirism and Sex | work=Bright Lights Film Journal No. 15 | page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Films produced under such censorship could only introduce homosexuality as a disguised undercurrent, and still flirted with controversy in doing so, such as in the cult horror film ''[[White Zombie (film)|White Zombie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Monsters in the Closet: Homosexuality and the Horror Film |last=Benshoff |first=Harry M. |publisher=Manchester University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=White Zombie: Anatomy of a Horror Film |last=Don Rhodes |first=Gary |page=210 |year=2001 |publisher=McFarland |location=US |isbn=0-7864-0988-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The less stringent rules of the post-Hayes film industry allowed sexuality to be more open, and cinema as a whole became more sexually explicit from the 1980s in particular,&lt;ref name="EoSF4"/&gt; but aimed to purely to entertain rather than exploring underlying sexual dynamics. Much of the sex in speculative fiction film is merely intended to titillate;&lt;ref name="EoSF4"/&gt; a review of fantasy films identified 10–15% as softcore pornography.&lt;ref&gt;Clute &amp; Grant, p.xxx, "Pornography"&lt;/ref&gt; but it remained rare to see gay characters in speculative fiction films. Horror films, that had sex as one of their major preoccupations, continued to be more leniently censored, due to the perception of being unserious and lightweight. Vampires in particular have been described as obvious erotic metaphors and as a result, numerous vampire films since the 1970s strongly imply or explicitly show lesbianism, following the inspiration of [[lesbian vampire]] story ''[[Carmilla]]''.&lt;ref name=DR/&gt; The prototypical Hollywood vampire, [[Dracula]], was shown to be openly gay in the spoof film ''Does Dracula Suck?'' in 1969.&lt;ref name=DR&gt;{{cite book |title=Dark Romance: Sexuality in the Horror Film |last=Hogan |first=David J. |chapter=Lugosi, Lee, and the Vampires |pages=146–163|year=1997 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=0-7864-0474-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gay genre films remain rare,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afterelton.com/movies/2008/12/yearingaymovies?page=0%2C0 The Year in Gay Movies], ''[[AfterEllen.com and AfterElton.com|AfterElton.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and science fiction films' inclusion of gay characters continues to relegate them to supporting roles, such as the "stereotypical, limp-wristed, frantic homosexual" minor character played by [[Harvey Fierstein]] in the 1996 blockbuster ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Alternate Americas: Science Fiction Film and American Culture |last=Booker |first=M.

Tauris |isbn=1-85043-806-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also interesting to note that the film's director, [[Roland Emmerich]], is openly gay. Still there are some curious cases like Cthulhu (2007) a horror/thriller film based on the works of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], in which the main character is gay but it isn't the main thing, although it is important in the development of the character's psychology. The film is plagued with monsters and disturbing happenings. Also, in ''[[V for Vendetta (film)|V for Vendetta]]'' there are two secondary characters – one gay, one lesbian – shown as victims of the totalitarian [[dystopia]]. 2012 saw the light of the epic [[Wachowskis]] + [[Tom Tykwer]] blockbuster, ''[[Cloud Atlas (film)|Cloud Atlas]]'', featuring in one of the six stories a couple of gay characters.

===Television===
LGBT characters began appearing on television with increasing frequency only in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=lesbmom1/&gt; The 1994 television science fiction show, [[Babylon 5]] introduced a bisexual character, [[Susan Ivanova]] whose relationship with a fellow female telepath was revealed in season 2 (1995). Advocate magazine called this relationship out as the closest that the Star Trek franchise or any "Star Trek clone," as he called the show, had come to a "gay creature—much less a gay human being."&lt;ref name="advocate-b5"&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TGQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA7&amp;q=%22babylon%205%22%20same-sex |title=Gaywatch |journal=The Advocate |author=Vilanch, Bruce |date=January 21, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babylon 5 continued to explore the state of same-sex relationships in the future with the introduction of a male-male marriage and subsequent honeymoon as cover for two of the main characters who were on a covert mission to a Mars colony in season 4.&lt;ref name="showtime-b5"&gt;{{cite book |title=It's show time!: media, politics, and popular culture |author=Schultz, David Andrew |year=2000 |page=92 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fgVpAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22babylon+5%22+same-sex+mars |isbn=978-0-8204-4135-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' fantasy television series introduced its main characters, [[Xena]] and [[Gabrielle (Xena)|Gabrielle]], as close companions; fan speculation about lesbian overtones led to them becoming lesbian icons, although the lesbian content remained at the [[subtext]] level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterellen.com/TV/xena.html |title=Xena and Gabrielle: Lesbian Icons |work=Afterellen.com |author=Angie Beauchamp |accessdate=2008-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019015939/http://www.afterellen.com/TV/xena.html |archivedate=October 19, 2006 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lesbmom3&gt;{{cite web |author=Silver |date=October 14, 2007 |url=http://www.afterellen.com/TV/2007/10/topscifimoments?page=0%2C3 |title=The Top 11 Lesbian/Bi Moments in Sci Fi and Fantasy |work=Afterellen.com |accessdate=2008-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130116215338/http://www.afterellen.com/TV/2007/10/topscifimoments?page=0,3 |archivedate=January 16, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series has been cited as "trail-blazing" and breaking down barriers, allowing the production of subsequent programming such as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cathyyoung.net/features/whatweowexena.html |title=What We Owe Xena |work=Cathyyoung.net |accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; which introduced a number of LGBT characters. The most famous is the major character, [[Willow Rosenberg|Willow]] and her partners [[Tara Maclay|Tara]] and [[Kennedy (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afterellen.com/TV/buffy-end.html |title=How "Buffy" Changed the World of Lesbians on Television |publisher=Afterellen.com |author=Sarah Warn |accessdate=2008-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017093306/http://www.afterellen.com/TV/buffy-end.html |archivedate=October 17, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although praised for their "healthy relationship" and being the first lesbian relationship between major characters on prime-time television, others criticised the use of witchcraft as a metaphor for lesbian sex.&lt;ref name=warriorwomen104/&gt; Tara's death directly after reconciliatory sex with Willow caused an outcry among the LGBT community, who saw it as a "homophobic cliché".&lt;ref name=warriorwomen104&gt;{{cite book |title=The Warrior Women of Television: A Feminist Cultural Analysis of the New Female Body in Popular |last=Heinecken |first=Dawn |year=2003 |publisher=Peter Lang |page=104 |isbn=978-0-8204-6219-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Wells]], a recurring villain and eventual ally, was strongly implied to be gay, although closeted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afterelton.com/print/2008/1/tenbestscificharacters?page=0%2C0 |title=Ten Best Gay and Bisexual Science Fiction Characters |accessdate=2008-11-25 |year=2008 |publisher=AfterElton.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was influential on subsequent television speculative fiction, including ''Torchwood''.&lt;ref name="buffy"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Rawson-Jones |title=Davies: 'Buffy', 'Angel' inspired 'Torchwood' |url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/article/ds38295.html?rss |work=[[Digital Spy]] |date=October 17, 2006 |accessdate=2006-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="walker"&gt;{{cite book |last=Walker |first=Stephen James |authorlink=Stephen James Walker |title=Inside the Hub: The Unofficial and Unauthorised Guide to Torchwood Series One |year=2007 |publisher=Telos Publishing |location=[[Tolworth]] |isbn=978-1-84583-013-7 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series won a number of LGBT themed awards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectrumawards.org/2001.htm|title=Gaylactic Spectrum Awards – 2001 Information|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was regarded as groundbreaking in its portrayal of gay youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/42996/buffy-the-vampire-slayer2/ |title=Popmatter: Buffy the Vampire Slavyer |accessdate=2008-11-25 |date=2001–2008 |work=PopMatters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1582835/story.jhtml |title=Buffy The Vampire Slayer in Gay Romance For Next Comic Book Arc |accessdate=2008-11-25 |last=Vineyard |first=Jennifer |year=2008 |publisher=[[MTV Networks]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Torchwood]]'' is a British science fiction drama television programme, part of the long-running ''[[Doctor Who]]'' franchise, which began airing in 2006 on [[BBC Three]]. The series explores [[Themes in Torchwood|several themes]] in its narrative, in particular [[LGBT]] themes. Various characters are portrayed as sexually fluid; through those characters, the series examines homosexual and [[bisexuality|bisexual]] relationships. Although the nature of their sexual flexibility is not explicitly discussed, the characters offer varying perspectives on orientation,&lt;ref name="gay times"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=Daniel |date=October 2006 |title=Jack of Hearts |journal=[[Gay Times]] |issue=337}}&lt;/ref&gt; with ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' describing all of the characters on ''Torchwood'' as bisexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/article64139.ece |title=Dr Ooh gets four gay pals |accessdate=2006-10-06 |author=Sarah Nathan |date=September 2006 |work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] |quote=Gay ''Doctor Who'' star John Barrowman gets four bisexual assistants in raunchy BBC3 spin-off ''Torchwood''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Series creator [[Russell T Davies]] has said that he hopes to defy audience expectations of [[monosexuality|monosexual]] characters: "Without making it political or dull, this is going to be a very bisexual programme. I want to knock down the barriers so we can't define which of the characters is gay. We need to start mixing things up, rather than thinking, 'This is a gay character and he'll only ever go off with men.'"&lt;ref name="gay times"/&gt;
Davies has also described [[Jack Harkness]] as [[omnisexual]]: "He'll shag anything with a hole. Jack doesn't categorise people: if he fancies you, he'll do it with you."&lt;ref name="metro2"&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Williams |title=60 Second Interview: John Barrowman |url= http://www.metro.co.uk/fame/interviews/article.html?in_article_id=23649&amp;in_page_id=11 |work=[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]] |date=November 2, 2006 |accessdate=November 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inclusion of significant LGBT characters in modern speculative fiction television series has not been universal. For example, the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise's [[Sexuality in Star Trek|lack of same-sex relationships]] has long been a sore spot with LGBT fandom,&lt;ref name= WP2/&gt;&lt;ref name="GLBCoST"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webpan.com/dsinclair/trek.html |title=Gay, Lesbian &amp; Bisexual Characters on Star Trek – a 12-year saga of deceit, lies, excuses and broken promises |author=D.

They also point out that [[Gene Roddenberry]] had made statements in later life favourable to acceptance of homosexuality and the portrayal of same-sex relationships in ''Star Trek'', but that the franchise's coverage has remained meagre.&lt;ref name="GLBCoST"/&gt;

Within the ''Star Trek'' [[canon (fiction)|canon]], there have been no officially recognized LGBT characters in the television [[spin-off (media)|spin-offs]].  ''The International Review of Science Fiction'' ran a feature entitled "Prisoners of Dogma and Prejudice: Why There Are no G/L/B/T Characters in Star Trek: Deep Space 9"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Science Fiction Foundation: Foundation #86 |publisher=SF-foundation.org |year=2001 |url=http://www.sf-foundation.org/publications/foundation/backissues/fou86.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050427211136/http://www.sf-foundation.org/publications/foundation/backissues/fou86.html |archivedate=April 27, 2005 |accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[gender identity]] has occasionally been treated as an "issue" within the new ''Star Trek'' series, to be dealt with as a theme in individual episodes, such as the 1995 ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episode "[[Rejoined]]", which was the first episode of the show to feature a same-sex relationship and romantic same-sex kiss between women. Subsequently, the ''Star Trek'' franchise has portrayed a few same-sex kisses, but always in the context of either the evil "mirror universe" ("[[The Emperor's New Cloak]]") or body possession ("[[Warlord]]" and others), and often for comedic purposes between otherwise heterosexual characters. In a 2000 ''Fandom ''interview, ''Star Trek'' screenwriter [[Ronald D. Moore]] suggested that the reason why no gay characters existed in the television franchise was because someone wanted it that way, and no amount of support from fans, cast or crew was going to make any difference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webpan.com/dsinclair/moore.html Frank Statements by Ronald D.

In 2005 the television series ''[[Dante's Cove]]'' premiered on the [[here!]] cable station. The series included both gay and lesbian couples dealing with supernatural situations in the coastal town of the same name. The following year, [[Syfy]] premiered the series ''[[Eureka (U.S. TV series)|Eureka]]''. The series spotlighted a fictional town in Oregon that consisted almost entirely of geniuses. This included the town's café owner Vincent, who also happened to be gay.

[[HBO]] brought then new series ''[[True Blood]]'' to the forefront of gay genre television, introducing a variety of omnisexual characters to the small screen in 2008 including: Lafayette Reynolds (played by [[Nelsan Ellis]]), Jesus Velasquez (played by [[Kevin Alejandro]]), Tara Thornton (played by [[Rutina Wesley]]), Pam Swynford De Beaufort (played by [[Kristin Bauer van Straten]]), Eddie Gauthier (played by [[Stephen Root]]), Russell Edgington (played by [[Denis O'Hare]]), and Rev. Steve Newlin (played by [[Michael McMillian]]).

[[Stargate Universe]] in 2009 became the first space-based science fiction show to feature an openly gay character in its primary cast, which was "Camille Wray" played by [[Ming-Na]]. "Wray" was also the first gay character in the franchise and the first primary lesbian Asian-American character on primetime television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Warn |first=Sarah |title=Best.

In 2009 the series ''[[Warehouse 13]]'' premiered on the [[Syfy]] cable network. The series later introduced a character named Steve Jinks, played by actor [[Aaron Ashmore]], a gay government agent assigned to assist in the containment of bizarre artifacts.

In 2010 a cable series prequel to ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' was introduced titled ''[[Caprica (TV series)|Caprica]]''. The series highlighted a world in which same-sex marriage was common. One of the central characters named Sam Adama, played by [[Sasha Roiz]], had a husband named Larry, played by Julius Chapple.

In 2011 the cable station [[Syfy]] premiered the series ''[[Being Human (North American TV series)|Being Human]]'', an Americanized version of the previously released British series of the same name. A lesbian character named Emily Levison, played by actress [[Alison Louder]], was introduced as the sister to one of the main characters. That same year the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] cable series ''[[American Horror Story]]'' highlighted gay ghost couple Chad Warwick and Patrick, played by [[Zachary Quinto]] and [[Teddy Sears]]. The [[HBO]] cable station premiered ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', based on the book series of the same name. The series included gay couple Renly Baratheon and Loras Tyrell, played by actors [[Gethin Anthony]] and [[Finn Jones]]. [[MTV]] also premiered the cable series ''[[Teen Wolf (2011 TV series)|Teen Wolf]]'' that same year. One of the characters depicted is an out gay high school [[lacrosse]] player named Danny Mahealani, played by [[Keahu Kahuanui]].

===Slash fiction===

==Reaction of the speculative fiction community==
There has been a long history of tolerance of LGBT people in SF fandom. The presence of gay members was noted by attendees of early conventions, but generally not discussed — the idea that gay or lesbian members would seek recognition within the SF community was "unthinkable," and an accusation in the 1940s by a fanzine editor that the Los Angeles Science Fiction Association was "full of gay members" caused a scandal in fan circles.&lt;ref name="SFC137" /&gt;&lt;ref name=SFC136&gt;Bacon-Smith, p.136&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent SF fan [[Forrest Ackerman]] is regarded as one of the first members of fandom to openly support the gay and lesbian movements. He was known for writing early lesbian fiction and aided in the publication of ''The Ladder'', the journal of the recently formed lesbian group the [[Daughters of Bilitis]].&lt;ref name=SFC136/&gt; He claims the group named him an honorary lesbian for his support, and to have pseudonymously written the earliest work of "lesbian SF" in 1947 in ''Vice Versa'', the lesbian fanzine edited by [[Lisa Ben]].&lt;ref name=SFC136/&gt;

As the number of works featuring LGBT characters increased, so did the visibility of LGBT fans. At least as early as the 1980 [[Worldcon]] ([[38th World Science Fiction Convention|Noreascon Two]]), there were gatherings of gay and gay-friendly members of the SF community, including [[Samuel R. Delany]], [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]] and [[Melissa Scott (writer)|Melissa Scott]].&lt;ref name=SFC139&gt;Bacon-Smith, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; However, such meetings did not necessarily indicate whole-hearted acceptance within the fan community, and gay and lesbian fans were not regarded as a unified interest group. Informal gatherings at conferences and the attempted creation of a newsletter for LGBT fans drew little notice.&lt;ref name=SFC140&gt;Bacon-Smith, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

Networking between gay fans continued, finally coalescing at the 1986 Worldcon into a plan of action. This led to the first [[Gaylaxicon]] [[science fiction convention]] being held in 1988 and subsequently to the creation of the [[Gaylactic Network]] and the [[Gaylactic Spectrum Awards]] by the [[science fiction fandom|science fiction community]].&lt;ref name=SFC140/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaylacticnetwork.org/ |title=Welcome to the Gaylactic Network |work=GaylacticnNetwork.org |date=July 31, 2008 |accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfwa.org/news/00gaylac.htm |title=2000 Gaylactic Network Spectrum Awards |work=[[Science Fiction Writers of America]] |accessdate=2008-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220171028/http://www.sfwa.org/news/00gaylac.htm |archivedate=February 20, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue282/news.html |title=Science Fiction News of the Week |publisher=Scifi.com |accessdate=2008-10-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080514001314/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue282/news.html |archivedate = May 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gay-themed discussions are now a staple at conventions such as [[WisCon]]; for example, WisCon 30 featured a panel discussing "Why Women Write About Gay Men", and the 38th World Science Fiction Convention in Boston had a discussion panel entitled "The Closed Open Mind – Homophobia in Science Fiction and Fantasy Stories".&lt;ref name="UW pg. xviii"/&gt;

Other SF authors, such as [[Orson Scott Card]], have been criticised by the LGBT community for their works or opinions, which have been described as homophobic.&lt;ref&gt;"Orson Scott Card Draws Gay Protest", 'Science Fiction Chronicles'' '''13'''(6), March 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some lesbian science fiction is targeted specifically to a lesbian audience, rather than science fiction fans, and published by small feminist or [[lesbian fiction]] presses such as [[Bella Books]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/Print/2006/7/publishing2.html |title=AfterEllen.com&amp;nbsp;– A Survey of the Lesbian Fiction Publishing Industry |publisher=Afterellen.com |accessdate=2008-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120630025539/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.afterellen.com%2Farchive%2Fellen%2FPrint%2F2006%2F7%2Fpublishing2.html |archivedate=June 30, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bellabooks.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=SUBS&amp;Store_Code=bella |title=Bella Books &amp; Distribution |publisher=Bellabooks.com |accessdate=2008-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222174234/http://www.bellabooks.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=SUBS&amp;Store_Code=bella |archivedate=December 22, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bold Strokes Books]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boldstrokesbooks.com/|title=Bold Strokes Books|work=Bold Strokes Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ylva Publishing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ylva-publishing.com/|title=Ylva Publishing: Home of Quality Fiction – Ylva Publishing|work=Ylva Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Regal Crest Enterprises]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regalcrest.biz/books.php|title=Regal Crest Titles|publisher=|access-date=September 2, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716124541/http://www.regalcrest.biz/books.php|archive-date=July 16, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bedazzled Ink,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bink.bedazzledink.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517172155/http://bink.bedazzledink.com/ |archivedate=May 17, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intaglio Publications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intagliopub.com/a-Sweeney.html|title=Intaglio Publications presents Kate Sweeney|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Spinsters Ink]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spinsters-ink.com/|title=Spinsters Ink|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable author writing science fiction published by lesbian presses is [[Katherine V.

==LGBT speculative fiction awards==
A number of awards exist that recognise works at the intersection of LGBT and speculative fiction:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/index.html |title=The Locus Index to Science Fiction Awards, compiled by Mark R. Kelly |publisher=Locusmag.com |accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Gaylactic Spectrum Awards]] honour works in science fiction, fantasy and horror which include positive explorations of gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender characters, themes, or issues. The awards were instituted in 1999 and are given for best [[Gaylactic Spectrum Award winners and nominees for best novel|novel]], [[Gaylactic Spectrum Award winners and nominees for best short fiction|short fiction]] and [[Gaylactic Spectrum Award winners and nominees for best other work|other works]] of the previous year. Works produced before the awards' inception are eligible for entry into the [[Gaylactic Spectrum Award Hall of Fame inductees and nominees|Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rob Gates |url=http://www.spectrumawards.org/ |title=Gaylactic Spectrum Awards Foundation |publisher=Spectrumawards.org |accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Lambda Literary Award]]s include [[Lambda Literary Awards winners and nominees for science fiction, fantasy and horror|awards for science fiction, fantasy and horror]]. The awards were first presented in 1989, with separate categories for speculative fiction for lesbians and gay men. In 1993 these categories were merged and the combined award has undergone several name changes since then. Although the awards are given based on the quality of the writing and the LGBT themes, the author's sexual orientation is also a factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lambdaliterary.org/awards/guidelines.html |title= 2007 Lambda Literary Awards – Guidelines |work=Lambda Literary Foundation |accessdate=2008-11-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080528172700/http://www.lambdaliterary.org/awards/guidelines.html |archivedate = May 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[James Tiptree, Jr. Award]] honours works of science fiction or fantasy that expand or explore one's understanding of gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tiptree.org/ |title=James Tiptree, Jr. Literary Award Council |publisher=Tiptree.org |accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it often goes to works which deal directly or tangentially with gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tachyonpublications.com/book/Tiptree2.html |title=The James Tiptree Award Anthology 2 |author=Karen Joy Fowler, Pat Murphy, Debbie Notkin and Jeffrey D.

* [[Golden Crown Literary Society]] Awards (or "Goldies") are given to works containing lesbian themes or depictions of lesbian characters. Awards are given in numerous categories, including speculative fiction (or "SciFi/Fantasy/Horror") and [[paranormal romance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204083315/http://goldencrown.org/site/index.php/top-awards|archivedate=February 4, 2009|url=http://www.goldencrown.org/site/index.php/top-awards |title=2008 Literary Award Winners |publisher=Goldencrown.org |accessdate=2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208031017/http://goldencrown.org/site/index.php/awards-awards/2009-award-nominees|archivedate=February 8, 2009|url=http://www.goldencrown.org/site/index.php/awards-awards/2009-award-nominees |title=2009 Nominees |publisher=Goldencrown.org |accessdate=2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of countries and dependent territories ranked by population density''', measured by the number of [[human]] inhabitants per [[square kilometer]].

The list includes [[sovereign state]]s and self-governing [[dependent territory|dependent territories]] based upon the ISO standard [[ISO 3166-1]]. The list also includes but does not rank [[List of states with limited recognition|unrecognized]] but de facto independent countries. The figures in the following table are based on areas including inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers).

Figures used in this article are mainly based on the latest censuses and official estimates (or projections). Where there is not such updated national data available, figures are based on the [http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/DataQuery/ online projections] provided by the Population Division of the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/DataQuery/ | title=World Population Prospects | access-date=2016-10-26 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919061238/https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/DataQuery/# | archive-date=2016-09-19 | dead-url=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In American usage, a periodical publication's '''nameplate''' is its designed title as it appears on the front page or cover. In the United Kingdom, as well as in many other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations, this is known as the publication's '''masthead'''.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;[http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2011/08/26/EducCentNewsterminology.pdf The Guardian: ''Newspaper terminology''] Linked 2013-06-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/6JGcp6zb0?url=http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2011/08/26/EducCentNewsterminology.pdf ''Newspaper terminology'' Archived pdf at WebCitation.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In American usage, the term [[Masthead (publishing)|masthead]] refers to a printed list – published in a fixed position in each edition of a periodical – of its owners, departments, officers, and address details.&lt;ref&gt;Funk &amp; Wagnall's Standard Dictionary, New York 1960&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E.g., [https://www.nytimes.com/ref/membercenter/masthead_newspaper.html masthead of The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; This same feature is in British English usage referred to as the periodical's [[imprint (UK printing)|imprint]].&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

The '''Nara''' are a [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] ethnic group inhabiting [[Eritrea]]. The society is divided into four subtribes, who traditionally were animist but now follow Islam. They are mostly subsistence farmers. The Nara speak the [[Nara language]], which belongs to the [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] family.

==Overview==
According to the Eritrean government, the Nara are descendants of the first [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] settlers in Eritrea, who had migrated from the [[Upper Nile (state)|Upper Nile]] area and intermarried with local [[Congo Pygmies|Pygmy]] populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The people of Eritrea|url=http://www.shabait.com/about-eritrea/erina/17472-the-people-of-eritrea?format=pdf|publisher=Ministry of Information, Eritrea|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the Nara number around 108,000 individuals.&lt;ref name="Nrb"/&gt; They constitute around 1.5% of the population of Eritrea.&lt;ref name="Tesf" /&gt; They are typically agrarian and have settled primarily along the border with [[Sudan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Historical Dictionary of Eritrea| first=Tom |last=Killion |year=1998 | isbn=0-8108-3437-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nara population is divided into four subtribes: the Higir, Mogareb, Koyta and Santora.&lt;ref name="Nrb"/&gt; They traditionally adhered to [[Animism|animist]] beliefs.&lt;ref name="Nara"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eritrea: Nara People's History  |url=http://www.madote.com/2010/04/eritrea-nara-people.html |accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Egypt]]ian occupation in the 19th century, most Nara adopted [[Islam]].&lt;ref name="Tesf"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mussie Tesfagiorgis G.|title=Eritrea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7pReFaFC3fQC&amp;pg=PA177 |year=2010 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-59884-231-9 |page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; A minority also follow [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name="Nara"/&gt;

The Nara ethnonym means "Sky Heaven".&lt;ref name="Nara"/&gt; They also used to call themselves the ''Barya''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza|Cavalli-Sforza, L. Luca]]; Menozzi, Paolo; and Piazza Alberto ''The History and Geography of Human Genes'' Princeton, New Jersey: 1994 Princeton University Press "Ethiopians, Some of Their Neighbors, and North Africans"  Page 173&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
The Nara people speak the [[Nara language]]. It belongs to the [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] family, and is closely related to [[Kunama language|Kunama]].&lt;ref name="Nrb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nara|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/nrb|publisher=Ethnologue|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through contact with neighboring [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]]-speaking populations, many Nara are also bilingual in [[Tigre language|Tigre]] and/or [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. They traditionally had no writing system, with the few existing pieces of literature in Nara transcribed using either Tigre or Arabic.&lt;ref name="Tesf"/&gt;

The language is also known as ''Nara-Bana'', meaning "Nara-Talk".&lt;ref name="Nara"/&gt;

==Social organization==
Social organisation of the Nara people is based on the clan and subclan, with people living in villages and hamlets. The lineage system is patrilineal, unlike that of the [[Kunama people]]. Land belongs to the clan and shared out among the families in the clan.&lt;ref name="Tesf" /&gt;

==Genetics==
According to Trombetta et al. (2015), 60% of Nara are carriers of the [[Haplogroup E-M215 (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] paternal haplogroup. Of these, around 13% bear the V32 subclade, to which belong 60% of the [[Tigre people|Tigre]] [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] speakers in Eritrea. This points to substantial gene flow from neighbouring [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]]-speaking males into the Nara's ancestral [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Beniamino Trombetta |author2=Eugenia D’Atanasio |author3=Andrea Massaia |author4=Marco Ippoliti |author5=Alfredo Coppa |author6=Francesca Candilio |author7=Valentina Coia |author8=Gianluca Russo |author9=Jean-Michel Dugoujon |author10=Pedro Moral |author11=Nejat Akar |author12=Daniele Sellitto |author13=Guido Valesini |author14=Andrea Novelletto |author15=Rosaria Scozzari |author16=Fulvio Cruciani |title=Phylogeographic refinement and large scale genotyping of human Y chromosome haplogroup E provide new insights into the dispersal of early pastoralists in the African continent |journal=Genome Biology and Evolution |date=2015 |volume=7 |issue=7 |pages=1940–1950 |doi=10.1093/gbe/evv118 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fulvio_Cruciani/publication/279186127_Phylogeographic_refinement_and_large_scale_genotyping_of_human_Y_chromosome_haplogroup_E_provide_new_insights_into_the_dispersal_of_early_pastoralists_in_the_African_continent/links/558d132a08ae40781c207a14.pdf |accessdate=1 September 2016 }}; [http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/suppl/2015/06/23/evv118.DC1/Supplementary_Tables_1-7_Revised.xlsx Supplementary Table 7] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226230059/http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/suppl/2015/06/23/evv118.DC1/Supplementary_Tables_1-7_Revised.xlsx |date=2016-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruciani et al.

Legality of [[prostitution]] in [[the Americas]] varies by country. Most countries only legalized prostitution, with the act of exchanging money for sexual services legal. The level of enforcement varies by country. One country, the United States, is unique as legality of prostitution is not the responsibility of the federal government, but rather state, territorial, and federal district's responsibility.

{{main|Prostitution in Canada}}
Prostitution was traditionally legal as there were no laws prohibiting the exchange of sex for money or other consideration. On 20 December 2013, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] found the laws prohibiting [[brothels]], public communication for the purpose of prostitution, and living on the profits of prostitution to be unconstitutional. The ruling gave the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian parliament]] 12 months to rewrite the prostitution laws with a stay of effect so that the current laws remain in force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-25468587 | work=BBC News | title=Canada Supreme Court strikes down prostitution laws | date=2013-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amending legislation came into effect on 6 December 2014, which made the purchase of sexual services illegal, using the [[Prostitution in Sweden|Swedish approach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2014/12/03/controversial_prostitution_law_introduced_on_day_of_action_on_violence_against_women.html|title=Controversial prostitution law introduced on day of action on violence against women|author=Stephanie Levitz|date=3 December 2014|newspaper=Toronto Star|accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Prostitution in the United States}}
Prostitution laws in the United States are determined at the state level. The practice is illegal in all but one of its 50 states and is illegal in all U.S. territories.

[[Nevada]] is the only [[Political divisions of the United States|U.S. jurisdiction]] which allows some legal prostitution in some of its counties. Currently 7 out of Nevada's 16 counties have active brothels. Prostitution outside these brothels is illegal throughout the state; prostitution is illegal in the major metropolitan areas ([[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Las Vegas]], [[Reno]], and [[Carson City]]). Prostitution is heavily regulated by the state of Nevada.

Prostitution is currently legal in [[Honduras]].&lt;ref name="chartsbin" /&gt; Because there is no law prohibiting prostitution, it is a prevalent form of occupation, especially amongst women and teenagers in cities. Although similar institutions such as brothel ownership and pimping are illegal, prostitution has remained largely unchecked by the government.

Lack of enforcement of current laws has created a profitable business out of prostitution - one in which both adults and children are a part. There are many causes to the high rates of involvement amongst the women and teens in cities, but the main reason is the high poverty levels. Participants see sex work as a viable option to escape poverty.

Prostitution was legislated in 2002 through the sex work law (17.515).&lt;ref name=law-17515&gt;{{cite web|title=Law 16.832: ''Sex labour''|url=http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/leyes/AccesoTextoLey.asp?Ley=17515&amp;Anchor=|publisher=[[Parliament of Uruguay]]|language=Spanish|date=July 9, 2002|accessdate=January 26, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150126184633/http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/leyes/AccesoTextoLey.asp?Ley=17515&amp;Anchor=|archivedate=January 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Before that, prostitution was unlegislated but it was not illegal, since the constitution allows any activity that is not forbidden by law.

The first laws on prostitution in [[Martinique]] were passed in the 1850s. They were designed to keep prostitutes away from public areas but poorly enforced.&lt;ref name="sequin"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sequin|first1=Caroline|title=Uprooting "Fleurs de Trottoirs":: Displacing Clandestine Prostitution and Negotiating Respectable Sex in Colonial Martinique 1938–47|url=https://aha.confex.com/aha/2017/webprogram/Paper20722.html|website=American Historical Association|accessdate=28 December 2017|date=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, after the emergence of tourism and the start of [[WW2]], a new set of laws were enabled. The new laws targeted prostitution in the bars and restaurants of [[Fort-de-France]], which the colonial authorities believed were a major factor of [[Sexually transmitted infection|STIs]].&lt;ref name="sequin" /&gt; As a result, all waitresses and hostesses had to have a valid "certificat de non contagiosité", whether they were prostitutes or not. The aim of the authorities was to move all prostitution into brothels. The women were reluctant to work in the brothels, so prostitution remained in the bars and restaurants.&lt;ref name="sequin" /&gt;

A '''public computer''' (or '''public access computer''') is any of various computers available in public areas. Some places where public computers may be available are libraries, schools, or facilities run by government.

Public computers share similar hardware and software components to [[personal computer]]s, however, the role and function of a public access computer is entirely different. A public access computer is used by many different untrusted individuals throughout the course of the day. The computer must be locked down and secure against both intentional and unintentional abuse. Users typically don't have authority to install software or change settings.  A personal computer, in contrast, is typically used by a single responsible user, who can customize the machine's behavior to their preferences.

Public access computers are often provided with tools such as a [[PC reservation system]] to regulate access.

The world's first public access computer center was the [[Marin Computer Center]] in [[California]], co-founded by David and Annie Fox in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Kiosks==

''See also: [[Interactive kiosk|Computer Kiosk]]''

A kiosk is a special type of public computer using software and hardware modifications to provide services only about the place the kiosk is in. For example, a movie ticket kiosk can be found at a [[movie theater]]. These kiosks are usually in a secure browser with zero access to the desktop. Many of these kiosks may run [[Linux]], however, [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]], a kiosk designed for depositing money, often run [[Windows XP]].

==Public computers in the United States==
===Library computers===
In the United States and Canada, almost all public libraries have computers available for the use of patrons, though some libraries will keep users timed to allow others to get turns and keep the library less busy. Users are often allowed to print documents that they have created using these computers, though sometimes for a small fee.

===School computers===
The U.S. government has given money to many school boards to purchase computers for educational applications. Schools may have multiple [[computer lab]]s, which contain these computers for students to use. There is usually [[Internet]] access on these machines, but some schools will put up a blocking service to limit the websites that students are able to access to only include educational resources, such as [[Google]]. In addition to controlling the content students are viewing, putting up these blocks can also help to keep the computers safe by preventing students from downloading [[malware]] and other threats. However, the effectiveness of such content filtering systems is questionable since it can easily be circumvented by using proxy websites, Virtual Private Networks and for some weak security systems merely knowing the IP address of the intended website is enough to go through.

School computers often have advanced operating system security to prevent tech-savvy students from inflicting damage (i.e. the [[Windows Registry|Windows Registry Editor]] and [[Task Manager]], etc.) are disabled on [[Microsoft Windows]] machines. Schools with very advanced tech services may also install a locked down [[BIOS]]/[[firmware]] or make kernel-level changes to the operating system, eradicating all chances of unauthorized activity.

In early 2017, it was reported that the Romanov Empire's founder [[Anton Bakov|Bakov]] was interested in acquiring three islands belonging to [[Kiribati]] in order to establish a "revived Romanov Empire".&lt;ref name="radionz"&gt;[http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/321693/russian-monarchist-eyes-kiribati-for-romanov-revival Russian monarchist eyes Kiribati for Romanov revival] — [[Radio New Zealand]], 4 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 February 2017, the Kiribati government rejected Bakov's proposal for the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/325266/kiribati-govt-rejects-russian's-proposal-over-islands|title=Kiribati govt rejects Russian's proposal over islands|date=24 February 2017|website=Radio.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakov later claimed it wasn't the final decision and that it was related to an inner Kiribati political struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ekb.rbc.ru/ekb/28/02/2017/58b54df69a79470bf8881955|title=Президент Кирибати поддержал возрождение "империи Романовых" на островах|website=РБК|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 1 December 2017, the Memorandum of Friendship and Cooperation between The Republic of The Gambia and Romanov Empire was signed in [[Banjul]] by the Secretary General of The Gambia, [[Dawda Fadera]], and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Romanov Empire, Modou Lamin Saidykhan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/345836/russian-empire-plans-shift-from-kiribati-to-the-gambia|title=Russian empire plans shift from Kiribati to the Gambia|date=9 December 2017|website=Radionz.co.nz|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3488073|title=Антон Баков заявил о возрождении государственного статуса династии Романовых|date=6 December 2017|website=Kommersant.ru|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 6 December Bakov stated that the Romanov Empire was in talks with five other undisclosed countries.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; However, on 12 December the Gambia denied that such a memorandum was signed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-42324401&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===2011–2013===
Bakov declared the new Russian Empire to be the successor to the historical [[Russian Empire]] that ceased to exist in 1917. The Imperial Throne also claimed the right to maritime territories that were either claimed by the Russian Empire or discovered by the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] but never absorbed into the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="izvestia"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://izvestia.ru/news/499236 |script-title=ru:Друг Немцова воссоздал Российскую империю на островке в 168 га |trans-title=Friend of Nemtsov Recreated the Russian Empire on 168-hectare Island|work=[[Izvestia]]|author1=Alexandra Bayazitova |author2=Olga Tropkina |author3=Yelena Shishkunova |date=1 September 2011|accessdate=30 January 2015|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 17 claimed territories include the entire continent of [[Antarctica]] and land under the jurisdiction of [[Japan]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], and other nations.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://russianempire.org/content/about_podrobno.htm |title=About |website=Russianempire.org |accessdate=30 January 2015|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakov declared himself prime minister and announced a constitution and state symbols.&lt;ref name="babr"&gt;{{cite news |date=2 September 2011|url=http://newsbabr.com/?IDE=96948 |script-title=ru:Возрождена Российская империя |trans-title=Revived Russian Empire |work=Babr |accessdate=30 January 2015|language=ru }}&lt;/ref&gt; The empire began to issue its own passports online for 1,000 rubles (US$31),&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rt.com/politics/monarchist-party-romanov-empire-579 |title=Russian Monarchists launch own party, Romanovs protest |work=[[RT (TV network)|RT]] |date=19 July 2012 |accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 2014 it claimed it had granted about 4,000 passports to citizens.&lt;ref name="See1"&gt;{{ru icon}} [[n:ru:Виртуальная «Российская империя» с одобрения Николая III обретает государственный суверенитет]] — [[Russian Wikinews]], 15 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of the new Russian Empire purport it to be the successor of the historical Russian Empire founded by [[Peter the Great]] in 1721. As such, the nation stakes its claim to unpopulated territory that belonged to the historical Russian Empire through "[[discovery doctrine|right of discovery]]", but which was not claimed by the Soviet Union after the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]]. It does not claim land that was part of the historical Russian Empire that is now part of Finland, Poland, or the former Soviet republics.&lt;ref name="izvestia" /&gt;

In June 2012, Bakov registered the [[Monarchist Party]] with the [[Russian Ministry of Justice]],&lt;ref name="rt" /&gt; with a stated goal of restoring the monarchy to Russia in accordance with law. It is the only legalised monarchist party in Russia. In the fall of 2013, Bakov's daughter Anastasia Bakova (Анастасия Бакова) was the Monarchist Party's candidate in the mayoral elections in [[Yekaterinburg]].

In July 2013, Bakov claimed his nation granted citizenship to the [[statelessness|stateless]] [[Edward Snowden]], who at the time was in [[Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport]] seeking amnesty in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://regions.ru/news/2466444 |script-title=ru:Председатель Совета министров Российской Империи выписал Сноудену паспорт |trans-title=Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Empire made Snowden a passport |agency=Regions|date=5 July 2013|accessdate=30 January 2015|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accession of Prince Karl Emich ===
{{Details|Line of succession to the former Russian throne}}
[[File:Karl Emich of Leiningen photo11.JPG|thumb|Anton Bakov and Karl Emich signing founding documents for the Imperial Throne]]

On 31 March 2014, under the new name of the Imperial Throne, the micronation issued a manifesto announcing itself a [[sovereign nation]] and declaring that [[Prince Karl Emich of Leiningen]] (born 1952) had become its head with the title of ''Nicholas III, Emperor of All Russia'', as a successor to [[Nicholas II]]. The title claim emerged upon the Prince's conversion from [[Lutheranism]] to [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] on 1 June 2013.&lt;ref name="imperiya"&gt;
{{cite news|url= http://www.gosrf.ru/experts/533/

|agency= Regions
|date= 10 April 2014 
|accessdate= 30 January 2015
|language= ru}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Karl Emich descends from the House of Romanov through his grandmother, [[Grand Duchess Maria Kirillovna of Russia|Grand Duchess Maria Kirillovna]] (1907-1951), eldest child of [[Kirill Vladimirovich, Grand Duke of Russia|Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich]], who in 1924 claimed the Russian crown from exile following the execution of his cousin [[Nicholas II]] in 1918.

The Imperial Throne claimed that by his conversion, Prince Karl Emich had fulfilled the accession requirements of Articles 35 and 53 of the [[Russian Constitution of 1906|Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire]] last established in 1906. Prince Karl Emich accepted the Orthodox name "Nikolai Kirillovich" (Николай Кириллович) to become ''Nicholas III'', and his (third) wife, ''née'' Countess Isabelle von und zu Egloffstein, who also converted, accepted the name "Yekaterina Fyodorovna" (Екатерина Фёдоровна).&lt;ref name="imperiya" /&gt;

The manifesto and new constitution, signed by Nicholas III, proclaimed the goal of the Imperial Throne as consolidating people all over the world devoted to Christian monarchism. In this document, the Imperial Throne renounced all territorial claims of the Russian Empire (micronation).&lt;ref name="imperiya" /&gt;

Romanov Empire aims to use modern technologies and plans to use [[cryptocurrencies]], declaring [[bitcoin]] the national currency and seeking investments via [[Initial coin offering]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20171228232314/https://www.znak.com/2017-12-26/anton_bakov_obyavil_bitkoin_nacionalnoy_valyutoy_sozdannoy_im_romanovskoy_imperii]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rupolit.net/kandidat-v-prezidenty-anton-bakov-prisvoil-bitkoinu-status-natsionalnoy-valyuty|title=Кандидат в президенты Антон Баков присвоил биткоину статус национальной валюты|website=Rupolit.net|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitution and bylaws==
According to its constitution, "the Imperial Throne is a sovereign state, a constitutional monarchy, the successor of the All-Russian Imperial Throne, and its claimed "predecessor", the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] thrones. Romanov Empire is the only state in the world in which the principle of [[sortition]] is used to form the upper House of Parliament of the State Duma."&lt;ref name="constitution"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://russianempire.org/content/konstituciya.htm |script-title=ru:КОНСТИТУЦИЯ СУВЕРЕННОГО ГОСУДАРСТВА ИМПЕРАТОРСКИЙ ПРЕСТОЛ |trans-title=Constitution of the Sovereign State of the Imperial Throne|website=Russianempire.org|language=ru|quote=1.

===Council of ministers===
The nation's website proclaims a council of ministers (similar to the council of ministers set up by the actual Russian Empire), composed of the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://romanovempire.com/en/gov/ |script-title=Government|website=Russianempire.org|language=ru|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposed imperial palace and further talks===
After he was named Emperor, [[Prince Karl Emich of Leiningen|Nicholas III]] wrote a letter to [[Vladimir Putin]] requesting land in Yekaterinburg to establish a capital with its own imperial senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monpartya.ru/news/politicheskaya_iniciativa_nikolaya_kirillovicha.htm|title=Политическая инициатива Николая Кирилловича, Принца Лейнингенского, по созданию в Екатеринбурге города-государства – Императорский Всероссийский Престол|website=Monpartya.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; The request was denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.ru/content/201406/02/265.st.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009104535/http://www.channel4.ru/content/201406/02/265.st.html |script-title=ru:Гость «Стенда» – Антон Баков, Председатель Монархической партии России|trans-title=Guest Anton Bakov, President of the Monarch Party of Russia|work=Channel4|date=2 June 2014|archivedate=9 October 2014 |accessdate=30 January 2015|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Bakov announced that he had purchased a {{convert|96|ha|km2}} plot of land in [[Nikšić]], [[Montenegro]] to build an imperial palace along with a Russian cultural center and Orthodox monastery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.monpartya.ru/obzor/rossijskij_politik_stroit_imperatorskij_dvorec_v_chernogorii.htm |script-title=ru:Российский политик строит императорский дворец в Черногории |date=3 June 2014|accessdate=30 January 2015|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Also in early 2015 Imperial Throne representatives claimed to be in talks with the authorities of the neighboring [[Republic of Macedonia]] and [[Albania]] on possible collaboration and future [[state recognition]]. Bakov held a meeting with Macedonian Prime Minister [[Nikola Gruevski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imperor.net/en/latest-news/archchancellor-of-imperial-throne-anton-bakov-met-with-the-prime-minister-of-the-republic-of-macedonia/|title=Archchancellor of Imperial Throne Anton Bakov met with the Prime Minister of the Republic of Macedonia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|website=Imperor.net|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512122114/http://imperor.net/en/latest-news/archchancellor-of-imperial-throne-anton-bakov-met-with-the-prime-minister-of-the-republic-of-macedonia/|archivedate=12 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later there were talks with [[President of Gambia]] [[Yahya Jammeh]] at the [[Seventieth session of the United Nations General Assembly|70th UN General Assembly session]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imperor.net/en/aristocracy/gambian-press-welcomes-archchancellor-of-imperial-throne-a-a-bakov/|title=Gambian press welcomes Archchancellor of Imperial throne A.A.Bakov|date=19 October 2015|website=Imperor.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, talks were held with Macedonian and Montenegro Eastern Orthodox clergy — Bakov discussed creation of churches associated with Imperial Throne and proposed [[canonization]] of Russian ruler [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]] and his wife [[Sophia Palaiologina]], who played significant roles in bringing Christian monarchy to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gosrf.ru/news/19169/|title=Антон Баков: Бизнесмен не ходит строем|website=Gosrf.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Talks with [[Gaston Browne]], Prime Minister of [[Antigua and Barbuda]], also took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imperor.net/en/latest-news/delegation-of-russian-throne-on-official-visit-in-antigua-and-barbuda/|title=Delegation of Imperial Throne on official visit in Antigua and Barbuda|date=16 December 2015|website=Imperor.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kiribati developments ===
In May 2016 talks were held with the government of [[Kiribati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kiribati.me/2016/05/11/977/|title=The official visit of the Archchancellor of the Imperial Throne Anton Bakov to the Republic of Kiribati|date=11 May 2016|website=Kiribati.me}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2016 talks were continued and in early 2017 it was announced by [[Radio New Zealand]]&lt;ref name="radionz" /&gt; that the Kiribati government had agreed to assign three uninhabited islands in its [[Line Islands]]: [[Malden Island]] (for the Capital), [[Caroline Island]] and [[Starbuck Island]]. This may indicate future [[state recognition]], and transformation from [[micronation]] to [[sovereign nation]]. Later updates clarified that there are plans for an immediate injection of US$120 million into the Kiribati economy that will be followed by US$230 million of investments in construction of infrastructure at Malden island: hotels, fish factories and more.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/07/russian-millionaire-plans-re-establish-romanov-empire-pacific-islands|title=Russian millionaire details plans to re-establish Romanov empire on remote Pacific island|first=Eleanor Ainge|last=Roy|date=6 February 2017|website=Theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bakov, "a great number of Russian patriots who are not happy with Putin’s regime" are expected to arrive when the initial constructions are completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/30/russian-businessman-seeks-restore-tsarist-empire-overthrown/|title=Russian businessman seeks to restore Tsarist empire overthrown in 1917 on Pacific atoll|first=Jonathan|last=Pearlman|date=30 October 2017|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-38798535|title=Kiribati mulls 'Russian monarchy' plan|date=30 October 2017|website=Bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; From these times, the project has been branded under the new main name of the '''Romanov Empire'''.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-mans-quest-to-restore-the-russian-empire-isnt-going-well-1492351200|title=This Man’s Quest to Restore the Russian Empire Isn’t Going Well|first=James|last=Marson|date=16 April 2017|website=Wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gambia developments ===
Bakov has been in similar talks with Gambia since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ural.aif.ru/politic/person/romanovskuyu_imperiyu_monarhista_bakova_priznali_oficialno|title=Романовскую империю монархиста Бакова признали официально|website=Ural.aif.ru|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2017 he announced that the proposed declaration of partnership was finally signed and new Gambia authorities, headed by [[Adama Barrow]], had recognised the Romanov Empire. Bakov's [[land development]] companies now plan to create [[artificial island]]s in the vicinity of Gambia's capital, [[Banjul]], to establish territory for the Empire. The 6-year design works and talks took $6 million, and follow by talks on recognition with five other undisclosed countries.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Furthermore, Bakov has proposed that Russian Olympic athletes, who were recently denied attendance to the [[2018 Winter Olympics]], compete under Romanov Empire flag.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20171206170916/https://www.znak.com/2017-12-06/rossiyanam_predlozheno_vystupit_na_olimpiade_v_koree_pod_flagami_romanovskoy_imperii]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbols ==
The coat of arms of the "Russian Empire" consisted of a [[double-headed eagle]]. The flag of the empire is the [[Saltire|St. Andrew's Cross]], which was the [[Russian Navy Ensign]].&lt;ref name="babr" /&gt;

With the transformation into the Imperial Throne, the coat of arms was changed to a black Russian Imperial Eagle with the [[Chi Rho]] symbol in the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]]. Bakov emphasized the Chi Rho symbolizes the formation of the Christian Monarchy in the [[Roman Empire]] by [[Constantine the Great]] who saw the symbol in the skies before the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]] in 312 AD. The eagle holds in its talons the [[sceptre]] and [[globus cruciger]], two of the most prominent symbols of Christian monarchy.

The '''Romansh people''' (also spelled '''Romansch''', '''Rumantsch,''' or '''Romanche'''; Romansh: {{Audio|Roh-vallader-rumantsch.ogg|''rumantsch''}}, ''rumàntsch'', {{Audio|Roh-putèr-rumauntsch.ogg|''romauntsch''}} or {{Audio|Roh-Sursilvan-Romontsch.ogg|''romontsch''}}) are a [[Italic peoples|Romance]]&lt;ref name="Minahan"&gt;{{cite book |last=Minahan |first=James |author-link= |title=One Europe, Many Nations: A Historical Dictionary of European National Groups |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NwvoM-ZFoAgC |date=2000 |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |location= |page=776 |isbn=0313309841 |quote=Romance (Latin) nations...}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ethnic group]] of [[Switzerland]], native speakers of the [[Romansh language]]. They are usually multilingual, also speaking [[German language|German]] (both the [[Standard German|standard variety]] and the local [[Swiss German]]) and sometimes [[Italian language|Italian]], which are the other official languages of [[Graubünden]], the [[Swiss canton|canton]] where they are concentrated.

They make up about 1% of Switzerland's population and 15% of Graubünden's.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} {{it_icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20061010060124/http://www.gr.ch/Deutsch/seiten.cfm?idnav1=1&amp;idnav2=7&amp;seite=/Deutsch/Land_&amp;_Leute/zahlen_fakten.cfm Canton of Graubünden Website] accessed October 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romansh people began advocating for an end to German dominion over them starting with [[World War I]]. In 1937 the Swiss government recognized the Romansh language for the first time as one of Switzerland's four national languages, though only for use within the canton, not at the federal level.

The Romansh people appeared to be mostly satisfied with this status until the 1980s when debate arose over Switzerland's relationship with the greater European continent and the concept of the [[European Union]] began to form. The Romansh people advocated heavily for Switzerland's membership in the Union, but the referendum to join it was narrowly defeated in 1992 by the German majority and Switzerland remained a nation apart with the Romansh people a nation apart within it though with ever-increasing sovereignty and recognition at the federal level to the point that Romansh is now considered one of the official federal languages of the Swiss Confederation.

The Romansh national leadership in Switzerland expressly stated its interest in Switzerland joining the European Union in terms of a pro-European stance and not an anti-Swiss-Confederation one, openly recognizing that the Confederation, though dominated by the German Swiss and with large Swiss French and Swiss Italian contingents, had sheltered the tiny Romansh minority population for nearly 200 years, never engaging in programs to erase their identity or language nor forcing them to relocate to accommodate any other ethnic group as had been the norm with a variety of other ethnic minorities throughout Europe.  Though there have been some stumbling blocks, the history of the relationship between the Romansh people and the other ethnic peoples of Switzerland appears to have been and continues to be an unusually polite and respectful one.&lt;ref name="Minahan2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Minahan|title=Encyclopedia of the stateless nations. 3.

Dominique was investigated in late 2006 following a police report by a man who refused to let Dominique tie him up. The final victim, Chris Sutterfield, had died about two months earlier.

Following his arrest on December 1, 2006, Dominique confessed to the rape and murder of at least 23 men over a ten-year period beginning in 1997. He committed the crimes in [[Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana|Terrebonne]], [[Lafourche Parish|Lafourche]], [[Iberville Parish, Louisiana|Iberville]], [[St. Charles Parish, Louisiana|St. Charles]] and [[Jefferson Parish|Jefferson ]] parishes in suburban [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name=HoumaCourierCourtTV20061207/&gt;&lt;ref name=HoumaCourierCourtTV20061218/&gt; In his confession, Dominique, who is gay, said he frequented area [[gay bar]]s and targeted men he thought would be willing to have sex for money. He also lured straight men by setting up fake drug deals or showing men a picture of women and telling them that she was willing to pay for sex with a Black man. &lt;ref&gt;https://wondery.com/shows/real-crime-profile/ episode 52-55&lt;/ref&gt;He murdered them to avoid being convicted and sentenced to prison for rape. He was charged with multiple cases of rape and [[first-degree murder]].&lt;ref name=HoumaCourierCourtTV20061207/&gt;&lt;ref name=HoumaCourierCourtTV20061218/&gt;

On September 23, 2008, Dominique was sentenced to eight life sentences after confessing to raping and killing his male victims over a 10-year period.&lt;ref name="Fox News"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/09/24/louisiana-serial-killer-gets-8-life-terms-for-8-murders.html|title=Louisiana Serial Killer Gets 8 Life Terms for 8 Murders|date=September 24, 2008|publisher=[[Fox News]]|accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominique pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in a deal to avoid the death penalty.&lt;ref name="Fox News"/&gt; He is incarcerated at the [[Louisiana State Penitentiary]] in Angola.&lt;ref name="Sword and Scale"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Chris Blondell |title=The Gentle, Pathetic Serial Killer |url=http://swordandscale.com/the-gentle-pathetic-serial-killer/ |website=Sword and Scale |accessdate=30 September 2018 |date=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crime Feed"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Mike McPadden |title=Ronald Dominique: “The Bayou Serial Killer” Who Decimated Gay Louisiana - CrimeFeed |url=http://crimefeed.com/2017/09/32493/ |website=CrimeFeed |publisher=Discovery Communications, LLC. |accessdate=30 September 2018 |date=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not clear what the sign language or languages are in [[Rwanda]].  In 2006, a dictionary project was started to standardize '''Rwandan Sign Language''' (''Amarenga y'Ikinyarwanda'' AKR "Kinyarwanda Sign Language", also ''Amarenga yo mu Rwanda'' AMR "Sign Language of Rwanda"), published in 2009.  It was an incomplete effort, and an expanded dictionary, based on signs common throughout the country, was started in 2013.  The latter project description implies that these are dialects of a single language, but that is uncertain.  Interpreter programs are available in Uganda; it is unknown whether this means that Rwandan Sign Language is related to [[Ugandan Sign Language]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/201503101219.html Rwanda: Experts Begin Compilation of Sign Language Dictionary], ''The New Times'', 2015 March 10&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the 1990s, an interreligious society was established in the canton of Zürich to support the foundation of a centre for spiritual and cultural care of [[Tamil people]] in Switzerland, as well as to preserve and maintain the [[Tamil culture]] of the approximatively 35,000 (around 20,000 in the canton of Zürich) [[Sri Lankan Tamils|Tamil people of Sri Lankan origin]] living in Switzerland. So, the [[Sri Sivasubramaniar Temple]] in Adliswil was founded in 1994 as a [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|non-profit foundation]].&lt;ref name="religionench"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionenschweiz.ch/hinduismus.html|title=Hinduismus in der Schweiz|publisher=Religionen in der Schweiz|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2014-12-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710180337/http://www.religionenschweiz.ch/hinduismus.html|archivedate=2015-07-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some 5,000 Indian Hindus in Switzerland founded their own cultural associations, but not a temple, the Tamil Hindus opened 19 houses of worship since the 1990s. Because the premises in Adliwil have become too small, the community decided also to move to Dürnten.&lt;ref name="lz-20100117"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aargauerzeitung.ch/schweiz/indische-handwerker-bauen-hindu-tempel-ohne-bewilligung-5842098|title=Indische Handwerker bauen Hindu-Tempel – ohne Bewilligung|publisher=[[Limmattaler Zeitung]]|author=Patrizia Legnini|language=German|date=2010-01-17|accessdate=2014-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening ceremony was set on 27 January 2010, although the granting of the canton of Zurich for the opening was not given yet. The temple's priest Kurukkal told in an interview, ''according to the Hindu horoscope, the temple had to been opened in January''. Because the building is located at a cantonal road, there is even needed the granting of the canton, thus to the municipal permission was given, but therefore the municipality could not formerly grant the approval for the construction. The municipal council of Dürnten supported the plans for the temple. To express his goodwill to the Tamil community, in November 2009 the municipal president participated of the ritual worship, which took place in the context of the laying of the foundation stone. Initiated was the construction by the ''Sri Vishnuthurkkai Amman'' community by Swiss Tamil citizens. In addition to several local craftsmen, eight men from [[South India]] have collaborated to build the temple.&lt;ref name="lz-20100117"/&gt;

== Temple's building ==
The temple is located in a pre-existing warehouse, with floor heating, new sewer lines and a new kitchen subsequently installed. The main altar is located in the middle of the biggest room. Several lions, the mounts of the [[Devi|Hindu Goddess ''Durga'']], enthrone on the dome above the decorated portal, as well as the deities and the other colorful altars with their small turrets, which were built on the walls of the room – they all were shipped from India.&lt;ref name="lz-20100117"/&gt; The Temple is located at Ediker Strasse 24, 8635 Dürnten.&lt;ref name="religionench"/&gt;

== Cultural and religious life ==
To move from the [[Sihl Valley]] to Dürnten was ''perfect'' – among other things, the building is furthermore located in a valley and on a stream, as for the temple festival the flowing water is of particular importance.&lt;ref name="lz-20100117"/&gt; 

Every Friday evening between 100 and 150 people attend the ''[[Puja (Hinduism)|Pooja]]'', and on other weekdays 10 to 20 attend. Six services per day are held. Usually in July a ten-day temple festival, dedicated to the Hindu Goddess ''[[Durga]]'', is celebrated, having about 4,000 visitors.&lt;ref name="zol-20120723"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zol.ch/bezirk-hinwil/duernten/Tamilen-schlossen-Tempelfest-mit-Wasserritual-ab/story/28236447|title=Tamilen schlossen Tempelfest mit Wasserritual ab|publisher=[[Zürcher Oberländer]]|author=Annette Saloma-Huber|language=German|date=2012-07-23|accessdate=2014-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zol-20130720"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zol.ch/bezirk-hinwil/duernten/Ein-Pfauentanz-fuer-Goettin-Amman/story/30175702|title=Ein Pfauentanz für Göttin Amman|publisher=[[Zürcher Oberländer]]|author=Regula Lienin|language=German|date=2013-07-20|accessdate=2014-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stage theories''' are based on the idea that elements in systems move through a pattern of distinct [[wikt:stage|stage]]s over time and that these stages can be described based on their distinguishing characteristics. Specifically, stages in [[cognitive development]] have a constant order of succession, later stages integrate the achievements of earlier stages, and each is characterized by a particular type of structure of mental processes which is specific to it. The time of appearance may vary to a certain extent depending upon environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, J. (1970). Piaget’s theory. In P. H. Mussen, (Ed.), ''Carmichael’s handbook of child development'' (pp. 703-732). New York: Wiley.
&lt;/ref&gt;

"Stage theory" can also be applied beyond psychology to describe phenomena more generally where multiple phases lead to an outcome. The term "stage theory" can thus be applied to various scientific, sociological and business disciplines. In these contexts, stages may not be as rigidly defined, and it is possible for individuals within the multi-stage process to revert to earlier stages or skip some stages entirely.

==Piaget's theory of cognitive development==
:''See also: [[Theory of cognitive development]]''
[[Jean Piaget]]'s theory&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, J. (1951
). ''The psychology of intelligence''. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; consists of four stages: Sensorimotor: (birth to 2 years), Preoperations: (2 to 7 years), Concrete operations: (7 to 11 years), and Formal Operations: (11 to 16 years).  Each stage has at least two substages, usually called early and fully.

===Underlying assumptions===
* Each stage lays the foundation for the next.
* Everyone goes through the stages in the same order.
* Each stage is qualitatively different. Meaning it is a change in nature, not just quantity
* The child is an active learner. Basically they have to do it on their own, they cannot be told.

===Sensorimotor stage (birth to 2 years)===

This stage is represented when infants obtain some control over their surroundings by sensory and motor schemes. &lt;ref&gt;Newman, B. M., &amp; Newman P. R. (2012). ''Development Through Life: A Psychosocial Approach''. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Infants start to identify their actions and the consequences of their actions. &lt;ref&gt;Nolen-Hoeksema, S., Fredrickson B. L., Loftus G. R., &amp; Wagenaar W. A.. (2009). ''Atkinson &amp; Hilgard's Introduction to Psychology''. Cheriton House, UK: Cengage Learning EMEA, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

A child comes into the world knowing almost nothing, but they have the potential that comes in the form of: 
* Brain makeup
* Reflexes e.g. [[sucking]] and [[Visual_search#Visual_orienting_and_attention|visual orienting]]
* Innate tendencies to adapt to environment

Infants use these potentials to explore and gain an understanding about themselves and the environment. They have a lack of [[object permanence]], which means they have little or no ability to conceive things as existing outside their immediate vicinity. For example:  when you place a barrier, such as a piece of wood, in front of an object an infant will believe that the object is nonexistent.

===Object permanence===

Study 

*Infants do not grasp the concept of object permanence when they do not realize that an object exists even when it is not visible at the moment.
* When an object or toy is hidden from an infant they almost immediately lose interest and fail to search for the toy.  This is common in infants that are eight months or younger. &lt;ref&gt;Nolen-Hoeksema, S., Fredrickson B. L., Loftus G. R., &amp; Wagenaar W. A.. (2009). ''Atkinson &amp; Hilgard's Introduction to Psychology''. Cheriton House, UK: Cengage Learning EMEA, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Children who are around eight months can form a mental representation of an object in their head proving that they obtain object permanence (sensory motor stage)

===Sensorimotor play===
This play does not provide a purpose other than sensation:
*Swinging on a swing; enjoys the movement 
*Singing songs and simply playing with sounds such as 'Tra-la-la."&lt;ref&gt;Singer, D. G., &amp; Revenson T. A. (1997). ''A Piaget Primer: How a Child Thinks''. Madison, CT: International Universities Press, Inc. p. 44-45.&lt;/ref&gt; the sound's purpose is only for the satisfaction they bring
*Some play includes listening, tasting and smelling

====Substages of Piaget's sensorimotor stage====
{| class="Substages of Piaget's Sensorimotor Stage" 
|-
! Substage!! Age !! Piaget's Label !! Characteristics
|-
| 1 || Birth-1 month || Reflexes || Use of built-in schemes or reflexes such as sucking or looking; no imitation; no ability to integrate information from several senses.
|-
| 2|| 1-4 months || Primary circular reactions || Accommodation of basic schemes (grasping, looking, sucking), as baby practices them endlessly. Beginning coordination of schemes from different senses, such as looking toward a sound; baby does not yet link bodily actions to some result outside the body.
|-
| 3 || 4-8 months || Secondary circular reactions || Baby becomes much more aware of events outside his own body and makes them happen again, in a kind of trial-and-error learning. Imitation may occur, but only of schemes already in the baby's repertoire. Beginning understanding of the "object concept."
|-
| 4 || 8-12 months || Coordination of secondary schemes || Clear intentional means-ends behavior. The baby not only goes after what she wants, but may combine two schemes to do so, such as knocking a pillow away to reach a toy. Imitation of novel behaviors occurs, as does transfer of information from one sense to another (cross-modal transfer).
|-
| 5 || 12-18 months || Tertiary circular reactions || "Experimentation" begins, in which the infant tries out new ways of playing with or manipulating objects. Very active, very purposeful trial-and-error exploration.
|-
| 6 || 18-24 months || Beginning of representational thought || Development of use of symbols to represent objects or events. Child understands that the symbol is separate from the object. Deferred imitation first occurs at this stage.

===Preoperational stage (2 to 7 years)===
Preoperational intelligence means the young child is capable of mental representations, but does not have a system for organizing this thinking (intuitive rather than logical thought).
The child is egocentric – which is they have problems distinguishing from their own perceptions and perceptions of others.
A classic example is, a preoperational child will cover their eyes so they can not see someone and think that that person can not see them either.

The child also has rigid thinking, which involves the following:
* Centration – a child will become completely fixed on one point, not allowing them to see the wider picture. For example, focusing only on the height of the container rather than both the height and width when determining what has the biggest volume.
* State – can only concentrate on what something looks like at that time.
* Appearance – focuses on how something appears rather than reality.
* Lack of Reversibility – can not reverse the steps they have taken. Does not realize that one set of steps can be cancelled by another set of steps.
* Lack of Conservation – realizing that something can have the same properties even if it appears differently.

===Concrete operations (7 to 11 years)===
* Intelligence is now both symbolic and logical.
* Acquires ‘operations’ = a set of general rules and strategies.
* The most critical part of operations is realizing ‘reversibility’ = both physical and mental processes can be reversed and cancelled out by others.
The concrete operational child will overcome the aspects of rigidity apparent in a preoperational child. These are:
* lack of reversibility
* states
* appearance
* conservation
The tasks of concrete operations are:
* Seriation – putting items (such as toys) in height order.
* Classification – the difference between two similar items such as daisies and roses.
* Conservation – realising something can have same properties, even if it appears differently.

It is important to realise that operations and conservations do not develop at the same time. They develop gradually and are not an ‘all or nothing’ phenomenon. For example, the first to develop is number conservation followed by mass conservation, area conservation, liquid conservation and finally solid volume conservation.
Thinking is not abstract. It is limited to concrete phenomena and the child’s own past experiences.

===Formal operations (11 to 16 years)===
* Child is capable of formulating hypotheses and then testing them against reality.
* Thinking is abstract, that is a child/adolescent can formulate all the possible outcomes before beginning the problem. They are also capable of deductive reasoning.

==Limitations of Piaget's theory==
A popular criticism is that Piaget underestimated the abilities of an infant.  Studies have shown that they have more of a capacity in memory and understanding of objects than he believed. &lt;ref&gt;Bee, H. L., &amp; Boyd, D. (2010). ''The Developing Child''. Boston, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neo-Piagetian and Post-Piagetian stage theories==
{{Main|Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development}}

Juan Pascaual-Leone was the first to propose a neo-Piagetian stage theory. Since that time there have been several [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]].&lt;ref&gt;Demetriou, A. (1998). Cognitive development. In A. Demetriou, W. Doise, K. F. M. van Lieshout (Eds.), ''Life-span developmental psychology'' (pp. 179-269). London: Wiley. 
&lt;/ref&gt; Only the ones that cover at least infancy through adulthood are mentioned here.  These include the theories of Robbie Case, Grame Halford, [[Andreas Demetriou]] and [[Kurt W. Fischer]]. The theory of [[Michael Commons]]' [[model of hierarchical complexity]] is also relevant.  The description of stages in these theories is more elaborate and focuses on underlying mechanisms of information processing rather than on reasoning as such. In fact, development in information processing capacity is invoked to explain the development of reasoning. More stages are described (as many as 15 stages), with 4 being added beyond the stage of Formal operations. Most stage sequences map onto one another.  PostPiagetian stages are free of content and context and are therefore very powerful and general.

'''Stereoscopic Displays and Applications''' ('''SD&amp;A''') is an academic technical conference in the field of [[stereoscopic|stereoscopic 3D imaging]].&lt;ref name=BGoog/&gt; The conference started in 1990 and is held annually.  The conference is held as part of the annual Electronic Imaging: Science and Technology Symposium&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.electronicimaging.org/ Electronic Imaging Symposium]''&lt;/ref&gt; organised by the [[Society for Imaging Science and Technology]] (IS&amp;T).

==Scope==
SD&amp;A is an academic technical conference dedicated to stereoscopic imaging topics, specializing in all forms of stereoscopic imaging, including stereoscopic 3D display hardware, stereoscopic 3D image capture, stereoscopic 3D image storage and processing, and also applications of these technologies.  As well as including coverage of two-view 3D displays, the conference includes significant coverage of multi-view autostereoscopic displays and volumetric 3D displays - any system that stimulates stereoscopic vision in an observer.

==Overview==
The backbone of the annual SD&amp;A conference is the technical presentations, which are all accompanied by a technical paper published in the conference proceedings. Alongside the technical sessions, the conference has its own keynote presentation, a popular demonstration session (where a range of stereoscopic 3D technologies can be seen in one place at one time), the 3D theater (where the latest stereoscopic content is shown), and a discussion forum.

==History==
SD&amp;A was founded in 1990 by [[John O. Merritt]] and [[Scott Fisher (technologist)|Scott Fisher]], and has been held annually since. [[Holography]] pioneer [[Stephen Benton]] was also an SD&amp;A conference chair from 2000 until his death in 2003.

From 1990 to 1993, papers from the SD&amp;A conference were published in its own proceedings volume. From 1994, the papers from the SD&amp;A conference were co-published with papers from [[The Engineering Reality of Virtual Reality]] conference (which was co-located with SD&amp;A) in a volume series titled ''Stereoscopic Displays and Virtual Reality Systems''. From 2008, SD&amp;A went back to the publication of papers in its own proceedings volume.

Over the period 1990 to 2015, SD&amp;A and the Electronic Imaging Symposium were jointly organized by IS&amp;T and [[SPIE]].  From 2016 onwards, SD&amp;A and EI are organized by IS&amp;T.

A detailed listing of the conference program for every year since 1996 is available on the official SD&amp;A website.  The Introduction/Preface of every year's conference proceedings also contains a descriptive summary of each conference.  The proceedings Introduction is also available on the official SD&amp;A website.

==Proceedings==
A technical proceedings is published annually containing manuscripts presented at the conference.  Over 1100 technical papers have been published over the history of the SD&amp;A conference. The full list of conference proceedings, including a compilation DVD-ROM (1990-2009), is listed at the official SD&amp;A website.

The DVD-ROM compilation "''Stereoscopic Displays and Applications 1990-2009: A Complete 20-Year Retrospective - and The Engineering Reality of Virtual Reality 1994-2009 (CDP51)''"&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.stereoscopic.org/proc/index.html#dvd Selected SPIE/IS&amp;T papers on DVD-ROM: Stereoscopic Displays and Applications 1990-2009: A Complete 20-Year Retrospective - and The Engineering Reality of Virtual Reality 1994-2009]'', SPIE Press, CDP51, {{ISBN|978-0-8194-7659-3}}, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; released in 2010 represents a technical knowledge base across stereoscopic 3D and VR topics containing the complete technical record of the Stereoscopic Displays and Applications conference (1990-2009), The Engineering Reality of Virtual Reality conference (1994-2009), and papers from a selection of ten other 3D related SPIE conferences (1977-1989) predating SD&amp;A. The disc contains 1260 individual technical papers – 816 from the Stereoscopic Displays and Applications conference, 223 from The Engineering Reality of Virtual Reality conference, and 221 papers from the SPIE 3D conferences prior to SD&amp;A.

Some of the presentations at the SD&amp;A conference have been, or go onto be, published in the [[Journal of Electronic Imaging]].  From 1990 to 2015, the SD&amp;A proceedings were published as part of the [[Proceedings of SPIE]] series.  From 2016 the SD&amp;A proceedings are published by [[IS&amp;T]] and will be available open-access.

==Citation Statistics==

Papers presented at SD&amp;A are cited extensively.  A citation analysis&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.stereoscopic.org/2014/preface.html Introduction - Stereoscopic Displays and Applications XXV]'', Proceedings of the Electronic Imaging, Volume 9011, SPIE Press, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; of SD&amp;A proceedings papers conducted in January 2014 using Google Scholar found that there were a total of 12,371 citations across all papers presented at SD&amp;A, and also calculated a top ten of most-cited papers across the then 25-year history of SD&amp;A:

The video has had more than 12 million views as of August 2018.&lt;ref name="Suspect" /&gt;  The [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and British Columbia Coroners Service launched investigations into the suicide.

In response to her death, [[Christy Clark]], the [[Premier of British Columbia]], made an online statement of condolence and suggested a national discussion on criminalizing [[cyberbullying]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=RCMP launch investigation into death of bullied BC teen|place=CA|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/rcmp-launch-investigation-into-death-of-bullied-b-c-teen-1.993029|accessdate=October 13, 2012|newspaper=CTV News|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013030309/http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/rcmp-launch-investigation-into-death-of-bullied-b-c-teen-1.993029|archivedate=October 13, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=After Amanda Todd's death, Christy Clark says new laws may be needed to combat bullying|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/life/After+Amanda+Todd+death+Christy+Clark+says+laws+needed+combat/7384108/story.html|publisher=Vancouver Sun|accessdate=October 13, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015002318/http://www.vancouversun.com/life/After+Amanda+Todd+death+Christy+Clark+says+laws+needed+combat/7384108/story.html|archivedate=October 15, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a motion was introduced in the Canadian House of Commons to propose a study of the scope of bullying in Canada, and for more funding and support for anti-bullying organizations. Todd's mother Carol established the Amanda Todd Trust, receiving donations to support anti-bullying awareness education and programs for young people with mental health problems.

==Background and suicide==
On September 7, 2012, Todd posted a 9-minute [[YouTube]] video entitled ''My Story: Struggling, bullying, suicide and self-harm'', which showed her using a series of [[flashcards]] to tell of her experiences being bullied.&lt;ref name="Video"&gt;{{YouTube|vOHXGNx-E7E|My story: Struggling, bullying, suicide, self-harm}}, 7 September 2012, Retrieved 18 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The video post went viral after her death on October 10, 2012, receiving over 1,600,000 views by October 13, 2012,&lt;ref name="ctvnews.ca"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/tormenters-target-b-c-teen-amanda-todd-s-online-memorials-1.994594 |title=Online bullying of B.C. teen continues amid police probe &amp;#124; CTV News |publisher=Ctvnews.ca |date=October 13, 2012 |accessdate=October 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with news websites from around the world linking to it.

During the video, Todd writes that when she was in grade 7 (2009/2010), around the same time she moved in with her father,&lt;ref name="VancouverSun" /&gt; she used [[video chat]] to meet new people over the Internet and she received compliments on her looks.&lt;ref name="Video" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Transcript"&gt;[http://pastebin.com/rMX6fWKU Amanda Todd - Transcript of video] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121210215745/http://pastebin.com/rMX6fWKU |date=December 10, 2012 }}, ''Pastebin.com'', 15 October 2012, Huntley, R., Retrieved 18 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A stranger convinced Todd to bare her breasts on camera (an exploitive phenomenon known as "capping", short for [[screen shot|screen capturing]]),&lt;ref name="Capping"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mapleridgenews.com/breaking_news/175880591.html | title=Predators lurk behind computer screens | publisher=Maple Ridge News | author=Martins, Monisha | accessdate=2016-09-13 | date=2016-10-26 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160926201721/http://www.mapleridgenews.com/breaking_news/175880591.html | archivedate=September 26, 2016 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; following one year of attempts at having her do so.&lt;ref name="Video" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Transcript" /&gt; The individual later blackmailed her with threats of providing the topless photo to her friends unless she gave him a "show";&lt;ref name="Video" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Transcript" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNNVideo"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/10/12/world/americas/canada-teen-bullying/index.html?iref=allsearch |title=Bullied Canadian teen leaves behind chilling YouTube video – CNN.com |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date=October 13, 2012 |accessdate=October 13, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026003136/http://edition.cnn.com/2012/10/12/world/americas/canada-teen-bullying/index.html?iref=allsearch |archivedate=October 26, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; she also featured briefly, albeit circumstantially, on the faux animated news show ''Daily Capper'' on [[BlogTV]] in an incident which attracted the vigilante attentions of the group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] after her suicide.&lt;ref name="Daily Capper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/society/sick-pedophile-ring-blackmail-amanda-todd/|title=Inside the sick pedophile ring that blackmailed girls like Amanda Todd|author=Morris|first=Kevin|date=2012-10-19|website=The Daily Dot|publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817110141/http://www.dailydot.com/society/sick-pedophile-ring-blackmail-amanda-todd/|archivedate=August 17, 2016|deadurl=no|accessdate=2016-09-15|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anonymous, Daily Capper, and Kody1206"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/in-the-darkest-corners-of-the-internet-bullies-and-predators-hide-in-plain-sight/article4650771/ | title=In the darkest corners of the Internet, bullies and predators hide in plain sight | publisher=The Globe and Mail | date=2012-10-25 | accessdate=2016-09-15 | author=Woo, Andrea | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010084738/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/in-the-darkest-corners-of-the-internet-bullies-and-predators-hide-in-plain-sight/article4650771/ | archivedate=October 10, 2016 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; An episode of ''Daily Capper'' which attempted to take the moral high ground, very different in tone from their usual exploitative material, was released a month after her death.&lt;ref name="The Suspicious Return of the Daily Capper"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/the-suspicious-return-of-the-daily-capper | title=The Suspicious Return of the Daily Capper | publisher=Vice | date=2012-11-12 | accessdate=2016-09-15 | author=McGuire, Patrick | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505095940/http://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/the-suspicious-return-of-the-daily-capper | archivedate=May 5, 2016 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Todd wrote that during the Christmas 2010 break, police informed her at 4:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. that the photo was circulating on the Internet.&lt;ref name="Video" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Transcript" /&gt; She wrote that she experienced [[anxiety]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], and [[panic disorder]] due to her experiences of being sexually exploited online and being cyberbullied.&lt;ref name="Video" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Transcript" /&gt; Her family moved to a new home, where Todd later stated that she began using drugs and alcohol.&lt;ref name="Video" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Transcript" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNNVideo" /&gt;

A year later, the individual reappeared, creating a [[Facebook]] profile which used the topless photograph as the profile image, and contacting classmates at her new school.&lt;ref name="Video" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Transcript" /&gt; Again Todd was teased, eventually changing schools for a second time.&lt;ref name="Video" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Transcript" /&gt; She wrote that she began chatting to "an old guy friend" who contacted her.&lt;ref name="Video" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Transcript" /&gt; The friend invited Todd to his house, where they had sex while his girlfriend was on holiday.&lt;ref name="Video" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Transcript" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Villalva|first=Brittney R.|title=Amanda Todd: 15-Year-Old Tells Story of Bullying and Suicide Before Death|url=http://global.christianpost.com/news/amanda-todd-15-year-old-tells-story-of-bullying-and-suicide-before-death-video-83253/|work=The Christian Post|accessdate=October 16, 2012|date=October 14, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130102192909/http://global.christianpost.com/news/amanda-todd-15-year-old-tells-story-of-bullying-and-suicide-before-death-video-83253/|archivedate=January 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week, the boy's girlfriend and a group of about 15 others confronted Todd at school, shouting insults, with the boy's girlfriend punching her;&lt;ref name="Video" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Transcript" /&gt; Todd fell to the ground, then lay in a ditch where her father found her.&lt;ref name="Video" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Transcript" /&gt; Following the attack, Todd attempted suicide by drinking bleach, but she survived after being rushed to hospital to have her stomach pumped.&lt;ref name="Video" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Transcript" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNNVideo" /&gt; "It killed me inside and I thought I was gonna actully {{sic}} die", Todd commented in her video about drinking bleach.&lt;ref name="Fox" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Video" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Transcript" /&gt;

After returning home, Todd discovered abusive messages about her suicide attempt posted to Facebook.&lt;ref name="Video" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Transcript" /&gt; In March 2012, her family moved to another city to start afresh, but Todd was unable to escape the past.&lt;ref name="Video" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Transcript" /&gt; According to her mother, "Every time she moved schools he would go undercover and become a Facebook friend. What the guy did was he went online to the kids who went to (the new school) and said that he was going to be a new student – that he was starting school the following week and that he wanted some friends and could they friend him on Facebook. He eventually gathered people's names and sent Todd's video to her new school", including students, teachers and parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Amanda+Todd+speaks+about+daughter+death/7384521/story.html|title=Amanda Todd's mother speaks out about her daughter, bullying (with video)|author=Gillian Shaw|date=October 14, 2012|work=Vancouver Sun|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031121155/http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Amanda+Todd+speaks+about+daughter+death/7384521/story.html|archivedate=October 31, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six months later, further messages and abuse were still being posted to social networking sites. With Todd's mental state worsening, she began to engage in [[Self-harm|self-mutilation]] and cutting.&lt;ref name="Transcript" /&gt; Despite taking her prescribed anti-depressants and receiving counseling, she overdosed and was hospitalized for two days.&lt;ref name="Transcript" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Keneally|first=Meghan|title=Tragedy as girl, 15, kills herself just one month after posting desperate YouTube plea begging bullies to stop tormenting her|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2216543/Amanda-Todd-Canadian-teen-kills-desperate-video-plea-begging-bullies-stop.html|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=October 13, 2012|location=London|date=October 12, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20121013084629/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2216543/Amanda-Todd-Canadian-teen-kills-desperate-video-plea-begging-bullies-stop.html|archivedate=October 13, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Todd was taunted by other students at her school for her low grades, a consequence of a [[language-based learning disability]], and for the time she spent in hospital to treat her severe depression.&lt;ref name="VancouverSun"&gt;{{cite news|last=Shaw|first=Gillian|title='She shared everything with me': Amanda Todd's mother talks about her life with her daughter|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/health/shared+everything+with+Amanda+Todd+mother+talks+about+life/7419475/story.html|accessdate=October 21, 2012|newspaper=vancouversun.com|date=October 20, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022210457/http://www.vancouversun.com/health/shared+everything+with+Amanda+Todd+mother+talks+about+life/7419475/story.html|archivedate=October 22, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It didn't really help that after she got out of the hospital recently some kids started calling her 'psycho' and saying she had been in the crazy hospital," her mother said.

=== Mainstream media ===
Michelle Dean of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' compared Todd's death to the [[suicide of Tyler Clementi]], an [[LGBT]] student at [[Rutgers University]] who jumped to his death from the [[George Washington Bridge]] after his roommate encouraged friends to watch a live stream of Clementi kissing another man. In an early piece questioning the assumptions of perpetrators of [[nonconsensual pornography]], she quotes [[Mary Anne Franks]]:{{quote|Women have become, as Franks put it, "unwilling avatars", unable to control their own images online, and then told to put up with it for the sake of "freedom", for the good of the community. And then they are incorrectly told, even if the public is behind them, that they have no remedies in the law. They are shouted down by people with a view of freedom of speech more literal than that held by any judge.}}
and concludes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dean|first1=Michelle|title=The Story of Amanda Todd|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-story-of-amanda-todd|website=newyorker.com|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]|year=2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713103045/http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-story-of-amanda-todd|archivedate=July 13, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|...[But] whatever Amanda Todd might have been thinking, whatever else might be true, she did get one thing out of this: Amanda Todd did manage to, just once, tell her own story.

''[[Vancouver Magazine]]'' entitled a piece on Todd "The Girl Who Woke Up the World"; in 2012 she was the third-most [[Google]]d person, and by 2013 vigils had been held in 38 countries.

===Legislative impact===
In 2012 a motion was introduced in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] by parliamentarian [[Dany Morin]] of the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] in response to the death of Todd. The motion proposed a study of the scope of bullying in Canada, and for more funding and support for anti-bullying organizations. It was also intended to lay the groundwork for a national strategy to prevent bullying. Morin himself had experienced bullying in school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/in-wake-of-amanda-todd-suicide-mps-to-debate-anti-bullying-motion-1.995254 |title= In wake of Amanda Todd suicide, MPs to debate anti-bullying motion |publisher=CTV News |date= October 14, 2012 |author=CTVNews.ca Staff |accessdate= October 17, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MMlIcGEg?url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/in-wake-of-amanda-todd-suicide-mps-to-debate-anti-bullying-motion-1.995254 |archivedate= January 4, 2014 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Criminal procedure (trial)}}

A '''suspended sentence''' is a legal term for a judge's delaying of a defendant's serving of a sentence after they have been found guilty, in order to allow the defendant to perform a period of [[probation]]. If the defendant does not break the law during that period, and fulfills the particular conditions of the probation, the judge usually dismisses the sentence.

==Australia==
{{See also|Punishment in Australia}}
In Australia, suspended sentences are commonly imposed in order to alleviate the strain on overcrowded prisons. For example, an individual may be sentenced to a six-month jail term, wholly suspended for six months; if they commit any other offence during that year, the original jail term is immediately applied in addition to any other sentence.

As of 1 September, 2014, suspended sentences no longer exist in Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/01/suspended-prison-sentences-now-banned-in-all-victorian-courts|title=Suspended sentences scrapped in all Victorian courts|first=Australian Associated|last=Press|date=1 September 2014|website=the Guardian|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==People's Republic of China==
{{unreferencedsect|date=October 2015}}
In the [[People's Republic of China]] (excluding [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]), both suspended sentences and suspended ''sentencing'' ({{zh|缓刑}}, also translated as a sentence "with reprieve") are featured in the criminal law. In the first situation, a fixed term sentence of three years or below can be suspended. In the second situation, sentencing does not immediately follow the guilty verdict, but instead is determined after a period of [[probation]].

[[Capital punishment|Death sentences]] can also be suspended (called a "[[death sentence with reprieve]]"), so that an offender who does not intentionally re-offend during the two-year suspension period would have the sentence commuted to a life sentence.

==Finland==
{{unreferencedsect|date=October 2015}}
A suspended sentence is called ''ehdollinen vankeusrangaistus'' in Finnish, which translates to "conditional imprisonment". When a sentence of imprisonment is imposed conditionally, the enforcement of the sentence is postponed for a probation period. The length of the probation period is at least one and at most three years. The probation period begins at the pronouncement or the issue of the judgment. When conditional imprisonment is imposed, the convicted person shall be notified, in connection with the pronouncement or the issue of the judgment, of the date when the probation period ends and of the grounds on which the sentence may be ordered to be enforced. 

The court may order the enforcement of conditional imprisonment if the convicted person commits an offence during the probation period and the charge has been brought within one year of the end of the probation period. In this event, the conditional sentence to be enforced, the sentence for the offence committed during the probation period and the sentences of imprisonment for the other offences considered in the same trial shall be joined as one unconditional sentence of imprisonment. The court may also order that conditional imprisonment be enforced only in part, in which case the remainder of the sentence shall continue to be conditional, subject to the same probation period.

==Ireland==
In the [[law of the Republic of Ireland]], the 2006 law by which a suspended sentence is activated was ruled [[Constitution of Ireland|unconstitutional]] in 2016. The 2006 law required that a court decision on whether to activate the suspended sentence be made as soon as a later conviction was handed down, even if there was an [[Appeal (law)|appeal]] pending for the later conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2016/0419/782865-high-court-suspended/|title=Suspended sentence law deemed 'unconstitutional'|date=19 April 2016|work=[[RTÉ.ie]]|accessdate=19 April 2016}}; {{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/suspended-sentences-are-rendered-useless-by-ruling-1.2616639|title=Suspended sentences  are rendered useless by ruling|last=Carolan|first=Mary|date=20 April 2016|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=20 April 2016}};  {{cite web|url=http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/en_act_2006_0026.htm#id1152029045.17|title=Criminal Justice Act 2006 [as amended]|date=11 February 2016|work=Revised Acts|publisher=[[Law Reform Commission (Ireland)|Law Reform Commission]]|nopp=Y|page=§99.

==Japan==
{{nihongo|Suspended sentences|執行猶予|shikkō yūyo}} are common practice in [[Japan]] and can be applied in cases where a sentence is for up to 3 years in prison and/or 500,000 yen in fines. Any criminal activity during the period of the suspended sentence will result in the cancellation of the sentence and imprisonment for the prescribed term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.go.jp/saiban/qa_keizi/qa_keizi_28/index.html|title=裁判手続 刑事事件Q&amp;A 執行猶予が付いているとどうなるのですか|publisher=[[Supreme Court of Japan]]|date=2005|accessdate=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
A suspended sentence can be applied if the term of imprisonment is under two years and the offender agrees to comply with court requirements including a curfew, performing [[unpaid work]] and rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/about-sentencing/types-of-sentence/suspended-sentences/|title=Suspended sentences|author=Sentencing Council|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, 5% of convictions resulted in a suspended sentence, compared to 7% immediate custodial sentences.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- Percentage calculated from "all offences" column (immediate/suspended custodial sentences respectively divided by "all sentenced") in the spreadsheet linked here: --&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/criminal-justice-statistics-quarterly|title=MoJ Sentencing Statistics|author=Ministry of Justice|date=17 May 2018|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the United States, it is common practice for judges to hand down suspended sentences to first-time offenders who have committed a minor crime, and for [[prosecutor]]s to recommend suspended sentences as part of a [[plea bargain]]. They are often given to mitigate the effect of penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/s/suspended-sentence/ |title=Suspended Sentence Law &amp; Legal Definition |work=Legal Terms, Definitions, and Dictionary |publisher=USLegal.com |accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some jurisdictions, the [[criminal record]] of the guilty party will still carry the offense, even after [[probation]] is adequately served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manitobacourts.mb.ca/definitions.html |title=Definitions: Understanding Legal Words |date= 23 October 2006 |publisher=Manitoba Courts |accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, the process of [[deferred adjudication]] prevents the conviction from appearing on a person's criminal record, once probation had been completed.

In the federal system, judges' authority to suspend sentences has been abolished, by the [[Sentencing Reform Act]] of 1984, through the [[United States Sentencing Commission]], and upheld by ''[[Mistretta v. United States]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

'''Swedish Greeks''', also known as '''Greek Swedes''', consist of people of Greek nationality who have settled in [[Sweden]], as well as Swedish people and Swedish residents of Greek heritage.

There are 17,060 people born in [[Greece]] living in Sweden today, as well as 14,097 people born in Sweden with at least one parent born in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Asadulah Naghdi, [http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ass/article/viewFile/8006/5998 “Iranian Diaspora: With focus on Iranian Immigrants in Sweden,”] ''Asian Social Science'' Vol. 6, No. 11; November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2013}} &lt;ref name="scb"&gt;http://www.scb.se/Statistik/BE/BE0101/2011A01B/be0101_Fodelseland_och_ursprungsland.xls&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Synchrony''' and '''diachrony''' are two different and complementary viewpoints in [[linguistic]] analysis. A synchronic approach (from Greek συν- "together" and χρόνος "time") considers a language at a moment in time without taking its history into account. Synchronic linguistics aims at describing a language at a specific point of time, usually the present. By contrast, a [[historic linguistics|diachronic]] approach (from δια- "through" and χρόνος "time") considers the development and evolution of a language through history. [[Historical linguistics]] is typically a diachronic study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9027272077 |title=Synchrony and Diachrony: A dynamic interface |editor1-last=Giacalone Ramat |editor1-first=Anna |editor2-last=Mauri |editor2-first=Caterina |editor3-last=Molinelli |editor3-first=Piera |isbn=9027272077 |pages=17, 18 |publisher=John Benjamins North America |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |date=2013 |access-date=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts were theorized by the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], professor of general linguistics in [[Geneva]] from 1896 to 1911, and appeared in writing in his posthumous ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]'' published in 1916. In contrast with most of his predecessors, who focused on historical evolution of languages, Saussure emphasized the primacy of synchronic analysis of languages to understand their inner functioning, though never forgetting the importance of complementary diachrony. This dualistic opposition has been carried over into [[philosophy]] and [[sociology]], for instance by [[Roland Barthes]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. [[Jacques Lacan]] also used it for [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Four_Fundamental_Concepts_of_Psycho.html?id=5guFfqA6l0UC&amp;redir_esc=y|title=The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis |author-last=Lacan |author-first=Jacques |editor1-last=Miller |editor1-first=Jacques-Alain |isbn=0393317757 |pages=46 |publisher=Éditions du Seuil |location=France |date=1978 |access-date=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to de Saussure, many similar concepts were also developed independently by [[Poland|Polish]] linguists [[Jan Baudouin de Courtenay]] and [[Mikołaj Kruszewski]] of the [[Kazan school]], who used the terms '''statics''' and '''dynamics''' of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=BQfDosHckzEC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;dq|title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Linguistics |author-last=Allan |author-first=Keith  |isbn= 9780199585847 |pages=172 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=United Kingdom |date=2013 |access-date=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tlaxcalans''', or '''Talaxcaltecs''', are an indigenous group of [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] ethnicity who inhabited the republic of [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]] and present-day [[Mexican state]] of [[Tlaxcala]].

==Pre-Columbian history==
The Tlaxcaltecs were originally a conglomeration of three distinct ethnic groups who spoke [[Nahuatl]], [[Otomi language|Otomi]], and [[Pinome]].  Eventually, the Nahuatl speakers became the dominant ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Gibson, Tlaxcala in the Sixteenth Century{{page needed|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite early attempts by the [[Mexica]], the Tlaxcalteca were never conquered by the [[Aztec Triple Alliance]].  The Aztecs allowed them to maintain their independence so that they could participate in the xochiyaoyatl ([[flower war]]s) with them to facilitate [[Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|human sacrifice]].&lt;ref&gt;Diego Muñoz, ''Historia de Tlaxcala''{{page needed|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spanish colonial history==
[[Image:LienzodeTlaxcalaLamina5.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Lienzo de Tlaxcala]] image depicting Tlaxcaltec soldiers leading a Spanish soldier to [[Chalco (altépetl)|Chalco]]]]
The Tlaxcaltecs served as allies to [[Hernán Cortés]] and his fellow Spanish [[conquistadors]], and were instrumental in the invasion of [[Tenochtitlan]], capital of the Aztec empire, helping the Spanish reach the Valley of [[Anahuac Valley|Anahuac]] and providing a key contingent of the invasion force.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]], ''The Discovery and Conquest of Mexico''{{page needed|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to their alliance with the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Crown]] in the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire#Alliance with Tlaxcalteca|conquest of Mexico]], the Tlaxcaltecs enjoyed some privileges among the indigenous peoples of Mexico, including the right to carry [[firearm|guns]], ride [[horse]]s, hold noble title, and to rule their settlements autonomously.

The Tlaxcaltecs were also instrumental in the establishment of a number of settlements in Northern Mexico (including parts of present-day southeastern [[Texas]]), where conquest of local tribes by the Spaniards had proved unfruitful.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Orozco y Berra, ''Historia antigua y de la conquista de México''{{page needed|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were taken to areas inhabited by nomadic bellicose tribes (known as the [[Chichimeca]]) to serve as examples for the local indigenous groups of sedentary model subjects of the Spanish Crown and to work in mines and haciendas.

The Tlaxcaltec colonies in the Chichimeca included settlements in the modern  states of [[San Luis Potosí]], [[Zacatecas]], [[Durango]], [[Coahuila]], [[Nuevo León]]—Nueva Tlaxcala de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe de Horcasistas, today known as [[Guadalupe, Nuevo León|Guadalupe]], and Santiago de las Sabinas, today known as [[Sabinas Hidalgo]]—and [[Jalisco]] (Villa de Nueva Tlaxcala de Quiahuistlán, today known as [[Colotlán]]).

__NOTOC__
The '''Toucouleur people''', also called '''Tukulor''' or '''[[wikt:Haalpulaar|Haalpulaar]]''' are a [[West Africa]]n ethnic group native to [[Futa Tooro]] region of [[Senegal]]. There are smaller communities in [[Mali]] and [[Mauritania]].&lt;ref name="Gates2010p500"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony Appiah|author2=Henry Louis Gates|title=Encyclopedia of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0XNvklcqbwC |year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533770-9|pages=500–501}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Toucouleur were [[islamized]] in the 11th century; their early and strong Islamic heritage, which is seen as a defining feature, is a "matter of great pride for them".&lt;ref name="Gates2010p500"/&gt;&lt;ref name=brittukulor&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tukulor Tukulor], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; They have been influential in the spread of Islam to West Africa in the medieval era, later founded the vast [[Toucouleur Empire]] in the 19th century under [[El Hadj Umar Tall]] that led a religious war against their neighboring ethnic groups and the French colonial forces.&lt;ref name=brittukulor/&gt;&lt;ref name=doniger1116&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP_f9icf2roC&amp;pg=PA1116|year=1999|publisher=Merriam-Webster|isbn=978-0-87779-044-0|page=1116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They speak the [[Pulaar language]], and are distinct from but related to the [[Fula people|Fula]], [[Wolof people|Wolof]] and [[Serer people]].&lt;ref name=brittukulor/&gt; The Toucouleur are traditionally sedentary, settled primarily in the [[Senegal River]] valley, with farming, fishing and raising cattle as their main activities. The Toucouleur society has been patrilineal, polygynous and with high social stratification that included slavery and caste system.&lt;ref name="Gates2010p500"/&gt;&lt;ref name=brittukulor/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tal Tamari| year= 1991|title= The Development of Caste Systems in West Africa| journal= The Journal of African History| volume= 32| number= 2| pages= 221–250|publisher= Cambridge University Press| jstor= 182616| doi=10.1017/s0021853700025718}}, Quote: "Endogamous artisan and musician groups are characteristic of over fifteen West African peoples, including the Manding, Soninke, Wolof, Serer, Fulani, '''Tukulor''', Songhay, Dogon, Senufo, Minianka, Moors, and Tuareg."&lt;/ref&gt; There are an estimated 1 million Toucouleur people in West Africa.&lt;ref name="Gates2010p500"/&gt;

==Distribution and languages==
[[File:Senegalrivermap.png|thumb|left|upright=0.75|The Toucouleur trace their roots to the Senegal River valley at the border of Senegal and Mauritania.]]
They are found primarily in the northern regions of Senegal where they constitute 15% of the population. This region is irrigated by the [[Senegal River]] valley, overlaps southern [[Mauritania]]. During the colonial era, and in the modern times, some of the Toucouleurs resettled in western [[Mali]].&lt;ref name=brittukulor/&gt; They are about a million Toucouleur people in Senegal River valley area, and about 100,000 in Mali.&lt;ref name="Gates2010p500"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Phillips|first=David J.|title=Peoples on the Move: Introducing the Nomads of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=54gyRnhIugkC&amp;pg=PA161|year=2001|publisher=William Carey Library|isbn=978-0-87808-352-7| pages=155, 161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pulaar language, also called the Fula or Fulani language, is their first language. It is an Atlantic branch of the Niger-Congo language family of languages.&lt;ref name=brittukulor/&gt; Locally, they are variously referred to as ''{{lang-fuc|Torooɓe}}'', ''Futanke'', or ''Haalpulaar'' (French literature).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roy M. Dilley|title=Nearly Native, Barely Civilized: Henri Gaden’s Journey through Colonial French West Africa (1894-1939)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yK-2AgAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-90-04-26528-8|pages=1, 319–320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Toucouleur'' is of unclear origin, with some sources stating it as a [[French language|French]] derivation meaning "of color", which may be a [[folk etymology]]. Other sources citing it as a deformation of ''tekruri'' a pre-colonial term meaning "people from Tekrur", considering them the descendants of the West African kingdom of [[Takrur]] that thrived between the 5th and 13th centuries.&lt;ref name="Shoup2011p97"&gt;{{cite book|author=John A.

==History==
According to the [[oral tradition]]s of the Toucouleurs and [[Serer people]], the Toucouleurs are descendants of Serer and [[Fula people|Fula]] ancestors.&lt;ref name="Fol"/&gt; This tradition is supported by many scholars including Foltz and Phillips.&lt;ref name="Fol"&gt;Foltz, William J., "From French West Africa to the Mali Federation", Volume 12 of Yale studies in political science, p 136, [[Yale University Press]] (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Phillips|first=David J.|title=Peoples on the Move: Introducing the Nomads of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=54gyRnhIugkC&amp;pg=PA161|year=2001|publisher=William Carey Library|isbn=978-0-87808-352-7}}, p 161&lt;/ref&gt; A mutually acceptable bantering-style interaction, called the [[joking relationship]] by anthropologists, exists [[Serer people#Joking relationship (Maasir or Kalir)|between the Serers and Toucouleurs]].&lt;ref&gt;Foltz, William J., "From French West Africa to the Mali Federation", Volume 12.  Yale studies in political science, p136. Yale University Press, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Toucouleur people have long inhabited the Senegal River area, with roots of an organized Tekrur kingdom tracing back to the 5th century.&lt;ref name="Shoup2011p97"/&gt; They were part of the 10th to the 18th century kingdom, but led by non-Toucouleur rulers from other ethnic groups. In the 18th century, a Toucouleur empire emerged which reached its peak influence in the 19th century under the Islamic leader [[El Hadj Umar Tall]].&lt;ref name="Gates2010p500"/&gt; Umar was born in a Toucouleur clerical family in 1797.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony Appiah|author2=Henry Louis Gates|title=Encyclopedia of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0XNvklcqbwC |year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533770-9|page=519}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his visit to Mecca in 1827, he was designated as the Caliph of Black Africa. He returned to West Africa in 1833, and learnt political and state building strategies from his father-in-law in [[Sokoto Caliphate]].&lt;ref name=doniger1116/&gt;

[[File:Umars jihad state map general c1864.png|thumb|The [[Toucouleur Empire]] of [[El Hadj Umar Tall]] expanded from [[Futa Toro]] into new regions (red) in the 19th century.]]
Umar Tall returned to Senegal in 1845, where he began preaching Islam among the Toucouleur people. Umar Tall obtained weapons from Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony Appiah|author2=Henry Louis Gates|title=Encyclopedia of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0XNvklcqbwC |year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533770-9|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; then mobilized the Toucouleur to pursue an [[Jihad#Jihad as warfare|Islamic holy war]] in 1854 against the pagan ethnic groups and those Muslims who have strayed.&lt;ref name=doniger1116/&gt; The Toucouleur armies succeeded. The [[Toucouleur Empire]] grew and extended from Senegal to much of Mali over the next ten years. His son Mustafa reigned this empire and Teucouleur people between 1864 and 1870, followed by Umar Tall's second son named Ahmadu Seku. The rule of Ahmadu Seku, state Gallieni and Joffre was a "Toucouleur-Muslim despot" over the [[Mandinka people]] and [[Bambara people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Barnett Singer|author2=John Langdon|author3=John W. Langdon|title=Cultured Force: Makers and Defenders of the French Colonial Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IAzkoxSB4MwC&amp;pg=PA120|year=2008|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-19904-3|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The empire collapsed in the 1880s as the Fulani, Tuaregs and the Moors attacked the Toucouleurs,&lt;ref name=doniger1116/&gt; and a civil war between local Toucouleur leaders engulfed the region. The empire ended in 1891, after the French colonial forces invaded the region.&lt;ref name="Gates2010p500"/&gt;

==People and society==
{{double image|right|Boilat-19-Toucoulaure.jpg|150|ToucouleuresBoundou.jpg|133|Toucouleur marabout (left) and women in traditional dresses (19th century).}}
The Toucouleurs speak the Futa Tooro dialect of [[Pulaar language|Pulaar]]. They call themselves ''Haalpulaar’en'', which means "those who speak Pulaar". They are Muslims. Culturally, the Toucouleur differ from other Fula people by the sedentary nature of their society.

===Social stratification===
Toucouleur society is [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] and divided into strict and rigid caste [[hierarchy|hierarchies]].&lt;ref name="Gates2010p500"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Hélène Le Divelec (1967), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41231043 Les "nouvelles" classes sociales en milieu urbain : le cas du Sénégal et celui du Nigéria du Nord], ''Civilisations'', Institut de Sociologie de l'Université de Bruxelles, Vol. 17, No. 3 (1967), pages 240-253; Quote: "In Senegal too the social structure is based on a rigid system of castes, each having a specific political, economic or ritual function. Caste antagonisms are much more important than tribal differences. "&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest status among the five Toucouleur [[caste]]s is of the aristocratic leaders and Islamic scholars called ''Torobe''. Below them are the ''Rimbe'', or the administrators, traders and farmers. The ''Nyenbe'' are the artisan castes of the Toucouleur society. The fourth caste strata is called the ''Gallunkobe'' or the slaves or descendants of slaves "who have been freed". The bottom strata among the Toucouleurs are the ''Matyube'' or slaves.&lt;ref name="Gates2010p500"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Milet2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Milet|title=Mali: Magie d'un fleuve aux confins du désert|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DC0Dj2if8DwC&amp;pg=PA104|year=2007|publisher=Paris: Editions Olizane|language=French|isbn=978-2-88086-351-7|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slaves were acquired by raiding pagan ethnic groups or purchased in slave markets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Amin | first=Samir | title=Underdevelopment and Dependence in Black Africa — Origins and Contemporary Forms | journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=10 | issue=04 | year=1972 | page=503 | doi=10.1017/s0022278x00022801 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the status was inherited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin A. Klein|title=Islam and Imperialism in Senegal: Sine-Saloum, 1847-1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JPSrAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA7|year=1968|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-0621-6|pages=7–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hierarchical social stratification has been an economically closed system, which historically has meant a marked inequality. Property and land has been exclusively owned by the upper caste members.&lt;ref name=brittukulor/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Tzeutschler | first=Gregory G. A. | title=Growing security: land rights and agricultural development in northern Senegal | journal=Journal of African Law | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=43 | issue=01 | year=1999 | page=36 | doi=10.1017/s0021855300008718 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Occupations and caste memberships are inherited. The Toucouleur castes have been endogamous, segregated and intermarriage has been rare.&lt;ref&gt;John MOGEY and Heinz BACHMANN (1986), Kinship under two Strategies of Development, ''Journal of Comparative Family Studies'', Vol. 17, No. 2 (SUMMER 1986), pages 233-244&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=seesemann154&gt;{{cite book|author=Rüdiger Seesemann|title=The Divine Flood |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=e_PvtXMQDfgC&amp;pg=PA154 |year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-538432-1|pages=154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clerics among Toucouleur like the [[Wolof people]] formed a separate group. The religious leaders were not necessarily endogamous nor an inherited post in Toucouleur people's long history, but it has been rare for lower caste people to become religious specialist, states Rüdiger Seesemann, as they were viewed as not sufficiently adhering to the "clerical standards of piety".&lt;ref name=seesemann154/&gt;

===Marriage===
[[File:Toucouleur-Interprète.jpg|thumb|A Toucouleur interpreter called Alpha Sega with his sisters.  Image taken in 1882.]] 
Marriage among the Toucouleurs requires a [[bride price]] payable to the bride's family. A girl from high social status family such as of noble lineage expects substantially higher payment than one of lower status such as artisan castes or with slave lineage.&lt;ref name=brittukulor/&gt;

The marriage is validated by a mosque. The bride comes to live with her husband's joint family. Traditionally, before the marriage is consummated, the bride's aunt checks if the girl is a virgin, then bathes and massages her. The bride and groom then join in a wedding feast where the village members join in, marking the start of a new couple.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Childbirth and naming===
One week after ''pémbougale'' (childbirth), the baby is named and a ''gorgol'' (sister of the father) cuts its hair. The father tells the [[marabout]] the name he has chosen, after which the marabout whispers the name in the infant's ear and prays. Following this, the marabout informs a ''gawlo'' "[[griot]]", of the name that has been chosen, and the griot announces the name to the village.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

'''''True Files''''' ([[Simplified Chinese|Chinese]]: 真实档案) is an [[English language]] [[television]] docu-[[drama]] telecast on  [[MediaCorp Channel 5]], with each episode (except the last episode of Season 3, ''The Unsolved'') re-enacting major [[Criminal trial|criminal trial proceedings]], mostly of [[murder]], in [[Singapore]]. When the inaugural season was telecast in 2002, its first episode was re-slotted to be telecast later, when numerous public feedback was received by the station complaining that it was too graphic after watching trailers for the pilot episode. The show was also pushed back to a 10 p.m. time slot from the second episode onwards as a result. Nonetheless, the hype helped the show to enjoy favourable viewership ratings. Over five years, a total of five seasons had been telecasted, with the final season airing in 2007.

The show was hosted and narrated by veteran actor [[Lim Kay Tong]] from Seasons 1 to 4. In Season 5, the host is [[Tay Ping Hui]], and the narration is done by Brian Richmond.

==Trivia==
*The legal consultant for Seasons 1 and 2 is Senior Counsel R Palakrishnan. After Palakrishnan died in July 2003, the same year as Season 2's first telecast, [[Subhas Anandan]] becomes the new legal consultant for this docu-drama from Season 3 onwards, which first aired in the following year (2004).
*The closing credits for Seasons 1 and 2 flipped from page to page on a black screen, accompanied by random music. In Season 3, the closing credits scrolled from bottom-to-top in a red background similar to a scene in the opening sequence, featuring the allegory of justice found at the entrance of the [[Old Supreme Court Building, Singapore|old Supreme Court building in Singapore]]; as well as accompaniment by only the opening theme music. This background and music continued to be used for closing credits in Seasons 4 and 5, except that the credits flipped from page to page as per Seasons 1 and 2.
*The front gate of [[Changi Prison]], despite appearing in the opening sequence throughout the first season (and the opening sequence would remain unchanged throughout the entire telecast), only appeared as a background in one of the last episodes for that season, ''The Burnt Body Case'', when the date of execution for that accused was revealed near to the end of the episode. This background would continue to be used at the end of most episodes in Seasons 2 and 3, either revealing the date of execution or the verdict for the accused, or any important information or records (such as in ''The Story Of Koh Swee Beng'', it mentioned about the number of prisoners on Death Row being pardoned by the President of Singapore over a period of time). It was last used in ''Fatal Step'', the second last episode of Season 3 and the last episode in that season to feature a High Court case (due to the following and last episode, ''The Unsolved'', being a special, did not feature any High Court case as the murderers were never found).

==Buildings and capacity==
It has an enrolment of over 370 students in 2012 and has reached its accommodation capacity. It has a class block (known as "the Old Class block") because of its age. The classblock has eight classrooms, a science lab, a computer lab, the English staffroom, and the Maths staffroom. There is a Technical and Applied Studies block which contains a TAS staffroom, three classrooms, a cooking room, a computer lab, and at the end (a demountable) an ex-science lab, now used as a classroom. There are woodwork and metalwork rooms in a building known as "the Hackey". There is another class block (known as "the New Classblock" or the "Brian Roberts Classblock"), which contains an Art/Music staffroom, HSIE staffroom, three classrooms, a music room, art rooms, and soon to be computer lab. There are offices in the historic McCaughey house.

There are 12 dormitory buildings (Mutch, Gardiner, Breakwell, Hindmarsh, Mason, Gosper, Eadis, Hyatt, Hilton and the pods ) where students sleep; girls and boys are separated from access after certain times.

==History==
YAHS was sited on land originally owned by [[Samuel McCaughey|Sir Samuel McCaughey]] (pronounced Mac-cak-ey). Most of the original farm land was resumed by the state government but over {{convert|700|acre|ha}} were eventually turned into a school. It was opened in March 1922 but in that time students cleaned it up and made it fit for a school. The front building (McCaughey) is still there and is used as administrative offices.
