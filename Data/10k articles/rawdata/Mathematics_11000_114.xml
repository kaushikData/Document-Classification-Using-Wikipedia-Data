In [[mathematics]], especially in the area of [[algebraic topology]] known as [[stable homotopy theory]], the '''Adams filtration''' and the '''Adams-Novikov filtration''' allow a stable homotopy group to be understood as built from layers, the ''n''th layer containing just those maps which require at most ''n'' auxiliary spaces in order to be a composition of homologically trivial maps.  These filtrations are of particular interest because the [[Adams spectral sequence|Adams (-Novikov) spectral sequence]] converges to them.

==Definition==
The [[group (mathematics)|group]] of stable homotopy classes [''X'',''Y''] between two [[spectrum (homotopy theory)|spectra]] ''X'' and ''Y'' can be given a [[filtration (mathematics)|filtration]] by saying that a map ''f'': ''X'' → ''Y'' has filtration ''n'' if it can be written as a composite of maps ''X'' = ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; → ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ... → ''X''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = ''Y'' such that each individual map ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt; induces the zero map in some fixed [[homology theory]] ''E''. If ''E'' is ordinary mod-''p'' [[singular homology|homology]], this filtration is called the '''Adams filtration''', otherwise the '''Adams-Novikov filtration'''.

[[File:Amicable numbers rods 220 and 284.png|thumb|Demonstration, with rods, of the amicability of the pair of numbers (220,284)]]

'''Amicable numbers''' are two different [[number]]s so related that the [[addition|sum]] of the [[proper divisor]]s of each is equal to the other number. (A proper divisor of a number is a positive factor of that number other than the number itself. For example, the proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3.) A pair of amicable numbers constitutes an [[aliquot sequence]] of [[Periodic sequence|period]] 2. A related concept is that of a [[perfect number]], which is a number that equals the sum of ''its own'' proper divisors, in other words a number which forms an aliquot sequence of period 1. Numbers that are members of an aliquot sequence with period greater than 2 are known as [[sociable number]]s.

The smallest pair of amicable numbers is ([[220 (number)|220]], [[284 (number)|284]]). They are amicable because the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110, of which the sum is 284; and the proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142, of which the sum is 220.

The first ten amicable pairs are: (220, 284), (1184, 1210), (2620, 2924), (5020, 5564), (6232, 6368), (10744, 10856), (12285, 14595), (17296, 18416), (63020, 76084), and (66928, 66992). {{OEIS|id=A259180}}. (Also see {{oeis|id=A002025}} and {{oeis|id=A002046}})

== History ==
Amicable numbers were known to the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]], who credited them with many mystical properties. A general formula by which some of these numbers could be derived was invented circa 850 by the [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] mathematician [[Thābit ibn Qurra]] (826–901). Other [[Arab]] mathematicians who studied amicable numbers are [[Maslamah Ibn Ahmad al-Majriti|al-Majriti]] (died 1007), [[Ibn Tahir al-Baghdadi|al-Baghdadi]] (980–1037), and [[Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī|al-Fārisī]] (1260–1320). The [[Iran]]ian mathematician [[Muhammad Baqir Yazdi]] (16th century) discovered the pair (9363584, 9437056), though this has often been attributed to [[René Descartes|Descartes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Costello |first = Patrick  | title = New Amicable Pairs Of Type (2; 2) And Type (3; 2)  | journal = Mathematics of Computation | volume = 72 | pages = 489–497 | publisher = American Mathematical Society  | date = 1 May 2002 | url = http://www.ams.org/mcom/2003-72-241/S0025-5718-02-01414-X/S0025-5718-02-01414-X.pdf | accessdate = 19 April 2007 |issue=241 | doi = 10.1090/S0025-5718-02-01414-X}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the work of [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Eastern mathematicians]] in this area has been forgotten.

Thābit ibn Qurra's formula was rediscovered by [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]] (1601–1665) and [[René Descartes|Descartes]] (1596–1650), to whom it is sometimes ascribed, and extended by [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] (1707–1783). It was extended further by [[Walter Borho|Borho]] in 1972. Fermat and Descartes also rediscovered pairs of amicable numbers known to Arab mathematicians. Euler also discovered dozens of new pairs.&lt;ref name=Sandifer/&gt; The second smallest pair, (1184, 1210), was discovered in 1866 by a then teenage B. Nicolò I. Paganini (not to be confused with the composer and violinist), having been overlooked by earlier mathematicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sprugnoli|first=Renzo|title=Introduzione alla matematica: La matematica della scuola media|url=http://www.dsi.unifi.it/~resp/media.pdf|publisher=Universita degli Studi di Firenze: Dipartimento di Sistemi e Informatica|accessdate=21 August 2012|page=59|language=Italian|date=27 September 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913033238/http://www.dsi.unifi.it/~resp/media.pdf|archivedate=13 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1946 there were 390 known pairs, but the advent of computers has allowed the discovery of many thousands since then. Exhaustive searches have been carried out to find all pairs less than a given bound, this bound being extended from 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; in 1970, to 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; in 1986, 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; in 1993, 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; in 2015, and to 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; in 2016.

{{as of|2018|November}}, there are over 1,222,214,178 known amicable pairs.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Chernykh [http://sech.me/ap/ Amicable pairs list]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rules for generation ==
While these rules do generate some pairs of amicable numbers, many other pairs are known, so these rules are by no means comprehensive.

In particular, the two rules below produce only even amicable pairs, so they are of no interest for the open problem of finding amicable pairs coprime to 210 = 2·3·5·7, while over 1000 pairs coprime to 30 = 2·3·5 are known [García, Pedersen &amp; te Riele (2003), Sándor &amp; Crstici (2004)].  
===Thābit ibn Qurra theorem===
The '''Thābit ibn Qurra theorem''' is a method for discovering amicable numbers invented in the ninth century by the [[Arab]] [[mathematician]] [[Thābit ibn Qurra]].&lt;ref&gt;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ThabitibnKurrahRule.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It states that if
:{{math|''p'' {{=}} 3×2&lt;sup&gt;''n'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}},
:{{math|''q'' {{=}} 3×2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}},
:{{math|''r'' {{=}} 9×2&lt;sup&gt;2''n'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}},
where {{math|''n'' &gt; 1}} is an [[integer]] and {{mvar|p}}, {{mvar|q}}, and {{mvar|r}} are [[prime number]]s, then {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;×''p''×''q''}} and {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;×''r''}} are a pair of amicable numbers. This formula gives the pairs {{math|(220, 284)}} for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2}}, {{math|(17296, 18416)}} for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 4}}, and {{math|(9363584, 9437056)}} for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 7}}, but no other such pairs are known. Numbers of the form {{math|3×2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} are known as [[Thabit number]]s. In order for Ibn Qurra's formula to produce an amicable pair, two consecutive Thabit numbers must be prime; this severely restricts the possible values of {{mvar|n}}.

To establish the theorem, Thâbit ibn Qurra proved nine [[Lemma (mathematics)|lemmas]] divided into two groups. The first three lemmas deal with the determination of the aliquot parts of a natural integer. The second group of lemmas deals more specifically with the formation of perfect, abundant and deficient numbers.&lt;ref name="Rashed"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rashed|first=Roshdi|title=The development of Arabic mathematics: between arithmetic and algebra.|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Dordrecht, Boston, London|year=1994|volume=156|isbn=0-7923-2565-6|page=278,279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Euler's rule===
''Euler's rule'' is a generalization of the Thâbit ibn Qurra theorem. It states that if
:{{math|''p'' {{=}} (2&lt;sup&gt;''n'' − ''m''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1)×2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}},
:{{math|''q'' {{=}} (2&lt;sup&gt;''n'' − ''m''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1)×2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}},
:{{math|''r'' {{=}} (2&lt;sup&gt;''n'' − ''m''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;×2&lt;sup&gt;''m'' + ''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}},
where {{math|''n'' &gt; ''m'' &gt; 0}} are [[integer]]s and {{mvar|p}}, {{mvar|q}}, and {{mvar|r}} are [[prime number]]s, then {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;×''p''×''q''}} and {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;×''r''}} are a pair of amicable numbers. Thābit ibn Qurra's theorem corresponds to the case {{math|''m'' {{=}} ''n'' − 1}}. Euler's rule creates additional amicable pairs for {{math|(''m'',''n'') {{=}} (1,8), (29,40)}} with no others being known. Euler (1747 &amp; 1750) overall found 58 new pairs to make all the by then existing pairs into 61.&lt;ref name=Sandifer&gt;{{cite book | title=How Euler Did It | last=Sandifer | first=C. Edward | isbn=978-0-88385-563-8 | pages=49–55 | year=2007 | publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[William Dunham (mathematician)|William Dunham]] in a video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-DV26x6n_Q&amp;t=37m An Evening with Leonhard Euler – YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regular pairs ==
Let ({{mvar|m}}, {{mvar|n}}) be a pair of amicable numbers with {{math|''m'' &lt; ''n''}}, and write {{math|''m'' {{=}} ''gM''}} and {{math|''n'' {{=}} ''gN''}} where {{mvar|g}} is the [[greatest common divisor]] of {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}}. If {{mvar|M}} and {{mvar|N}} are both [[coprime]] to {{mvar|g}} and [[Square-free integer|square free]] then the pair ({{mvar|m}}, {{mvar|n}}) is said to be '''regular''' {{OEIS|A215491}}, otherwise it is called '''irregular''' or '''exotic'''. If ({{mvar|m}}, {{mvar|n}}) is regular and {{mvar|M}} and {{mvar|N}} have {{mvar|i}} and {{mvar|j}} prime factors respectively, then {{math|(''m'', ''n'')}} is said to be of '''type''' {{math|(''i'', ''j'')}}.

For example, with {{math|(''m'', ''n'') {{=}} (220, 284)}}, the greatest common divisor is {{math|4}} and so {{math|''M'' {{=}} 55}} and {{math|''N'' {{=}} 71}}. Therefore, {{math|(220, 284)}} is regular of type {{math|(2, 1)}}.

== Twin amicable pairs ==
An amicable pair {{math|(''m'', ''n'')}} is twin if there are no integers between {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}} belonging to any other amicable pair {{OEIS|A273259}}.

== Other results ==
In every known case, the numbers of a pair are either both [[Even and odd numbers|even]] or both odd. It is not known whether an even-odd pair of amicable numbers exists, but if it does, the even number must either be a square number or twice one, and the odd number must be a square number. However, amicable numbers where the two members have different smallest prime factors do exist: there are seven such pairs known.&lt;ref&gt;http://sech.me/ap/news.html#20160130&lt;/ref&gt; Also, every known pair shares at least one common prime [[Divisor|factor]]. It is not known whether a pair of [[coprime]] amicable numbers exists, though if any does, the [[product (mathematics)|product]] of the two must be greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;67&lt;/sup&gt;.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Also, a pair of coprime amicable numbers cannot be generated by Thabit's formula (above), nor by any similar formula.

In 1955, [[Paul Erdős]] showed that the density of amicable numbers, relative to the positive integers, was 0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Erdős|first1=Paul|title=On amicable numbers|journal=Publicationes Mathematicae Debrecen|date=1955|volume=4|pages=108–111|url=https://www.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/1955-03.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the sum of amicable pairs conjecture, as the number of the amicable numbers approaches infinity, the percentage of the sums of the amicable pairs divisible by ten approaches 100% {{OEIS|A291422}}.

== Generalizations ==

=== Amicable tuples ===
Amicable numbers &lt;math&gt;(m, n)&lt;/math&gt; satisfy &lt;math&gt;\sigma(m)-m=n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma(n)-n=m&lt;/math&gt; which can be written together as &lt;math&gt;\sigma(m)=\sigma(n)=m+n&lt;/math&gt;. This can be generalized to larger tuples, say &lt;math&gt;(n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_k)&lt;/math&gt;, where we require

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(n_1)=\sigma(n_2)= \dots =\sigma(n_k) = n_1+n_2+ \dots +n_k&lt;/math&gt;

For example, (1980, 2016, 2556) is an amicable triple {{OEIS|id=A125490}}, and (3270960, 3361680, 3461040, 3834000) is an amicable quadruple {{OEIS|id=A036471}}.

Amicable [[multiset]]s are defined analogously and generalizes this a bit further {{OEIS|id=A259307}}.

=== Sociable numbers ===
{{main article|Sociable number}}

Sociable numbers are the numbers in cyclic lists of numbers (with a length greater than 2) where each number is the sum of the proper divisors of the preceding number. For example, &lt;math&gt;1264460 \mapsto 1547860 \mapsto 1727636 \mapsto 1305184 \mapsto 1264460 \mapsto\dots&lt;/math&gt; are sociable numbers of order 4.

sum of the proper divisors of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Distributed cycle detection in large-scale sparse graphs|first1=Rodrigo Caetano|last1=Rocha|first2=Bhalchandra|last2=Thatte|year=2015|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.1.1233.8640|publisher=Simpósio Brasileiro de Pesquisa Operacional (SBPO)|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9592">In [[mathematics]], more particularly in the fields of [[dynamical systems]] and [[geometric topology]], an '''Anosov map''' on a [[manifold]] ''M'' is a certain type of mapping, from ''M'' to itself, with rather clearly marked local directions of "expansion" and "contraction". Anosov systems are a special case of [[Axiom A]] systems.

'''Anosov diffeomorphisms''' were introduced by [[Dmitri Anosov|Dmitri Victorovich Anosov]], who proved that their behaviour was in an appropriate sense ''generic'' (when they exist at all).&lt;ref&gt;[[Dmitri Anosov|Dmitri V. Anosov]], ''Geodesic flows on closed Riemannian manifolds with negative curvature'', (1967) Proc. Steklov Inst. Mathematics. '''90'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Three closely related definitions must be distinguished:
* If a differentiable [[map (mathematics)|map]] ''f'' on ''M'' has a [[Hyperbolic set|hyperbolic structure]] on the [[tangent bundle]], then it is called an '''Anosov map'''.  Examples include the [[Bernoulli map]], and [[Arnold's cat map]].
* If the map is a [[diffeomorphism]], then it is called an '''Anosov diffeomorphism'''.
* If a [[flow (mathematics)|flow]] on a manifold splits the tangent bundle into three invariant [[subbundle]]s, with one subbundle that is exponentially contracting, and one that is exponentially expanding, and a third, non-expanding, non-contracting one-dimensional sub-bundle (spanned by the flow direction), then the flow is called an '''Anosov flow'''.

A classical example of Anosov diffeomorphism is the [[Arnold's cat map]].

Anosov proved that Anosov diffeomorphisms are [[structurally stable]] and form an open subset of mappings (flows) with the ''C''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; topology.

Not every manifold admits an Anosov diffeomorphism; for example, there are no such diffeomorphisms on the [[sphere]] . The simplest examples of compact manifolds admitting them are the tori: they admit the so-called '''linear Anosov diffeomorphisms''', which are isomorphisms having no eigenvalue of modulus 1. It was proved that any other Anosov diffeomorphism on a torus is [[topologically conjugate]] to one of this kind.

The problem of classifying manifolds that admit Anosov diffeomorphisms turned out to be very difficult, and still {{As of|2012|lc=on}} has no answer. The only known examples are [[infranil manifold]]s, and it is conjectured that they are the only ones.

A sufficient condition for transitivity is that all points are nonwandering: &lt;math&gt; \Omega(f)=M &lt;/math&gt;.

Also, it is unknown if every &lt;math&gt;C^1&lt;/math&gt; volume-preserving Anosov diffeomorphism is ergodic. Anosov proved it under a &lt;math&gt;C^2&lt;/math&gt; assumption. It is also true for &lt;math&gt;C^{1+\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; volume-preserving Anosov diffeomorphisms.

For &lt;math&gt;C^2&lt;/math&gt; transitive Anosov diffeomorphism &lt;math&gt;f\colon M\to M &lt;/math&gt; there exists a unique SRB measure (the acronym stands for Sinai, Ruelle and Bowen) &lt;math&gt; \mu_f &lt;/math&gt; supported on &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; such that its basin &lt;math&gt; B(\mu_f)&lt;/math&gt; is of full volume, where 

:&lt;math&gt; B(\mu_f)= \left \{x\in M:\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\delta_{f^kx}\to\mu_f \right \}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Anosov flow on (tangent bundles of) Riemann surfaces==
As an example, this section develops the case of the Anosov flow on the [[tangent bundle]] of a [[Riemann surface]] of negative [[curvature]]. This flow can be understood in terms of the flow on the tangent bundle of the [[Poincaré half-plane model]] of hyperbolic geometry. Riemann surfaces of negative curvature may be defined as [[Fuchsian model]]s, that is, as the quotients of the [[upper half-plane]] and a [[Fuchsian group]]. For the following, let ''H'' be the upper half-plane; let Γ be a Fuchsian group; let ''M''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''H''/Γ be a Riemann surface of negative curvature as the quotient of "M" by the action of the group Γ, and let &lt;math&gt;T^1 M&lt;/math&gt; be the tangent bundle of unit-length vectors on the manifold ''M'', and let &lt;math&gt;T^1 H&lt;/math&gt; be the tangent bundle of unit-length vectors on ''H''. Note that a bundle of unit-length vectors on a surface is the [[principal bundle]] of  a complex [[line bundle]].

===Lie vector fields===
One starts by noting that &lt;math&gt;T^1 H&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to the [[Lie group]] [[PSL2(R)|PSL(2,'''R''')]]. This group is the group of orientation-preserving [[isometries]] of the upper half-plane. The [[Lie algebra]] of PSL(2,'''R''') is sl(2,'''R'''), and is represented by the matrices

:&lt;math&gt;J=\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 &amp;0\\ 0&amp;-1/2\\ \end{pmatrix} \qquad X=\begin{pmatrix}0&amp;1\\ 0&amp;0\\ \end{pmatrix} \qquad Y=\begin{pmatrix}0&amp;0\\ 1&amp;0  \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

which have the algebra

:&lt;math&gt;[J,X]=X \qquad [J,Y] = -Y \qquad [X,Y] = 2J&lt;/math&gt;

The [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]]s

:&lt;math&gt;g_t = \exp(tJ)= \begin{pmatrix}e^{t/2}&amp;0\\ 0&amp;e^{-t/2}\\ \end{pmatrix} \qquad h^*_t = \exp(tX)=\begin{pmatrix}1&amp;t\\ 0&amp;1\\ \end{pmatrix} \qquad h_t = \exp(tY)= \begin{pmatrix}1&amp;0\\ t&amp;1\\ \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

define right-invariant [[flow (mathematics)|flow]]s on the manifold of ''T''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''H''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;PSL(2,'''R'''), and likewise on ''T''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''M''. Defining ''P''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''T''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''H'' and ''Q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''T''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''M'', these flows define vector fields on ''P'' and ''Q'', whose vectors lie in ''TP'' and ''TQ''. These are just the standard, ordinary Lie vector fields on the manifold of a Lie group, and the presentation above is a standard exposition of a Lie vector field.

===Anosov flow===
The connection to the Anosov flow comes from the realization that &lt;math&gt;g_t&lt;/math&gt; is the [[geodesic flow]] on ''P'' and ''Q''. Lie vector fields being (by definition) left invariant under the action of a group element, one has that these fields are left invariant under the specific elements &lt;math&gt;g_t&lt;/math&gt; of the geodesic flow. In other words, the spaces ''TP'' and ''TQ'' are split into three one-dimensional spaces, or [[subbundle]]s, each of which are invariant under the geodesic flow.  The final step is to notice that vector fields in one subbundle expand (and expand exponentially), those in another are unchanged, and those in a third shrink (and do so exponentially).

More precisely, the tangent bundle ''TQ'' may be written as the [[direct sum of vector bundles|direct sum]] 

:&lt;math&gt;TQ = E^+ \oplus E^0 \oplus E^-&lt;/math&gt;

or, at a point &lt;math&gt;g \cdot e = q \in Q&lt;/math&gt;, the direct sum

:&lt;math&gt;T_qQ = E_q^+ \oplus E_q^0 \oplus E_q^-&lt;/math&gt;

corresponding to the Lie algebra generators ''Y'', ''J'' and ''X'', respectively, carried, by the left action of group element ''g'', from the origin ''e'' to the point ''q''. That is, one has &lt;math&gt;E_e^+=Y, E_e^0=J&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_e^-=X&lt;/math&gt;. These spaces are each [[subbundle]]s, and are preserved (are invariant) under the action of the  [[geodesic flow]]; that is, under the action of group elements &lt;math&gt;g=g_t&lt;/math&gt;.

To compare the lengths of vectors in &lt;math&gt;T_qQ&lt;/math&gt; at different points ''q'', one needs a metric. Any [[inner product]] at &lt;math&gt;T_eP=sl(2,\R)&lt;/math&gt; extends to a left-invariant [[Riemannian metric]] on ''P'', and thus to a Riemannian metric on ''Q''. The length of a vector &lt;math&gt;v \in E^+_q&lt;/math&gt; expands exponentially as exp(t) under the action of &lt;math&gt;g_t&lt;/math&gt;. The length of a vector &lt;math&gt;v \in E^-_q&lt;/math&gt; shrinks exponentially as exp(-t) under the action of &lt;math&gt;g_t&lt;/math&gt;. Vectors in &lt;math&gt;E^0_q&lt;/math&gt; are unchanged. This may be seen by examining how the group elements commute. The geodesic flow is invariant,

:&lt;math&gt;g_sg_t=g_tg_s=g_{s+t} &lt;/math&gt;

but the other two shrink and expand:

:&lt;math&gt;g_sh^*_t = h^*_{t\exp(-s)}g_s&lt;/math&gt;

and 

:&lt;math&gt;g_sh_t = h_{t\exp(s)}g_s &lt;/math&gt;

where we recall that a tangent vector in &lt;math&gt;E^+_q&lt;/math&gt; is given by the [[derivative]], with respect to ''t'', of the [[curve]] &lt;math&gt;h_t&lt;/math&gt;, the setting ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

===Geometric interpretation of the Anosov flow===
When acting on the point ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''i'' of the upper half-plane, &lt;math&gt;g_t&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to a [[geodesic]] on the upper half plane, passing through the point ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''i''. The action is the standard [[Möbius transformation]] action of [[SL2(R)|SL(2,'''R''')]] on the upper half-plane, so that 

:&lt;math&gt;g_t \cdot i = \begin{pmatrix} \exp(t/2) &amp; 0 \\  0 &amp; \exp(-t/2) \end{pmatrix} \cdot i = i\exp(t) &lt;/math&gt;

A general geodesic is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d \end{pmatrix} \cdot i\exp(t) = \frac{ai\exp(t)+b}{ci\exp(t)+d} &lt;/math&gt;

with ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and ''d'' real, with ''ad''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''bc''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.  The curves &lt;math&gt;h^*_t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h_t&lt;/math&gt; are called '''[[horocycle]]s'''. Horocycles correspond to the motion of the normal vectors of a [[horosphere]] on the upper half-plane.

The lowest result achieved equates to the overall [[fire-resistance rating]] of the [[system]] in order to ensure that the barrier works equally well from both sides.]]
'''Asymmetry''' is the absence of, or a violation of, [[symmetry]] (the property of an object being invariant to a transformation, such as reflection). Symmetry is an important property of both physical and abstract systems and it may be displayed in precise terms or in more aesthetic terms. The absence of or violation of symmetry that are either expected or desired can have important consequences for a system.

==In organisms==
Due to how [[cell (biology)|cell]]s divide in [[organism]]s, asymmetry in organisms is fairly usual in at least one dimension, with [[symmetry (biology)|biological symmetry]] also being common in at least one dimension.

Louis Pasteur proposed that biological molecules are asymmetric because the cosmic [i.e. physical] forces that preside over their formation are themselves asymmetric. While at his time, and even now, the symmetry of physical processes are highlighted, it is known that there are fundamental physical asymmetries, starting with time.

===Evolution of asymmetry in organisms===
Asymmetry is an important and widespread trait, having evolved numerous times in many organisms and at many levels of organisation (ranging from individual cells, through organs, to entire body-shapes). Benefits of asymmetry sometimes have to do with improved spatial arrangements, such as the left [[human]] [[lung]] being smaller, and having one fewer lobes than the right lung to make room for the asymmetrical [[heart]]. In other examples, division of function between the right and left half may have been beneficial and has driven the asymmetry to become stronger. Such an explanation is usually given for mammal hand or paw preference ([[Handedness]]), an asymmetry in skill development in mammals. Training the neural pathways in a skill with one hand (or paw) may take less effort than doing the same with both hands.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Nature also provides several examples of handedness in traits that are usually symmetric. The following are examples of animals with obvious left-right asymmetries:
[[Image:Fiddler Crab Gulf Coast.jpg|thumb|[[Fiddler crab]], ''Uca pugnax'']]
*Most [[snail]]s, because of [[Torsion (gastropod)|torsion]] during development, show remarkable asymmetry in the shell and in the internal organs.
*[[Fiddler crab]]s have one big claw and one small claw.
*The [[narwhal]]'s tusk is a left incisor which can grow up to 10 feet in length and forms a left-handed helix.
*[[Flatfish]] have evolved to swim with one side upward, and as a result have both eyes on one side of their heads.
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:halibut.jpg|thumb|left|150 px|Halibut, a type of flatfish]] --&gt;
*Several species of [[owl]]s exhibit asymmetries in the size and positioning of their ears, which is thought to help locate prey.
*Many animals (ranging from insects to mammals) have asymmetric male [[genitalia]]. The evolutionary cause behind this is, in most cases, still a mystery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schilthuizen|first1=Menno|title=Something gone awry: unsolved mysteries in the evolution of asymmetric animal genitalia|journal=Animal Biology|date=2013|volume=63|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1163/15707563-00002398|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/15707563-00002398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As an indicator of unfitness===

*Certain disturbances during the development of the organism, resulting in [[birth defect]]s.
*Injuries after cell division that cannot be biologically repaired, such as a lost [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]] from an accident.

Since birth defects and injuries are likely to indicate poor health of the organism, defects resulting in asymmetry often put an animal at a disadvantage when it comes to finding a mate. In particular, a degree of [[facial symmetry]] is associated with physical attractiveness, but complete symmetry is both impossible and probably unattractive.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==In structures==
Pre-modern architectural styles tended to place an emphasis on symmetry, except where extreme site conditions or historical developments lead away from this classical ideal. To the contrary, [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[Postmodernism#Architecture|postmodern architects]] became much more free to use asymmetry as a design element.

While most bridges employ a symmetrical form due to intrinsic simplicities of design, analysis and fabrication and economical use of materials, a number of modern bridges have deliberately departed from this, either in response to site-specific considerations or to create a dramatic design statement.

===In fire protection===
In [[Fire-resistance rating|fire-resistance rated wall assemblies]], used in [[passive fire protection]], including, but not limited to, [[high-voltage transformer fire barriers]], asymmetry is a crucial aspect of design. When designing a facility, it is not always certain, that in the event of [[fire]], which ''side'' a fire may come from. Therefore, many building codes and fire test standards outline, that a symmetrical assembly, need only be [[Fire test|tested]] from one side, because both sides are the same. However, as soon as an assembly is asymmetrical, both sides must be tested and the test report is required to state the results for each side. In practical use, the lowest result achieved is the one that turns up in [[certification listing]]s. Neither the test sponsor, nor the laboratory can go by an opinion or deduction as to which side was in more peril as a result of contemplated testing and then test only one side. Both must be tested in order to be compliant with test standards and [[building code]]s

==In mathematics==

There are no ''a'' and ''b'' such that ''a'' &lt; ''b'' and ''b'' &lt; ''a''.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Set Theory'', Third Edition, Revised and Expanded: Hrbacek, Jech.{{full|date=October 2014}}&lt;!--missing year, page, publisher, possibly ISBN--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This form of asymmetry is an [[Asymmetric relation|asymmetrical relation]].

==In chemistry==

Certain molecules are [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]]; that is, they cannot be superposed upon their mirror image. Chemically identical molecules with different chirality are called ''enantiomers''; this difference in orientation can lead to different properties in the way they react with biological systems.

{{Expand section|date=November 2007}}

==In physics==

Asymmetry arises in physics in a number of different realms.

===Thermodynamics===

The original non-statistical formulation of [[thermodynamics]] was [[Entropy (arrow of time)|asymmetrical in time]]: it claimed that the [[entropy]] in a closed system can only increase with time. This was derived from the Second Law (any of the two, [[Clausius]]' or [[Lord Kelvin]]'s statement can be used since they are equivalent) and using the [[Clausius' Theorem]] (see [[Kerson Huang {{ISBN|978-0471815181}}]]). The later theory of statistical mechanics, however, is symmetric in time. Although it states that a system significantly below maximum entropy is very likely to evolve ''towards'' higher entropy, it also states that such a system is very likely to have evolved ''from'' higher entropy.

===Particle physics===

[[Symmetry in physics|Symmetry]] is one of the most powerful tools in [[particle physics]], because it has become evident that practically all laws of nature originate in symmetries. Violations of symmetry therefore present theoretical and experimental puzzles that lead to a deeper understanding of nature. Asymmetries in experimental measurements also provide powerful handles that are often relatively free from background or systematic uncertainties.

====Parity violation====
{{Main|parity (physics)}}

Until the 1950s, it was believed that fundamental physics was left-right symmetric; i.e., that interactions were invariant under [[parity (physics)|parity]]. Although parity is conserved in [[electromagnetism]], [[strong interactions]] and [[gravity]], it turns out to be violated in [[weak interactions]]. The [[Standard Model]] incorporates parity violation by expressing the weak interaction as a [[chirality (physics)|chiral]] gauge interaction. Only the left-handed components of particles and right-handed components of antiparticles participate in weak interactions in the Standard Model. A consequence of parity violation in particle physics is that [[neutrinos]] have only been observed as left-handed particles (and antineutrinos as right-handed particles).

In 1956-1957 [[Chien-Shiung Wu]], E. Ambler, R. W. Hayward, D. D. Hoppes, and R. P. Hudson found a clear violation of parity conservation in the beta decay of cobalt-60.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Simultaneously, [[Richard Garwin|R. L. Garwin]], [[Leon Lederman]], and R. Weinrich modified an existing cyclotron experiment and immediately verified parity violation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

====CP violation====
{{Main|CP-violation}}

After the discovery of the violation of parity in 1956-57, it was believed that the combined symmetry of parity (P) and simultaneous [[charge conjugation]] (C), called ''CP'', was preserved. For example, CP transforms a left-handed neutrino into a right-handed antineutrino. In 1964, however, [[James Cronin]] and [[Val Fitch]] provided clear evidence that CP symmetry was also violated in an experiment with neutral [[kaons]].

CP violation is one of the necessary conditions for the generation of a baryon asymmetry in the universe.

Combining the CP symmetry with simultaneous [[T-symmetry|time reversal]] (T) produces a combined symmetry called [[CPT symmetry]]. CPT symmetry must be preserved in any [[Lorentz invariant]] local [[quantum field theory]] with a [[Self-adjoint operator|Hermitian]] [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]. As of 2006, no violations of CPT symmetry have been observed.

====Baryon asymmetry of the universe====
{{Main|baryogenesis}}

The [[baryons]] (i.e., the [[protons]] and [[neutrons]] and the atoms that they comprise) observed so far in the universe are overwhelmingly [[matter]] as opposed to [[anti-matter]]. This asymmetry is called the [[baryon asymmetry]] of the universe.

====Isospin violation====

[[Isospin]] is the symmetry transformation of the [[weak interactions]]. The concept was first introduced by [[Werner Heisenberg]] in [[nuclear physics]] based on the observations that the masses of the [[neutron]] and the [[proton]] are almost identical and that the strength of the [[strong interaction]] between any pair of nucleons is the same, independent of whether they are protons or neutrons. This symmetry arises at a more fundamental level as a symmetry between up-type and down-type [[quark]]s. Isospin symmetry in the strong interactions can be considered as a subset of a larger [[flavor symmetry]] group, in which the strong interactions are invariant under interchange of different types of quarks. Including the [[strange quark]] in this scheme gives rise to the [[Eightfold way (physics)|Eightfold Way]] scheme for classifying mesons and baryons.

Isospin is violated by the fact that the masses of the up and down quarks are different, as well as by their different electric charges. Because this violation is only a small effect in most processes that involve the strong interactions, isospin symmetry remains a useful calculational tool, and its violation introduces corrections to the isospin-symmetric results.

====In collider experiments====

Because the [[weak interaction]]s violate parity, [[collider]] processes that can involve the weak interactions typically exhibit asymmetries in the distributions of the final-state particles. These asymmetries are typically sensitive to the ''difference'' in the interaction between particles and antiparticles, or between left-handed and right-handed particles. They can thus be used as a sensitive measurement of differences in interaction strength and/or to distinguish a small asymmetric signal from a large but symmetric background.
*A '''forward-backward asymmetry''' is defined as A&lt;sub&gt;FB&lt;/sub&gt;=(N&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;)/(N&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;+N&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;), where N&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of events in which some particular final-state particle is moving "forward" with respect to some chosen direction (e.g., a final-state electron moving in the same direction as the initial-state electron beam in electron-positron collisions), while N&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of events with the final-state particle moving "backward". Forward-backward asymmetries were used by the [[LEP]] experiments to measure the difference in the interaction strength of the [[Z boson]] between left-handed and right-handed fermions, which provides a precision measurement of the [[weak mixing angle]].
*A '''left-right asymmetry''' is defined as A&lt;sub&gt;LR&lt;/sub&gt;=(N&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;)/(N&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;+N&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;), where N&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of events in which some initial- or final-state particle is left-polarized, while N&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is the corresponding number of right-polarized events. Left-right asymmetries in Z boson production and decay were measured at the [[Stanford Linear Collider]] using the event rates obtained with left-polarized versus right-polarized initial electron beams. Left-right asymmetries can also be defined as asymmetries in the polarization of final-state particles whose polarizations can be measured; e.g., [[tau lepton]]s.
*A '''charge asymmetry''' or particle-antiparticle asymmetry is defined in a similar way. This type of asymmetry has been used to constrain the [[parton (particle physics)|parton distribution functions]] of protons at the [[Tevatron]] from events in which a produced [[W boson]] decays to a charged lepton. The asymmetry between positively and negatively charged leptons as a function of the direction of the W boson relative to the proton beam provides information on the relative distributions of up and down quarks in the proton. Particle-antiparticle asymmetries are also used to extract measurements of CP violation from [[Meson|B meson]] and anti-B meson production at the [[BaBar experiment|BaBar]] and [[Belle experiment|Belle]] experiments.

==Lexical==
{{references|section|date=November 2015}}

Asymmetry is also relevant to [[grammar]] and [[linguistics]], especially in the contexts of [[lexical analysis]] and [[transformational grammar]].

'''Enumeration example:'''
In [[English language|English]], there are grammatical rules for specifying coordinate items in an enumeration or series. Similar rules exist for [[programming language]]s and [[mathematical notation]]. These rules vary, and some require lexical asymmetry to be considered grammatically correct.

For example, in standard written English:
    We sell domesticated cats, dogs, and goldfish.        ### in-line asymmetric and grammatical
    We sell domesticated animals (cats, dogs, goldfish).  ### in-line symmetric and grammatical
    We sell domesticated animals (cats, dogs, goldfish,). ### in-line symmetric and ungrammatical
    We sell domesticated animals:                         ### outline symmetric and grammatical
      - cats
      - dogs
      - goldfish

'''The Australian Association of Mathematics Teachers''' is the main representative organisation of [[Mathematics education|mathematics teachers]] in [[Australia]]. Membership is via affiliated state organisations. The AAMT conducts a number of activities including ''Reach for the stars'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mount Carmel School on Target with Literacy and Numeracy |url=http://www.yasstribune.com.au/news/local/news/general/mount-carmel-school-on-target-with-literacy-and-numeracy/1280331.aspx |work=Yass Tribune |accessdate=18 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722025256/http://www.yasstribune.com.au/news/local/news/general/mount-carmel-school-on-target-with-literacy-and-numeracy/1280331.aspx |archivedate=22 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  an activity for students, as well as submissions to government bodies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morony |first=Will |title=Submission to the Productivity  Commission Schools Workforce Study |url=http://www.pc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/111621/sub010.pdf |publisher=Australian Government Productivity Commission |accessdate=18 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140212205135/http://www.pc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/111621/sub010.pdf |archivedate=12 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and reports on issues relevant to mathematics teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/maths-now-a-zero-sum-game/story-e6frg6nf-1111116397919 | title=Shortage of specialist maths teachers | work=The Australian | date=May 21, 2008 | accessdate=November 17, 2013 | author=Trounson, Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/opinion/best-brains-wont-make-the-numbers/story-e6frgcm6-1111116394500 | title=Best brains won't make the numbers | work=The Australian | date=May 21, 2008 | accessdate=November 17, 2013 | author=Trounson, Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The AAMT is a federation of 8 affiliated associations of teachers of mathematics, one from each [[Australian State]] and Territory:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Contact your State/Territory association|url = http://aamt.edu.au/Membership/Affiliates|work = The Australian Association of Mathematics Teachers Inc.|accessdate = 4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The AAMT is governed by a council made up of a representatives from each of these associations, as well as an elected President, Treasurer, and either a President Elect or an Immediate Past President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Constitution and Regulations|url = http://aamt.edu.au/About-AAMT/Constitution|work = The Australian Association of Mathematics Teachers Inc.|accessdate = 4 February 2016|date = February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day-to-day affairs of the association are managed by an office staff based primarily in Adelaide, South Australia.

==Membership==
AAMT does not direct membership; members join their local affiliated association and are then automatically a member of AAMT. AAMT has approximately 4000 individual and institutional members.

==Standards==
The AAMT publish  ''Standards for Excellence in Teaching Mathematics in Australian Schools'' as a guide for the improvement and maintenance of teaching standards in mathematics in Australian schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aamt.edu.au/Publications-and-statements/Position-statements/Standards-document | title=Standards for Excellence in Teaching Mathematics in Australian Schools (2006 edition) | publisher=The Australian Association of Mathematics Teachers | accessdate=November 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journals==
The AAMT publishes three journals:
* Australian Primary Mathematics Classroom (APMC) - primary school mathematics education.
* The Australian Mathematics Teacher (AMT) - secondary school mathematics up to age 16
* Australian Senior Mathematics Journal (ASMJ) - senior secondary (Years 11 and 12) and early tertiary mathematics.

In [[mathematics]], especially in [[order theory]], the '''cofinality''' cf(''A'') of a [[partially ordered set]] ''A'' is the least of the [[cardinality|cardinalities]] of the [[cofinal (mathematics)|cofinal]] subsets of ''A''.

This definition of cofinality relies on the [[axiom of choice]], as it uses the fact that every non-empty set of [[cardinal number]]s has a least member. The cofinality of a partially ordered set ''A'' can alternatively be defined as the least [[ordinal number|ordinal]] ''x'' such that there is a function from ''x'' to ''A'' with cofinal [[Image (mathematics)|image]]. This second definition makes sense without the axiom of choice. If the axiom of choice is assumed, as will be the case in the rest of this article, then the two definitions are equivalent.

Cofinality can be similarly defined for a [[directed set]] and is used to generalize the notion of a [[subsequence]] in a [[Net (mathematics)|net]].

== Examples ==
*  The cofinality of a partially ordered set with [[greatest element]] is 1 as the set consisting only of the greatest element is cofinal (and must be contained in every other cofinal subset).
** In particular, the cofinality of any nonzero finite ordinal, or indeed any finite directed set, is 1, since such sets have a greatest element.
* Every cofinal subset of a partially ordered set must contain all [[maximal element]]s of that set. Thus the cofinality of a finite partially ordered set is equal to the number of its maximal elements.
** In particular, let ''A'' be a set of size ''n'', and consider the set of subsets of ''A'' containing no more than ''m'' elements.  This is partially ordered under inclusion and the subsets with ''m'' elements are maximal.  Thus the cofinality of this poset is ''n'' [[Binomial coefficient|choose]] ''m''.
* A subset of the natural numbers '''N''' is cofinal in '''N''' if and only if it is infinite, and therefore the cofinality of &amp;alefsym;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is &amp;alefsym;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus &amp;alefsym;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[regular cardinal]].
* The cofinality of the [[real number]]s with their usual ordering is &amp;alefsym;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, since '''N''' is cofinal in '''R'''.  The usual ordering of '''R''' is not [[order isomorphic]] to ''c'', the [[cardinality of the continuum|cardinality of the real numbers]], which has cofinality strictly greater than &amp;alefsym;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  This demonstrates that the cofinality depends on the order; different orders on the same set may have different cofinality.

==Properties==
If ''A'' admits a [[total order|totally ordered]] cofinal subset, then we can find a subset ''B'' which is well-ordered and cofinal in ''A''. Any subset of ''B'' is also well-ordered. If two cofinal subsets of ''B'' have minimal cardinality (i.e. their cardinality is the cofinality of ''B''), then they are order isomorphic to each other.

== Cofinality of ordinals and other well-ordered sets ==
The '''cofinality of an ordinal''' &amp;alpha; is the smallest ordinal &amp;delta; which is the [[order type]] of a [[cofinal subset]] of &amp;alpha;.  The cofinality of a set of ordinals or any other [[well-ordered set]] is the cofinality of the order type of that set.

Thus for a [[limit ordinal]] &amp;alpha;, there exists a &amp;delta;-indexed strictly increasing sequence with limit &amp;alpha;.  For example, the cofinality of ω² is ω, because the sequence ω·''m'' (where ''m'' ranges over the natural numbers) tends to ω²; but, more generally, any countable limit ordinal has cofinality ω.  An uncountable limit ordinal may have either cofinality ω as does &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sub&gt; or an uncountable cofinality.

The cofinality of 0 is 0. The cofinality of any [[successor ordinal]] is 1.  The cofinality of any nonzero limit ordinal is an infinite regular cardinal.

== Regular and singular ordinals ==
{{Main|Regular cardinal}}
A '''regular ordinal''' is an ordinal which is equal to its cofinality. A '''singular ordinal''' is any ordinal which is not regular.

Every regular ordinal is the [[initial ordinal]] of a cardinal.  Any limit of regular ordinals is a limit of initial ordinals and thus is also initial but need not be regular. Assuming the axiom of choice, &lt;math&gt;\omega_{\alpha+1}&lt;/math&gt; is regular for each α.  In this case, the ordinals 0, 1, &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\omega_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\omega_2&lt;/math&gt; are regular, whereas 2, 3, &lt;math&gt;\omega_\omega&lt;/math&gt;, and ω&lt;sub&gt;ω·2&lt;/sub&gt; are initial ordinals which are not regular.

The cofinality of any ordinal ''α'' is a regular ordinal, i.e. the cofinality of the cofinality of ''α'' is the same as the cofinality of ''α''.  So the cofinality operation is [[idempotent]].

==Cofinality of cardinals==
If κ is an infinite cardinal number, then cf(κ) is the least cardinal such that there is an [[bounded (set theory)|unbounded]] function from cf(κ) to κ; cf(κ) is also the cardinality of the smallest set of strictly smaller cardinals whose sum is κ; more precisely

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{cf}(\kappa) = \min \left\{ \mathrm{card}(I)\ |\ \kappa = \sum_{i \in I} \lambda_i\ \mathrm{and}\ (\forall i)(\lambda_i &lt; \kappa)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

That the set above is nonempty comes from the fact that

:&lt;math&gt;\kappa = \bigcup_{i \in \kappa} \{i\}&lt;/math&gt;

i.e. the [[disjoint union]] of κ singleton sets. This implies immediately that cf(κ) ≤ κ.
The cofinality of any totally ordered set is regular, so one has cf(κ) = cf(cf(κ)).

Using [[König's theorem (set theory)|König's theorem]], one can prove κ &lt; κ&lt;sup&gt;cf(κ)&lt;/sup&gt; and κ &lt; cf(2&lt;sup&gt;κ&lt;/sup&gt;) for any infinite cardinal κ.

The last inequality implies that the cofinality of the cardinality of the continuum must be uncountable. On the other hand,

:&lt;math&gt; \aleph_\omega = \bigcup_{n &lt; \omega} \aleph_n &lt;/math&gt;.

the ordinal number ω being the first infinite ordinal, so that the cofinality of &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\omega&lt;/math&gt; is card(ω) = &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;.  (In particular, &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\omega&lt;/math&gt; is singular.) Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}\neq\aleph_\omega.&lt;/math&gt;

(Compare to the [[continuum hypothesis]], which states &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}= \aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;.)

Generalizing this argument, one can prove that for a limit ordinal δ

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{cf} (\aleph_\delta) = \mathrm{cf} (\delta) &lt;/math&gt;.

In mathematics, the '''corners theorem''' is a result, proved by [[Miklós Ajtai]] and [[Endre Szemerédi]], of a statement in [[arithmetic combinatorics]]. It states that for every ''&amp;epsilon;''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 there exists ''N'' such that given at least ''&amp;epsilon;N&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' points in the ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''N'' grid {1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''N''}&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;{1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''N''}, there exists a corner, i.e., three points in the form (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y''), (''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''h'',&amp;nbsp;''y''), and (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''h''). Later, {{harvtxt|Solymosi|2003}} gave a simpler proof, based on the [[triangle removal lemma]]. The corners theorem implies [[Szemerédi's theorem|Roth's theorem]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7239">In [[graph theory]], an ''n''-dimensional '''De Bruijn graph''' of ''m'' symbols is a [[directed graph]] representing overlaps between sequences of symbols. It has ''m''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]], consisting of all possible length-''n'' sequences of the given symbols; the same symbol may appear multiple times in a sequence. If we have the set of ''m'' symbols &lt;math&gt;S:=\{s_1,\dots,s_m\}&lt;/math&gt; then the set of vertices is:

: &lt;math&gt;V=S^n=\{(s_1,\dots,s_1,s_1),(s_1,\dots,s_1,s_2),\dots,(s_1,\dots,s_1,s_m),(s_1,\dots,s_2,s_1),\dots,(s_m,\dots,s_m,s_m)\}.&lt;/math&gt;

If one of the vertices can be expressed as another vertex by shifting all its symbols by one place to the left and adding a new symbol at the end of this vertex, then the latter has a directed edge to the former vertex. Thus the set of arcs (aka directed edges) is

: &lt;math&gt;E=\{((v_1,v_2,\dots,v_n),(v_2,\dots,v_n,s_i)) : i=1,\dots,m \}.&lt;/math&gt;

Although De Bruijn graphs are named after [[Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn]], they were discovered independently by both De Bruijn&lt;ref name="Bruijn1946"/&gt; and [[I. J. Good]].&lt;ref name="Good1946"/&gt; Much earlier, Camille Flye Sainte-Marie&lt;ref name="Flye1894"/&gt; implicitly used their properties.

== Properties ==
* If &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt; then the condition for any two vertices forming an edge holds vacuously, and hence all the vertices are connected forming a total of &lt;math&gt;m^2&lt;/math&gt; edges.
* Each vertex has exactly &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; incoming and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; outgoing edges.
* Each &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional De Bruijn graph is the [[line graph|line digraph]] of the &lt;math&gt;(n - 1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional De Bruijn graph with the same set of symbols.&lt;ref name="Zhang1987"/&gt;
* Each De Bruijn graph is [[Euler cycle|Eulerian]] and [[Hamiltonian graph|Hamiltonian]]. The Euler cycles and Hamiltonian cycles of these graphs (equivalent to each other via the line graph construction) are [[De Bruijn sequence]]s.

The [[line graph]] construction of the three smallest binary De Bruijn graphs is depicted below. As can be seen in the illustration, each vertex of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional De Bruijn graph corresponds to an edge of the &lt;math&gt;(n - 1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional De Bruijn graph, and each edge in the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional De Bruijn graph corresponds to a two-edge path in the &lt;math&gt;(n - 1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional De Bruijn graph.
[[Image:DeBruijn-as-line-digraph.svg|center|600px]]

== Dynamical systems ==
Binary De Bruijn graphs can be drawn (below, left) in such a way that they resemble objects from the theory of [[dynamical system]]s, such as the [[Lorenz attractor]] (below, right):
:::[[Image:DeBruijn-3-2.svg|360px]] &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; [[Image:Lorenz attractor yb.svg|200px]]
This analogy can be made rigorous: the ''n''-dimensional ''m''-symbol De Bruijn graph is a model of the [[Bernoulli map]]

:&lt;math&gt;x\mapsto mx\ \bmod\ 1&lt;/math&gt;

The Bernoulli map (also called the [[2x mod 1 map]] for ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2) is an [[ergodic]] dynamical system, which can be understood to be a single [[shift operator|shift]] of a [[p-adic|m-adic number]].&lt;ref name="Leroux2002"/&gt; The trajectories of this dynamical system correspond to walks in the De Bruijn graph, where the correspondence is given by mapping each real ''x'' in the interval [0,1) to the vertex corresponding to the first ''n'' digits in the [[Radix|base]]-''m'' representation of ''x''. Equivalently, walks in the De Bruijn graph correspond to trajectories in a one-sided [[subshift of finite type]].

{{Graph families defined by their automorphisms}}
In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[graph theory]], an  '''edge-transitive graph''' is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] ''G'' such that, given any two edges ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of ''G'', there is an 
[[Graph automorphism|automorphism]] of ''G'' that maps ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="biggs"&gt;{{cite book | author=Biggs, Norman | title=Algebraic Graph Theory | edition=2nd | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1993 | page=118 | isbn=0-521-45897-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, a graph is edge-transitive if its [[automorphism group]] acts [[group action|transitively]] upon its edges.

==Examples and properties==
[[Image:Gray graph 2COL.svg|thumb|200px|The [[Gray graph]] is edge-transitive and [[regular graph|regular]], but not [[vertex-transitive graph|vertex-transitive]].]]

Edge-transitive graphs include any [[complete bipartite graph]] &lt;math&gt;K_{m,n}&lt;/math&gt;, and any [[symmetric graph]], such as the vertices and edges of the [[cube]].&lt;ref name="biggs" /&gt;  Symmetric graphs are also [[vertex-transitive graph|vertex-transitive]] (if they are connected), but in general edge-transitive graphs need not be vertex-transitive.  The [[Gray graph]] is an example of a graph which is edge-transitive but not vertex-transitive.  All such graphs are [[bipartite graph|bipartite]],&lt;ref name="biggs" /&gt; and hence can be [[Graph coloring|colored]] with only two colors.

An edge-transitive graph that is also [[regular graph|regular]], but not vertex-transitive, is called [[semi-symmetric graph|semi-symmetric]].  The [[Gray graph]] again provides an example.
Every edge-transitive graph that is not vertex-transitive must be [[bipartite graph|bipartite]] and either semi-symmetric or [[biregular graph|biregular]].&lt;ref name="ls03"&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6809">In [[mathematics]], an '''elementary matrix''' is a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] which differs from the [[identity matrix]] by one single elementary row operation. The elementary matrices generate the [[general linear group]] of [[invertible matrix|invertible matrices]].  Left multiplication (pre-multiplication) by an elementary matrix represents '''elementary row operations''', while right multiplication (post-multiplication) represents '''elementary column operations'''.

Elementary row operations are used in [[Gaussian elimination]] to reduce a matrix to [[row echelon form]].  They are also used in [[Gauss-Jordan elimination]] to further reduce the matrix to [[reduced row echelon form]].

==Elementary row operations==
There are three types of elementary matrices, which correspond to three types of row operations (respectively, column operations):

;Row switching: A row within the matrix can be switched with another row.
: &lt;math&gt;R_i \leftrightarrow R_j&lt;/math&gt;

;Row multiplication: Each element in a row can be multiplied by a non-zero constant.
: &lt;math&gt;kR_i \rightarrow R_i,\ \mbox{where } k \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;

;Row addition: A row can be replaced by the sum of that row and a multiple of another row.
: &lt;math&gt;R_i + kR_j \rightarrow R_i, \mbox{where } i \neq j &lt;/math&gt;

If ''E'' is an elementary matrix, as described below, to apply the elementary row operation to a matrix ''A'', one multiplies ''A'' by the elementary matrix on the left, ''EA''. The elementary matrix for any row operation is obtained by executing the operation on the [[identity matrix]].

===Row-switching transformations===
The first type of row operation on a matrix ''A'' switches all matrix elements on row ''i'' with their counterparts on row ''j''. The corresponding elementary matrix is obtained by swapping row ''i'' and row ''j'' of the [[identity matrix]]. 

:&lt;math&gt;T_{i,j} = \begin{bmatrix}
  1 &amp;        &amp;   &amp;        &amp;   &amp;        &amp;   \\
    &amp; \ddots &amp;   &amp;        &amp;   &amp;        &amp;   \\
    &amp;        &amp; 0 &amp;        &amp; 1 &amp;        &amp;   \\
    &amp;        &amp;   &amp; \ddots &amp;   &amp;        &amp;   \\
    &amp;        &amp; 1 &amp;        &amp; 0 &amp;        &amp;   \\
    &amp;        &amp;   &amp;        &amp;   &amp; \ddots &amp;   \\
    &amp;        &amp;   &amp;        &amp;   &amp;        &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

So ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;''A'' is the matrix produced by exchanging row ''i'' and row ''j'' of ''A''.

====Properties====
* The inverse of this matrix is itself: ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;.
* Since the [[determinant]] of the identity matrix is unity, det[''T''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;] = −1.  It follows that for any square matrix ''A'' (of the correct size), we have det[''T''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;''A''] = −det[''A''].

===Row-multiplying transformations===
The next type of row operation on a matrix ''A'' multiplies all elements on row ''i'' by ''m'' where ''m'' is a non-zero [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] (usually a real number). The corresponding elementary matrix is a diagonal matrix, with diagonal entries 1 everywhere except in the ''i''th position, where it is ''m''.

:&lt;math&gt;D_i(m) = \begin{bmatrix}
  1 &amp;        &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;        &amp;   \\
    &amp; \ddots &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;        &amp;   \\
    &amp;        &amp; 1 &amp;   &amp;   &amp;        &amp;   \\
    &amp;        &amp;   &amp; m &amp;   &amp;        &amp;   \\
    &amp;        &amp;   &amp;   &amp; 1 &amp;        &amp;   \\
    &amp;        &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; \ddots &amp;   \\
    &amp;        &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;        &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

So ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''m'')''A'' is the matrix produced from ''A'' by multiplying row ''i'' by ''m''.

====Properties====
* The inverse of this matrix is: ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''m'')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(1/''m'').
* The matrix and its inverse are [[diagonal matrix|diagonal matrices]].
* det[''D''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''m'')] = ''m''. Therefore for a square matrix ''A'' (of the correct size), we have det[''D''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''m'')''A''] = ''m'' det[''A''].

===Row-addition transformations===
The final type of row operation on a matrix ''A'' adds row ''i'' multiplied by a scalar ''m'' to row ''j''. The corresponding elementary matrix is the identity matrix but with an ''m'' in the (''j'', ''i'') position.
:&lt;math&gt;L_{ij}(m) = \begin{bmatrix}
  1 &amp;        &amp;   &amp;        &amp;   &amp;        &amp;   \\
    &amp; \ddots &amp;   &amp;        &amp;   &amp;        &amp;   \\
    &amp;        &amp; 1 &amp;        &amp;   &amp;        &amp;   \\
    &amp;        &amp;   &amp; \ddots &amp;   &amp;        &amp;   \\
    &amp;        &amp; m &amp;        &amp; 1 &amp;        &amp;   \\
    &amp;        &amp;   &amp;        &amp;   &amp; \ddots &amp;   \\
    &amp;        &amp;   &amp;        &amp;   &amp;        &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

So ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;(''m'')''A'' is the matrix produced from ''A'' by adding ''m'' times row ''i'' to row ''j''. 

====Properties====
* These transformations are a kind of [[shear mapping]], also known as a ''transvections''.
* ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;(''m'')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;(−''m'') (inverse matrix).
* The matrix and its inverse are [[triangular matrix|triangular matrices]].
* det[''L''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;(''m'')] = 1. Therefore, for a square matrix ''A'' (of the correct size) we have det[''L''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;(''m'')''A''] = det[''A''].
* Row-addition transforms satisfy the [[Steinberg relations]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3148">'''Entropic security''' is a security definition used in the field of [[cryptography]].  Modern [[encryption]] schemes are generally required to protect communications even when the attacker has substantial information about the messages being encrypted.  For example, even if an attacker knows that an intercepted [[ciphertext]] encrypts either the message "Attack" or the message "Retreat", a [[semantically secure]] encryption scheme will prevent the attacker from learning which of the two messages is encrypted.  However, definitions such as [[semantic security]] are too strong to achieve with certain specialized encryption schemes.  Entropic security is a weaker definition that can be used in the special case where an attacker has very little information about the messages being encrypted.

It is well known that certain types of encryption algorithm cannot satisfy definitions such as [[semantic security]]: for example, [[deterministic encryption]] algorithms can never be semantically secure.  Entropic security definitions relax these definitions to cases where the message space has substantial entropy (from an [[Adversary (cryptography)|adversary's]] point of view).  Under this definition it is possible to prove security of deterministic encryption.

Note that in practice entropically-secure encryption algorithms are only "secure" provided that the message distribution possesses high entropy from any reasonable adversary's perspective.  This is an unrealistic assumption for a general encryption scheme, since one cannot assume that all likely users will encrypt high-entropy messages.  For these schemes, stronger definitions (such as semantic security or [[IND-CCA2|indistinguishability under adaptive chosen ciphertext attack]]) are appropriate.  However, there are special cases in which it is reasonable to require high entropy messages.  For example, encryption schemes that encrypt only secret key material (e.g., [[key encapsulation]] or [[Key Wrap]] schemes) can be considered under an entropic security definition.  A practical application of this result is the use of [[deterministic encryption]] algorithms for secure encryption of secret key material.

Russell and Wang formalized a definition of ''entropic security'' for encryption.  Their definition resembles the [[semantic security]] definition when message spaces have highly-entropic distribution.  In one formalization, the definition implies that an adversary given the ciphetext will be unable to compute any predicate on the ciphertext with (substantially) greater probability than an adversary who does not possess the ciphertext.  Dodis and Smith later proposed alternate definitions and showed equivalence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32038">'''Escalation of commitment''' is a human behavior pattern in which an individual or group facing increasingly negative outcomes from some [[Decision-making|decision]], action, or investment nevertheless continues the same behavior rather than alter course. The actor maintains behaviors that are irrational, but align with previous decisions and actions.&lt;ref name="Staw1997"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Staw|first1=Barry M.|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=C7KbGmTg3qUC|page=191}} |chapter=The escalation of commitment: An update and appraisal|editor1-last=Shapira|editor1-first=Zur|title=Organizational Decision Making|date=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York, NY|pages=191–215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists and [[behavioral scientists]] use a related term, ''sunk-cost fallacy'', to describe the justification of increased [[investment]] of money, time, lives, etc. in a decision, based on the cumulative prior investment ("[[sunk cost]]") despite new evidence suggesting that the cost, beginning immediately, of continuing the decision outweighs the expected benefit.

In [[sociology]], ''irrational escalation of commitment'' or ''commitment bias'' describe similar behaviours. The phenomenon and the sentiment underlying it are reflected in such proverbial images as "throwing good money after bad", "in for a penny, in for a pound", and "if at first you don't succeed, try, try again".

== Early use ==
Escalation of commitment was first described by Barry M. Staw in his 1976 paper, "Knee deep in the big muddy: A study of escalating commitment to a chosen course of action".&lt;ref name=Staw1976&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Staw|first1=Barry M.|title=Knee-deep in the big muddy: a study of escalating commitment to a chosen course of action|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Performance|date=1976|volume=16|issue=1|pages=27–44|doi=10.1016/0030-5073(76)90005-2|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.470.3668&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers, inspired by the work of Staw, conducted studies that tested factors, situations and causes of escalation of commitment. The research introduced other analyses of situations and how people approach problems and make decisions. Some of the earliest work stemmed from events in which this phenomenon had an effect and help explain the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

=== Researchers define escalation of commitment ===

Over the past few decades, researchers have followed and analyzed many examples of the escalation of commitment to a situation. The heightened situations are explained in three elements. Firstly, a situation has a costly amount of resources such as time, money and people invested in the project. Next, past behavior leads up to an apex in time where the project has not met expectations or could be in a cautious state of decline. Lastly, these problems all force a decision-maker to make choices that include the options of continuing to pursue a project until completion by adding additional costs, or canceling the project altogether.&lt;ref name="Moon2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moon|first1=Henry|title=The two faces of conscientiousness: Duty and achievement striving in escalation of commitment dilemmas|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=2001|volume=86|issue=3|pages=533–540|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.86.3.535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have also developed an argument regarding how  escalation of commitment is observed in two different categories.&lt;ref name="Brockner1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brockner|first1=Joel|title=The escalation of commitment to a failing course of action: toward theoretical progress|journal=Academy of Management Review|date=1992|volume=17|issue=1|pages=39–61|doi=10.5465/AMR.1992.4279568|url=http://www.gwern.net/docs/sunkcosts/1992-brockner.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311233821/http://www.gwern.net/docs/sunkcosts/1992-brockner.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many researchers believe that the need to escalate resources is linked to [[expectancy theory]]. "According to such a viewpoint, decision makers assess the probability that additional resource allocations will lead to goal attainment, as well as the value of goal attainment (i.e., rewards minus costs), and thereby generate a subjective expected utility associated with the decision to allocate additional resources."&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt; The next phase of the escalation process is self-justification and rationalizing if the decision the leader made used resources well, if the resources being used were used to make positive change, and assuring themselves that the decision they chose was right. Leaders must balance costs and benefits of any problem to produce a final decision. What matters most often in assuring the leader that they made the right choice regardless of the final outcome is if their decision is what others believed in.&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt;

Research conducted on the topic has been taken from many other forms and theories of psychology. Many believe that what researchers have done thus far to explain this behavior is best analyzed  and tested through situational development and resource allocation.&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt;

Other research has identified circumstances that lead to the opposite of escalation of commitment, namely deescalation of commitment. This research explains the factors that influence whether escalation or deescalation of commitment is more likely to occur through the role of budgeting and mental accounting.&lt;ref&gt;Heath, Chip. "Escalation and de-escalation of commitment in response to sunk costs: The role of budgeting in mental accounting." ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes'' 62 (1995): 38-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vietnam War ===

Escalation of commitment can many times cause behavior change by means of locking into resources. One of the first examples of escalation of commitment was described by [[George Ball (diplomat)|George Ball]], who wrote to President [[Lyndon Johnson]] to explain to him the predictions of the war outcome:&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

{{quote|The decision you face now is crucial. Once large numbers of U.S. troops are committed to direct combat, they will begin to take heavy casualties in a war they are ill equipped to fight in a noncooperative if not downright hostile countryside. Once we suffer large casualties, we will have started a well-nigh irreversible process. Our involvement will be so great that we cannot—without national humiliation—stop short of achieving our complete objectives. Of the two possibilities, I think humiliation would be more likely than the achievement of our objectives—even after we have paid terrible costs.&lt;ref name="Gettleman1995"&gt;Ball, George (July 1, 1965). "Memo from George Ball to President Johnson. A Compromise Solution in South Vietnam". In {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SVtNalqmYgAC&amp;pg=PA283|last=Gettleman|first=Marvin E.|title=Vietnam and America: A Documented History|year=1995|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=978-0-8021-3362-5|pages=282–283}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Theories ==
=== Self-justification theory ===

[[Self-justification theory|Self-justification]] thought process is a part of commitment decisions of leaders and managers of a group and can therefore cause a rise in commitment levels.&lt;ref name="Huning2014"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Impact of Performance Attributions on Escalation of Commitment|last = Huning|first = Tobias M|date = 2014|volume = 18|issue = 1|journal = Journal of Organizational Culture, Communications and Conflict|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Thomson|first2 = Neal F|url = http://www.alliedacademies.org/articles/jocccvol17no22013.pdf|deadurl = bot: unknown|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160623232138/http://www.alliedacademies.org/articles/jocccvol17no22013.pdf#page=157|archivedate = 2016-06-23|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude provides "one explanation for why people escalate commitment to their past investments."&lt;ref name="Kelly2013"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title = Escalation of Commitment|last = Kelly|first = Theresa F|publisher = Sage Publications, Inc|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Thousand Oaks, CA|pages =256–259 |encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of Management Theory|last2 = Milkman|first2 = Katherine L|editor1-last=Kessler|editor1-first= Eric H|doi=10.4135/9781452276090.n78|ISBN= 9781412997829|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=4wtzAwAAQBAJ|page=256}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Managers make decisions that reflect previous behavior. Managers tend to recall and follow information that is aligned to their behavior to create consistency for their current and future decisions. If a group member or outside party recognizes inconsistent decision making, this can alter the leadership role of the manager. Managers have external influence from society, peers, and authority, which can significantly alter a manager's perception on what factors realistically matter when making decisions.&lt;ref name="Huning2014" /&gt;

=== Prospect theory ===

[[Prospect theory]] helps to describe the natural reactions and processes involved in making a decision in a risk-taking situation. Prospect theory makes the argument for how levels of wealth, whether that is people, money, or time, affect how a decision is made. Researchers were particularly interested in how one perceives a situation based on costs and benefits.&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt; The framing to how the problem is introduced is crucial for understanding and thinking of the probability that the situation will either work in favor or against you and how to prepare for those changes. "Whyte (1986) argued that prospect theory provides the psychological mechanism by which to explain escalating commitment to a failing course of action without the need to invoke self-justification processes. (Fiegenbaum &amp; Thomas, 1988: 99)"&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt; Prospect theorists believe that one's use of this process is when there is a negative downfall in the stakes that will affect the outcome of the project. To ensure they will not fail, the individual may add more resources to assure them that they will succeed. Although this theory seems realistic, researchers "Davis and Bobko (1986) found no effect of personal responsibility on continued commitment to the previous course of action in the positive frame condition."&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt; Which means that escalation of commitment will be lower in the higher responsibility situation.

=== Attribution theory ===

The [[attribution theory]], originating from [[Fritz Heider]], "attempts to find causal explanations for events and human behaviors." This theory approaches two methods of inquiry including locus of causality and stability.&lt;ref name="Huning2014" /&gt; Locus of causality reflects on internal characteristics of an individual, such as intelligence levels and attention seeking, with the relationship of the external space such as weather forecasts and task difficulty.&lt;ref name="Huning2014" /&gt; Aspects of control become a significant factor in how a manager justifies a decision made. Managers will use the relationship between internal and external factors to describe why they made a decision to a single point of view. Managers may justify their actions by explaining that this was out of their personal control of the event, or they could believe that the decision could not be controlled by anyone else. Research suggests that "the type of attribution made by an employee across these dimensions is likely to impact an employee's tendency to engage in the negative emotional activity referred to as escalation of commitment."&lt;ref name="Huning2014" /&gt;

=== Social identity theory ===

Identity is a large part of how we move through the world. Private thoughts and opinions as well as the effect of others create the [[social identity theory]]. People make connections between their use of groups and their own view of themselves, which researchers have discovered motivates people to keep their social status and to defend it whenever it is endangered.&lt;ref name="Dietz-Uhler1996"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The escalation of commitment in political decision-making groups: a social identity approach|last = Dietz-Uhler|first = Beth|journal = European Journal of Social Psychology|date=1996|volume=26|issue=4|pages=611–629|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-0992(199607)26:4&lt;611::AID-EJSP781&gt;3.0.CO;2-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theoretical models ===

==== Temporal model of escalation ====
Groups engage in temporal comparisons, which means that you compare actions and behaviors at "different points in time."&lt;ref name="Dietz-Uhler1996" /&gt; This is a form of social identity scenario. This type of comparison can be made when a decision seems unproductive and forces team members to consider any threat to the group.&lt;ref name="Dietz-Uhler1996" /&gt;

==== Aggregate model ====
"The aggregate model's emphasis is upon the accumulation and balance of forces rather than the ordering of effects over time."&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt; The model is general and can provide an ideal view as to how. The effects whether positive or negative are defined by micro and macro forces. This model goes by situation rather than what researchers have defined as the norm. There is no process to follow, which makes it very useful for researchers because they can understand a situation more clearly as well as see the bigger picture of the situation.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

== Determinants ==
The main drivers of the tendency to continue investing in losing propositions are project, psychological, social, and structural.&lt;ref name="Sleesman2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sleesman|first1=Dustin J.|last2=Conlon|first2=Donald E.|last3=McNamara|first3=Gerry|last4=Miles|first4=Jonathan E.|title=Cleaning Up the Big Muddy: A Meta-Analytic Review of the Determinants of Escalation of Commitment|journal=Academy of Management Journal|date=2012|volume=55|issue=3|pages=541–562|doi=10.5465/amj.2010.0696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Project ===

Project determinants are those that refer to the original commitments and decisions made at a project's beginning. This includes general project characteristics and initial financial costs.&lt;ref name="Liang2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liang|first1=Beichen|last2=Kale|first2=Sudhir H.|last3=Cherian|first3=Joseph|title=Is the future static or dynamic? The role of culture on escalation of commitment in new product development|journal=Industrial Marketing Management|date=2014|volume=43|issue=1|pages=155–163|doi=10.1016/j.indmarman.2013.08.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them, decision risk, opportunity cost information, and information acquisition have been found to have negative relationships with escalation of commitment. Decision uncertainty, positive performance trend information, and expressed preference for initial decision have been found to have positive relationships.&lt;ref name="Sleesman2012"/&gt;

High costs of ending a project or changing its course, potential financial gain upon completion, and extensive structure can factor in to escalation of commitment, making it difficult to walk away from the project. Preventing future monetary loss, potential savings, and having clearly available alternatives can allow for avoidance of the behavior. In studies by Teger and later Ross and Staw, situations where ending an action costs more than completing it resulted in decision makers being trapped in their current, costly behaviors.&lt;ref name="Staw1997"/&gt;

=== Psychological ===

Psychological determinants are those that refer to internal views on the actions and information involved in a project. This can include cognitive factors, personality, and emotions as they relate to project elements.&lt;ref name="Liang2014" /&gt; Of these, sunk costs, time investment, decision maker experience and expertise, self-efficacy and confidence, personal responsibility for the initial decision, ego threat, and proximity to project completion have been found to have positive relationships with escalation of commitment, while anticipated regret and positive information framing have been found to have negative relationships.&lt;ref name="Sleesman2012"/&gt;

Optimism and belief that one has control over what will still be positive outcomes lead to continued self-justification of commitment to actions. People add to their initial personal investments in the hope they will overcome currently negative results. This was illustrated in a case study by Staw, where providing business students with manipulated responsibilities for initial decisions and their outcomes resulted in the greatest commitment to increased actions and resources when the initial decision assigned was made directly by the student with poor outcomes.&lt;ref name="Staw1997"/&gt; In these instances, people take further risk in an attempt to avoid further problems. This is even more likely when subjects view current issues as having unstable reasoning rather than stable reasoning, or when the individual is unwilling to admit mistakes.&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt; They then believe the situation will stabilize or turn around. [[Confirmation bias]] can also lead to escalation of commitment as individuals are then less likely to recognize the negative results of their decisions.&lt;ref name="Kelly2013" /&gt; On the other hand, if the results are recognized, they can be blamed on unforeseeable events occurring during the course of the project.

The effect of sunk costs is often seen escalating commitment. When the amount of investment is greater and can not be recovered, the desire to avoid complete loss of those resources and keeping with impression management prompts continued investment over pulling out.&lt;ref name="Kelly2013" /&gt; Relatedly, as invested resources can include time, closeness to completion of a project yields similar results. More value is placed on project when they are early or late in their process due to the clarity of completion goals at those points.&lt;ref name=Horn2012&gt;{{cite thesis|first1=Marianna|last1=Horn|title=The downside of persistence: The effects of mood on an escalation of commitment paradigm|date=2012|url=https://etd.auburn.edu/handle/10415/3290?show=full|HDL=10415/3290}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's more likely that risks will be taken at these points than in a project closer to a visible midpoint.

=== Social ===

Social determinants are those that refer to the expectations and influence of other individuals or groups on project actions. Included in these, group identity or cohesive strength has been found to have the most influence on escalation of commitment while public evaluation of decision and resistance to decision from others has little significance in relation.&lt;ref name="Sleesman2012"/&gt;

==== External justification and binding ====
Individuals present themselves cautiously to others in the environment. They don't concentrate on themselves and what they believe is accurate and competent—they are only interested in their organization appearing competent. Escalation of commitment is about decision making that usually comes in a form of a group or individual deciding a course of action. Managers have a responsibility to choose the fate of what a group of people have been working on. A manager who decides to back a team out of a project isn't concerned that the project failed, they are concerned that team members may think the manager is incompetent. Studies that tested this phenomenon included factors such as policy resistance, job insecurity (Fox &amp; Staw 1979), and audience size (Rubin &amp; Lang 1981). All showed a spike in commitment when these realistic factors are present. This mental and emotional response is referred to as the face-saving effect. Individuals who are responsible for others are constantly checking themselves to assure that their actions and beliefs are parallel to the expectations for their viewers. One's social identity to the public can decide your fate. For example, a team can identify a level of commitment and personal connection to an idea or project. Team members consistently use statements like "that project is Bob's baby," or "oh, we had the same idea." Both ends of the spectrum are crucial to how others view and analyze a situation, especially something that failed.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

==== Leadership norms ====
Leaders are responsible for guiding a team through the difficult problems into a solution. Although many times, the negative aspects of commitments can discussed in more detail and importance, there are many social rewards that are positive. One example of this phenomenon is persistence. A project on the verge of failure is a manager's responsibility to revive, but with persistence, a manager can get rewarded to turning a bad project into something great. Rewards are earned for turning around a team to produce something successful. When managers stick to their goals, and get their team to produce responsibly.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

=== Structural ===

Structural determinants are those that refer to the cultural and environmental features and resources of the project's overall organization. The minimal research available on them indicates that agency problems most influence escalation of commitment.&lt;ref name="Sleesman2012"/&gt;

There are macro-level variables that affect the organizational structure of a team and how the make decisions. Decisions are made based on individuals in a group setting with specific roles and responsibilities and effect decisions that are a product of interaction in the team. The determinant that affects escalation of commitment is institutional inertia. This phenomenon is used to describe how individual attitudes and behavior changes frequently, so therefore, a group's stature is also unpredictable and controllable. "Organizations have very imperfect sensory systems, making them relatively impervious to changes in their environments."&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

This is one factor that plays a role in how issues are addressed. When there are a group of individuals involved in communication, decisions, and change, with the lack of consistency in the group, most of the tasks fail to complete. This phenomenon occurs in situations such as policy change, rulings and procedures.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

This issue can also cause havoc for an organization when they are too attached to a policy, thought process or identity because they are not free to change. "On occasion, a project, product, or policy can become so closely tied to the values and purposes of the organization that it becomes almost unthinkable to consider withdrawal."&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt; One primary example of this phenomenon is the downfall of the [[Pan American World Airways]] company, commonly known as Pan Am. Pan Am was a well known airlines and hotel with hundreds of employees. With the turn of industry, airline policies were deregulated and caused financial downfall for Pan Am. The company over time made cuts to their company to stay afloat. The company believed that their image of being an airline was more important than being a successful company that they removed all of the assets that were in fact making them the largest amount of revenue only to save the image they thought they needed to remain to be Pan Am.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

== Groups vs individuals ==
In groups, it can be more difficult to attribute issues to a single, simpler determinant. While determinants are still applicable, oftentimes there are more complex factors when organizational goals and actions misalign. Groups, especially as they grow larger, can be resistant to changing course.

Even if the need to change course or cease action is recognized, communication speed, policies, and business politics can be hindrances.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt; A larger organization, especially one with a spread of subgroups, has to communicate the argument and decision to go against previous actions across the appropriate levels. If this communication does not occur in a timely manner or is blocked, the final decision may not be made and acted upon. A decision that goes against existing rules and processes may also reach resistance even with support from those within the organization. Individuals and groups that are directly employed due to a project, have financial stake in it may provide enough opposition to prevent changes from being made as well. They feel personally responsible for the parts they've worked on and can also feel that they too are being replaced or terminated.&lt;ref name="Stray2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stray|first1=Viktoria Gulliksen|last2=Moe|first2=Nils Brede|last3=Dybå|first3=Tore|chapter=Escalation of Commitment: A Longitudinal Case Study of Daily Meetings|date=2012|volume=111|pages=153–167|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-30350-0_11|title=Agile Processes in Software Engineering and Extreme Programming|ISBN=978-3-642-30349-4|series= Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Escalation of commitment can then occur in any of these situations. External groups can play an even larger part in escalating commitment if their power is greater than that of the group taking action and they use that power to directly lead and influence.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

With a larger number of decision makers included, groups have the opportunity for greater productivity than single individuals, but they also have the opportunity for greater losses and escalation.&lt;ref name="Bazerman1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bazerman|first1=Max H.|last2=Giuliano|first2=Toni|last3=Appelman|first3=Alan|title=Escalation of commitment in individual and group decision making|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Performance|date=1984|volume=33|issue=2|pages=141–152|doi=10.1016/0030-5073(84)90017-5|url=http://www.gwern.net/docs/sunkcosts/1984-bazerman.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318080454/http://www.gwern.net/docs/sunkcosts/1984-bazerman.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members can eliminate some of the escalation potential if they come to a better decision earlier on in the process and avoid the need to change course dramatically. Yet they can also hold onto a larger base of support for their initial actions to the point where escalation potential is increased. In this case, [[groupthink]] assists in keeping with the original decision and pressures towards conformity rather than dividing the group with other options. Also, a group whose members are not cohesive can have decreased escalation potential due to conflicts and varying levels of inclusion in the process.&lt;ref name="Bazerman1984" /&gt;

Organizations that are family businesses are especially prone to escalation of commitment due to the added level of going through the family structure in addition to the business structure, allowing for further conflicts between the two.&lt;ref name="Woods2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woods|first1=Jeremy A.|last2=Dalziel|first2=Thomas|last3=Barton|first3=Sidney L.|title=Escalation of commitment in private family businesses: The influence of outside board members|journal=Journal of Family Business Strategy|date=2012|volume=3|issue=1|pages=18–27|doi=10.1016/j.jfbs.2012.01.002|url=http://jeremyawoods.com/documents/Research/Woods%20Dalziel%20Barton%202012.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504212721/http://jeremyawoods.com/documents/Research/Woods%20Dalziel%20Barton%202012.pdf|archivedate=2016-05-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Business reputation, customer and share loss, and financial loss become risks.

==Biography==
He received in 1977 from [[Harvey Mudd College]] his bachelor's degree&lt;ref name=UCB/&gt; and in 1982 from the [[University of Chicago]] his PhD under the supervision of [[Alberto Calderón]] with thesis ''Restrictions of the Fourier transform to submanifolds of low codimension''.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=9337|title=F. Michael (Francis) Christ}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Princeton University]] (where he worked with Elias M. Stein), Christ was from 1982 to 1984 an instructor and from 1984 to 1986 an assistant professor. He was at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) from 1986 to 1988 an associate professor and from 1988 to 1996 a full professor. In 1996 he became a full professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref name=Notices/&gt;

Christ was a Sloan Fellow for the academic year 1986–1987. In 1990 in Kyoto he was an invited speaker at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christ, M.|title=''In:'' Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians, Kyoto, 1990|chapter=Precise analysis of &lt;math&gt;\overline{\partial_b}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{\partial}&lt;/math&gt; on domains of finite type in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;{{space|1}}|volume=vol. 1|pages=859–877|chapter-url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.467.4109&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 he shared with [[David E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2803">In [[algebraic geometry]], '''Fay's trisecant identity''' is an identity between [[theta function]]s of [[Riemann surface]]s introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Fay|authorlink=John David Fay|year=1973|loc=chapter 3, page 34, formula 45}}. Fay's identity holds for theta functions of Jacobians of curves, but not for theta functions of general [[abelian variety|abelian varieties]].

The name "trisecant identity" refers to the geometric interpretation given by {{harvtxt|Mumford|1984|loc=p.3.219}}, who used it to show that the [[Kummer variety]] of a genus ''g'' Riemann surface, given by the image of the map from the Jacobian to projective space of dimension 2&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;1 induced by theta functions of order&amp;nbsp;2, has a 4-dimensional space of trisecants.

==Statement==

Suppose that
*''C'' is a compact Riemann surface
*''g'' is the genus of ''C''
*θ is the Riemann theta function of ''C'', a function from '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;/sup&gt; to '''C'''
*''E'' is a [[prime form]] on ''C''&amp;times;''C''
*''u'',''v'',''x'',''y'' are points of ''C''
*''z'' is an element of '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;/sup&gt;
*ω is a 1-form on ''C'' with values in '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;/sup&gt;

The Fay's identity states that

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;E(x,v)E(u,y)\theta\left(z+\int_u^x\omega\right)\theta\left(z+\int_v^y\omega\right)\\
-
&amp;E(x,u)E(v,y)\theta\left(z+\int_v^x\omega\right)\theta\left(z+\int_u^y\omega\right)\\
=
&amp;E(x,y)E(u,v)\theta(z)\theta\left(z+\int_{u+v}^{x+y}\omega\right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

with

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;\int_{u+v}^{x+y}\omega=\int_u^x\omega+\int_v^y\omega=\int_u^y\omega+\int_v^x\omega
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:One5Root.svg|thumb|The 5th [[roots of unity]] in the complex plane under multiplication form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] of order 5. Each non-identity element by itself is a generator for the whole group.]]
In [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], the term '''generator''' or '''generating set''' may refer to any of a number of related concepts.  The underlying concept in each case is that of a smaller [[set (mathematics)|set]] of objects, together with a set of [[Operation (mathematics)|operation]]s that can be applied to it, that result in the creation of a larger collection of objects, called the '''generated set'''.  The larger set is then said to be '''generated by''' the smaller set.  It is commonly the case that the generating set has a simpler set of properties than the generated set, thus making it easier to discuss and examine.  It is usually the case that properties of the generating set are in some way preserved by the act of generation; likewise, the properties of the generated set are often reflected in the generating set.

==List of generators==

A list of examples of generating sets follow.

* Generating set or [[spanning set]] of a [[vector space]]: a set that spans the vector space.
* [[Generating set of a group]]: A subset of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] that is not contained in any [[subgroup]] of the group other than the entire group.
* [[Subring#Subring generated by a set|Generating set of a ring]]: A subset ''S'' of a ring ''A'' '''generates''' ''A'' if the only [[subring]] of ''A'' containing ''S'' is ''A''.
* [[Ideal (ring theory)#Ideal generated by a set|Generating set of an ideal]] in a ring.
* [[Generating set of a module]]
* A [[generator (category theory)|generator]], in [[category theory]], is an [[object (category theory)|object]] that can be used to distinguish [[morphism]]s.
* In [[topology]], a collection of sets that generate the topology is called a [[subbase]].
* Generating set of a [[topological algebra]]: ''S'' is a generating set of a [[topological algebra]] ''A'' if the smallest closed [[subalgebra]] of ''A'' containing ''S'' is ''A''.

==Differential equations==
In the study of [[differential equation]]s, and commonly those occurring in [[physics]], one has the idea of a set of infinitesimal displacements that can be extended to obtain a [[manifold]], or at least, a local part of it, by means of integration.  The general concept is of using the [[exponential map (Riemannian geometry)|exponential map]] to take the vectors in the [[tangent space]] and extend them, as [[geodesic]]s, to an open set surrounding the tangent point. In this case, it is not unusual to call the elements of the tangent space the ''generators'' of the manifold. When the manifold possesses some sort of symmetry, there is also the related notion of a ''charge'' or ''current'', which is sometimes also called the generator, although, strictly speaking, charges are not elements of the tangent space.

* Elements of the [[Lie algebra]] to a [[Lie group]] are sometimes referred to as "generators of the group," especially by physicists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Quantum Field Theory|first1=D. |last1= McMahon|publisher=Mc Graw Hill|year=2008|isbn=978-0-07-154382-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lie algebra]] can be thought of as the infinitesimal vectors generating the group, at least locally, by means of the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]], but the Lie algebra does not form a generating set in the strict sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics |first1=C.B. |last1= Parker|edition=2nd|publisher=Mc Graw Hill|year=1994|isbn=0-07-051400-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[stochastic processes|stochastic analysis]], an [[Itō diffusion]] or more general [[Itō process]] has an [[Infinitesimal generator (stochastic processes)|infinitesimal generator]].
* The '''generator''' of any [[continuous symmetry]] implied by [[Noether's theorem]], the generators of a [[Lie group]] being a special case. In this case, a generator is sometimes called a [[charge (physics)|charge]] or [[Noether charge]], examples include:
**[[angular momentum#Total angular momentum as generator of rotations|angular momentum]] as the generator of [[rotation]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Quantum Mechanics|first1=E.|last1= Abers|publisher=Addison Wesley, Prentice Hall Inc|year=2004|isbn=978-0-131-461000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[momentum#Symmetry and conservation|linear momentum]] as the generator of [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Quantum Mechanics|first1=E.|last1= Abers|publisher=Addison Wesley, Prentice Hall Inc|year=2004|isbn=978-0-131-461000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[electric charge]] being the generator of the [[U(1)]] symmetry group of [[electromagnetism]],
**the [[color charge]]s of [[quark]]s are the generators of the [[SU(3)]] [[color symmetry]] in [[quantum chromodynamics]],
*More precisely, "charge" should apply only to the [[root system]] of a Lie group.

It was only in the 20th century that Leibniz's [[law of continuity]] and [[transcendental law of homogeneity]] found mathematical implementation (by means of [[non-standard analysis]]). He became one of the most prolific inventors in the field of [[mechanical calculator]]s. While working on adding automatic multiplication and division to [[Pascal's calculator]], he was the first to describe a [[pinwheel calculator]] in 1685&lt;ref&gt;[[#SMITH|David Smith]], pp. 173–181 (1929)&lt;/ref&gt; and invented the [[Leibniz wheel]], used in the [[arithmometer]], the first mass-produced mechanical calculator. He also refined the [[binary number]] system, which is the foundation of all digital computers.

In philosophy, Leibniz is most noted for his [[Philosophical optimism|optimism]], i.e. his conclusion that our [[universe]] is, in a restricted sense, the [[Best of all possible worlds|best possible one]] that God could have created, an idea that was often lampooned by others such as [[Voltaire]]. Leibniz, along with [[René Descartes]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]], was one of the three great 17th-century advocates of [[rationalism]]. The work of Leibniz anticipated modern [[logic]] and [[analytic philosophy]], but his philosophy also looks back to the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition, in which conclusions are produced by applying reason to first principles or prior definitions rather than to empirical evidence.

Leibniz made major contributions to [[physics]] and technology, and anticipated notions that surfaced much later in philosophy, [[probability theory]], [[biology]], medicine, geology, [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], and [[computer science]]. He wrote works on philosophy, politics, law, ethics, theology, history, and [[philology]]. Leibniz also contributed to the field of library science. While serving as overseer of the Wolfenbüttel library in Germany, he devised a cataloging system that would serve as a guide for many of Europe's largest libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart A.P.;  introduction by Donald G.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Gottfried Leibniz was born on 1 July 1646, toward the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]], in [[Leipzig]], [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], to [[Friedrich Leibniz]] and Catharina Schmuck. Friedrich noted in his family journal:
{{quote|21. Juny am Sontag 1646 Ist mein Sohn Gottfried Wilhelm, post sextam vespertinam 1/4 uff 7 uhr abents zur welt gebohren, im Wassermann.}}
In English:
{{quote|On Sunday 21 June {{bracket|[[New Style|NS]]: 1 July}} 1646, my son Gottfried Wilhelm is born into the world a quarter before seven in the evening, in Aquarius.&lt;ref&gt;It is possible that the words "in Aquarius" refer to the Moon (the Sun in Cancer; Sagittarius rising (Ascendant)); see [http://www.astro.com/cgi/chart.cgi?wgid=wgeJw9js0KwjAQhJ9GUFilG2z9CXsOiHfPKYlpsIklTSnp07tFkTkMzLfszOxfnoR0gTTKaOhufRv9Auqd8zN5ayAAwgmwOTaA5yvWEFBYUYGbeqiA74fFO1A2BR0LfFmNES8wMWdJbdqog6X_z42ofj0rMzpbQs5uU1_Y1iq2rUvWHXayzWXghSF3pPMsu7HQHmUaCR_qAw0rOyM Astro-Databank chart of Gottfried Leibniz].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The original has "1/4 uff 7 uhr" and there is good reason to assume that also in the 17th century this meant a quarter ''to'' seven, since the "uff", in its modern form of "auf", is still, {{as of|2018|lc=y}} exactly in this vernacular, in use in several Low German speaking regions. The quote is given by Hartmut Hecht in ''Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz'' (Teubner-Archiv zur Mathematik, Volume 2, 1992), in the first lines of chapter 2, ''Der junge Leibniz'', p. 15; see [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-663-05995-0_2#page-1 H. Hecht, ''Der junge Leibniz'']; see also [https://play.google.com/books/reader?printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;id=fHJMAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=GBS.RA1-PA3 G. E. Guhrauer, ''G. W. Frhr. v. {{notatypo|Leibnitz}}''. Vol. 1. Breslau 1846, Anm. p. 4].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Leibniz was baptized on 3 July of that year at [[St. Nicholas Church, Leipzig]]; his godfather was the [[Lutheran]] theologian {{Interlanguage link multi|Martin Geier|de}}.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Müller, Gisela Krönert, ''Leben und Werk von Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz: Eine Chronik''. Frankfurt a.M., Klostermann 1969, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; His father died when he was six years old, and from that point on he was raised by his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Leibniz: Metaphysics and Language|url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3M8DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=Gottfried+Leibniz+father+died+when+he+was+six+and+a+half+years+old#v=onepage&amp;q=Gottfried%20Leibniz%20father%20died%20when%20he%20was%20six%20and%20a%20half%20years%20old&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-19-505946-5|author1=Mates|first1=Benson|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz's father had been a Professor of Moral Philosophy at the [[University of Leipzig]], and the boy later inherited his father's personal library. He was given free access to it from the age of seven. While Leibniz's schoolwork was largely confined to the study of a small [[Canon (basic principle)|canon]] of authorities, his father's library enabled him to study a wide variety of advanced philosophical and theological works—ones that he would not have otherwise been able to read until his college years.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie (1845), 21&lt;/ref&gt; Access to his father's library, largely written in [[Latin]], also led to his proficiency in the Latin language, which he achieved by the age of 12.  He also composed 300 [[hexameters]] of [[Latin poetry|Latin verse]], in a single morning, for a special event at school at the age of 13.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie (1845), 22&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1661 he enrolled in his father's former university at age 14,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Leibniz.html|title=Leibniz biography|website=www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arthur p. 16"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mackie (1845), 26&lt;/ref&gt; and completed his [[bachelor's degree]] in Philosophy in December 1662. He defended his ''Disputatio Metaphysica de Principio Individui'' (''Metaphysical Disputation on the Principle of Individuation''),&lt;ref name="Arthur p. x"&gt;Arthur 2014, p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; which addressed the [[principle of individuation]], on 9 June 1663. Leibniz earned his master's degree in Philosophy on 7 February 1664. He published and defended a [[dissertation]] ''Specimen Quaestionum Philosophicarum ex Jure collectarum'' (''An Essay of Collected Philosophical Problems of Right''),&lt;ref name="Arthur p. x"/&gt; arguing for both a theoretical and a pedagogical relationship between philosophy and law, in December 1664. After one year of legal studies, he was awarded his bachelor's degree in Law on 28 September 1665.&lt;ref&gt;Hubertus Busche, ''Leibniz' Weg ins perspektivische Universum: Eine Harmonie im Zeitalter der Berechnung'', Meiner Verlag, 1997, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; His dissertation was titled ''De conditionibus'' (''On Conditions'').&lt;ref name="Arthur p. x"/&gt;

In early 1666, at age 19, Leibniz wrote his first book, ''[[De Arte Combinatoria]]'' (''On the Combinatorial Art''), the first part of which was also his [[habilitation]] thesis in Philosophy, which he defended in March 1666.&lt;ref name="Arthur p. x"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A few copies of ''De Arte Combinatoria'' were produced as requested for the habilitation procedure; it was reprinted without his consent in 1690.&lt;/ref&gt; His next goal was to earn his license and Doctorate in Law, which normally required three years of study. In 1666, the University of Leipzig turned down Leibniz's doctoral application and refused to grant him a Doctorate in Law, most likely due to his relative youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jolley|first=Nicholas|title=The Cambridge Companion to Leibniz|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}:20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simmons|first=George|title=Calculus Gems: Brief Lives and Memorable Mathematics|year=2007|publisher=MAA}}:143&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz subsequently left Leipzig.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie (1845), 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz then enrolled in the [[University of Altdorf]] and quickly submitted a thesis, which he had probably been working on earlier in Leipzig.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie (1845), 39&lt;/ref&gt; The title of his thesis was ''Disputatio Inauguralis de Casibus Perplexis in Jure'' (''Inaugural Disputation on Ambiguous Legal Cases'').&lt;ref name="Arthur p. x"/&gt; Leibniz earned his license to practice law and his Doctorate in Law in November 1666. He next declined the offer of an academic appointment at Altdorf, saying that "my thoughts were turned in an entirely different direction".&lt;ref&gt;Mackie (1845), 40&lt;/ref&gt;

As an adult, Leibniz often introduced himself as "Gottfried [[von]] Leibniz". Many posthumously published editions of his writings presented his name on the title page as "[[Freiherr]] G. W. von Leibniz." However, no document has ever been found from any contemporary government that stated his appointment to any form of [[nobility]].&lt;ref&gt;Aiton 1985: 312&lt;/ref&gt;

===1666–1676&lt;!--linked from the lead section--&gt;===
[[File:Gottfried-Wilhelm-Leibniz-Louis-Dutens-opera-omnia MG 1180.tif|thumb|Engraving of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]Leibniz's first position was as a salaried secretary to an [[alchemy|alchemical]] society in [[Nuremberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Ariew R., G.W. Leibniz, life and works, p. 21 in ''The Cambridge Companion to Leibniz'', ed. by N. Jolley, Cambridge University Press, 1994, {{isbn|0-521-36588-0}}. [https://books.google.com/books?id=SnRis5Gdi8gC&amp;pg=PA21 Extract of page 21]&lt;/ref&gt; He knew fairly little about the subject at that time but presented himself as deeply learned. He soon met [[Johann Christian von Boyneburg]] (1622–1672), the dismissed chief minister of the Elector of [[Mainz]], [[Johann Philipp von Schönborn]].&lt;ref&gt;Mackie (1845), 43&lt;/ref&gt; Von Boyneburg hired Leibniz as an assistant, and shortly thereafter reconciled with the Elector and introduced Leibniz to him. Leibniz then dedicated an essay on law to the Elector in the hope of obtaining employment. The stratagem worked; the Elector asked Leibniz to assist with the redrafting of the legal code for the Electorate.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie (1845), 44–45&lt;/ref&gt; In 1669, Leibniz was appointed assessor in the Court of Appeal. Although von Boyneburg died late in 1672, Leibniz remained under the employment of his widow until she dismissed him in 1674.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Von Boyneburg did much to promote Leibniz's reputation, and the latter's memoranda and letters began to attract favorable notice. After Leibniz's service to the Elector there soon followed a diplomatic role. He published an essay, under the pseudonym of a fictitious Polish nobleman, arguing (unsuccessfully) for the German candidate for the Polish crown. The main force in European geopolitics during Leibniz's adult life was the ambition of [[Louis XIV of France]], backed by French military and economic might. Meanwhile, the [[Thirty Years' War]] had left [[German language in Europe|German-speaking Europe]] exhausted, fragmented, and economically backward. Leibniz proposed to protect German-speaking Europe by distracting Louis as follows. France would be invited to take [[Egypt]] as a stepping stone towards an eventual conquest of the [[Dutch East Indies]]. In return, France would agree to leave Germany and the Netherlands undisturbed. This plan obtained the Elector's cautious support. In 1672, the French government invited Leibniz to Paris for discussion,&lt;ref&gt;Mackie (1845), 58–61&lt;/ref&gt; but the plan was soon overtaken by the outbreak of the [[Franco-Dutch War]] and became irrelevant. Napoleon's [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|failed invasion of Egypt in 1798]] can be seen as an unwitting, late implementation of Leibniz's plan, after the Eastern hemisphere colonial supremacy in Europe had already passed from the Dutch to the British.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Thus Leibniz went to Paris in 1672. Soon after arriving, he met Dutch physicist and mathematician [[Christiaan Huygens]] and realised that his own knowledge of mathematics and physics was patchy. With Huygens as his mentor, he began a program of [[self-study]] that soon pushed him to making major contributions to both subjects, including discovering his version of the differential and integral [[calculus]]. He met [[Nicolas Malebranche]] and [[Antoine Arnauld]], the leading French philosophers of the day, and studied the writings of [[Descartes]] and [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], unpublished as well as published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz/#Life|title=Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|last=|first=|date=|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He befriended a German mathematician, [[Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus]]; they corresponded for the rest of their lives.

[[File:Leibnitzrechenmaschine.jpg|thumb|[[Stepped reckoner]]]]

When it became clear that France would not implement its part of Leibniz's Egyptian plan, the Elector sent his nephew, escorted by Leibniz, on a related mission to the English government in London, early in 1673.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie (1845), 69–70&lt;/ref&gt; There Leibniz came into acquaintance of [[Henry Oldenburg]] and [[John Collins (mathematician)|John Collins]]. He met with the [[Royal Society]] where he demonstrated a calculating machine that he had designed and had been building since 1670. The machine was able to execute all four basic operations (adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing), and the society quickly made him an external member.

The mission ended abruptly when news of the Elector's death (12 February 1673) reached them. Leibniz promptly returned to Paris and not, as had been planned, to Mainz.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie (1845), 73–74&lt;/ref&gt; The sudden deaths of his two patrons in the same winter meant that Leibniz had to find a new basis for his career.

In this regard, a 1669 invitation from the [[John Frederick, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|John Frederick]] of [[Brunswick-Lüneburg|Brunswick]] to visit Hanover proved to have been fateful. Leibniz had declined the invitation, but had begun corresponding with the duke in 1671. In 1673, the duke offered Leibniz the post of counsellor. Leibniz very reluctantly accepted the position two years later, only after it became clear that no employment in Paris, whose intellectual stimulation he relished, or with the [[Habsburg]] imperial court, was forthcoming.&lt;ref name="CRC Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Martin|title=The Universal Computer : The Road from Leibniz to Turing|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=1-138-50208-1|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1675 he tried to get admitted to the [[French Academy of Sciences]] as a foreign honorary member, but it was considered that there were already enough foreigners there and so no invitation came. He left Paris in October 1676.

===House of Hanover, 1676–1716===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
Leibniz managed to delay his arrival in Hanover until the end of 1676 after making one more short journey to London, where Newton accused him of having seen Newton's unpublished work on calculus in advance.&lt;ref&gt;On the encounter between Newton and Leibniz and a review of the evidence, see Alfred Rupert Hall, ''Philosophers at War: The Quarrel Between Newton and Leibniz'', (Cambridge, 2002), pp. 44–69.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was alleged to be evidence supporting the accusation, made decades later, that he had stolen calculus from Newton. On the journey from London to Hanover, Leibniz stopped in [[The Hague]] where he met [[van Leeuwenhoek]], the discoverer of microorganisms. He also spent several days in intense discussion with [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], who had just completed his masterwork, the ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie (1845), 117–118&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1677, he was promoted, at his request, to Privy Counselor of Justice, a post he held for the rest of his life. Leibniz served three consecutive rulers of the House of Brunswick as historian, political adviser, and most consequentially, as librarian of the [[duke|ducal]] library. He thenceforth employed his pen on all the various political, historical, and [[theological]] matters involving the House of Brunswick; the resulting documents form a valuable part of the historical record for the period.

Leibniz began promoting a project to use windmills to improve the mining operations in the Harz Mountains. This project did little to improve mining operations and was shut down by Duke Ernst August in 1685.&lt;ref name="CRC Press"/&gt;

Among the few people in north Germany to accept Leibniz were the Electress [[Sophia of Hanover]] (1630–1714), her daughter [[Sophia Charlotte of Hanover]] (1668–1705), the Queen of Prussia and his avowed disciple, and [[Caroline of Ansbach]], the consort of her grandson, the future [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]. To each of these women he was correspondent, adviser, and friend. In turn, they all approved of Leibniz more than did their spouses and the future king [[George I of Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;For a study of Leibniz's correspondence with Sophia Charlotte, see MacDonald Ross, George, 1990, "Leibniz's Exposition of His System to Queen Sophie Charlotte and Other Ladies." In ''Leibniz in Berlin'', ed. H. Poser and A. Heinekamp, Stuttgart: Franz Steiner, 1990, 61–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of Hanover was only about 10,000, and its provinciality eventually grated on Leibniz. Nevertheless, to be a major courtier to the House of [[Brunswick-Lüneburg|Brunswick]] was quite an honor, especially in light of the meteoric rise in the prestige of that House during Leibniz's association with it. In 1692, the Duke of Brunswick became a hereditary Elector of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The British [[Act of Settlement 1701]] designated the Electress Sophia and her descent as the royal family of England, once both King [[William III of England|William III]] and his sister-in-law and successor, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], were dead. Leibniz played a role in the initiatives and negotiations leading up to that Act, but not always an effective one. For example, something he published anonymously in England, thinking to promote the Brunswick cause, was formally censured by the [[British Parliament]].

The Brunswicks tolerated the enormous effort Leibniz devoted to intellectual pursuits unrelated to his duties as a courtier, pursuits such as perfecting calculus, writing about other mathematics, logic, physics, and philosophy, and keeping up a vast correspondence. He began working on calculus in 1674; the earliest evidence of its use in his surviving notebooks is 1675. By 1677 he had a coherent system in hand, but did not publish it until 1684. Leibniz's most important mathematical papers were published between 1682 and 1692, usually in a journal which he and [[Otto Mencke]] founded in 1682, the ''[[Acta Eruditorum]]''. That journal played a key role in advancing his mathematical and scientific reputation, which in turn enhanced his eminence in diplomacy, history, theology, and philosophy.

[[File:Korespondencja Gottfrieda Leibniza.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Leibniz's correspondence, papers and notes from 1669 to 1704, [[National Library of Poland]].]]

The Elector [[Ernest Augustus, Elector of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Ernest Augustus]] commissioned Leibniz to write a history of the House of Brunswick, going back to the time of [[Charlemagne]] or earlier, hoping that the resulting book would advance his dynastic ambitions. From 1687 to 1690, Leibniz traveled extensively in Germany, Austria, and Italy, seeking and finding archival materials bearing on this project. Decades went by but no history appeared; the next Elector became quite annoyed at Leibniz's apparent dilatoriness. Leibniz never finished the project, in part because of his huge output on many other fronts, but also because he insisted on writing a meticulously researched and erudite book based on archival sources, when his patrons would have been quite happy with a short popular book, one perhaps little more than a [[genealogy]] with commentary, to be completed in three years or less. They never knew that he had in fact carried out a fair part of his assigned task: when the material Leibniz had written and collected for his history of the House of Brunswick was finally published in the 19th century, it filled three volumes.

Leibniz was appointed Librarian of the [[Herzog August Library]] in [[Wolfenbüttel]], [[Lower Saxony]], in 1691.

In 1708, [[John Keill]], writing in the journal of the Royal Society and with Newton's presumed blessing, accused Leibniz of having plagiarised Newton's calculus.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie (1845), 109&lt;/ref&gt; Thus began the [[Newton v. Leibniz calculus controversy|calculus priority dispute]] which darkened the remainder of Leibniz's life. A formal investigation by the Royal Society (in which Newton was an unacknowledged participant), undertaken in response to Leibniz's demand for a retraction, upheld Keill's charge. Historians of mathematics writing since 1900 or so have tended to acquit Leibniz, pointing to important differences between Leibniz's and Newton's versions of calculus.

In 1711, while traveling in northern Europe, the Russian [[Tsar]] [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] stopped in Hanover and met Leibniz, who then took some interest in Russian matters for the rest of his life. In 1712, Leibniz began a two-year residence in [[Vienna]], where he was appointed Imperial Court Councillor to the [[Habsburg]]s. On the death of Queen Anne in 1714, Elector George Louis became King [[George I of Great Britain]], under the terms of the 1701 Act of Settlement. Even though Leibniz had done much to bring about this happy event, it was not to be his hour of glory. Despite the intercession of the Princess of Wales, Caroline of Ansbach, George I forbade Leibniz to join him in London until he completed at least one volume of the history of the Brunswick family his father had commissioned nearly 30 years earlier. Moreover, for George I to include Leibniz in his London court would have been deemed insulting to Newton, who was seen as having won the calculus priority dispute and whose standing in British official circles could not have been higher. Finally, his dear friend and defender, the Dowager Electress Sophia, died in 1714.

===Death===
Leibniz died in [[Hanover]] in 1716: at the time, he was so out of favor that neither George I (who happened to be near Hanover at that time) nor any fellow courtier other than his personal secretary attended the funeral. Even though Leibniz was a life member of the Royal Society and the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy of Sciences]], neither organization saw fit to honor his death. His grave went unmarked for more than 50 years. Leibniz was eulogized by [[Bernard de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]], before the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in Paris, which had admitted him as a foreign member in 1700. The eulogy was composed at the behest of the [[Elizabeth Charlotte, Princess Palatine|Duchess of Orleans]], a niece of the Electress Sophia.

===Personal life===
Leibniz never married. He complained on occasion about money, but the fair sum he left to his sole heir, his sister's stepson, proved that the Brunswicks had, by and large, paid him well. In his diplomatic endeavors, he at times verged on the unscrupulous, as was all too often the case with professional diplomats of his day. On several occasions, Leibniz backdated and altered personal manuscripts, actions which put him in a bad light during the [[Newton v. Leibniz calculus controversy|calculus controversy]]. On the other hand, he was charming, well-mannered, and not without humor and imagination.&lt;ref&gt;See Wiener IV.6 and Loemker §40. Also see a curious passage titled "Leibniz's Philosophical Dream," first published by Bodemann in 1895 and translated on p. 253 of Morris, Mary, ed. and trans., 1934. ''Philosophical Writings''. Dent &amp; Sons Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; He had many friends and admirers all over Europe. On Leibniz's religious views, though he was a [[protestant]], Leibniz learned to appreciate aspects of [[Catholicism]] through his patrons and colleagues. He never admitted the Protestant view of Pope as an Antichrist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/~mroinila/reunion.html|title=Leibniz's Attempts to the Reunification of the Churches|first=|last=Markku|website=www.helsinki.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz was claimed as a [[philosophical theism|philosophical theist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christian Mathematicians – Leibniz – God &amp; Math – Thinking Christianly About Math Education|url=http://godandmath.com/2012/01/30/christian-mathematicians-leibniz/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Discourse on Metaphysics and Other Writings|year=2012|publisher=Broadview Press|isbn=978-1-55481-011-6|pages=23–24|author=Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|editor=Peter Loptson|quote=The answer is unknowable, but it may not be unreasonable to see him, at least in theological terms, as essentially a deist.

Nonetheless, Leibniz is a theist. His system is generated from, and needs, the postulate of a creative god. In fact, though, despite Leibniz's protestations, his God is more the architect and engineer of the vast complex world-system than the embodiment of love of Christian orthodoxy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Owen's Ape &amp; Darwin's Bulldog: Beyond Darwinism and Creationism|year=2009|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-22051-6|pages=102–103|author=Christopher Ernest Cosans|quote=In advancing his system of mechanics, Newton claimed that collisions of celestial objects would cause a loss of energy that would require God to intervene from time to time to maintain order in the solar system (Vailati 1997, 37–42).

According to their doctrine, God Almighty wants to wind up his watch from time to time; otherwise it would cease to move." (Leibniz 1715, 675) Leibniz argues that any scientific theory that relies on God to perform miracles after He had first made the universe indicates that God lacked sufficient foresight or power to establish adequate natural laws in the first place. In defense of Newton's theism, Clarke is unapologetic: "'tis not a diminution but the true glory of his workmanship that nothing is done without his continual government and inspection"' (Leibniz 1715, 676–677). Clarke is believed to have consulted closely with Newton on how to respond to Leibniz. He asserts that Leibniz's deism leads to "the notion of materialism and fate" (1715, 677), because it excludes God from the daily workings of nature.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Controversy in Marketing Theory: For Reason, Realism, Truth, and Objectivity|year=2003|publisher=M.E.

== Philosopher ==
Leibniz's philosophical thinking appears fragmented, because his philosophical writings consist mainly of a multitude of short pieces: journal articles, manuscripts published long after his death, and many letters to many correspondents. He wrote only two book-length philosophical treatises, of which only the ''Théodicée'' of 1710 was published in his lifetime.

Leibniz dated his beginning as a philosopher to his ''[[Discourse on Metaphysics]]'', which he composed in 1686 as a commentary on a running dispute between [[Nicolas Malebranche]] and [[Antoine Arnauld]]. This led to an extensive and valuable correspondence with Arnauld;&lt;ref&gt;Ariew &amp; Garber, 69; Loemker, §§36, 38&lt;/ref&gt; it and the ''Discourse'' were not published until the 19th century. In 1695, Leibniz made his public entrée into European philosophy with a journal article titled "New System of the Nature and Communication of Substances".&lt;ref&gt;Ariew &amp; Garber, 138; Loemker, §47; Wiener, II.4&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1695 and 1705, he composed his ''[[New Essays on Human Understanding]]'', a lengthy commentary on [[John Locke]]'s 1690 ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', but upon learning of Locke's 1704 death, lost the desire to publish it, so that the ''New Essays'' were not published until 1765. The ''[[Monadology|Monadologie]]'', composed in 1714 and published posthumously, consists of 90 aphorisms.

Leibniz met [[Spinoza]] in 1676, read some of his unpublished writings, and has since been suspected of appropriating some of Spinoza's ideas. While Leibniz admired Spinoza's powerful intellect, he was also forthrightly dismayed by Spinoza's conclusions,&lt;ref&gt;Ariew &amp; Garber, 272–284; Loemker, §§14, 20, 21; Wiener, III.8&lt;/ref&gt; especially when these were inconsistent with Christian orthodoxy.

Unlike Descartes and Spinoza, Leibniz had a thorough university education in philosophy. He was influenced by his [[Leipzig]] professor [[Jakob Thomasius]], who also supervised his BA thesis in philosophy.&lt;ref name="Arthur p. 13"&gt;Arthur 2014, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz also eagerly read [[Francisco Suárez]], a Spanish [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] respected even in [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] universities. Leibniz was deeply interested in the new methods and conclusions of Descartes, Huygens, Newton, and [[Robert Boyle|Boyle]], but viewed their work through a lens heavily tinted by scholastic notions. Yet it remains the case that Leibniz's methods and concerns often anticipate the [[logic]], and [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[linguistic philosophy]] of the 20th century.

=== Principles===&lt;!--Linked from "Difference (philosophy)"--&gt;
Leibniz variously invoked one or another of seven fundamental philosophical Principles:&lt;ref&gt;Mates (1986), chpts. 7.3, 9&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Identity (mathematics)|Identity]]/[[contradiction]]. If a proposition is true, then its negation is false and vice versa.
* [[Identity of indiscernibles]]. Two distinct things cannot have all their properties in common. If every predicate possessed by x is also possessed by y and vice versa, then entities x and y are identical; to suppose two things indiscernible is to suppose the same thing under two names. Frequently invoked in modern logic and philosophy, the "identity of indiscernibles" is often referred to as Leibniz's Law. It has attracted the most controversy and criticism, especially from corpuscular philosophy and quantum mechanics.
* [[principle of sufficient reason|Sufficient reason]]. "There must be a sufficient reason for anything to exist, for any event to occur, for any truth to obtain."&lt;ref&gt;Loemker 717&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pre-established harmony]].&lt;ref&gt;See Jolley (1995: 129–131), Woolhouse and Francks (1998), and Mercer (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; "[T]he appropriate nature of each substance brings it about that what happens to one corresponds to what happens to all the others, without, however, their acting upon one another directly." (''Discourse on Metaphysics'', XIV) A dropped glass shatters because it "knows" it has hit the ground, and not because the impact with the ground "compels" the glass to split.
* [[Law of Continuity]]. ''[[Natura non facit saltus]]''&lt;ref name="Saltus"&gt;Gottfried Leibniz, [[New Essays on Human Understanding|''New Essays'']], IV, 16: "''la nature ne fait jamais des sauts''". ''Natura non-facit saltus'' is the Latin translation of the phrase (originally put forward by [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]' ''[[Philosophia Botanica]]'', 1st ed., 1751, Chapter III, § 77, p. 27; see also [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]: [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/continuity/ "Continuity and Infinitesimals"] and [[Alexander Baumgarten]], ''Metaphysics: A Critical Translation with Kant's Elucidations'', Translated and Edited by Courtney D.

A variant translation is "''natura non-saltum facit''" (literally, "Nature does not make a jump") ({{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=goW6JsEUz4EC|title=Ökonomische Theorie und christlicher Glaube|last1=Britton|first1=Andrew|last2=Sedgwick|first2=Peter H.|last3=Bock|first3=Burghard|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|year=2008|isbn=978-3-8258-0162-5|page=289}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=goW6JsEUz4EC&amp;pg=PA289 Extract of page 289].)&lt;/ref&gt; (literally, "Nature does not make jumps").
* [[Philosophical optimism|Optimism]]. "God assuredly always chooses the best."&lt;ref&gt;Loemker 311&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Principle of plenitude|Plenitude]]. Leibniz believed that the best of all possible worlds would actualize every genuine possibility, and argued in ''Théodicée'' that this best of all possible worlds will contain all possibilities, with our finite experience of eternity giving no reason to dispute nature's perfection.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Lovejoy]], ''The [[Great Chain of Being]]''. Harvard University Press, 1936, Chapter V "Plenitude and Sufficient Reason in Leibniz and Spinoza", pp.&amp;nbsp;144–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz would on occasion give a rational defense of a specific principle, but more often took them for granted.&lt;ref&gt;For a precis of what Leibniz meant by these and other Principles, see Mercer (2001: 473–484). For a classic discussion of Sufficient Reason and Plenitude, see Lovejoy (1957).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monads===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
[[File:Leibniz Monadology 1.jpg|thumb|A page from Leibniz's manuscript of the ''[[Monadology]]'']]
Leibniz's best known contribution to [[metaphysics]] is his theory of [[Monad (philosophy)|monads]], as exposited in ''[[Monadology|Monadologie]]''. He proposes his theory that the universe is made of an infinite number of simple substances known as monads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Leary-Hawthorne|first1=John|last2=Cover|first2=J.A.|title=Substance and Individuation in Leibniz|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-07303-0|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monads can also be compared to the corpuscles of the [[Mechanical Philosophy]] of René Descartes and others. These simple substances or monads are the "ultimate units of existence in nature". Monads have no parts but still exist by the qualities that they have. These qualities are continuously changing over time, and each monad is unique. They are also not affected by time and are subject to only creation and annihilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rescher|first1=Nicholas|title=G.W. Leibniz's Monadology: an edition for students|date=1991|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|location=Pittsburgh|isbn=0-8229-5449-4|page=40|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monads are centers of [[force]]; substance is force, while [[space]], [[matter]], and [[Motion (physics)|motion]] are merely phenomenal.

Leibniz's proof of God can be summarized in the ''[[Théodicée]]''.&lt;ref name="Leibniz: A Guide for the Perplexed"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perkins|first1=Franklin|title=Leibniz: A Guide for the Perplexed|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=0-8264-8921-4|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reason is governed by the [[principle of contradiction]] and the [[principle of sufficient reason]]. Using the principle of reasoning, Leibniz concluded that the first reason of all things is God.&lt;ref name="Leibniz: A Guide for the Perplexed"/&gt; All that we see and experience are subject to change, and the fact that this world is contingent can be explained by the possibility of the world being arranged differently in space and time. The contingent world must have some necessary reason for its existence. Leibniz uses a geometry book as an example to explain his reasoning. If this book was copied from an infinite chain of copies, there must be a some reason for the content of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perkins|first1=Franklin|title=Leibniz: A Guide for the Perplexed|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=0-8264-8921-4|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz concluded that there must be the "''monas monadum''" or God.

The [[ontology|ontological]] essence of a monad is its irreducible simplicity. Unlike atoms, monads possess no material or spatial character. They also differ from atoms by their complete mutual independence, so that interactions among monads are only apparent. Instead, by virtue of the principle of [[pre-established harmony]], each monad follows a preprogrammed set of "instructions" peculiar to itself, so that a monad "knows" what to do at each moment. By virtue of these intrinsic instructions, each monad is like a little mirror of the universe. Monads need not be "small"; e.g., each human being constitutes a monad, in which case [[free will]] is problematic.

Monads are purported to have gotten rid of the problematic:
* interaction between [[mind]] and matter arising in the system of [[Descartes]];
* lack of [[Principle of individuation|individuation]] inherent to the system of [[Spinoza]], which represents individual creatures as merely accidental.

===Theodicy and optimism===
{{further|Best of all possible worlds|Philosophical optimism}}

The ''[[Théodicée|Theodicy]]''&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford (1998) is a detailed scholarly study of Leibniz's [[theodicy]].&lt;/ref&gt; tries to justify the apparent imperfections of the world by claiming that it is [[Best of all possible worlds|optimal among all possible worlds]]. It must be the best possible and most balanced world, because it was created by an all powerful and all knowing God, who would not choose to create an imperfect world if a better world could be known to him or possible to exist. In effect, apparent flaws that can be identified in this world must exist in every possible world, because otherwise God would have chosen to create the world that excluded those flaws.

Leibniz asserted that the truths of theology (religion) and philosophy cannot contradict each other, since reason and faith are both "gifts of God" so that their conflict would imply God contending against himself. The ''Theodicy'' is Leibniz's attempt to reconcile his personal philosophical system with his interpretation of the tenets of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Magill, Frank (ed.). ''Masterpieces of World Philosophy''. New York: Harper Collins (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; This project was motivated in part by Leibniz's belief, shared by many conservative philosophers and theologians during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], in the rational and enlightened nature of the Christian religion as compared to its purportedly less advanced non-Western counterparts. It was also shaped by Leibniz's belief in the perfectibility of human nature (if humanity relied on correct philosophy and religion as a guide), and by his belief that metaphysical necessity must have a rational or logical foundation, even if this metaphysical causality seemed inexplicable in terms of physical necessity (the natural laws identified by science).

Because reason and faith must be entirely reconciled, any tenet of faith which could not be defended by reason must be rejected. Leibniz then approached one of the central criticisms of Christian theism:&lt;ref&gt;Magill, Frank (ed.) (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; if God is [[Omnibenevolent|all good]], [[Omniscience|all wise]] and [[Omnipotent|all powerful]], how did [[Problem of evil|evil come into the world]]? The answer (according to Leibniz) is that, while God is indeed unlimited in wisdom and power, his human creations, as creations, are limited both in their wisdom and in their will (power to act). This predisposes humans to false beliefs, wrong decisions and ineffective actions in the exercise of their [[free will]]. God does not arbitrarily inflict pain and suffering on humans; rather he permits both ''moral evil'' (sin) and ''physical evil'' (pain and suffering) as the necessary consequences of ''metaphysical evil'' (imperfection), as a means by which humans can identify and correct their erroneous decisions, and as a contrast to true good.

Further, although human actions flow from prior causes that ultimately arise in God, and therefore are known as a metaphysical certainty to God, an individual's free will is exercised within natural laws, where choices are merely contingently necessary, to be decided in the event by a "wonderful spontaneity" that provides individuals an escape from rigorous predestination.

=== ''Discourse on Metaphysics'' ===
For Leibniz, "God is an absolutely perfect being." He describes this perfection later in section VI as the simplest form of something with the most substantial outcome (VI). Along these lines, he declares that every type of perfection "pertains to him (God) in the highest degree" (I). Even though his types of perfections are not specifically drawn out, Leibniz highlights the one thing that, to him, does certify imperfections and proves that God is perfect: "that one acts imperfectly if he acts with less perfection than he is capable of", and since God is a perfect being, he cannot act imperfectly (III). Because God cannot act imperfectly, the decisions he makes pertaining to the world must be perfect. Leibniz also comforts readers, stating that because he has done everything to the most perfect degree; those who love him cannot be injured. However, to love God is a subject of difficulty as Leibniz believes that we are "not disposed to wish for that which God desires" because we have the ability to alter our disposition (IV). In accordance with this, many act as rebels, but Leibniz says that the only way we can truly love God is by being content "with all that comes to us according to his will" (IV).

Because God is "an absolutely perfect being" (I), Leibniz argues that God would be acting imperfectly if he acted with any less perfection than what he is able of (III). His syllogism then ends with the statement that God has made the world perfectly in all ways. This also affects how we should view God and his will. Leibniz states that, in lieu of God’s will, we have to understand that God "is the best of all masters" and he will know when his good succeeds, so we, therefore, must act in conformity to his good will—or as much of it as we understand (IV). In our view of God, Leibniz declares that we cannot admire the work solely because of the maker, lest we mar the glory and love God in doing so. Instead, we must admire the maker for the work he has done (II). Effectively, Leibniz states that if we say the earth is good because of the will of God, and not good according to some standards of goodness, then how can we praise God for what he has done if contrary actions are also praiseworthy by this definition (II). Leibniz then asserts that different principles and geometry cannot simply be from the will of God, but must follow from his understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm.

Leibniz wrote: "[[Problem of why there is anything at all|Why is there something rather than nothing?]] The sufficient reason ... is found in a substance which ... is a necessary being bearing the reason for its existence within itself."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Monadology|Monadologie]]'' (1714). [[Nicholas Rescher]], trans., 1991. ''The Monadology: An Edition for Students''. Uni. of Pittsburg Press, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Heidegger]] called this question "the fundamental question of metaphysics".&lt;!--"Warum ist überhaupt Seiendes und nicht vielmehr Nichts?"--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fundamental Question|url=https://www.hedweb.com/witherall/existence.htm|publisher=hedweb.com|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Geier|first1=Manfred|title=Wittgenstein und Heidegger: Die letzten Philosophen|publisher=Rowohlt Verlag|isbn=978-3-644-04511-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JUiFDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP166|accessdate=26 April 2017|language=de|date=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolic thought===
Leibniz believed that much of human reasoning could be reduced to calculations of a sort, and that such calculations could resolve many differences of opinion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The only way to rectify our reasonings is to make them as tangible as those of the Mathematicians, so that we can find our error at a glance, and when there are disputes among persons, we can simply say: Let us calculate [''calculemus''], without further ado, to see who is right.&lt;ref&gt;''The Art of Discovery'' 1685, Wiener 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Leibniz's [[calculus ratiocinator]], which resembles [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], can be viewed as a way of making such calculations feasible. Leibniz wrote memoranda&lt;ref&gt;Many of his memoranda are translated in Parkinson 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; that can now be read as groping attempts to get symbolic logic—and thus his ''calculus''—off the ground. These writings remained unpublished until the appearance of a selection edited by C.I. Gerhardt (1859). L. Couturat published a selection in 1901; by this time the main developments of modern logic had been created by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and by [[Gottlob Frege]].

Leibniz thought [[symbol]]s were important for human understanding. He attached so much importance to the development of good notations that he attributed all his discoveries in mathematics to this. His notation for [[calculus]] is an example of his skill in this regard. Peirce, a 19th-century pioneer of [[semiotics]], shared Leibniz's passion for symbols and notation, and his belief that these are essential to a well-running logic and mathematics.

But Leibniz took his speculations much further. Defining a [[Grapheme|character]] as any written sign, he then defined a "real" character as one that represents an idea directly and not simply as the word embodying the idea. Some real characters, such as the notation of logic, serve only to facilitate reasoning. Many characters well known in his day, including [[Egyptian hieroglyphics]], [[Chinese character]]s, and the symbols of [[astronomy]] and [[chemistry]], he deemed not real.&lt;ref&gt;Loemker, however, who translated some of Leibniz's works into English, said that the symbols of chemistry were real characters, so there is disagreement among Leibniz scholars on this point.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--is this paragraph correct up to this point?--&gt; Instead, he proposed the creation of a ''[[characteristica universalis]]'' or "universal characteristic", built on an [[alphabet of human thought]] in which each fundamental concept would be represented by a unique "real" character:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is obvious that if we could find characters or signs suited for expressing all our thoughts as clearly and as exactly as arithmetic expresses numbers or geometry expresses lines, we could do in all matters ''insofar as they are subject to reasoning'' all that we can do in arithmetic and geometry. For all investigations which depend on reasoning would be carried out by transposing these characters and by a species of calculus.&lt;ref&gt;''Preface to the General Science'', 1677. Revision of Rutherford's translation in Jolley 1995: 234. Also Wiener I.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Complex thoughts would be represented by combining characters for simpler thoughts. Leibniz saw that the uniqueness of [[prime factorization]] suggests a central role for [[prime numbers]] in the universal characteristic, a striking anticipation of [[Gödel numbering]]. Granted, there is no intuitive or [[mnemonic]] way to number any set of elementary concepts using the prime numbers. 

Because Leibniz was a mathematical novice when he first wrote about the ''characteristic'', at first he did not conceive it as an [[algebra]] but rather as a [[universal characteristic|universal language]] or script. Only in 1676 did he conceive of a kind of "algebra of thought", modeled on and including conventional algebra and its notation. The resulting ''characteristic'' included a logical calculus, some combinatorics, algebra, his ''analysis situs'' (geometry of situation), a universal concept language, and more. What Leibniz actually intended by his ''characteristica universalis'' and calculus ratiocinator, and the extent to which modern formal logic does justice to calculus, may never be established.&lt;ref&gt;A good introductory discussion of the "characteristic" is Jolley (1995: 226–240). An early, yet still classic, discussion of the "characteristic" and "calculus" is Couturat (1901: chpts. 3, 4).&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz's idea of reasoning through a universal language of symbols and calculations remarkably foreshadows great 20th-century developments in formal systems, such as [[Turing completeness]], where computation was used to define equivalent universal languages (see [[Turing degree]]).

===Formal logic===
{{Main|Algebraic logic}}
Leibniz has been noted as one of the most important logicians between the times of Aristotle and [[Gottlob Frege]].&lt;ref&gt;Lenzen, W., 2004, "Leibniz's Logic," in ''Handbook of the History of Logic'' by D. M. Gabbay/J. Woods (eds.), volume 3: ''The Rise of Modern Logic: From Leibniz to Frege'', Amsterdam et al.: Elsevier-North-Holland, pp. 1–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz enunciated the principal properties of what we now call [[logical conjunction|conjunction]], [[disjunction]], [[negation]], [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]], set [[subset|inclusion]], and the [[empty set]]. The principles of Leibniz's logic and, arguably, of his whole philosophy, reduce to two:

# All our ideas are compounded from a very small number of simple ideas, which form the [[alphabet of human thought]].
# Complex ideas proceed from these simple ideas by a uniform and symmetrical combination, analogous to arithmetical multiplication.

The formal logic that emerged early in the 20th century also requires, at minimum, unary negation and [[Quantification (logic)|quantified]] [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] ranging over some [[universe of discourse]].

Leibniz published nothing on formal logic in his lifetime; most of what he wrote on the subject consists of working drafts. In his book ''[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|History of Western Philosophy]]'', [[Bertrand Russell]] went so far as to claim that Leibniz had developed logic in his unpublished writings to a level which was reached only 200 years later.

Russell's principal work on Leibniz found that many of Leibniz's most startling  philosophical ideas and claims (e.g., that each of the fundamental [[Monad (philosophy)|monads]] mirrors the whole universe) follow logically from Leibniz's conscious choice to reject ''relations'' between things as unreal. He regarded such relations as (real) ''qualities'' of things (Leibniz admitted [[unary function|unary]] [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] only): For him "Mary is the mother of John" describes separate qualities of Mary and of John. This view contrasts with the relational logic of [[Augustus de Morgan|De Morgan]], [[Charles S. Peirce|Peirce]], [[Ernst Schröder|Schröder]] and Russell himself, now standard in [[predicate logic]]. Notably, Leibniz also declared space and time to be inherently relational.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Critical Exposition of the Philosophy of Leibniz|publisher=The University Press, Cambridge|date=1900|first=Bertrand|last=Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematician==
Although the mathematical notion of [[Function (mathematics)|function]] was implicit in trigonometric and logarithmic tables, which existed in his day, Leibniz was the first, in 1692 and 1694, to employ it explicitly, to denote any of several geometric concepts derived from a curve, such as [[abscissa]], [[ordinate]], [[tangent]], [[chord (geometry)|chord]], and the [[Normal (geometry)|perpendicular]].&lt;ref&gt;Struik (1969), 367&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century, "function" lost these geometrical associations. Leibniz also believed that the sum of an infinite number of zeros would equal to one half using the analogy of the creation of the world from nothing.&lt;ref name="Springer, Cham"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Agarwal|first1=Ravi P|last2=Sen|first2=Syamal K|title=Creators of Mathematical and Computational Sciences|date=2014|publisher=Springer, Cham|isbn=978-3-319-10870-4|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz was also one of the pioneers in [[actuarial science]], calculating the purchase price of life annuities and the liquidation of a state's debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leader|first1=editor, Timothy Gowers ; associate editors, June Barrow-Green, Imre|title=The Princeton Companion to Mathematics|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-691-11880-2|page=745}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz's discoveries of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] and of [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], also relevant to mathematics, are discussed in the preceding section. The best overview of Leibniz's writings on calculus may be found in Bos (1974).&lt;ref name="Douglas M. Jesseph, 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jesseph|first=Douglas M.|title=Leibniz on the Foundations of the Calculus: The Question of the Reality of Infinitesimal Magnitudes|journal=[[Perspectives on Science]]|year=1998|volume=6.1&amp;2|pages=6–40|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/perspectives_on_science/v006/6.1jesseph.html|accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linear systems===
Leibniz arranged the coefficients of a system of [[linear equation]]s into an array, now called a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], in order to find a solution to the system if it existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Matthew L.|title=The Good Life in the Scientific Revolution: Descartes, Pascal, Leibniz, and the Cultivation of Virtue|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-40955-4|pages=237–239}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method was later called [[Gaussian elimination]]. Leibniz laid down the foundations and theory of [[determinants]], although [[Seki Kowa]] discovered determinants well before Leibniz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Agarwal|first1=Ravi P|last2=Sen|first2=Syamal K|title=Creators of Mathematical and Computational Sciences|date=2014|publisher=Springer, Cham|isbn=978-3-319-10870-4|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Princeton University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leader|first1=editor, Timothy Gowers ; associate editors, June Barrow-Green, Imre|title=The Princeton Companion to Mathematics|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-691-11880-2|page=744}}&lt;/ref&gt; His works show calculating the determinants using cofactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knobloch|first1=Eberhard|title=Leibniz’s Theory of Elimination and Determinants|date=13 March 2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-4-431-54272-8|pages=230–237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calculating the determinant using cofactors is named the [[Leibniz formula for determinants|Leibniz formula]].  Finding the determinant of a matrix using this method proves impractical with large ''n'', requiring to calculate ''n!'' products and the number of n-permutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Concise Dictionary of Mathematics|publisher=V&amp;S Publishers|isbn=978-93-81588-83-3|pages=113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also solved systems of linear equations using determinants, which is now called [[Cramer's rule]]. This method for solving systems of linear equations based on determinants was found in 1684 by Leibniz (Cramer published his findings in 1750).&lt;ref name="Princeton University Press"/&gt; Although Gaussian elimination requires &lt;math&gt;O(n^3)&lt;/math&gt; arithmetic operations, linear algebra textbooks still teach cofactor expansion before [[LU factorization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lay|first1=David C.|title=Linear algebra and its applications|date=2012|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-321-38517-8|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=(ed.)|first1=Takeshi Tokuyama|title=Algorithms and Computation: 18th International Symposium, ISAAC 2007, Sendai, Japan, December 17–19, 2007 : proceedings|date=2007|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin [etc.]|isbn=978-3-540-77120-3|page=599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geometry===
The [[Leibniz formula for π|Leibniz formula for {{pi}}]] states that
:&lt;math&gt;1 \,-\, \frac{1}{3} \,+\, \frac{1}{5} \,-\, \frac{1}{7} \,+\, \cdots \,=\, \frac{\pi}{4}.&lt;/math&gt;
Leibniz wrote that circles "can most simply be expressed by this series, that is, the aggregate of fractions alternately added and subtracted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Matthew L.|title=The Good Life in the Scientific Revolution : Descartes, Pascal, Leibniz, and the Cultivation of Virtue|date=2006|publisher=Univ. of Chicago Press|location=Chicago [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-226-40954-2|page=169|edition=[Online-Ausg.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this formula is only accurate with a large number of terms, using 10,000,000 terms to obtain the correct value of {{sfrac|{{pi}}|4}} to 8 decimal places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Martin|title=The Universal Computer : The Road from Leibniz to Turing, Third Edition|date=2018-02-28|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-138-50208-6|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz attempted to create a definition for a straight line while attempting to prove the [[parallel postulate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Risi|first1=Vincenzo|title=Leibniz on the Parallel Postulate and the Foundations of Geometry|date=2016|isbn=978-3-319-19863-7|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most mathematicians defined a straight line as the shortest line between two points, Leibniz believed that this was merely a property of a straight line rather than the definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Risi|first1=Vincenzo|title=Leibniz on the Parallel Postulate and the Foundations of Geometry|publisher=Birkhäuser, Cham|isbn=3-319-19862-9|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calculus===
Leibniz is credited, along with Sir [[Isaac Newton]], with the discovery of [[calculus]] (differential and integral calculus). According to Leibniz's notebooks, a critical breakthrough occurred on 11 November 1675, when he employed integral calculus for the first time to find the area under the graph of a function {{math|1={{var|y}} = {{var|f}}({{var|x}})}}.&lt;ref name="Leibniz1920"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leibniz|first1=Gottfried Wilhelm Freiherr von|last2=Gerhardt|first2=Carl Immanuel (trans.)|title=The Early Mathematical Manuscripts of Leibniz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QG_QAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA93|accessdate=10 November 2013|year=1920|publisher=Open Court Publishing|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced several notations used to this day, for instance the [[integral sign]] {{math|∫}}, representing an elongated S, from the Latin word ''summa'', and the {{math|d}} used for [[Differential (infinitesimal)|differentials]], from the Latin word ''differentia''. Leibniz did not publish anything about his calculus until 1684.&lt;ref&gt;For an English translation of this paper, see Struik (1969: 271–284), who also translates parts of two other key papers by Leibniz on calculus.&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz expressed the inverse relation of integration and differentiation, later called the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]], by means of a figure&lt;ref&gt;[[Dirk Jan Struik]], ''A Source Book in Mathematics'' (1969) pp.&amp;nbsp;282–284&lt;/ref&gt; in his 1693 paper ''Supplementum geometriae dimensoriae...''.&lt;ref&gt;''Supplementum geometriae dimensoriae, seu generalissima omnium tetragonismorum effectio per motum: similiterque multiplex constructio lineae ex data tangentium conditione'', ''Acta Euriditorum'' (Sep. 1693) pp. 385–392&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]] is credited for the theorem's discovery in geometric form, [[Isaac Barrow]] proved a more generalized geometric version, and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] developed supporting theory. The concept became more transparent as developed through Leibniz's formalism and new notation.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Stillwell]], ''Mathematics and its History'' (1989, 2002) p.159&lt;/ref&gt; The [[product rule]] of [[differential calculus]] is still called "Leibniz's law". In addition, the theorem that tells how and when to differentiate under the integral sign is called the [[Leibniz integral rule]].

Leibniz exploited [[infinitesimal]]s in developing calculus, manipulating them in ways suggesting that they had [[paradox]]ical [[algebra]]ic properties. [[George Berkeley]], in a tract called ''[[The Analyst]]'' and also in ''De Motu'', criticized these. A recent study argues that Leibnizian calculus was free of contradictions, and was better grounded than Berkeley's empiricist criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

From 1711 until his death, Leibniz was engaged in a dispute with John Keill, Newton and others, over whether Leibniz had invented calculus independently of Newton. This subject is treated at length in the article [[Leibniz–Newton calculus controversy]].

The use of infinitesimals in mathematics was frowned upon by followers of [[Karl Weierstrass]],{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} but survived in science and engineering, and even in rigorous mathematics, via the fundamental computational device known as the [[Differential (infinitesimal)|differential]]. Beginning in 1960, [[Abraham Robinson]] worked out a rigorous foundation for Leibniz's infinitesimals, using [[model theory]], in the context of a field of [[hyperreal number]]s. The resulting [[non-standard analysis]] can be seen as a belated vindication of Leibniz's mathematical reasoning. Robinson's [[transfer principle]] is a mathematical implementation of Leibniz's heuristic [[law of continuity]], while the [[standard part function]] implements the Leibnizian [[transcendental law of homogeneity]].

===Topology===
Leibniz was the first to use the term ''analysis situs'',&lt;ref&gt;Loemker §27&lt;/ref&gt; later used in the 19th century to refer to what is now known as [[topology]]. There are two takes on this situation. On the one hand, Mates, citing a 1954 paper in German by [[Jacob Freudenthal]], argues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although for Leibniz the situs of a sequence of points is completely determined by the distance between them and is altered if those distances are altered, his admirer [[Euler]], in the famous 1736 paper solving the [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg|Königsberg Bridge Problem]] and its generalizations, used the term ''geometria situs'' in such a sense that the situs remains unchanged under topological deformations. He mistakenly credits Leibniz with originating this concept. ... [It] is sometimes not realized that Leibniz used the term in an entirely different sense and hence can hardly be considered the founder of that part of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Mates (1986), 240&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But Hideaki Hirano argues differently, quoting [[Benoit Mandelbrot|Mandelbrot]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.t.hosei.ac.jp/~hhirano/academia/leibniz.htm |title=Leibniz's Cultural Pluralism And Natural Law |last=Hirano |first=Hideaki |accessdate=10 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522130455/http://www.t.hosei.ac.jp/~hhirano/academia/leibniz.htm |archivedate=22 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;To sample Leibniz' scientific works is a sobering experience. Next to calculus, and to other thoughts that have been carried out to completion, the number and variety of premonitory thrusts is overwhelming. We saw examples in "packing",&amp;nbsp;... My Leibniz mania is further reinforced by finding that for one moment its hero attached importance to geometric scaling. In ''Euclidis Prota''&amp;nbsp;..., which is an attempt to tighten Euclid's axioms, he states&amp;nbsp;...: "I have diverse definitions for the straight line. The straight line is a curve, any part of which is similar to the whole, and it alone has this property, not only among curves but among sets." This claim can be proved today.&lt;ref&gt;Mandelbrot (1977), 419. Quoted in Hirano (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus the [[fractal|fractal geometry]] promoted by Mandelbrot drew on Leibniz's notions of [[self-similarity]] and the principle of continuity: ''[[Natura non facit saltus]]''.&lt;ref name="Saltus"/&gt; We also see that when Leibniz wrote, in a metaphysical vein, that "the straight line is a curve, any part of which is similar to the whole", he was anticipating topology by more than two centuries. As for "packing", Leibniz told his friend and correspondent Des Bosses to imagine a circle, then to inscribe within it three congruent circles with maximum radius; the latter smaller circles could be filled with three even smaller circles by the same procedure. This process can be continued infinitely, from which arises a good idea of self-similarity. Leibniz's improvement of Euclid's axiom contains the same concept.

==Scientist and engineer==
Leibniz's writings are currently discussed, not only for their anticipations and possible discoveries not yet recognized, but as ways of advancing present knowledge. Much of his writing on physics is included in Gerhardt's ''Mathematical Writings''.

===Physics===
{{See also|Dynamism (metaphysics)|Conatus#In Leibniz}}
Leibniz contributed a fair amount to the statics and dynamics emerging around him, often disagreeing with [[Descartes]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]. He devised a new theory of [[Motion (physics)|motion]] ([[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]]) based on [[kinetic energy]] and [[potential energy]], which posited space as relative, whereas Newton was thoroughly convinced that space was absolute. An important example of Leibniz's mature physical thinking is his ''Specimen Dynamicum'' of 1695.&lt;ref&gt;Ariew and Garber 117, Loemker §46, W II.5. On Leibniz and physics, see the chapter by Garber in Jolley (1995) and Wilson (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the discovery of subatomic particles and the [[quantum mechanics]] governing them, many of Leibniz's speculative ideas about aspects of nature not reducible to statics and dynamics made little sense. For instance, he anticipated [[Albert Einstein]] by arguing, against Newton, that [[space]], time and motion are relative, not absolute: "As for my own opinion, I have said more than once, that I hold space to be something merely relative, as time is, that I hold it to be an order of coexistences, as time is an order of successions."&lt;ref&gt;See H. G. Alexander, ed., ''The [[Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence]]'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz held a [[Relational theory|relationist]] notion of space and time, against Newton's substantivalist views.&lt;ref&gt;Futch, Michael.  ''Leibniz's Metaphysics of Time and Space''. New York: Springer, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Christopher. ''Time, Space and Philosophy''. London: Routledge, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rickles, Dean. ''Symmetry, Structure and Spacetime''. Oxford: Elsevier, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Newton's substantivalism, space and time are entities in their own right, existing independently of things. Leibniz's relationism, on the other hand, describes [[space and time]] as systems of relations that exist between objects. The rise of [[general relativity]] and subsequent work in the [[history of physics]] has put Leibniz's stance in a more favorable light.

One of Leibniz's projects was to recast Newton's theory as a [[Mechanical explanations of gravitation|vortex theory]].&lt;ref name="Arthur p. 56"&gt;Arthur 2014, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his project went beyond vortex theory, since at its heart there was an attempt to explain one of the most difficult problems in physics, that of the origin of the [[Cohesion (chemistry)|cohesion of matter]].&lt;ref name="Arthur p. 56"/&gt;

The [[principle of sufficient reason]] has been invoked in recent [[cosmology]], and his [[identity of indiscernibles]] in quantum mechanics, a field some even credit him with having anticipated in some sense. Those who advocate [[digital philosophy]], a recent direction in cosmology, claim Leibniz as a precursor. In addition to his theories about the nature of reality, Leibniz's contributions to the development of calculus have also had a major impact on physics.

====The ''vis viva''====
Leibniz's ''[[vis viva]]'' (Latin for "living force") is {{math|{{var|m}}{{var|v}}{{sup|2}}}}, twice the modern [[kinetic energy]]. He realized that the total energy would be conserved in certain mechanical systems, so he considered it an innate motive characteristic of matter.&lt;ref&gt;See Ariew and Garber 155–86, Loemker §§53–55, W II.6–7a&lt;/ref&gt; Here too his thinking gave rise to another regrettable nationalistic dispute. His ''vis viva'' was seen as rivaling the [[conservation of momentum]] championed by Newton in England and by [[Descartes]] in France; hence [[academics]] in those countries tended to neglect Leibniz's idea. In reality, both energy and [[momentum]] are conserved, so the two approaches are equally valid.

===Other natural science===
By proposing that the earth has a molten core, he anticipated modern geology. In [[embryology]], he was a preformationist, but also proposed that organisms are the outcome of a combination of an infinite number of possible microstructures and of their powers. In the [[life sciences]] and [[paleontology]], he revealed an amazing transformist intuition, fueled by his study of comparative anatomy and fossils. One of his principal works on this subject, ''[[Protogaea]]'', unpublished in his lifetime, has recently been published in English for the first time. He worked out a primal [[organismic theory]].&lt;ref&gt;On Leibniz and biology, see Loemker (1969a: VIII).&lt;/ref&gt; In medicine, he exhorted the physicians of his time—with some results—to ground their theories in detailed comparative observations and verified experiments, and to distinguish firmly scientific and metaphysical points of view.

===Psychology===
Psychology had been a central interest of Leibniz.&lt;ref&gt;L. E. Loemker: ''Introduction to Philosophical papers and letters: A selection.'' Gottfried W. Leibniz (transl. and ed., by Leroy E. Loemker). Dordrecht: Riedel (2nd ed. 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Verhave: ''Contributions to the history of psychology: III. G. W. Leibniz (1646–1716)''. ''On the Association of Ideas and Learning''. ''Psychological Report'', 1967, Vol. 20, 11–116.&lt;/ref&gt; He appears to be an "underappreciated pioneer of psychology" &lt;ref&gt;R. E. Fancher &amp; H. Schmidt: Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz: ''Underappreciated pioneer of psychology''. In: G. A. Kimble &amp; M. Wertheimer (Eds.). ''Portraits of pioneers in psychology'', Vol. V. American Psychological Association, Washington, DC, 2003, pp. 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote on topics which are now regarded as fields of psychology: [[attention]] and [[consciousness]], [[memory]], [[learning]] ([[Association (psychology)|association]]), [[motivation]] (the act of "striving"), emergent [[individuality]], the general dynamics of development ([[evolutionary psychology]]){{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}. His discussions in the ''New Essays'' and ''Monadology'' often rely on everyday observations such as the behaviour of a dog or the noise of the sea, and he develops intuitive analogies (the synchronous running of clocks or the balance spring of a clock). He also devised postulates and principles that apply to psychology: the continuum of the unnoticed ''petite perceptions'' to the distinct, self-aware [[apperception]], and [[psychophysical parallelism]] from the point of view of causality and of purpose:  “Souls act according to the laws of final causes, through aspirations, ends and means. Bodies act according to the laws of efficient causes, i.e. the laws of motion. And these two realms, that of efficient causes and that of final causes, harmonize with one another.” &lt;ref&gt;Leibniz, G. W. (1714/1720). ''The Principles of Philosophy known as Monadology'' (transl. by Jonathan Bennett, 2007). http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/leibniz p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; This idea refers to the mind-body problem, stating that the mind and brain do not act upon each other, but act alongside each other separately but in harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Larry M. Jorgensen, The Principle of Continuity and Leibniz's Theory of Consciousness.&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz, however, did not use the term ''psychologia''.&lt;ref&gt;The German scholar Johann Thomas Freigius was the first to use this Latin term 1574 in print: ''Quaestiones logicae et ethicae'', Basel, Henricpetri).&lt;/ref&gt;
Leibniz’ epistemological position—against [[John Locke]] and English [[empiricism]] ([[sensualism]])—was made clear: “Nihil est in intellectu quod non fuerit in sensu, nisi intellectu ipse.” – “Nothing is in the intellect that was not first in the senses, except the intellect itself.” &lt;ref&gt;Leibniz, Nouveaux essais, 1765, Livre II, Des Idées, Chapitre 1, § 6. ''New Essays on Human Understanding'' Book 2. p. 36; transl. by Jonathan Bennett, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Principles that are not present in sensory impressions can be recognised in human perception and consciousness: logical inferences, categories of thought, the principle of [[causality]] and the principle of [[purpose]] ([[teleology]]). 
 
Leibniz found his most important interpreter in [[Wilhelm Wundt]], founder of psychology as a discipline. Wundt used the "… nisi intellectu ipse" quotation 1862 on the title page of his ''Beiträge zur Theorie der Sinneswahrnehmung'' (Contributions on the Theory of Sensory Perception) and published a detailed and aspiring monograph on Leibniz&lt;ref&gt;Wundt: ''Leibniz zu seinem zweihundertjährigen Todestag, 14. November 1916.'' Alfred Kröner Verlag, Leipzig 1917.&lt;/ref&gt; Wundt shaped the term [[apperception]], introduced by Leibniz, into an experimental psychologically based apperception psychology that included neuropsychological modelling – an excellent example of how a concept created by a great philosopher could stimulate a psychological research program. One principle in the thinking of Leibniz played a fundamental role: “the principle of equality of separate but corresponding viewpoints.” Wundt characterized this style of thought ([[perspectivism]]) in a way that also applied for him—viewpoints that "supplement one another, while also being able to appear as opposites that only resolve themselves when considered more deeply."&lt;ref&gt;Wundt (1917), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fahrenberg, J. (2017) ''The influence of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz on the Psychology, philosophy, and Ethics of Wilhelm Wundt'' PsyDok ZPID [http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11780/3772.].&lt;/ref&gt;    
Much of Leibniz's work went on to have a great impact on the field of psychology.&lt;ref&gt;D. Brett King, Wayne Viney and William Woody. ''A History of Psychology: Ideas and Context'' (2009), 150–153.&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz thought that there are many petites perceptions, or small perceptions of which we perceive but of which we are unaware. He believed that by the principle that phenomena found in nature were continuous by default, it was likely that the transition between conscious and unconscious states had intermediary steps.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls and Leibscher ''Thinking the Unconscious: Nineteenth-Century German Thought'' (2010), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  For this to be true, there must also be a portion of the mind of which we are unaware at any given time. His theory regarding consciousness in relation to the principle of continuity can be seen as an early theory regarding the [[stages of sleep]]. In this way, Leibniz's theory of perception can be viewed as one of many theories leading up to the idea of the [[The unconscious|unconscious]]. Leibniz was a direct influence on [[Ernst Platner]], who is credited with originally coining the term Unbewußtseyn (unconscious).&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls and Leibscher (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the idea of [[subliminal stimuli]] can be traced back to his theory of small perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;King et al. (2009), 150–153.&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz's ideas regarding music and tonal perception went on to influence the laboratory studies of Wilhelm Wundt.&lt;ref&gt;Klempe SH (2011). "''The role of tone sensation and musical stimuli in early experimental psychology''". ''Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences''. 47 (2): 187–199. {{PMID|21462196}}. doi:10.1002/jhbs.20495.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social science===
In public health, he advocated establishing a medical administrative authority, with powers over [[epidemiology]] and [[veterinary medicine]]. He worked to set up a coherent medical training program, oriented towards public health and preventive measures. In economic policy, he proposed tax reforms and a national insurance program, and discussed the [[balance of trade]]. He even proposed something akin to what much later emerged as [[game theory]]. In sociology he laid the ground for [[communication theory]].

===Technology===
In 1906, Garland published a volume of Leibniz's writings bearing on his many practical inventions and engineering work. To date, few of these writings have been translated into English. Nevertheless, it is well understood that Leibniz was a serious inventor, engineer, and applied scientist, with great respect for practical life. Following the motto ''theoria cum praxi'', he urged that theory be combined with practical application, and thus has been claimed as the father of [[applied science]]. He designed wind-driven propellers and water pumps, mining machines to extract ore, hydraulic presses, lamps, submarines, clocks, etc. With [[Denis Papin]], he invented a [[steam engine]]. He even proposed a method for desalinating water. From 1680 to 1685, he struggled to overcome the chronic flooding that afflicted the ducal silver mines in the [[Harz Mountains]], but did not succeed.&lt;ref&gt;Aiton (1985), 107–114, 136&lt;/ref&gt;

====Computation====
Leibniz may have been the first computer scientist and information theorist.&lt;ref&gt;Davis (2000) discusses Leibniz's prophetic role in the emergence of calculating machines and of formal languages.&lt;/ref&gt; Early in life, he documented the [[binary numeral system]] ([[radix|base]] 2), then revisited that system throughout his career.&lt;ref&gt;See Couturat (1901): 473–478.&lt;/ref&gt; While Leibniz was examining other cultures to compare his metaphysical views, he encountered an ancient Chinese book ''[[I Ching]]''. Leibniz interpreted a diagram which showed yin and yang and corresponded it to a zero and one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryan|first1=James|title=Leibniz' Binary System and Shao Yong's "Yijing"|journal=University of Hawaii Press|pages=59–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; More information can be found in the [[#Sinophile |Sinophile]] section. Leibniz may have plagiarized [[Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz]] and [[Thomas Harriot]], who independently developed the binary system,  as he was familiar with their works on the binary system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ares|first=J.|last2=Lara|first2=J.|last3=Lizcano|first3=D.|last4=Martínez|first4=M.|date=2017|title=Who Discovered the Binary System and Arithmetic?

His [[calculus ratiocinator]] anticipated aspects of the [[universal Turing machine]]. In 1961, [[Norbert Wiener]] suggested that Leibniz should be considered the patron saint of [[cybernetics]].&lt;ref&gt;Wiener, N., ''Cybernetics'' (2nd edition with revisions and two additional chapters), The MIT Press and Wiley, New York, 1961, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1671, Leibniz began to invent a machine that could execute all four arithmetic operations, gradually improving it over a number of years. This "[[stepped reckoner]]" attracted fair attention and was the basis of his election to the [[Royal Society]] in 1673. A number of such machines were made during his years in [[Hanover]] by a craftsman working under his supervision. They were not an unambiguous success because they did not fully mechanize the [[Carry (arithmetic)|carry operation]]. Couturat reported finding an unpublished note by Leibniz, dated 1674, describing a machine capable of performing some algebraic operations.&lt;ref&gt;Couturat (1901), 115&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz also devised a (now reproduced) cipher machine, recovered by [[Nicholas Rescher]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;See N. Rescher, ''Leibniz and Cryptography'' (Pittsburgh, University Library Systems, University of Pittsburgh, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1693, Leibniz described a design of a machine which could, in theory, integrate differential equations, which he called "integraph".&lt;ref&gt;[http://amatterofmind.org/Pierres_PDFs/TRANSLATIONS/4._GOTTFRIED_LEIBNIZ_SELECTIONS_FROM_ACTA_ERUDITORUM.pdf  "The discoveries of principle of the calculus in Acta Eruditorum"] (commentary, pp. 60–61), translated by Pierre Beaudry, amatterofmind.org, Leesburg, Va., September 2000. (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz was groping towards hardware and software concepts worked out much later by [[Charles Babbage]] and [[Ada Lovelace]]. In 1679, while mulling over his binary arithmetic, Leibniz imagined a machine in which binary numbers were represented by marbles, governed by a rudimentary sort of punched cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/discourse/schirrmacher_eurotech.html|title=The Reality Club: Wake Up Call for Europe Tech|website=www.edge.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Agarwal|first1=Ravi P|last2=Sen|first2=Syamal K|title=Creators of Mathematical and Computational Sciences|date=2014|publisher=Springer, Cham|isbn=978-3-319-10870-4|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern electronic digital computers replace Leibniz's marbles moving by gravity with shift registers, voltage gradients, and pulses of electrons, but otherwise they run roughly as Leibniz envisioned in 1679.

===Librarian===
Later in Leibniz’s career (after the death of von Boinburg), Leibniz moved to Paris and accepted a position as a librarian in the Hanoverian court of Johann Friedrich, Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg. Leibniz’s predecessor, Tobias Fleischer, had already created a cataloging system for the Duke’s library but it was a clumsy attempt. At this library, Leibniz focused more on advancing the library than on the cataloging. For instance, within a month of taking the new position, he developed a comprehensive plan to expand the library. He was one of the first to consider developing a core collection for a library and felt “that a library for display and ostentation is a luxury and indeed superfluous, but a well-stocked and organized library is important and useful for all areas of human endeavor and is to be regarded on the same level as schools and churches”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Schulte-Albert, H. (1971). Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Library Classification. The Journal of Library History (1966–1972), 6(2), 133–152. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/25540286&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, Leibniz lacked the funds to develop the library in this manner. After working at this library, by the end of 1690 Leibnez was appointed as privy-councilor and librarian of the Bibliotheca Augusta at Wolfenbuettel. It was an extensive library with at least 25,946 printed volumes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At this library, Leibniz sought to improve the catalog. He was not allowed to make complete changes to the existing closed catalog, but was allowed to improve upon it so he started on that task immediately. He created an alphabetical author catalog and had also created other cataloging methods that were not implemented. While serving as librarian of the ducal libraries in [[Hanover]] and [[Wolfenbuettel]], Leibniz effectively became one of the founders of [[library science]]. He also designed a book [[library classification|indexing system]] in ignorance of the only other such system then extant, that of the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford University]]. He also called on publishers to distribute abstracts of all new titles they produced each year, in a standard form that would facilitate indexing. He hoped that this abstracting project would eventually include everything printed from his day back to [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]. Neither proposal met with success at the time, but something like them became standard practice among English language publishers during the 20th century, under the aegis of the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[British Library]].

He called for the creation of an [[empirical]] [[database]] as a way to further all sciences. His ''[[characteristica universalis]]'', [[calculus ratiocinator]], and a "community of minds"—intended, among other things, to bring political and religious unity to Europe—can be seen as distant unwitting anticipations of artificial languages (e.g., [[Esperanto]] and its rivals), [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], even the [[World Wide Web]].

===Advocate of scientific societies===
Leibniz emphasized that research was a collaborative endeavor. Hence he warmly advocated the formation of national scientific societies along the lines of the [[Royal Society|British Royal Society]] and the French Academie Royale des Sciences. More specifically, in his correspondence and travels he urged the creation of such societies in Dresden, [[Saint Petersburg]], Vienna, and Berlin. Only one such project came to fruition; in 1700, the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy of Sciences]] was created. Leibniz drew up its first statutes, and served as its first President for the remainder of his life. That Academy evolved into the German Academy of Sciences, the publisher of the ongoing critical edition of his works.&lt;ref&gt;On Leibniz's projects for scientific societies, see Couturat (1901), App. IV.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawyer and moralist==
With the possible exception of [[Marcus Aurelius]], no philosopher has ever had as much experience with practical affairs of state as Leibniz. Leibniz's writings on law, ethics, and politics&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Ariew and Garber 19, 94, 111, 193; Riley 1988; Loemker §§2, 7, 20, 29, 44, 59, 62, 65; W I.1, IV.1–3&lt;/ref&gt; were long overlooked by English-speaking scholars, but this has changed of late.&lt;ref&gt;See (in order of difficulty) Jolley (2005: chpt. 7), Gregory Brown's chapter in Jolley (1995), Hostler (1975), and Riley (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

While Leibniz was no apologist for [[absolute monarchy]] like [[Hobbes]], or for tyranny in any form, neither did he echo the political and constitutional views of his contemporary [[John Locke]], views invoked in support of liberalism, in 18th-century America and later elsewhere. The following excerpt from a 1695 letter to Baron J. C. Boyneburg's son Philipp is very revealing of Leibniz's political sentiments:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As for&amp;nbsp;... the great question of the power of sovereigns and the obedience their peoples owe them, I usually say that it would be good for princes to be persuaded that their people have the right to resist them, and for the people, on the other hand, to be persuaded to obey them passively. I am, however, quite of the opinion of [[Grotius]], that one ought to obey as a rule, the evil of revolution being greater beyond comparison than the evils causing it. Yet I recognize that a prince can go to such excess, and place the well-being of the state in such danger, that the obligation to endure ceases. This is most rare, however, and the theologian who authorizes violence under this pretext should take care against excess; excess being infinitely more dangerous than deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Loemker: 59, fn 16. Translation revised.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1677, Leibniz called for a European confederation, governed by a council or senate, whose members would represent entire nations and would be free to vote their consciences;&lt;ref&gt;Loemker: 58, fn 9&lt;/ref&gt; this is sometimes considered an anticipation of the [[European Union]]. He believed that Europe would adopt a uniform religion. He reiterated these proposals in 1715.

But at the same time, he arrived to propose an interreligious and multicultural project to create a universal system of justice, which required from him a broad interdisciplinary perspective. In order to propose it, he combined linguistics, especially sinology, moral and law philosophy, management, economics, and politics.&lt;ref&gt;See José Andrés-Gallego: 42. “Are Humanism and Mixed Methods Related? Leibniz’s Universal (Chinese) Dream”: Journal of Mixed Methods Research, 29(2) (2015): 118–132: http://mmr.sagepub.com/content/9/2/118.abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecumenism===
Leibniz devoted considerable intellectual and diplomatic effort to what would now be called [[ecumenism|ecumenical]] endeavor, seeking to reconcile first the [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Lutheran]] churches, and later the Lutheran and [[Reformed]] churches. In this respect, he followed the example of his early patrons, Baron von Boyneburg and the Duke [[John Frederick, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|John Frederick]]—both cradle Lutherans who converted to Catholicism as adults—who did what they could to encourage the reunion of the two faiths, and who warmly welcomed such endeavors by others. (The House of [[Brunswick-Lüneburg|Brunswick]] remained Lutheran because the Duke's children did not follow their father.) These efforts included corresponding with the French bishop [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet]], and involved Leibniz in some theological controversy. He evidently thought that the thoroughgoing application of reason would suffice to heal the breach caused by the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].

==Philologist==
Leibniz the [[philologist]] was an avid student of languages, eagerly latching on to any information about vocabulary and grammar that came his way. He refuted the belief, widely held by Christian scholars in his day, that [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] was the primeval language of the human race. He also refuted the argument, advanced by Swedish scholars in his day, that a form of proto-[[Swedish language|Swedish]] was the ancestor of the [[Germanic languages]]. He puzzled over the origins of the [[Slavic languages]] and was fascinated by [[classical Chinese]]. Leibniz was also an expert in the [[Sanskrit]] language.&lt;ref name="Springer, Cham"/&gt;

He published the ''princeps editio'' (first modern edition) of the [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval]] ''[[Chronicon Holtzatiae]]'', a Latin chronicle of the [[County of Holstein]].

==Sinophile==
[[File:Diagram of I Ching hexagrams owned by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, 1701.jpg|thumb|right|A diagram of ''[[I Ching]]'' hexagrams sent to Leibniz from [[Joachim Bouvet]]. The Arabic numerals were added by Leibniz.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins (2004), 117&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Leibniz was perhaps the first major European intellectual to take a close interest in Chinese civilization, which he knew by corresponding with, and reading other works by, European Christian missionaries posted in China. Having read ''[[Confucius]] Sinarum Philosophus'' on the first year of its publication,&lt;ref name="Mungello"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mungello|first1=David E. |year= 1971|title=Leibniz's Interpretation of Neo-Confucianism|journal=Philosophy East and West|volume=21|issue=1|pages=3–22 |doi=10.2307/1397760|jstor=1397760 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he concluded that Europeans could learn much from the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] ethical tradition. He mulled over the possibility that the [[Chinese character]]s were an unwitting form of his [[Characteristica universalis|universal characteristic]]. He noted with fascination how the ''[[I Ching]]'' hexagrams correspond to the [[binary numbers]] from 000000 to 111111, and concluded that this mapping was evidence of major Chinese accomplishments in the sort of philosophical mathematics he admired.&lt;ref&gt;On Leibniz, the ''I Ching'', and binary numbers, see Aiton (1985: 245–248). Leibniz's writings on Chinese civilization are collected and translated in Cook and Rosemont (1994), and discussed in Perkins (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz communicated his ideas of the binary system representing Christianity to the Emperor of China hoping it would convert him.&lt;ref name="Springer, Cham"/&gt; Leibniz may be the only major Western philosopher who attempted to accommodate Confucian ideas to prevailing European beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cook|first1=Daniel|title=Leibniz, China, and the Problem of Pagan Wisdom|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/591609|website=Project Muse|publisher=Project Muse|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz's attraction to [[Chinese philosophy]] originates from his perception that Chinese philosophy was similar to his own.&lt;ref name="Mungello"/&gt; The historian E.R. Hughes suggests that Leibniz's ideas of "simple substance" and "pre-established harmony" were directly influenced by [[Confucianism]], pointing to the fact that they were conceived during the period that he was reading ''Confucius Sinarum Philosophus''.&lt;ref name="Mungello"/&gt;

== As polymath ==
While making his grand tour of European archives to research the Brunswick family history that he never completed, Leibniz stopped in [[Vienna]] between May 1688 and February 1689, where he did much legal and diplomatic work for the Brunswicks. He visited mines, talked with mine engineers, and tried to negotiate export contracts for lead from the ducal mines in the [[Harz mountains]]. His proposal that the streets of Vienna be lit with lamps burning [[rapeseed oil]] was implemented. During a formal audience with the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Austrian Emperor]] and in subsequent memoranda, he advocated reorganizing the Austrian economy, reforming the coinage of much of central Europe, negotiating a [[Concordat]] between the [[Habsburg]]s and the [[Holy See|Vatican]], and creating an imperial research library, official archive, and public insurance fund. He wrote and published an important paper on [[mechanics]].

Leibniz also wrote a short paper, ''Primae veritates'', first published by [[Louis Couturat]] in 1903 (pp.&amp;nbsp;518–523)&lt;ref&gt;Later translated as Loemker 267 and Woolhouse and Francks 30&lt;/ref&gt; summarizing his views on [[metaphysics]]. The paper is undated; that he wrote it while in Vienna in 1689 was determined only in 1999, when the ongoing critical edition finally published Leibniz's philosophical writings for the period 1677–90.&lt;ref&gt;A VI, 4, n. 324, pp. 1643–1649 with the title: ''Principia Logico-Metaphysica''&lt;/ref&gt; Couturat's reading of this paper was the launching point for much 20th-century thinking about Leibniz, especially among [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophers]]. But after a meticulous study of all of Leibniz's philosophical writings up to 1688—a study the 1999 additions to the critical edition made possible—Mercer (2001) begged to differ with Couturat's reading; the jury is still out.

==Posthumous reputation==
[[File:Leibnizstrasse street sign Berlin.jpg|thumb|left|Leibnizstrasse street sign Berlin]]

When Leibniz died, his reputation was in decline. He was remembered for only one book, the ''[[Théodicée]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{see also |Irenaean theodicy#Gottfried Leibniz}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose supposed central argument [[Voltaire]] lampooned in his popular book ''[[Candide]]'', which concludes with the character Candide saying, "''[[Non liquet]]''" (it is not clear), a term that was applied during the Roman Republic to a legal verdict of "not proven". Voltaire's depiction of Leibniz's ideas was so influential that many believed it to be an accurate description. Thus Voltaire and his ''Candide'' bear some of the blame for the lingering failure to appreciate and understand Leibniz's ideas. Leibniz had an ardent disciple, [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]], whose dogmatic and facile outlook did Leibniz's reputation much harm. He also influenced [[David Hume]] who read his ''[[Théodicée]]'' and used some of his ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humesociety.org/hs/issues/v19n1/vasilyeu/vasilyeu-v19n1.pdf|title=Vasilyev, 1993|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any event, philosophical fashion was moving away from the rationalism and system building of the 17th century, of which Leibniz had been such an ardent proponent. His work on law, diplomacy, and history was seen as of ephemeral interest. The vastness and richness of his correspondence went unrecognized.

Much of Europe came to doubt that Leibniz had discovered calculus independently of Newton, and hence his whole work in mathematics and physics was neglected. Voltaire, an admirer of Newton, also wrote ''Candide'' at least in part to discredit Leibniz's claim to having discovered calculus and Leibniz's charge that [[Newton's theory of universal gravitation]] was incorrect.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Leibniz's long march to his present glory began with the 1765 publication of the ''Nouveaux Essais'', which [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] read closely. In 1768, [[Louis Dutens]] edited the first multi-volume edition of Leibniz's writings, followed in the 19th century by a number of editions, including those edited by Erdmann, Foucher de Careil, Gerhardt, Gerland, Klopp, and Mollat. Publication of Leibniz's correspondence with notables such as [[Antoine Arnauld]], [[Samuel Clarke]], [[Sophia of Hanover]], and her daughter [[Sophia Charlotte of Hanover]], began.

In 1900, [[Bertrand Russell]] published a critical study of Leibniz's [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 1900&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, [[Louis Couturat]] published an important study of Leibniz, and edited a volume of Leibniz's heretofore unpublished writings, mainly on logic. They made Leibniz somewhat respectable among 20th-century [[analytic philosophy|analytical]] and [[linguistic philosophy|linguistic]] philosophers in the English-speaking world (Leibniz had already been of great influence to many Germans such as [[Bernhard Riemann]]). For example, Leibniz's phrase ''[[salva veritate]]'', meaning interchangeability without loss of or compromising the truth, recurs in [[Willard Quine]]'s writings. Nevertheless, the secondary literature on Leibniz did not really blossom until after World War II. This is especially true of English speaking countries; in Gregory Brown's bibliography fewer than 30 of the English language entries were published before 1946. American Leibniz studies owe much to [[Leroy Loemker]] (1904–1985) through his translations and his interpretive essays in LeClerc (1973).

[[Nicholas Jolley]] has surmised that Leibniz's reputation as a philosopher is now perhaps higher than at any time since he was alive.&lt;ref&gt;Jolley, 217–219&lt;/ref&gt; Analytic and contemporary philosophy continue to invoke his notions of [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]], [[Principle of individuation|individuation]], and [[possible worlds]]. Work in the history of 17th- and 18th-century [[history of ideas|ideas]] has revealed more clearly the 17th-century "Intellectual Revolution" that preceded the better-known [[industrial revolution|Industrial]] and commercial revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries.

In 1985, the German government created the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize|Leibniz Prize]], offering an annual award of 1.55&amp;nbsp;million [[euro]]s for experimental results and 770,000 euros for theoretical ones. It was the worlds largest prize for scientific achievement prior to the [[Fundamental Physics Prize]].

The collection of manuscript papers of Leibniz at the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Bibliothek – Niedersächische Landesbibliothek were inscribed on [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Register]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=mow&gt;{{cite web |title= Letters from and to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz within the collection of manuscript papers of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz |url= http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22464&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100719082140/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D22464%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 19 July 2010 |date= 16 May 2008 |publisher= UNESCO Memory of the World Programme |accessdate= 15 December 2009 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings and edition==
Leibniz mainly wrote in three languages: scholastic [[Latin]], French and German. During his lifetime, he published many pamphlets and scholarly articles, but only two "philosophical" books, the ''Combinatorial Art'' and the ''[[Théodicée]]''. (He published numerous pamphlets, often anonymous, on behalf of the House of [[Brunswick-Lüneburg]], most notably the "De jure suprematum" a major consideration of the nature of [[sovereignty]].) One substantial book appeared posthumously, his ''[[Nouveaux essais sur l'entendement humain]]'', which Leibniz had withheld from publication after the death of [[John Locke]]. Only in 1895, when Bodemann completed his catalogue of Leibniz's manuscripts and correspondence, did the enormous extent of Leibniz's ''[[Nachlass]]'' become clear: about 15,000 letters to more than 1000 recipients plus more than 40,000 other items. Moreover, quite a few of these letters are of essay length. Much of his vast correspondence, especially the letters dated after 1700, remains unpublished, and much of what is published has been so only in recent decades. The amount, variety, and disorder of Leibniz's writings are a predictable result of a situation he described in a letter as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I cannot tell you how extraordinarily distracted and spread out I am. I am trying to find various things in the archives; I look at old papers and hunt up unpublished documents. From these I hope to shed some light on the history of the [House of] Brunswick. I receive and answer a huge number of letters. At the same time, I have so many mathematical results, philosophical thoughts, and other literary innovations that should not be allowed to vanish that I often do not know where to begin.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to [[Vincent Placcius]], 15 September 1695, in [[Louis Dutens]] (ed.), ''Gothofridi Guillemi Leibnitii Opera Omnia'', vol. 6.1, 1768, pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The extant parts of the critical edition&lt;ref name="ce"&gt;[http://www.leibniz-edition.de/ www.leibniz-edition.de]. See photograph there.&lt;/ref&gt; of Leibniz's writings are organized as follows:
* Series 1. ''Political, Historical, and General Correspondence''. 25 vols., 1666–1706.
* Series 2. ''Philosophical Correspondence''. 3 vols., 1663–1700.
* Series 3. ''Mathematical, Scientific, and Technical Correspondence''. 8 vols., 1672–1698.
* Series 4. ''Political Writings''. 7 vols., 1667–99.
* Series 5. ''Historical and Linguistic Writings''. Inactive.
* Series 6. ''Philosophical Writings''. 7 vols., 1663–90, and ''Nouveaux essais sur l'entendement humain''.
* Series 7. ''Mathematical Writings''. 6 vols., 1672–76.
* Series 8. ''Scientific, Medical, and Technical Writings''. 1 vol., 1668–76.

The systematic cataloguing of all of Leibniz's ''Nachlass'' began in 1901. It was hampered by two world wars and decades of German division in two states with the cold war's "iron curtain" in between, separating scholars, and also scattering portions of his literary estates. The ambitious project has had to deal with seven languages contained in some 200,000 pages of written and printed paper. In 1985 it was reorganized and included in a joint program of German federal and state (''Länder'') academies. Since then the branches in [[Potsdam]], [[Münster]], [[Hanover]] and [[Berlin]] have jointly published 57 volumes of the critical edition, with an average of 870 pages, and prepared index and [[Concordance (publishing)|concordance]] works.

=== Leibniz in popular media ===

Leibniz is receiving popular attention. The [[Google Doodle]] for July 1, 2018 celebrated Leibniz's 372nd birthday.&lt;ref&gt;https://g.co/doodle/yf8w5ev{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} accessed 7-1-2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnet.com/news/google-doodle-celebrates-mathematician-gottfried-wilhelm-leibniz/ accessed 7-1-2018&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/kionasmith/2018/06/30/sundays-google-doodle-celebrates-mathematician-gottfried-wilhelm-leibniz/#49745a8e1398 accessed 7-1-2018&lt;/ref&gt; Using a [[quill]], his hand is shown writing "Google" in binary [[ASCII]] code.

One of the earliest popular but indirect exposition of Leibniz was [[Voltaire]]'s satire ''[[Candide]]'', published in 1759. Leibniz was lampooned as Professor Pangloss, described as "the greatest philosopher of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]".

Leibniz also appears as one of the main historical figures in [[Neal Stephenson]]'s series of novels ''[[The Baroque Cycle]]''. Stephenson credits readings and discussions concerning Leibniz for inspiring him to write the series.&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, Neal. "How the Baroque Cycle Began" in P.S. of ''[[Quicksilver (novel)|Quicksilver]]'' Perennial ed. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[geometry]] of [[Hyperbolic space|hyperbolic 4-space]], the '''great 120-cell honeycomb''' is one of four [[regular polytope|regular]] star-[[honeycomb (geometry)|honeycombs]]. With [[Schläfli symbol]] {5,5/2,5,3}, it has three [[great 120-cell]]s around each face. It is [[dual polytope|dual]] to the [[order-5 icosahedral 120-cell honeycomb]].

It can be seen as a [[stellation#Naming stellations|greatening]] of the [[120-cell honeycomb]], and is thus analogous to the three-dimensional [[great dodecahedron]] {5,5/2} and four-dimensional [[great 120-cell]] {5,5/2,5}. It has [[density (polytope)|density]] 10.

'''The history of arithmetic''' includes the period from the emergence of counting before the formal definition of numbers and arithmetic operations over them by means of a system of [[axiom]]s. Arithmetic — the science of numbers, their properties and their relations — is one of the main [[mathematical sciences]]. It is closely connected with [[algebra]] and the [[theory of numbers]].

The practical need for counting, elementary [[measurement]]s and calculations became the reason for the emergence of arithmetic. The first authentic data on arithmetic knowledge are found in the historical monuments of [[Babylon]] and [[Ancient Egypt]] in the third and second millennia BC. The big contribution to the development of arithmetic was made by the [[Greek mathematics|ancient Greek mathematicians]], in particular [[Pythagoreans]], who tried to define all regularities of the world in terms of numbers. In the [[Middle Ages]] trade and approximate calculations were the main scope of arithmetic. Arithmetic developed first of all in [[history of India|India]] and the countries of [[history of Islam|Islam]] and only then came to [[Western Europe]]. In the seventeenth century the needs of [[astronomy]], [[mechanics]], and more difficult commercial calculations put before arithmetic new challenges regarding methods of calculation and gave an impetus to further development.

Theoretical justifications of the idea of number are connected first of all with the definition of "[[natural number]]" and [[Peano's axioms]] formulated in 1889. They were followed by strict definitions of [[rational number|rational]], [[real number|real]], [[negative number|negative]] and [[complex number]]s. Further expansion of the concept of number is possible only if one of the arithmetic laws is rejected.

== The  appearance of arithmetic ==
[[File:Os_d'Ishango_IRSNB.JPG|right|thumb|324x324px|The [[Ishango bone]], found near Lake Edward, possibly displaying a numbering system from more than 20,000 years ago.{{Sfn|Boyer &amp; Merzbach|2010|loc = Concepts and Relationships|name = Boyer_CR}}]]

If in two sets of subjects each element of one set has only one corresponding element in the other set, these sets are one-to-one. Such actual comparison when subjects were displayed in two ranks, was used by primitive tribes in trade. This approach gives the opportunity to establish quantitative ratios between groups of objects and doesn't demand the concept of [[number]].

Further there were natural [[Canon (basic principle)|standards]] for counting, for example, fingers of hands, and then sets of standards, such as hands. The advent of the standards symbolizing concrete numbers also is connected to the emergence of the concept of number. Thus the number of things to be counted was compared to the Moon in the sky, the number of eyes, and the number of fingers on a hand. Later numerous standards were replaced with one of the most convenient, usually fingers of hands and/or feet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4196">'''Irrigation informatics''' is a newly emerging academic field that is a cross-disciplinary science using [[informatics]] to study the information flows and data management related to [[irrigation]]. The field is one of many new informatics sub-specialities that uses the science of information, the practice of information processing, and the engineering of information systems to advance a biophysical science or engineering field.

== Background ==
Agricultural productivity increases are eagerly sought by governments and industry, spurred by the realisation that world food production must double in the 21st century to feed growing populations&lt;ref name="madramootoo1"&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ird.555/pdf], Madramootoo, C.A. and Fyles, H. 2010. Irrigation in the context of today's global food crisis, Irrig. and Drain. 59: 40–52&lt;/ref&gt; and that as irrigation makes up 36% of global food production,&lt;ref name="fao2"&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/x0262e/x0262e01.htm], Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Water and food security, retrieved Sept. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; but that new land for irrigation growth is very limited,&lt;ref name="meyer1"&gt;[http://www.irrigationfutures.org.au/news.asp?catID=10&amp;ID=291], Irrigation Futures CRC media release "Improving irrigated agriculture - how far can we go?", retrieved Sept. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; irrigation efficiency must increase. Since irrigation science is a mature and stable field, irrigation researchers are looking to cross-disciplinary science to bring about production gains and informatics is one such science along with others such as [[social sciences|social science]]. Much of the driver for work in the area of irrigation informatics is the perceived success of other informatics fields such as [[health informatics]].

== Current research ==
Irrigation informatics is very much a part of the wider research into irrigation wherever [[information technology]] or data systems are used, however the term ''informatics'' is not always used to describe research involving computer systems and data management so that ''information science'' or ''information technology'' may alternatively be used. This leads to a great number of irrigation informatics articles not using the term ''irrigation informatics''. There are currently no formal publications (journals) that focus on ''irrigation informatics'' with the publication most likely to present articles on the topic being [http://www.elsevier.com/locate/compag/ Computers and electronics in Agriculture] or one of the many irrigation science journals such as [http://www.springerlink.com/openurl.asp?genre=journal&amp;issn=0342-7188 Irrigation Science].

Recent work in the general area of irrigation informatics has mentioned the exact phrase "Irrigation Informatics" with at least one publication in scientific conference proceedings using it in its title.&lt;ref name="car1"&gt;[http://www.mssanz.org.au/MODSIM07/papers/2_s44/TowardsANewGeneration_s44_Car_.pdf], Car, N. J., Christen, E. W., Hornbuckle, J. W. and Moore, G. 2007. Towards a new generation of Irrigation Decision Support Systems - Irrigation Informatics?. In "MODSIM 2007 International Congress on Modelling and Simulation". Christchurch, New Zealand&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current implementations ==
Meteorological informatics, as with all informatics, are increasingly being used to handle the growing volumes of data that are available from sensors, remote sensing and scientific models. The Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Bureau of Meteorology]] has recently implemented an XML data format, known as the [[Water data transfer format|Water Data Transfer Format]] (WDTF) and standard to be used by Australian government agencies and meteorological data suppliers when delivering data to the Bureau. This format includes specifications for [[evapotranspiration]] and other weather parameters that are useful for irrigation and may be used through implementations of irrigation informatics.

'''István Orosz''' (born 24 October 1951 in [[Kecskemét]]) is a Hungarian painter, printmaker, [[graphic designer]] and animated film director. He is known for his mathematically inspired works, [[impossible objects]], [[optical illusions]], double-meaning images and [[anamorphosis|anamorphoses]]. The geometric art of István Orosz, with forced perspectives and optical illusions, has been compared to works by [[M. C. Escher]].&lt;ref&gt;"Releases - Perception &amp; Deception: The Works of István Orosz" (overview), [[Moravian College]], [[Bethlehem, PA]], December 1998, webpage: [http://www.moravian.edu/news/releases/1998/002.htm MoravianEdu-1998-2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901144422/http://www.moravian.edu/news/releases/1998/002.htm |date=2006-09-01 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Studied at the Hungarian University of Arts and Design (now [[Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design]]) in [[Budapest]] as pupil of István Balogh and [[Ernő Rubik]]. After graduating in 1975 he began to deal with theatre as stage designer and animated film as animator and film director. He is known as [[Painting|painter]], [[printmaker]], [[poster]] [[designer]], and [[illustrator]] as well. He likes to use visual [[paradox]], double meaning images and illusionistic approaches while following traditional printing techniques such as woodcutting and [[etching]]. He also tries to renew the technique of [[anamorphosis]]. He is a regular participant in the major international biennials of posters and graphic art and his works has been shown in individual and group exhibitions in [[Hungary]] and abroad. Film director at the [[PannóniaFilm]] Studio in [[Budapest]], Habil. professor at [[University of West Hungary]] in [[Sopron]], co-founder of [[Hungarian Poster Association]], member of [[Alliance Graphique International]] (AGI) and Hungarian Art Academie. He often uses [[ΟΥΤΙΣ]], or [[Utisz]], (pronounced: outis) (No one) as artist's pseudonym.

==Quotes==
*''"Utisz - It was the Homeric hero Odysseus, who fought the [[Cyclops]], had used this name, and had put out the monster's eye. I imagine that poster is nothing else but an Odysseus' gesture: some kind of attack upon the eye".''
*''"If you want to create a poster try to explain your idea in a sentence. Then try to reduce it, leave out phrases, attributes until you just have the bare essentials. When you do not need any letter at all you are ready with the poster".''
*''"... When I have drawn these impossible objects, I did hope everybody would understand my intention, the intention of a Hungarian designer at the end of the 20th century who does not tell the truth just in order to be caught in the act."'
*''"There are things I can imagine and I can draw. There are things I can imagine but I cannot draw. But, could I draw something that I cannot imagine? That interests me greatly."''

==Introduction by Guy D'Obonner==
During the last two decades - when most of the works shown here were made – the activities of the [[poster]] [[designer]], the [[printmaker]], the [[illustrator]], and the [[film director]] have completed each other. Many motive, stylistic features, technical solutions appeared in all of the media and for Orosz it seemingly did not cause any problem to cross the borders of the different genres. When he was drawing a poster usually he did it with the preciseness of illustrators, when he was illustrating a book, he did it with the narrative mood of filmmakers, if he was animating films, sometimes he used the several layers approach of etchers and engravers and for prints he often chose the emblematic simplifying way of depiction of posters. If we call him only a poster designer based on his functional prints, we narrow down his field of activity, we go closer to the truth if we associate him with „postering" as a way of thinking, or if we call his many sided image depicting ourselves and our age as the poster-mirror of István Orosz.

Edited by Vladislav Rostoka, [[Rabbit &amp; Solution Studio]], [[Bratislava]], 2002, webpage: [http://mek.oszk.hu/01600/01686/html/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poster art==
István Orosz was known as [[poster]] [[designer]] in the first part of his career. He made mainly cultural posters for theatres,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/Medea.jpg Theater poster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070018/http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/Medea.jpg |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  movies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/westside2.jpg Film poster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070519/http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/westside2.jpg |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  galleries,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/chicago.jpg Exhibition poster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927071804/http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/chicago.jpg |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  museums&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/shakespeare.jpg Museum poster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070341/http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/shakespeare.jpg |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and publishing houses&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/dekameron1%20d.jpg Book poster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070053/http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/dekameron1%20d.jpg |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of the [[revolutions of 1989]] in [[Eastern Europe]] he drew some [[political posters]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/koncert.jpg Political poster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070404/http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/koncert.jpg |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; too. His "Tovarishi Adieu" (also used with text "Tovarishi Koniec" – that means [[Comrade]]s it is over) appeared in many countries and it was known as symbolic image of changes in the area.

==His anamorphoses==
Artists who design [[anamorphosis]] (anamorphosis is Greek for "re-transformation") play with perspective to create a distorted image that appears normal only when viewed from the correct angle or with the aid of curved mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;Technique of [http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/lab%20d.jpg anamorphic distortion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070456/http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/lab%20d.jpg |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique was often used by [[Renaissance]]-era artists. Orosz tries to renew the technique of anamorphosis and his aim is to develop it as well when he gives a meaning to the distorted image, too. It is not an amorph picture any more, but a meaningful depiction that is independent from the result that appears in the mirror&lt;ref&gt;Anamorphosis with double meanings: a landscape in the horizontal sheet of paper and portrait of [http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/Verne00.jpg Jules Verne in the mirror cylinder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070312/http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/Verne00.jpg |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or viewed from a special point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Anamorphosis with double meanings: [http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/Shakespeare%20anamorf%20d.jpg viewed in the traditional way] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070422/http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/Shakespeare%20anamorf%20d.jpg |date=2007-09-27 }} a theatre in the age of William Shakespeare.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;...and the same picture [http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/Shakespeare%20anamorf%20a%20d.jpg viewed from a narrow angle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070003/http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/Shakespeare%20anamorf%20a%20d.jpg |date=2007-09-27 }} : the portrait of Shakespeare&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach of anamorphoses is suitable for expressing more sophisticated messages, and it fits to show more amusing fun.&lt;ref&gt;Anamorphic illustration for the narrative poem by Edgar Allan Poe: [http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/Poe%20d.jpg "The Raven"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070214/http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/Poe%20d.jpg |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/Poe%20hengerrel%20d.jpg The poet in the mirror] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070159/http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/Poe%20hengerrel%20d.jpg |date=2007-09-27 }} - the same illustration with a chrome-plated brass cylinder&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Model==
[[File:Magpie illustration.jpg|thumb|Input data and output parameters of MAgPIE]]
The model is based on static yield functions in order to model potential crop productivity and its related water use.&lt;ref name=Lotze-Campen2008 /&gt; For the biophysical supply simulation, spatially explicit 0.5° data is aggregated to a consistent number of clusters. Ten world regions represent the demand side of the model. Required calories for the demand categories (food and non-food energy intake) are determined by a cross-sectional country regression based on population and income projections. In order to fulfill the demand, the model allocates 19 cropping and 5 [[livestock]] activities to the spatially-explicit land and water resources, subject to resource, management and cost constraints. From 1995 MAgPIE simulates time-steps of 10 years. For each period the optimal land use pattern from the previous period is used as a starting point.&lt;ref name=Schmitz2012 /&gt; 

==Demand==
The demand for agricultural products is fixed for every region and every time-step. The drivers of agricultural demand are: time, income and population growth. Total demand is composed of: food demand, material demand, feed demand and seed demand. Food demand depends on food energy demand, and the share of crop and livestock products in the diet. Within livestock products, the share of different products (Ruminant meat, chicken meat, other meat, milk, eggs) is fixed at 1995 levels. The same is valid for the share of crops within total food calories and material demand. The share of livestock products in the total consumed food calories is an important driver for the land-use sector. Different statistical models are used to estimate plausible future scenarios. A calibration is used to reach the livestock shares of the Food Balance Sheets for 1995 for each region.

Feed for livestock is produced as a mixture of concentrates, fodder, livestock products (e.g. bone meal), pasture, crop residues and conversion by-products (e.g. rapeseed cake) at predefined proportions. These differences in the livestock systems cause different emission levels from livestock.

==Biophysical Inputs==
The biophysical inputs for the simulations are obtained from the grid-based model [[LPJmL]]. The global vegetation model with managed land (LPJmL) also delivers values for water availability and requirements for each grid cell as well as the carbon content of the different vegetation types. Cropland, pasture, and irrigation water are fixed inputs in limited supply in each grid cell.&lt;ref name=Schmitz2012 /&gt;

==Cost Types==
MAgPIE takes four different cost types into account: production costs for crop and livestock production, investments in technological change, land conversion costs and intra-regional transport costs. By minimizing these four cost components on a global scale for the current time step, the model solution is obtained. Production costs in MAgPIE imply costs for labor, capital and intermediate inputs. They are specific for all crop and livestock types and are implemented as costs per area for crops (US$/ha) and costs per production unit of livestock (US$/ton). 

MAgPIE has two options to increase total production in agriculture at additional costs: land expansion and intensification. In MAgPIE the latter can be achieved by investments in technological change (TC).&lt;ref name=Schmitz2012 /&gt; Investing in technological change triggers yield increases which lead then to a higher total production. At the same time the corresponding increases in agricultural land-use intensity raises costs for further yield increases. The reason is that intensification on land which is already used intensively is more expensive than intensification on extensively-used land.

To increase production another alternative is to expand cropland into non-agricultural land.&lt;ref name=Krause2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krause|first=M.|author2=Lotze-Campen, H. |author3=Popp, A. |title=Spatially-explicit scenarios on global cropland expansion and available forest land in an integrated modelling framework|journal=Conference Paper|date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conversion causes additional costs for the preparation of new land and basic infrastructure investments, which are also taken into account. Intraregional transport costs arise for each commodity unit as a function of the distance to intraregional markets and therefore restrict land expansion in MAgPIE. This depends on the quality and accessibility of infrastructure. Intra-regional transport costs are higher for less accessible areas than for more accessible regions. This leads to higher overall costs of cropland expansion in those cases.&lt;ref name=Schmitz2012 /&gt;

'''Magnetic anisotropy''' is the [[anisotropy|directional dependence]] of a material's [[magnetic]] properties. The [[magnetic moment]] of magnetically anisotropic materials will tend to align with an '''easy axis''', which is an energetically favorable direction of [[spontaneous magnetization]]. The two opposite directions along an easy axis are usually equivalent, and the actual direction of magnetization can be along either of them (see [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]]).

In contrast, a magnetically [[isotropy|isotropic]] material has no preferential direction for its [[magnetic moment]] unless there is an applied [[magnetic field]].

Magnetic anisotropy is a prerequisite for [[Magnetic hysteresis|hysteresis in ferromagnets]]: without it, a ferromagnet is [[superparamagnetic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aharoni|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
There are several sources of magnetic anisotropy:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCaig|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Magnetocrystalline anisotropy]]: The atomic structure of a [[crystal]] introduces preferential directions for the [[magnetization]].
; Shape anisotropy: When a particle is not perfectly spherical, the [[demagnetizing field]] will not be equal for all directions, creating one or more easy axes.
; [[Villari effect|Magnetoelastic anisotropy]]: [[Tension (physics)|Tension]] may alter magnetic behaviour, leading to magnetic anisotropy.
; [[Exchange Bias|Exchange anisotropy]]: Occurs when [[antiferromagnetic]] and [[ferromagnetic]] materials interact.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meiklejohn|Bean|1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anisotropy energy of a single-domain magnet==

Suppose that a ferromagnet is [[single-domain (magnetic)|single-domain]] in the strictest sense: the magnetization is uniform and rotates in unison. If the [[magnetic moment]] is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\boldsymbol{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; and the volume of the particle is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle V&lt;/math&gt;, the magnetization is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbf{M} = \boldsymbol{\mu}/V = M_s \left(\alpha,\beta,\gamma\right)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle M_s&lt;/math&gt; is the [[saturation magnetization]] and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \alpha,\beta,\gamma&lt;/math&gt; are [[direction cosines]] (components of a [[unit vector]]) so &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \alpha^2+\beta^2+\gamma^2=1&lt;/math&gt;. The energy associated with magnetic anisotropy can depend on the direction cosines in various ways, the most common of which are discussed below.

===Uniaxial===
A magnetic particle with uniaxial anisotropy has one easy axis. If the easy axis is in the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; direction, the [[anisotropy energy]] can be expressed as one of the forms:

:&lt;math&gt; E = KV \left(1-\gamma^2 \right) = KV \sin^2\theta,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle V&lt;/math&gt; is the volume, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle K&lt;/math&gt; the anisotropy constant, and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \theta&lt;/math&gt; the angle between the easy axis and the particle's magnetization. When shape anisotropy is explicitly considered, the symbol &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt; is often used to indicate the anisotropy constant, instead of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle K&lt;/math&gt;. In the widely used [[Stoner–Wohlfarth model]], the anisotropy is uniaxial.

===Triaxial===
A magnetic particle with triaxial anisotropy still has a single easy axis, but it also has a '''hard axis''' (direction of maximum energy) and an '''intermediate axis''' (direction associated with a [[saddle point]] in the energy). The coordinates can be chosen so the energy has the form

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle E = K_aV\alpha^2 + K_bV\beta^2.&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle K_a&gt;K_b&gt;0,&lt;/math&gt; the easy axis is the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; direction, the intermediate axis is the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; direction and the hard axis is the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donahue|Porter|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cubic===
A magnetic particle with cubic anisotropy has three or four easy axes, depending on the anisotropy parameters. The energy has the form

:&lt;math&gt;E = KV \left(\alpha^2\beta^2+\beta^2\gamma^2+\gamma^2\alpha^2\right).&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle K&gt;0,&lt;/math&gt; the easy axes are the &lt;math&gt;x,y,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axes. If &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle K&lt;0,&lt;/math&gt; there are four easy axes characterized by &lt;math&gt;x = \pm y = \pm z&lt;/math&gt;.

A convenient '''notation for theoretic scheduling problems''' was introduced by [[Ronald Graham]], [[Eugene Lawler]], [[Jan Karel Lenstra]] and [[Alexander Rinnooy Kan]] in.&lt;ref name="initial specification" /&gt; It consists of three fields: [[Alpha (letter)|α]], [[Beta (letter)|β]] and [[Gamma|γ]].

Each field may be a comma separated list of words. The α field describes the machine environment, β the job characteristics and constraints, and γ the objective function.

Since its introduction in the late 70's the notation has been constantly extended, sometimes inconsistently.   As a result today there are some problems that appear with distinct notations in several papers.   

== Machine environment ==

=== Single stage problems ===
Each job comes with a given processing time.

; 1
: there is a single machine
; P
: there are &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; parallel identical machines
; Q
: there are &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; parallel machines with different given speeds, length of job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; on machine &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is the processing time &lt;math&gt;p_{j}&lt;/math&gt; divided by speed &lt;math&gt;s_i&lt;/math&gt;.
; R
: there are &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; parallel unrelated machines, there are given processing times &lt;math&gt;p_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; for job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; on machine &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;

These letters might be followed by the number of machines which is then fixed, here &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; stands then for a fixed number.  For example &lt;math&gt;P2||C_{\max}&lt;/math&gt; is the problem of assigning each of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; given jobs to one of the 2 given machines so to minimize the maximum total processing time over the machines.

=== Multi-stage problem ===
; O 
: [[Open Shop Scheduling|Open shop problem]]. Every job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; consists of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; operations &lt;math&gt;O_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i=1,\ldots,m&lt;/math&gt;.  The operations can be scheduled in any order. Operation &lt;math&gt;O_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; must be processed for &lt;math&gt;p_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; units on machine &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.
; F : [[Flow Shop Scheduling Problem|Flow shop problem]]. Every job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; consists of &lt;math&gt;n_j&lt;/math&gt; operations &lt;math&gt;O_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k=1,\ldots,m&lt;/math&gt;, to be scheduled in that order.  Operation &lt;math&gt;O_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; must be processed for &lt;math&gt;p_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; units on machine &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.
; J : [[Job Shop Scheduling|Job shop problem]]. Every job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; consists of &lt;math&gt;n_j&lt;/math&gt; operations &lt;math&gt;O_{kj}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k=1,\ldots,n_j&lt;/math&gt;, to be scheduled in that order.  Operation &lt;math&gt;O_{kj}&lt;/math&gt; must be processed for &lt;math&gt;p_{kj}&lt;/math&gt; units on a dedicated machine &lt;math&gt;\mu_{kj}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mu_{kj}\neq \mu_{k'j}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k\neq k'&lt;/math&gt;.

== Job characteristics ==

The processing time may be equal for all jobs (&lt;math&gt;p_i=p&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;p_{ij}=p&lt;/math&gt;) or even of unit length (&lt;math&gt;p_i=1&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;p_{ij}=1&lt;/math&gt;). All processing times are assumed to be integers. In some older research papers however they are assumed to be rationals.

; &lt;math&gt;r_j&lt;/math&gt;
: for each job a release time is given before which it cannot be scheduled, default is 0.
; &lt;math&gt;online-r_j&lt;/math&gt;
: This is an online problem. Jobs are revealed at their release times.  In this context the performance of an algorithm is measured by its [[Competitive analysis (online algorithm)|competitive ratio]].
; &lt;math&gt;d_j&lt;/math&gt;
: for each job a due date is given.   The idea is that every job should complete before its due date and there is some penalty for jobs that complete late.  This penalty is denoted in the objective value.  The presence of the job characteristic &lt;math&gt;d_j&lt;/math&gt; is implicitly assumed and not denoted in the problem name, unless there are some restrictions as for example &lt;math&gt;d_j=d&lt;/math&gt;, assuming that all due dates are equal to some given date.
; &lt;math&gt;\bar d_j&lt;/math&gt;
: for each job a strict deadline is given.  Every job must complete before its deadline.
; pmtn
: Jobs can be preempted and resumed possibly on another machine. Sometimes also denoted by 'prmp'.
; &lt;math&gt;size_j&lt;/math&gt;
: Each job comes with a number of machines on which it must be scheduled at the same time, default is 1.

=== Precedence relations ===

Precedence relations might be given for the jobs, in form of a partial order, meaning that if i is a predecessor of i' in that order, i' can start only when i is completed.

; prec
: Given general precedence relation.  If &lt;math&gt;i\prec j&lt;/math&gt; then starting time of &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; should be not earlier than completion time of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.
; chains
: Given precedence relation in form of chains (indegrees and outdegrees are at most 1).
; tree
: Given general precedence relation in form of a tree, either intree or outtree.
; intree
: Given general precedence relation in form of an intree (outdegrees are at most 1).
; outtree
: Given general precedence relation in form of an outtree (indegrees are at most 1).
; opposing forest
: Given general precedence relation in form of a collection of intrees and outtrees.
; sp-graph
: Given precedence relation in form of a series parallel graph.
; bounded height
: Given precedence relation where the longest directed path is bounded by a constant.
; level order
: Given precedence relation where each vertex of a given level l (i.e. the length of the longest directed path starting from this vertex is l) is a predecessor of all the vertices of level l-1.
; interval order
: Given precedence relation for which one can associate to each vertex an interval in the real line, and there is a precedence between x and y if and only if the half open intervals x=[s_x,e_x) and y=[s_y,e_y) are such that e_x is smaller than or equal to s_y.
; quasi-interval order
: Quasi-interval orders are a superclass of interval orders defined in Moukrim: Optimal scheduling on parallel machines for a new order class, Operations Research Letters, 24(1):91-95, 1999.
; over-interval order
: Over-interval orders are a superclass of quasi-interval orders defined in Chardon and Moukrim: The Coffman-Graham algorithm optimally solves UET task systems with overinterval orders, SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics, 19(1):109-121, 2005.
; Am-order
: Am orders are a superclass of over-interval orders defined in Moukrim and Quilliot: A relation between multiprocessor scheduling and linear programming. Order, 14(3):269-278, 1997.
; DC-graph
: A divide-and-conquer graph is a subclass of series-parallel graphs defined in Kubiak et al.: Optimality of HLF for scheduling divide-and-conquer UET task graphs on identical parallel processors. Discrete Optimization, 6:79-91, 2009.
; 2-dim partial order
: A 2-dimensional partial order is a k-dimensional partial order for k=2.
; k-dim partial order
: A poset is a k-dimensional partial order iff it can be embedded into the k-dimensional Euclidian space in such a way that each node is represented by a k-dimensional point and there is a precedence between two nodes i and j iff for any dimension the coordinate of i is smaller than or equal to the one of j.


In the presence of a precedence relation one might in addition assume ''time lags''.  Let &lt;math&gt;S_j&lt;/math&gt; denote the start time of a job and &lt;math&gt;C_j&lt;/math&gt; its completion time.  Then the precedence relation &lt;math&gt;i \prec j&lt;/math&gt; implies the constraint &lt;math&gt;C_i + l_{ij} \leq S_j &lt;/math&gt;.  If no time lag &lt;math&gt;l_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is specified then it is assumed to be zero.  Time lags can be positive or negative numbers.

; l
: job independent time lags. In other words &lt;math&gt;l_{ij}=l&lt;/math&gt;  for all job pairs i, j and a given number l.
; &lt;math&gt;l_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;
: job pair dependent arbitrary time lags.

=== Transportation delays ===

; &lt;math&gt;t_{jk}&lt;/math&gt; 
: Between the completion of operation &lt;math&gt;O_{kj}&lt;/math&gt; of job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; on machine &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;and the start of operation &lt;math&gt;O_{k+1,j}&lt;/math&gt; of job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; on machine &lt;math&gt;k+1&lt;/math&gt;, there is a transportation delay of at least &lt;math&gt;t_{jk}&lt;/math&gt;units.
; &lt;math&gt;t_{jkl}&lt;/math&gt; 
: Between the completion of operation &lt;math&gt;O_{kj}&lt;/math&gt; of job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; on machine &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and the start of operation &lt;math&gt;O_{l,j}&lt;/math&gt; of job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; on machine &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, there is a transportation delay of at least &lt;math&gt;t_{jkl}&lt;/math&gt; units.
; &lt;math&gt;t_k&lt;/math&gt; 
: Machine dependent transportation delay. Between the completion of operation &lt;math&gt;O_{kj}&lt;/math&gt; of job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; on machine &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and the start of operation &lt;math&gt;O_{k+1,j}&lt;/math&gt; of job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; on machine &lt;math&gt;k+1&lt;/math&gt;, there is a transportation delay of at least &lt;math&gt;t_{k}&lt;/math&gt; units.
; &lt;math&gt;t_{kl}&lt;/math&gt; 
: Machine pair dependent transportation delay. Between the completion of operation &lt;math&gt;O_{kj}&lt;/math&gt; of job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; on machine &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and the start of operation &lt;math&gt;O_{l,j}&lt;/math&gt;o f job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; on machine &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, there is a transportation delay of at least &lt;math&gt;t_{kl}&lt;/math&gt; units.
; &lt;math&gt;t_j&lt;/math&gt; 
: Job dependent transportation delay. Between the completion of operation &lt;math&gt;O_{kj}&lt;/math&gt; of job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; on machine &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and the start of operation &lt;math&gt;O_{l,j}&lt;/math&gt; of job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; on machine &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, there is a transportation delay of at least &lt;math&gt;t_{j}&lt;/math&gt; units.


=== Various constraints ===

; rcrc
: Recirculation, also called Flexible job shop. The promise on &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is lifted and for some pairs &lt;math&gt;k\neq k'&lt;/math&gt; we might have &lt;math&gt;\mu_{kj}= \mu_{k'j}&lt;/math&gt;.
; no-wait
: The operation &lt;math&gt;O_{k+1,i}&lt;/math&gt;must start exactly when operation &lt;math&gt;O_{k,i}&lt;/math&gt; completes.  Sometimes also denoted as 'nwt'.
; no-idle
: No machine is ever idle between two executions.
; &lt;math&gt;size_j&lt;/math&gt;
: Multiprocessor tasks on identical parallel machines. The execution of job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is done simultaneously on &lt;math&gt;size_j&lt;/math&gt;parallel machines.
; &lt;math&gt;fix_j&lt;/math&gt;
: Multiprocessor tasks. Every job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;is given with a set of machines &lt;math&gt;fix_j\subseteq\{1,\ldots,m\}&lt;/math&gt;, and needs simultaneously all these machines for execution. Sometimes also denoted by 'MPT'.
; &lt;math&gt;M_j&lt;/math&gt;
: Multipurpose machines. Every job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;needs to be scheduled on one machine out of a given set &lt;math&gt;M_j\subseteq\{1,\ldots,m\}&lt;/math&gt;.  Sometimes also denoted by 'M_j'.


== Objective functions ==

Usually the goal is to minimize some objective value. One difference is the notation &lt;math&gt;\sum U_j&lt;/math&gt; where the goal is to maximize the number of jobs that complete before their deadline. This is also called the ''throughput''.  The objective value can be sum, possibly weighted by some given priority weights &lt;math&gt;w_j&lt;/math&gt; per job.

; -
: The absence of an objective value is denoted by a single dash. This means that the problem consists simply in producing a feasible scheduling, satisfying all given constraints.
; &lt;math&gt;C_j&lt;/math&gt;
: This denotes the ''completion time'' of job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;.
; &lt;math&gt;F_j&lt;/math&gt;
: The ''flow time'' of a job is difference between its completion time and its release time, i.e. &lt;math&gt;F_j=C_j-r_j&lt;/math&gt;. 
; &lt;math&gt;L_j&lt;/math&gt;
: Lateness. Every job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is given a due date &lt;math&gt;d_j&lt;/math&gt;. The lateness of job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;C_j-d_j&lt;/math&gt;.  Sometimes &lt;math&gt;L_{\max}&lt;/math&gt; is used to denote feasibility for a problem with deadlines. Indeed using binary search, the complexity of the feasibility version is equivalent to the minimization of &lt;math&gt;L_{\max}&lt;/math&gt;.
; &lt;math&gt;U_j&lt;/math&gt;
: Throughput. Every job is given a due date &lt;math&gt;d_j&lt;/math&gt;.  There is a unit profit for jobs that complete one time, i.e. &lt;math&gt;U_j=1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;C_j\leq d_j&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;U_j=0&lt;/math&gt; otherwise.  Sometimes the meaning of &lt;math&gt;U_j&lt;/math&gt; is inverted in the literature, which is equivalent when considering the decision version of the problem, but which makes a huge difference for approximations.
; &lt;math&gt;T_j&lt;/math&gt;
: Tardiness. Every job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is given a due date &lt;math&gt;d_j&lt;/math&gt;. The tardiness of job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;T_j =  \max\{0, C_j-d_j\}&lt;/math&gt;.
; &lt;math&gt;E_j&lt;/math&gt;
: Earliness. Every job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is given a due date &lt;math&gt;d_j&lt;/math&gt;. The earliness of job &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;E_j = \max\{0, d_j-C_j\}&lt;/math&gt;.  This objective is important for ''just-in-time' scheduling.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Known to family and friends as "Peter", Bridgman was born in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], Massachusetts, and grew up in nearby [[Auburndale, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="Kemble"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kemble | first1 = Edwin C. | last2 = Birch | first2 = Francis | title = Percy Williams Bridgman – 1882—1961 | publisher = National Academy of Sciences | year = 1970 | url = http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/bridgman-percy-w.pdf | pages = 25, 26, 27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bridgman's parents were both born in New England.  His father, Raymond Landon Bridgman, was "profoundly religious and idealistic" and worked as a newspaper reporter assigned to state politics. His mother, Mary Ann Maria Williams, was described as "more conventional, sprightly, and competitive".&lt;ref name="Kemble"/&gt;

Bridgman attended both elementary and high school in Auburndale, where he excelled at competitions in the classroom, on the playground, and while playing chess.  Described as both shy and proud, his home life consisted of family music, card games, and domestic and garden chores.  The family was deeply religious; reading the Bible each morning and attending a [[Congregational Church#New England|Congregational Church]].&lt;ref name="Kemble"/&gt; However, Bridgman later became an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Monk (2013). Robert Oppenheimer: A Life Inside the Center. Random House LLC. {{ISBN|9780385504133}}. In many ways they were opposites; Kemble, the theorist, was a devout Christian, while Bridgman, the experimentalist, was a strident atheist.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education and professional life===
Bridgman entered [[Harvard University]] in 1900, and studied [[physics]] through to his [[Ph.D.]] From 1910 until his retirement, he taught at Harvard, becoming a full professor in 1919. In 1905, he began investigating the properties of matter under [[high pressure]]. A machinery malfunction led him to modify his pressure apparatus; the result was a new device enabling him to create pressures eventually exceeding 100,000 [[kilogram-force|kgf]]/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (10 [[gigapascal|GPa]]; 100,000 [[atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]]). This was a huge improvement over previous machinery, which could achieve pressures of only 3,000 kgf/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (0.3 GPa). This new apparatus led to an abundance of new findings, including a study of the compressibility, electric and [[thermal conductivity]], [[tensile strength]] and [[viscosity]] of more than 100 different compounds. Bridgman is also known for his studies of electrical conduction in metals and properties of crystals. He developed the [[Bridgman seal]] and is the eponym for [[Bridgman's thermodynamic equations]].

Bridgman made many improvements to his high-pressure apparatus over the years, and unsuccessfully attempted the [[Synthetic diamond|synthesis of diamond]] many times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Hazen | first=Robert | title=The Diamond Makers | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge | year=1999 | isbn=0-521-65474-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[philosophy of science]] book ''[[The Logic of Modern Physics]]'' (1927) advocated [[operationalism]] and coined the term [[operational definition]]. In 1938 he participated in the International Committee composed to organise the International Congresses for the Unity of Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neurath|first1=Otto|title=Unified Science as Encyclopedic Integration|journal=[[International Encyclopedia of Unified Science]]|date=1938|volume=1|issue=1|pages=1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also one of the 11 signatories to the [[Russell–Einstein Manifesto]].

===Home life and death===
[[File:Percy Bridgman with wife and Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden 1946.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Bridgman with wife and [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden]] in Stockholm im 1946]]
Bridgman married Olive Ware, of [[Hartford, Connecticut]], in 1912.  Ware's father, [[Edmund Asa Ware]], was the founder and first president of [[Atlanta University]]. The couple had two children and were married for 50 years, living most of that time in Cambridge.  The family also had a summer home in [[Randolph, New Hampshire]], where Bridgman was known as a skilled mountain climber.&lt;ref name="Kemble"/&gt;

Bridgman was a "penetrating analytical thinker" with a "fertile mechanical imagination" and exceptional manual dexterity.  He was a skilled plumber and carpenter, known to shun the assistance of professionals in these matters.  He was also fond of music and played the piano, and took pride in his flower and vegetable gardens.&lt;ref name="Kemble"/&gt;

Bridgman committed suicide by gunshot after suffering from [[metastasis|metastatic]] [[cancer]] for some time. His suicide note read in part, "It isn't decent for society to make a man do this thing himself. Probably this is the last day I will be able to do it myself."&lt;ref&gt;Nuland, Sherwin. ''How We Die: Reflections on Life's Final Chapter''. Vintage Press, 1995. {{ISBN|0-679-74244-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bridgman's words have been quoted by many in the [[assisted suicide]] debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=15041&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1021 Ayn Rand Institute discussion on assisted suicide].

[[File:Compass Rose English North.svg|thumb|16-point [[compass rose]]]]
The '''points of the compass''' mark the divisions on a [[compass]], which is primarily divided into four points: [[north]], [[south]], [[east]], and [[west]]. These [[cardinal direction]]s are further subdivided by the addition of the four intercardinal (or ordinal) directions—northeast (NE), southeast (SE), southwest (SW), and northwest (NW)—to indicate the eight principal winds. In [[meteorology|meteorological]] usage, further intermediate points between cardinal and ordinal points, such as north-northeast (NNE) are added to give the 16 points of a [[compass rose]].&lt;ref&gt;David Boardman. ''[[Graphicacy]] and Geography Teaching'', 1983. Page 41 "In particular they should learn that wind direction is always stated as the direction from which, and not to which, the wind is blowing. Once children have grasped these eight points they can learn the full sixteen points of the compass."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Compass Card B+W.svg|thumb|32-point [[compass rose]]]]
At the most complete division are the full thirty-two points of the [[mariner's compass]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pamphlets on British shipping. 1785–1861 |author=unknown editor |contribution=Notes on the Magnetism of Ships |contributor-first=Frederick John |contributor-last=Evans |contributor-link=Frederick John Owen Evans |page=8 (p. 433 of PDF) |year=1859 |isbn=0-217-85167-3 |contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QPNAAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA50 |quote=A deviation table having been formed by any of the processes now.so generally understood, either on the thirty-two points of the compass, the sixteen intermediate, or the eight principal points}}&lt;/ref&gt; which adds points such as north by east (NbE) between north and north-northeast, and northeast by north (NEbN) between north-northeast and northeast. A compass point allows reference to a specific [[Course (navigation)|course]] (or [[Azimuth#Navigation|azimuth]]) in a [[Colloquialism|colloquial]] fashion, without having to compute or remember degrees.

The European nautical tradition retained the term "one point" to describe {{frac|32}} of a circle in such phrases as "two points to starboard". By the middle of the 18th century, the 32-point system was extended with half- and quarter-points to allow 128 directions to be differentiated.&lt;ref name=Chambers1743/&gt;

=={{anchor|Compass points|compass point names|Compass_point_names}}Compass points==

The names of the compass point directions follow these rules:
=== 8-wind compass rose ===
* The four [[cardinal direction]]s are '''north''' (N), '''east''' (E), '''south''' (S), '''west''' (W), at 90° angles on the compass rose.
* The four ordinal (or intercardinal) directions are formed by bisecting the angle of the cardinal winds: '''northeast''' (NE), '''southeast''' (SE), '''southwest''' (SW) and '''northwest''' (NW). The name of each ordinal is simply a combination of the cardinals that it bisects.
* The eight '''principal winds''' (or '''main winds''') are the four cardinals and four ordinals considered together, that is: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW. Each principal wind is 45° from its two neighbours. The principal winds form the basic '''8-wind compass rose'''.

=== 16-wind compass rose ===
* The eight '''half-winds''' are the direction points obtained by bisecting the angles between the principal winds. The half-winds are '''north-northeast''' (NNE), '''east-northeast''' (ENE), '''east-southeast''' (ESE), '''south-southeast''' (SSE), '''south-southwest''' (SSW), '''west-southwest''' (WSW), '''west-northwest''' (WNW) and '''north-northwest''' (NNW). The name of each half-wind is constructed by combining the names of the principal winds to either side, with the cardinal wind coming first and the ordinal wind second.
* The eight principal winds and the eight half-winds together form the '''16-wind compass rose''', with each compass point at a {{frac|22|1|2}}° angle from its two neighbours.
[[File:Brosen windrose Full.svg|right|thumb|32-point [[compass rose]]]]
[[File:Compass thumbnail.jpg|thumb|32-wind compass card, with English names]]

=== {{anchor|Wind compass|wind compass|Wind compass points|wind compass rose}} 32-wind compass rose ===
* All of the points in the 16-wind compass rose (above) plus the sixteen '''quarter-winds''' (listed below) together form the '''32-wind compass rose'''.
* The sixteen '''quarter-winds''' are the direction points obtained by bisecting the angles between the points on the 16-wind compass rose. The quarter-winds are: (in the first quadrant) '''north by east''' (NbE), '''northeast by north''' (NEbN), '''northeast by east''' (NEbE), and '''east by north''' (EbN); (in the second quadrant) '''east by south''' (EbS), '''southeast by east''' (SEbE), '''southeast by south''' (SEbS), and '''south by east''' (SbE); (in the third quadrant) '''south by west''' (SbW), '''southwest by south''' (SWbS), '''southwest by west''' (SWbW), and '''west by south''' (WbS); (in the fourth quadrant) '''west by north''' (WbN), '''northwest by west''' (NWbW), '''northwest by north''' (NWbN), and '''north by west''' (NbW).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/the-compass-instrument-1435002|title=An Overview and History of the Compass|first=Xanthe|last=Webb Aintablian|date=28 June 2018|publisher=[[Dotdash]]|website=thoughtco.com|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706191612/https://www.thoughtco.com/the-compass-instrument-1435002|archive-date=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staff.washington.edu/rel2/geog100-UW/Scenarios/Rutters/Compass_Rose.html|title=Compass Rose|first=Robert E.|last=Lee|date=2011|publisher=[[University of Washington]]|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221121147/http://staff.washington.edu/rel2/geog100-UW/Scenarios/Rutters/Compass_Rose.html|archive-date=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The name of a quarter-wind is "X by Y", where X is a principal wind and Y is a cardinal wind. As a mnemonic device, it is useful to think of "X by Y" as a shortcut for the phrase "one quarter-wind ''from'' X ''towards'' Y", where a "quarter" is {{frac|11|1|4}}°, X is the nearest principal wind, and Y is the next (more distant) cardinal wind. So, for example, "northeast by east" means "one quarter from NE towards E", "southwest by south" means "one quarter from SW towards S", etc.

In summary, the '''32-wind compass rose''' is yielded from the eight '''principal winds''', eight '''half-winds''' and sixteen '''quarter-winds''' combined together, with each compass direction point at an {{frac|11|1|4}}° angle from the next.

In the mariner's exercise of '''boxing the compass''', all thirty-two points of the [[compass]] are named in [[clockwise]] order.&lt;ref&gt;George Payn Quackenbos A Natural Philosophy: Embracing the Most Recent Discoveries  1860 "Mentioning the mariner's compass: the points of the compass in their order is called boxing the compass. — The compass box is suspended within a larger box by means of two brass hoops, or gimbals as they are called, supported at opposite ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traditional names ==
The traditional compass rose of eight winds (and its 16-wind and 32-wind derivatives) was invented by seafarers in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] during the [[Middle Ages]] (with no obvious connection to the twelve [[classical compass winds]] of the ancient Greeks and Romans). The traditional mariner's wind names were expressed in [[Italian language|Italian]], or more precisely, the Italianate  [[Mediterranean lingua franca]] common among sailors in the 13th and 14th centuries, which was principally composed of Genoese ([[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian]]), mixed with [[Venetian language|Venetian]], [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]], [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Arabic]] terms from around the Mediterranean basin.

[[File:32-point compass (traditional winds).svg|thumb|400px|32-wind compass with traditional names (and traditional colour code)]]
This Italianate [[patois]] was used to designate the names of the principal winds on the compass rose found in mariners' compasses and [[portolan chart]]s of the 14th and 15th centuries. The "traditional" names of the eight principal winds are:
* (N) – ''Tramontana''
* (NE) – ''Greco''  (or ''[[Bora (wind)|Bora]]'' in some Venetian sources)
* (E) – ''Levante'' (sometimes ''Oriente'')
* (SE) – ''Scirocco'' (or ''Exaloc'' in Catalan)
* (S) – ''Ostro'' (or  ''Mezzogiorno'' in Venetian)
* (SW) – ''Libeccio'' (or ''Garbino'', ''Eissalot'' in Provençal)
* (W) – ''Ponente'' (or ''Zephyrus'' in Greek)
* (NW) – ''Maestro'' (or ''Mistral'' in Provençal)

Local spelling variations are far more numerous than listed, e.g. Tramutana, Gregale, Grecho, Sirocco, Xaloc, Lebeg, Libezo, Leveche, Mezzodi, Migjorn, Magistro, Mestre, etc. Traditional compass roses will typically have the initials T, G, L, S, O, L, P, and M on the main points. Portolan charts also colour-coded the compass winds: black for the eight principal winds, green for the eight half-winds, and red for the sixteen quarter-winds.

Each half-wind name is simply a combination of the two principal winds that it bisects, with the shortest name usually placed first, for example: NNE is "Greco-Tramontana"; ENE is "Greco-Levante"; SSE is "Ostro-Scirocco", etc. The quarter winds are expressed with an Italian phrase, "''Quarto di ''X'' verso ''Y" ({{IPA-it|ˈkwarto di ''X'' ˈvɛrso ''Y''|pron}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordreference.com/iten/quarto|title=quarto|website=WordReference.com|quote=English translation: fourth, quarter|access-date=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordreference.com/iten/di|title=di|website=WordReference.com|quote=English translation: of, from...|access-date=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordreference.com/iten/verso|title=verso|website=WordReference.com|quote=English translation: towards, toward, close to, near to|access-date=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; one quarter from X towards Y),  or "X ''al'' Y" (X to Y) or "X ''per'' Y" (X by Y). There are no irregularities to trip over; the closest principal wind always comes first, the more distant one second, for example: north-by-east is "''Quarto di Tramontana verso Greco''"; and northeast-by-north is "''Quarto di Greco verso Tramontana''".

The table below shows how the 32 compass points are named.

Each point has an angular range of 11.250 degrees where: '''middle [[azimuth]]''' is the horizontal angular direction (from north) of the given compass bearing; '''minimum''' is the lower angular limit of the compass point; and '''maximum''' is the upper angular limit of the compass point.

==Half- and quarter-points==
[[File:Bowditch1916p15CompassRose.png|thumb|Compass rose from "American Practical Navigator" 1916]]

By the middle of the 18th century, the 32-point system had been further extended by using half- and quarter-points to give a total of 128 directions.&lt;ref name=Chambers1743&gt;E. Chambers ''Cyclopaedia: or, an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Science'', 5th Ed, 1743, pp.&amp;nbsp;206–7, "Points ''of the Compass'', or ''Horizon'', &amp;c., in Geography and Navigation, are the points of division when the whole circle, quite around, is divided into 32 equal parts. These points are therefore at the distance of the 32d part of the circult, or 11°&amp;thinsp;15′, from each other; hence 5°&amp;thinsp;{{sfrac|37|1|2}}′ is the distance of the half points and 2°&amp;thinsp;{{sfrac|48|3|4}}′ is the distance of the quarter points.&lt;/ref&gt;
These fractional points are named by appending, for example {{sfrac|1|4}}east, {{sfrac|1|2}}east, or {{sfrac|3|4}}east to the name of one of the 32 points. Each of the 96 fractional points can be named in two ways, depending on which of the two adjoining whole points is used, for example, N{{sfrac|3|4}}E is equivalent to NbE{{sfrac|1|4}}N. Either form is easily understood but alternative conventions as to correct usage developed in different countries and organisations. "It is the custom in the United States Navy to box ''from'' north and south ''toward'' east and west, with the exception that divisions adjacent to a cardinal or inter-cardinal point are always referred to that point."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=American Practical Navigator: An Epitome of Navigation and Nautical Astronomy |author-last=Bowditch |author-first=Nathaniel |publisher=United States Hydrographic Office |year=1916 |page=15 |url=https://archive.org/details/americanpracnavi00bowdrich}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Navy used the additional "rule that quarter points were never read from a point beginning and ending with the same letter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea |editor-last=Kemp |editor-first=Peter |year=1988 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-282084-2 |contribution=Box the Compass |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compass roses very rarely named the fractional points and only showed small, unlabelled markers as a guide for helmsmen.

===128 compass directions===
The table below shows how each of the 128 directions are named. The first two columns give the number of points and degrees clockwise from north. The third gives the equivalent bearing to the nearest degree from north or south towards east or west. The "CW" column gives the fractional-point bearings increasing in the [[clockwise]] direction and "CCW" [[counterclockwise]]. The final three columns show three common naming conventions: No "by" avoids the use of "by" with fractional points; "USN" is the system used by the US Navy; and "RN" is the Royal Navy system. Colour coding shows whether each of the three naming systems matches the "CW" or "CCW" column.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8763">{{Redirect|Product space||The Product Space}}
In [[topology]] and related areas of [[mathematics]], a '''product space''' is the [[Cartesian product]] of a family of [[topological space]]s equipped with a [[natural topology]] called the '''product topology'''.  This topology differs from another, perhaps more obvious, topology called the [[box topology]], which can also be given to a product space and which agrees with the product topology when the product is over only finitely many spaces.  However, the product topology is "correct" in that it makes the product space a [[product (category theory)|categorical product]] of its factors, whereas the box topology is [[Comparison of topologies|too fine]]; this is the sense in which the product topology is "natural".

==Definition==
Given ''X'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;X := \prod_{i \in I} X_i&lt;/math&gt;

is the Cartesian product of the topological spaces ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', [[index set|indexed]] by &lt;math&gt;i \in I&lt;/math&gt;, and the '''[[projection (set theory)|canonical projections]]''' ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''X'' &amp;rarr; ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', the '''product topology''' on ''X'' is defined to be the [[coarsest topology]] (i.e. the topology with the fewest open sets) for which all the projections ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are [[continuous (topology)|continuous]].  The product topology is sometimes called the '''Tychonoff topology'''.

The open sets in the product topology are unions (finite or infinite) of sets of the form &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i\in I} U_i&lt;/math&gt;, where each ''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is open in ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for only finitely many ''i''. In particular, for a finite product (in particular, for the product of two topological spaces), the set of all Cartesian products between one basis elements from each ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' gives a basis for the product topology of &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i\in I} X_i&lt;/math&gt;. That is, for a finite product, the set of all &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i\in I} U_i&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;U_i&lt;/math&gt; is an element of the (chosen) basis of &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt;, is a basis for the product topology of &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i\in I} X_i&lt;/math&gt;.

The product topology on ''X'' is the topology generated by sets of the form ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''), where  ''i'' is in ''I ''  and ''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an open subset of ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. In other words, the sets {''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')} form a [[subbase]] for the topology on ''X''. A [[subset]] of ''X'' is open if and only if it is a (possibly infinite) [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[intersection (set theory)|intersections]] of finitely many sets of the form ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''). The ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') are sometimes called [[open cylinder]]s, and their intersections are [[cylinder set]]s.

In general, the product of the topologies of each ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' forms a basis for what is called the [[box topology]] on ''X''. In general, the box topology is [[finer topology|finer]] than the product topology, but for finite products they coincide.

== Examples ==

If one starts with the [[standard topology]] on the [[real line]] '''R''' and defines a topology on the product of ''n'' copies of '''R''' in this fashion, one obtains the ordinary [[Euclidean topology]] on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

The [[Cantor set]] is [[homeomorphic]] to the product of [[countable|countably many]] copies of the [[discrete space]] {0,1} and the space of [[irrational number]]s is homeomorphic to the product of countably many copies of the [[natural number]]s, where again each copy carries the discrete topology.

Several additional examples are given in the article on the [[initial topology]].

== Properties ==

The product space ''X'', together with the canonical projections, can be characterized by the following [[universal property]]: If ''Y'' is a topological space, and for every ''i'' in ''I'', ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''Y'' &amp;rarr; ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a continuous map, then there exists ''precisely one'' continuous map ''f'' : ''Y'' &amp;rarr; ''X'' such that for each ''i'' in ''I'' the following diagram [[commutative diagram|commutes]]:
[[Image:CategoricalProduct-02.png|center|Characteristic property of product spaces]]
This shows that the product space is a [[product (category theory)|product]] in the [[category of topological spaces]]. It follows from the above universal property that a map ''f'' : ''Y'' &amp;rarr; ''X'' is continuous [[if and only if]] ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' o ''f'' is continuous for all ''i'' in ''I''. In many cases it is easier to check that the component functions ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are continuous. Checking whether a map ''f'' : ''Y'' &amp;rarr; ''X'' is continuous is usually more difficult; one tries to use the fact that the ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are continuous in some way.

In addition to being continuous, the canonical projections ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''X'' &amp;rarr; ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are [[open map]]s. This means that any open subset of the product space remains open when projected down to the ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. The converse is not true: if ''W'' is a [[subspace (topology)|subspace]] of the product space whose projections down to all the ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are open, then ''W'' need not be open in ''X''. (Consider for instance ''W'' = '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; \ (0,1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.) The canonical projections are not generally [[closed map]]s (consider for example the closed set &lt;math&gt;\{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid xy = 1\},&lt;/math&gt; whose projections onto both axes are '''R''' \ {0}).

The product topology is also called the ''topology of pointwise convergence'' because of the following fact: a [[sequence]] (or [[Net (mathematics)|net]]) in ''X'' converges if and only if all its projections to the spaces ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; converge. In particular, if one considers the space ''X'' = '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''I''&lt;/sup&gt; of all [[real number|real]] valued [[function (mathematics)|function]]s on ''I'', convergence in the product topology is the same as pointwise convergence of functions.

Any product of closed subsets of ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a closed set in ''X''.

An important theorem about the product topology is [[Tychonoff's theorem]]: any product of [[compact space]]s is compact. This is easy to show for finite products, while the general statement is equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]].

== Relation to other topological notions ==
* Separation
** Every product of [[T0 space|T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; space]]s is T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;
** Every product of [[T1 space|T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; space]]s is T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
** Every product of [[Hausdorff space]]s is Hausdorff&lt;ref&gt;{{planetmath reference|id=4317|title=Product topology preserves the Hausdorff property}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Every product of [[regular space]]s is regular
** Every product of [[Tychonoff space]]s is Tychonoff
** A product of [[normal space]]s ''need not'' be normal
* Compactness
** Every product of compact spaces is compact ([[Tychonoff's theorem]])
** A product of [[locally compact space]]s ''need not'' be locally compact. However, an arbitrary product of locally compact spaces where all but finitely many are compact ''is'' locally compact (This condition is sufficient and necessary). 
* Connectedness
** Every product of [[connectedness|connected]] (resp. path-connected) spaces is connected (resp. path-connected)
** Every product of hereditarily disconnected spaces is hereditarily disconnected.
* Metric spaces
** Countable products of [[metric space]]s are [[metric space|metrizable]]

==Axiom of choice==
The [[axiom of choice]] is equivalent to the statement that the product of a collection of non-empty sets is non-empty. The proof is easy enough: one needs only to pick an element from each set to find a representative in the product. Conversely, a representative of the product is a set which contains exactly one element from each component.

The axiom of choice occurs again in the study of (topological) product spaces; for example, [[Tychonoff's theorem]] on compact sets is a more complex and subtle example of a statement that is equivalent to the axiom of choice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4844">'''Rigid origami''' is a branch of [[origami]] which is concerned with folding structures using flat rigid sheets joined by [[hinge]]s. That is, unlike with paper origami, the sheets cannot bend during the folding process; they must remain flat at all times. However, there is no requirement that the structure start as a single flat sheet – for instance [[shopping bag]]s with flat bottoms are studied as part of rigid origami.

Rigid origami is a part of the study of the [[mathematics of paper folding]], and rigid origami structures can be considered as a type of [[Linkage (mechanical)|mechanical linkage]]. Rigid origami has great practical utility.

==Mathematics==

The number of standard  [[Yoshizawa–Randlett system#Origami bases|origami bases]] that can be folded using rigid origami is restricted by its rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Demaine, E. D |authorlink=Erik Demaine|title=Folding and Unfolding. Doctoral Thesis |place=University of Waterloo, Canada |year=2001 |url=http://etd.uwaterloo.ca/etd/eddemaine2001.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Rigid origami does not have to follow the [[Huzita–Hatori axioms]], the fold lines can be calculated rather than having to be constructed from existing lines and points. When folding rigid origami flat, [[Kawasaki's theorem]] and [[Maekawa's theorem]] restrict the folding patterns that are possible, just as they do in conventional origami, but they no longer form an exact characterization: some patterns that can be folded flat in conventional origami cannot be folded flat rigidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The [[Bellows conjecture|Bellows theorem]] says that a [[flexible polyhedron]] has constant volume when flexed rigidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The bellows conjecture |journal=Beiträge zur Algebra und Geometrie |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |year=1997 |author1=R. Connelly |author2=I. Sabitov |author3=A. Walz }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[napkin folding problem]] asks whether it is possible to fold a square so the perimeter of the resulting flat figure is increased. That this can be solved within rigid origami was proved by A.S. Tarasov in  2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Applications==

The [[Miura fold]] is a rigid fold that has been used to pack large [[solar panel]] arrays for space satellites, which have to be folded before deployment.

[[Robert J. Lang]] has applied origami to the problem of folding a space telescope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/psa/pdfs/technologies/eyeglass_space_telescope.pdf |title=The Eyeglass Space Telescope }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Folding paper [[shopping bag]]s is a problem where the rigidity requirement means the classic solution does not work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Folding Paper Shopping Bags |url=http://martindemaine.org/papers/PaperBag_CGW2004/ |journal=Abstracts from the 14th Annual Fall Workshop on Computational Geometry |publisher=Cambridge, Massachusetts |date=November 2004 |pages=14–15| author=Devin. J. Balkcom, [[Erik Demaine|Erik D. Demaine]], [[Martin Demaine|Martin L. Demaine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recreational uses==

[[Martin Gardner]] has popularised [[flexagon]]s which are a form of rigid origami and the flexatube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal= Wolfram MathWorld|title=Flexatube|author=Weisstein, Eric W.|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Flexatube.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kaleidocycle]]s are toys, usually made of paper, which give an effect similar to a kaleidoscope when convoluted.

'''Squaring the circle''' is a problem proposed by [[classical antiquity|ancient]] [[geometers]]. It is the challenge of constructing a [[square (geometry)|square]] with the same area as a given [[circle]] by using only a finite number of steps with [[compass and straightedge]]. It may be taken to ask whether specified [[axiom]]s of [[Euclidean geometry]] concerning the existence of lines and circles entail the existence of such a square.

In 1882, the task was proven to be impossible, as a consequence of the [[Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem]] which proves that [[pi]] ({{pi}}) is a [[Transcendental number|transcendental]], rather than an algebraic irrational number; that is, it is not the [[zero of a function|root]] of any [[polynomial]] with [[Rational number|rational]] coefficients. It had been known for some decades before then that the construction would be impossible if {{pi}} were transcendental, but {{pi}} was not proven transcendental until 1882. Approximate squaring to any given non-perfect accuracy, in contrast, is possible in a finite number of steps, since there are rational numbers arbitrarily close to {{pi}}.

The expression "squaring the circle" is sometimes used as a metaphor for trying to do the impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ammer|first=Christine|title=Square the Circle. Dictionary.com. The American Heritage® Dictionary of Idioms|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/square%20the%20circle|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[numerical integration|quadrature]] of the circle'' is sometimes used to mean the same thing as squaring the circle, but it may also refer to approximate or numerical methods for finding the area of a circle.

==History==
Methods to approximate the area of a given circle with a square, which can be thought of as a precursor problem to squaring the circle, were known already to [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonian mathematicians]]. The Egyptian [[Rhind papyrus]] of 1800 BC gives the area of a circle as (64/81)&amp;nbsp;{{math|''d''}}&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where {{math|''d''}} is the diameter of the circle. In modern terms, this is equivalent to approximating pi({{pi}}) by 256/81, a number that appears in the older [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus]] and is used for volume approximations (i.e. [[hekat (volume unit)|hekat]]). [[Indian mathematics|Indian mathematicians]] also found an approximate method, though less accurate, documented in the ''[[Shulba Sutras]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author1=O'Connor, John J.  |author2=Robertson, Edmund F.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2000|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Indian_sulbasutras.html|title=The Indian Sulbasutras|work=MacTutor History of Mathematics archive|publisher=St Andrews University}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archimedes]] proved the formula for the area of a circle ({{math|1=''A'' = {{pi}}''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where {{mvar|r}} is the radius of the circle) and showed that the value of {{pi}} lay between 3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1/7 (approximately 3.1429) and 3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;10/71 (approximately 3.1408). See [[Numerical approximations of π]] for more on the history.

The first known Greek to be associated with the problem was [[Anaxagoras]], who worked on it while in prison. [[Hippocrates of Chios]] squared certain [[Lune (mathematics)|lunes]], in the hope that it would lead to a solution — see [[Lune of Hippocrates]]. [[Antiphon the Sophist]] believed that inscribing regular polygons within a circle and doubling the number of sides will eventually fill up the area of the circle, and since a polygon can be squared, it means the circle can be squared. Even then there were skeptics—[[Eudemus of Rhodes|Eudemus]] argued that magnitudes cannot be divided up without limit, so the area of the circle will never be used up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Heath | first = Thomas | year = 1981 | title = History of Greek Mathematics | publisher = Courier Dover Publications| isbn = 0-486-24074-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was even mentioned in [[Aristophanes]]'s play ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]''.

It is believed that [[Oenopides]] was the first Greek who required a plane solution (that is, using only a compass and straightedge). [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] attempted a proof of its impossibility in ''Vera Circuli et Hyperbolae Quadratura'' (The True Squaring of the Circle and of the Hyperbola) in 1667.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gregory |first1=James |title=Vera Circuli et Hyperbolæ Quadratura … |trans-title=The true squaring of the circle and of the hyperbola … |date=1667 |publisher=Giacomo Cadorino |location=Padua (Padova (It.), Patavium (Lat.)), (Italy)}}  Available at:  [https://www.e-rara.ch/zut/wihibe/content/titleinfo/1254563 ETH Bibliothek (Zürich, Switzerland)]&lt;/ref&gt; Although his proof was faulty, it was the first paper to attempt to solve the problem using algebraic properties of {{pi}}. It was not until 1882 that [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]] rigorously proved its impossibility.

[[Image:Quadrature of Circle Cajori 1919.png|right|thumb|A partial history by [[Florian Cajori]] of attempts at the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Florian Cajori|title=A History of Mathematics|edition=2nd|page= 143|location= New York|publisher= The Macmillan Company|year=1919|url=https://archive.org/details/ahistorymathema03cajogoog/page/n156}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] The Victorian-age mathematician, logician and author, [[Lewis Carroll|Charles Lutwidge Dodgson]] (better known under the pseudonym "Lewis Carroll") also expressed interest in debunking illogical circle-squaring theories. In one of his diary entries for 1855, Dodgson listed books he hoped to write including one called "Plain Facts for Circle-Squarers". In the introduction to "A New Theory of Parallels", Dodgson recounted an attempt to demonstrate logical errors to a couple of circle-squarers, stating:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first of these two misguided visionaries filled me with a great ambition to do a feat I have never heard of as accomplished by man, namely to convince a circle squarer of his error! The value my friend selected for Pi was 3.2: the enormous error tempted me with the idea that it could be easily demonstrated to BE an error. More than a score of letters were interchanged before I became sadly convinced that I had no chance.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A ridiculing of circle-squaring appears in [[Augustus de Morgan]]'s [[A Budget of Paradoxes]] published posthumously by his widow in 1872. Having originally published the work as a series of articles in the ''Athenæum'', he was revising it for publication at the time of his death. Circle squaring was very popular in the nineteenth century, but hardly anyone indulges in it today and it is believed that de Morgan's work helped bring this about.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Underwood|last=Dudley|title=A Budget of Trisections|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1987|isbn=0-387-96568-8|pages=xi–xii|ref=harv}} Reprinted as ''The Trisectors''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impossibility==
The solution of the problem of squaring the circle by compass and straightedge requires the construction of the number &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{\pi}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{\pi}&lt;/math&gt; is [[constructible number|constructible]], it follows from [[Straightedge and compass|standard constructions]] that &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; would also be constructible. In 1837, [[Pierre Wantzel]] showed that lengths that could be constructed with compass and straightedge had to be solutions of certain polynomial equations with rational coefficients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wantzel |first1=L. |title=Recherches sur les moyens de reconnaître si un problème de géométrie peut se résoudre avec la règle et le compas |journal=Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées |date=1837 |volume=2 |pages=366–372 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433110146044;view=1up;seq=380 |trans-title=Investigations into means of knowing if a problem of geometry can be solved with a straightedge and compass |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cajori, Florian|title=Pierre Laurent Wantzel|journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.|year=1918|volume=24|issue=7|pages=339–347|mr=1560082|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1918-03088-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, constructible lengths must be [[algebraic number]]s. If the problem of the quadrature of the circle could be solved using only compass and straightedge, then {{pi}} would have to be an algebraic number. [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] conjectured that {{pi}} was not algebraic, that is, a [[transcendental number]], in 1761.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lambert|first=Johann Heinrich|title=Mémoire sur quelques propriétés remarquables des quantités transcendentes circulaires et logarithmiques |trans-title=Memoir on some remarkable properties of circular transcendental and logarithmic quantities |publication-date=1768|date=1761|journal=Histoire de l'Académie Royale des Sciences et des Belles-Lettres de Berlin |volume=17|pages=265–322 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433009864251;view=1up;seq=303 |language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; He did this in the same paper in which he proved its [[irrational number|irrationality]], even before the general existence of transcendental numbers had been proven. It was not until 1882 that [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]] proved the transcendence of {{pi}} and so showed the impossibility of this construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lindemann |first1=F. |title=Über die Zahl π |journal=Mathematische Annalen |date=1882 |volume=20 |pages=213–225 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044102917051;view=1up;seq=237 |trans-title=On the number π |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The transcendence of {{pi}} implies the impossibility of exactly "circling" the square, as well as of squaring the circle.

It is possible to construct a square with an area arbitrarily close to that of a given circle. If a rational number is used as an approximation of {{pi}}, then squaring the circle becomes possible, depending on the values chosen. However, this is only an approximation and does not meet the constraints of the ancient rules for solving the problem. Several mathematicians have demonstrated workable procedures based on a variety of approximations.

Bending the rules by allowing an infinite number of compass-and-straightedge operations or by performing the operations in certain [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]] also makes squaring the circle possible in some sense. For example, although the circle cannot be squared in [[Euclidean space]], it sometimes can be in [[hyperbolic geometry]] under suitable interpretations of the terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/BF03024895   | last = Jagy  | first = William C. | title = Squaring circles in the hyperbolic plane | journal = Mathematical Intelligencer  | volume = 17  | issue = 2  | pages = 31–36  | year = 1995   | url = http://zakuski.math.utsa.edu/~jagy/papers/Intelligencer_1995.pdf   | format = [[Portable Document Format|PDF]]   | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

There exist, in the hyperbolic plane, (countably) infinitely many pairs of constructible circles and constructible regular quadrilaterals of equal area, which, however, are constructed simultaneously.
There is no method for starting with a regular quadrilateral and constructing the circle of equal area, and there is no method for starting with a circle and constructing a regular quadrilateral of equal area (even when the circle has small enough radius such that a regular quadrilateral of equal area exists).

==Modern approximative constructions==
Though squaring the circle is an impossible problem using only compass and straightedge, approximations to squaring the circle can be given by constructing lengths close to&amp;nbsp;{{pi}}.
It takes only minimal knowledge of elementary geometry to convert any given rational approximation of {{pi}} into a corresponding [[compass-and-straightedge construction]], but constructions made in this way tend to be very long-winded in comparison to the accuracy they achieve. After the exact problem was proven unsolvable, some mathematicians applied their ingenuity to finding elegant approximations to squaring the circle, defined roughly and informally as constructions that are particularly simple among other imaginable constructions that give similar precision.

Among the modern approximate constructions was one by [[E. W. Hobson]] in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hobson|first= Ernest William |year=1913|title=Squaring the Circle: A History of the Problem|publisher= Cambridge University Press}} Reprinted by Merchant Books in 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a fairly accurate construction which was based on constructing the approximate value of 3.14164079..., which is accurate to 4 decimals (i.e. it differs from {{pi}} by about {{Val|4.8|e=-5}}).

Indian mathematician [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] in 1913,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=Who Was Ramanujan?|url= http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2016/04/who-was-ramanujan/|publisher=|accessdate=}} See also [http://www.math.tifr.res.in/~publ/nsrBook1.pdf#54 MANUSCRIPT BOOK 1 OF SRINIVASA RAMANUJAN page 54] Both files were retrieved at 23 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl D. Olds|Carl Olds]] in 1963, [[Martin Gardner]] in 1966, and Benjamin Bold in 1982 all gave geometric constructions for
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{355}{113} = 3.1415929203539823008\dots&lt;/math&gt;

which is accurate to six decimal places of&amp;nbsp;{{pi}}.

Srinivasa Ramanujan in 1914 gave a ruler-and-compass construction which was equivalent to taking the approximate value for {{pi}} to be

:&lt;math&gt;\left(9^2 + \frac{19^2}{22}\right)^{1/4} = \sqrt[4]{\frac{2143}{22}} = 3.1415926525826461252\dots&lt;/math&gt;

giving eight decimal places of {{pi}}.&lt;ref&gt;S. A. Ramanujan: [http://ramanujan.sirinudi.org/Volumes/published/ram06.pdf#page=18&amp;zoom=90,-252,741 ''Modular Equations and Approximations to π''] In: Quarterly Journal of Mathematics. ''12.

Then the mean proportional between OS and OB will be very nearly equal to a sixth of the circumference, the error being less than a twelfth of an inch when the diameter is 8000 miles long."''}}

In this quadrature, Ramanujan did not construct the side length of the square, it was enough for him to show the line segment {{Overline|OS}}. In the following continuation of the construction, the line segment {{Overline|OS}} is used together with the line segment {{Overline|OB}} to represent the mean proportionals (red line segment {{Overline|OE}}).

Continuation of the construction up to the searched side length a of the square:

Extend {{Overline|AB}} beyond A and beat the circular arc b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; around O with radius {{Overline|OS}}, it results S'. Bisect the line segment {{Overline|BS'}} in D and draw the semicircle b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over D. Draw a straight line from O through C up to the semicircle b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, it cuts b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in E. The line segment {{Overline|OE}} is the mean proportional between {{Overline|OS}} and {{Overline|OB}}, also called [[geometric mean]]. Extend the line segment {{Overline|EO}} beyond O and transfer {{Overline|EO}} twice more, it results F and A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and thus the length of the line segment {{Overline|EA1}} with the above described approximation value of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, the half circumference of the circle. Bisect the line segment {{Overline|EA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} in G and draw the semicircle b&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; over G. Transfer the distance {{Overline|OB}} from A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to the line segment {{Overline|EA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, it results H. Create a vertical from H up to the semicircle b&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; on {{Overline|EA&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, it results B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Connect A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, thus the searched side &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; of the square A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is constructed, which has nearly the same area as the given circle.

Examples to illustrate the errors:
* In a circle of radius r = 10,000 km would be the fault of the side length a ≈ -2.8 mm 
* In the case of a circle with the radius r = 10 m would be the error of the surface A ≈ -0.1 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

In 1991, [[Robert Dixon (mathematician)|Robert Dixon]] gave constructions for

([[Kochański's approximation]]), though these were only accurate to four decimal places of {{pi}}.

:&lt;math&gt; 1{.}77245384141934376\dots^2 = 3.141592619962188 \dots &lt;/math&gt;

==Squaring or quadrature as integration==
The problem of finding the area under a curve, known as [[Integral|integration]] in [[calculus]], or [[numerical quadrature|quadrature]] in [[numerical analysis]], was known as ''squaring'' before the invention of calculus.  Since the techniques of calculus were unknown, it was generally presumed that a squaring should be done via geometric constructions, that is, by compass and straightedge.  For example, [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] wrote to [[Henry Oldenburg|Oldenburg]] in 1676 "I believe M. Leibnitz will not dislike the Theorem towards the beginning of my letter pag. 4 for '''squaring Curve lines''' Geometrically" (emphasis added).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OVPJ6c9_kKgC&amp;pg=PA259&amp;vq=squaring&amp;dq=newton+squaring-curves+date:0-1923|title=Correspondence of Sir Isaac Newton and Professor Cotes: Including letters of other eminent men|author1=Cotes|first1=Roger|year=1850}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After Newton and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] invented calculus, they still referred to this integration problem as squaring a curve.

==Claims of circle squaring==

===Connection with the longitude problem===
The mathematical proof that the [[numerical integration|quadrature]] of the circle is impossible using only compass and straightedge has not proved to be a hindrance to the many people who have invested years in this problem anyway.  Having squared the circle is a famous [[crank (person)|crank]] assertion. (''See also'' [[pseudomathematics]].) In his old age, the English philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] convinced himself that he had succeeded in squaring the circle.

During the 18th and 19th century, the notion that the problem of squaring the circle was somehow related to the [[History of longitude#Problem of longitude|longitude problem]] seems to have become prevalent among would-be circle squarers. Using "cyclometer" for circle-squarer, [[Augustus de Morgan]] wrote in 1872:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Jean Etienne Montucla|Montucla]] says, speaking of France, that he finds three notions prevalent among cyclometers: 1. That there is a large reward offered for success; 2. That the longitude problem depends on that success; 3. That the solution is the great end and object of geometry. The same three notions are equally prevalent among the same class in England. No reward has ever been offered by the government of either country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Augustus de Morgan]] |year=1872|title=[[A Budget of Paradoxes]]|page= 96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although from 1714 to 1828 the British government did indeed sponsor a £20,000 prize for finding a solution to the longitude problem, exactly why the connection was made to squaring the circle is not clear; especially since two non-geometric methods (the astronomical [[Lunar distance (navigation)|method of lunar distances]] and the mechanical [[marine chronometer|chronometer]]) had been found by the late 1760s. De Morgan goes on to say that "[t]he longitude problem in no way depends upon perfect solution; existing approximations are sufficient to a point of accuracy far beyond what can be wanted." In his book, de Morgan also mentions receiving many threatening letters from would-be circle squarers, accusing him of trying to "cheat them out of their prize".

===Other modern claims===
Even after it had been proved impossible, in 1894, amateur mathematician Edwin J. Goodwin claimed that he had developed a method to square the circle. The technique he developed did not accurately square the circle, and provided an incorrect area of the circle which essentially redefined pi as equal to 3.2. Goodwin then proposed the [[Indiana Pi Bill]] in the Indiana state legislature allowing the state to use his method in education without paying royalties to him. The bill passed with no objections in the state house, but the bill was tabled and never voted on in the Senate, amid increasing ridicule from the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Numberphile|title=How Pi was nearly changed to 3.2 - Numberphile|date=2013-03-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFNjA9LOPsg|accessdate=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem of squaring the circle has been mentioned by poets such as [[Dante]] and [[Alexander Pope]], with varied [[metaphor]]ical meanings. Its literary use dates back at least to 414 BC, when the play [[The Birds (play)|The Birds]] by [[Aristophanes]] was first performed. In it, the character [[Meton of Athens]] mentions squaring the circle, possibly to indicate the paradoxical nature of his utopian city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Amati | first = Matthew

Dante's ''Paradise'' canto XXXIII lines 133–135 contain the verses:
&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;
As the geometer his mind applies
To square the circle, nor for all his wit
Finds the right formula, howe'er he tries&lt;/poem&gt;
For Dante, squaring the circle represents a task beyond human comprehension, which he compares to his own inability to comprehend Paradise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Herzman | first1 = Ronald B.

By 1742, when [[Alexander Pope]] published the fourth book of his [[Dunciad]], attempts at circle-squaring had come to be seen as "wild and fruitless":&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Schepler | first = Herman C.

Similarly, the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] comic opera ''[[Princess Ida]]'' features a song which satirically lists the impossible goals of the women's university run by the title character, such as finding [[perpetual motion]].  One of these goals is "And the circle – they will square it/Some fine day."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Dolid | first = William A.

He writes that "Vivie naturally knew better than to try to square circles."&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[sestina]], a poetic form first used in the 12th century by [[Arnaut Daniel]], has been said to square the circle in its use of a square number of lines (six stanzas of six lines each) with a circular scheme of six repeated words. {{harvtxt|Spanos|1978}} writes that this form invokes a symbolic meaning in which the circle stands for heaven and the square stands for the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Sestina: An Exploration of the Dynamics of Poetic Structure|first=Margaret|last=Spanos|journal=Speculum|volume=53|issue=3|year=1978|pages=545–557|jstor=2855144|ref=harv|doi=10.2307/2855144}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A similar metaphor was used in "Squaring The Circle", a 1908 short story by [[O. Henry]], about a long-running family feud. In the title of this story, the circle represents the natural world, while the square represents the city, the world of man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Twentieth-century American literature|first=Harold|last=Bloom|authorlink=Harold Bloom|publisher=Chelsea House Publishers|year=1987|isbn=9780877548034|page=1848|quote=Similarly, the story "Squaring the Circle" is permeated with the integrating image: nature is a circle, the city a square.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', Leopold Bloom dreams of becoming wealthy by squaring the circle, unaware that the quadrature of the circle had been proved impossible 22 years earlier and that the British government had never offered a reward for its solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Pendrick | first = Gerard

In [[Thomas Mann]]'s ''[[The Magic Mountain]]'', Lawyer Paravant is tragically obsessed with squaring the circle, probably in response to a failed love affair. He becomes lost in his "obsessive attempt to square the circle, an impossible operation which he believes he will be able to perform at the Berghof, because of the sanitarium's vertiginous elevation above the 'flatland'". His endeavour "takes a dissipatory turn, and is eventually denounced at the sanitarium as 'mystic hocus-pocus'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |type=PhD |last=Goggin |first=Joyce |date=1997 |page=196|title=The Big Deal: Card Games in 20th-Century Fiction |publisher=University of Montréal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1632">The '''Steane code''' is a tool in [[quantum error correction]] introduced by [[Andrew Steane]] in 1996. It is a [[Hamming_bound#Perfect_codes|perfect]] [[CSS code]] (Calderbank-Shor-Steane), using the classical binary  [7,4,3] [[Hamming code]] to correct for [[qubit]] flip errors (X errors) and the [[dual (mathematics)|dual]] of the Hamming code, the [7,3,4] code, to correct for phase flip errors (Z errors). The Steane code is able to correct arbitrary single qubit errors. 

In the [[stabilizer formalism]], the Steane code has 6 generators, and the [[check matrix]] in [[canonical form|standard form]] is 
: &lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix}
    H &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; H
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where H is the [[parity-check matrix]] of the Hamming code and is given by

: &lt;math&gt;
H =   \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\
    0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1
  \end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;[[7,1,3]]&lt;/math&gt; Steane code is the first in the family of quantum Hamming codes, codes with parameters &lt;math&gt;[[2^r-1, 2^r-1-2r, 3]]&lt;/math&gt; for integers &lt;math&gt;r \geq 3&lt;/math&gt;.  It is also a quantum color code.

In [[computer science]], a '''tagged union''', also called a '''[[variant type|variant]]''', '''variant record''', '''choice type''', '''discriminated union''', '''[[disjoint union]]''', or '''sum type''', is a [[data structure]] used to hold a value that could take on several different, but fixed, types. Only one of the types can be in use at any one time, and a '''tag''' field explicitly indicates which one is in use. It can be thought of as a type that has several "cases," each of which should be handled correctly when that type is manipulated. Like ordinary [[Union (computer science)|unions]], tagged unions can save storage by overlapping storage areas for each type, since only one is in use at a time.

Tagged unions are most important in [[functional language]]s such as [[ML programming language|ML]] and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], where they are called '''datatypes''' (see [[algebraic data type]]) and the compiler is able to verify that all cases of a tagged union are always handled, avoiding many types of errors. They can, however, be constructed in nearly any [[Programming language|language]], and are much safer than untagged unions, often simply called unions, which are similar but do not explicitly keep track of which member of the union is currently in use.

Tagged unions are often accompanied by the concept of a [[type constructor]], which is similar but not the same as a [[constructor (computer science)|constructor]] for a class. Type constructors produce a tagged union type, given the initial tag type and the corresponding type.

Mathematically, tagged unions correspond to ''[[disjoint union|disjoint]]'' or ''discriminated unions'', usually written using +. Given an element of a disjoint union ''A'' + ''B'',  it is possible to determine whether it came from ''A'' or ''B''. If an element lies in both, there will be two effectively distinct copies of the value in ''A'' + ''B'', one from ''A'' and one from ''B''.

In [[type theory]], a tagged union is called a '''sum type'''.  Sum types are the [[dual (mathematics)|dual]] of [[product type]]s.  Notations vary, but usually the sum type &lt;math&gt;A+B&lt;/math&gt; comes with two introduction forms &lt;math&gt;\text{inj}_1\colon A \to A+B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\text{inj}_2\colon B \to A+B&lt;/math&gt;.  The elimination form is case analysis, known as [[pattern matching]] in [[ML (programming language)|ML-style]] programming languages: if &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;A+B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e_2&lt;/math&gt; have type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; under the assumptions &lt;math&gt;x\colon A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y\colon B&lt;/math&gt; respectively, then the term 
&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{case}\ e\ \mathsf{of}\ x \Rightarrow e_1 \mid y \Rightarrow e_2&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.  The sum type corresponds to intuitionistic [[logical disjunction]] under the [[Curry–Howard correspondence]].

An [[enumerated type]] can be seen as a degenerate case: a tagged union of [[unit type]]s.  It corresponds to a set of nullary constructors and may be implemented as a simple tag variable, since it holds no additional data besides the value of the tag.

Many programming techniques and data structures –
including [[rope (data structure)]], [[lazy evaluation]], [[class hierarchy]] (see below), [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic]], [[CDR coding]], the [[indirection bit]] and other kinds of [[tagged pointer]]s, etc.  –
are usually implemented using some sort of tagged union.

A tagged union can be seen as the simplest kind of [[self-describing]] [[comparison of data serialization formats|data format]].
The tag of the tagged union can be seen as the simplest kind of [[metadata]].

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The primary advantage of a tagged union over an untagged union is that all accesses are safe, and the compiler can even check that all cases are handled. Untagged unions depend on program logic to correctly identify the currently active field, which may result in strange behavior and hard-to-find bugs if that logic fails.

The primary advantage of a tagged union over a simple [[record (computer science)|record]] containing a field for each type is that it saves storage by overlapping storage for all the types. Some implementations reserve enough storage for the largest type, while others dynamically adjust the size of a tagged union value as needed. When the value is [[Immutable object|immutable]], it is simple to allocate just as much storage as is needed.

The main disadvantage of tagged unions is that the tag occupies space. Since there are usually a small number of alternatives, the tag can often be squeezed into 2 or 3 bits wherever space can be found, but sometimes even these bits are not available. In this case, a helpful alternative may be '''folded''', '''computed''' or '''encoded tags''', where the tag value is dynamically computed from the contents of the union field. Common examples of this are the use of ''reserved values'', where, for example, a function returning a positive number may return -1 to indicate failure, and [[sentinel value]]s, most often used in [[tagged pointer]]s.

Sometimes, untagged unions are used to perform bit-level conversions between types, called reinterpret casts in C++. Tagged unions are not intended for this purpose; typically a new value is assigned whenever the tag is changed.

Many languages support, to some extent, a [[Top type|universal data type]], which is a type that includes every value of every other type, and often a way is provided to test the actual type of a value of the universal type. These are sometimes referred to as ''variants''. While universal data types are comparable to tagged unions in their formal definition, typical tagged unions include a relatively small number of cases, and these cases form different ways of expressing a single coherent concept, such as a data structure node or instruction. Also, there is an expectation that every possible case of a tagged union will be dealt with when it is used. The values of a universal data type are not related and there is no feasible way to deal with them all.

Like [[option type]]s and [[exception handling]], tagged unions are sometimes used to handle the occurrence of exceptional results.  Often these tags are folded into the type as "reserved values", and their occurrence is not consistently checked: this is a fairly common source of programming errors.  This use of tagged unions can be formalized as a [[monads in functional programming|monad]] with the following functions:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{return}\colon A \to \left( A + E \right) = a \mapsto \text{value} \, a&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{bind}\colon \left( A + E \right) \to \left(A \to \left(B + E \right) \right) \to \left( B + E \right) = a \mapsto f \mapsto \begin{cases} \text{err} \, e &amp; \text{if} \ a = \text{err} \, e\\ f \, a' &amp; \text{if} \ a = \text{value} \, a' \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

where "value" and "err" are the constructors of the union type, ''A'' and ''B'' are valid result types and ''E'' is the type of error conditions.  Alternately, the same monad may be described by ''return'' and two additional functions, ''fmap'' and ''join'':

:&lt;math&gt;\text{fmap} \colon (A \to B) \to \left( \left( A + E \right) \to \left( B + E \right) \right) = f \mapsto a \mapsto \begin{cases} \text{err} \, e &amp; \text{if} \ a = \text{err} \, e \\ \text{value} \, \text{(} \, f \, a' \, \text{)} &amp; \text{if} \ a = \text{value} \, a' \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{join} \colon ((A + E ) + E) \to (A + E) = a \mapsto \begin{cases} \text{err} \, e &amp; \mbox{if} \ a = \text{err} \, e\\ \text{err} \, e &amp; \text{if} \ a = \text{value} \, \text{(err} \, e \, \text{)} \\ \text{value} \, a' &amp; \text{if} \ a = \text{value} \, \text{(value} \, a' \, \text{)} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
Say we wanted to build a [[binary tree]] of integers. In ML, we would do this by creating a datatype like this:

&lt;source lang="sml"&gt;
datatype tree = Leaf
              | Node of (int * tree * tree)
&lt;/source&gt;

This is a tagged union with two cases: one, the leaf, is used to terminate a path of the tree, and functions much like a null value would in imperative languages. The other branch holds a node, which contains an integer and a left and right subtree. Leaf and Node are the constructors, which enable us to actually produce a particular tree, such as:

&lt;source lang="sml"&gt;
Node(5, Node(1, Leaf, Leaf), Node(3, Leaf, Node(4, Leaf, Leaf)))
&lt;/source&gt;

which corresponds to this tree:

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:tagged_union_tree.svg|The tree produced by the above constructors]]&lt;/center&gt;

Now we can easily write a typesafe function that, say, counts the number of nodes in the tree:

&lt;source lang="sml"&gt;
fun countNodes(Leaf) = 0
  | countNodes(Node(int, left, right)) =
      1 + countNodes(left) + countNodes(right)
&lt;/source&gt;

==Timeline of language support==

===1960s===
In [[ALGOL 68]], tagged unions are called ''united modes'', the tag is implicit, and the &lt;code&gt;'''case'''&lt;/code&gt; construct is used to determine which field is tagged:

&lt;code&gt;'''mode''' '''node''' = '''union''' ('''real''', '''int''', '''compl''', '''string''');&lt;/code&gt;

Usage example for &lt;code&gt;'''union'''&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;'''case'''&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;'''node'''&lt;/code&gt;:

 '''node''' n := "1234";
 &amp;nbsp;
 '''case''' n '''in'''
   ('''real''' r):   print(("real:", r)),
   ('''int''' i):    print(("int:", i)),
   ('''compl''' c):  print(("compl:", c)),
   ('''string''' s): print(("string:", s))
   '''out'''         print(("?:", n))
 '''esac'''

===1970s &amp; 1980s===
Although primarily only [[functional programming language|functional languages]] such as [[ML programming language|ML]] and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] (from 1990s) give a central role to tagged unions and have the power to check that all cases are handled, other languages have support for tagged unions as well. However, in practice they can be less efficient in non-functional languages due to optimizations enabled by functional language compilers that can eliminate explicit tag checks and [[Type erasure|avoid explicit storage of tags]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

[[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], [[Ada programming language|Ada]], and [[Modula-2]] call them '''variant records''' (formally '''discriminated type''' in Ada), and require the tag field to be manually created and the tag values specified, as in this Pascal example:

&lt;source lang="pascal"&gt;
type shapeKind = (square, rectangle, circle);
     shape = record
                centerx : integer;
                centery : integer;
                case kind : shapeKind of
                   square : (side : integer);
                   rectangle : (length, height : integer);
                   circle : (radius : integer);
	      end;
&lt;/source&gt;

and this Ada equivalent:
&lt;source lang="ada"&gt;
type Shape_Kind is (Square, Rectangle, Circle);
type Shape (Kind : Shape_Kind) is record
   Center_X : Integer;
   Center_Y : Integer;
   case Kind is
      when Square =&gt;
         Side : Integer;
      when Rectangle =&gt;
         Length, Height : Integer;
      when Circle =&gt;
         Radius : Integer;
   end case;
end record;

-- Any attempt to access a member whose existence depends
-- on a particular value of the discriminant, while the
-- discriminant is not the expected one, raises an error.
&lt;/source&gt;

In [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]], a tagged union can be created from untagged unions using a strict access discipline where the tag is always checked:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
enum ShapeKind { Square, Rectangle, Circle };

struct Shape {
    int centerx;
    int centery;
    enum ShapeKind kind;
    union {
        struct { int side; };           /* Square */
        struct { int length, height; }; /* Rectangle */
        struct { int radius; };         /* Circle */
    };
};

int getSquareSide(struct Shape* s) {
    assert(s-&gt;kind == Square);
    return s-&gt;side;
}

void setSquareSide(struct Shape* s, int side) {
    s-&gt;kind = Square;
    s-&gt;side = side;
}

/* and so on */
&lt;/source&gt;

As long as the union fields are only accessed through the functions, the accesses will be safe and correct. The same approach can be used for encoded tags; we simply decode the tag and then check it on each access. If the inefficiency of these tag checks is a concern, they may be automatically removed in the final version.

C and C++ also have language support for one particular tagged union: the possibly-null [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointer]]. This may be compared to the &lt;code&gt;option&lt;/code&gt; type in ML or the &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; type in Haskell, and can be seen as a [[tagged pointer]]: a tagged union (with an encoded tag) of two types:
* Valid pointers,
* A type with only one value, &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, indicating an exceptional condition.
Unfortunately, C compilers do not verify that the null case is always handled, and this is a particularly prevalent source of errors in C code, since there is a tendency to ignore exceptional cases.

===2000s===
One advanced dialect of C called [[Cyclone programming language|Cyclone]] has extensive built-in support for tagged unions.&lt;ref&gt;http://cyclone.thelanguage.org/wiki/Tagged%20Unions&lt;/ref&gt;

The enum types in the [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]] and [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]] languages also work as tagged unions.

The variant library from [[Boost C++ Libraries|Boost]] has demonstrated it was possible to implement a safe tagged union as a library in C++, visitable using function objects.
&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
struct display : boost::static_visitor&lt;void&gt;
{
    void operator()(int i)
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "It's an int, with value " &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }

    void operator()(const std::string&amp; s)
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "It's a string, with value " &lt;&lt; s &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }
};

boost::variant&lt;int, std::string&gt; v = 42;
boost::apply_visitor(display(), v);

boost::variant&lt;int, std::string&gt; v = "hello world";
boost::apply_visitor(display(), v);
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] has case classes:
&lt;source lang="scala"&gt;
sealed abstract class Tree
case object Leaf extends Tree
case class Node(value: Int, left: Tree, right: Tree) extends Tree

val tree = Node(5, Node(1, Leaf, Leaf), Node(3, Leaf, Node(4, Leaf, Leaf)))
&lt;/source&gt;

Because the class hierarchy is sealed, the compiler can check that all cases are handled in a pattern match:
&lt;source lang="scala"&gt;
tree match {
  case Node(x, _, _) =&gt; println("top level node value: " + x)
  case Leaf          =&gt; println("top level node is a leaf")
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Scala's case classes also permit reuse through subtyping:

&lt;source lang="scala"&gt;
sealed abstract class Shape(centerX: Int, centerY: Int)
case class Square(side: Int, centerX: Int, centerY: Int) extends Shape(centerX, centerY)
case class Rectangle(length: Int, height: Int, centerX: Int, centerY: Int) extends Shape(centerX, centerY)
case class Circle(radius: Int, centerX: Int, centerY: Int) extends Shape(centerX, centerY)
&lt;/source&gt;

[[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]] has discriminated unions:

&lt;source lang="fsharp"&gt;
type Tree =
  | Leaf
  | Node of value: int * left: Tree * right: Tree

let tree = Node(5, Node(1, Leaf, Leaf), Node(3, Leaf, Node(4, Leaf, Leaf)))
&lt;/source&gt;

Because the defined cases are exhaustive, the compiler can check that all cases are handled in a pattern match:
&lt;source lang="fsharp"&gt;
match tree with
| Node (x, _, _) -&gt; printfn "top level node value: %i" x
| Leaf           -&gt; printfn "top level node is a leaf"
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Haxe]]'s enums also work as tagged unions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using Enums - Haxe - The Cross-platform Toolkit|url=https://haxe.org/manual/types-enum-using.html|publisher=Haxe Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
&lt;source lang="haxe"&gt;
enum Color {
  Red;
  Green;
  Blue;
  Rgb(r:Int, g:Int, b:Int);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

These can be matched using a switch expression:
&lt;source lang="haxe"&gt;
switch (color) {
  case Red: trace("Color was red");
  case Green: trace("Color was green");
  case Blue: trace("Color was blue");
  case Rgb(r, g, b): trace("Color had a red value of " +r);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== 2010s ===

The [[Rust (programming language)|Rust language]] has extensive support for tagged unions, called enums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rust Programming Language|url=http://rustbyexample.com/custom_types/structs.html|publisher=Mozilla}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example:
&lt;source lang="rust"&gt;
enum Tree {
  Leaf,
  Node(i64, Box&lt;Tree&gt;, Box&lt;Tree&gt;)
}
&lt;/source&gt;

It also allows matching on unions:

&lt;source lang="rust"&gt;
let tree = Tree::Node(
  2,
  Box::new(Tree::Node(0, Box::new(Tree::Leaf), Box::new(Tree::Leaf))),
  Box::new(Tree::Node(3, Box::new(Tree::Leaf),
    Box::new(Tree::Node(4, Box::new(Tree::Leaf), Box::new(Tree::Leaf)))))
);

fn add_values(tree: Tree) -&gt; i64 {
  match tree {
      Tree::Node(v, a, b) =&gt; v + add_values(*a) + add_values(*b),
      Tree::Leaf =&gt; 0
  }
}

assert_eq!(add_values(tree), 9);
&lt;/source&gt;

Rust's error handling model relies extensively on these tagged unions, especially the &lt;code&gt;Option&lt;T&gt;&lt;/code&gt; type, which is either &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Some(T)&lt;/code&gt;, and the &lt;code&gt;Result&lt;T, E&gt;&lt;/code&gt; type, which is either &lt;code&gt;Ok(T)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Err(E)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rust By Example|url=https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/error-handling.html#the-option-type|publisher=Mozilla}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Class hierarchies as tagged unions ==
In a typical [[class hierarchy]] in [[object-oriented programming]], each subclass can encapsulate data unique to that class. The metadata used to perform [[virtual method]] lookup (for example, the object's [[virtual method table|vtable]] pointer in most C++ implementations) identifies the subclass and so effectively acts as a tag identifying the particular data stored by the instance (see [[RTTI]]).
An object's [[Constructor (computer science)|constructor]] sets this tag, and it remains constant throughout the object's lifetime.

Nevertheless, a class hierarchy involves true [[subtype polymorphism]]; it can be extended by creating further subclasses of the same base type, which could not be handled correctly under a tag/dispatch model.  Hence, it is usually not possible to do case analysis or dispatch on a subobject's 'tag' as one would for tagged unions.  Some languages such as [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] allow base classes to be "sealed", and unify tagged unions with sealed base classes.

In [[geometry]], the '''tangent cone''' is a generalization of the notion of the [[tangent space]] to a [[manifold]] to the case of certain spaces with singularities.

== Definitions in nonlinear analysis ==
In nonlinear analysis, there are many definitions for a tangent cone, including the [[adjacent cone]], [[Georges Bouligand|Bouligand]]'s [[contingent cone]], and the [[Clarke tangent cone]]. These three cones coincide for a convex set, but they can differ on more general sets.

== Definition in convex geometry ==

Let ''K'' be a [[closed set|closed]] [[convex subset]] of a real [[vector space]] ''V'' and ∂''K'' be the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of ''K''. The '''solid tangent cone''' to ''K'' at a point ''x'' ∈ ∂''K'' is the [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] of the cone formed by all half-lines (or rays)  emanating from ''x'' and intersecting ''K'' in at least one point ''y'' distinct from ''x''. It is a [[convex cone]] in ''V'' and can also be defined as the intersection of the closed [[Half-space (geometry)|half-space]]s of ''V'' containing ''K'' and bounded by the [[supporting hyperplane]]s of ''K'' at ''x''. The boundary ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt; of the solid tangent cone is the '''tangent cone''' to ''K'' and ∂''K'' at ''x''. If this is an [[affine subspace]] of ''V'' then the point ''x'' is called a '''smooth point''' of ∂''K'' and ∂''K'' is said to be '''differentiable''' at ''x'' and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt; is the ordinary [[tangent space]] to ∂''K'' at ''x''.
&lt;!--- Incorporate this formula, but think about the best way of doing it
:&lt;math&gt;
T_K(x) = \overline{\bigcup_{\epsilon&gt;0} \epsilon(K-x)}. &lt;/math&gt;
---&gt;

== Definition in algebraic geometry ==

[[File:Node (algebraic geometry).png|thumb|right|200px|y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (red) with tangent cone (blue)]]

Let ''X'' be an [[affine algebraic variety]] embedded into the affine space &lt;math&gt;k^n&lt;/math&gt;, with defining ideal &lt;math&gt;I\subset  k[x_1,\ldots ,x_n]&lt;/math&gt;. For any polynomial ''f'', let &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{in}(f)&lt;/math&gt; be the homogeneous component of ''f'' of the lowest degree, the ''initial term'' of ''f'', and let 

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{in}(I)\subset  k[x_1,\ldots ,x_n]&lt;/math&gt; 

be the homogeneous ideal which is formed by the initial terms &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{in}(f)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;f \in I&lt;/math&gt;, the ''initial ideal'' of ''I''. The '''tangent cone''' to ''X'' at the origin is the Zariski closed subset of &lt;math&gt;k^n&lt;/math&gt; defined by the ideal &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{in}(I)&lt;/math&gt;. By shifting the coordinate system, this definition extends to an arbitrary point of &lt;math&gt;k^n&lt;/math&gt; in place of the origin. The tangent cone serves as the extension of the notion of the tangent space to ''X'' at a regular point, where ''X'' most closely resembles a [[differentiable manifold]], to all of ''X''. (The tangent cone at a point of &lt;math&gt;k^n&lt;/math&gt; that is not contained in ''X'' is empty.)

For example, the nodal curve

: &lt;math&gt;C: y^2=x^3+x^2 &lt;/math&gt;

is singular at the origin, because both [[partial derivative]]s of ''f''(''x'', ''y'') = ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; vanish at (0, 0). Thus the [[Zariski tangent space]] to ''C'' at the origin is the whole plane, and has higher dimension than the curve itself (two versus one). On the other hand, the tangent cone is the union of the tangent lines to the two branches of ''C'' at the origin,

: &lt;math&gt; x=y,\quad x=-y. &lt;/math&gt;

Its defining ideal is the principal ideal of ''k''[''x''] generated by the initial term of ''f'', namely ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.

The definition of the tangent cone can be extended to abstract algebraic varieties, and even to general [[Noetherian]] [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]]. Let ''X'' be an [[algebraic variety]], ''x'' a point of ''X'', and (''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X'',''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m'') be the [[local ring]] of ''X'' at ''x''. Then the '''tangent cone''' to ''X'' at ''x'' is the [[spectrum of a ring|spectrum]] of the [[associated graded ring]] of ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''X'',''x''&lt;/sub&gt; with respect to the [[Completion (ring theory)#I-adic topology|''m''-adic filtration]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{gr}_m O_{X,x}=\bigoplus_{i\geq 0} m^i / m^{i+1}.&lt;/math&gt;
If we look at our previous example, then we can see that graded pieces contain the same information. So let
:&lt;math&gt;
(\mathcal{O}_{X,x},\mathfrak{m}) = \left(\left(\frac{k[x,y]}{(y^2 - x^3 - x^2)}\right)_{(x,y)}, (x,y)\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
then if we expand out the associated graded ring
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\operatorname{gr}_m O_{X,x} &amp;= \frac{\mathcal{O}_{X,x}}{(x,y)} \oplus \frac{(x,y)}{(x,y)^2} \oplus \frac{(x,y)^2}{(x,y)^3} \oplus \cdots \\
&amp;= k \oplus \frac{(x,y)}{(x,y)^2} \oplus \frac{(x,y)^2}{(x,y)^3} \oplus \cdots
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
we can see that the polynomial defining our variety
:&lt;math&gt;
y^2 - x^3 - x^2 \equiv y^2 - x^2
&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\frac{(x,y)^2}{(x,y)^3}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6839">A '''texture mapping unit''' (TMU) is a component in modern [[graphics processing units]] (GPUs). Historically it was a separate physical processor. A TMU is able to rotate, resize, and distort a [[bitmap image]] (performing [[texture sampling]]), to be placed onto an arbitrary plane of a given [[3D model]] as a texture. This process is called [[texture mapping]]. In modern graphics cards it is implemented as a discrete stage in a [[graphics pipeline]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.devhardware.com/c/a/Video-Cards/The-Graphics-Pipeline/|title=Dev Hardware - The Graphics Pipeline|accessdate=11 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas when first introduced it was implemented as a separate processor, e.g. as seen on the [[Voodoo2]] graphics card.

==Background and history==
The TMU came about due to the compute demands of sampling and transforming a flat image (as the texture map) to the correct angle and perspective it would need to be in 3D space. The compute operation is a large [[matrix multiply]], which CPUs of the time (early Pentiums) could not cope with at acceptable performance.

Today (2013), TMUs are part of the [[Shader|shader pipeline]] and decoupled from the [[Render output unit|Render Output Pipelines]] (ROPs). For example, in AMD's Cypress GPU, each shader pipeline (of which there are 20) has four TMUs, giving the GPU 80 TMUs. This is done by chip designers to closely couple shaders and the texture engines they will be working with.

==Geometry==
{{Cat main|Digital geometry}}
[[3D scene|3D scenes]] are generally composed of two things: [[Polygon mesh|3D geometry]], and the textures that cover that geometry. Texture units in a [[video card]] take a texture and 'map' it to a piece of geometry. That is, they wrap the texture around the geometry and produce textured pixels which can then be written to the screen.
Textures can be an actual image, a [[lightmap]], or even [[bump mapping|normal map]]s for advanced surface lighting effects.

==Texture fill rate==
{{Cat main|Fillrate}}
To render a 3D scene, textures are mapped over the top of [[polygon mesh]]es. This is called texture mapping and is accomplished by texture mapping units (TMUs) on the videocard. Texture fill rate is a measure of the speed with which a particular card can perform texture mapping.

Though [[pixel shader]] processing is becoming more important, this number still holds some weight. Best example of this is the X1600 XT. This card has a 3 to 1 ratio of pixel shader processors/texture mapping units. As a result, the X1600 XT achieves lower performance when compared to other GPUs of the same era and class (such as nVidia's 7600GT) {{fact|date=April 2013}}. In the mid range, texture mapping can still very much be a bottleneck.
However, at the high end, the X1900 XTX has this same 3 to 1 ratio, but does just fine because screen resolutions top out and it has more than enough texture mapping power to handle any display.

==Details==

===Texture mapping units (TMUs)===
{{Cat main|Texture mapping}}
Textures need to be addressed and filtered. This job is done by TMUs that work in conjunction with pixel and [[vertex shader]] units. It is the TMU's job to apply texture operations to pixels. The number of texture units in a graphics processor is used when comparing two different cards for texturing performance. It is reasonable to assume that the card with more TMUs will be faster at processing texture information.
In modern GPUs  TMUs contain Texture Address Units(TA) and Texture Filtering Units(TF). Texture Address Units map texels to pixels and can perform texture addressing modes.  Texture Filtering Units optionally perform hardware based texture filtering.

===Pipelines===
{{Cat main|Graphics pipeline}}
A pipeline is the graphics card's architecture, which provides a generally accurate idea of the computing power of a graphics processor.

A pipeline isn't formally accepted as a technical term. There are different pipelines within a graphics processor as there are separate functions being performed at any given time. Historically, it has been referred to as a pixel processor that is attached to a dedicated TMU. A Geforce 3 had four pixel pipelines, each of which had two TMUs. The rest of the pipeline handled things like depth and blending operations.

The ATI Radeon 9700 was first to break this mould, by placing a number vertex shader engines independent of the pixel shaders . The R300 GPU used in the Radeon 9700 had four global vertex shaders, but split the rest of the rendering pipeline in half (it was, so to speak, dual core) each half, called a quad, had four pixel shaders, four TMUs and four ROPs. 

Some units are used more than others, and in an effort to increase the processor's entire performance, they attempted to find a "sweet spot" in the number of units needed for optimum efficiency without the need for excess silicon. In this architecture the name pixel pipeline lost its meaning as pixel processors were no longer attached to single TMUs.

The vertex shader had long been decoupled, starting with the R300, but the pixel shader was not so easily done, as it required colour data (e.g. texture samples) to work with, and hence needed to be closely coupled to a TMU.

Said coupling remains to this day, where the shader engine, made of units able to run either vertex or pixel data, is tightly coupled to a TMU but has a crossbar dispatcher between its output and the bank of ROPs.

===Render output pipelines (ROPs)===
{{Cat main|Raster graphics|Render output unit}}
The Render Output Pipeline is an inherited term, and more often referred to as the [[render output unit]]. Its job is to control the sampling of pixels (each pixel is a dimensionless point), so it controls [[antialiasing]], when more than one sample is merged into one pixel. All data rendered has to travel through the ROP in order to be written to the [[framebuffer]], from there it can be transmitted to the display.

Therefore, the ROP is where the GPU's output is assembled into a bitmapped image ready for display.

=== Use in GPGPU ===
In [[GPGPU]], [[texture maps]] in 1,2, or 3 dimensions may be used to store arbitrary data. By providing [[interpolation]], the texture mapping unit provides a convenient means of approximating arbitrary functions with data tables.

==History and proof==
[[File:Ellipsoid tri-axial abc.svg|thumb|A triaxial ellipsoid and its three geodesics]]
This result stems from the mathematics of ocean navigation, where the surface of the earth can be modeled accurately by an [[ellipsoid]], and from the study of the [[geodesics on an ellipsoid]], the shortest paths for ships to travel. In particular, a nearly-spherical triaxial ellipsoid has only three simple closed geodesics, its equators.&lt;ref name="galperin"&gt;{{citation

One proof of this conjecture examines the [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] of the space of smooth curves on the sphere, and uses the [[curve-shortening flow]] to find a simple closed geodesic that represents each of the three nontrivial homology classes of this space.&lt;ref name="grayson"&gt;{{citation

On compact [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]] [[Riemann surface]]s, there are infinitely many simple closed geodesics, but only finitely many with a given length bound. They are encoded analytically by the [[Selberg zeta function]]. The growth rate of the number of simple closed geodesics, as a function of their length, was investigated by [[Maryam Mirzakhani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Mirzakhani|first1=Maryam |title=Growth of the number of simple closed geodesics on hyperbolic surfaces|journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]]|year=2008 |doi=10.4007/annals.2008.168.97|volume=168|issue=1|pages=97–125|mr=2415399|zbl=1177.37036}},&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the theorem of the three geodesics can be extended to convex polyhedra by considering quasigeodesics, curves that are geodesic except at the vertices of the polyhedra and that have angles less than {{pi}} on both sides at each vertex they cross. A version of the theorem of the three geodesics for convex polyhedra states that all polyhedra have at least three simple closed quasigeodesics; this can be proved by approximating the polyhedron by a smooth surface and applying the theorem of the three geodesics to this surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Thomas Penyngton Kirkman''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (31 March 1806 – 3 February 1895) was a British mathematician and ordained minister of the [[Church of England]]. Despite being primarily a churchman, he maintained an active interest in research-level mathematics, and was listed by [[Alexander Macfarlane]] as one of ten leading 19th-century British mathematicians.&lt;ref name="biggs"&gt;{{citation

==Early life and education==
Kirkman was born 31 March 1806 in [[Bolton]], in the north west of England, the son of a local cotton dealer. In his schooling at the Bolton Grammar School, he studied classics, but no mathematics was taught in the school. He was recognised as the best scholar at the school, and the local vicar guaranteed him a scholarship at Cambridge, but his father would not allow him to go. Instead, he left school at age 14 to work in his father's office.&lt;ref name="biggs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="macfarlane"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt;

Nine years later, defying his father, he went to [[Trinity College Dublin]], working as a private tutor to support himself during his studies. There, among other subjects, he first began learning mathematics. He earned a B.A. in 1833 and returned to England in 1835.&lt;ref name="biggs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="macfarlane"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt;

==Ordination and ministry==
On his return to England, Kirkman was ordained into the ministry of the [[Church of England]] and became the [[curate]] in [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]] and then in [[Lymm]]. In 1839 he was invited to become [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of [[Christ Church, Croft|Croft with Southworth]], a newly founded parish in [[Lancashire]], where he would stay for 52 years until his retirement in 1892. Theologically, Kirkman supported the [[Biblical literalism|anti-literalist]] position of [[John William Colenso]], and was also strongly opposed to [[materialism]]. He published many tracts and pamphlets on theology, as well as a book ''Philosophy Without Assumptions'' (1876).&lt;ref name="biggs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="macfarlane"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt;

Kirkman married Eliza Wright in 1841; they had seven children. To support them, Kirkman supplemented his income with tutoring, until Eliza inherited enough property to secure their living. The rectorship itself did not demand much from Kirkman, so from this point forward he had time to devote to mathematics.&lt;ref name="biggs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="macfarlane"/&gt;

Kirkman died 4 February 1895 in [[Bowdon, Greater Manchester|Bowdon]]. His wife died ten days later.&lt;ref name="biggs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt;

==Mathematics==
Kirkman's first mathematical publication was in the ''Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal'' in 1846, on a problem involving [[Steiner triple system]]s that had been published two years earlier in ''[[The Lady's and Gentleman's Diary]]'' by [[Wesley S. B. Woolhouse]].&lt;ref name="biggs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="macfarlane"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt; Despite Kirkman's and Woolhouse's contributions to the problem, Steiner triple systems were named after [[Jakob Steiner]] who wrote a later paper in 1853.&lt;ref name="biggs"/&gt; Kirkman's second research paper, in 1848, concerned [[#Pluquaternions|pluquaternions]].

In 1848, Kirkman published ''First Mnemonical Lessons'', a book on mathematical [[mnemonic]]s for schoolchildren. It was not successful, and [[Augustus de Morgan]] criticised it as "the most curious crochet I ever saw".&lt;ref name="biggs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="macfarlane"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt;

===Kirkman's schoolgirl problem===
Next, in 1849, Kirkman studied the [[Pascal's theorem|Pascal lines]] determined by the intersection points of opposite sides of a [[hexagon]] inscribed within a [[conic section]]. Any six points on a conic may be joined into a hexagon in 60 different ways, forming 60 different Pascal lines. Extending previous work of Steiner, Kirkman showed that these lines intersect in triples to form 60 points (now known as the Kirkman points), so that each line contains three of the points and each point lies on three of the lines. That is, these lines and points form a [[projective configuration]] of type 60&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;60&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="biggs"/&gt;

In 1850, Kirkman observed that his 1846 solution to Woolhouse's problem had an additional property, which he set out as a puzzle in ''The Lady's and Gentleman's Diary'':
{{quote|text=Fifteen young ladies in a school walk out three abreast for seven days in succession: it is required to arrange them daily, so that no two shall walk twice abreast.}}
This problem became known as [[Kirkman's schoolgirl problem]], subsequently to become Kirkman's most famous result. He published several additional works on combinatorial design theory in later years.&lt;ref name="biggs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="macfarlane"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt;

===Pluquaternions===
In 1848 Kirkman wrote "On Pluquaternions and Homoid Products of ''n'' Squares".&lt;ref&gt;[[London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine]] 1848, p 447 [http://www.books.google.com/books?id=kolJAAAAYAAJ  Google books link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140617191332/http://www.books.google.com/books?id=kolJAAAAYAAJ |date=17 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Generalizing the [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s, Kirkman called a '''pluquaternion''' Q&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; a representative of a system with ''a'' imaginary units, ''a'' &gt; 3.
Kirkman's paper was dedicated to confirming Cayley's assertions concerning two equations among triple-products of units as sufficient to determine the system in case ''a'' = 3 but not ''a'' = 4.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Crilly (2006) ''Arthur Cayley: Mathematician Laureate of the Victorian Era'', [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], p. 143 on Kirkman's collaboration with Cayley&lt;/ref&gt; By 1900 these number systems were called [[hypercomplex number]]s, and later treated as part of the theory of [[associative algebra]]s.

===Polyhedral combinatorics===
Beginning in 1853, Kirkman began working on [[combinatorial enumeration]] problems concerning [[polyhedron|polyhedra]], beginning with a proof of [[Euler characteristic|Euler's formula]] and concentrating on simple polyhedra (the polyhedra in which each vertex has three incident edges). He also studied [[Hamiltonian cycle]]s in polyhedra, and provided an example of a polyhedron with no Hamiltonian cycle, prior to the work of [[William Rowan Hamilton]] on the [[Icosian game]]. He [[graph enumeration|enumerated]] [[cubic graph|cubic]] [[Halin graph]]s, over a century before the work of Halin on these graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Th. P.|last=Kirkman|title=On the enumeration of ''x''-edra having triedral summits and an (''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-gonal base|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London|year=1856|pages=399–411|jstor=108592|doi=10.1098/rstl.1856.0018 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; He showed that every polyhedron can be generated from a pyramid by face-splitting and vertex-splitting operations, and he studied [[self-dual polyhedron|self-dual polyhedra]].&lt;ref name="biggs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt;

===Late work===
Kirkman was inspired to work in [[group theory]] by a prize offered beginning in 1858 (but in the end never awarded) by the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. His contributions in this area include an enumeration of the transitive [[group action]]s on sets of up to ten elements. However, as with much of his work on polyhedra, Kirkman's work in this area was weighed down by newly invented terminology and, perhaps because of this, did not significantly influence later researchers.&lt;ref name="biggs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt;

In the early 1860s, Kirkman fell out with the mathematical establishment and in particular with [[Arthur Cayley]] and [[James Joseph Sylvester]], over the poor reception of his works on polyhedra and groups and over issues of priority. Much of his later mathematical work was published (often in [[doggerel]]) in the problem section of the ''Educational Times'' and in the obscure ''Proceedings of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Liverpool''.&lt;ref name="biggs"/&gt; However, in 1884 he began serious work on [[knot theory]], and with [[Peter Guthrie Tait]] published an enumeration of the knots with up to ten crossings.&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt; He remained active in mathematics even after retirement, until his death in 1895.&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt;

==Awards and honours==
In 1857, Kirkman was elected as a fellow of the [[Royal Society]] for his research on pluquaternions and partitions.&lt;ref name="biggs"/&gt; He was also an honorary member of the
Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester and the Literary and Philosophical Society of Liverpool, and a foreign member of the [[Koninklijke Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen|Dutch Society of Science]].&lt;ref name="macfarlane"/&gt;

Since 1994, the [[Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications]] has handed out an annual Kirkman medal, named after Kirkman, to recognise outstanding combinatorial research by a mathematician within four years of receiving a doctorate.

'''Thomas Rawson Birks''' (28 September 1810 – 19 July 1883) was an English theologian and controversialist, who figured in the debate to try to resolve theology and science. He rose to be [[Knightbridge Professor of Philosophy|Knightbridge Professor of Moral Philosophy]] at the [[University of Cambridge]]. His discussions led to much controversy: in one book he proposed that stars cannot have planets as this would reduce the importance of Christ's appearance on this planet.&lt;ref name=extra/&gt;

==Biography==
Birks was born on 28 September 1810 in [[Staveley, Derbyshire|Staveley]] in [[Derbyshire]], England, where his father was a tenant farmer under the [[Duke of Devonshire]]. The family being nonconformists, Birks was educated at [[Chesterfield]] and then at the [[Dissenting College]] at [[Mill Hill]]. He won a [[sizar]]ship and a scholarship at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and in his third year gained the chief English declamation prize. As the holder of this prize he delivered the customary oration in the college hall. The subject chosen was ''Mathematical and Moral Certainty'' and Dr [[William Whewell]] spoke very highly of this oration.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1834, like Whewell before him, Birks became [[second wrangler]] and second Smith's prizeman.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=BRKS829TR|name=Birks, Thomas Rawson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==The church==
Having joined the [[Church of England]] on leaving the university, Birks settled at [[Watton-at-Stone]] as tutor and then curate to the Reverend [[Edward Bickersteth (1786–1850)|Edward Bickersteth]]. During his stay there he studied the prophetic scriptures, and took the affirmative side in the warm controversy which arose on the subject of the [[Premillennialism|premillennial theory]] of the Lord's return. In 1843-4 Birks won the Seatonian prize for the best English poem at Trinity College. Some years before he had been elected a fellow of this college. He engaged in many religious controversies, and one of these, on the future of the Lost, led to the severance of private friendships and religious connections. In his views on this subject he was equally opposed to the [[universalists]] and the [[annihilationist]]s. In 1844 Birks married Bickersteth's daughter, Elizabeth, and accepted the living of [[Kelshall]] in [[Hertfordshire]].

Birks published ''Modern Astronomy'' in 1830 to demonstrate a harmony between science and religion; in it he attempts to join together theology and a modern understanding of astronomy. He deals with such subjects as the insignificance of man, if we are but one race alone in the universe except for the angels. How can Christ's importance be squared with the unimportance of the human race in a large universe with a multitude of stars and planets? Birks' solution was to decide that the existence of planets around other stars is only conjecture.&lt;ref name=extra&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J4TZPlihVUoC&amp;pg=RA2-PA196&amp;lpg=RA2-PA196&amp;dq=rawson+birks&amp;source=web&amp;ots=TQdxsEaO5G&amp;sig=9RIf96mfF6_QSOgh7gw_6_Gb4_I&amp;hl=en#PRA2-PA196,M1 |title=The Extraterrestrial Life Debate, 1750-1900: the idea of a plurality of worlds from Kant to Lowell |first=Michael J. |last=Crowe |place=Mineola, NY |publisher=Dover Publications |edition=2nd |year=1999 |ISBN=0-486-40675-X |pages=196–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1850 he published his edition of [[William Paley]]'s ''Horae Paulinae'', or the ''Truth of the Scripture History of St Paul'' with notes and a supplementary treatise entitled ''Horae Apostolicae''.

==Widower==
In 1856 Birks' wife, Elizabeth, died at the age of 46.&lt;ref&gt;[http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=CV%2FPers%2FBirks%2C%20Elizabeth%20(1820-1856)%20wife%20of%20Thomas%20Rawson%20Birks Papers of Elizabeth Birks]&lt;/ref&gt; His widowhood led to the suspension of his writing for several years. Nevertheless, ''The Bible and Modern Thought'' was published in 1861 at the request of the committee of the [[Religious Tract Society]]. Birks subsequently enlarged his work by a series of notes on the evidential school of theology, the limits of religious thought, the Bible and ancient Egypt, the human element in Scripture, and Genesis and geology. In 1862 he published ''On Matter and Ether, Or, The Secret Laws of Physical Change'' which dealt with issues of physics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NscEAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Thomas+Rawson+Birks%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=R9fnR93tEYbkiQGJmajpBA#PPP9,M1 On Matter and Ether, Or, The Secret Laws of Physical Change], by Thomas Rawson Birks, 1862, MacMillan, London.

Birks left Kelshall in 1864. In 1866 he accepted the important charge of [[Holy Trinity Church, Cambridge]]; and on 17 May 1866 married his second wife, Georgina Agnes Beresford, widow of Major James Douglas.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Stephen |last=Gregory |title=Birks, Thomas Rawson (1810–1883) |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |edition=online  |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/2458 }} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the [[Irish Church Act 1869|disestablishment of the Church of Ireland]], Birks came forward with a lengthy treatise on ''Church and State'' which was an elaboration of a treatise written thirty years before, and was now republished as bearing upon the ecclesiastical change proposed by [[William Ewart Gladstone]] and carried into effect by Parliament. Birks was installed honorary canon of [[Ely Cathedral]] in 1871,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20924/20924-h/20924-h.htm Guide to Ely Cathedral], Anon., 1880, accessed 24 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1872, on the death of the Rev. [[John Frederick Denison Maurice|Frederick Maurice]], he was elected [[Knightbridge Professor of Philosophy]]. This appointment led to a stormy controversy. It was regarded as a retrograde step by the large body of liberal thinkers who sympathised with the views of Frederick Maurice.&lt;ref&gt;A recent study considered Birks and Maurice to have "significant parallels": {{cite journal |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=21C6B30BE36B81216724D6D332E03C86.tomcat1?fromPage=online&amp;aid=1386528 |title=Victorian Anglican Evangelicalism: the radical legacy of Edward Irving |first=Ralph |last=Brown |journal=Journal of Ecclesiastical History |volume=58 |year=2007 |pages=675–704 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As pastor at Cambridge, Birks gave religious instruction to the undergraduates, to older members of the university, and also to the residents in the town. In the year of his appointment he published his ''Scripture Doctrine of Creation '' and ''The Philosophy of Human Responsibility''. His inaugural lecture as professor of moral philosophy was on ''The Present Importance of Moral Science''(1872).

In 1873 Birks published his ''First Principles of Moral Science'' which was a course of lectures delivered during his professorship. This work was followed in 1874 by ''Modern Utilitarianism'' in which the systems of [[William Paley]], [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] were examined and compared. In 1876 he delivered the annual address to the [[Victoria Institute]], his subject being ''The Uncertainties of Modern Physical Science''.

In 1876 he published his work on ''Modern Physical Fatalism and the Doctrine of Evolution''. It contained the substance of a course of lectures devoted to the examination of the philosophy unfolded in [[Herbert Spencer]]'s ''First Principles''. Birks held the views expressed by Spencer to be unsound and opposed to the fundamental doctrines of Christianity and even the existence of moral science. To the strictures upon his ''First Principles''  Spencer replied at length, and this led to the re-publication, in 1882, of Birks's treatise, with an introduction by [[Charles Pritchard]], [[Savilian professor of astronomy]] at [[Oxford University|Oxford]], in which Spencer's rejoinder was dealt with, and the original arguments of Birks illustrated and further explained.

Birks resigned the vicarage of Trinity in 1877, and in the same year published a volume on ''Manuscript Evidence in the Text of the New Testament'', which was an endeavour to bring "mathematical reasoning to bear on the probable value of the manuscripts of different ages, with a general inference in favour of the high value of the cursive manuscripts as a class". In the same year Birks issued his ''Supernatural Revelation'', being an answer to a work on '' Supernatural Religion'' which had given rise to much criticism. Birks's treatise was again republished at a later period by Pritchard, with a reply to objections that had been urged against it.

==Other activities==
For twenty-one years Birks served as honorary secretary to the [[Evangelical Alliance]], but he resigned when the committee failed to agree with his views on eternal punishment.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E02E7DF1330E433A25750C2A9619C94629FD7CF New York Times obituary] July 1883, accessed 24 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He was an examiner for the theological examination at Cambridge in 1867 and 1868, and was a member of the board of theological studies. He took an active part in all university affairs during his connection with Cambridge, was appointed to preach the Ramsden sermon in 1867, and was frequently a select preacher before the university.

==Illness and death==
Early in 1875 Birks suffered from a paralytic seizure, and this was followed by a second stroke in 1877. He still took a deep interest in questions of the day, and was able to dictate various works, pamphlets, and letters bearing upon these questions.
 
In April 1880, while residing in the [[New Forest]], he was paralysed for a week,&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F04E0D91F31EE3ABC4F51DFB266838B699FDE New York Times], 1880, accessed 24 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; his third attack. He was conveyed home to Cambridge, where he lingered for three years incapable of intellectual effort. He died on 19 July 1883.

==Family==
By his first marriage to Elizabeth Bickersteth, Birks had eight children. His eldest son, Edward Bickersteth Birks, also became a theologian and succeeded him as a fellow of Trinity.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

==Works==
In addition to the works named in the course of this article, Birks was the author of a considerable number of treatises on prophecy and other subjects connected with the older revelation, as well as his ''Memoir of the Rev. Edward Bickersteth''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

'''Tibor Gallai''' (born Tibor Grünwald, 15 July 1912 – 2 January 1992) was a [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] [[mathematician]]. He worked in [[combinatorics]], especially in [[graph theory]], and  was a lifelong friend and collaborator of [[Paul Erdős]].  He was a student of [[Dénes Kőnig]] and an advisor of [[László Lovász]]. He was a corresponding member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] (1991).

== His main results ==
The [[Edmonds&amp;ndash;Gallai decomposition theorem]], which was proved independently by Gallai and [[Jack Edmonds]], describes finite graphs from the point of view of matchings. Gallai also proved, with [[Arthur Milgram|Milgram]], [[Dilworth's theorem]] in 1947, but as they hesitated to publish the result, Dilworth independently discovered and published it.&lt;ref&gt;P. Erdős: [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n403421271440504/ In memory of Tibor Gallai], ''[[Combinatorica]]'', '''12'''(1992), 373&amp;ndash;374.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gallai was the first to prove the higher-dimensional version of [[van der Waerden's theorem]].

With [[Paul Erdős]] he gave a [[necessary and sufficient condition]] for a sequence to be the degree sequence of a graph, known as the [[Erdős–Gallai theorem]].

* 260 BC - [[Archimedes]] works out the principle of the [[lever]] and [[Archimedes' principle|connects buoyancy to weight]]
* 60 - [[Hero of Alexandria]] writes ''Metrica, Mechanics'' (on means to lift heavy objects), and ''Pneumatics'' (on machines working on pressure)
* 350 - [[Themistius]] states, that [[static friction]] is larger than [[kinetic friction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sambursky |first=Samuel |date=2014 |title=The Physical World of Late Antiquity |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9781400858989 |pages=65–66 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yvz_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 6th century - [[John Philoponus]] says that by observation, two balls of very different weights will fall at nearly the same speed. He therefore tests the [[equivalence principle]]
* 1021 - [[Al-Biruni]] uses three [[orthogonal]] coordinates to describe point in space&lt;ref name=MacTutor&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Al-Biruni|title=Al-Biruni}}: {{quote|"One of the most important of al-Biruni's many texts is ''Shadows'' which he is thought to have written around 1021. [...] ''Shadows'' is an extremely important source for our knowledge of the history of mathematics, astronomy, and physics. It also contains important ideas such as the idea that acceleration is connected with non-uniform motion, using three rectangular coordinates to define a point in 3-space, and ideas that some see as anticipating the introduction of polar coordinates."}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1000-1030 - [[Alhazen]] and [[Avicenna]] develop the concepts of [[inertia]] and [[momentum]]
* 1100-1138 - [[Ibn Bajjah|Avempace]] develops the concept of a [[Reaction (physics)|reaction]] force&lt;ref&gt;[[Shlomo Pines]] (1964), "La dynamique d’Ibn Bajja", in ''Mélanges Alexandre Koyré'', I, 442-468 [462, 468], Paris.

* 1100-1165 - [[Hibat Allah Abu'l-Barakat al-Baghdaadi]] discovers that [[force]] is proportional to acceleration rather than speed, a fundamental law in classical mechanics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia  | last = Pines  | first = Shlomo  | title = Abu'l-Barakāt al-Baghdādī , Hibat Allah  | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Scientific Biography]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 26–28   | publisher = Charles Scribner's Sons  | location = New York  | year = 1970  | isbn = 0-684-10114-9}}:

[...] This idea is, according to Pines, "the oldest negation of Aristotle's fundamental dynamic law [namely, that a constant force produces a uniform motion]," and is thus an "anticipation in a vague fashion of the fundamental law of classical mechanics [namely, that a force applied continuously produces acceleration]."'')&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1121 - [[Al-Khazini]] publishes ''The Book of the Balance of Wisdom'', in which he develops the concepts of [[Gravitation|gravity]] [[Action at a distance (physics)|at-a-distance]]. He suggests that the gravity varies depending on its distance from the center of the universe, namely Earth&lt;ref&gt;Mariam Rozhanskaya and I. S.

In [[mathematics]], the '''Tits metric''' is a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] defined on the ideal boundary of an [[Hadamard space]] (also called a [[complete metric space|complete]] [[CAT(0) space]]). It is named after [[Jacques Tits]].

Let (''X'', ''d'') be an Hadamard space. Two [[geodesic]] rays ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; : [0, ∞] → ''X'' are called '''asymptotic''' if they stay within a certain distance when traveling, i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;\sup_{t \ge 0} d(c_1(t), c_2(t)) &lt; \infty. &lt;/math&gt;
Equivalently, the [[Hausdorff distance]] between the two rays is finite.

The asymptotic property defines an [[equivalence relation]] on the set of geodesic rays, and the set of equivalence classes is called the ideal boundary ∂''X'' of ''X''. An equivalence class of geodesic rays is called a boundary point of ''X''. For any equivalence class of rays and any point ''p'' in ''X'', there is a unique ray in the class that issues from ''p''.

==Definition of the Tits metric==
First we define an angle between boundary points with respect to a point ''p'' in ''X''. For any two boundary points &lt;math&gt;\xi_1, \xi_2&lt;/math&gt; in ∂''X'', take the two geodesic rays ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; issuing from ''p'' corresponding to the two boundary points respectively. One can define an angle of the two rays at ''p'' called the [[Alexandrov space|Alexandrov angle]]. Intuitively, take the triangle with vertices ''p'', ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') for a small ''t'', and construct a triangle in the flat plane with the same side lengths as this triangle. Consider the angle at the vertex of the flat triangle corresponding to ''p''. The limit of this angle when ''t'' goes to zero is defined as the Alexandrov angle of the two rays at ''p''. (By definition of a CAT(0) space, the angle monotonically decreases as ''t'' decreases, so the limit exists.) Now we define &lt;math&gt;\angle_p(\xi_1, \xi_2)&lt;/math&gt; to be this angle.

To define the angular metric on the boundary ∂''X'' that does not depend on the choice of ''p'', we take the [[supremum]] over all points in ''X''
:&lt;math&gt;\angle(\xi_1, \xi_2) := \sup_{p\in X}\angle_p(\xi_1, \xi_2).&lt;/math&gt;

The Tits metric ''d''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[length metric]] associated to the angular metric, that is for any two boundary points, the Tits distance between them is the [[infimum]] of lengths of all the curves on the boundary that connect them measured in the angular metric. If there is no such curve with finite length, the Tits distance between the two points is defined as infinity.

The ideal boundary of ''X'' equipped with the Tits metric is called the '''Tits boundary''', denoted as ∂&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''X''. 

For a complete CAT(0) space, it can be shown that its ideal boundary with the angular metric is a complete CAT(1) space, and its Tits boundary is also a complete CAT(1) space. Thus for any two boundary points &lt;math&gt;\xi_1, \xi_2&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\angle(\xi_1, \xi_2) &lt; \pi&lt;/math&gt;, we have 
:&lt;math&gt;d_\mathrm{T}(\xi_1, \xi_2) = \angle(\xi_1,\xi_2),&lt;/math&gt;
and the points can be joined by a unique geodesic segment on the boundary. If the space is [[proper metric space|proper]], then any two boundary points at finite Tits distance apart can be joined by a geodesic segment on the boundary.

==Examples==
*For a [[Euclidean space]] '''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, its Tits boundary is the unit sphere ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n'' - 1&lt;/sup&gt;.

* An Hadamard space ''X'' is called a '''visibility space''' if any two distinct boundary points are the endpoints of a geodesic line in ''X''. For such a space, the angular distance between any two boundary points is equal to π, so there is no curve with finite length on the ideal boundary that connects any two distinct boundary points, which means that the Tits distance between any two of them is infinity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7367">In [[computational complexity theory]] and [[combinatorics]], the '''token reconfiguration problem''' is an optimization problem on a graph with both an initial and desired state for tokens.

Given a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, an initial state of tokens is defined by a subset &lt;math&gt;V \subset V(G)&lt;/math&gt; of the vertices of the graph; let &lt;math&gt;n = |V|&lt;/math&gt;.  Moving a token from vertex &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; to vertex &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt; is '''valid''' if &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt; are joined by a path in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; that does not contain any other tokens; note that the distance traveled within the graph is inconsequential, and moving a token across multiple edges sequentially is considered a single move.  A desired end state is defined as another subset &lt;math&gt;V' \subset V(G)&lt;/math&gt;.  The goal is to minimize the number of valid moves to reach the end state from the initial state.&lt;ref name="d"&gt;{{cite web|first1=Erik|last1=Demaine|date=Fall 2014|title=Algorithmic Lower Bounds: Fun with Hardness Proofs Lecture 11 Notes|url=http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.890/fall14/scribe/lec11.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivation ==

The problem is motivated by so-called [[sliding puzzle]]s, which are in fact a variant of this problem, often restricted to rectangular grid graphs with no holes.  The most famous such puzzle, the 15 puzzle, is a variant of this problem on a 4 by 4 grid graph such that &lt;math&gt;n = |V(G)| - 1&lt;/math&gt;.  One key difference between sliding block puzzles and the token reconfiguration problem is that in the original token reconfiguration problem, the tokens are indistinguishable.  As a result, if the graph is connected, the token reconfiguration problem is always solvable; this is not necessarily the case for sliding block puzzles.

== Complexity ==

Calinescu, Dumitrescu, and Pach have shown several results regarding both the optimization and approximation of this problem on various types of graphs.&lt;ref name=calinescu&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calinescu|first1=Gruia|last2=Dumitrescu|first2=Adrian|last3=Pach|first3=János|title=Reconfigurations in Graphs and Grids|journal=LATIN 2006: Theoretical Informatics, 7th Latin American Symposium,                Valdivia, Chile, March 20–24, 2006, Proceedings|date=2006|pages=262–273|doi=10.1007/11682462_27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Optimization ===
Firstly, reducing to the case of trees, there is always a solution in at most &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; moves, with at most one move per token.  Furthermore, an optimal solution can be found in time linear in the size of the tree.  Clearly, the first result extends to arbitrary graphs; the latter does not.

A sketch of the optimal algorithm for trees is as follows.  First, we obtain an algorithm that moves each node exactly once, which may not be optimal.  Do this recursively: consider any leaf of the smallest tree in the graph containing both the initial and desired sets.  If a leaf of this tree is in both, remove it and recurse down.  If a leaf is in the initial set only, find a path from it to a vertex in the desired set that does not pass through any other vertices in the desired set.  Remove this path (it'll be the last move), and recurse down.  The other case, where the leaf is in the desired set only, is symmetric.  To extend to an algorithm that achieves the optimum, consider any token in both the initial and desired sets.  If removing it would split the graph into subtrees, all of which have the same number of elements from the initial and desired sets, then do so and recurse.  If there is no such token, then each token must move exactly once, and so the solution that moves all tokens exactly once must be optimal.

While the algorithm for finding the optimum on trees is linear time, finding the optimum for general graphs is NP-complete, a leap up in difficulty.  It is in NP; the certificate is a sequence of moves, which is at most linear size, so it remains to show the problem is NP-hard as well.  This is done via [[reduction (complexity)|reduction]] from [[set cover]].

Consider an instance of set cover, where we wish to cover all elements &lt;math&gt;v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n&lt;/math&gt; in a universe &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; using subsets &lt;math&gt;S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_m&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; using the minimum number of subsets.  Construct a graph as follows:

Make a vertex for each of the elements in the universe and each of the subsets.  Connect a subset vertex to an element vertex if the subset contains that element.  Create a long path of size &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, and attach one end to every subset vertex.  The initial set is the added path plus every subset vertex, and the final set is every subset vertex plus every element vertex.

To see why this is a reduction, consider the selection of which subset vertex tokens to move.  Clearly, we must open up paths to each of the element vertices, and we do so by moving some of the subset vertex tokens.  After doing so, each token on the long path must move once.  Thus, the optimum cost is equal to the number of selected subsets plus the number of elements (the latter of which is notably a constant).  So we have a polynomial-time reduction from set cover, which is NP-complete, to token reconfiguration.  Thus token reconfiguration is also NP-complete on general graphs.

=== Approximation ===
The token reconfiguration problem is [[APX#Related complexity classes|APX-complete]], meaning that in some sense, it is as hard to approximate as any problem that has a constant-factor [[approximation algorithm]].  The reduction is the same one as above, from set cover.  However, the set cover problem is restricted to subsets of size at most 3, which is an APX-hard problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Papadimitriou|first1=Christos H.|last2=Yannakakis|first2=Mihailis|title=Optimization, Approximation, and Complexity Classes|journal=Journal of Computer and System Sciences|date=1991|volume=43|issue=3|pages=425–440|doi=10.1016/0022-0000(91)90023-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the exact same structure as above, we obtain an [[L-reduction]], as the distance of any solution from optimum is equal between the set cover instance and the transformed token reconfiguration problem.  The only change is the addition of the number of elements in the universe.  Furthermore, the set cover optimum is at least 1/3 of the number of elements, due to the bounded subset size.  Thus, the constants from the [[L-reduction]] are &lt;math&gt;\alpha = 1/4, \beta = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

One can, in fact, modify the reduction to work for labeled token reconfiguration as well.  To do so, attach a new vertex to each of the subset vertices, which is neither an initial nor desired vertex.  Label the vertices on the long path 1 through &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, and do the same for the element vertices.  Now, the solution consists of 'moving aside' each chosen subset vertex token, correctly placing the labeled vertices from the path, and returning the subset vertex tokens to the initial locations.  This is an L-reduction with &lt;math&gt;\alpha = 1/5, \beta = 2&lt;/math&gt;.

Calinescu, Dumitrescu, and Pach have also shown that there exists a 3-approximation for unlabeled token reconfiguration, so the problem is in APX as well and thus APX-complete.  The proof is much more complicated and omitted here.

In [[mathematics]], '''transport of structure''' is the definition of a new structure on an object by reference to another object on which a similar structure already exists. Definitions by transport of structure are regarded as canonical.

Since mathematical structures are often defined in reference to an underlying [[space (mathematics)|space]], many examples of transport of structure involve spaces and mappings between them.  For example, if ''V'' and ''W'' are [[vector space]]s, and if &lt;math&gt;\phi \colon V \to W&lt;/math&gt; is an [[isomorphism]], and if &lt;math&gt;(\cdot,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is an [[inner product]] on &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, then we can define an inner product &lt;math&gt;[\cdot, \cdot]&lt;/math&gt; on ''V'' by
:&lt;math&gt;[v_1, v_2] = (\phi(v_1), \phi(v_2))&lt;/math&gt;.
Although the equation makes sense even when &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is not an isomorphism, it only defines an inner product on ''V'' when &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is, since otherwise it will cause &lt;math&gt;[\cdot,\cdot]&lt;/math&gt; to be [[degenerate bilinear form|degenerate]].  The idea is that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; allows us to consider ''V'' and ''W'' as "the same" vector space, and if we follow this analogy, we can transport an inner product from one to the other.

A more involved example comes from [[differential topology]], in which we have the notion of a [[smooth manifold]].  If ''M'' is such a manifold, and if ''X'' is any topological space which is [[homeomorphic]] to ''M'', we can consider ''X'' as a smooth manifold as well.  That is, let &lt;math&gt;\phi \colon X \to M&lt;/math&gt; be a homeomorphism; we must define coordinate charts on ''X'', which we will do by "pulling back" coordinate charts on ''M'' through &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.  Recall that a coordinate chart on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is an open set ''U'' together with an [[injective map]]
:&lt;math&gt;c \colon U \to \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;
for some ''n''; to get such a chart on ''X'', we let
:&lt;math&gt;U' = \phi^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c' = c \circ \phi&lt;/math&gt;.
Furthermore, it is required that the charts cover ''M'', we must check that the transported charts cover ''X'', which follows immediately from the fact that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a [[bijection]].  Finally, since ''M'' is a ''smooth'' manifold, we have that if ''U'' and ''V'', with their maps
:&lt;math&gt;c \colon U \to \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d \colon V \to \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;,
are two charts on ''M'', then the composition, the "transition map"
:&lt;math&gt;d \circ c^{-1} \colon c(U \cap V) \to \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; (a self-map of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;)
is smooth.  We must check this for our transported charts on ''X''.  We have
:&lt;math&gt;\phi^{-1}(U) \cap \phi^{-1}(V) = \phi^{-1}(U \cap V)&lt;/math&gt;,
and therefore
:&lt;math&gt;c'(U' \cap V') = (c \circ \phi)(\phi^{-1}(U \cap V)) = c(U \cap V)&lt;/math&gt;, and
:&lt;math&gt;d' \circ (c')^{-1} = (d \circ \phi) \circ (c \circ \phi)^{-1} = d \circ (\phi \circ \phi^{-1}) \circ c^{-1} = d \circ c^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
Therefore the transition map for &lt;math&gt;U'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V'&lt;/math&gt; is the same as that for ''U'' and ''V'', hence smooth.  Therefore ''X'' is a smooth manifold via transport of structure.

Although the second example involved considerably more checking, the principle was the same, and any experienced mathematician would have no difficulty performing the necessary verifications.  Therefore when such an operation is indicated, it is invoked merely as "transport of structure" and the details left to the reader, if desired.

The second example also illustrates why "transport of structure" is not always desirable.  Namely, we can take ''M'' to be the plane, and we can take ''X'' to be an infinite one-sided cone.  By "flattening" the cone we achieve a homeomorphism of ''X'' and ''M'', and therefore the structure of a smooth manifold on ''X'', but the cone is not "naturally" a smooth manifold.  That is, we can consider ''X'' as a subspace of 3-space, in which context it is not smooth at the cone point.  A more surprising example is that of [[exotic sphere]]s, discovered by [[Milnor]], which states that there are exactly 28 smooth manifolds which are homeomorphic (but by definition ''not'' diffeomorphic) to &lt;math&gt;S^7&lt;/math&gt;, the 7-dimensional sphere in 8-space.  Thus, transport of structure is most productive when there exists a [[canonical form|canonical]] isomorphism between the two objects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30863">In mathematics, the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{LE}&lt;/math&gt; of '''logarithmic-exponential transseries''' is a [[Non-Archimedean ordered field|non-Archimedean]] ordered [[differential field]] which extends comparability of [[asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]] growth rates of [[elementary function|elementary]] nontrigonometric functions to a much broader class of objects. Each log-exp transseries represents a formal asymptotic behavior, and it can be manipulated formally, and when it converges (or in every case if using special semantics such as through infinite [[surreal number]]s), corresponds to actual behavior. Transseries can also be convenient for representing functions.  Through their inclusion of exponentiation and logarithms, transseries are a strong generalization of the power series at infinity (&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{a_n}{x^n}&lt;/math&gt;) and other similar [[asymptotic expansion]]s.

The field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{LE}&lt;/math&gt; was introduced independently by Dahn-Göring&lt;ref&gt;Dahn, Bernd and Göring, Peter,  [http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/fm/fm127/fm12714.pdf, ''Notes on exponential-logarithmic terms''], Fundamenta Mathematicae, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; and Ecalle&lt;ref&gt;Ecalle, Jean, ''Introduction aux fonctions analyzables et preuve constructive de la conjecture de Dulac'', Actualités mathématiques (Paris), Hermann, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; in the respective contexts of model theory or exponential fields and of the study of analytic singularity and proof by Ecalle of the Dulac conjectures. It constitutes a formal object, extending the field of exp-log functions of Hardy and the field of accelerando-summable series of Ecalle.

The field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{LE}&lt;/math&gt; enjoys a rich structure: an ordered field with a notion of generalized series and sums, with a compatible derivation with distinguished antiderivation, compatible exponential and logarithm functions and a notion of formal composition of series.

== Examples and counter-examples ==

Informally speaking, exp-log transseries are ''well-based'' (i.e. reverse well-ordered) formal [[Hahn series]] of real powers of the posive infinite indeterminate &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, exponentials, logarithms and their compositions, with real coefficients. Two important additionnal conditions are that the exponential and logarithmic depth of an exp-log transseries &lt;math&gt;f,&lt;/math&gt; that is the maximal numbers of iterations of exp and log occurring in &lt;math&gt;f,&lt;/math&gt; must be finite.

The following formal series are log-exp transseries:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\operatorname{e}^{x^{\frac{1}{n}}}}{n!} + x^3 + \log x + \log\log x +\sum_{n=0}^\infty x^{-n} + \sum _{i=1}^\infty \operatorname{e}^{-\sum_{j=1}^\infty \operatorname{e}^{ix^2-jx}}.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m,n \in \N} x^{\frac{1}{m+1}}\operatorname{e}^{-(\log x)^n}.&lt;/math&gt;

The following formal series are ''not'' log-exp transseries:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n \in \N} x^n&lt;/math&gt; — this series is not well-based.
:&lt;math&gt;\log x + \log \log x+ \log \log \log x+ \cdots&lt;/math&gt; — the logarithmic depth of this series is infinite
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}x+\operatorname{e}^{\frac{1}{2}\log x}+\operatorname{e}^{\operatorname{e}^{\frac{1}{2}\log \log x}}+\cdots&lt;/math&gt; — the exponential and logarithmic depths of this series are infinite

It is possible to define differential fields of transseries containing the two last series, they belong respectively to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{EL}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\R\langle\langle \omega \rangle\rangle&lt;/math&gt; (see the paragraph ''Using surreal numbers'' below).

== Introduction ==

A remarkable fact is that asymptotic growth rates of elementary nontrigonometric functions and even all functions definable in the model theoretic structure &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{R},+,\times,&lt;,\exp)&lt;/math&gt; of the ordered exponential field of real numbers are all comparable: 
For all such &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;f \leq_{\infty} g&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;g \leq_{\infty} f&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f\leq_{\infty}g&lt;/math&gt; means &lt;math&gt;\exists x \forall y&gt; x f(x)\leq g(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  The equivalence class of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; under the relation &lt;math&gt;f \leq_{\infty} g \wedge g \leq_{\infty} f&lt;/math&gt;  is the asymptotic behavior of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, also called the ''germ'' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; (or the [[germ (mathematics)|germ]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at infinity).

The field of transseries can be intuitively viewed as a formal generalization these growth rates:  In addition to the elementary operations, transseries are closed under "limits" for appropriate sequences with bounded exponential and logarithmic depth.  However, a complication is that growth rates are non-[[Archimedean property|Archimedean]] and hence do not have the [[least upper bound property]].  We can address this by associating a sequence with the least upper bound of minimal complexity, analogously to construction of surreal numbers.  For example, &lt;math&gt;(\sum_{k=0}^n x^{-k})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; is associated with &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty x^{-k}&lt;/math&gt; rather than &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty x^{-k}-e^{-x}&lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt;e^{-x}&lt;/math&gt; decays too quickly, and if we identify fast decay with complexity, it has greater complexity than necessary (also, because we care only about asymptotic behavior, pointwise convergence is not dispositive).

Because of the comparability, transseries do not include oscillatory growth rates (such as &lt;math&gt;\sin x&lt;/math&gt;).  On the other hand, there are transseries such as &lt;math&gt;\sum \limits_{k  \in \mathbb{N}} k!\operatorname{e}^{x^{-\frac{k}{k+1}}}&lt;/math&gt; that do not directly correspond to convergent series or real valued functions. Another limitation of transseries is that each of them is bounded by a tower of exponentials, i.e. a finite iteration &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{e}^{\operatorname{e}^{.^{.^{.^{\operatorname{e}^x}}}}}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{e}^x&lt;/math&gt;, thereby excluding [[tetration]] and other transexponential functions, i.e. functions which grow faster than any tower of exponentials. There are ways to construct fields of generalized transseries including formal transsexponential terms, for instance formal solutions &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{e}_{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; of the [[Abel equation]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{e}^{\operatorname{e}_{\omega}(x)}=\operatorname{e}_{\omega}(x+1)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Schmeling, Michael, [http://www.texmacs.org/joris/schmeling/schmeling.pdf, ''Corps de transséries''], PhD thesis, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal construction ==

Transseries can be defined as formal (potentially infinite) expressions, with rules defining which expressions are valid, comparison of transseries, arithmetic operations, and even differentiation. Appropriate transseries can then be assigned to corresponding functions or germs, but there are subtleties involving convergence. Even transseries that diverge can often be meaningfully (and uniquely) assigned actual growth rates (that agree with the formal operations on transseries) using [[accelero-summation]], which is a generalization of [[Borel summation]].

Transseries can be formalized in several equivalent ways; we use one of the simplest ones here.

A ''transseries'' is a well-based sum, 

:&lt;math&gt;\sum a_i m_i,&lt;/math&gt; 

with finite exponential depth, where each &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; is a nonzero real number and &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt; is a monic transmonomial (&lt;math&gt;a_i m_i&lt;/math&gt; is a transmonomial but is not monic unless the ''coefficient'' &lt;math&gt;a_i = 1&lt;/math&gt;; each &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt; is different; the order of the summands is irrelevant).

The sum might be infinite or transfinite; it is usually written in the order of decreasing &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt;.

Here, ''well-based'' means that there is no infinite ascending sequence &lt;math&gt;m_{i_1} &lt; m_{i_2} &lt; m_{i_3} &lt; \cdots&lt;/math&gt; (see [[well-ordering]]).

A ''monic transmonomial'' is one of 1, ''x'', log ''x'', log log ''x'', ..., ''e''&lt;sup&gt;purely_large_transseries&lt;/sup&gt;.

: ''Note:'' Because &lt;math&gt;x^n = e^{n \log x}&lt;/math&gt;, we do not include it as a primitive, but many authors do; ''log-free'' transseries do not include &lt;math&gt;\log&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;x^n e^\cdots&lt;/math&gt; is permitted. Also, circularity in the definition is avoided because the purely_large_transseries (above) will have lower exponential depth; the definition works by recursion on the exponential depth. See "Log-exp transseries as iterated Hahn series" (below) for a construction that uses &lt;math&gt;x^a e^\cdots&lt;/math&gt; and explicitly separates different stages.

A ''purely large transseries'' is a nonempty transseries &lt;math&gt;\sum a_i m_i&lt;/math&gt; with every &lt;math&gt;m_i&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.

Transseries have ''finite exponential depth'', where each level of nesting of ''e'' or log increases depth by 1 (so we cannot have ''x'' + log ''x'' + log log ''x'' + ...).

Addition of transseries is termwise: &lt;math&gt;\sum a_i m_i + \sum b_i m_i = \sum(a_i + b_i) m_i&lt;/math&gt; (absence of a term is equated with a zero coefficient).

''Comparison:''

The most significant term of &lt;math&gt;\sum a_i m_i&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;a_i m_i&lt;/math&gt; for the largest &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt; (because the sum is well-based, this exists for nonzero transseries). &lt;math&gt;\sum a_i m_i&lt;/math&gt; is positive iff the coefficient of the most significant term is positive (this is why we used 'purely large' above). ''X'' &gt; ''Y'' iff ''X''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''Y'' is positive.

''Comparison of monic transmonomials:''

: &lt;math&gt;x = e^{\log x}, \log x = e^{\log \log x}, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; -- these are the only equalities in our construction.
: &lt;math&gt;x &gt; \log x &gt; \log \log x &gt; \cdots &gt;1 &gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;e^a &lt; e^b&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;a &lt; b&lt;/math&gt; (also &lt;math&gt;e^0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;).

''Multiplication:''
: &lt;math&gt;e^a e^b = e^{a+b}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\left(\sum a_i x_i\right) \left(\sum b_j y_j\right) = \sum_k \left( \sum_{i,j\,:\,z_k=x_i y_j} a_i b_j\right) z_k.&lt;/math&gt;

This essentially applies the distributive law to the product; because the series is well-based, the inner sum is always finite.

''Differentiation:''

: &lt;math&gt;\left(\sum a_i x_i\right)' = \sum a_i x_i'&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;1' = 0, x' = 1&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(e^y)' = y' e^y&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(\log y)' = y'/y&lt;/math&gt; (division is defined using multiplication).

With these definitions, transseries is an ordered differential field. Transseries is also a [[valuation (algebra)|valued field]], with the valuation &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; given by the leading monic transmonomial, and the corresponding asymptotic relation defined for &lt;math&gt;0\neq f,g \in \mathbb{T}^{LE}&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;f \prec g&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; \forall 0&lt;r \in \R, |f| &lt; r |g|&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;|f|=\max(f,-f)&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute value).

==Other constructions==

=== Log-exp transseries as iterated Hahn series ===
====Log-free transseries====

We first define the subfield &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{E}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{LE}&lt;/math&gt; of so-called ''log-free transseries''. Those are transseries which exclude any logarithmic term.

''Inductive definition:''

For &lt;math&gt;n \in \N,&lt;/math&gt; we will define a linearly ordered multiplicative group of ''monomials'' &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}_n&lt;/math&gt;. We then let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^E_n&lt;/math&gt; denote the field of ''well-based series'' &lt;math&gt;\R[[\mathfrak{M}_n]]&lt;/math&gt;. This is the set of maps &lt;math&gt;\R\to \mathfrak{M}_n&lt;/math&gt; with well-based (i.e. reverse well-ordered) support, equipped with pointwise sum and Cauchy product (see [[Hahn series]]). In &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^E_n&lt;/math&gt;, we distinguish the (non-unital) subring &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^E_{n,\succ}&lt;/math&gt; of ''purely large transseries'', which are series whose support contains only monomials lying strictly above &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.

:We start with &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}_0=x^{\R}&lt;/math&gt; equipped with the product &lt;math&gt;x^a x^b:=x^{a+b}&lt;/math&gt; and the order &lt;math&gt;x^a \prec x^b \leftrightarrow a&lt;b&lt;/math&gt;.

:If &lt;math&gt;n\in \N&lt;/math&gt; is such that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}_n&lt;/math&gt;, and thus &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^E_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^E_{n,\succ}&lt;/math&gt; are defined, we let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of formal expressions &lt;math&gt;x^a \operatorname{e}^{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a \in \R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta \in \mathbb{T}^E_{n,\succ}&lt;/math&gt;. This forms a linearly ordered commutative group under the product &lt;math&gt;(x^a \operatorname{e}^{\theta})(x^{a'} \operatorname{e}^{\theta'})=(x^{a+a'}) \operatorname{e}^{\theta+\theta'}&lt;/math&gt; and the lexicographic order &lt;math&gt;x^a \operatorname{e}^{\theta} \prec x^{a'} \operatorname{e}^{\theta'}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;\theta'&lt;/math&gt; or (&lt;math&gt;\theta=\theta'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;a'&lt;/math&gt;).

The natural inclusion of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}_0&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}_1&lt;/math&gt; given by identifying &lt;math&gt;x^a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^a \operatorname{e}^0&lt;/math&gt; inductively provides a natural embedding of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}_n&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;, and thus a natural embedding of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^E_n&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^E_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;. We may then define the linearly ordered commutative group &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}=\bigcup_{n \in \N} \mathfrak{M}_n&lt;/math&gt; and the ordered field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^E=\bigcup_{n \in \N} \mathbb{T}^E_n&lt;/math&gt; which is the field of log-free transseries.

The field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^E&lt;/math&gt; is a proper subfield of the field &lt;math&gt;\R[[\mathfrak{M}]]&lt;/math&gt; of well-based series with real coefficients and monomials in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, every series &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^E&lt;/math&gt; has a bounded exponential depth, i.e. the least positive integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathbb{T}^E_n&lt;/math&gt;, whereas the series 

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{e}^{-x}+\operatorname{e}^{-\operatorname{e}^x}+\operatorname{e}^{-\operatorname{e}^{\operatorname{e}^x}}+ \cdots \in \R[[\mathfrak{M}]]&lt;/math&gt; 

has no such bound.

''Exponentiation on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^E&lt;/math&gt;:''

The field of log-free transseries is equipped with an exponential function which is a specific morphism &lt;math&gt;\exp:(\mathbb{T}^E,+)\to(\mathbb{T}^{E,&gt;}, \times)&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be a log-free transseries and let &lt;math&gt;n \in \N&lt;/math&gt; be the exponential depth of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathbb{T}^E_n&lt;/math&gt;. Write &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;  as the sum &lt;math&gt;f=\theta+r+\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^E_n,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\theta \in \mathbb{T}^E_{n,\succ}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is a real number and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is infinitesimal (any of them could be zero). Then the formal Hahn sum 

:&lt;math&gt;E(\varepsilon):=\sum_{k \in \N} \frac{\varepsilon^k}{k!}&lt;/math&gt; 

converges in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^E_n&lt;/math&gt;, and we define &lt;math&gt;\exp(f)=\operatorname{e}^{\theta}\exp(r) E(\varepsilon) \in \mathbb{T}^E_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\exp(r)&lt;/math&gt; is the value of the real exponential function at &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

''Right-composition with &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{e}^x&lt;/math&gt;:''

A right composition &lt;math&gt;\circ_{\operatorname{e}^x}&lt;/math&gt; with the series &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{e}^x&lt;/math&gt; can be defined by induction on the exponential depth by 

:&lt;math&gt;\left (\sum f_{\mathfrak{m}} \mathfrak{m} \right ) \circ \operatorname{e}^x:=\sum f_{\mathfrak{m}} (\mathfrak{m} \circ \operatorname{e}^x),&lt;/math&gt; 

with &lt;math&gt;x^r \circ \operatorname{e}^x:=\operatorname{e}^{rx}&lt;/math&gt;. It follows inductively that monomials are preserved by &lt;math&gt;\circ_{\operatorname{e}^x},&lt;/math&gt; so at each inductive step the sums are well-based and thus well defined.

====Log-exp transseries====

''Definition:''

The function &lt;math&gt;\exp&lt;/math&gt; defined above is not onto &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{E,&gt;}&lt;/math&gt; so the logarithm is only partially defined on &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{T}^E &lt;/math&gt;: for instance the series &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has no logarithm. Moreover, every positive infinite log-free transseries is greater than some positive power of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. In order to move from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^E&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{LE}&lt;/math&gt;, one can simply "plug" into the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of series formal iterated logarithms &lt;math&gt;\ell_n,n \in \N&lt;/math&gt; which will behave like the formal reciprocal of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-fold iterated exponential term denoted &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{e}_n&lt;/math&gt;.

For &lt;math&gt;m,n \in \N,&lt;/math&gt; let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}_{m,n}&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of formal expressions &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{u} \circ \ell_n&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{u} \in \mathfrak{M}_m&lt;/math&gt;. We turn this into an ordered group by defining &lt;math&gt;(\mathfrak{u} \circ \ell_n)(\mathfrak{v} \circ \ell_n(x)):=(\mathfrak{u}\mathfrak{v}) \circ \ell_n&lt;/math&gt;, and defining &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{u} \circ \ell_n\prec \mathfrak{v}\circ \ell_n&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{u}\prec \mathfrak{v}&lt;/math&gt;. We define &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{LE}_{m,n}:=\R[[\mathfrak{M}_{m,n}]]&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;n'&gt; n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m' \geq m+(n'-n),&lt;/math&gt; we embed &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}_{m,n}&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}_{m',n'}&lt;/math&gt; by identifying an element &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{u} \circ \ell_n&lt;/math&gt; with the term 

:&lt;math&gt;\left (\mathfrak{u} \circ \overbrace{\operatorname{e}^x \circ \cdots \circ \operatorname{e}^x}^{n'-n} \right ) \circ \ell_{n'}.&lt;/math&gt;

We then obtain &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{LE}&lt;/math&gt; as the directed union 

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{LE}=\bigcup_{m,n \in \N} \mathbb{T}^{LE}_{m,n}.&lt;/math&gt;

On &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{LE},&lt;/math&gt; the right-composition &lt;math&gt;\circ_{\ell}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is naturally defined by 

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{LE}_{m,n} \ni \left (\sum f_{\mathfrak{m} \circ \ell_n} \mathfrak{m} \circ \ell_n \right ) \circ \ell:= \sum f_{\mathfrak{m} \circ \ell_n} \mathfrak{m} \circ \ell_{n+1}\in \mathbb{T}^{LE}_{m,n+1}.&lt;/math&gt;

''Exponential and logarithm:''

Exponentiation can be defined on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{LE}&lt;/math&gt; in a similar way as for log-free transseries, but here also &lt;math&gt;\exp&lt;/math&gt; has a reciprocal &lt;math&gt;\log&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{LE,&gt;}&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, for a strictly positive series &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathbb{T}^{LE,&gt;}_{m,n}&lt;/math&gt;, write &lt;math&gt;f=\mathfrak{m} r(1+\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; is the dominant monomial of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; (largest element of its support), &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the corresponding positive real coefficient, and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon:=\frac{f}{\mathfrak{m} r}-1&lt;/math&gt; is infinitesimal. The formal Hahn sum 

:&lt;math&gt;L(1+\varepsilon):=\sum_{k \in \N}\frac{(-\varepsilon)^k}{k+1}&lt;/math&gt; 

converges in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{LE}_{m,n}&lt;/math&gt;. Write &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}=\mathfrak{u}\circ \ell_n&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{u} \in \mathfrak{M}_m&lt;/math&gt; itself has the form &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{u}=x^a\operatorname{e}^{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\theta \in \mathbb{T}^E_{m,\succ}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a \in \R&lt;/math&gt;. We define &lt;math&gt;\ell(\mathfrak{m}):=a \ell_{n+1} +\theta \circ \ell_n &lt;/math&gt;. We finally set 

:&lt;math&gt;\log(f):=\ell(\mathfrak{m})+\log(c)+L(1+\varepsilon) \in \mathbb{T}^{LE}_{m,n+1}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Using surreal numbers===

====Direct construction of log-exp transseries====

One may also define the field of log-exp transseries as a subfield of the ordered field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{No}&lt;/math&gt; of surreal numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Berarducci, Alessandro and Mantova, Vincenzo, [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.019, ''Transseries as germs of surreal functions''], Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{No}&lt;/math&gt; is equipped with Gonshor-Kruskal's exponential and logarithm functions&lt;ref&gt;Gonshor, Harry, ''An Introduction to the Theory of Surreal Numbers'', 'Cambridge University Press', 1986&lt;/ref&gt; and with its natural structure of field of well-based series under Conway normal form.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, John, Horton, [https://keybase.pub/procspero/%5BMath%5D%20Probability%20and%20Statistics/Combinatorial%20Game%20Theory/On%20Numbers%20and%20Games,%20John%20Horton%20Conway.pdf, ''On numbers and games''], Academic Press, London, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

Define &lt;math&gt;F^{LE}_0=\R(\omega)&lt;/math&gt;, the subfield of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{No}&lt;/math&gt; generated by &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt; and the simplest positive infinite surreal number &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; (which corresponds naturally to the ordinal &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, and as a transseries to the series &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;). Then, for &lt;math&gt;n \in \N&lt;/math&gt;, define &lt;math&gt;F^{LE}_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; as the field generated by &lt;math&gt;F^{LE}_n&lt;/math&gt;, exponentials of elements of &lt;math&gt;F^{LE}_n&lt;/math&gt; and logarithms of strictly positive elements of &lt;math&gt;F^{LE}_n&lt;/math&gt;, as well as (Hahn) sums of summable families in &lt;math&gt;F^{LE}_n&lt;/math&gt;. The union &lt;math&gt;F^{LE}_{\omega}=\bigcup_{n \in \N} F^{LE}_n&lt;/math&gt; is naturally isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{LE}&lt;/math&gt;. In fact, there is a unique such isomorphism which sends &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and commutes with exponentiation and sums of summable families in &lt;math&gt;F^{LE}_{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; lying in &lt;math&gt;F_{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;.

====Other fields of transseries====

*Continuing this process by transfinite induction on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Ord}&lt;/math&gt; beyond &lt;math&gt;F^{LE}_{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;, taking unions at limit ordinals, one obtains a proper class-sized field &lt;math&gt;\R\langle\langle\omega\rangle\rangle&lt;/math&gt; canonically equipped with a derivation and a ''composition'' extending that of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{LE}&lt;/math&gt; (see ''Operations on transseries'' below).

*If instead of &lt;math&gt;F^{LE}_0&lt;/math&gt; one starts with the subfield &lt;math&gt;F^{EL}_0:=\R(\omega,\log \omega, \log \log \omega, \ldots)&lt;/math&gt; generated by &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt; and all finite iterates of &lt;math&gt;\log&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, and for &lt;math&gt;n\in \N, F^{EL}_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; is the subfield generated by &lt;math&gt;F^{EL}_n&lt;/math&gt;, exponentials of elements of &lt;math&gt;F^{EL}_n&lt;/math&gt; and sums of summable families in &lt;math&gt;F^{EL}_n&lt;/math&gt;, then one obtains an isomorphic copy the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{EL}&lt;/math&gt; of ''exponential-logarithmic transseries'', which is a proper extension of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{LE}&lt;/math&gt; equipped with a total exponential function.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhlmann, Salma and Tressl, Marcus, [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.4189.pdf, ''Comparison of exponential-logarithmic and logarithmic-exponential series''], Mathematical Logic Quarterly, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berarducci-Mantova derivation&lt;ref&gt;Berarducci, Alessandro and Mantova, Vincenzo, [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.00315.pdf, ''Surreal numbers, derivations and transseries''], European Mathematical Society, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{No}&lt;/math&gt; coincides on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{LE}&lt;/math&gt; with its natural derivation, and is unique to satisfy compatibility relations with the exponential ordered field structure and generalized series field structure of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{EL}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\R\langle\langle\omega\rangle\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

Contrary to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{LE},&lt;/math&gt; the derivation in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{EL}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\R \langle\langle\omega\rangle\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is not surjective: for instance the series 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\omega \log \omega \log \log \omega \cdots}:=\exp(-(\log \omega+\log \log\omega+\log \log \log \omega+ \cdots)) \in \mathbb{T}^{EL}&lt;/math&gt; 

doesn't have an antiderivative in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{EL}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\R \langle \langle\omega \rangle\rangle&lt;/math&gt; (this is linked to the fact that those fields contain no transsexponential function).

== Additional properties ==

=== Operations on transseries ===

====Operations on the differential exponential ordered field====

Transseries have very strong closure properties, and many operations can be defined on transseries:
* Log-exp transseries form an [[exponentially closed field|exponentially closed ordered field]]: the exponential and logarithmic functions are total. For example:
::&lt;math&gt;\exp(x^{-1}) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!}x^{-n} \quad \text{and} \quad \log(x+\ell)=\ell+\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(x^{-1}\ell)^n}{n+1}.&lt;/math&gt;
* Logarithm is defined for positive arguments.
* Log-exp transseries are [[real closed field|real-closed]].
* Integration: every log-exp transseries &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has a unique antiderivative with zero constant term &lt;math&gt;F \in \mathbb{T}^{LE}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;F'=f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_1=0&lt;/math&gt;.
* Logarithmic antiderivative: for &lt;math&gt;f\in \mathbb{T}^{LE}&lt;/math&gt;, there is &lt;math&gt;h\in \mathbb{T}^{LE}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;f'=f h'&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Note 1.''' The last two properties mean that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{LE}&lt;/math&gt; is ''Liouville closed''.

'''Note 2.''' Just like an elementary nontrigonometric function, each positive infinite transseries &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has integral exponentiality, even in this strong sense: 

:&lt;math&gt;\exists k,n \in \N: \quad \ell_{n-k} -1\leq \ell_n \circ f \leq \ell_{n-k}+1.&lt;/math&gt;

The number &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is unique, it is called the ''exponentiality'' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

====Composition of transseries====

An original property of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{LE}&lt;/math&gt; is that it admits a composition &lt;math&gt;\circ :\mathbb{T}^{LE} \times \mathbb{T}^{LE,&gt;,\succ} \to \mathbb{T}^{LE}&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{LE,&gt;,\succ}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of positive infinite log-exp transseries) which enables us to see each log-exp transseries &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; as a function on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{LE,&gt;,\succ}&lt;/math&gt;. Informally speaking, for &lt;math&gt;g\in\mathbb{T}^{LE,&gt;,\succ}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f\in \mathbb{T}^{LE}&lt;/math&gt;, the series &lt;math&gt;f \circ g&lt;/math&gt; is obtained by replacing each occurrence of the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.

=====Properties=====
* Associativity: for &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathbb{T}^{LE} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g,h \in \mathbb{T}^{LE,&gt;,\succ}&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;g\circ h \in \mathbb{T}^{LE,&gt;,\succ}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f \circ (g\circ h)=(f \circ g) \circ h&lt;/math&gt;. 
* Compatibility of right-compositions: For &lt;math&gt;g\in \mathbb{T}^{LE,&gt;,\succ}&lt;/math&gt;, the function &lt;math&gt;\circ_g:f\mapsto f \circ g&lt;/math&gt; is a field automorphism of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{LE}&lt;/math&gt; which commutes with formal sums, sends &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{e}^x&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt;\exp(g)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt;\log(g)&lt;/math&gt;. We also have &lt;math&gt;\circ_x=\operatorname{id}_{\mathbb{T}^{LE}}&lt;/math&gt;. 
* Unicity: the composition is unique to satisfy the two previous properties.
* Monotonicity: for &lt;math&gt;f\in \mathbb{T}^{LE}&lt;/math&gt;, the function &lt;math&gt;g\mapsto f \circ g&lt;/math&gt; is constant or strictly monotonous on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{LE,&gt;,\succ}&lt;/math&gt;. The monotony depends on the sign of &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt;.
* Chain rule: for &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathbb{T}^{LE}\times &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g \in \mathbb{T}^{LE,&gt;,\succ}&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;(f \circ g)'=g'f' \circ g&lt;/math&gt;.
* Functional inverse: for &lt;math&gt;g \in \mathbb{T}^{LE,&gt;,\succ}&lt;/math&gt;, there is a unique series &lt;math&gt;h \in \mathbb{T}^{LE,&gt;,\succ}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;g \circ h= h \circ g= x&lt;/math&gt;.
* Taylor expansions: each log-exp transseries &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has a Taylor expansion around every point in the sense that for every &lt;math&gt;g\in \mathbb{T}^{LE,&gt;,\succ}&lt;/math&gt; and for sufficiently small &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon \in \mathbb{T}^{LE}&lt;/math&gt;, we have 
::&lt;math&gt;f\circ (g+\varepsilon)=\sum_{k \in \N} \frac{f^{(k)}\circ g}{k!}\varepsilon^k&lt;/math&gt; 
:where the sum is a formal Hahn sum of a summable family. 
* Fractional iteration: for &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathbb{T}^{LE,&gt;,\succ}&lt;/math&gt; with exponentiality &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and any real number &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, the fractional iterate &lt;math&gt;f^a&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Edgar | first = G.

=== Decidability and model theory ===

====Theory of differential ordered valued differential field====
The &lt;math&gt;\left\langle+,\times,\partial,&lt;,\prec\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; theory of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{LE}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Decidability (logic)#Decidability of a theory|decidable]] and can be axiomatized as follows (this is Theorem 2.2 of Aschenbrenner et al.):
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{LE}&lt;/math&gt; is an ordered valued differential field.
* &lt;math&gt;f &gt; 0 \wedge f \succ 1 \Longrightarrow f' &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f' \prec 1 \Longrightarrow f \prec 1&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall f \exists g: \quad g' = f&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall f \exists h: \quad h' = fh&lt;/math&gt;
* Intermediate value property (IVP): 
::&lt;math&gt;P(f) &lt; 0 \wedge P(g) &gt; 0 \Longrightarrow \exists h: \quad P(h) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''P'' is a differential polynomial, i.e. a polynomial in &lt;math&gt;f, f', f'', \ldots, f^{(k)}.&lt;/math&gt;

In this theory, exponentiation is essentially defined for functions (using differentiation) but not constants; in fact, every definable subset of &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; is [[semialgebraic set|semialgebraic]].

====Theory of ordered exponential field====
The &lt;math&gt;\langle+,\times,\exp,&lt; \rangle&lt;/math&gt; theory of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{LE}&lt;/math&gt; is that of the exponential real ordered exponential field &lt;math&gt;(\R,+,\times,\exp,&lt;)&lt;/math&gt;, which is [[model complete theory|model complete]] by [[Wilkie's theorem]].

=== Hardy fields ===

&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}_\mathrm{as}&lt;/math&gt; is the field of accelero-summable transseries, and using accelero-summation, we have the corresponding [[Hardy field]], which is conjectured to be the maximal Hardy field corresponding to a subfield of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;. (This conjecture is informal since we have not defined which isomorphisms of Hardy fields into differential subfields of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; are permitted.) &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}_\mathrm{as}&lt;/math&gt; is conjectured to satisfy the above axioms of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt;. Without defining accelero-summation, we note that when operations on convergent transseries produce a divergent one while the same operations on the corresponding germs produce a valid germ, we can then associate the divergent transseries with that germ.

A Hardy field is said ''maximal'' if it is properly contained in no Hardy field. By an application of Zorn's lemma, every Hardy field is contained in a maximal Hardy field. It is conjectured that all maximal Hardy fields are elementary equivalent as differential fields, and indeed have the same first order theory as &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}^{LE}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Aschenbrenner, Matthias, and van den Dries, Lou and van der Hoeven, Joris, [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.06936.pdf], ''On Numbers, Germs, and Transseries'', In ''Proc. Int. Cong. of Math.'', vol. 1, p. 1-24, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Logarithmic-transseries do not themselves correspond to a maximal Hardy field for not every transseries corresponds to a real function, and maximal Hardy fields always contain transsexponential functions.&lt;ref&gt;Boshernitzan, Michael, ''Hardy fields and existence of transexponential functions'', In ''aequationes mathematicae'', vol. 30, issue 1, p. 258–280, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using this methodology, it is likely to identify a finite test-set that exhaustively determines whether the tested system's implementation matches its specification.  This goal is achieved by a divide-and-conquer approach, in which the design is decomposed by refinement&lt;ref name="IpHol98"&gt;F. Ipate and M. Holcombe (1998) 'A method for refining and testing generalised machine specifications'. ''Int. J. Comp. Math.''

At each integration stage, the testing method guarantees that the tested components are correctly integrated.&lt;ref name="IpHol97"&gt;F. Ipate and M. Holcombe (1997) 'An integration testing method that is proved to find all faults', ''International Journal of Computer Mathematics'' '''63''', pp. 159-178.&lt;/ref&gt;

The methodology overcomes formal [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem#Relationship with computability|undecidability]] limitations by requiring that certain [[design for test]] principles are followed during specification and implementation.  The resulting scalability means that practical software&lt;ref name="BogHol98"&gt;K. Bogdanov and M. Holcombe (1998) 'Automated test set generation for Statecharts', in: D. Hutter, W Stephan, P.

== Motivation ==

Much [[software testing]] is merely hopeful, seeking to exercise the software system in various ways to see whether any faults can be detected.  Testing may indeed reveal some faults, but can never guarantee that the system is correct, once testing is over.  
[[Functional testing]] methods seek to improve on this situation, by developing a [[formal specification]] describing the intended behaviour of the system, against which the implementation is later tested (a kind of [[conformance testing]]).  The specification can be validated against the user-requirements and later [[Mathematical proof|proven]] to be [[consistent]] and [[Completeness (logic)|complete]] by mathematical reasoning (eliminating any logical design flaws).  Complete [[functional testing]] methods exploit the specification systematically, generating test-sets which exercise the implemented software system ''exhaustively'', to determine whether it conforms to the specification.  In particular:
* Full positive testing: confirms that all desired behaviour is present in the system;
* Full negative testing: confirms that no unintended behaviour is present in the system.
This level of testing  can be difficult to achieve, since software systems are extremely complex, with hundreds of thousands of states and millions of transitions.  What is needed is a way of breaking down the specification and testing problem into parts which can be addressed separately.

=== Scalable, Abstract Specifications ===

Mike Holcombe first proposed using [[Samuel Eilenberg]]'s theoretical [[X-machine]] model as the basis for software specification in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="Hol88"&gt;M. Holcombe (1988)
  'X-machines as a basis for dynamic system specification',
  ''Software Engineering Journal'' '''3'''(2), pp. 69-76.&lt;/ref&gt;
This is because the model cleanly separates the ''control flow'' of a system from the ''processing'' carried out by the system.  At a given level of abstraction, the system can be viewed as a simple [[finite state machine]] consisting of a few states and transitions.  The more complex processing is delegated to the ''processing functions'' on the transitions, which modify the underlying fundamental data type ''X''.  Later, each processing function may be separately exposed and characterized by another [[X-machine]], modelling the behaviour of that system operation.

This supports a divide-and-conquer approach, in which the overall system architecture is specified first, then each major system operation is specified next, followed by subroutines, and so forth.  At each step, the level of complexity is manageable, because of the independence of each layer.  In particular, it is easy for software engineers to validate the simple [[finite state machine]]s against user requirements.

=== Incrementally Testable Specifications ===

Gilbert Laycock first proposed a particular kind of [[X-machine]], the [[Stream X-Machine]], as the basis for the testing method.&lt;ref name="Lay93" /&gt;  The advantage of this variant was the way in which testing could be controlled.  In a [[Stream X-Machine]], the fundamental data type has a particular form:  ''X'' = ''Out''* × ''Mem'' × ''In''*, where ''In''* is an input stream, ''Out''* is an output stream, and ''Mem'' is the internal memory.  The transitions of a [[Stream X-Machine]] are labelled with processing functions of the form φ: ''Mem'' × ''In'' → ''Out'' × ''Mem'', that is, they consume one input from the input stream, possibly modify memory, and produce one output on the output stream (see the [[Stream X-Machine|associated article]] for more details).

The benefits for testing are that software systems designed in this way are ''observable'' at each step.  For each input, the machine takes one step, producing an output, such that input/output pairs may be matched exactly.  This contrasts with other approaches in which the system ''runs to completion'' (taking multiple steps) before any observation is made.  Furthermore, layered [[Stream X-Machine]]s offer a convenient abstraction.  At each level, the tester may ''forget'' about the details of the processing functions and consider the (sub-)system just as a simple [[finite state machine]].  Powerful methods exist for testing systems that conform to finite state specifications, such as Chow's W-method.&lt;ref name="Chow78"&gt;T. S. Chow (1978) 'Testing software design modelled by finite state machines', ''IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering'', '''4''' ''(3)'', pp. 178-187.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specification Method ==

When following the (Stream) X-Machine methodology, the first stage is to identify the various types of data to be processed.  For example, a word processor will use basic types ''Character'' (keyboard input), ''Position'' (mouse cursor position) and ''Command'' (mouse or menu command).  There may be other constructed types, such as ''Text'' ::= ''Character''* (a sequence of characters), ''Selection'' ::= ''Position'' × ''Position'' (the start and end of the selection) and ''Document'' ::= ''Text'' × ''Selection'' × ''Boolean'' (the text, a possible selection, and a flag to signal if the document has been modified).

=== High-Level Specification ===

The top-level specification is a [[Stream X-Machine]] describing the main user interaction with the system.  For example, the word processor will exist in a number of states, in which keystrokes and commands will have different effects.  Suppose that this word processor exists in the states {'''Writing''', '''Selecting''', '''Filing''', '''Editing'''}.  We expect the word processor to start in the initial '''Writing''' state, but to move to the '''Selecting''' state if either the mouse is ''dragged'', or the ''shift-key'' is held down.  Once the selection is established, it should return to the '''Writing''' state.  Likewise, if a menu option is chosen, this should enter the '''Editing''' or '''Filing''' state.  In these states, certain keystrokes may have different meanings.  The word processor eventually returns to the '''Writing''' state, when any menu command has finished.  This state machine is designed and labelled informally with the various actions that cause it to change state.

The input, memory and output types for the top-level machine are now formalised.  Suppose that the memory type of the simple word processor is the  type ''Document'' defined above.  This treats a document as a text string, with two positions marking a possible selection and a flag to indicate modification since the last ''save''-command.  A more complex word processor might support undoable editing, with a sequence of document states: ''Document'' ::= (''Text'' × ''Selection'')*, which are collapsed to one document every time a ''save''-command is performed.

Suppose that the input type for the machine is:  ''In'' ::= ''Command'' × ''Character'' × ''Position''.  This recognises that every interaction could be a simple character insertion, a menu command or a cursor placement.  Any given interaction is a 3-tuple, but some places may be empty.  For example, (''Insert'', 'a', ε) would represent typing the character 'a'; while (''Position'', ε, 32) would mean placing the cursor between characters 32 and 33; and (''Select'', ε, 32) would mean selecting the text between the current cursor position and the place between characters 32 and 33.

The output type for the machine is designed so that it is possible to determine from the output ''which'' processing function was executed, in response to a given input.  This relates to the property of ''output distinguishability'', described below.

=== Low-Level Specification ===

If a system is complex, then it will most likely be decomposed into several [[Stream X-Machine]]s.  The most common kind of refinement is to take each of the major processing functions (which were the labels on the high-level machine) and treat these as separate [[Stream X-Machine]]s.&lt;ref name="IpHol98" /&gt;  In this case, the input, memory and output types for the low-level machines will be different from those defined for the high-level machine.  Either, this is treated as an expansion of the data sets used at the high level, or there is a translation from more abstract data sets at the high level into more detailed data sets at the lower level.  For example, a command ''Select'' at the high level could be decomposed into three events: ''MouseDown'', ''MouseMove'', ''MouseUp'' at the lower level.

Ipate and Holcombe mention several kinds of refinement, including ''functional refinement'', in which the behaviour of the processing functions is elaborated in more detail, and ''state refinement'', in which a simple state-space is partitioned into a more complex state-space.&lt;ref name="HolIp98" /&gt;  Ipate proves these two kinds of refinement to be eventually equivalent&lt;ref name="Ip95"&gt;Florentin Ipate (1995) ''Theory of X-Machines with Applications in Specification and Testing'', PhD Thesis, Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield.&lt;/ref&gt;

Systems are otherwise specified down to the level at which the designer is prepared to trust the primitive operations supported by the implementation environment.  It is also possible to test small units exhaustively by other testing methods.

=== Design-For-Test Conditions ===

The (Stream) X-Machine methodology requires the designer to observe certain [[design for test]] conditions.  These are typically not too difficult to satisfy.  For each [[Stream X-Machine]] in the specification, we must obtain:

* '''Minimal Specification''': The specification must be a ''minimal'' [[finite state machine]].  This means that the state machine should not contain redundant states, that is, states in which the observable transition behaviour is identical to that in some other state.
* '''Deterministic Specification''': For each state of the machine, at most one of the processing functions φ should be [[Stream X-Machine#The Stream X-Machine|enabled]] for the current memory and next input value.  This ensures that the required behaviour to be tested is predictable.
* '''Test Completeness''': Each processing function φ must be executable for at least one input, with respect to all memory states.  This ensures that there are no deadlocks, where the machine is blocked by the current state of memory.  To ensure test completeness, the [[domain of a function]] φ may be extended with special ''test inputs'' that are only used during testing.
* '''Output Distinguishability''': It must be possible to distinguish which processing function was invoked from its output value alone, for all memory-input pairs.  This ensures that the state machine can be decoupled from the processing functions.  To ensure output distinguishability, the [[codomain]] of a function φ may be extended with special ''test outputs'' that are only relevant during testing.

A minimal machine is the machine with the fewest states and transitions for some given behaviour.  Keeping the specification minimal simply ensures that the test sets are as small as possible.  A deterministic machine is required for systems that are predictable.  Otherwise, an implementation could make an arbitrary choice regarding which transition was taken.  Some recent work has relaxed this assumption to allow testing of non-deterministic machines.&lt;ref name="IpHol00"&gt;F. Ipate and M. Holcombe (2000) 'Testing non-deterministic X-machines'.  In: ''Words, Sequences, Grammars, Languages: Where Biology, Computer Science, Linguistics and Mathematics Meet, Vol II'', eds. C Martin-Vide and V. Mitrana, Kluwer.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Test completeness is needed to ensure that the implementation is testable within tractable time.  For example, if a system has distant, or hard-to-reach states that are only entered after memory has reached a certain limiting value, then special test inputs should be added to allow memory to be bypassed, forcing the state machine into the distant state.  This allows all (abstract) states to be covered quickly during testing.  Output distinguishability is the key property supporting the scalable testing method.  It allows the tester to treat the processing functions φ as simple labels, whose detailed behaviour may be safely ignored, while testing the state machine of the next integration layer.  The unique outputs are witness values, which guarantee that a particular function was invoked.

== Testing Method ==

The (Stream) X-Machine Testing Method assumes that both the design and the implementation can be considered as (a collection of) [[Stream X-Machine]]s.  For each pair of corresponding machines (''Spec'', ''Imp''), the purpose of testing is to determine whether the behaviour of ''Imp'', the machine of the implementation, exactly matches the behaviour of ''Spec'', the machine of the specification.  Note that ''Imp'' need not be a minimal machine - it may have more states and transitions than ''Spec'' and still behave in an identical way.

To test all behaviours, it must be possible to drive a machine into all of its states, then attempt all possible transitions (those which should succeed, and those which should be blocked) to achieve full ''positive'' and ''negative'' testing (see above).  For transitions which succeed, the destination state must also be verified.  Note that if ''Spec'' and ''Imp'' have the same number of states, the above describes the smallest test-set that achieves the objective.  If ''Imp'' has more states and transitions than ''Spec'', longer test sequences are needed to guarantee that ''redundant'' states in ''Imp'' also behave as expected.

=== Testing all States ===

The basis for the test generation strategy is Tsun S. Chow's W-Method for testing finite state automata,&lt;ref name="Chow78" /&gt; chosen because it supports the testing of redundant implementations.  Chow's method assumes simple [[finite state machine]]s with observable inputs and outputs, but no directly observable states.  To map onto Chow's formalism, the functions φ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; on the transitions of the [[Stream X-Machine]]s are treated simply as labels (inputs, in Chow's terms) and the distinguishing outputs are used directly.  (Later, a mapping from real inputs and memory (''mem'', ''in'') is chosen to trigger each function φ, according to its domain).

To identify specific states in ''Imp'', Chow chooses a ''characterization set, W'', the smallest set of test sequences that uniquely characterizes each state in ''Spec''.  That is, when starting in a given state, exercising the sequences in ''W'' should yield at least one observable difference, compared to starting in any other state.

To reach each state expected in ''Spec'', the tester constructs the ''state cover, C'', the smallest set of test sequences that reaches every state.  This can be constructed by automatic breadth-first exploration of ''Spec''.  The test-set which validates all the states of a minimal ''Imp'' is then: ''C'' &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; ''W'', where &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; denotes the ''concatenated product'' of the two sets.  For example, if ''C'' = {&lt;''a''&gt;, &lt;''b''&gt;} and ''W'' = {&lt;''c''&gt;, &lt;''d''&gt;}, then ''C'' &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; ''W'' = {&lt;''ac''&gt;, &lt;''ad''&gt;,&lt;''bc''&gt;, &lt;''bd''&gt;}.

=== Testing all Transitions ===

The above test-set determines whether a minimal ''Imp'' has the same states as ''Spec''.  To determine whether a minimal ''Imp'' also has the same transition behaviour as ''Spec'', the tester constructs the ''transition cover, K''.  This is the smallest set of test sequences that reaches every state and then attempts every possible transition once, from that state.  Now, the input alphabet consists of (the labels of) every function φ in Φ.  Let us construct a set of length-1 test sequences, consisting of single functions chosen from Φ, and call this Φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.  The transition cover is defined as ''K'' &lt;code&gt;::=&lt;/code&gt; ''C'' &lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt; ''C'' &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; Φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

This will attempt every possible transition from every state.  For those which succeed, we must validate the destination states. So, the smallest test-set ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; which completely validates the behaviour of a minimal ''Imp'' is given by:  ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ::= ''C'' &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; ''W'' &lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt; ''C'' &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; Φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; ''W''.  This formula can be rearranged as:

  ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;code&gt;::=&lt;/code&gt; ''C'' &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; (Φ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt; Φ &lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; ''W'',

where Φ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the set containing the empty sequence {&lt;&gt;}.
  
If ''Imp'' has more states than ''Spec'', the above test-set may not be sufficient to guarantee the conformant behaviour of replicated states in ''Imp''.  So, sets of longer test sequences are chosen, consisting of all pairs of functions Φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, all triples of functions Φ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; up to some limit Φ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;, when the tester is satisfied that ''Imp'' cannot contain chains of duplicated states longer than ''k''-1.  The final test formula is given by:

  ''T''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;code&gt;::=&lt;/code&gt; ''C'' &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; (Φ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt; Φ &lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... &lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt; Φ &lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; ''W''.

This test-set completely validates the behaviour of a non-minimal ''Imp'' in which chains of duplicated states are expected to be no longer than ''k''-1.  For most practical purposes, testing up to ''k''=2, or ''k''=3 is quite exhaustive, revealing all state-related faults in really poor implementations.
