The '''1971 [[Southeast Asian Games|Southeast Asian Peninsular Games]]''', officially known as the '''6th Southeast Asian Peninsular Games''', was a Southeast Asian multi-sport event held in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]] from 6 to 13 December 1971 with 15 sports featured in the games. In this edition of the games, host country Malaysia joined Singapore in pressuring Thailand to let the SEAP Games Federation expand to include the [[Philippines]] and [[Indonesia]], but to no avail. Thai officials felt that such expansion would be contrary to the small family affair they had intended the games to be, and would not be in keeping with the close-neighbours spirit the games was supposed to cultivate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Percy Seneviratne]] (1993) ''Golden Moments: the S.E.A Games 1959-1991'' [[Dominie Press]], [[Singapore]] {{ISBN|981-00-4597-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the second time Malaysia hosted the games and its first time since [[1965 Southeast Asian Peninsular Games|1965]]. The games was opened and closed by Abdul Halim, the King of Malaysia at the Stadium Merdeka. The final medal tally was led by Thailand, followed by host Malaysia and Singapore.

}}

The '''AFL Women's best and fairest''' is awarded to the [[best and fairest]] player in the [[AFL Women's]] (AFLW) during the home-and-away season, as determined by votes cast by the officiating [[Umpire (Australian rules football)|field umpires]] after each game. It is the most prestigious award for individual players in the AFLW. It is also widely acknowledged as the highest individual honour in the sport of [[women's Australian rules football]].

==Criteria==

===Voting procedure===
[[File:2017 AFL Grand Final parade – Erin Phillips.jpg|thumb|[[Erin Phillips]] was the inaugural winner of the award in 2017.]]
To determine the ''best'' player, the three field umpires (not the goal umpires or boundary umpires) confer after each home-and-away match and award three votes, two votes and one vote to the players they regard as the best, second-best and third-best in the match, respectively. On the awards night, the votes from each match are tallied, and the player or players with the highest number of votes is awarded the trophy (subject to eligibility – see below).&lt;ref name="awards"&gt;{{cite web|title=AFLW Player Awards|url=http://www.afl.com.au/womens/player-profiles/aflw-awards|work=afl.com.au|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current voting system, which is the same as that of the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL)'s [[Brownlow Medal]], has been used since the award's inception. If two or more eligible players score the equal highest number of votes, each wins a trophy.

===Ineligibility===
The ''fairest'' component of the trophy is achieved by making ineligible any player who is suspended by the AFL Tribunal during the home-and-away season. An ineligible player cannot win the award, regardless of the number of votes she has received.&lt;ref name="awards"/&gt;

A player remains eligible for the award under the following circumstances:
* she is suspended during the finals or pre-season;
* she serves a suspension in the current season which carried on from, or was earned for an offence committed in, the previous season;
* she receives any sort of club-imposed suspension which is not recognised by the AFL Tribunal;
* she is found guilty by the AFL Tribunal of an offence which attracts only a financial penalty.

Umpires cast their votes for each game independent of eligibility criteria of the players; ''i.e.'' umpires can cast votes for players who have already been suspended during that season if they perceive them to be amongst the best on the ground.

==Award ceremony==
[[File:Etihad Stadium crop.jpg|thumb|[[Docklands Stadium]], current home of the W Awards Night]]
The AFL Women's best and fairest is awarded during the W Awards Night, the official AFL Women's awards ceremony, following the [[AFL Women's Grand Final]]. The ceremony itself has become increasingly elaborate, with footballers and their dates gradually becoming more fashion-conscious, however it has a much smaller following in comparison to the Brownlow Medal ceremony. The ceremony is currently held at [[Docklands Stadium]] in Melbourne.&lt;ref name="awards"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AFLW stars glam up: Best pics from W Awards coral carpet|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2017-03-28/aflw-stars-glam-up-best-pics-from-w-awards-red-carpet|work=afl.com.au|date=28 March 2017|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6434">[[Image:Barmy Army at the SCG.JPG|right|thumb|300px|The Barmy Army chanting at the Sydney Cricket Ground]]

The '''Barmy Army''' is a company limited by guarantee, registered in England and Wales. Its Registered address is Osbourne House, 143-145 Stanwell Road, Ashford, Middlesex TW15 3QN. The company provides tickets and arranges touring parties for some of its members to follow the [[English cricket team]] in the UK and overseas. The name is also applied to followers of the team who join in with match day activities in the crowd, but do not necessarily travel as part of an organised tour. The term "barmy" is English slang for "mad".

The group, then less organised, was given its name by the Australian media during the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1994-95|1994-1995]] [[Test cricket|Test]] series in [[Australia]], reportedly for the fans' hopeless audacity in travelling all the way to Australia in the near-certain knowledge that their team would lose, and the fact that they kept on chanting encouragement to the England team even when England were losing quite badly.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/dec/01/ashes2006.cricket7 Crass and corporate - why the Barmy Army are no laughing matter] 1 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/dominic-lawson/dominic-lawson-fight-back-against-the-barmy-army-427134.html Dominic Lawson: Fight back against the Barmy Army], The Independent, 5 Dec 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It was co-founded by [[Paul Burnham]].&lt;ref name=itn /&gt;

==History==
The Barmy Army, which is now a limited company, states that it wants to "make watching cricket more fun and much more popular". The group uses [[flag]]s, [[banner]]s, [[song]]s and [[chant]]s to encourage the team and crowd participation in their activities. In contrast to the reputations of some sports fans for [[hooliganism]], the Barmy Army organisers actively discourage and avoid such behaviour.

The group engages in [[Charitable organization|charity]] work and has gained a good reputation among most cricket administrators. However, many cricket followers find their constant chanting to be annoying and disruptive, particularly during the afternoon sessions of Test matches when the chanting of the Barmy Army, fuelled by their consumption of large amounts of alcohol, often becomes a repetitive, irritating background noise; among others, the renowned cricket writer/commentator [[Christopher Martin-Jenkins]] accused them of "demeaning English cricket".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Martin-Jenkins. [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,426-1456636,00.html Vaughan's men reap dividends of bolder approach] [[The Times]], 26 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

"Barmy Army" was a [[football chant]] sung by fans at many grounds, originally sung at Hillsborough by [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in the early 1980s. This was because [[Howard Wilkinson]], known as Sergeant Wilko, who was manager at the time inspired the chant, "Sergeant Wilko's Barmy Army".  In conjunction with the increasing appearance of English football shirts at cricket grounds in the early 1990s, the song's droning, repetitive cry of "Barmy Army, Barmy Army, Barmy Army" transferred to domestic Test cricket arenas at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]] and [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]]. It was particularly apparent during the 1993 [[The Ashes|Ashes]] tour.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}&lt;!--whole paragraph--&gt;
[[File:Barmy Army - The Gabba 2006.jpeg|200px|thumb|right|The Barmy Army and police at [[the Gabba]], November 2006.]]

Throughout the 1990s, increased spending power, via a stronger British Pound at the time, enabled fans to take the song overseas when following tours of the English national cricket team. Because of that particular song, and the fact that it seemed to represent English fans' activity of standing in the hot sun, drinking lager all day, until they were sunburnt and unwell, it became a description as well as a song. [[David Lloyd (cricketer)|David Lloyd]] and [[Ian Botham]] used the tag to describe the supporters whilst commentating for [[Sky Sports]] during England's tours from 1993 to 1995.

Only in the mid-1990s was the tag recognised as an official title for English touring cricket fans and adopted by what is now recognised as the official Barmy Army.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}&lt;!--For the whole paragraph--&gt;

In the late 1990s performers [[Richard Stilgoe]] and [[Peter Skellern]] recognised the need for an anthem for the loyal supporters of a team that regularly seemed to lose and wrote a stirring song called "The Barmy Army" which they included in their touring repertoire. It can be found on their 1999 CD "A Quiet Night Out" and humorously celebrates the English team's skill at "snatching defeat from the jaws of victory".

== In other sports ==
Supporters of English national teams in other sports are also subsidiaries of Barmy Army. The rugby equivalent was formed in 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/Barmy-Army-Rugby-360449967469632/|title=Barmy Army Rugby|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;, they also form part of the Army to support [[British and Irish Lions]], while there is another separate subsidiary for Rugby League.

Ferrare|author3=P.G. Ziglio|display-authors=2|last4=Droghetti|first4=P|last5=Codeca|first5=L}}&lt;/ref&gt; intended to measure an individual's maximum [[Anaerobic threshold|anaerobic]] and [[Aerobic threshold|aerobic]] threshold [[heart rate]]s.

The test measures a person's heart rates at different loads (e.g. faster speeds on a treadmill).  The points are plotted on a graph with heart rate on one axis and power (or some correlated measurement such as running speed) on the other axis; the graph's deflection point indicates the [[aerobic threshold]]. The heart rate increases (approximately) linearly up to the deflection point, where the heart rate reaches AT (also known as LT, [[lactate threshold]], in more modern nomenclature). The test continues for a while, under increasing load, until the subject has gone well past the [[Anaerobic exercise#Anaerobic threshold|anaerobic threshold]].

==Accuracy==

'''Cooley Law School Stadium''' (previously known as '''Oldsmobile Park''') is a [[baseball stadium]] in [[Lansing, Michigan]], home field of the [[Lansing Lugnuts]] [[minor league baseball]] team. The [[Michigan State Spartans]] [[college baseball]] team also plays select home games at Cooley Law School Stadium. The stadium is situated in downtown Lansing in the Stadium District on a relatively narrow strip of land between and below [[Interstate 96 Business (Lansing, Michigan)|Larch and Cedar streets]].

It is primarily used for [[baseball]], though it has also hosted an ice skating rink, an outdoor movie theater, a haunted house, and served as a concert venue for the annual [[Common Ground Music Festival]].  Due to the dimensions of the city block in which the stadium was constructed, the right and left field fences 'notch' sharply into distances of {{convert|305|ft}} at each foul pole.

==History==
The stadium replaced a block of storefronts along [[Capitol Loop|Michigan Avenue]].  Originally budgeted $10 million for construction, the construction costs rose slightly to $12.8 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=City of Lansing and Lugnuts Announce Exciting New Developments at Oldsmobile Park|url=http://www.lansinglugnuts.com/fan_action/101404.html|publisher=Minor League Baseball|date=October 14, 2004|accessdate=May 27, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041103204024/http://www.lansinglugnuts.com/fan_action/101404.html|archivedate=November 3, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Groundbreaking]] for the stadium took place on April 3, 1995, and it was officially opened exactly one year later on April 3, 1996. Its first game was between the [[college baseball]] teams of the [[University of Michigan]] and [[Michigan State University]].  Two days later, the Lansing Lugnuts had their first game at the venue against the [[Rockford Cubbies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cooley Law School Stadium Facts|url=http://cooleylawschoolstadium.com/park-guide/stadium-facts|publisher=Cooley Law School Stadium|accessdate=May 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 22, 2010, Lansing mayor [[Virgil Bernero]] announced that the stadium would be renamed [[Western Michigan University Cooley Law School|Thomas M. Cooley Law School]] Stadium, a result of the park's new sponsorship agreement.&lt;ref name="Cooley Stadium"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lugnuts Ballpark Soon Will be Cooley Law School Stadium |first=Melissa |last=Domsic |url=http://www.lansingstatejournal.com/article/20100222/NEWS01/2220338 |newspaper=[[Lansing State Journal]] |date=February 22, 2010 |accessdate=February 22, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 2010, Lansing-based [[Jackson National Life]] Insurance Company purchased the rights to name the field "Jackson Field" for 1 year.  Thus, the full name of the venue is Jackson Field at Thomas M. Cooley Law School Stadium.&lt;ref name="Jackson Field"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jackson National Lands Lugnuts Field Naming Rights|url=http://www.lansingstatejournal.com/article/20100322/NEWS03/303220002/Jackson-National-lands-Lugnuts-field-naming-rights|newspaper=[[Lansing State Journal]]|date=March 22, 2010|accessdate=March 22, 2010}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 2014, a $22 million renovation proposal for the stadium was announced named '''The Outfield'''.  It would include $11 million in public bonds for renovation of the actual stadium structure including new turf, and updated locker rooms, concessions and new box seats.  $11 million in additional private investments which would include 80 apartments, a year-round bar and grill, and a new scoreboard.  The proposal also includes the city negotiating a new contract with the team which is proposed to bring in an additional 25% revenue for the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anders|first=Melissa|title=Living above the outfield: Lansing Lugnuts' stadium renovation plan includes apartments, restaurants|url=http://www.mlive.com/lansing-news/index.ssf/2014/03/lansing_lugnuts_apartments_bas.html|accessdate=24 March 2014|newspaper=MLive.com|date=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|French Defense, Exchange Variation}}
In [[chess]], an '''exchange variation''' is a type of [[chess opening|opening]] in which there is an early, voluntary exchange of pawns or pieces. Such variations are often quieter than other lines because the early release of tension minimizes the possibility of surprise tactics or sharp, forcing lines, particularly where it results in a symmetrical [[pawn structure]]. 
{{algebraic notation|pos=toc}}

==Intents and implications==
[[White and Black in chess|White]] may choose an exchange variation as a relatively risk-free way to try to exploit White's [[First-move advantage in chess|first-move advantage]]. Players such as [[Mikhail Botvinnik]] and [[Yasser Seirawan]] used the Exchange Variation of the [[Slav Defense]] this way.

White may also play an exchange variation in an effort to draw the game. This approach is not without risks. [[International Master]] [[John L. Watson]] has written that in the Exchange Variation of the [[French Defense]], "Black can always make the struggle an unbalanced one if he chooses".&lt;ref&gt;John L. Watson, ''Play the French'', Pergamon Press, 1986, p. 28. {{ISBN|0-08-026929-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, playing so blatantly for a draw may place a psychological burden on White: "White has already ceded the advantage of the first move, and he knows it, whereas Black is challenged to find ways to seize the initiative."&lt;ref&gt;Watson 1986, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all exchange variations are quiet; the Exchange Variation of the [[Grunfeld Defence|Grunfeld Defense]] is regarded as one of White's sharpest and most aggressive options, since it allows White to build up a massive pawn center, which Black will try to undermine. The Exchange Variation of the [[Queen's Gambit Declined]] often involves attacks by one or both sides on the enemy king.

Exchange variations involving the exchange of pawns often lead to symmetrical central pawn structures, as in the Slav Defense and the French Defense, among others. The resulting pawn structures may also be asymmetrical, as in the [[Caro-Kann Defence|Caro-Kann Defense]] and Queen's Gambit Declined. In the [[Ruy Lopez, Exchange Variation]] pieces (White's bishop and Black's knight) rather than pawns are traded. In the Exchange Variation of the [[Grunfeld Defence|Grunfeld Defense]], both a pair of pawns and a pair of knights are traded.

The diagram at right shows a position in the Exchange Variation of the French Defense, after the moves:
:'''1. e4 e6'''
:'''2. d4 d5'''
:'''3. exd5 exd5'''

The position is completely symmetrical and White's advantage is limited to his right to move. The Exchange French is usually regarded as a passive alternative selected by a White player eager for a draw, but [[Paul Morphy]] and more recently [[Garry Kasparov]] have used it as a winning try.

==Openings with exchange variations==
* [[Caro-Kann Defence|Caro-Kann Defense]] (1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 cxd5)
* [[French Defence|French Defense]] (1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 exd5)
* [[Grünfeld Defence|Grünfeld Defense]] (1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5 4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.e4 Nxc3 6.bxc3)
* [[Queen's Gambit Declined]] (1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.cxd5 exd5; often White delays the exchange for one or more moves)
* [[Ruy Lopez, Exchange Variation]] (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Bxc6; deferred exchange variations are also known, such as 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Bxc6, the so-called Delayed Exchange Ruy Lopez Deferred (DERLD))
* [[Slav Defense]] (1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.cxd5 cxd5)
* [[Alekhine Defense]] (1.e4 Nf6 2.e5 Nd5 3.d4 d6 4.c4 Nb6 5.exd6)

'''F.C. Boca Gibraltar''' is a football team from [[Gibraltar]]. They play in the [[Gibraltar Premier Division]] having previously played in the [[Gibraltar Second Division]] and they also play in the [[Rock Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;http://gibraltarfa.com/domestic-football/cup/rock-cup&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The club was founded as '''Boca Juniors Gibraltar F.C.''' in 2012, and joined the [[Gibraltar Second Division]] for the 2012-13 season. After the [[Gibraltar Football Association]] joined [[UEFA]] in 2013, the league saw significant expansion and an influx of foreign players, however, a 10th place finish in the 14 team league was all they could muster in the [[2014–15 Gibraltar Second Division|2014–15 season]]. After rebuilding the squad in the now 12 team division, the team finished 8th in the [[2015–16 Gibraltar Second Division|2015–16 season]].

Significant improvements after the departure of [[Red Imps F.C.|Red Imps]], [[Pegasus F.C.|Pegasus]] and [[F.C. Britannia XI|Britannia]] from the league saw an impressive 3rd place finish in 2017, while the club began referring to themselves as simply '''Boca Gibraltar'''. However, 7 points separated Boca from the top two teams, and they missed out on the promotion play-off. A restructuring in summer 2017 saw former goalkeeper and club captain Philip Hermida promoted to Director of Football, with the intention of challenging for promotion in 2018. A 1-1 draw with Ocean Village rivals [[F.C. Bruno's Magpies|Bruno's Magpies]] on the final day secured the Second Division title by a single point on 22 May 2018, ensuring that Boca will play in the [[Gibraltar Premier Division]] for the first time next season.

'''Fleet racing''' is a form of competitive [[Sailing (sport)|sailing]] that involves [[sailboat]]s racing one another over a set course. It is the most common form of sailboat racing and contrasts with [[match race|match racing]] and [[team racing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sailing For Dummies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ukOmqlx7u-QC&amp;pg=PA269&amp;dq=fleet+racing&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yHgfTemXFIPfceehsAM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=fleet%20racing&amp;f=false|year=2006|publisher=For Dummies|isbn=0-471-79143-1|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleet racing can take place in two main formats. In the [[one-design|"One-Design"]] basis, all boats in the fleet are of the same class (i.e., the same design, length, and sail area). Alternatively, different classes of boats can race on a [[Handicapping|handicap]] basis, where faster classes give time to slower classes either by starting the race later or having their finishing times adjusted after the race's completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sailing For Dummies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ukOmqlx7u-QC&amp;pg=PA269&amp;dq=fleet+racing&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yHgfTemXFIPfceehsAM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=fleet%20racing&amp;f=false|year=2006|publisher=For Dummies|isbn=0-471-79143-1|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Racing can occur around or between [[buoy]]s or geographical features such as islands, and take place over short inshore courses or long distances offshore (such as the [[Volvo Ocean Race]]). 

The [[Racing Rules of Sailing|rules for fleet racing]] are set by [[World Sailing]] and can be supplemented by race-specific rules set by the organisers of a particular race.&lt;ref name="Robinson310"/&gt; Contraventions of the rules are resolved either by a boat voluntarily taking a penalty during the race, or by protest lodged and heard after the race. The rules of match racing, on the other hand, are normally enforced by umpires issuing penalties during a race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slsailing.com/2010/06/%E2%80%9Cmatch-racing%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%93-part-ii-what-is-match-racing/|title=“Match Racing” – Part II: What is Match Racing?|last=Woodget|first=Bea|date=11 June 2010|work=SL Sailing|accessdate=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleet racing involves fewer strategic and tactical considerations for the sailor than match racing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Lissa|last2=Nelson|first2=Maria Burton|title=Nike Is a Goddess: The History of Women in Sports|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SOwKTgEnTBsC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=fleet+racing+match+racing&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=N3sfTfCFK8jCcfjm7NcK&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=fleet%20racing%20match%20racing&amp;f=false|year=1999|publisher=Atlantic Monthly Press|isbn=0-87113-761-5|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fleet racing, the most important factor in the outcome of a race is usually the speed of each boat.&lt;ref name="Robinson310"/&gt; Three-time Olympic sailing gold medallist [[Ben Ainslie]], who made a foray into match racing for the [[2007 America's Cup]], has described the differences between fleet racing and match racing as "huge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/4561893.stm|title=Ainslie denies Cup role misery|date=19 May 2005|work=[[BBC Sport]]|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grandmaster''' (or '''Grand Master''') and '''Master''' are titles used to describe or address some senior or experienced [[martial arts|martial artists]]. Typically these titles are honorary in nature, meaning that they do not confer rank, but rather distinguish the individual as very highly revered in their school, system, or style.

== History ==
Asian martial arts traditionally use terms that are usually translated as "[[teacher]]"&lt;ref name="aznhealth"/&gt; and the use of "[[Wikt:Master|master]]" was a [[Western culture|Western]] invention derived from 1950s [[United States]] war veterans returning home&lt;ref name="aznhealth"/&gt;{{clarify|date=October 2014}}&lt;!--whoever wrote this does not seem to be aware that 'master' is a perfectly mundane title given to anyone authorised to teach any craft, nothing 'exalted' about the term itself.--&gt; 
with stories of the incredible martial feats of certain individuals and groups. Subsequently, they found their way into martial arts culture as marketing tactics to the extent that the titles are aligned to the 'elderly martial arts master' stock character. In Asian countries, such titles are more commonly reserved for religious leaders and saints.&lt;ref name="aznhealth"/&gt;

== Modern use ==
The use of "master," "grandmaster," etc. is decided within an individual art or organization. The use may be self assigned; for example having promoted a student to 'teacher' level, or may be assigned by a governing body in arts with a more formalised structure, and some do not use it at all, for historic reasons or to avoid the 'elderly master' stereotype. The modern use of [[Dan (rank)|''Dan'']] rankings and [[Black belt (martial arts)|Black belt]] and [[Red belt (martial arts)|Red belt]] in martial arts both derive from [[Judo]] where they were adopted by its founder [[Kanō Jigorō]].&lt;ref name=Ranks&gt;[http://www.judoinfo.com/ranks.htm Ranking Systems in Modern Japanese Martial Arts: Modern vs. Classical] by [[Donn F. Draeger]], Lecture on 1 April 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traditional systems ==
There are many terms similar or equivalent to 'grandmaster' used by various martial arts traditions.  Some of these terms derive from older systems, while others are relatively modern.

=== Japan ===
[[Japanese martial arts]] commonly use '''''[[Sensei]]''''' (先生) meaning "teacher" or literally translated, "born first"&lt;ref name="aznhealth" /&gt; or "one who has gone before".&lt;ref name="judoinfo"&gt;[http://www.judoinfo.com/sensei1.htm What is a Sensei?] Neil Ohlenkamp, judoinfo.com&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Sensei'' is a person who has knowledge and is willing to teach that knowledge to another. A ''Sensei'' assists students in ''ken shiki'' "the pursuit of knowledge".&lt;ref name="judoinfo" /&gt;  Some organizations, such as the [[Bujinkan]], [[Kodokan]] (Judo), and [[Shodokan Aikido]], use the term '''''[[shihan]]''''' for high-ranking or highly distinguished instructors.
{{Nihongo|'''''[[Sōke]]'''''|宗家}},  meaning "the head family [house],"&lt;ref&gt;Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; is sometimes used to refer to "founder of a style" because many modern sōke are the first generation headmasters of their art, but most correctly refers to the current head. A sōke is considered the ultimate authority within their art and has the authority to issue a ''[[menkyo kaiden]]'' certificate indicating that someone has mastered all aspects of the style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koryubooks.com/library/wbodiford1.html#b1 Soke: Historical Incarnations of a Title and its Entitlements by William M. Bodiford ]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Korea ===
The actual Korean word for a student's master is '''''sonsaeng'''''. This term is only used by the student when speaking to the instructor. The student is ''hakseang''.&lt;ref name="MAFCI"&gt;[http://www.mafci.com/terminology/ Korean Terminology] Martial Arts Fitness Centers, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; (학생 HakSaeng 學生)  Many Korean titles are often mistakenly translated as "grandmaster" (태사님 TaeSaNim 太師님). '''''Sonseang-nim''''' (선생님 SeonSaengNim 先生님) is a general term for a teacher of any subject as well as a respectful form of the word "you". Martial arts instructors (in Korea 4th Dan and above) are called ''Sabom-nim'' (사범님 SaBeomNim 師範님).

=== China ===
Various dialects of the [[Chinese language]] use different terms.

"Sifu" is a common romanization, although the term and pronunciation are also used in other southern languages. In [[Mandarin Chinese]], it is spelled "shifu" in [[pinyin]]. Using [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]] British English pronunciation, in Mandarin it would sound something similar to "sure foo". Using [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], 'shi' is pronounced 'ʂɨ'. The 'i' is a short vowel. Many martial arts studios incorrectly pronounce this like "she foo". In Cantonese, it is said as "see foo" (almost like "sea food", without the "d" on the end).
(師傅 or 師父; [[Pinyin]]: ''shīfu'', Standard pinyin: ''si1 fu6'') a modern term for "teacher".

The term ''Shifu'' is a combination of the characters "teacher" and "father" (師父) or a combination of the characters "teacher" and "mentor" (師傅). The traditional Chinese martial arts school, or ''[[kwoon]]'' (館, guǎn) is an extended family headed by the Shifu. The Shifu's teacher is the "師公 honorable master" or ''Shigong''. Similarly the Shifu's wife is the ''Shimu'' "teacher mother" and the  grandmaster's wife is known as: 師姥 shi lao; or  師婆 shi po. Male and female students who began training before you and are thus senior, are 師兄''Shixiong'' "teacher older brothers" and  師姐 ''Shijie'' "teacher's sisters". Women in traditional society did not have the same status as males (despite what modern movies depict). Students junior to you are your ''Shidi'' and ''Shimei''. The pattern extends to uncles, aunts, cousins, great uncles, and so forth (see above for a complete list of relational terms).&lt;ref name="aznhealth" /&gt;

== Popular culture ==
Such titles may be, to some extent, aligned to the ''[[elderly martial arts master]]'' stock character in fiction. In [[Oriental]] martial arts, traditional titular systems vary between nations and arts, but terms such as "[[teacher]]"&lt;ref name="aznhealth"&gt;[http://www.aznhealth.com/column2/master.html Master vs. Sifu in Chinese Martial Arts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018090141/http://www.aznhealth.com/column2/master.html |date=2006-10-18 }} Traditional Asian Health Center&lt;/ref&gt; were more common than "master." The modern use came from Eastern to Western society in the 1950s with stories of martial feats seen in [[Asia]].

The '''Grosser Preis von Baden''' is a [[Group races|Group 1]] [[Flat racing|flat]] [[Horse racing|horse race]] in Germany open to [[thoroughbred]]s aged three years or older. It is run at [[Baden-Baden]] over a distance of 2,400 metres (about 1½ miles), and it is scheduled to take place each year in early September.

==History==
The event was established in 1858, and it was originally contested over 3,200 metres. The inaugural running was part of a three-day festival which celebrated the opening of Baden-Baden's Iffezheim Racecourse.

The race was shortened to 2,800 metres in 1887. It was titled the Jubiläums-Preis on several occasions during the 1890s. Its distance was cut to 2,200 metres in 1894, and extended to 2,400 metres in 1898.

The Grosser Preis von Baden was staged at [[Hoppegarten]] from 1942 to 1944. It was not contested from 1945 to 1947, and it was known as the Grosser Preis von Iffezheim in 1948 and 1949.

The present system of race grading was introduced in Germany in 1972, and the Grosser Preis von Baden was classed at Group 1 level. It was run in two separate divisions in 1974.

The race has had several different sponsors since the mid-1990s, and these have included [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Volkswagen]] and [[Longines]].

The Grosser Preis von Baden was added to the [[Breeders' Cup Challenge]] series in 2012. The winner earned an automatic invitation to compete in the same year's [[Breeders' Cup Turf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 2012 Breeders' Cup Challenge Schedule | url = https://members.breederscup.com/doc%20repository/other/ChallengeSchedule.pdf | publisher = breederscup.com | accessdate = 29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The race was removed from the series after the 2017 running.

'''Hanes Field''' was a [[minor league baseball]] and [[American football|football]] stadium that was located on the campus of Trinity College (now the East Campus of [[Duke University]]) in [[Durham, North Carolina]], named for P. H. Hanes.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=HaVIAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA4-PA95&lt;/ref&gt; Hanes Field opened in 1913 and was home to the [[Durham Bulls]] from 1913-1925. The Bulls moved to their new home of El Toro Park in 1926 (renamed [[Durham Athletic Park]] in 1934) and played there until 1994. The team now plays at [[Durham Bulls Athletic Park]] since 1995. 

Hanes Field was replaced in 1995 by a new field hockey stadium, but the construction of that stadium was basically a transformation of Hanes Field into a field hockey stadium. The field hockey stadium is called [[Jack Katz Stadium]] and opened in 1996.

Hiking apparel is usually selected to suit predicted [[weather]] conditions, taking into account [[Ultraviolet protection factor|UPF]] rating (Ultraviolet Protection Factor), weight, water and wind resistance.  Today's hiking apparel is more advanced than previous years, having material that can be wind resistant, [[Waterproofing#In clothing|water-repellent]] and yet breathable, and lightweight. Some hiking apparel is designed to be "breathable", drawing moisture away from the body while protecting from the weather. 

Usually three layers of apparel are worn on a rough-weather hike, the first being mostly of synthetic material drawing moisture from the body, the second being of material with high thermal insulation capacity, and the third being of wind- and water-resistant material.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=COWYE6LxZHwC&amp;pg=PA202|year=2000|title=The complete idiot's guide to camping and hiking|isbn=978-0-02-863186-8|author=Michael Moulan|chapter=ch. 16 - Ways to Dress for Success in the Outdoors}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://hikingapparelguide.com/|title=Hiking Apparel Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's hiking boots have been designed to give maximum [[ankle]] support, and to be durable but light in weight. Many have a long-lasting hardened rubber [[Sole (shoe)|sole]].

'''Infield''' is a sports term whose definition depends on the sport in whose context it is used.

== Baseball ==

In [[baseball]] the [[baseball diamond]] plus a region beyond it, has both grass and dirt, in contrast to the more distant, usually grass-covered ''outfield''. It also refers to the defensive unit of players that are positioned in the region: [[first baseman]], [[second baseman]], [[shortstop]], [[third baseman]]. Sometimes it includes the [[catcher]] and [[pitcher]] who (as a tandem) are often referred to separately as the [[Battery (baseball)|battery]].

In baseball the physical infield is where most of the action in a baseball game occurs, as it includes that area where the all-important duel between the [[pitcher]] and [[batting (baseball)|batter]] takes place.&lt;ref&gt;Baseball Explained by Phillip Mahony, McFarland Books, 2014. See [http://www.baseballexplained.com www.baseballexplained.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813034018/http://www.baseballexplained.com/ |date=2014-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pitcher stands on the [[pitcher's mound]] (a raised mound of dirt located at the center of the infield) and from there he pitches the ball to his [[catcher]], who is crouched behind home plate sixty feet, six inches away at what might be called the cutlet of the diamond-shaped baseball field. To the left and right of the catcher are chalk boxes in the dirt called [[Baseball_field#Batter.27s_box_and_catcher.27s_box|batter's boxes]]. The opposing team's batter must stand in one of the two boxes and from there he will attempt to hit the pitched ball with his bat. The [[umpire]], who officiates the game, stands behind the catcher. The other important parts of the infield are the three [[base (baseball)|bases]], [[first base]] (to the pitcher's left, looking toward home plate), [[second base]] (behind the pitcher) and [[third base]] (to the pitcher's right). Together, home plate and the three bases form a diamond around the pitcher, with each side of the diamond measuring 90 feet.&lt;ref&gt;Baseball Explained by Phillip Mahony, McFarland Books, 2014. See [http://www.baseballexplained.com www.baseballexplained.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813034018/http://www.baseballexplained.com/ |date=2014-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cricket ==

In [[cricket]] infield is a central oval on the [[cricket field]], the reference point for fielding restrictions in short forms of the game; in contrast to the more distant ''outfield''

==Tracks==
Infield can refer to a region inside a closed [[horse racing]] or [[auto racing]] track, or to an area encircled by the track of a [[roller coaster]].

'''Laugardalsvöllur''' ({{IPA-is|ˈløiːɣar.talsˌvœtl̥ʏr̥}}) is [[Iceland]]'s [[national stadium|national football stadium]] and the home venue for the [[Iceland national football team]]. It is in [[Reykjavík]] and seats 9,800 with a total capacity of 15,000.

==History==
The idea of building a sport venue in Laugardalur, along with some other entertainment facilities, dates back to 1871. At that time, the population of Reykjavík, the capital of Iceland, was only about 2,000. Laugardalur was also nearly 3&amp;nbsp;km (1.9&amp;nbsp;mi) away from residential areas. Little came out of this proposal the next 60 years or so.

In 1943, the town council set up the Laugardalsnefnd committee. Its task was to make proposals and ideas for the area. The committee then delivered the result later, which included building a new football stadium and a [[Laugardalslaug|new swimming pool]].

Construction of the field started in 1949 and lasted until 1952. A year later in 1953, construction of a new stand started. The stand had a capacity of 4,000 when completed.

The first match was played on Laugardalsvöllur in 1957 when the [[Iceland national football team|Iceland men's national football team]] played against [[Norway national football team|Norway]], two years before the official opening on 17 June 1959. A few years later, the stand was renovated and expanded, starting from 1965 to 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://2012.skjaladagur.is/?p=488|title=Íþróttaleikvangur Reykjavíkur í LaugardalSaga framkvæmdanna|date=6 November 2012|language=is-IS|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the new stand there was opened a [[Track and field|track-and-field]] facility, which operated until 2007, although there has always been [[all-weather running track]] around the pitch (upgraded in 1992). Later the year 1992, floodlights were inaugurated for the match against [[Greece national football team|Greece]].

In 1997, another new stand was built against the old stand, across the pitch. Constructions started a year earlier. It has a capacity of 3,500. At the same time, the old stand was relieved by matching it with the new stand by seating capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/343832/|title=Ártöl í sögu knattspyrnunnar á Íslandi 1892 "Knattleikur er t.d. flestra unglinga yndi og mætti tíðka hann miklu meira en gert|website=www.mbl.is|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Big renovation and expansion of the old stand started in 2005. After the completion in 2007, the stadium has a capacity of 9,800. Additional capacity can be added by bringing in two temporary stands seating 1,500 each, giving the stadium a [[maximum]] capacity of 15,000 but after the new requirements of [[FIFA]] for national football stadiums, this addition method has been forbidden. No major renovations or expansions have occurred since  2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rúnarsson|first=Kristján Jens|date=1 January 2016|title=Stækkun Laugardalsvallar : Er skynsamlegt fyrir Reykjavíkurborg að taka þátt í hugsanlegum breytingum?|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1946/25150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest attendance for a football match ever seen by Laugardalsvöllur was 20,204 in 2004 in a [[Exhibition game|friendly match]] between Iceland and [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. The largest attendance for the venue about 25,000 during a concert in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ksi.is/mannvirki/laugardagsvollur/|title=Þjóðarleikvangur Íslands {{!}} Knattspyrnusamband Íslands|website=www.ksi.is|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 July 2018, American rock band [[Guns N' Roses]] played at the stadium in font of 25,000 people, at that time the largest rock concert ever held in Iceland. &lt;ref&gt;http://icelandmag.is/article/interview-axl-rose-guns-nroses-reykjavik-concert-largest-icelandic-history&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facilities ==
The stadium comprises two big stands facing each other. West Stand is the main stand and the larger one. It is the only stand to hold all the facilities needed for the stadium, excluding [[stadium seating]]. For the purpose of football matches and other competitions, the stand has 4 changing rooms for players (mainly) and 2 others for [[referee]]s, which also have the capability of accommodating facility for a doctor or [[drug test]]. There are two other rooms for football matches and [[Sport of athletics|athletics tournaments]] administration.

== Future ==
There have been plans to renovate and expand Laugardalsvöllur since [[Iceland national football team|Iceland men's national football team]] reached play-off for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] in 2013. The team's success kept going until they went to [[UEFA Euro 2016]] and reached [[quarter-finals]]. Both Icelandic football fans and [[Football Association of Iceland|KSÍ (the Football Association of Iceland)]] have been asking for new stadium because seats have sold out for nearly all official matches (even friendly matches) since 2013.

Several ways are available, but all of them have at least two things in common: removing the running track and cover the stadium. KSÍ has stated that it wants a [[Retractable roof stadium|retractable-roof stadium]] for the possibility of [[multi-purpose stadium]], that would increase the utilization of seating capacity in the long term.

There are stadiums in Europe that can be used as a guide for Iceland. They are all big and extremely expensive on the local scale. The upcoming construction of Laugardalsvöllur is, for instance, expected to cost about 8&amp;nbsp;billion [[Icelandic króna|ISK]] (about €62&amp;nbsp;million). If built, the new national football stadium of Iceland is likely to have a capacity of 20,000 or more.

The pitch itself would have to be dug many meters in the ground since the running track is to be removed and the bottom edge of the stadium will be moved closer to the pitch. By doing that, the stadium will have a lot more capacity. The new pitch is expected to be heated if natural grass is selected, due to hard winters in Iceland and also because of the new requirements of [[UEFA]], which indicates that matches for some teams in the [[UEFA European Championship qualifying|qualification competition]], for the [[UEFA European Championship]], shall also be played in the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ruv.is/frett/hotel-og-haskoli-a-nyjum-laugardalsvelli|title=Hótel og háskóli á nýjum Laugardalsvelli?|date=26 September 2016|newspaper=RÚV|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grass would then be maintained itself with an [[Irrigation|automatic irrigation sprinkler system]].

Because the new stadium requires a retractable roof to cover the costs, it is possible that all present structures of Laugardalsvöllur will be demolished and a new, solid, oval-shaped stadium will be built; neither of the existing stands are specially designed to support additional roof that can roll back and forth on tracks, that can open and close the stadium altogether.

[[Michael Schumacher]] is a German racing driver who won seven [[Formula One]] [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|world championships]]. Schumacher entered Formula One with the [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]] racing team in 1991, qualifying seventh in his debut race at the [[Belgian Grand Prix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.espn.co.uk/f1/motorsport/story/56964.html|last=Hay-Nicholls|first=Adam|title=It was 20 years ago...|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=23 August 2011|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HoF/&gt; Following this race, he was signed by [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]] for the rest of the season.&lt;ref name=HoF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/content/fom-website/en/championship/drivers/hall-of-fame/Michael_Schumacher.html|title=Michael Schumacher|publisher=[[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]]|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first Grand Prix win came the following year at the same venue as his debut race. Schumacher won his first Formula One World Championship in 1994, a season in which he won eight races. His victory was controversial, as he was involved in a collision with fellow championship contender [[Damon Hill]] at the final race in [[Adelaide Street Circuit|Adelaide]]. Both drivers had to retire their cars which resulted in Schumacher securing the championship.&lt;ref name=HoF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/motorsport/formulaone/michael-schumacher/7718722/Michael-Schumachers-top-five-F1-controversies.html | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | title = Michael Schumacher's top five F1 controversies | date = 13 May 2010 | first = Giles | last = Mole | accessdate = 26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won his second championship the following year, winning nine races, and became the youngest double world champion at the time.&lt;ref name=sky/&gt;{{efn|[[Fernando Alonso]] broke this record in 2006, and he has since been surpassed by [[Sebastian Vettel]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/motorsport/alonso-tipped-to-equal-schumachers-success/2006/10/22/1161455610695.html|title=Alonso tipped to equal Schumacher's success|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=23 October 2006|accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/15241395|title=Sebastian Vettel 'unlikely' to break Schumacher record|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=10 October 2011|accessdate=1 June 2016|last=Benson|first=Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Schumacher joined [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] in 1996.

His most successful circuit was [[Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours|Magny-Cours]] where he won eight times in his career. Schumacher's largest margin of victory was at the [[1994 Brazilian Grand Prix]], a race in which he lapped the field, and the smallest margin of victory was at the [[2000 Canadian Grand Prix]] when he beat teammate [[Rubens Barrichello]] by 0.174 seconds.

The '''Myrtle Beach Speedway''', originally named Rambi Raceway, was built in 1958 and is located on [[U.S. Route 501]] near [[Myrtle Beach]], [[South Carolina]].

The speedway is a semi-banked [[asphalt]] oval track that spans {{convert|0.538|mi|km}}.The [[NASCAR]] Cup series competed at the Speedway from 1958 through 1965. The [[NASCAR]] Busch Series (now the [[Xfinity Series]]) raced at Myrtle Beach Speedway from 1988 to 2000.

Currently the NASCAR Whelen All-American Series race on Saturday nights from late February through November. The track also runs various other classes of racing including Late Model Charger, Super Trucks and Mini Stocks.  The speedway is home of the Myrtle Beach 400, IceBreaker 200, NASCAR Racing Experience, Monster Jam, NOPI Nationals and Horry County Fair with recent additions of Wheels of Destruction Thrill Show and the Myrtle Beach BikeFest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Start Your Engines at Myrtle Beach Speedway|url=https://www.compasscove.com/news/start-your-engines-at-myrtle-beach-speedway/|publisher=Compass Cove|accessdate=April 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Over the years, Myrtle Beach Speedway has been the training grounds for some of NASCAR’s biggest stars including [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] (former late model stock car competitor) and [[Jeff Gordon]] (former Busch Series track record holder). All four generations of Pettys (Lee, Richard, Kyle, and Adam) and three generations of Earnhardts (Ralph, Dale Sr., and Dale Jr./[[Kelley Earnhardt Miller|Kelley]]/L.W. Miller III&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newton|first=David|title=Junior took a backseat to big sis Kelley|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/nascar/cup/columns/story?id=4859211|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=March 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have taken a green flag around the asphalt oval that spans {{convert|0.538|mi|km}}.

==History==
[[File:NASCAR Racing Experience 24.jpg|thumb|right|A Late Model car belonging to The NASCAR Racing Experience]]
Rambi Raceway opened as a dirt track in 1958.

Nick Lucas bought the track in 1968, paving it in 1974. Billy Hardee became a co-owner in 1987.

A [[Nationwide Series|Busch Series]] race (the [[Myrtle Beach 250]]) in 2000 was the last major [[NASCAR]] event at the track. By 2011, the [[Whelen All-American Series|NASCAR All-American Whelen Late-Model Series]] was the highest level of racing at the track.  

In a deal that closed April, 2012, Speedway Group Inc. bought the facility, including 48 acres. Robert J. Lutz, one of the new owners, said [[Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina|Lt. Gov.]] [[André Bauer]] arranged for the deal to take place. Bauer said he wanted the track to help improve Myrtle Beach's economy with new events. Upgrades to the track are planned, and plans call for the [[NASCAR Racing Experience]] to attract drivers and tourists. One goal is another top-level race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/2012/02/25/2679961/new-owners-have-big-plans-for.html|title=New owners have big plans for Myrtle Beach Speedway|last=Kanpek|first=Kurt|work=[[The Sun News]]|date=2012-02-25|accessdate=2012-02-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228205440/http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/2012/02/25/2679961/new-owners-have-big-plans-for.html|archivedate=2012-02-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After merging the two NASCAR [[Whelen Modified Tour]]s at the end of the 2016 season, beginning in 2017, the newly unified tour started its season in Myrtle Beach.  The track will again host the season opener in 2018.

'''Pan Pong''' (also '''Panpon''', '''Pan-Pon''' or '''Pang-Pong''') is a hybrid of [[tennis]] and [[ping pong]]. The name comes from the sound when the ball is being hit from one side to the next, pan - pon - pan - pon and is played on asphalt with racquets made of wood, a soft [[tennis ball]] and a net in form a wooden plank. Rules are similar to tennis or ping-pong but is played in shorter matches of 3 games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.film.hitachi.jp/movie/movie712.html |script-title=ja:パンポン−日立発祥の市民スポーツ− |website=HitachiTheatre |publisher=Hitachi, Ltd. |accessdate=17 February 2014|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The game was invented in 1922, during the [[Taisho]] era (1912-1926), on the [[Hitachi]] Ltd. factory campus in Japan. Pan-Pon was started as a lunch exercise but has grown into a local sport in [[Ibaraki Prefecture]]. Tournaments within Hitachi plants, between plants, and among citizens in Ibaraki prefecture in Japan are organized. Outside Japan the sport is little known, but tournaments have been organized in [[Harrodsburg, Kentucky]], [[United States]], connected to the Hitachi Automotive plant there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.centralkynews.com/2004-09-20/news/24876875_1_hitachi-city-pong-courts |title=Mercer adds pang pong at the park |last=Curd |first=Bobbie |date=20 September 2004 |website=Central Kentucky News |accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rules ==

=== Court ===

Pan-pon is played on a rectangular flat court, normally outdoors on asphalt alternatively indoors on plastic floor.
The court is 7 x 2.5 m with an inner serve area of 5.5 x 1 meter. The net is made of a 3-meter wooden plank, placed 40&amp;nbsp;cm above ground.

=== Equipment ===

Pans from the kitchen are made of wood, 30 x 20&amp;nbsp;cm and ca 10&amp;nbsp;mm in thickness. A simple ledge can be mounted on one of the short sides to make it easier to hold.

The ball is an air-pumped rubber ball, size like a tennis ball (ca 70&amp;nbsp;mm diameter). If the ball is dropped from 1 meter altitude it should bounce back up 50–60&amp;nbsp;cm if it is correctly pumped.

=== The game ===

Before the match a coin is flipped to determine the first server. One of the players will serve to start the game and the serve is hit into the receivers inner serve area without touching the net/plank. 
The receiver will hit the ball back into the servers court side.

=== Scoring ===

A game consists of a sequence of points played with the same player serving. The game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total. If the score is 3-3 it is necessary to win with two points. At 4-4 it is enough to win with one point.

=== Serve ===

The serve is alternated between the players, point by point. The server must stand behind the base line and between the side lines. The receiver can stand at any place in the court. It is not allowed to hit the serve with the racket above the waist. The server only has one attempt to make a successful serve. The receiver is not allowed to hit the ball before it has touched the ground.

=== Doubles ===

If team A meets team B, first player A1 will serve with B1 as receiver. In the following game B1 serves to A2, then A2 against B2, etc.

== Nordic Pan-Pon Championships 2014 ==

In connection with the [[Nordic Microscopy Society|Nordic Microscopy]] Meeting, Scandem 2014, in [[Linköping, Sweden]], on June 9–13, 2014, the first Nordic championship in Pan-Pon will be held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scandem2014.se/ |title=Scandem 2014 |accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Powder Mountain''' is a [[ski resort]] located just east of [[Eden, Utah]], stretching between [[Weber County, Utah|Weber]] and [[Cache County|Cache]] counties, and only 55 miles from [[Salt Lake City International Airport]]. With over 8,464 acres of skiable terrain, 144 runs, snowcat skiing, side country skiing, backcountry tours and two terrain parks, Powder Mountain is the largest ski resort in the US by skiable acreage. Powder Mountain consistently tops ''Ski Magazine’s'' “Best Value Resort” category, taking home the honor five out of the past six years. With more than 300 inches of annual snowfall, Powder Mountain was ranked #2 for “Snow” and #4 for “Character” while also ranking 9th best by readers for Overall Satisfaction in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.skiutah.com/media/recent_news/powder-mountain-again-ranks-1-in&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Powder Mountain had its beginnings as the winter range for Frederick James Cobabe’s sheep herd. Between 1902 and 1948, Cobabe continually accumulated land around [[Eden, Utah]]. Old timers say that his property was severely overgrazed by previous owners and hardly a blade of grass could be found. The watershed was so poor that Wolf Creek dried up each fall. Fred’s soil conservation practices greatly improved the vegetation and Powder Mountain now is known as one of the best watersheds in the [[Wasatch Mountains]].{{cn|date=April 2013}}

Fred’s son, Dr. Alvin F. Cobabe, bought the livestock company with its 8,000 acres in 1948. While horseback riding with friends along Lightning Ridge in the 1950s, someone casually mentioned that the terrain would make a great ski resort. The idea rang true with Dr. Cobabe and he began to amass adjacent property adding to the thousands of acres acquired from his father. When the resort opened on February 19, 1972, he owned 14,000 acres.

Only the Sundown lift was open during Powder Mountain’s first season. The area was lit for night skiing and a ski school was established. Food was prepared on an outdoor barbecue. The Main Lodge, the Sundown Lodge and the Timberline lift were added to operations in the 1972–73 season.

Dr. Alvin Cobabe, at age 88, sold Powder Mountain, Inc in 2006 to Western American Holdings. The resort remained under the same management team, led by Aleta Cobabe, daughter of Alvin, during the 2006–07 season. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.powdermountain.com/en/about-mountain/history/&lt;/ref&gt;
Western American sold Powder Mountain to events company Summit in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2013/06/18/192674659/why-buy-a-house-when-you-can-buy-a-mountain Why Buy A House When You Can Buy A Mountain?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The resort today==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:James Peak.jpg|thumb|300px|left|]] --&gt;
Powder Mountain currently has six chair lifts (one triple, four fixed quad, and one detachable quad), and an additional three surface tows. Beyond lift accessed terrain, Powder Mountain also offers all-day Snowcat Powder Safaris, single ride cat skiing and inbound and backcountry guided tours through their Adventure Center. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.powdermountain.com/en/adventure/&lt;/ref&gt;

The slopes on both sides of the road leading up to the resort—known as Powder Country—are served by a bus that will pick riders up at a waiting area halfway down the access road. There is also an $25 per-ride Snowcat service up Lightning Ridge (very close to James Peak). James Peak is one of the premier powder bowl runs in [[Utah]].{{cn|date=April 2013}}

Powder Mountain’s terrain within the lift accessible area offers a wide variety of runs for riders of every skill level, including a large assortment of green, blue and black runs. With over 2,500 inbound vertical feet available and over 400 inches of annual snowfall, Powder Mountain is largely considered{{By whom|date=April 2013}} to be one of the premier powder skiing destinations in the world.

Powder Mountain also offers ski-in, ski-out condos for rent at the summit, making it a convenient getaway for skiers of all levels. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.powdermountainblog.weebly.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rose Bowl''', also known as '''Spieker Field at the Rose Bowl'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/20758957/rose-bowl-name-surface-spieker-field-10m-donation-ucla-alum]&lt;/ref&gt;, is an [[United States of America|American]] outdoor athletic [[stadium]], located in [[Pasadena, California]], a northeast suburb of [[Los Angeles]]. Opened in October 1922, the stadium is recognized as a [[National Historic Landmark]] and a California Historic Civil Engineering landmark.&lt;ref name="nhlsum" /&gt; At a modern capacity of an all-seated configuration at 90,888 (making it one of the rare stadiums in college football to have such a seating arrangement; many such stadiums have bench-style seating)&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; the Rose Bowl is the [[List of stadiums by capacity|17th-largest stadium in the world]], the [[List of U.S. stadiums by capacity|11th-largest stadium in the United States]], and the [[List of NCAA Division I FBS football stadiums|11th largest NCAA stadium]].

Since [[1982 UCLA Bruins football team|1982]], it has also served as the home stadium of the [[UCLA Bruins football]] team. The stadium has also hosted five [[Super Bowl]] games, [[Super Bowl#Host stadiums|second most of any venue]]. The Rose Bowl is also a noted [[soccer]] venue, having hosted the [[1994 FIFA World Cup Final]], [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup Final]], and the [[Football at the 1984 Summer Olympics#Gold Medal match|1984 Olympic Gold Medal Match]], as well as numerous [[CONCACAF]] and [[United States Soccer Federation]] matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rose Bowl Stadium|url=http://www.internationalchampionscup.com/venues/8569e961c2aae489f470#GuFzOYKJHvDzS0O0.97|website=InternationalChampionsCup.com|publisher=International Champions Cup|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium and adjacent Brookside Golf and Country Club are owned by the city of Pasadena and managed by the Rose Bowl Operating Company, a non-profit organization whose board is selected by council members of the city of Pasadena. UCLA and the [[Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association|Pasadena Tournament of Roses]] also have one member on the company board.

==History==
===Design and construction===
[[File:RoseBowl-construction1921.jpg|left|thumb|Construction in 1921; note the original horseshoe shape]]
The game now known as the Rose Bowl Game was played at [[Tournament Park]] though January [[1922 Rose Bowl|1922]], about {{convert|3|mi|0|spell=in}} southeast, adjacent to the campus of the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech). The [[Pasadena Tournament of Roses|Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association]], the game's organizer, realized the temporary stands were inadequate for a crowd of more than 40,000, and sought to build a better, permanent stadium.

The stadium was designed by architect [[Myron Hunt]] in 1921. His design was influenced by the [[Yale Bowl]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], which opened in 1914. The [[Arroyo Seco (Los Angeles County)|Arroyo Seco]] was selected as the location for the stadium. The Rose Bowl was under construction from Feb. 27, 1922 to October 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Stadium saucer is begun by workmen|journal=Pasadena Star-News|date=February 28, 1922|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vast Stadium Awaits Inaugural Throngs|journal=Los Angeles Times|date=October 8, 1922|volume=XLI|page=II 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nearby [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] also was under construction during this time and would be completed in May 1923, shortly after the Rose Bowl was completed. Originally built as a horseshoe, the stadium was expanded several times. The southern stands were completed in 1928, enclosing the stadium into a complete bowl.

The field's alignment is nearly north-south, offset slightly northwest, and the [[elevation]] at street level is approximately {{convert|830|ft|round=5}} above [[sea level]].

The stadium's name was alternatively "Tournament of Roses Stadium" or "Tournament of Roses Bowl", until being settled as "Rose Bowl" before the [[1923 Rose Bowl]] game,&lt;ref&gt;HUGE FLAGSTAFF FOR PASADENA. Enormous Steel Pole 122 and ½ Feet Long Will Stand in Rose Bowl. Los Angeles Times, December 10, 1922. MONDAY afternoon at 2 o'clock the new flagstaff of the Tournament of Roses stadium, now called the Rose Bowl, will be put in place with suitable ceremony under auspices of the Pasadena Lions Club, donor of the pole.&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to the unusually named (at the time) Yale Bowl.

The stadium is extremely difficult to access due to the traffic caused by single-lane residential street access. It has no dedicated parking lot for visitors and parking issues have routinely caused visitors to spend two to three hours completing the last mile to the stadium on game days. In 2016, Rose Bowl contracted [[Parkjockey|ParkJockey]] to streamline parking in and around the stadium.

There are also shuttles to help visitors get to the stadium and mobile lights powered by generators to provide visibility for people walking on the golf course at night.

===Dedication, October 1922===
The first game was a regular season contest in 1922, when [[1922 California Golden Bears football team|California]] defeated [[1922 USC Trojans football team|USC]] {{nowrap|12–0}} on October 28. This was the only loss for USC and Cal finished the season undefeated. California declined the invitation to the [[1923 Rose Bowl]] game and USC went instead. The stadium was dedicated officially on January 1, 1923, when USC defeated [[1923 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]] {{nowrap|14–3.}}

===Seating===
The stadium seating has been reconfigured several times since its construction in 1922. The South end was filled in to complete the bowl and more seats have been added. The original wooden benches were replaced by aluminum benches in 1969. All new grandstand and loge seats had been installed since 1971.&lt;ref name="UCLA1989"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Dellins  | first = Marc | title = 1989 UCLA FOOTBALL MEDIA GUIDE | place = Los Angeles| publisher = UCLA Sports Information Office | year = 1989 | chapter = The Rose Bowl  | page = 254  }}&lt;/ref&gt; New red seat backs had been added on 22,000 seats prior to the [[1980 Rose Bowl]].&lt;ref name="UCLA1989" /&gt; A Rose Bowl improvement was conducted because of UCLA's 1982 move and the [[1984 Summer Olympics]]. This resulted in new seat backs for 50,000 seats.&lt;ref name="UCLA1989" /&gt;

For many years, the Rose Bowl had the largest football stadium capacity in the United States, eventually being surpassed by [[Michigan Stadium]] (107,601).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/stadium/|title=Michigan Stadium Story|work=umich.edu|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mgoblue.com/facilities/article.aspx?id=28642 University of Michigan Official Athletics site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120092641/http://www.mgoblue.com/facilities/article.aspx?id=28642 |date=2008-01-20 }} – Michigan Stadium&lt;/ref&gt; The Rose Bowl's maximum stated [[seating capacity]] was 104,091 from 1972 to 1997.&lt;ref name="UCLA1989" /&gt; Some of the seats closest to the field were never used during this time for UCLA regular season games, and were covered by tarps. Official capacity was lowered following the [[1998 Rose Bowl]]. Slightly different figures are given for the current capacity, for the lower level seats behind the team benches are not used for some events since the spectators can not see through the standing players or others on the field. UCLA reports the capacity at 91,136.&lt;ref name ="UCLAROSEBOWL"&gt;''UCLA Football – 2007 UCLA Football (Media Guide)''. UCLA Athletic Department (2007), page 165 (PDF copy available at www.uclabruins.com)&lt;/ref&gt; The Tournament of Roses reports the capacity at 92,542.&lt;ref name="ROSEBOWLHISTORY"&gt;[http://www.rosebowlstadium.com/RoseBowl_history.htm Rose Bowl Stadium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907115147/http://www.rosebowlstadium.com/RoseBowl_history.htm |date=2009-09-07 }} – History of the Rose Bowl Stadium&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2006 Rose Bowl]] game, which was also the BCS championship game, had a crowd of 93,986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tournamentofroses.com/roseparade/paradefaqs.asp Tournament of Roses Parade FAQs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814001636/http://www.tournamentofroses.com/roseparade/paradefaqs.asp |date=2007-08-14 }}. The Rose Bowl Game is a contractual sellout. In 2006, attendance was 93,986.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011 contest between TCU and Wisconsin, the listed attendance is 94,118.  As of 2008, the Rose Bowl is the 11th [[List of American football stadiums by capacity|largest football stadium]], and is still the largest stadium that hosts post-season bowl games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rosebowlstadium.com/RoseBowl_history.htm Historic information on the Rose Bowl Stadium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907115147/http://www.rosebowlstadium.com/RoseBowl_history.htm |date=2009-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For concerts held there, the Rose Bowl holds almost 60,000 people. The stadium's 2014 remodeling removed the lower "lettered row" seats on each side behind the players' benches and provide access in and out of the stadium for the lower sections of the Rose Bowl, restoring its original design.

===Stadium renovations===
[[File:2008-1206-USC-UCLA-009-RB-redblue.JPG|thumb|right|UCLA-USC football game at the Rose Bowl; the 2008 edition marked a return to the tradition of both teams wearing home jerseys]]
The press box was updated before the [[1962 Rose Bowl]] with an elevator and two rows. The cost was $356,000. The Press Box was refurbished for UCLA's move in 1982 and the 1984 Summer Olympics.&lt;ref name="UCLA1989" /&gt; In 2011 and 2012, the press box was undergoing renovation as part of the larger renovation originally budgeted at $152 million in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Toby Zwikel, Noah Gold, Brian Robin, Brener Zwikel &amp; Associates, Inc – [https://web.archive.org/web/20101015204303/http://www.pasadenacal.com/pasadena-press-releases/248--pasadena-city-council-approves-152-million-renovation-of-iconic-rose-bowl-stadium.html Pasadena City Council approves $152 million renovation of iconic Rose Bowl] City of Pasadena, October 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Costs had increased to $170 million during construction.&lt;ref name="LATIMES170"&gt;Piasecki, Joe – [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/09/renovation-costs-at-rose-bowl-now-estimated-at-170-million.html Renovation Costs at Rose Bowl now estimated at $170 million]. ''Los Angeles Times'', September 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Work proceeded during the 2011 football season, and was expected to be completed before the UCLA Bruins' first home game in 2012.&lt;ref name="LATIMES170" /&gt; Some unforeseen problems had been encountered due to the stadium's age and some renovations done in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="LATIMES170" /&gt; Most of the planned renovations were completed in 2013. Because of the increased construction cost, items deferred for the future are additional new restrooms, the historic field hedge, new entry gate structures, and additional new concession stands. The stadium has started "The Brick Campaign" to help pay for some of the cost of the renovations.&lt;ref&gt;Rose Bowl America's Stadium, ''Los Angeles Times'' Advertising Supplement, August 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The Brick Campaign, completed in 2014, features a large logo of the [[Pasadena Tournament of Roses]] and the donor bricks arranged by universities in front of the south main entrance to the stadium. A large 30 feet tall by 77 feet wide [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] video display board was added to the north end of the stadium as a part of the renovation.

===Court of Champions===
The Court of Champions is at the stadium's south end. Rose Bowl game records along with the names of the coaches and the MVP players, are shown on the plaques attached to the exterior wall. The Hall of Fame statue is also at the Court of Champions. The 2014 renovation allows more plaques to be placed on the wall and floor for future games.

===Terry Donahue Pavilion===
The seven-story [[Terry Donahue]] Pavilion is named for the former UCLA football head coach, who is the most successful coach in UCLA and Pac-12 history. It houses the press boxes, broadcast booths, premium seating, boxes and suites. The radio and TV booths will be renamed "The [[Keith Jackson]] Broadcast Center" in December 2015. Jackson, the former [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]] sportscaster, coined the phrase "The [[Granddaddy of Them All]]" for the [[Rose Bowl game]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rosebowlstadium.com/legacy/keith-jackson-broadcast-center Keith Jackson Broadcast Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151113133651/http://www.rosebowlstadium.com/legacy/keith-jackson-broadcast-center |date=2015-11-13 }}, Rosebowlstadium.com, November 5, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Football at the Rose Bowl==

===Rose Bowl Game===
{{Main|Rose Bowl Game}}
The Rose Bowl stadium is best known in the U.S. for its hosting of the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]], a [[postseason]] [[college football]] game. The game is played after the [[Tournament of Roses Parade]] on New Year's Day, or, if January 1 is a Sunday, on the following Monday January 2. The stadium's name has given rise to the term "[[bowl game]]" for postseason football games, regardless of whether they are played in a bowl-shaped or "Bowl"-named stadium. The Rose Bowl Game is commonly referred to as "The Granddaddy of Them All" because of its stature as the oldest of all the bowl games. Since its opening, the Rose Bowl stadium has hosted the bowl game every year except the [[1942 Rose Bowl]], when the game was moved to [[Durham, North Carolina]], at the campus of [[Duke University]]. Duke, which played in the game on January 1, volunteered to host the contest because of security concerns on the West Coast in the weeks following the attack on [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref name="rose"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sports-venue.info/NCAAF/Bowls/T_Rose_Bowl_Timeline.html|title=Rose Bowl Timeline|publisher=Pasadena Tournament of Roses|accessdate=2007-11-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522115924/http://www.sports-venue.info/NCAAF/Bowls/T_Rose_Bowl_Timeline.html|archivedate=2008-05-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, Paul "Scene of Rose Bowl Shifted to Durham, N.C."

Starting with the [[1998 NCAA Division I-A football season|1998]] season, the Rose Bowl became part of the [[Bowl Championship Series]] (BCS). The [[2002 Rose Bowl|2002]] and [[2006 Rose Bowl|2006]] games also were the BCS Championship games, matching the #1 and #2 BCS teams in the nation. The [[2010 BCS National Championship Game]] was played six days after the [[2010 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]] game as a completely separate event from the Tournament of Roses, though it managed the event. The stadium hosted the [[2014 BCS National Championship Game]], the final game before the BCS was replaced by the current [[College Football Playoff]], when it celebrated its 100th anniversary of the Rose Bowl game.&lt;ref&gt;Beth Harris, [http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9IUVIE00.htm Vizio to be new Rose Bowl sponsor], ''AP'' via  ''BusinessWeek'', October 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the Rose Bowl is eligible to bid on hosting the [[College Football Playoff]] [[College Football Playoff National Championship|Championship Game]] in years it is not hosting a semifinal, it has no plans to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fornelli|first1=Tom|title=Rose Bowl will not bid for 2020 College Football Playoff title game|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/eye-on-college-football/25160363/rose-bowl-will-not-bid-for-2020-title-game|website=CBS Sports|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===College Football Playoff semifinals===

{{Main|College Football Championship Game}}

The Rose Bowl Game is one of the six primary bowls of the [[College Football Playoff]] (CFP), which replaced the BCS effective with the [[2014 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2014]] season. Every three years, the Rose Bowl will match two of the top four teams selected by the system's [[College Football Playoff#Selection Committee|selection committee]] to compete for a spot at the [[College Football Playoff National Championship|national championship]] game. The first CFP semifinal game at the Rose Bowl was the [[2015 Rose Bowl]], whose winner advanced to the [[2015 College Football Playoff National Championship|championship game]] on January 12 at [[AT&amp;T Stadium]] in [[Texas]].

===UCLA Bruins football home stadium===
{{Main|UCLA Bruins football}}
[[File:UCLA Rose Bowl record.jpg|thumb|Previous edition of Rose Bowl records at Hall of Champions]]
The Rose Bowl stadium has been the home football field for [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA]] since [[1982 NCAA Division I-A football season|1982]].&lt;ref name="UCLAROSEBOWL" /&gt; The UCLA Bruins had played their home games at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] since [[1928 college football season|1928]]. There was an attempt to build a 44,000 seat stadium on campus, at the site where [[Drake Stadium (UCLA)|Drake Stadium]] eventually was built. However, the proposal was blocked by influential area residents, as well as other politicians.&lt;ref name="STADIUMSCUTTLED"&gt;Crowe, Jerry – [http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-crowe16-2009nov16,0,1062188.column "There goes the neighborhood: How UCLA stadium bid was scuttled."] ''Los Angeles Times'', November 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reich, Ken "Stadium for UCLA Given Support – Architect's Study Cites Project as 'Desirable' STADIUM SUPPORT". ''Los Angeles Times'', November 18, 1965. ''UCLA officials--still reportedly trying to decide whether to recommend the building of a 44,000-seat football stadium on campus--have released details of an architectural feasibility study.''&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the [[1982 NFL season]], with the [[Oakland Raiders]] scheduled to move in, UCLA decided to relocate its home games to the Rose Bowl Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uclahistoryproject.ucla.edu/Fun/ThisMonth_AugRosebowl.asp UCLA History Project - This Month in History Aug. 18, 1982 … A gridiron home] – includes a photograph of the 1983 Rose Bowl game from an overhead shot&lt;/ref&gt; The Bruins went on to play two straight Rose Bowl games in their new home stadium, the [[1983 Rose Bowl]] and the [[1984 Rose Bowl]]. UCLA has participated in five Rose Bowl games since moving to the stadium. The stadium is the host of the [[UCLA–USC rivalry]] football game on even numbered years, alternating with the Coliseum. In the first rivalry game at the stadium between UCLA and USC in 1982, USC fans sat on the west side of the stadium and UCLA fans sat on the east side of the stadium, mirroring an arrangement that existed when the teams shared the Coliseum. Both teams also wore their home uniforms. In 1984, USC fans were moved to the end zone seats, which ended the tradition of shared stadium. Because of the shared arrangement, and the participation of USC in a number of Rose Bowl games, both schools have winning records in each other's home stadium. The Bruins travel 26 miles from campus to Pasadena to play home games, but only 14 miles to their biggest road game at USC every other year.&lt;ref name="STADIUMSCUTTLED" /&gt;

===Caltech Beavers football home stadium===
[[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], a university located in Pasadena, played most home games in the Rose Bowl from the time of its construction until the school dropped football in [[1993 in sports|1993]]. Caltech jovially claimed to play before the greatest number of empty seats in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Discovery of Anti-Matter: The autobiography of [[Carl David Anderson]], The Youngest Man To Win the [[Nobel Prize]]''. Published 1999 by World Scientific ({{ISBN|981-02-3680-8}})&lt;/ref&gt;

===Junior Rose Bowl===
The stadium hosted the '''Junior Rose Bowl''' from 1946 to 1971 and 1976 to 1977. Between 1946 and 1966 and 1976 and 1977, the game pitted the [[California Community College Athletic Association|California Junior College]] football champions against the [[National Junior College Athletic Association|NJCAA]] football champions for the national championship. It was organized by the Pasadena Junior Chamber of Commerce. The Junior Rose Bowl became the [[Pasadena Bowl]] from 1967 to 1971; it was billed as the Junior Rose Bowl the first two years, but instead two teams from the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] College Division competed (then later the University Division, usually featuring teams that were not invited to other major bowls).

===1983 Army-Navy game===
The Rose Bowl stadium is the only site west of the Mississippi River to host an [[Army–Navy Game]] ([[1983 in sports|1983]]). The city of Pasadena paid for the traveling expenses of the all students and supporters of both the [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]] and [[United States Military Academy|U.S. Military Academy]].&lt;ref name="SIVAULT1983"&gt;Clark, N. Brooks – [http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1135870/index.htm This Week 12.05.83.] Sports Illustrated, December 5, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; The attendance was 81,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.athlonsports.com/college-football/4323/no-1-army-vs-navy No. 1 Army vs. Navy] Athlon Sports&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usna.edu/LibExhibits/Archives/Armynavy/An1983.htm Army Navy Football 1983]. Score: Navy 42 – Army 13 | Game played at the Rose Bowl. United States Naval Academy Exhibits&lt;/ref&gt; The game was brought to the Rose Bowl as there are a large number of military installations and servicemen and women, along with many retired military personnel, on the West Coast.&lt;ref name="SIVAULT1983" /&gt;

===Super Bowls===
{{Main|Super Bowl}}
The stadium has hosted the [[Super Bowl]] five times. The first was [[Super Bowl XI]] in January 1977, when the [[1976 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] beat the [[1976 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] 32&amp;ndash;14. The game was also played there in 1980 ([[Super Bowl XIV|XIV]]), 1983 ([[Super Bowl XVII|XVII]]), 1987 ([[Super Bowl XXI|XXI]]) and 1993 ([[Super Bowl XXVII|XXVII]]). The Rose Bowl is one of two venues (with [[Stanford Stadium]]) to host a Super Bowl though having never served as the full-time home stadium for an NFL or AFL team (Stanford Stadium hosted one [[1989 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] game after the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]]).

Because the NFL has a policy limiting the hosting of a Super Bowl to metropolitan areas with NFL teams, the Super Bowl has not been played at the Rose Bowl since the [[Los Angeles Rams|Rams]] and [[Oakland Raiders|Raiders]] departed the Los Angeles area in {{nfly|1995}}. The most recent Super Bowl held in southern California was [[Super Bowl XXXVII|XXXVII]] in [[San Diego]] in January [[2002–03 NFL playoffs|2003]]. The next L.A.-based Super Bowl ([[Super Bowl LVI|LVI]]) is scheduled for February 2022 at the Rams' and [[Los Angeles Chargers|Chargers]]' [[Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park|new stadium]] in [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] (the Rams returned to Los Angeles in [[2016 Los Angeles Rams season|2016]], the Chargers the [[2017 Los Angeles Chargers season|following year]]).

==Soccer at the Rose Bowl==
Though best known as an American football stadium, the Rose Bowl is also one of the most decorated [[Association football|soccer (association football)]] venues in the world. The stadium hosted the prestigious [[1994 FIFA World Cup Final]] (an event watched by over 700 million people worldwide), the [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup Final]], and the [[Football at the 1984 Summer Olympics#Gold Medal match|1984 Olympic Gold Medal Match]], making it the only venue in the world to host all three of international soccer's major championship matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rose Bowl, Los Angeles|url=https://www.fifa.com/fifa-tournaments/classic-stadiums/stadium=5003452/index.html|website=FIFA.com|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States men's national soccer team]] has played 17 games in the Rose Bowl, the [[United States national soccer team results#Results by Home Stadium|fourth most of any venue]]. It has also hosted [[MLS Cup 1998]] and the [[2002 CONCACAF Gold Cup Final|2002]] and [[2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup Final]]s.  [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] has played a number of friendlies in the stadium against nations other than the United States.

In the past, it was also the home ground of two [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|North American Soccer League]] clubs, the [[Los Angeles Wolves]] in 1968 and the [[Los Angeles Aztecs]] in 1978 and 1979. From 1996 through 2002, the stadium was the home ground of [[Major League Soccer]] club [[LA Galaxy|Los Angeles Galaxy]], who still host occasional matches there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Famed Rose Bowl to host FC Barcelona v LA Galaxy|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/detail/article/famed-rose-bowl-to-host-fc-barcelona-v-la-galaxy|website=FCBARCELONA.COM|publisher=FC Barcelona|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major global soccer tournaments ===
The Rose Bowl is one of two stadiums to have hosted the [[FIFA World Cup]] finals for both men and women. The Rose Bowl hosted the men's final in [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]] and the women's final in [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup|1999]]. (The only other stadium with this honor is the [[Råsunda Stadium]] near [[Stockholm]], Sweden, which hosted the men's final in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] and the women's final in [[1995 FIFA Women's World Cup|1995]].) Both Rose Bowl finals were scoreless after [[extra time]] and decided on [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootouts]]; [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] defeating [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup Final]], and the [[United States women's national soccer team|United States]] defeating [[China women's national football team|China]] in the [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup Final|1999 women's final]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=84/results/matches/match=3104/report.html|title=1994 FIFA World Cup Final |date=1994-07-17|work=FIFA.com|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=103/edition=4644/matches/match=22183/report.html|title=1999 FIFA Womens World Cup Final |date=1999-07-10|work=FIFA.com|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rose Bowl also hosted group stage matches of the [[Copa América Centenario]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ca2016.com/matches&lt;/ref&gt;  It also hosted several matches including the final of the 1984 Olympics men's soccer tournament. On July 27, 2016, the Rose Bowl hosted a [[2016 International Champions Cup]] match between [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. Chelsea won the match 1-0. The Rose Bowl also hosted a [[2018 International Champions Cup]] match between [[F.C. Barcelona]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur]] where Barcelona won 5-3 in penalty kicks after a 2-2 draw. It has also regularly featured [[CONCACAF Gold Cup]] matches including two finals.

The Rose Bowl is a candidate to host matches in the [[2026 FIFA World Cup]], and will be a venue in the [[2028 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;http://la24-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/pdf/LA2024-canditature-part2_english.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other events and usage==

===Pasadena events===
[[File:Fireworks over the Rose Bowl 20140704.jpg|thumb|4th of July Fireworks over the Rose Bowl]]
The Rose Bowl has hosted the Pasadena "Americafest" [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] celebration annually since 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Suter|first1=Leanne|title=Fireworks, Food, Fun found at Rose Bowl's Americafest|url=http://abc7.com/news/fireworks-food-fun-found-at-rose-bowls-americafest/828824/|website=ABC 7 Eyewitness News|publisher=KABC-TV|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The annual fireworks show is considered one of the top fireworks shows in the nation. Another local event is the Rose Bowl Flea Market held the second Sunday of each month, on the stadium parking lots. Hosted by promoter R.G. Canning, it claims to be the largest [[Flea market]] on the West Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rose Bowl General Information|url=http://www.rgcshows.com/RoseBowl.aspx|publisher=R.G. Canning Attractions|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium host the annual "Turkey Tussle" homecoming football game between [[John Muir High School]] and [[Pasadena High School (California)|Pasadena High School]], in early November. The Rose Bowl hosted its annual graduation ceremonies for Blair High School, John Muir High School and Pasadena High School until 1984, before staging it at the individual schools until 1998. Currently all three high schools along with John Marshall Fundamental School held their graduation ceremonies at the [[Pasadena Civic Auditorium]] in early June.

===Other events===
The stadium was used for [[midget car racing]] in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Speedways|journal=URA Third Annual Midget Auto Racing Year Book|date=1946|page=49|publisher=Pacific Coast Speedway News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium held its first  country music festival in June 1981, named A Day in the Country
The event was produced by Richard Flanzer of AtlanticPacific Music.

The stadium hosted the 2007 [[Drum Corps International]] World Championships August 7 through August 11, 2007. The Rose Bowl was the final stadium to host the championship before DCI moved their corporate offices to [[Indianapolis]] with the championships being held at [[Lucas Oil Stadium]] until at least 2018. This was the first time the DCI championships had ever been held west of [[Denver]], [[Colorado]] in the 45-year history of DCI.

It hosted auditions for the top American television show, ''[[American Idol]]'', on August 8, 2006. The stadium has also been used as part of the music video shoot for the song "[[The Last Song (The All-American Rejects song)|The Last Song]]", the second single released by the American rock band [[The All-American Rejects]], which features the band performing the song in the middle of the stadium to an empty crowd.

The stadium's Court of Champions was the site of a "Roadblock" from [[The Amazing Race 17|season 17]] of the CBS reality TV show ''[[The Amazing Race]]'' where teams had to help decorate three sections of the [[Tournament of Roses Parade themes|theme float]] for the 2011 New Year's Day [[Tournament of Roses Parade|Rose Parade]].

In November 1997, the [[International Churches of Christ]] (Los Angeles) gathered at the Rose Bowl for their Worship Service, with an attendance of 17,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kipmckean.com/#_Toc185599053|title=Kipmckean.com – Get Your Answers Here!|work=Kip McKean|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rose Bowl and adjacent golf course are managed by the Rose Bowl Operating Company, a non-profit organization whose board is selected by council members of the City of Pasadena. UCLA and the Pasadena Tournament of Roses also have one member on the company board. The Rose Bowl stadium itself runs on a yearly operational loss.&lt;ref name="e1"&gt;Greg Johnson, [http://www.latimes.com/sports/college/usc/la-sp-bowlfixes1jan01,1,322325,full.story?coll=la-headlines-sports-coll-usc $300-million fixer-upper], ''Los Angeles Times'', January 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; While it generates funds with the annual lease with UCLA ($1.5 million), the [[Tournament of Roses]] ($900,000), and a regularly hosted flea market ($900,000), it makes up the loss by relying on funds generated by the adjacent city-owned [[Brookside Golf Course|golf course]] ($2 million).&lt;ref name="e1" /&gt; While the stadium is able to keep operating in this financial set-up, it is unable to finance many of the capital improvements it needs to be considered a modern facility, including new seats, wider aisles, additional exits, a wider concourse, a renovated press box, a state-of-the-art video [[scoreboard]], new field lighting, additional suites and a club. The estimated cost for such improvements ranges from $250&amp;nbsp;million and $300&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="e1" /&gt;

The stadium currently has long-term leases with its two major tenants, the [[Pasadena Tournament of Roses]] (2019) and UCLA (2023). In 2006, the Rose Bowl and the City of Pasadena launched a $16.3&amp;nbsp;million capital improvement program that will benefit both UCLA and the Tournament of Roses. New locker rooms for both UCLA and visiting teams, as well as a new media interview area were constructed.&lt;ref name="UCLAROSEBOWL" /&gt;

In April 2009, The Rose Bowl Operating Company unveiled a Rose Bowl Strategic Plan, which addressed the objectives to improve public safety; enhance fan experience; maintain national historic landmark status; develop revenue sources to fund long-term improvements; and enhance facility operations. On October 11, 2010, the Pasadena City Council approved a $152 million financing plan for the major renovation of the stadium. Groundbreaking ceremonies for the first of three phases of the project was held on January 25, 2011. The newly constructed video board was used for the June 25, [[2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup Final]].

===NFL===
{{Main|History of the National Football League in Los Angeles}}
Since losing both its local teams in the Los Angeles market in 1995, the [[National Football League]] had been looking to either start or relocate a franchise to the Los Angeles area. One of the strong candidates was a renovated Rose Bowl. However, after many years of varying offers, no deal could be struck between the NFL owners, the stadium's owner, and the City of Pasadena, following a vote of disapproval by its residents in November 2006.&lt;ref name="e1" /&gt;

On November 19, 2012, Pasadena officials approved a proposal which could allow an NFL team to temporarily play in the Rose Bowl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pasadenasun.com/the626now/pasadenasu-20121120,0,1610674.story |title=Pasadena OKs plan that may bring NFL team to the Rose Bowl  |publisher=[[Pasadena Sun]] |date=2012-11-20 |accessdate=2011-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.pasadena.ca.us/Rose_Bowl_EIR/ |title=Temporary Use of the Rose Bowl Stadium by the National Football League  |publisher=City of Pasadena |date=2012-11-09 |accessdate=2011-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rose Bowl, however, has not acted as a home field for an NFL team. When the [[Los Angeles Rams]] moved from [[St. Louis]] prior to the 2016 NFL season, the Rose Bowl was considered as a temporary home before the Rams ultimately settled on playing in USC's [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], the Rams' home from 1946 to 1979.

It is home to multi-use stadium and sports complex.

==History==
The land on the eastern side of Reid Avenue, was part of the [[Colombo Racecourse]] and the Colombo Turf Club. During [[World War II]] it was the site of the [[Colombo Racecourse Airstrip|RAF airstrip]]. When horse racing declined after gambling was outlawed in the 1950s Colombo Racecourse and its land fell into disuse and was taken over by the government. The large land extent was segmented and distributed to government entities. Royal College Colombo, received a four-acre plot which became the ''Royal College Rugby Grounds''.

In 2000, work began at the rugby grounds for a state of the art sports complex up to international standards to host multiple sports and a modern gymnasium. The indoor stadium houses a 450 seating capacity along with two squash courts with a 150-seat capacity and a badminton courts with 250 seats. In 2013 an additional seating tier, the "Royal -Brandix Sky Pavilion", was constructed increasing the outdoor arena capacity to 12,500 including the terraces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ft.lk/article/158160/Royal-Brandix-Sky-Pavilion-opens-at-RCSC|title = Royal-Brandix Sky Pavilion opens at RCSC|website = www.ft.lk|access-date = 2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complex also boasts a 120 unit car park with basement parking.

The [[Fiji Rugby Football Union]] is the governing body of [[rugby union]] in Rotuma.

==History==
Rugby was introduced to Rotuma at the turn of the 20th century, by sailors, and New Zealand missionaries.

In 1910, a combined America Universities rugby team comprising mostly players from California, [[Stanford University|Stanford]], and the [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]] went on a tour of [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], as well as Fiji and Rotuma. The underdog American side upset both Rotorua RFC and Auckland RU, which came as a great surprise to the international rugby community.

[[Rugby Sevens]] has been a sport in the [[South Pacific Games]] since the late 1990s.

A '''skins game''' is a type of scoring for various sports. It has its origins in [[golf]] but has been adapted for [[disc golf]], [[curling]] and [[bowling]].

==Golf==
In [[golf]], a skins event has players compete for prize money on each individual hole. 

===Skins Game, PGA Tour===
{{main|Skins Game (PGA Tour)}}
There was an annual skins game for male professional golfers which took place in November or December each year after the end of the official [[PGA Tour]] season (1983–2008). It was recognized by the PGA Tour but did not count towards the official money list.

===Telus Skins Game===
{{Main|Telus Skins Game}}
There is an annual skins game in Canada for male professional golfers which takes place in June or July each year. It is recognized by the PGA Tour but does not count towards the official money list.  It is currently sponsored by [[Telus]] and is officially known as the Telus World Skins Game, hosted at a different golf course each year within Canada. 

Over the past two years the [[Telus Skins Game]] has also incorporated a theme, which has been a "world" theme. The "world" theme incorporates 5 golfers located from different regions across the globe (5 golfers from different countries).

===Notes===
The popularity of the tournament led to the term ''skins game'' being used to refer to progressive jackpot events where if a prize is not won, it is carried over to the next round for a combined jackpot.

At least in the early versions of [[Jack Nicklaus 4|the Jack Nicklaus Golf series of computer games]], players were given a choice of [[stroke play]] or Skins rules (and in the initial set-up of a game, could set any value for any hole).

==Curling==
A skins game format has also been adapted to the game of [[curling]]. In this format, teams play for ends, not scoring within an end, though points (or in some competitions, prize money as in golf's version) may be assigned to each end. To win an end, the team that has "the hammer" — the one which throws the last stone in the end, an inherent advantage — must score at least two points (under normal scoring rules) to win the end. The other team may win the end by stealing one point. If the team with the hammer gets only one point or the end is blanked, then the game points or prize money associated with that end carry over to the next, as with the golf skins game. If there are unclaimed skins after the final end, they are usually played off with a "draw to the button" — each team throws a single stone into an empty house (target), with the stone coming closest to the button (center) winning.

Scoring in curling skins games is done in one of two methods: in one method, an "S" is denoted if a team wins a skin, and a "C" is denoted for the team with the hammer if there is a carryover.  In any event, a "0" is denoted for the other team, and an asterisk is placed beside the team with the hammer.  In the other method, an "X" is denoted if a team wins a skin, and a "0" is denoted if the skin is carried over (under the team with the hammer), with the other team's entry for the end being blank.  This method, however, does not keep track of which team will have the hammer in an end (which instead must be determined based on the score markings).

The [[Continental Cup of Curling]] is the best-known bonspiel to utilize the skins format. In this bonspiel, the skins portion is played for a total of 30 points, with point values assigned to each end as follows: One half point each for the first six ends, one point each for the seventh and eighth ends. There are 6 skins games with 5 skins available each game. These points are combined with those earned in earlier matches of mixed doubles, singles skills and traditional team games to determine the winner of the Cup. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.curling.ca/2015continentalcup-en/scoring/ Continental Cup of Curling official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[TSN Skins Game]] was an annual tournament which featured skins games. The Network was restarted in 2007.

The Skins Game was thought to have been invented by [[Doug Maxwell]], a noted innovator in the sport. Early skins games often consisted of ten ends, the standard length of a modern competitive curling game. Today, largely on account of the influence of television, eight end games (the usual length of a recreational or semi-competitive curling game) has become the standard for skins competition.

==History==

Numerous Nigerian cities hosted women's football teams by 1960. Multiple efforts were made in the 1960s to start women's football clubs in South Africa, but they proved fleeting. The 1970s saw some growth, with new women's leagues in Nigeria and an expansion of women's football into Western African countries, including Senegal. One local club in [[Dakar]] played a match against an Italian club in 1974; five years later, an early match between African nations was played by the Dakar side and a team from Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Alegi|title=African Soccerscapes: How a Continent Changed the World's Game|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NrW50yHkr0EC|accessdate=3 April 2016|date=2 March 2010|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=978-0-89680-278-0|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a lack of support from Nigerian officials, 28 clubs played women's football in the country by 1989, and [[Nigeria women's national football team|Nigeria's national team]] competed in the [[1991 FIFA Women's World Cup|1991 Women's World Cup]]. More women began playing football in the 1990s, in countries like Nigeria and South Africa. In 1998, CAF introduced an official [[Africa Women Cup of Nations|African Women's Championship]], following two unofficial versions of the tournament earlier in the 1990s; host country Nigeria won, beginning a stretch of five consecutive titles in the event. The next year, the squad reached the quarterfinals of the [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup|1999 Women's World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;Alegi, pp. 121–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Worcester Memorial Auditorium''' (also known simply as '''Worcester Auditorium''') is a multi-purpose [[arena]] located at Lincoln Square in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], [[Massachusetts]]. Built in 1933, as a [[World War I]] [[War memorial]] in the form of a multi-purpose hall,&lt;ref name=Aud /&gt; the Auditorium has a {{convert|116|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}},&lt;ref name=Mag /&gt; [[proscenium]]. It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980 as part of the [[Institutional District]].&lt;ref name=NRHP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mhc-macris.net/Details.aspx?MhcId=WOR.M|title=NRHP nomination for Institutional District|publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 Lincoln Square was listed as one of the "Most Endangered Historic Resources" in the state by [[Preservation Massachusetts]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegram.com/article/20090922/NEWS/909220365/1101It ''Lincoln Square is "Endangered Historic Resource"''] [[Worcester Telegram &amp; Gazette]] September 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; because of the three historical buildings in the square that are all empty or underutilized. The Auditorium was most recently used to house Massachusetts State Trial Court records and a small after-school program.&lt;ref name=Aud /&gt;

==History==
The Worcester Auditorium was designed as a [[World War I]] [[War memorial]] in the form of a multi-purpose hall.&lt;ref name=Aud /&gt; The building is built in the [[Classical Revival]] style, but with [[Art Deco]] [[bas-relief]] ornamentation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preservationworcester.org/pages/tourmain.html#Anchor-Th-20413 Main Street Virtual Tour], [[Preservation Worcester]]. Accessed September 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The interior [[murals]] in the Auditorium were created by the artist [[Leon Kroll]],&lt;ref name=Aud /&gt; and took three years to complete between 1938 and 1941.&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0A1EFD3459167B93CAA8178ED85F458485F9 Murals Ready At Worcester; Leon Kroll Completes War Memorial and Dedication Is Set for May 28th], [[New York Times]]. May 18, 1941. Accessed September 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; When finished the main mural was the largest of its kind in the United States.&lt;ref name= Telegram&gt;What's to become of the Aud? [[Worcester Telegram &amp; Gazette]]. September 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Auditorium opened, it has been home to the [[Bay State Bombardiers]] of the [[Continental Basketball Association]] and the [[Holy Cross Crusaders]] before the [[Hart Center]] opened in 1975. It has also hosted [[Bob Dylan]]'s [[Rolling Thunder Revue]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bjorner.com/DSN02910%201975%20Rolling%20Thunder%20Revue.htm#DSN03080 1975 Rolling Thunder Review] Accessed September 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and has served as a shelter after the [[Worcester tornado]] hit.&lt;ref name=Telegram /&gt; There is another small performance space known as the "Little Theater" attached to the Auditorium, which can seat 675 people, but it is currently empty as well.&lt;ref name=Mag /&gt;

In 2013, a scene for the film [[American Hustle (2013 film)|American Hustle]] was filmed in the Worcester Auditorium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masslive.com/news/worcester/index.ssf/2013/12/american_hustle_makes_a_hollyw.html 'American Hustle' makes a Hollywood star of Worcester] Accessed January 16, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
Many plans have been weighed for the future of the Auditorium. These included a canceled plan for [[Higgins Armory]] to move to the Auditorium from its current location, the creation of a [[Faneuil Hall]] style marketplace, and even the creation of a research center because of the proximity of [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]]'s nearby Gateway Park.&lt;ref name=Aud /&gt; One of the largest problems with the Auditorium is that it has a flat, as opposed to a sloped audience floor, which makes it not well suited to be a modern theater.&lt;ref name=Aud /&gt; To convert the Auditorium to office space would cost $6.2 million, while converting it to a "museum, memorial or theater", would cost more than $12 million, much of which could be covered by tax credits.&lt;ref name=Aud/&gt; While some call for the demolition of the Auditorium, even a partial one that would spare the memorial wall and murals, they are a tiny minority.&lt;ref name=Aud/&gt; In 2016, renewed efforts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://WorcAUD.com/|title=Worcester Memorial Auditorium|website=worcaud.com|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; were launched to rekindle interest and appreciation for the building and its 106-rank Kimball Pipe Organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worcaud.com/organ/#Kimball|title=Pipe Organ – Worcester Memorial Auditorium|website=www.worcaud.com|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''men's team competition''' was an inaugural event at the '''[[Artistic Gymnastics World Championships]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://live.fig-gymnastics.com/news.php?idevent=13465 |title=47th FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Championships MONTREAL (CAN) |website=live.fig-gymnastics.com |publisher=Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique |accessdate=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fig-gymnastics.com/site/events/detail.php?id=13335 |title=48th FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Championships DOHA (QAT) |website=www.fig-gymnastics.com |publisher=Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique |accessdate=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not held in 1992, 1993, 1996, 2002, 2005, 2009, 2013, and 2017. In 1994, a separate team championships were held, apart from the individual events's championships. This was the only year such a separation was made.

Three medals are awarded: [[gold medal|gold for first place]], [[silver medal|silver for second place]], and [[bronze medal|bronze for third place]]. [[Tie (draw)|Tie breakers]] have not been used in every year. In the event of a tie between two gymnasts, both names are listed, and the following position (second for a tie for first, third for a tie for second) is left empty because a medal was not awarded for that position. If three gymnastics tied for a position, the following two positions are left empty.
