The '''1935 Yazidi revolt''' took place in Iraq in October 1935.&lt;ref name=dtic/&gt; The Iraqi government, under [[Yasin al-Hashimi]], crushed a revolt by the [[Yazidi]] [[people]] of [[Jabal Sinjar]] against the imposition of conscription.&lt;ref name=dtic&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA405080 dtic.mil]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jstor&gt;Fuccaro, Nelinda.

'''3GNY''' (Third Generation New York) is a non-profit organization composed of the Jewish grandchildren of [[Holocaust]] [[List of Holocaust survivors|survivors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.3g-ny.org/about-3gny/ |title=About Us |author= |date= |work= |publisher=3GNY}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of the group "is to educate people about the Holocaust by telling the stories of their families, to provide a forum where the grandchildren of survivors can connect, and to fight intolerance and ethnic violence wherever it exists."&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |title=Davis Shares His Family’s Holocaust History |author= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/28/sports/baseball/28mets.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=28 September 2010 |page=B18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3G refers to "Third Generation," a term used to denote grandchildren of Holocaust survivors.&lt;ref name="jta"&gt;{{cite news |title=Survivors’ grandchildren feeling an obligation to share Holocaust memories |author= |url=http://www.jta.org/news/article/2012/04/15/3092841/third-generation-shares-shoah-memories |agency=JTA |date=15 April 2012 |access-date=2012-06-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422070333/http://www.jta.org/news/article/2012/04/15/3092841/third-generation-shares-shoah-memories |archive-date=2012-04-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
3GNY was founded in 2006&lt;ref name="background"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3g-ny.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/3GNY_Bio.pdf|title=Background|author=|date=|work=|publisher=3GNY|accessdate=7 June 2012}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; by Daniel Brooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.3g-ny.org/about-3gny/about-the-3gny-board/ |title=About the 3GNY Board |author= |date= |work= |publisher=3GNY |accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization began with six people&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; and has since expanded to more than 1,500 members.&lt;ref name="jta"/&gt;

==Activities==
3GNY meets approximately once a month,&lt;ref name="jta"/&gt; for programming that includes "[[Shabbat]] dinners, discussion groups, genealogy and writing workshops, museum tours and happy hours." The organization continues to hear directly from the survivors of the Holocaust as well as survivors from other genocides, such as [[Rwandan Genocide|Rwanda]] and [[War in Darfur|Darfur]].&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="background"/&gt;

In 2010, 3GNY launched an educational initiative entitled "WEDU" (We Educate), developed in conjunction with [[Facing History and Ourselves]] and the American Society for [[Yad Vashem]]. The objective of the program is to empower the "grandchildren of survivors to learn and share their family histories and lessons of the Holocaust with students in school classrooms." Since the initiative's launch, 3GNY representatives have presented in over fifteen schools.&lt;ref name="background"/&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' profiled 3GNY in 2010 when [[Ike Davis]], the [[first baseman]] for the [[New York Mets]], met with the group. The mother of Davis is Jewish and many of her relatives died in the Holocaust. Davis' great aunt though, survived the Holocaust. Regarding the event with 3GNY, Davis said, "I thought it was really cool meeting with them. These are people around my age who are trying to keep alive the memory of their family members and loved ones, maybe even people they never got to meet, so people never forget what happened."&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

'''Aaron Abraham ben Baruch Simeon ha-Levi''' was a [[Kabbalah|kabbalist]], born in the first quarter of the sixteenth century. He published a small kabbalistic work, ''Iggeret ha-Ṭe'amim'' (''Letter on the Accents''), about the middle of the century, in which each accent and its specific name are explained as containing references to both the [[Sephirot|Ten Sefirot]] and the [[Israelite|people of Israel]]. Upon this work [[Shabbethai Sheftel ben Akiba Hurwitz]], kabbalist and physician at [[Prague]], wrote in 1612 a voluminous commentary, ''Shefa' Ṭal'', asserting in the introduction (p.&amp;nbsp;13) that '''R. Aaron''' was one of the greatest masters of the Kabbalah, and that his work contained the most profound secrets which he (Hurwitz) wished to disclose. But in reality it contains only kabbalistic trifles which attempt to show that the solution of the mystery of the Ten Sefirot is indicated in the names of the accents (''ṭe'amim'').

[[File:William Strang - Adoration (1913).jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Adoration'', 1913, by [[William Strang]]]]
'''Adoration''' ([[Latin]]) is respect, reverence, strong admiration or devotion in a certain person, place, or thing. The term comes from the Latin ''adōrātiō'', meaning "to give [[Homage (arts)|homage]] or [[worship]] to someone or something".

==Ancient Rome==
In classical Rome, adoration was primarily an act of homage or worship, which, among the Romans, was performed by raising the hand to the mouth, kissing it and then waving it in the direction of the adored object. The devotee had his head covered, and after the act turned himself round from left to right. Sometimes he kissed the feet or knees of the images of the gods themselves, and Saturn and Hercules were adored with the head bare. By a natural transition the homage, at first paid to divine beings alone, came to be paid to monarchs. Thus the Greek and Roman emperors were adored by bowing or kneeling, laying hold of the imperial robe, and presently withdrawing the hand and pressing it to the lips, or by putting the royal robe itself to the lips.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Adoration |volume=1|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Middle East==
In Eastern countries, adoration has been performed in an attitude still more lowly. The [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] method, introduced by [[Cyrus the Great]], was to kiss the knee and fall on the face at the prince's feet, striking the earth with the forehead and kissing the ground. This striking of the earth with the forehead, usually a fixed number of times, was a form of adoration sometimes paid to Eastern potentates.

The Jews kissed in homage, as did other groups mentioned in the Old Testament. Thus in 1&amp;nbsp;Kings 19:18, God is made to say, "Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him." And in Psalms 2:12, "Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way". (See also Hosea 13:2.)&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Western Europe==
In Western Europe, the ceremony of [[Kissing Hands|kissing the sovereign's hand]], and some other acts which are performed while kneeling, may be described as forms of adoration.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Catholic Church==
The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that "Adoration is the acknowledgement of God as God, creator and savior, the Lord and master of everything that exists, as infinite and merciful love."&lt;ref&gt;CCC §2096&lt;/ref&gt; "Adoration is homage of the spirit to the King of glory, respectful silence in the presence of the ever greater God."&lt;ref&gt;CCC §2628&lt;/ref&gt; Adoration is prompted by the Holy Spirit.
 
In the strict sense, adoration is an act of religion offered to God in acknowledgment of His supreme perfection and dominion, and of the creature's dependence upon Him. "The rational creature, looking up to God, whom reason and revelation show to be infinitely perfect, cannot in right and justice maintain an attitude of indifference. That perfection which is infinite in itself and the source and fulfilment of all the good that we possess or shall possess, we must worship, acknowledging its immensity, and submitting to its supremacy."&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01151a.htm Sullivan, William L. "Adoration". The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 20 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In Luke 4:7-8, Jesus tells the tempter, "Scripture has it, 'You shall do homage to the Lord your God, Him alone shall you adore.'" The worship called forth by God, and given exclusively to Him as God, is designated by the Greek name ''latreia'' (Latinized, ''latria''), which is usually translated "Adoration". Adoration differs from other acts of worship, such as supplication, confession of sin, etc., inasmuch as it formally consists in self-abasement before the Infinite, and in devout recognition of His transcendent excellence. The primary and fundamental element in adoration is an interior act of mind and will; the mind perceiving that God's perfection is infinite, the will bidding one to extol and worship this perfection.&lt;ref name=Sullivan/&gt;

Adoration is a willing submission of self to God expressed interiorly as well as exteriorly by one's actions. It is an interior act of mind and will where the mind humbly admits that God's perfection is infinite, and the will moves one us to worship this perfection. An acknowledge of God's right as God to be Lord of one's life and in control of it involves a voluntarily offer of submission. [[Thomas Aquinas]] says: "Adoration is primarily an interior reverence for God expressing itself secondarily in bodily signs of humility: bending our knee (to express our weakness compared to God) and prostrating ourselves (to show that of ourselves we are nothing)."&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas, ''Summa'', 84.2&lt;/ref&gt;  Genuflecting is an outward gesture of an inward attitude of adoration towards God, as is the praying of the [[Pater Noster]]. "The first phrase of the Our Father is a blessing of adoration before it is a supplication. For it is the glory of God that we should recognize Him as "Father", the true God".&lt;ref&gt;CCC §2781&lt;/ref&gt;

Adoration is reflected in the prayer of praise which acknowledges God for who he is in comparison to the prayer of thanksgiving which acknowledges God for what he has done. Rev. Raniero Cantalamesa observed that "the greatest danger with God is for us to become accustomed to him, to fall from awe into routine."&lt;ref&gt;Cantalamesa, Raniero. ''Praise Him'', January 2003, Vol. XXIX, No. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Adoration also takes the form of [[Eucharistic adoration]]. The Catholic belief in [[transubstantiation]] is that the [[Real Presence|bread and wine]] literally become the body and blood of Jesus Christ, through which Catholics adore Jesus Christ. The [[sacramental bread|host]] is usually placed in a [[monstrance]], and reverently viewed at [[Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament|Benedictions]] and during adoration. Some churches contain "adoration chapels" in which the [[Eucharist]] is continuously on display that the faithful may observe their faith through it. "The [[John Vianney|Cure of Ars]] would spend hours in front of the Blessed Sacrament. When people would ask him what he would do or say during those hours, he would say: 'He looks at me, and I look at him.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=6558 Grutsch, Paul. "Adoration", Ignatius Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association of Christian Schools, Colleges and Universities''' ('''ACSCU''') was established in 1946. It recognizes and commits itself to the sacred task of providing quality Christian education and promoting among its members a sense of unity, understanding and fellowship for better service to the community.

The members are non-stock and non-profit Protestant founded schools or institutions in the Philippines which are affiliated with Christian churches or denominations. Each includes the teaching of the Holy Bible as part of its curricula, particularly teaching that Jesus Christ is the only Incarnate Son of God. All revenues and grants received are utilized for educational services to the students. 

ACSCU is a founding member of the Coordinating Council of Private Educational Associations (COCOPEA). It cooperates with the COCOPEA member associations, namely: the Catholic Educational Association of the Philippines (CEAP), the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities (PACU), the Philippine Association of Private Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAPSCU), and the Technical-Vocational Schools Association of the Philippines (TEVSAPHIL).

ACSCU is still a growing association. At present it consists only of one hundred eighteen (118) member schools spread in 16 regions of the [[Philippines]]: six universities, three seminaries, 40 colleges, and 69 basic education schools.

==Representation==
There are eleven (11) denominations represented in ACSCU, namely:
# [[Convention of Philippine Baptist Churches]]
# [[Episcopal Church in the Philippines]]
# [[First Church of God]]
# [[Independent Baptist Church]]
# [[Interdenominational Church]]
# [[Philippine Baptist Church]]
# [[Philippine Independent Church]]
# [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]
# [[United Church of Christ in the Philippines]]
# [[United Evangelical Church]]
# [[United Methodist Church]]

In January 2010, Bizzle released "You Got Some Explaining to Do" directed towards [[Jay-Z]], calling the rap icon out on his negative references towards Jesus and Christianity in his music. The video caused much controversy and generated a buzz that even Bizzle couldn't anticipate. He released a statement in an interview with AllHipHop.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watkins|first=Greg|title=Christian Rapper Explains Jay-Z Diss|url=http://allhiphop.com/2010/01/23/christian-rapper-explains-jay-z-diss/|publisher=AllHipHop|accessdate=February 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Mark Felder was raised mostly by his mother in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. His father stayed in Compton, California. As a child growing up, his family was quite poor living in [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] housing.&lt;ref name=mystep&gt;{{cite web|last=Felder|first=Mark|title=Truth or Dare|url=http://www.mystep.me/truth-or-dare/bizzle|work=My Step|accessdate= February 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark was around thirteen the first time he stepped in a music studio. Listening to [[Tupac Shakur|Tupac]], he began to establish a talent for writing rhymes but noticed that his content usually mimicked those he listened to, whether it was his uncle or other rappers.

After graduating, Mark put out five mixtapes and began circulating them in malls, clubs, radio stations and anywhere else he could.

While trying to move his music, his financial situation got worse. As he stated in an interview, his "financial situation got so bad he was sleeping on a friend's floor and his car was a closet for his clothes."&lt;ref&gt;Thomasos, Christine.

===2004-08 L.A.V. Mixtapes===
Between the years 2004-2008 Bizzle released 'L.A.V. Mixtapes' Volume's 1-5 in [[Southern California]]. He then released 'Dirty West Mixtapes' 1 and 2 with [[360 Records]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], and returned to California to release his biggest yet, 'Certified Mixtape'.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;

In 2005 he was offered a deal by 360 Records out of Houston and declined.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt; Two years later, Bizzle had been offered a deal by [[Barry Hankerson]] to sign with [[Blackground]]/[[Universal Music Group|Universal]], but he also declined that offer.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;

Bizzle spent three years preparing his debut album ''Grind Pays''. Multiple singles where spread causing his [[Myspace]] plays to rapidly increase over 500,000.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;

===Conversion to Christianity===

{{quotation | Here is an excerpt from Mark's interview with [[The Christian Post]] explaining his conversion:

''"A woman who was a prostitute liked my music. I had friends that were getting paid in that way, (so) I fell into this situation where I was pretty much a pimp and she was my prostitute."

Although Bizzle, also known as Lavyss, admitted that he was able to gain fast money, that all came to an end when the prostitute asked him to pick up her brother at their family church. While Bizzle didn't automatically feel guilty for his lifestyle, the situation made him think twice about his path.

"''(Her brother) was a drummer in a church, that was her family's church. The problem was that I didn't feel as guilty as I should have," Bizzle recalled. "I knew it was wrong but because of the money that was coming in, I wasn't going to tell her what the Lord was telling me. Eventually I came to Christ after realizing how far I had gone from him. That scared me.''"''}}

Not long after, Mark established the God Over Money Records recording label and began making music with a different purpose.

===2008-11 ''The Jay-Z diss, The Messenger trilogy &amp; Tough Love &amp; Parables''===

The influence of his Christianity and Mark's exposure to the dark side of hip hop ultimately prompted his questioning of the dark imagery that appears to be promoted through the music of rappers like Kanye West,Rick Ross, and Jay-Z.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihiphopmusic.com/bizzle-the-good-fight-album-cover-release-date.html |title=Bizzle "The Good Fight" Album Cover + Release Date |publisher=Ihiphopmusic.com |date=March 19, 2013 |accessdate=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 17, 2010 he released the track "You Got Some Explaining to Do", a song directed towards [[Jay-Z]], exposing him for his negative references towards Jesus in his lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;Thomasos, Christine.

He released his first Christian [[mixtape]], ''The Messenger'', on March 30, 2010 on DatPiff.&lt;ref name=TheMessenger&gt;{{cite web|title=The Messenger Mixtape |url=http://www.datpiff.com/Lavyss-Aka-Bizzle-The-Christian-Rapper-The-Messenger-Mixtape.109265.html|accessdate=February 18, 2014|date=March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mixtape received much success and has been downloaded over 1 million times since its release.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt; ''The Messenger 2: Delivered'' &amp; ''The Messenger 3: Truth Music'' followed in 2010 &amp; 2011 respectively.

=== "Same Love" controversy ===
On January 28, 2014, Bizzle released a single entitled "Same Love (A Response)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singles ~ God Over Money Records|url=http://godovermoney.com/releases/singles/}}&lt;/ref&gt; that takes its cue from the pro-gay rights single "[[Same Love]]" by [[Macklemore]] and [[Ryan Lewis]]. It opens with the rapper reciting a quotation from the [[Book of Timothy]] then leads into the same instrumental track as Macklemore's original.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schroeder|first=Audra|title=This Christian rapper has his own 'Same Love,' and it's not exactly LGBT-friendly|url=http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/bizzle-same-love-response/|publisher=The Daily Dot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song is critical of the media in its promotion of homosexuality, stating that it is hypocritical to call for tolerance for same-sex relationships while at the same time branding opponents of them as "hateful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bizzle - Same Love ( a Response) Lyrics|url=https://genius.com/Bizzle-same-love-a-response-lyrics|publisher=Genius.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also takes offense at the analogy of gay rights with the civil rights struggle of blacks,&lt;ref name="Kyles"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Roman|title=Christian Rapper Bizzle Responds To Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis' "Same Love": Bizzle takes issue with Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis comparing the LGBT struggle to the Black struggle.|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.27305/title.christian-rapper-bizzle-responds-to-macklemore-ryan-lewis-same-love-|publisher=HipHopDX}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Broderick|first=Ryan|title=BuzzFeed A Christian Rapper Recorded An Anti-Gay Version Of Macklemore’s "Same Love" |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanhatesthis/a-christian-rapper-recorded-an-anti-gay-version-of-macklemor|publisher=BuzzFeed LGBT}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also encourages Christians who struggle with homosexuality to "fight the good fight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kyles|first=Yohance|title=LISTEN: Christian Rapper Bizzle Releases Response to Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis’ "Same Love"|url=http://www.blackchristiannews.com/2014/01/christian-rapper-bizzle-releases-response-to-macklemore-ryan-lewis-same-love/|publisher=Black Christian News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Justin Bieber Instagram handle controversy===

On February 11, 2014, [[US Magazine]] reported that [[Justin Bieber]] had changed his Instagram handle to 'bizzle'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/justin-bieber-instagram-name-bizzle-for-now-2014112|title=Justin Bieber Changes Instagram Name to Bizzle "For Now"|work=[[US Magazine]]|publisher=[[Victoria Lasdon Rose]]|accessdate=February 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing that "''the moniker ‘Bizzle’ actually belongs to a Christian rapper based in L.A.''"

'''Chanira Bajracharya''' (born 1995 in Nepal) is a former [[Kumari (goddess)|Kumari]] or Living Goddess of [[Patan, nepal|Patan]] in [[Nepal]]. She was chosen as living goddess in 2000 April and was enthroned when she was five years-old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27885141 |title=Nepal's living goddess who still has to do homework |last=Narang |first=Sonia |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=2014-06-18 |accessdate=2016-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her reign ended when she reached puberty at the age of 15 when she menstruated for the first time, as is customary for Kumaris. She was succeeded by [[Samita Bajracharya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/05/28/410074105/the-very-strange-life-of-nepals-child-goddess|title=The Very Strange Life Of Nepal's Child Goddess|publisher=npr.org |date=2015-08-28 |last=McCarthy |first=Julie|accessdate=2016-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Guercino Return of the prodigal son.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Prodigal Son]]]]

The doctrine of [[sin]] is central to Christianity, since its [[The gospel|basic message]] is about [[redemption (theology)|redemption]] in [[Jesus in Christianity|Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;Rahner, p. 1588&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christianity|Christian]] [[hamartiology]] describes sin as an act of offence against [[God in Christianity|God]] by despising his [[Trinity|persons]] and [[Biblical law in Christianity|Christian biblical law]], and by injuring others.&lt;ref&gt;Sabourin, p. 696&lt;/ref&gt; In Christian views it is an [[evil]] human act, which violates the rational nature of man as well as [[Trinity|God's nature]] and his [[eternal law]]. According to the classical definition of [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine of Hippo]] sin is "a word, deed, or desire in opposition to the eternal law of God."&lt;ref&gt;''Contra Faustum Manichaeum'', 22,27; [[Patrologia Latina|PL]] 42,418; cf. [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Summa Theologica|STh]] I–II q71 a6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mc Guinness, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

Among some scholars, sin is understood mostly as legal infraction or contract violation of non-binding philosophical frameworks and perspectives of [[Christian ethics]], and so [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] tends to be viewed in legal terms.

Other Christian scholars understand sin to be fundamentally relational—a loss of love for the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]] and an elevation of [[self-love]] ("concupiscence", in this sense), as was later propounded by Augustine in his debate with the [[Pelagianism|Pelagians]].&lt;ref&gt;''On Grace and Free Will'' (see ''Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers'', trans. P.Holmes, vol. 5; 30–31 [14–15]).&lt;/ref&gt;  As with the legal definition of sin, this definition also affects the understanding of [[Grace in Christianity|Christian grace]] and salvation, which are thus viewed in relational terms.&lt;ref&gt;Christian grace is understood as God's love brought to the human soul by the [[God the Holy Spirit]] (Romans 5:5), and salvation is the establishment of that love relationship.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a historical review of this understanding, see R.N.Frost, "Sin and Grace", in Paul L. Metzger, ''Trinitarian Soundings'', T&amp;T Clark, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sin in the Bible==

&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[Christianity|Christian]] doctrine of humanity's state of [[sin]] resulting from the [[fall of man]], stemming from Adam's rebellion in [[Garden of Eden|Eden]], namely the [[Forbidden fruit|sin of disobedience in consuming from the tree of knowledge of good and evil]].{{sfn|ODCC|2005|p=Original sin}} This condition has been characterized in many ways, ranging from something as insignificant as a slight deficiency, or a tendency toward sin yet without collective guilt, referred to as a "sin nature", to something as drastic as [[total depravity]] or automatic guilt of all humans through [[Guilt (emotion)#Collective guilt|collective guilt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brodd|first=Jefferey|title=World Religions|publisher=Saint Mary's Press|year=2003|location=Winona, MN|isbn=978-0-88489-725-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of original sin was first alluded to in the 2nd century by [[Irenaeus]], [[Bishop of Lyon]] in his controversy with certain [[dualistic cosmology|dualist]] [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]]. Other church fathers such as [[Augustine]] also developed the doctrine,{{sfn|ODCC|2005|p=Original sin}} seeing it as based on the [[New Testament]] teaching of [[Paul the Apostle]] ({{bibleref2|Romans|5:12–21}} and {{bibleref2|1 Corinthians|15:22}}) and the Old Testament verse of {{bibleref2|Psalm|51:5}}.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Nathan – [http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/article.aspx?id=227 The Original View of Original Sin] – Retrieved 14 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phil Porvaznik – [http://www.philvaz.com/apologetics/num54.htm Original Sin Explained and Defended] Evangelical Catholic Apologetics – Retrieved 14 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nazarene.org/ministries/administration/visitorcenter/articles/ Preamble and Articles of Faith] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020030856/http://nazarene.org/ministries/administration/visitorcenter/articles/ |date=2013-10-20 }} – V.

== Roman Catholic views ==

=== Thomas Aquinas ===
[[File:Thomas Aquinas in Stained Glass crop.jpg|thumb|right|Aquinas distinguished between [[Sin of omission|sins of omission]], and sins of commission&lt;ref name =Aquinas/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | title = Catholic Encyclopedia: Omission | url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11251b.htm | publisher= New Advent | accessdate = 28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | title = Aquinas: Aquinas's Thoughts On Morality | url= http://library.thinkquest.org/18775/aquinas/moraq.htm | publisher=The Philosopher's Lighthouse | accessdate = 28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The way [[Thomas Aquinas]] viewed sin and vices was radically different from later approaches, especially that of 17th-century [[moral theology]]. He presented sin and vices as contraries of [[virtue]]s. He discusses the subject in his [[Summa Theologica]] part Ia–IIae (''Prima secundae'') qq. 71–89.&lt;ref&gt;Pinckaers, pp. 220 and 225–6&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of his definitions of sin Thomas quotes [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s description of sin as "a thought, words and deed against the Eternal Law."'&lt;ref&gt;''Contra Faustum'', 22, 27, [[Patrologia Latina|PL]] 44,418:&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Quote|
Now there are two rules of the human will: one is proximate and homogeneous, viz. the human reason; the other is the first rule, viz. the eternal law, which is God's reason, so to speak  (quasi ratio Dei). Accordingly Augustine includes two things in the definition of sin; one, pertaining to the substance of a human act, and which is the matter, so to speak, of sin, when he says, word, deed, or desire; the other, pertaining to the nature of evil, and which is the form, as it were, of sin, when he says, contrary to the eternal law. (STh I–II q.71 a.6)&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Thomas Aquinas [[Summa Theologica]] I–II q. 71 [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0023/__P6F.HTM Of Vice and Sin Considered in Themselves]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To recognise the possibilities of sin in man is equal to acknowledge his human nature, his control and mastery of his own actions. Sin is a motion to the goal, it is judged by the object to which it is directed. The field of sin is the same as the field of virtue. There are three major fields: relationship with God, with oneself and with the neighbour. Thomas distinguished between [[mortal sin|mortal]] and [[venial sin]]s. Mortal sin is when a person has irreparably destroyed the very principle of his/her order to the goal of life. Venial sin is when he/she has acted in a certain disordered way without destructing that principle:
{{quote|
Consequently it is a mortal sin generically, whether it be contrary to the love of God, e.g. blasphemy, perjury, and the like, or against the love of one's neighbour, e.g. murder, adultery, and such like: wherefore such sins are mortal by reason of their genus. Sometimes, however, the sinner's will is directed to a thing containing a certain inordinateness, but which is not contrary to the love of God and one's neighbour, e.g. an idle word, excessive laughter, and so forth: and such sins are venial by reason of their genus. (STh I–II q.72 a.5)}}

According to Aquinas the gravity of sin depends also on ''some disposition of the agent'' (cf. STh I–II q. 18, aa. 4, 6). Sin, venial by reason of its object, may become mortal. It happens when person fixes his/her ultimate happiness, the last end of his/her life (Lat. ''finis ultimus'') in the object of that venial sin. When venial sin is used as a way to provoke mortal sin it becomes mortal as well, e.g. when someone uses empty conversation or a chat to seduce someone to commit adultery. Also sin, mortal by reason of its object, may become venial because of the agent's disposition when his/her evil act does not have full moral capacity, i.e. is not deliberated by reason. That may happen for instance when sudden movements of unbelief arise in the mind. (Cf. STh I–II q.72 a.5).

The difference and gravity of sins may be discerned on the grounds of spirit and flesh, even mortal sins may differ in gravity. [[wikt:Carnal|Carnal]] sins like lust, adultery or fornication, gluttony and avarice, because the person who commits them is inordinately directed towards material goods that are a serious matter, are mortal sins. They may cause much shame and infamy. But spiritual sins like [[blasphemy|blaspheming]] of God or [[apostasy]] are, according to Thomas, still greater evil, as they have more of the aversion from God. They are directed against a greater object. The formal, essential element of sin is more at the centre in them. (cf. STh I–II q.72 a.2)&lt;ref name =Aquinas&gt;Cf. Thomas Aquinas [[Summa Theologica]] I–II q. 72 [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0023/__P6G.HTM Of the Distinction of Sins]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, pp. 255–272&lt;/ref&gt;

According to another formulation of the concept of sin in the ''Summa'', at the heart of sin is "the turning away from the immutable good", i.e. God, and "inordinate turning to mutable good", i.e. creatures. (STh I–IIae q.87 a.4) This cannot be understood as if in the concrete sinful deed the sinner commits two separate and independent acts. Both ''aversio'' and ''conversio'' constitute one single guilty action. At the root of the inordinate turning to the creatures is self-love which expresses itself in disordered desire (''cupiditas'') and rebellion towards God (''superbia'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Josef Pieper | authorlink = Josef Pieper | title = The Concept of Sin | year = 2001 | pages = 60–63}}; cf. Thomas Aquinas, ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' II–IIae q34 a2; I q94 a1; II–IIae q162 a6; I–IIae q72 a2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking about [[Sloth (deadly sin)|sloth]] (Lat. ''acedia'') Thomas points out that every deed which "by its very nature is contrary to charity is a mortal sin". An effect of such deed is the destruction of "spiritual life which is the effect of charity, whereby God dwells in us." Sin of a mortal character is always committed with the consent of reason: "Because the consummation of sin is in the consent of reason"'. (cf. STh II–IIae q.35 a.3) Venial and mortal sins can be compared to sickness and death. While venial sin impairs full healthy activity of a person, mortal sin destroys the principle of spiritual life in him/her.&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Catechism ===
[[Roman Catholic]] doctrine distinguishes between personal sin (also sometimes called "actual sin") and [[original sin]]. Personal sins are either mortal or venial.

[[Mortal sin]]s are sins of grave (serious) matter, where the sinner performs the act with full knowledge and deliberate consent. (cf. [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|CCC 1857]])

The act of committing a mortal sin destroys charity, i. e. the [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] in the heart of a Christian; it is in itself a rejection of God (CCC1855). If left un-reconciled, mortal sins may lead to eternal separation from God, traditionally called [[damnation]].

[[Venial sin]]s are sins which do not meet the conditions for mortal sins. The act of committing a venial sin does not cut off the sinner from God's grace, as the sinner has not rejected God. However, venial sins do injure the relationship between the sinner and God, and as such, must be reconciled to God, either through the [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Sacrament of Reconciliation]] or receiving the Eucharist (after proper contrition fulfilled).

Both mortal and venial sins have a dual nature of punishment. They incur both guilt for the sin, yielding eternal punishment, and temporal punishment for the sin. Reconciliation is an act of God's mercy, and addresses the guilt and eternal punishment for sin. Purgatory and indulgences address the temporal punishment for sin, and exercise of God's justice.

Roman Catholic doctrine also sees sin as being twofold: Sin is, at once, any evil or immoral ''action'' which infracts God's law and the inevitable consequences, the ''state of being'' that comes about by committing the sinful action. Sin can and does alienate a person both from God and the community. Hence, the Catholic Church's insistence on reconciliation with both God and the Church itself.

The [[Roman Catholic]] view of sin has recently expanded. [[Monsignor]] [[Gianfranco Girotti]], [[Regent]] of the Catholic  [[Apostolic Penitentiary]], has said that "known sins increasingly manifest themselves as behavior that damages society as a whole,"&lt;ref name="cnnvat"&gt;{{cite news |title= Vatican lists new sinful behaviors |agency = Associated Press |year = 2008 |url = http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/wayoflife/03/10/vatican.updates.sins.ap/index.html| accessdate = 2008-03-10 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080311142051/http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/wayoflife/03/10/vatican.updates.sins.ap/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; including, for example:
* "certain violations of the fundamental rights of human nature, through genetic manipulations [or experiments],"
* "drug [abuse], which weakens the mind and obscures intelligence,"
* "[[environmental pollution]],"
* "abortion and pedophilia," and
* the widening social and economic differences between the rich and the poor, which "''cause an unbearable social injustice''" (accumulating excessive wealth, inflicting poverty). The revision was aimed at encouraging confession or the [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Sacrament of Penance]].

Mortal sins, which are any severe and intentional actions that directly disobey God, are often confused with the [[seven deadly sins]], which are pride, envy, wrath, sloth, greed, gluttony, and lust. They are not, however, the same. The seven deadly sins are called "deadly" because they might lead another to commit other sins. Some forms of the seven deadly sins (i.e. debilitating one's health because of their love of food) can constitute as grave matter, while others may just be venal (i.e. over-eating).

Another group of four or five sins distinguished by the Church are the [[sins that cry to heaven]]: murder, sodomy, (oppression of a people,) oppression of the weak and defrauding the laborer.&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church,'' 1997: "1867 The catechetical tradition also recalls that there are "sins that cry to heaven": the blood of Abel, the sin of the Sodomites, the cry of the people oppressed in Egypt, the cry of the foreigner, the widow, and the orphan, injustice to the wage earner."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Seven deadly sins}}

== Protestant views ==
Many [[Protestantism|Protestants]] of a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] orientation teach that, due to [[original sin]], humanity has lost any and all capacity to move towards reconciliation with God (Romans 3:23;6:23; Ephesians 2:1–3); in fact, this inborn sin turns humans away from God and towards themselves and their own desires (Isaiah 53:6a). Thus, humans may be brought back into a relationship with God only by way of God's rescuing the sinner from his/her hopeless condition (Galatians 5:17–21; Ephesians 2:4–10) through Jesus' [[substitutionary atonement]] (Romans 5:6–8; Colossians 2:13–15; 1 Timothy 2:5–6). According to traditional Reformed theology and classical [[Lutheranism]], Salvation is ''[[sola fide]]'' (by faith alone); ''[[sola gratia]]'' (by grace alone); and is begun and completed by God alone through [[Christ Jesus|Jesus]] (Ephesians 2:8,9). This understanding of original sin (Romans 5:12–19), is most closely associated with Calvinist doctrine (see [[total depravity]]) and Lutheranism. Calvinism allows for the relative or nominal "goodness" of humanity through God's [[common grace]] upon both those [[predestination (Calvinism)|predestined]] to salvation and those predestined to damnation, upon the [[regeneration (theology)#Calvinism and Reformed theology|regenerate]] and the unregenerate. [[Methodism|Methodist]] [[Arminianism|Arminian]] theology adapts the concept by stating that humans, entirely sinful and totally depraved, can only "do good" through God's ''[[prevenient grace]]''.

This is in contrast to the Roman Catholic teaching that while sin has tarnished the original goodness of humanity prior to the Fall, it has not entirely extinguished that goodness, or at least the ''potential'' for goodness, allowing humans to reach towards God to share in the [[Redemption (religious)|Redemption]] which Jesus Christ won for them. Some Protestants and Orthodox Christians hold similar views.

There is dispute about where sin originated. Some who interpret the king of Tyre in Ezekiel 28 as a symbol for [[Satan]] believe sin originated when Satan coveted the position that rightfully belongs to God. The origin of individual sins is discussed in James 1:14–15 – "&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed. &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death." ([[NIV]])

=== Defined types of sin ===
Within some branches of Protestantism, there are several defined types of sin (as in Roman Catholicism):

*[[Original sin]]—Most denominations of Christianity interpret the [[Garden of Eden]] account in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] in terms of the [[fall of man]]. Adam and Eve's disobedience was the first sin man ever committed, and their ''original sin'' (or the effects of the sin) is passed on to their descendants (or has become a part of their environment). See also: [[total depravity]].
*[[Concupiscence]]
*[[Venial sin]]
*[[Greed]]
*[[Lust]]
*[[Pride]]
*[[Mortal sin]]
*[[Eternal sin]]—Commonly called the Unforgivable sin (mentioned in {{bibleref|Matthew|12:31}}), this is perhaps the most controversial sin, whereby someone has become an [[apostate]], forever denying themselves a life of faith and experience of [[salvation]]; the precise nature of this sin is often disputed.

== Eastern Christian views ==
The ([[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian]]) [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] as well as the ([[miaphysitism|non-Chalcedonian]]) [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] use "sin" both to refer to humanity's fallen condition and to refer to individual sinful acts. In many ways the [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|Orthodox Christian]] view of sin is similar to the Jewish, although neither form of Orthodoxy makes formal distinctions among "grades" of sins.

The [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], which derive their theology and spirituality from same sources as the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox, tend not to adhere to the Roman Catholic distinction between [[mortal sin|mortal]] and [[venial sin]] taught by the [[Latin Church]]. Like the Orthodox Churches, however, the Eastern Catholic Churches do make a distinction between sins that are serious enough to bar one from [[Holy Communion]] (and must be [[Confession (religion)|confessed]] before receiving once again) and those which are not sufficiently serious to do so. In this respect, the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Tradition]] is similar to the [[Western Christianity|Western]], but the Eastern Churches do not consider death in such a state to automatically mean damnation to "hell."{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Jehovah's Witnesses==
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] believe that sin is inherited, like a disease, and has been passed on from generation to generation of humans, beginning with [[Adam and Eve]], whom Witnesses believe are real historical characters.&lt;ref&gt;"What Does the Bible ''Really '' Teach" pp. 61–63 'Why humans die?'&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that it began with the Devil, and then with humans wanting to decide for themselves what was "Good and Bad." They believe that at that very moment they lost perfection and began to die. Jehovah's Witnesses consider human beings to ''be'' souls, and so when a human dies due to sin, they believe that his soul dies as well.&lt;ref&gt;"What Does the Bible ''Really '' Teach" pp. 57–65 'Where are the Dead?'&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that [[Jesus]] is the only human ever to have lived and died sinless.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

==Atonement==
{{Main|Atonement in Christianity}}
In Christianity, it is generally understood that the death of Jesus was a [[Human sacrifice|sacrifice]] that relieves believers of the burden of their sins. However, the actual meaning of this precept is very widely debated. The traditional teaching of some churches traces this idea of atonement to [[korban|blood sacrifices]] in the ancient Hebraic faith.

Christian theologians have presented different interpretations of atonement:
* [[Origen]] taught that the death of Christ was a ''[[Atonement (ransom view)|ransom]]'' paid to [[Satan]] in satisfaction of his claim on the souls of humanity as a result of sin. This was opposed by theologians such as St. [[Gregory Nazianzen]], who maintained that this would have made Satan a power equal to God.
* [[Irenaeus of Lyons]] taught that Christ recapitulated in himself all the stages of life of sinful man, and that his perfect obedience substituted for [[Adam and Eve|Adam]]'s disobedience.
* [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] taught that Christ came to overcome death and corruption, and to remake humanity in God's image again.&lt;ref&gt;See ''On the Incarnation'', by St. Athanasius&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Augustine of Hippo]] said that sin was not a created thing at all, but was "privatio boni", a "taking away of good".
* [[Anselm of Canterbury]] taught that Christ's death satisfied God's offended sense of justice over the sins of humanity. God rewarded Christ's obedience, which built up a storehouse of merit and a treasury of grace that believers could share by their faith in Christ. This view is known as the ''[[satisfaction theory of atonement]]'', the ''merit'' theory, or sometimes the ''commercial'' theory. Anselm's teaching is contained in his treatise ''[[Cur Deus Homo]]'' (''Why God Became Human''). Anselm's ideas were later expanded utilizing [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] philosophy into a grand theological system by [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the 13th century, particularly in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', which although initially inciting controversy eventually became official [[Roman Catholic]] [[doctrine]].
* [[Pierre Abélard]] developed the view that Christ's [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] was God suffering with his creatures in order to show the greatness of his love for them, and the realization of this love in turn leads to repentance. It is often known as the ''[[moral influence theory of atonement]]'' and became central to more [[religious liberalism|liberal strands]] of Christian theology.
* [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]], leaders of the [[Protestant Reformation]], owed much to Anselm's theory and taught that Christ, the only sinless person, was obedient to take upon himself the penalty for the sins that should have been visited on men and women. This view is a version of ''[[substitutionary atonement]]'' and is sometimes called the ''[[penal substitution]] view''. It is derived from the Roman Catholic ''[[satisfaction theory of atonement]]'', although it is not identical to that of Anselm. Calvin additionally advocated a doctrine of [[limited atonement]], which teaches that the atonement extends and applies only to the sins of the eternally [[predestination (Calvinism)|predestined]] [[election (Christianity)|elect]] rather than to the entire [[human race]], whereas Anselm affirmed a general redemption for all humanity and denied that Christ received punishment for sins, although he made satisfaction to God.
* [[D.L. Moody]] once said, "If you are under the power of evil, and you want to get under the power of God, cry to Him to bring you over to His service; cry to Him to take you into His army. He will hear you; He will come to you, and, if need be, He will send a legion of angels to help you to fight your way up to heaven. God will take you by the right hand and lead you through this wilderness, over death, and take you right into His kingdom. That's what the Son of Man came to do. He has never deceived us; just say here; "Christ is my deliverer.""
* [[Arminianism]] has traditionally taught what is known as the ''[[governmental theory of atonement]]''. Drawing primarily from the works of [[Jacobus Arminius]] and especially [[Hugo Grotius]], the governmental theory teaches that Christ suffered for humankind so that God could forgive humans while still maintaining divine justice. Unlike the traditional [[Calvinism|Reformed]] perspective, this view states that Christ was not punished by God the Father in the place of sinners, for true forgiveness would not be possible if humankind's offenses were already punished. Christ's suffering was a real and meaningful ''[[substitutionary atonement]]'' for the punishment humans deserve, but Christ was not punished on behalf of some or all of the human race. This view has prospered in traditional [[Methodism]] and all who follow the teachings of [[John Wesley]], and has been detailed by, among others, 19th century [[Methodist]] theologian [[John Miley]] in his  ''Atonement in Christ'' and 20th century [[Church of the Nazarene]] theologian [[J. Kenneth Grider]] in his ''Wesleyan-Holiness Theology''. Variations of this view have also been espoused by 18th century Puritan [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] and 19th century revival leader [[Charles Grandison Finney]].
* [[Karl Barth]] taught that Christ's death manifested God's love and his hatred for sin.
* Barbara Reid, a dissenting Roman Catholic [[feminist theology|feminist]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominican nun]], argues that commonly conceived atonement theologies are harmful, especially to women and other oppressed minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara E. Reid, ''Taking Up the Cross: New Testament Interpretations Through Latina and Feminist Eyes'' (Fortress, 2007), 17–19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other [[religious liberalism|liberal]] and [[liberation theology|radical theologians]] have also challenged traditional views of atonement. (see [[collective salvation]])
* [[Mary Baker Eddy]], founder of the [[Christian Science]] movement, taught that atonement exemplifies our underlying spiritual unity with God, whereby we reflect divine Love (God): Christ's atonement reconciles man to God, not God to man.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8457">"'''El Malei Rachamim'''" ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: אֵל מָלֵא רַחֲמִים, lit. “God full of Mercy” or “Merciful God”),  is a [[Jewish prayer]] for the soul of a person who has died, usually recited at the graveside during the burial service and at memorial services during the year.

==Place in the Liturgy==
In the [[Ashkenazi]] [[Jewish prayer|liturgy]], the prayer is usually chanted by a [[chazzan]] for the ascension of the souls of the dead on the following occasions: during the funeral; at an unveiling of the tombstone; ''[[Bereavement_in_Judaism#Yizkor|Yizkor]]'' (Remembrance) service on the four of the Jewish festivals, Yom Kippur, Shmini Atzeret, and the last day of Pesach and Shavuot; on the [[Yahrzeit]] on a day when there is public reading from the Torah, or the closest date before the Yahrzeit; and on other occasions on which the memory of the dead is recalled.&lt;ref name="Eisenberg2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald L. Eisenberg|title=Jewish Traditions: A JPS Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qGHi_9K154C&amp;pg=PA87|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Jewish Publication Society|isbn=978-0-8276-1039-2|pages=87–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] liturgy, a similar prayer is called ''Hashkavah''  and is recited by the reader of the Torah on Mondays and Thursdays.&lt;ref name="BJC33"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Birnbaum|first1=Philip|title=A Book of Jewish Concepts|date=1975|publisher=Hebrew Publishing Company|location=New York|page=33|edition=Revised|chapter=El Male Rahamim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recitation of the prayer in both Ashkenazi and Sephardi liturgies is usually accompanied by pledges for the donation of charity in memory of the deceased.&lt;ref name="BJC33"/&gt;

==Wording of the Prayer==
[[File:Kirkut - Wwa Wola - Detal 111.JPG|thumb|Text of ''El malei rachamim'' at tombstone at [[Okopowa Street Jewish Cemetery|Powązki Jewish cemetery in Warsaw]]]]
The prayer has a fixed structure, composed of a specific text in which is incorporated the deceased's name (in the case of an individual's commemoration), or a description of the deceased (in the case of the commemoration of a group).

אֵל מָלֵא רַחֲמִים שׁוֹכֵן בַּמְּרוֹמִים, הַמְצֵא מְנוּחָה נְכוֹנָה עַל כַּנְפֵי הַשְּׁכִינָה בְּמַעֲלוֹת קְדוֹשִׁים וטְהוֹרִים כְּזוֹהַר הָרָקִיעַ מַזְהִירִים אֶת נִשְׁמַת פלוני בן פלוני שֶׁהָלַךְ לְעוֹלָמוֹ, בַּעֲבוּר שֶׁנָדְבוּ צְדָקָה בְּעַד הַזְכָּרַת נִשְׁמָתוֹ, לָכֵן בַּעַל הָרַחֲמִים יַסְתִּירֵהוּ בְּסֵתֶר כְּנָפָיו לְעוֹלָמִים, וְיִצְרֹר בִּצְרוֹר הַחַיִּים אֶת נִשְׁמָתוֹ, ה' הוּא נַחֲלָתוֹ, וְיָנוּחַ בְּשָׁלוֹם עַל מִשְׁכָּבוֹ, וְנֹאמַר אָמֵן:

God, full of mercy, Who dwells above, give rest on the wings of the Divine Presence, amongst the holy, pure and glorious who shine like the sky, to the soul of ---- son/daughter of ----, for whom charity was offered in the memory of her soul. Therefore, the Merciful One will protect her soul forever, and will merge her soul with eternal life. The Everlasting is her heritage, and she shall rest peacefully at her lying place, and let us say: Amen.

God, full of mercy, who dwells in the heights, provide a sure rest upon the Divine Presence's wings, within the range of the holy, pure and glorious, whose shining resemble the sky's, to the soul of -Stanley Richards--  for whom charity was pledged to the memory of his soul. Therefore, the Master of Mercy will protect him forever, from behind the hiding of his wings, and will tie his soul with the rope of life. The Everlasting is his heritage, and he shall rest peacefully upon his lying place, and let us say: Amen.

The Hebrew is the version for a male and a charitable pledge.  For a female the gender must be changed in the appropriate words; and similarly for a prayer instead of a charitable pledge the words in the Hebrew must be changed.

===Version for the Remembrance of [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] Soldiers===

אֵל מָלֵא רַחֲמִים שׁוכֵן בַּמְּרומִים, הַמְצֵא מְנוּחָה נְכונָה עַל כַּנְפֵי הַשְּׁכִינָה, בְּמַעֲלות קְדושִׁים, טְהורִים וְגִבּורִים, כְּזהַר הָרָקִיעַ מַזְהִירִים. לְנִשְׁמות חַיָּלֵי צְבָא הֲגָנָה לְיִשְׂרָאֵל וְלוֹחָמֵי הָמַחְתָרוֹת שֶׁנָּפְלוּ בְּמִלְחֲמות יִשְׂרָאֵל, וְכל הַלּוחֲמִים בְּמַעַרְכות הָעָם שֶׁחֵרְפוּ נַפְשָׁם לָמוּת עַל קְדֻשַּׁת הַשֵּׁם, וּבְעֶזְרַת אֱלהֵי מַעַרְכות יִשְׂרָאֵל הֵבִיאוּ לִתְקוּמַת הָאֻמָּה וְהַמְּדִינָה וְלִגְאֻלַּת הָאָרֶץ וְעִיר הָאֱלהִים וכל אלה שנרצחו בארץ ומחוצה לה בידי המרצחים מארגוני הטרור.

God, full of mercy, who dwells in the heights, provide a sure rest upon the Divine Presence's wings, within the range of the holy and the pure, whose shining resemble the sky's, all the souls of the six million Jews, victims of the European Holocaust, who were murdered, slaughtered, burnt and exterminated for the Sanctification of the Name, by the German Nazi assassins and their helpers from the rest of the peoples. Therefore, the Master of Mercy will protect them forever, from behind the hiding of his wings, and will tie their souls with the rope of life. The Everlasting is their heritage, the Garden of Eden shall be their resting room, and they shall rest peacefully upon their lying place, they will stand for their fate in the end of days, and let us say: Amen

==Cultural usage==
From this prayer the [[poet]] [[Yehuda Amichai]] wrote his poem "El malei rachamim", starting with the words "אלמלא האל מלא רחמים / היו הרחמים בעולם, ולא רק בו" ([http://www.hofesh.org.il/archive/00/amichai.html the full text of the poem]). "God, full of mercy / If God were not so full of mercy / There would be mercy in the world, not just in Him."

[[File:Gang parents grave.jpg|thumb|The grave of Gang's parents near his birthplace]]'''Gang Il-sun''', (강일순, Chinese 姜甑山) (September 19, 1871 – June 24, 1909),&lt;ref&gt;Lunar calendar.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Kang Il-sun''' and known to his followers as '''Kang Jeungsan''', is the founder of [[Jeungsanism]], a Korean religious movement that generated after his death around one hundred different new religions,&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Daesoon Jinrihoe]] and [[Jeung San Do]]. [[Jeungsanism]], as his movement was called, and various Korean new religions (''sinheung jonggyo'', literally, "newly emerged religions") derived from it, have been seen by scholars as a syncretism of [[Buddhism]] (''Bul-gyo''), [[Confucianism]] (''Yu-gyo''), [[Taoism]] (''Do-gyo'') with unique religious insights of Kang and certain elements borrowed from Christianity (''Gidok-gyo''), as well as an underlying [[Korean shamanism]] (''Musok-Sinang'').&lt;ref&gt;Flaherty (2011), p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:Kangbirthplace.jpg|thumb|Gang Il-sun's birthplace]]
Gang Il-sun was born in Gobu County, [[Jeolla Province]] (present-day Deokcheon Township of [[Jeongeup]], [[North Jeolla Province]], Korea) on September 19, 1871, according to the [[Lunar calendar]] mostly used by his followers.&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; There is a hagiographic literature written by his followers, which describes miraculous phenomena surrounding his early years. For instance, hagiographical accounts record that "at the time of his birth (...) two female fairies descended from heaven into the delivery room," filling it with a "sweet-smelling aroma."&lt;ref&gt;Chong (2016), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, it is claimed that he "learned Chinese classics at a village school and mastered them to the point of memorizing and reciting all of them by heart," through a complete understanding of their meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Chong (2016), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1891, Gang married Jeong Chi-sun (1874-1928), a lady from [[Gimje]] County. In 1894, he opened a school in the home of his brother-in-law Jeong Nam-Gi.&lt;ref&gt;Chong (2016), p. 29; Introvigne (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; He acquired a reputation for his knowledge of Buddhism, Confucianism Taoism, and Korean folk religions, and gathered a few disciples&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Reputedly, he also visited Kim Il Bu (1826-1898), the well known scholar who introduced the ''Jeong-yeok'', i.e. a new interpretation of the Chinese [[I Ching]](Book of Changes).&lt;ref&gt;Chong (2016), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Kim is said to have offered a new arrangement of the I Ching Chinese trigrams, together with other diagrams and an explanatory text, including insights he had received in a mysterious vision. His re-balancing of the trigrams had a profound influence on many Korean new religions, including those derived from Gang.&lt;ref&gt;See Lee (2016), pp. 81-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Donghak==
In 1860 [[Choe Je-u]], concerned about the growing influence of the West, the increasing Japanese presence in Joseon Korea, widespread corruption in government and established religion, and abuse of power by the ''[[yangban]]'' (aristocratic social class), alleged he had a revelation from the Supreme God ''[[Sangje]]'' (''Shang-ti'' in Chinese) and attained enlightenment. Choe Je-u became the founder of the [[Donghak]] (Eastern Learning) movement, the prototype of many subsequent Korean syncretistic new religions. Donghak culminated in the unsuccessful [[Donghak Rebellion]] of 1894, which was fueled by a combination of religious fervor centering on the millennial visions of a coming [[messiah]] and anger regarding Seoul's high taxes. Central to Choe Je-u’s teachings was a belief in Hu-Cheon Gaebyeok, the Great Opening ([[Gaebyeok]]) of the Later World (Hu-Cheon), the new age paradise of Donghak, which also later characterized Gang Il-sun’s millenarian vision.&lt;ref&gt;Rhee (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
Gang Il-sun, in fact, insisted that he was Sangje himself who, prior to incarnating on earth, had bestowed that revelation upon Choe Je-u. Gang "had considerable connections with the Donghak movement, not only ideologically but also geographically," as the village where Gang lived was only four kilometers away from the location where the first uprising of the Donghak revolution began. Later, Gang gathered a number of followers in the North Jeolla province, where he lived, and among them where some members of Donghak.&lt;ref&gt;Chong (2016), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was interested in the religious ideas of Donghak, Gang Il-sun predicted, quite correctly, the defeat of Donghak's peasant militia, and advised his followers not to join it. He believed that the problems of Korea, and human society in general, would be solved through spiritual awakening rather than armed rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Chong (2016), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Messianic Claims==
After the bloody defeat of Donghak, Gang Il-sun wandered around Korea for three years, surveying public sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;Flaherty (2011), pp. 334-335.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, he returned home and, starting in the years that followed, gathered a sizable number of followers. According to these followers, during the Summer of 1901 he achieved enlightenment on the [[Moaksan]] mountain, after forty-nine days of ascetic practices and fasting.&lt;ref&gt;Flaherty (2011), p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the followers claimed for their spiritual leader much more than enlightenment, as they accepted his claim that he was Sangje, the Supreme Lord, who had bestowed a revelation upon Choe Je-u and had than incarnated in this world to initiate a New Age. According to [[Daesoon Jinrihoe]], the largest movement recognizing Gang as Sangje,&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; his ascetic practices in the Moaksan mountain were performed to open the Great Dao of Heaven and Earth and to exercise judgement on the divine beings and were, thus, more than ascetic practices.&lt;ref&gt;Daesoon Institute of Religion and Culture (2016), p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; The followers also claimed that he judged all deities in charge of the Former World, opened the way to the Later World and, through the rituals he performed between 1901 and 1909, achieved a complete “Reordering of the Universe” (''Cheonji Gongsa'').&lt;ref&gt;Lee (2016), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Daesun Jinrihoe believes that there was a residual work of reordering, to be completed by his successors in the religious orthodoxy, Jo Jeongsan (1895-1958) and Park Wudang (1918-1996). Another branch of Jeungsanism, [[Jeung San Do]], believes that, as Gang was God the Father, his female disciple Goh Pan-Lye (1880-1935), revered by Jeung San Do with the title of Tae-mo-nim, was God the mother and between 1926 and 1935 performed her own reordering of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.jsd.or.kr/dojeon/readen.php?mid=70 "Sahng-jeh-nim and Tae-mo-nim"], official Web site of Jeung San Do.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations with the Japanese==
After the Donghak rebellion, Japan had a growing presence in Korea, and this culminated in the [[Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910]] and the formal annexation of Korea by Japan. Gang Il-sun maintained an attitude similar to the one he had exhibited when confronted with the Donghak movement. Although critical of those Koreans who sided unconditionally with the Japanese, Gang Il-sun again advised against "any form of violence" and "stressed reconciliation and peace," insisting also that this period of Japanese rule in Korea would bring resolution to the grievances that Japan had in history&lt;ref&gt;Chong (2016), pp. 42-44.&lt;/ref&gt; His peaceful attitude, however, did not protect him from the suspicions of the Japanese authorities. On December 25, 1907, he and a number of his followers were arrested, based on the suspect that they intended to raise an army against the Japanese. Reportedly, "even in prison, he made peaceful gestures" and "did not protest against the authorities in any way."&lt;ref&gt;Chong (2016), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; He was finally released on February 4, 1908, continued his rituals and preaching, and passed away on June 24, 1909 at the Donggok Clinic he had established in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Kanggrave2.jpg|thumb|Gang Il-sun's grave]]
Gang Il-sun did not designate a successor, and after his passing his movement split into many different factions. In 1911, Goh Pan-Lye (Subu, literally “Head Lady,” although there were two "Subus" in Gang's circle), a female disciple, emerged as the leader of one of the largest factions, which eventually came under the control of Goh's male cousin, Cha Gyeong-Seok (1880-1936). Cha's branch, known as [[Bocheonism]] (Bocheob-gyo), according to some scholars "had more followers during the Japanese colonial period than any other religion, more than an estimated 6 million adherents."&lt;ref&gt;Flaherty (2011), p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it declined quite rapidly. Goh had separated from Cha in 1919 and established her own organization, which in turn divided into several rival factions after her death. Kim Hyeong-Ryeol (1862-1932), another leading disciple of Gang Il-sun, originally supported Cha but left him in 1914 and established yet another branch with the help of Gang Il-sun's widow, Jeong. Again, this branch split into several independent groups.&lt;ref&gt;Lee (1967), pp. 29-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, around one hundred different groups claiming the legacy of Gang Il-sun came into existence,&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne (2017). For an early map, see Lee (1967).&lt;/ref&gt; although few of them survive to this day.

The largest one&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; is [[Daesun Jinrihoe]], which originates from Jo Jeongsan (1895-1958), who was not a direct disciple of Gang Il-sun but claimed to have received a revelation from him in 1917, eight years after Gang Il-sun's death. Jo Jeongsan's followers claim, however, that in 1909 Gang Il-sun saw a train passing, which had Jo Jeongsan, then a teenager, aboard with his family, heading to [[Bongcheon]], [[Manchuria]], to live in exile there, and stated: “A man can do anything at the age of 15 if he is able to take his identification tag (''hopae'') with him.” Jo Jeongsan's disciples later claimed that these words amounted to an endorsement by Gang Il-sun of Jo Jeongsan as his successor.&lt;ref&gt;Ko (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Gang's only daughter, Sun-Im (1904-1959), originally accepted Jo but later established her own branch, known as Jeung San Beob Jong Gyo, which is headquartered in Korea's [[North Jeolla]] province, and after protracted litigation with other branches obtained the mortal remains of Kang, which are currently at its headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;Lee (1967), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Be it as it may be, and although statistics are in turn a matter of contention, there is little doubt that a large number of Koreans, perhaps as much as several millions, are today connected with one or another branch of the religious movement started by Gang Il-sun and recognize him as a divine incarnation, the majority of them belonging to Daesun Jinrihoe.&lt;ref&gt;Baker (2016), pp. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; Both Daesun Jinrihoe and Jeung San Do have also started a missionary activity abroad, particularly in the United States. Certainly, Gang Il-Sun did not believe that his message of salvation was restricted to Korea and indeed he explicitly taught that it was intended for the whole world.&lt;ref&gt;Chong (2016), pp. 47-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Haidakhan Babaji''', simply called "Babaji" or Bhole Baba by his students and devotees, was a teacher who appeared near the village of Haidakhan&lt;ref&gt;Haidakhan is also spelt at times as Hairakhan because the central sound in the name does not exist in English and is something between the R and D sound. Perhaps the best way to write it would be Hairdakhan but that is not usually done.&lt;/ref&gt; in northern [[India]] ([[Uttarakhand]]) and taught publicly from 1970 to 1984.

== Life ==

According to "The Teachings of Babaji," Haidakhan Babaji "appeared" in June 1970 in a cave at the foot of the Kumaon Mount Kailash, across the river Gautama Ganga, near a remote village called Hairakhan, in the [[Nainital district|Nainital]] District of [[Uttrakhand]], India.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;“The Teachings of Babaji,” foreword&lt;/ref&gt; His followers maintain that Haidakhan Babaji is a Mahavatar – "a human manifestation of God, not born from woman."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
[[File:Haidakhan Babaji Kumaon Mount Kailash 1970.jpg|thumb|right]]
It is reported that starting in late September 1970 Haidakhan Babaji spent forty-five days meditating in a small temple on the top of the Kumaon Mount Kailash "without leaving his seat."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In September 1971, Haidakhan Babaji, in a sworn testimony, convinced the judge of the court in Haldwani that he was the "[[Hariakhan Baba|Old Hariakhan Baba]],” thought to be active in that region in the years 1860–1922, and that he had the right to use the [[ashram]]s in Kathgaria and Haidakhan.&lt;ref&gt;Radhe Shyam. (1990). I Am Harmony. PP.125–135.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971 Haidakhan Babaji started travelling across India, proclaiming his Message, performing sacred ceremonies, such as [[yagna]], and attracting more devotees. This included celebrities, such as [[Shammi Kapoor]],&lt;ref&gt;Radhe Shyam. (1990). I Am Harmony. P.158.&lt;/ref&gt;  and gradually more Westerners.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance: Gaura Devi. (2001). Fire of Transformation. My life with Babaji.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though some of his followers&lt;ref&gt;See for instance: Orr, Leonard, 1988, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; believed he was immortal, Haidakhan Babaji died on 14 February 1984, of what appeared to be a heart failure. He was buried in Haidakhan Ashram.  This is how Babaji foretold and explained his death:

{{quote|My body is meant to dry up one day. This body is nothing; it is here only to serve people. (…) Even my own body has come only to perform a duty to serve all human and all living things.&lt;ref&gt;The Teachings of Babaji. 2 February 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Teachings ==

Haidakhan Babaji maintained that: “All religions are incorporated in the principle of Truth, Simplicity and Love.”&lt;ref&gt;The Teachings of Babaji, 25 December 1981&lt;/ref&gt; In his living years he taught intensively the importance to live a simple life with loving principles in truth. Although worshipped according to local customs, Haidakhan Babaji explained that he came to restore [[Sanatana Dharma]] rather than Hindu Dharma ([[Hinduism]]).  Sanatan Dharma can be understood as a primordial religion reflecting natural laws established at the beginning of the Creation.&lt;ref&gt;The Teachings of Babaji, 25 March 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; He explained further: "I have come to guide humanity to a higher path. I do not belong to any particular religion, but respect all religions. I seek the elevation of all mankind. "&lt;ref&gt;The Teachings of Babaji, 29 July 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

He stressed the unity of all religions as expressed in the following words: "In any town there is always a central place; all the roads in the town or from out of town lead to that central place. Similarly, all religions lead to one point, and that is God Himself; and therefore following any religion you will ultimately reach God."&lt;ref&gt;The Teachings of Babaji, 24 December 1981&lt;/ref&gt;  He said:  "We are all one with each other and with God."&lt;ref&gt;The Teachings of Babaji, 2 April 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Haidakhan Babaji said: "You should seek harmony in everything you do. I am harmony. Thank you for your love."&lt;ref&gt;The Teachings of Babaji, 12 April 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;More on this subject can be found in the book: "I Am Harmony", by Radhe Shyam (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;   Haidakhan Babaji proclaimed: "One can follow any religion, one can follow any practice or path, but one must be humane."&lt;ref&gt;The Teachings of Babaji, 22 January 1983&lt;/ref&gt;  He said: "The world now is in a state of turmoil. It is suffering from three kinds of pain – physical, mental, spiritual – and there is only one way of being cured from these. We have to root out inhumanity and replace it with humanity. (…) He also made the following statement: "The only true man is one who practices 'humanism.' (…) this is the only way to success in life."&lt;ref name="Ibidem_d"&gt;The Teachings of Babaji, 29 October 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Babaji talked about the importance of hard work and proper performance of one’s duty so often that Karma Yoga should be considered the central element of his teachings.  Babaji used to say that: "Work is worship"&lt;ref name="Babaji 1981"&gt;The Teachings of Babaji, 23 October 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;  and that hard work is the best spiritual practice.  On another occasion he said: "If you are engaged in doing good deeds and go on doing good acts, you will have good sleep, good appetite and bad thoughts will not cross your mind. Otherwise, you will always be criticizing others. In inaction, your minds will always be engaged in thinking critically of others. Karma – activity – is the only thing which can drive out all evils.”&lt;ref&gt;The Teachings of Babaji, 17 November 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Babaji also taught that "perfection in work" was the real meaning of [[Kriya]] Yoga.&lt;ref&gt;The Teachings of Babaji, 10 November 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Haidakhan Babaji.jpg|left|thumb]]

[[Japa|Nama Japa]], the repetition of God's Name, was a fundamental part of Haidakhan Babaji's teachings:

:''Have faith! Reciting the Name of the Lord is not the first, but the last stage of spiritual practice! When lions enter the forest, the other animals run away. Likewise, all evil thoughts will vanish with the recitation of the Lord's name. Reciting the Name of the Lord will bring you the company of a good people and you will be near saints. Blessed are the few who will discard the kingdom of the world for the Lord's name. Such a devotee always resides in My heart. In the womb, you take a vow not to get attached; but as soon as you come out, you get entangled. Abandon attachment! Your mind plays tricks on you! That is why you are after pleasures! All worldly things - including the desire for liberation - are obstacles to which you are attached. If you want divine peace, leave behind ignorant karma.''&lt;ref name=RadheShyam/&gt; He explained that God's name is the most powerful sound of the Creation – "more powerful than a thousand atomic and hydrogen bombs."&lt;ref&gt;The Teachings of Babaji, 26 December 1982&lt;/ref&gt;  – and that this is the only real thing.

Haidakhan Babaji especially recommended the use of the [[mantra]] "[[ॐ]] namaḥ śivāy" ([[Sanskrit]]: ॐ नमः शिवाय् )&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ginakim.net/graphics/OmNamahShivai_Babaji_45pc.gif&lt;/ref&gt; - while "ॐ" is mostly [[IAST|transliterated]] as "oṃ" or "auṃ") - because of its protective qualities,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. "Chant OM NAMAH SHIVAY and you can defy death." The Teachings of Babaji, 28 July 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; but also stated that one can use any God's name "his religion teaches."&lt;ref&gt;Gaura Devi. (1990). Babaji's Teachings. P.6.&lt;/ref&gt; The mantra is always written internationally simplified as "Om Namah Shivay" in books about Babaji written in [[English language|English]] or other languages.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Gabriele Wosien: ''Ich bin Du - Botschaften des Meisters vom Himalaya'', G. Reichel Verlag, {{ISBN|3-926388-23-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:OmNamahShivai Babaji 45pc.gif|right|thumb]] --&gt;

Haidakhan Babaji warned his followers about the forthcoming Great Revolution or Maha Kranti. He described Maha Kranti as involving "earthquakes, floods, accidents, collisions and wars (...)."&lt;ref&gt;The Teachings of Babaji, 26 July 1979&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of these upcoming calamities, he called for courage: “Walk on with courage and bravery. Go on working to improve humankind and establish the Path of Truth. (…) Fight for truth! To face life you must have great courage every day.”&lt;ref&gt;The Teachings of Babaji, 16 January 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Haidakhan Babaji urged his followers to be "inspired." He stated: "Everything in this world is 'PHURO' – transient. It has no reality. True reality is to proceed on the path of truth, to keep the company of saintly people, and to render service to men."&lt;ref&gt;The Teachings of Babaji, 31 August 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

Babaji advocated on behalf of the less-fortunate. He stated: "you should look to the areas of your countries where people are poverty-stricken and helpless and then do all you can to raise their standard of living, teaching them cleanliness and high morals. To serve the needy truly and from the heart is true service to God. (...)"&lt;ref&gt;The Teachings of Babaji, 20 April 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spiritual routine ==

Babaji would typically start his day around 3:00&amp;nbsp;am, with a bath, often in cold Gautama Ganga, which was followed by meditation or a fire ceremony. Around 5:00&amp;nbsp;am he would see his devotees for ceremonial chandan (placing a mark on forehead), followed by morning [[Aarti]]  (devotional singing) around 6:00&amp;nbsp;am Then until noon everybody would be engaged in some form of karma yoga. At noon the only meal of the day was being served, followed by more karma yoga in the afternoon. Sometimes a more elaborate ceremony such as [[havan]] would be performed around the noon time. Havan is a fire ceremony. &lt;ref&gt;http://sanskrit.org/the-fire-ritual-havanhoma/&lt;/ref&gt; In the afternoon, Babaji would sometimes see the devotees for individual audiences, known as [[Darśana|darshan]]. Then there would be another bath, followed by the evening Aarti. After the evening Aarti, Babaji was giving short speeches that were recorded in "The Teachings of Babaji."&lt;ref&gt;For more description of daily routines around Babaji see also Gaura Devi (2001), for instance PP.63–67, 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identity ==
Haidakhan Babaji was often asked who he was. He made the following assertions about himself:

Old Hairakhan Baba – as mentioned above Haidakhan Babaji maintained that he was identical with [[Hairakhan Baba]] (also spelled as Hariakhan or Heriakhan) who lived around Hairakhan in the years 1860–1922.&lt;ref&gt;The Teachings of Babaji, Foreword. See also Radhe Shyam. (1990). PP.50–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahavatar Babaji  – it appears that Haidakhan Babaji pointed out or implied a few times that he was identical with [[Mahavatar Babaji]] described in Yogandanda's "Autobiography of a Yogi."&lt;ref&gt;The Teachings of Babaji, Foreword.&lt;/ref&gt;  This claim is apparently disputed by the [[Self-Realization Fellowship]], the society founded by [[Paramahansa Yogananda]].&lt;ref name="RadheShyam"&gt;Radhe Shyam. (1990). P.xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; The practices of these latter differ. Those by Baba Haidakhan were much simpler and did not involve any secret ceremony.

Messenger – Haidakhan Babaji would sometimes refer to himself as "messenger of revolution”&lt;ref name="RadheShyam" /&gt;  He often urged the followers to "spread his Message."&lt;ref&gt;The Teachings of Babaji, e.g. 14 September 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Mahaprabhuji – on one occasion Babaji stated: "I am Bhole Baba (Simple Father). I am nobody and nothing. I am only like a mirror in which you can see yourself. I am like a fire. Don’t keep too far away or you will not get warmth. But don’t get too near or you may burn yourself. Learn the right distance. My name is Maha Prabhuji (The Great God)."&lt;ref&gt;Gaura Devi. (1990). Babaji’s Teachings. P.7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Vishnu Dutt Shastriji said the following about Mahaprabhuji: "Sitting here at Haidakhan, Mahaprabhuji has control over every particle of the Creation by the power of His mere wish, by His very thought. (...) Mahaprabhuji has control over the elements, the spiritual world – to say nothing of the world of men. He is the Creator, Sustainer and Destroyer of the world. Not a single blade of grass can grow but that He wills it. He has incarnated in a human body for the welfare of mankind. His sole desire – is to make it possible for the whole world to be liberated. He shall do His utmost to achieve liberation of the world."
 
The Guru of all Gurus – Gaura Devi recorded Babaji saying: "I am no one’s Guru, but I am the Guru of gurus."&lt;ref&gt;Gaura Devi. (1990). Babaji’s Teachings. P.9.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
I am everywhere – Haidakhan Babaji was recorded saying: "I am everywhere – in your every breath. I have come to help you realize unity beyond division. I will show you a freedom you have not imagined. You must seek that unity from whence there is awareness that we are all one. Seek harmony in all that you do. I am harmony. If you are in peace, I am in peace. If you are troubled, I am troubled. If you are happy, I am happy. Be happy. Have faith – everything depends on faith."&lt;ref&gt;Babaji Mahavatar. "The descent of Eternity into time." (1983). Back cover. See also: The Teachings of Babaji, 12 April 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bill Cosby routine ===
{{main|Bill Cosby sexual assault cases}}
On October 16, 2014, at the Philadelphia club [[Trocadero Theatre|The Trocadero]], Buress was recorded doing an extended routine about [[Bill Cosby sexual assault allegations|existing rape allegations against comedian Bill Cosby]].&lt;ref name=Sarkis &gt;{{cite web|last=Sarkis |first=Christian |url=http://www.phillymag.com/ticket/2014/09/29/photos-aziz-ansari-questions-digital-age-reads-audience-texts-wells-fargo-center-friday-night/ |title=Photos: Aziz Ansari Wells Fargo Center &amp;#124; Ticket |publisher=Phillymag.com |date=September 29, 2014 |accessdate=October 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buress addressed Cosby's legacy of "talk[ing] down" to young black men about their style of dress and lifestyle. Buress criticized the actor's public moralizing by saying, "Yeah, but you raped women, Bill Cosby, so that kind of brings you down a couple notches." The audience appeared to respond to Buress's accusation with incredulity; he encouraged everyone to search for "Bill Cosby rape" when they got home.&lt;ref name=PhillyMagBuressRoutineVideo &gt;{{cite web| last1= McQuade| first1= Dan| title=Hannibal Buress on Bill Cosby: You're a Rapist|url=http://www.phillymag.com/ticket/2014/10/17/hannibal-buress-bill-cosby-rapist/| website= Phillymag.com| publisher= Philadelphia Magazine|accessdate=April 24, 2015|date=October 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buress had been doing the same Cosby routine for the previous six months with little response,&lt;ref name=cbs_buress&gt;{{cite news|title=Who is Hannibal Buress, and why did he call Bill Cosby a "rapist"?|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/who-is-hannibal-buress-and-why-did-he-call-bill-cosby-a-rapist/|accessdate=September 30, 2015|work=CBS News|date=November 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the October performance went viral after being posted on ''[[Philadelphia (magazine)|Philadelphia]]'' magazine's website.&lt;ref name=VultureTimelineOfAccusations&gt;{{cite web|first1= Matt |last1= Giles |first2= Nate |last2= Jones|title=A Timeline of the Abuse Charges Against Bill Cosby [Updated]|url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/09/timeline-of-the-abuse-charges-against-cosby.html| website= Vulture.com| publisher=''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' |accessdate=April 24, 2015|date=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimesReBuressRole&gt;{{cite news|last1=Braxton|first1=Greg|title=Comic Hannibal Buress is low-key on his role in Bill Cosby firestorm|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-hannibal-buress-20141124-story.html#page=1|website=Latimes.com|publisher=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=April 24, 2015|date=November 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[media circus|media firestorm]] ensued, with numerous publications tackling the question of how Cosby had managed to maintain, as Buress called it in his set, a "Teflon image" despite more than a decade of public sex-abuse accusations.&lt;ref name=nbc_cosby_why&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Are Old Assault Claims Against Bill Cosby Back?|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/celebrity/why-are-old-assault-claims-against-bill-cosby-back-n250161|accessdate=September 30, 2015|work=CBS News|date=November 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="accusertable_bowman"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill Cosby raped me.

Comedian [[Eddie Murphy]] later referenced Buress's role in the allegations coming to light while impersonating Cosby during his 2015 [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]] acceptance speech, mockingly playing Cosby as threatening Buress' life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/eddie-murphy-bill-cosby-impression-jokes-mark-twain-prize-1201621111/|title=Eddie Murphy Impersonates Bill Cosby While Accepting Mark Twain Prize|last=Harris|first=Paul|date=2015-10-19|work=Variety|access-date=2018-05-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After living in [[New York City]], Buress moved back to Chicago in 2017 and settled in its [[Wicker Park, Chicago|Wicker Park]] neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/in-baywatch-chicago-comedian-hannibal-buress-keeps-his-shirt-on/ |title=In 'Baywatch,' Chicago comedian Hannibal Buress keeps his shirt on|work=suntimes.com |date=May 22, 2017 |accessdate=June 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I go into this bar to get a phone charger for an Uber. He follows me into the bar, and told me I'm too drunk to go inside. [...] 'If I can't be on the street, where do you want me to be?' I ask him.

'''The International Panel of Parliamentarians for Freedom of Religion or Belief (IPPFoRB)''' is a network of parliamentarians from around the world committed to combating religious persecution and advancing freedom of religion or belief, as defined by Article 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ippforb.com|title=The IPPFoRB's website|last=|first=|date=|website=ippforb.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
IPPFoRB was established on 8 November 2014 with the signing of the Oslo Charter for Freedom of Religion or Belief at the [[Nobel Peace Center]] in [[Oslo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldreligionnews.com/issues/30-parliamentarians-meet-oslo-sign-freedom-religion-charter|title=30 Parliamentarians Meet with USCIRF in Oslo to Sign a Freedom of Religion Charter|last=|first=|date=2014-11-13|work=World Religion News|access-date=2017-08-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first steering committee of the IPPFoRB was composed of Baroness [[Elizabeth Berridge, Baroness Berridge|Elizabeth Berridge]] (UK [[House of Lords]]), [[David Anderson (Saskatchewan politician)|David Anderson]] ([[House of Commons of Canada]]), [[Abid Raja]] ([[Parliament of Norway]]), [[Aykan Erdemir]] ([[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]]), Leonardo Quintao ([[National Congress of Brazil]]).

== Activities ==

In September 2015, IPPFoRB convened&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldwatchmonitor.org/2015/09/religious-freedom-network-should-be-as-outspoken-and-organized-as-the-extremists/|title=Religious freedom network should be as 'outspoken and organized' as the extremists|last=|first=|date=2015-09-22|work=World Watch Monitor|access-date=2017-08-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 100 parliamentarians from 50 countries in [[New York City|New York]], alongside the [[United Nations General Assembly]], and issued the New York Resolution for Freedom of Religion or Belief to "enhance global cooperation by working across geographical, political, and religious lines."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ippforb.com/new-york-resolution/|title=New York Resolution for Freedom of Religion or Belief|last=|first=|date=|website=IPPFoRB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the New York meeting, IPPFoRB founder Aykan Erdemir stated that this global network is "idea for which the time is right," adding that people advocating rights should be as "outspoken, organised and transnational" as the violent extremists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldwatchmonitor.org/2015/09/religious-freedom-network-should-be-as-outspoken-and-organized-as-the-extremists/|title=Religious freedom network should be as 'outspoken and organised' as the extremists|last=|first=|date=September 22, 2015|work=World Watch Monitor|access-date=December 15, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, IPPFoRB assembled 100 parliamentarians from 60 countries in [[Berlin]] with the attendance of German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldwatchmonitor.org/2016/09/freedom-of-religion-or-belief-the-defining-issue-of-our-time/|title=Freedom of religion or belief 'the defining issue of our time'|last=|first=|date=|work=World Watch Monitor|access-date=2017-08-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, IPPFoRB parliamentarians have written advocacy letters to heads of state of Burma, Eritrea, Indonesia, Iran, North Korea, Pakistan, Sudan, and Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/religious-rights/305900-legislators-abroad-unite-for-religious-freedom|title=Legislators abroad unite for religious freedom|last=|first=|date=2016-11-14|work=The Hill|access-date=2017-08-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IPPFoRB steering committee members have received awards in recognition of their efforts: Aykan Erdemir was awarded the [[Stefanus Prize]] by the [[Stefanus Alliance International]] in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stefanus.no/no/nyheter/norge/2016/Stefanusprisen+2016.b7C_wlLQ2N.ips|title=Stefanusprisen 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=The Stefanus Alliance International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Baroness Elizabeth Berridge is the recipient of the 2017 International Religious Liberty Award of the [[International Center for Law and Religion Studies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iclrs.org/index.php?pageId=1&amp;contentId=1&amp;blurbId=86128|title=Baroness Elizabeth Berridge Receives 2017 International Religious Liberty Award|last=|first=|date=|website=International Center for Law and Religion Studies|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Abid Raja]] was named the 2018 recipient of the [[International Religious Liberty Association]]'s International Award for Outstanding Leadership in Religious Freedom Advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irla.org/norwegian-parliamentarian|title=Norwegian Parliamentarian to be Recognized for Global Efforts to Promote Freedom of Religion or Belief|last=|first=|date=|website=The International Religious Liberty Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to [[Napoleon]]'s [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|invasion]] in 1798, almost all of Egypt's educational, legal, public health, and social welfare issues were in the hands of religious functionaries. [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule reinforced the public and political roles of the [[ulama]] (religious scholars), as [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] rule had done before the Ottomans, because [[Islam]] was the state religion and because political divisions in the country were based on religious divisions.&lt;ref name="georgetown1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/egypt |title=Egypt |work= |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |date= |accessdate=2011-12-14}} See drop-down essay on "Islamic Conquest and the Ottoman Empire"&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th and 20th centuries, successive governments made extensive efforts to limit the role of the ulama in public life and to bring religious institutions under closer state control.

{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}

After the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]], the government assumed responsibility for appointing officials to [[mosque]]s and religious schools. The government mandated reform of [[Al-Azhar University]] beginning in 1961. These reforms permitted department heads to be drawn from outside the ranks of the traditionally trained orthodox ulama.

==History==
{{Religion in Egypt}}
In the late 10th century, the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Ismailism|Ismaili]] caliphate of the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]] made Egypt their center and Cairo their capital. Egypt flourished and the Fatimids developed an extensive trade network in both the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Indian Ocean]]. Their trade and diplomatic ties extended all the way to [[China]] and its [[Song Dynasty]], which eventually determined the economic course of Egypt during the [[High Middle Ages]]. Many traces of [[Fatimid architecture]] exist in Cairo today, the most defining examples include the [[Al Azhar University]] and the [[Al-Hakim Mosque|Al Hakim mosque]]. The Fatimid palace in Cairo had two parts. It stood in the [[Khan el-Khalili]] area at Bin El-Qasryn street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldroads.org/pastblogs/pastsingles2007/Cairo_of_the_mind.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212005349/http://www.oldroads.org/pastblogs/pastsingles2007/Cairo_of_the_mind.htm |archivedate=12 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, Egyptian Islam was a complex and diverse religion. Although Muslims agreed on the faith's basic tenets, the country's various social groups and classes applied Islam differently in their daily lives. The literate theologians of [[Al-Azhar University]] generally rejected the version of Islam practiced by illiterate religious preachers and peasants in the countryside. Most upper- and upper-middle-class Muslims believed either that religious expression was a private matter for each individual or that Islam should play a more dominant role in public life. Islamic religious revival movements, whose appeal cut across class lines, were present in most cities and in many villages.&lt;ref name=countrystudies&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/egypt/68.htm country studies Egypt Contemporary Islam]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam and state===
[[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]],  who assumed power in Egypt in the early 1800s, nationalized all land, including hundreds of thousands of hectares of land belonging to Al Azhar Mosque, putting the funding of that institution under state control.&lt;ref name=Hessler/&gt; This put an end to the political independence of the Ulama.&lt;ref name=Farah&gt;{{cite book|last=Farah|first=Nadia Ramsis|title=Egypt's Political Economy: Power Relations in Development|publisher=American University in Cairo Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WrjUP56XGOwC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;lpg=PA99&amp;dq=muhammad+ali+independence+of+ulama&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=16ZHPyEM2p&amp;sig=FzsXg1hxtHsMPmgFaKafc3mQ7_0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rk99UvH9G8ewyQHDlYGwDw&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=muhammad%20ali%20independence%20of%20ulama&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Waqf|Awqaf]], traditionally independent endowments for mosques and Islamic schools, became a ministry of the government. In 1961, [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] made Al Azhar part of the [[Ministry of Awqaf (Egypt)|Ministry of Awqaf]] or Religious Endowments.  He also made the appointment of the grand sheikh the prerogative of the Egyptian president, just as the appointment of any other state official.&lt;ref name=Morsy&gt;{{cite web|last=Morsy|first=Ahmed|title=Egypt’s al-Azhar Steps Forward|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/2013/11/07/egypt-s-al-azhar-steps-forward/gt0b|work=November 7, 2013|publisher=carnegie endowment for international peace|accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In time the school became responsible for assigning imams to all major mosques, and all these imams were required to be graduates of the school.&lt;ref name=Hessler/&gt;

===Ulama===
Orthodox ulama or "the religious establishment" found themselves in a difficult position during the wave of Islamic activism that swept through Egypt in the 1970s and 1980s. Most Ulama, including those of [[Al-Azhar University]], are employees of the Egyptian state who "recognize the regime’s primacy, support its stability, and legitimize its policies".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.currenttrends.org/docLib/20061226_UlamaandRadicalismfinal.pdf Establishment Ulama and Radical Islam in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420212045/http://www.currenttrends.org/docLib/20061226_UlamaandRadicalismfinal.pdf |date=20 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Radical Islamists viewed them as puppets of the status quo. To maintain their influence in the country, the ulama espoused more conservative stances. After 1974, for example, many [[Al-Azhar Mosque|al-Azhar]] ulama, who had acquiesced to family planning initiatives in the 1960s, openly criticized government efforts at population control. The ulama also supported moves to reform the country's legal code to conform to Islamic teaching. They remained, nonetheless, comparatively moderate; they were largely loyal to the government and condemned the violence of radical Islamist groups. Outside of the state-mosques are more than 40,000 independent mosques throughout Egypt.&lt;ref name="Osman.p105"/&gt;

==Beliefs==

===Contemporary belief===

Egyptian Muslims believe that Islam defines one's relationship to God, to other Muslims, and to non-Muslims. Some devout Muslims believe that there can be no dichotomy between the sacred and the secular. Many Muslims say that Egypt's governments have been secularist and even anti-religious since the early 1920s.&lt;ref name=countrystudies/&gt; Politically organized Muslims who seek to purge the country of its secular policies are referred to as "[[Islamists]]."

Egypt's largely uneducated urban and rural lower classes are intensely devoted to Islam, but they usually lack a thorough knowledge of the religion. Even village religious leaders usually have only a rudimentary knowledge of Islam. The typical village imam or prayer leader has at most a few years of schooling; his scholarly work was limited to reading prayers and sermons prepared by others and to learning passages from the [[Qur'an]]. Popular religion include a variety of unorthodox practices, such as veneration of saints, recourse to charms and amulets, and belief in the influence of evil spirits.&lt;ref name=countrystudies/&gt;
[[File:Masjid Hamza in Suez, Egypt.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Masjid [[Hamza ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib|Hamza]] in Suez, Egypt]]

Popular Islam is based mostly on oral tradition. Imams with virtually no formal education commonly memorize the entire Qur'an and recite appropriate verses on religious occasions. They also tell religious stories at village festivals and commemorations marking an individual's rites of passage. Predestination plays an important role in popular Islam.&lt;ref name=countrystudies/&gt; This concept includes the belief that everything that happens in life is the will of God and the belief that trying to avoid misfortune is useless and invites worse affliction. Revelations from God in the [[Qur'an]] form the basis of [[Monotheism]] merged with a belief in [[Islamic view of angels|angels]], and [[jinns]] (spirits).

Popular Islam ranges from informal prayer sessions or Qur'an study to organized cults or orders. Because of the pervasive sexual [[Sex segregation|segregation]] of Egypt's Islamic society, men and women often practice their religion in different ways. A specifically female religious custom is the [[Zār]], a ceremony for helping women placate spirits who are believed to have possessed them. Women specially trained by their mothers or other women in zar lore organize the ceremonies. A zar organizer holds weekly meetings and employs music and dance to induce ecstatic trances in possessed women. Wealthy women sometimes pay to have private zars conducted in their homes; these zars are more elaborate than public ones, last for several days, and sometimes involve efforts to exorcise spirits.  However, while once common, the zar is rarely practiced today, under fire for its perception as a religious heresy.&lt;ref name=countrystudies/&gt;

There are more than 45 million citizens 35 years old or younger. The Influence of digital/youth culture is found in preachers such as the very popular [[Amr Khaled]] who "maintains a disciplined focus on the lives, issues and problems of the upper middle classes"; espouses `living a comfortable life`; talks to youth about `getting closer to God` without changing one's lifestyle; promotes [[hijab]] while "joking about dating and flirting".&lt;ref name=Osman.p105&gt;Osman, Tarek, ''Egypt on the brink'', 2010, p.105&lt;/ref&gt;  The young `sheikhs` deliver their sermons over the Internet, on private satellite channels and in sports clubs, away from the control of Al-Azhar and the state.&lt;ref name=Osman.p105/&gt;

===Sufism===
A primarily male spiritual manifestation of Islam is [[Sufism]], an Islamic mystical tradition.  It has been called the "default setting" of Muslim religious life in Egypt&lt;ref name=Deasy/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Sufism has become the “default setting” for Muslim life in Egypt, in the words of a recent Carnegie Endowment report".[http://carnegieendowment.org/files/salafis_sufis.pdf Salafis and Sufis in Egypt]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Jonathan|title=Salafis and Sufis in Egypt|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/files/salafis_sufis.pdf|work=December 2011|publisher=Carnegie Papers|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; although many Sufis are thought to have voted for the Muslim Brotherhood [[Freedom and Justice Party (Egypt)|Freedom and Justice Party]].&lt;ref name=battle/&gt;

Sufism exists in a number of forms, most of which represent an original ''[[tariqah|tarika]]'' ("path") developed by an inspired founder, or sheikh. These sheikhs gradually gathered about themselves [[murid]]s, or disciples, whom they initiated into the tarika. Gradually the murids formed orders, also known as turuq, which were loyal to the Sheikh or his successors (also called sheikhs).  In Egypt there are 74 Sufi orders (tarikas), each headed by its own sheikh. Overseeing them is the Supreme Council for Sufi Orders and the president of Egypt is directly in charge of Sufi affairs.&lt;ref name=ibrahim&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/may/10/islam-sufi-salafi-egypt-religion Salafi intolerance threatens Sufis]| Baher Ibrahim| guardian.co.uk| 10 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The devotions of many Sufi orders center on various forms of the [[dhikr]], a ceremony at which music, body movements, and chants induce a state of ecstatic trance in the disciples. Since the early 1970s, there has been a revival of interest in Sufism. Egypt's contemporary Sufis tend to be young, college-educated men in professional careers.&lt;ref name=countrystudies/&gt;

Estimates of the number of Sufis in Egypt include at least a third of the adult male Muslim population in Egypt, (six million men) being members of a Sufi order; fifteen million of the country’s roughly 80 million citizens "claim" Sufism "as a practice",&lt;ref name=Deasy&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/article/sufis%E2%80%99-choice-egypt%E2%80%99s-political-wild-card|last=Deasy|first=Kristin|title=The Sufis’ Choice: Egypt’s Political Wild Card|journal=World Affairs|date=September–October 2012|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; still another says while 15 million are registered as Sufis, "the true figure is likely to be higher".&lt;ref name=battle&gt;{{cite news|last=Hill|first=Jess|title=The Battle for Egyptian Islam|url=http://www.theglobalmail.org/feature/the-battle-for-egyptian-islam/34/|accessdate=26 April 2013|newspaper=Global Mail|date=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participation at the festivals ([[Mawlid|moulids]]) the Sufi orders organize, is perhaps twice that (and includes women and children).&lt;ref name=Bradley.p.85&gt;Bradley, John R., ''Inside Egypt: The Land of the Pharaohs on the Brink of a Revolution'' by John R. Bradley, Palgrave MaacMillan, 2008, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; The moulids are a major manifestation of Sufi Islam in Egypt, and are held in honor of holy men and women. (In Egypt the term Moulid is not reserved for Muslim festivals and may be in honor of Christian, and until recently Jewish holy men).  Sufi Muslim moulids not only venerate the prophet [[Muhammad]] and his descendants (such as [[Hussein]], the second son of the fourth Caliph Ali whose moulid in Cairo can draws crowds of more than a million people), but founders of Sufi orders, down to dozens of lesser-known sheikhs celebrated mostly in remote rural communities. The largest moulid in Egypt takes place in [[Tanta]], the largest city in the [[Nile Delta]], and draws an even larger number of pilgrims than [[hajj]] in Mecca. As many as three million Egyptians and other Arabs gather there every October to celebrate the life of Sayid [[Ahmad al-Badawi]], a thirteenth-century Sufi leader.&lt;ref name=Bradley.p.85/&gt; According to the Egyptian Ministry of Awqaf (Islamic charity), there are officially more than forty such annual commemorations, and the Sufi Council in Egypt lists eighty other festivals for lesser-known founders of Sufi orders.&lt;ref name=Bradley.p.85/&gt;

According to a report issued by the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Egypt’s Islamic religious establishment is strongly Sufi in character. Adherence to a Sufi order has long been standard for both professors and students in the [[Al-Azhar Mosque|al-Azhar mosque]] and [[Al-Azhar University|university system]]. Although al-Azhar is not monolithic, its identity has been strongly associated with Sufism. 
The current [[Grand Imam of al-Azhar|Shaykh al-Azhar]] (rector of the school), [[Ahmed el-Tayeb]], is a hereditary Sufi shaykh from Upper Egypt who has recently expressed his support for the formation of a world Sufi league;  the current Grand Mufti of Egypt and senior al-Azhar scholar [[Ali Gomaa]] is also a highly respected Sufi master.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Salafi===
An estimated 5-6 million Egyptians are Salafis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/78013,news-comment,news-politics,what-is-salafism-and-should-we-be-worried What is Salafism and should we be worried?| First Post]| by Venetia Rainey| LAST UPDATED APRIL 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Tarek Osman describes [[Salafi]]s before the 2011 revolution as the "most important or pervasive Islamic force in the country" with an influence "many times more than that of organized political Islam." With "no history of violence, no organizational structure, no manifestos and no obvious political ambitions", they were tolerated by the Mubarak regime and ignored by the news media.&lt;ref name=Osman.p221&gt;''Egypt on the Brink'' by Tarek Osman, Yale University Press, 2010, p.221&lt;/ref&gt;  The Salafi movement benefited from government support the 1990s when the government hoped to "combat and undermine" the violence of the Jihadi Salafi [[al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]] with the preaching of the apolitical Salafis.&lt;ref name=battle/&gt; It has also benefited from some of the $70 billion spent by Saudi Arabia to promote "Wahhabi" ideology worldwide through mosques, schools and books, that is similar or "virtually identical to Salafi beliefs and with which Sufis have had difficulty competing."&lt;ref name=battle/&gt;

During the [[Mubarak era]] most Salafis considered participation in politics to be "religiously forbidden", however since then Salafis have shown themselves to be not only tolerant of political participation but very adept. In the [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2011–2012|2011–12 Egypt parliamentary elections]], the [[Islamist Bloc]] led by salafi [[Al-Nour Party]] received 27.8% of votes cast or 127 of the 498 parliamentary seats contested,&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;[http://carnegieendowment.org/2011/12/20/salafis-and-sufis-in-egypt/8fj4 Salafis and Sufis in Egypt] Jonathan Brown| Carnegie Paper|December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; second-place after the Muslim Brotherhood's [[Freedom and Justice Party (Egypt)|Freedom and Justice Party]]. Al‑Nour party itself won 111 of the 127 seats.

===Nondenominational Muslims===
There are a significant amount of [[Nondenominational Muslims]] in Egypt. Roughly twelve percent of Egyptians, when asked about their religious affiliation, answered that they were "just a Muslim" or "just Muslim". Their lack of identifying with a particular sect was noteworthy.&lt;ref&gt;"Chapter 1: Religious Affiliation". The World’s Muslims: Unity and Diversity.

==State involvement==

In the wake of the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état|2013 coup]] the state imposed tighter controls on mosques. 
The Awqaf Ministry command the mosques be locked between prayer times and took control of donation boxes.&lt;ref name=Hessler/&gt; In September 2013 it declared that only imams who had graduated from Al Azhar University (estimated at 58,000) would be allowed to hold Friday sermons.&lt;ref name=Symank/&gt; This effectively banned an estimated 53,000 imams from preaching in mosques,&lt;ref name=Symank/&gt; although it is not clear if this edict can be enforced.&lt;ref name=Hessler/&gt; In 2015, the Egyptian Ministry of Religious Endowments initiated a campaign to remove any books authored by Salafi scholars from all mosques in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muslimvillage.com/2015/06/28/83307/egypt-bans-salafi-books-from-mosques/ Muslim Village: "Egypt bans Salafi books from mosques" by ABU HUDHAYFAH] June 28, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have complained that the actions of Awqaf reflect the government that controls them. [[Mahmoud Zakzouk]],  minister of Awqaf from 1995 to the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011]], was appointed by [[History of Egypt under Hosni Mubarak|Mubarak]] and dismissed at his overthrow.

==Islamic political movements==
[[File:Al Azhar1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Al-Azhar Mosque in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]].]]
Islamic political activism has a lengthy history in Egypt. Several Islamic political groups started soon after [[World War I]] ended. The most well-known Islamic political organization is the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] (Al Ikhwan al Muslimun, also known as the Brotherhood), founded in 1928 by [[Hassan al Banna]]. After [[World War II]], the Muslim Brotherhood acquired a reputation as a radical group prepared to use violence to achieve its religious goals. The group was implicated in several assassinations, including the murder of one prime minister. The Brotherhood had contacts with the Free Officers before the 1952 Revolution and supported most of their initial policies. The Brotherhood, however, soon came into conflict with [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]].&lt;ref name="georgetown2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/egypt |title=Egypt |work= |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |date= |accessdate=2011-12-14}} See drop-down essay on "Colonialism and the Rise of Egyptian Nationalism"&lt;/ref&gt; The government accused the Brotherhood of complicity in an alleged 1954 plot to assassinate the president and imprisoned many of the group's leaders. In the 1970s, [[Anwar Sadat]] amnestied the leaders and permitted them to resume some of their activities. But by that time, the Brotherhood was divided into at least three factions. The more militant faction was committed to a policy of political opposition to the government. A second faction advocated peaceful withdrawal from society and the creation, to the extent possible, of a separate, [[parallel society]] based upon Islamic values and law. The dominant moderate group advocated cooperation with the regime.&lt;ref name=Metz&gt;[http://www.higginsctc.org/terrorism/Egypt%20-%20Islamic%20Political%20Movements.htm Islamic Political Movements]. from Helen Chapin Metz, ed. ''Egypt: A Country Study''. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Muslim Brotherhood's reemergence as a political force coincided with the proliferation of Islamic groups. Some of these groups espoused the violent overthrow of the government while others espoused living a devout life of rigorous observance of religious practices. It is impossible to list all the Islamic groups that emerged in the late 1970s because many of them had diffuse structures and some of the more militant groups were underground. Egypt's defeat and loss of territory in the June 1967 [[Six-Day War]] was the main cause for the growth of religiously inspired political activism.&lt;ref name="georgetown3"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/egypt |title=Egypt |work= |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |date= |accessdate=2011-12-14}} See drop-down essay on "Rise of Islamic Activism"&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims tended to view the humiliating experience as the culmination of 150 years of foreign intrusion and an affront to their vision of a true Islamic community. Islamic tradition rejected the idea of non-Muslims dominating Muslim society. Such a state of affairs discredited Muslim rulers who permitted it to persist. It was, therefore, incumbent on believers to end the domination and restore the true supremacy of Islam. As part of their Sunni creed, the most radical activists adopted [[jihad]] and committed themselves to battling unbelievers and impious Muslims. During the 1970s and 1980s, [[Islamist]]s perpetrated a number of violent acts, including the assassination of [[Anwar Sadat]] in October 1981.&lt;ref name=Metz/&gt;

Disruptive social changes and Sadat's relative tolerance toward political parties contributed to the rapid growth of Islamic groups in the 1970s. On university campuses, for example, Sadat initially viewed the rise of Islamic associations ([[Gama'at Islamiya]]) as a counterbalance to leftist influence among students. The Gama'at Islamiya spread quite rapidly on campuses and won up to one-third of all student union elections. These victories provided a platform from which the associations campaigned for Islamic dress, the veiling of women, and the [[Sex segregation|segregation]] of classes by gender. [[Secular]] university administrators opposed these goals. In 1979 Sadat sought to diminish the influence of the associations through a law that transferred most of the authority of the student unions to professors and administrators. During the 1980s, however, Islamists gradually penetrated college faculties. At [[Asyut University]], which was the scene of some of the most intense clashes between Islamists and their opponents (including security forces, secularists, and [[Copts]]), the president and other top administrators—who were Islamists—supported Gama'at Islamiya demands to end mixed-sex classes and to reduce total female enrollment.&lt;ref name=Metz/&gt; Public opinion in Egypt supported political Islam to some extent, one poll in the mid-1980s found 96% of Egyptian Muslims favoring the application of the [[Sharia]].&lt;ref&gt;poll by the "National Center for SOcial and Criminal Research" quoted in Robin, Wright, ''Sacred Rage'', p.188-9&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|1989}}, the Islamists sought to make Egypt a community of the faithful based on their vision of an Islamic social order. They rejected conventional, secularist social analyses of Egypt's socioeconomic problems. They maintained, for example, that the causes of poverty were not overpopulation or high defense expenditures but the populace's spiritual failures—laxness, secularism, and corruption. The solution was a return to the simplicity, hard work, and self-reliance of earlier Muslim life. The Islamists created their own alternative network of social and economic institutions through which members could work, study, and receive medical treatment in an Islamic environment.&lt;ref name=Metz/&gt;

Islamists rejected [[Marxism]] and Western [[capitalism]]. Indeed, they viewed [[atheistic]] [[communism]], [[Jewish]] [[Zionism]], and Western "Crusader-minded" Christianity as their main enemies, which were responsible for the decadence that led to foreign domination and defeat by Zionists. They were intolerant of people who did not share their worldview. Islamists tended to be hostile toward the orthodox ulama, especially the scholars at Al Azhar who frequently criticized the Islamists' extreme religious interpretations. Islamists believed that the established social and political order had tainted the ulama, who had come to represent stumbling blocks to the new Islamic order. In addition, Islamists condemned the orthodox as "pulpit parrots" committed to a formalist practice of Islam but not to its spirit.&lt;ref name=Metz/&gt;

The social origins of Islamists changed after the 1952 Revolution. In the 1940s and early 1950s, the Muslim Brotherhood had appealed primarily to urban civil servants and white and blue-collar workers. After the early 1970s, the Islamic revival attracted followers from a broad spectrum of social classes. Most activists were university students or recent graduates; they included rural-urban migrants and urban middle-class youth whose fathers were middle-level government employees or professionals. Their fields of study—medicine, engineering, military science, and pharmacy—were among the most highly competitive and prestigious disciplines in the university system. The rank-and- file members of Islamist groups have come from the middle class, the lower-middle class, and the urban working class.&lt;ref name=Metz/&gt;

Various Islamist groups espoused different means for achieving their political agenda. All Islamists, however, were concerned with Islam's role in the complex and changing society of Egypt in the late twentieth century. A common focus of their political efforts has been to incorporate the [[Shari'a]] into the country's legal code. In deference to their increasing influence, the Ministry of Justice in 1977 published a draft law making [[apostasy]] by a Muslim a capital offense and proposing traditional Islamic punishments for crimes, such as stoning for adultery and amputation of a hand for theft. In 1980 Egypt supported a referendum that proposed a constitutional amendment to make the Shari'a "the sole source of law." The influence of the Islamists temporarily waned in the aftermath of Sadat's assassination in 1981, but the election of nine members of the Muslim Brotherhood to the People's Assembly in 1984 revived Islamists' prospects. In 1985 the People's Assembly voted to initiate a procedure for the gradual application of the Shari'a, beginning with an indefinite education period to prepare the population for the legal changes; the next step would be to amend all existing laws to exclude any provisions that conflict with the Shari'a. Moves to reform the legal code received support from many Muslims who wanted to purify society and reject Western legal codes forced on Egypt in the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref name=Metz/&gt; As of 2009, the [[Grand Mufti]] also has another title, Dar al-Iftaa, a part of the Ministry of Justice. While his rulings are nonbinding, they are "influential." His office issues 5,000 [[fatwa]]s a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/22/AR2009102203800.html |title=The Grand Mufti's mission |accessdate= |author=Michael Gerson |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2009-10-23 |work= |publisher=Washington Post |pages=27A |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---probably was before 2009, but don't have start date nor cite---&gt;

By the beginning of the 21st century, only the Gama'at Islamiya leaders who were in prison after the assassination of Sadat were released after several books they wrote and interviews showed that they revised their points of view and changed the radical tone of their speeches.&lt;ref name=Metz/&gt;

==Status of religious freedom==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}

[[File:Cairo mosques.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Historical and ancient mosques in [[Cairo]].]]
The Constitution provides for freedom of belief and the practice of religion; however, the Government places restrictions on this right. According to the Constitution, Islam is the official state religion, and [[Shari'a]] is the primary source of legislation; religious practices that conflict with the official interpretation of Shari'a are prohibited. However, since the Government does not consider the practice of Christianity or Judaism to conflict with Shari'a, for the most part members of the non-Muslim minority worship without legal harassment and may maintain links with coreligionists in other countries. Members of other religions that are not recognized by the Government, such as the [[Bahá'í Faith]], may experience personal and collective hardship.

An 1856 [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] decree still in force requires non-Muslims to obtain a presidential decree to build a place of worship. In addition Interior Ministry regulations issued in 1934 specify a set of 10 conditions that the Government must consider prior to issuance of a presidential decree permitting construction of a church. These conditions include the location of the proposed site, the religious composition of the surrounding community, and the proximity of other churches. The Ottoman decree also requires the President to approve permits for the repair of church facilities.

In December 1999, in response to strong criticism of the Ottoman decree, [[Hosni Mubarak|President Mubarak]] issued a decree making the repair of all places of worship subject to a 1976 civil construction code. The decree is significant symbolically because it places churches closer to an equal footing with mosques before the law. The practical impact of the decree has been to facilitate significantly church repairs; however, Christians report that local permits still are subject to security authorities' approval. The approval process for church construction continued to be time consuming and insufficiently responsive to the wishes of the Christian community. As a result of these restrictions, some communities use private buildings and apartments for religious services.

According to a 1995 law, the application of family law, including marriage, divorce, alimony, child custody, inheritance, and burial, is based on an individual's religion. In the practice of family law, the State recognizes only the three "heavenly religions": Islam, Christianity, and Judaism. Muslim families are subject to the Personal Status Law, which draws on [[Shari'a]] (Islamic law). Christian families are subject to canon law, and Jewish families are subject to Jewish law. In cases of family law disputes involving a marriage between a Christian woman and a Muslim man, the courts apply the Personal Status Law.

Under Islamic law, non-Muslim males must convert to Islam to marry Muslim women. Christian and Jewish women need not convert to marry Muslim men. Muslim women are prohibited from marrying Christian men. Muslim female heirs receive half the amount of a male heir's inheritance, while Christian widows of Muslims have no inheritance rights. A sole female heir receives half her parents' estate; the balance goes to designated male relatives. A sole male heir inherits all his parents' property. Male Muslim heirs face strong social pressure to provide for all family members who require assistance; however, this assistance is not always provided. In January 2000, the Parliament passed a new Personal Status Law that made it easier for a Muslim woman to obtain a divorce without her husband's consent, provided that she is willing to forgo alimony and the return of her dowry. However, an earlier provision of the draft law that would have made it easier for a woman to travel without her husband's consent, was rejected.

According to the 2010 census, there are around 3500 [[Muslims]] in the [[Czech Republic]] (less than 0.1% of country's population), compared to 495 in 1991. In 2016, there were an estimated 20,000 Muslims in the Czech Republic representing 0.2% of the country's population.&lt;ref&gt;Europe’s Growing Muslim Population ''[http://www.pewforum.org/2017/11/29/europes-growing-muslim-population/]'', [[Pew Research Center]], 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
First documented visit of a person with knowledge of [[Islam]] was made (964-965) by [[Íbrahím ibn Jaqúb]], a Jewish merchant from then-Muslim Spain. His memoirs were later published to become one of the first accounts about Central Europe in Islamic world.

During both sieges of [[Vienna]], reconnaissance groups  of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] armies reached [[Moravia]]. Strong trade links between [[Austria-Hungary]] and Ottoman Empire emerged during the 19th century.

Traditionally, influence of Islam on culture of Czech lands has been small.

==Modern era==
A law 1912 by the [[Austro-Hungarian monarchy]] recognised Islam as a "state religion" and officially allowed its presence in what is now the Czech Republic. The first community (''Muslimské náboženské obce pro Československo'') was established in 1934 and disbanded in 1949. An attempt to set up a new community in 1968 failed. In 1991, the ''Center of Muslim communities'' ({{lang-cz|Ústředí muslimských náboženských obcí}}) was established. In 1998 the first [[mosque]] was opened, in [[Brno]] [http://brno.muslim.cz/] and a year later another, in the capital, [[Prague]] [http://praha.muslim.cz/]. Attempts to open mosques in other cities have been stopped by local citizens. In 2004 Islam was officially registered in the Czech Republic: the community is thus eligible to obtain funds from the state.

Most of the Muslims are from [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] (early 1990s) and former countries of [[Soviet Union]] (mostly from [[Caucasus]] region, from the late 1990s until the present). A significant and influential part are the [[middle-class]] people of [[Egypt]]ian, [[Syria]]n and other [[Middle East]]ern ancestries (typically those who studied in Czechoslovakia and decided to stay). A few hundred Muslims are [[Czechs|Czech]] converts.&lt;ref&gt;Panýrková, Petra: ''[http://dspace.upce.cz/bitstream/10195/35451/1/PanyrkovaP_Konvertite%20k%20islamu_VP_%202010.pdf Konvertité k islámu v České republice]'', [[University of Pardubice]], 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fears of Islamic fundamentalism==
President [[Miloš Zeman]] is among those who have expressed fear that [[Islamic terrorism]] could threaten the Republic.&lt;ref name=BilefskyInfluential&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bilefsky|first1=Dan|title=Czech Man Is Charged With Attempted Terrorism|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/03/world/europe/czech-man-attempted-terrorism.html?ref=world|accessdate=3 August 2016|publisher=New York Times|date=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, for the first time, a Czech citizen was charged on suspicion of trying to join the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]].&lt;ref name=BilefskyInfluential/&gt;

'''''Jesus Camp''''' is a 2006 American [[documentary film]] directed by [[Rachel Grady]] and [[Heidi Ewing]] about a [[Charismatic Christian]] [[summer camp]], where children spend their summers being taught that they have "prophetic gifts" and can "take back America for [[Jesus|Christ]]".&lt;ref name="Detroit"&gt;{{cite web  |publisher=Real Detroit Weekly |title=Ewing believes in Jesus Camp |date=4 October 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416225825/http://www.realdetroitweekly.com/article_1885.shtml |archivedate=16 April 2008|url=http://www.realdetroitweekly.com/article_1885.shtml|last=Watts|first=Tom }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the distributor, it "doesn't come with any prepackaged point of view" and attempts to be "an honest and impartial depiction of one faction of the [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christian]] community".&lt;ref name="ChNews"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cole|first1=Kristin U.|title=Jesus Camp Distributors Adverse to Screening at Traverse: Michael Moore Ignores Request to Remove Documentary from Festival|url=http://www.christiannewswire.com/news/40691698.html|accessdate=9 August 2015|work=Christian News Wire|date=8 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
''Jesus Camp'' is about the [[Kids on Fire School of Ministry]], a [[charismatic movement|charismatic Christian]] [[summer camp]] located just outside [[Devils Lake, North Dakota]] and run by [[Becky Fischer]] and her ministry, "Kids in Ministry International." The film focuses on three children who attended the camp in the summer of 2005&amp;mdash;Levi, Rachael, and Tory (Victoria). The film cuts between footage of the camp and a children's prayer conference held just before the camp at Christ Triumphant Church, a large charismatic church in [[Lee's Summit, Missouri]], a suburb of [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]].

All three children are already very devout Christians. Levi has preached several sermons at his father's church, Rock of Ages Church in [[St. Robert, Missouri]]. He is [[homeschool]]ed, his mother explaining that God did not give her a child just so he could be raised by someone else eight hours a day. He learns science from a book that attempts to reconcile [[young-earth creationism]] with scientific principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wile |first=Jay L. |date=2000 |title=Exploring Creation With Physical Science|location= |publisher=Apologia Press |page= |isbn= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also taught that [[global warming]] is a political speculation, that the speculation stems from temperatures being higher in the summer months, that America's temperature has "only" risen by 0.6 [[fahrenheit|°F]], and therefore, the rise is not important. Levi preaches a sermon at the camp in which he declares that his generation is key to [[Second Coming|bringing Jesus back]].  Rachael, who also attends Levi's church (her father was assistant pastor at the time), is seen praying over a bowling ball during a game early in the film, and frequently passes Christian [[tract (literature)|tracts]] (including some by [[Jack Chick]]) to strangers, telling them that Jesus loves them. She does not think highly of non-charismatic churches (or "dead churches" as she calls them), feeling they are not "churches that God likes to go to." Tory is a member of the Children's Praise Dance Team at Christ Triumphant Church. She frequently dances to [[Christian metal|Christian heavy metal]] music, and says she has to check herself to make sure she isn't "dancing for the flesh."

At the camp, Fischer stresses the need for children to purify themselves in order to be part of the "army of God." She strongly believes that children need to be in the forefront of turning America toward [[christian right|conservative Christian]] values. She also feels that Christians need to focus on training kids since "the enemy" (radical Islam) is focused on training theirs. She compares the preparation she is giving children with the training of terrorists in the Middle East. "I want to see young people who are as committed to the cause of Jesus Christ as the young people are to the cause of Islam," she tells the camera. "I want to see them radically laying down their lives for the gospel, as they are over in Pakistan and Israel and Palestine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Glaister|first1=Den|title=They cry, pray to Bush and wash out the devil - welcome to ''Jesus Camp''|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/sep/29/usa.danglaister|accessdate=9 August 2015|date=29 September 2006|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one scene shot at Christ Triumphant Church, a woman brings a life-sized cutout of [[George W. Bush]] to the front of the church and has the children stretch their hands toward him in prayer for him. This is a derivative of [[laying on of hands]], a common practice in charismatic Christian circles. In another scene, [[Lou Engle]] preaches a message urging children to join the fight to end [[abortion]] in America. Children are shown a series of plastic models of developing fetuses, and have their mouths covered with red tape with "Life" written across it. Engle is a founder of the [[Justice House of Prayer]] and a leader of Harvest International Ministries, a network of charismatic-oriented ministries with which both the church and Fischer's ministry are affiliated. He prays for Bush to have the strength to appoint "righteous judges" who will overturn ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''. By the end of the sermon, the children are chanting, "Righteous judges! Righteous judges!"

There is also a scene at [[New Life Church, Colorado|New Life Church]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] where [[Ted Haggard]] preaches a sermon against [[homosexuality]]. Before the service, Levi mentioned how he admired Ted Haggard and was looking forward to meeting him. After the sermon, Levi informs Haggard that he has already preached sermons and wants to be a preacher when he grows up. Haggard advises him: "I say, use your cute kid thing until you're thirty, and by then you'll have good content." Afterward, Levi, Rachael, Tory, their families and several other children take part in a Justice House of Prayer rally held by Engle in front of the [[U.S. Supreme Court]].

Throughout the movie, there are cut scenes to a debate between Fischer and [[Mike Papantonio]], an attorney and a radio talk-show host for [[Air America Radio]]'s ''[[Ring of Fire (radio program)|Ring of Fire]]''. Papantonio questions Fischer's motives for focusing her ministry efforts on children. Fischer explains that she does not believe that people are able to choose their belief system once they pass childhood, and that it is important that they be "indoctrinated" in evangelical Christian values from a young age. Fischer also explains that democracy is flawed and designed to destroy itself "because we have to give everyone equal freedom".

==Release==
''Jesus Camp'' was screened at [[Michael Moore]]'s [[Traverse City Film Festival]] against the wishes of the distribution company, Magnolia Pictures.&lt;ref name="MooreShow"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kilday |first=Gregg |date=4 August 2006 |title=Moore fest defies distrib over 'Jesus' |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002950410 |dead-url=yes |newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930225110/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002950410 |archive-date=30 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnolia had pulled ''Jesus Camp'' from the festival earlier in the summer after it purchased rights to the film, in a decision apparently inspired by Moore's association with the film festival, with Magnolia president Eamonn Bowles saying "I don't want the perception out in the public that this is an agenda-laden film".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hernandez |first=Eugene |date=6 August 2006 |title=When A Fest Strategy Goes Awry: Traverse City Screens "Jesus Camp" Against Magnolia's Wishes |url=http://www.indiewire.com/ots/2006/08/jesus_camps_uni.html |dead-url=yes |newspaper=indieWire|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820140511/http://www.indiewire.com/ots/2006/08/jesus_camps_uni.html |archive-date=20 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home media===
The [[DVD]], released in January 2007, includes 15 [[deleted scenes]].&lt;ref name=dvdtalk&gt;{{cite web|title=Jesus Camp|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/26184/jesus-camp/|website=[[DVD Talk]]|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one of them, Levi's father and mother suggest that a future president may well have been at Kids on Fire. In another, a woman takes several of the kids on a "prayer walk" through Lee's Summit, and later takes them to a [[Crisis pregnancy center|pro-life women's clinic]].  A [[Planned Parenthood]] clinic is located next door, and the woman has the kids pray over it. In an interview, the pro-life clinic's director says that she was very pleased to see children so passionate about ending abortion.

The DVD also includes commentary by Grady and Ewing.&lt;ref name="dvdtalk" /&gt; They reveal that when they arrived in Kansas City, there was a great deal of excitement over the nomination of [[Samuel Alito]] to the Supreme Court. However, according to Grady and Ewing, Fischer and the others did not see their activism for [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] causes as political, but as a matter of faith. They also reveal that Fischer and the others did not understand why some of the scenes of them [[speaking in tongues]] and praying over objects were included in the film, since such occurrences were second nature to them. Furthermore, on the DVD commentary, Heidi and Grady refer to the central character, Becky Fisher, as "a great documentary subject" because of her charisma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nichols|first1=Bill|title=Introduction to Documentary|date=2017|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, Indiana|isbn=978-0-253-02685-9|pages=41|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Controversy===
According to Ron Reno of [[Focus on the Family]], 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The directors' claims that they were simply trying to create an 'objective' film about children and faith ring hollow. I don't question the motives of the Christians shown in the film. Indeed, the earnestness and zeal with which the young people pictured attempt to live out their faith are admirable. Unfortunately, however, it appears that they were unknowingly being manipulated by the directors in their effort to cast evangelical Christianity in an unflattering light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pluggedin.com/videos/2006/q4/jesuscamp.aspx |title=Jesus Camp |publisher=Plugged In |date= |accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In November 2006, Fischer announced that she would be shutting down the camp due to negative reaction towards her in the film. According to Fischer's website, the owners of the property used for the camp shown in the film were concerned about [[vandalism]] to the premises following the film's release and thus will not allow it to be used for any future camps. Fischer has said that the camp will be indefinitely postponed until other suitable premises can be found, but that it will be back.&lt;ref name="Seattle news"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kidsinministry.com/ClosingDownCamp.html |title=Kids in Ministry: Are You Closing Jesus Camp Down?|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103020010/http://www.kidsinministry.com/ClosingDownCamp.html |archive-date=3 January 2007|work=Kidsinministry.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
''Jesus Camp'' received an 87% "Certified Fresh" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 103 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website's consensus states, "Evangelical indoctrination is given an unflinching, even-handed look in this utterly worthwhile documentary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Jesus Camp'' (2006) |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jesus_camp/|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary has a 62/100 score on [[Metacritic]] based on 28 mainstream reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/jesus-camp |title=''Jesus Camp'' Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Smith of the ''[[Tulsa World]]'' gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as "impressive in its even-handed presentation", "straightforward" and "a revealing, unabashed look at the formation of tomorrow's army of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/article.aspx?subjectid=221&amp;articleid=060915_Mo_s4_makin |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130412001538/http://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/article.aspx?subjectid=221&amp;articleid=060915_Mo_s4_makin |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 April 2013 |last=Smith |first=Michael |date=15 September 2006 |title=Making Child Warriors |publisher=''[[Tulsa World]]'' |accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' reviewer Jessica Reaves also gave the film three stars out of four and writes that Jesus Camp is "an enlightening and frank look at what the force known as Evangelical America believes, preaches and teaches their children" and concludes that what the filmmakers "have accomplished here is remarkable—capturing the visceral humanity, desire and unflagging political will of a religious movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chicago.metromix.com/movies/review/movie-review-jesus-camp/162255/content |title=Movie review: 'Jesus Camp' |first=Jessica| last=Reaves |publisher=[[Metromix]] Chicago |date=28 August 2007 |accessdate=4 March 2010 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103150815/http://chicago.metromix.com/movies/review/movie-review-jesus-camp/162255/content | archivedate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Edelstein]] of ''[[CBS Sunday Morning]]'', ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', and [[National Public Radio|NPR]] finds ''Jesus Camp'' "a frightening, infuriating, yet profoundly compassionate documentary about the indoctrination of children by the Evangelical right."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyorkmetro.com/movies/reviews/21366/index1.html|title=Wake-up Fall|publisher=New York|date=25 September 2006|accessdate=9 August 2015|last=Edelstein|first=David|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007133420/http://newyorkmetro.com/movies/reviews/21366/index1.html|archivedate=7 October 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some reviewers responded negatively to the film; Rob Nelson of the ''[[Village Voice]]'' called the movie "[an] absurdly hypocritical critique of the far right's role in the escalating culture war",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0638,nelson,74510,20.html |title='Jesus Camp' |first=Rob |last=Nelson |publisher=[[Village Voice]] |date=19 September 2006 |accessdate=4 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060922024001/http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0638%2Cnelson%2C74510%2C20.html |archivedate=22 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and J. R. Jones of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' criticized the film for "failing to distinguish the more fundamentalist Pentecostals" and for inserting "unnecessary editorializing" by using clips from [[Mike Papantonio]]'s radio show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/young-americans/Content?oid=923285 |title=Young Americans: Documentaries about John Lennon and far-right Christians both come down to a battle for the hearts and minds of the kids |publisher=[[Chicago Reader]] |date=28 September 2006 |first=J.

'''Kaveri Pushkaram''' is a festival of [[Kaveri|River Kaveri]] that normally occurs once in 12 years. This [[Maha Pushkaram]](occurs once every 144 years) is observed for a period  of 12 days from the time of entry of [[Jupiter]] into ''Tula'' rasi ([[Libra (astrology)|Libra]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Roshen Dalal |title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zrk0AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT921 |date=18 April 2014 |publisher=Penguin Books Limited |isbn=978-81-8475-277-9 |pages=921–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mayiladuthurai ==

[[File:Mayiladuthuraipuskharam1.jpg|left|thumb|Mayiladuthurai is getting ready for Pushkaram]] 

Mayiladuthurai (formerly known by its Sanskrit name Mayuram) is a town in Nagapattinam district in Tamil Nadu.The town is located at a distance of 281 km (175 mi) from the state capital Chennai. Mayiladuthurai is known for the [[Mayuranathaswami_Temple,_Mayiladuthurai|Mayuranathaswami Temple]], a prominent Shaivite shrine and [[Parimala_Ranganatha_Perumal_temple|Parimala Ranganathar Temple]], one of the 108 Divya Desams.

Maha Pushkaram was celebrated with grandeur in [[Mayiladuthurai]] from September 12 to September 24, 2017. As the configuration and alignment of stars happen once in 144 years,  the devotees throng the Thula ghat to have a holy dip. Veda Parayanam, Homam, Maha Yagnam, cultural activities such as music, traditional dances, spiritual discourses, Annadhanam, and pithru tharpanam are organized during festival days. A permanent tank with concrete flooring and one foot of sand amidst the river to hold water was set up. The Kanchi acharyas and other prominent Mutt heads have come to grace the occasion at Mayilduthurai.

The main event is at the Thula Kattam in Mayiladuthurai on the Cauvery, thousands of devotees sprinkled the holy water from the specially crafted tank readied as part of the Maha Pushkaram efforts. The Thula Kattam was renovated at a cost of ₹3 crore and the 12 sacred wells(built during  medieval chola period) in the Thula Kattam also underwent a major revival.An idol of Kaveri matha was installed in the shores of river and poojas are being performed as part of this celebration

Early on day one, yagasala poojas were carried out at the Mangala Vinayakar shrine at the Vadapal Karai and Kanchi Acharyas Sri Jayendra Saraswathi and Sri Sankara Vijayendra Saraswati Swamigals along with Dharmapuram and Thiruvavaduthurai Adheenam pontiffs poured the sanctified waters at the yagasala on to River Cauvery.

The processional deities of Sri Mayuranatha Swamy, Sri Ayyarappar, Sri Kasi Viswanathar, Sri Vatharanyeswarar arrived at the banks of the Thula Kattam and soon after, abishekam was performed for the Astra Devars of those deities even as the Mutt heads took a holy dip to mark the commencement of the Cauvery Maha Pushkaram. The devotees followed the pontiffs in participating in the event.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13921">{{Zoroastrianism}}
'''Khvarenah''' or '''khwarenah''' ({{lang-ae|𐬓𐬀𐬭𐬆𐬥𐬀𐬵}} ''{{transl|ae|xᵛarənah}}'') is an [[Avestan language|Avestan]] word for a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] concept literally denoting "glory" or "splendour" but understood as a divine mystical force or power projected upon and aiding the appointed. The neuter noun thus also connotes "(divine) royal glory," reflecting the perceived divine empowerment of kings. The term also carries a secondary meaning of "(good) fortune"; those who possess it are able to complete their mission or function.

In 3rd-7th century [[Sassanid]]-era inscriptions as well as in the 9th-12th century texts of Zoroastrian tradition, the word appears as Zoroastrian [[Middle Persian]] ''khwarrah'', rendered with the [[Pahlavi script|Pahlavi]] ideogram ''&lt;small&gt;GDE&lt;/small&gt;'', reflecting [[Aramaic]] ''gada'' "fortune." Middle Persian ''khwarrah'' continues as [[New Persian]] ''k(h)orra''. These variants, which are assumed to be learned borrowings from the Avestan, are the only [[Iranian languages|Iranian language]] forms with an initial 'xᵛ-'. In all other dialects, the word has an initial ''f-'' (see details under [[#Etymology and related terms|related terms]], below).

==Etymology and related terms==
Avestan ''khvarenah'' is probably{{sfn|Gnoli|1999|p=313}} derived from Proto-Avestan ''*hvar'' "to shine," nominalized with the ''-nah'' suffix. Proto-Avestan ''*[[Hvare-khshaeta|hvar]]'' is in turn related to Old Indic ''svar'' with the same meaning, and together descending from Proto-Indo-Iranian [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-Iranian/suHar-|*''súHr̥'']] "to shine", ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European]] ''*sóhr'' "to shine". Other proposals suggest a linguistic relationship with Avestan ''xᵛar-'' "to eat".

Of the numerous [[Iranian languages]] in which the word is attested, the initial ''xᵛ-'' is  evident only as Avestan ''khvar(e)nah'' and as Zoroastrian [[Middle Persian]] ''khwarrah'', from which [[New Persian]] ''khorra'' then derives. In other Iranian dialects the word has an ''f-'' form, for instance as [[Median language|Median]] and [[Old Persian]] ''farnah-'', from which Middle- and New Persian ''farr(ah)'' and adjectival ''farrokh'' derive. For many decades, the ''f-'' form was believed to represent a specific Median sound-law change of proto-Iranian ''xᵛ-'' to ''f-''. The hypothesis has since been shown to be untenable, and the proto-Iranian form is today reconstructed as ''*hu̯&lt;!-- combining u+inverted breve below --&gt;'',{{sfn|Gnoli|1996|p=171}} preserved in Avestan as ''xᵛ-'' and dissimilated as ''f-'' in other Iranian dialects.

In the Iranian languages of the Middle Period, the word is also attested as [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]] ''far(r)o'', [[Khotanese language|Khotanese]] ''pharra'', [[Parthian language|Parthian]] ''farh'', [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] ''f(a)rn'', and [[Ossetic]] ''farnae'' and ''farn'', though in these languages the word does not necessarily signify "glory" or "fortune": 
In [[Buddhism]], Sogdian ''farn'' and Khotanese ''pharra'' signified a "position of a Buddha," that is, with "dignity" or "high position." This meaning subsequently passed into [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]]. In [[Manicheanism]], Sogdian ''frn'' signified "luck" and was a designator of the "first luminary". Manichean Parthian ''farh'' again signifies "glory." In [[Scythians|Scytho]]-[[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] and [[Alans|Alan]] culture, Digoron Ossetic ''farnae'' and Iron Ossetic ''farn'' signified "peace, happiness, abundance, fortune."

The term also appears as a borrowing in [[Armenian language|Armenian]] ''[[wikt:փառք|pʿarkʿ]]'', but with a greater range of meaning than in Iranian languages.

==In scripture==
Bisyllabic ''khvarenah'' is only attested once in the [[Gatha]]s, the oldest hymns of Zoroastrianism and considered to have been composed by the prophet himself. The one instance of Gathic ''khvarenah'' occurs in ''[[Yasna]]'' 51.18, where the word appears to mean royal glory. The primary source of information on ''khvarenah'' comes from the ''[[Yasht]]''s, the younger [[Avesta|Avesta's]] collection of 21 hymns dedicated to individual divinities.

Two distinct forms of ''khvarenah'' are discernible in ''[[Yasht]]'' 19:&lt;ref name="Lubotsky_1996_480"&gt;{{harvnb|Lubotsky|1996|p=480}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''kavam khvarenah'' (''kauuaēm xᵛarənah''), the fortune of the ''kavi''s, the Kayanian kings
* ''akhvaretem khvarenah'' (''axᵛarətəm xᵛarənah''), glory that both divinities and mortals should strive for.
Similarly ''Yasht'' 18, although nominally dedicated to [[Arshtat]], is a short 9-verse ode to a third variant of ''khvarenah''; the Iranian ''khvarenah'' (''airiianəm xᵛarənah'') that is created by [[Ahura Mazda]] and that is "full of milk and pastures," vanquishes the ''[[daeva]]''s and the [[Aniran|Un-Iranians]].

''Yasht'' 19, which is nominally dedicated to [[Zam]] "Earth", further typifies ''khvarenah'' as a ''[[yazata]]'',&lt;ref name="Boyce_1975_66-68"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|1975|pp=66–68}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that is, itself "worthy of worship." The same hymn includes a list of divinities and mortals who perform their duties due to the power of ''khvarenah''. Among these are the 
mythological Kayanian kings – the ''kavi''s (''kauui''s) – who are rulers through the grace of, and empowered by, ''khvarenah''.

''Khvarenah'' is however also glory held by divinities: [[Ahura Mazda]] has it (19.9-13), the [[Amesha Spenta]]s have it (19.14-20), the other [[yazata]]s as well (19.21-24). [[Jamshid|Yima]] loses it thrice, in turn to [[Mithra]], [[Thraetaona]] and [[Garshasp|Keresaspa]]. ''Khvarenah'' assumes the shape of a bird when leaving Yima. (19.35-36, 19.82)

According to ''Yasht'' 13.14, the waters flow, the plants spring forth, and the winds blow through the ''khvarenah'' of the [[Fravashi]]s. In ''Yasna'' 68.11, the waters of [[Aredvi Sura Anahita|Aredvi Sura]] are invoked to bestow radiance and glory. ''Khvarenah'' is also associated with the waters in other texts; with the world-sea Vourukasha in ''Yasht'' 19.51 and 19.56-57; with the Helmand river in ''Yasht'' 19.66ff. It is also identified with [[Haoma]], together with which it plays a seminal role in the legend of the birth of Zoroaster. In these passages, ''khvarenah'' has a seminal and germinal implication, being both fiery fluid and living seed.

In ''Yasna'' 60.2, the family priest is seen to request joy and blessings for the righteous, good nature, truth, prosperity, power, and glory for the house in which he offers prayers. The hymn to Mithra speaks of the divinity as the "dispenser of ''khvarenah''" (''Yasht'' 10.16, 10.128, 10.141). Other texts describe Mithra as "most endowed with glory" (''Yasht'' 19.35, ''[[Vendidad]]'' 19.15).

In ''Yasht'' 19.46, [[Akem Manah]], the demon of "evil purpose" attempts (but fails) to seize ''khvarenah''. The Iranian ''khvarenah'' and [[Dahman]],  the hypostasis of prayer, render [[Bushyasta]] - the demoness of "sloth" – powerless (''Yasht'' l0.97, 13.4).

At the final renovation of the world, the royal glory will follow the [[Saoshyant|''Saoshyant''s]] (''Yasht'' 19.89).

==In tradition==
In the 9th-12th century texts of Zoroastrian tradition ''khvarenah'' (→ [[Middle Persian]] ''khwarrah'') is a spiritual force that exists before the creation of the ''tan-gohr'', the mortal body (''[[Bundahishn]]'' II.7ff, ''Zadspram'' 3.75). In these later texts, the glory appears to be acquirable through learning and knowledge (''Bundahishn'' II.9ff).

''Khwarrah'' continues to be identified with astral bodies (''Dadistan-i Denig'' I.25, I.35-36), but its primary function is in its role as the divine glory of kings, the continuation of the Avestan notion of the ''kavam khvarenah''. New in tradition is an identification of ''khwarrah'' with religion, as in "the great ''khwarrah''-bestowing force of the pure religion" (''Dadistan-i Denig'' I.36)

The ''[[Karnamag-i Artaxshir-i Papakan|Kar-namag i Ardashir]]'', a collection of hagiographic legends related to [[Ardashir I|Ardashir]], the founder of the [[Sassanid empire]], includes (4.11.16 and 4.11.22-23) a tale in which Ardashir &amp;ndash; who at that point in the story is still a vassal of the [[Arsacid dynasty of Parthia|Arsacid Parthians]] &amp;ndash; escapes from the court of the last Arsacid king, [[Artabanus V|Ardavan]]. In the story, Ardashir makes off with much Ardavan's treasure, as well as Ardavan's favourite concubine, and is being chased by Ardavan and his troops. On the road, Ardavan and his contingent are overtaken by an enormous ram, which is also following Ardashir. Ardavan's religious advisors explain that the ram is the manifestation of the ''khwarrah'' of the ancient Iranian kings, which is leaving Ardavan and the Parthians in favor of a new emperor.&lt;!-- this para from Rose, Zoroastrianism --&gt;

The representation of ''khwarrah'' as a ram reappears on Sassanid seals and as an ornament in Sassanid architecture. ''Khwarrah'' also appears in Sassanian crowns as a bird with a pearl in its beak. Depictions of ''khwarrah'' as a bird are allusions to the Avestan myth of ''Yasht'' 19.35-36, 19.82 in which ''khvarenah'' takes the shape of a bird as it leaves [[Jamshid|Yima]] (MP: Jamshid), a metamorphosis similar to that of the yazata of victory, [[Verethragna]].{{sfn|Gnoli|1999|p=316}} The crown as a repository of ''khwarrah'' is also attested in the Paikuli inscription of Narseh, which describes the punishment meted out to an individual who has been "driven by [[Angra Mainyu|Ahriman]] and the [[daeva|''dev''s]]" to steal ''khwarrah'' by placing the crown on the head of a false ruler.{{sfn|de Jong|2004|p=364}} Another ubiquitous motif in Sassanian art is the symbol of a boar, which is a representation of the protection of the ''yazata'' [[Verethragna]] (MP: Wahram) given to rulers that hold ''khwarrah''.&lt;!-- this para from Rose, Zoroastrianism --&gt;

The ring of kingship that appears in Sassanian investiture reliefs is often identified as representing ''khwarrah''.&lt;ref name="cfGnoli316" /&gt; This is also the case for the ring held by the bearded figure in the Achaemenid winged sun-disk symbol that is traditionally considered to represent a ''[[fravashi]]'' (MP: ''fravahr''). The Achaemenid winged sun-disk has in its entirety also been occasionally been interpreted as a representation of ''khvarenah''.&lt;ref name="cfGnoli316"&gt;''cf.'' {{harvnb|Gnoli|1999|p=316}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

That ''khwarrah'' – in addition to its significance as "royal fortune" – also signified "fortune" in a general sense is demonstrated by the use of an [[Aramaic]] ideogram ''GDE'' in the Middle Persian texts of the [[Sassanid]] and post-Sassanid periods.{{sfn|Gnoli|1999|p=315}} The custom of using this Aramic ideogram to represent ''khvarenah'' is probably inherited from Achaemenid times.{{sfn|Gnoli|1999|p=315}}

==Syncretic influences==
"The fundamental motif of Iranian kingship, a hereditary dynastic charisma [...], which, could however be lost, was at the root of ideas that were widespread in the Hellenistic and Roman periods."{{sfn|Gnoli|1999|p=315}} For example, as the ''tyche basileos, fortuna regia,'' the saving grace (luck) of fortune of a king; and probably also the royal ''farrah'' in the ''tyche'' of the various Hellenistic rulers of the [[Seleucid]] and [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]] periods as well as of the [[Kushan]] kings.{{sfn|Gnoli|1999|p=315}}

Because the concepts of ''khvarenah''/''khwarrah'' and Aramaic ''gd(y)'' circulated in the same areas and have many characteristics in common, it is possible that the Mesopotamian concept influenced the Zoroastrian one.{{sfn|Gnoli|1999|p=316}} On the other hand, ''khvarenah'' may also be a facet of Zoroastrianism's Indo-Iranian cultural inheritance since ''khvarenah'' appears to have a parallel in Indic ''tejas''.&lt;!-- do not link. redirects to agni, which is formally incorrect. --&gt; in which kingship is likewise associated with the bright splendor and power of light and fire.{{sfn|Gnoli|1999|p=316}}

The concept of the royal ''khwarrah'' survived the 7th century downfall of the [[Sassanid empire]], and remained a central motif (for instance as the ''farr-e elahi'') in the culture, philosophy and epics of Islamic Iran.{{sfn|Gnoli|1999|p=315}}

[[Image:God G Kinich Ahau 2.jpg|thumb|220px|Kinich Ahau as a ruler, Classic period]]
'''Kinich Ahau'''{{Pronunciation-needed}} (K'inich Ajaw) is the 16th-century [[Yucatec]] name of the Maya sun god, designated as '''God G''' when referring to the codices. In the Classic period, God G is depicted as a middle-aged man with an aquiline nose, large square eyes, cross-eyed, and a filed incisor in the upper row of teeth. Usually, there is a ''k'in'' 'sun'-infix, sometimes in the very eyes. Among the southern [[Lacandon people|Lacandons]], Kinich Ahau continued to play a role in narrative well into the second half of the twentieth century.

==Names==
Kinich Ahau is the Yucatec and Lacandon name of the sun god. The element ''k'inich'', usually assumed to mean 'sun-eyed', appears to have been in general use as a royal title during the Classic Period. Kinich Ahau should not be confused with Ah K'in or Ah K'in Chob. ''Ah K'in'' is Yucatec for 'someone who deals with the day(s)', the word for 'day' and 'sun' being the same. The term refers to Yucatec calendar priests and to priests in general. As to ''Ah K'in'' Chob, J.E.S. Thompson suggested that this Lacandon deity name (alternating with Can Chob and Chi Chac Chob) could refer to the sun deity,&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1970: 241&lt;/ref&gt; but the mythology of Ah K'in Chob does not bear this out.&lt;ref&gt;see Boremanse 1986: 113-118, 186-187, 196-197&lt;/ref&gt; Although the element ''chob'' has been translated as 'squint-eyed', which is an iconographic feature of the Classic sun deity, the only source for this translation is a single statement by Tozzer.&lt;ref&gt;Tozzer 1907: 95n.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==16th-century Yucatan==
Kinich Ahau was the patron of one of the four years of the 52-year cycle (Landa). In the rituals introducing this year, war dances were executed.&lt;ref&gt;Landa, in Tozzer 1941: 144&lt;/ref&gt; Kinich Ahau was apparently considered an aspect of the upper god, [[Itzamna]]. He may conceivably be related to the patron deity of Izamal, Kinich Kakmo 'Fire Parrot', who was reported to descend to earth while the sun was standing in the zenith in order to consume offerings ([[Cogolludo]]).

==Classic period==
God G's appearances in Classic [[Ancient Maya art#Stucco modeling|Maya art]] are, perhaps, best known from large stucco masks adorning pyramids. Compared to the deities connected to agricultural fertility, however, God G occurs rather infrequently in other media than stucco, and is rarely part of narrative events. It may be noted that the [[Hero Twins]], Hunahpu and Xbalanque, although stated to have changed into Sun and Moon, are never shown assimilated to God G.

===Land of the Sunrise: Eastern Paradise===
The Sun God is associated with an aquatic eastern paradise,&lt;ref&gt;Taube 2004: 78ff&lt;/ref&gt; where he can assume the shape of a chimerical water bird,&lt;ref&gt;Hellmuth 1987: figs. 354D, 359&lt;/ref&gt; or be shown as a young man, paddling a canoe.&lt;ref&gt;Hellmuth 1987: fig. 167&lt;/ref&gt; Such imagery could suggest lyric religious poetry comparable to the Aztec evocations of a 'flower paradise' (Taube).

===Ancestral solar kings===
The sun deity can be shown as a king (''ajaw'') seated high on a throne cushion (as on the famous, narrative 'Rabbit Vase' from [[Naranjo]]), or as a ruler carrying the bicephalic 'ceremonial bar'. Inversely, the Maya king is repeatedly assimilated to the sun deity. The emblematic double-bird of the early Copan king, [[Yax K'uk' Mo']] 'Great Quetzal-Parrot', shows the head of the sun deity within its beaks. Ancestral Maya kings assimilated to the sun deity were sometimes depicted while vertically descending from the zenith (as on Takalik Abaj stela 2 and Tikal stela 31). Particularly in Yaxchilan, the ancestral king is seated within a solar cartouche, his wife in a lunar crescent. The solar aspect of a king often seems to imply [[apotheosis]] and life after death.

===Calendar===
Hieroglyphically, the sun god is the patron of the day-unit (''k'in'' 'day, sun'), the month of Yaxk'in 'Dry season', and the number Four (in parallel with the day Ahau).

===Connections with other deities===
Several other deities evince a large eye, such as God D (Itzamna), [[Chaak]], and various [[Maya jaguar gods|jaguar gods]]. Attribute sharing (including the ''k'in'' infix) occurs chiefly with the so-called [[Maya jaguar gods#The Jaguar God of Terrestrial Fire and War ('Night Sun')|Jaguar God of the Underworld]] and a human-faced ocean deity with shell ears, fins beside the mouth, and a sacrificial awl set in the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;Hellmuth 1987: 283-286, 292-296&lt;/ref&gt; The 'Jaguar God of the Underworld' is traditionally referred to by scholars as the 'Night Sun', i.e., the form supposedly taken by the sun during his subterranean journey from West to East. It has been suggested that the three just-mentioned deities involved in the sharing of attributes could, perhaps, represent various stages of the sun's daily cycle.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Hellmuth 1987: 284&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology and ritual==
Recent [[Maya mythology]] is mainly concerned with Sun's childhood and the conflicts leading up to his actual solar transformation. Although specific imagery is used for the path of the sun (for example, the sun being carried through the underworld on the shoulders of its lord),&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1970: 240&lt;/ref&gt; there are hardly any histories concerning the mature sun deity, save for the southern Lacandons. According to them, Kinich Ahau, the elder brother of the upper god, will put an end to this world by descending from the sky and have his jaguars devour mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Boremanse 1986: 279-280&lt;/ref&gt; Little is also known about specific solar rituals, although it is noteworthy that Kinich Ahau regularly occurs in the [[Dresden Codex]], which is largely concerned with ritual matters.

'''Lake Waiau''' is a high-elevation [[lake]] located at {{convert|3970|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level on [[Mauna Kea]], on the island of [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaiʻi]]. It is arguably one of the highest lakes in the United States,&lt;ref name="PaSc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highestlake.com/highest-lake-usa.html#Waiau |title=The Highest Lake in the USA |accessdate=2008-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the evaporation of [[Ka Wai o Pele]] in 2018 the only lake on [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaiʻi Island]], and one of very few lakes at all in the state of [[Hawaiʻi]]. It is relatively small, only about 100 m across, and varies in size as the water level rises and falls. At high water levels a small outlet stream appears at the northwest end, but it is absorbed into the ground after a short distance. The name means "swirling water" in [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], though it is usually rather placid. It usually freezes in winter, but aquatic insects such as [[midges]] and [[beetle]]s can be found breeding in the water.

== Description ==
Lake Waiau is located inside the ''Pu'u Waiau'' cinder cone at an altitude of 3970 m. It is approximately heart shaped and its diameter reaches about 100 m. The average surface area of the lake is around 6000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The size of its surface area fluctuates significantly over the year. It reaches its peak during spring with a maximal depth between 2 m and 2.5 m and by the end of the summer it often has shrunk to one third of its original size with a maximal depth below 1 m. A spillover into the ''Pohakuloa Gulch'' occurs, when the lake depth is more than 2.3 m. The lake is only fed precipitation which occurs primarily during the winter, its catchment area is about 135,000  m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; mostly located within ''Pu'u Waiau'' cinder cone.&lt;ref name="PaSc"/&gt;

The lake is an anomaly in the peak region of Mauna Kea as everywhere else the ground is unable to retain water. The exact nature of the impermeable ground layer of the lake is still unknown. It is assumed, that fine-grained densely compressed ash, basalt rock or small permafrost layer may play a role. No permafrost layer has been established so far for the lake area itself, but it was found at another location in peak area. Established however is 7.5 m thick sediment layer at the bottom of the lake.&lt;ref name="PaSc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ziegler"/&gt;

== Temporary shrinkage 2010-2014 ==

Between 2010 and 2013 the lake shrank significantly, and by September 2013 the lake was reduced to a mere puddle with less than 2% of its original surface size. The exact causes for the water loss are unknown. The suspects are drought conditions and the thawing of an assumed permafrost layer under the lake leading to increased seepage.&lt;ref name="Star"/&gt; However, after the particularly wet winter of 2013/2014, the lake was back to around 75% of its original size by May 2014, and subsequently returned to its normal size. Therefore, it is currently assumed that primary reason for the water loss were the drought conditions on Mauna Kea from 2010 to 2013.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chelsea Jensen: [http://westhawaiitoday.com/news/local-news/lake-waiau-atop-mauna-kea-nearly-full-or-full-fall-2014 ''Lake Waiau atop Mauna Kea nearly full or full since fall 2014'']. Eest Hawaii Today, 2017-03-22&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythology ==
The lake is of some importance in Hawaiian mythology. Aside from ''[[Poliʻahu]],'' there are two additional snow deities, ''Lilinoe'' and ''Waiau'', who are associated with Mauna Kea, and according to Westervelt, the lake was probably named after the goddess of the same, who used to bathe in it. Originally, Hawaiians considered the whole peak region of Mauna Kea, including Lake Waiau, a sacred site, and only priests and [[chieftain]]s were allowed to access it. Later, after the formation of the Hawaiian kingdom, the peak region was occasionally visited by members of the royal family. The last one to do so was [[Queen Emma of Hawaii|queen Emma]] in 1881, who also took a bath in the lake during her visit.&lt;ref name="MKVIS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nimmo"/&gt;

{{Roman Catholic Mariology}}
'''Mediatrix of all graces''' is a [[Marian title|title]] that [[Roman Catholics]] give to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] as the Mother of God; it includes the understanding that she mediates the Divine Grace. In a papal encyclical of Sept. 8, 1894 Pope Leo XIII states the following:

{{Quote|text="The recourse we have to Mary in prayer follows upon the office she continuously fills by the side of the throne of God as Mediatrix of Divine grace"&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_08091894_iucunda-semper-expectatione.html Pope Leo XIII, Encyclical ''Iucunda Semper Expectatione'', 8 September 1894]&lt;/ref&gt;|author=Pope Leo XIII|title=Iucunda Semper Expectatione}}

The [[Second Vatican Council]] referred in its document ''[[Lumen gentium]]'' to Mary as "Advocate, Auxiliatrix, Adjutrix and Mediatrix".

==Proposal for dogmatic definition==
The formal definition of ''Mediatrix of all graces'' as a [[Roman Catholic dogma|dogma]] was not considered opportune during discussions held to prepare for the Second Vatican Council.&lt;ref name="25 June 1997, page 10"&gt;''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'', Weekly Edition in English [http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/ormaria2.htm 25 June 1997, page 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1896, French Jesuit priest René-Marie de la Broise interpreted [[Pope Leo XIII]]'s papal encyclical ''[[Octobri mense]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_22091891_octobri-mense_en.html Pope Leo XIII, Encyclical ''Octobri mense'', 22 September 1891]; cf. [http://www.ewtn.com/faith/teachings/marya4a.htm William G. Most, "Church Teaching on Mary as Mediatrix of (All) Graces"]&lt;/ref&gt; as teaching that ''all'' graces from [[Jesus Christ]] are imparted through Mary. Broise proposed that the pontiff should make a dogmatic definition about the role of Mary in the distribution of all graces, but did not require that it be in the form of declaring her to be the [[mediatrix]] of all graces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TQLTAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR3&amp;dq=%22Gloria+Falc%C3%A3o+Dodd%22+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VaAIVOLIGe_G7Abmx4DQCA&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Octobri&amp;f=false] Gloria Falcão Dodd, ''The Virgin Mary, Mediatrix of All Graces: History and Theology of the Movement for a Dogmatic Definition from 1896 - 1964'' (Academy of the Immaculate. 2012. {{ISBN|978-1-60114061-6}}), pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebration in Belgium==
In [[Belgium]], 8 years later, Redemptorist priest François Xavier Godts wrote a book, ''De definibilitate mediationis universalis Deiparae'' (On the definability of the universal mediation of the Mother of God), proposing precisely that it be defined that Mary is the Mediatrix of all graces. [[Désiré-Joseph Mercier]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Archbishop]] of Mechelen, Belgium championed this cause.

In response to petitions from Belgium, including one signed by all its bishops, the [[Holy See]] approved in 1921 an annual celebration in that country of a [[feast day]] of ''Mary Mediatrix of All Graces''.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Miravilla (editor), 2008, ''Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons, Seminarians, and Consecrated Persons'', Queenship Publishing. {{ISBN|1-57918-355-7}}. page 448.&lt;/ref&gt; In printings of the [[Roman Missal]] from that date until 1961, the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] of Mary Mediatrix of All Graces was found in the appendix ''Missae pro aliquibus locis'' (Masses for Some Places), but not in the [[General Roman Calendar|general calendar]] for use wherever the [[Roman Rite]] is celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, [http://www.clerus.org/bibliaclerusonline/en/bjm.htm#czt the 1957 printing] and a [http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/missale-romanum-pdf.html late-1920s printing.]&lt;/ref&gt; Other Masses authorized for celebration in different places on the same day 31 May were those of [http://www.clerus.org/bibliaclerusonline/en/fo.htm#czp the Blessed Virgin Mary Queen of All Saints and Mother of Fair Love] and [http://www.clerus.org/bibliaclerusonline/en/bjm.htm#czx Our Lady of the Sacred Heart of Jesus]. The Belgian celebration has now been replaced by an optional memorial on 31 August of [[Mediatrix|the Virgin Mary Mediatrix]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liturgiecatholique.fr/Calendrier-liturgique-francophone,3146.html Calendrier liturgique francophone 2010-2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly opposition to dogmatic definition==
Despite requests for a new Marian dogma, the Fathers of Vatican II and the Popes who presided at the Council, [[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]] and [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]]  decided not to proceed with new dogmatic definitions. The decree ''[[Lumen gentium]]'' of [[Vatican II]] would caution of the title of "Mediatrix" that: "This, however, is to be so understood that it neither takes away from nor adds anything to the dignity and efficaciousness of Christ the one Mediator". ''Lumen gentium'' had 2,151 bishops voting for it and only five against.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html|title=Lumen gentium, 62|last=|first=|date=|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1996, a [[Mariology|Mariological]] Congress was held in [[Czestochowa]], [[Poland]], where a commission was established in response to a request of the [[Holy See]]. The congress sought the opinion of scholars present there regarding the possibility of proposing a fifth Marian dogma on Mary as Coredemptrix, Mediatrix and Advocate. The commission unanimously declared that it was not opportune to define a fifth Marian dogma on those titles. The Declaration of Czestochowa observed that while these titles can be given a content in conformity with the deposit of the faith, nevertheless such "titles, as proposed, are ambiguous, as they can be understood in very different ways".&lt;ref name="25 June 1997, page 10"/&gt;

==Devotion in the Philippines==
[[File:Mediatrix Lipa.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Our Lady Mediatrix of All Grace from 1948 at the Carmelite convent in Lipa. The apparitions were approved by the local Catholic Church in September 2015.]]
Among [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Filipino Catholics]], the term "Mediatrix" is associated with an alleged 1948 apparition of the Virgin Mary to [[Teresita Castillo]], with title ''[[Our Lady Mediatrix of All Grace]]'' in the [[Carmelite]] monastery of [[Lipa, Batangas]], [[Philippines]]. [[Ramon Arguelles|Ramón Argüelles]], the current Archbishop of Lipa, declared his personal belief in the veracity of the 1948 apparitions, encouraging veneration of Mary under that title.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marymediatrixofallgrace.com/about/the-philippine-bishops-and-the-mediatrix/ Letter of Archbishop Ramon C. Arguelles, 17 April 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

The apparition is well known in the Philippines and among the [[Overseas Filipino|Filipino diaspora]], most notably the preserved rose petals which fell from the sky and are claimed to be miraculous. Philippine [[Ambassador]] to the [[Holy See]] [[Mercedes Arrastia Tuason]] is a known devotee of the apparitions, and displays a large statue in her consulate office in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Office of the Ambassador of the Philippines to the Vatican, Pope Paul VI residence - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4uNvPfw2lk&lt;/ref&gt;

Stigmatist [[Emma de Guzman]], foundress of the La Pieta association, which has received ecclesiastical approval,&lt;ref&gt;[http://marymediatrixofallgrace.com/cbcp-endorsement-of-the-pilgrimage/ /Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines, Endorsement of pilgrimage, 1 August 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; said that Mary had declared herself to be "the Mediatrix standing in front of the Mediator".&lt;ref&gt;[http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/66814/messages-from-mama-mary June Keithley Castro, "Messages from Mama Mary" in ''Philippine Daily Inquirer'', 16 September 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Our Lady" with which the Celestial Queen and Virgin Mother shows herself in so many apparitions relies on her "setting role" near Jesus Christ God (and thus Lord and King) which is the guiding Shepherd,&lt;ref&gt;"The Lord is my shepherd" in [[Psalm 23]]:1-3&lt;/ref&gt; the delivering Saviour,&lt;ref&gt;"Refuge in the delivering Saviour" in [[Psalm 7]]:11-14&lt;/ref&gt; the Last Judge.&lt;ref&gt;"The Last Judge" in [[Psalm 94]]:1&lt;/ref&gt; In respect of the chronological order of this triplex role and function of Jesus, Mary may be titled and specified as the Mediatrix of grace, the Co-Redemptrix of salvation, the Advocate of justice.

==Continued campaigning==
Groups of laity and clergy, what has been called "a small but growing movement",&lt;ref name=ZENIT/&gt; continue to operate for proclaiming the [[dogma in the Catholic Church|dogma]] of the universal mediation of Mary.&lt;ref name=Miravalle51 &gt;Mark Miravalle, 1993, ''Introduction to Mary''. Queenship Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-882972-06-7}} page 51&lt;/ref&gt; One such group calls itself ''Vox Populi Mariae Mediatrici''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Voice of the People for Mary Mediatrix | accessdate = 2008-10-09 | url = http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/MEDIATRI.HTM }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 February 2008, five [[cardinalate|cardinals]] published a petition asking [[Pope Benedict XVI]] to declare the Blessed Virgin Mary both [[Co-Redemptrix]] and Mediatrix, and over 500 bishops later added their signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = ZENIT - Cardinals' Letter Promoting Marian Dogma | accessdate = 2008-10-09 | url = http://www.zenit.org/article-21743?l=english | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080917093954/http://www.zenit.org/article-21743?l=english | archivedate = 2008-09-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine ''[[Inside the Vatican]]'' and Saint Thomas More College organized a one-day panel discussion on the question in Rome on 25 March 2010.&lt;ref name=ZENIT&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/article-28508?l=english Robert Moynihan, "Is the Time Ripe for a 5th Marian Dogma?" in ZENIT, 1 March 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503145320/http://www.zenit.org/article-28508?l=english |date=3 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

That mariological mediation of any and the whole [[divine grace]] concerns the [[Divine Mercy#Devotion|Divine Mercy]] as the early fruit of the Glory and Graces springing from the [[Sacred Heart]] of Jesus Christ God, in the kingdom of the Divine Will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://luisapiccarreta.me/feasts/feast-of-the-sacred-heart-of-jesus-in-the-kingdom-of-the-divine-will|title= Feast of the Sacred Hearth of Jesus in the Kingdom of the Divine Will|date= November 28, 1920|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130914040133/http://luisapiccarreta.me/feasts/feast-of-the-sacred-heart-of-jesus-in-the-kingdom-of-the-divine-will|archive-date= September 14, 2013|language= en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian [[Mysticism|mystic]] [[Luisa Piccarreta]] ([[province of Bari|Corato]], 1865-1947), also known as the "Daughter of the [[Will of God|Divine Will]], wrote an opus collected in a 36-volume entitled "The Book of Heaven". Luisa's writing on the Divine Will described hundreds of dated entries of the Blessed Virgin Mary. One of these [[Theophany|epiphanic]] experiences revealed some personal details about the nativity of Jesus Christ God.

''While in the Divine Will, Luisa saw'' Jesus ''after He come forth from the Maternal womb, ''fling himself into'' the arms of His Celestial Mother. Feeling the need to make His first outpouring of love, He surrounded the neck of His mother with his tiny arms, kissing her. His Virgin Mother also felt the need to pour out her love toward the Divine Infant''.
While ''contemplating the first outpouring of love between Mother and Son'', Jesus ''told her about the great need He had to make this display of love with His Mother'' (&lt;ref name="Rega (OFS), 2017" /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;156: [V27; 09/28/1929]). ''In the Virgin was centralized all the outpouring of love which the Divinity has'' made widespread&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;in respect of the aforementioned book, the verb "had" is replaced by the expression "has made widespread", derived by the introductory context&lt;/ref&gt; ''in the Creation''. ''Since the Divine Will was in her, she was capable of receiving, ''with the kisses of the Baby Jesus'', this great outpouring, and of returning it to Him''. ''One who lives in the Divine Will centralizes within herself the continous act of all Creation, and the attitude to puring it back to God'' (&lt;ref name= "Rega (OFS), 2017" /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;157: [V27; 09/28/1929]).

In other words, the Celestial Queen and Virgin Mother of God shows a central role of her mediation in making pure the love returned to God from humans, which are living in common and in perfect accord to the life of His Divine Will, and together with His earthly and heavenly [[Holy Family]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9206">'''Medical missions''' is the term used for (typically) [[Christian mission]]ary endeavors that involve the administration of medical treatment. As has been common among missionary efforts from the 18th to 20th centuries, medical missions often involves residents of the "Western world" traveling to locales within [[Asia]], [[Africa]], or [[Latin America]].

== Background ==
In the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] repeatedly calls for his disciples to heal the sick and serve the poor, but also for them to "make disciples of all nations".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+28:16-20|title=Matthew 28:16-20 – New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In striving to obey such commands, Western Christians have debated the nature of proper [[evangelism]], often emphasizing either [[Eschatology|eschatological]], or material realities within missionary efforts. Much of Euro-American Protestantism has emphasized Jesus' eschatological and [[Soteriology|soteriological]] statements in developing theologies that emphasize personal salvation over the provision of material needs. The origins of medical missions are found in a sort of fusion of these two perspectives.

== Origins ==
In the 1830s an American missionary to China named [[Elijah Coleman Bridgman|E. C. Bridgman]] noticed that [[Medicine|Western medicine]] was more effective at removing eye cataracts than [[Traditional Chinese medicine|Chinese medicine]]. At his request, the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] sent [[Peter Parker (physician)|Peter Parker]] to China in 1834 as the first Protestant medical missionary. Western medicine provided a means by which Parker could gain access to parts of Chinese society that were otherwise closed off to missionaries. More American doctors followed suit and, in 1838, founded the world's first society for medical missions: the [[Medical Missionary Society of China]]. In 1841 Parker visited [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, and appealed to a number of the city's leading doctors. His presentation resulted in the establishment of the [[EMMS International|Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society]] which was the first medical mission society in Europe.{{sfn|Hardiman|2006|p=12}}

Another example of early medical missionary efforts is found in the work of [[David Livingstone]], the prominent explorer and missionary. Livingstone worked as a medical doctor at the mission station in Kuruman, South Africa, beginning in 1841. Livingstone became known for his abilities as a healer, but eventually tired of medical work and doubted its effectiveness as a form of Christian ministry. He ceased to practice medicine and began his exploration of Africa's interior and fight against the slave trade, for which he is most commonly remembered.{{sfn|Hardiman|2006|p=13}} Despite Livingstone's limited practice as a medical missionary, he, like Parker, influenced medical doctors to pursue careers as missionaries. The Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society had a relationship with Livingstone from 1858 until his death in 1873.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |title=Origin and Background |url=https://www.emms.org/about-emms/the-organisation/origin-and-background/ |publisher=EMMS International |access-date=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy of the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society ==
The Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society bore its name from 1843 until 2002 when it split into two separate charities: [[EMMS International]] and the [[EMMS Nazareth Hospital|Nazareth Trust]].

=== EMMS International ===
Medical missions continue in many parts of the world today. EMMS International is a missions organization that traces its origins back to the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society and credits David Livingstone as an inspiration to their ongoing efforts. According to the EMMS website: "Dr Livingstone continues to be an inspiration to EMMS International. We continue in the footsteps of Livingstone, and those like him, who sought to bring improvements in healthcare along with Christian compassion to some of the world's poorest communities."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; EMMS maintains missionary efforts in [[India]], [[Malawi]], [[Nepal]], and parts of the [[United Kingdom]].

=== The Nazareth Trust ===
The Nazareth Trust is the organization that runs [[EMMS Nazareth Hospital]] in [[Nazareth]], Israel. In 1866 the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society began supporting the work of [[Kaloost Vartan]], who had founded a medical dispensary in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Our Story |url=http://www.nazarethtrust.org/about/our-story |publisher=The Nazareth Trust |access-date=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies in medical missions ==

=== Orientalism in medical missions ===
The historian David Hardiman identifies the lasting [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] impact of medical missionaries. "The image of the social and cultural malignancy of the '[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]' that was propagated and popularised by the missionaries continues to resonate in the West to this day."{{sfn|Hardiman|2006|p=6}} The perceived superiority of Western medicine by missionaries perpetuated stereotypes that Western societies  were the "gold standard" of civilization. [[Rationalization (sociology)|Rationalized]] understandings of illness and healing were considered more sophisticated and informed than those of non-Enlightenment oriented cultures. Therefore, it was the duty of "informed", "rational", "civilized" Westerners, to bring such values to the rest of the world.

=== Science vs. spirituality ===
For Western missionaries, the "[[Christianization]]" of a place often meant more than the conversion of its residents. Western, [[Modernism|Modern]] ideologies were commonly imposed upon non-Western societies and the Christian message was conflated with Modern values. Among these values was a rationalized understanding of the cosmos, that seemingly necessitated skepticism about supernatural realities. Efforts to "modernize" or "civilize" went hand in hand with efforts to debunk what missionaries perceived as superstitious and mythological (i.e. irrational) understandings of health and healing.

=== Role of language in medical missions ===
Walima Kalusa writes about medical missions in colonial Mwinilunga, Zambia, and illustrates the difficulties that western missionaries had in achieving their goals of transforming the moral understanding of Africans. Kalusa highlights missionaries’ dependence on the linguistic knowledge of Zambian medical auxiliaries as preventing such transformation.

According to Kalusa, "European practitioners of medicine envisaged that vernacular translations [of medical terms] would be drained of 'pagan' connotations and loaded with Western notions of medicine and disease."{{sfn|Kalusa|2007|p=59}} In the case of Mwinilunga, we see the western assumption that "universal truths" of sickness and disease would reveal themselves through the implementation of western means of healing. Such perspectives, however, dismiss the possibility of different understandings of illness and health. In Mwinilunga, local people attributed supernatural properties to Western medicine, much to the chagrin of missionaries to the area.

=== Social gospel vs. true evangelism ===
Within Christian communities there has been some debate regarding the role of evangelism within medical missions. As seen in the example of David Livingstone, who questioned efficacy of medical practice as a means of evangelism, it was not uncommon to separate healthcare and proclamation of the [[gospel]] as distinct means of obeying the commands of Christ. Hardiman identifies that, "... missionaries in the field became more and more involved in [[social work]], and they often saw this as their authentic life mission. In the process, preaching became secondary."{{sfn|Hardiman|2006|p=16}} As a result, missionaries commonly received criticism for proclaiming a [[Social Gospel|social gospel]] or a sort of secular [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] agenda that undervalued religious proclamation. Debates around these issues continue today.

'''Mouhanad Khorchide''' (born September 6, 1971 in [[Beirut]]) is an [[Austria]]n [[Sociology|Sociologist]] and [[Islamic studies|Islamic theologian]], teaching as a Professor at the [[University of Münster]] in Germany.

== Personal life and studies ==
Khorchide was raised in [[Saudi-Arabia]] where his [[Palestinian territories|Palestinian]] family had fled to. At the age of 18 he emigrated to [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. There, he studied Sociology and soon became citizen of Austria. Parallel to his studies in Austria, Khorchide made Islamic studies in Beirut.

2006-2010 he worked at the [[University of Vienna]] in the fields of Islamic studies and Islamic pedagogy. Parallel to this he was [[Imam]] of a mosque near Vienna.

In 2010 Khorchide became Professor at the [[University of Münster]] in [[Germany]], at the Centre for Islamic Theology (CIT).

== Research ==
The central tenet of Khorchide's teachings is that at the heart of Islam there is mercy, not blind obedience to traditions or even violence. For Khorchide, true Islam has no contradiction to the ideals of [[humanism]] as known in the Western world. He reads the [[Quran]] as a text from the 7th century and rejects to transfer its moral teachings directly to the 21st century. Khorchide wants to read Quran and [[Hadith]] by applying the [[historical-critical method]]. According to him, this will not harm the real message of Islam but will support a better understanding of Islam.

With his approach, Khorchide attracted international attention. The [[New York Times]] wrote about him, and delegations from Islamic countries visit Münster in order to get to know more about his approach of Islamic theology. In 2016, the [[Grand Imam of al-Azhar]] [[Ahmed el-Tayeb]], who is considered by some Muslims to be the highest authority in Sunni Islam, came to Münster and talked with Mouhanad Khorchide.

The big Muslim associations in Germany reject Khorchide's approach, or at least look at it with much suspicion.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Felix Engelhardt, "[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/muwo.12168/full On Insiderism and Muslim Epistemic Communities in the German and US Study of Islam]", The Muslim World No 4, 2016, p. 750, Fn 31&lt;/ref&gt; Khorchide received death threats which is why he is living under the protection of the police.

Mouhanad Khorchide is one of the founders of the [[Muslimisches Forum Deutschland]], i.e. Muslim Forum Germany of liberal Muslims and non-Muslims.

'''Our Lady of Ipswich''' (also known as '''Our Lady of Grace''') was a popular English [[Shrines to the Virgin Mary|Marian shrine]] before the [[English Reformation]]. Only the shrine at [[Walsingham]] attracted more visitors.


==Background==
[[File:Medieval badge (FindID 84187).jpg |thumb| right|Tudor English pilgrim badge with "M" for Mary]]
There was a time when England was known as 'Our Lady's Dowry'. [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] England sheltered many shrines to the Virgin Mary: shrines were dedicated to her at [[Glastonbury]] in 540, [[Evesham]] in 702, [[Tewkesbury]] in 715, [[Canterbury]] in 866, [[Willesden]] in 939, [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]] before 955, [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] in 1020, [[Coventry]] in 1043, [[York]] in 1050, and Walsingham in 1061. By the High Middle Ages there were sixteen shrines to Mary in Suffolk alone.&lt;ref name=orthodoxeng&gt;[http://orthodoxengland.org.uk/v05i2.htm "The Mother of God of Felixstowe", Orthodox England]&lt;/ref&gt;

About half of the medieval churches in Suffolk were dedicated to St Mary under a particular [[Titles of Mary|title]] or devotion. Churches not dedicated to Mary, would have contained a Marian shrine, generally at the east end of the south aisle.
Some shrines became so popular that they were translated to buildings of their own. This may be how the shrine of Our Lady of Grace came to be.&lt;ref name=suffolk/&gt; During the High Middle Ages, the shrine of Our Lady of Grace was second only to that of [[Our Lady of Walsingham]].&lt;ref name=bbcpilgrims&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/suffolk/community/faith/2004/03/shrine/pilgrims.shtml "Shrine brings pilgrims to Ipswich", BBC, March 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The medieval town of Ipswich was a busy maritime centre of trade and shipbuilding. The inns and taverns of the town were full of pilgrims who flocked to the shrine of Our Lady of Grace in Lady Lane, near St Mary the Elm Church.&lt;ref name=sloane&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/suffolk/content/articles/2007/07/31/pilgrimage_sloane_feature.shtml Sloane, Rachel."Pilgrimage" BBC Suffolk, 6 November 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

The shrine to Our Lady of Grace at Ipswich is first recorded in 1152.&lt;ref name=elms&gt;[http://www.stmaryattheelms.org.uk/st_mary_at_the_elms/Shrine.html "The shrine of Our Lady of Grace of Ipswich", Church of St. Mary at the Elms, Ipswich]&lt;/ref&gt;  

The [[shrine]] was just outside the walls of [[Ipswich]], [[Suffolk]], [[England]].  The site of the original shrine was just outside the west gate of the medieval town wall of Ipswich, and is marked by a plaque and a statue of Our Lady on Lady Lane.&lt;ref name=bbcpilgrims/&gt; 

In 1297 the daughter of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], Princess Elizabeth, married the Count of Holland in the shrine.&lt;ref name=suffolk&gt;[http://www.suffolkchurches.co.uk/ipsolg.htm "Shrine of Our Lady of Grace", Ipswich, Suffolk Churches]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among surviving mentions, it is recorded that Sir John Howard paid a visit in August 1463, when his main residence was at [[Stoke-by-Nayland]]. On that occasion he apparently left an offering of 2d. At a visit on 5 May, the now Lord Howard spent a total of 10s on a pilgrimage to the shrine. At a visit on 22 January 1472 he left 10d. John Howard was of royal descendant and   at least by 1470 an extremely wealthy man, a grandson of [[Thomas de Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk]] from 1397, whose line had failed in 1476, and though the title had been held briefly by Prince Richard, one of the ill-fated little princes in the Tower, it was created again on 28 June 1483 for John Howard, who had shown himself a close friend and loyal supporter of the usurping King [[Richard III of England|Richard III]]. It was, therefore, now as the new Duke of Norfolk that Howard visited the shrine again, on 16 August 1483, leaving an offering of 20d, then 4d "to bow on Owr Ladys fote" (presumably a particularl offering on kissing the foot of the statue) and also 11d "in almes at Owr Lady of Grace".&lt;ref&gt; John Ashdown-Hill ''Suffolk Connections of the House of York'', in ''Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archeology and History'' 41 (2006) part 2,  p. 203  &lt;/ref&gt;  Howard was to die with his royal patron at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field|Battle of Bosworth]] on 22 August 1485.

After the Tudor dynasty had consolidated its hold on the English throne, Henry VII's Queen, Elizabeth of York, made a donation in 1502 of half a golden angel (3s 4d) to the shrine.
&lt;ref&gt; John Ashdown-Hill ''Suffolk Connections of the House of York'', in ''Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archeology and History'' 41 (2006) part 2,  p. 203  &lt;/ref&gt; 

Between 1517 and 1522, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and Queen [[Catherine of Aragon]] paid separate visits to the shrine, as did [[Sir Thomas More]] and Cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey]], who was born in Ipswich.&lt;ref name=elms/&gt;

==An Early 16th-century Miracle==
The image of the Virgin at Ipswich became celebrated on account of a miraculous power of healing attributed to Our Lady of Grace.&lt;ref name=orthodoxeng/&gt;

A miracle at the shrine of Our Lady of Ipswich is recorded by none other than [[Sir Thomas More]] in his book ''The Supplication of Souls'', and he had news of it on first-hand knowledge.  The miracle was bestowed on Anne Wentworth, the 12-year-old daughter of Sir Roger Wentworth, a friend of More's. Anne suffered from seizures in which she spasmed, blasphemed and was said to be able to utter prophesy ''"vexed and tourmented by our gostly enemye the devyll"''. After a vision in which she beheld the image of Our Lady of Grace at Ipswich, she was taken to the shrine and ''"layde before the ymage of our Blessyd Lady....grevously tourmented and in face, eyen, loke and countenance so grysely chaunged...that it was a terrible syght to beholde". '' There in the presence of the whole company, she was restored ''"perfytely and sodeynly"''.  Anne, in grateful recognition of the miracle, took the veil and became a nun.

==Destruction== 
The shrine was suppressed during the English Reformation, and its famous statue was taken to [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] to be burnt, along with the statue of Our Lady of Walsingham on 20 September 1538.  There are no eyewitness accounts of the statue actually being burnt, although it is documented that the statue arrived at Chelsea. Regarding the image, Thomas Cromwell's steward wrote to him that he had received it, with 'nothing about her but two half shoes of silver'.&lt;ref name=suffolk/&gt;

Although  the shrine itself was destroyed, mention of it survived in legal deeds as a boundary description until the eighteenth century.

==The Statue in Nettuno==
[[File:OL Ipswich.jpg|thumb|Our Lady of Ipswich, now venerated in Nettuno, Lazio, Italy]]
A wooden statue of the [[Madonna and Child]] displayed in the local church of the [[Italy|Italian]] seaside town of [[Nettuno]] closely matches various descriptions of the Ipswich statue. The statue is known locally as "Our Lady of the Graces" or "The English Lady".&lt;ref name=elms/&gt; Radio carbon dating places the era when the tree was felled to provide the wood of which the statue is carved at circa 1280 to 1420 with 94% certainty.&lt;ref name=CEDAD&gt;Historical society of Nettuno "La Stella del Mare" commissioned [http://www.lastelladelmare.it/storiamadonna/simulacro-madonna University of Salento Dept of Engineering] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305001522/http://www.lastelladelmare.it/storiamadonna/simulacro-madonna |date=5 March 2016 }} Radio carbon dating analysis report (in pdf format)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence in the Nettuno archives that a statue arrived there from Ipswich in 1550.&lt;ref name=suffolk/&gt;&lt;ref name=santuario&gt;Description (in Italian) of the history of the Madonna della Gracia statue at Nettuno's [http://www.santuarionettuno.it/index7.html Shrine Basilica "Santuario Nostra Signora delle Grazie e Santa Maria Goretti"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230200839/http://www.santuarionettuno.it/index7.html |date=30 December 2014 }} accessed 7-9-2014&lt;/ref&gt; It was classified as being in the English iconic style in 1938 by Martin Gillett, an historian of 13th century [[iconography]]. Although the statue had been altered (a throne had been replaced and the posture of the Christ child had changed), details such as the folds in the material and Christ's position on the right rather than the left knee suggest that the statue came from England.

At the time of the bombardment of Anzio during the Second World War, Nettuno's statue was temporarily moved to Rome for safe keeping.&lt;ref name=society/&gt;

During restoration work on the statue in 1959 an inscription was found on its back with the words ''IU? ARET GRATIOSUS'', a rendition of the Marian phrase, "Thou art gracious". Ipswich was the only Marian shrine in England dedicated to Our Lady of Grace. Even more striking, when Martin Gillett first examined the statue in 1938, it was wearing two half shoes made of English silver, just like those described by Thomas Cromwell's steward 400 years before.

There are two theories as to how the statue may have reached Italy. One theory is that it was sold by an English official (perhaps [[Thomas Cromwell]]) instead of being burnt, although it is not clear why it would have got as far as southern Italy.

A second version of the story, popular in Nettuno,  is that the statue was rescued by English sailors before it could be burnt, and smuggled on board a ship.  In the Mediterranean they met a storm and took refuge in Nettuno and they donated the statue.&lt;ref name=sloane/&gt;  Moreover, a scientific analysis of a sliver of wood from the base of the statue has been found to have a high salt content - proving that it had at some point been in contact with seawater or sea spray.

As part of the Nettuno celebrations, thousands watch as the statue is taken down from high above the altar in the Basilica and, dressed in her finery, is taken in a grand procession through the streets for a week-long stay at the church of St. Giovanni.&lt;ref name=sloane/&gt; A replica of the statue was presented to [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in Rome on 5 May 2010, during the week of the Shrine's feast, beginning the first Sunday of May.&lt;ref name=madonna&gt;Picture of a replica of the [http://www.anzionettuno.info/printable.asp?idnews=3193 Madonna della Grazia of Nettuno statue, at "AnzioNettunoinfo", accessed 7-10-2014] present during a Wednesday audience with Pope Benedict in Rome, 5 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern devotion==
[[File:Gardenpond.jpeg|thumb|A modern replica of Our Lady of Ipswich at [[Saint Pancras Church, Ipswich]]]]
A modern shrine is now in the [[Anglican]] parish church of [[Saint Mary Elms]], a short distance away from the medieval location.

In 1987, the [[Guild of Our Lady of Ipswich]] was founded by people from the [[Catholic]] church of [[St Pancras Church, Ipswich|St Pancras]] and the [[Anglican church]] of [[St Mary at the Elms]]. Their two aims have been: to pray for Christian unity and to plan and achieve the re-establishment of the shrine of Our Lady of Grace at Ipswich.

On 10 September 2002 a modern wooden replica of the Italian statue, carved by sculptor Robert Mellamphy,&lt;ref name=society&gt;[http://www.ipswichsociety.org.uk/newsletter/dispart.php?issue=151&amp;art=12 Lewis, Diana. "Our Lady of Ipswich", The Ipswich Society Newsletter, Issue 151, April 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; was blessed and installed by the Anglican [[Bishop of Richborough]] in the church of [[Saint Mary at the Elms]]. The ceremony was attended by the Anglican [[Bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich]], the Roman Catholic Dean of Ipswich and representatives of the [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and the [[Methodist]] churches.

The '''Palm Tree King''' was one of the monsters later known as the "Slain Heroes" in the Sumerian epic, Lugale, which centred on the quest of [[Ninurta]] (a.k.a. [[Lugalbanda]]) to recover the [[Tablets of Destiny]], which were stolen by the Slain Heroes, from Ninurta's father, [[Enlil]], the angry, jealous God of Air, and early head of the [[Mesopotamian mythology|Sumerian pantheon]] (though replaced as other gods came into favour). The Palm Tree King, in the Lugale epic, was subservient to [[Zu (mythology)|Imdugud]] (Assyrian Anzu), who held the Tablets until his defeat in combat with Ninurta.

Very little is known about the Palm Tree King, but he seems to be the only one of the "Slain Heroes" to have escaped from Ninurta, and remains free to continue his mischief in the world.

In [[Judaism]], a '''rabbi''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|æ|b|aɪ}} is a teacher of [[Torah]]. The basic form of the rabbi developed in the [[Pharisees|Pharisaic]] and [[Talmud]]ic era, when learned teachers assembled to codify Judaism's written and oral laws. The first sage for whom the [[Mishnah]] uses the title of rabbi was [[Yohanan ben Zakkai]], active in the early-to-mid first century CE.&lt;ref name="Hezser1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hezser|first=Catherine|title=The Social Structure of the Rabbinic Movement in Roman Palestine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bKMkEVSvCoUC&amp;pg=PA64|year=1997|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|isbn=978-3-16-146797-4|pages=64–|quote=We suggest that the avoidance of the title "Rabbi" for pre-70 sages may have originated with the editors of the Mishnah. The editors attributed the title to some sages and not to others. The avoidance of the title for pre-70 sages may perhaps be seen as a deliberate program on the part of these editors who wanted to create the impression that the “rabbinic movement" began with R. Yochanan b. Zakkai and that the Yavnean "academy" was something new, a notion that is sometimes already implicitly or explicitly suggested by some of the traditions available to them. This notion is not diminished by the occasional claim to continuity with the past which was limited to individual teachers and institutions and served to legitimize rabbinic authority.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180208031241/https://books.google.com/books?id=bKMkEVSvCoUC&amp;pg=PA64|archivedate=February 8, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent centuries, the duties of a rabbi became increasingly influenced by the duties of the [[Clergy|Protestant Christian minister]], hence the title "[[pulpit]] rabbis", and in 19th-century Germany and the United States rabbinic activities including [[sermon]]s, pastoral counseling, and representing the community to the outside, all increased in importance.

Within the various [[Jewish denominations]] there are different requirements for rabbinic ordination, and differences in opinion regarding who is to be recognized as a rabbi. For example, [[Orthodox Judaism]] does not ordain women as rabbis. Non-Orthodox movements have chosen to do so for what they view as halakhic reasons ([[Conservative Judaism]]) as well as ethical reasons ([[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]]).&lt;ref name="forward1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/106320/ |title=Orthodox Women To Be Trained As Clergy, If Not Yet as Rabbis – |publisher=Forward.com |accessdate=May 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206073454/http://www.forward.com/articles/106320/ |archivedate=December 6, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''PRI.org'' [http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-11-09/can-orthodox-jewish-women-be-rabbis Can Orthodox Jewish Women be Rabbis?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112190207/http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-11-09/can-orthodox-jewish-women-be-rabbis |date=January 12, 2016 }}, November 9, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word "master" {{Hebrew|רב}} ''{{transl|he|rav}}'' {{IPA-he|ˈʀäv|}}, (irregular plural {{Hebrew|רבנים}} ''{{transl|he|rabanim}}'' {{IPA-he|ʀäbäˈnim|}}), which literally means "great one", [[:he:רב|is the original Hebrew form of the title]]. The form of the title in English and many other languages derives from the [[Modern Hebrew grammar#Possession|possessive form in Hebrew]] of ''{{transl|he|rav}}'': {{Hebrew|רַבִּי}} ''{{transl|he|rabbi}}'' {{IPA-he|ˈʀäbbi|}}, meaning "&lt;u&gt;My&lt;/u&gt; Master", which is the way a student would address a master of Torah. 
The word 'Rav' in turn derives from the [[Semitic root]] ר-ב-ב (R-B-B), which in [[The Bible|biblical]] [[Aramaic]] means "great" in many senses, including "revered", but appears primarily as a prefix in construct forms.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz-Josef Fabry entry ''Rab'' in ''Theological dictionary of the Old Testament'' Vol.13 p273-5 ed. G. Johannes Botterweck, [[:sv:Helmer Ringgren]], [[Heinz-Josef Fabry|Fabry]] 2004 p273 "RAB... is also well attested in Phoenician.9 Here too rab functions as a title; its specific meaning can be determined only by its relationship to other offices and functions.10 Aramaic in all its dialects makes copious use of this root."&lt;/ref&gt; Although the usage ''rabbim'' "many" (as 1 Kings 18:25, הָרַבִּים) "the majority, the multitude" occurs for the assembly of the community in the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] there is no evidence to support an association with the later title "Rabbi."&lt;ref&gt;[[Heinz-Josef Fabry|Fabry]] entry ''Rab'' in ''Theological dictionary of the Old Testament'' Volume 13 – Page 298 G. Johannes Botterweck, Helmer Ringgren, Heinz-Josef Fabry – 2004 "There is no evidence to support an association, commonly cited in discussions of this usage.160 with the use of the title "Rabbi" ... Already suggested by [[Millar Burrows|M. Burrows]] and repeated by [[Jean Carmignac|Carmignac]], 584 "&lt;/ref&gt;
The root is [[cognate]] to [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ربّ ''rabb'', meaning "lord" (generally used when talking about God, but also about temporal lords). As a sign of great respect, some great rabbis are simply called "The Rav".

Rabbi is not an occupation found in the [[Hebrew Bible]], and ancient generations did not employ related titles such as ''Rabban'', ''Ribbi''&lt;!-- thus (Ribbi, not Rabbi) according to virtually all old manuscripts/prints--&gt;, or ''Rab'' to describe either the Babylonian sages or the sages in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;This is evident from the fact that [[Hillel I]], who came from [[Babylon]], did not have the title ''Rabban'' prefixed to his name.&lt;/ref&gt; The titles "Rabban" and "Rabbi" are first mentioned in the [[Mishnah]] (c. 200 CE). The term was first used for [[Gamliel I|Rabban Gamaliel the elder]], Rabban [[Simeon ben Gamliel|Simeon his son]], and [[Yohanan ben Zakkai|Rabban Johanan ben Zakkai]], all of whom were patriarchs or presidents of the [[Sanhedrin]] in the first century.&lt;ref&gt;The title ''Ribbi'' too, came into vogue among those who received the laying on of hands at this period, as, for instance, [[Rabbi Zadok|Ribbi Zadok]], [[Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob|Ribbi Eliezer ben Jacob]], and others, and dates from the time of the disciples of [[Yohanan ben Zakkai|Rabban Johanan ben Zakkai]] downward. Now the order of these titles is as follows: ''Ribbi'' is greater than ''Rab''; ''Rabban'' again, is greater than ''Ribbi''; while the simple name is greater than ''Rabban''. Besides the presidents of the Sanhedrin no one is called ''Rabban''.&lt;/ref&gt; The title "Rabbi" occurs (in Greek transliteration ῥαββί ''rhabbi'') in the books of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], and [[Gospel of John|John]] in the [[New Testament]], where it is used in reference to "Scribes and [[Pharisees]]" as well as to [[Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Englishman's Greek Concordance of the New Testament'' by Wigram, George V.; citing Matthew 26:25, Mark 9:5 and John 3:2 (among others)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Hezser, ''The social structure of the rabbinic movement in Roman Palestine'', 1997, page 59 "'''b – Rabbi as an Honorary Address''' ...&amp;nbsp;Since Jesus was called "Rabbi" but did not conform to the traditional image of post-70 Jewish rabbis, and since pre-70 sages do not bear the title "Rabbi" in the Mishnah,29 most scholars assume that the meaning and usage of the term "Rabbi" at the time of Jesus differed from the meaning which it acquired after the destruction of the Temple: in pre-70 times, "Rabbi" was used as an unofficial honorary address for any person held in high esteem; after 70 it was almost exclusively applied to ordained teachers of the Law."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pronunciation==
[[Sephardic]] and [[Yemenite Jews]] pronounce this word {{Hebrew|רִבִּי}} ''ribbī'' ; the [[Israeli Hebrew|modern Israeli]] pronunciation {{Hebrew|רַבִּי}} ''rabi'' is derived from an 18th-century innovation in [[Ashkenazic]] [[siddur|prayer books]], although this vocalization is also found in some ancient sources. Other variants are ''rəvī'' and, in [[Yiddish]], ''rebbə''. The word could be compared to the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] word {{lang|syr|ܪܒܝ}} ''rabi''.

In ancient Hebrew, ''rabbi'' was a proper term of address while speaking to a superior, in the [[Grammatical person|second person]], similar to a [[vocative case]]. While speaking about a superior, in the [[grammatical person|third person]] one could say ''ha-rav'' ("the Master") or ''rabbo'' ("his Master"). Later, the term evolved into a formal title for members of the [[Patriarch]]ate. Thus, the title gained an irregular plural form: {{Hebrew|רַבָּנִים}} ''rabbanim'' ("rabbis"), and not {{Hebrew|רַבָּי}} ''rabbay'' ("my Masters").

==Historical overview==
The governments of the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] were based on a system that included the [[Kings of Israel and Judah|Jewish kings]], the Jewish prophets, the legal authority of the high court of Jerusalem, the Great [[Sanhedrin]], and the ritual authority of the [[Kohen|priesthood]]. Members of the Sanhedrin had to receive their ordination (''[[semicha]]'') in an uninterrupted line of transmission from [[Moses]], yet rather than being referred to as rabbis they were called priests or scribes, like Ezra, who is called in the Bible "Ezra, the priest, the scribe, a scribe of the words of God's commandments and of His statutes unto Israel."&lt;ref&gt;Ezra 7:11.&lt;/ref&gt; "Rabbi" as a religious title does not appear in the Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref&gt;The term rabbi as a religious title does appear in the New Testament. {{cite web |url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/encyclopedias/isbe/rabbi.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110162436/http://www.biblestudytools.com/encyclopedias/isbe/rabbi.html |archivedate=January 10, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the above personalities would have been expected to be steeped in the wisdom of the [[Torah]] and the [[613 mitzvot|commandments]], which would have made them "rabbis" in the modern sense of the word. This is illustrated by a two-thousand-year-old teaching in the [[Mishnah]], ''[[Ethics of the Fathers]]'' (''Pirkei Avot''), which observed about [[King David]],

:"One who learns from their companion a single chapter, a single [[halakha]], a single verse, a single [[Torah]] statement, or even a single letter, must treat them with honor. For so we find with David King of Israel, who learned nothing from [[Ahitophel]] except two things, yet called him his teacher [Hebrew text: ''rabbo''], his guide, his intimate, as it is said: 'You are a man of my measure, my guide, my intimate' ([[Psalms]] 55:14). One can derive from this the following: If David King of Israel who learned nothing from Ahitophel except for two things, called him his teacher, his guide, his intimate, one who learns from their companion a single chapter, a single halakha, a single verse, a single statement, or even a single letter, how much more must they treat them with honor. And honor is due only for Torah, as it is said: 'The wise shall inherit honor' ([[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 3:35), 'and the perfect shall inherit good' (Proverbs 28:10). And only Torah is truly good, as it is said: 'I have given you a good teaching, do not forsake My Torah' (Proverbs 4:2)." (''Ethics of the Fathers'' 6:3)

With the destruction of the two [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temples in Jerusalem]], the end of the Jewish monarchy, and the decline of the dual institutions of prophets and the priesthood, the focus of scholarly and spiritual leadership within the Jewish people shifted to the sages of the [[Great Assembly|Men of the Great Assembly]] (''Anshe Knesset HaGedolah''). This assembly was composed of the earliest group of "rabbis" in the more modern sense of the word, in large part because they began the formulation and explication of what became known as Judaism's "[[Oral law#Oral law in Judaism|Oral Law]]" (''Torah SheBe'al Peh''). This was eventually encoded and codified within the [[Mishnah]] and [[Talmud]] and subsequent rabbinical scholarship, leading to what is known as [[Rabbinic Judaism]].

===Sages===
The title "Rabbi" was borne by the sages of ancient Israel, who were ordained by the [[Sanhedrin]] in accordance with the custom handed down by the elders. They were titled ''Ribbi'' and received authority to judge penal cases. ''Rab'' was the title of the [[Talmud|Babylonian sage]]s who taught in the [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia|Babylonian academies]].

After the suppression of the [[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Patriarchate]] and Sanhedrin by [[Theodosius II]] in 425, there was no more formal ordination in the strict sense. A recognised scholar could be called ''Rab'' or ''Hacham'', like the Babylonian sages. The transmission of learning from master to disciple remained of tremendous importance, but there was no formal rabbinic qualification as such.

===Middle Ages===
[[Maimonides]] ruled that every congregation is obliged to appoint a preacher and scholar to admonish the community and teach Torah, and the social institution he describes is the germ of the modern congregational rabbinate. In the fifteenth century in Central Europe, the custom grew up of licensing scholars with a diploma entitling them to be called ''Mori'' (my teacher). At the time this was objected to as ''hukkat ha-goy'' (imitating the ways of the Gentiles), as it was felt to resemble the conferring of doctorates in Christian universities. However, the system spread, and it is this diploma that is referred to as ''semicha'' (ordination) at the present day.

===18th–19th centuries===
In 19th-century Germany and the United States, the duties of the rabbi in some respects became increasingly similar to the duties of other clergy, like the [[Clergy|Protestant Christian minister]], and the title "[[pulpit]] rabbis" appeared to describe this phenomenon. [[Sermon]]s, pastoral counseling, representing the community to the outside, all increased in importance. Non-Orthodox rabbis, on a day-to-day business basis, now spend more time on these functions than they do teaching or answering questions on Jewish law and philosophy. Within the Modern [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] community, many rabbis still mainly deal with teaching and questions of Jewish law, but many are increasingly dealing with these same pastoral functions. [[Orthodox Judaism]]'s [[National Council of Young Israel]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]]'s [[Rabbinical Council of America]] have set up supplemental pastoral training programs for their rabbis.

Traditionally, rabbis have never been an intermediary between [[Names of God in Judaism|God]] and humans. This idea was traditionally considered outside the bounds of [[Jewish theology]]. Unlike spiritual leaders in many other faiths, they are not considered to be imbued with special powers or abilities.
[[File:Rabi with kids.JPG|thumb|200px|Rabbi instructing children in 2004]]

===Functions===
Rabbis serve the Jewish community. Hence their functions vary as the needs of the Jewish community vary over time and from place to place.

A dramatic change in rabbinic functions occurred with [[Jewish emancipation]] (18th-19th cents.). Tasks that were once the primary focus for rabbis, such as settling disputes by presiding over a Jewish court, became less prominent, while other tasks that were secondary, like delivering sermons, increased in importance.

'''1. Study and teaching.''' Rabbis have always been the main links in the chain of transmission (''masorah'') whereby knowledge of the Torah has been passed down through the generations.&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah, Avot, chap. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Learning from their teachers, adding new insights of their own (''hidushim''), and teaching the public have always been the primary functions of the rabbinate. Studying the Torah is a rabbi's lifelong undertaking that does not end with receiving ordination. A rabbi is expected to set aside time daily for study. A rabbi that does not constantly replenish his or her store of Torah learning will lack the knowledge, inspiration and mastery of Jewish law and traditions required to perform all other rabbinic functions.

Once acquired, Torah knowledge must be passed on, because it is the heritage of all Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 33:4.&lt;/ref&gt; Teaching by rabbis occurs in many venues—the schoolroom of course, elementary (''heder''), intermediate (''yeshivah'') and advanced (''kollel''), but also, especially in antiquity, in the vineyard, the marketplace and the disciple circle.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Goodblatt, ''Rabbinic Instruction In Sasanian Babylonia,'' Brill, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; In many synagogues, the rabbi will give a short daily class to those who attend morning or evening services. The sermon is another form of public education, often integrating Biblical passages with a contemporary ethical message,&lt;ref&gt;Marc Saperstein, ''Jewish Preaching,'' Yale, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; and no Jewish meal or celebration is complete without the rabbi's "''d'var Torah''"—a short explanation of Biblical verses related to the event.

Apart from face to face instruction, rabbis who are inclined to authorship have composed an extensive [[rabbinic literature]], dealing with all aspects of the Jewish tradition—Bible commentaries, codes of law, responsa, mystical and ethical tracts, and collections of sermons are examples of common genres of rabbinic literature.

'''2. Judging'''. Prior to emancipation, rulers delegated discipline and dispute settlement within the Jewish community (''kahal'') to the Jewish community itself. If a dispute, domestic or commercial, a tort or a petty crime, involved only Jewish residents, then it could be settled in the town's Jewish court according to Jewish law. The town rabbi, with his extensive knowledge of Torah law (''halakhah''), was expected to preside as Head of the Court (''av beth din''),&lt;ref&gt;S. Schwarzfuchs, ''Concise History of the Rabbinate,'' 1993, pp. 51-53.&lt;/ref&gt; although lay assessors might join him in judgment. The judgments were enforced with fines and various degrees of communal excommunication when necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5933-excommunication|title=EXCOMMUNICATION - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220180034/http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5933-excommunication|archivedate=February 20, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After emancipation, Jews, as citizens of their countries, turned to civil courts for dispute resolution. Today rabbinical courts remain active under the auspices of each Jewish denomination for religious matters, such as conversion and divorce, and even, on a voluntary basis, for civil matters when the parties voluntarily elect to have the rabbinical judges serve as their arbitrators.&lt;ref&gt;"Rabbinical Courts: Modern Day Solomons," 6 Colum J.L. &amp; Soc. Probs. 49 (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; In Israel there are rabbinical courts for matters of personal status.

3. '''Legislating'''. During the centuries of Jewish self-government, some problems were considered regional or universal and could not be solved by a single rabbi acting alone. At these times rabbinical synods were convened for concerted action, calling together the prominent rabbis of the region to debate solutions and enact binding regulations (''takkanot'') for their communities. The regulations involved matters as diverse as dowries and matrimonial law, relations with gentiles, utilizing civil courts, education of orphans, anti-counterfeiting measures, and the hiring of schoolteachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14204-takkanah|title=TAḲḲANAH - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108185942/http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14204-takkanah|archivedate=January 8, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous of these ordinances is ascribed to Rabbenu Gershom of Mainz (c. 960-1040), but was probably enacted in a rabbinic synod he convened c. 1000 C.E.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6615-gershom-ben-judah |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108093912/http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6615-gershom-ben-judah |archivedate=January 8, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ordinance, still in effect today, prohibits polygamy among Jews in the West.

In the modern era rabbis have enacted ''takkanot'' in the State of Israel,&lt;ref&gt;Dorff and Roset, ''A Living Tree,'' SUNY, 1988, p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt; and the major Jewish movements, such as Reform, Conservative and Reconstructionist, enact ''takkanot'' for their members. Today most congregational rabbis are members of a national rabbinic organization related to their movement&lt;ref&gt;These include the Central Council of American Rabbis for Reform rabbis, {{cite web |url=https://ccarnet.org/about-us/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108095325/https://ccarnet.org/about-us/ |archivedate=January 8, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}, the Rabbinical Council of America for Orthodox rabbis, {{cite web |url=http://www.rabbis.org/about_us.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024095458/http://www.rabbis.org/about_us.cfm |archivedate=October 24, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}, and the Rabbinical Assembly for Conservative rabbis, {{cite web |url=http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2001-10-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011129090316/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/ |archivedate=November 29, 2001 |df=mdy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and also an association of local rabbis in their city. When these bodies debate local and national questions, they function in a manner that is similar to the rabbinic synods of the past.

'''4. Religious supervision'''. The Jewish community requires a number of religious institutions for daily life, and it falls to rabbis, with their knowledge of Jewish law, to supervise them to ensure they operate in accordance with Jewish law. Examples would be Jewish slaughter (''shekhita''), Jewish dietary laws in shops and institutions (''kashrut''), the ritual bath (''mikveh''), the elementary school (''heder''), the Sabbath boundaries (''eruvin''), and the burial society (''hevra kadisha''). Traditionally this function fell to the town's rabbi. In the modern era, rabbis who specialize in this type of supervision will find full-time employment as a [[Mashgiach]] (supervisor of ritual law), and some of these functions are now performed by national organizations, such as the Orthodox Union which offers kosher certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oukosher.org/|title=OU Kosher: Certification and Supervision by the Orthodox Union|website=OU Kosher Certification|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228185202/https://oukosher.org/|archivedate=December 28, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''5. Pastoral counseling.''' All rabbis will answer questions about Jewish law and Jewish rituals from their congregants. In addition, members of the Jewish community have always turned to rabbis for advice on personal matters. This is conducted in private on a one-to-one basis. In the pre-modern era, rabbis had no special training in counseling. Instead they relied on their personal qualities of empathy and caring as well as their knowledge of ''halakhic'' requirements. These factors continue to inform rabbinic advising in the modern era. However modern rabbinical seminaries have instituted courses in psychology and pastoral counseling as part of the required rabbinic curriculum and they offer internships in counseling and social services for their rabbinical students. Among Hasidic Jews, turning to the ''rebbe'' for advice on personal matters is common.

'''6. Leading prayer services.''' Traditionally rabbis did not lead prayer services in the modern sense. There is no requirement that a rabbi be present for public prayer. The Jewish liturgy is fixed and printed in prayer books (''siddurim''), the vocal portions are chanted by a cantor (''hazan'') and the Torah portion is read by a trained reader (''ba'al kriah''). If the rabbi was present, he would be seated in front near the Ark and as a matter of respect, the pace at which the rabbi recited his prayers might set the pace of the service. If halakhic questions arose about the prayer service, the rabbi would answer them.

In modern synagogues, the rabbi takes a more active role in leading prayer services. In some synagogues, it is permitted for the rabbi to select passages from the prayer book for public reading, to omit some passages for brevity and to add special prayers to the service. The rabbi may lead the congregation in responsive reading, announce page numbers and comment on the liturgy from time to time. At Sabbath and holiday services, the congregational rabbi will deliver a sermon either right before or right after the Torah is read.

'''7. Celebrating life's events.''' Jewish law does not require the presence of a rabbi at a marriage, bar or bat mitzvah, circumcision, funeral, house of mourning, or unveiling of a monument at a cemetery. At the same time, Jewish law has prescribed requirements for each of these events and rituals. It therefore became customary for rabbis to be present and to lead the community in celebration and in mourning. In the modern era, it is virtually obligatory to have the rabbi's participation at these events, and ministering to the congregation in these settings has become a major aspect of the modern rabbinate.

Jewish divorce, which requires a rabbinical court (''beth din''), will always have rabbis in attendance.

'''8. Charitable works.''' The synagogue has been a place where charity is collected every weekday after services and then distributed to the needy before Sabbaths and holidays. It was not the rabbi who collected these sums; that task was assigned to the sexton, wardens of charity and charitable associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4248-charity-and-charitable-institutions |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113105711/http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4248-charity-and-charitable-institutions |archivedate=January 13, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; But it was the rabbi's task to teach that charity (''tzedakah'') is a core Jewish value. The rabbi did this by preaching, teaching and by example—hosting poor out of town yeshiva students at the home table and offering Jewish travelers a kosher meal. [[Moses Maimonides]] formulated a ladder consisting of eight degrees of charity, starting with reluctant giving and ending with teaching someone a trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Levels_of_Giving.html|title=Eight Levels of Charitable Giving|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112135746/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Levels_of_Giving.html|archivedate=January 12, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi [[Israel Salanter]] (1809-1883) was once asked, "How do you provide for your spiritual needs?" He answered, "By providing for someone else's physical needs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rabbisacks.org/credo-someone-elses-material-needs-are-my-spiritual-responsibility/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113131747/http://www.rabbisacks.org/credo-someone-elses-material-needs-are-my-spiritual-responsibility/ |archivedate=January 13, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today Jewish federations and foundations collect and distribute most charity within the Jewish community. However the rabbi retains the task of teaching the value of charity and often participates personally in appeals for the synagogue and for national and international causes.

'''9. Role-modeling.''' The rabbi serves as a role model for the congregation by his or her conduct and deportment. Congregation members are keen observers of their rabbi's personality traits, family life, professional conduct, leisure activities and in general the way he or she treats others. Rabbis are aware of this and in the best case deliberately model their conduct so that it represents Jewish values to the community and to outsiders.

This aspect of the rabbinate, setting an example for the public, has a direct application in Jewish law. The way the greatest rabbis and Torah scholars conducted themselves can become a precedent in Jewish law, known as ''ma'aseh.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0013_0_12945.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605031854/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0013_0_12945.html |archivedate=June 5, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, based on reports of what rabbis did in the Talmud, [[Moses Maimonides]] ruled that one engaged in public affairs should not break off his duties to recite certain prayers.&lt;ref&gt;Mishneh Torah, Kri'at Shema 2:5.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''10. Outreach.''' Some rabbis program and guide activities designed to reach Jews who are unaffiliated with Judaism or lapsed in their observances. These include "Beginners' Services" where the Jewish liturgy is shortened and explained, and Shabbatons, where unaffiliated Jews are hosted by an observant family during Sabbath to experience the day in a religious setting and to learn about its rituals and customs. [[Chabad outreach]], known as ''kiruv'' (bringing close), finds many rabbis and their spouses posted in Chabad Houses worldwide for the express purpose of reaching unaffiliated Jews.

'''11. Conversions. '''Most rabbis will from time to time encounter someone who is not Jewish seeking information about Judaism or wishing to explore [[conversion to Judaism]]. This may happen when one member of a couple wishing to marry is seeking conversion or on other occasions when intermarriage is not involved. Based on the rabbi's training and assessment of the person's motivations and goals, the rabbi's approach may range from discouragement of the potential convert to mentoring and directing to a conversion class, in accordance with the policy on conversion of the rabbi's movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/conversion-to-judaism/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126044405/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/conversion-to-judaism/ |archivedate=January 26, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One or three rabbis will serve on the ''beth din'' that performs a conversion. There are no rabbis serving as "Jewish missionaries" per se; there is no parallel in Judaism to the proselytizing of other faiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/beliefs/conversion.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Judaism: Converting to Judaism|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201120016/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/beliefs/conversion.shtml|archivedate=December 1, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''12. Match-making.''' In periods when match-making was common, rabbis participated.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey I. Roth, ''Inheriting the Crown in Jewish Law,'' Univ. of So. Carolina Press, 2006, pp. 29, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbis were well-acquainted with their community members and in particular with the young unmarried men attending their yeshivas. Parents did not hesitate to consult the rabbi for suitable matches. Today in Orthodox circles where socializing among the sexes is not common, this practice continues, and in all branches of Judaism, a rabbi who can help in this arena will not hesitate to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-02-16/local/me-4431_1_religious-persuasion|title=Rabbi Plays Cupid in Bid to Keep Faith Among Jews : Matchmaking: His concern that many are marrying non-Jews prompts him to establish dating service so that singles may find others of same religious persuasion.|first=KIM|last=HALVERSON|date=February 16, 1992|publisher=|via=LA Times|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116191008/http://articles.latimes.com/1992-02-16/local/me-4431_1_religious-persuasion|archivedate=January 16, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''13. Synagogue administration.''' The modern synagogue is a non-profit religious corporation run by a Board of Directors elected by the members. However, on a day-to-day basis, board members are not present. In most synagogues, it is the rabbi's task to administer the synagogue, supervise personnel, manage the physical plant, review (if not write) the newsletter, and interact with the brotherhood, the sisterhood and the youth organizations. Very large synagogues may employ a separate administrator or assistant rabbi to perform some or all of these functions.

'''14. Chaplaincy.'''[[File:USAF Jewish Chaplain Insignia.jpg|Air Force&lt;br/&gt;Current Jewish Chaplain insignia, with Hebrew letters|thumb|right|Jewish chaplain insignia, U.S. Air Force.]]Rabbis go into the field wherever members of the Jewish community may be found. This is most noticeable in the military services and on university campuses where some rabbis serve as Jewish chaplains on a full-time basis. All branches of the U. S. military have Jewish chaplains in their ranks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcca.org/what-we-do/jwb/become-a-chaplain/|title=Become a Chaplain: Serving Jews Who Serve - JCC Association|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108093726/http://jcca.org/what-we-do/jwb/become-a-chaplain/|archivedate=January 8, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rabbis serve in the Israeli Defense Forces. The Hillel Foundation provides rabbis and Jewish services on 550 campuses &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hillel.org/|title=Hillel International - The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life at Colleges and Universities|website=hillel.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231055441/http://www.hillel.org/|archivedate=December 31, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Chabad operates Jewish centers with a rabbi near 150 college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.edu/templates/articlecco_cdo/aid/387553/jewish/About.htm|title=About - Chabad on Campus International|website=www.chabad.edu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108093924/http://www.chabad.edu/templates/articlecco_cdo/aid/387553/jewish/About.htm|archivedate=January 8, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local rabbis perform other chaplaincy functions on a part-time basis in hospitals, senior homes and prisons.

Worthy of mention are the rabbis who accompanied Jews to concentration camps during the Nazi era; in dire circumstances they continued to provide rabbinic services, such as ritual observance, advice and counseling, to the victims of Nazi persecution, whenever it was possible to do so.&lt;ref&gt;See Irving Rosenbaum, ''The Holocaust and Halakah,'' Ktav, 1976, pp. 9-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second row, [[Maurice Davis (rabbi)|Rabbi Maurice Davis]] is between Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Ralph Bunche.]]--&gt;
'''15. Public affairs.''' As leaders of the Jewish community, many rabbis devote a portion of their time to activities in the public arena, especially where Jewish interests are at stake. They dialogue with public officials and community groups, interact with school boards, advocate for and against legislation, engage in public debates, write newspaper columns, appear in the media and march in parades and demonstrations with others to show support for causes. The extent and tenor of these activities is dictated by the rabbi's own conscience and social and political leanings as informed by Jewish values.

'''16. Defending the faith.''' Rabbis are often called upon to defend the Jewish faith. During the Middle Ages, the Church arranged a series of public [[disputation]]s between rabbis and priests that were intended to "disprove" the Jewish faith and condemn its religious texts, including the Talmud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5226-disputations|title=DISPUTATIONS - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150306212554/http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5226-disputations|archivedate=March 6, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rabbis acquitted themselves well in debate with their superior understanding of Jewish texts and mass conversions to Christianity did not take place. However following these disputations local rulers at the Church's behest consigned cartloads of precious Hebrew manuscripts to the flames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/TalmudBurning.html|title=Burning of the Talmud|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161215024907/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/TalmudBurning.html|archivedate=December 15, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today rabbis are involved in countering the activities of missionaries aimed at converting Jews to other religions, explaining for example that one cannot be of the Jewish faith while believing in either the Christian God or the Christian messiah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aish.com/atr/Jews-for-J.html|title=Jews-for-J: Messiah &amp; Redemption Response on Ask the Rabbi|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108094329/http://www.aish.com/atr/Jews-for-J.html|archivedate=January 8, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''17. Interfaith activities.''' Some rabbis engage in interfaith dialogues with clergy of other faiths. They may host student groups from the religious schools of other faiths and participate in interfaith services. They will view these activities as a means of deepening understanding and reducing misconceptions in a diverse society.

Other rabbis, especially those affiliated with Orthodox Judaism, will generally not participate in interfaith dialogues about theology. They will however engage in discussions with the clergy of other faiths about matters of mutual social concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scholarship.law.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1102&amp;context=scholar |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109021054/http://scholarship.law.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1102&amp;context=scholar |archivedate=January 9, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''18. Non-practicing rabbis.''' There is a segment of the rabbinate that does not engage in rabbinic functions on a daily basis, except perhaps to study. Because ordination (''semicha'') has the features of a post-graduate academic degree, some study to receive ordination but then follow a different career in secular business, education or the professions. These rabbis may be asked from time to time to perform a rabbinic function on an ad hoc and voluntary basis, e.g. to perform a marriage ceremony or answer a religious question. At other times, they act as regular members of the Jewish community. No negative attitudes attach to rabbis who do not practice the profession. They are likely admired in their communities for their decision to spend years engaged in advanced Torah study for its own sake.

===Compensation===
In antiquity those who performed rabbinic functions, such as judging a case or teaching Torah to students, did not receive compensation for their services.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey I. Roth, ''Inheriting the Crown in Jewish Law: The Struggle for Rabbinic Compensation, Tenure and Inheritance Rights,'' Univ. of So. Carolina Press, 2006, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Being a rabbi was not a full-time profession and those who served had other occupations to support themselves and their families, such as woodchopper, sandal-maker, carpenter, water-carrier, farmer and tanner.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Encyclopedia, {{cite web |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12494-rabbi |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131102116/http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12494-rabbi |archivedate=January 31, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; A respected scholar, Rabbi [[Zadok]] (1st cent. C.E.), had said "never to use the Torah as a spade for digging,"&lt;ref&gt;Mishnah, ''Avot'' 4:5.&lt;/ref&gt; and this was understood to mean never to use one's Torah knowledge for an inappropriate purpose, such as earning a fee. Still, as honored members of the community, Torah sages were allowed a series of privileges and exemptions that alleviated their financial burdens somewhat. These included such things as tax exemption from communal levies,&lt;ref name="Bava Batra 7b-8a"&gt;''Bava Batra'' 7b-8a&lt;/ref&gt; marketplace priority (first in, first out regarding their trade),&lt;ref name="Bava Batra 7b-8a"/&gt; receiving personal services from their students (''shimush talmedei hakhamim''),&lt;ref&gt;''Ketubot'' 96a.&lt;/ref&gt; silent business partnerships with wealthy merchants,&lt;ref&gt;''Berakhot'' 34b,&lt;/ref&gt; and a substitute fee to replace their lost earnings when they had to leave work to perform a rabbinic function (''sekhar battalah'').&lt;ref&gt;''Talmud Yerushalmi, Nedarim'' 4:4&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period of the [[Geonim]] (c. 650-1050 C.E.), opinions on compensation shifted. It was deemed inappropriate for the leaders of the Jewish community to appear in the marketplace as laborers or vendors of merchandise, and leading a Jewish community was becoming a full-time occupation. Under these conditions, the Geonim collected taxes and donations at home and abroad to fund their schools (''yeshivot'') and paid salaries to teachers, officials and judges of the Jewish community, whom they appointed.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, 10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moses Maimonides]] (''Rambam'', 1135-1204), who supported himself as a physician, reasserted the traditional view of offering rabbinic service to the Jewish community without compensation.&lt;ref&gt;''Mishnah Torah, Talmud Torah'' 3:10; ''Commentary on the Mishnah, Avot'' 4:7.&lt;/ref&gt; It remains the ideal. But circumstances had changed. Jewish communities required full-time rabbis, and the rabbis themselves preferred to spend their days studying and teaching Torah rather than working at a secular trade.

By the fifteenth century it was the norm for Jewish communities to compensate their rabbis, although the rabbi's contract might well refer to a "suspension fee" (''sekhar battalah'') rather than a salary, as if he were relinquishing a salary from secular employment.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, 27-29.&lt;/ref&gt; The size of salaries varied, depending on the size of the community served, with rabbis in large cities being well-compensated while rabbis in small towns might receive a small stipend.&lt;ref&gt;Simha Assaf, ''LeKorot HaRabbanut,'' ''B'Ohalei Yaakov'' (Mosad HaRav Kook, 5703), pp. 46-48.&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbis were able to supplement their rabbinic incomes by engaging in associated functions and accepting fees for them, like serving as the community's scribe, notary and archivist, teaching in the elementary school or yeshivah, publishing books, arbitrating civil litigations, or even serving as a matchmaker.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, 28-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the formation of rabbinical seminaries starting in the nineteenth century, the rabbinate experienced a degree of professionalization that is still underway. At the present time, an ordained graduate of a rabbinical seminary that is affiliated with one of the modern branches of Judaism, Reform, Conservative, Reconstructionist, or modern Orthodox, will find employment—whether as a congregational rabbi, teacher, chaplain, Hillel director, camp director, social worker or administrator—through the placement office of his or her seminary. Like any modern professional, he or she will negotiate the terms of employment with potential employers and sign a contract specifying duties, duration of service, salary, benefits, pension and the like.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, 116-117.&lt;/ref&gt; A rabbi's salary and benefits today tend to be similar to those of other modern professionals, such as lawyers and accountants, with similar levels of post-graduate education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2003/09/17/life-religion/features/different-denominations-same-pay|title=Different denominations, same pay|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102082824/http://www.jta.org/2003/09/17/life-religion/features/different-denominations-same-pay|archivedate=January 2, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible to engage in the rabbinate part-time, e.g. at a synagogue with a small membership; the rabbi's salary will be proportionate to the services rendered and he or she will likely have additional employment outside the synagogue.

===Authority===
Acceptance of rabbinic credentials involves both issues of practicality and principle. As a practical matter, communities and individuals typically tend to follow the authority of the rabbi they have chosen as their leader (called by some the ''mara d'atra'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=MARA DE-ATRA: A Brief Sketch |first=Aaron |last=Kirschenbaum |journal=Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought |volume=27 |issue=4 |year=1993 |pages=35–40 |jstor=23260883}}&lt;/ref&gt; on issues of Jewish law. They may recognize that other rabbis have the same authority elsewhere, but for decisions and opinions important to them they will work through their own rabbi.

The rabbi derives authority from achievements within a meritocratic system. Rabbis' authority is neither nominal nor spiritual — it is based on credentials. Typically the rabbi receives an institutional stamp of approval. It is this authority that allows them to engage in the halakhic process and make legal prescriptions.&lt;ref&gt;John Corrigan, Frederick Denny, Martin S. Jaffee, and Carlos Eire. Jews, Christians, Muslims: A Comparative Introduction to Monotheistic Religions. New York, NY: Routledge, 2012, 124-128&lt;/ref&gt;

The same pattern is true within broader communities, ranging from Hasidic communities to rabbinical or congregational organizations: there will be a formal or ''de facto'' structure of rabbinic authority that is responsible for the members of the community. However, Hasidic communities do not have a rabbi: they have a [[Rebbe]], who plays a similar role but is thought to have a special connection to god. The rebbes' authority, then, is based on a spiritual connection to god and so they are venerated in a different way from rabbis.

===Honor===
According to the Talmud, it is a commandment (''[[mitzvah]]'') to honor a rabbi and a Torah scholar, along with the elderly, as it is written in Leviticus 19:32, "Rise up before the elderly, and honor the aged."&lt;ref&gt;See Talmud Kidushin daf 30–40, Bava Metziah 33a, Rambam's Mishneh Torah tractate Hilkhot Talmud Torah 5:7&lt;/ref&gt; One should stand in their presence and address them with respect.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Hilchot Talmud Torah 5:7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kohen|Kohanim]] (priests) are required to honor rabbis and Torah scholars like the general public. However, if one is more learned than the rabbi or the scholar there is no need to stand. The spouse of a Torah scholar must also be shown deference.&lt;ref name="yutorah1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/746702/Rabbi_Hanan_Balk/The_Obligation_to_Respect_the_Wife_of_a_Torah_Scholar_or_a_Talmidat_Chacham |title=YUTorah Online – The Obligation to Respect the Wife of a Torah Scholar or a Talmidat Chacham (Rabbi Hanan Balk) |publisher=Yutorah.org |date=June 24, 2010 |accessdate=May 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607153904/http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/746702/Rabbi_Hanan_Balk/The_Obligation_to_Respect_the_Wife_of_a_Torah_Scholar_or_a_Talmidat_Chacham |archivedate=June 7, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a commandment for teachers and rabbis to honor their students.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Hilchot Talmud Torah 5:12.&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbis and Torah scholars, in order to ensure discipline within the Jewish community, have the authority to place individuals who insult them under a ban of excommunication.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Hilchot Talmud Torah 6:12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ordination==
{{Main|Semikhah}}
A rabbinical student is awarded ''semichah'' ("rabbinic ordination") after the completion of a learning program in a yeshiva or modern rabbinical seminary or under the guidance of an individual rabbi. The exact course of study varies by denomination, but most are in the range of 3–6 years. The programs all include study of Talmud, the codes of [[halakha|Jewish law]] and [[responsa]] to a greater or lesser extent, depending on the branch of Judaism. In addition to rabbinical literature, modern seminaries offer courses in pastoral subjects such as counseling, education, comparative religion and delivering sermons. Most rabbinical students will complete their studies in their mid-20s. There is no hierarchy and no central authority in Judaism that either supervises rabbinic education or records ordinations; each branch of Judaism regulates the ordination of the rabbis affiliated with it.

The most common formula used on a certificate of ''semichah'' is ''Yore yore'' ("He may teach, he may teach," sometimes rendered as a question and answer, "May he teach? He may teach."). Most Rabbis hold this qualification; they are sometimes called a ''moreh le-hora'ah'' ("a teacher of rulings"). A more advanced form of ''semichah'' is ''yadin yadin'' ("He may judge, he may judge" or "May he judge? He may judge."). This enables the recipient to serve as a judge on a rabbinical court and adjudicate cases of monetary law, among other responsibilities. The recipient of this ordination can be formally addressed as a ''dayan'' ("judge") and also retain the title of rabbi. Only a small percentage of rabbis earn the ''yadin yadin'' ordination. Although not strictly necessary, many Orthodox rabbis hold that a ''[[beth din]]'' (court of Jewish law) should be made up of ''dayanim'' with this ordination.

Receiving ordination has been a festive occasion accompanied by celebration since Talmudic times. According to the Talmud, when the rabbis ordained Rabbi Zera, they sang a bridal song in his honor: "No mascara, and no rouge, and no dyeing [of the hair] -- and [yet] a graceful gazelle."&lt;ref&gt;Adin Steinsaltz, Talmud, Sanhedrin 14A, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; They also sang at the ordination of Rabbi Ammi and Rabbi Assi: "Just like these, just like these, ordain for us!"&lt;ref&gt;Talmud, Sanhedrin 14a.&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony where ordination is conferred is known as ''Chag HaSemichah,'' the festival of ordination. Today in most branches of Judaism, there is no laying on of hands; ordination is conferred as an academic degree with a diploma, signed by the officiating rabbis, often hand-written on parchment.

===Orthodox and Haredi Judaism===
====Orthodox and Modern-Orthodox====
[[File:Reb Moshe Feinstein.jpg|thumb|250px|Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]], a leading Rabbinical authority for Orthodox Judaism of the second half of the twentieth century.]]
An Orthodox semichah requires the successful completion of a program encompassing Jewish law and responsa in keeping with longstanding tradition. Orthodox rabbinical students work to gain knowledge in [[Talmud]], [[Rishonim]] and [[Acharonim]] (early and late medieval commentators) and [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. They study sections of the [[Shulchan Aruch]] (codified Jewish law) and its main commentaries that pertain to daily-life questions (such as the laws of keeping [[kosher]], [[Shabbat]], and the laws of [[Niddah|family purity]]). Orthodox rabbis typically study at [[yeshiva]]s, which are dedicated religious schools. [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] rabbinical students, such as those at [[Yeshiva University]], study some elements of modern theology or philosophy, as well as the classical rabbinic works on such subjects.

The entrance requirements for an Orthodox yeshiva include a strong background within Jewish law, liturgy, Talmudic study, and attendant languages (e.g., [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and in some cases [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]). Since rabbinical studies typically flow from other yeshiva studies, those who seek a semichah are typically not required to have completed a university education. There are some exceptions to this rule, including [[Yeshiva University]], which requires all rabbinical students to complete an undergraduate degree before entering the program and a Masters or equivalent before ordination.

On March 22, 2009, the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale, an Orthodox Synagogue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hir.org/ |title=Hebrew Institute of Riverdale – H.I.R. – Home Page |publisher=H.I.R. |access-date=May 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414210852/http://www.hir.org/ |archivedate=April 14, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; held a formal ceremony officially giving [[Sara Hurwitz]] the title ''[[Maharat]]'' – ''Manhigah Halakhtit Ruchanit Toranit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://matzav.com/yated-blasts-chovevei-torah-for-ordination-of-female-rabbi-calls-on-yu-rca-ou-to-denounce-open-orthodoxy |title=Yated Blasts Chovevei Torah for Ordination of Female Rabbi, Calls on YU, RCA &amp; OU to Denounce ‘Open Orthodoxy’ » Matzav.com – The Online Voice of Torah Jewry |publisher=Matzav.com |date=July 14, 2009 |access-date=May 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529071217/http://matzav.com/yated-blasts-chovevei-torah-for-ordination-of-female-rabbi-calls-on-yu-rca-ou-to-denounce-open-orthodoxy |archivedate=May 29, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some Orthodox leaders, such as the [[Rabbinical Council of America]] and the [[Agudath Israel of America]], opposed this move and said it was not in keeping with Orthodoxy; in any case, Hurwitz was not given the title "rabbi". However, she is considered by some the first Orthodox woman rabbi. In February 2010, [[Avi Weiss]] announced that he was changing her title of Maharat to a more familiar-sounding title "Rabba".&lt;ref name="Heeb"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heebmagazine.com/rabba-sara-hurwitz-rocks-the-orthodox/|title="Rabba" Sara Hurwitz Rocks the Orthodox|date=March 10, 2010|publisher=Heeb Magazine|accessdate=13 March 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520031945/http://www.heebmagazine.com/rabba-sara-hurwitz-rocks-the-orthodox/|archivedate=May 20, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of this shift was to clarify Hurwitz's position as a full member of the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale rabbinic staff. The change was criticised by both [[Agudath Yisrael]] and the [[Rabbinical Council of America]], who called the move "beyond the pale of Orthodox Judaism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.momentmag.com/do-1-rabba-2-rabbis-and-1-yeshiva-a-new-denomination/|title=Do 1 Rabba, 2 Rabbis and 1 Yeshiva = a New Denomination?|author=Staff|publisher=Moment Magazine|accessdate=March 21, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523010556/http://www.momentmag.com/do-1-rabba-2-rabbis-and-1-yeshiva-a-new-denomination/|archivedate=May 23, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, women's ordination has come to be a focal point of division between YCT and the rest of the spectrum of Orthodoxy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jta.org/2012/09/07/news-opinion/the-telegraph/is-yeshivat-chovevei-torah-kosher-enough |title=Is Yeshivat Chovevei Torah kosher enough? |publisher=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] |author=Uriel Heilman |access-date=April 25, 2016 |quote=The red lines would be what we consider to be appropriate halachic standards, and also appropriate philosophical standards.

However, in June 2015, [[Lila Kagedan]] was ordained by [[Yeshivat Maharat]] and in keeping with newer policies, was given the freedom to choose her own title, and she chose to be addressed as "Rabbi".&lt;ref&gt;''Canadian Jewish News'' [http://www.cjnews.com/living-jewish/jewish-learning/why-orthodox-judaism-needs-female-rabbis Why Orthodoxy Needs Female Rabbis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126131555/http://www.cjnews.com/living-jewish/jewish-learning/why-orthodox-judaism-needs-female-rabbis |date=November 26, 2015 }}, November 25, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Dina Brawer, born in Italy but living in Britain, was ordained by Yeshivat Maharat; she chose the title Rabba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolfisz |first=Francine |url=http://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/dina-brawer-becomes-uks-first-female-orthodox-rabbi/ |title=Dina Brawer becomes UK’s first female Orthodox rabbi &amp;#124; Jewish News |publisher=Jewishnews.timesofisrael.com |date= |accessdate=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yeshivatmaharat.org/class-of-2018/ |title=Class of 2018 — Yeshivat Maharat |publisher=Yeshivatmaharat.org |date= |accessdate=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2017 the [[Orthodox Union]] adopted a policy banning women from serving as clergy, from holding titles such as "rabbi", or from doing common clergy functions even without a title, in its congregations in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jweekly.com/2017/02/03/orthodox-union-bars-women-from-serving-as-clergy-in-its-synagogues/ |title=Orthodox Union bars women from serving as clergy in its synagogues – J |publisher=Jweekly.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220223107/http://www.jweekly.com/2017/02/03/orthodox-union-bars-women-from-serving-as-clergy-in-its-synagogues/ |archivedate=February 20, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Haredi Judaism====
While some [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] (including [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]]) [[yeshiva]]s (also known as "Talmudical/Rabbinical schools or academies") do grant official ''semichah'' ("ordination") to many students wishing to become rabbis, most of the students within the yeshivas engage in [[Torah study|learning Torah]] or [[Talmud]] without the goal of becoming rabbis or holding any official positions.

The curriculum for obtaining ''semichah'' ("ordination") as rabbis for Haredi and Hasidic scholars is the same [[Rabbi#Orthodox Judaism|as described above]] for all Orthodox students wishing to obtain the official title of "Rabbi" and to be recognized as such.

Within the Hasidic world, the positions of spiritual leadership are dynastically transmitted within established families, usually from fathers to sons, while a small number of students obtain official ordination to become [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)|dayan]]im ("judges") on [[Beth din|religious courts]], [[Posek|poskim]] ("decisors" of [[Halakha|Jewish law]]), as well as teachers in the Hasidic schools. The same is true for the non-Hasidic [[Litvish]] yeshivas that are controlled by dynastically transmitted [[rosh yeshiva]]s and the majority of students will not become rabbis, even after many years of post-graduate [[kollel]] study.

Some yeshivas, such as [[Yeshivas Rabbeinu Yisrael Meir HaKohen|Yeshivas Chafetz Chaim]] and [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel]] in [[Baltimore]], Maryland, may encourage their students to obtain ''semichah'' and mostly serve as rabbis who teach in other yeshivas or Hebrew day schools. Other yeshivas, such as [[Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin|Yeshiva Chaim Berlin]] ([[Brooklyn]], New York) or the Mirrer Yeshiva (in [[Mir (Brooklyn)|Brooklyn]] and [[Mir (Jerusalem)|Jerusalem]]), do not have an official "semichah/rabbinical program" to train rabbis, but provide semichah on an "as needed" basis if and when one of their senior students is offered a rabbinical position but only with the approval of their ''rosh yeshivas''.

Haredim will often prefer using [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] names for rabbinic titles based on older traditions, such as: ''[[Rav]]'' (denoting "[great] rabbi"), ''HaRav'' ("the [great] rabbi"), ''Moreinu HaRav'' ("our teacher the [great] rabbi"), ''[[Moreinu]]'' ("our teacher"), ''Moreinu VeRabeinu HaRav'' ("our teacher and our rabbi/master the [great] rabbi"), ''Moreinu VeRabeinu'' ("our teacher and our rabbi/master"), ''[[Rosh yeshiva]]'' ("[the] head [of the] yeshiva"), ''[[Rosh HaYeshiva]]'' ("head [of] the yeshiva"), "Mashgiach" (for [[Mashgiach ruchani]]) ("spiritual supervsor/guide"), ''[[Mara d'atra|Mora DeAsra]]'' ("teacher/decisor" [of] the/this place"), ''HaGaon'' ("the genius"), ''[[Rebbe]]'' ("[our/my] rabbi"), ''HaTzadik'' ("the righteous/saintly"), "ADMOR" ("Adoneinu Moreinu VeRabeinu") ("our master, our teacher and our rabbi/master") or often just plain ''[[Reb (Yiddish)|Reb]]'' which is a shortened form of ''rebbe'' that can be used by, or applied to, any married Jewish male as the situation applies.

Note: A ''[[rebbetzin]]'' (a [[Yiddish]] usage common among [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazim]]) or a ''[[rabbanit]]'' (in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and used among [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardim]]) is the official "title" used for, or by, the wife of any Orthodox, Haredi, or Hasidic rabbi. ''Rebbetzin'' may also be used as the equivalent of ''Reb'' and is sometimes abbreviated as such as well.

===Liberal Judaism===
{{expand section|date=July 2018}}
====Conservative Judaism====
[[Conservative Judaism]] confers [[semikhah]] after the completion of a program in the codes of Jewish law and responsa in keeping with Jewish tradition. In addition to knowledge and mastery of the study of Talmud and [[halakhah]], Conservative ''semikhah'' also requires that its rabbinical students receive intensive training in [[Tanakh]], classical biblical commentaries, [[biblical criticism]], [[Midrash]], [[Kabbalah]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidut]], the historical development of Judaism from antiquity to modernity, Jewish ethics, the halakhic methodology of [[Conservative responsa]], classical and modern works of Jewish theology and philosophy, synagogue administration, [[pastoral care]], [[chaplaincy]], non-profit management, and navigating the modern world in a Jewish context.

Entrance requirements to Conservative rabbinical study centers include a background within Jewish law and liturgy, familiarity with [[rabbinic literature]], Talmud, etc., ritual observance according to Conservative halakha, and the completion of an undergraduate university degree. In accordance with national collegiate accreditation requirements, Conservative rabbinical students earn a Master of Arts in Rabbinic Literature in addition to receiving ''semikhah''. Ordination is granted at the [[Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies]] in Los Angeles, the Rabbinical School of the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] in New York, the [[Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies]] in Jerusalem, the [[Budapest University of Jewish Studies]], the [[Zacharias Frankel College]] in [[Potsdam]], and the Seminario Rabinico Latinoamericano in Buenos Aires (Argentina). Most Conservative seminaries ordain women and openly LGBT people as rabbis and [[Hazzan|cantor]]s.

====Reform Judaism====
In [[Reform Judaism]] rabbinic studies are mandated in pastoral care, the historical development of Judaism, academic biblical criticism, in addition to the study of traditional rabbinic texts. Rabbinical students also are required to gain practical rabbinic experience by working at a congregation as a rabbinic intern during each year of study from year one onwards.

All Reform seminaries ordain women and openly [[LGBT]] people as rabbis and [[Hazzan|cantor]]s.

The seminary of [[Reform Judaism]] in the United States is [[Hebrew Union College|Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion]]. It has campuses in [[Cincinnati]], New York City, Los Angeles, and in [[Jerusalem]]. In addition to training and ordaining women and openly LGBT people as rabbis and cantors, [[Hebrew Union College|Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion]] has trained and ordained openly transgender people as rabbis (see [[Elliot Kukla]] and [[Reuben Zellman]]).

In the United Kingdom the [[Reform Judaism (United Kingdom)|Reform]] and [[Liberal Judaism (United Kingdom)|Liberal]] movements maintain [[Leo Baeck College]] for the training and ordination of rabbis, and in Germany the [[Progressive Judaism (Germany)|progressive]] [[Abraham Geiger College]] trains and ordains candidates for the rabbinate.

====Reconstructionist Judaism====
[[Reconstructionist Judaism]] has the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]], which is located in Pennsylvania and ordains women as well as men (and openly LGBT people) as rabbis and cantors. In 2015 the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College voted to accept rabbinical students in interfaith relationships, making Reconstructionist Judaism the first type of Judaism to officially allow rabbis in relationships with non-Jewish partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/75811/reconstructionists-give-green-light-to-intermarried-rabbinical-students|title=Reconstructionists give green light to intermarried rabbinical students|publisher=Jweekly|author=Lisa Hostein|date=October 1, 2015|accessdate=17 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003090111/http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/75811/reconstructionists-give-green-light-to-intermarried-rabbinical-students|archivedate=October 3, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-orthodox seminaries unaffiliated with main denominations====
There are several possibilities for receiving rabbinic ordination in addition to seminaries maintained by the large Jewish denominations. These include seminaries maintained by smaller denominational movements, and nondenominational (also called "transdenominational" or "postdenominational") Jewish seminaries.

* [[Humanistic Judaism]] has the [[International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism]], which currently has two centers of activity: one in Jerusalem and the other in Farmington Hills, Michigan. Both places ordain women as well as men as rabbis, and do not ordain cantors of either sex. Both places ordain openly LGBT people.
* [[Jewish Renewal]] has an ordination program, ALEPH, but no central campus. ALEPH ordains women as well as men as rabbis and cantors. It also ordains openly LGBT people.
* The [[Academy for Jewish Religion (New York)|Academy for Jewish Religion]], in New York City, since 1956, and the unrelated [[Academy for Jewish Religion (California)|Academy for Jewish Religion]]-California, in Los Angeles, since 2000, have been rabbinic (and cantorial) seminaries unaffiliated with any denomination or movement. [[Hebrew College]], near Boston, includes a similarly unaffiliated rabbinic school, opened in the Fall of 2003. These seminaries are accepted by all non-Orthodox rabbis as valid rabbinical seminaries{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}, and they all ordain women as well as men (and openly LGBT people) as rabbis and cantors. Orthodox Jews do not consider these ordinations valid, because these seminaries do not consider Orthodox ''halacha'' to be binding.
* The [[Steven Blane#Jewish Spiritual Leaders Institute|Jewish Spiritual Leaders Institute]] offers a training program, meets in weekly online classes via the Internet and ordains women as well as men as unaffiliated rabbis to meet the needs of unaffiliated Jews as well as interfaith couples and their families. It subscribes to [[Universalism#Judaism|Jewish Universalism]], promoting religious tolerance and asserting that there are many paths to 'the One.' JSLI ordained its first class of rabbis in August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsli.net/ |title=JSLI |publisher=JSLI |date=August 27, 2011 |accessdate=May 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429115304/http://www.jsli.net/ |archivedate=April 29, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It does ordain openly LGBT people.
*The [[Rabbinical Seminary International]] is a rabbinical seminary in New York, which ordains women as well as men (and openly LGBT people) as rabbis, and does not ordain cantors of either sex. It is a transdenominational rabbinical seminary in the Neo-Hasidic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rabbinicalseminaryint.org/|title=Rabbinical Seminary International|work=rabbinicalseminaryint.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923144653/http://www.rabbinicalseminaryint.org/|archivedate=September 23, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Union for Traditional Judaism]] (UTJ), an offshoot of the left-wing of Orthodoxy and the right-wing of Conservative Judaism, has a non-denominational seminary in [[New Jersey]];&lt;ref&gt;Ari L. Goldman, [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/10/us/religion-notes.html?scp=1&amp;sq=bridge%20seminary&amp;st=cse Religion Notes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131102036/http://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/10/us/religion-notes.html?scp=1&amp;sq=bridge%20seminary&amp;st=cse |date=January 31, 2017 }}, The New York Times, Saturday, March 10, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; the seminary is accepted by all non-Orthodox rabbis as a valid, traditional rabbinical seminary. The vast majority of Orthodox Jews do not recognize ordination from UTJ. However, it bridges Conservative and Orthodox Judaism, and [[Modern Orthodox]] synagogues have hired UTJ rabbis. Though the more mainstream body of Modern Orthodox Judaism, such as the Rabbinical Council of America, does not recognize ordination from UTJ. UTJ only ordains men as rabbis and cantors, and does not ordain openly LGBT men.
* The [[Hebrew Seminary of the Deaf]] is a nondenominational rabbinical seminary in Illinois, which ordains women as well as men (and openly LGBT people) as rabbis, and does not ordain cantors of either sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hebrewseminarydeaf.org/testimonials.htm |title=Testimonials |publisher=Hebrewseminarydeaf.org |accessdate=May 3, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204021558/http://www.hebrewseminarydeaf.org/testimonials.htm |archivedate=December 4, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interdenominational recognition==
{{Cleanup|section|date=January 2009}}
Historically and until the present, recognition of a rabbi relates to a community's perception of the rabbi's competence to interpret Jewish law and act as a teacher on central matters within Judaism. More broadly speaking, it is also an issue of being a worthy successor to a sacred legacy.

As a result, there have always been greater or lesser disputes about the legitimacy and authority of rabbis. Historical examples include [[Samaritans]] and [[Karaite (Jewish sect)|Karaites]].

The divisions between the various religious branches within Judaism may have their most pronounced manifestation on whether rabbis from one movement recognize the legitimacy or the authority of rabbis in another.

As a general rule within Orthodoxy and among some in the Conservative movement, rabbis are reluctant to accept the authority of other rabbis whose Halakhic standards are not as strict as their own. In some cases, this leads to an outright rejection of even the legitimacy of other rabbis; in others, the more lenient rabbi may be recognized as a spiritual leader of a particular community but may not be accepted as a credible authority on Jewish law.
*The Orthodox rabbinical establishment rejects the validity of Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis on the grounds that their movements' teachings are in violation of traditional Jewish tenets. Some [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] rabbis are respectful toward non-Orthodox rabbis and focus on commonalities even as they disagree on interpretation of some areas of Halakha (with Conservative rabbis) or the authority of Halakha (with Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis).
*Conservative rabbis accept the legitimacy of Orthodox rabbis, though they are often critical of Orthodox positions. Although they would rarely look to Reform or Reconstructionist rabbis for Halakhic decisions, they accept the legitimacy of these rabbis' religious leadership.
*Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis, on the premise that all the main movements are legitimate expressions of Judaism, will accept the legitimacy of other rabbis' leadership, though will not accept their views on Jewish law, since Reform and Reconstructionism reject Halakha as binding.

These debates cause great problems for recognition of Jewish marriages, conversions, and other life decisions that are touched by Jewish law. Orthodox rabbis do not recognize conversions by non-Orthodox rabbis. Conservative rabbis recognise all conversions done according to halakha. Finally, the North American Reform and Reconstructionst movemements recognize [[patrilineality]], under certain circumstances, as a valid claim towards Judaism, whereas Conservative and Orthodox maintain the position expressed in the [[Talmud]] and Codes that one can be a Jew only through [[matrilineality]] (born of a Jewish mother) or through [[conversion to Judaism]].

With some rare exceptions (see below), women historically have generally not served as rabbis until the 1970s and the influence of [[second-wave feminism]], when the [[Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion]] first ordained women rabbis. Today, female rabbis are ordained within all branches of [[Progressive Judaism]],&lt;ref name="forward1"/&gt; while in Orthodox Judaism, women cannot become rabbis.

While there is no prohibition against women learning [[halakha]] that pertains to them, nor is it any more problematic for a woman to rule on such issues than it is for any lay person to do so,&lt;ref&gt;Pitchei Teshuvah CM 7:5&lt;/ref&gt; the issue lies in the rabbi's position of communal authority. Following the ruling of the [[Talmud]], the decisors of Jewish law held that women were not allowed to serve in positions of authority over a community, such as judges or kings.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Melachim 1:6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shulchan Aruch CM 7:4&lt;/ref&gt; The position of official rabbi of a community, ''mara de'atra'' ("master of the place"), has generally been treated in the [[responsa]] as such a position. This ruling is still followed in traditional and orthodox circles but has been relaxed in branches like Conservative and Reform Judaism that are less strict in their adherence to traditional Jewish law.

The Conservative movement appointed a special commission to study the issue of ordaining women as rabbis, The commission met between 1977 and 1978, and consisted of eleven men and three women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jwa.org/feminism/klagsbrun-francine |title=Francine Klagsbrun &amp;#124; Jewish Women's Archive |publisher=Jwa.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919084822/http://jwa.org/feminism/klagsbrun-francine |archivedate=September 19, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the faculty of the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], voted, without accompanying opinion, to ordain women as rabbis and as cantors.

In Europe, [[Leo Baeck College]] had ordained 30 female rabbis by 2006 (out of 158 ordinations in total since 1956), starting with [[Jackie Tabick]] in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Elizabeth Tikvah Sarah, [http://www.brightonandhoveprosynagogue.org.uk/sermon-Womenrabbis.htm Women rabbis – a new kind of rabbinic leadership?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622201525/http://www.brightonandhoveprosynagogue.org.uk/sermon-Womenrabbis.htm |date=June 22, 2007 }}, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orthodox Jewish tradition and communal consensus is that the rabbinate is the province of men; the growing calls for Orthodox yeshivas to admit women as rabbinical students have resulted in widespread opposition among the Orthodox rabbinate. Rabbi [[Norman Lamm]], one of the leaders of [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodoxy]] and [[Rosh Yeshiva]] of [[Yeshiva University]]'s [[Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary]], opposes giving semicha to women. "It shakes the boundaries of tradition, and I would never allow it." (Helmreich, 1997) Writing in an article in the ''Jewish Observer'', Moshe Y'chiail Friedman states that Orthodox Judaism prohibits women from being given semicha and serving as rabbis. He holds that the trend towards this goal is driven by [[sociology]], and not halakha ("Jewish law"). In his words, the idea is a "quirky fad."&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Moshe Y'chiail, "Women in the Rabbinate", Friedman, Moshe Y'chiail. Jewish Observer, 17:8, 1984, 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; No Orthodox rabbinical association (e.g. Agudath Yisrael, Rabbinical Council of America) has allowed women to be ordained using the term ''rabbi''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

However, in the last twenty years Orthodox Judaism has begun to develop roles for women as halakhic court advisors and congregational advisors. Rabbi Aryeh Strikovski ([[Machanaim|Machanaim Yeshiva]] and [[Pardes Institute]]) worked in the 1990s with Rabbi [[Avraham Shapira]] (then a co-[[Chief rabbi]] of Israel) to initiate the program for training Orthodox women as halakhic ''[[Toanot]]'' ("advocates") in [[beth din|rabbinic courts]]. They have since trained nearly seventy women in Israel. Strikovski states that "The knowledge one requires to become a court advocate is more than a regular ordination, and now to pass certification is much more difficult than to get ordination."{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In 2012 [[Ephraim Mirvis]] appointed Lauren Levin as Britain’s first Orthodox female halakhic adviser, at [[Finchley Synagogue]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/94813/synagogue-appoints-first-female-halachic-adviser|title=Synagogue appoints first female halachic adviser|work=thejc.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121223072755/http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/94813/synagogue-appoints-first-female-halachic-adviser|archivedate=December 23, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Orthodox Jewish women now serve in Orthodox Jewish congregations in roles that previously were reserved for males. The grammatically correct Hebrew feminine parallel to the masculine title rabbi is ''[[rabbanit]]'' (רבנית) sometimes used for women in this role.&lt;ref&gt;"Rabbanit Reclaimed", Hurwitz, Sara. JOFA Journal, VI, 1, 2006, 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sara Hurwitz]], considered by some the first Orthodox woman rabbi, following correct Hebrew feminized grammar of rav (רב), has used the title ''[[rabbanit|rabba]]'' (רבה) since 2010. Some use another variant, ''rabet'', for a female rabbi. Other women in Jewish leadership, like [[Rachel Kohl Finegold]] and Lynn Kaye function as de facto [[assistant rabbi]]s.The newer title of ''Maharat'' has been used by those who receive this title at Yeshivat Maharat, the first Orthodox seminary for women to confer an equivalent to rabbinic ordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yeshivatmaharat.org/|title=Yeshivat Maharat|work=Yeshivat Maharat|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150307141515/http://www.yeshivatmaharat.org/|archivedate=March 7, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Israel, the [[Shalom Hartman Institute]], founded by Orthodox Rabbi [[David Hartman (rabbi)|David Hartman]], opened a program in 2009 that will grant semicha to women and men of all Jewish denominations, including Orthodox Judaism, although the students are meant to "assume the role of 'rabbi-educators' – not pulpit rabbis- in North American community day schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hartmaninstitute.com/SHInews_View_Eng.asp?Article_Id=22 ] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan 10, 2008 23:50 | Updated Jan 13, 2008 8:48|Jewishworld.Jpost.Com Hartman Institute to ordain women rabbis&lt;/ref&gt;

In Israel a growing number of Orthodox women are being trained as ''[[yoatzot halakhah]]'' (halakhic advisers).&lt;ref&gt;"Rabbis, Rebbetzins and Halakhic Advisors", Wolowelsky, Joel B.. Tradition, 36:4, 2002, pp. 54–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

:…Strikovski and his colleagues aren't willing to confer a title commensurate with experience. Clarifying his position, he laughs, "If a man passed such a test [on Halakha] we would call him a rabbi – but who cares what you call it?" he says. "Rav Soloveitchik, my teacher, always used to say: 'If you know [Jewish law], then you don't need ordination; and if you don't know, then ordination won't make a difference.'" Further, the title of rabbi only had meaning during the time of the Sanhedrin, he argues. "Later titles were modified from generation to generation and community to community, and now the important thing is not the title but that there is a revolution where women can and do study the oral law." + – :(Feldinger, 2005)

In 2013, the first class of female [[halacha|halachic]] advisers trained to practice in the US graduated; they graduated from the North American branch of [[Nishmat]]’s yoetzet halacha program in a ceremony at Congregation Sheartith Israel, Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue in Manhattan.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/landmark-us-program-graduates-first-female-halachic-advisers/|title=Landmark US program graduates first female halachic advisers|work=The Times of Israel|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202151012/http://www.timesofisrael.com/landmark-us-program-graduates-first-female-halachic-advisers/|archivedate=February 2, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of Toanot is not restricted to any one segment of Orthodoxy; In Israel they have worked with Haredi and Modern Orthodox Jews. Orthodox women may study the laws of family purity at the same level of detail that Orthodox males do at [[Nishmat (midrasha)|Nishmat, the Jerusalem Center for Advanced Jewish Study for Women]]. The purpose is for them to be able to act as halakhic advisors for other women, a role that traditionally was limited to male rabbis. This course of study is overseen by Rabbi Yaakov Varhaftig.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nishmat.net/keren-ariel-yoatzot-halacha/|title=Yoatzot Halacha - Nishmat|website=www.nishmat.net|access-date=2017-02-06|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207123700/https://www.nishmat.net/keren-ariel-yoatzot-halacha/|archivedate=February 7, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern Orthodox trends===
Furthermore, several efforts are underway within [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] communities to include qualified women in activities traditionally limited to rabbis:
*In the United States, Modern Orthodox rabbis [[Avi Weiss]] and [[Saul Berman]] created an advanced educational institute for women called [[Torat Miriam]]. They do not claim that the graduates of this institute are rabbis, but that the long-term goal is to have women "work on a professional level in the synagogue." (Helmreich, 1997)
*Rabbi Aryeh Strikovski (Mahanayim Yeshiva and [[Pardes Institute]]) worked in the 1990s with Rabbi [[Avraham Shapira]] (then a co-[[Chief rabbi]] of Israel) to initiate the program for training Orthodox women as halakhic ''Toanot'' ("advocates") in [[beth din|rabbinic courts]]. They have since trained nearly seventy women. Strikovski states that "The knowledge one requires to become a court advocate is more than a regular ordination, and now to pass certification is much more difficult than to get ordination." The use of Toanot is not restricted to any one segment of Orthodoxy; in Israel they have worked with Haredi and Modern Orthodox Jews. Furthermore, Rav Strikovsky granted ordination to [[Haviva Ner-David]] (who is American) in 2006, although she has not been able to find a job as a rabbi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canonist.com/wp-content/uploads/plugins/Haviva--s_Smicha.doc Copy of Original Certificate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708115508/http://www.canonist.com/wp-content/uploads/plugins/Haviva--s_Smicha.doc |date=July 8, 2011 }} MS Word Document&lt;/ref&gt;
*In Israel and America a growing number of Orthodox women are being trained as ''yoatzot halacha'' ("halachic advisors"), who serve many in communities ranging from Haredi to Modern Orthodox. In 2013, the first class of female [[halacha|halachic]] advisors trained to practice in the US graduated; they graduated from the North American branch of [[Nishmat]]’s yoetzet halacha program in a ceremony at Congregation Sheartith Israel, Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue in Manhattan.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;
*At Nishmat, the Jerusalem Center for Advanced Jewish Study for Women, Orthodox women may study the laws of [[family purity]] at the same level of detail that Orthodox males do. The purpose is for them to be able to act as halakhic advisors for other women, a role that traditionally was limited to male rabbis. This course of study is overseen by Rabbi Yaakov Varhaftig.
*Rahel Berkovits, an Orthodox Talmud teacher at Jerusalem's [[Pardes Institute of Jewish Studies]], states that as a result of such changes in Haredi and Modern Orthodox Judaism, "Orthodox women have founded and overseen prayer communities, argue cases in rabbinic courts, advise on halachic issues, and dominate in social work activities that are all very associated with the role a rabbi performs, even though these women do not have the official title of rabbi."
*In 2009, Rabbi [[Avi Weiss]] founded Yeshivat Maharat, a school in New York which "is dedicated to giving Orthodox women proficiency in learning and teaching Talmud, understanding Jewish law and its application to everyday life as well as the other tools necessary to be Jewish communal leaders." Those women who graduate from Yeshivat Maharat were given the title of [[Maharat]], which "is an acronym, in Hebrew, for 'manhigot hilkhatiot, rukhaniot vTorahniot', meaning, someone who is a spiritual leader trained in Torah and the intricacies of Jewish law."&lt;ref name="yeshivatmaharat1"&gt;[http://yeshivatmaharat.org/frequently-asked-questions ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112134933/http://yeshivatmaharat.org/frequently-asked-questions |date=January 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first women graduated from Yeshivat Maharat on June 16, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxny.com/story/22604956/first-orthodox-jewish-women-ordained-as-member-of-clergy|title=First Orthodox Jewish women ordained as members of clergy|author=GLENN WILBURN|date=June 16, 2013|work=myfoxny.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103035239/http://www.myfoxny.com/story/22604956/first-orthodox-jewish-women-ordained-as-member-of-clergy|archivedate=November 3, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/178749/as-first-maharats-graduate-roles-for-orthodox-wome/|title=As First Maharats Graduate, Roles for Orthodox Women Take Leap Forward|date=June 16, 2013|work=The Forward|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619015141/http://forward.com/articles/178749/as-first-maharats-graduate-roles-for-orthodox-wome/|archivedate=June 19, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Yaffa Epstein was ordained as Rabba by the Yeshivat Maharat.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Also that year, [[Lila Kagedan]] was ordained as Rabbi by the Yeshivat Maharat, making her their first graduate to take the title Rabbi.&lt;ref name="Rabbi Lila Kagedan"/&gt; In 2018, Dina Brawer, born in Italy but living in Britain, was ordained by Yeshivat Maharat; she chose the title Rabba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolfisz |first=Francine |url=http://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/dina-brawer-becomes-uks-first-female-orthodox-rabbi/ |title=Dina Brawer becomes UK’s first female Orthodox rabbi &amp;#124; Jewish News |publisher=Jewishnews.timesofisrael.com |date= |accessdate=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yeshivatmaharat.org/class-of-2018/ |title=Class of 2018 — Yeshivat Maharat |publisher=Yeshivatmaharat.org |date= |accessdate=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Soul Man''''' is an American [[situation comedy|sitcom]] starring [[Dan Aykroyd]] that aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from April 15, 1997 to May 26, 1998. A total of 25 half-hour episodes were produced over two seasons.

The series premiered on April 15, 1997, and was picked up for a second season of 22 half-hour episodes after only three episodes aired for the first season. Despite ranking 29th in its 2nd and final season, it ended on May 26, 1998, with 25 half-hour episodes produced in total. A four-year-old [[Spencer Breslin]] made his TV debut and was a series regular for the three-episode-long 1997 first season, in which he played the youngest child of Aykroyd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Barry W Stanton |url=http://gazettereview.com/2016/03/what-happened-to-spencer-breslin-update/ |title=What Happened to Spencer Breslin - See What He's Doing Now |publisher=The Gazette Review |date= |accessdate=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Carolyn Patricia Scott |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/nov/02/entertainment/ca-kidhollywood2 |title='Cat' doesn't have his tongue - latimes |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=2003-11-02 |accessdate=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme song was "[[Soul Man (song)|Soul Man]]" written by [[Isaac Hayes]] and [[David Porter (musician)|David Porter]]. Aykroyd was closely associated with the song, having released a hit single of it in 1979 with his band [[The Blues Brothers]].

==Premise==
Mike Weber (played by Aykroyd) is a widowed Episcopal priest who must deal with his four children, his quirky parishioners in [[Royal Oak, Michigan]], and a wet-behind-the-ears curate who happens to be the nephew of his bishop.

==''Home Improvement'' connection==
Mike Weber appeared on ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' as the priest of [[Richard Karn]]'s character, [[Al Borland]]. He was hired to put in a new stand for a holy water basin in the season seven episode "Losing My Religion". Tim Taylor ended up cutting the hole too big, causing the basin to fall through the floor.

In the Season 1 finale episode "Cinderella and the Funeral", Al Borland appeared in order to fix the church's furnace. Reference was made to Tim and the holy water basin falling through the hole he cut.

[[Zachary Ty Bryan]] appeared in the episode "Public Embarrassment and Todd's First Sermon" playing Brad Taylor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8849">'''Stoic passions''' are various forms of [[emotional]] suffering in [[Stoicism]], a school of [[Hellenistic philosophy]].

==Definition==
''The passions'' are transliterated ''pathê'' from Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Blank, David - [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/philodemus/ "Philodemus"-2.2.4.4.2 On individual ethical topics (c.f. - 5th paragraph)] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)(published Wed Apr 10, 2013; substantive revision Mon Aug 4, 2014) [Retrieved 2015-3-15]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/transliterate Oxford Dictionary] - (Oxford University Press)[Retrieved 2015-3-15]&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek word ''pathos'' was a wide-ranging term indicating an infliction one suffers.&lt;ref name="annas103"&gt;{{Harvnb|Annas|1994|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Stoics used the word to discuss many common emotions such as anger, fear and excessive joy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Annas|1994|p=103-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chrysippus]] regarded the passions as evaluative judgements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dspace.ubvu.vu.nl/bitstream/handle/1871/34006/222931.pdf?sequen Groenendijk, Leendert F. and de Ruyter, Doret J.(2009) 'Learning from Seneca: a Stoic perspective on the art of living and education', Ethics and Education, 4: 1, 81 — 92 ] To link to this Article: DOI: 10.1080/17449640902816277 (alternative URL: [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17449640902816277 ''here'']) [Retrieved 2015-3-18]&lt;/ref&gt; A person experiencing such an emotion has incorrectly valued an indifferent thing.&lt;ref name="annas114"&gt;{{Harvnb|Annas|1994|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are harmful because they conflict with right reason.&lt;ref name="annas113"&gt;{{Harvnb|Annas|1994|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to reason correctly brings about the occurrence of ''pathē''.&lt;ref name="annas103"/&gt;

==Primary passions==
The Stoics beginning with [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] arranged the passions under four headings: distress, pleasure, fear and lust.&lt;ref name="sorabji29"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorabji|2000|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''On Passions'', [[Andronicus of Rhodes|Andronicus]] reported the Stoic definitions of these passions (trans. Long &amp; Sedley, pg. 411, modified):

; '''Distress''' ('''lupē'''): [[Stress (medicine)|Distress]] is an [[Irrationality|irrational]] contraction, or a fresh [[opinion]] that something bad is present, at which people think it right to be [[Depression (mood)|depressed]].
; '''Fear''' ('''phobos'''): [[Fear]] is an irrational [[Risk aversion|aversion]], or avoidance of an expected [[Risk|danger]].
; '''Lust''' ('''epithumia'''): [[Lust]] is an irrational desire, or pursuit of an expected [[Goodness and value theory|good]].
; '''Delight''' ('''hēdonē'''): Delight is an irrational swelling, or a fresh opinion that something good is present, at which people think it right to be [[Mania|elated]].

Two of these passions (distress and delight) refer to emotions currently present, and two of these (fear and lust) refer to emotions directed at the future.&lt;ref name="sorabji29"/&gt; Thus there are just two states directed at the prospect of good and evil, but subdivided as to whether they are present or future:&lt;ref name="graver54"&gt;{{Harvnb|Graver|2007|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1.0em auto;border:1px;background:white;"
|- style="background:white"
! &amp;nbsp; !! '''Present''' !! '''Future'''
|-
| '''Good'''  || Delight || Lust
|-
| '''Evil'''  || Distress || Fear 
|}

==Subdivisions==

Numerous subdivisions of the same class are brought under the head of the separate passions. The definitions are those of the translation of Cicero's ''Tusculan Disputations'' by J. E. King.

===Distress===

; Envy : [[Envy]] is distress incurred by reason of a [[neighbourhood|neighbor]]'s prosperity.
; Rivalry : Rivalry is distress, should another be in possession of the object desired and one has to go without it oneself.
; Jealousy : [[Jealousy]] is distress arising from the fact that the thing one has coveted oneself is in the possession of the other man as well as one's own.
; Compassion : [[Compassion]] is distress arising from the wretchedness of a neighbor in undeserved suffering.
; Anxiety : [[Anxiety]] is oppressive distress.
; Mourning : [[Mourning]] is distress arising from the untimely death of a beloved object.
; Sadness : [[Sadness]] is tearful distress.
; Troubling : Troubling is burdensome distress.
; Grief : [[Grief]] is torturing distress.
; Lamenting : Distress accompanied by wailing.
; Depression : [[Depression (mood)|Depression]] is distress accompanied by brooding.
; Vexation : Vexation is lasting distress.
; Despondency : Despondency is distress without any prospect of amelioration.

===Fear===

; Sluggishness : Sluggishness is fear of ensuing toil.
; Shame : [[Shame]] is fear of disgrace.
; Fright : [[Fear|Fright]] is paralyzing fear which causes paleness, trembling and chattering of teeth.
; Timidity : [[Timidity]] is fear of approaching [[evil]].
; Consternation : Consternation is fear upsetting the [[mind|mental]] balance.
; Pusillanimity : Pusillanimity is fear following on the heels of fright like an attendant.
; Bewilderment : Bewilderment is fear paralyzing [[thought]].
; Faintheartedness : Faintheartedness is lasting fear.

===Lust===

; Anger : [[Anger]] is lust of punishing the man who is thought to have inflicted an undeserved [[injury]].
; Rage : [[Rage (emotion)|Rage]] is anger springing up and suddenly showing itself.
; Hatred : [[Hate|Hatred]] is inveterate anger.
; Enmity : [[Enmity]] is anger watching as opportunity for [[revenge]].
; Wrath : [[Wrath]] is anger of greater bitterness conceived in the innermost heart and [[soul]].
; Greed : [[Seven deadly sins#Greed|Greed]] is insatiable lust.
; Longing : Longing is lust of beholding someone who is not present.

===Delight===

; Malice : [[:wikt:malice|Malice]] is [[pleasure]] derived from a neighbor's evil which brings no advantage to oneself.
; Rapture : [[Rapture]] is pleasure soothing the soul by charm of the sense of [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]].
; Ostentation : [[:wikt:ostentation|Ostentation]] is pleasure shown in outward demeanor and puffing oneself out extravagantly.

==Good feelings==
The wise person (''[[sophos]]'') is someone who is free from the passions (''[[apatheia]]''). Instead the sage experiences good-feelings (''[[eupatheia]]'') which are clear-headed.&lt;ref name="inwood705"&gt;{{Harvnb|Inwood|1999|p=705}}&lt;/ref&gt; These emotional impulses are not excessive, but nor are they diminished emotions.&lt;ref name="annas115"&gt;{{Harvnb|Annas|1994|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="graver52"&gt;{{Harvnb|Graver|2007|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead they are the correct rational emotions.&lt;ref name="graver52"/&gt; The Stoics listed the good-feelings under the headings of joy (''chara''), wish (''boulesis''), and caution (''eulabeia'').&lt;ref name="annas114"/&gt; Thus if something is present which is a genuine good, then the wise person experiences an uplift in the soul&amp;mdash;joy (''chara'').&lt;ref name="inwood701"&gt;{{Harvnb|Inwood|1999|p=701}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Stoics also subdivided the good-feelings:&lt;ref name="graver58"&gt;{{Harvnb|Graver|2007|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Joy:'''
**''Enjoyment''
**''Cheerfulness''
**''Good spirits''

*'''Wish:'''
**''Good intent''
**''Goodwill''
**''Welcoming''
**''Cherishing''
**''Love''

*'''Caution:'''
**''Moral shame''
**''Reverence''

'''''The Consolation of Philosophy''''' ({{lang-la|De consolatione philosophiae}}) is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] work by [[Boethius]], written around the year 524. It has been described as the single most important and influential work in the West on [[Medieval]] and early [[Renaissance]] [[Christianity]], as well as the last great Western work of the Classical Period.&lt;ref&gt;''The Consolation of Philosophy (Oxford World's Classics)'', Introduction (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dante Divine"&gt;[[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] placed Boethius the “last of the Romans and first of the Scholastics” among the doctors in his Paradise (see ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'') (see also below).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
{{quote|A golden volume not unworthy of the leisure of [[Plato]] or [[Cicero|Tully]] — &lt;small&gt;[[Edward Gibbon]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''The Consolation of Philosophy'' was written in AD 523 during a one-year imprisonment Boethius served while awaiting trial – and eventual execution – for the alleged crime of [[treason]] under the [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothic]] King [[Theodoric the Great]]. Boethius was at the very heights of power in [[Roman Empire|Rome]] and was brought down by treachery. This experience inspired the text, which reflects on how evil can exist in a world governed by God (the problem of [[theodicy]]), and how happiness is still attainable amidst fickle fortune, while also considering the nature of happiness and God. It has been described as "by far the most interesting example of [[prison literature]] the world has ever seen."&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia, [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02610b.htm ''Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius'']. The quote is commonly seen in a number of sources, but without attribution; the Catholic Encyclopedia article (by William Turner, 1907) is the oldest “known” citation found. In fact the phrase is originally from [https://archive.org/details/boethiusanessay00stewuoft ''Boethius, an essay''] (1891), by [[H. F. Stewart]], [https://archive.org/stream/boethiusanessay00stewuoft#page/107/mode/1up page 107] (past paragraph).&lt;/ref&gt;

A link to Christianity is often assumed, yet there is no reference made to Jesus Christ or Christianity or any other specific religion other than a few oblique references to Pauline scripture, such as the symmetry between the opening lines of Book 4 Chapter 3 and 1 Corinthians 9:24. God is however represented not only as an eternal and all-knowing being, but as the source of all Good.

Boethius writes the book as a conversation between himself and Lady Philosophy. Lady Philosophy consoles Boethius by discussing the transitory nature of fame and wealth ("no man can ever truly be secure until he has been forsaken by Fortune"), and the ultimate superiority of things of the mind, which she calls the "one true good". She contends that happiness comes from within, and that virtue is all that one truly has, because it is not imperilled by the vicissitudes of fortune.

Boethius engages questions such as the nature of [[predestination]] and [[free will]], why [[Problem of evil|evil men often prosper and good men fall into ruin]], [[human nature]], [[virtue]], and [[justice]]. He speaks about the nature of free will and [[determinism]] when he asks if God knows and sees all, or does man have free will. On human nature, Boethius says that humans are essentially good and only when they give in to “wickedness” do they “sink to the level of being an animal.” On justice, he says criminals are not to be abused, rather treated with sympathy and respect, using the analogy of doctor and patient to illustrate the ideal relationship between prosecutor and criminal.

In the ''Consolation'', Boethius answered religious questions without reference to Christianity, relying solely on natural philosophy and the Classical [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] tradition. He believed in the correspondence between faith and reason. The truths found in Christianity would be no different from the truths found in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Chadwick |first=Henry |editor=Edward Craig |encyclopedia=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |title=Boethius, Anicius Manlius Severinus (c.480-525/6) |year=1998 |publisher=Routledge |quote=The ''Opuscula sacra'' regard faith and reason as independent but parallel and compatible ways of attaining to higher metaphysical truths, and the independent validity of logical reasoning is also an underlying presupposition throughout ''De consolatione''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of Henry Chadwick, "If the ''Consolation'' contains nothing distinctively Christian, it is also relevant that it contains nothing specifically pagan either...[it] is a work written by a Platonist who is also a Christian."&lt;ref&gt;Henry Chadwick, ''Boethius: The Consolations of Music, Logic, Theology and Philosophy'', 1990, {{ISBN|0-19-826549-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[Carolingian]] epoch to the end of the Middle Ages and beyond it was one of the most popular and influential philosophical works, read by statesmen, poets, and historians, as well as of philosophers and theologians. It is through Boethius that much of the thought of the Classical period was made available to the Western Medieval world. It has often been said Boethius was the “[[last of the Romans]] and the first of the [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]]”.&lt;ref name="Dante Divine" /&gt;

[[Image:Consolation of philosophy 1385 boethius images.jpg|thumb|200px|From a 1385 Italian manuscript of the ''Consolation'': Miniatures of Boethius teaching and in prison]]

The philosophical message of the book fits well with the religious piety of the Middle Ages. Readers were encouraged not to seek worldly goods such as money and power, but to seek internalized virtues. Evil had a purpose, to provide a lesson to help change for good; while suffering from evil was seen as virtuous. Because God ruled the universe through Love, prayer to God and the application of Love would lead to true happiness.&lt;ref name="Beck"&gt;Sanderson Beck (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; The Middle Ages, with their vivid sense of an overruling fate, found in Boethius an interpretation of life closely akin to the spirit of Christianity. ''The Consolation of Philosophy'' stands, by its note of fatalism and its affinities with the Christian doctrine of humility, midway between the pagan philosophy of [[Seneca the Younger]] and the later Christian philosophy of consolation represented by [[Thomas á Kempis]].&lt;ref name=Cambridge&gt;''[[The Cambridge History of English and American Literature]]'', [http://www.bartleby.com/211/0605.html Volume I Ch.6.5: ''De Consolatione Philosophiae''], 1907–1921.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is heavily influenced by [[Plato]] and his [[Socratic Dialogue|dialogues]] (as was Boethius himself).&lt;ref name=Cambridge/&gt; Its popularity can in part be explained by its [[Neoplatonic]] and Christian ethical messages, although current scholarly research is still far from clear exactly why and how the work became so vastly popular in the Middle Ages.

[[Image:ForutuneWheel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Lady Fortune]] with [[Rota Fortunae|the Wheel of Fortune]] in a medieval manuscript of a work by [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]; ''The Consolation of Philosophy'' was responsible for the popularity of the goddess of Fortune and the wheel of fortune in the Middle Ages]]

Translations into the [[vernacular]] were done by famous notables, including [[King Alfred]] ([[Old English language|Old English]]), [[Jean de Meun]] ([[Old French]]), [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] ([[Middle English]]), [[Queen Elizabeth I]] ([[Early Modern English]]), and [[Notker Labeo]] ([[Old High German]]).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Found within the ''Consolation'' are themes that have echoed throughout the Western canon: the female figure of wisdom that informs Dante, the ascent through the layered universe that is shared with Milton, the reconciliation of opposing forces that find their way into Chaucer in The Knight's Tale, and the Wheel of Fortune so popular throughout the Middle Ages.

Citations from it occur frequently in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divina Commedia]]''. Of Boethius, Dante remarked ''“The blessed soul who exposes the deceptive world to anyone who gives ear to him.”&lt;ref&gt;''Dante ''The Divine Comedy''. “blessed souls” inhabit Dante's Paradise, and appear as flames. (see note above).&lt;/ref&gt;

Boethian influence can be found nearly everywhere in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s poetry, e.g. in ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'', ''[[The Knight's Tale]]'', ''[[The Clerk's Tale]]'', ''[[The Franklin's Tale]]'', ''[[The Parson's Tale]]'' and ''[[The Tale of Melibee]]'', in the character of Lady Nature in ''[[The Parliament of Fowls]]'' and some of the shorter poems, such as ''Truth'', ''The Former Age'' and ''Lak of Stedfastnesse''. Chaucer translated the work in his ''[[Boece (Chaucer)|Boece]]''.

The [[Italians|Italian]] composer [[Luigi Dallapiccola]] used some of the text in his choral work ''[[Canti di prigionia]]'' (1938).  The [[Australia]]n composer [[Peter Sculthorpe]] quoted parts of it in his opera or music theatre work ''[[Rites of Passage (Sculthorpe)|Rites of Passage]]'' (1972–73), which was commissioned for the opening of the [[Sydney Opera House]] but was not ready in time.

[[Tom Shippey]] in ''[[The Road to Middle-earth]]'' says how “Boethian” much of the treatment of evil is in [[Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Shippey says that Tolkien knew well the translation of Boethius that was made by King Alfred and he quotes some “Boethian” remarks from [[Frodo]], [[Treebeard]] and [[Elrond]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Shippey, ''The Road to Middle-earth'', pg. 140, {{ISBN|0-395-33973-1}}, (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

Boethius and ''Consolatio Philosophiae'' are cited frequently by the main character Ignatius J. Reilly in the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning ''[[A Confederacy of Dunces]]'' (1980).

It is a [[prosimetrum|prosimetrical]] text, meaning that it is written in alternating sections of [[prose]] and metered [[Meter (poetry)|verse]]. In the course of the text, Boethius displays a virtuosic command of the forms of [[Latin poetry]]. It is classified as a [[Menippean satire]], a fusion of [[allegory|allegorical]] tale, [[platonic dialogue]], and lyrical poetry.

In the 20th century there were close to four hundred manuscripts still surviving, a testament to its popularity.{{citation needed| date= March 2017}}

In 2016, researchers from the [[University of Cambridge]] reconstructed the original melodies to which The Consolation of Philosophy was performed 1,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;University of Cambridge, [http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/first-performance-in-1000-years-lost-songs-from-the-middle-ages-are-brought-back-to-life-0 ''First performance in 1000 years: lost songs are brought back to life by Cambridge researchers'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:crowley unicursal hexagram.svg|thumb|The [[Unicursal Hexagram]], one of the important symbols in Thelema, equivalent of the [[ancient Egyptian]] [[Ankh]] or the [[Rosicrucian]] [[Rosy Cross]] but first derived in 1639 by [[Blaise Pascal]]'s [[Pascal's theorem|Hexagrammum Mysticum]]]]

'''Thelema''' ({{IPAc-en|θ|ə|ˈ|l|iː|m|ə}}) is a social or spiritual philosophy derived from [[Western esotericism]]. The word ''thelema'' itself is Ancient or Koine Greek for ''will''. While Thelema is most often regarded as a [[religion]]—a [[new religious movement]] and contemporary [[mystery religion]] in particular—it is also referred to as a [[philosophy]], "religious philosophy", "spiritual philosophy", or "religious matrix". An adherent of Thelema is traditionally referred to as a ''Thelemite'', and all phenomena within the scope of Thelema are termed ''Thelemic''.

The fundamental axiom, tenet, or boilerplate underlying Thelema—known as the "Law of Thelema"—is "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law". The traditional corresponding phrase is "Love is the law, love under will."  These expressions can be characterized as having moral, mystical, and socio-political implications.  In the thelemic worldview or model, each person has a "[[True Will]]" and (insofar as each person acts in accordance with his or her Will) the nature of a person's interactions with the world (or universe) is a form of "love" or harmony.  This is expressed further by a third metaphor, "every man and every woman is a star," which portrays the distinct nature of every individual as residing in a non-overlapping point of space and time; collisions between different persons being infrequent if each is aware of—and acting in accordance with—their true purpose in life.  The overall conception is quite similar to Taoist philosophy but with a cosmological underpinning 2500 years more recent.

Thelema was developed in the early 1900s by [[Aleister Crowley]], an English writer, mystic, and [[ceremonial magic]]ian.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;Moore, John S. [http://www.mith.demon.co.uk/CROWLEY.htm Aleister Crowley as Guru] in ''Chaos International'', Issue No. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed himself to be the prophet of a new age, the [[Aeon (Thelema)|Æon of Horus]], based upon a spiritual experience that he and his wife, Rose Edith, had in [[Egypt]] in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7vITnmphx-kC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=ascension+magick|title=Ascension Magick|author= [[Christopher Penczak]]|publisher= Llewellyn|isbn=978-0-7387-1047-1|page=41|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; By his account, a possibly non-corporeal or "praeterhuman" being that called itself [[Aiwass]] contacted him and dictated a text known as ''[[The Book of the Law]]'' or ''Liber AL vel Legis'', which outlined the principles of Thelema.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;[[Robert Anton Wilson|Wilson, Robert Anton]]. ''[[The Illuminati Papers]]''. And/Or Press, 1980. {{ISBN|1-57951-002-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Thelemic pantheon]] includes a number of deities, primarily a trio adapted from [[ancient Egyptian religion]], who are the three speakers of ''The Book of the Law'': [[Nuit]], [[Hadit]] and [[Heru-ra-ha|Ra-Hoor-Khuit]]. Crowley described these deities as a "literary convenience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crowley|first=Aleister|title=The Book of the Law|year=1976|publisher=Red Wheel/Weiser, LLC|isbn=978-0-87728-334-8|page=Page 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The religion is founded upon the idea that the 20th century marked the beginning of the Aeon of Horus, in which a new ethical code would be followed: "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law". This statement indicates adherents, known as Thelemites, should seek and follow their true paths in life, known as their [[True Will|True Wills]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Rodney Orpheus|Orpheus, Rodney]]. ''Abrahadabra.'' Weiser, 2005, {{ISBN|1-57863-326-5}}, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy also emphasizes the ritual practice of [[Magick (Thelema)|Magick]].

The word ''thelema'' is the English transliteration of the [[Koine Greek]] noun θέλημα ({{IPA-grc|θélɛ:ma|pron}}) "will", from the verb [[Wiktionary:θέλω|θέλω]] "to will, wish, want or purpose." As Crowley developed the religion, he wrote widely on the topic, as well as producing more 'inspired' writing that he collectively termed [[The Holy Books of Thelema]]. He also included ideas from [[occult]]ism, [[yoga]], and both [[Eastern mysticism|Eastern]] and [[Western mysticism|Western]] [[mysticism]], especially the [[Qabalah]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Aleister Crowley|Crowley, Aleister]].[http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/libers/lib13.html Aleister Crowley, ''Liber XIII vel Graduum Montis Abiegni: A Syllabus of the Steps Upon the Path''], Hermetic webssite, retrieved July 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspects of Thelema and Crowley's thought in general provided inspiration for the development of [[Wicca]] and, to a certain degree, the rise of [[Modern Paganism]] as a whole, as well as, [[chaos magic]]k, and [[Satanism]]. Additionally, aspects of Thelema are believed by scholars such as [[Hugh Urban]] to have been an influence on the development of [[Scientology and the occult|Scientology]]&lt;ref name="Hugh B 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Urban|first1=Hugh B.|title=The Occult Roots of Scientology?: L.

==Historical precedents==
The word θέλημα (thelema) is rare in [[Classical Greek]], where it "signifies the appetitive will: desire, sometimes even sexual",&lt;ref name="Gauna"&gt;Gauna, Max. ''The Rabelaisian Mythologies'', pp. 90–91. Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1996. {{ISBN|0-8386-3631-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is frequent in the [[Septuagint]].&lt;ref name="Gauna" /&gt; Early Christian writings occasionally use the word to refer to the human will,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{bibleverse||John|1:12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even the will of God's opponent, the [[Devil]],&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{bibleverse|2|Timothy|2:26}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it usually refers to the will of God.&lt;ref name="de sales"&gt;Pocetto, Alexander T. [http://www4.desales.edu/~salesian/resources/articles/english/rabelais.html Rabelais, Francis de Sales and the ''Abbaye de Thélème''], retrieved July 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  

One well-known example is in the "[[Lord's Prayer]]" ({{bibleverse||Matthew|6:10}}), “Thy kingdom come. Thy will (Θελημα) be done, On earth as it is in heaven.” It is used later in the same gospel ({{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|26:42}}), "He went away again a second time and prayed, saying, "My Father, if this cannot pass away unless I drink it, Thy will be done."  In his 5th-century Sermon on {{bibleverse|1|John|4:4–12}}, [[Augustine of Hippo]] gave a similar instruction:&lt;ref&gt;Sutin, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; "Love, and what thou wilt, do." (''Dilige et quod vis fac'').&lt;ref&gt;''The Works of Saint Augustine: A New Translation for the 21st Century'', (Sermons 148–153), 1992, part 3, vol. 5, p. 182. {{ISBN|1-56548-007-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Renaissance]], a character named "Thelemia" represents will or desire in the ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'' of the Dominican monk [[Francesco Colonna]]. The protagonist Poliphilo has two allegorical guides, Logistica (reason) and Thelemia (will or desire). When forced to choose, he chooses fulfillment of his sexual will over logic.&lt;ref&gt;Salloway, David. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=k_jf0_-R6hsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Random+walks++By+David+Solway&amp;lr=#PPR7,M1 Random Walks]'', p. 203. McGill-Queen's Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-7735-1679-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colonna's work was a great influence on the [[Franciscan]] monk [[François Rabelais]], who in the 16th century, used ''Thélème'', the French form of the word, as the name of a fictional abbey in his novels, ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]''.&lt;ref name=Rabelais&gt;Rabelais, François. ''Gargantua and Pantagruel''. Everyman's Library. {{ISBN|978-0-679-43137-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Rabelais, François |volume=22 |page=771 |first=George |last=Saintsbury}}&lt;/ref&gt;The only rule of this Abbey was "fay çe que vouldras" &lt;!-- please do not "fix" this quote; it is a direct quote in archaic French. Thanks --&gt; (''"Fais ce que tu veux"'', or, "Do what thou wilt"). 

In the mid-18th century, [[Francis Dashwood, 11th Baron le Despencer|Sir Francis Dashwood]] inscribed the adage on a doorway of his abbey at [[Medmenham]],&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Buckinghamshire |volume=4 |page=731}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it served as the motto of the [[Hellfire Club]].&lt;ref name=EB /&gt;  Rabelais's Abbey of Thelema has been referred to by later writers Sir [[Walter Besant]] and [[James Rice (writer)|James Rice]], in their novel ''[[The Monks of Thelema]]'' (1878), and [[C. R. Ashbee]] in his utopian romance ''The Building of Thelema'' (1910).

=== The term Thelema ===
==== Thelema in Classical Greek ====

As the forerunner of today's concept of will, the Greek '' boule '' (βουλή) is considered by [[Classics#Philology|classic philology]], not '' thelo '' (θέλω) or 'thelema'.

There are, in Greek, two words for will, which are used, for example, in [[New Testament]] partly [[synonymy|synonym]]: '' thelema '' and '' boule ''.

* 'Boule' means 'will', 'intention', 'counsel', 'project' (i.e. a will with purpose)
* Thelema is a rarely used in classical Greek. There are very few documents, the earliest being [[Sophistic works of Antiphon|Antiphon the Sophist]] (5th century BCE). In antiquity it was beside the divine will which a man performs, just as much for the will of sexual desire. The intention of the individual was less understood as an overall, generalized, [[ontology|ontological]] place wherever it was arranged.&lt;ref&gt;Federico Tolli: ''Thelema im Spannungsfeld zwischen Christentum, Logentradition und New Aeon.'' Edition Araki, 1. Aufl., Leipzig, 2004, S. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The verb '' thelo '' appears very early ([[Homer]], early Attic inscriptions) and has the meaning of 'ready', 'Decide' and 'desire' (Homer, 3, 272, also in the sexual sense).

"[[Aristotle]] says in the book '' de plantis '' that the goal of the human will is perception - unlike the plants that do not have 'epithymia' (translation of the author). "Thelema," says the Aristoteles, "has changed here, epithymia," and thelema, "and that thelema" is to be neutral, not somehow morally determined, the covetous driving force in man.&lt;ref&gt;Federico Tolli: ''Thelema im Spannungsfeld zwischen Christentum, Logentradition und New Aeon.'' 1st ed., Leipzig, 2004, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Thelema in the Old Testament ====

In [[Septuagint]]a the term is used for the will of God himself, the religious desire of the God-fearing, and the royal will of a secular ruler. It is thus used only for the representation of high ethical willingness in the faith, the exercise of authority by the authorities, or the non-human will, but not for more profane striving.&lt;ref&gt;Federico Tolli: ''Thelema - im Spannungsfeld zwischen Christentum, Logentradition und New Aeon'', Edition Araki, 1. Aufl., Leipzig, 2004, S. 11&lt;/ref&gt; In the translation of the Greek [[Old Testament]]  (the [[Septuaginta]]), the terms "boule" and "thelema" appear, whereas in the [[Vulgate]] text, the terms are translated into the [[Latin]] "Voluntas" ('will'). Thus, the different meaning of both concepts was lost.

==== Thelema in the New Testament ====

In the New Testament in [[Koine]] 'thelema' is used 62 times, twice in the plural ('' thelemata ''). Here, God's will is always and exclusively designated by the word "thelemma" (θέλημα, mostly in the singular), as the theologian Federico Tolli points out by means of the Theological Dictionary of the New Testament of 1938. ("Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven). In the same way the term is used in the Apostle [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] and [[Ignatius of Antioch]]. For Tolli it follows that the genuine idea of Thema does not contradict the teachings of Jesus (Tolli, 2004).

===François Rabelais===
{{Main|François Rabelais}}
[[File:Francois Rabelais - Portrait.jpg|thumb|[[François Rabelais]]]]
François Rabelais was a [[Franciscan]] and later a [[Benedictine]] monk of the 16th century. Eventually he left the monastery to study medicine, and moved to the French city of [[Lyon]] in 1532. There he wrote ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]],'' a connected series of books. They tell the story of two giants—a father (Gargantua) and his son (Pantagruel) and their adventures—written in an amusing, extravagant, and satirical vein.

Most critics today agree that Rabelais wrote from a [[Christian humanism|Christian humanist]] perspective.&lt;ref name="Bowen"&gt;Bowen, Barbara. ''Enter Rabelais, Laughing'', p. 2. Vanderbilt University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-8265-1306-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Crowley biographer Lawrence Sutin notes this when contrasting the French author's beliefs with the Thelema of [[Aleister Crowley]].&lt;ref name="SutinRab"&gt;Sutin, Lawrence. ''Do What Thou Wilt: A Life of Aleister Crowley'', p. 126. New York, NY: St. Martin's Griffin, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-312-28897-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the previously mentioned story of Thélème, which critics analyze as referring in part to the suffering of loyal Christian reformists or "evangelicals"&lt;ref&gt;"Rabelais, like his protectress Marguerite de Navarre, was an evangelical rather than a Protestant", definition follows. Catharine Randall, "Reformation," ''The Rabelais Encyclopedia'', edited by Elizabeth Chesney Zegura. p. 207.

Bruce Hayes, "enigmatic prophecy" entry in ''The Rabelais Encyclopedia'' p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; the reference to the Greek word θέλημα "declares that the will of God rules in this abbey".&lt;ref&gt;Marian Rothstein, "Thélème, ABBEY OF" entry in ''The Rabelais Encyclopedia'' p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sutin writes that Rabelais was no precursor of Thelema, with his beliefs containing elements of [[Stoicism]] and Christian kindness.&lt;ref name="SutinRab" /&gt;

In his first book (ch. 52–57), Rabelais writes of this Abbey of Thélème, built by the giant Gargantua. It is a classical [[utopia]] presented in order to critique and assess the state of the society of Rabelais's day, as opposed to a modern utopian text that seeks to create the scenario in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, Peter G. "Utopia and Anti-Utopia in Rousseau's Thought" in Rubin &amp; Stroup (1999), p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a utopia where people's desires are more fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, Peter G. "Utopia and Anti-Utopia in Rousseau's Thought" in Rubin &amp; Stroup (1999), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;  Satirical, it also epitomises the ideals considered in Rabelais's fiction.&lt;ref name=Rothstein&gt;Rothstein, Marian. "[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/french_forum/v026/26.1rothstein.pdf Androgyne, Agape, and the Abbey of Thélème]" ([[PDF]]) p. 17, n. 23, in ''French Forum'', V. 26, No. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  The inhabitants of the abbey were governed only by their own free will and pleasure, the only rule being "Do What Thou Wilt". Rabelais believed that men who are free, well born and bred have honour, which intrinsically leads to virtuous actions. When constrained, their noble natures turn instead to remove their servitude, because men desire what they are denied.&lt;ref name="Rabelais"/&gt;

Some modern Thelemites consider Crowley's work to build upon Rabelais's summary of the instinctively honourable nature of the Thelemite. Rabelais has been variously credited with the creation of the [[philosophy]]&lt;ref&gt;Thelema is seen by some neutral parties as a philosophy, and not a religion. See Crowley, Aleister. ''Little Essays Toward Truth'', pp. 61–62 [[New Falcon Publications]]; 2 Rev Sub edition (May 1, 1996) {{ISBN|1-56184-000-9}} ("These and similar considerations lead to certain types of philosophical skepticism. Neschamic conceptions are nowise exempt from this criticism, for, even supposing them identical in any number of persons, their expression, being intellectual, will suffer the same stress as normal perceptions. [...] But none of this shakes, or even threatens, the Philosophy of Thelema. On the contrary, it may be called the Rock of its foundation."); See also Thelemapedia, "Arguments against Thelema being a religion" available at: http://www.thelemapedia.org/index.php/Arguments_against_Thelema_being_a_religion&lt;/ref&gt; of Thelema, as one of the earliest people to refer to it,&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;Edwards, Linda.

Grand Lodge], August 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aleister Crowley wrote in ''The Antecedents of Thelema,'' (1926), an incomplete work not published in his day, that Rabelais not only set forth the law of Thelema in a way similar to how Crowley understood it, but predicted and described in code Crowley's life and the holy text that he claimed to have received, ''[[The Book of the Law]]''. Crowley said the work he had received was deeper, showing in more detail the technique people should practice, and revealing scientific mysteries. He said that Rabelais confines himself to portraying an ideal, rather than addressing questions of political economy and similar subjects, which must be solved in order to realize the Law.&lt;ref&gt;Aleister Crowley, 1926, "The Antecedents of Thelema," in ''The Revival of Magick'', edited by [[Hymenaeus Beta]] &amp; R. Kaczynski.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabelais is included among the [[Saints of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica]].&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. [http://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/lib15.htm Liber XV], [[The Gnostic Mass]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Francis Dashwood and the Hellfire Club===
[[File:Hogarth Dashwood.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Francis Dashwood, 11th Baron le Despencer]], by [[William Hogarth]] from the late 1750s]]
[[Francis Dashwood, 11th Baron le Despencer|Sir Francis Dashwood]] adopted some of the ideas of Rabelais and invoked the same rule in French, when he founded a group called the Monks of [[Medmenham]] (better known as the [[Hellfire Club]]).&lt;ref name=EB /&gt; An abbey was established at Medmenham, in a property which incorporated the ruins of a [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] abbey founded in 1201.  The group was known as the Franciscans, not after Saint [[Francis of Assisi]], but after its founder, [[Francis Dashwood, 11th Baron le Despencer]]. [[John Wilkes]], [[George Dodington, 1st Baron Melcombe|George Dodington]] and other politicians were members.&lt;ref name=EB /&gt;  There is little direct evidence of what Dashwood's Hellfire Club practiced or believed.&lt;ref name="bcy"&gt;Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon.

In the opinion of Lt. Col. Towers, the group derived more from Rabelais than the inscription over the door. He believes that they used caves as a [[Dionysian]] [[oracular]] temple, based upon Dashwood’s reading of the relevant chapters of Rabelais.&lt;ref&gt;Towers (1987) quoted in Coppens (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sir Nathaniel Wraxall, 1st Baronet|Sir Nathaniel Wraxall]] in his ''Historical Memoires'' (1815) accused the Monks of performing Satanic rituals, but these claims have been dismissed as hearsay.&lt;ref name="bcy" /&gt; [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] and others such as Mike Howard&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Mike.

==Beliefs==

{{main|Aleister Crowley}}

Thelema was founded by [[Aleister Crowley]] (1875&amp;ndash;1947) who was an English occultist and writer. In 1904, Crowley claimed to have received ''The Book of the Law'' from an entity named [[Aiwass]], which was to serve as the foundation of the religious and philosophical system he called Thelema.&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. "De Lege Libellum", in ''The Equinox'' III(1) (Detroit: Universal, 1919).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Book of the Law''===
{{Main|The Book of the Law}}
Crowley's system of Thelema begins with ''The Book of the Law'', which bears the official name ''[[Liber AL vel Legis]]''. It was written in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]] during his honeymoon with his new wife [[Rose Edith Kelly|Rose Crowley]] (née Kelly). This small book contains three chapters, each of which he claimed to have written in exactly one hour, beginning at noon, on April 8, April 9, and April 10, 1904. Crowley claims that he took dictation from an entity named [[Aiwass]], whom he later identified as his own [[Holy Guardian Angel]].&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. ''The Equinox of the Gods''. New Falcon Publications, 1991. {{ISBN|978-1-56184-028-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disciple, author, and onetime Crowley secretary [[Israel Regardie]] prefers to attribute this voice to the subconscious, but opinions among Thelemites differ widely.  Crowley claimed that "no forger could have prepared so complex a set of numerical and literal puzzles" and that study of the text would dispel all doubts about the method of how the book was obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crowley|first=Aleister|title=The Equinox of the Gods – Chapter 7|url=http://hermetic.com/crowley/equinox-of-the-gods/eqotg7.html|work=The Equinox of the Gods|publisher=Hermetic.com|accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the reference to Rabelais, an analysis by Dave Evans shows similarities to ''The Beloved of Hathor and Shrine of the Golden Hawk'',&lt;ref&gt;Farr, F., &amp; Shakespear, O. ''The Beloved of Hathor and the Shrine of the Golden Hawk''. Croydon. Farncombe &amp; Son. Dating uncertain, approx. 1902&lt;/ref&gt; a play by [[Florence Farr]].&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Dave. ''Aleister Crowley and the 20th Century Synthesis of Magick'', p. 10, pp. 26–30. Hidden Publishing, Second Revised Edition, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9555237-2-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans says this may result from the fact that "both Farr and Crowley were thoroughly steeped in [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]] imagery and teachings",&lt;ref&gt;Dave Evans, "Strange distant Gods that are not dead today", p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and that Crowley probably knew the ancient materials that inspired some of Farr's motifs.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Strange Gods p3&lt;/ref&gt; Sutin also finds similarities between Thelema and the work of [[W. B. Yeats]], attributing this to "shared insight" and perhaps to the older man's knowledge of Crowley.&lt;ref&gt;Sutin pp 68, 137–138&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowley wrote several commentaries on ''The Book of the Law'', the last of which he wrote in 1925. This brief statement called simply "[[The Book of the Law#The Comment|The Comment]]" warns against discussing the book's contents, and states that all "questions of the Law are to be decided only by appeal to my writings" and is signed [[Ankh-af-na-khonsu]].&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. ''Liber AL vel Legis''&lt;/ref&gt;

===True Will===
{{Main|True Will}}
According to Crowley, every individual has a ''True Will'', to be distinguished from the ordinary wants and desires of the ego. The True Will is essentially one's "calling" or "purpose" in life. Some later magicians have taken this to include the goal of attaining self-realization by one's own efforts, without the aid of God or other divine authority. This brings them close to the position that Crowley held just prior to 1904.&lt;ref name=UD&gt;Frater U.D. ''High Magic: Theory &amp; Practice''. Llewellyn Worldwide, 2005. p. 214. {{ISBN|0-7387-0471-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others follow later works such as ''Liber II'', saying that one's own will in pure form is nothing other than the divine will.&lt;ref&gt;"But the Magician knows that the pure Will of every man and every woman is already in perfect harmony with the divine Will; in fact they are one and the same" -[[Lon Milo DuQuette|DuQuette, Lon Milo]]. ''The Magick of Aleister Crowley: A Handbook of the Rituals of Thelema'', p. 12. Weiser, 2003. {{ISBN|1-57863-299-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law'' for Crowley refers not to [[hedonism]], fulfilling everyday desires, but to acting in response to that calling.  The Thelemite is a mystic.&lt;ref name=UD /&gt;  According to [[Lon Milo DuQuette]], a Thelemite is anyone who bases their actions on striving to discover and accomplish their true will,&lt;ref&gt;DuQuette, Lon Milo, ''Angels, demons &amp; gods of the new millennium'', Weiser, 1997, {{ISBN|1-57863-010-X}}, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; when a person does their True Will, it is like an orbit, their niche in the universal order, and the universe assists them.&lt;ref&gt;DuQuette, Lon Milo, ''The Magick of Aleister Crowley'', Weiser, 2003, {{ISBN|1-57863-299-4}}, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  

In order for the individual to be able to follow their True Will, the everyday self's socially-instilled inhibitions may have to be overcome via deconditioning.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Brian. ''Religion and anthropology'', Cambridge University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-521-85241-2}}, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Graham. ''Listening People, Speaking Earth'',  C. Hurst &amp; Co., 1997, {{ISBN|1-85065-272-4}} p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;  Crowley believed that in order to discover the True Will, one had to free the desires of the [[subconscious]] mind from the control of the conscious mind, especially the restrictions placed on sexual expression, which he associated with the power of divine creation.&lt;ref&gt;Sutin, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; He identified the True Will of each individual with the [[Holy Guardian Angel]], a ''[[daemon (mythology)|daimon]]'' unique to each individual.&lt;ref&gt;Hymenaeus Beta (ed.) in Crowley, Aleister.

===Cosmology===
Thelema draws its principal gods and goddesses from [[Ancient Egyptian religion]]. The highest deity in the cosmology of Thelema is the goddess [[Nuit]]. She is the night sky arched over the Earth symbolized in the form of a naked woman. She is conceived as the Great Mother, the ultimate source of all things.&lt;ref name=Orpheus&gt;Orpheus, Rodney. ''Abrahadabra: Understanding Aleister Crowley's Thelemic Magick'', pp. 33–44. Weiser, 2005. {{ISBN|1-57863-326-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second principal deity of Thelema is the god [[Hadit]], conceived as the infinitely small point, complement and consort of Nuit.  Hadit symbolizes manifestation, motion, and time.&lt;ref name=Orpheus /&gt; He is also described in ''Liber AL vel Legis'' as "the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of every star".&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. ''Liber AL vel Legis'', II,6.&lt;/ref&gt;  The third deity in the cosmology of Thelema is [[Ra-Hoor-Khuit]], a manifestation of [[Horus]]. He is symbolized as a throned man with the head of a [[hawk]] who carries a wand. He is associated with the [[Sun]] and the active energies of Thelemic [[Magick (Thelema)|magick]].&lt;ref name=Orpheus /&gt;  

Other deities within the cosmology of Thelema are [[Hoor-paar-kraat]] (or [[Harpocrates]]), god of silence and inner strength, the brother of Ra-Hoor-Khuit,&lt;ref name=Orpheus /&gt; [[Babalon]], the goddess of all pleasure, known as the Virgin Whore,&lt;ref name=Orpheus /&gt; and [[Therion (Thelema)|Therion]], the beast that Babalon rides, who represents the wild animal within man, a force of nature.&lt;ref name=Orpheus /&gt;

===Magick and ritual===
{{Main|Magick (Thelema)|Thelemic mysticism}}

Thelemic magick is a system of physical, mental, and spiritual exercises which practitioners believe are of benefit.&lt;ref&gt;DuQuette, Lon Milo in Orpheus, Rodney. ''Abrahadabra'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Crowley defined magick as "the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will",&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. ''Magick, Book 4'', Introduction to Part III&lt;/ref&gt; and spelled it with a 'k' to distinguish it from stage magic.  He recommended magick as a means for discovering the [[True Will]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Gerald Brosseau. ''The Meaning of Witchcraft'', p. 86. Red Wheel, 2004. {{ISBN|1-57863-309-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, magical practices in Thelema are designed to assist in finding and manifesting the True Will, although some include celebratory aspects as well.&lt;ref name=DuQuette&gt;DuQuette, Lon Milo. ''The Magick of Thelema''&lt;/ref&gt;  Crowley was a prolific writer, integrating Eastern practices with Western magical practices from the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]].&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Joanne. ''A Popular Dictionary of Paganism'', p. 44. Routledge, 2002. {{ISBN|0-7007-1591-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recommended a number of these practices to his followers, including basic [[yoga]]; ([[asana]] and [[pranayama]]);&lt;ref&gt;Orpheus, pp. 9–16, 45–52&lt;/ref&gt; rituals of his own devising or based on those of the Golden Dawn, such as the ''[[Lesser ritual of the pentagram]]'', for banishing and invocation;&lt;ref name=DuQuette /&gt; ''[[Liber Samekh]]'', a ritual for the invocation of the [[Holy Guardian Angel]];&lt;ref name=DuQuette /&gt; [[Magick (Aleister Crowley)#Eucharist|eucharistic rituals]] such as ''[[The Gnostic Mass]]'' and ''The Mass of the Phoenix'';&lt;ref name=DuQuette /&gt; and ''[[Prayer#Thelema|Liber Resh]]'', consisting of four daily adorations to the sun.&lt;ref name=DuQuette /&gt;  Much of his work is readily available in print and online. He also discussed [[sex magick]] and sexual gnosis in various forms including [[masturbation|masturbatory]], [[hetrosexuality|heterosexual]], and [[homosexuality|homosexual]] practices, and these form part of his suggestions for the work of those in the higher degrees of the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]].&lt;ref&gt;Urban, Hugh. ''Magia Sexualis: Sex, Magic, and Liberation in Modern Western Esotericism''. University of California Press, 2006. {{ISBN|0-520-24776-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Crowley believed that after discovering the True Will, the magician must also remove any elements of himself that stand in the way of its success.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. ''Magick, Book 4''&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Tree of life wk 02.svg|thumb|right|The [[Hermetic Qabalah|qabalistic]] tree of life, important in the magical order [[A∴A∴]] as the degrees of advancement in are related to it.]]

The emphasis of Thelemic magick is not directly on material results, and while many Thelemites do practice magick for goals such as wealth or love, it is not required. Those in a Thelemic magical Order, such as the [[A∴A∴]], or [[Ordo Templi Orientis]], work through a series of degrees or grades via a process of initiation. Thelemites who work on their own or in an independent group try to achieve this ascent or the purpose thereof using the [[Holy Books of Thelema]] and/or Crowley's more secular works as a guide, along with their own intuition.  Thelemites, both independent ones and those affiliated with an order, can practice a form of performative prayer known as ''[[Prayer#Thelema|Liber Resh]]''.

One goal in the study of Thelema within the magical Order of the A∴A∴ is for the magician to obtain the knowledge and conversation of the [[Holy Guardian Angel]]: conscious communication with their own personal [[daimon]], thus gaining knowledge of their True Will.&lt;ref&gt;Whitcomb, Bill. ''The Magician's Companion.''  Llewellyn, 1993, {{ISBN|0-87542-868-1}}, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; The chief task for one who has achieved this goes by the name of "crossing the [[Abyss (Thelema)|abyss]]";&lt;ref&gt;Whitcomb, Bill.

If the aspirant is unprepared, he will cling to the ego instead, becoming a Black Brother. Rather than becoming one with God, the Black Brother considers his ego to be god.&lt;ref&gt;Kaczinski, Richard. Wasserman, James. ''Weiser Concise Guide to Aleister Crowley'' Weiser, 2009. {{ISBN|1-57863-456-3}}, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Crowley, the Black Brother slowly disintegrates, while preying on others for his own self-aggrandisement.&lt;ref&gt;Cavendish, Richard. ''The Black Arts'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 1977, {{ISBN|0-330-25140-6}}, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowley taught [[scepticism|skeptical]] examination of all results obtained through [[meditation]] or [[Magick (Thelema)|magick]], at least for the student.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. [http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/libers/libero.html Liber O], I.2–5&lt;/ref&gt; He tied this to the necessity of keeping a [[Magick (Thelema)#Magical record|magical record]] or diary, that attempts to list all conditions of the event.&lt;ref&gt;''Liber E vel Exercitiorum'', section I in its entirety.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, James. ''Aleister Crowley and the Practice of the Magical Diary''. Weiser, 2006. {{ISBN|1-57863-372-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Remarking on the similarity of statements made by spiritually advanced people of their experiences, he said that fifty years from his time they would have a scientific name based on "an understanding of the phenomenon" to replace such terms as "spiritual" or "supernatural". Crowley stated that his work and that of his followers used "the method of science; the aim of religion",&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. Liber ABA (''[[Magick (Book 4)]]'' Part 1 (written 1912–13)&lt;/ref&gt; and that the genuine powers of the magician could in some way be objectively tested. This idea has been taken on by later practitioners of Thelema, [[chaos magic]] and magick in general.  They may consider that they are testing hypotheses with each magical experiment. The difficulty lies in the broadness of their definition of success,&lt;ref&gt;Luhrmann, Tanya. ''Persuasions of the witch's craft'', p. 124. Harvard University Press, 1991. {{ISBN|0-674-66324-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they may see as evidence of success things which a non-magician would not define as such, leading to [[confirmation bias]]. Crowley believed he could demonstrate, by his own example, the effectiveness of magick in producing certain subjective experiences that do not ordinarily result from taking [[hashish]], enjoying oneself in Paris, or walking through the [[Sahara]] desert.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, ''John St. John'', entries for 2.5 and 2.22 on the Eleventh Day.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not strictly necessary to practice ritual techniques to be a Thelemite, as due to the focus of Thelemic magick on the [[True Will]], Crowley stated "every intentional act is a magickal act".&lt;ref&gt;Kraig, Donald Michael. ''Modern Magick,'' Llewellyn, 1988, {{ISBN|0-87542-324-8}} p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===
[[Liber AL vel Legis]] does make clear some standards of individual conduct. The primary of these is "Do what thou wilt" which is presented as the whole of the law, and also as a right.  Some interpreters of Thelema believe that this right includes an obligation to allow others to do their own wills without interference,&lt;ref&gt;Suster, Gerald. ''The legacy of the beast'' W.H. Allen, 1988, {{ISBN|0-491-03446-6}} p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; but ''Liber AL'' makes no clear statement on the matter.  Crowley himself wrote that there was no need to detail the ethics of Thelema, for everything springs from "Do what thou Wilt".&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. Symonds, John. Grant, Kenneth. ''The confessions of Aleister Crowley'' Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1979, p. 400&lt;/ref&gt; Crowley wrote several additional documents presenting his personal beliefs regarding individual conduct in light of the Law of Thelema, some of which do address the topic interference with others: [[Liber OZ]], ''Duty'', and ''Liber II''.

''Liber Oz'' enumerates some of the rights of the individual implied by the one overarching right, "Do what thou wilt". For each person, these include the right to: live by one's own law; live in the way that one wills to do; work, play, and rest as one will; die when and how one will; eat and drink what one will; live where one will; move about the earth as one will; think, speak, write, draw, paint, carve, etch, mould, build, and dress as one will; love when, where and with whom one will; and kill those who would thwart these rights.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. [http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/libers/lib77.html Liber OZ]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Duty'' is described as "A note on the chief rules of practical conduct to be observed by those who accept the Law of Thelema."&lt;ref name=Appendix1&gt;Crowley, Aleister. ''Magick, Book 4'', Appendix I: "Official Instructions of the O.T.O", p. 484&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a numbered "Liber" as are all the documents which Crowley intended for [[A∴A∴]], but rather listed as a document intended specifically for [[Ordo Templi Orientis]].&lt;ref name=Appendix1 /&gt; There are four sections:&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. [http://lib.oto-usa.org/crowley/essays/duty.html Duty].&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''A. Your Duty to Self:''' describes the self as the center of the universe, with a call to learn about one's inner nature. Admonishes the reader to develop every faculty in a balanced way, establish one's autonomy, and to devote oneself to the service of one's own [[True Will]].
*'''B. Your Duty to Others:''' An admonishment to eliminate the illusion of separateness between oneself and all others, to fight when necessary, to avoid interfering with the Wills of others, to enlighten others when needed, and to worship the divine nature of all other beings.
*'''C. Your Duty to Mankind:''' States that the Law of Thelema should be the sole basis of conduct. That the laws of the land should have the aim of securing the greatest liberty for all individuals. Crime is described as being a violation of one's True Will.
*'''D. Your Duty to All Other Beings and Things:''' States that the Law of Thelema should be applied to all problems and used to decide every ethical question.  It is a violation of the Law of Thelema to use any animal or object for a purpose for which it is unfit, or to ruin things so that they are useless for their purpose.  Natural resources can be used by man, but this should not be done wantonly, or the breach of the law will be avenged.

In ''Liber II: The Message of the Master Therion'', the Law of Thelema is summarized succinctly as "Do what thou wilt—then do nothing else." Crowley describes the pursuit of Will as not only with detachment from possible results, but with tireless energy.  It is [[Nirvana]] but in a dynamic rather than static form.  The [[True Will]] is described as the individual's orbit, and if they seek to do anything else, they will encounter obstacles, as doing anything other than the will is a hindrance to it.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. [http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/libers/lib2.html Liber II: The Message of the Master Therion]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary practice==

===Diversity===
The core of Thelemic thought is "Do what thou wilt". However, beyond this, there exists a very wide range of interpretation of Thelema. Modern Thelema is a syncretic philosophy and religion,&lt;ref name=EMWNP&gt;Rabinovitch, Shelley; Lewis, James. ''The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism'',, pp. 267&amp;ndash;270. Citadel Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-8065-2406-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many Thelemites try to avoid strongly dogmatic or fundamentalist thinking. Crowley himself put strong emphasis on the unique nature of Will inherent in each individual, not following him, saying he did not wish to found a flock of sheep.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. ''The Confessions of Aleister Crowley'', ch. 66&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, contemporary Thelemites may practice more than one religion, including [[Wicca]], [[Gnosticism]], [[Satanism]], [[Setianism]] and [[Luciferianism]].&lt;ref name=EMWNP /&gt; Many adherents of Thelema, none more so than Crowley, recognize correlations between Thelemic and other systems of spiritual thought; most borrow freely from the methods and practices of other traditions, including [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], [[qabalah]], [[tantra]], [[tarot divination]] and [[yoga]].&lt;ref name=EMWNP /&gt; For example, [[Nuit|Nu]] and [[Hadit|Had]] are thought to correspond with the [[Tao]] and [[De (Chinese)|Teh]] of [[Taoism]], [[Shakti]] and [[Shiva]] of the Hindu [[Tantra]]s, [[Shunyata]] and [[Bodhicitta]] of [[Buddhism]], [[Ein Sof (Kabbalah)|Ain Soph]] and [[Keter (Kabbalah)|Kether]] in the [[Hermetic Qabalah]].&lt;ref&gt;Orpheus, p. 124 (Qabalah) and p. 131 (on ''Liber 777'').&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suster, p. 184 for Nuit and Tao, p. 188 for Hadit, Kether and Tao Teh, p. 146 &amp; 150 for link to Tantra.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Bethel &amp; Michael McDaniel, [http://english.najoomi.com/articles/1395/Aviation/Kundalini-Rising-A-Comparative-Thesis-on-Thelema-and-Kashm.html Kundalini Rising – A Comparative Thesis on Thelema and Kashm]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, retrieved March 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. "777 Revised" in ''The Qabalah of Aleister Crowley''. New York: Samuel Weiser, 1973. {{ISBN|0-87728-222-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some Thelemites who do accept ''[[The Book of the Law]]'' in some way but not the rest of Crowley's "inspired" writings or teachings. Others take only specific aspects of his overall system, such as his magical techniques, ethics, mysticism, or religious ideas, while ignoring the rest.  Other individuals who consider themselves Thelemites regard what is commonly presented as Crowley's system to be only one possible manifestation of Thelema, creating original systems, such as those of [[Nema (occultist)|Nema]] and [[Kenneth Grant]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}  And one category of Thelemites are non-religious, and simply adhere to the [[philosophical law]] of Thelema.

===Holidays===
The [[Book of the Law]] gives several holy days to be observed by Thelemites. There are no established or dogmatic ways to celebrate these days, so as a result Thelemites will often take to their own devices or celebrate in groups, especially within [[Ordo Templi Orientis]]. These holy days are usually observed on the following dates:

* March 20. '''The Feast of the Supreme Ritual''', which celebrates the Invocation of Horus, the ritual performed by Crowley on this date in 1904 that inaugurated the New Aeon.
* March 20/March 21. The '''Equinox of the Gods''', which is commonly referred to as the '''Thelemic [[New Year]]''' (although some celebrate the New Year on April 8). Although the [[equinox]] and the Invocation of Horus often fall on the same day, they are often treated as two different events. This date is the Autumnal equinox in the Southern Hemisphere.
* April 8 through April 10. '''The Feast of the Three Days of the Writing of the Book of the Law.''' These three days are commemorative of the three days in the year 1904 during which [[Aleister Crowley]] wrote the [[Book of the Law]]. One chapter was written each day, the first being written on April 8, the second on April 9, and the third on April 10. Although there is no official way of celebrating any Thelemic holiday, this particular feast day is usually celebrated by reading the corresponding chapter on each of the three days, usually at noon.
* June 20/June 21. The '''[[Summer solstice]]''' in the Northern Hemisphere and the [[Winter solstice]] in the Southern Hemisphere.
* August 12. '''The Feast of the Prophet and His Bride.''' This holiday commemorates the marriage of [[Aleister Crowley]] and his first wife [[Rose Edith Crowley]]. Rose was a key figure in the writing of the Book of the Law.
* September 22/September 23. The '''[[Autumnal equinox]]''' in the Northern Hemisphere and the Vernal Equinox in the Southern Hemisphere.
* December 21/December 22. The '''[[Winter solstice]]''' in the Northern Hemisphere and the Summer Solstice in the Southern Hemisphere.
* '''The Feast for Life''', celebrated at the birth of a Thelemite and on birthdays.
* '''The Feast for Fire/The Feast for Water'''. These feast days are usually taken as being when a child hits puberty and steps unto the path of adulthood. The Feast for Fire is celebrated for a male, and the Feast for Water for a female.
* '''The Feast for Death''', celebrated on the death of a Thelemite and on the anniversary of their death. Crowley's Death is celebrated on December 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chappel|first=V|title=Thelemic Calendar and Holidays|url=http://www.thelema101.com/calendar|work=Thelema 101|accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
Aleister Crowley was highly prolific and wrote on the subject of Thelema for over 35 years, and many of his books remain in print. During his time, there were several who wrote on the subject, including U.S. [[Ordo Templi Orientis|O.T.O.]] Grand Master [[Charles Stansfeld Jones]], whose works on Qabalah are still in print, and Major-General [[J. F. C. Fuller]].

[[John Whiteside Parsons|Jack Parsons]] was a scientist researching the use of various fuels for rockets at the [[California Institute of Technology]], and one of Crowley's first American students, for a time leading the Agape Lodge of the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] for Crowley in America.  He wrote several short works during his lifetime, some later collected as ''Freedom is a Two-edged Sword.'' He died in 1952 as a result of an explosion, and while not a prolific writer himself, has been the subject of two biographies; ''Sex and Rockets'' by John Carter, and ''Strange Angel'' by George Pendle.

Since Crowley's death in 1947, there have been other Thelemic writers such as [[Israel Regardie]], who edited many of Crowley's works and also wrote a biography of him, ''The Eye in the Triangle'', as well as books on [[Qabalah]].  [[Kenneth Grant]] wrote numerous books on Thelema and the occult, such as ''[[The Magical Revival|The Typhonian Trilogy]]''.  [[Lon Milo DuQuette]] has written several books which analyze Crowley's system.

Other notable contemporary writers who address Thelema include [[Allen H. Greenfield]], [[Christopher Hyatt]], [[Richard Kaczynski]], [[Marcelo Ramos Motta]], [[Rodney Orpheus]], [[Phyllis Seckler]], [[James Wasserman]], [[Sam Webster (writer)|Sam Webster]], and [[Robert Anton Wilson]]. There are also journals which print original Thelemic writing.

[[Michael Ende]]'s fantasy novel ''[[The Neverending Story]]'' features the [[AURYN]], inscribed with "DO WHAT YOU WISH".
When the boy Bastian becomes supreme ruler, he finds the consequences of his wishes and what his strongest wish really is.

===Organizations===
Several modern organizations of various sizes claim to follow the tenets of Thelema. The two most prominent are both organizations that Crowley headed during his lifetime: the [[A∴A∴]], an Order founded by Crowley, based on the grades of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]] system; and [[Ordo Templi Orientis]], an order which initially developed from the [[Ancient and Primitive Rite|Rite of Memphis and Mizraim]] in the early part of the 20th century, and which includes [[Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica]] as its religious arm.

Since Crowley's death in 1947, other organizations have formed to carry on his initial work, for example, the [[Typhonian Order]] of [[Kenneth Grant]] and [[The Open Source Order of the Golden Dawn]]. Other groups of widely varying character exist which have drawn inspiration or methods from Thelema, such as the [[Illuminates of Thanateros]] and the [[Temple of Set]].  Some groups accept the Law of Thelema, but omit certain aspects of Crowley's system while incorporating the works of other mystics, philosophers, and religious systems.  

The [[Fraternitas Saturni]] (Brotherhood of Saturn), founded in 1928 in Germany, accepts the Law of Thelema, but extends it with the phrase "Mitleidlose Liebe!" ("Compassionless love!"). The Thelema Society, also located in Germany, accepts [[The Book of the Law|Liber Legis]] and much of Crowley's work on [[Magick (Thelema)|magick]], while incorporating the ideas of other thinkers, such as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Niklas Luhmann]].

Thelemites can also be found in other organizations. The president of the [[Church of All Worlds]], [[LaSara FireFox]], identifies as a Thelemite. A significant minority of other CAW members also identify as Thelemites.&lt;ref name=EMWNP /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2959">'''''Qiu Chang Chun Xi You Ji''''' ('''''Travels to the West of Qiu Chang Chun''''', 長春真人西遊記) was a record of journey of the Taoist monk [[Qiu Chuji]] from Shandong, China through central Asia to present himself before [[Genghis Khan]].

In 1220, on the invitation of Genghis Khan with a golden tablet, Qiu Chuji left his home town in Shandong with nineteen disciples, and travelled through [[Beijing]] and travelled north. In June, they reached Dexing (德興; present-day Julu Hebei) and stayed in the Longyang Taoist Temple (龍陽觀) from summer to end of winter. On February 1221, they resumed their journey. When asked by friends and disciples when to expect the master to return, the master answered "In three years, three years". On February 3, they reached Cuiping Pass (翠帡口; west of [[Zhangjiakou]]), they saw the [[Taihang Mountains]] to their south. Travelling north then north east, they arrived at Gailipo [[salt lake]] (蓋里泊; now named Jiuliancheng Naoer 九連城淖爾; in the south of the [[Taibus Banner]]).  From there they went to [[Lake Buir]], [[Hulunbuir]], [[Ulan Bator]], [[Arkhangai Province|Arkhangai]], [[Altay Mountains]], [[Beshbalik]], [[Dzungaria]], [[Samarkand]] and arrived at [[Hindu Kush]] of [[Afghanistan]] in 1222 and presented himself before Genghis Khan. 

The journey to Persia and back took three years, from 1220 to 1224. The record was written by a disciple Li Zhichang (李志常), who accompanied Qiu on the journey. The ''Travels'' consisted of two parts, the first part described the details of the travel to the west and back; the second part contains advice from Qiu Chuji to Genghis Khan.

The ''Travels'' was published by another disciple Sun Xi (孫錫), with a preface dated 1228. The ''Travels'' was included in ''Dao Zang'' (道藏 Depository of Taoist works), but was forgotten for more than five hundred years until 1795 Qing dynasty scholars [[Qian Daxin]] and [[Duan Yucai]] rediscovered it from ''Dao Zang'' in the Xuanmiao Taoist Temple (玄妙觀) in [[Suzhou]]. Qian Daxin then hand copied this work and distributed it.

==Translations==
The ''Travels'' was first translated into Russian by the Archimandrite of Russian Orthodox Church Pekin Eccles Mission [[Palladius Kafarov]] in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;volume 4 of Record of the Pekin Eccles Mission&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1867 M. Pauthier translated an abridged version of the ''Travels'' from Hai Guo Tu Zhi&lt;ref&gt;Wei Yuan: Hai Guo Tu Zhi, 1844.&lt;/ref&gt;

1888,  Dr. [[Emil Bretschneider]], a [[Baltic German]] physician posted to the Russian Legation in Beijing, published his English translation of the ''Travels''.&lt;ref&gt;SI YOU KI, TRAVELS TO THE WEST OF KIU CH'ANG CH'UN, by Emil Bretschneider, in Medieval Researches from Eastern Asiatic Sources vol 1 1888 Trubner &amp; Co, London; Reprint by Elibron Classics {{ISBN|1-4021-9303-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tượng Phật Quan Âm''''' ([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[English language|English]]: ''Buddha Statue of [[Avalokitesvara]]'') is a cast [[concrete]] [[statue]] in Chùa Việt Nam ('''English''': Vietnamese Buddhist Center) in [[Sugar Land, Texas|Sugar Land]], [[Texas]], just outside of [[Houston]]. The sculpture depicts the [[bodhisattva]] Avalokitesvara in female form standing on a lotus pedestal. She may also be commonly known by her Chinese name [[Guanyin]]. It was created by sculptor Mai Chi Kim,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1004061690676938720 "Quan Am, Texas-style"]&lt;/ref&gt; who wanted to work on a bigger project after the temple had commissioned several smaller statues from her.

With the base included, the statue stands at 72 feet tall, making it one of the [[tallest statues in the United States]] and looks over a large pond beside an ornate red bridge. It is also suspected to be the largest Buddhist statue in the western hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/fort_bend/news/roof-of-buddhist-temple-collapses-in-sugar-land-area/article_2a86d7cd-71e0-5d73-800e-ff57fa84439f.html "Roof of Buddhist temple collapses in Sugar Land area"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Quan Am is one of the most highly revered bodhisattvas in [[Vietnam]] and is called by many epithets, including 'Mother of Buddhas' and 'Goddess of Compassion'.

The '''virgin birth of Jesus''' is the belief that [[Jesus]] was conceived in the womb of his mother [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] through the [[Holy Spirit]] without the [[miraculous births|agency of a human father]] and born while Mary was still a [[Virginity|virgin]].&lt;ref name=Dorman1995p990&gt;{{Citation |last=Dorman |first=T.M. |chapter=Virgin Birth |editor-last=Bromiley |editor-first=Geoffrey W. |title=International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Q-Z |publisher=Eerdmans |year=1995 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6OJvO2jMCr8C&amp;pg=PA990#v=onepage&amp;q=definition%20virgin%20birth&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0802837844 |page=990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Testament references are Matthew 1:18-25 and Luke 1:26-38; it is not expressly mentioned elsewhere in the Christian scriptures,&lt;ref name=Barth2004p175&gt;{{Citation |last1=Barth |first1=Karl |title=Church Dogmatics: The doctrine of the word of God |publisher=A&amp;C Black |year=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Po0rhLSFx0wC&amp;pg=PA175#v=onepage&amp;q=virgin%20birth%20%22not%20expressly%20mentioned%22&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0567050694 |page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "the modern scholarly consensus is that the doctrine of the virgin birth rests on a very slim historical foundation."&lt;ref name=Bruner2004p37/&gt;

The virgin birth was universally accepted in the Christian church and, except for some minor sects, was not seriously challenged until the 18th century. It is enshrined in the [[creed]]s that most Christians consider normative, such as the [[Nicene Creed]] ("incarnate of the Virgin Mary") and the [[Apostles' Creed]] ("born of the Virgin Mary"), and is a basic article of belief in the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], and most [[protestantism|Protestant]] churches.

Muslims also believe in the virgin birth of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Britannica2007VirginBirth&gt;{{cite web |last=Britannica |title=Virgin Birth |date=2007 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/629896/Virgin-Birth |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of Jesus' miraculous conception by the Holy Spirit is found only in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and the [[Gospel of Luke]].&lt;ref name=Hurtado2010p318/&gt;

===Matthew===
{{Main|Matthew 1}}
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;18 Now the birth of Jesus the Messiah took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been engaged to Joseph, but before they lived together, she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. 19 Her husband Joseph, being a righteous man and unwilling to expose her to public disgrace, planned to dismiss her quietly. 20 But just when he had resolved to do this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. 21 She will bear a son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins." 22 All this took place to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet:

23 "Look, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son,
    and they shall name him Emmanuel,"

which means, "God is with us." 24 When Joseph awoke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him; he took her as his wife, 25 but had no marital relations with her until she had borne a son; and he named him Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|1:18-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

===Luke===
{{Main|Luke 1}}
{{quote|26 In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, 27 to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin's name was Mary. 28 And he came to her and said, "Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you." 29 But she was much perplexed by his words and pondered what sort of greeting this might be. 30 The angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. 31 And now, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you will name him Jesus. 32 He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his ancestor David. 33 He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end." 34 Mary said to the angel, "How can this be, since I am a virgin?" 35 The angel said to her, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be holy; he will be called Son of God. 36 And now, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month for her who was said to be barren. 37 For nothing will be impossible with God." 38 Then Mary said, "Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word." Then the angel departed from her.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Luke|1:26-38}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Isaiah 7:14 ===
{{main|Isaiah 7:14|Immanuel}}
Matthew&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|1:23|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; quotes a prophecy from the [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] as the basis for the virgin birth. In this vignette the prophet Isaiah informs King [[Ahaz]] that his enemies will be destroyed before a child born to a young woman in his retinue is old enough "to refuse evil and know good;" this child, he says, will be named Immanuel, "God is with us," because God is with Israel:

{{quote|1=&lt;poem&gt;10 Moreover the {{LORD}} spake again unto Ahaz, saying,
11 Ask thee a sign of the {{LORD}} thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.
12 But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the {{LORD}}.
13 And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; ''Is it'' a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?
14 Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.
15 Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.
16 For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Isaiah|7:10–16|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Scholars agree that the Hebrew word used in Isaiah, "[[almah]]", signifies a girl of childbearing age without reference to virginity,&lt;ref name=Sweeney1996p161&gt;{{Citation |last=Sweeney |first=Marvin A |title=Isaiah 1–39: with an introduction to prophetic literature |publisher=Eerdmans |year=1996 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BdSzj9-SZv0C&amp;pg=PA161#v=onepage&amp;q=%22scholars%20agree%22%22nothing%20to%20do%20with%20whether%20she%20is%20a%20virgin%22&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0802841001 |page=161 |accessdate=2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Isaiah is in any case talking about his own immediate circumstances in the year 735 BC, not the distant future.&lt;ref name=France2007p56/&gt; In Isaiah the Immanuel prophecy has an immediate aim, but Matthew uses it to find patterns of God's dealings with Israel rather than a single and specific fulfillment.&lt;ref name=France2007p56&gt;{{Citation |last=France |first=R.T |title=The Gospel of Matthew |publisher=Eerdmans |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ruP6J_XPCEC&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |year=2007 |isbn=978-0802825018 |pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology==
In the [[Genealogy of Jesus|genealogy]] preceding his birth story the author of Matthew calls [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] "the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2c-nb|Mt.|1:16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the original [[Greek language|Greek]], the phrase "of whom", ἐξ ἧς, is feminine singular, clearly showing that it refers to Mary, and that Joseph was not the biological father of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Turner2008p3&gt;{{Citation |last=Turner |first=David L. |title=Matthew |publisher=Baker |year=2008 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8z9LSdKLUl4C |isbn=978-0-8010-2684-3 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{request quotation|date=August 2018}} As the story progresses the Book of Matthew underlines the virginity of Mary through references to the [[Book of Isaiah]] (using the Greek translation rather than the Hebrew original) and by his narrative statement that Joseph had no sexual relations with her until after the birth (a choice of words which leaves open the possibility that they did have relations after that).&lt;ref name=Morris1992p31&gt;{{Citation |last=Morris |first=Leon |title=The Gospel According to Matthew |publisher=Eerdmans |year=1992 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-pwaSKcHyEEC&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q=%22standpoint%20of%20Joseph%22&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0851113388 |pages=31–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Book of Luke differs from Matthew in depicting a virginal conception rather than a virgin birth (there is nothing in Luke that suggests Joseph did not have sexual relations with Mary after the angelic visit).&lt;ref name=Simmons1990p948&gt;{{Citation |last1=Simmons |first1=Paul D. |chapter=Virgin Birth |editor1-last=Mills |editor1-first=Watson E. |editor2-last=Bullard |editor2-first=Roger Aubrey |title=Mercer Dictionary of the Bible |publisher=Mercer University Press |year=1990 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=goq0VWw9rGIC&amp;pg=PA948#v=onepage&amp;q=%22a%20virginal%20conception%22%22or%20a%20virginal%20birth%22%22&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0865543737 |page=948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luke's virgin birth story is a standard plot from the Jewish scriptures, as for example in the annunciation scenes for [[Isaac]] and for [[Samson]], in which an angel appears and causes apprehension, the angel gives reassurance and announces the coming birth, the mother raises an objection, and the angel gives a sign.&lt;ref name=Kodell1992p939&gt;{{Citation |last1=Kodell |first1=Jerome |chapter=Luke |editor-last=Karris |editor-first=Robert J. |title=The Collegeville Bible Commentary: New Testament, NAB |publisher=Liturgical Press |year=1992 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fJR0wYP12ZEC&amp;pg=PA939#v=onepage&amp;q=%22infancy%20stories%20were%20added%22%22to%20serve%20as%20a%20prologue%22&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0814622117 |pages=939–940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote that human beings incur [[original sin]] through being begotten by the active power in a man's semen.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UBUlxXoQuP4C&amp;pg=PA225#v=onepage&amp;q=mary%20original%20sin%20thomas%20aquinas%20semen&amp;f=false |title=On Evil |author=Thomas Aquinas |editor=Brian Davies |others=translated by Richard Regan |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-0199882748 |page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, he felt, it was proper that Christ assumed flesh from a woman, as "the power of a man's semen ought not to have accomplished the formation of Christ's body."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aquinas|first1=Thomas|title=Compendium of Theology By Thomas Aquinas |others=translated by Richard J Regan|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.|isbn=978-0-19-538530-4|pages=175–178|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8FfgtnsvTRAC&amp;pg=PA177#v=onepage&amp;q=%22formation%20of%20Christ's%20body%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of Jesus outside the birth narratives==
The [[Apostle Paul]], writing several decades before Matthew and Luke, shows no awareness of any virgin birth tradition.&lt;ref name=Meier1991p226/&gt; He makes three explicit references to Jesus' birth, and assumes Jesus' full humanity and says nothing of the circumstances of the birth.&lt;ref name=Lincoln2013p21/&gt; The three are Galatians 4:4, which speaks of Jesus as "born of a woman, born under the law"; Romans 1:1-4, which says that Jesus was "of the seed of David according to the flesh"; and Philippians 2:6-7, in which Jesus is described as "born in the likeness of men".&lt;ref name=Lincoln2013p21&gt;{{Citation |last=Lincoln |first=Andrew |title=Born of a Virgin? |publisher=Eerdmans |year=2013 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=deNgAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q=%22all%20three%20passages%20simply%20assume%20Jesus%27%20full%20humanity%20in%20his%20birth%22&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0802869258 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Paul's expression "born of a woman, born under the law" has been interpreted as implying that Jesus had no human father.&lt;ref name=Meier1991p226&gt;{{Citation |last1=Meier |first1=John P. |title=A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus |volume=I |publisher=Anchor Bible |year=1991 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zODYAAAAMAAJ |isbn=978-0385264259 |page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening of the [[Epistle to the Romans]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Romans|1:1-4|esv}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes the words: "who was descended from David according to the flesh and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord". Some, pointing out that the Greek word translated as "descendant" in some Bibles is ''sperma'', which literally means "seed", and interpreting this as indicating descent through the male line,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/paul_carlson/nt_contradictions.html Carlson, Paul (1995) "New Testament Contradictions"]&lt;/ref&gt; take "descended from David according to the flesh" to mean that Joseph, a descendant of David, was the physical father of Jesus, thus denying the virgin birth of Jesus, others take it as indicating that Mary was also a descendant of David.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Stevens |first=George Barker |title=The Theology of the New Testament |publisher=T&amp;T Clark |year=1899 |page=391}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Brunner |first=Emil |last2=Wyon |first2=Olive |title=The Mediator: A Study of the Central Doctrine of the Christian Faith |publisher=Lutterworth Press |year=2003 |page=361 |isbn=0-7188-9049-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Sullivan |first=Clayton |title=Rescuing Jesus from the Christians |publisher=Trinity Press International |year=2002 |page=40 |isbn=9781563383809}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others point out that here, as in Galatians 4:4, Paul does not use the ordinary word for "born" (γεννητός, ''gennetos'', the word used in Matthew 11:11 in relation to John the Baptist being "born of a woman"), but the word γενόμενος, ''genomenos'', literally meaning "become", "come to be",&lt;ref&gt;Lockyer, Herbert, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=BywUZArOxMkC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;q=%22Galatians%204%3A4%22%20genomenos#v=onepage&amp;f=false All the Doctrines of the Bible]'' (Zondervan 1964 {{ISBN|0-310-28051-6}}), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, Donald, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=0srYAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=genomenosNew Testament Theology]'' (Intervarsity Press 1981 {{ISBN|0-85111-742-2}}), p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt; a fact that some interpret as an allusion to incarnation of the [[Pre-existence of Christ|pre-existent Son of God]].&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Tim S.; Abraham, William J.

In Timothy 1:4, the author urges people not to "occupy themselves with myths and endless genealogies which promote speculations".  Some scholars see this passage as reflecting a negative view of the developing virgin birth stories and their variant genealogies.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, J. Edward (1988).

[[File:Maryam.jpg|thumb|According to the Quran, the pains of labor took Mary to the trunk of a palm tree. The voice of Gabriel or Jesus consoled her and told her that God miraculously provides water to drink and dates to eat.]]
{{See also|Jesus in Islam}}

The Islamic faith echoed some strands within Christian tradition that Mary (or Maryam) was a literal virgin when Jesus was conceived. The most detailed account of the annunciation and birth of Jesus is provided in [[Surah]] 3 ([[Al Imran]]) and 19 ([[Maryam (sura)|Maryam]]) of the [[Quran]] where the story is narrated that God (Allah) sent an angel to announce that Maryam could shortly expect to bear a son, despite being a virgin.&lt;ref name=Sarker &gt;Sarker, Abraham,''Understand My Muslim People'', 2004, {{ISBN|1-59498-002-0}}, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some academics have noted that the account in [[Surah]] 19&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc|19|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; is particularly close to that in the Christian [[Gospel of Luke]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Montell, ''Islam Revealed'', 2003, {{ISBN|1-59160-869-4}}, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The Annunciation to Mary is mentioned twice in the Quran and in both instances Mary/ Maryam is told that she was chosen by God to deliver a son. In the first instance, the bearer of the news (who is believed by most Muslims to be the archangel Gabriel), delivered the news in (3:42-47) as he takes the form of a man (19:16-22).&lt;ref name="Peters23"&gt;Peters, F.

The modern scholarly consensus is that the doctrine of the virgin birth rests on a very slim historical foundation.&lt;ref name=Bruner2004p37&gt;{{Citation |last=Bruner |first=Frederick |title=Matthew: The Christbook, Matthew 1-12 |publisher=Eerdmans |year=2004 |orig-year=1st ed. 1987 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5jZlfg1yxIEC&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q=%22consensus%22%22doctrine%20of%20the%20virgin%20birth%20rests%20on%20a%20very%20slim%20historical%20foundation%22&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0802811189 |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Matthew, an angel appears to Joseph in a dream, to inform Joseph of the virginal conception; while in Luke the angel [[Gabriel]] informs Mary before the conception occurs. There are at least two rival explanations for the "double attestation" of Matthew and Luke regarding the virgin birth of Jesus:&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Laverdiere (2006) ''The Annunciation to Mary'', Liturgy Training Press, {{ISBN|978-1-56854-557-8}}, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Machen, Gresham (1987) ''Virgin Birth of Christ'', Ingram Press, {{ISBN|978-0-227-67630-1}}, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The virgin birth was a historical event, and the narratives of Matthew and Luke are based on different aspects of the event according to witnesses' reports of it.&lt;ref&gt;Gromacki, Robert, 2002, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=uvCaxyI_7foC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22exactly%20what%20happened%22&amp;f=false The Virgin Birth]'' Kregel, {{ISBN|978-0-8254-2746-6}}, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Matthew and Luke both wanted to present Jesus as fulfilling prophecies from Hebrew scripture. Both were aware of prophecies concerning a virgin birth and Bethlehem, and therefore these elements of their stories match. But each author wove these prophecies into an overall narrative in a different way. For example, both authors had to explain how Jesus was born in Bethlehem when he was known to be from Nazareth (as mentioned in all four gospels)—and each came up with an independent explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Marchadour, A., Neuhaus, D. and Martini, CC., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=OxW-s_X8XssC&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q=Matthew%20luke%20bethlehem%20nazareth&amp;f=false The Land, the Bible, and History: Toward the Land That I Will Show You]'', Fordham University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0823226610}}, pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the fact that the virgin birth is mentioned only by Matthew and Luke is considered to produce doubt as to its truth by scholars such as [[Jürgen Moltmann]]. He writes: "In the New Testament, Christ's 'virgin birth' is related only by Luke and Matthew. It was unknown, or considered unimportant, in wide areas of early Christian belief (the Pauline and Johannine sectors, for example). But from the third century onwards it became a firm component of the Christian creeds and theological christologies." He also writes: "The virgin birth is not one of the pillars that sustains the New Testament faith in Christ. The confession of faith in Jesus, the Son of God, the Lord, is independent of the virgin birth, and is not based on it." "Moreover, we find the confession of faith in Christ in Christian traditions which know nothing of the virgin birth, or do not mention it." He concludes: "that the virgin birth does not provide the justification for confessing Christ."&lt;ref&gt;Moltmann, J., ''The Way of Jesus Christ'', SCM Press, London, 1990, pp. 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John L. McKenzie]] notes that, if these two narratives were missing from the New Testament, "there would be no biblical mention of the virgin birth". He adds, "the event is unusual enough for one to wonder why an author who knew of it would not mention it."&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, J.L., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=P-dLAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage&amp;q=%20virgin%20birth&amp;f=false The New Testament Without Illusion]'', Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1606082720}}, pp. 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bart D. Ehrman]] writes, "The tradition that Jesus' mother was a virgin is given by both Matthew and Luke, and to that extent, it's independently attested. But it has always struck scholars as odd that the tradition—which surely would be an important thing to know!—isn't attested anywhere else in our earliest sources, even among writers who would have had a real interest in publicizing the fact that God himself was actually Jesus' father."&lt;ref&gt;Ehrman, B. D., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=c9K_6NN3llcC&amp;pg=PA96#v=onepage&amp;q=virgin%20birth%20doubt&amp;f=false Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium]'', Oxford University Press, 1999, {{ISBN|978-0199839438}}, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Oxford Companion to the Bible'', on the fact that nowhere else in the Bible is the virgin birth attested, has: &lt;blockquote&gt;Such an argument from silence cannot be determinative, but it is an important consideration for people who see the virgin birth as a feature created within the early traditions about Jesus rather than a historical occurrence. Those who doubt the historicity of the virgin birth argue that it was created by the early church as a way of honoring the coming of Jesus as the Son of God or of explaining the idea of God becoming flesh. Miraculous human birth stories are common in biblical tradition, going back to Abraham and Sarah (Gen. 17.15—19, 18.9—15, I. 1—7), and numerous references to deities impregnating women are found within the Greco-Roman tradition. The mother of Heracles, for instance, was said to have been impregnated by Zeus (Diodorus Siculus, 4-9, 1—10).&lt;ref&gt;Metzger, B. M. and Coogan, D., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y2KGVuym5OUC&amp;pg=PA790#v=onepage&amp;q=virgin%20birth%20doubt&amp;f=false The Oxford Companion to the Bible]'', Oxford University Press, 1993, {{ISBN|978-0199743919}}, p. 790.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among other hypotheses that have been proposed as explanations of the origin of the accounts in Matthew and Luke of the birth of Jesus from a virgin is that of professor of humanities and religious studies [[Stephen L. Harris]], who proposed that these were written to answer Jewish slanders about Jesus' illegitimate birth,&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;Harris, Stephen L., [https://books.google.com/books?id=13MbAQAAMAAJ Understanding the Bible], McGraw-Hill, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0767429160}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of which there is evidence from the 2nd century, but which may have been a subsequent polemical Jewish response to the account in Matthew and Luke.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Raymond E., The Birth of the Messiah. Doubleday &amp; Company. 1977, Appendix V: The Charge of Illegitimacy, {{ISBN|978-0385059077}}, p. 537&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helmut Köster]] views the narratives of Jesus' virgin birth as having roots in [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Köster, Helmut ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=r6MNAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22hellenistic+mythology%22 Ancient Christian gospels: their history and development]'', SCM Press, 1990, {{ISBN|978-0334024590}}, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denial of the virgin birth===
{{See also|Denial of the virgin birth of Jesus}}
Throughout Christian history a small number of groups have denied the virgin birth.&lt;ref&gt;McGuckin, John Anthony, ''The Westminster handbook to patristic theology'', 2004, {{ISBN|0-664-22396-6}}, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; This view existed among some early Jewish Christian groups such as some of the [[Ebionites]] who considered Jesus the Messiah, but rejected the apostle Paul as an apostate.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Carleton Paget|Paget, James Carleton]], ''Jews, Christians and Jewish Christians in Antiquity'', 2010, {{ISBN|3-16-150312-0}}, p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 4th century the [[Nicene Creed]] rejected the teaching that Jesus was a mere human.&lt;ref&gt;Marthaler, Berard L., ''The creed: the apostolic faith in contemporary theology'', 2007, {{ISBN|0-89622-537-2}}, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Origen.jpg|thumb|left|Early modern woodcut showing fictionalized portrayal of [[Origen]]]]
In the 2nd century, [[Celsus]], a pagan anti-Christian Greek philosopher, wrote that Jesus's father was a Roman soldier named [[Tiberius Julius Abdes Pantera|Pantera]]. The views of Celsus drew responses from [[Origen]], who considered it a fabricated story.&lt;ref&gt;Origen; Henry Chadwick, ''Contra Celsum'', 1980, {{ISBN|0-521-29576-9}}, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick, John, ''The Apology of Origen in Reply to Celsus'', 2009, {{ISBN|1-110-13388-X}}, pp. 22–24.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raymond E. Brown]] states that the story of Pantera is a fanciful explanation of the birth of Jesus which includes very little historical evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Edward Brown]], et al.''Mary in the New Testament'', 1978, {{ISBN|0-8091-2168-9}}, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Middle Ages]], as part of the conflicts with Christians, a satirical parody of the Christian gospels called the [[Toledot Yeshu]] was written. The book referred to Pantera, or Pandera, as the father of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J.

Historically notable figures to deny the virgin birth included the translator of the first Bible in Belarusian, [[Symon Budny]] (who was excommunicated by the Polish Unitarians&lt;ref&gt;''The Jews in old Poland, 1000-1795'' ed. Antony Polonsky, Jakub Basista, Andrzej Link-Lenczowski - 1993 p32 "Budny rejected the eternality of Christ and, in the notes to his translation of the New Testament, denied the Virgin birth, assenting that Jesus was Joseph's son. Even among heretical leaders Szymon Budny was considered a heretic and they would have nothing to do with him&lt;/ref&gt;), and [[Joseph Priestley]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;''Cyclopædia of Biblical, theological, and ecclesiastical literature'', Volume 2 By John McClintock, James Strong 1894 p404&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, J.

{{see also|Annunciation|Marian devotions|Hymns to Mary}}
[[File:Ellenrieder Maria 1833.jpg|thumb|left|Mary writing the [[Magnificat]], by [[Marie Ellenrieder]], 1833]]
Christians celebrate the conception of Jesus on 25 March&lt;ref&gt;The [[Julian Calendar]] 25 March corresponds at present to 8 April in the [[Gregorian Calendar]].&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Lady Day]]) and his birth at [[Christmas]] (25 December) or [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] (6 January). Among the many traditions associated with Christmas are the construction of cribs and the performance of re-enactments of elements of the story in the Gospels of the birth of Jesus, a tradition started in the 13th century by the [[Franciscans]].&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, Rosalind B., ''The image of St Francis'', 2006, {{ISBN|0-521-78291-0}}, pp. 183–184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, George Finger, ''The vitality of the Christian tradition'', 1944, {{ISBN|0-8369-2378-2}}, pp. 110–112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The tradition of Catholic prayer'', by Christian Raab, Harry Hagan, St. Meinrad Archabbey, 2007, {{ISBN|0-8146-3184-3}}, pp. 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival of the Nativity which later turned into Christmas was a 4th-century feast in the [[Western Church]], notably in Rome and North Africa, although it is uncertain exactly where and when it was first celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;Vischer, Lukas, ''Christian worship in Reformed Churches past and present'', 2002, {{ISBN|0-8028-0520-5}}, pp. 400–401.&lt;/ref&gt; There has been debate about the reason why Christians came to choose the 25 December date to celebrate the birth of Jesus. One theory is that they did so in order to oppose the existing winter-solstice feast of the ''Natalis Solis Invicti'' (Birthday of the Unconquered Sun) by celebrating on that date the birth of the "Sun of Righteousness".&lt;ref name="ODCC:Christmas"&gt;Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-19-280290-3}}), article ''Christmas''&lt;/ref&gt;

Another tradition derived the date of Christmas from that of the [[Annunciation]], the virginal conception of Jesus.&lt;ref name="ODCC:Christmas"/&gt; Since this was supposed to have taken place on 14 Nisan in the Jewish calendar, calculated to have been either 25 March or 6 April, it was believed that the date of Christ's birth will have been nine months later.&lt;ref&gt;Procter and Frere's ''New History of the Book of Common Prayer'' (see [http://www.oremus.org/liturgy/etc/ktf/intro.html#xmas The Date of Christmas and Epiphany])&lt;/ref&gt; A tractate falsely attributed to [[John Chrysostom]] argued that Jesus was conceived and crucified on the same day of the year and calculated this as 25 March, a computation also mentioned by Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]].&lt;ref name="ODCC:Christmas"/&gt;

The [[Magnificat]], based on Luke 1:46-55 is one of four well known Gospel [[canticle]]s: the ''[[Benedictus (Song of Zechariah)|Benedictus]]'' and the'' [[Magnificat]]'' in the first chapter, and the ''[[Gloria in Excelsis]]'' and the ''[[Nunc dimittis]]'' in the second chapter of Luke, which are now an integral part of the Christian [[Liturgy|liturgical]] tradition.&lt;ref name=Kugler394 &gt;Robert Kugler, Patrick Hartin ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=L8WbXbPjxpoC&amp;pg=PA394#v=snippet&amp;q=Magnificat&amp;f=false An Introduction to the Bible]'', [[William B.

The [[Eastern Orthodox]] Church uses the title "Ever Virgin Mary" as a key element of its Marian veneration, and as part of the [[Akathist]]s (hymns) to Mary which are an integral part of its [[liturgy]].&lt;ref&gt;Peltomaa, Leena Mari, ''The image of the Virgin Mary in the Akathistos hymn'', 2001, {{ISBN|90-04-12088-2}}, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Annunciation in Christian art}}
This doctrine of the Virgin Birth is often represented [[Christian art]] in terms of the [[annunciation]] to Mary by the [[Archangel Gabriel]] that she would conceive a child to be born the [[Son of God]], and in [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] scenes that include the figure of [[Salome (disciple)|Salome]]. The Annunciation is one of the most frequently depicted scenes in Western art.&lt;ref&gt;Guiley, Rosemary, ''The encyclopedia of angels'', 2004, {{ISBN|0-8160-5023-6}}, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Annunciation scenes also amount to the most frequent appearances of Gabriel in medieval art.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Leslie, ''Medieval art: a topical dictionary'', 1996, {{ISBN|0-313-29329-5}}, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; The depiction of Joseph turning away in some [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity scenes]] is a discreet reference to the fatherhood of the [[Holy Spirit]], and the doctrine of Virgin Birth.&lt;ref&gt;Grabar, André, ''Christian iconography: a study of its origins'', 1968, Taylor &amp; Francis, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Vox (2014 european elections in Spain).svg|thumb|300px|right|Results of Vox (2014 European elections in Spain)]]
Vox was founded on 17 December 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.voxespana.es/index.php/aviso-legal "VOX es un partido político con personalidad jurídica propia e inscrito en el Registro de partidos políticos del Ministerio del Interior el día 17 Diciembre de 2013"] - ''VOX''&lt;/ref&gt; and publicly launched at a press conference in [[Madrid]] on 16 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libertaddigital.com/espana/politica/2014-01-14/nace-el-partido-politico-de-abascal-y-ortega-lara-1276508230/|title=Nace Vox, el partido político de Santiago Abascal y Ortega Lara|publisher=Libertad Digital|date=14 January 2014|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/16/us-spain-politics-idUSBREA0F1HM20140116|title=Spanish ruling party rebels launch new conservative party|last=O'Leary|first=Elisabeth|date=|work=U.S.|accessdate=2018-04-18|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for this schism seem to be the way the incumbent PP government dealt with the issue of the violence of separatist group [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]], the fiscal policy of the PP and the desire for a more [[centralized government]] in contrast to the current, quasi-federal political system ("[[Autonomous communities of Spain|State of Autonomies]]") instituted in 1978. Vox opposes [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] and [[Catalonia|Catalan]] separatism in general.&lt;ref name="Reuters1" /&gt; VOX have labelled themselves as a right-wing and [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] party. The first provisional chairman was the philosopher [[:es:José_Luis_González_Quirós|José Luis González Quirós]] (provisional until the party's internal election in late 2014). Other members are [[Santiago Abascal]] and [[José Antonio Ortega Lara]] (well known for having been kidnapped by ETA for more than a year).

Vox ran for the first time in the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Spain)|2014 European elections]] but narrowly failed to win a seat in the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertaddigital.com/espana/2014-05-26/tristeza-y-decepcion-en-vox-tras-los-resultados-de-las-elecciones-europeas-1276519600/ Tristeza y decepción en Vox tras los resultados de las Elecciones Europeas] in libertaddigital.com {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014 the party elected Santiago Abascal, one of the founders, as new President, and Iván Espinosa de los Monteros, also a founder, as General Secretary. Eleven members of the National Executive Committee were also elected.

As of 2017 Vox remains a marginal political actor in Spain.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.eldiario.es/politica/Vox-derecha-extrema-prospera-juzgados_0_718828397.html|title=Vox: la ultraderecha irrelevante en las urnas agita los juzgados|work=eldiario.es|accessdate=2018-04-18|language=es}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/world/europe/spain-catalonia-carles-puigdemont-extradition.html|title=Arrest of Catalan Leader Tests Spain, Separatists and E.U.|date=2018-03-27|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2018-04-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 2017 the number of members increased 20% in forty days as a consequence of the terrorist attack in Barcelona and the Catalan independence process.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.publico.es/politica/afiliacion-partido-ultraderechista-vox-aumenta-20-40-dias.html|title=La afiliación al partido ultraderechista VOX aumenta un 20% en 40 días|accessdate=2018-04-18|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Catalan independence referendum, 2017|Catalan referendum]] of 2017 and the start of a [[Spanish constitutional crisis]], Vox opted to not participate in the [[Catalan regional election, 2017|Catalan regional elections of 2017]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elplural.com/politica/2017/11/03/vox-el-21d-es-fruto-de-un-pacto-oculto-entre-rajoy-y-los-golpistas|title=VOX: "El 21D es fruto de un pacto oculto entre Rajoy y los golpistas"|last=Paradinas|first=Marcos|date=3 November 2017|work=[[elplural.com]]|access-date=18 April 2018|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Catalan declaration of independence]], the party sued the [[Parliament of Catalonia]] and several independentist politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/ccaa/2017/10/11/catalunya/1507707978_302026.html|publisher=El País|date=11 October 2017|accessdate=30 August 2018|language=es|title=El TSJ catalán admite la querella de Vox por rebelión contra Puigdemont}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideology ==
Vox takes a [[pro-life]] stance on abortion and opposes same-sex marriage because they consider the Spanish word for marriage, "matrimonio", to be etymologically inadequate for same sex couples. Vox seeks to create a new type of union, called a "civil union", to replace same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=qCro2WYc4Zc|title=Alejo Vidal Cuadras, fundador de VOX habla sobre el matrimonio homosexual.|last=|first=|date=|website=www.google.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with a focus in economically liberal stances and [[centralism|recentralization]] proposals, the focus of their message shifted towards stances compatible with European [[right-wing populism]],&lt;ref name="casals"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Casals|first=Xavier|author-link=Xavier Casals|date=21 April 2015|title=Vox y su campaña contra la inmigración masiva|url=http://www.elmanifiesto.com/articulos.asp?idarticulo=5047|journal=ElManifiesto.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; endorsing anti-Islam and anti mass-immigration discourses as well as [[criticism of multiculturalism]].&lt;ref name="casals" /&gt; Their view of [[European Union]] is that of a [[Euroscepticism|soft euroscepticism]], arguing that Spain should make no [[sovereignty]] concessions to the EU, because they consider Spanish sovereignty to reside in the Spanish [[nation]] alone.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.libertaddigital.com/opinion/santiago-abascal/cadiz-covadonga-y-bruselas-77185/|title=Cádiz, Covadonga y Bruselas|last=Abascal|first=Santiago|date=2015-11-08|work=Libertad Digital|accessdate=2018-07-21|language=es-ES|quote=Porque estamos convencidos de que nación y soberanía son conceptos íntimamente relacionados.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20885">'''Wat Ong Teu Mahawihan''' ('''Temple of the Heavy Buddha''') is one of many Buddhist monasteries in the city of Vientiane in Laos. This name is given to the temple due to the large, bronze ''Phra Ong Teu'' Buddha image that is in the temple: the largest Buddha in Vientiane.&lt;ref name="brecht"&gt;Brecht, L. (2010).

Laos: Politics, Economics and Society. Boulder: Lynne Rienner Publishers, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it may have gone through many reconstructions during the 19th or 20th century to attain the appearance it has today.

Though this temple is created in Vientiane, it has the basic shape for what is known as the ‘Luang Prabang I style’ with its scarce use of brickwork and rectangular-like body.&lt;ref name="brecht"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ministry"/&gt;

Wat Ong Teu is said to have been placed along a cardinal point in accordance with three other temples but that may just be coincidental.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==History==
After commanding for the relocation of the capital of Laos from the city of Luang Prabang to Vientiane, King Setthathirat I produced many monasteries such as [[Wat That Luang]] and [[Wat Phra Kaew]].&lt;ref name="stuart"/&gt; The reason this ''wat'' (Lao for temple) was built was because Setthathirat I desired to create the ''Phra Ong Teu'' image that would be placed in it and to have it as his living quarters.&lt;ref name="man"&gt;Mansfield, S., &amp; Koh, M. (1998). Cultures of the World: Laos. Tarrytown: Marshall Cavendish Benchmark.&lt;/ref&gt; There would be six other sculptures of this image in other monasteries, but Wat Ong Teu Mahawihan contains the first.&lt;ref name="ministry"/&gt; Since this period is known as the golden age, the wat would evolve into a complex with a ''sim'' (ordination hall),  a ''ho rackhang'' (bell tower), a ''ho kong'' (drum tower), a that (stupa), and a ''kuti'' (monks’ living quarters).&lt;ref name="ministry"/&gt; Each of these parts of the complex all share the artistic motif of the architecture of the central ''wat'', which is discussed later.

The original use of this ''wat'' was for ceremonies of allegiance to the king.&lt;ref name="man"/&gt; However, in the 17th century, Souligna Vongsa as king transformed the temple into a Buddhist learning center to ‘teach, enlighten and inspire worshippers.’&lt;ref name="craft"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stuart"/&gt; It became a school for monks coming from around Southeast Asia to study the ''dhamma''.&lt;ref name="ring"&gt;Ringis, R. (1990). Thai Temples and Temple Murals. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This becomes apparent because surrounding countries of Laos sent their monks to Vientiane to study this religion. Such a function is more understandable of Wat Ong Teu since there are many details that give the suggestion of a learning center.

=== Reconstruction ===
When Siam sacked Laos in 1827-28, as a punishment, almost all of the monasteries in Laos, including Wat Ong Teu, were destroyed.&lt;ref name="brecht"/&gt; This was only made worse afterwards when the Ho bandits tried sack Vientiane again to take gold from Wat Ong Teu and others.

In 1900, following the establishment of the Franco-Siamese treaty in 1843, the French chose Vientiane as their capital and started the reconstruction of its monasteries including Wat Ong Teu.&lt;ref name="stuart"/&gt; As an addition, the French may have created a school, in the same format and appearance as the rest of the complex to further exemplify the function of Wat Ong Teu as a place of study. The Lao Buddhist Institute was made in 1929 and still functions today as a school for the Theravada Buddhist religion.&lt;ref name="brecht"/&gt;

== Architecture ==
In retrospect, the influence on the style of the original temple can be traced predominantly to India, though not directly. Indochina was part of the sphere of influence of India, known by George Coedès as the ‘Indianization of Southeast Asia.’&lt;ref name="ring"/&gt; The religion and customs of Indian civilization came ‘thoroughly yet peacefully’ to the people of this region, especially due to marriages between Indian men and local women.&lt;ref name="bussagli"&gt;Bussagli, M. (1973). Oriental Architecture. New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fisher"&gt;Fisher, R. E. (1993). Buddhist Art and Architecture. New York: Thames and Hudson Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Laos, however, was a not a country during this time. The kingdom of Lan Xang (‘Land of a million elephants’) wasn’t established until the mid-13th century of the common era just years after all direct contact with India was completely diminished.&lt;ref name="stuart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ring"/&gt; Instead, the original Wat Ong Teu took its traits from other mixed ideas of architecture from surrounding countries that were established earlier than the 13th century. In essence, the variant notions of these Southeastern Asian countries on the Theravada Buddhist architecture of India, such as Cambodia and Siam (present day Thailand), influenced the ideas of how Wat Ong Teu would be depicted.

Even though Laos borrowed traditions from these other cultures, the 16th century turned a new leaf for the Lao people in the form of a golden age. Thus, Wat Ong Teu has most of its own Lao Buddhist features and only minor details of surrounding influences.

After the temple’s destruction, some of the techniques used to create it were lost but much of it wasn’t forgotten. Instead, modern techniques were blended in with the old during the temple’s reconstruction, especially in what was used to fortify the walls and roof.&lt;ref name="craft"/&gt; The result became a rich new style that is exclusive to Lao architecture. This primarily is because the modern reconstruction completed by the French kept sincere adherence to these Lao notions already established on temple aesthetics, with some artistic liberties since Laos at this time was a protectorate of France.&lt;ref name="stuart"/&gt;

== Exterior of the ordination hall ==

===Entry gate===
A multi-tiered archway serves as the entrance into the complex. It is miniature compared to that of [[Pha That Luang]]. The functionality of this seemingly simple archway is similar to that of the ''torana'', or gateway, of Indian culture. The torana served as the passageway from secular ground to sacred ground. The difference is that this archway does not have any images for which a person can meditate and it doesn’t involve circumambulating a stupa.&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;Lee, S. E. (1994). A History of Far Eastern Art. Upper Saddle River: Prentice-Hall, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; This characteristic may be present in all the temples and stupas that in Laos, especially at King Setthathirat’s more famous architectural creation, [[Pha That Luang]].

===Main entrance===
The entrance to Wat Ong Teu is known to have many eccentricities that are indigenous only to Laos and no other Buddhist temple in Asia. Just before going up the stairs at the front of the temple, one can find the frieze that is exceedingly baroque, highlighting this Lao style. The green backdrop shimmers as many carved and gilded vine leaves curve in no apparent order or pattern. This motif is repeated throughout the whole front part of the temple, even surrounding the six small Buddhas that are just below the frieze. This foliage may be an allusion to the lotus flower which is an [[Aniconism|aniconic]] symbol of the Buddha.&lt;ref name="lee"/&gt;

Another Lao characteristic of monasteries is the pointed double archway that flanks the six Buddhas. There are many variations of this characteristic, but the archway of Wat Ong Teu is the most simplistic aesthetically.

One of the most native features to Laos is the ''Naga'', or mythical water serpent, that serves as the guardian of the entrance.&lt;ref name="man"/&gt; The ''Naga'' was widely known in Southeast Asia before Buddhism arrived. They would symbolize the Hindu god Shiva in which they represented destruction and renewal.&lt;ref name="man"/&gt; How they relate to the Buddha lies in the story of Siddhartha under the Bodhi tree.&lt;ref name="lee"/&gt;

This could be the second area one would pass from less secular ground to completely sacred ground. Though ''Nagas'' are usually seen with multiple heads. Wat Ong Teu’s version of the ''Naga'' has a single head with a its bright green body stretched out.&lt;ref name="man"/&gt; There are three sets of ''Nagas'' that all give access to the same patio-type area in front the temple. This aspect is interesting{{Says who|date=December 2011}} because there is only one door that gives an entrance into the temple. It may be a reference to the original function of this ''wat'' as the king’s temple, with the front stairs only being walked on by the king while the others were reserved for normal patrons. The posts perpendicular to these ''Naga'' resemble the sort of pagoda or tower one would see in Laos.&lt;ref name="craft"/&gt;

The doors and windows are made of wood and are decorated with many leaves and stems that spiral sporadically. These images are all carved, painted red and gilded to make the door and windows look as if they were made of metal.&lt;ref name="man"/&gt; Each of the windows and the door have different images of the Buddha either directly or by aniconic representation. Some of them may evidently portray a ''Jataka'', or story given of one of the Buddha’s past incarnations.&lt;ref name="lee"/&gt;

===Roof===
[[File:Laos - Wat Ong Teu, Vientiane.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The roof of Wat Ong Teu Mahawihan.]]
[[File:Vientiane VatOngTeu tango7174.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The three ''Phra Ong Teu'' Buddhas.]]
[[File:Elément de lautel (Vat Ong Theu, Vientiane) (4348875258).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Details of the golden pedestal.]]

Seemingly the most intricate part of the exterior of Wat Ong Teu is its roof. It illustrates myriad styles from around Asia that blend in an extraordinarily harmonious way. 

A commonly used feature in Asia is for a curved roof. This non-linear approach was originated by the Chinese. In China, architects thought that evil spirits despised curved lines, therefore giving an apotropaic effect to the temple.&lt;ref name="lee"/&gt; Lao ideas of the curved roof should have been similar to China’s as well. This aspect is especially important when the principal function of this temple is to teach the Buddhist religion. Students learning the Buddhism should especially be protected from the evils of the outside world.

An interesting feature is the multiple roofs that descend past the boundaries of the wall at a slope. This aspect is exclusive to Laos. Specifically, there are three or four superimposed roofs, with the two bottom roofs being supported by columns from within the temple.&lt;ref name="bussagli"/&gt; The reason for this intricate design is unknown, but it may be another aspect of protection because multiple roofs could cause confusion among evil spirits.

The stone spire decoration with stacked, superimposed, decreasingly sized disks in the center of the keel is definitively a Buddhist element. It is known that before the Buddha went through enlightenment, he was always covered by parasols to indicate his status as a prince.&lt;ref name="lee"/&gt; Therefore, it is not unusual to see a parasol-like spire atop this temple. The other flame-like decorations, called chaw faa (sky clusters), lining the edges and vertices of the roof are frequently used in Laos.&lt;ref name="craft"/&gt; This may be another quality that emphasizes the apotropaic effect of the roof.

== Interior of the ordination hall ==
The exterior may have much detail that is used for protection and attraction, but the interior does not mirror the same intricacy. In the temple, the floors are glossed and the walls and ceiling are painted with the same colors as the exterior. There is a red mat that is lined perfectly from the middle to the back of the ''sim'' where the ''Phra Ong Teu'' image resides. The most intricate objects in the temple are the columns that hold up the roof. They may have been made to look like oversize lotus flowers that have grown from the ground to support the roof of the temple. This may illustrate the natural world for which the Buddha would have liked to teach his followers.

== Modern techniques ==

Once Laos became a French protectorate and reconstruction began, there may have been many liberties made to some of the minute details of the temple, but most of the essential attributes of the temple remain similar to the original construction. A very important change is in the stone and well-kept wood that fortifies the structure of the temple. The brackets are included in this use of preserved timber. There brackets on the outside and the inside. However, the columns are the objects that provide the most support for the three- or four-tiered roofs, so they are treated with more care than the brackets. Therefore, in essence, the modern approach is more of a post-and-lintel technique rather than the use of brackets.&lt;ref name="lee"/&gt; The lack of non-perishable material before French rule over Laos is indicative of their weak government.&lt;ref name="bussagli"/&gt;

Some details (that are usually seen in developed countries in Europe and North America) include small, hanging chandeliers as well as fans placed on each column that lines the ''sim''. These simple touches seem to emit a waning of sacredness for which the temple was originally created, but it may not be complete departure from belief.

Most of the modern techniques may have been meant for the surrounding complex rather than the monastery itself. The central theme of all these buildings and towers remain faithful to that of Wat Ong Teu.

== Art ==

===‘Heavy Buddha’ accompanied by two standing Buddhas===

These original sculptures reside in the sim of the temple toward the furthest wall from the entrance. The ''Phra Ong Teu'' is made of a mix of metals, predominately bronze, and is seated atop a golden pedestal that was cast separately. The head may have been cast separately from the body and put together by the ‘tonged and grooved joint techniques’ showing the skill of Lao craftsmanship.&lt;ref name="bussagli"/&gt; The two standing Buddhas are connected to their respective platforms. These sculptures are raised on top of a platform with a color scheme similar to the rest of the temple.

More recently, these sculptures are draped in linen or silk cloth, depicting the saffron clothing monks usually wear in Laos, with neon-colored halos placed on the wall behind them. This may add an artistic effect to the Buddhas so that a more prestigious role can be emphasized. However, Lao artists of this time never thought of these or other Buddha images as art, only as a means to ‘educate and enlighten.’&lt;ref name="ministry"/&gt; Therefore, later use of this temple as a place for further learning of the Hinayana Buddhism would be the exact purpose the artists intended.

It is usual to see the Enlightened One alone or accompanied by bodhisattvas in a triad, but here all three of these sculptures depict the ''Phra Ong Teu'' Buddha. A strong indication that these sculptures are Buddhas is the parasols that are suspended over them. The smaller Buddhas each have a parasol above them that is attached to a post protruding from behind them. The main Buddha has a distinctively rectangular parasol that is fastened to the ceiling. These parasols act in the same way as the parasol on the keel of the ''wat'', but the parasols that hang over the Buddhas are more decorative. The rectangular parasol hanging over the ''Phra Ong Teu'' is more of a Japanese trait than anything Laos. The only record of any Japanese interaction with Laos would be during a five-year period in WWII.&lt;ref name="askew"&gt;Askew, M., Logan, W. S., &amp; Long, C. (2007). Vientiane: Lao urbanism, memory and identity. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The only action caused by them was the nationalistic passion that the Lao people had in opposition to them.&lt;ref name="stuart"/&gt; Not enough time was put into having any influence on their art of this Buddha or the temple that it is in.

There are many other features of ''Phra Ong Teu'' Buddha that are common in relation to the codified Buddha, but it still has its Lao differences. The earliest image of the Buddha in Laos was influenced by the ‘Pha Bang Khmer style’ but started to become more distinctive in the 16th century along with the golden age.&lt;ref name="man"/&gt;&lt;ref name="askew"/&gt; For example, the tightly curled hair that is displayed on the main Buddha is strongly reminiscent of the Gandhara style of India during the Gupta period, which is mirrored by the ''Pha Bang''.&lt;ref name="lee"/&gt; However, the pointed swelling coming out of the top of the image’s head, signifying ‘transcendent knowledge,’ expresses an exclusively Lao idea.&lt;ref name="craft"/&gt; This type of swell may be a facet solely of the ''Phra Ong Teu'' image that King Setthathirat created. Some other modified aspects of the image are the sharp ear rims with long lobes, the equal, extended length of the fingers and toes, and the sharp wide nose.&lt;ref name="craft"/&gt;&lt;ref name="askew"/&gt;

There are a few ''mudras'', or hand gestures, that these Buddhas portray. These gestures illustrate the Indian influence. Both of the smaller standing Buddhas have their hands up with palms facing outward, meaning fearlessness.&lt;ref name="lee"/&gt; The ''Phra Ong Teu'' Buddha instead adopts two mudras that allude to the moments just before Siddhartha’s Enlightenment. Specifically, the left hand is placed in the lap with the palm facing up toward the face which represents the idea of meditation.&lt;ref name="lee"/&gt; The greater gesture that captures the Enlightenment comes from his right hand. His hand is rested over his knee with fingers extended toward the earth. This symbolizes the calling of the Earth to protect the Buddha from ''Mara'', India’s interpretation of the devil.&lt;ref name="lee"/&gt; This can then be connected to the ''Naga'' that was conjured up to help Siddhartha in his path for Enlightenment.&lt;ref name="man"/&gt; In creating this image, King Setthathirat I proved his adherence to the Theravada Buddhism that has always been present in Laos since Lan Xang.

== Conclusion ==

Of the many temples in Vientiane, Laos today, Wat Ong Teu Mahawihan is one of the more undervalued ones. Every detail that makes up the composition of this monastery has some sort of allusion to the teachings or image of the Buddha. From the ''Nagas'' guarding the entrance to the fastidiously heavy Buddha at the back of the ''sim'' in the temple, from the carved windows and doors to the lotus columns supporting the roof, Wat Ong Teu is a complete illustration of the story of Siddhartha meditating under the Bodhi tree. No area of the temple is left untouched which results in a sense of sacred ground. 

Though it may not be an international symbol, Wat Ong Teu is more widely known as an educational institute that provides widespread teaching of the Theravada Buddhism that originated in India.&lt;ref name="lee"/&gt; That belief hasn’t meandered to this day. As a center for learning, Wat Ong Teu continues to house the teachings of the beginning of Buddhism straight from the Buddha, though the two parties live centuries apart.

With respect to Laos, education of this religion is what allowed France to be interested in them even though France’s main focus was Vietnam. From to the French came Lao nationalism in opposition to the Japanese.&lt;ref name="askew"/&gt; All of this sparked from monasteries in Laos, Wat Ong Teu included.

[[File:Woman of the Apocalypse (Hortus deliciarum).jpg|thumb|An illustration of the woman of the Apocalypse in ''[[Hortus deliciarum]]'' (redrawing of an illustration dated c. 1180), depicting various events from the narrative in Revelations 12 in a single image.]]
The '''Woman of the Apocalypse''' (or '''Woman clothed in the Sun''', {{lang|grc|γυνὴ περιβεβλημένη τὸν ἥλιον}}; ''{{lang|la|Mulier amicta sole}}'') is a figure described in [[Revelation 12|Chapter 12]] of the [[Book of Revelation]] (written c. AD 95).

The woman gives birth to a male child who is threatened by a [[dragon]], identified as the [[Devil]] and [[Satan]], who intends to devour the child as soon as he is born.&lt;ref&gt;Revelation 12:4&lt;/ref&gt; When the child is taken to heaven, the woman flees into the wilderness leading to a "[[War in Heaven]]" in which the angels cast out the dragon. The dragon attacks the woman, who is given wings to escape, and then attacks her again with a flood of water from his mouth, which is subsequently swallowed by the earth. Frustrated, the dragon initiates war on "the remnant of her seed", identified as the righteous followers of Christ.

The Woman of the Apocalypse is widely identified as the [[Virgin Mary]]. This interpretation is held by the [[ancient Church]] as well as in the medieval and modern Roman Catholic Church. This view does not negate the alternative interpretation of the Woman representing the [[Christian Church|Church]], as in modern Catholic dogma, Mary is herself considered both the [[Mother of God]] and the [[Mother of the Church]]. Some Catholic commentaries, such as [[Thomas Haydock]]'s Catholic Bible Commentary (1859), allow for the interpretation of the woman as either the Church or Mary. The commentary of the [[New American Bible]] (the official Roman Catholic Bible for America) states that "The woman adorned with the sun, the moon, and the stars (images taken from Genesis 37:9–10) symbolizes God’s people in the Old and the New Testament. The Israel of old gave birth to the Messiah (Rev 12:5) and then became the new Israel, the church, which suffers persecution by the dragon (Rev 12:6, 13–17); cf. Is 50:1; 66:7; Jer 50:12."&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], [http://www.usccb.org/bible/revelation/12#74012001-2 New American Bible, Revised Edition (NABRE), Revelation 12, footnote 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Reformed theology]] and traditions which are averse to [[Marian veneration]], the interpretation of the Woman represents the church.

==Narrative==
{{wikisource|Bible_(King_James)/Revelation#Chapter_12|Revelation 12 (KJV)}}
{{wikisourcelang|el|Αποκάλυψις_Ιωάννου#12|Αποκάλυψις Ιωάννου ιβʹ}}
The text describes "a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars" (12:1).
The woman is pregnant and about to give birth, "travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered" (12:2).

Then there is "a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads" (12:3) who is about to "devour her child as soon as it was born" (12:4). But her child is "caught up unto God" (12:5), and the woman herself is "fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days." (12:6)

Then there is a description of "[[War in Heaven]]" of the angels against the dragon, and "the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him." (12:9)

The woman is again mentioned in 12:13, as she is persecuted by the dragon, and "two wings of a great eagle" are given to her to escape (12:14).
The dragon attacks her by "water as a flood" emerging from his mouth (12:15), but the flood is swallowed up by the earth (12:16), so the dragon went "to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ" (12:17).

===History===
Ancient witnesses to the Marian interpretation include [[Epiphanius of Salamis|St. Epiphanius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/04z/z_0320-0403__Epiphanius_Salaminis_Episcopus__Homilia_in_laudes_Mariae_deiparae__MGR.pdf.html|title=Epiphanius Salaminis Episcopus - Homilia in laudes Mariae deiparae [0320-0403] Full Text at Documenta Catholica Omnia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tychonius&lt;ref&gt;Tychonius view is transmitted by Cassiodorus, Complexiones in Apocalypsin; PL, 70, 1411&lt;/ref&gt; (who heavily influenced St. Augustine), the unknown author of the [[History of Joseph the Carpenter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf08.vii.vii.html|title=ANF08. The Twelve Patriarchs, Excerpts and Epistles, The Clementia, Apocrypha, Decretals, Memoirs of Edessa and Syriac Documents, Remains of the First - Christian Classics Ethereal Library|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quodvultdeus]] (a disciple of St. Augustine), [[Cassiodorus]] (Complexiones in Apocalypsi, written c. 570 AD), and the Greek Fathers [[Andreas|Andreas of Caesarea]] (late 6th c. / early 7th c.) and [[Oikoumenios]]&lt;ref&gt;Oecumenius in his commentary states that the woman is the Theotokos and that she is present in heaven bodily and describes her as consubstantial with us (i.e. of the same human nature). See The Fathers of the Church, Commentary on the Apocalypse by Oecumenius, translated by John N. Suggit, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GGpSK6yLzvUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Oecumenius&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=U6jCT8GEJ-KsiALw7cnABA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDYQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Oecumenius&amp;f=false  page 107]&lt;/ref&gt; (6th c.).

In modern times, the Marian interpretation has been affirmed by [[Pope Pius X]],&lt;ref name="Pius_X"&gt;St. Pius X, Ad diem illum. ASS 36. 458 - 59: "No one of us does not know that that woman signifies the Virgin Mary, who brought forth our Head with her virginity intact. But the Apostle continues: 'And being with child, she cried out, laboring in birth, and was in pain to be delivered. ' Therefore John saw the Most Holy Mother of God already enjoying eternal happiness, and yet laboring from some hidden birth. With what birth? Surely ours, we who, being yet detained in exile, are still to be brought forth to the perfect love of God and eternal happiness."&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Pope Pius XII]],&lt;ref name="Pius_XII"&gt;Pius XII, Munificentissimus Deus. AAS 42. 762-63: "We frequently find theologians and preachers who, following the footsteps of the Holy Fathers, use words and events from sacred Scripture with some freedom to explain their belief in the Assumption... . And furthermore, the Scholastic doctors have considered the Assumption of the Virgin Mother of God as signified not only in the various figures of the Old Testament, but also in that woman clothed with the sun, whom the Apostle John contemplated on the island of Patmos."&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Pope Paul VI]],&lt;ref&gt;Paul VI, Signum Magnum, May 13, 1967 AAS 59: "The great sign which the Apostle John saw in heaven, 'a woman clothed with the sun' is interpreted by the sacred liturgy, not without foundation, as referring to the most Blessed Mary, the Mother of all men by the grace of Christ the Redeemer."
&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pope John Paul II]].&lt;ref name="John_Paul_II"&gt;John Paul II, Redemptoris Mater, March 15, 1987. Vatican Translation. #24: "... she who was the one 'full of grace' was brought into the mystery of Christ in order to be his Mother and thus the Holy Mother of God, through the Church remains in that mystery as 'the woman' spoken of by the Book of Genesis (3:15) at the beginning and by the Apocalypse (12:1) at the end of the history of salvation."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theological interpretation===
The woman's "male child" is a reference to [[Jesus]] (Revelation 12:5), since he is destined to "rule all nations with a rod of iron" (Revelation 12:5). The dragon trying to devour the woman's child at the moment of his birth (Revelation 12:4) is a reference to [[Herod the Great]]'s attempt to kill the infant Jesus (Matthew 2:16). Through his death and resurrection and Ascension, Jesus "was snatched up to God and to his throne" (Revelation 12:5).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In the interpretation of [[Pius X]] (1904), the birth is not that of Jesus but "surely ours," (i.e. the [[Church Militant]]) "we who, being yet detained in exile, are still to be brought forth to the perfect love of God and eternal happiness".&lt;ref name="Pius_X"/&gt; [[Pius XII]] (1950) makes explicit the reference to the [[Assumption of Mary]].&lt;ref name="Pius_XII"/&gt;
And [[John Paul II]] (1987) to the [[Protoevangelium]] interpretation of Genesis 3:15, and by extension the symbolic identification of the Woman with both Mary and [[Eve]].&lt;ref name="John_Paul_II"/&gt;&lt;!--
&lt;ref&gt;see also James Akin, [http://web.archive.org/web/20050306103919/http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/1997/9705chap.asp The Woman of Revelation 12]  ''This Rock (Catholic Answers Magazine)'', Volume 8, Number 5 (May 1997).{{verify credibility|date=July 2015}}
"The Woman in Revelation 12 is part of the fusion imagery/polyvalent symbolism that is found in the book. She has four referents: Israel, the Church, Eve, and Mary. [...]
The Woman is Eve because she is part of the three-way conflict also involving her Seed and the Dragon, who is identified with the ancient serpent (the one from Eden) in 20:2. This mirrors the conflict in Genesis 3:15 between Eve, the serpent, and her unborn seed—which in turn is a symbol of the conflict between Mary, Satan, and Jesus."
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Veneration===

Both Marian veneration and the interpretation of the Woman of the Apocalypse are recorded since at least the 4th century, but the specific veneration of Mary in this form becomes tangible only in the medieval period. Iconographically, Marian figures associated with the Revelations narrative are recognizable by the astronomical attributes, specifically her standing on a [[wikt:crescent moon|crescent moon]], and the crown of twelve stars (while the description "clothed with the sun" is sometimes rendered by rays emanating from her figure).

Association of Mary with a single star is recorded from the early medieval period, in the hymn ''[[Ave Maris Stella]]''.

Many depictions of Mary from the [[Gothic art|Gothic period]] (14th to 16th century) show her standing on a [[wikt:crescent moon|crescent moon]] inspired by the association of Mary with the woman of the Apocalypse. The motif became so popular in 15th-century Germany that pre-existing Madonna figures were refitted with a crescent (e.g. Madonna of [[Bad Doberan]], c. 1300, refitted in the 15th century).
The [[Our Lady of Guadalupe|Virgin of Guadalupe]] was depicted as the Madonna of the Apocalypse since at least the 16th century.

The Madonna of the Apocalypse became associated with [[Our Lady of the Rosary]], the "crown of twelve stars" being identified with a "rosary of twelve privileges" of Mary.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Rohrmayer, ''Marianisches Wallfahrtsbuch'', 1844, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=9mY9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 45].&lt;/ref&gt; The Virgin of the Rosary is frequently shown with the crown or halo of twelve stars (but not the crescent moon) in modern depictions (since the 19th century&lt;ref&gt;there are examples of Baroque-era predecessors of this iconographic tradition, e.g. [[:File:Virgin Mary - Diego Velazquez.jpg|Diego Velazquez, '' Immaculata conceptio'' (1618)]], [[:File:Dolci Madonna p1070185.jpg|Carlo Dolci, ''Madonna in Glory'' (1670)]].&lt;/ref&gt;). A notable example is the [[Shrine of the Virgin of the Rosary of Pompei|Virgin of the Rosary of Pompei]].

An anecdote (first published in the 1980s) connects the design of the [[Flag of Europe]] (1955) to this aspect of Marian iconography.&lt;ref&gt;Arsène Heitz (1908–1989), one of the designers who had submitted proposals for the flag's design, in 1987, following the adoption of the flag by the EEC, laid claim such a religious inspiration. Heitz also made a connection to the date of the flag's adoption, 8 December 1955, coinciding with the Catholic [[Feast of the Immaculate Conception]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]. The French satirical magazine ''[[Le Canard enchaîné]]'' reacted to Heitz' statement with an article entitled ''L’Europe violée par la Sainte Vierge'' ("Europe Raped by the Blessed Virgin") in the 20 December 1989 edition.

==Interpretation as the Church==
[[File:Mantua 059.JPG|thumb|"Madonna with Child" as the woman in Revelation 12:1; Rotonda di San Lorenzo, Mantua, Italy, 14th century.]]
Commentators who adhere to Reformed Theology in their [[eschatology]] sometimes identify the woman as the Church, and the man-child she gives birth to are the saints.&lt;ref name="biblicist"/&gt; According to this interpretation, Revelation 12:17 describes the remnant of the [[seed of the woman]] as those who keep the commandments of [[God]], and have the testimony of [[Jesus Christ]]. The offspring of the Woman, the Woman's seed, then refers to the [[saint]]s. The man child "who shall rule the nations with a rod of iron" is a symbol of the faithful members of the Church.

In Revelation 2:18-29, the [[Seven churches of Asia|Church in Thyatira]] is promised that the faithful shall rule the nations with a rod of iron. In Revelation 19:15 the same thing is stated of Jesus. In Galatians 4:26, [[Paul the Apostle]] refers to the "[[New Jerusalem]]" as "our mother", and in Revelation 21:2 and Ephesians 5:21-32 the New Jerusalem and the Church is portrayed as the [[Bride of Christ]].

The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] has traditionally identified itself as the end-time "[[Remnant (Adventist)|remnant church]]" described in Revelation 12:17.

The [[Catholic Church]] recognizes the 'woman' as part of the polyvalent symbolism that is found in the book in four referents: [[Israel]], the [[Christian Church|Church]], [[Eve]], and [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]].

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] also interprets the woman to be the Church, and the man-child to be the political kingdom that will grow out of the Church prior to or during the [[Second Coming of Christ]]; this interpretation arises from [[Joseph Smith Translation|Joseph Smith's translation]] of the twelfth chapter of Revelation.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Some in the church interpret the woman to be a symbol of the earth.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Baptisms of fire and water being poured upon the earth and the sun clothing the earth daily are just a couple examples of this reference.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Other interpretations==

===The Nation of Israel===
Dispensational [[Premillennialism|Premillennialists]], and Amillennialists who believe in multiple valid interpretations will often identify the woman as the nation of [[Israel]]. There are several reasons given to support this interpretation. The woman is said to be clothed with the sun, the moon under her feet, and twelve stars. These symbols are drawn from Genesis 37:9–11, in which [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] has a dream of the sun and moon symbolizing his father and mother, and stars representing his eleven brothers, which bow down to him. The Old Testament's prophets referred to Israel as a "woman" (Isaiah 54:5-6; Jeremiah 4:31; Micah 4:9-10).&lt;ref name="biblicist"/&gt;

The woman flees into the wilderness where she is nourished for 1260 days, the equivalent of three and a half years or forty-two months (cf. Rev. 11:1-3). According to this interpretation, these terms are used prophetically in Scripture either for the first half or the last half of the "[[Prophecy of Seventy Weeks|Seventieth Week of Daniel]]," in Daniel 9:24-27, a prophecy specifically addressed to [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] and his people, Israel (Dan. 9:24).&lt;ref name="biblicist"/&gt;

In the latter part of the seventieth week, a remnant of Israel will flee into the wilderness to escape the persecution of [[Antichrist]], who is called "[[Son of perdition|the son of destruction]]," "the lawless one," and "whose coming is in accord with the activity of [[Satan]]" (2 Thess. 2:1-12; cf. Rev. 12:4,9). [[Jesus]], in the [[Olivet discourse]], warned the people of this time which would occur just prior to His return to set up His earthly, Millennial kingdom (Matt. 24:15-22). Further, [[Michael (archangel)|the archangel Michael]] is called the guardian over the sons of Israel in Dan. 12:1. And he will arise at that time of national Israel's tribulation (Dan. 12:1; cf. Rev. 12:7).&lt;ref name="biblicist"&gt;[http://www.biblicist.org/bible/woman.shtml Who's That Woman?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Amillennialist belief can also interpret this passage as the nation of Israel, however this belief as expressed by amillennialists refers, not to the modern Israel, but to the Ancient religious state of Israel(Judea) as it existed in the time of Christ. The Child is Christ, born into the then existing state of Israel, and of Israel's lineage.

The remnant or sons of Israel is, in this understanding, the followers of Christ, the followers of the true religion of Israel as it exists after the coming of the messiah. The "[[Prophecy of Seventy Weeks|Seventieth Week of Daniel]]," and prophecy of the [[Olivet discourse]], in this belief, are ascribed as concerning the first coming of Christ, the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D(During which enforced emperor worship occurred in the temple of Jerusalem, which was later almost totally destroyed, and many Jews were made slaves in distant lands resulting presumably in their remaining families not knowing what happened to them or where they were), and the establishment of Christ's Church, as it currently exists, both on earth and in heaven.

Lutheran scholar Craig Koester, for example, says, "The woman encompasses the story of Israel, from whom the Messiah was born, as well as the story of the church, which was persecuted after Jesus' death and resurrection... John's visionary account of the threat against the woman and the woman's preservation uses imagery that encompasses many moments in the story of God's people. This allows the story to apply to people in many times and places."&lt;ref&gt;Koester, Craig R., ''Revelation and the End of All Things'', Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2001. {{ISBN|0-8028-4660-2}} pp. 123-124.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astrological symbolism===
Russian Orthodox theologian [[Sergei Bulgakov]] (1871–1944) in his interpretation of Revelation notes of the astronomical attributes of the woman in Babylonian, Persian, Greek, and Egyptian mythologies. He takes the crown of twelve stars as representing the [[Zodiac]]. In his interpretation, astronomical attributes of a pagan goddess are here "translated into the language of Christian theology and assume the new symbolism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Sergei |last=Bulgakov|title=The Apocalypse of St. John|year=1948|url=http://www.magister.msk.ru/library/philos/bulgakov/bulgak04.htm |page=44}}
&lt;!--солнце и луна, двенадцать звёзд, знаки Зодиака — эти атрибуты языческой богини--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
In Joseph Smith's [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible|Inspired Translation]] of the King James Bible the woman is identified as "the church of God".

"And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she had a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore years. And there was war in heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought against Michael; And the dragon prevailed not against Michael, neither the child, nor the woman which was the church of God, who had been delivered of her pains, and brought forth the kingdom of our God and his Christ. (Revelation 12:1-17 JST)

===Christian Science===
''[[Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures]]'' (1875), the foundational text of [[Christian Science]], presents the woman in the Apocalypse as symbolizing "generic man, the spiritual idea of God; she illustrates the coincidence of God and man as the divine Principle and divine idea...the spiritual idea of God's motherhood."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker Eddy|first=Mary|title=Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures|year=1910|publisher=Christian Science Publishing Society|location=Boston, MA|isbn=978-0-87952-038-0|pages=561–562}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The man child represents "Christ, God's idea, [which] will eventually rule all nations and peoples - imperatively, absolutely, finally - with divine Science." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker Eddy|first=Mary|title=Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures|year=1910|publisher=Christian Science Publishing Society|location=Boston, MA|isbn=978-0-87952-038-0|pages=565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Buddhist Forum''' ({{zh|t=世界佛教論壇|s=世界佛教论坛|p=Shijie Fojiao Luntan}}) was held in [[Hangzhou]] City and [[Zhoushan]] City, [[Zhejiang Province]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], from April 13 to April 16, 2006. It was the first major international religious conference in China since the founding of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|title=China hosts first Buddhism forum|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4905140.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=13 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Over 1,000 monks and experts from 37 countries and regions attended the forum, giving speeches or participating in discussions under the theme of "A harmonious world begins in the mind."

Among the participants was [[Gyaincain Norbu]], the then 16-year-old Chinese-approved 11th [[Panchen Lama]], who was the figurehead of the forum, and made very rare public appearances. However, according to a news story by [[Reuters]], fellow Buddhists appeared to shun him during opening ceremonies.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

This forum did not include the [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|current and exiled 14th Dalai Lama]], who is viewed by China as a [[separatist]].&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; According to Qi Xiaofei, vice-director of the Chinese state administration for religious affairs, "The Dalai Lama is not only a religious figure, but is also a long-time stubborn [[secessionist]] who has tried to split his Chinese motherland and break the unity among different ethnic groups."&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

==Proposal==
Eight disciples from the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan proposed the World Buddhist Forum in China in 2004, a suggestion that won support from Buddhist circles in countries like Japan and the Republic of Korea.

From October 2004 to November 2005, with the common propagation of the Buddhist communities of Hong Kong, Macao and across the Taiwan Strait, the proposal of hosting the World Buddhist Forum in Mainland China won universal support and an active response from Buddhist communities in over 40 countries. The Chinese government gave assurances it would support the Buddhist community to host the grand historic event.

===Overseers of the First World Buddhist Forum===
*Venerable Master [[Yi Cheng]], President, [[Buddhist Association of China]].
*Losang Jigmê Tubdain Qoigyi Nyima, 6th [[Jamyang Zhepa]] and abbot, [[Labrang Monastery]]; Vice President, [[Buddhist Association of China]].
*Venerable Master [[Ben Huan]], Director, [[Buddhist Association of China]].
*Venerable Master [[Hsing Yun]], Founder, [[Fo Guang Shan]] Monastery, Taiwan.

*Venerable Master [[Sheng Hui]], Vice President and Dean of the Chinese Buddhist Academy.
*Venerable Master [[Sik Kok Kwong|Kok Kwong]], President of the [[Hong Kong Buddhist Association]].

==Purpose and guiding principle==
The forum aimed to set up an open dialogue in equality and pluralism, for those who love the world, care for living beings, respect and protect Buddhism, with a loving heart to conduct exchanges and collaboration. The forum was open to all, Buddhists and non-Buddhists, regardless of tradition or religious background, hoping to accomplish an open dialogue on Buddhist topics.

{{God |expanded=experiences}}

'''Worship''' is an act of [[religion|religious]] [[wikt:devotion|devotion]] usually directed towards a [[deity]]. An act of worship may be performed individually, in an informal or formal group, or by a designated leader.

==Etymology==
The word is derived from the [[Old English]] weorþscipe, meaning ''worship, honour shown to an object'',&lt;ref name=Bosworth&gt;Bosworth and Toller, Anglo-Saxon Dictionary, "[http://www.bosworthtoller.com/035322 weorþscipe]"&lt;/ref&gt; which has been etymologised as "''worthiness''  or ''worth-ship"''—to give, at its simplest, worth to something.&lt;ref&gt;Kay, William K., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vKeM9CZj1ywC&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=isbn:0852444257&amp;q=worship+worth-ship&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;f=false Religion in education]'', Gracewing Publishing, 1997, 372 pages, {{ISBN|0-85244-425-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worship in various religions==

===Buddhism===
{{further|Buddhist devotion|Puja (Buddhism)}}
Worship in [[Buddhism]] may take innumerable forms given the doctrine of [[skillful means]]. Worship is evident in Buddhism in such forms as: [[guru yoga]], [[mandala]], [[thanka]], [[yantra yoga]], the discipline of the fighting monks of [[Shaolin Monastery|Shaolin]], [[panchamrita]], mantra recitation, tea ceremony, [[ganacakra]], amongst others. Buddhist Devotion is an important part of the practice of most Buddhists. According to a spokesman of the Sasana Council of Burma, devotion to Buddhist spiritual practices inspires devotion to the Triple Gem.&lt;ref name=Bosworth /&gt; Most Buddhists use ritual in pursuit of their spiritual aspirations. In Buddhism, puja (Sanskrit &amp; Pali: pūjā) are expressions of "honour, worship and devotional attention."&lt;ref name=Bosworth /&gt; Acts of puja include bowing, making offerings and chanting. These devotional acts are generally performed daily at home (either in the morning or evening or both) as well as during communal festivals and Uposatha days at a temple.

[[Buddhist meditation|Meditation]] ([[samadhi|samādhi]]) is a central form of worship in Buddhism. This practice is focused on the third step of the [[Noble Eightfold Path|Eightfold Path]] that ultimately leads to self awakening, also known as enlightenment. Meditation promotes self-awareness and exploration of the mind and spirit. Traditionally, Buddhist meditation had combined [[samatha]] (the act of stopping and calming oneself) and [[Vipassanā|vipasyana]] (seeing clearly within) to create a complete mind and body experience. By stopping one's everyday activities and focusing on something simple, the mind can open and expand enough to reach a spiritual level. By practicing the step of vipasyana, one does not achieve the final stage of awareness, but rather approaches one step closer. Mindful meditation teaches one to stop reacting quickly to thoughts and external objects that present themselves, but rather to peacefully hold the thought without immediately responding to it. Although in traditional Buddhist faith, enlightenment is the desired end goal of meditation, it is more of a cycle in a literal sense that helps individuals better understand their minds. For example, meditation leads to understanding, leading to kindness, leading to peace, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Maex, Edel (May 2011). "The Buddhist Roots of Mindfulness Training: A Practitioners View". Contemporary Buddhism 12 (1): 165–175. doi:10.1080/14639947.2011.564835. Retrieved 2/9/15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{main|Christian worship|Anglican devotions|Church service|Mass in the Catholic Church}}
In Christianity, a church service is a formalized period of communal worship, often but not exclusively occurring on Sunday, or Saturday in the case of those churches practicing [[seventh-day Sabbatarianism]]. The church service is the gathering together of Christians to be taught the "Word of God" (the Holy Bible) and encouraged in their faith. Technically, the "church" in "church service" refers to the gathering of the faithful rather than to the building in which it takes place. In Christianity, worship is reverent honor and homage paid to God. In the New Testament various words are used for worship. The word proskuneo "to worship" means to bow down to Gods or kings.&lt;ref name=Bosworth/&gt;

'''Mass''' is the central act of divine worship in the Catholic Church,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/dictionary/index.cfm?id=34771] Hardon, John, ''Modern Catholic Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Congregation for Divine Worship]] at the Vatican publishes a Directory on Popular Piety and the Liturgy. Roman Catholic devotions are "external practices of piety" which are not part of the official liturgy of the Catholic Church but are part of the popular spiritual practices of Catholics.&lt;ref name=Bosworth /&gt; They do not become part of liturgical worship, even if conducted in a Catholic church, in a group, in the presence of a priest.

Anglican devotions are private prayers and practices used by Anglican Christians to promote spiritual growth and communion with [[God]]. Among members of the Anglican Communion, private devotional habits vary widely, depending on personal preference and on their affiliation with low-church or high-church parishes.

====Adoration versus veneration====
In the [[New Testament]] various words are used for worship. The word ''proskuneo'' "to worship" means to bow down to gods or kings.&lt;ref&gt;Called to Worship: The Biblical Foundations of Our Response Vernon Whaley - 2009 - In the Greek, the word for worship, proskuneo, means to express deep respect or adoration—by kissing, with words, or by bowing down. Associated words include epaineo, “to commend or applaud”; aineo, “to praise God”; and sebomai,"&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], [[Anglicanism]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], and [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] make a technical distinction between ''[[adoration]]'' or ''[[latria]]'' (Latin ''adoratio'', Greek ''latreia'', ''[λατρεία]''), which is due to God alone, and ''[[veneration]]'' or ''[[dulia]]'' (Latin ''veneratio'', Greek ''douleia'' ''[δουλεία]''), which may be lawfully offered to the [[saint]]s.  The external acts of veneration resemble those of worship, but differ in their object and intent.  Protestant Christians, who reject the veneration of saints, question whether such a distinction is always maintained in actual devotional practice, especially at the level of [[folk religion]].

According to [[Mark Miravalle]] the English word "worship" is equivocal, in that it has been used in Catholic writing, at any rate, to denote both adoration/''latria'' and veneration/''dulia'', and in some cases even as a synonym for veneration as distinct from adoration:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
As St. Thomas Aquinas explains, adoration, which is known as [[latria]] in classical theology, is the worship and homage that is rightly offered to God alone. It is the manifestation of submission, and acknowledgement of dependence, appropriately shown towards the excellence of an uncreated divine person and to his absolute Lordship. It is the worship of the Creator that God alone deserves. Although we see in English a broader usage of the word "adoration" which may not refer to a form of worship exclusive to God—for example, when a husband says that he "adores his wife"—in general it can be maintained that adoration is the best English denotation for the worship of latria.

Veneration, known as dulia in classical theology, is the honor and reverence appropriately due to the excellence of a created person. Excellence exhibited by created beings likewise deserves recognition and honor. We see a general example of veneration in events like the awarding of academic awards for excellence in school, or the awarding of olympic medals for excellence in sports. There is nothing contrary to the proper adoration of God when we offer the appropriate honor and recognition that created persons deserve based on achievement in excellence.

We must make a further clarification regarding the use of the term "worship" in relation to the categories of adoration and veneration. Historically, schools of theology have used the term "worship" as a general term which included both adoration and veneration. They would distinguish between "worship of adoration" and "worship of veneration." The word "worship" (in a similar way to how the liturgical term "cult" is traditionally used) was not synonymous with adoration, but could be used to introduce either adoration or veneration. Hence Catholic sources will sometimes use the term "worship" not to indicate adoration, but only the worship of veneration given to Mary and the saints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Devotion to Mary?|author-first=Mark|author-last=Miravalle|authorlink= Mark Miravalle|publisher=Mother of all peoples
|accessdate=November 2, 2013|date=November 24, 2006
|url=http://www.motherofallpeoples.com/2006/11/what-is-devotion-to-mary/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Orthodox [[Judaism]] and orthodox [[Sunni Islam]] hold that for all practical purposes veneration should be considered the same as prayer; Orthodox Judaism (arguably with the exception of some [[chasidism|Chasidic]] practices), orthodox Sunni Islam, and most kinds of [[Protestantism]] forbid veneration of saints or [[angel]]s, classifying these actions as akin to [[idolatry]].

Similarly, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] assert that many actions classified as [[Patriotism|patriotic]] by Protestant groups, such as saluting a [[flag]], are [[Statolatry|equivalent to worship]] and are therefore considered idolatrous as well.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vQfCTULnr7EC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=false#v=onepage&amp;q=false&amp;f=false Mitchell K. Hall (2009), ''Vietnam War Era : People and Perspectives'', ABC-CLIO, 2009, p. 97]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
{{further|Puja (Hinduism)|Yajna|Bhajan|fasting|kirtan}}
{{Expand section|date=September 2009}}
Worship in [[Hinduism]] involves invoking higher forces to assist in spiritual and material progress and is simultaneously both a science and an art. A sense of ''[[bhakti]]'' or devotional love is generally invoked. This term is probably a central one in Hinduism. A direct translation from the Sanskrit to English is problematic. Worship takes a multitude of forms depending on community groups, geography and language. There is a flavour of loving and being in love with whatever object or focus of devotion. Worship is not confined to any place of worship, it also incorporates personal reflection, art forms and group. People usually perform worship to achieve some specific end or to integrate the body, the mind and the spirit in order to help the performer evolve into a higher being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Worship "Worship"], Krishna Maheshwari, Hindupedia, the online Hindu Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
{{Main|Ibadah}}
[[File:Afghan men praying in Kunar-2009.jpg|thumb|Afghan men at prayer]]
In [[Islam]], worship refers to ritualistic devotion as well as actions done in accordance to Islamic law which is ordained by and pleasing to [[Allah]] (God). Worship is included in the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], primarily that of ''[[salat]]'', which is the practice of ritual prayer five times daily.

According to [[Muhammad Asad]], on his notes in [[The Message of the Qur'an]] translation on 51:56,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus, the innermost purpose of the creation of all rational beings is their cognition of the existence of Allah and, hence, their conscious willingness to conform their own existence to whatever they may perceive of His will and plan: and it is this twofold concept of cognition and willingness that gives the deepest meaning to what the Quran describes as "worship".  As the next verse shows, this spiritual call does not arise from any supposed "need" on the part of the Creator, who is self-sufficient and infinite in His power, but is designed as an instrument for the inner development of the worshipper, who, by the act of his conscious self-surrender to the all-pervading Creative Will, may hope to come closer to an understanding of that Will and, thus closer to Allah Himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Message of the Quran | author = Muhammed Asad (Leopold Weiss). p918, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Judaism===
{{Expand section|date=September 2009}}
{{further|Jewish services}}
Worship of God in Judaism is called ''Avodat Hashem''. During the period when the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] stood, the [[Temple in Jerusalem#Temple services|rites]] conducted there were considered the most important act of Jewish worship.&lt;ref&gt;Shmuel Safrai, [http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/history/tkufot/hamikdash-2.htm Centrality of the Temple during the Second Temple period (Hebrew)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the most common form of worship was and remains that of [[Jewish prayer|prayer]]. Other forms of worship include the conduct of prescribed rituals, such as the [[Passover Seder]] and waving the [[Four Species]], with [[Kavanah|proper intent]], as well as various types of [[Jewish meditation]].

====Worship through mundane activities====
Jewish sources also express the notion that one can perform any appropriate mundane activity as the worship of God. Examples would include returning a [[Lost and found|lost article]] and working to support oneself and one's family.

The [[Shulchan Aruch|Code of Jewish Law]] ([[Orach Chayim]], Chapter 231) cites [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] (3:6), "in all your ways, know him" ([[Hebrew]]: בכל דרכיך דעהו (''b'chol d'rachecha dei'eihu'')), as a biblical source for this idea.

===Sikhism===
{{Expand section|date=September 2009}}
In [[Sikhism]], worship takes place after the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], which is the work of the 10 Sikh Gurus all in one. Sikhs worship God and only one God, known as "One Creator", "The Wonderful Teacher" ([[Waheguru]]), or "Destroyer of Darkness".

===Wicca===
Wiccan worship commonly takes place during a full moon or a new moon. Such rituals are called an [[Esbat]] and may involve a [[magic circle]] which practitioners believe will contain energy and form a sacred space, or will provide them a form of magical protection.&lt;ref&gt;Living Wicca: A Further Guide for the Solitary Practitioner - Page 114, Scott Cunningham - 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern worship==
In modern [[society]] and [[sociology]], some writers have commented on the ways that people no longer simply worship recognised deities, but also (or instead) worship consumer brands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://concen.org/oldforum/showthread.php?tid=40110|title=ConCen Forums|website=concen.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; sports teams, and other people ([[celebrity|celebrities]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/news/84.html?newsstoryid=10384|title=News - The University of Sydney|website=sydney.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociology therefore extends this argument to suggest that religion and worship is a process whereby society worships itself, as a form of self-valorization and self-preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cf.ac.uk/socsi/undergraduate/introsoc/durkheim6.html|title=Emile Durkheim - The Sociology of Religion|website=www.cf.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
