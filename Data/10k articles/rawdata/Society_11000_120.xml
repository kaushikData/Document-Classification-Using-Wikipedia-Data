'''Accessible publishing''' is an approach to [[publishing]] and book design whereby books and other texts are made available in alternative formats designed to aid or replace the reading process. Alternative formats that have been developed to aid different people to read include varieties of larger [[font]]s, specialised fonts for certain kinds of [[reading disability|reading disabilities]], [[Braille]], [[e-books]], and automated [[Audiobook]]s and [[DAISY Digital Talking Book|DAISY]] digital talking books.

Accessible publishing has been made possible through developments in technology such as [[Print on demand]] (POD), [[E-book reader]]s, the [[XML]] structured data format, and the [[Internet]].

==Aim==
The aim of accessible publishing is to make reading easier for those who have difficulties doing such. This group includes people who are blind or visually impaired, people with learning disabilities, and people who are learning a second language. Accessible publishing also aims to allow people to read whichever format allows them to read fastest or allows them to absorb the information in a better way.

In the twenty-first century, the accessible publishing aim is to make every book available in all formats so that every reader can read with ease and proficiency.

Guidelines and techniques for publishing in accessible formats have been made available by several organisations and authors, including:
* EDItEUR: "Accessible Publishing - Best Practice Guidelines for Publishers".&lt;ref&gt;EDItEUR: "[http://www.editeur.org/files/Collaborations/Accessibility/WIPO_v3.html Accessible Publishing - Best Practice Guidelines for Publishers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502035420/http://www.editeur.org/files/Collaborations/Accessibility/WIPO_v3.html |date=May 2, 2013 }}. Version 3 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* Matt Garrish: "Accessible [[EPUB]] 3" (freely available chapter from ''EPUB 3 Best Practices'' by Matt Garrish and Markus Gylling, O'Reilly, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;Matt Garrish: "[http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025283.do Accessible EPUB 3]", in: Matt Garrish and Markus Gylling: ''EPUB 3 Best Practices''.

==History==
Prior to the twenty-first century the publishing industry focused on the production of printed books. The predominant publishing theory, which stressed [[economy of scale]], tended to make only one format of a given book available. In this way they could be mass-produced and made available for the general public. This model did not allow for any other format to be widely available, however.

There were a number of developments in technology that increased the accessibility of books. The first of these was the development of the [[Braille]] language by [[Louis Braille]] in 1821.&lt;ref&gt;Enabling Technologies: [http://www.brailler.com/braillehx.htm How Braille Began].&lt;/ref&gt; After this there was the development of audiobooks which originated from the [[United States Congress]] in 1931&lt;ref&gt;Audiobook Quest: [http://www.audiobookquest.com/article5.html The History of Audiobooks].&lt;/ref&gt; and became popularised by advances in recording and the use of voice actors.

In 1980, [[Thorndike Press]] came into existence as a republisher of large print books.&lt;ref&gt;Thorndike Press: [http://thorndike.gale.com/aboutus.aspx About Thorndike Press]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thorndike Press: [http://thorndike.gale.com/PublicLibraries.aspx Public Libraries].&lt;/ref&gt; Thorndike bought the rights for large print versions of books from publishers and then republished them in a larger and more accessible format for people with reading difficulties.

==Recent developments==
New portable readers, such as the VictorReader Stream&lt;ref&gt;HumanWare USA: [http://www.humanware.com/en-usa/products/blindness/dtb_players/compact_models Victor Reader Digital Talking Book Players].&lt;/ref&gt; and the Plextalk Pocket&lt;ref&gt;Plextalk: [http://www.plextalk.eu/en/top/products/ptp1/ Plextalk Pocket]&lt;/ref&gt; handle talking books in a wide variety of formats including [[DAISY Digital Talking Book]], [[MP3]], text only, and many others.

New technology, such as the [[Sony Reader]]&lt;ref&gt;Sony: [http://store.sony.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?catalogId=10551&amp;storeId=10151&amp;langId=-1&amp;categoryId=8198552921644523779 Reader Digital Book].&lt;/ref&gt; and Amazon’s [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]], has the ability to alter the size of the font automatically. For example, the reader can choose from six different font size settings on the Kindle.&lt;ref&gt;Amazon: [https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Amazons-Wireless-Reading-Device/dp/B000FI73MA Kindle: Amazon's Original Wireless Reading Device (1st generation)].&lt;/ref&gt; The large font sizes available allow for easier reading for the visually impaired.

ReadHowYouWant is another leader in developing this technology.&lt;ref&gt;DAISY Consortium: [http://www.daisy.org/member/274/ReadHowYouWant%20Pty%20Ltd Member Detail: ReadHowYouWant Pty Ltd].&lt;/ref&gt; It works in partnership with publishers to make books available in all formats all across the world.&lt;ref&gt;ReadHowYouWant: [http://www.readhowyouwant.com/pages_about/publishers.aspx Publishers].&lt;/ref&gt; This includes specially designed fonts for [[dyslexia]], [[macular degeneration]] and line tracking problems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6670">'''Al-Mansur Abdallah''' (February 24, 1166 - April 21, 1217), was an [[imam]] of the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] state in [[Yemen]] who held the imamate from 1187 (or 1197) to 1217.

==Background==

Abdallah bin Hamzah was born in the village Ayshan in the territory of the [[Hamdan]] tribe. He belonged to the Hamzite Sharifs, a division of the dynasty of the [[Rassids]]. He was the next generation descendant of the imam [[al-Muhtasib al-Mujahid Hamzah]] who died in battle in 1066.&lt;ref&gt;The line of descent is: al-Muhtasib al-Mujahid Hamzah - Ali - Hamzah - Sulayman - Hamzah - al-Mansur Abdallah.&lt;/ref&gt; In his youth, he took up [[quranic]] studies and was an outstanding student who acquired a good juridical knowledge. As an adult, he was described as a large and well-shaped man with a heavy beard.&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Schneider, 'Les inscriptions arabes de l'ensemble architectural de Zafar-Dhi Bin (Yémen du Nord)', ''Journal asiatique'' 273 1985, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The Zaidi community of the northern highland had not been able to appoint a new imam after the demise of [[al-Mutawakkil Ahmad bin Sulayman]] in 1171. Abdallah made a proclamation in [[Al Jawf Governorate|Jawf]] in 1187. Although acknowledged by several men of standing, his attempt to gain power over the Zaidi community was a failure, and he withdrew to Jawf.

==Renewed call for the imamate==

By this time, the main external threat against the Zaidis was the [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]] [[Ayyubid Dynasty]], which had invaded Yemen from its base in [[Egypt]] in 1173. The new regime quickly occupied much of the country. The important highland city [[San'a]] was, for most of the time, in the hands of the [[Hamdanid sultans|Hatimid Sultan]] Ali bin Hatim, whose attitude to the Ayyubids alternated between submission and resistance. When the Ayyubid ruler Tughtakin, a brother of [[Saladin]], died in 1197, virtually all Yemen except [[Sa'dah]], the traditional centre of the [[Zaydiyyah]], was in Ayyubid hands. In September or October 1197, the month after Tughtakin's death, Abdallah made his second bid for the imamate, and this time he was successful. As imam, he carried the honorific (''laqab'') title al-Mansur Abdallah.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', Vol. VI. Leiden 1991, p. 433; Madeleine Schneider 1985, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; He established his residence in Sa'dah. Al-Mansur was a man of learning, and 81 works by his hand are listed in one source. Among his writings are a treatise on the mutual conduct of children and parents, answers to questions about the first four [[caliph]]s, a [[Diwan (poetry)|diwan]], a ''rajaz'' poem on the care and training of horses, and a four-volume work dealing with doctrinary questions, ''Ash-Shafi''.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Brockelmann, ''Geschichte der arabischen Litteratur'', Vol. I. Leiden 1943, p. 509; ''The Cambridge History of Arabic Literature; Abbasid Belles-Lettres''. Cambridge 1990, p. 462.&lt;/ref&gt; He sent his [[da'i]] (messengers) to [[Gilan]] and [[Dailamites|Deylaman]] in [[Persia]], so that the [[khutba]] was read in his name among the Zaidis there. He also enjoyed some influence in the [[Hijaz]]. Al-Mansur Abdallah took a strict stance on religious matters, expelling unchaste women and pouring fermented drinks on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Schneider 1985, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mutarrifiyyah sect, which was considered heretic, was mercilessly crushed and its [[mosque]] near San'a was torn down on the orders of al-Mansur.&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge History of Arabic Literature'', 1990, p. 462.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Struggles over San'a==

In 1197, Sultan Ali allied with al-Mansur Abdullah and fought against Mu'izz ad-Din Isma'il, the Ayyubid sultan in Yemen. The allies were heavily defeated at [[Hadur]]. However, a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] emir, Haku bin Muhammad, and the [[Mamluk]] Shams al-Khawass, subsequently fell away from the Ayyubids and joined the Zaidi camp. The imam and Shams al-Khawass seized San'a, which momentarily stood under an Ayyubid governor. Nevertheless, the two allies immediately fell out with each other, since Shams al-Khawass was suspicious of the imam's influence among the masses. The imam had to sneak out of San'a with great effort, but managed to reach his troops outside the city walls and took possession of the city. In 1198, a new Ayyubid army marched towards San'a but was defeated by the Zaidi forces at [[Dhamar, Yemen|Dhamar]]. Shortly afterwards, however, San'a was captured by still another Ayyubid contingent, and al-Mansur Abdullah withdrew to the mountainous stronghold [[Thula]].&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Serjeant &amp; R. Lewcock, ''San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City''. London 1983, pp. 61-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuing struggles against the Ayyubids==

In the following years, the inconclusive Zaidi struggle against the Ayyubids wore on. San'a was in the hands of the imam for several short terms. In 1203, the imam strengthened the fortress of [[Zafar, Yemen|Zafar]], and in 1205 he made peace with the Ayyubid governor in San'a, Wurdashar. Nevertheless, the peace only lasted for about two years. Serious fighting broke out in 1215, and this time a number of Zaidi strongholds in the north were captured. Al-Mansur Abdallah withdrew to [[Kawkaban]] where he took up a strong position. A large residence was constructed there, with quarters for his followers. A [[Mint (coin)|mint]] was also established. A new Zaidi-Ayyubid peace was concluded in 1216, but fighting was resumed within short. The following battles turned inconclusive, and the warfare was terminated when the imam died in Kawkaban in 1217.&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Serjeant &amp; R. Lewcock, 1983, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; After his demise, the Zaidi community was split between two rival imams. These were his son [[an-Nasir Muhammad bin Abdallah|an-Nasir Muhammad]], and [[al-Hadi Yahya]] who belonged to another [[Rassids|Rassid]] branch. Al-Mansur's nephews settled in the northern highland, adjacent to [[Asir]], where they pursued their own secular policy, allying with the Zaidi imams, the Sulaymanid Sharifs, and the Rassids according to opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Stookey, ''Yemen; The Politics of the Yemen Arab Republic''. Boulder 1978, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3754">'''Andreas Balzar''', nicknamed '''Balzar of Flammersfeld''' ({{lang-de|Balzar von Flammersfeld}}), full name ''Andreas Ludwig Balzar'' (1769–1797) was a [[Germany|German]] [[robber]]. At the point of death, he confessed to killing 21 officers with his own hands.

== Early life ==
Andreas Balzar was born on 28 January 1769 in [[Höchstenbach]] in the German mountain region of [[Westerwald]]. As the eldest son, he should have followed his father into the [[priesthood]]. At first, he acceded to his father's will and attended the high school in [[Herborn, Hesse|Herborn]]. After being exposed there as the long-sought [[poacher]] of the prince's game estate, he was expelled from school, but before he was handed over to the court, he managed to escape from Herborn. He reached his parents' home in [[Flammersfeld]], but his father turned him away.

== Russian military service ==
He is said to have moved to [[Russian Empire|Russia]], where his brother served in the [[Tsar]]'s bodyguard. He found service as a soldier fulfilling and rose to the rank of [[captain (army)|captain]] in the bodyguard.

== Return home ==
It is unclear what prompted him to return to his homeland, the [[Westerwald]]. But when he did, he quickly fell in with a band of marauding robbers; he subsequently formed his own gang of poachers and made himself its leader.

When a [[France|French]] [[officer (army)|officer]] indecently assaulted Balzar's bride as his troops marched through Flammersfeld, Balzar asked his hunters to help him hunt the French. Farmers and young boys also followed his call, but his appeal for a general uprising in the Westerwald was unsuccessful. At times, Balzar fought with his ''[[Freischärler]]s'' on the side of the Imperials (''Kaiserliche''), as the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian]] troops were called, but he often carried out his own ventures with his men. Under the name "Le capitain noir" ("The Black Captain") he was searched for by the French; several times he was able to escape from their captivity. In summer 1797, however, he was betrayed into the hands of a French search party, who brought him to Westerburg, where he was sentenced to death by shooting at a [[court martial]]. Although he was a poacher in the eyes of the French, the fact that he was not, like robber leader [[Johannes Bückler|Schinderhannes]] was led to the [[scaffold (execution site)|scaffold]] or hanged may have had something to do with his Russian officer rank. However, his death by shooting made him a hero in the Westerwald for decades. He was executed on 3 October 1797 in [[Westerburg]].

Even today, Flammersfeld hosts performances of his fateful life; the Hessian author and archivist, [[Christian Spielmann]], made him a character in a novel at the beginning of the 20th century as "Balzar of Flammersfeld".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3046">'''Anti-Capitalist Convergences''' ('''ACC''') are organizations which sprang up in [[North America]] in the late 1990s and early 2000s as forms of coordinating activities by the growing [[social justice]], [[anarchist]], and [[environmentalist]] [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalists]].  Many of the ACCs were set up in anticipation of or as a result of a major protest.&lt;ref name=imageproblem/&gt;

Generally, Anti-Capitalist Convergences were assembled as umbrella organisations, to coordinate different groups and struggles. However, many have become groups unto themselves. In the wake of the "[[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|Battle of Seattle]]" and a similar resurgence of anti-capitalist protest and organising, activists in cities such as Seattle; Washington, D.C.; and Chicago formed Convergences to carry out protests more effectively and to ensure that anti-capitalist organising would continue after major demonstrations had left the city. The Convergences were also billed as a counterweight to more mainstream coalitions and trade unions who radicals claimed dominated protests.

By far the most successful of the Anti-Capitalist Convergences has been the one, based in Montreal, best known by its French acronym: CLAC (Convergence des Luttes Anti-Capitalistes). Originally formed to coordinate protests at the Quebec City Summit of the Americas in April, 2001, it continued to operate afterwards, and provided the engine for the Take the Capital! protests the following year. It has also proven strong within its own community, launched anti-gentrification campaigns, and worked to help non-status immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcgilldaily.com/2014/05/may-day-demonstrations-sweep-montreal/ Jill Bachelder, Janna Bryson and Igor Sadikov " May Day demonstrations sweep Montreal" ''The McGill Daily'', May 3, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

As quickly as many ACCs sprung up, most of them have fallen apart. Montreal; Seattle; Colorado; Chicago; New York City; and Washington, D.C., have all seen their ACCs collapse. However, there are now ACCs active overseas in the Philippines and Japan and efforts are under way to revive an anti-capitalist umbrella group in Montreal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6095">'''Anti-Somali sentiment'''  refers to the existence of hostility against [[Somalis]], or their culture. Anti-Somali sentiment is sometimes referred to as '''Somaliphobia'''&lt;ref name="npr" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/11/19/142530740/tension-runs-high-in-kenyas-little-mogadishu|title=Tension Runs High In Kenya's 'Little Mogadishu'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or '''Somaliphobic sentiment'''.&lt;ref name="sudan" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article55708|title=Does South Africa black-phobic blacks suffer inferiority complex? - Sudan Tribune: Plural news and views on Sudan|website=www.sudantribune.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
The [[2000s (decade)|Aughties]] and early 2010s saw a major sporadic outbreaks of violence against Somali shopkeepers in [[South Africa]]. This violence has been attributed to jealousy over the success of Somalis businesses, ethnic tensions.&lt;ref&gt;Charman, Andrew, and Laurence Piper. "Xenophobia, criminality and violent entrepreneurship: violence against Somali shopkeepers in Delft South, Cape Town, South Africa." South African Review of Sociology 43.3 (2012): 81-105.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some writers have attributed such hostility to a wider xenophobia, since other non-South Africa Africans were targeted as well.&lt;ref name="sudan" /&gt; Somaliphobia has also been reported in Kenya during their invasion into [[Jubbaland]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt; Anti-Somali sentiment is sometimes expressed in the context of anti-immigration sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wctrib.com/news/education/4375574-integration-center-coffee-encourages-communication|title=Integration Center coffee encourages communication|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-Somali sentiment is also sometimes expressed alongside anti-black sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;https://muslimlink.ca/voices/mogadishu-attack-somalia-ahmed-hussen-farhia-ahmed-somali-canadian-ottawa&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. president [[Donald Trump]]'s rhetoric regarding Somalis have been described as Somaliphobic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/minnesota-elects-first-female-somali-american-lawmaker/3591350.html|title=Minnesota Elects First Female Somali American Lawmaker|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-Somali sentiments sometimes overlap with Islamophobic sentiments. On Oct. 30, 2015, Asma Jama (a Muslim woman of Somali descent and Kenyan nationality) was beaten for speaking Swahili in an Applebee's in the outskirts of Minneapolis. The perpetrator for that violence was charged with third-degree assault. On June 2016, two Somalis were shot after wearing their traditional clothing.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2016/07/25/shooting-minneapolis-somali-anthony-sawina/|title=Lauderdale Man Charged In Alleged 'Hate Crime' Shootings|last=|first=|date=July 25, 2016|website=CBS News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week prior to the shooting, a Somali halal shop in the city was vandalized.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mic.com/articles/147640/2-muslim-men-were-shot-near-minneapolis-mosque-police-are-investigating-as-hate-crime#.KHsVINeYv|title=2 Muslim Men Were Shot Near Minneapolis Mosque, Police Are Investigating as Hate Crime|last=Harvard|first=Sarah A.|date=1 July 2016|work=Mic|access-date=15 May 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minneapolis City Council member Abdi Warsame discussed anti-Somali sentiments in the aftermath of the shooting of Justine Damond by a Somali police officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/warsame-blasts-anti-somali-rhetoric-in-wake-of-damond-shooting/436190813/|title=Warsame blasts anti-Somali rhetoric in wake of Damond shooting.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abusiveness==
There are also some pejorative terms that serve to dehumanize Somalis. The term ''skinnie'' became popularized with the film Black Hawk Down. The term has been said to allude to reducing Somalis to their humanitarian struggles&lt;ref&gt;Behnke, Andreas. "The re-enchantment of war in popular culture." Millennium 34.3 (2006): 937-949.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[NPR|National Public Radio]] has suggested that its usage deprives Somalis of their own point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, Harlan. "Bad day at black rock." Film Comment 38.1 (2002): 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Abdi'' is also sometimes pejoratively used to refer to male Somalis.&lt;ref&gt;Phoenix, Aisha. "Somali young women and hierarchies of belonging." Young 19.3 (2011): 313-331.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Associated Press]]'s stylebook suggested that ''Somali'' is the correct demonym or adjective rather than ''Somalian''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/apstylebook/status/776505681037975556?lang=en|title=AP Stylebook on Twitter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intra-Somali==
Prejudice against Somalis sometimes comes from other Somalis. For example, there are terms such as  Iidoor or kabadhe iidoora, that roughly translates as "exchange", a term viewed as pejorative that is aimed at ''[[Isaaq]]'' clan members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=European Association of Somali Studies |author2=Indiana University |title=First Conference, 23rd-25th September |date=1993 |page=21 |quote=The pejorative slang terms iidoor or kabadhe iidoora (loosely meaning "exchange") ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''faqash'' was a derogatory term used by [[Isaaq]] dominated [[Somali National Movement|SNM]] forces to refer to Siad Barre's armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Renders |first1=Marleen |title=Consider Somaliland: State-Building with Traditional Leaders and Institutions |date=2012 |page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the SNM's portrayal of the Barre's government as a [[Darod]] dictatorship, according to Lidwien Kapteijns, the term ''faqash'' "could become a code word for “the Daarood-enemy-to-be exterminated-and-expelled” whereby "clan-cleansing could be concealed in wide-open public view.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kapteijns |first1=Lidwien |title=Clan Cleansing in Somalia: The Ruinous Legacy of 1991 |date=2012 |page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aztec clothing''' is the [[clothing]] that was worn by the [[Aztec]]s, as well as other [[pre-Columbian]] peoples of central [[Mexico]] who shared similar cultures. Strict [[sumptuary laws]] dictated the type of fiber, ornamentation and how clothing was worn by class. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anawalt|first=Patricia|date=1980|title=Costume and Control: Aztec Sumptuary Laws|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41726816|journal=Archaeology|volume=33 no. 1|pages=33-43|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aztec (women and men) would tend to always decorate themselves with gold bangles, necklaces, chokers, etc. Such jewelry was worn to show how wealthy one was; a poor or unwealthy Aztec would tend to wear less jewelry than an Aztec of higher placing and wealth.

The jewelry worn by the Mayan, Aztec, and Inca people was rich in variety and quite beautiful.{{Says who|date=September 2011}} Without metalworking skills, Mayans made jewelry from many other materials. Mayan men wore nose ornaments, earplugs, and lip plugs made of bone, wood, shells, and stones, including jade, topaz, and [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]]. Necklaces, bracelets, anklets, and headgear were made with jaguar and crocodile teeth, jaguar claws, and feathers. Mayan women and children wore less elaborate necklaces and earrings of similar materials.

Aztecs and Incas perfected metalworking to a great art. Gold and silver jewelry was worn alongside ornaments made of feathers, shells, leather, and stones. Among the Aztecs, laws about which ornaments could be worn were strictly enforced. Only royalty could wear headdresses with gold and quetzal (a bird with brilliant blue-green feathers that reach three feet in length) feathers, for example. The weaving tradition, so important to Incas, helped create beautiful woven headdresses. Inca emperors wore woven hats trimmed with gold and wool tassels or topped with plumes, or showy feathers. Incas also created elaborate feather decorations for men: headbands made into crowns of feathers, collars around the neck, and chest coverings. In addition, wealthy Inca men wore large gold and silver pendants hung on their chests, disks attached to their hair and shoes, and bands around their arms and wrists. Inca women adorned themselves simply with a metal fastening for their cloak called a tupu. The head of their tupu was decorated with paint or silver, gold, or copper bells.

==Battle regalia==
[[File:Codex Mendoza folio 65r.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Aztec warriors and priests as depicted in the [[Codex Mendoza]], wearing battle suits and tilmahtli tunics.]]
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
All warriors wore loincloths, and basic military armor called [[ichcahuipilli]]. When they were recognized by the state for their bravery in battle, their status increased (regardless of original class) and they were rewarded with shell and glass beaded jewelry. If the warrior was more honored or a higher rank, they would wear battle suits called Tlahuiztli; these  suits were distinctively decorated  for prestigious warriors and members of warrior societies. They served as a way to identify warriors according to their achievements in battle as well as rank, alliance, and social status like priesthood or nobility. Usually made to work as a single piece of clothing with an opening in the back, they covered the entire torso and most of the extremities of a warrior, and offered added protection to the wearer. The tlahuiztli was made with elements of animal hide, leather, and cotton. Warriors were also allowed to wear sandals as they progressed through the ranks.

A '''barn dance''' is any kind of [[dance]] involving traditional or [[folk music]] with [[Folk dance|traditional dancing]], occasionally held in a [[barn]], but, these days, much more likely to be in any suitable building.  

The term “barn dance” is usually associated with family-oriented or community-oriented events, usually for people who do not normally dance.  The [[Caller (dance)|caller]] will, therefore, generally use easy dances so that everyone can join in.

A barn dance can be a [[Céilí|ceilidh]], with traditional [[Irish dance|Irish]] or [[Scottish country dance|Scottish dancing]], and people unfamiliar with either format often confuse the two terms. However, a barn dance can also feature [[square dancing]], [[contra dancing]], [[English country dance]], dancing to [[country and western]] music, or any other kind of dancing, often with a live band and a [[Caller (dancing)|caller]]. [[Modern western square dance]] is often confused with barn dancing in Britain.

Barn dances, as social dances, were popular in Ireland until the 1950s, and were typically danced to tunes with 4/4 rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;Vallely, F. (1999). The Companion to Traditional Irish Music. New York University Press: New York, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:USBarnDanceShows.png|thumb|Barn dance shows in the United States]]

[[WLS (AM)|WLS]] in Chicago is credited with developing the “barn dance” radio format, which was in large part responsible for the advent of [[country music]] in the United States. The [[National Barn Dance]] began as a program of old-time fiddling on April 19, 1924, with [[George D. Hay]] as the show's host and announcer.  A year-and-a-half later, Hay moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and brought in an old-time fiddler to launch the  ''[[WSM (AM)|WSM]] Barn Dance''; this show is now known as the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and remains on the air to this day. Dozens of similar programs cropped up on [[AM radio]] stations all across the United States, from New England to Los Angeles, including the [[WWVA Jamboree]] in Wheeling, West Virginia (1933), the [[Renfro Valley Barn Dance]] in Kentucky (1939), the [[Louisiana Hayride]] (1948), [https://web.archive.org/web/20081205120313/http://www.southernspaces.org/contents/2008/hanson/1a.htm the Tennessee Jamboree] (1953) and [[Ozark Jubilee]] (1954). Television adaptations (often under the guise of early [[variety show]]s) were popular in the 1950s and early 1960s but eventually faded out of style.

The '''Bhatti Khanzada''' of [[Awadh]] are a [[Muslim Rajput]] community found mainly in the [[Barabanki district]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]] in [[India]]. There is also a distinct community of Bhattis found in the village of Yahiapur in [[Pratapgarh district, Uttar Pradesh|Pratapgarh district]]. The [[Awadh]] region covers most of the eastern areas of [[Uttar Pradesh]], and is home to a distinct culture. A small number of Bhatti Muslims are also found in the districts of [[Bahraich district|Bahraich]] and [[Balrampur district|Balrampur]]. They are sub-group within the larger [[Khanzada (Awadh)|Khanzada]] community of eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]].

Other than the [[taluqdar]] families, the majority of the [[Barabanki city|Barabanki]] Bhatti are small to medium-sized farmers. With the abolishment of [[zamindar]]i system of feudal ownership, has had a strong impact on the large landowning families, as much of their land has been redistributed. They are [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]]s, The Bhatti have always been more orthodox then the [[Khanzada (Awadh)|Khanzada]], a neighbouring [[Muslim Rajput]] community. Like other communities in [[Awadh]], they are largely endogamous, marrying close kin. They have no connection with the [[Ranghar]] [[Bhatti]] of western [[Uttar Pradesh]] or those of [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Caste and Social Stratification Among Muslims edited by Imtiaz Ahmed page 212 Manohar 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also other Bhatti communities in [[Awadh]], such as those of Yahiapur in [[Pratapgarh district, Uttar Pradesh|Pratapgarh district]]. They have no connection with the [[Barabanki city|Barabanki]] Bhattis.

The '''British Household Panel Survey''' (BHPS), carried out at the Institute for Social and Economic Research of the [[University of Essex]], is a [[Survey (human research)|survey]] for social and economic research. A sample of British households was drawn and first interviewed in 1991. The members of these original households have since been followed and annually interviewed. The resulting data base is very popular among social scientists for quantitative analyses of social and economic change. One of the most important precursors of the BHPS is the [[Panel Study of Income Dynamics]] (PSID), established in the 1960s at the [[University of Michigan]], Ann Arbor (USA). The first cohort consisted of 10,300 individuals across Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/bhps|title=British Household Panel Survey|website=Institute for Social and Economic Research, [[University of Essex]]|accessdate=2016-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[panel study|panel survey]] it is a form of [[longitudinal study]].

Since 2008, the BHPS has been integrated into the [[UKHLS]], now known as Understanding Society.

BHPS data are integrated into the [[European Community Household Panel]] and the [[Cross National Equivalent File]] (CNEF) which contains panel data from Australia, Canada, Germany, Great Britain and the United States.

The '''Conférence Molé''' was a French debating society founded in 1832. 
In 1876 it became the '''Conférence Molé-Tocqueville'''. 
Its purpose was to debate legislation, administration, political economy and general politics.
The debates were modeled on parliamentary procedures and served to train future politicians.
The society also provided a venue where young men of the élite could meet and become known by established political figures. 
The society became dormant in the 1970s but was revived in the 1990s.

==Foundation==

The Conférence Molé was founded during the [[July Monarchy]] on 19 March 1832.{{sfn|Martin-Frugier|1989|p=233}}
It was founded  by the [[Marthe Camille Bachasson, Count of Montalivet|Count of Montalivet]] and sponsored by king [[Louis Philippe]].{{sfn|Mayeur|Corbin|Schweitz|1995|p=47}}
The choice of name has not been explained, but seems to be a reference to the politician [[Louis-Mathieu Molé]] (1781–1855).{{sfn|Martin-Frugier|1989|p=234}}
One of the co-founders was M. Pontmartin, possibly Armand Pontmartin.
Another was Huard-Delamarre, an advocate.
There were three magistrates: Adrien Gastambide, Gustave Aignan and Édouard Ternaux, nephew of the cashmere manufacturer [[William-Louis Ternaux]].{{sfn|Martin-Frugier|1989|p=233}}
Four founders were members of the council of state: Mortimer Ternaux, Achille Guilhem, [[Prosper Hochet]] and [[Édouard Bocher]].
Charles His and the Count of Cambis were embassy secretaries, and Grille de Beuzelin was a functionary in a ministry.
Other founders were Edmond Anthoine, Édouard Goupil, Francisque Lefèvre and Alp. d'Herbelot.{{sfn|Martin-Frugier|1989|p=234}}

}}
The headquarters of the Conférence Molé were at 8, rue de Poitiers, in the [[Académie Nationale de Médecine|Academy of Medicine]].
At first the membership was limited to 80, divided into four committees.
Later this was changed to 150, without mention of committees.{{sfn|Martin-Frugier|1989|p=234}}
A list of members seeking admission was prepared each year.
Each candidate had to be sponsored by three members, with a declaration prepared by one of the sponsors.{{sfn|Martin-Frugier|1989|p=234}}
Admission was accepted at the meeting of the members.
The entrance fee was 10 francs, with a contribution of 24 francs for each session, or 48 francs for the year.{{sfn|Martin-Frugier|1989|p=235}}
After ten years of attendance members became honorary members.
The Molé was a place where young men of the élite could mix with notable older men.{{sfn|Nagai|2002|p=131}}
The board of directors was a permanent body, unlike the presidency which lasted only to six months and was meant to alternate between left and right wing presidents.{{sfn|Béguec|Manigand|2004|p=28}}

The society trained young people in debates and in the workings of a legislative chamber.{{sfn|Nagai|2002|p=132}}
Its purpose was to study and consider legislation, administration, political economy and general politics.{{sfn|Martin-Frugier|1989|p=235}}
Members met weekly for six months of the year.
The proceedings were modelled on those of the [[Chamber of Deputies (France)|Chamber of Deputies]] or [[Corps législatif]].
A mock bill was tabled by a member, examined in committee and then presented to the general assembly.
After discussion, the members voted on the bill.{{sfn|Nagai|2002|p=131}}
Topics included prostitution, decentralization and freedom of association.{{sfn|Gerson|2003|p=245}}

It was customary for a member to make their maiden speech on the first occasion after being admitted.{{sfn|An "Attaché"|1885|p=190}}
The members formed factions based on political affinities, like the political groups in parliament.{{sfn|Nagai|2002|p=131}}
The meeting room contained "desks as in the Chamber, a committee, a gallery.{{sfn|Gerson|2003|p=245}}
Franck Chauveau, president of the society in 1876, said "We naturally acquire a taste here for free institutions, a spirit of discussion and free scrutiny, the habits of parliamentary life of which the Conférence is the image.{{sfn|Nagai|2002|p=132}}

==History==

The Conférence Molé was an important training group for future political leaders in the July Monarchy.{{sfn|Gerson|2003|p=245}}
Around 1845 the Molé absorbed a similar, well-known society, the Conférence d'Orsay.{{sfn|Martin-Frugier|1989|p=239}}
The Conférence d'Orsay had been founded in 1839 by some young, conservative aristocrats and law students who met at the [[Quai d'Orsay]].
It was joined by [[Louis Ferdinand Alfred Maury]] in 1841 after he left the Conférence Bailly.{{sfn|Martin-Frugier|1989|p=240}}
The Molé played a key role during the [[French Second Republic]].{{sfn|Manigand|2000|p=34}}
In 1850 the Conférence Molé moved to 40, rue des Saints-Pères, following the Academy of Medicine.
It remained there until 7 July 1939.{{sfn|Martin-Frugier|1989|p=239}}

The Molé tended to be moderately conservative under the July Monarchy, and was critical of the authoritarian regime of the [[Second French Empire]].{{sfn|Nagai|2002|p=132}}
It was one of the rare places where some degree of free public discussion was allowed under the Empire.{{sfn|Mayeur|Corbin|Schweitz|1995|p=88}}
[[Léon Gambetta]] was admitted to the Molé in 1861 and wrote to his father, "It is no mere lawyers club, but a veritable political assembly with a left, a right, a center; legislative proposals are the sole subject of discussion. It is there that are formed all the political men of France; it is a veritable training ground for the tribune."{{sfn|Nord|1995|p=123}}
Gambetta, like many other French orators, learned the art of public speaking at the Molé.
At that time the Molé met in the [[Café Procope]] in the Rue de l'Ancienne-Comédie, the oldest coffee house in Paris.
Other active members during this period included [[Ernest Picard]], Clément Laurier and Léon Renault.{{sfn|Fraser's Magazine|1881|p=348}}

Debating societies flourished in the second half of the 19th century in the absence of political parties.
Of these, the Conférence Molé, known simply as "Le Molé", was the most influential and the most politicized.{{sfn|Nagai|2002|p=131}}
Under the [[French Third Republic]] many members of the Molé became parliamentary leaders, so membership was sought after by aspiring politicians.{{sfn|Nagai|2002|p=132}}
On 28 April 1876 the Conférence Molé merged with the Conférence Tocqueville, which had been founded in 1863.{{sfn|Martin-Frugier|1989|p=239}}
{{efn|The Tocqueville was founded by Charles Savary, a future minister of the Third Republic, for young men who found it too difficult to join the Molé. 
In 1870 it absorbed the less political Conférence La Bruyère, and in 1871 absorbed the Conférence Montesquieu.{{sfn|Nagai|2002|p=132}} }}
The Conférence Molé-Tocqueville continued to prosper.
By 1886 it had 344 members and 376 former members.{{sfn|Nagai|2002|p=132}}
The society was less active in the 1880s, but experienced a revival in the 1890s when it was stimulated by competition and the introduction of new debating techniques.{{sfn|Manigand|2000|p=34}}
On 30 April 1897 [[Félix Faure]], President of France, decreed that the Conférence Molé-Tocqueville was an "establishment of public utility".{{sfn|Histoire: La Conférence}}

Of the 320 cabinet members from 1871 to 1914, 26 had belonged to the Molé, 6 to the Tocqueville, 10 to the Molé-Tocqueville and 2 to the Bruyère.
43 ministers, or 13.4%, had belonged to one of these societies.{{sfn|Nagai|2002|p=132}}
Of Paris municipal councilors between 1871 and 1914, 12 had been members of the Molé, 4 of the Tocqueville and 40 of the Molé-Tocqueville.
[[Édouard Hervé]] had belonged to both the Molé and the Tocqueville before their merger.
A total of 44 people had thus belonged to one of the societies, or 9.7% of the councilors.
These men often played a leading role in the municipal council: 20 were presidents, vice-presidents or secretaries of the council.{{sfn|Nagai|2002|p=133}}

In the period between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], 105 deputies belonged to the Conférence Molé-Tocqueville before being elected.{{sfn|Nagai|2002|p=132}}
After World War II the Conférence Molé-Tocqueville resumed its sessions, and had lively debates during the [[Algerian War]].
It became moribund in the 1970s.
A 1989 paper dated the last traces of its existence to 1978.{{sfn|Martin-Frugier|1989|p=239}}
The conference was revived in the 1990s to discuss involvement of civil society in the French economic and social fabric.{{sfn|Histoire: La Conférence}}

==Noted members==

Early members included [[Louis Wolowski]] and Édouard Allou, who became president.{{sfn|Mayeur|Corbin|Schweitz|1995|p=47}}
Several non-removable Senators belonged to the conferences.
Lawyers included [[René Bérenger]], [[Louis Buffet]], Marc Antoine Calmon, [[Jules Cazot]], [[Jean Clamageran]] (president in 1858), Henry Didier, [[Albert Grévy]], [[Édouard René de Laboulaye]] and [[Ernest Picard]] (president in 1853).{{sfn|Mayeur|Corbin|Schweitz|1995|p=87}}
Other noted members included [[Philippe Paul, comte de Ségur|Philippe Paul de Ségur]] (1780–1873), [[James Mayer de Rothschild]] (1792–1868), [[Napoleon III]] (1808–73), [[Jules Ferry]] (1832–93), [[Georges Clemenceau]] (1841–1929), [[Pierre de Coubertin]] (1863–1937), [[André Citroën]] (1878–1935), [[Pierre Taittinger]] (1887–1965) and [[Guy Mollet]] (1905–75).{{sfn|Histoire: La Conférence}}

In 1846 there were 221 members. 
44 had left the society, so a total of 265 had been or were part of it.
Of 230 who gave their professions, 138 were advocates or magistrates, 30 in the Council of State, 16 in public office and 11 diplomats.{{sfn|Martin-Frugier|1989|p=236}}
Of the 265 members up to 1846, 59 became deputies.
30 served under one regime, 18 under two regimes and 9 under 3 regimes.
Werner de Merode and Charles-Pierre-Paul Paulmier were deputies under four regimes: the July Monarchy, French Second Republic, Second French Empire and French Third Republic.
Eight became ministers: [[Louis Buffet]], [[Charles de Morny, Duke of Morny|Charles de Morny]], [[Lionel de Moustier]], Auguste de Talhouët-Royt and [[Adolphe Vuitry]] under the Second Empire, [[Louis, duc Decazes|Louis Decazes]], Eugène de Goulard and [[Pierre Edmond Teisserenc de Bort]] under the Third Republic.
[[Jules Grévy]] was elected president of the Republic in 1879.{{sfn|Martin-Frugier|1989|p=237}}

'''Corruption in Iceland''' describes the prevention and occurrence of [[corruption]] in [[Iceland]].

== Extent ==
According to several sources, corruption is not common on a daily basis in [[Iceland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom in the World 2013|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2013/iceland-0|publisher=Freedom House|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Rights Report 2013- Iceland|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2012&amp;dlid=204295|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the global financial crisis and subsequent revelations have had a negative impact on the integrity and independence of Iceland's governing institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snapshot of the Iceland Country Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/iceland/snapshot.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transparency International's 2016 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 13th place out of 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016|title=Corruption Perception Index 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[GRECO]]'s evaluation report 2013, the [[Icelandic political system]] was weakened by potential [[nepotism]], close personal relationships between public officials and business and political patronage at the local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evaluation report 2013- Iceland|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/media/3939310/GrecoEval4-2012-8_Iceland_EN.pdf|publisher=GRECO &amp; the European Commission|accessdate=4 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214102338/http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/media/3939310/GrecoEval4-2012-8_Iceland_EN.pdf|archivedate=14 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, businesses do not consider corruption an obstacle for doing business in Iceland, according to [[World Economic Forum]] [[Global Competitiveness Report]] 2013-2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Competitiveness Report 2013-2014|url=http://www.weforum.org/|publisher=World Economic Forum|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, the slang term {{nihongo|''Dekichatta kekkon''|出来ちゃった結婚}}, or {{nihongo|''Dekikon''|デキコン}} for short, emerged in the late 1990s. The term can literally be translated as "oops-we-did-it-marriage," implying an [[unintended pregnancy]]. Notable celebrities with these marriages include [[Namie Amuro]], [[Yōko Oginome]], [[Hitomi (singer)|Hitomi Furuya]], [[Ami Suzuki]], [[Kaori Iida]], [[Nozomi Tsuji]], [[Anna Tsuchiya]], [[Meisa Kuroki]], [[Leah Dizon]], [[Melody (Japanese singer)|Melody Miyuki Ishikawa]], [[Riisa Naka]] and [[Rie Miyazawa]].&lt;ref&gt;Haruna Kashiwase, "Shotgun Weddings a Sign of the Times in Japan," ''Population Today'', July 2002, [http://www.prb.org/Articles/2002/ShotgunWeddingsaSignoftheTimesinJapan.aspx prb.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/5602308/Japan-embraces-shotgun-weddings.html "Japan embraces shotgun weddings"]. ''Telegraph''. 22 June 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20470">This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Madagascar]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

[[Madagascar]]'s population is predominantly of mixed [[Austronesian]] and [[East Africa]]n origin.

==Population==
[[Image:Madagascar-demography.png|thumb|300px|right|Demographics of Madagascar, Data of [[FAO]], year 2005; number of inhabitants in thousands.]]
[[Image:Madagascar popdens 2004.png|thumb|300px|Population density of Madagascar as of 2004]] 
The problem with population estimation in Madagascar is that data is very old and limited.  The last population census was carried out in 1993, after an initial 1975 census.  There was an attempt at a census in 2009, but this attempt ultimately failed due to political instability.  Therefore, the demographic situation is inferred but reliability of any estimates from any source has a large margin of error.
According to {{UN_Population|source}} the total population was {{UN_Population|Madagascar}} in {{UN_Population|Year}}, compared to only 4,084,000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 43.1%, 53.8% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 3.1% was 65 years or older

[[Image:Ethnic groups of Madagascar Map.png|thumb|200px|Distribution of Malagasy ethnic groups.]]
The island of [[Madagascar]] is predominantly populated by people broadly classified as belonging to the  [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] [[ethno-linguistic]] group. This group is further subdivided a number of ethnic groups, often into the standard eighteen.
In addition, communities of [[Indians in Madagascar|Indians]] and [[Arab]]s have long been established on the island and have assimilated into local communities to varying degrees, in some places having long since become identified "Malagasy" ethnic groups, and in others maintaining distinct identities and cultural separation. More recent arrivals include [[French people in Madagascar|Europeans]] and [[Chinese people in Madagascar|Chinese]] immigrants.

Madagascar was probably uninhabited prior to [[Austronesian]] settlement in the early centuries AD. Austronesian features are most predominant in the central highlands people, the [[Merina]] (3 million{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}{{year needed|date=December 2013}}) and the [[Betsileo]] (2 million{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}{{year needed|date=December 2013}}); the remaining 16 tribal groupings are coastal peoples who are predominantly of [[East Africa]]n origin, with various Malay, Arab, European and Indian admixtures. The largest coastal groups are the [[Betsimisaraka people|Betsimisaraka]] (1,500,000) and the [[Tsimihety]] and [[Sakalava]] (700,000 each). Malagasy society has long been polarized between the politically and economically advantaged highlanders of the central plateaux and the people along the coast. For example, in the 1970s there was widespread opposition among coastal ethnics against the policy of "Malagasization" which intended to phase out the use of the French language in public life in favour of a more prominent position for the [[Malagasy language]], whose orthography is based on the Merina dialect. [[Identity politics]] were also at the core of the brief civil unrest during 2002.

[[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indians]] in Madagascar descend mostly from traders who arrived in the newly independent nation looking for better opportunities. The majority of them came from the west coast of India known as [[Karan (caste)|Karana]] (Muslim) and [[Banians|Banian]] (Hindu). The majority speak [[Hindi]] or [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], although some other Indian dialects are also spoken. {{As of|2007|alt=Nowadays}} the younger generations speak at least three languages, including French, Gujarati and Malagasy. A large number of the Indians in Madagascar have a high level of education, particularly the younger generation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

A sizeable number of [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] also reside in [[Madagascar]], mostly of [[French people|French]] descent.

According to the US Department of State in 2011, 41% of Madagascans practice Christianity and 52% practice traditional religion,&lt;ref name=BGNote&gt;{{cite web |last = Bureau of African Affairs |title = Background Note: Madagascar |publisher = U.S. Department of State |date = 3 May 2011 |url = https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5460.htm |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/61Be3ZCkK |archivedate = 24 August 2011  |accessdate =24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which tends to emphasize links between the living and the ''razana'' (ancestors). But according to the [[Pew Research Center]] in 2010, only 4.5% of Madagascans practice folk religions and 85% are [[Christianity in Madagascar|Christian]], with practitioners of Protestantism outnumbering adherents to [[Roman Catholicism in Madagascar|Roman Catholicism]].&lt;ref name=pew/&gt;

Madagascar's traditional religions tend to emphasize links between the living and the dead. They believe that the dead join their ancestors in the ranks of divinity and that ancestors are intensely concerned with the fate of their living descendants. This spiritual communion is celebrated by the Merina and Betsileo reburial practice of [[famadihana]], or "turning over the dead". In this ritual, relatives' remains are removed from the family tomb, rewrapped in new silk shrouds, and returned to the tomb following festive ceremonies in their honor. In the festivities, they eat, drink, and literally dance with the dead. After one or two days of celebrating, they shower the body with gifts and rebury it.
   
Malagasy [[Christianity in Madagascar|Christians]] are mostly [[Protestant]] (mainly [[Church of Jesus Christ in Madagascar|Reformed Protestant Church of Jesus Christ in Madagascar (FJKM)]], [[Lutheran]], and [[Anglican]]) or [[Roman Catholic]], but there are also smaller groups such as members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons), [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Seventh-day Adventists]],&lt;ref name=DeptOfState2009a/&gt; and [[Eastern Orthodoxy in Madagascar|Eastern Orthodox Christians]]. Many [[syncretism|incorporate]] the cult of the dead with their other religious beliefs and bless their dead at church before proceeding with the traditional burial rites. They also may invite a pastor to attend a famadihana. A historical rivalry exists between the predominantly Catholic masses, considered to be underprivileged, and the predominantly Protestant Merina aristocrats, who tend to prevail in the civil service, business, and professions.
   
Followers of [[Islam]] constitute approximately 7% of the population, according to the US Department of State in 2011,&lt;ref name=BGNote/&gt; (down from their earlier estimate of 10 to 15% in 2009&lt;ref name=DeptOfState2009a/&gt;), or 3% according to the [[Pew Research Center]] in 2010.&lt;ref name=pew/&gt; They are mostly concentrated in the north, northwest, and southeast.&lt;ref name=DeptOfState2009a&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/127241.htm|title=Madagascar|publisher=US Department of State|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a small number of [[Hindus]].&lt;ref name=DeptOfState2009a/&gt;
   
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Madagascar|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has more than 8.000 members in 33 [[Ward (LDS Church)|congregations]] in Madagascar.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/facts-and-statistics/country/madagascar/ |title=Madagascar |department=Facts and Statistics |work=Newsroom |publisher=LDS Church |access-date=2013-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''East Brabantian''' ({{lang-nl|Oost Noord-Brabants or Oost Brabants}}) is one of the main divisions of the [[Brabantian]] dialect groups which the ''Woordenboek van de Brabantse Dialecten'' recognizes. East Brabantian dialects are mainly spoken in the eastern part of the province of [[North Brabant]]. In the classifications of Brabantian is recognized it as a separate dialect group. Sometimes it is called [[Meierij]]s, after the [[Meierij|Bailiwick]] of [[Den Bosch]].

East Brabant dialects are further subdivided into the [[Kempenland]]s (in a large area east and south east of [[Eindhoven]], including [[Arendonk]] and [[Lommel]] in [[Belgium]]), North [[Meierij]]s (in an area south of [['s-Hertogenbosch]] into [[Eindhoven]]), [[Meierij|Peelland]]s (in [[Helmond]] and surroundings), [[Geldrop]]s and [[Heeze-Leende|Heeze-and-Leende]]s. The last two are small local dialects that are found as separate groups in few other classifications.

Not to East Brabantian belong Maaslands (including [[Den Bosch|Bosch]] which is put among the Central North Brabantian, although other classification systems also describe it as East Brabantian), the [[Land-van-Cuijk]]s (which has many similarities with neighboring [[South Guelderish]] and the Northern [[Limburgish]] dialects), [[Cleverlands|Kleverland]]s (a [[South Guelderish]] dialect) and [[Budel]]s (linguistically a [[Limburgish]] dialect).&lt;ref&gt;Jos &amp; Cor Swanenberg: ''Taal in stad en land: Oost-Brabants'', {{ISBN|9012090105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pijltjesmethode.png|thumb|Dialect boundaries of the different East Brabantian Dialects, with [[Geldrop]]s and [[Heeze-Leende|Heeze-and-Leende]]s in the middle, [[Kempenland]]s on the left-bottom, North [[Meierij]]s on the top and [[Meierij|Peelland]]s at the right.]]

==Characteristics==
East Brabantian dialects differ on some points distinctively of the more western variants: Central Brabantian and West Brabantian and also from the southern dialects like [[Southern Brabantian]], [[Kempens]] and [[Southeast Limburgish dialect|Getelands]]. Some peculiarities are typical eastern and shared with the Limburgish dialects, others only occur locally.&lt;ref&gt;http://taal.phileon.nl/brabants.php&lt;/ref&gt;

East Brabantian dialects have been somewhat influenced by the [[Cologne]] language expansion of thus have a few characteristics that typically east of nature and which the western variants do not have. Such differences include [[Umlaut (linguistics)|umlaut]]s in [[diminutive]]s, and the [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] of [[Germanic strong verbs]] (like in [[Limburgish]]). Typical East Brabantian words are therefore ''geleuven'' vs Dutch ''geloven'' (believe), ''bruur'' vs Dutch ''broer'' (brother) and ''zuke'' vs Dutch ''zoeken'' (search). Also diminutives as ''menneke'' vs Dutch ''mannetje'' (little man) and ''jeske'' vs Dutch ''jasje'' (little coat) and conjugations as ''velt'' vs Dutch ''valt'' (falls) are typical East Brabantian.

* East Brabantian dialects know an [[Umlaut (linguistics)|umlaut]] in diminutive formation (''póp'' - ''pupke'') and some words which ends on ''-i'' in their previous West Germanic form, e.g.: ''kees'' (kaas), which original form was Kâsi.
* The variants ''wè'' and ''dè'' are used in East Brabantian for ''what'' and ''that'' (vs. the Western Brabantian uses ''wa'' and ''da'', and [[Limburgish]] ''de'').
* East Brabantian exhibit a more eastern tinged [[vocabulary]] ("rad" vs. "wiel").
* As in most other Brabantian dialects an umlaut occurs in words with originally a long ''ô'' (''gruun'' vs. [[Markiezaat]]s uses only ''groen'').
* Typical of the [[Meierij]] is the preservation of the ''sk'' where standard Dutch has shifted to the ''sch'' (''skoewn'' vs. ''Schoen'') and the shortening of many original long [[vowels]] (''torre'' vs. ''toren'').
* The [[diphthong]]s {{IPA|/ɛi/}} and {{IPA|/œy/}} are here often [[monophthong]]ed into {{IPA|[ɛː]}} and {{IPA|[œː]}} (''èès'' and ''hèùs'' vs. West Brabantian ''ais'' and ''ois'').
* Unlike in the West Brabantian dialects the ''h'' has been preserved in East Brabantian, the most common departing greet being ''houdoe'' (meaning "take care") (vs. the West Brabantian ''oudoe'').
* The [[svarabhakti]] vocal is almost always pronounced (''Mellek'' vs. ''Melk'').
* As all Brabantian dialects, East Brabantian uses a [[Hard and soft G in Dutch|soft ''G'']].

One classical breakdown of economic activity distinguishes [[Three-sector theory|three sectors]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.roiw.org/1987/359.pdf | title =The Primary, Secondary, Tertiary and Quaternary Sectors of  the Economy | author=Zoltan Kenessey | date= | work =| publisher =The Review of Income and Wealth | accessdate=20 April 2012 | quote=Regarding the terminology itself Clark informs that "the term tertiary industries was originated by Professor A. G. B. Fisher in New Zealand, and became widely known through the publication of his book, ''The Clash of  Progress and  Security'', in 1935. It took its origin from the titles current  in Australia and New Zealand of 'primary industry'  for agriculture, grazing, trapping, forestry, fishing and mining, and 'secondary industry' for manufacture. In Australia and New Zealand these terms are not only used in statistical reference books but are widely current in popular discussion. The phrase 'tertiary industries' therefore immediately carries, in these  countries, a suggestion of those excluded by the official definition of 'secondary industries."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Primary sector of the economy|Primary]]: involves the retrieval and production of raw materials, such as corn, coal, wood and iron. (A coal miner, farmer or fisherman would be workers in the primary sector.)
* [[Secondary sector of the economy|Secondary]]: involves the transformation of raw or intermediate materials into goods e.g. manufacturing steel into cars, or textiles into clothing. (A builder and a dressmaker would be workers in the secondary sector.)
* [[Tertiary sector of the economy|Tertiary]]: involves the supplying of services to consumers and businesses, such as baby-sitting, cinema and banking. (A shopkeeper and an accountant would be workers in the tertiary sector.)

In the 20th century, economists began to suggest that traditional tertiary services could be further distinguished from "[[Quaternary sector of the economy|quaternary]]" and [[Quinary sector of the economy|quinary]] service sectors. Economic activity in the hypothetical quaternary sector comprises information- and knowledge-based services, while quinary services include industry related to [[human services]] and [[Hospitality industry|hospitality]].&lt;ref&gt;

== Historic evolution ==
An economy may include several sectors (also called "[[industries]]") that evolved in successive phases:

* The [[Traditional economy|ancient economy]] built mainly on the basis of [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence farming]].
* The [[industrial revolution]] lessened the role of [[subsistence]] farming, converting land-use to more [[extensive farming|extensive]] and [[monoculture|monocultural]] forms of agriculture over the last three centuries. Economic growth took place mostly in the mining, construction and manufacturing industries. 
* In the economies of modern [[consumer society|consumer societies]], services, finance, and technology – the [[knowledge economy]] – play an increasingly significant role.

Even in modern times, [[developing countries]] tend to rely more on the first two sectors, in contrast to [[developed countries]].

==By ownership==
An economy can also be divided along different lines:

* [[Public sector]] or state sector
* [[Private sector]] or privately run businesses
* [[Voluntary sector]]

The '''Fake accounts case''' is a case being heard by the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] (SCP) under which former [[President of Pakistan]] [[Asif Ali Zardari]], his sisters [[Faryal Talpur]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1419043|title=SC calls Zardari, Faryal in ‘fake’ accounts case|first=Nasir|last=Iqbal|date=10 July 2018|website=dawn.com|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Azra Fazal Pechuho]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://capitaltv.pk/news/top-stories/two-new-companies-of-zardari-group-found-by-fia-in-fake-bank-accounts-case/|title=Two new companies of Zardari group found by FIA in Fake Bank Accounts case - Capital TV|author=|date=5 September 2018|website=capitaltv.pk|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zardari's aide Khawaja Anwar Majeed and his sons Khawaja Niymar Majeed, Khawaja Mustafa Majeed, Abdul Ghani Majeed, and Ali Kamal Majeed are accused of [[money laundering]] through 29 fake accounts registered in [[Summit Bank]], [[Sindh Bank]], and [[United Bank Limited]] under people's names who themselves were not aware of those accounts.&lt;ref name="tribune.com.pk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1781172/1-fia-arrests-anwar-majeed-son-fake-accounts-case/|title=Zardari’s close aide arrested in fake accounts case - The Express Tribune |author=|date=15 August 2018 |website= tribune.com.pk |accessdate= 7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1431454 |title= SC names JIT members for probe into ‘fake’ accounts case |author1= Iftikhar A. Khan |author2= Nasir Iqbal |date=7 September 2018 |website= Dawn.com |accessdate= 8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others being investigated are Sara Tareen Majeed, Khawaja Kamal Majeed, Khawaja Mustafa Zulqarnain Majeed, and Saima Ali Majeed.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Khawaja Anwar Majeed and Abdul Ghani Majeed are under arrest since 15 August 2018. They were arrested from inside Supreme Court of Pakistan building after they appeared to defend themselves in a "Rs35 billion fake accounts case".&lt;ref name="tribune.com.pk"/&gt;

==Background==
This case was initially opened against Hussain Lawai in 2015 who is a former chairman of [[Pakistan Stock Exchange]] and a close associate of Zardari.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Case facts==
During court proceedings on 6 September 2018, two more companies M/s Landmarks and National Gases (Pvt) Limited (M/s NGS) were revealed in addition to already identified companies which were used to launder billions of rupees. M/s Landmarks is owned by Zardari, Talpur, and Pechuho in a partnership. Both companies were discovered from the hard disks which were recovered when [[Federal Investigation Agency]] (FIA) raided Khoski Sugar Mills owned by Omni Group, a franchise headed by Majeed.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

M/s NGS is registered in the name of Muhammad Adil Khan. Its shares were being transferred to Sara Tareen Majeed and Khawaja Kamal Majeed since 2015, both of the Majeeds were able to gain the directorship of the company by 2018.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Joint Investigation Team==
The Supreme Court of Pakistan ordered creation of a joint investigation team (JIT) to investigate the charges against the accused on 6 September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1431098 |title=SC orders formation of JIT to probe 'mega corruption' fake accounts case |first= Haseeb |last=Bhatti |date=5 September 2018 |website= dawn.com |accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The JIT members are Imran Latif Minhas, Majid Hussain, Nauman Aslam, Muhammad Afzal, and Brigadier Shahid Pervaiz. The JIT is headed by Ahsan Sadiq who is an additional director general in FIA.&lt;ref name=auto1/&gt;

Minhas is a commissioner at the Regional Tax Office, Islamabad, Hussain is a joint director with the [[State Bank of Pakistan]], Aslam is a director with the [[National Accountability Bureau]], Afzal is a director with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan]], and Pervaiz is associated with [[Inter-Services Intelligence]], while contrary to the JIT for [[Panama Papers case]], there is no representation from [[Military Intelligence (Pakistan)|Military Intelligence]] in the JIT constituted for this case as of yet.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1431454|title=SC names JIT members for probe into ‘fake’ accounts case|first=Iftikhar|last=A. Khan | first2=Nasir|last2=Iqbal|date=7 September 2018|website=dawn.com|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The JIT will derive its powers from all existing laws regarding investigations and inquiries including Anti Corruption Laws, National Accountability Ordinance's Code of Criminal Procedure, and Federal Investigation Agency Act of 1974. JIT will have at their disposal all the executive agencies and authorities to assist it where needed to complete this investigation. [[Pakistan Rangers]] is tasked with providing security to the JIT members and witnesses.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The JIT's task is to uncover all who are involved in this matter and collect fool-proof evidence against them so they can be effectively prosecuted. To complete this task, JIT will have at their disposal to garner services of any expert. It will be mandatory for this investigative body to keep SCP apprised about their progress in ths investigation on "fortnightly basis".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

September 16 was designated by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] as the '''[[List of International observances#September|International Day]] for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer'''.  This designation had been made on December 19, 2000, in commemoration of the date, in 1987, on which nations signed the [[Montreal Protocol]] on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.

In 1994, the UN General Assembly proclaimed 16 September the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer, commemorating the date of the signing, in 1987, of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Deepshikha|first1=Singh|title=Ms|url=http://abclive.in/international-ozone-day-aims-reduce-hfcs/|accessdate=17 September 2016|agency=ABC Live|publisher=ABC Live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Italians in Egypt''', also referred to as '''Italian Egyptians''', are a community with a history that goes back to [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times. Perhaps the most famous Italian Egyptian is [[Dalida|Yolanda Christina Gigliotti]] known as [[Dalida]]. Diva, famous singer and actress.

==History==
[[Image:FilippoTommasoMarinetti.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], an Italian Egyptian born in Alexandria and founder of the international [[Futurism]] movement]]

The last Queen of ancient Egypt ([[Cleopatra]]) married the Roman [[Mark Antony]] bringing her country as "dowry", and since then Egypt was part of the [[Roman Empire]] for seven centuries. Many people from the Italian peninsula moved to live in Egypt during those centuries: the tombs of Christian [[Alexandria]] shows how deep was that presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wonderclub.com/WorldWonders/CatacombsHistory.html|title=Catacombs of Kom el Shaqafa|last=wonders|first=world|website=wonderclub.com|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then there has been a continuous presence of people (born in the Italian peninsula) and their descendants in Egypt.

===Origins of actual community===
During the [[Middle Ages]] Italian communities from the "Maritime Republics" of [[Italy]] (mainly [[Pisa]], [[Genova]] and [[Amalfi]]) were present in [[Egypt]] as merchants. Since the [[Renaissance]] the [[Republic of Venice]] has always been present in the history and commerce of Egypt: there was even a ''Venetian Quarter'' in [[Cairo]].

From the time of [[Napoleon I]], the Italian community in Alexandria and Egypt started to grow in a huge way: the size of the community had reached around 55,000 just before [[World War II]], forming the second largest immigrant community in Egypt.

===World War II===
The expansion of the colonial [[Italian Empire]] after [[World War I]] was directed toward Egypt by [[Benito Mussolini]], in order to control the [[Suez Canal]].&lt;ref&gt;Davide Rodogno. ''Fascism's European Empire'' p.243&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian "Duce" created in the 1930s some sections of the [[National Fascist Party]] in Alexandria and Cairo, and many hundreds of Italian Egyptians become members of it. Even some intellectuals, like [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] (founder of the [[Futurism]]) and the poet [[Giuseppe Ungaretti]], were supporters of the [[Italian nationalism]] in their native Alexandria.

As a consequence, during [[World War II]] the British authorities interned in concentration camps nearly 8,000 Italian Egyptians with sympathy for [[Italian fascism]], in order to prevent sabotage when the [[Italian Army]] attacked western Egypt in summer 1940.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anpie.info/online/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/gli-italiani-degitto-nella-seconda-guerra-mondiale.pdf Internment of the Italian Egyptians (in Italian)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225080508/http://www.anpie.info/online/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/gli-italiani-degitto-nella-seconda-guerra-mondiale.pdf |date=2009-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The areas of Egypt temporarily conquered by the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] in the war (like [[Sallum]] and [[Sidi Barrani]]) were administered by the military.

Indeed, the nationalist organization Misr Al-Fatah ([[Young Egypt Party (1933)|Young Egypt]]) was deeply influenced by the fascism ideals against the [[British Empire]]. The Young Egypt Party was ready to do a revolt in [[Cairo]] in summer 1942 if [[Rommel]] had conquered [[Alexandria]] after a victory at the [[El Alamein]] battle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.identitaeuropea.org/archivio/articoli/blondet_islamo.html] Nasser and Sadat, 1942 revolt (in Italian)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, like many other foreign communities in Egypt, migration back to Italy and the West reduced the size of the community greatly due to wartime internment and the rise of Nasserist nationalism against Westerners. After the war many members of the Italian community related to the defeated Italian expansion in Egypt were forced to move away, starting a process of reduction and disappearance of the Italian Egyptians.

After 1952 the Italian Egyptians were reduced - from the nearly 60,000 of 1940 - to just a few thousands. Most Italian Egyptians returned to Italy during the 1950s and 1960s, although a few Italians continue to live in Alexandria and Cairo. Officially the Italians in Egypt at the end of 2007 were 3,374 (1,980 families).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://infoaire.interno.it/statistiche2007/stat_aao_circ.html|title=I servizi demografici|website=Dipartimento per gli affari interni e territoriali|language=it-IT|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 there were nearly 4,000 Italians in Egypt, mostly technicians and managers working (for a few years) in the 500 Italian companies with contracts with the Egyptian government: just a few hundreds of retired "real" Italian Egyptians remain, mainly in Alexandria and Cairo.

==Egyptian–Italian relations==

Italy's preeminence in its economic relations with Egypt was reflected in the size of its expatriate community. Some of the first educational missions that Egypt sent to Europe under [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mohamed Ali]] were headed to Italy to learn the art of printing.

Mohamed Ali also engaged a number of Italian experts to assist in the various tasks of building the modern state: in the exploration of antiquities, the exploration of minerals, in the conquest of Sudan, designing the city of [[Khartoum]] and drawing the first survey map of the [[Nile Delta]].

In addition, Italians featured prominently in the royal court under Ismail, which is perhaps why Italian architects were chosen to design most of Khedive [[Isma'il of Egypt|Ismail]]'s palaces, new suburbs of the capital and public buildings.

The most famous building related to the Italian community was the Royal Opera House, which was to be inaugurated in 1871 with the ''[[Aida]]'' by the Italian composer [[Giuseppe Verdi]]. The [[Khedivial Opera House]] or "Cairo Royal Opera House" was the original Opera House in Cairo.  It was inaugurated on November 1869 and burned down on October 1971. The opera house was built on the orders of the [[Khedive]] [[Isma'il Pasha|Ismail]] to celebrate the opening of the [[Suez Canal]].  The Italian Egyptian architects [[Pietro Avoscani]] and [[Mario Rossi (architect)|Mario Rossi]] designed the building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cairoopera.org/history.aspx History and photos of the Khedivial Opera House]&lt;/ref&gt; Pietro Avoscani, before his 1891 death in Alexandria, created even the famous ''[[Corniche (Alexandria)|Corniche]]'' of Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aideinternational.com/memorie_foto/corniche.htm Photo of the Alexandria Corniche]&lt;/ref&gt;

The fondness of Egyptian monarchs towards Italy appeared in the number of Italians employed in their courts.

Italian-Egyptian relations were so strong and deemed so important that when the King of Italy [[Victor Emmanuel III]] abdicated in 1946 after Italy's defeat in [[World War II]], Egyptian King [[Faruk I of Egypt|Faruk]] invited Victor Emmanuel III to live in Alexandria. Victor Emmanuel III died in Alexandria in December 1947 and was buried there, behind the altar of St Catherine's Cathedral.

==Areas of origin and residence==
Before 1952, Italians formed the second largest expatriate community in Egypt, after the [[Greeks in Egypt|Greeks]]. The 1882 census of Egypt recorded 18,665 Italians in the country. By 1897 the figure rose to 24,454 and 30 years later to 52,462. Thus, the Italian community increased by 122 per cent in those years.

Writing in [[Al-Ahram]] of 19 February 1933, under the headline, "The Italians in Egypt", the Italian historian Angelo San Marco wrote, "The Venetians and the people from [[Trieste]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Genoa]], [[Pisa]], [[Livorno]], [[Naples]] and [[Sicily]] continued to reside in Egypt long after their native cities fell into decay and lost their status as maritime centres with the decline of the Mediterranean as a major thoroughfare for world trade."

Elsewhere in the article, San Marco writes that the Italian community in Egypt held monopolies on the goods that were still popular in the East, which included many imports. The majority of the Italian community lived in either Cairo or Alexandria, with 18,575 in the former and 24,280 in the latter, according to the 1928 census.&lt;ref&gt;Marta Petricioli. ''L'Egitto degli italiani (1917-1947)''. Milano, Bruno Mondadori, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Egyptian Museum - front view with wide angle lens.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The Museum of Antiquities of Cairo (the most important museum of ancient Egypt in the world) was built in 1901 by the Garozzo-Zaffarani, an Italian construction company]]

Italians tended to live in exclusively Italian neighbourhoods or in neighbourhoods with other foreigners. Perhaps the most famous of these districts in Cairo was known as the "Venetian Quarter". Nevertheless, San Marco notes that, in order to avoid harassment, the Italians tended to wear Egyptian dress and follow, as much as possible, Egyptian customs.

==Community organisations==
The Italian community in Egypt consisted primarily of a large array of merchants, artisans, professionals and an increasing number of workers. This was because Italy had remained for a long period of time politically and economically weak, which rendered it incapable of competing with the major industries and capitalist investment coming to Egypt from [[France]].

During the fascist period there were eight public and six Italian parochial schools. The government schools were supervised by an official committee chaired by the Italian consul and they had a total student enrollment of approximately 1,500. Other schools had student bodies numbering in the hundreds. Italians in Alexandria also had 22 philanthropic societies, among which were the "National Opera Society", the "Society for Disabled War Veterans", the "Society of Collectors of Military Insignia", the "Italian Club", the "Italian Federation for Labour Cooperation", the "War Orphans Relief Society", the "Mussolini Italian Hospital" and the "Dante Alighieri Italian Language Association". In addition, many [[Italian language|Italian]]-language newspapers were published in Alexandria, the most famous of which was ''L'Oriente'' and ''Il Messaggero Egiziano''.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Richard. ''Mussolini as Diplomat''. Fromm International Ed. London, 1999 {{ISBN|0-88064-244-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, the hundreds of [[Italian language|Italian words]] that have been incorporated into the [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian dialect]] is perhaps the best testimony to the fact that of all the foreign communities residing in Egypt, Italians were the most closely connected to Egyptian society.

San Marco ventures that the reason for this was that "our people are noted for their spirit of tolerance, their lack of religious or nationalist chauvinism and, unlike other peoples, their aversion to appearing superior."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/Archive/2003/670/chrncls.htm#1|title=Close to Italy|website=Al-Ahram Weekly On-Line}} Issue No. 670, 25-31 December, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language and religion==

==Early life and education==
James J. Rosemond was born in 1965, in [[Harlem, New York|Harlem]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and grew up in [[East Flatbush]], [[Brooklyn]], New York, in an apartment complex called Vanderveer Gardens. His parents migrated from [[Haiti]] in the 1960s. They divorced when he was young, leaving his mother to raise five children alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/05/tupac_shakur_chuck_philips_los_angeles_times.php |title=Tupac Shakur, the Los Angeles Times, and Why I'm Still Unemployed: A Personal History by Chuck Philips |accessdate=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entertainment career==
Rosemond and several friends founded the music conference "How Can I Be Down" in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exclusive- Jimmy Henchman answers rumors accusations|url=http://www.dondivamag.com/exclusive-jimmy-henchman-answers-rumors-accusations/|work=dondivamag.com|publisher=Don Diva Magazine|accessdate=January 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Exactly is Jimmy Henchman?|url=http://theurbandaily.com/2012/06/26/who-is-jimmy-henchman/|work=TheUrbanDaily.Com|accessdate=January 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Rosemond negotiated the [[Lennox Lewis vs. Mike Tyson]] boxing match. It was the first time that a boxer demanded that after a million buys on [[pay-per-view]], the boxers would split the purse 50–50 with [[Showtime Networks]]/[[HBO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James Rosemond, Jr. Signs Lantana To Management Deal|url=http://www.hiphopweekly.com/james-rosemond-jr-signs-lantana-to-management-deal/|publisher=Weekly Hip Hop|accessdate=January 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James "Jimmy Henchman" Rosemond Sentenced to Life in Federal Prison|url=http://defend.ht/politics/articles/judicial/5153-james-jimmy-henchman-rosemond-sentenced-to-life-in-federal-prison|accessdate=January 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Rosemond, along with the artist he managed,{{who|date=April 2018}} joined [[Russell Simmons]] in his campaign to end New York's draconian [[Rockefeller Drug Laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JAILED JIMMY HENCHMAN &amp; RUSSELL SIMMONS RELEASE STATEMENTS ON CHRIS LIGHTY|url=http://www.sohh.com/jailed-jimmy-henchman-russell-simmons-release-statements-on-chris-lighty/|work=sohh.com|accessdate=January 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charged as lobbyists, Simmons and Chavis fight back|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/10602629/charged-as-lobbyists-simmons-chavis-fight-back|publisher=EBSCO HOST Connection|accessdate=January 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosemond along with Shakim Compere and [[Mona Scott]], executive produced [[BET]]'s ''SOS Saving Ourselves: Help for Haiti'', a [[telethon]] held at [[Miami]]'s [[American Airlines Arena]] on February 5, 2010, to raise money for the devastated victims of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] that killed over 100,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wyclef jean shot in haiti|url=http://necolebitchie.com/2011/03/wyclef-jean-shot-in-haiti/|work=necolebitchie.com|accessdate=January 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the settlement, a charity was created with funds going to support Martin and his children.&lt;ref name="Billboard2006"&gt;{{cite book|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DxYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA8|accessdate=January 28, 2014|date=April 1, 2006|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=8–|chapter=Latest News from the Biz: 50 Cent Settles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal charges and conviction==
===Drug trafficking, money laundering and witness tampering convictions===
In June 2010, he was arrested on charges of cocaine trafficking, money laundering, and witness tampering. Rosemond went on trial in May 2012, represented by [[Gerald Shargel]].&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|first=Nate|last=Schweeber|title=Drug Trial Starts for Figure Prominent in Rap World|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/15/nyregion/james-rosemond-begins-trial-on-drug-charges.html|accessdate=September 8, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 14, 2012|quote=Prosecutors say James Rosemond is a drug kingpin, and he went on trial Monday in federal court in Brooklyn on charges that he led a criminal enterprise that sold millions of dollars [sic] worth of cocaine, laundered money and tampered with witnesses.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 5, 2012, Rosemond was convicted in [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York|Federal District Court]] in Brooklyn of drug trafficking, obstruction of justice, firearms violations and other financial crimes associated with his position as head of a multi-million-dollar transnational cocaine-selling organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schwirtz|first=Michael|title=Rap Music Figure Convicted of Running Multimillion-Dollar Cocaine Ring|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/nyregion/james-rosemond-convicted-of-running-multimillion-dollar-drug-ring.html?_r=1&amp;src=twrhp|work=N.Y./Region|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=June 5, 2012|date=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At trial, it was alleged that Rosemond led the large scale, bi-coastal narcotics-trafficking organization that transported cocaine from [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] to the [[New York metropolitan area]]. The group, known as the "Rosemond Organization," in turn shipped cash proceeds from the narcotics sales back to Los Angeles using a variety of methods as part of its operation. Millions of dollars in cash and narcotics were sent through [[Federal Express]] and [[United Parcel Service]], often covered in [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]] to avoid discovery by [[detection dog]]s.&lt;ref name="justice.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/nye/pr/2013/2013oct25.html |title=USDOJ: US Attorney's Office - Eastern District of New York |publisher=Justice.gov |date= |accessdate=February 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the indictment, prosecutors noted that Rosemond made over $11 million a year since 2007 through his drug trafficking scheme.&lt;ref name="NY times 1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Nate|first=Schweeber|title=Drug Trial Starts for Figure Prominent in Rap World|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/15/nyregion/james-rosemond-begins-trial-on-drug-charges.html|accessdate=September 8, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 25, 2013, Rosemond was sentenced to life imprisonment.&lt;ref name="newsday1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=samaha/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/26/nyregion/hip-hop-mogul-gets-life-sentence-for-drug-ring.html|title=Hip-Hop Figure Gets Life Sentence for Drug Ring|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=October 27, 2013|first=Mosi|last=Secret|date=October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of his sentence, Rosemond forfeited approximately $14 million in cash and property.&lt;ref name="justice.gov"/&gt; [[United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York]] [[Loretta E.

On March 10, 2016, Rosemond filed a [[habeas corpus]] appeal seeking a new trial along with a complaint to the U.S. Justice Department [[Office of Professional Responsibility]] against former U.S. Attorney [[Todd Kaminsky]] citing actions taken with regard to securing testimony from the government's lead witness [[Henry "Black" Butler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Rosemond is profiled in the 2016 documentary series ''[[Unjust Justice: The Jimmy Rosemond Tapes]]'', an investigative look into his life and criminal cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Case Of James "Jimmy Henchman" Rosemond To Be Examined In New Web Series ‘Unjust Justice’ | url = http://allhiphop.com/2016/01/21/james-jimmy-henchman-rosemond-web-series-unjust-justice-go-to-ground-podcast-2pac/ | website = Allhiphop.com  | date = January 21, 2016 | access-date = April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henchman was mentioned by name by [[Tupac Shakur]] in his song "Against All Odds" on his album ''[[The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory]]'', on which Shakur raps "promise to payback Jimmy Henchman in due time." Tupac believed that Henchman was involved in setting up the shooting and robbery of Shakur at the Quad Recording Studios in New York in November 1994. In 2012, a man named Dexter Isaac, serving a life sentence for unrelated crimes, claimed that he attacked Shakur that night and that the robbery was indeed orchestrated by Rosemond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Case Of James "Jimmy Henchman" Rosemond To Be Examined In New Web Series ‘Unjust Justice’ | url = http://www.historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/all-eyez-on-me/ | website = Historyhollywood.com  | date = NA| accessdate = March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American rapper [[Rick Ross]] acknowledges Rosemond as a mentor in his song "Ghostwriter" from the album ''[[Black Market (Rick Ross album)|Black Market]]'': "Remember receiving words of wisdom from Jimmy Henchman I lit a blunt in his honor when he received his sentence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Rick Ross - Ghostwriter lyrics | url = https://genius.com/Rick-ross-ghostwriter-lyrics | website = Genius.com | access-date = April 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Japanese people in Pakistan''' ({{lang-ur|جاپانی}}) form a small expatriate community, as well with people born in [[Pakistan]] with [[Japanese people|Japanese]] ancestry. {{Asof|2013}}, 917 [[Japan]]ese lived in the country, according to the statistics of Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/area/pakistan/data.html|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs|publication-place=Tokyo, Japan|date=July 2009|chapter=パキスタン・イスラム共和国基礎データ|title=各国・地域情勢|accessdate=2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, statistics from [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Pakistan)|Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] show that roughly 20,000 Japanese tourists entered the country during 2007-08, primarily to visit [[Taxila|Buddhist sites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thetourist.pk/13-places-explore-pakistan-2018|title=13 places to explore in 2018 - Pakistan - The Tourist|date=2017-12-28|work=The Tourist|access-date=2018-01-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s and 1990s, the population of Japanese living in Karachi alone exceeded over 2,000. Now, the community has shrunk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhalahore.net/new/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=434:karachi-enclave-for-japanese-investors-at-port-qasim&amp;catid=1:latest-news&amp;Itemid=142 Karachi: Enclave for Japanese investors at Port Qasim]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
There are [[Nihonjin gakkō|expatriate Japanese school]]s in [[Karachi]] and [[Islamabad]] for the native speakers of Japanese and children of Japanese citizens: [[Islamabad Japanese School]] and [[Karachi Japanese School]]. These schools are accredited by [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|Japan's Ministry of Education and Science]] and receive funding from the Japanese government.

'''Japanese settlement''' in what now constitutes modern-day [[Federated States of Micronesia]] (FSM){{refn|The Federated States of Micronesia only came into existence in 1979, and achieved independence in 1986. This article will cover the context of Japanese settlement in the states of Yap, Chuuk, Pohnpei and Kosrae, which constitutes the modern-day country of the Federated States of Micronesia. At least one source by Peattie refers to Yap and Chuuk in the central region of the [[Caroline Islands]], while Pohnpei and Kosrae were classified as the Eastern Carolines.&lt;ref name="Peattie158"&gt;Peattie (1988), p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;|group=fn}} dates back to the end of the 19th century, when Japanese traders and explorers settled on the central and eastern Carolines, although earlier contacts can not be completely excluded. After the islands were occupied by Japan in 1914, a large-scale Japanese immigration to them took place in the 1920s and 1930s. The Japanese government encouraged immigration to the islands belonging to the [[South Pacific Mandate]] to offset demographic and economic problems facing Japan at that time.

The earliest immigrants worked as traders, although most of the later settlers worked as fishermen, farmers or conscript labourers.&lt;ref&gt;Myers (1987), p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of immigrants settled in [[Pohnpei]] and [[Chuuk State|Chuuk]], while other islands were home for only a few Japanese. The total Japanese population reached about 100,000 by 1945. The Japanese immigrants in the central and eastern Carolines were [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[Ryukyuan people|Okinawans]], and a few [[Koreans in Micronesia|Koreans]].&lt;ref name="Chuuk1989"/&gt; The settlers brought [[Shinto]] and [[Buddhism]] religions to the islands, although they were not popular with indigenous people. By 1945 the Japanese language replaced Micronesian languages in day-to-day communications.

Ethnic relations between the Japanese settlers and civil officers with the Micronesians were initially coordial and intermarriage was encouraged between the Japanese and Micronesians, although relations soured as the Japanese administration implemented policies that favoured the Japanese populace and were insensitive to Micronesian cultural norms. After the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] in 1945, virtually all Japanese were repatriated back to Japan. People of mixed Japanese and Micronesian descent were allowed to remain, which most of them chose to do. Many of them assumed leading roles in the political, public and business sectors after [[World War II]], and constitute a large minority within FSM itself.&lt;ref name="Peattie317"&gt;Peattie (1988), p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; Micronesia began to engage with Japan again in the business and cultural spheres from the 1970s, and established formal diplomatic ties in 1988, two years after Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) became an independent country.

==History==

===Early contacts===

The first recorded contact between the Japanese and Pacific Islanders (believed to be Micronesians) was reflected in the ''Kokon Chomon Jyu'',{{refn|A Japanese historical chronicle.|group=fn}} when eight men arrived at Okinoshima (an ancient town in modern-day [[Izu Province]]) in July 1171. They were described to be tall, having dark-brown and tattooed skin, wearing ornaments as well as having coarse hair. The Japanese served them some millet and sake. When the eight men attempted to take the bows and spears, a fight ensued between the Japanese and the eight men, before the latter left Okinoshima.&lt;ref&gt;Crocombe (2007), p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese contact was also suggested by some anthropologists in the 19th century, and at least one, James McKinney Alexander suggested that Micronesians may have intermarried with Japanese fishermen who were strayed off course and stranded in the islands. In an 1895 study, Alexander noted similarities between the cultural traditions, vocabulary and the pre-Christian beliefs between [[Pohnpei]]an and [[Kosrae]]ans.&lt;ref name="Price136"&gt;Price (1936), p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Studies done by other Japanese anthropologists in the 19th and 20th centuries noted that at least 60 Japanese vessels drifted into the Pacific Ocean between the 17th and 19th centuries and could have made windfalls in the Pacific Islands.{{refn|One Japanese anthropologist, Yosihiko Sinoto, supports this possibility. In an interview around 2005, Yosihiko believed that castaway Japanese vessels could have made windfalls in the Pacific and the American continent in the course of Japan's 5,000-year history. In the 1971–72, archaeologist Jose Garanger discovered [[potsherds]] believed to be of [[Jōmon]] origin on [[Efate]] island in Vanuatu.&lt;ref&gt;Crocombe (2007), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;|group=fn}}

A Japanese [[corvette]], ''Ryujo'' under the command of [[Enomoto Takeaki]] stopped by Pohnpei and Kosrae between 1882 and 1883. The entire tenth class of the [[Imperial Japanese Naval Academy|Japanese naval academy]] was aboard the ship, and was noted as the first Japanese warship to stop by Micronesian waters.&lt;ref&gt;Peattie (1988), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The king of Kosrae accorded the Japanese crew a warm welcome, and personally claimed that the Kosraeans had some Japanese ancestry.&lt;ref name="Price136"/&gt; Some years later, a Japanese cattle farmer, Shinroku Mizutani from the [[Bonin Islands]] visited Pohnpei in 1887 and 1889. In both visits, Mizutani stayed for a few days in the islands before he was chased out by the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Crocombe (2007), p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late Spanish and German colonial eras (1890–1914)===

In 1890, two Japanese businessmen, Ukichi Taguchi and Tsunenori Suzuki, formed the ''Nanto Shokai'' (South Seas Trading Company) with the aim of developing Japanese commercial interests in Micronesia. They bought a sailing ship, ''Tenyu Maru'' and sailed for [[Yap]] in June and befriended a shipwrecked [[Irish American]] missionary, Daniel O'Keefe, but set sail for Pohnpei after two days. They set up a small store peddling Japanese wares under strict conditions imposed by the Spanish, and returned to Japan in December because of dwindling funds. The ship was later sold to the Ichiya company which established two trading stations at Chuuk and Pohnpei. More Japanese businessmen arrived in Chuuk in 1892 under the charge of Mizutani and established a store at Chuuk in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Crocombe (2007), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; A few Japanese, notably [[Koben Mori]], began socialising with the Chuukese and led semi-nomadic lifestyles until 1896 before gaining the protection of Spanish guards. Mori lived with a few Japanese compatriots, and became the resident agent for ''Hiki Shokai'', another Japanese trading company that came to set up a shop at [[Weno|Moen]].&lt;ref name="Peattie29"&gt;Peattie (1988), p. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese businessmen that were based at Moen were repatriated from Micronesia in 1900, a year after Spain ceded its sovereignty to Germany as part of the [[German–Spanish Treaty (1899)|German–Spanish Treaty]] of 1899. Only Mori and another Japanese business agent remained behind in Chuuk and Pohnpei, respectively.&lt;ref name="Hezel103"&gt;Hezel (2003), p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of German annexation, Mori was serving as the resident agent for a German trading company at that time. Mori lived in isolation until 1907 when the German authorities allowed Japanese trade in Chuuk, and another trading company–''Murayama Shokai'' established a trading post in [[Tol (island)|Tol]]. Japanese settlers also started to come in small numbers to Chuuk to engage in farming or fishing activities.&lt;ref&gt;Peattie (1988), p. 30–33&lt;/ref&gt; The German colonial administration granted the Japanese settlers equal rights with other European settlers in German-mandated territories, considering them citizens of an imperialist power. In official statistics the Japanese were legally classified as "White".&lt;ref&gt;Rainbird (2004), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese colonial era (1914–1945)===
The First World War saw many nations leap to take Germany's overseas possessions for themselves, and Micronesia was no exception. A Japanese warship sailed into [[Truk Lagoon]] in October 1914; it was greeted by Japanese settlers living on the nearby islands.&lt;ref&gt;Peattie (1988), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; The navy set up its regional headquarters at Chuuk and stationed a garrison at Pohnpei until 1922, where the region's administrative capital [[Kolonia]] was established under the [[South Pacific Mandate]]. When a civilian government was established in March 1922, there were about 150 Japanese living in Pohnpei, which consisted of traders and government officials. Another seventy Japanese immigrated to Pohnpei by 1930, and a few individuals settled in neighbouring Chuuk, Kosrae and Yap.&lt;ref&gt;Peattie (1988), p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; In Chuuk, another hundred Japanese businessmen settled at Toloas by the late 1920s to cater to governmental and business interests. A few elementary schools were set up to serve both the local Japanese and Chuukese populace.{{refn|Of particular note was Koben Mori's influence on Chuuk's affairs in the 1920s. He was hired as a civilian affairs adviser by the military in 1916, and had a copra plantation and business interests in Chuuk by the 1920s. Mori was respected by both Japanese and the Chuukese alike and was elected as a communal chief by the Chuukese in the late 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Peattie (1988), p. 195–6&lt;/ref&gt;|group=fn}}&lt;ref name="Crocombe 2007, p. 186"&gt;Crocombe (2007), p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the settlers who came before 1930 consisted of [[Ryukyuan people|Okinawa]]ns. A tuna canning factory was set up at Pohnpei in 1930, and Japanese settlers from the [[Tōhoku region]] and [[Hokkaido]] came in greater numbers after that. Some of them became fishermen, while others organised farming communes. The civilian government persuaded twenty-four families to establish a farming commune at [[Palikir]] in 1931, but the settlers faced problems adapting to the tropical climate and bringing their vegetable produce to Kolonia for sale. The civilian government moved in to quickly improve the transport network and electrical supplies throughout Pohnpei. In addition, they granted larger tracts of land to the settlers, and as a result the settlers went into rice cultivation. More settlers followed suit, and an anthropologist, Umesao Tadao reported that the farming settlement in Pohnpei was well established by 1941.&lt;ref name="Peattie 1988, p. 316"&gt;Peattie (1988), p. 316&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese populace at the other islands grew at a slower rate—although less so for [[Chuuk State|Chuuk]], and Japanese tend to prefer settling in low-lying areas like [[Tomil]] and [[Tol (island)|Tol]]. Road and electrical infrastructure were built in new towns and hamlets, which were founded or expanded by Japanese settlers.&lt;ref&gt;Peattie (1988), p. 177, 180&lt;/ref&gt; Many towns and hamlets had at least a thousand Japanese inhabitants by 1941. Some conscript and contract labourers from mainland Japan, [[Okinawa]] and [[Korea]] hired to build naval facilities at Chuuk and Pohnpei contributed to the increasing immigrant population in the central and eastern Carolines.&lt;ref&gt;Poyer et al. (2001), p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Kolonia and [[Palikir]] had the largest Japanese populace after the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]] and [[Palau]], and the Japanese outnumbered the natives by a thin margin in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council (U.S.). Pacific Science Board (1950), p. 433&lt;/ref&gt; Kosrae was populated by no more than a few hundred Japanese throughout the colonial era; a few Japanese policemen were stationed on the island to keep law and order. Japanese and Korean labourers briefly stayed on the island to carry out [[phosphate mining]] operations and establish a cotton plantation, but were repatriated back after the plantation failed.&lt;ref name="Hezel 2003, p. 177"&gt;Hezel (2003), p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

Intermarriage between Japanese men and Micronesian women were encouraged, especially in Pohnpei and Chuuk where there are large Japanese populations. The number of intermarriages between the Japanese and Micronesians were the highest among Okinawan fishermen in the 1930s, many of whom were single men.&lt;ref&gt;Hezel (2003), p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; A sizable community of mixed Japanese–Micronesians by the 1930s, and children of legitimate unions were conscripted into the Japanese military forces. Micronesians and Japanese–Micronesians came under the suspicion of the [[Kempeitai]] for sympathies with the Americans, and many reportedly faced harassment as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Poyer et al. (2001), p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; Micronesian islands reverted to military administration in 1943, and the regional headquarters was relocated from Palau to Chuuk.&lt;ref&gt;Myers et al. (1987), p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; As food supplies ran scarce during the later months of the Second World War, the Japanese military began stealing breadfruit and food supplies from Micronesian farms. The Japanese military avoided Japanese and Japanese–Micronesian families, especially those that wielded political influence within the local community.&lt;ref&gt;Poyer et al. (2001), p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; In Chuuk, land was also confiscated from Micronesians and Japanese–Micronesians to facilitate the construction of new military facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Poyer et al. (2001), p. 82–3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent years (1945–present)===

The Japanese settlers in the central and eastern Carolines were repatriated after the Japanese surrender. The civilians were repatriated first, while the soldiers stayed on as [[Prisoners of war]] to carry out repair works to the islands' infrastructure until 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Peattie (1988), p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; Most people of mixed Japanese–Micronesian descent stayed behind and were brought up by their mothers, although a few chose to return to Japan with their fathers. The American military government permitted some thirty-three{{refn|This figure encompasses all Micronesian territories under the former [[South Pacific Mandate]].|group=fn}} Japanese and Korean settlers to remain with their families, but this was allowed only under exceptional circumstances.&lt;ref name="Peattie 1988, p. 316"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Poyer et al. (2001), p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; Within the first few years after the war, some former Japanese settlers formed philanthropic organisations to promote public understanding and memory of Japan's colonial legacy in Micronesia. These organisations arranged visitation trips for the former settlers to the Carolines, usually with the purpose of maintaining kinship ties with their Japanese–Micronesian descendants.&lt;ref&gt;Peattie (1988), p. 315&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese–Micronesians assumed leading positions in the public and private sector, particularly in Chuuk where there is a substantial percentage of Micronesians with Japanese ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Peattie (1988), p. 316–7&lt;/ref&gt; Micronesia began to engage with Japan in the business and cultural spheres from the 1970s,{{refn|During a student exchange programme between Japan and Micronesia in 1979, then-Crown Prince [[Akihito]] noted that there were a sizable minority of Micronesian students with Japanese surnames. The Crown Prince interviewed a Chuukese student among the group, who revealed that he attributed his Japanese ancestry to his paternal grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;{{ja icon}} [http://www.jaipas.or.jp/123/123_1.htm 天皇陛下とミクロネシア], Izumi Kobayashi, Japan Institute for Pacific Studies, retrieved October 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;|group=fn}} and established formal diplomatic ties in 1988, two years after [[Federated States of Micronesia]] (FSM) became an independent country. In turn, Japan is one of the key aid providers to Micronesia.

A 1998 census conducted by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Japanese foreign affairs ministry]] showed 141 Japanese nationals residing in the FSM,&lt;ref name="MFAJapan"&gt;[http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/asia-paci/micronesia/index.html MOFA: Japanese–Micronesian Relations], Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Japan, retrieved September 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; the majority whom of are expatriate businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;Pacific Magazine Corp (1985), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2007 census counted a 114 Japanese nationals in the FSM.&lt;ref name="ODAJapan"/&gt; The Spanish counted fifteen Japanese traders based in Chuuk in 1895, after American missionaries reported the Japanese involvement in smuggling weapons and liquor.&lt;ref&gt;Hezel (2003), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; An 1899 census counted a total of 30 Japanese nationals, mainly businessmen living in the [[Caroline Islands]], with the majority being located on Pohnpei, Chuuk and Palau.&lt;ref&gt;Hezel (2003), p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; The German authorities chased out most of the businessmen in 1900, leaving only a few Japanese in the Micronesian islands. A few Japanese began settling in the islands in 1907 after the German authorities allowed the Japanese traders to establish their enterprises in Pohnpei and Chuuk. Early Japanese settlers consisted of single men, and official statistics showed a gender imbalance with five Japanese males to one female.&lt;ref name="Peattie160"&gt;Peattie (1988), p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Many Japanese men took on Micronesian wives and raised mixed Japanese–Micronesian families.&lt;ref name="Byron28"/&gt;

Japanese arrivals to Micronesia remained modest until the 1920s, following which the islands experienced a quick increase in the number of immigrants, especially in [[Pohnpei]]. Immigrants consisted largely of single men in the 1920s, the majority of whom were Okinawan fishermen.&lt;ref name="Peattie158"/&gt; The influx of Japanese immigrants to the central and eastern Carolines was not as intense as compared to the Marianas and [[Japanese settlement in Palau]] until the early 1930s, and constituted a little more than 10 percent{{refn|Both Okinawans and Koreans are also classified as "Japanese" all official census pertaining to the South Pacific Mandate.&lt;ref name="Peattie220"&gt;Peattie (1988), p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;|group=fn}} of the total Japanese populace through Micronesia in 1939.&lt;ref name="Peattie158"/&gt; In urban areas, Japanese settlers outnumbered Micronesians around the late 1930s.&lt;ref name="Peattie155"&gt;Peattie (1988), p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Many Japanese families migrated to the central and eastern Carolines in the 1930s, and by 1935 there were three Japanese males to two females in the islands.&lt;ref name="Peattie160"/&gt; More Japanese were brought to the Central and Eastern Carolines during the Second World War, and the Japanese populace outnumbered the native Micronesians in many islands immediately after the Japanese surrender in 1945.&lt;ref name="Chuuk1989"/&gt; The majority of Japanese who were brought to the central and eastern Caroline islands consisted of labourers as well as military personnel, and soon outnumbered both Japanese and Micronesian civilians alike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2068/2/02whole.pdf War graves, munition dumps and pleasure grounds: A post-colonial perspective of Chuuk Lagoon's submerged World War II sites] William Jeffrey, December 2007, James Cook University&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese population were repatriated back to Japan after the war, but most people of mixed Japanese–Micronesian remained in the islands and constituted a substantial percentage in the islands' population. They became assimilated with the Micronesians,&lt;ref&gt;Crocombe (2007), p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; and in all official census they are identified by their Micronesian heritage.&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook"&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/fm.html Federated States of Micronesia], CIA World Factbook, retrieved October 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the director of Japan's Institute for Pacific Studies Izumi Kobayashi estimated that at least 23% of FSM's population was of Japanese ancestry.&lt;ref name="Crocombe 2007, p. 186"/&gt; An official estimate in 2006 puts the number a little below 20%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mra.fm/pdfs/nr_los_FromFSMAmbassador.pdf Letter to Steven K. Baker, Micronesian Registration Advisors Inc.], by Kasio E. Mida, from the Embassy of the Federated States of Micronesia, February 24, 2006 (retrieved October 2, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==

Japanese settlers were generally followers of [[Shinto]] and [[Buddhism]]. In the central and eastern Carolines, religious activities were less widely publicised than in the Marianas or Palau. In towns with a sizeable Japanese populace, the civilian government would fund the construction of at least one public shrine in each town, and in smaller Japanese settlements, community leaders would direct the construction of a small shrine for communal purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Peattie (1988), p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; Two Buddhist temples were also constructed during the Japanese colonial era, one at Dublon in Pohnpei and another in Chuuk.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (1946), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian missionary activities—particularly [[Protestant]]—were more commonly seen in the central and eastern Carolines than in the other mandated islands. Four [[Congregationalist]] missionaries were sent to the Chuuk and Pohnpei in 1920 and received partial funding from the government.&lt;ref&gt;Peattie (1988), p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Although Christian missionary activities were intended to cater to the spiritual needs of Micronesians, a few Japanese settlers and government officials also patronised the missionaries. Missionary and church services were suppressed in the late 1930s, but the continued presence of Japanese Christians prompted the civilian government to permit private church services until the Japanese surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Poyer et al. (2001), p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; After the Japanese settlers were repatriated, the Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples were either abandoned or demolished. People of mixed Japanese–Micronesian heritage adopted Christianity in favour of Shinto and Buddhism.&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shuster (1981), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==

Early Japanese settlers taught their children to speak [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. Some, like traders and settlers with Micronesian wives, learned to speak some Micronesian languages.&lt;ref name="Peattie29"/&gt; Japanese replaced the Micronesian languages as the [[lingua franca]] for day-to-day communication and administrative purposes for both Japanese and Micronesians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ir.library.osaka-u.ac.jp/metadb/up/LIBKIYOK01/KJ00004305114.pdf The formation of Micronesian Japanese: Teaching Japanese at Public Schools in Nan'yogunto], Kikuko Yui, Osaka University Knowledge Archive, retrieved October 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, regular use of Japanese was discouraged when Micronesia came under [[United Nations]] trusteeship, and people of mixed Japanese–Micronesian heritage switched to English and various Micronesian languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pacificweb.org/PDF/FSM/sexageprofile.pdf Historical Census Data (p. 5–6/13)] FSM Statistical Activities, Pacificweb.org (retrieved October 10, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Japan's economic influence has led cultural organisations to promote learning Japanese among FSM citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.micronesia.emb-japan.go.jp/articles/080902_e.html Establishment of FSM-Japan Friendship Society] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127085816/http://www.micronesia.emb-japan.go.jp/articles/080902_e.html# |date=2011-01-27 }} Embassy of Japan in the Federated States of Micronesia, May 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Elementary Japanese had been offered as a foreign language in some schools, notably in the [[College of Micronesia-FSM]].&lt;ref name="Crocombe402"&gt;Crocombe (2007), p. 402&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==

A few Japanese trading companies established businesses at Chuuk and Pohnpei in the 1890s, and Koben Mori acted as its resident agent, helping to facilitate trade with the islanders. The early Japanese businessmen traded on alcoholic products, explosives and Chinaware.&lt;ref name="Hezel103"/&gt; Contraband products like alcohol and weapons were also illegally traded, and the Spanish administration made futile attempts to suppress these activities.&lt;ref&gt;Hezel (2003), p. 80–1&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese traders were expelled from Chuuk and Pohnpei in 1900 when the Germans purchased the islands from Spain, but Japanese traders returned to Chuuk in 1907 and set up a trading firm dealing with copra production.&lt;ref&gt;Hezel (2003), p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; After the Japanese annexed Micronesia from Germany in 1914, they gained a monopoly over the shipping routes in all of the mandated islands.&lt;ref&gt;Crocombe (2007), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of copra production reached twelve thousand tons per year by the 1920s, and had an export value of two million yen.&lt;ref&gt;Hezel (2003), p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1920s, an Okinawan fisherman, Tamashiro established a [[tuna]] production factory at [[Wonei]]. The Japanese government provided incentives for fishermen to open new fishery production factories, and in 1937 there were at least 1500 Okinawans and Japanese who were employed in the fishery industry.&lt;ref&gt;Hezel (2003), p. 186–7&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese settlers introduced commercial agriculture in Pohnpei and to a smaller extent in Chuuk and Yap. A few Japanese businessmen also set up firms to oversee the plantation of cash crops, including [[copra]], [[rice]] and pineapples. They constituted the main exports in the central and eastern Carolines.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver (1989), p. 241–2&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Japanese surrender in 1945, the Allied occupation authorities scrapped all organisations pertaining to overseas trade, banking, finance and colonisation, and effectively led to an end of Japanese influence in Micronesia.&lt;ref name="Peattie317"/&gt; Trade restrictions were then enforced between Japan and Micronesia in the first two decades after the war, but were gradually removed between 1973 and 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsmcongress.fm/15th%20CFSM%20News/CFSM%20News%2031-08.htm Japan former Prime Minister Mori addresses FSM Congress], Mori Sensei addresses 15th CFSM, Day–5: No. 31–08, October 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese tourists began to visit the islands from the 1960s onwards, and private businesses were allowed to invest in hotel construction and fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;Crocombe (2007), p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese tourists—30 million travel abroad every year—were seen as a possible economic driver for FSM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spc.int/coastfish/news/Fish_News/95/NIAR_4.htm Pohnpei Fisheries Port Construction Underway], SPC Fisheries Newsletter 95, December 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Sites of historical interests such as the sunken Japanese ships at [[Chuuk Lagoon]] received the highest concentration of Japanese visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Crocombe (2007), p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interethnic relations in society==

Racial segregation was practiced from the early days of civilian rule, and policies were enforced to restrict Micronesians in the education, work force, health care benefits and civil service to inferior positions as compared to their Japanese counterparts. The local populace was classified according to ethnicity, with the Japanese at the top of the social strata, followed by the Okinawans, Koreans, with the Micronesians at the bottom, although some scholars argued that the Micronesians were accorded a more privileged position than the Koreans, who were often subjected to abuse by the Japanese authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Hezel (2003), p. 192–3&lt;/ref&gt; In the education sector, Micronesian children attended public schools (''logakko'' in Japanese) that emphasised teaching vocational skills, self-discipline and a basic command of Japanese. Japanese, Okinawan and Korean children attended primary schools (''shogakko'') with lessons that were based on the mainstream Japanese curriculum.&lt;ref name="Peattie220"/&gt; Very few Micronesians progressed beyond the elementary level, and those who did usually had family connections with influential Japanese figures.&lt;ref&gt;Peattie (1988), p. 95–6&lt;/ref&gt; Micronesians were generally accorded lower-ranking jobs, and most were employed as language interpreters, administrative assistants or jobs that required menial labour.&lt;ref&gt;Hezel (2003), p. 193–4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese actively discouraged the practice of Micronesian customs and religions, which they viewed as "primitive" and "barbaric". Christian missionary activity among the Micronesians was encouraged by the civilian government during the [[interwar period]] in order to encourage them to adopt modern cultural practices.&lt;ref&gt;Poyer et al. (2001), p. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese cultural practices were actively encouraged; many Micronesians learned to speak Japanese fluently and adopted Japanese manners and customs.&lt;ref&gt;Myers et al. (1987), p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, many Koreans did not speak Japanese well, and the eagerness of Okinawans to engage in manual labour occasionally motivated Micronesians to criticize the Japanese culture promoted by the Japanese administrators.&lt;ref name="Peattie220"/&gt; Japanese cultural influences were the strongest in Chuuk and Pohnpei; in most towns by the 1920s, most Micronesians were dressed in Western or Japanese style-clothing.&lt;ref&gt;Hezel (2003), p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; Micronesians in these two states were also very receptive to promiscuous liaisons between Japanese men and Micronesian women; the first brothels appeared in both states in the 1910s. Separate brothels were established for Japanese and Micronesian men, although women in both types of brothels were mainly Micronesian women.&lt;ref&gt;Hiery (1995), p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

In Kosrae and Yap, the Japanese administration had to contend with considerable resistance from the islanders to accept Japanese political and cultural influences. Anti-Japanese sentiment was developed from the early days of Japanese rule in Kosrae, when a Japanese sergeant who was placed in-charge of the island's administrative affairs often threatened the islanders with physical abuse when dealing with conflicts.&lt;ref name="Hezel 2003, p. 177"/&gt; A Japanese custom frowned upon by Kosraeans was the practice of cremation of the dead. In addition, the administrators' indifference towards nudity clashed with the Christian moral values that the islanders held to.&lt;ref&gt;Hezel (2003), p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly in Yap, the islanders' negative attitudes towards the Japanese was developed as a result of incidences of cultural insensitivity from the Japanese administrators. In particular, the introduction of [[Chamorro people|Chamorros]] by the Japanese administration to work as policemen in the island incited racial hatred of Yapese chiefs against the Japanese. As a consequence, few Japanese immigrants chose to settle in Yap or Kosrae.&lt;ref&gt;Hezel (2003), p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|In 1935, only 25 Japanese lived among 1,189 Kosraeans.&lt;ref&gt;Poyer et al. (2001), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;|group=fn}}

The '''Karaim language''' (Crimean dialect: {{lang|kdr|къарай тили}}, Trakai dialect: ''{{lang|kdr|karaj tili}}'', traditional Hebrew name ''{{lang|he-Latn|lashon kedar}}'' {{lang|he|לשון קדר}} "language of the nomads")&lt;ref&gt;[http://eajc.org/page34/news24063.html Tatiana Schegoleva. Karaites of Crimea: History and Present-Day Situation in Community.]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]] with Hebrew influences, in a similar manner to [[Yiddish]] or [[Judaeo-Spanish]]. It is spoken by only a few dozen [[Crimean Karaites]] (''{{lang|kdr|Qrimqaraylar}}'') in [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]] and [[Crimea]] and [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] in [[Ukraine]]. The three main dialects are those of Crimea, [[Trakai]]-[[Vilnius]] and [[Lutsk]]-[[Halych]] all of which are critically [[endangered language|endangered]]. The Lithuanian dialect of Karaim is spoken mainly in the town of Trakai (also known as ''Troki'') by a small community living there since the 14th century.

There is a chance the language will survive in Trakai as a result of official support and because of its appeal to tourists coming to the [[Trakai Island Castle]], where Crimean Karaites are presented as the castle's ancient defenders.

==History==

===Karaims in Crimea and Lithuania===
The origin of the Karaims living in Crimea is subject to much dispute and inconsistency. Difficulty in reconstructing their history stems from the scarcity of documents pertaining to this population. Most of the known history is gathered from correspondence between the populations of Karaims and other populations in the 17th to 19th centuries (Akhiezer 2003). Furthermore, a large number of documents pertaining to the Crimean population of Karaims were burned during the 1736 Russian invasion of the Tatar Khanate's capital, Bakhchisarai (Akhiezer 2003).

Some scholars say that Karaims in Crimea are descendants of Qaraite merchants who migrated to Crimea from the [[Byzantine Empire]] (Schur 1995). In one particular incidence, migration of Qaraites from Istanbul to Crimea is documented following a fire in the Jewish quarter of [[Constantinople]] (modern [[Istanbul]]) in 1203 (Tsoffar 2006). After the Turco-Mongol invasions, settlement of merchants in Crimea may have been encouraged in the 13th and 14th centuries by the active trade routes from Crimea to China and Central Asia (Schur 1995).

On the other hand, "many scholars consider Karaims as descendants of [[Khazars]] and, later, [[Kipchak people|Polovtsi]] tribes" who converted to Qaraism (IICK 2007). Kevin Alan Brook considered the link to the Khazars as historically inaccurate and implausible while claiming Talmudic Jews (especially [[Ashkenaz]]) as the true preservers of the Khazar legacy.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jews of Khazaria'', by Kevin Alan Brook, 2nd ed, p228-232 (that the Crimean and Lithuanian Kariates are not descended from the Khazars), p226-227 (that the Ashkenazic Jews are partially descended from the Khazars).&lt;/ref&gt;

The third hypothesis says that Karaims are the descendants of Israelite tribes from the time of the first Exile by an Assyrian King (720sBCE). The Karaim scholar [[Abraham Firkovich]] collected the documents arguing in favor of this theory before the Russian [[Tsar]]. He was of the opinion that Israelites from Assyria had gone into the North Caucasus and from there, with the permission of the Assyrian king into the Crimean peninsula. He also claimed to have found the tombstone of [[Yitzhak ha-Sangari]] and his wife who he claimed were Karaims. Whether Firkovich forged some of the tombstone inscriptions and manuscripts is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Dov Walfish, and Mikhail Kizilov, ''Bibliographia Karaitica: an Annotated bibliography of Karaites and Karaism. Karaite Texts and Studies'', pub BRILL, 2010, {{ISBN|9004189270}}, p198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the origin of the Karaims in Lithuania also there is no complete consensus yet between the scholars. According to Lithuanian Karaim tradition they came from Crimea in 1392 when the Grand Duke [[Vytautas]] of Lithuania allied with Tokhtamysh against the [[White Horde]] Tatars and relocated 330 Karait families to Lithuania (Schur 1995). Although linguistically sound, and in agreement with the tradition of the [[Lipka Tatars|Lithuanian Tatars]], claiming their origin from the collapsed [[Golden Horde]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=polish-heirs-of-tokhtamysh-2009-12-02 «Polish heirs of Tokhtamysh»] Daily News 12/4/2009&lt;/ref&gt; some modern historians doubts this assumption.&lt;ref&gt;Ahiezer, G. and Shapira, D. 2001.'Karaites in Lithuania and in Volhynia-Galicia until the Eighteenth Century' [Hebrew]. Peamin 89: 19-60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schegoleva&gt;[http://eajc.org/page34/news24063.html Tatiana Schegoleva. Karaites of Crimea: History and Present-Day Situation in Community]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Karaims settled primarily in Vilnius and Trakai, maintaining their Tatar language; there was also further minor settlement in [[Biržai]], [[Pasvalys]], [[Naujamiestis, Panevėžys|Naujamiestis]] and [[Upytė]]. Despite a history through the 16th and 17th centuries that included disease, famine, and pogroms, Lithuania was somewhat less affected by such turmoil than the surrounding areas. As a result, the Lithuanian Karaims had a relative sense of stability over those years, and maintained their isolation as a group, keeping their Turkic language rather than abandoning it for the local languages (“Karaim Homepage” 1998).

===Genetic affiliation of the Karaim language===
Karaim is a member of the [[Turkic languages|''Turkic language'']] family, a group of languages of Eurasia spoken by historically nomadic peoples. Within the Turkic family, Karaim is identified as a member of the [[Kipchak languages]], in turn a member of the Western branch of the Turkic language family (Dahl et al. 2001). Within the Western branch, Karaim is a part of the Ponto-Caspian subfamily (Ethnologue 2007). This language subfamily also includes the [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]] of Ukraine and Uzbekistan, and [[Karachay-Balkar language|Karachay-Balkar]] and [[Kumyk language|Kumyk]] of Russia. The close relation of Karaim to Kypchak and Crimean Tatar makes sense in light of the beginnings of the Lithuanian Karaim people in Crimea.

One hypothesis is that [[Khazars|Khazar]] nobility converted to [[Karaite Judaism]] in the late 8th or early 9th century and were followed by a portion of the general population. This may also have occurred later, under [[Mongols|Mongol rule]], during an influx of people from [[Byzantium]] (Tütüncü et al. 1998).

As all Turkic languages, Karaim grammar is characterized by [[agglutinative language|agglutination]] and [[vowel harmony]]. Genetic evidence for the inclusion of the Karaim language in the Turkic language family is undisputed, based on common vocabulary and grammar. Karaim has a historically [[subject–object–verb]] word order, extensive suffixing agglutination, the presence of vowel harmony, and a lack of gender or noun classes. Lithuanian Karaim has maintained most of these Turkic features despite its history of more than six hundred years in the environment of the Lithuanian, Russian, and Polish languages.

Most of the religious terminology in the Karaim language is [[Arabic]] in etymology, showing the origins of the culture in the Middle East (Zajaczkowski 1961). Arabic and Persian had the earliest influences on the lexicon of Karaim, while later on in its history, the Russian, Ukrainian, and Polish languages made significant contributions to the lexicon of Karaims living in Russia, Ukraine, Poland, and Lithuania.

==Language ecology==

===Distribution of Karaim speakers===
Today, there are Karaim speakers living in [[Crimea]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]], [[Israel]]{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}, and the [[United States]]{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}. However, there only remain about 200 Karaims in [[Lithuania]], only one quarter of whom are competent speakers of the Karaim language (Csató 2001).

Karaim can be subdivided into three [[dialect]]s. The now-extinct eastern dialect, known simply as Crimean Karaim, was spoken in [[Crimea]] until the early 1900s{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}. The northwestern dialect, also called [[Trakai dialect|Trakai]], is spoken in [[Lithuania]], mainly in the towns of [[Trakai]] and [[Vilnius]]. The southwestern dialect, also known as the [[Lusk dialect|Lutsk]] or [[Halich]] dialect, spoken in [[Ukraine]], was near-extinct with only six speakers in a single town as of 2001 (Csató 2001). [[Crimea]]n Karaim is considered to make up the “Eastern group,” while the [[Trakai dialect|Trakai]] and [[Lusk dialect|Lutsk]] dialects comprise the “Western group.”

===Language contact===
	Throughout its long and complicated history, Karaim has experienced extensive language contact. A past rooted in Mesopotamia and persisting connections to the Arab world resulted in Arabic words which likely carried over via the migration of Qaraites from Mesopotamia. The Karaim language was spoken in Crimea during the rule of the Ottoman Empire, so there is also a significant history of contact with Turkish, a distant relative in the Turkic language family. Finally, Karaim coexisted with Lithuanian, Polish, Ukrainian, and Russian as a minority language in the other areas to which it dispersed where Karaims lived and had to speak the dominant majority languages.

Karaim speakers show a strong tendency towards [[code-copying]] (Csató 2001). Code-copying differs from [[code-switching]] in that speakers don’t just switch from one language to another, but actually transfer lexical items and grammatical features from one language to another in processes that may be only for single instances, or that may have much more lasting effects on [[language typology]] (Csató 2001). Extensive code-copying is indicative both of the ever-shrinking population of Karaim speakers (leading to an insufficient Karaim lexicon and a high frequency of borrowing from [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], and [[Church Slavonic language|Slavonic languages]]) and of the high level of language contact in the regions where Karaim is spoken.

===Multilingualism===
Due to the very small number of speakers of Karaim and the high level of multilingualism in [[Lithuania]] in general, there is also a high level of [[multilingualism]] among Karaim speakers. Karaim speakers also communicate with the dominant languages of their respective regions, including [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], and [[Russian language|Russian]]. Some also have religious knowledge of [[Hebrew]] (Csató 2001). Multilingualism is a necessity for Karaim speakers, because without other languages the majority would not even be able to communicate with members of their own family (Csató 2001).

===Language health===
Most{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} dialects of Karaim are now extinct. Maintenance of the Karaim language in [[Lithuania]] is now endangered due to the dispersal of Karaim speakers under the [[Soviet regime]] in the [[aftermath of World War II]] and the very small number and old age of fluent speakers remaining (Csató 2001). Children and grandchildren of Karaim speakers speak [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], or [[Russian language|Russian]], and only the oldest generation still speaks Karaim.

===Phonotactics===
While most languages of the Turkic family exhibit palatal vowel harmony, Trakai Karaim shows harmony in palatalization of consonants. Thus, in any given word, only palatalized or only non-palatalized consonants can be found (Németh 2003). Palatalized consonants occur in the presence of front vowels, and non-palatalized consonants occur in the presence of back vowels. Similarly to most Turkic languages, virtually all of the consonants in Karaim exist in both a palatalized and a non-palatalized form, which may be further evidence of their genetic relationship (Hansson 2007). However, care must be taken in assuming as much, because Karaim has been in contact with the Lipka Tatar language in Lithuania for hundreds of years.

Karaim also exhibits vowel harmony, whereby suffix vowels harmonize for front or back quality with the vowels in the stem of a word (Zajaczkowski 1961).

==Morphology==
Karaim morphology is suffixing and highly agglutinating. The Karaim language lacks prefixes but uses post-positions. Nouns are inflected for seven cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, ablative, locative, and instrumental, which is rare in other Turkic languages). A notable feature of verb conjugation in Karaim is the possibility of abbreviated forms, as shown below for the verb [ał], “to take” (Németh 2003):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=ijH4Hlvd4ZQC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA315&amp;ots=gg5zpEpEoe&amp;sig=yBXJr8awXkehh1ppdp3SEUN4XIM#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Language Change: The Interplay of Internal, External and Extra-Linguistic Factors|last=Jones|first=Mari C.|last2=Esch|first2=Edith|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783110892598|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syntax==
Historically, Karaim had a typically Turkic SOV word order. However, it appears to have acquired somewhat free word order due to extensive language contact situations, and currently has a preference for SVO constructions (Csató 2001). Due to the agglutinative nature of Karaim morphology, pronominal subjects are frequently dropped as the same information is already represented in the inflection of the main verb. Karaim is head-final and uses postpositions.

Karaim syntax exhibits multiple instances of code-copying, whereby Karaim merges with syntactic properties of other languages in its area due to strong language contact situations. The impact of such language contact is also evident in the Karaim lexicon, which has extensive borrowing (Zajaczkowski 1961). In more modern times, the significant borrowing is also representative of insufficiencies in the lexicon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/302343232|title=The Circum-Baltic languages.

==Writing system==
The traditional script of the Karaites on the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew alphabet]] was used till the [[20th century]]. In many Karaite families still stored is written in the Hebrew letter handwritten collection of texts of diverse content, referred to as "miedžuma". Throughout the 20th century, the Karaite communities also used various modifications of [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] ([[Yañalif]], Lithuanian and Polish alphabets) and [[Cyrillic|Cyrillic]] alphabets.

=== Modern write ===
In Lithuania and Poland, a modified Latin alphabet is used to write in Karaim, while in Crimea and Ukraine, it ''was'' written using [[Cyrillic script]]. From the 17th century up until the 19th century, [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] letters were used.

'''Luighne Connacht''' was a territory located in north-central [[Connacht]], on the borders of what is now [[County Mayo]] and [[County Sligo]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

==Origin==

The [[Luighne]] were a people, originally found in [[Kings of Brega|Brega]], south of [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]] in what is now [[County Meath]]. The [[barony (Ireland)|baronies]] of Lune in Meath, and Leyney in Sligo, were called after them. According to [[Lambert McKenna]] (pp.xvi-xvii):

''"[They] probably acquired their land in Connacht as a reward for military service rendered to the tribes which had victoriously invaded that part of the country. Their migration ... and their settlement in Connacht are constantly referred to in the poems of this book" (see [[The Book of O'Hara]]) "and are the chief subject of the story of the Battle of Crionna; it evidently remained a very lively tradition among them even down to late times."''

According to this story, the Luighne accompanied [[Tadhg mac Cian]], who ''"The genealogists brought Tadc and his descendants from [[Éli]] in northern [[Munster]], but since we find the Luigni and [[Gailenga]] closely associated as neighbours and allies in Connacht ... there is reason to agree with MacNeill that they were [[vassal]] tribes of fighting men whom the [[Connachta]] and [[Ui Neill]] ... planted on the lands they had conquered"'' (IKHK, p.&amp;nbsp;69)

Of the original Brega-based tribes called Gailenga, Luigni, Saitne, [[Delbhna]], [[Ciannachta]], [[Francis John Byrne]] goes on to say: ''"the Brega peoples of that name ... extending as they did in a group of tribal kingdoms from [[Glasnevin]] to [[Lough Ramor]] in [[Cavan]], give the impression of a remarkably [[homogeneous]] body. They are so closely connected that in the later period before the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasion]] we find that the kingship of the various tribes seem to have been interchangeable. They form a striking contrast to the population of [[Mide]]... But the [[Brú na Bóinne|Boyne]] valley had been an area of settled culture since [[Neolithic]] times, so that it is likely that a basic unity persisted under the superstructures of succeeding conquests."'' (IKHK, p.&amp;nbsp;69) Members of these population-groups were able to exploit the political weakness of the [[Clann Cholmáin]] during the 11th and 12th centuries and become [[Kings of Brega]] after centuries of subordination.

==The Luighne of Connacht==

The early [[Connachta]] had close alliances with the Luighne, Gailenga, [[Grecraige]] and [[Corca Fhir Trí]], all of whom were found in close association with Connachta territory west of the [[River Shannon|Shannon]]. ("It was probably not until the end of the 6th century that the name Connachta was restricted to those of the dynastic group who remained in the west: the [[Uí Fiachrach]], [[Uí Briúin]] and [[Uí Ailello]]." IKHK, p.&amp;nbsp;231).

In Connacht, the Luighne and neighbouring tribes were classed as ''[[Fortuatha]]'' ("kingdoms not ruled directly by members of the dominant dynasty of a province", IKHK, p.&amp;nbsp;45), meaning ''external'' or ''alien'' tribes. Byrne notes that the Luighne dominated smaller, minor tribes (including the likes of the [[Calraige]], Grecraige and Corca Fhir Trí), ''"and have some claim to be considered an over-kingdom, as was recognised in the 12th century when their lands were erected into the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Achonry|diocese of Achonry]]."''

McKenna (p.xvii) writes ''"Less common that "Luighne" there is "Luighne Connacht", the use of which is puzzling. sometime it appears to be [[synonymous]] with "Luighne". ... On the other hand, "Luighne Connacht" is often used to denote a folk distinct from "Luighne".''' In [[Rawlinson B 502]] ... we find a separate "genealogy of Luighne Connacht" breaking off from the main Luighne line somewhere in the 8th century, and descending from Ceannfhaoloadh brother of Flaithgheas. (see Genealogy, below).

==The Three Luighne==

An Teora Sloinnte Luighne (''the three Luighne'') appear to have been the clans of Ó hEaghra, [[Ó Gadhra]] and Ó Dobhailen; the latter descend from [[Dobhailen mac Gormghus]], noted on his death in 885 as ''king of Luighne Connacht''. Dobhailen is explicitly listed as of the [[Corca Fhir Trí]], so his people, originally themselves thought to be subject to the Luighne, had come to rank as one of Luighne's ruling dynasties.

McKenna further states (p.xviii-xix): ''"In their many entries the Annals use the word Gaileanga to indicate sometimes a people but more often, especially in their later ones, a district, i.e., the district afterwards known as the barony of [[Gallen (barony)|Gallen]]. In 993, the Lord of Gaileanga is said to be Ua Gadhra. Hence it would appear probable that the territory afterwards called Gallen was at first ruled by its Gaileanga princes, and that towards the end of the 10th century it came under the power of the chieftains of Luighne, chiefly that of the Í Ghadhra, who ruled it till the early 13th century when they were thrust aside by the Jordans; it is often afterwards referred to as Mac Jordan's country."''

'''Murato''' is the unattested but presumed language of the [[Uros]] of [[Lake Poopo]] in Bolivia (Adelaar 2004). The Murato have shifted to [[Aymara language|Aymara]], but preserve some Uru vocabulary.

==Family==
Married to Ahmad Bakhtiar, has two sons and one daughter.&lt;ref name=leaders/&gt;

==Parachuting controversy==
In April 2007, [[Islamic cleric]]s in Pakistan issued a [[fatwa]] urging that she be punished and fired from the government after some newspapers printed photographs of her hugging and kissing a male colleague after landing from a parachute jump in [[France]]. The clerics stated that this was "an illegitimate and forbidden act, and that without any doubt, she has committed a great sin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/facesinthenews/2007/04/10/bakhtiar-pakistan-fatwa-face-cx_rd_0410autofacescan01.html Forbes, Hug Sparks Fatwa Against Pakistani Minister]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahktiar described the hug as a congratulatory pat after her parachute jump. "It was just a pat because he felt so proud of me, I did it for a good cause. I did not have any practice of parajumping. I thought it was brave on my part."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/world/4700485.html Pakistani official chided for her 'un-Islamic act']&lt;/ref&gt; The jump had been intended to raise money for victims of the [[2005 Kashmir earthquake]].

On May 21, 2007, according to some sources Nilofar Bakhtiar announced her resignation as Tourism Minister, over the parachute controversy.  Pakistani Prime Minister [[Shaukat Aziz]] rejected this resignation&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6682969.stm |title=Pakistan fatwa minister to stay |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2007-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Bakhtiar insisted and quit. She planned to sue the clerics behind the fatwa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inhome.rediff.com/cms/print.jsp?docpath=//news/2007/jun/21pak.htm Former Pak minister to sue clerics] ''Rediff'', 21 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ms Bakhtiar complained of a campaign of intimidation against her, and had told a Senate Standing Committee that her life was under threat. Ms Bakhtiar said she was disappointed by her Cabinet colleagues who had failed to stand by her.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article1820247.ece The Times - Pakistan minister resigns over 'immoral' hug]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|Orang Asli in Peninsular Malaysia|Orang Asli}}
The '''Orang Asal''' are the [[indigenous people]] of [[Malaysia]]. The term is [[Malay language|Malay]] for "Original People", used to refer to the  aboriginals of [[Sabah]], [[Sarawak]], and [[Malaysian Malays|Malays]]. These groups are given the [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Bumiputera]] status in Malaysia.

The Orang Asal in [[Peninsular Malaysia]] are collectively known as the [[Orang Asli]], and are minorities on the Peninsula, whereas the Orang Asal of [[East Malaysia]] form a majority of the population.

==Etymology==
The term "Orang Asal" means "Original People".&lt;ref name="WildAsia"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sze |first=Puah |url=http://www.wildasia.org/main.cfm/support/Crafting_Culture |title=Crafting Culture: The Orang Asal of Malaysia |publisher=Wild Asia |date=2006-03-13 |accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally used by Communist insurgents in the [[Malayan Emergency]] in order to gain the support of these tribal groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Status==
Orang Asal are officially [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Bumiputera]], which grants them special privileges in Malaysian society as accorded in the [[Constitution of Malaysia]]. However, their societies remain marginalised, and they have been labelled as "second-class Bumiputra's" in contrast with the ethnic [[Malaysian Malays|Malays]].&lt;ref name="Indigenous"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indigenousportal.com/Economic-Development/Malaysia-Land-autonomy-and-empowerment-for-the-Orang-Asal.html |title=Malaysia: Land, autonomy and empowerment for the Orang Asal |publisher=Indigenousportal.com |date=2010-09-24 |accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ongoing issue is in regards to land, which is often taken for development purposes.&lt;ref name="WildAsia"/&gt; This has caused many issues, including court cases and divisions between federal and state governments.&lt;ref name="Wessendorf"/&gt; In addition, [[illegal logging]] often occurs on what is considered traditional land of the Orang Asal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2010/11/4/nation/20101104150140&amp;sec=nation |title=Lawyers want S'wak to remove entry ban on Suhakam official |publisher=Thestar.com.my |date=2010-11-04 |accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues have also occurred in relation to immigration, with immigrants often given identity cards ahead of the Orang Asal.&lt;ref name="Indigenous"/&gt; In addition, many have also been pressed to assimilate into mainstream culture and convert to [[Islam]].&lt;ref name="Wessendorf"&gt;{{Cite book

==Divisions==
[[File:Modern Iban Longhouse.JPG|thumb|left|[[Iban people|Iban]] [[Long house|Longhouse]] constructed using modern materials]]
Orang Asal are located throughout Malaysia, making up 11% of the population,&lt;ref name="CIA Fact Book"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/my.html |title=Malaysia |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; about 2.1 million people. Orang Asal is an overarching term, encompassing all indigenous people on both Peninsula and [[East Malaysia]].&lt;ref name="WildAsia"/&gt;

Those on the Peninsula are known more specifically as the [[Orang Asli]]; they number around 149,500&lt;ref name="WildAsia"/&gt; and make up only 0.7% of the total Malaysian population. They are officially 19 ethnic subgroups, classed as either Negrito, Senoi, or Proto-Malay.&lt;ref name="IWGIA"/&gt;

Some numbers differ, but East Malaysia contains a total of about 64 indigenous groups, around 39 in [[Sabah]] and 25 in [[Sarawak]].&lt;ref name="Indigenous"/&gt; The Orang Asal make up 60% of Sabah's population, and 50% of Sarawak's population. Sabah's population is hugely diverse, with over 50 languages and 80 dialects spoken.&lt;ref name="IWGIA"/&gt; The largest group on Sarawak is the [[Iban people|Iban]].&lt;ref name="UN"/&gt;

==Culture==
[[File:Orangaslifirestarter.jpg|thumb|An Orang asli starting a fire]]
The Orang Asal have their own religions and customs, as well as unique languages.&lt;ref name="WildAsia"/&gt; The languages spoken are generally from the [[Austronesian]] and [[Austroasiatic]] language families. The languages of the peninsula can be grouped into Negrito, Senoi, and Malayic, which together can be divided into about 18 subgroups. However, all these languages are in danger of being lost as the children in the tribes learn [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[English language|English]]. The primary languages in East Malaysia are [[Kadazan Dusun language|Kadazan-Dusun]] and [[Iban language|Iban]], both used by many indigenous groups. In contrast to the indigenous languages of the peninsula, these languages are commonly used in everyday life.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;{{cite web|author=Kamila Ghazali |url=https://www.un.org/wcm/content/site/chronicle/home/archive/issues2010/un_academic_impact/national_identity_and_minority_languages?ctnscroll_articleContainerList=1_0&amp;ctnlistpagination_articleContainerList=true |title=National Identity and Minority Languages |publisher=United Nations |date= |accessdate=2010-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102173228/http://www.un.org/wcm/content/site/chronicle/home/archive/issues2010/un_academic_impact/national_identity_and_minority_languages?ctnscroll_articleContainerList=1_0&amp;ctnlistpagination_articleContainerList=true |archivedate=November 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the peninsula each subgroup is culturally distinct from the others, with lifestyles varying from fishermen to farmers to hunter-gatherers. Although many are now settled due to the intrusion of modern life, some remain semi-nomadic.&lt;ref name="IWGIA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwgia.org/sw18358.asp |title= Indigenous Peoples in Malaysia 
 |publisher=International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs  |date= |accessdate=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The people of Sabah are traditionally subsistence farmers, although nowadays they are becoming more involved in local government. Many Orang Asal in Sarawak subsist on rice, supplementing the meal with hunting. Some also remain semi-nomadic.&lt;ref name="IWGIA"/&gt; The Orang Asal of East Malaysia are known for their artwork such as wooden masks.&lt;ref name="Marshall"&gt;{{Cite book

'''Oroko''', also ''Bakundu-Balue'' or ''Balundu-Bima'', is a poorly known [[Bantu language|Bantu]] dialect cluster spoken in [[Cameroon]].

Varieties are Kundu/Nkundu (''Lokundu, Bakundu''), Lue (''Lolue, Balue''), Mbonge, Ekombe, Londo (Londo ba Nanga; ''cf'' [[Londo language|Londo]]), Londo ba Diko, Ngolo (''Longolo''; ''cf'' [[Ngolo dialect]]), Bima, Tanga (''Lotanga, Batanga''), and Koko (''Lokoko, Bakoko'': distinct from [[Bakoko language]]). Maho (2009) treats these as ten distinct languages.

'''''Rindge Co. v. County of Los Angeles''''', 262 U.S. 700 (1923),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Rindge Co. v. County of Los Angeles|volume=262|page=700|pin=|year=1923}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] held that a county government could use its power of [[eminent domain]] to take land from a private landowner to build a scenic highway.

&lt;blockquote&gt;these roads, especially the main road, through its connection with the public road coming along the shore from Santa Monica, will afford a highway for persons desiring to travel along the shore to the county line, with a view of the ocean on one side, and of the mountain range on the other, constituting, as stated by the trial judge, a scenic highway of great beauty. Public uses are not limited, in the modern view, to matters of mere business necessity and ordinary convenience, but may extend to matters of public health, recreation and enjoyment. Thus, the condemnation of lands for public parks is now universally recognized as a taking for public use. A road need not be for a purpose of business to create a public exigency; air, exercise and recreation are important to the general health and welfare; pleasure travel may be accommodated as well as business travel; and highways may be condemned to places of pleasing natural scenery.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Background ==
According to the [[Adamson House]] tour guides:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1892, Henry Keller sold the {{convert|13000|acre|km2|sing=on}} [[Rancho Topanga Malibu Sequit]] or 'Rancho Malibu' to May and [[Frederick H. Rindge]], for a price variously reported as $10-$22 per acre. Keller, it is said, had acquired it for 10 cents an acre in 1854. Rindge, from Cambridge, Massachusetts, had recently inherited  an estate of more than $2 million and moved to [[Los Angeles]], California, where he wrote a book called "Happy Days in Southern California." Then he looked for "a farm near the  ocean, and under the lee of the mountain, with a trout brook, wild trees, a lake, good soil, and excellent climate." He found his farm in Malibu Canyon. He described the Malibu coast as the American Riviera.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adamsonhouse.org/Tour/tour.html Adamson House Tour&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

May Rindge of Cambridge, Massachusetts formerly owned {{convert|17000|acre|km2}} of ranch land that today is the city of [[Malibu, California]]. First, the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] tried to take her land, so, according to the city of Malibu:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Upon hearing of the Southern Pacific's plans, Mr. Rindge decided to build a private railroad through his ranch to keep the bigger railroad company out of his domain. A little-known law prevented duplication of an existing railroad line. Before any tracks could be laid, however, Mr. Rindge died. It was left to his widow to carry out his plans, which she did with {{convert|15|mi|km}} of standard gauge tracks called the [[Hueneme, Malibu and Port Los Angeles Railway]]. May Rindge became its president and one of the few women ever to become president of a railroad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.malibu.ca.us/index.cfm?fuseaction=detail&amp;navid=9&amp;cid=428 Chapter Four&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The rails were later reused to build [[Rindge Dam]].
 
According to Malibu Complete,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first wave of lawsuits for more access started in 1907 and were not settled fully until 1917 by which time both Federal and California state courts decided in Rindge's favor, that she could restrict access to roads crossing her private land, including the beach. However, that victory was upset in 1919 when Los Angeles County bowed to public pressure and used the courts to condemn the right-of-way and begin construction of a road. Mrs. Rindge continued the fight in court, and to resist survey and construction work, but merely delayed the road. Overcoming all of May Rindge's objections, the County Road through Malibu Ranch was finally opened for the public on November 3, 1921.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malibucomplete.com/mc_history_rindge.php Malibu History: The Rindge Family&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''seven hills of Rome''' ({{lang-it|Sette colli di Roma}} {{IPA-it|ˈsɛtte ˈkɔlli di ˈroːma|}}, {{lang-la|Septem colles/ montes Romae}}) east of the river [[Tiber]] form the geographical heart of [[Rome]], within the [[Servian Wall|walls]] of the city.

The seven hills are:&lt;ref name="Heiken et al."&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heiken|first1=Grant|last2=Funiciello|first2=Renato|last3=de Rita|first3=Donatella|title=The Seven Hills of Rome: A Geological Tour of the Eternal City|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6eADAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA174|date=Oct 24, 2013|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=9780691130385|page=174|chapter=Chapter 11: Field Trips in and Around Rome}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Aventine Hill]] (Latin, ''Aventinus''; Italian, ''Aventino'')
* [[Caelian Hill]] (''Cælius'', ''Celio'')
* [[Capitoline Hill]] (''Capitolinus'', ''Campidoglio'')
* [[Esquiline Hill]] (''Esquilinus'', ''Esquilino'')
* [[Palatine Hill]] (''Palatinus'', ''Palatino'')
* [[Quirinal Hill]] (''Quirinalis'', ''Quirinale'')
* [[Viminal Hill]] (''Viminalis'', ''Viminale'')

The [[Vatican Hill]] (Latin ''Collis Vaticanus'') lying northwest of the [[Tiber]], the [[Pincian Hill]] (Latin ''Mons Pincius''), lying to the north, and the [[Janiculum Hill]] (Latin ''Ianiculum''), lying to the west, are not counted among the traditional Seven Hills.

==History==
[[Tradition]] holds that [[Romulus]] and Remus founded the original city on the Palatine Hill on April 21st, 753 BC, and that the seven hills were first occupied by small settlements that were not grouped nor recognized as a city called Rome. The seven hills' denizens began to interact, which began to bond the groups. The city of Rome, thus, came into being as these separate settlements acted as a group, draining the marshy valleys between them and turning them into markets (''[[Forum (Roman)|fora]]'' in Latin). Later, in the early 4th century BC, the [[Servian Walls]] were constructed to protect the seven hills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italymagazine.com/dual-language/seven-hills-rome "The Seven Hills of Rome", ''Italy Magazine'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern Rome, five of the seven hills, the Aventine, Caelian, Esquiline, Quirinal, and Viminal Hills,  are now the sites of monuments, buildings, and parks. The Capitoline Hill is the location of Rome's city hall, and the Palatine Hill is part of the main archaeological area.

===Other cities with seven hills===
{{Main|List of cities claimed to be built on seven hills}}
[[Constantinople]], [[Lisbon]] and [[Newton, Massachusetts]] are also said to have been built on seven hills, following the example of Rome: "The general features of Newton are not without interest. Seven principal elevations mark its siu-face, like the seven hills of ancient Rome, with the difference that the seven hills of Newton are much more distinct than the seven hills of Rome: [[Nonantum]] Hill, [[Waban]] Hill, [[Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts|Chestnut Hill]], Bald Pate, [[Oak Hill, Massachusetts|Oak Hill]], Institution Hill and Mount Ida."&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=S.F.|title=History of Newton, Massachusetts, Town and City, from its Earliest Settlement to the Present Time, 1630-1880,|url=http://www.bostonbasinhills.org/pages/newton-hills.html|date=Jan 23, 2018|publisher=The American Logotype Company||page=13|chapter=Chapter 1: History of Newton}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also ''[[Seven hills of Istanbul]]''.

'''Silesian''' (Silesian: ''{{lang|sli|Schläsche Sproache}}'' or ''{{lang|sli|Schläs'sche Sproche}}'', {{lang-de|Schlesisch}}), '''Silesian German''' or '''Lower Silesian''' is a nearly extinct [[German dialect]] spoken in [[Silesia]]. It is part of the [[East Central German]] language area with some [[West Slavic languages|West Slavic]] influences. Variations of the dialect until 1945 were spoken by about seven million people.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Ullmann: ''Schlesien-Lexikon,'' 2. Band der Reihe ''Deutsche Landschaften im Lexikon,'' 3. Auflage 1982, Adam Kraft Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KG Mannheim, pp. 260–262.&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II]], local [[communism|communist]] authorities forbade the use of the language, after the [[expulsion of Germans from Poland after World War II|expulsion of the Germans]] the province of Silesia was incorporated into southwestern [[Poland]], with small portions remaining in northeastern [[Czech Republic]] and in eastern [[Germany]]. Silesian German continued to be spoken only by individual families expelled to the remaining territory of Germany and in cultural gatherings mainly in [[West Germany]]. Most descendants of the Silesian Germans expelled to [[West Germany|West]] and [[East Germany]] no longer learned the dialect, and the cultural gatherings were less and less frequented.

== History ==
[[File:Schlesien Karte Dialekte Vorläufig.png|thumbnail|300px|Historical area of distribution of the Silesian German]]
In origin, Silesian German appears to derive from 12th-century dialects of [[Middle High German]], including medieval forms of [[Upper Saxon German]], [[East Franconian German]] and [[Thuringian dialect|Thuringian]]. The inhabitants of Silesia are thought to be descendants of settlers from [[Upper Lusatia]], [[Saxony]], [[Thuringia]] and [[Franconia]] who arrived in Silesia in the 13th century.

After [[World War II]], local [[communism|communist]] authorities forbade the use of the language. After the forcible [[expulsion of Germans from Poland after World War II|expulsion of the Germans]] from Silesia, German Silesian culture and language nearly died out when most of [[Silesia]] became part of [[Poland]] in 1945. Polish authorities banned the use of the German language. There are still unresolved feelings on the sides of both Poles and Germans, largely because of Nazi Germany's war crimes on Poles and the forced expulsion and [[ethnic cleansing]] of native Germans from [[former eastern territories of Germany|former German territories]] that were transferred to Poland in the wake of the [[Potsdam Agreement]].

The German Silesian dialect is not recognized by the Polish State in any way, although the status of the [[German minority in Poland]] has improved much since the 1991 communist collapse and Polish entry into the [[European Union]].

Silesian can be divided into ''{{lang|de|gebirgsschlesische Dialektgruppe}}'', ''{{lang|de|südostschlesische Dialektgruppe}}'', ''{{lang|de|mittelschlesische Dialektgruppe}}'', ''{{lang|de|westschlesische Dialektgruppe}}'' and ''{{lang|de|neiderländische Dialektgruppe}}''.&lt;ref name="Schmitt"&gt;Ludwig Erich Schmitt (ed.): ''Germanische Dialektologie''. Franz Steiner, Wiesbaden 1968&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|138–139}} The ''{{lang|de|nordostböhmische Dialektgruppe}}'' belongs to Silesian, too.&lt;ref&gt;Alois Kreller: ''Wortgeographie des Schönhengster Landes''. Kraus, Nendeln 1939, 1979  Kraus, vol. 3, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmitt"/&gt;{{rp|143}}

Silesian German was the language in which the [[poetry]] of [[Karl von Holtei]] and [[Gerhart Hauptmann]] was written, during the 19th century.

The '''South Tyrol Alpine Club''' ({{lang-de|Alpenverein Südtirol}}), abbreviated '''AVS''', is an association of German and [[Ladin language|Ladin]]-speaking mountain climbers in [[South Tyrol]], northern [[Italy]]. Founded in 1946, it is sub-divided into 32 sections and 58 local divisions. The AVS is based in [[Bolzano]] and has more than 60,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.stol.it/Artikel/Chronik-im-Ueberblick/Lokal/AVS-zaehlt-ueber-60.000-Mitglieder AVS zählt über 60.000 Mitglieder]'', stol.it, 11 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Originally, the [[South Tyrol]]ean alpine club sections were members of the [[German and Austrian Alpine Club]] (''Deutscher und Österreichischer Alpenverein''). In 1869 the first sections were founded in Bozen and [[Niederdorf, South Tyrol|Niederdorf]], [[Puster Valley]]. By 1910, 15 more sections had been established in South Tyrol. They initiated the construction of 19 mountain huts, an extensive network of paths through the mountains and training for mountain guides. After the end of the [[First World War]], [[History of South Tyrol|the annexation of South Tyrol by Italy]] and the coming into power of the [[Italian Fascism|fascists]], the South Tyrolean sections were disappropriated and banned in 1923 (see [[Italianization of South Tyrol]]). After the end of the [[Second World War]], on December 31, 1945, the military administration of the  [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] permitted the foundation of the South Tyrol Alpine Club. Its inaugural meeting took place in Bolzano on 14 June 1946.

Nowadays, the AVS takes care of more than 9,500&amp;nbsp;km of hiking trails and is involved in nature conservancy and South Tyrolean cultural issues as well. The club is a member of the [[Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme]] and the [[Club Arc Alpin]]. In 2007, the AVS finished its project to digitalise all hiking trails in South Tyrol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trekking.suedtirol.info/ Website with the digitalised data] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Stunt casting is used to generate media attention.&lt;ref name="awn"&gt;[http://www.awn.com/mag/issue4.01/4.01pages/bevilacquaceleb.php3 Celebrity Voice Actors: The New Sound of Animation] April 1999&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be employed in order to garner studio support or financing for a project; for example, according to DVD featurette commentary, the 1978 version of ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' received studio support only after the producers were able to enlist A-list actors [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Gene Hackman]] to appear.

'''Jose Manuel Lujanbio Retegi''' (also known as '''Txirrita'''), born on [[Hernani, Spain|Hernani]] in 1860 and died in [[Altza]] in 1936,&lt;ref name=Orhi&gt;Etxegoien, J. ''Orhipean, Gure Herria ezagutzen'' Xamar: 1996 {{ISBN|84-7681-119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Basque people|Basque]] composer of verse, known as [[bertsolari]]s.

== Life ==
He was born in the [[Ereñozu]] neighborhood of Hernani and when he was still a child, his family moved to a [[baserri]] in [[Errenteria]] named ''Txirrita'', from whence he acquired his nickname. In his last years he lived in the ''Gazteluene'' baserri in Altza. 

Due to an accident he suffered in [[Goizueta, Navarre|Goizueta]] in May 1936, on June 3 of the same year he died in the ''Gazteluene'' baserri, in Altza.

==Txirrita the bertsolari==
Although he was heir to the baserri, he left the farm and started working as [[bricklayer]]. He began his career as a bertsolari aged 14, being in the company of bertsolaris much older than himself. He stood out by his sharp wit and agile tongue, and his witticisms left a lasting memory.

Many of his bertsos deal with social issues, and the thoughts and feelings of the lower classes. As [[Antonio Zavala]] was told, many people sought out Txirrita to ask him to compose a bertso against other people. The subject of many of these bertsos was that of unrequited love. Txirrita composed his bertsos on the subject required and his nephew would write them down, later putting them into print, and after selling them on the fairs. 

Thanks to collective memory and collectors of bertso-papers like Antonio Zavala, many of these bertsos were recorded.  Txirrita became the prototypical bertsolari - an old bachelor, reveller and rogue. Although he was a skillful bricklayer, he didn't enjoy work, and at every opportunity he would seek out a tavern to drink, sing bertsos or bet. Txirrita was unschooled and although he could read, he could not write, and he would dictate bertsos to his nephew.

In 1935 he was the runner-up in the first bertsolari championship of the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], and the year after won the championship.

==Legacy==
In [[Bilbao]], Hernani and Altza three streets bear his name. In Errenteria there is an industrial park called Txirrita-Maleo, named after its location between the farmhouses of Txirrita and Maleo.

'''Umhlanga''' {{IPA-zu|um̩ɬaːŋɡa|}}, or '''Reed Dance''' ceremony, is an annual [[Swazi people|Swazi]] and [[Zulu people|Zulu]] event.&lt;ref name="patricks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sntc.org.sz/cultural/umhlanga.asp|title=Cultural Resources – Swazi Culture – The Umhlanga or Reed Dance|last=Patricks|first=Richard M. |date=July 2000|work=SNTC website|publisher=Swaziland National Trust Commission|accessdate=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Swaziland|Eswatini]], tens of thousands of unmarried and childless Swazi girls and women travel from the various chiefdoms to the [[Ludzidzini Royal Village]] to participate in the eight-day event.&lt;ref name="sta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welcometoswaziland.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=77 |title=Umhlanga / Reed Dance |work=STA website |publisher=Swaziland Tourism Authority |accessdate=4 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106195434/http://www.welcometoswaziland.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=77 |archivedate=6 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The young, unmarried girls were placed in female age-regiments; girls who had fallen pregnant outside wedlock had their families fined a cow.&lt;ref name=patricks /&gt; 

Umhlanga was created in the 1940s in Eswatini under the rule of [[Sobhuza II]], and is an adaptation of the much older [[Umcwasho]] ceremony.&lt;ref name=patricks /&gt; The reed dance continues to be practised today in Eswatini. In South Africa, the reed dance was introduced in 1991 by [[Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu|Goodwill Zwelithini]], the current [[List of Zulu kings|King of the Zulus]]. The dance in South Africa takes place in [[Nongoma]], a royal ''[[kraal]]'' of the Zulu king.&lt;ref name=McNeill /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ivanovic2008 /&gt;

==South Africa==
[[File:South africa - zulu reed dance ceremony (6563648943).jpg|thumb|300px|Umkhosi woMhlanga in [[Nongoma]], South Africa.]]
In South Africa, the ceremony is known as '''Umkhosi woMhlanga''', and takes place every year in September at the Enyokeni Royal Palace in [[Nongoma]], KwaZulu-Natal.&lt;ref name="Ivanovic2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Milena Ivanovic|title=Cultural Tourism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fZ6Wb8AptvYC&amp;pg=PA155|accessdate=21 August 2013|year=2008|publisher=Juta and Company Ltd|isbn=978-0-7021-7185-7|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; The girls come from all parts of [[Zululand District Municipality|Zululand]], and in recent years there are also smaller groups from [[Swaziland|Eswatini]], as well as more distant places such as [[Botswana]] and [[Pondoland]].&lt;ref name=zlltourism&gt;{{cite web|title=Nongoma |url=http://www.zululandtourism.org.za/Towns/Nongoma.aspx |publisher=Zululand Tourism |accessdate=20 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719003946/http://www.zululandtourism.org.za/Towns/Nongoma.aspx |archivedate=19 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

All girls are required to undergo a [[virginity test]] before they are allowed to participate in a royal dance.&lt;ref name="Ivanovic2008"/&gt; In recent years the testing practice has been met with some opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Zulu Reed Dance – A Celebration of Purity|url=http://news.howzit.msn.com/news-in-pics/a-celebration-of-purity?page=2|publisher=Howzit MSN News|accessdate=20 August 2013}}{{dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The girls wear traditional attire, including [[beadwork]], and  ''izigege'' and ''izinculuba'' that show their bottoms.&lt;ref name=eshowe&gt;{{cite web|title=Zulu Reed Dance |url=http://eshowe.com/zulu-reed-dance/ |publisher=Eshowe |accessdate=20 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818150118/http://eshowe.com/zulu-reed-dance/ |archivedate=18 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also wear anklets, bracelets, necklaces, and colourful sashes. Each sash has appendages of a different colour, which denote whether or not the girl is [[betrothed]].&lt;ref name=dhat&gt;{{cite web|title=Dance History And Theory|url=http://www.education.gpg.gov.za/Learners/Grade%2012%20NSC%20Exam%20Papers%20%202011%20Final%20Possible%20Answ/Dance%20Studies%20-%20English.pdf|publisher=Gauteng Province Education|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the ceremony, the young women dance [[Toplessness|bare-breasted]] for their king, and each maiden carries a long [[Reed (plant)|reed]], which is then deposited as they approach the king.&lt;ref name="Dubin2013"/&gt; The girls take care to choose only the longest and strongest reeds, and then carry them towering above their heads in a slow procession up the hill to Enyokeni Palace.&lt;ref name=zlltourism/&gt; The procession is led by the chief Zulu princess, who takes a prominent role throughout the festival.&lt;ref name=zlltourism/&gt; If the reed should break before the girl reaches that point, it is considered a sign that the girl has already been sexually active.&lt;ref name="Dubin2013"/&gt;

The ceremony was reintroduced by King [[Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu|Goodwill Zwelethini]] in 1991, as a means to encourage young Zulu girls to delay sexual activity until marriage, and thus limit the possibility of [[HIV transmission]].&lt;ref name="McNeill"&gt;{{cite book|last=McNeill|first=Fraser G.|title=AIDS, Politics, and Music in South Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Txv95anBbAC&amp;pg=PA27|accessdate=21 August 2013|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49959-0|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, about 30,000 girls took part to the event.&lt;ref name="Dubin2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Dubin|title=Spearheading Debate: Culture Wars &amp; Uneasy Truces|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EXbBS63DMq0C&amp;pg=PA61|accessdate=21 August 2013|date=7 January 2013|publisher=Jacana Media|isbn=978-1-4314-0737-8|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisers of the ceremony have occasionally enforced strict rules on photographers, as some of them have been accused of publishing pictures of the rites on [[pornographic websites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goodwill says virginity testing here to stay|url=http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/sowetan/archive/2007/09/10/goodwill-says-virginity-testing-here-to-stay|publisher=Sowetan LIVE|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In past years, the event was attended by former [[President of South Africa]], [[Jacob Zuma]] (himself a Zulu), and former [[Premier of KwaZulu-Natal]], [[Zweli Mkhize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trees planted at Reed Dance|url=http://www.witness.co.za/index.php?showcontent&amp;global%5B_id%5D=68221|publisher=The Witness|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eswatini==
[[File:Princess Swaziland 013.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Sikhanyiso Dlamini|HRH Princess Sikhanyiso Dlamini]] (centre), dancing at Umhlanga, 2006. She wears a red feather crown, distinguishing her as a royal female.]]
[[File:Reed Dance Festival 2006-018.jpg|thumb|300px|The 2006 Reed Dance in [[Lobamba]].]]

In [[Swaziland|Eswatini]], girls begin the rite by gathering at the [[Ndlovukati|Queen Mother]]'s royal village, which currently is [[Ludzidzini Royal Village]].&lt;ref name="patricks"/&gt; After arriving at the Queen Mother's [[Palace|royal residence]], the women disperse the following night to surrounding areas and cut tall reeds. The following night, they bundle the reeds together and bring them back to the Queen Mother to be used in repairing holes in the reed windscreen surrounding the royal village. 

After a day of rest and washing, the women prepare their traditional costumes consisting of a bead necklace, rattling anklets made from cocoons, a sash, and skirt. Many of them carry the bush knives, which they had earlier used to cut the reeds, as symbols of their [[virginity]].

The women sing and dance as they parade in front of the royal family as well as a crowd of dignitaries, spectators, and tourists. After the parade, groups from select villages take to the centre of the field and put on a special performance for the crowd. The King's many daughters and royal princesses also participate in the reed dance ceremony and are distinguished by the crown of red feathers they wear in their hair.

The present form of the Reed Dance developed in the 1940s from the [[Umcwasho]] custom, where young girls were placed in age regiments to ensure their virginity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sntc.org.sz/sdphotos/photos.asp?pg=8&amp;decade=189|title=Umcwasho maidens 1895|work=Swaziland Digital Archives|publisher=[[Swaziland National Trust Commission]]|accessdate=18 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once they had reached marriageable age, they would perform labour for the Queen Mother followed by dancing and a feast. The official purpose of the annual ceremony is to preserve the women's [[chastity]], provide tribute labour for the Queen Mother, and produce solidarity among the women through working together.&lt;ref name=patricks /&gt;

==Nudity controversy==
The reed dance videos were once classified as age-restricted content by Youtube, which angered the users who had uploaded them. This included Lazi Dlamini, the head of TV Yabantu, an online video production company that aims to produce content that “protects, preserves and restores African values”. Working with more than 200 cultural groupings across the country and in neighbouring Eswatini, Dlamini organised a series of protests against Google to force them to rethink their position. At last, YouTube apologized, and allowed the showing of bonafide African traditional videos , - ''Google says it has lifted the restriction on the videos that were age-restricted as it is not its policy to restrict nudity in such instances where it is culturally or traditionally appropriate.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=YouTube lifts Swazi bare-breasted dancer restrictions|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-41612863|website =BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2017-10-12-hey-google-my-breasts-are-not-inappropriate |title=‘Hey Google, our breasts aren’t sexual’|website=Mail and Guardian |date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Usuda Star Dome'''|うすだスタードーム}} is a [[public observatory]] located in [[Saku, Nagano|Saku]], [[Nagano Prefecture|Nagano]], [[Japan]].

Saku is one of the best places for astronomical observation in Japan because of high altitude, high rate of sunny days, and limpid air.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://global.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/alos/topics.html |title=Advanced Land Observing Satellite "DAICHI" (ALOS) - Topics |publisher=[[JAXA]] |date=2002-02-08 |accessdate=2016-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sakukankou.jp/MT/mtblog/shinsyusaku2016.pdf |title=Shinsyu SAKU 2016 |format=pdf |publisher=Saku City Tourism Association |access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visitors are allowed to watch stars through the large [[telescope]] from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.

== History ==
The observatory was founded by [[Usuda, Nagano|Usuda]]. It was transferred to (new) Saku on April 1, 2005 when Usuda has merged with (old) Saku, [[Mochizuki, Nagano|Mochizuki]], and [[Asashina, Nagano|Asashina]].

[[File:60cm reflector of USD.png|right|176px|thumb|600 mm reflector]]
[[File:20cm refractors of USD.png|right|176px|thumb|200 mm refractors]]

The main telescope of the observatory is 600&amp;nbsp;mm [[Cassegrain reflector]] constructed by Mitaka Kohki. It has the "Wonder Eye" flexible focal extending system which provides "barrier free" star watching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mitakakohki.co.jp/english/telescope/support-lineup/wonder-eye.html |title=Wonder Eye (Mitaka Kohki Co., Ltd.) |accessdate=2016-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also equipped with two 200&amp;nbsp;mm [[Refracting telescope|refractors]] also constructed by Mitaka Kohki.

'''Uunartoq Qeqertaq''', [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]] for "The Very Hot Island", is an island off the east central coast of [[Greenland]], {{convert|550|km|mi|0|abbr=off}} north of the [[Arctic Circle]]. It became recognised as an island only in September 2005, by US explorer [[Dennis Schmitt]]. It was attached to the mainland of [[Liverpool Land]] by glacial ice even in 2002, when the ice shelves began retreating rapidly in this area, so that by 2005 it was no longer attached to the mainland. Members of the scientific community believe this newly discovered island is a direct result of [[global warming]].&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;{{cite news |title=Melting glacier uncovers island |url=http://www.news.com/2300-11395_3-6179447-6.html?tag=ne.gall.pg |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120629181148/http://www.news.com/2300-11395_3-6179447-6.html?tag=ne.gall.pg |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-06-29 |publisher=CNET.com |work=Credit: USGS Landsat Project |date=2007-04-26 |accessdate=2007-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The island has three large peninsulas, and thus resembles the letter '''W''', or the Chinese character '''山''' .

==Controversy==
[[Patrick Michaels]], a climatologist and prominent [[global warming skeptic]], created a controversy over the history of Warming Island in a post on his website, [[World Climate Report]], in which he argued that the island had been previously uncovered in the 1950s toward the end of a brief warm period in Greenland.&lt;ref name="Michaels"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.worldclimatereport.com/index.php/2008/03/31/warming-island-another-global-warming-myth-exposed/|title=Warming Island: another global warming myth exposed|publisher=World Climate Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a general lack of suitably detailed maps, Michaels found a map published by Ernst Hofer, a photographer who did aerial surveys of the area in the early 1950s, which showed the Warming Island landmass unconnected to Greenland.&lt;ref name="Hofer"&gt;{{citation|title=World Climate Report reproducing map from Hofer, Ernst, 1957. Arctic Riviera:North-East Greenland, Kümmerly &amp; Frey Berne Geographical Publishers, Berne, Switzerland, Distributed in the U.S. by Rand McNally &amp; Co., Chicago, pp. 125.|url=http://worldcat.org/wcpa/ow/89e9717051aacde0.html|oclc=486572|date=1957|publisher=Berne, Kümmerly &amp; Frey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michaels concluded therefore that Warming Island was also a separate island when observed by Hofer in the 1950s, and more broadly that Warming Island is an example of unjustified concern about the future outcomes of global warming.&lt;ref name="Michaels"/&gt;

Dennis Schmitt countered Michaels' theory in an article by New York Times reporter Andy Revkin, contending that Hofer's map is inaccurate. Citing discrepancies such as the absence on Hofer's map of nearby Reynolds Island, he suggested that the discrepant features are consistent with an aerial view of the area when covered with fog, which has often obscured low-lying areas like Reynold's Island and the ice-bridge connecting Warming Island to the Greenlandic mainland. He further observed, "I see by the markings of the 1957 document that it is to be construed as indeed only schematic, that it is explicitly incomplete."&lt;ref name="Revkin"&gt;{{citation|url=http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/28/arctic-explorer-rebuts-critique-of-warming-island/?pagemode=print|publisher=New York Times|title=Arctic explorer rebuts critique of Warming Island | first=Andrew C. | last=Revkin | date=2008-04-28 | accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michaels explained that Hofer included the map in his book "so as to place his pictures and stories in context."&lt;ref name="Michaels"/&gt;

No photographic evidence is available that would resolve the issue.

The island was also part of a 2011 controversy when it was included in the ''[[Times Atlas of the World]]'', along with a revised depiction of the [[Greenland ice sheet]] that showed a 15% reduction. After being alerted through the media, the U.S. [[National Snow and Ice Data Center]] reported that the atlas editors must have used a 2001 map showing only the thickest segment of the ice sheet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/09/atlas-shrugged-outraged-glaciologists.html?rss=1|title=UPDATED: Atlas Shrugged?

The '''Vietnam War body count controversy '''centers on the counting of enemy dead by the US forces during the [[Vietnam War]] with issues around killing and counting unarmed civilians as enemy combatants as well as inflating the number of actual enemy KIA.  For search and destroy operations, as the objective was not to hold territory or secure populations victory was assessed by having a higher enemy body count.

==Overview==
Since the goal of the United States in the [[Vietnam War]] was not to conquer North Vietnam but rather to ensure the survival of the South Vietnamese government, measuring progress was difficult. All the contested territory was theoretically "held" already. Instead, the US Army used body counts to show that the US was winning the war. The Army's theory was that eventually, the [[Viet Cong]] (VC) and [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) would lose after the [[attrition warfare]].

According to historian [[Christian Appy]], "[[search and destroy]] was the principal tactic; and the enemy body count was the primary measure of progress" in [[William Westmoreland|General Westmoreland’s]] war of attrition. Search and destroy was coined as a phrase in 1965 to describe missions aimed at flushing the VC out of hiding, while the body count was the measuring stick for the success of any operation. Since the early stages of the war did not seek to hold territory, assessments of whether an operation was considered a victory or not was entirely based on having a higher enemy killed ratio for US commanders. &lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a096431.pdf|title=Declassification of the BDM Study, "The Strategic Lessons Learned in Vietnam"|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Defense Technical Center|pages=225–34|access-date=}}{{dead link|date=August 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;Competitions were held between units for the highest number of VC/PAVN killed in action, or KIAs. Army and marine officers knew that promotions were largely based on confirmed kills.{{cn|date=November 2018}} The pressure to produce confirmed kills resulted in massive fraud. One study revealed that 61% of American commanders considered that body counts were grossly exaggerated.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-01-31/news/mn-442_1_body-count|title=In This War, Body Count Is Ruled Out : Casualties: Gen.

== Killing and Counting Unarmed Civilians ==
It was estimated that around 220,000 civilians killed by US/ARVN operations were miscounted as "enemy KIA" as when [[free-fire zones]] were declared it was erroneously assumed all individuals were enemy combatants&lt;ref name=Bellamy&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=spc4DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;|title=East Asia's Other Miracle: Explaining the Decline of Mass Atrocities|last=Bellamy|first=Alex J.|date=2017-09-29|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780191083785|location=|pages=33–34|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For official US military operations reports, there are no distinctions between enemy KIA and civilian KIA since it was assumed by US forces that an area declared a free-fire zone that all individuals killed regardless of whether they were combatants or civilians were considered enemy KIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thevietnamwar.info/free-fire-zone/|title=Free Fire Zone - The Vietnam War|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Appy&gt;{{Cite book|title=Working-Class War: American Combat Soldiers and Vietnam|last=Appy|first=Christian|publisher=UNC Chapel Hill|year=1993|isbn=|location=http://projectsmrj.pbworks.com/f/Working+Class+War+-+Christian+Appy.pdf|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}} Since body counts was a direct measure of operational success this often caused US battle reports to list civilians killed as enemy KIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/body-count-in-vietnam.htm|title=Body Count in Vietnam {{!}} HistoryNet|website=www.historynet.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of civilians killed led to the enormous discrepancy between weapons seized and 'enemy KIA' during [[Operation Speedy Express]], nearly 10,000 KIA with just 748 weapons found. Most of the enemy killed included were unarmed civilians.&lt;ref name=Bellamy/&gt; The [[My Lai Massacre]] and [[Son Thang massacre]] both reported women and children killed as "enemy combatants".

Former Marine Officer and later war-time corresponding [[Philip Caputo]] in the book [[A Rumor of War]] noted:&lt;blockquote&gt;''General Westmoreland’s strategy of attrition also had an important effect on our behavior. Our mission was not to win terrain or seize positions, but simply to kill: to kill communists and as many of them as possible. Stack ’em like cordwood. Victory was a high body-count, defeat a low kill-ratio, war a matter of arithmetic. The pressure on unit commanders to produce enemy corpses was intense, and they in turn communicated it to their troops. This led to such practices as counting civilians as Viet Cong. ‘If it’s dead and Vietnamese, it’s VC,’ was our rule of thumb in the bush. It is not surprising, therefore, that some men acquired a contempt for human life and predilection for taking it.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=DMeJDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA156|title=The Vietnam Reader: The Definitive Collection of American Fiction and Nonfiction on the War|last=O'Nan|first=Stewart|last2=Caputo|first2=Philip|date=1998|publisher=Anchor Books|year=|isbn=9780385491181|location=|pages=156|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Christian Appy]] in ''Working Class War'' documents widespread atrocities committed by US forces, especially towards the latter 'withdrawal' period as well.&lt;ref name=Appy/&gt;{{rp|267–78}} Accidental or deliberate killings through napalming, artillery and others were reported to have frequently either been re-attributed to the PAVN/VC or claimed as "VC" casualties by US forces.&lt;ref name=Appy/&gt;{{rp|267-78}} Other reported incidents include the ambushing or attacking unarmed groups of men such as fishermen or farmers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=vQpe_he59K4C&amp;pg=PA43|title=After the Massacre: Commemoration and Consolation in Ha My and My Lai|last=Kwon|first=Heonik|last2=Kwŏn|first2=Hŏn-ik|date=2006|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520247963|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were reported as "Viet Cong" as well as any civilians wearing black pajamas and civilians running away from helicopters, including women and children who were again reported as "enemy combatants" KIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=PeFK5dkYZsEC|title=Kill Anything That Moves: The Real American War in Vietnam|last=Turse|first=Nick|date=2013-01-15|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|year=|isbn=9780805095470|location=|pages=121–128|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; One notable example of this was the purported killing of hundreds of unarmed civilians by [[Tiger Force]], following grievous losses from a PAVN ambush, in which the unit proceeded to kill countless women, children and crippled individuals during [[Operation Wheeler/Wallowa]].&lt;ref name=Ward&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=i4KyDQAAQBAJ|title=The Vietnam War: An Intimate History|last=Ward|first=Geoffrey C.|last2=Burns|first2=Ken|date=2017-09-05|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|year=|isbn=9781524733100|location=|pages=235–238|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Jonathan Schell]] who reported on [[Operation Cedar Falls]] observed the general inability of US forces to discern VC from unarmed civilians during, based on tacit ignorance of the culture and the murder of civilians on whim or suspicion, for example in which a man riding a bicycle past a patrol near his town was shot and subsequently declared a VC, and the shooting of a woman carrying medical supplies, who was then declared an enemy combatant serving as a medic post-mortem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schell|first=Jonathan|title=The Village of Ben Suc|journal=The New Yorker|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1967/07/15/the-village-of-ben-suc|date=15 July 1967|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Body Count Inflation ==
In the summer of 1970, [[H. Norman Schwarzkopf]] writes, "the Army War College issued a scathing report," that, among other things, "criticised the Army's obsession with meaningless statistics and was especially damning on the subject of body counts in Vietnam. A young captain had told the investigators a sickening story: he'd been under so much pressure from headquarters to boost his numbers that he'd nearly gotten into a fistfight with a South Vietnamese officer over whose unit would take credit for various enemy body parts. Many officers admitted they had simply inflated their reports to placate headquarters."&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzkopf/Petre, "It Doesn't Take A Hero," Bantam Books, 1992, 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

The junior officers queried in the 1970 "Study on Military Professionalism" (seemingly the study that Schwarzkopf refers to) had particularly violent reactions to instructions on the body count.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/the-on-going-battle-for-the-soul-of-the-army|title=The On-Going Battle for the Soul of the Army {{!}} Small Wars Journal|website=smallwarsjournal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; "They told of being given quotas and being told to go out and recount until they had sufficient numbers. “Nobody out there believes the body count,” was the reportedly common response."

In [[Lewis Sorley]]'s book ''A Better War'', published in 1999 after studies of voluminous previously-secret papers of [[Creighton Abrams]], he writes "Body count may have been the most corrupt - and corrupting - measure of progress in the whole mess. Certainly the consensus of senior Army leaders, the generals who commanded in Vietnam, strongly indicates that it was. A survey found that sixty-one percent of officers believed that the body count was often inflated. Typical comments by the respondents were that it was "a fake - totally worthless," that "the immensity of the false reporting is a blot on the honor of the Army," and that they were grossly exaggerated by many units primarily because of the incredible interest shown by people like McNamara and Westmoreland."&lt;ref name=Sorley&gt;{{cite book|last=Sorley|first=Lewis|title=A Better War: The Unexamined Victories and Final Tragedy of America's Last Years in Vietnam|publisher=Harvest|year=2007|isbn=9780156013093|pages=21–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Secretary of Defense]] [[Chuck Hagel|Charles Hagel]] states that U.S. commanders on the ground inflated body counts since this was how their success was judged."You used that body count, commanding officers did, as the metric and measurement of how successful you were...", hence providing a positive incentive for deliberate fabrication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postmortem/2009/08/vietnam_still_resonates_in_the.html|title=A Vietnam War That Never Ends|author=Patricia Sullivan|date=5 August 2009|accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Battle of Dak To]] and [[the Battle of the Slopes]], one company commander alleges after losing 78 men while finding 10 enemy bodies, the "enemy body count" figures was deliberately re-written as 475 by General [[William Westmoreland]] and released as official operational reports.&lt;ref name=Ward/&gt;{{rp|193}}

Shelby Stanton states that accurate assessments of PAVN and VC losses were largely impossible due to lack of corresponding statistics, the fact that allied ground units were often unable to confirm artillery and aerial kills and gamesmanship practised by units under pressure to "produce results." American losses were subject to statistical manipulation as well. For instance, dying soldiers put aboard medical evacuation helicopters were often counted as only wounded in unit after-action tables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Rise_and_Fall_of_an_American_Army.html?id=nm-ov7lIe_AC&amp;redir_esc=y|title=The Rise and Fall of an American Army|last=Stanton|first=Shelby L.|date=2003|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|year=|isbn=9780891418276|location=|pages=xvi-xvii|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Mark Woodruff states that when the Vietnamese Government released its actual losses in April 1995 as being 1.1&amp;nbsp;million dead, US body count figures he claimed they had actually underestimated communist losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodruff|first=Mark|title=Unheralded Victory: Who won the Vietnam war?|publisher=Harper Collins|year=1999|isbn=0004725190|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vivian Davis Chase''' (c. 1902 – November 2, 1935) was a [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] gangster of the 1920s and 1930s.

==Early life==
During the Midwest crime wave of the 1930s, Chase was a notorious criminal.  She kept her origins a well-guarded secret, as she once threatened to kill a lover if he ever disclosed her family's location.&lt;ref name="Bureau of Investigation Internal Case File (FBI)"&gt;{{cite book|year=1934|title=FBI File 7-88-249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers interested in her case have most often been led to dead ends in the difficult search for Chase's origin. The historical record for Chase only begins in 1920, when the January 1920 United States Census reported eighteen-year-old Vivian Davis was living single in Kansas City, Missouri at 706 E. 14th Street. Her occupation was listed as waitress in a restaurant and her parents were listed as natives to Missouri, although she was not living with them.&lt;ref name="US Census 1920 Missouri"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancestry.com|url=http://Ancestry.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another solid historical document discovered for Chase is her marriage certificate with George M. Chase.  On April 1, 1921, 19-year-old Vivian Davis married George M. Chase also of Kansas City, Mo.&lt;ref name="Missouri Marriage Certificate"&gt;{{cite web|title=Marriage Certificate|publisher=Missouri State}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chase has often been confused with Vivian Grace Davis of Springfield, Missouri, who died on February 5, 1920,&lt;ref name="Death Certificate Vivian G. Chase"&gt;{{cite web|title=Certificate of Death|url=http://www.sos.mo.gov/images/archives/deathcerts/1920/1920_00006148.PDF|work=Missouri State Board of Health }}&lt;/ref&gt; or with Albert and Sarah Davis, but it has been proven that they are not the same person.

==Arrests, escapes and notoriety==
Chase first gained notice as George's wife on December 23, 1923, when he was arrested for an altercation during which he was shot by Ella Keller. Keller stated that George and his companions attacked her because she had reported them to the police and that she had to shoot George in self-defense.  After arresting George, the police went to his home, where they found Chase wearing six diamond rings.  Chase was arrested for suspicion when she could not explain her possession of the multiple rings.  She was released after three days when further evidence could not be found against her.&lt;ref&gt;''Kansas City Times'', December 26, 1923&lt;/ref&gt;

Chase did not surface in public records again until three years later, when she was in the company of Charlie Mayes, also known as Pighead Hardman. On February 15, 1926, Chase, Mayes, and Lee Flournoy and his wife were arrested after a free-for-all fight in a rooming house in [[Wichita, Kansas]]. During the arrest, Chase refused to talk.&lt;ref&gt;''Wichita Beacon'', February 16, 1926&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation led investigators to her brother-in-law Charles Chase and allegations of involvement with the Joe Bratton liquor gang.&lt;ref&gt;''Wichita Eagle'', February 17, 1926&lt;/ref&gt; On June 9, 1926, following a "drunken party and joy ride", Flournoy and Mayes were fatally shot in a gun battle in [[Picher, Oklahoma]] during which Chase was present. The three of them had been under surveillance by [[Ottawa County, Oklahoma]] officers for several days because the deputy sheriff had informed the Sheriff of [[Montgomery County, Kansas]] that he had found the suspects who robbed the Cherryvale Bank on May 29, 1926.  Chase was placed in jail, where she refused to face reporters.&lt;ref&gt;''Miami News Record'', June 10, 1926&lt;/ref&gt;  She was released on June 13, 1926, after insufficient evidence was found to charge her with a crime.&lt;ref&gt;''Miami News Record'', June 13, 1926&lt;/ref&gt;

The record once again went silent on Chase until she resurfaced in June 1932. She was arrested with Jackie Forman and Enos Weeks for the robbery of the First National Bank in North Kansas City on April 9, 1932. She was held on $50,000 bond. It was a small robbery; no more than $1,500 was taken. Chase was held at the Clay County Jail in [[Liberty, Missouri]] and escaped after four months by sawing through the bars of her cell and lowering herself down with a rope made of bed sheets.&lt;ref&gt;''Kansas City Times'', June 8, 1932&lt;/ref&gt;

After her escape from the Liberty jail, Chase fled to [[St. Louis, Missouri]], where she became involved with Walter (Irish) O'Malley. On July 10, 1933, she participated in the kidnapping of banker August Luer. Chase, O'Malley, and Percy 'Dice Box' Fitzgerald drove to Mr. Luer's home in [[Alton, Illinois]]. Chase, accompanied by O'Malley, rang the doorbell and requested to use the phone. When she was let in and shown the phone's location, she cut the line. O'Malley wrestled August Luer to the floor and gagged his mouth. Luer was taken to a farm where he was hidden in a damp underground cellar while his captors tried to collect a [[ransom]] for him. Luer was not a well man, and fearing that he would die before they were able to receive any ransom, his kidnappers released him after 123 hours. Both Chase and O'Malley fled from Illinois back to Missouri after the bungled kidnapping. Chase eluded capture, but O'Malley only managed to do so for two years until he was apprehended in Kansas City on May 23, 1935.&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Morgan:  "Irish O'Malley &amp; the Ozark Mountain Boys" (unpublished)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early fall of 1935, [[Kansas City, Missouri]] experienced a series of drug store robberies.  The robbers were described as a man and a woman. The woman was further described as approximately 5&amp;nbsp;ft. 6 in. tall, slender, with [[henna]]ed hair. When victims were shown a photograph, they identified Chase as the female robber.

==Death and afterward==
On November 3, 1935, Chase's body was found in a parked car at Saint Luke's Hospital in Kansas City, MO. She had been shot in the neck with a .45 caliber gun, the bullet exiting through her chest.&lt;ref&gt;''Kansas City Journal-Post'', November 4, 1935&lt;/ref&gt; When she was found, the coroner estimated that she had only been dead 2 hours or less, leading to speculation that her killer drove her to the hospital while she was still alive, expecting her to be found before her death. She had a .22 caliber pistol on her person, with .45 caliber bullets in her handbag. Newspapers speculated that she had been double-crossed by an accomplice and was shot before she could shoot her assailant.

Chase seemed destined for burial in a [[potter's field]]. The owner of the [[funeral home]] to where she had been removed received an anonymous call asking about funeral costs. The next morning, the funeral home received an envelope of money for the costs, as well as a blue dress and undergarments (her own) for Chase to be buried in. Nine mourners outside of reporters and law enforcement officers attended her funeral. No-one signed the guest book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gun Woman Is Buried |work=Kansas City Times |date=November 9, 1935 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9746">One of the premier collections on the World Wide Web for the teaching of [[History of the United States|U.S. history]], '''Women and Social Movements in the United States, 1600 to 2000''',  includes (as of March 2014) 110 document projects with almost 4,350 documents and more than 153,000 pages of additional full-text sources relating to  U.S. [[women's history]].

Bi-annual releases (generally March and September) include not only new document projects and full-text sources, but also reviews of It also book, film, and web site.  An enhanced search engine offers extensive metadata filters for both document projects and full text sources.

== History ==

===Origins===
Women and Social Movements in the United States, 1600 to 2000, began in 1997 with a small grant from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Kish Sklar and Thomas Dublin, "Creating Meaning in a Sea of Information: The Women and Social Movements Sites" in Jack Dougherty and Kristen Nawrotzki eds, ''[http://writinghistory.trincoll.edu/data/sklar-dublin-2012-spring/ Writing History in the Digital Age]'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2013), 146-158.&lt;/ref&gt; For six years,  Kathryn Kish Sklar and her students at [[Binghamton University|SUNY Binghamton]] developed document projects consisting of 20-30 transcribed documents focused around a historiographic question.  Students not only transcribed the primary source documents, but also learned the necessary HTML for the placement of the project on the course web site.   Document projects proved an ideal form for combining the internet’s spaciousness with the historian’s craft of working with primary sources.   At the end of the first semester of teaching this senior seminar, Kathryn Sklar was joined by Thomas Dublin, her colleague at SUNY Binghamton, in creating an innovative website for the documentary projects, adding his knowledge of U.S. women's history and his experience with the use of computers in historical research. The first document project went live on a public web site in December 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chswg.binghamton.edu/sklararticle.htm|title= Kathryn Kish Sklar, "Teaching Students to Become Producers of New Historical Knowledge on the Web," ''Journal of American History'' 88 (March 2002): 1471-76.|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women and Social Movements website grew rapidly. In 2001, with a second NEH grant, the editors began a collaboration with eleven faculty from other colleges and universities around the country. By the end of 2002, the website offered 43 documentary projects, authored in part by undergraduate students, which interpreted about 1,000 documents ranging in time from 1775 to 2000. The site attracted about 30,000 viewers a month from more than ninety countries. Yet two aspects of the website were not sustainable: the intensive labor needed to transform student work into authoritative scholarly analysis; and the initial sources of the site's funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historians.org/Perspectives/issues/2009/0905/0905for9.cfm|title=  Kathryn Kish Sklar and Thomas Dublin, "Keeping Up with the Web, 1997-2008: Women and Social Movements in the United States," ''Perspectives on History'' 47:5 (May 2009). |publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This combination of success and challenges prompted a reconception of the Women and Social Movements website in the spring of 2002. Convinced that the technology and the format of the website were ideally matched to generate new knowledge in U.S. Women's History, Sklar and Dublin decided to encourage faculty and advanced graduate students to author document projects for the site. That effort proved remarkably successful; the website now includes document projects and archives from a wide range of scholars drawing on their specialized knowledge of women and social movements. Sklar and Dublin established an Editorial Board for the website as well as guidelines for submissions with blind peer review.

===Alexander Street Press===
Yet despite this expansion, in the spring of 2002 the site’s future seemed uncertain because grant funding was no longer available (the site was no longer experimental), and the editors were unable to locate new sources of funding for the staff of graduate students who maintained the site and made its expansion possible. This funding dilemma was solved when Stephen Rhind-Tutt of [[Alexander Street Press]], approached the editors and suggested that they consider publishing jointly with ASP. The press could fund the website’s costs through library subscriptions to the site. In 2003 the editors decided to publish jointly with ASP. This relationship has provided stability for the website and facilitated its expansion.&lt;ref name="chswg.binghamton.edu"&gt;[http://chswg.binghamton.edu/Launching%20a%20New%20Journal.pdf  Kathryn Kish Sklar and Thomas Dublin, "Launching a New Journal: Women and Social Movements in the United States, 1600-2000," ''Women's History Review'' 17, no. 1 (February 2008): 95-101.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2004 ''Women and Social Movements,'' which now published quarterly,  began to include digitized versions of books and pamphlets related to women and social movements in the U.S. Initially these volumes focused on one hundred years of the [[women's suffrage in the United States|woman suffrage movement]], 1830–1930, including the six volumes of ''[[History of Woman Suffrage|The History of Woman Suffrage (1881–1922)]]'' edited by [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], [[Susan B. Anthony]], and other leaders of the woman suffrage movement and all the proceedings of the three national conventions of anti-slavery women held in the 1830s and of the [[Seneca Falls Convention]] and the [[National Women's Rights Convention]]s held between 1848 and 1870. Alexander Street Press has provided detailed indexing and database searching for these and other resources on the site, greatly improving its scholarly utility. A Dictionary of Social Movements and a Chronology of U.S. Women's History, both especially prepared for the website, provide users unique subject access to both document projects and full-text sources on the site. Book reviews and website reviews were also incorporated into each issue.&lt;ref name="chswg.binghamton.edu" /&gt;

===Scholar's Edition===
In March 2007 Sklar and Dublin began co-publishing with Alexander Street Press a greatly expanded version of the database—the Scholar’s Edition of Women and Social Movements. This edition features an online archive of all publications by federal, state, and local commissions on the status of women since 1963. Constituting 90,000 pages of documents collected from over 300 repositories, these commission publications offer a major new set of sources for research on the lives of American women since 1960. In addition, the Scholar’s Edition includes the first electronic version of [[Harvard University Press]]'s five-volume biographical dictionary, ''Notable American Women (1971–2004)'', which is fully indexed and searchable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women and Social Movements in the United States, 1600 to 2000|url=http://alexanderstreet.com/products/women-and-social-movements-united-states-1600-2000|publisher=Alexander Street Press|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Volume 13 (2009) the publication schedule of Women and Social Movements became semi-annual, publishing in the spring (March) and fall (September) due to the larger size of each issue requiring a longer production schedule.   Each issue now includes three document projects or document archives—along with book reviews, notes from the archive, teaching tools, and full text sources.

===International Edition===
With the assistance of a large advisory board, Sklar and Dublin developed an ambitious plan to create an online archive of women's international activism.  The two traveled extensively, and ultimately, materials from over 250 libraries in the US and abroad, were included in a second International database.  [http://wasi.alexanderstreet.com/%20 Women and Social Movements International 1840 to Present], began in 2008, was completed in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wasi.alexanderstreet.com/help/view/about_women_and_social_movements_international About Women and Social Movements, International, by co-editors Kathryn Kish Sklar and Thomas Dublin].&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of 25 scholarly essays, over 4,600 sources of published and manuscript resources, as well as links to 124 online resources.  The database includes the same metadata rich search functions as the U.S. version, but also allows users to create their own playlists of documents, images, and videos.&lt;ref&gt;“[http://www.historyworkshop.org.uk/review-women-and-social-movements-international-1840-to-the-present/ Review: Women and Social Movements International, 1840 to the Present],” History Workshop, accessed March 2, 2014, .&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Women in society sidebar}}
The roles of '''women in France''' have changed throughout history. In 1944, French women obtained [[women's suffrage]]. As in other Western countries, the role of women underwent many social and legal changes in the 1960s and 1970s. [[French feminism]], which has its origins in the [[French Revolution]],  has been quite influential in the 20th century with regard to abstract ideology,  especially through the writings of [[Simone de Beauvoir]].

==History==
The [[gender roles|traditional role]] of women in [[Culture of France|French society]] involves domestic duties such as housekeeping, [[French cuisine|preparation of meals]] in the customary fashion that involves a "succession of courses eaten one at a time", child rearing, harvesting of crops, and tending to farm animals. Upon the onset of the [[industrial revolution]] in France, women's role changed with them becoming domestic helpers, factory workers, and washerwomen. This did not generally include women who had "bourgeois" status, because these women often became dependent on the financial support of their husbands; such women of upper-class status also had the tendency to send their own "children to wet nurses until"  weaned. Further changes to the status of women in France became apparent in 1944, when French women gained the right to vote. But it was only during the 1960s when they won the right to work without getting permission from their husbands, in addition to the right to open personal bank accounts. At present, due to effective health care provision in the country, the life-span of women is at an average of 80.9 years old. So-called "infant allowances" are available to subscribing pregnant women and their newborn children. In 1988, the unemployment rate among the French population was described to be "higher among women".&lt;ref name=EC&gt;[http://www.everyculture.com/Cr-Ga/France.html#b France], everyculture.com&lt;/ref&gt; However, in modern-day France, women who have attained a "suitable level of education" and training are gaining prominent positions in the fields of business and the engineering industry, particularly within [[Paris]],&lt;ref name=WBC&gt;[http://www.worldbusinessculture.com/Women-in-Business-in-France.html Women in Business in France], worldbusinessculture.com&lt;/ref&gt; the [[capital city]] of France. 
===Education===
Educational aspirations were on the rise and were becoming increasingly institutionalised in order to supply the church and state with the functionaries to serve as their future administrators.  Girls were schooled too, but not to assume political responsibility. Girls were ineligible for leadership positions and were generally considered to have an inferior intellect to their brothers. France had many small local schools where working-class children - both boys and girls - learned to read, the better "to know, love, and serve God." The sons and daughters of the noble and bourgeois elites were given gender-specific educations: boys were sent to upper school, perhaps a university, while their sisters - if they were lucky enough to leave the house - would be sent to board at a convent with a vague curriculum. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] challenged this model, but no real alternative was presented for female education. Only through education at home were knowledgeable women formed, usually to the sole end of dazzling their salons.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn C. Lougee, "'Noblesse,' Domesticity, and Social Reform: The Education of Girls by Fenelon and Saint-Cyr", ''History of Education Quarterly'' 1974 14(1): 87-113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linda L. Clark, ''Schooling the Daughters of Marianne: Textbooks and the Socialization of Girls in Modern French Primary Schools'' (SUNY Press, 1984) [http://hdl.handle.net/2027/heb.04489.0001.001 online].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproductive rights and health==
{{see|Abortion in France}}
Women in France obtained many [[reproductive rights]] in the second half of the 20th century.
The [[Neuwirth Law|Neuwirth Act of 1967]] authorized [[contraception]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.france.fr/en/institutions-and-values/changes-role-women-french-society.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Simone Veil|Veil Law]] of 1975 legalized abortion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.france.fr/en/institutions-and-values/changes-role-women-french-society.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[maternal mortality]] rate in France is 8.00 deaths/100,000 live births (as of 2010).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2223rank.html&lt;/ref&gt; France's [[HIV/AIDS]] rate is 0.4% of adults (aged 15-49) - estimates of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2155rank.html&lt;/ref&gt;
France has been one of the first countries to take legal action against [[female genital mutilation]] (which occurs in its immigrant communities) and to prosecute those who perform the practice.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ambafrance-uk.org/France-a-pioneer-in&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14713&amp;LangID=E&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family life==
[[File:Non marital by countries.gif|300px|thumb|left|Percentage of births to unmarried women, in selected countries, including France, 1980 and 2007.&lt;ref name="non_mar1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db18.htm|title=Changing Patterns of Nonmarital Childbearing in the United States |work=CDC/National Center for Health Statistics|date=May 13, 2009|accessdate=September 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in other Western countries, in France the percentage of children born outside of marriage has increased markedly during the past decades.]]
In common with other countries in [[List of Mediterranean countries| Mediterranean Europe]] and of [[Roman Catholic]] tradition, French organization of family life has traditionally been [[conservative]], founded on distinct [[gender roles]]. Under the [[Napoleonic Code]], married women were subordinated to the husband's authority.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/crs1_low.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Married French women obtained the right to work without their husband's consent in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/explore/cmcf-vsi-women-in-france.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The paternal authority of a man over his family was ended in 1970 (before that, parental responsibilities belonged solely to the father who made all legal decisions concerning the children); and a new reform in 1985 abolished the stipulation that the father had the sole power to administer the children's property.&lt;ref&gt;http://ceflonline.net/wp-content/uploads/France-Parental-Responsibilities.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; [[Adultery]] was decriminalized in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2015/02/18/01016-20150218ARTFIG00358-l-adultere-en-un-clic-la-justice-saisie-contre-gleeden.php&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, France introduced [[Pacte civil de solidarité|PACS]] (a [[civil union]], known as "civil solidarity pact", which can be contracted both by heterosexual and by same-sex couples). In 2005, France reformed its [[divorce law]]s, simplifying the procedure, in particular by reducing the separation period, necessary before a divorce in certain circumstances, from 6 years to 2 years; there are now four types of divorce that can be obtained (divorce by mutual consent; divorce by acceptance; hostile divorce; divorce for separation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.angloinfo.com/france/how-to/page/france-family-marriage-partnerships-divorce|title=Divorce in France|website=Angloinfo France|publisher=[[Angloinfo]]|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past decades, social views on the traditional family have changed markedly, which is reflected in the high proportion of [[cohabitation]] and births outside of marriage, and in a questioning of traditional expectations regarding the family; in the European Values Study (EVS) of 2008, 35.4% of respondents in France agreed with the assertion that "Marriage is an outdated institution".&lt;ref&gt;[http://zacat.gesis.org/webview/index.jsp?study=http%3A%2F%2F193.175.238.79%3A80%2Fobj%2FfStudy%2FZA4783&amp;variable=http%3A%2F%2F193.175.238.79%3A80%2Fobj%2FfVariable%2FZA4783_V252&amp;mode=documentation&amp;submode=variable&amp;top=yes&amp;language=en] See for each country: Variable Description - Family - Q 45.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2014, 58% of children were born outside of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau.asp?reg_id=0&amp;ref_id=NATnon02231&lt;/ref&gt; In France, legal reforms regarding the "[[illegitimacy]]" of children (born outside of marriage) began in the 1970s, but it was only in the 21st century that the principle of equality was fully upheld (through Act no. 2002-305 of 4 March 2002, removing mention of "illegitimacy" — ''filiation légitime'' and ''filiation naturelle''; and through law no. 2009-61 of 16 January 2009).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dictionnaire-juridique.com/definition/autorite-parentale.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ceflonline.net/wp-content/uploads/France-Parental-Responsibilities.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000020104273&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, France was forced by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] to change several laws that were deemed discriminatory, and in 2013 the Court ruled that these changes must also be applied to children born before 2001.&lt;ref&gt;http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-116716#{%22itemid%22:[%22001-116716%22]}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminism==
{{Main|Feminism in France}}
Feminism in France has its origins in the [[French Revolution]]. Some famous figures were notable in the 19th century, including [[Louise Michel]], Russian-born [[Elisabeth Dmitrieff]] and [[Nathalie Lemel]]. French feminism encompasses a branch of feminist theories and philosophies that emerged in the 1970s to the 1990s. This French feminist theory, compared to Anglophone feminism, is distinguished by an approach which is more philosophical and literary, rather than focused on practical issues. Its writings tend to be effusive and metaphorical being less concerned with political doctrines.&lt;ref name=Moi&gt;{{cite book |author=Moi, T. |authorlink= |title=French feminist thought: a reader |year=1987 |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=978-0-631-14973-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Simone de Beauvoir]],  a French writer, intellectual, [[Existentialism|existentialist philosopher]], political activist and [[social theorist]], is a prominent feminist figure.
She is known for her 1949 treatise ''[[The Second Sex]]'', a detailed analysis of women's oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary feminism.

==Domestic violence==
In the 21st century, France has taken many steps in order to combat [[domestic violence]] and [[violence against women]], in particular by enacting ''Law No. 2010-769, of July 9, 2010, on Violence Against Women, Violence Between Spouses, and the Effects of These Types of Violence on Children''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000022454032&amp;categorieLien=id&lt;/ref&gt; France has also ratified the [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=210&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG&lt;/ref&gt;

France has a long tradition of indulgence towards [[crimes of passion]], which before 1975 were treated legally very leniently.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gallup.com/poll/107521/Common-Ground-Europeans-Muslims-Among-Them.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In France, as of 2004-2009, former and current partners were responsible for more than 80% of all cases of [[femicide|murders of women]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/H-Research_Notes/SAS-Research-Note-14.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
{{see|Religion in France|French ban on face covering}}
The traditional religion of France is [[Roman Catholicism]], but today it is no longer the state religion; and contemporary France is one of the most secular countries in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_341_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In France, [[freedom of religion]] is guaranteed by the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]. The [[French Fifth Republic|Republic]] is based on the principle of ''[[laïcité]]''  enforced by the 1880s [[Jules Ferry laws]] and the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State]]. Today, France also has a sizable [[Islam in France|Muslim population]]. In 2010, France enacted a [[French ban on face covering|ban on face covering]], prohibiting the wearing in public places of [[niqab]], [[burqa]] and similar outfits. In 2014, the [[European Court of Human Rights]]  upheld the French law, accepting the argument of the French government that the law was based on "a certain idea of living together".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/01/france-burqa-ban-upheld-human-rights-court&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28106900&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 18th century and continuing well into the 1800s, there was a large influx of talented French women painters. This is despite the fact that only a select few women were admitted into quality artistic schools, including the prestigious [[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture]]. Particularly noteworthy French women painters during the late 18th century include [[Adélaïde Labille-Guiard]], [[Anne Vallayer-Coster]], and [[Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun]]. Vallayer-Coster was prominent for her figural paintings of [[King Louis XV]]'s daughters and his daughter-in-law [[Queen Marie Antoinette]]. Antoinette and the [[Mesdames de France]], also helped Labille-Guiard and Vigée Le Brun obtain admission to the Académie which caused a huge stir among the press, who decided to pit them as rivals against each other.

The [[French Revolution]] of 1789 created a hostile environment for artists at the time, particularly those supported by the royal family. Vigée Le Brun and Vallayer-Coster, along with many other female artists, fled to other parts of Europe and Russia. Labille-Guiard, however, chose to stay and built a respectable reputation painting the faces of the Revolution. After the Revolution, lesser known women artists were able to use the now wide-open biennial [[Salon (France)]] to display their art to a more receptive audience.&lt;ref&gt;Auricchio, L. (2004, October 1). Eighteenth-Century Women Painters in France. Retrieved from http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/18wa/hd_18wa.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

After the French Revolution, the number of French women artists sharply declined. It was the monarchy who gave women artists, especially painters, the opportunities to succeed. The Royal Academy was closed down and replaced with an institution that barred the admittance of women. Some female artists close to the monarchy were even executed.&lt;ref&gt;Wolff, R. (2012, March 4). Feminism in Old France. The Wall Street Journal. Retrieved from https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204795304577223542287084590&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't until the end of the 19th century that a significant number of women were combating stereotypical [[gender role]]s.

Gender roles played a big role in hindering prospective French women's artistic careers. While drawing and painting at the amateur level was encouraged as a part of a good bourgeois education, women were not socially permitted to engage in professional careers that weren't deemed important to society and/or disrupted in the perceived women's role of being a fully functional wife and mother. Many of the artists of this time felt the need to choose between a career and marriage. Also, any female students who did receive training from a skilled artist, were given limited expectations and were generally left with the simplest of artistic tasks. In 1860, [[Marie Bracquemond]], a rising impressionist artist, quipped of her instructor, famous painter [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], "The severity of Monsieur Ingres frightened me... because he doubted the courage and perseverance of a woman in the field of painting... He would assign to them only the painting of flowers, of fruits, of still lifes, portraits and genre scenes." &lt;ref&gt;Myers, Nicole. "Women Artists in Nineteenth-Century France". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–.	http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/19wa/hd_19wa.htm (September 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1870s, life drawing classes became more open to French female students aspiring to be artists in Paris. Perhaps the most successful French woman artist in this era was [[Rosa Bonheur]], who was well known for her animal paintings as well her sculptures. At a time dominated by male artistic ability, Bonheur is received very positively and rated very well among all of her peers.&lt;ref&gt;Rosa Bonheur. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/realism/Rosa-Bonheur.html&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to reject the gender roles, she cut and maintained a short hairstyle and also requested permission from the police to wear man's pants in order to remain relatively unnoticed in farms and slaughterhouses while she painted animals and studied animal anatomy. Due to concerns like this, women were more likely to embrace movements like the [[Impressionism]] that put artistic emphasis on everyday subjects, and not historical themes, that could be painted at home. Despite these hindrances, France was still one of the leading countries for the private tutelage of artistic women at the end of the 18th century. This isn't to say France wasn't behind the times, becoming one of the last countries in Western Europe to provide women with a state-sponsored education when the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] began admitting women in 1897. 

With regard to [[French literature|literature]], France is well known for the writer [[George Sand]] (pseudonym of Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin).

'''Yazidis in Georgia''' may refer to people born in or residing in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] of full or partial [[Yazidis|Yazidi]] origin, an [[ethno-religious]] community religious group.

==History==
The Yazidi population in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] has been dwindling since the 1990s, mostly due to [[economic migration]] to neighboring [[Russia]], Western Europe and North America. According to a census carried out in 1989, there were over 30,000 Yazidis in Georgia; according to the 2002 census, however, only around 18,000 Yazidis remained in Georgia. Today they number around 12,000 (by ethnicity, approx. 8500 by religion) according to the most recent national census, including recent refugees from [[Sinjar]] in Iraq, who fled to Georgia following [[Persecution of Yazidis by ISIL|persecution by ISIL]].&lt;ref name="temple"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dfwatch.net/yazidi-temple-third-in-the-world-opened-in-tbilisi-36650|title=Yazidi temple, third in the world, opened in Tbilisi|work=DFWatch|date=2015-06-19|accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dfwatch.net/yazidis-in-tbilisi-call-on-the-world-to-stop-isis-76971-30719|title=Yazidis in Tbilisi call on the world to stop ISIS|work=Democracy &amp; Freedom Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EA.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ezidische-akademie.de/de/menschenrechte/40-menschenrechte/69-the-yezidis-of-georgia-on-the-verge-of-extinction.html|title="The Yezidis of Georgia – On the Verge of Extinction?" von Jenny Thomsen|author=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 16, 2015, Yazidis celebrated the opening of a temple and a cultural center named after Sultan Ezid in Varketili, a suburb of [[Tbilisi]]. This is the third such temple in the world after those in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] and [[Armenia]].&lt;ref name="temple" /&gt;
