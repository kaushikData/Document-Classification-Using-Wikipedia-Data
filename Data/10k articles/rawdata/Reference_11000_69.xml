'''''A Practical Reference to Religious and Spiritual Diversity for Operational Police''''' is a publication of the Australia New Zealand Policing Advisory Agency.

==History==
The ''National Police Ethnic Advisory Bureau'' conducted a nationwide survey in Australia and identified questions ''operational'' police had regarding religious determined behaviors and their impact on policing (see 1st ed. forward) in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Document Details|work=Abstract Database|publisher=US National Criminal Justice Reference Service|date=|url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/abstractdb/AbstractDBDetails.aspx?id=183016|accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dunn"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunn|first=Andy|title=Two-Way Tolerance|journal=Police Journal Online|volume=81|issue=06|publisher=The Police Association of South Australia|date=June 2000|url=http://www.policejournalsa.org.au/0006/17a.html|accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Chilana|first=Rajwant Singh|title=International bibliography of Sikh studies|publisher=Springer|year=2005|location=|page=444|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wEX-98eVyBcC&amp;lpg=PA444&amp;pg=PA444#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=978-1-4020-3043-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition covered [[Buddhist]], [[Hindu]], [[Islamic]], [[Jewish]] and [[Sikh]] faiths with participation of representatives of the various religions. Religion Statistics for National totals and by State and Territories from census 1996 were also included.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Practical Reference to Religious Diversity for Operational Police|publisher=National Police Ethnic Advisory Bureau|edition=1st|year=1999|pages=|url=http://www.apmab.gov.au/guide/religious/religious.pdf|isbn=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030316104007/http://www.apmab.gov.au/guide/religious/religious.pdf|archivedate=16 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sponsored by a collection of multicultural organizations from across Australia. It offered a two-page summary of the religion, issues on death, gender roles, sensitivity issues (gestures or interactions that cause offence), how to allow the taking of an oath, possible conflicts with religious calendars or events, and dealing with proper behavior at temples and members of its staff. The second edition added Christian, Australian [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] and [[Torres Strait Islander]] religions and [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] to the list of religions and included data from the 2001 census when published in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Practical Reference to Religious Diversity for Operational Police|publisher=Australasian Police Multicultural Advisory Bureau|edition=2nd|year=2002|pages=|url=http://www.apmab.gov.au/guide/religious2/religious_guide.pdf|isbn=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050619070219/http://www.apmab.gov.au/guide/religious2/religious_guide.pdf|archivedate=19 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty thousand copies were printed and distributed.&lt;ref name="spencer"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Spencer|first=Robert|title=Open Season on Muslim Women|newspaper=FrontPageMagazine.com|date=1 November 2005|url=http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=6744|accessdate=8 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third edition was planned for publication in 2006-07&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Audit of Initiatives Related to Police and Muslim Communities|work=Race Discrimination|publisher=Australian Human Rights Commission|date=|url=http://humanrights.gov.au/racial_discrimination/unlocking_doors/audit.html|accessdate=28 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100511051549/http://www.humanrights.gov.au/racial_discrimination/unlocking_doors/audit.html| archivedate= 11 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bench"&gt;{{Cite book|editor-last=Lumley|editor-first=Kate|title=Equality before the Law Bench Book|publisher=Judicial Commission of New South Wales|origyear=June 2006|date=November 2007|pages=4105–4218 (whole of section 4.2)|url=http://www.judcom.nsw.gov.au/publications/benchbks/equality/section04.pdf|isbn=0-7313-5612-8|access-date=28 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912220916/http://www.judcom.nsw.gov.au/publications/benchbks/equality/section04.pdf|archive-date=12 September 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was still in development in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Religious diversity for police |journal=Evoca |volume=2009 |issue=144 |page=4 |publisher=The Ethnic Communities Council of Queensland Ltd. |date=February 2009 |url=http://www.eccq.com.au/downloads/Publications/EVOCA/Evoca%20Feb%2009.pdf |accessdate=28 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930141802/http://www.eccq.com.au/downloads/Publications/EVOCA/Evoca%20Feb%2009.pdf |archivedate=30 September 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2005 a publication along the same lines was produced by the Mäori Pacific Ethnic Services, Office of the Commissioner, for New Zealand Police covering [[Māori religion]], Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judiams, and Sikhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Practical Reference to Religious Diversity|publisher=Māori Pacific Ethnic Services, Office of the Commissioner|date=June 2005|pages=55|url=http://www.police.govt.nz/resources/2005/religious-diversity/index.html|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It acknowledged the Australian publication's producers for "…a number of photographs and text on which to base the New Zealand version…". Another edition of the New Zealand document appears to have been published in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/127282.htm|title=International Religious Freedom Report 2009: New Zealand|date=26 October 2009|accessdate=28 April 2010|author=((Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor))|publisher=United States State Department}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Statement on Religious Diversity |journal=Te Korowai Whakapono; Religious Diversity Network |volume=2009 |issue=April |pages=Online |publisher=Human Rights Commission |date=20 April 2009 |url=http://www.hrc.co.nz/newsletters/diversity-action-programme/te-korowai-whakapono/2009/04/statement-on-religious-diversity/ |issn=1178-0924 |accessdate=28 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116214024/http://www.hrc.co.nz/newsletters/diversity-action-programme/te-korowai-whakapono/2009/04/statement-on-religious-diversity/ |archivedate=16 November 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Zealand edition also had appendices outlining: information from the [[United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]], [[Treaty of Waitangi]] and religious freedom, religious affiliations government statistics in New Zealand, and artworks at the [[Royal New Zealand Police College]].
In 2010, the Australia New Zealand Policing Advisory Agency updated the Practical Reference to Religious and Spiritual Diversity for Operational Police. The Reference "provides police with a greater understanding of religious and spiritual diversity and to enhance services to the community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.anzpaa.org.au/upload/pubs/ANZPAA%20-%20Religious%20and%20Spiritual%20Diversity%20Reference%203rd.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326112405/http://www.anzpaa.org.au/upload/pubs/ANZPAA%20-%20Religious%20and%20Spiritual%20Diversity%20Reference%203rd.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This third edition has been enhanced, updated and further informed by the feedback received from police jurisdictions, religious communities, individuals 
and government agencies. New to the third edition: 
* the inclusion of Maori spirituality (nine spiritualities and religions are now included; the previous edition had eight)
* a review of the content so it provides essential information and advice on issues that police should know (i.e. on interviewing, searches, death etc.) 
* a quick reference table on the most significant operational information
* a standard set of questions for all religions 
* colour-coded tabs to assist with quick reference
* a streamlined question/answer format (the answers are all as short and succinct as possible)
* different publication formats – a handy pocket card and web version.

'''Al-Nuwayrī''', full name '''Shihāb al-Dīn Ahmad bin 'Abd al-Wahhāb al-Nuwayri''' ({{lang-ar|شهاب الدين أحمد بن عبد الوهاب النويري}}, born April 5, 1279 in [[Akhmim]], present-day Egypt&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ultimate Ambition in the Arts of Erudition|last=Al-Nuwayri|first=Shihab Al-Din|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2016|isbn=978-0-14-310748-4|location=|pages=XV|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; – died 1333) was an Egyptian [[Muslim]] historian and civil servant of the [[Bahri Mamluk]] dynasty.   He is most notable for his compilation of a 9,000-page encyclopedia of the [[Mamluk]] era, titled ''The Ultimate Ambition in the Arts of Erudition'' ({{lang|ar|نهاية الأرب في فنون الأدب}}, ''{{transl|ar|Nihayat al-arab fī funūn al-adab}}''), which pertained to [[zoology]], [[anatomy]], [[history]], [[chronology]], amongst others.&lt;ref name=Collison&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collison|first1=Robert L.|title=The Arab World|url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/186603/encyclopaedia/32036/Japan#ref307726|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known for his extensive work regarding the [[Mongols]]' [[Mongol invasions of the Levant|conquest of Syria]].

Al-Nuwayri studied at [[Al-Azhar University]] in [[Cairo]], where he specialized in the study of the [[hadith]] and the [[Prophetic biography|sira]], in addition to history.  Skilled in [[Arabic calligraphy|calligraphy]], he reportedly made a copy of ''[[Sahih al-Bukhari]]'' which he sold for 1000 [[dinar]]s. He worked as a civil servant in the administration of [[An-Nasir Muhammad]], and was in contact with the army of [[Tripoli]].

==Encyclopedia==
Al-Nuwayri's encyclopedia, ''The Ultimate Ambition in the Arts of Erudition'', covered five subjects:
* Geography and astronomy
* Man, and what relates to him
* Animals
* Plants
* History

The first four subjects comprised 10 volumes, while the last filled 21 volumes.

'''Apache LDAP API''' is an [[Open-source software|open source]] project of the [[Apache Software Foundation]] and a subproject of the [[Apache Directory]].  It's a replacement for outdated Java/LDAP libraries like (jLdap, Mozilla LDAP SDK and JNDI) and works with any [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]] server.

== History ==
The [[Apache Directory]] project was started using the '''[[Java Naming and Directory Interface|JNDI]]''' library, but many of its '''LDAP''' structures had to be developed in-house because the JNDI library was ineffective for interacting with an LDAP server.  It wasn't convenient for the project team to use JNDI which indicated to them it wouldn't be easy for typical users either.  Eventually, all of the necessary LDAP data structures (_Attribute_, _Entry_, _DN_, ...) were re-implemented by the project team.

At some point it became necessary to communicate with other LDAP servers without using the JNDI library, so a new _LdapConnection_ class was developed. This was the first step toward a full Java API specifically designed for LDAP usage on the Java platform.

After starting this effort (back in 2007), some people from '''[[Sun Microsystems|Sun]]''' (Microsystems), who was working on the '''[[OpenDJ|OpenDS]]''' project, contacted the Apache Directory project team to gauge interest in helping create a new version of JNDI. ([Resurrecting The Java LDAP Centric API](https://blogs.oracle.com/treydrake/entry/resurrecting_the_java_ldap_centric). Unfortunately, the effort stalled, as the need for '''JNDI2''' was no longer a priority for Sun. Nevertheless the Apache Directory team continued with the work but the pace was slow.

Collaboration with Sun renewed after the '''[[OpenDJ|OpenDS]]''' project team's presentation at '''LdapCon''' in 2009 ([Towards a common LDAP API for the Java Platform](http://www.symas.com/ldapcon2009/papers/poitou1.shtml)). The story repeated itself once again after '''Oracle''' bought Sun in 2010, and its project team disbanded.

Despite these fits and starts, a consensus was reached about the need for a new LDAP API and what it should be capable of doing. An agreement that these key features should be included:

* A complete coverage of the LDAP protocol
* A schema aware API
* An easy to use API
* An API taking advantage of the new Java construction (generics, ellipsis, NIO)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6487">An '''Archival Resource Key''' ('''ARK''') is a [[Uniform Resource Locator]] (URL) that is a multi-purpose [[persistent identifier]] for information objects of any type.  An ARK contains the label '''ark:''' after the URL's hostname, which sets the expectation that, when submitted to a web browser, the URL terminated by '?' returns a brief metadata record, and the URL terminated by '??' returns metadata that includes a commitment statement from the current service provider.  The ARK and its inflections ('?' and '??') provide access to three facets of a provider's ability to provide persistence.

Implicit in the design of the ARK scheme is that persistence is purely '''a matter of service''' and not a property of a naming syntax.  Moreover, that a "persistent identifier" cannot be born persistent, but an identifier from any scheme may only be proved persistent over time.  The inflections provide information with which to judge an identifier's likelihood of persistence.

ARKs can be maintained and resolved locally using open source software such as [http://search.cpan.org/dist/Noid/ Noid (Nice Opaque Identifiers)] or via services such as [http://ezid.cdlib.org EZID] and the central [http://n2t.net N2T (Name-to-Thing)] resolver.

== Structure ==
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[http://NMAH/]ark:/NAAN/Name[Qualifier]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

* '''NAAN''': Name Assigning Authority Number - mandatory unique identifier of the organization that originally named the object
* '''NMAH''': Name Mapping Authority Host - optional and replaceable hostname of an organization that currently provides service for the object
* '''Qualifier''': optional string that extends the base ARK to support access to individual '''hierarchical''' subcomponents of an object,&lt;ref&gt;Hierarchy qualifiers begin with a slash character.&lt;/ref&gt; and to '''variants''' (versions, languages, formats) of components.&lt;ref&gt;Variant qualifiers begin with a dot character.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name Assigning Authority Numbers (NAANs) ==
A complete NAAN registry&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdlib.org/services/uc3/naan_table.html Name Assigning Authority Number registry]&lt;/ref&gt; is maintained by the [[California Digital Library]] and replicated at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale de France]] and the [[National Library of Medicine|US National Library of Medicine]].

== Generic Services ==
Three generic ARK services have been defined. They are described below in protocol-independent terms. Delivering these services may be implemented through many possible methods given available technology (today’s or future).

=== Access Service (access, location) ===
*Returns (a copy of) the object or a redirect to the same, although a sensible object proxy may be substituted (for instance a table of contents instead of a large document).
*May also return a discriminated list of alternate object locators.
*If access is denied, returns an explanation of the object’s current (perhaps permanent) inaccessibility.

=== Policy Service (permanence, naming, etc.) ===
*Returns declarations of policy and support commitments for given ARKs.
*Declarations are returned in either a structured metadata format or a human readable text format; sometimes one format may serve both purposes.
*Policy subareas may be addressed in separate requests, but the following areas should be covered:
**object permanence,
**object naming,
**object fragment addressing, and
**operational service support.

=== Description Service ===
*Returns a description of the object. Descriptions are returned in either a structured metadata format or a human readable text format; sometimes one format may serve both purposes.
*A description must at a minimum answer the '''who''', '''what''', '''when''', and '''where''' questions concerning an expression of the object.
*Standalone descriptions should be accompanied by the modification date and source of the description itself.
*May also return discriminated lists of ARKs that are related to the given ARK.

* [[Digital object identifier]] (DOI)

* [[Persistent uniform resource locator]] (PURL)
* [[Uniform resource name]] (URN)

'''Chris Tolos''' (December 5, 1929 &amp;ndash; August 13, 2005) was a [[Greeks|Greek]]-[[Canadians|Canadian]] [[professional wrestler]]. Chris stayed close to Hamilton for much of his life, taking care of his mother—who lived to be 101 and died in 2001—and his disabled sister. He died of cancer on Saturday, August 13, 2005. He was 75.&lt;ref name="Cancer Claims Chris Tolos"/&gt;

==Early life==
Chris was the oldest of the three children born on December 5, 1929 in Hamilton, Ontario to [[Greeks|Greek]] parents, Nicolaos and Evangelia (Evangeline) Tolos, followed by his brother [[John Tolos|John]] and sister Mary. Growing up in Hamilton, both boys were natural athletes, playing football, hockey, lacrosse and track, and learning to amateur wrestle. Chris got into pro wrestling via Wee Willie Davis and made his debut in Buffalo around 1951.&lt;ref name="Cancer Claims Chris Tolos"/&gt;

==Wrestling career==
Chris debuted as a heel at first, losing preliminary bouts to the likes of Johnny Barend, [[Sandor Kovacs]] and Don Beitelman (Curtis), all of whom he would fight many times over the years.&lt;ref name="Cancer Claims Chris Tolos"/&gt;

He soon brought John into the sport. Together, they were one of the best teams ever, holding numerous tag titles, including the WWWF U.S. tag titles in 1963, the NWA World tag titles in Florida in 1964 and in Detroit that same year, the World and Canadian tag titles in Vancouver in 1967 and the Pacific Coast tag belts in California in 1953. They weren't showy, wearing simple tights to the ring. Rough and tough in the ring, their style relied on hard work and supporting a partner who was in trouble.&lt;ref name="Cancer Claims Chris Tolos"/&gt;

In 1972, Chris went to Los Angeles and teamed with John for a strong run as babyfaces, against Black Gordman and Goliath, one of his few stints as a babyface.&lt;ref name="Cancer Claims Chris Tolos"/&gt;

Chris typically stayed close to home, very dedicated to his disabled sister, allowing his brother John to hit the road and become a singles star, particularly in Los Angeles with his epic feud with Freddie Blassie. In the late '60s, Chris "The Body" Tolos feuded with Iron Mike Dibiase in Omaha, and had his share of NWA World title shots.&lt;ref name="Cancer Claims Chris Tolos"/&gt;

==Death==
Chris Tolos died of cancer on Friday, August 13, 2005. He is survived by his sister Mary and nephew Chris Jr. of California; his son Nicholas of Hamilton, grandson Cory, and ex-wife Joanne of Vancouver. A tree was planted in Woodland Cemetery in Tolos' memory.&lt;ref name="Cancer Claims Chris Tolos"/&gt;

Chris' brother and tag team partner John died in May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-john-tolos1-2009jun01,0,5561561.story John Tolos dies at 78; notorious wrestling villain known as the Golden Greek] - ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Retrieved on 2009-06-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dansk Biografisk Leksikon''''' (usually abbreviated '''DBL'''; title of first edition written '''''Dansk biografisk Lexikon''''') is a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[biographical dictionary]] that has been published in three editions. The first edition, ''Dansk biografisk Lexikon, tillige omfattende Norge for tidsrummet 1537-1814'' (''"...including Norway for the period 1537-1814"'') was published in nineteen volumes 1887-1905 under the editorship of the historian [[Carl Frederik Bricka]]. The first edition, which is in the [[public domain]] is available online at [[Projekt Runeberg]].

Later editions were published 1933-1934 (27 volumes) and 1979-1984 (16 volumes). While some of the biographies from the previous editions have been updated in the third edition, many others &amp;ndash; considered of less contemporary relevance &amp;ndash; were left out and need to be consulted in its predecessors.

==Editions==
*''Dansk biografisk Lexikon, tillige omfattende Norge for tidsrummet 1537-1814'', editor: [[Carl Frederik Bricka|C. F. Bricka]], 19 volumes, Copenhagen:Gyldendal, 1887–1905
*''Dansk biografisk Leksikon'', 2nd edition, 27 volumes, editors: [[Povl Engelstoft]] and [[Svend Dahl]], Copenhagen, 1933-44.
*''Dansk biografisk leksikon'', 3rd edition, 16 volumes, editor: [[Svend Cedergreen Bech]], Copenhagen, 1979-84.

==Online access==
Searchable online access to the articles, some of which have been updated, is available from Gyldendal's ''Den Store Danske'' website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon "Dansk Biografisk Leksikon"], ''Den Store Danske''. {{da icon}} Retrieved 19 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration declares the start of the process to create an [[Catalan Republic|independent Catalan state]] in the form of a [[republic]] and proclaims the start of a participative, open, integrating and active citizens' constituent process to lay the foundation for the future [[Catalan constitutions|Catalan Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Parliament declares the start of the independence process|url=http://www.catalannewsagency.com/politics/item/the-parliament-declares-the-start-of-the-independence-process|publisher=Catalan News Agency|date=9 November 2015|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Catalonia launches process of separation from Spain|url=http://english.vilaweb.cat/noticies/catalonia-launches-process-of-separation-from-spain/|publisher=VilaWeb|date=9 November 2015|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=

The declaration was passed with 72 votes in favor, 63 against and 0 abstentions in the [[Parliament of Catalonia]].

On 9 June 2017, the Catalan government announced the date of the [[Catalan independence referendum, 2017|independence referendum]].

The '''Djadadjii''' is a type of [[vampire hunter]] in Bulgarian folklore.

According to legend, the Djadadjii's speciality is to find and destroy Bulgarian [[vampires]], the '''Kroijac''' by "bottling" it.  First, the vampire hunter takes a bottle and fills it with blood, which they carries with them while they search for the vampire's lair. The Djadadjii usually uses icons of [[Jesus]], the [[Virgin Mary]], or a saint or holy relic for protection and to weed out the Kroijac. When the icon starts to shake s/he knows that the vampire is close. 

The Djadadjii will force the vampire into the bottle. Due to its thirst for blood, the Kroijac will enter the bottle if not forced by the holy symbols. Then, the vampire hunter will lock the bottle and throw it into a burning fire. The bottle will break, killing the vampire.

'''Eats Media''' is a company that provides dining and restaurant information through a variety of different media vehicles.  Their products include Eats.com, Eats Magazine, College Eats and EatsTV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eats.com/about-us/ http://eats.com/aboutus]&lt;/ref&gt;  Eats Media Group was founded in 2002 by CEO Joe Ariel and Derek Beckmann.&lt;ref&gt;"Foodies Unite!" Distinction, Long Island Living, June/July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Eats was founded in [[Murray Hill, Manhattan|Murray Hill]], NYC as a black and white neighborhood restaurant guide.  Their website remained in beta form for over a year, before it was officially launched in April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eats.com/about-us/ www.eats.com/about-us]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==

===Eats.com===
'''Eats.com''' was officially launched by Dale Wagner after partnering with Derek Beckmann and Joe Ariel. &lt;ref&gt;[http://shine.yahoo.com/channel/food/myspace-for-foodies-150440/;_ylt=AiXVu.le5STGOS6wwJz5EgJdbqU5 Nemser, M. "Myspace for foodies?" Yahoo! Shine, March 17, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is partly a [[social networking]] site and partly a restaurant portal that allows users to search for and review restaurants from around the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.sfweekly.com/foodie/2008/04/eatscom_social_networking_for.php SFoodie Blog.

"The Best &amp; Coolest Sites Around," Askmen.com, April 9, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Users can search by type of cuisine, neighborhood, or city.  There is also a feature that allows users to search by restaurant features, such as late-night dining, kid friendly, pet friendly, and more. Somewhat like a "[[Facebook]] for [[foodies]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://themoment.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/08/soft-serve-geisha-guys-a-facebook-for-foodies-a-400-cutting-board/?scp=1-b&amp;sq=eats.com&amp;st=ny Scheider, A. "Soft Serve | Geisha Guys, A Facebook for Foodies, a $400 Cutting Board"], The New York Times, April 8th, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; mixed with a [[Yelp, Inc.|Yelp]] or a [[Citysearch]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://gridskipper.com/66016/what-might-be-the-first Gould-Simon, A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17682">'''Galton's problem''', named after Sir [[Francis Galton]], is the problem of drawing inferences from [[Cross-cultural studies|cross-cultural]] data, due to the statistical phenomenon now called [[autocorrelation]]. The problem is now recognized as a general one that applies to all nonexperimental studies and to [[experimental design]] as well. It is most simply described as the problem of external dependencies in making statistical estimates when the elements sampled are not [[statistical independence|statistically independent]].
Asking two people in the same household whether they watch TV, for example, does not give you statistically independent answers. The sample size, ''n'', for independent observations in this case is one, not two. Once proper adjustments are made that deal with external dependencies, then the axioms of probability theory concerning statistical independence will apply. These axioms are important for deriving measures of [[variance]], for example, or tests of [[statistical significance]].

==Origin==
In 1888, Galton was present when Sir [[Edward Tylor]] presented a paper at the Royal Anthropological Institute. Tylor had compiled information on institutions of marriage and descent for 350 cultures and examined the correlations between these institutions and measures of societal complexity. Tylor interpreted his results as indications of a general evolutionary sequence, in which institutions change focus from the maternal line to the paternal line as societies become increasingly complex. Galton disagreed, pointing out that similarity between cultures could be due to borrowing, could be due to common descent, or could be due to evolutionary development; he maintained that without controlling for borrowing and common descent one cannot make valid inferences regarding evolutionary development. Galton's critique has become the eponymous ''Galton's Problem'',&lt;ref&gt;Stocking, George W. Jr. (1968). "Edward Burnett Tylor." ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences.'' David L. Sills, editor, New York, Mcmillan Company: v.16, pp.&amp;nbsp;170–177.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|175}} as named by [[Raoul Naroll]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  |author=[[Raoul Naroll]] |year=1961 |title=Two solutions to Galton's Problem |journal=[[Philosophy of Science (journal)|Philosophy of Science]] |volume=28 |pages=15–29 |doi=10.1086/287778}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=[[Raoul Naroll]] |year=1965 |title=Galton's problem: The logic of cross cultural research |journal=[[Social Research]] |volume=32 |pages=428–451}}&lt;/ref&gt; who proposed the first statistical solutions.

By the early 20th century unilineal evolutionism was abandoned and along with it the drawing of direct inferences from correlations to evolutionary sequences. Galton's criticisms proved equally valid, however, for inferring functional relations from correlations. The problem of autocorrelation remained.

==Solutions==

Statistician [[William S. Gosset]] in 1914 developed methods of eliminating spurious correlation due to how position in time or space affects similarities. Today's election [[opinion poll|polls]] have a similar problem: the closer the poll to the election, the less individuals make up their mind independently, and the greater the [[reliability (statistics)|unreliability]] of the polling results, especially the [[margin of error]] or [[confidence limits]]. The effective ''n'' of [[statistical independence|independent cases]] from their sample drops as the election nears. [[Statistical significance]] falls with lower effective sample size.

The problem pops up in [[sampling (statistics)|sample surveys]] when sociologists want to reduce the travel time to do their interviews, and hence they divide their population into [[cluster sampling|local clusters]] and sample the clusters randomly, then sample again within the clusters. If they interview ''n'' people in clusters of size ''m'' the effective [[sample size]] (efs) would have a lower limit of {{nowrap|1 + (''n'' − 1) / ''m''}} if everyone in each cluster were identical. When there are only partial similarities within clusters, the ''m'' in this formula has to be lowered accordingly. A formula of this sort is {{nowrap|1 + d (''n'' − 1)}} where ''d'' is the [[Statistical Methods for Research Workers|intraclass correlation]] for the statistic in question.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.smu.edu/slstokes/stat3370/deff.pdf Sample Size and Design Effect]&lt;/ref&gt; In general, estimation of the appropriate efs depends on the [[statistic]] estimated, as for example, [[mean]], [[Chi-squared statistic|chi-square]], [[correlation]], [[Regression analysis|regression]] coefficient, and their [[variance]]s.

For [[cross-cultural studies]], [[Standard cross-cultural sample|Murdock and White]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
 | author = [[George P. Murdock]] and [[Douglas R. White]]
 | year = 1969
 | title = Standard cross-cultural sample

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
estimated the size of patches of similarities in their sample of 186 societies. The four variables they tested – language, economy, political integration, and descent – had patches of similarities that varied from size three to size ten. A very crude rule of thumb might be to divide the square root of the similarity-patch sizes into ''n'', so that the effective sample sizes are 58 and 107 for these patches, respectively. Again, statistical significance falls with lower effective sample size.

In modern analysis spatial lags have been modelled in order to estimate the degree of globalization on modern societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jahn, Detlef | year = 2006 | title = Globalization as ''Galton's Problem'': The Missing Link in the Analysis of the Diffusion Patterns in Welfare State Development | url = http://intersci.ss.uci.edu/wiki/pw/DetlefJahn2006.pdf | format = PDF | journal = [[International Organization]] | volume = 60 | issue = 2| pages = 401–431 | doi=10.1017/s0020818306060127}} [http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p69254_index.html abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spatial dependence|Spatial dependency]] or [[Spatial analysis#Spatial dependency or auto-correlation|auto-correlation]] is a fundamental concept in geography. Methods developed by geographers that measure and control for spatial autocorrelation&lt;ref&gt;Cliff, A.D., and J.K. Ord. 1973. ''Spatial Autocorrelation''. London: Pion Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cliff, A.D. and J.K. Ord. 1981. ''Spatial Processes''. London: Pion Press.&lt;/ref&gt; do far more than reduce the effective ''n'' for [[tests of significance]] of a correlation. One example is the complicated hypothesis that "the presence of gambling in a society is directly proportional to the presence of a commercial money and to the presence of considerable socioeconomic differences and is inversely related to whether or not the society is a nomadic herding society." Tests of this hypothesis in a sample of 60 societies failed to reject the null hypothesis. Autocorrelation analysis, however, showed a significant effect of socioeconomic differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Malcolm M. Dow, Michael L. Burton, [[Douglas R. White]], and Karl P. Reitz |year=1984 |title=Galton's problem as network autocorrelation |journal=[[American Ethnologist]] |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=754–770 |doi=10.1525/ae.1984.11.4.02a00080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

How prevalent is autocorrelation among the variables studied in cross-cultural research? A test by Anthon Eff on 1700 variables in the cumulative database for the [[Standard Cross-Cultural Sample]], published in [http://www.worldcultures.org/ World Cultures], measured Moran's I for spatial autocorrelation (distance), linguistic autocorrelation (common descent), and autocorrelation in cultural complexity (mainline evolution). "The results suggest that ... it would be prudent to test for spatial and phylogenetic autoccorrelation when conducting regression analyses with the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  |author=E. Anthon Eff |year=2004 |url=http://www.mtsu.edu/~eaeff/downloads/SAS2001.pdf |title=Does Mr. Galton still have a Problem? Autocorrelation in the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample |journal=[[World Cultures]] |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=153–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The use of autocorrelation tests in exploratory data analysis is illustrated, showing how all variables in a given study can be evaluated for nonindependence of cases in terms of distance, language, and cultural complexity. The methods for estimating these autocorrelation effects are then explained and illustrated for ordinary least squares regression using again the Moran I significance measure of autocorrelation.

When autocorrelation is present, it can often be removed to get unbiased estimates of regression coefficients and their variances by constructing a respecified dependent variable that is "lagged" by weightings on the dependent variable on other locations, where the weights are degree of relationship. This lagged dependent variable is endogenous, and estimation requires either [[two-stage least squares]] or [[maximum likelihood]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;Anselin, Luc. 1988.

In anthropology, where Tylor's problem was first recognized by the statistician Galton in 1889, it is still not widely recognized that there are standard statistical adjustments for the problem of patches of similarity in observed cases and opportunities for new discoveries using autocorrelation methods. Some cross-cultural researchers (see, e.g., [[Korotayev]] and de Munck 2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/3116534/_Galtons_Asset_and_Flowers_Problem_Cultural_Networks_and_Cultural_Units_in_Cross_Cultural_Research_Ml_Or_Male_Genital_Mutilations_and_Polygyny_in_Cross_Cultural_Perspective_ |title=''Galton's Asset'' and ''Flower's Problem'': Cultural Networks and Cultural Units in Cross-Cultural Research |author=[[Andrey Korotayev]] and Victor de Munck |journal=[[American Anthropologist]] |year=2003 |volume=105 |issue=2 |pages=353–358 |doi=10.1525/aa.2003.105.2.353}}&lt;/ref&gt;
have begun to realize that evidence of diffusion, historical origin, and other sources of similarity among related societies or individuals should be renamed Galton's Opportunity and Galton's Asset rather than Galton's Problem. Researchers now use longitudinal, cross-cultural, and regional variation analysis routinely to analyze all the competing hypotheses: [[functional form|functional]] relationships, [[cultural diffusion|diffusion]], common historical origin, [[multilineal evolution]], [[co-adaptation]] with environment, and complex [[social interaction]] dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mace, Ruth  |author2=Pagel, Mark | year = 1994 | title = The Comparative Method in Anthropology | url = http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/resolve?doi=10.1086/204317&amp;erFrom=8676762015401742140Guest | journal = [[Current Anthropology]] | volume = 35 | issue = 5| pages = 549–564 | doi=10.1086/204317 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
{{pov|section|date=November 2017}}

Within anthropology, Galton's problem is often given as a cause to reject comparative studies altogether. Since the problem is a general one, common to the sciences and statistical inference generally, this particular criticism of cross-cultural or comparative studies – and there are many – is one that, logically speaking, amounts to a rejection of science and statistics altogether. Any data collected and analyzed by ethnographers, for example, is equally subject to Galton's problem, understood in its most general sense. A critique of the anticomparative critique is not limited to statistical comparison since it would apply as well to the analysis of text. That is, the analysis and use of text in argumentation is subject to critique as to the evidential basis of inference. Reliance purely on rhetoric is no protection against critique as to the validity of argument and its evidentiary basis.

There is little doubt, however, that the community of cross-cultural researchers have been remiss in ignoring Galton's problem. Expert investigation of this question shows results that "strongly suggest that the extensive reporting of naïve chi-square independence tests using cross-cultural data sets over the past several decades has led to incorrect rejection of null hypotheses at levels much higher than the expected 5% rate."&lt;ref name="Dow"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Malcolm M. Dow |year=1993 |title=Saving the theory: on chi-square tests with cross-cultural survey data |journal=[[Cross-Cultural Research]] |volume=27 |issue=3–4 |pages=247–276 |doi=10.1177/106939719302700305}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|247}} The investigator concludes that "Incorrect theories that have been 'saved' by naïve chi-square tests with comparative data may yet be more rigorously tested another day."&lt;ref name="Dow"/&gt;{{rp|270}} Once again, the adjusted variance of a cluster sample is given as one multiplied by 1 + ''d'' (''k'' + 1) where ''k'' is the average size of a cluster, and a more complicated correction is given for the variance of contingency table correlations with ''r'' rows and ''c'' columns. Since this critique was published in 1993, and others like it, more authors have begun to adopt corrections for Galton's problem, but the majority in the cross-cultural field have not. Consequently, a large proportion of published results that rely on naive significance tests and that adopt the ''P'' &lt; 0.05 rather than a ''P'' &lt; 0.005 standard are likely to be in error because they are more susceptible to [[type I error]], which is to reject the null hypothesis when it is true.

Some cross-cultural researchers reject the seriousness of Galton's problem because, they argue, estimates of correlations and means may be unbiased even if autocorrelation, weak or strong, is present. Without investigating autocorrelation, however, they may still [[Omitted-variable bias|mis-estimate]] statistics dealing with relationships among variables. In [[regression analysis]], for example, examining the patterns of [[Durbin–Watson statistic|autocorrelated residuals]] may give important clues to third factors that may affect the relationships among variables but that have not been included in the regression model. Second, if there are
clusters of similar and related societies in the sample, measures of variance will be underestimated, leading to spurious statistical conclusions. for example, exaggerating the statistical significance of correlations. Third, the underestimation of variance makes it difficult to test for replication of results from two different samples, as the results will more often be rejected as similar.

&lt;!-- needs to be expanded with material from https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hausos&amp;oldid=816953928 --&gt;

'''Hausos''' ([[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]: [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h₂éwsōs|*''{{PIE|h₂éwsōs}}'']]) is the reconstructed name for the [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Proto-Indo-European goddess]] of the dawn.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pp=410, 432}} Derivatives of her found throughout various Indo-European mythologies include the [[List of Greek mythological figures|Greek goddess]] [[Eos]], the [[List of Roman deities|Roman goddess]] [[Aurōra]], the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic goddess]] [[Ushas|Uṣás]], the [[List of Lithuanian mythological figures|Lithuanian goddess]] [[Aušrinė]] (cf. Lith. ''aušrà'' "dawn"),{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pp=410, 432}}{{sfn|West|2007|pp=217-227}} and possibly also the (West) [[List of Germanic deities|Germanic goddess]] [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/Austrǭ|*''Austrǭ'']] (Old English ''[[Ēostre]]'', Old High German *''Ōstara'').{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|ppp=148-149}}{{sfn|West|2007|p=227}}

The Dawn Goddess is hypothesised to have been one of the most important deities to the Proto-Indo-Europeans, due to the consistency of her characterisation as well as the relevance of [[Ushas]] in the [[Rig Veda]].&lt;ref&gt;Mallory, J. P., and Adams, D. Q. (ed.). Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gamkrelidze, Thomas V. and Ivanov, Vjačeslav V. Indo-European and the Indo-Europeans: A Reconstruction and Historical Analysis of a Proto-Language and a Proto-Culture. tr. Johanna Nichols. New York: Mounton de Gruyter, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Her attributes have not only been mixed with those of [[solar goddesses]] in some later traditions, but have subsequently expanded and influenced female deities in other mythologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp118_chinese_weaving_goddess.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attributes==

===Genealogy===
The Dawn Goddess is thought to have been envisioned as the daughter of [[Dyeus]]. This is partially reflected in Vedic mythology, where [[Ushas]] is the daughter of [[Dyaus Pita]], though in some other Indo-European derivations this is not the case ([[Eos]] is a [[Titan (mythology)|titan]] daughter of [[Hyperion (mythology)|Hyperion]] and [[Theia]] while [[Aušrinė]] is the daughter of [[Saulė]] and [[Mėnulis]]; even [[Ushas]] is inversely sometimes considered the daughter of [[Surya]]), though nonetheless the epithet "daughter of heaven" remains in nearly all Indo-European mythologies. This reflects her status as a relevant goddess as well as a celestial deity.&lt;ref&gt;Matasović, Ranko. A Theory of Textual Reconstruction in Indo-European Linguistics. New York: Peter Lang, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matasovič, Ranko. "Sky" and "Moon" in Celtic and Indo-European. Celto-Slavica 2 (2009), 154-162. (Differently paginated on-line, from 121-27).&lt;/ref&gt;

She is also envisioned as the sister of the [[Divine Twins]], with [[Ushas]] still maintaining this relation to the [[Ashvins]]. Although the "marriage drama" myth (in which one or both of the Divine Twins compete for the hand of a woman in marriage) is usually linked to the sun goddess rather than the dawn goddess, there is a possible degree of syncretism in this regard, particularly as the Baltic [[Aušrinė]] is in a similar marriage drama situation, albeit in relation to her father and her mother.&lt;ref&gt;Dexter, Miriam Robbins. Proto-Indo-European Sun Maidens and Gods of the Moon. Mankind Quarterly 25:1 &amp; 2 (Fall/Winter, 1984), pp. 137 - 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmic Order and Morality===
Due to the dawn heralding the sun and inducing the daily routine, the Dawn Goddess is associated with instilling the cosmic order. [[Ushas]] is the arouser of [[Ṛta]], while the role of [[Aušrinė]] as the maid of the sun renders her a moral example in Lithuanian traditions and helped her syncretism with the [[Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;Zinkus, Jonas; et al., eds. (1985–1988). "Aušrinė". Tarybų Lietuvos enciklopedija (in Lithuanian). I. Vilnius: Vyriausioji enciklopedijų redakcija. p. 143. LCC 86232954.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Love===
The Dawn Goddess was probably the original love and lust deity in Proto-Indo-European religion, an aspect maintained in nearly all reflexes but noticeably lost in later stages of Hellenic and Indu myth ([[Eos]] replaced by [[Aphrodite]] and [[Eros]], [[Ushas]] replaced by [[Kamadeva]]). Notably, the Greek myth of [[Aphrodite]] cursing [[Eos]] with lust may be a representation of usurpation of the role as love goddess by the former.

===Aging===
In spite of the association of the dawn with life, counterintuitively the dawn was possibly also associated with aging and decay in Proto-Indo-European myth, probably under the assumption that each dawn brings human beings closer to death or alternatively that sun rays induce rot. In the [[Rig Veda]], [[Ushas]] is "The ancient goddess, born again and again, dressed in the same color, causes the mortal to age and wears away his life-span, as a cunning gambler carries off the stakes" and "Bringing old age, thou hast come, O unageing Dawn … Unageing, thou dost make to age all else", while in Greek Mythology [[Eos]] famously asks [[Zeus]] for [[Tithonus]] to maintain his life but not his youth, reducing him to a cricket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=O'Flaherty, Wendy Doniger |title=Women, Androgynes, and Other Mythical Beasts |location=Chicago, IL |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birch tree===
The birch tree is consistently associated with purity, spring, moral purity and light in Indo-European religions, indicating that it was possibly emblematic of the Dawn Goddess.&lt;ref&gt;Gamkrelidze, Thomas V. and Ivanov, Vjačeslav V. Indo-European and the Indo-Europeans: A Reconstruction and Historical Analysis of a Proto-Language and a Proto-Culture. tr. Johanna Nichols. New York: Mounton de Gruyter, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weaving===
The Dawn Goddess was associated with weaving, a behaviour sometimes used as a metaphor for the generative properties of sunlight. This characteristic is normally seen in solar goddesses and it might indicate a large amount of syncretism between dawn and solar deities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp118_chinese_weaving_goddess.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacred Animals===
[[File:Guercino 001.jpg|thumb|right|''Aurora'', by [[Guercino]], demonstrating her association with horses and chariots.]]
Nearly all reflexes are associated with reddish [[horses]], perhaps due to syncretism with solar goddesses as well as the hypothesised relation with the [[Divine Twins]].&lt;ref&gt;Matasović, Ranko. A Theory of Textual Reconstruction in Indo-European Linguistics. New York: Peter Lang, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matasovič, Ranko. "Sky" and "Moon" in Celtic and Indo-European. Celto-Slavica 2 (2009), 154-162. (Differently paginated on-line, from 121-27).&lt;/ref&gt; Red [[cows]] are also sacred to [[Ushas]], while [[Eos]] is linked with [[songbirds]] and [[cicadas]]. [[Spiders]] are also possibly illustrative of this goddess, due to their association with weaving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp118_chinese_weaving_goddess.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3033">In [[English law]], the term '''headborough''', '''head-borough''', '''borough-head''', '''borrowhead''', or '''chief pledge''', referred historically to the head of the legal, administrative, and territorial unit known as a [[tithing]], which sometimes, particularly in [[Kent]], [[Surrey]] and [[Sussex]], was known as a ''borgh'', ''borow'', or ''borough''. The office was rendered in Latin documents as ''capitalis plegius'' (''chief pledge'') or ''decennarius'' (''tenner'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=P.D.A. |last=Harvey |title=Manorial Records |publisher=British Records Association |series=Archives and the User |volume=5 |year=1984 |location=London |ISBN=0-900222-06-9 |page=47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Anglo-Saxon system of [[frankpledge]], or ''frith-borh'', the headborough presided over the borhsmen in his jurisdiction, who in turn presided over the local tithingmen.&lt;ref&gt;White (1895:200).&lt;/ref&gt; Frankpledge was a system that existed to create an incentive for a tithing to police itself, and consequently, the headborough was effectively obliged to police his tithing, as well as dealing with more administrative matters. By the early 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|headborough}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; it had evolved into the position of [[parish constable]], a [[Civil parishes in England|parochial]] officer subordinate to a hundred-[[constable]].

Although the parish constable and hundred-constable share the term ''constable'', the two roles had different functions, and origins. While the hundred-constable originated from senior military officers enforcing civil order, the parish constable had a wide range of civil administration functions in addition to a recognisable policing role. It is the hundred-constable which originated the term ''constable'', and the parish constable acquired it by comparison; where the term ''headborough'' or ''chief pledge'' is used in contrast to a ''constable'', the term ''constable'' is likely to refers specifically to the role of a hundred-constable.

In this sense it is found in the [[Induction (play)|induction]] to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' (written c. 1590–92), when the Hostess of an alehouse, arguing with a drunken troublemaker, declares, "I know my remedie, I must go fetch the Headborough" (Induction, i); and again in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' (written c. 1598–9), where the [[dramatis personae]] describes Verges as a Headborough, subordinate to Constable [[Dogberry]] (Act 3, scene 5).

'''Hendre'r Ywydd Uchaf''' is an early 16th-century [[cruck house]], originally constructed near [[Llangynhafal]], [[Denbighshire]], and now located at [[St Fagans National History Museum]] in [[Cardiff]], Wales. One of the interior wooden beams has been dated to the year 1508, using [[dendrochronology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpat.org.uk/projects/longer/histland/clwyd/1043.htm Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust]. Accessed 6 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  The house has five bays, two of which would have been used for livestock, and an open [[hearth]].  It was designated a [[Grade II listed building]] on 10 June 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-13852-hendre-r-ywydd-uchaf-farmhouse-st-fagans/osmap British Listed Buildings].

The walls of the house are timber-framed with [[oak]] stakes bound together by a [[wattle-and-daub]] construction.  The roof is [[thatch]]ed with wheat straw.  There is an earth floor and unglazed windows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/27306/details/HENDRE%27R-YWYDD+UCHAF,+LLANGYNHAFAL/ Coflein – Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales].

The '''Human Protein Atlas''' (HPA) is a Swedish-based program started in 2003 with the aim to map of all the human proteins in [[Cell (biology)|cells]], [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] and [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] using integration of various [[omics]] technologies, including [[antibody]]-based imaging, [[mass spectrometry]]-based [[proteomics]], [[Transcriptomics technologies|transcriptomics]] and [[systems biology]]. All the data in the knowledge resource is open access to allow scientists both in academia and industry to freely access the data for exploration of the human [[proteome]]. The version 18 (launched December 1, 2017) consists of three separate parts, each focusing on a particular aspect of the [[genome]]-wide analysis of the human proteins; the Tissue Atlas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Uhlén M, Fagerberg L, Hallström BM, Lindskog C, Oksvold P, Mardinoglu A, Sivertsson Å, Kampf C, Sjöstedt E, Asplund A, Olsson I, Edlund K, Lundberg E, Navani S, Szigyarto CA, Odeberg J, Djureinovic D, Takanen JO, Hober S, Alm T, Edqvist PH, Berling H, Tegel H, Mulder J, Rockberg J, Nilsson P, Schwenk JM, Hamsten M, von Feilitzen K, Forsberg M, Persson L, Johansson F, Zwahlen M, von Heijne G, Nielsen J, Pontén F | display-authors = 6 | author-link1 =  Mathias Uhlén | title = Proteomics.

The Human Protein Atlas program has already contributed to several thousands of publications in the field of human biology and disease and it was recently (July 25, 2017) selected by the organization [[ELIXIR]] as a European core resource due to its fundamental importance for a wider life science community. The HPA consortium is funded by the [[Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation]].

==Three projects==
The Human Protein Atlas consists of three sub-atlases:

The Tissue Atlas: contains information regarding the expression profiles of human genes both on the mRNA and protein level. The protein expression data is derived from antibody-based protein profiling using [[immunohistochemistry]]. Altogether 76 different cell types, corresponding to 44 normal human tissue types, have been analyzed and the data is presented as pathology-based annotation of protein expression levels. All underlying images of [[immunohistochemistry]] stained normal tissues are available as high-resolution images in the normal tissue atlas.

The Cell Atlas: provides high-resolution insights into the spatial distribution of proteins within cells. The protein expression data is derived from antibody-based profiling using [[immunofluorescence]] [[confocal microscopy]]. A panel of 56 cell lines, selected to represent various cell populations in different organs of the human body, forms the basis of the Cell Atlas. In this cell line panel the mRNA expression of all human genes have been characterized using deep RNA-sequencing. The subcellular distribution of proteins is investigated in a subset of the cell lines, and classified into 32 different organelles and fine cellular structures.

The Pathology Atlas: is based on the analysis of 17 main cancer types using data from 8,000 patients. In addition, a new concept for showing patient survival data is introduced, called Interactive Survival Scatter plots, and the atlas includes more than 400,000 such plots. A national supercomputer center was used to analyze more than 2.5 petabytes of underlying publicly available data from the [[The Cancer Genome Atlas|Cancer Genome Atlas]] (TCGA) to generate more than 900,000 [[Kaplan–Meier estimator|survival plots]] describing the consequence of RNA and protein levels on clinical survival. The Pathology Atlas also contains 5 million [[pathology]]-based images generated by the Human Protein Atlas consortium.

==History==
The Human Protein Atlas program was started in 2003 and funded by the non-profit organization [[Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation]] (KAW). The main site of the project is the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] (KTH), School of Biotechnology (Stockholm, Sweden). Professor [[Mathias Uhlén]] is the director of the program.

The research underpinning the start of the exploration of the whole human proteome in the Human Protein Atlas program was carried out in the late 1990s and early 2000s. A pilot study employing an affinity proteomics strategy using affinity-purified antibodies raised against recombinant human protein fragments was carried out for a chromosome-wide protein profiling of chromosome 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Agaton C, Galli J, Höidén Guthenberg I, Janzon L, Hansson M, Asplund A, Brundell E, Lindberg S, Ruthberg I, Wester K, Wurtz D, Höög C, Lundeberg J, Ståhl S, Pontén F, Uhlén M | title = Affinity proteomics for systematic protein profiling of chromosome 21 gene products in human tissues | journal = Molecular &amp; Cellular Proteomics | volume = 2 | issue = 6 | pages = 405–14 | date = Jun 2003 | pmid = 12796447 | doi = 10.1074/mcp.M300022-MCP200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other projects were also carried out to establish processes for parallel and automated affinity purification of mono-specific antibodies and their validation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Falk R, Agaton C, Kiesler E, Jin S, Wieslander L, Visa N, Hober S, Ståhl S | title = An improved dual-expression concept, generating high-quality antibodies for proteomics research | journal = Biotechnology and Applied Biochemistry | volume = 38 | issue = Pt 3 | pages = 231–9 | date = Dec 2003 | pmid = 12875650 | doi = 10.1042/BA20030091 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Uhlén M, Björling E, Agaton C, Szigyarto CA, Amini B, Andersen E, Andersson AC, Angelidou P, Asplund A, Asplund C, Berglund L, Bergström K, Brumer H, Cerjan D, Ekström M, Elobeid A, Eriksson C, Fagerberg L, Falk R, Fall J, Forsberg M, Björklund MG, Gumbel K, Halimi A, Hallin I, Hamsten C, Hansson M, Hedhammar M, Hercules G, Kampf C, Larsson K, Lindskog M, Lodewyckx W, Lund J, Lundeberg J, Magnusson K, Malm E, Nilsson P, Odling J, Oksvold P, Olsson I, Oster E, Ottosson J, Paavilainen L, Persson A, Rimini R, Rockberg J, Runeson M, Sivertsson A, Sköllermo A, Steen J, Stenvall M, Sterky F, Strömberg S, Sundberg M, Tegel H, Tourle S, Wahlund E, Waldén A, Wan J, Wernérus H, Westberg J, Wester K, Wrethagen U, Xu LL, Hober S, Pontén F | display-authors = 6 | title = A human protein atlas for normal and cancer tissues based on antibody proteomics | journal = Molecular &amp; Cellular Proteomics | volume = 4 | issue = 12 | pages = 1920–32 | date = Dec 2005 | pmid = 16127175 | doi = 10.1074/mcp.M500279-MCP200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4354">The '''INVEST mnemonic''' for agile software projects was created by Bill Wake&lt;ref&gt;Bill Wake's original article: [http://xp123.com/articles/invest-in-good-stories-and-smart-tasks INVEST in Good Stories, and SMART Tasks]&lt;/ref&gt; as a reminder of the characteristics of a good quality Product Backlog Item (commonly written in [[user story]] format, but not required to be) or '''PBI''' for short.
Such a PBI may be used in a [[Scrum (development)|Scrum]] or [[Kanban (development)|Kanban]] backlog or [[Extreme Programming|XP]] project.

|}

==Independent==
One of the characteristics of Agile Methodologies such as [[Scrum (software development)|Scrum]], [[Kanban]] or [[Extreme Programming|XP]] is the ability to move PBIs around, taking into account their relative priority - for example - without much effort. If you find PBIs that are tightly dependent, a good idea might be to combine them into a single PBI.

==Negotiable==
The only thing that is fixed and set in stone in an agile project is an iteration backlog (and, even then, this "can be clarified and re-negotiated... as more is learned."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2017/2017-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf The Scrum Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;). While the PBI lies in the product backlog, it can be rewritten or even discarded, depending on business, market, technical or any other type of requirement by team members.

==Valuable==
The focus here is to bring actual project-related value to the stakeholder. Coming up with technical PBIs that are really fun to code but bring no value to the stakeholders violates one of the Agile Principles, which is to continuously deliver valuable software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html Principles behind the Agile Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Estimate-able==
If a PBI size cannot be estimated, it will never be planned or tasked; thus, it will never become part of an iteration. So, there's actually no point in keeping this kind of PBI in the Product Backlog at all. Most of the time, estimation cannot be executed due to the lack of supporting information either in the story description itself or directly from the Product Owner.

==Small==
Try to keep your PBI sizes to typically a few person-days and at most a few person-weeks (a good rule of thumb is that any single Product Backlog Item does not take more than 50% of an iteration; for example a single item won't take more than 5 days for a 2 week / 10 day sprint). Anything beyond that range should be considered too large to be estimated with a good level of certainty - Scrum calls these large PBIs "Epics" where an Epic will take more than one iteration to deliver and, necessarily, will need to be broken down into smaller PBIs that can fit comfortably within Iterations. There's no problem in starting with epic PBIs, as long as they are broken down when the time to place them in an iteration backlog comes closer.  This implements Lean's Just In Time analysis concept.

==Testable==
Bear in mind that a PBI should only be considered DONE, among other things, if it was tested successfully. If one cannot test a PBI due to lack of information (see "Estimable" above), the PBI should not be considered a good candidate to be part of an iteration Backlog. This is especially true for teams employing [[Test-driven development|TDD - Test Driven Development]].

'''Imperial Armour''' is a series of rules supplements to the ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' table-top game, along with an associated range of vehicle-size resin model kits. Both are produced by [[Forge World]], a subsidiary company of [[Games Workshop]].

The Imperial Armour range and rules supplements are designed to incorporate vehicles referred to in the fiction and background material produced for the ''Warhammer 40,000'' fictional universe, but not included in the [[Codex (Warhammer 40,000)|Codexes]] due to a variety of reasons. These include super-heavy vehicles (such as the [[Imperium (Warhammer 40,000)|Imperial]] [[Vehicles of the Imperial Guard (Warhammer 40,000)#Baneblade|Baneblade]]), specialised variants of standard vehicles (such as [[Tau (Warhammer 40,000)|Tau Empire]] [[Weapons, equipment and vehicles of the Tau Empire#Hammerhead|Hammerhead Gunships]] modified to carry different turret weapon configurations), aircraft, immobile defenses, and non-combatant vehicles. Vehicles that are featured in the Imperial Armour books are available from Forge World as multi-part resin model kits, or as a series of resin components that can be used to convert existing plastic and metal models. The Imperial Armour range is not limited to conventional vehicles, as the [[Ork (Warhammer 40,000)|Orks]] are known to use massive creatures called [[Squig]]goths, and the [[Tyranid]]s do not possess any vehicles, instead using extremely large bioformed creatures.

==List of Imperial Armour books==
Early Imperial Armour rules supplements are written by Warwick Kinrade, later ones by Warwick Kinrade and/or Alan Bligh.

Starting in 2015, Forgeworld stopped using the `Volume X' notation, using just Imperial Armour and the title of the book.

The '''Jerusalem Cinematheque''' is a [[cinematheque]] and film archive in [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]].

The Jerusalem Cinematheque was founded in 1973 by [[Lia van Leer]]. It was originally located in Beit Agron in the center of [[Jerusalem]]. A new building overlooking the walls of the Old City, close to the [[Hinnom Valley]], was opened in 1981 with the financial support of the Ostrovsky Family Foundation, the Jerusalem Foundation, the Van Leer Foundation, and private donors. 

In addition to screening halls, the Cinematheque houses the [[Israel Film Archive]], an archive of films from the 1920s to today, The Nathan Axelrod Newsreel Collection, the Joan Sourasky-Constantiner Holocaust Multimedia Research Center, the Department for Film and Media Education, and the Lew and  Edie Wasserman Film Library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jer-cin.org.il/Default.aspx?Lang=En Jerusalem Cinematheque: Lia van Leer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025155605/http://www.jer-cin.org.il/Default.aspx?Lang=En |date=2011-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2597">In '''''Jordaan NO and Another v Verwey''''', an important case in the [[South African law of lease]], the parties entered into an oral contract which they described as a lease. The alleged lessee was given the right to use five orchards, in return for which he was obliged to install and commission a microjetting system in that orchard of the leased premises known as "Girlsland."

When the alleged lessee failed to install and commission the system, the alleged lessor issued summons to compel him to do so.

The court referred to the case of ''[[Black v Scheepers]]'', where it was held that rent had to be paid in money or fruits, and that the provision of meals was not rent.

On appeal, it was argued that payment for light and water, which were undertaken as separate obligations, could be counted as rent. The court said that this was incorrect.

The court held that practical considerations are decisive. The essential different between lease agreements and other agreements lies in the rule relating to the nature of the consideration payable.

It is not in accordance with public policy that parties should find themselves in a position different from that to which they thought they had agreed. The court held, however, that the contract was not a lease, as the consideration was something other than money or fruits.

The judgment of the court has been criticised by the eminent scholar [[AJ Kerr]], who observes that the court does not explain what it has in mind when it refers to "practical considerations." It is correct, he acknowledges, that the court must consider the true nature of the contract even if the parties use terminology relevant to lease contracts. In ''Jordaan'', both parties intended their contract to be a lease, but the court held that it could not be a lease. Kerr argues that, if the court had recognised the contract as a lease, neither of the parties, nor any third party, would have been prejudiced. Kerr concludes that the decision in ''Jordaan'' ought not to be followed, hoping that in future the courts will follow ''[[Rubin v Botha]]''&lt;ref&gt;1911 AD 568.&lt;/ref&gt; instead or, if they do not, that they will develop the law to allow rent to be paid in money or in other ways not limited to fruits

Measurement of '''life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions''' involves calculating the [[global-warming potential]] of electrical energy sources through [[life-cycle assessment]] of each energy source. The findings are presented in units of global warming potential per unit of electrical energy generated by that source. The scale uses the global warming potential unit, the [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] ({{CO2}}e), and the unit of electrical energy, the [[kilowatt hour]] (kWh). The goal of such assessments is to cover the full life of the source, from material and fuel mining through construction to operation and waste management.

In 2014, the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] harmonized the [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] ({{CO2}}e) findings of the major electricity generating sources in use worldwide. This was done by analyzing the findings of hundreds of individual scientific papers assessing each energy source.&lt;ref name="NREL-LCA1" /&gt;

For all technologies, advances in efficiency, and therefore reductions in {{CO2}}e since the time of publication, have not been included. For example, the total life cycle emissions from [[wind power]] may have lessened since publication. Similarly, due to the time frame over which the studies were conducted, nuclear [[Generation II reactor]]'s {{CO2}}e results are presented and not the global warming potential of [[Generation III reactor]]s, presently under construction in the United States and China. Other limitations of the data include: a) missing life cycle phases, and, b) uncertainty as to where to define the cut-off point in the global warming potential of an energy source. The latter is important in assessing a combined electrical grid in the real world, rather than the established practice of simply assessing the energy source in isolation.

== 2012 Yale University systematic review and harmonization of nuclear power data==

A [[Yale University]] review of hundreds of prior papers, as published in the ''Journal of Industrial Ecology'' analyzing {{CO2}} [[life cycle assessment]] (LCA) emissions from [[nuclear power]] determined: "The collective LCA literature indicates that life cycle [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] emissions from nuclear power are only a fraction of traditional fossil sources and comparable to renewable technologies."&lt;ref name="Warner + Heath, JoIE" /&gt; The study also noted that for the most common category of reactors, the [[Light water reactor]]: "Harmonization decreased the [[median]] estimate for all LWR technology categories so that the [[median]]s of [[BWR]]s, [[Pressurized water reactor|PWR]]s, and all LWRs are similar, at approximately 12 g {{CO2}}-eq/kWh.

Speaking of the numerous assumptions and therefore wide results returned by authors of previous individual studies, the Warner and Heath Yale paper states: "the difference between nuclear power life cycle GHG emissions constructed in an electric system dominated by nuclear (or renewables) and a system dominated by coal can be fairly large (in the range of 4 to 22 g {{CO2}}-eq/kWh compared to 30 to 110 g {{CO2}}-eq/kWh, respectively)". The already established electric grid being a necessary input to drive the [[uranium enrichment]] systems.

With Figure 4 of the paper,&lt;ref name="Warner + Heath, JoIE" /&gt; expanding on these figures, displaying the [[median]] result returned from these other papers as approximately 35&amp;nbsp;g {{CO2}}-eq/kWh when a nation's background electricity "energy mix" is "high carbon" that is, primarily coal powered, combined with a slightly lower than typical [[uranium ore]] grade input in the range of 0.01% [[U3O8]]. To put this number in perspective, average uranium ores are between 0.05% to 0.40% U3O8, with the ore at the most productive uranium mine in the world, [[McArthur River uranium mine]], at approximately 15.76%.&lt;ref name="mining-technology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mining-technology.com/features/feature-the-10-biggest-uranium-mines-in-the-world/|title=The 10 biggest uranium mines in the world|website=Mining Technology|accessdate=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="world-nuclear"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/mining-of-uranium/in-situ-leach-mining-of-uranium.aspx|title=In Situ Leach Mining (ISL) of Uranium|website=World Nuclear Association|accessdate=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high rate of near 110 grams of GHGs mentioned in this Yale paper, as shown in Figure 4 and discussed in the body of the article, is derived from what the authors consider to be a "worst-case scenario" that is not "considered very robust". As it is inclusive of a combination of unrealistic factors not seen in any country. This is, a high coal usage in the electricity energy-mix combined with the terrestrial mining by [[uranium mining|conventional methods]], of ultra low-grade "[[uranium ore]]" with a "0.0001%" concentration of [[U3O8]].&lt;ref name="Warner + Heath, JoIE" /&gt;

As a way to put this "ore" concentration into perspective, vast quantities of presently uneconomical [[Uranium ore#Lignite|uranium in many lignite coal ashes]] have uranium concentrations five times greater than this.&lt;ref name="GAMRR1"&gt;{{citation|author1=McKay, A.D. |author2=Meiitis, Y. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2001 |title=Australia's uranium resources, geology and development of deposits. |publisher=AGSO-Geoscience Australia, Mineral Resources Report 1 |url=http://www.ga.gov.au/image_cache/GA9508.pdf |format=PDF |isbn=0-642-46716-1 |accessdate=2009-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002233115/http://www.ga.gov.au/image_cache/GA9508.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the 4&amp;nbsp;g {{CO2}}-eq/kWh rate mentioned in the body of the paper is, again as Figure 4 shows, a result of an electricity energy-mix that is already low-carbon combined with a more typical, but still low, [[uranium ore]] grade of 0.01% U3O8. This combination is considerably different than the hypothetical "worse-case scenario" of 110 grams, as this latter combination is seen in some select countries. Namely Sweden, Switzerland and the [[Nuclear power in france|French electricity grid]] as the most prominent. With this close to 4 gram value, reported by the Swedish [[Vattenfall]] study discussed below.

In the most common and pertinent case of GHG data from countries with a "medium carbon" intensity electric grid and input ores of about 0.01%. The median value of GHG emissions was determined to be about 9 grams, as depicted in figure 4 of the Yale paper, when the now world-standard "centrifuge" enrichment approach alone, is assessed.&lt;ref name="Warner + Heath, JoIE" /&gt; In [[Gaseous diffusion#Current status|2013 the other less economic approach]] of "[[Gaseous diffusion#Current status|diffusion]]" enrichment, that is similarly depicted in figure 4 was retired worldwide. When it operated the median GHG value that the Yale analyst's depict for this old technology was about 15 grams under the same "medium carbon" grid conditions.&lt;ref name="Warner + Heath, JoIE" /&gt;

The authors of the Yale paper also note that a "similar but less extreme dynamic relationship between ore grades and fossil energy consumption could apply to [[Rare-earth element|rare-earth materials]] used in some renewable technologies".

Lastly, although the paper primarily dealt with data derived from legacy [[Generation II reactor]]s, it did also summarize the Life Cycle Assessment literature of more advanced reactor designs, of which presently only small numbers are in operation, e.g. the [[BN-800]]. "''[[Fast Breeder Reactor]]s'' have been evaluated in the LCA literature. The limited literature that evaluates this potential future technology reports median life cycle GHG emissions... similar to or lower than LWRs and purports to consume little or no uranium ore."&lt;ref name="Warner + Heath, JoIE" /&gt;

== 2008 Benjamin K. Sovacool survey of nuclear power ==
A [[meta analysis]] of 103 nuclear power life-cycle studies by [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] found that nuclear power plants produce electricity with a [[mean]] of 66&amp;nbsp;g equivalent life-cycle carbon dioxide emissions per kWh, compared to renewable power generators, which produce electricity with 9.5 to 38&amp;nbsp;g carbon dioxide per kWh, and [[fossil-fuel power station]]s, which produce electricity with about 443 to 1,050&amp;nbsp;g equivalent life cycle carbon dioxide emissions per kWh.&lt;ref name="Benjamin K. Sovacool-EP-2008.Vol.36" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/environment/climate-change/nuclear-power-greenhouse-gases/ | title=Valuing the Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Nuclear Power}} JournalistsResource.org, retrieved 2012-03-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="O.R.G." /&gt; Sovacool thus concludes that nuclear energy technologies are seven to sixteen times more effective at fighting climate change than fossil fuel power plants on a per-kWh basis. Renewable electricity technologies are "two to seven times more effective than nuclear power plants on a per kWh basis at fighting climate change." Sovacool has said that his estimates already include all conceivable emissions associated with the manufacturing, construction, installation and decommissioning of renewable power plants.&lt;ref name="Benjamin K. Sovacool 2010, p. 386"/&gt;

Sovacool has been criticized by his peers, as it was noted that his paper was overly based on data from [[Jan Willem Storm van Leeuwen]].&lt;ref name="Beerten" /&gt;  Beerten et al. state:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Most recently, Sovacool (2008) calculated a mean value for the overall emissions by averaging the global results of 19 LCA [Life-Cycle Analysis] studies forming a subset of, as stated by the author, 'the most current, original and transparent studies' out of 103 studies. However, a critical assessment reveals that a majority of the studies representing the upper part of the spectrum are studies that can be traced back to the same input data and performed by the same author, namely Storm van Leeuwen. After careful analysis, it must be concluded that the mix of selected LCAs results in a skewed and distorted collection of different results available in the literature. Furthermore, since many studies use different energy mixes and other assumptions, averaging GHG emissions of those studies is no sound method to calculate an overall emission coefficient, as it gives no site specific information needed for policy makers to base their decisions."&lt;ref name="Beerten" /&gt;

Beerten, et al., proceed to discuss reasons why LCA analysis for nuclear power plants can give such widely varying estimates. For example, life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of nuclear power depend on the [[nuclear enrichment|enrichment method]], the [[carbon intensity]] of the electricity used for enrichment, the efficiency of the plant, as well as on chosen mining technologies. Averages and means from multiple sources can be skewed by inharmonious data, clustering bias, by outliers and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dolan|first=Stacey L.|author2=Heath, Garvin A. |title=Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Utility-Scale Wind Power|journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology|date=April 2012|volume=16|issue=Supplement S1|pages=S136–S154|doi=10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00464.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00464.x/full|accessdate=2014-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been responses to these criticisms, particularly in reference to Sovacool applying his methodology to nuclear power but using other researchers' results, from different methodologies, as the source of the above-tabled Wind and Solar energy figures. For example, Sovacool and his colleague Daniel Nugent would embark on studying these other energy sources by the same methodology in 2013. Their paper reports that wind energy has a mean value of 34.11 grams of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq/kWh and solar PV a mean value of 49.91 grams of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq/kWh, with the minimum for wind being 0.4&amp;nbsp;g and the maximum 364.8&amp;nbsp;g and a minimum for Solar PV of 1&amp;nbsp;g and a maximum of 218&amp;nbsp;g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2013.10.048 | volume=65 | title=Assessing the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from solar PV and wind energy: A critical meta-survey | journal=Energy Policy | pages=229–244| year=2014 | last1=Nugent | first1=Daniel | last2=Sovacool | first2=Benjamin K. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Missing life cycle phases==
Although the life cycle assessments of each energy source should attempt to cover the full life cycle of the source from cradle-to-grave, they are generally limited to the construction and operation phase. The most rigorously studied phases are those of material and fuel mining, construction, operation, and waste management. However, missing life cycle phases&lt;ref name="Warner + Heath, JoIE" /&gt; exist for a number of energy sources. At times, assessments variably and sometimes inconsistently include the global warming potential that results from decommissioning the energy supplying facility, once it has reached its designed life-span. This includes the global warming potential of the process to return the power-supply site to [[greenfield status]]. For example, the process of [[hydroelectric]] [[dam removal]] is usually excluded as it is a rare practice with little practical data available. Dam removal however may become increasingly common as dams age. An example of this is the [[Bull Run Hydroelectric Project#Decommissioning|decommissioning of the Bull Run Hydroelectric Project]], which was the largest concrete dam ever removed in the United States as of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Retrieved on 2013-02-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, decommissioning estimates are generally omitted for some energy sources, while other energy sources include a decommissioning phase in their assessments.

Along with the other prominent values of the paper, the median value presented of 12&amp;nbsp;g {{CO2}}-eq/kWhe for nuclear fission, found in the 2012 [[Yale University]] nuclear power review, a paper which also serves as the origin of the 2014 IPCC's nuclear value,&lt;ref&gt;http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_Annex_II.pdf pg 40&lt;/ref&gt; does however include the contribution of facility decommissioning with an "Added facility decommissioning" global warming potential in the full nuclear [[life cycle assessment]].&lt;ref name="Warner + Heath, JoIE" /&gt;

== Other studies ==
[[File:Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Electricity Production IEA.PNG|thumb|right|"Hydropower-Internalised Costs and Externalised Benefits"; Frans H. Koch; [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA)-Implementing Agreement for Hydropower Technologies and Programmes; 2000.]]

Individual studies show a wide range of estimates for fuel sources arising from the different methodologies used. Those on the low end tend to leave parts of the life cycle out of their analysis, while those on the high end often make unrealistic assumptions about the amount of energy used in some parts of the life cycle.&lt;ref name="Nature-2008.09" /&gt;

In 2007 the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] stated that total life-cycle GHG emissions per unit of electricity produced from nuclear power are below 40&amp;nbsp;g {{CO2}}-eq/kWh (10&amp;nbsp;g C-eq/kWh), similar to those for renewable energy sources.&lt;ref name="IPCC" /&gt; The Swedish utility [[Vattenfall]] did a study in 1999 of full life cycle emissions of nuclear, hydro, coal, gas, solar cell, peat, and wind. All the energy sources that the electricity utility actively has experience using to generate electricity. The findings of their study showed that nuclear power produced 3.3 grams of carbon dioxide per kW-hr of produced power. This compares to 400 for [[natural gas]] and 700 for [[coal]] (according to this study). The study also concluded that nuclear power produced the smallest amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of any of their electricity sources.&lt;ref&gt;nuclearinfo.net. [http://nuclearinfo.net/Nuclearpower/WebHomeGreenhouseEmissionsOfNuclearPower Greenhouse Emissions of Nuclear Power]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Greenhouse emissions by electricity source.PNG|300px|right| The Vattenfall study found nuclear, hydro, and wind to have far less greenhouse emissions than other sources represented.]]

Another report, "Life-Cycle Energy Balance and Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Nuclear Energy in Australia," conducted by the [[University of Sydney]] in 2008, produced the following results: nuclear = 60-65&amp;nbsp;g {{CO2}}/kWh; wind power = 20&amp;nbsp;g/kWh; solar PV = 106&amp;nbsp;g/kWh. The likely range of values from this study produced the following results: nuclear = 10-130&amp;nbsp;g {{CO2}}/kWh; wind power = 13-40&amp;nbsp;g {{CO2}}/kWh; solar PV = 53-217&amp;nbsp;g {{CO2}}/kWh. Furthermore, the study criticised the Vattenfall report: "it omits the energy and greenhouse gas impacts of many upstream [mining] contributions."&lt;ref name=syd/&gt; In a study conducted in 2006 by the UK's [[Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology]] (POST), which used figures from  [[Torness Nuclear Power Station]]-an [[Advanced gas-cooled reactor]],&lt;ref name=Briten /&gt; nuclear power's life cycle was evaluated to emit the least amount of carbon dioxide (very close to wind power's life cycle emissions) when compared to the other alternatives ([[fossil fuel]], [[coal]], and some [[renewable energy]] including [[biomass]] and PV [[solar panels]]).
&lt;ref name="POST"/&gt;

A 2005 study,&lt;ref name="Stormsmith" /&gt; by [[Jan Willem Storm van Leeuwen]], reported that carbon dioxide emissions from nuclear power plants per kilowatt hour could range from 20% to 120% of those for [[natural gas]]-fired power stations depending on the availability of high grade ores.&lt;ref name="Stormsmith" /&gt; Although the [[Jan Willem Storm van Leeuwen#Nuclear energy study|study was heavily criticized]], the paper was used by anti-nuclear organizations to claim that nuclear power is not suitable for a warming world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feasta.org/documents/energy/nuclear_power2.htm|title=Why Nuclear Power Cannot be a Major Energy Source|author=David Fleming|date=April 2006|accessdate=2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==GHG from utility-scale wind power==
{{See also|Fuel economy in automobiles#Speed and fuel economy studies|electric grid}}
High electric grid penetration by [[intermittent power sources]] (e.g. wind power) which have low [[capacity factor]]s due to the weather, requires either: a) the construction of [[List of energy storage projects|energy storage projects]], which have their own emission intensity, or b) more frequent back up than the reserve requirements necessary to back up more dependable/[[baseload power]] sources, such as [[hydropower]] and nuclear energy. This higher dependence on back up/[[load following power plant]]s to ensure a steady [[power grid]] output has the knock-on effect of more frequent inefficient (in {{CO2}}e g/kWh) [[throttle|throttling]] up and down of these other power sources in the grid to facilitate the intermittent, or variable output, of these energy supplying systems. When one includes the total effect of these intermittent sources as it pertains to the other power sources in the grid system, that is, including the inefficient start-up emissions of the backup power supplies to cater for wind energy; into wind energy's total system-wide life cycle, the result is a higher real-world wind energy emission intensity than the calculated and isolated wind energy g/kWh value. As these calculations look at the wind power source in isolation and exclude all down stream detrimental/inefficiency effects on the grid. In a 2012 paper in the ''Journal of Industrial Ecology'', Dolan and Heath state:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00464.x/full |title=Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Utility-Scale Wind Power Systematic Review and Harmonization | doi=10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00464.x | volume=16 |journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology |pages=S136–S154|year=2012 |last1=Dolan |first1=Stacey L. |last2=Heath |first2=Garvin A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|"The [[thermal efficiency]] of fossil-based power plants is reduced when operated at fluctuating and suboptimal loads to supplement wind power, which may degrade, to a certain extent, the GHG benefits resulting from the addition of wind to the grid. A study conducted by Pehnt and colleagues (2008) reports that a moderate level of [grid] wind penetration (12%) would result in efficiency penalties of 3% to 8%, depending on the type of conventional power plant considered. Gross and colleagues (2006) report similar results, with efficiency penalties ranging from nearly 0% to 7% for up to 20% [of grid] wind penetration. Pehnt and colleagues (2008) conclude that the results of adding offshore wind power in Germany on the background power systems maintaining a level supply to the grid and providing enough reserve capacity amount to adding between 20 and 80 g CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq/kWh to the life cycle GHG emissions profile of wind power."}}

==Heat from thermal power plants==
[[Thermal power plants]], that is, those that produce thermal/heat energy, with common [[low carbon power]] examples such as biomass, nuclear and [[geothermal]] energy stations, directly add heat energy to the earth's [[Earth's energy budget|global energy balance]]. According to [[David JC MacKay]], assuming that all future energy is derived from these thermal power stations operating with their present [[thermal efficiency]] of [[Supercritical fluid#Supercritical fluid in power generation|~30%]], and that the [[world population]] is 10 [[1,000,000,000|billion]] in 100 years time (~2100) with each individual enjoying a [[per capita]] [[energy usage]] rate similar to that of the average [[standard of living|European standard of living]] of 125 kWh per day, the extra power contributed by this thermal energy use to the planet would be a global surface area average of 0.1 Watt per [[square meter]], which is one fortieth of the 4&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; that is believed to be likely if a [[Climate sensitivity|doubling of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations occur]], and a little smaller than the "0.25 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; effect" of [[Solar variation]]s. "Under these assumptions, human power production would ''just'' show up as a contributor to global climate change."&lt;ref name="withouthotair"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.withouthotair.com/c24/page_170.shtml|title=Ch 24 Page 170: Sustainable Energy - without the hot air &amp;#124; David MacKay|website=withouthotair.com|accessdate=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heating and potential cooling from wind turbines==
An [[MIT]] peer-reviewed study suggested that using [[wind turbine]]s to meet 10 percent of global energy demand in 2100 could have a warming effect, causing temperatures to rise by {{convert|1|C-change}} in the regions on land where the wind farms are installed, including a smaller increase in areas beyond those regions. This is due to the effect of wind turbines on both horizontal and vertical [[atmospheric circulation]]. While turbines installed in water would have a cooling effect, the net impact on global surface temperatures would be an increase of {{convert|0.15|C-change}}. Author Ron Prinn said that the study hadn't conclusively proved this and cautioned against interpreting the study "as an argument against wind power." He urged instead that it guide future research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/climate-wind-0312.html MIT analysis suggests generating electricity from large-scale wind farms could influence climate — and not necessarily in the desired way] MIT, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

While observations of the regional temperature increase from the operation of wind farms has since become incontrovertible.&lt;ref&gt;Observations of surface layer, boundary layer, and mesoscale interactions with a wind farm 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Models on projections for 2020 and 2030 have found varying levels of effects depending on placement and the percentage contribution to total electricity generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fitch|first=Anna C.|date=August 2015|title=Climate Impacts of Large-Scale Wind Farms as Parameterized in a Global Climate Model|url=https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00245.1|journal=Journal of Climate|language=en|volume=28|issue=15|pages=6160–6180|doi=10.1175/jcli-d-14-00245.1|issn=0894-8755}}&lt;/ref&gt; With one model returning an expected warming from the analysis of a baseline 34% grid penetration in the EU, resulting in an estimated 0.1 Celsius increase in temperatures in that area, with the largest warming effect occurring in the winter season were "~0.3" Celsius in the northern part of the continent is expected, alongside changes in percipitation rates on the order of 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vautard|first=Robert|last2=Thais|first2=Françoise|last3=Tobin|first3=Isabelle|last4=Bréon|first4=François-Marie|last5=de Lavergne|first5=Jean-Guy Devezeaux|last6=Colette|first6=Augustin|last7=Yiou|first7=Pascal|last8=Ruti|first8=Paolo Michele|date=2014-02-11|title=Regional climate model simulations indicate limited climatic impacts by operational and planned European wind farms|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4196|journal=Nature Communications|language=En|volume=5|issue=1|doi=10.1038/ncomms4196|issn=2041-1723}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2018 a Harvard study published in the journal ''Joule'' found that in a scenario were the U.S. used turbines to provide approximately all its present electricity needs, the nation’s average temperature would go up about 0.2 Celsius. With large variability, the central continental areas next to the wind turbines would see localized warming around 1.4 Celsius, while the East Coast would experience some cooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=MIT Technology Review |first=James |last=Temple |date=4 October 2018 |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612238/wide-scale-us-wind-power-could-cause-significant-warming/ |title= Wide-scale US wind power could cause significant warming }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Science |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/science/2018/10/05/harvard-study-says-wind-power-can-also-cause-some-warming/HgW5zl95zYWZaJ09eeXWKK/story.html |title= Harvard study says wind power can also cause some warming |first=Seth |last=Borenstein |date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of commonly and uncommonly used abbreviations which are used in the subject of an English [[Email#Header fields|email header]].

== Standard prefixes ==

These prefixes are usually automatically inserted by the email client.

* '''RE:''' or "Re:" followed by the subject line of a previous message indicates a "reply" to that message. Otherwise it may also stand for "regarding" a certain subject. It is not, though, as one might assume, an abbreviation of "'''re'''ply" or "'''re'''garding", but stands for "[[In re|re]]", the Latin ablative of "res", meaning "thing", "circumstance" (loosely "about", "concerning", "regarding"),&lt;ref name=rfc5322&gt;RFC 5322&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clyde Winfield Wilkinson, ''et al.'', ''Communicating through letters and reports'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=mTDZGdSSh4AC&amp;pg=PA19 p. 19]&lt;/ref&gt; and is expressly allowed for in the RFC 5322 email standard. 
* '''FW:''' a [[Email forwarding|forwarded]] message. Also written as "FWD:&amp;nbsp;", "Fwd:&amp;nbsp;" or "Fw:&amp;nbsp;". The recipient is informed that the email was originally sent to someone else, and that person has in turn forwarded a copy of the email to him or her.

== Non-standard prefixes ==

These words are inserted in the middle of or at the end of the subject, usually by the author.

* '''WAS:''' the [[Email#Header_fields|subject]] was changed. Not an abbreviation, but the word "[[wiktionary:was#English|was]]" (past tense of "be"). Also written as "Was:&amp;nbsp;" and "was:&amp;nbsp;". It indicates that the subject has changed since the previous email, e.g., "Do you know a good babysitter? (WAS: What should we do this weekend?)". This prevents confusion on the part of the recipient and avoids accusations of [[wiktionary:threadjacking|threadjacking]].
* '''OT:''' off topic. Used within an [[Threaded discussion|email thread]] to indicate that this particular reply is about a different topic than the rest of the thread, in order to avoid accusations of [[wiktionary:threadjacking|threadjacking]].
* '''EOM''' &amp;ndash; [[end of message]]. Also written as "Eom" or "eom". Used at the end of the subject when the entire content of the email is contained in the subject and the body remains empty. This saves the recipient's time because they then do not have to open the message.
* '''WFH''' &amp;ndash; Working from Home. Used in the subject line or body of the email.
* '''1L''' &amp;ndash; One Liner. Used at the beginning of the subject when the subject of the email is the only text contained in the email. This prefix indicates to the reader that it is not necessary to open the email. E.g., "1L: WFH today"
* '''NONB''' &amp;ndash; Non-business. Used at the beginning of the subject when the subject of the email is not related to business. This prefix indicates to the reader that the email is not about a work related or endorsed topic.

== Software development ==

The following prefixes are often used in software development:

* '''[ANNOUNCE]''', [ANN] &amp;ndash; [[Announcement (computing)|announcement]]. A new version of the software has been released.
* '''[BUG]''' &amp;ndash; bug report. A description of an error in the software.
* '''[PATCH]''' &amp;ndash; software patch. New code is attached to or included in the body of the message.

== Other English abbreviations ==

This is a list of abbreviations which are less commonly used in the subject of an English [[Email#Header fields|email header]]:

* '''AEAP''', meaning As Early As Possible.
* '''ASAP''', meaning As Soon As Possible.
* '''AB''', meaning Action By. Used with a time indicator to inform the recipient that the sender needs a task to be completed within a certain deadline, e.g. AB+2 meaning Action By 2 days.
* '''AR''', meaning Action Required. The recipient is informed that she is being given a task.
* '''COP''' or '''EOP''', meaning Close Of Play / End Of Play. Referring to end of the day in a playful perspective of seeing work as ''Play''
* '''FYA''', meaning [[wiktionary:FYA|For Your Action]]. The recipient is informed that she is being given a task. Can also mean For Your Amusement, For Your Attention, For Your Approval, For Your Assistance, For Your Awareness, For Your Authorization, or For Your Acknowledgement.

{{anchor|Abbreviations}}

== Abbreviations in other languages ==
The email client will typically check for an existing "Re:" when deciding whether or not to add one in front of the subject. However, clients may use different abbreviations if the computer is set up for a non-English language, e.g. "AW:" for German, and this can mean that a conversation between two participants can build up convoluted subject lines like "Re: AW: Re: AW: ..".

To avoid this, email clients may have an option to force the use of the standard English abbreviations even when all other features are presented in another language,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msoutlook.info/question/656 "Use RE: and FW: instead of localized subject prefix"], msoutlook.info&lt;/ref&gt; or to recognize other forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kb.mozillazine.org/Reply_indicators "Reply indicators"], mozillazine.org&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="894">In '''''Magnum Financial Holdings (Pty) Ltd (in liquidation) v Summerly''''', an important case in [[South African insolvency law]], the question to be decided was whether the trust before the court was susceptible of sequestration. This depended on whether it was a “debtor” as defined in section 2 of the Act.

The court held that, because the trust could, through its trustees, acquire property and incur liabilities, and because it was not a body corporate as contemplated by section 2, it fell within the meaning of the term “debtor” in that section.

The '''Museo Archeologico Ostiense''' (or ''Archaeological Museum of Ostia'') is an [[archaeological museum]] dedicated to the ancient Roman city of [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. 

The museum was built by [[Pope Pius IX]], who in 1865 had to readapt a fifteenth-century building used as a store to create a city museum. Contained in the museum are numerous archaeological objects which came to light during a long period of excavations. The collection includes, for example, a collection of portraits of famous people from ancient Ostia, including [[philosopher]]s and members of the royal family, such as busts depicting [[Asclepius]] and  Volcacius Myropnous,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ostia-antica.org/valkvisuals/html/tombe_07.htm|title=tombe 7|work=ostia-antica.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; a portrait of [[Faustina the Elder]] and the head of [[Trajan]]. The museum also has a large collection of sculptures, including the statue of [[Perseus]] holding the head of [[Medusa]], the sculptural group of [[Mithraic mysteries|Mithras]] slaying the bull, and other works. There are other examples on display of great interest, such as small groups in marble depicting [[Cupid and Psyche]] and other subjects, and in another section of the museum, [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] and [[relief]]s. On display are also examples of wall paintings from different burials and emblems of [[polychrome]] [[mosaic]]s, such as the [[Christ Blessing (Raphael)|Christ Blessing]]. These works of great historical and artistic value, are then supported by a collection of minor works such as crafts, glass, and even teaches some at the shop, and some interesting facts, such as the marble slab found in the temple of the goddess of war, [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]], on which are carved two pairs of feet opposite, probably a [[Votive offering|votive]] object.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musei.it/lazio/roma/museo-archeologico-ostiense.asp Museo Archeologico Ostiense di Roma] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207024020/http://www.musei.it/lazio/roma/museo-archeologico-ostiense.asp |date=2013-12-07 }}, Retrieved 18 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

It functions by creating a populated database information relevant to the life-cycle of a project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ogspace.com/the-pipeline-open-data-standard-domains-constraining-data-input/&lt;/ref&gt;

==PODS Model History==

Since its inception, the PODS Association has supported continued development of the PODS Data Model in order to meet the needs of the pipeline industry.  Government regulation and technological advancement of integrity and risk management applications have driven much of this progress. 

PODS 2.0, released in 2001, with less than 70 tables.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1408">'''Responsibility''' is a novel by [[New Zealand]] author [[Nigel Cox (author)|Nigel Cox]], published by [[Victoria University Press]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/books/news/article.cfm?c_id=134&amp;objectid=10329105 | title=Nigel Cox: Responsibility | work=[[New Zealand Herald]] | accessdate=June 11, 2011 | author=Barton, Chris | date=June 6, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel is set in contemporary [[Berlin]], and tells the story of an expatriate New Zealander who, whilst working as a consultant for [[Germany|German]] [[museum]]s, becomes embroiled in criminal activity out of boredom. The novel is notable for combining [[Hardboiled|noir]] and [[detective]] fiction clichés with [[comedy]], as well as having a serious emotional centre.

Much of the book's source material is drawn from Nigel Cox's own experiences living in Berlin, and working at the [[Jewish Museum Berlin|Jewish Museum]] there, between 2000 and 2005.

'''Simon of Kéza''' ({{lang-hu|Kézai Simon}}) was the most famous Hungarian chronicler of the 13th century. He was a priest in the royal court of king [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary]].

His most important work is ''[[Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum]]'', written in [[Latin]] around 1282, in which he gives a vivid description of the history of the [[Huns]] and the [[Hungarians]] (whom he considered relatives), from the legendary beginnings until the contemporary period. As a personal secretary of the king, he worked in the royal archives and collected his material from older chronicles conserved there.

The chronicle was first published in print in 1782 in [[Buda]]. In the 19th century it was translated into [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and became a popular work which helped the development of national consciousness.

'''''The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin''''' is a book published in 1887 edited by [[Francis Darwin]] about his father [[Charles Darwin]].  It contains a selection of 87 letters from the [[correspondence of Charles Darwin]], an autobiographical chapter written by Charles Darwin for his family, and an essay by [[Thomas Huxley]] "On the reception of the 'Origin of Species'".

It was published by Darwin's publisher [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]].

The autobiographical chapter was edited by Francis to remove references to [[Charles Darwin's views on religion|his father's views on religion]].  These were later reinstated and published as ''[[The Autobiography of Charles Darwin]]'' in 1958 by Charles's granddaughter (and Francis's niece) [[Nora Barlow]].

The book was the first real biography of Charles Darwin, excepting obituaries, and thus the foundation of the [[Darwin Industry]].

Further volumes of letters followed - ''[[More Letters of Charles Darwin]]'' in 1903.  Charles's wife [[Emma Darwin]]'s correspondence was published by Charles and Emma's daughter (Frank's sister) [[Henrietta Litchfield]] in 1905/1915 as ''[[Emma Darwin: A Century of Family Letters]]''.

The book received extensive reviews in ''[[The Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Saturday, Nov 19, 1887; pg. 7; Issue 32234; col A The Life Of Darwin.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]''&lt;ref&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/482522672&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was later described by ''[[The Times]]'' as "one of the best biographies ever written" and "In the selection and arrangement of the material he [Francis Darwin] was chiefly guided by a wish to portray his father's personal character, and he succeeded in a remarkable degree in giving a true picture of the man and the student, the methods of Darwin's work and the gradual development of his opinions."&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Monday, Sep 21, 1925; pg. 14; Issue 44072; col D&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Oxford Companion to Beer''''', abbreviated '''''OCB''''', is a book in the [[Book series|series]] of [[Oxford Companions]] published by [[Oxford University Press]]. The book provides an alphabetically arranged reference to [[beer]], compiled and edited by [[Garrett Oliver]] with a foreword by U.S. chef [[Tom Colicchio]]. Published in 2011, the work draws on 166 contributors from 24 countries to amass over 1,100 entries on beer.&lt;ref name=vvc&gt;Martineau, Chantal, ''The Village Voice'' (September 23, 2011).

[[Eric Asimov]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the work as a "mammoth undertaking ... encyclopedic in scope", and that the editor has "captured the blossoming of a global beer culture at a thriving moment".&lt;ref name=NYT-eaocb&gt;{{Cite web|last =Asimov |first =Eric ''The New York Times'' |title = Where to Look Up Dry-Hopping and Decoction |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/21/dining/reviews/the-ultimate-beer-guide-the-pour.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |date =September 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Criminal Law, Second Edition.''

==Background==
The defendant Peoni possessed bills that he knew to be [[counterfeit]].  He sold the bills to Regno, and Regno sold the bills to Dorsey.  Dorsey was arrested with the bills while trying to pass them in [[Brooklyn]].  At the trial level, Peoni was [[convicted]] as an accomplice to Dorsey's possession of the counterfeit bills.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie, p. 691&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion of the Court==
In an opinion by Judge [[Learned Hand]], the Second Circuit reversed Peoni's conviction.  The court looked to the [[statute]] under which Peoni was [[indicted]], [[Title 18 of the United States Code|18 U.S.C.]] § 550 (the predecessor to 18 U.S.C. § 2)&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|18|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which punished anyone who "aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures" the commission of a crime.  The court read this language to require purpose, and held that Peoni had no purpose regarding the use of the counterfeit bills once he had passed them to Regno.  Peoni had no purpose regarding Dorsey's possession because Regno was free to do whatever he wanted with the bills.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie, p. 692&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Zhongguo renming dacidian''''' (《中国人名大辞典》 first published 1921), literally '''''Great Biographical Dictionary of China''''' is the leading biographical dictionary in China, to some extent comparable with [[Who's Who]]. The publisher for 70 years is [[Commercial Press]], [[Shanghai]]. In English bibliographies it is sometimes referred to by English titles, even though an English version does not exist; sometimes by its Chinese title in pinyin.&lt;ref&gt;Cities in Post-Mao China: Recipes for Economic Development  1999 Page 134 Jae Ho Chung, Chae-ho Chŏng - 1999 "For Bi's biographical profile, see Zhongguo renming dacidian, p. 21. .."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;出版工作, 图书评介 1982 Page 74 Zhongguo ren min da xue.

The original 1921 editors were Fang Baoguan (方宝观), Fang Yi (方毅) and a team of 23 editors. Although the Chinese title is only used by Commercial Press, longer titles including the Commercial Press title have occasionally appeared from other publishers for more specialist works. For example, ''Zhongguo renming dacidian: xianren dang-zhengjun lingdao renwujuan'' (Who's Who in China - Current leaders in the Party Government and Military) is published by Beijing Foreign Languages Publishing House.&lt;ref&gt;Provincial Strategies of Economic Reform in Post-Mao China  Page 442 Peter T. Y. Cheung, Jae Ho Chung, Chae-ho Chŏng - 1998 "One key source concerns dictionaries on "who's who in the People's Republic," examples of which include Zhongguo renwu ... For references on more current leaders, Zhongguo renming dacidian: xianren dang-zhengjun lingdao renwujuan"&lt;/ref&gt;
