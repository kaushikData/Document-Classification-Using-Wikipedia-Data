{{Sociolinguistics}}

In [[sociolinguistics]], an '''accent''' is a manner of [[pronunciation]] peculiar to a particular individual, location, or nation.&lt;ref name="OAM"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=http://www.oup.com/us/brochure/noad/ |title=The New Oxford American Dictionary. Second Edition. |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2005 |isbn=0-19-517077-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; An accent may be identified with the locality in which its speakers reside (a regional or geographical accent), the [[socioeconomic status]] of its speakers, their [[ethnicity]], their [[caste]] or [[social class]] (a social accent), or influence from their [[first language]] (a foreign accent).&lt;ref name=Lippi-Green&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lippi-Green |first=R. |year=1997 |title=English with an Accent: Language, Ideology, and Discrimination in the United States |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-11476-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accents typically differ in quality of the voice, pronunciation and distinction of vowels and consonants, stress, and [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of Language and Linguistics|last=Crystal|first=David|publisher=Blackwell|year=2008|isbn=|location=Malden-Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although grammar, semantics, vocabulary, and other language characteristics often vary concurrently with accent, the word "accent" may refer specifically to the differences in pronunciation, whereas the word "[[dialect]]" encompasses the broader set of linguistic differences. Often "accent" is a [[subset]] of "dialect".&lt;ref name="OAM" /&gt;

==History==
As human beings spread out into isolated communities, stresses and peculiarities develop. Over time, they can develop into identifiable accents. In [[North America]], the interaction of people from many ethnic backgrounds contributed to the formation of the different varieties of North American accents. It is difficult to measure or predict how long it takes an accent to formulate. Accents in the [[US]], [[Canada]], [[South Africa]] and [[Australia]], for example, developed from the combinations of different accents and languages in various societies and their effect on the various pronunciations of British settlers.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;{{Cite web|accessdate=2016-04-10 |url=http://linguist.emich.edu/ask-ling/accent.html |publisher=LINGUIST List|title=Ask a Linguist FAQ: Accents |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008000501/http://linguist.emich.edu/ask-ling/accent.html |archivedate=2008-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, the accents of non-English settlers from the British Isles affected the accents of the different colonies quite differently. Irish, Scottish and Welsh immigrants had accents which greatly affected the vowel pronunciation of certain areas of Australia and Canada.&lt;ref name="FAQ" /&gt;

==Development==
{{Main|Sound change}}
{{Expand section|date=September 2010}}
Children are able to take on accents relatively quickly. Children of immigrant families, for example, generally have a more native-like pronunciation than their parents, but both children and parents may have a noticeable non-native accent.&lt;ref name=Flege&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.wocn.2005.05.001|last=Flege |first=James Emil |author2=David Birdsong|author3=Ellen Bialystok|author4=Molly Mack|author5=Hyekyung Sung|author6= Kimiko Tsukada |title=Degree of foreign accent in English sentences produced by Korean children and adults |journal=Journal of Phonetics |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=153–175|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accents seem to remain relatively malleable until a person's early twenties, after which a person's accent seems to become more entrenched.&lt;ref name="FAQ" /&gt;

All the same, accents are not fixed even in adulthood. An acoustic analysis by Jonathan Harrington of [[Elizabeth II]]'s [[Royal Christmas Message]]s revealed that the speech patterns of even so conservative a figure as a monarch can continue to change over her lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harrington |first=Jonathan |title=An Acoustic Analysis of 'Happy Tensing' in the Queen's Christmas Broadcasts |journal=Journal of Phonetics |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=439–57 |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/j.wocn.2005.08.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-native accents==
An important factor in predicting the degree to which the accent will be noticeable (or strong) is the age at which the non-native language was learned.&lt;ref name=Scovel2000&gt;Scovel, T. (2000). "A critical review of the critical period research." ''Annual Review of Applied Linguistics'', 20, 213–223.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Piske&gt;Piske, T., MacKay, I. R. A., &amp; Flege, J. E. (2001). "Factors affecting degree of foreign accent in an L2: A review." ''Journal of Phonetics'', 29, 191–215.&lt;/ref&gt; The critical period theory states that if learning takes place after the critical period (usually considered around puberty) for acquiring native-like pronunciation, an individual is unlikely to acquire a native-like accent.&lt;ref name=Scovel2000/&gt; This theory, however, is quite controversial among researchers.&lt;ref name="Mahdi"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mahdi|first=Rahimian,|date=2018|title=Accent, intelligibility, and identity in international teaching assistants and internationally-educated instructors|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1993/33028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many subscribe to some form of the critical period, they either place it earlier than puberty or consider it more of a critical “window,” which may vary from one individual to another and depend on factors other than age, such as length of residence, similarity of the non-native language to the native language, and the frequency with which both languages are used.&lt;ref name=Piske/&gt;

Nevertheless, children as young as 6 at the time of moving to another country often speak with a noticeable non-native accent as adults.&lt;ref name=Flege/&gt; There are also rare instances of individuals who are able to pass for native speakers even if they learned their non-native language in early adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Bongaerts, T., van Summeren, C., Planken, B., &amp; Schils, E. (1997). "Age and ultimate attainment in the pronunciation of a foreign language." ''Studies in Second Language Acquisition'', 19, 447–465.&lt;/ref&gt; However, neurological constraints associated with brain development appear to limit most non-native speakers’ ability to sound native-like.&lt;ref&gt;Long, M. H. (1990). "[https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/38596/1/Long%20(1988)_WP7(1).pdf Maturational constraints on language development]." ''Studies in Second Language Acquisition'', 12, 251–285.&lt;/ref&gt; Most researchers agree that for adults, acquiring a native-like accent in a non-native language is near impossible.&lt;ref name=Scovel2000/&gt;

==Social factors==
When a group defines a [[standard language|standard pronunciation]], speakers who deviate from it are often said to "speak with an accent".&lt;ref name="Mahdi" /&gt; However, everyone speaks with an accent.&lt;ref name=Lippi-Green/&gt;&lt;ref name=Matsuda&gt;Matsuda, M. J. (1991). "Voices of America: Accent, antidiscrimination law, and a jurisprudence for the last reconstruction." ''Yale Law Journal'', 100, 1329–1407.&lt;/ref&gt; People from the [[United States]] would "speak with an accent" from the point of view of an [[Australian]], and vice versa.  Accents such as [[Received Pronunciation|BBC English]] or [[General American]] may sometimes be erroneously designated in their countries of origin as "accentless" to indicate that they offer no obvious clue to the speaker's regional or social background.&lt;ref name=Lippi-Green/&gt;

===Being understood===
Many teachers of English as a second language neglect to teach speech/pronunciation.&lt;ref name=Georgetown&gt;Morley, Joan. "Acquisition, instruction, standards, variation, and accent" Georgetown University Round Table on Languages and Linguistics 1996: Linguistics, language acquisition, and language variation: current trends and future prospects. Comp. James E. Alatis. Georgetown University Press. pp 140–160. https://books.google.com/books?id=R8jZ62kA9akC&lt;/ref&gt;  Many adult and near-adult learners of second languages have unintelligible speech patterns that may interfere with their education, profession, and social interactions.&lt;ref name=Georgetown/&gt;  Pronunciation in a second or foreign language involves more than the correct articulation of individual sounds. It involves producing a wide range of complex and subtle distinctions which relate sound to meaning at several levels.&lt;ref name=Georgetown /&gt;

Teaching of speech/pronunciation is neglected in part because of the following myths:
* Pronunciation isn't important: "This is patently false from any perspective."&lt;ref name=Georgetown /&gt; Speech/Pronunciation forms the vehicle for transmitting the speaker's meaning.   If the listener does not understand the message, no communication takes place, and although there are other factors involved, one of the most important is the intelligibility of the speaker's pronunciation.&lt;ref name=Georgetown/&gt;
* Students will pick it up on their own: "Some will learn to pronounce the second language intelligibly; many will not."&lt;ref name=Georgetown /&gt;
Inadequate instruction in speech/pronunciation can result in a complete breakdown in communication.&lt;ref name=Georgetown /&gt; The proliferation of commercial "accent reduction" services is seen as a sign that many [[English as a Second Language|ESL]] teachers are not meeting their students' needs for speech/pronunciation instruction.&lt;ref name=Georgetown /&gt;

The goals of speech/pronunciation instruction should  include:  to help the learner speak in a way that is easy to understand and does not distract the listener, to increase the self-confidence of the learner, and to develop the skills to self-monitor and adapt one's own speech.&lt;ref name=Georgetown /&gt;

Even when the listener does understand the speaker, the presence of an accent that is difficult to understand can produce anxiety in the listener that he will not understand what comes next, and cause him to end the conversation earlier or avoid difficult topics.&lt;ref name=Georgetown /&gt;

Intelligibility of speech, in comparison to native-like accent, has been experimentally reported to be of greater importance for the second language speakers. As such ways of increasing intelligibility of speech has been recommended by some researchers within the field.&lt;ref name="Mahdi" /&gt;

===Prestige===
Certain accents are perceived to carry more [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] in a society than other accents. This is often due to their association with the elite part of society. For example, in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Received Pronunciation]] of the English language is associated with the traditional [[upper class]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-12|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~hlw/PhonProcess/accents.html|publisher=Indiana University|title=Accents| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614210049/http://www.indiana.edu/~hlw/PhonProcess/accents.html| archivedate=14 June 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same can be said about the predominance of [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeastern Brazilian]] accents in the case of the [[Brazilian Portuguese|Brazilian variant]] of the [[Portuguese language]], especially considering the disparity of prestige between most ''[[caipira dialect|caipira]]''-influenced speech, associated with rural environment and lack of formal education,&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.poiesis.org.br/files/mlp/texto_16.pdf To know a language is really about separating correct from awry? Language is a living organism that varies by context and goes far beyond a collection of rules and norms of how to speak and write] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222082936/http://www.poiesis.org.br/files/mlp/texto_16.pdf |date=December 22, 2012 }} [[Museu da Língua Portuguesa]]. Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; together with the Portuguese spoken in some other communities of lower [[Social class|socioeconomic strata]] such as ''[[favela]]'' dwellers, and other sociocultural variants such as middle and upper class ''paulistano'' (dialect spoken from [[Greater São Paulo]] to the East) and ''[[Carioca#Sociolect|fluminense]]'' (dialect spoken in [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|the state of Rio de Janeiro]]) to the other side, inside Southeastern Brazil itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.lendo.org/preconceito-linguistico-o-portugues-do-brasil-apresenta-uma-unidade-surpreendente/ Linguistic prejudice and the surprising (academic and formal) unity of Brazilian Portuguese]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in linguistics, there is no differentiation among accents in regard to their prestige, aesthetics, or correctness. All languages and accents are linguistically equal.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, J. (1999). "Refining our understanding of language attitudes." ''Journal of Language and Social Psychology'', 18, 101–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accent stereotyping and prejudice===
Stereotypes refer to specific characteristics, traits, and roles that a group and its members are believed to possess.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, D. L., &amp; Sherman, S. J. (1996). "Perceiving persons and groups." ''Psychological'' Review, 103, 336–355.&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotypes can be both positive and negative, although negative are more common.

Stereotypes may result in prejudice, which is defined as having negative attitudes toward a group and its members.&lt;ref&gt;Biernat, M., &amp; Dovidio, J. F. (2000). "Stigma and stereotypes." In T. F. Heatherton, R. E. Kleck, M. R. Hebl, &amp; J. G. Hull (Eds.), ''The Social Psychology of Stigma'' (pp. 88–125). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with non-standard accents often have to deal with both negative stereotypes and prejudice because of an accent.&lt;ref name=Gluszek&gt;Gluszek, A., &amp; Dovidio, J. F. (2010). "The way they speak: Stigma of non-native accents in communication." ''Personality and Social Psychology Review'', 14, 214–237.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers consistently show that people with non-native accents are judged as less intelligent, less competent, less educated, having poor English/language skills, and unpleasant to listen to.&lt;ref name=Gluszek /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bradac, J. J. (1990). "Language attitudes and impression formation." In H. Giles &amp; W. P. Robinson (Eds.), ''Handbook of Language and Social psychology'' (pp. 387–412). London: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bresnahan, M. J., Ohashi, R., Nebashi, R., Liu, W. Y., &amp; Shearman, S. M. (2002). "Attitudinal and affective response toward accented English." ''Language and Communication'', 22, 171–185.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cargile, A. C., &amp; Giles, H. (1997). "Understanding language attitudes: Exploring listener affect and identity." ''Language and Communication'', 17, 195–217.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nesdale, D., &amp; Rooney, R. (1996). "Evaluations and stereotyping of accented speakers by pre-adolescent children." ''Journal of Language and Social Psychology'', 15, 133–154.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only people with standard accents subscribe to these beliefs and attitudes, but individuals with accents also often stereotype against their own or others' accents.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Accent discrimination===
{{POV|date=March 2017}}
Discrimination refers to specific behaviors or actions directed at a group or its individual members based solely on the group membership. In accent discrimination, one's way of speaking is used as a basis for arbitrary evaluations and judgments.&lt;ref&gt;Ng, S. H. (2007). "Language-based discrimination: Blatant and subtle forms." ''Journal of Language and Social Psychology'', 26, 106–122.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other forms of discrimination, there are no strong norms against accent discrimination in the general society. Rosina Lippi-Green writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Accent serves as the first point of gate keeping because we are forbidden, by law and social custom, and perhaps by a prevailing sense of what is morally and ethically right, from using race, ethnicity, homeland or economics more directly. We have no such compunctions about language, thus, accent becomes a litmus test for exclusion, and excuse to turn away, to recognize the other.&lt;ref name=Lippi-Green /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Speakers with certain accents often experience discrimination in housing and employment.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, B., Ondrich, J., &amp; Yinger, J. (2006). "Why do real estate brokers continue to discriminate? Evidence from the 2000 Housing Discrimination Study." ''Journal of Urban Economics'', 59, 394–419.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rubin&gt;Rubin, D. L. (2002). "Help! My professor (or doctor or boss) doesn’t speak English." In J. N. Martin, T. K. Nakayama, &amp; L. A. Flores (Eds.), ''Readings in Intercultural Communication: Experiences and Contexts'' (pp. 127–137). Boston: McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, speakers who have foreign or ethnic-minority accents are less likely to be called back by landlords and are more likely to be assigned by employers to lower status positions than those with standard accents.&lt;ref&gt;de la Zerda, N., &amp; Hopper, R. (1979). "Employment interviewers' reactions to Mexican American speech." ''Communication Monographs'', 46, 126–134.&lt;/ref&gt; In business settings, individuals with non-standard accents are more likely to be evaluated negatively.&lt;ref&gt;Tsalikis, J., Ortiz-Buonafina, M., &amp; La Tour, M. S. (1992). "The role of accent on the credibility and effectiveness of the international business-person: The case of Guatemala." ''International Marketing Review'', 9, 57–72.&lt;/ref&gt; Accent discrimination is also present in educational institutions. For example, non-native speaking graduate students, lecturers, and professors, across college campuses in the US have been targeted for being unintelligible because of accent.&lt;ref&gt;Mastitis, A. (2005). "U.S. academic institutions and perceived effectiveness of foreign-born faculty." ''Journal of Economic Issues'', 39, 151–176.&lt;/ref&gt; Second language speakers have reported being discriminated against, or feeling marginalized for, when they attempted to find a job in higher ranking positions mainly because their accents.&lt;ref name="Mahdi" /&gt; On average, however, students taught by non-native English speakers do not underperform when compared to those taught by native speakers of English.&lt;ref&gt;Fleisher, B., Hashimoto, M., &amp; Weinberg, B. A. (2002). "Foreign GTAs can be effective teachers of economics." ''Journal of Economic Education'', 33, 299–325.&lt;/ref&gt; Some English native-speaker students in Canada reported a preference for non-native speaker instructors as long as the instructor's speech is intelligible. This was due to the psychological impacts such a circumstances has on the students requiring them to pay closer attention to the instructor to ensure they understand him/her.&lt;ref name="Mahdi" /&gt;

Studies have shown the perception of the accent, not the accent by itself, often results in negative evaluations of speakers. In a study conducted by Rubin (1992), students listened to a taped lecture recorded by a native English speaker with a standard accent. They were then shown an image of the "lecturer", sometimes Asian-looking, sometimes white. Participants in the study who saw the Asian picture believed that they had heard an accented lecturer and performed worse on a task that measured lecture comprehension.  Negative evaluations may reflect the prejudices rather than real issues with understanding accents.&lt;ref name=Rubin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, D. L. (1992). "Non language factors affecting undergraduates' judgments of nonnative English-speaking teaching assistants." ''Research in Higher Education'', 33, 511–531.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal implications===
In the United States, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on national origin, implying accents. However, employers may claim that a person's accent impairs his or her communication skills that are necessary to the effective business operation.&lt;ref name=Matsuda/&gt; The courts often rely on the employer's claims or use judges’ subjective opinions when deciding whether the (potential) employee's accent would interfere with communication or performance, without any objective proof that accent was or might be a hindrance.&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen, B. B.-D. (1993). "Accent discrimination and the Test of Spoken English: A call for an objective assessment of the comprehensibility of nonnative speakers." ''California Law Review'', 81, 1325–1361.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kentucky's highest court in the case of ''Clifford vs. Commonwealth'' held that a white police officer, who had not seen the black defendant allegedly involved in a drug transaction, could, nevertheless, identify him as a participant by saying that a voice on an audiotape "sounded black". The police officer based this "identification" on the fact that the defendant was the only African American man in the room at the time of the transaction and that an audio-tape contained the voice of a man the officer said "sounded black" selling crack cocaine to a European American informant planted by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-12|url=http://academic.udayton.edu/race/03justice/justice01.htm|publisher=Courtroom: Court sanctioned Racial Stereotyping, 18 Harvard BlackLetter Law Journal 185–210, 185–188 (Spring, 2002)(179 Footnotes)|title=Race, Racism and the Law| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529044927/http://academic.udayton.edu/race/03justice/justice01.htm| archivedate=29 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acting and accents===
Actors are often called upon to speak varieties of language other than their own. Similarly, an actor may portray a character of some nationality other than his or her own by adopting into the native language the phonological profile typical of the nationality to be portrayed in what is commonly called "speaking with an accent".

Accents may have stereotypical associations. For example, in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] animated films mothers and fathers typically speak with white middle class American or English accents.&lt;ref name="Lippi-Green" /&gt; English accents in Disney animated films are frequently employed to serve one of two purposes, [[slapstick comedy]] or evil genius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A891155 |accessdate=2013-04-28 |title=Why Villains in Movies Have English Accents|origyear=January 15, 2003 |date= September 12, 2011|author=il viaggiatore |publisher=h2g2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Appears to be self-published or user-submitted content|date=April 2013}} Examples include ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' (the Sultan and [[Jafar (Disney)|Jafar]], respectively) and ''[[The Lion King]]'' ([[List of The Lion King characters#Zazu|Zazu]] and [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]], respectively), among others.

'''Abu al-Hasan, ‘Ali Ibn Hamzah al-Asadi''' ({{lang-ar|أبو الحسن علي بن حمزة الكسائي}}), better known as '''Al-Kisa'i''' (born 119 AH, 737 CE in [[Kufa]] - died 189 AH, 805 CE in Ranboyeh, near [[Rey, Iran|Rey]]), was one of the transmitters of the seven canonical [[Qira'at]], or methods of reciting the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref name=aware&gt;Muhammad Ghoniem and MSM Saifullah, [http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Quran/Text/Qiraat/the10.html The Ten Readers &amp; Their Transmitters].

He is said to have stayed for some time among the Bedouins in order to become fully conversant in Arabic. He is the real founder of the grammatical school of Kufa. His discussion with Sibawayhi, the prominent grammarian of the school of Basra, has become famous.}}&lt;/ref&gt; he learned Arabic grammar from [[Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi]] as well as [[Yunus ibn Habib]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Sībawayh | first =ʻAmr ibn ʻUthmān | publication-date =1988 | editor-last =Hārūn | editor-first =ʻAbd al-Salām Muḥammad | title =Al-Kitāb Kitāb Sībawayh Abī Bishr ʻAmr ibn ʻUthmān ibn Qanbar | edition =3rd | publication-place =Cairo | publisher =Maktabat al-Khānjī | volume =Introduction | pages =9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he gained fame during the reign of [[Harun al-Rashid]], so much that he was entrusted with the instruction of the caliph's son, [[al-Amin]]. Some of his notable students were Hisham b. Muawiyah and Yaḥya al-Farā'. The two primary transmitters of his method of recitation were al-Layth and [[Al-Duri]], the latter of whom was also a transmitter for the method of [[Abu 'Amr ibn al-'Ala']], the namesake of another one of the seven canonical recitations.&lt;ref name=aware/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shady Hekmat Nasser, [https://books.google.com.sa/books?id=Kx7i2Y56WuYC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=aasim+qira%27ah&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=aasim%20qira'ah&amp;f=false Ibn Mujahid and the Canonization of the Seven Readings], p. 129. Taken from ''The Transmission of the Variant Readings of the Qur'an: The Problem of Tawaatur and the Emergence of Shawaadhdh''. [[Leiden]]: [[Brill Publishers]], 2012. {{ISBN|9789004240810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Kisa'i died in the year 804CE.&lt;ref&gt;Shady Nasser, ''Canonization'', pg. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the seven canonical transmitters, [[Ibn Amir ad-Dimashqi]] was the oldest and al-Kisa'i was the youngest.&lt;ref&gt;Shady Nasser, ''Canonization'', pg. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Al-Kisā'i is the author of one of the collections of ''[[Stories of the Prophets]]'', which includes information not found in other collections nor repeated in later exegesis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Historical Dictionary of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'', Wheeler, ''Al-Kisa'i''&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Kisā'i often expanded upon early exegesis by elaborating a fuller narrative storyline and by adding folkloric elements from non-extant oral traditions&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; that often parallel those from [[Christianity]]. Al-Kisā'i's collection included [[Shem]] and [[Eleazar]] as [[prophet]]s, two figures who would not appear in later literature as prophets.

One of the more famous incidents of his career was his debate with Sibawayh that had been organized in [[Baghdad]] by [[Abbasid]] vizier [[Yahya ibn Khalid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Touati|first= Houari|last2= Cochrane|first2= Lydia G.|title= Islam and Travel in the Middle Ages|year= 2010|publisher= University of Chicago Press|isbn= 0-226-80877-7|page= 51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident became known as ''al-Mas'ala al-Zunburīyah'', "The Question of the Hornet," because one of the sentences involved translates as "I have always thought that the scorpion was more painful in stinging than the hornet, and sure enough it is."&lt;ref name=ver64&gt;[[Kees Versteegh]], ''The Arabic Linguistic Tradition'', pg. 64. Part of the ''Landmarks in Linguistic Thought'' series, vol. 3. [[London]]: [[Routledge]], 1997. {{ISBN|9780415157575}}&lt;/ref&gt; At issue was the form of the last word in the Arabic sentence. Sibawayh proposed:&lt;ref name="Carter 2004"&gt;M.G. Carter, ''Sibawayhi'', pg. 13. London: I.B. Tauris, 2004. {{ISBN|1850436711}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''... fa-'ida huwa hiya'' (فإذا هو هي), literally ''... sure-enough he she''&lt;/blockquote&gt;meaning "sure-enough he (the scorpion, masc.) is she (the most painful one, fem.)"; Arabic does not need or use any verb-form like ''is'' in such situations.
On the other side al-Kisa'i argued for:&lt;blockquote&gt;''... fa-'ida huwa 'iyyaha''(فإذا هو إياها), literally ''... sure-enough he her''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

meaning "he is her".{{efn|The difference has been compared to that in English between, for example, ''It is she'' and ''It is her'', still a point of contention today.}}

Sibawayh justified his position on theoretical grammatical grounds, arguing that an accusative form cannot be a predicate, but to his dismay al-Kisa'i ushered in four Bedouin who were pretending to have just happened to be waiting at the door; al-Kisa'i had bribed them to support his answer prior to the debate.&lt;ref name=ver64/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Franz Rosenthal]], ''A History of Muslim Historiography'', pg. 245. Leiden: Brill Archive, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; All of them testified that ''huwa 'iyyaha'' was the way they always said it and therefore Sibawayh was wrong and he left the court.&lt;ref name="Carter 2004"/&gt; Later, Sibawayh returned to his country bitter after the debate and died young. Al-Kisa'i was accosted by one of Sibawayh's students after the fact and asked 100 grammatical questions, being proved wrong by the student each time. Upon being told the news about Sibawayh's death, al-Kisa'i approached the Caliph al-Rashid and requested that he be punished for having a share in "killing Sibawayh."&lt;ref&gt;al-Qāsim Ibn-ʻAlī al- Ḥarīrī, ''The Assemblies of Al Ḥarîri: 1: containing the first 26 assemblies'', vol. 1, pg. 499.

The '''''American Catholic Philosophical Quarterly''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] sponsored by the [[American Catholic Philosophical Association]]. It was founded in 1927 as '''''The New Scholasticism''''' and adopted its current title in 1990. The journal publishes articles and book reviews covering the entire range and history of [[Western philosophy|Western philosophical thought]]. Contributions on non-Western [[philosophy]] are also published, especially if they shed light upon issues in the Western tradition. The journal is not committed to any particular school of philosophy and contributions variously employ [[Analytic philosophy|analytical]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]], [[Thomism|Thomistic]], historical, and other methods. Nevertheless, it typically prefers contributions on topics or thinkers that are of special interest to [[Catholic]] thought. Thus, almost every issue usually carries at least one article on [[Thomas Aquinas]]. Pieces on [[Middle Ages|medieval]] thought are well represented as well, as are essays in the [[philosophy of religion]] and [[philosophical theology]].

Every fourth issue of the journal is devoted to a philosopher, Catholic or not, who has exercised a significant influence on Western philosophy. Recent special issues have been devoted to [[Max Scheler]], [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]], [[Gabriel Marcel]], [[Peter Abelard]], and [[Edith Stein]].

The editorial offices are currently located at the [[University of St. Thomas (Minnesota)]]. The journal's editor is David L. Clemenson.&lt;ref name=clemenson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stthomas.edu/philosophy/faculty/clemenson.htm|title=University of St. Thomas : Philosophy Department : Clemenson, David L.|work=|accessdate=2010-02-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100927085849/http://www.stthomas.edu/philosophy/faculty/clemenson.htm|archive-date=2010-09-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]], an '''argument''' is an expression that helps complete the meaning of a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]],&lt;ref&gt;Most grammars define the '''argument''' in this manner, i.e. it is an expression that helps complete the meaning of a predicate (a verb). See for instance Tesnière (1969: 128).&lt;/ref&gt; the latter referring in this context to a main verb and its auxiliaries. In this regard, the ''[[Complement (linguistics)|complement]]'' is a closely related concept. Most predicates take one, two, or three arguments. A predicate and its arguments form a ''predicate-argument structure''. The discussion of predicates and arguments is associated most with (content) verbs and noun phrases (NPs), although other [[syntactic category|syntactic categories]] can also be construed as predicates and as arguments. Arguments must be distinguished from [[adjunct (grammar)|adjuncts]]. While a predicate needs its arguments to complete its meaning, the adjuncts that appear with a predicate are optional; they are not necessary to complete the meaning of the predicate.&lt;ref&gt;Concerning the completion of a predicates meaning via its arguments, see for instance Kroeger (2004:9ff.).&lt;/ref&gt; Most theories of syntax and semantics acknowledge arguments and adjuncts, although the terminology varies, and the distinction is generally believed to exist in all languages. [[Dependency grammar]]s sometimes call arguments ''actants'', following [[Lucien Tesnière|Tesnière]] (1959).

The area of grammar that explores the nature of predicates, their arguments, and adjuncts is called [[valency (linguistics)|valency theory]]. Predicates have a valence; they determine the number and type of arguments that can or must appear in their environment. The valence of predicates is also investigated in terms of [[Subcategorization (linguistics)|subcategorization]].

==Arguments and adjuncts==
The basic analysis of the syntax and semantics of clauses relies heavily on the distinction between arguments and [[adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]]s. The clause predicate, which is often a content verb, demands certain arguments. That is, the arguments are necessary in order to complete the meaning of the verb. The adjuncts that appear, in contrast, are not necessary in this sense. The subject phrase and object phrase are the two most frequently occurring arguments of verbal predicates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Linguistics|first1=Dirk|last1= Geeraerts|first2= Hubert|last2= Cuyckens|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year= 2007|ISBN=0-19-514378-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance:

::'''Jill''' likes '''Jack'''.
::'''Sam''' fried '''the meat'''.
::'''The old man''' helped '''the young man'''.

Each of these sentences contains two arguments (in bold), the first noun (phrase) being the subject argument, and the second the object argument. ''Jill'', for example, is the subject argument of the predicate ''likes'', and ''Jack'' is its object argument. Verbal predicates that demand just a subject argument (e.g. ''sleep'', ''work'', ''relax'') are [[intransitive verb|intransitive]], verbal predicates that demand an object argument as well (e.g. ''like'', ''fry'', ''help'') are [[transitive verb|transitive]], and verbal predicates that demand two object arguments are [[ditransitive verb|ditransitive]] (e.g. ''give'', ''lend'').

When additional information is added to our three example sentences, one is dealing with adjuncts, e.g.

::Jill '''really''' likes Jack.
::Jill likes Jack '''most of the time'''.
::Jill likes Jack '''when the sun shines'''.
::Jill likes Jack '''because he's friendly'''.

The added phrases (in bold) are adjuncts; they provide additional information that is not necessary to complete the meaning of the predicate ''likes''. One key difference between arguments and adjuncts is that the appearance of a given argument is often obligatory, whereas adjuncts appear optionally. While typical verb arguments are subject or object nouns or noun phrases as in the examples above, they can also be prepositional phrases (PPs) (or even other categories). The PPs in bold in the following sentences are arguments:

::Sam put the pen '''on the chair'''.
::Larry does not put up '''with that'''.
::Bill is getting '''on my case'''.

We know that these PPs are (or contain) arguments because when we attempt to omit them, the result is unacceptable:

:: *Sam put the pen.
:: *Larry does not put up.
:: *Bill is getting.

Subject and object arguments are known as ''core arguments''; core arguments can be suppressed, added, or exchanged in different ways, using [[grammatical voice|voice]] operations like [[passive voice|passivization]], [[antipassive voice|antipassivization]], [[verb applicative|application]], [[Incorporation (linguistics)|incorporation]], etc. Prepositional arguments, which are also called ''oblique arguments'', however, do not tend to undergo the same processes.

===Psycholinguistic (argument vs adjuncts)===
[[Psycholinguistics|Psycholinguistic]] theories must explain how syntactic representations are built incrementally during sentence comprehension. One view that has sprung from psycholinguistics is the argument structure hypothesis (ASH), which explains the distinct cognitive operations for argument and adjunct attachment: arguments are attached via the lexical mechanism, but adjuncts are attached using general (non-lexical) grammatical knowledge that is represented as phrase structure rules or the equivalent.

Argument status determines the cognitive mechanism in which a phrase will be attached to the developing syntactic representations of a sentence. Psycholinguistic evidence supports a formal distinction between arguments and adjuncts, for any questions about the argument status of a phrase are, in effect, questions about learned mental representations of the lexical heads.

==Syntactic vs. semantic arguments==
An important distinction acknowledges both syntactic and semantic arguments. Content verbs determine the number and type of syntactic arguments that can or must appear in their environment; they impose specific syntactic functions (e.g. subject, object, oblique, specific preposition, possessor, etc.) onto their arguments. These syntactic functions will vary as the form of the predicate varies (e.g. active verb, passive participle, gerund, nominal, etc.). In languages that have morphological case, the arguments of a predicate must appear with the correct case markings (e.g. nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, etc.) imposed on them by their predicate. The semantic arguments of the predicate, in contrast, remain consistent, e.g.

::Jack is liked by Jill.
::Jill's liking Jack
::Jack's being liked by Jill
::the liking of Jack by Jill
::Jill's like for Jack

The predicate 'like' appears in various forms in these examples, which means that the [[grammatical relation|syntactic functions]] of the arguments associated with ''Jack'' and ''Jill'' vary. The object of the active sentence, for instance, becomes the subject of the passive sentence. Despite this variation in syntactic functions, the arguments remain semantically consistent. In each case, ''Jill'' is the experiencer (= the one doing the liking) and ''Jack'' is the one being experienced (= the one being liked). In other words, the syntactic arguments are subject to syntactic variation in terms of syntactic functions, whereas the [[Thematic relation|thematic role]]s  of the arguments of the given predicate remain consistent as the form of that predicate changes.

The syntactic arguments of a given verb can also vary across languages. For example, the verb ''put'' in English requires three syntactic arguments: subject, object, locative (e. g. ''He put the book into the box''). These syntactic arguments correspond to the three semantic arguments agent, theme, and goal. The [[Japanese language|Japanese]] verb ''oku'' 'put', in contrast, has the same three semantic arguments, but the syntactic arguments differ, since Japanese does not require three syntactic arguments, so it is correct to say ''Kare ga hon o oita'' ("He put the book"). The equivalent sentence in English is ungrammatical without the required locative argument, as the examples involving ''put'' above demonstrate.  For this reason, a slight paraphrase is required to render the nearest grammatical equivalent in English: ''He positioned the book'' or ''He deposited the book''.

==Distinguishing between arguments and adjuncts==

===Arguments vs. adjuncts===
{{confusing|date=January 2013}}
A large body of literature has been devoted to distinguishing arguments from adjuncts.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, see the essays on valency theory in Ágel et al. (2003/6).&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous syntactic tests have been devised for this purpose. One such test is the relative clause diagnostic. If the test [[constituent (linguistics)|constituent]] can appear after the combination ''which occurred/happened'' in a relative clause, it is an adjunct, not an argument, e.g.

::Bill left '''on Tuesday'''. → Bill left, which happened '''on Tuesday'''. - &lt;small&gt;''on Tuesday'' is an adjunct.&lt;/small&gt;
::Susan stopped '''due to the weather'''. → Susan stopped, which occurred '''due to the weather'''. - &lt;small&gt;''due to the weather'' is an adjunct.&lt;/small&gt;
::Fred tried to say something '''twice'''. → Fred tried to say something, which occurred '''twice'''. - &lt;small&gt;''twice'' is an adjunct.&lt;/small&gt;

The same diagnostic results in unacceptable relative clauses (and sentences) when the test constituent is an argument, e.g.

::Bill left '''home'''. → *Bill left, which happened '''home'''. - &lt;small&gt;''home'' is an argument.&lt;/small&gt;
::Susan stopped '''her objections'''. → *Susan stopped, which occurred '''her objections'''. - &lt;small&gt;''her objections'' is an argument.&lt;/small&gt;
::Fred tried to say '''something'''. → *Fred tried to say, which happened '''something'''. - &lt;small&gt;''something'' is an argument.&lt;/small&gt;

This test succeeds at identifying prepositional arguments as well:

::We are waiting '''for Susan'''. → *We are waiting, which is happening '''for Susan'''. - &lt;small&gt;''for Susan'' is an argument.&lt;/small&gt;
::Tom put the knife '''in the drawer'''. → *Tom put the knife, which occurred '''in the drawer'''. - &lt;small&gt;''in the drawer'' is an argument.&lt;/small&gt;
::We laughed '''at you'''. → *We laughed, which occurred '''at you'''. - &lt;small&gt;''at you'' is an argument.&lt;/small&gt;

The utility of the relative clause test is, however, limited. It incorrectly suggests, for instance, that modal adverbs (e.g. ''probably'', ''certainly'', ''maybe'') and manner expressions (e.g. ''quickly'', ''carefully'', ''totally'') are arguments. If a constituent passes the relative clause test, however, one can be sure that it is ''not'' an argument.

===Obligatory vs. optional arguments===
A further division blurs the line between arguments and adjuncts. Many arguments behave like adjuncts with respect to another diagnostic, the omission diagnostic. Adjuncts can always be omitted from the phrase, clause, or sentence in which they appear without rendering the resulting expression unacceptable. Some arguments (obligatory ones), in contrast, cannot be omitted. There are many other arguments, however, that are identified as arguments by the relative clause diagnostic but that can nevertheless be omitted, e.g.

::a. She cleaned '''the kitchen'''.
::b. She cleaned. - &lt;small&gt;''the kitchen'' is an optional argument.&lt;/small&gt;

::a. We are waiting '''for Larry'''.
::b. We are waiting. - &lt;small&gt;''for Larry'' is an optional argument.&lt;/small&gt;

::a. Susan was working '''on the model'''.
::b. Susan was working. - &lt;small&gt;''on the model'' is an optional argument.&lt;/small&gt;

The relative clause diagnostic would identify the constituents in bold as arguments. The omission diagnostic here, however, demonstrates that they are not obligatory arguments. They are, rather, optional. The insight, then, is that a three-way division is needed. On the one hand, one distinguishes between arguments and adjuncts, and on the other hand, one allows for a further division between obligatory and optional arguments.

===Arguments and adjuncts in noun phrases===
Most work on the distinction between arguments and adjuncts has been conducted at the clause level and has focused on arguments and adjuncts to verbal predicates. The distinction is crucial for the analysis of noun phrases as well, however. If it is altered somewhat, the relative clause diagnostic can also be used to distinguish arguments from adjuncts in noun phrases, e.g.

::Bill's bold reading of the poem after lunch
::: *bold reading of the poem after lunch that was '''Bill's''' - &lt;small&gt;''Bill's'' is an argument.&lt;/small&gt;
::: Bill's reading of the poem after lunch that was '''bold''' - &lt;small&gt;''bold'' is an adjunct&lt;/small&gt;
::: *Bill's bold reading after lunch that was '''of the poem''' - &lt;small&gt;''of the poem'' is an argument&lt;/small&gt;
::: Bill's bold reading of the poem that was '''after lunch''' - &lt;small&gt;''after lunch'' is an adjunct&lt;/small&gt;

The diagnostic identifies ''Bill's'' and ''of the poem'' as arguments, and ''bold'' and ''after lunch'' as adjuncts.

==Representing arguments and adjuncts==
The distinction between arguments and adjuncts is often indicated in the tree structures used to represent syntactic structure. In [[phrase structure grammar]]s, an adjunct is "adjoined" to a projection of its head predicate in such a manner that distinguishes it from the arguments of that predicate. The distinction is quite visible in theories that employ the [[X-bar theory|X-bar schema]], e.g.

::[[File:Argument1.jpg|Argument picture 1]]

The complement argument appears as a sister of the head X, and the specifier argument appears as a daughter of XP. The optional adjuncts appear in one of a number of positions adjoined to a bar-projection of X or to XP.

Theories of syntax that acknowledge n-ary branching structures and hence construe syntactic structure as being flatter than the layered structures associated with the X-bar schema must employ some other means to distinguish between arguments and adjuncts. In this regard, some [[dependency grammar]]s employ an arrow convention. Arguments receive a "normal" dependency edge, whereas adjuncts receive an arrow edge.&lt;ref&gt;See Eroms (2000) and Osborne and Groß (2012) in this regard.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following tree, an arrow points away from an adjunct toward the governor of that adjunct:

::[[File:Argument2.jpg|Argument picture 2]]

The arrow edges in the tree identify four constituents (= complete subtrees) as adjuncts: ''At one time'', ''actually'', ''in congress'', and ''for fun''. The normal dependency edges (= non-arrows) identify the other constituents as arguments of their heads. Thus ''Sam'', ''a duck'', and ''to his representative in congress'' are identified as arguments of the verbal predicate ''wanted to send''.

==Relevant theories==
* '''[[Argumentation theory]]'''
Argumentation theory focuses on how logical reasoning leads to end results through an internal structure build of premises, a method of reasoning and a conclusion. There are many versions of argumentation that relate to this theory that include: conversational, mathematical, scientific, interpretive, legal, and political. 
* '''[[Functional theories of grammar|Grammar theory]]'''
Grammar theory, specifically functional theories of grammar, relate to the functions of language as the link to fully understanding linguistics by referencing grammar elements to their functions and purposes. 
* '''[[Syntax |Syntax theories]]'''
A variety of theories exist regarding the structure of syntax, including [[generative grammar]], [[categorial grammar]], and [[dependency grammar]].
* '''[[Semantics|Theories in semantics]]'''
Modern theories of semantics include formal semantics, lexical semantics, and computational semantics. Formal semantics focuses on [[Truth-conditional semantics|truth conditioning]]. Lexical Semantics delves into word meanings in relation to their context and computational semantics uses algorithms and architectures to investigate linguistic meanings. 
* '''[[Valency (linguistics)|Valence theory]]'''
The concept of valence is the number of argument that are linked to a predicate, in particular to a verb. In valence theory verbs' arguments include also the argument expressed by the subject of the verb.

==Importance==
The distinction between arguments and adjuncts is crucial to most theories of syntax and grammar. Arguments behave differently from adjuncts in numerous ways. Theories of binding, [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]], [[discontinuity (linguistics)|discontinuities]], [[ellipsis]], etc. must acknowledge and build on the distinction. When one examines these areas of syntax, what one finds is that arguments consistently behave differently from adjuncts and that without the distinction, our ability to investigate and understand these phenomena would be seriously hindered.
There is a distinction between arguments and adjuncts which isn't really noticed by many in everyday language. The difference is between obligatory phrases versus phrases which embellish a sentence. For instance, if someone says "Tim punched the stuffed animal", the phrase stuffed animal would be an argument because it is the main part of the sentence. If someone says, "Tim punched the stuffed animal with glee", the phrase with glee would be an adjunct because it just enhances the sentence and the sentence can stand alone without it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~damont/TutunjianBoland2008LangLingCompassPrePub.pdf|title=Do we need a distinction between arguments and adjuncts?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1983">In [[ancient Rome]], a '''balatro''' was a professional [[jester]] or buffoon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace|Hor]]. Sat. i. 2. 2. (cited by Allen)&lt;/ref&gt; Balatrones were paid for their jests, and the tables of the wealthy were generally open to them for the sake of the amusement they afforded.

In [[Horace]]&lt;ref&gt;Sat ii. 8. 21 (cited by Allen)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Balatro'' is used as a proper name — ''Servilius Balatro''. An old scholiast, in commenting on this word, derives the common word from the proper names; buffoons being called balatrones, because Servilius Balatro was a buffoon: but this is opposed to the natural inference from the former passage, and was said to get rid of a difficulty. [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] derives the word from ''blatea'', and supposes buffoons to have been called balatrones, because they were dirty fellows, and were covered with spots of mud (''blateae'') with which they got spattered in walking;&lt;ref&gt;Pauli Diaconi excerpta ex libris Pompeii Festi de significatione verborum, liber II, [https://archive.org/stream/mverriiflacciqua01verruoft#page/108/mode/2up sub voce]. See also [https://archive.org/stream/deverborumsigni00fest#page/34/mode/2up here].&lt;/ref&gt; but this is opposed to sound etymology and common sense. Another writer has derived it from ''barathrum'', and supposes buffoons to have been called balatrones, because they, so to speak, carried their jesting to market, even into the very depth (''barathrum'') of the shambles (barathrum macelli)&lt;ref&gt;Hor. Ep. i. 15. 31. (cited by Allen)&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps ''balatro'' may be connected with ''balare'' (to bleat like a sheep, and hence) to speak sillily. It is probably connected with ''blatero'', a busy-body.&lt;ref&gt;Gell. i. 15. (cited by Allen)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barbara Kingsolver''' (born April 8, 1955) is an American novelist, essayist and poet. She was raised in rural [[Kentucky]] and lived briefly in the Congo in her early childhood. Kingsolver earned degrees in biology at [[DePauw University]] and the [[University of Arizona]] and worked as a freelance writer before she began writing novels. Her widely known works include ''[[The Poisonwood Bible]]'', the tale of a missionary family in the Congo, and ''[[Animal, Vegetable, Miracle]]'', a non-fiction account of her family's attempts to eat locally.

Her work often focuses on topics such as social justice, biodiversity and the interaction between humans and their communities and environments. Each of her books published since 1993 has been on the [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]].&lt;ref name="Inside List"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/22/books/review/InsideList-t.html |title=Inside the List |work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher =[[The New York Times Company]]|date= November 13, 2009|accessdate=May 3, 2010 | first=Jennifer | last=Schuessler}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kingsolver has received numerous awards, including the [[Dayton Literary Peace Prize]]'s Richard C. Holbrooke Distinguished Achievement Award 2011, UK's [[Orange Prize for Fiction]] 2010, for ''[[The Lacuna]]'', and the [[National Humanities Medal]]. She has been nominated for the [[PEN/Faulkner Award]] and the [[Pulitzer Prize]].

In 2000, Kingsolver established the [[Bellwether Prize]] to support "literature of social change".

==Personal life==
Kingsolver was born in [[Annapolis, Maryland]], in 1955 and grew up in [[Carlisle, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name="Novel as Indictment"/&gt;&lt;ref name="At Lunch"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/01/garden/at-lunch-with-barbara-kingsolver-termites-are-interesting-but-books-sell-better.html?pagewanted=2|title=At Lunch With Barbara Kingsolver|last=Lyall|first=Sarah|format=interview|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=September 1, 1993|accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Kingsolver was seven years old, her father, a physician, took the family to [[Kinshasa|Léopoldville]], [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|Congo]] (now [[Kinshasa]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]). Her parents worked in a public health capacity, and the family lived without electricity or running water.&lt;ref name="Novel as Indictment"&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/11/magazine/the-novel-as-indictment.html?scp=4&amp;sq=Poisonwood%20Bible&amp;st=cse|title=The Novel as Indictment|last=Kerr|first=Sarah| work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=October 11, 1988|accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ellen|last=Kanner|title=Barbara Kingsolver turns to her past to understand the present|date=November 1998|url=http://www.bookpage.com/books-5367-The+Poisonwood+Bible|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120721120202/http://www.bookpage.com/books-5367-The+Poisonwood+Bible|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-07-21|accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from high school, Kingsolver attended [[DePauw University]] in [[Greencastle, Indiana]], on a music scholarship, studying [[classical piano]]. Eventually, however, she changed her major to biology when she realized that "classical pianists compete for six job openings a year, and the rest of [them] get to play &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Blue Moon (song)|Blue Moon]]&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; in a hotel lobby".&lt;ref name="At Lunch"/&gt; She was involved in activism on her campus, and took part in protests against the [[Vietnam war]].&lt;ref name="Novel as Indictment"/&gt; She graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Snodgrass|first1=Mary Ellen|title=Barbara Kingsolver: A Literary Companion|date=2004|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9781476611174|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dAsyBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=Barbara+Kingsolver+phi+beta+kappa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2wK5M-1dm0&amp;sig=fMpPpjeQ2QGnH_zNi0WCXIC0F2o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit3cuVueHUAhUE8j4KHdq3CVMQ6AEIQDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Barbara%20Kingsolver%20phi%20beta%20kappa&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a Bachelor of Science in 1977, and moved to France for a year before settling in Tucson, Arizona, where she lived for much of the next two decades. In 1980, she enrolled in graduate school at the University of Arizona,&lt;ref name="At Lunch"/&gt; where she earned a master's degree in [[ecology]] and [[evolutionary biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.st-charles.lib.il.us/readers_service/bios/kingsolver.htm |title=Barbara Kingsolver profile |work=St Charles Public Library |date=February 2010 |accessdate=May 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615125302/http://www.st-charles.lib.il.us/readers_service/bios/kingsolver.htm |archivedate=June 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Listen Here"&gt;{{cite book|title=Listen Here: Women Writing in Appalachia|last=Ballard|first=Sandra L.|year= 2003 |publisher= The University Press of Kentucky |location=Kentucky |isbn= 978-0-8131-9066-2|pages=330–31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i090MbNYlIYC&amp;pg=PA330|accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kingsolver began her full-time writing career in the mid-1980s as a science writer for the university, which eventually led to some freelance feature writing, including many cover stories for the local alternative weekly, the Tucson Weekly.&lt;ref name="At Lunch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Listen Here"/&gt; She began her career in fiction writing after winning a short story contest in a local Phoenix newspaper.&lt;ref name="At Lunch"/&gt; In 1985, she married Joseph Hoffmann; their daughter Camille was born in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-literary-criticism/kingsolver-barbara|title=Barbara Kingsolver|work= eNotes|accessdate=May 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="official site"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingsolver.com/biography|title=Barbara Kingsolver Brief Biography|format=Biography|work=Barbara Kingsolver's official website|accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She moved with her daughter to [[Tenerife]] in the [[Canary Islands]] for a year during the first [[Gulf war]], mostly due to frustration over America's military involvement.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/6606679/Barbara-Kingsolver-Interview.html|title=Barbara Kingsolver: Interview|last=Leonard|first=Tom|format=Interview|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|date=November 20, 2009|accessdate=May 12, 2010|location=London, UK|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618214901/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/6606679/Barbara-Kingsolver-Interview.html|archivedate=June 18, 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to the US in 1992, she separated from her husband.&lt;ref name="official site"/&gt;

In 1994, Kingsolver was awarded an Honorary [[Doctor of Letters|Doctorate of Letters]] from her [[alma mater]], DePauw University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.depauw.edu/news/?id=25211|title=Barbara Kingsolver '77 is Finalist for Britain's Orange Prize|work=DePauw University News|date=April 20, 2010|accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, she married Steven Hopp, an ornithologist, and their daughter, Lily, was born in 1996.&lt;ref name="Novel as Indictment"/&gt; In 2004, Kingsolver moved with her family to a farm in [[Washington County, Virginia]], where they currently reside.&lt;ref name="Novel as Indictment"/&gt; In 2008, she received an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from [[Duke University]], where she delivered a commencement address entitled "How to be Hopeful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dukenews.duke.edu/2008/05/kingsolver.html|title=How to be Hopeful|last=Kingsolver|first=Barbara|format=Speech|publisher=[[Duke University]]|date=May 11, 2008|accessdate=May 3, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511142111/http://www.dukenews.duke.edu/2008/05/kingsolver.html|archivedate=May 11, 2010|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s,&lt;ref name="rockbottomremainders.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockbottomremainders.com/pages/history.html|title=History of the Rock Bottom Remainders|format=website|accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; she was a founding member of the [[Rock Bottom Remainders]], a rock and roll band made up of published writers. Other band members include [[Amy Tan]], [[Matt Groening]], [[Dave Barry]] and [[Stephen King]], and they play for one week during the year. Kingsolver played the keyboard, but is no longer an active member of the band.&lt;ref name="rockbottomremainders.com"/&gt;

In a 2010 interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', Kingsolver says, "I never wanted to be famous, and still don't, [...] the universe rewarded me with what I dreaded most". She said she created her own website just to compete with a plethora of fake ones, "as a defence to protect my family from misinformation. Wikipedia abhors a vacuum. If you don't define yourself, it will get done for you in colourful ways".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Guardian|location=UK|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/12/life-in-writing-barbara-kingsolver|title=Guardian interview: A life in writing: Barbara Kingsolver|date=June 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local-eating experiment===
Starting in April 2005, she and her family spent a year making every effort to eat food produced as locally as possible.&lt;ref name="Good for You"/&gt; Living on their farm in rural Virginia, they grew much of their own food, and obtained most of the rest from their neighbors and other local farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=9891473|title=Back to Basics: Kingsolver Clan Lives off Land: NPR|last=Neary|first=Lynn|work=National Public Radio|date=April 29, 2007|accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kingsolver, her husband and her elder daughter chronicled their experiences that year in the book ''[[Animal, Vegetable, Miracle]]''. Although exceptions were made for staple ingredients which were not available locally, such as coffee and olive oil, the family grew vegetables, raised livestock, made cheese and preserved much of their harvest.&lt;ref name="Good for You"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Animal, Vegetable, Miracle|last=Kingsolver|first=Barbara|author2=Hopp, Steven|author3=Kingsolver, Camille|year=2006|publisher=HarperCollins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing career==
Kingsolver's first novel, ''[[The Bean Trees]]'', was published in 1988, and told the story of a young woman who leaves Kentucky for Arizona, adopting an abandoned child along the way; she wrote it at night while pregnant with her first child and struggling with insomnia.&lt;ref name="Listen Here"/&gt; Her next work of fiction, published in 1990, was ''Homeland and Other Stories'', a collection of short stories on a variety of topics exploring various themes from the evolution of cultural and ancestral lands to the struggles of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/10/18/specials/kingsolver-homeland.html?scp=19&amp;sq=barbara%20kingsolver&amp;st=cse|title=Distant as a Cherokee Childhood|last=Banks|first=Russell|work=New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=1989-06-11|accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel ''[[Animal Dreams]]'' was also published in 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/10/18/specials/kingsolver-animal.html?scp=23&amp;sq=barbara%20kingsolver&amp;st=cse|title=In One Small Town, the Weight of the World|last=Smiley|first=Jane|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date= 1990-09-02|accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by ''[[Pigs in Heaven]]'', the sequel to ''The Bean Trees'', in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/27/books/and-baby-makes-two.html?scp=45&amp;sq=barbara%20kingsolver&amp;st=cse|title=And Baby Makes Two|last=Karbo|first=Karen|format=Book review|work= The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=1993-06-27|accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Poisonwood Bible]]'', published in 1998, is one of her best known works; it chronicles the lives of the wife and daughters of a Baptist missionary on a Christian mission in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/10/18/reviews/981018.18klinket.html |title=Going Native |last= Klinkenborg |first= Verlyn|work= The New York Times |publisher =The New York Times Company |date=October 16, 1998|accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the setting of the novel is somewhat similar to Kingsolver's own childhood trip to the then [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|Republic of Congo]], the novel is not autobiographical.&lt;ref name="Novel as Indictment"/&gt;  Her next novel, published in 2000, was ''[[Prodigal Summer]]'', set in southern Appalachia.&lt;ref name="Men, Women and Coyotes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/11/05/reviews/001105.05schuest.html?scp=1&amp;sq=barbara%20kingsolver%20AND%20prodigal%20summer&amp;st=cse|title=Men, Women and Coyotes|last=Schuessler|first=Jennifer|format= Book review|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=November 5, 2000|accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Lacuna]]'' was published in 2009; her most recent novel, entitled ''[[Flight Behavior]]'', was published in 2012. It explores environmental themes and highlights the potential effects of global warming on the [[monarch butterfly]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Kingsolver is also a published poet and essayist. Two of her essay collections, ''[[High Tide in Tucson]]'' (1995) and ''[[Small Wonder (essays)|Small Wonder]]'' (2003), have been published, and an anthology of her poetry was published in 1998 under the title ''Another America''. Her essay "Where to Begin" appears in the anthology ''Knitting Yarns: Writers on Knitting ''(2013), published by [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]. Her prose poetry also accompanied photographs by [[Annie Griffiths Belt]] in a 2002 work titled ''Last Stand: America's Virgin Lands''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/10/1025_021029_LastStand.html |title=New Photo Book an Homage to Last U.S. Wildlands |last= Parsell|first= T.L.|work= National Geographic News|date=October 29, 2002 |accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her major non-fiction works include her 1990 publication ''Holding the Line: Women in the [[Arizona Copper Mine Strike of 1983|Great Arizona Mine Strike]] of 1983''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/10/18/specials/kingsolver-holding.html?scp=61&amp;sq=barbara%20kingsolver&amp;st=cse|title=Both Sides Lost|last=Stegner|first=Page|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company |date=January 7, 1990|accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2007's ''[[Animal, Vegetable, Miracle]]'', a description of [[local food|eating locally]].&lt;ref name="Good for You"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/books/11book.html?scp=17&amp;sq=barbara%20kingsolver&amp;st=cse|title=Animal, Vegetable, Miracle: A Year of Food Life|last=Maslin|first=Janet|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=May 11, 2007|accessdate=May 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also been published as a science journalist in periodicals such as ''[[Economic Botany]]'' on topics such as desert plants and bioresources.&lt;ref name="At Lunch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bibliography"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingsolver.com/bibliography|title=Bibliography|format=Bibliography|work=Official Website|accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary style and themes==
Kingsolver has written novels in both the [[first-person narrative|first person]] and [[third-person narrative|third person]] narrative styles, and she frequently employs overlapping narratives.&lt;ref name="Men, Women and Coyotes"/&gt;

Kingsolver's literary subjects are varied, but she often writes about places and situations with which she is familiar; many of her stories are based in places she has lived in, such as central Africa and Arizona. She has stated emphatically that her novels are not autobiographical, although there are often commonalities between her life and her work.&lt;ref name="Novel as Indictment"/&gt; Her work is often strongly idealistic&lt;ref name="At Lunch"/&gt; and her writing has been called a form of activism.&lt;ref name="Women on war"&gt;{{cite book |title= Women on War: an International Anthology of Women's Writings from Antiquity to the Present|last=Gioseffi|first=Daniela|year= 2003|publisher=Feminist Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=1-55861-408-7|pages=86–88|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZH2FtB14fcEC&amp;pg=PA86|accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her characters are frequently written around struggles for social equality, such as the hardships faced by undocumented immigrants, the working poor, and single mothers.&lt;ref name="At Lunch"/&gt; Other common themes in her work include the balancing of individuality with the desire to live in a community, and the interaction and conflict between humans and the ecosystems in which they live.&lt;ref name="Listen Here"/&gt;  Kingsolver has been said to use prose and engaging narratives to make historical events, such as the Congo's struggles for independence, more interesting and engaging for the average reader.&lt;ref name="Novel as Indictment"/&gt;

In 2011, she was awarded the [[Dayton Literary Peace Prize]] Richard C. Holbrooke Distinguished Achievement Award.

==Criticism==
Calling Kingsolver a master of "Calamity Writing" in ''[[The New Republic]]'', [[Lee Siegel (cultural critic) |Lee Siegel]] wrote that she offers "the mere appearance of goodness as a substitute for honest art". He also characterized her as an "easy, humorous, competent, syrupy writer [who] has been elevated to the ranks of the greatest political novelists of our time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Lee |last=Siegel |title= Sweet and Low|date= March 21, 1999 |website=New Republic|url= https://newrepublic.com/article/books-and-arts/sweet-and-low |accessdate=June 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | URL = http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2012/11/barbara_kingsolver_s_flight_behavior_reviewed.single.html | title = Michelle Dean in Slate extends Siegel's assessment | work = Slate | date = November 2012 | accessdate = March 16, 2017}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]],'' Merve Emre wrote that Kingsolver “is often described as a ‘political novelist’” but that she “has only the shallowest understanding of political reality. Her novels specialize in self-congratulatory gestures of empathy: the clumsy representation of characters whom she finds obviously distasteful but wants to redeem, modeling the respect and understanding that she believes can open our hearts and minds and subdue our partisan acrimony.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/11/barbara-kingsolvers-liberal-pabulum/570817/&lt;/ref&gt;

Kingsolver was criticized for a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' opinion piece following the U.S. bombing of Afghanistan in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]].  She wrote, "I feel like I'm standing on a playground where the little boys are all screaming at each other, 'He started it!' and throwing rocks that keep taking out another eye, another tooth.  I keep looking around for somebody's mother to come on the scene saying, 'Boys! Boys! Who started it cannot possibly be the issue here. People are getting hurt."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first= Kingsolver |last=Barbara|title= No Glory in Unjust War on the Weak |date= October 14, 2001|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2001/oct/14/opinion/op-57057|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=June 10, 2016 | page = 2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One reader cited her essay as an example of the "shabby nihilism of the left." Another wrote, "Kingsolver seemingly believes an insufficient number of us died in New York to warrant our response in Afghanistan." Another reader, however, praised her "loving sentiments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web. |title=Defending the U.S. Against Barbarism |date= October 20, 2001 |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2001/oct/20/local/me-59443 |website=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=June 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By some accounts, she was "denounced as a traitor," but rebounded from these accusations and wrote about them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= How Barbara Kingsolver recovered from a 9/11 backlash |date=November 8, 2009 |website= Herald Scotland |url= http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/book-features/how-barbara-kingsolver-recovered-from-a-9-11-backlash-1.931075 |accessdate=June 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Belles on Their Toes''''' is a 1950 autobiographical book written by the siblings [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Jr.]] and [[Ernestine Gilbreth Carey]]. It is the follow-up to their book ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen]]'' (1948), which covered the period before [[Frank Gilbreth|Frank Gilbreth, Sr.]] died. It was adapted as a [[Belles on Their Toes (film)|film in 1952]].

==Title==
The title alludes both to a line in the [[nursery rhyme]] "[[Ride a cock horse to Banbury Cross]]" (i.e., "Rings on her fingers and bells on her toes") and to the marriages of the Gilbreth sisters:  "It was apparent that in order to get rings on their fingers, belles would have to be on their toes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gilbreth, Frank Bunker, Jr. |author2=Carey, Ernestine Gilbreth |last-author-amp=yes |title=Belles on Their Toes |date=1948 |page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
''Belles on Their Toes'' was written about the Gilbreth family after [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth]], Sr.'s death, and how they survived as their mother, [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth]], continued the pioneering work in [[industrial engineering]], [[time and motion studies]], and industrial/organizational psychology she had shared with her husband. This book is also the first place where the absence of the second oldest child, Mary Gilbreth, is explained; she died of [[diphtheria]] in 1912, at age five.

==Film adaptation==
''[[Belles on Their Toes (film)|Belles on Their Toes]]'' was made into a 1952 motion picture starring [[Myrna Loy]] as Lillian Gilbreth.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/363419 in JSTOR]; Argues Hayes had been convinced since 1875 that Grant's approach toward the South had to be abandoned and hoped to substitute conciliation for coercion, believing that the good will of Southern upper class whites would provide better protection for Blacks than the hated Federal troops. A majority of abolitionists disagreed, but about 36% of abolitionists supported Hayes, thereby causing a decided division in their ranks.
* Polakoff, Keith Ian. ''The Politics of Inertia: The Election of 1876 and the End of Reconstruction.'' Louisiana State University Press, 1973. Argues the Compromise reflected decentralized parties and weak national leaders
* Simpson, Brooks D. "Ulysses S. Grant and the Electoral Crisis of 1876–1877." ''Hayes Historical Journal'' 1992 11(2): 5–22. {{ISSN|0364-5924}}. The compromise kept the White House in GOP control. It ended the promise of Reconstruction, as many scholars have argued, and more importantly it maintained the still fragile Union. Historians mostly ignored Grant's decisive role in engineering the compromise. He was not a lame duck but took a deep interest in the behind-the-scenes negotiations. His apparent inaction stemmed from the very real threat of violence that could once again divide the nation, and ultimately his quiet diplomacy was key to the final peaceful outcome.

'''Brother Tode''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

The character is a [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] with green skin and an oversized head.  He was once the monarch of the Deviants, ruler of the Deviant Empire of [[Lemuria (comics)|Lemuria]], husband of Queen Vira and father of Ranar.

==Fictional character biography==
Tode, as ruler of the Deviants, dispatched [[Kro (comics)|Kro]] to find the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]]' cosmic beacon and destroy it.&lt;ref&gt;''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #1&lt;/ref&gt; He punished Kro when Kro failed to destroy the beacon, and then authorized Kro to attack New York City.&lt;ref&gt;''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #3&lt;/ref&gt; Tode was next seen observing a gladiatorial game between [[Ransak the Reject]] and [[Karkas (comics)|Karkas]] the Mutate. There, Tode encountered [[Thena]] the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternal]].&lt;ref&gt;''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #8-9&lt;/ref&gt; Tode was in the City of Toads when the Celestial [[Eson the Searcher|Eson]] caused the city to flood, although Tode's life was spared.&lt;ref&gt;''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #10&lt;/ref&gt;

Tode then led a successful invasion of the Eternals' city [[Olympia (comics)|Olympia]], in which Eternals were captured and imprisoned via brain mines.  Tode supervised the distillation of the Eternals' immortality, and consumed the energy of the discorporated Eternals in an attempt to gain immortality.  His plan was thwarted by [[War Machine|Iron Man II]] and the Eternals.&lt;ref&gt;''Iron Man Annual'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

It was later revealed that Tode, along with the other Deviants in the City of Toads when the Eternals defeated them, was transformed by the Eternals by molecular rearrangement into a large organic cube which was then lowered into Olympia's foundation.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #247&lt;/ref&gt; The block of transmuted Deviants was then towed by the Eternal [[Uni-Mind]] into space.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #248&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Tode has no superhuman powers. In fact, due to the size of his head, his mobility is limited and he must rely on his bearers.  He does possess great leadership capacity, however.

[[File:מערת הסנהדרין הקטנה.jpeg|thumb|Cave entrance]]
The '''Cave of the Minor Sanhedrin''' is a burial cave located next to the [[Tomb of Simeon the Just]] in the [[Sheikh Jarrah]] neighborhood of [[Jerusalem]]. It contains 26 burial niches, in which the 26{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} members of the Minor [[Sanhedrin]] are said to be buried. There are also other burial caves in the complex.

The cave was plundered in the 19th century by [[Louis Félicien de Saulcy]] and another French archaeologist. They plundered the contents of the caves, scattering the bones of the buried people around the cave, before fleeing to the [[Jaffa]] port. This infuriated the local Jewish community, who turned to public figures like [[Moses Montefiore]] who acted to get the Turkish government to cancel their license to excavate.

The bones were collected by local Jews, and buried in a grave next to the nearby [[Tomb of Simeon the Just]]. Artifacts from within the cave, including burial vaults and stones with Hebrew writing on them, are now displayed in the [[Louvre museum]].

After the plundering, a Jewish woman purchased the site in order to preserve it due to its holiness.

Today, the cave entrance is locked and can only be visited in cooperation with the site management. In addition, a [[Kabbalistic]] prayer is held there weekly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2356">'''Cyberarts''' or '''cyberart''' refers to the class of art produced with the help of [[computer software]] and [[computer hardware|hardware]], often with an interactive or [[multimedia]] aspect. 

==Overview==
The term "cyberarts" is vague and relatively [[neologism|new]]; nevertheless much of the work described by this term is rarely described any other way. For instance, a common type of cyberart which is produced programmatically by applying a set of design rules to a natural or preexisting process. A program could produce a few million such 'works of art' in a minute.

The word "CyberArts" is claimed as a registered trademark by [[Miller Freeman Inc.]], promoter of a series of muti-media technology conferences known as [[CyberArts International]] during the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Jacobson (ed.), ''CyberArts: Exploring Art and Technology.'' San Francisco, CA: Miller Freeman Inc., 1992; pg. ii.&lt;/ref&gt;

″Recent works of bioart propose to connect the viewer, transformed into a user, with different biological organisms by pirating their biometric data using digital interfaces. These immersive aesthetic propositions are based on a plural conception of the human body, forged in the crucible of cybernetics. Their new modes of communication explore the alternative path of an ecological continuum where the user enters a becoming-cyborg, far from the classic representations of human-machine coupling. They encourage us to reconsider the notion of bioart, in favor of ''cyberart''.″&lt;ref&gt; Teva Flaman &amp; Pierre-Luc Verville. ″Cyberart : du mode d’existence d’un devenir-cyborg.″ Inter, numéro 128, hiver 2018, p. 42–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''dialect''' (from Latin {{wikt-lang|la|dialectus}}, {{wikt-lang|la|dialectos}}, from the [[Ancient Greek]] word {{wikt-lang|grc|διάλεκτος}}, {{grc-tr|διάλεκτος}}, "discourse", from {{wikt-lang|grc|διά}}, {{grc-tr|διά}}, "through" and {{wikt-lang|grc|λέγω}}, {{grc-tr|λέγω}}, "I speak") is used in two distinct ways to refer to two different types of [[linguistic]] phenomena:

* One usage refers to a [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of a [[language]] that is a characteristic of a particular group of the language's speakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50063104?query_type=word&amp;queryword=dialect&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=tFGd-Bh8USU-18775&amp;hilite=50063104 Oxford English dictionary.] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this definition, the dialects or varieties of a particular language are closely related and, despite their differences, are most often largely [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]], especially if close to one another on the [[dialect continuum]]. The term is applied most often to regional speech patterns, but a dialect may also be defined by other factors, such as [[social class]] or [[ethnicity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/dialect Merriam-Webster Online dictionary.]&lt;/ref&gt; A dialect that is associated with a particular [[social class]] can be termed a [[sociolect]], a dialect that is associated with a particular [[ethnic group]] can be termed as [[ethnolect]], and a regional dialect may be termed a regiolect.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, Walt and Schilling, Natalie. 2016.

West Sussex: John Wiley &amp; Sons, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this definition, any variety of a given language constitutes "a dialect", including any [[standard language|standard varieties]]. In this case, the distinction between the "standard language" (i.e. the "standard" dialect of a particular language) and the "nonstandard" dialects of the same language is often [[arbitrary]] and based on social, political, cultural, or historical considerations.&lt;ref name="chao"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chao|first1=Yuen Ren|title=Language and Symbolic Systems|date=1968|publisher=CUP archive|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Se87AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=language+standard+dialect&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyutrzrYDOAhWGPj4KHaAZD_IQ6AEIOzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=language%20standard%20dialect&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lyons"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=John|title=Language and Linguistics|date=1981|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Wg57a3DdYYC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=language+standard+dialect&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyutrzrYDOAhWGPj4KHaAZD_IQ6AEIQTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=language%20standard%20dialect&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=David|title=How Myths about Language Affect Education: What Every Teacher Should Know|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nPsVxfVDXp0C&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=language+standard+dialect&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyutrzrYDOAhWGPj4KHaAZD_IQ6AEIRzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=language%20standard%20dialect&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar way, the definitions of the terms "language" and "dialect" may overlap and are often subject to debate, with the differentiation between the two classifications often grounded in arbitrary and/or sociopolitical motives.&lt;ref name="mcworther"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McWorther|first1=John|title=What's a Language, Anyway?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/01/difference-between-language-dialect/424704/|accessdate=19 July 2016|agency=The Atlantic|date=Jan 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The other usage of the term "dialect", often deployed in [[Colloquialism|colloquial]] settings, refers (often somewhat pejoratively) to a language that is [[Social stratification|socially subordinated]] to a regional or national [[standard language]], often historically [[cognate]] or [[Genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetically related]] to the standard language, but not actually derived ''from'' the standard language. In other words, it is not an actual [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of the "standard language" or dominant language, but rather a separate, independently evolved but often distantly related language.&lt;ref name=maiden&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maiden|first1=Martin|last2=Parry|first2=Mair|title=The Dialects of Italy|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Dz_LyQF_eAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=dialects+of+italy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAWoVChMI47KwhKr1yAIVjD8-Ch3bQQsQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, unlike in the first usage, the standard language would not itself be considered a "dialect", as it is the dominant language in a particular state or region, whether in terms of [[Prestige (linguistics)|linguistic prestige]], social or political status, [[official language|official status]], predominance or prevalence, or all of the above. Meanwhile, under this usage, the "dialects" subordinate to the standard language are generally not variations on the standard language but rather separate (but often loosely related) languages in and of themselves. Thus, these "dialects" are not dialects or varieties of a particular language in the same sense as in the first usage; though they may share roots in the same [[Language family|family]] or subfamily as the standard language and may even, to varying degrees, share some [[mutual intelligibility]] with the standard language, they often did not evolve closely with the standard language or within the same linguistic subgroup or [[speech community]] as the standard language and instead may better fit the criteria of a separate language.

For example, most of the various regional [[Romance language|Romance]] [[languages of Italy]], often colloquially referred to as Italian "dialects", are, in fact, not ''actually'' derived from modern [[standard Italian]], but rather evolved from [[Vulgar Latin]] separately and individually from one another and independently of standard Italian, long prior to the diffusion of a national standardized language throughout what is now [[Italy]]. These various Latin-derived regional languages are, therefore, in a linguistic sense, not truly "dialects" or varieties of the [[standard Italian|standard Italian language]], but are instead better defined as their own separate languages. Conversely, with the spread of standard Italian throughout Italy in the 20th century, regional versions or varieties of standard Italian have developed, generally as a mix of national standard Italian with a [[substratum]] of local regional languages and local accents. While [[dialect levelling|"dialect" levelling]] has increased the number of standard Italian speakers and decreased the number of speakers of other languages native to Italy, Italians in different regions have developed variations of standard Italian particular to their region. These variations on standard Italian, known as [[regional Italian]], would thus more appropriately be called "dialects" in accordance with the first linguistic definition of "dialect", as they are in fact derived partially or mostly from standard Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Loporcaro | first= Michele | year= 2009 | title= Profilo linguistico dei dialetti italiani | location= Bari | publisher= Laterza | ref= harv | language=Italian }}; {{cite book | last= Marcato | first= Carla | year= 2007 | title= Dialetto, dialetti e italiano | location= Bologna | publisher= Il Mulino | ref= harv | language=Italian}}; {{cite book| last= Posner | first= Rebecca | year= 1996 | title= The Romance languages | location= Cambridge | publisher= Cambridge University Press | ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=maiden/&gt;&lt;ref name=repetti&gt;{{cite book|last1=Repetti|first1=Lori|title=Phonological Theory and the Dialects of Italy|date=2000|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z1f5fIrtw58C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=dialects+of+italy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAGoVChMI47KwhKr1yAIVjD8-Ch3bQQsQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dialects%20of%20italy&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A dialect is distinguished by its vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation ([[phonology]], including [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]]). Where a distinction can be made only in terms of pronunciation (including prosody, or just prosody itself), the term ''[[Accent (dialect)|accent]]'' may be preferred over ''dialect''. Other types of speech varieties include [[jargon]]s, which are characterized by differences in [[lexicon]] ([[vocabulary]]); [[slang]]; [[patois]]; [[pidgin]]s; and [[argot]]s. The particular speech patterns used by an individual are termed an [[idiolect]].

==Standard and non-standard dialect==
A ''standard dialect'' (also known as a '''standardized dialect''' or "[[standard language]]") is a dialect that is supported by institutions. Such institutional support may include government recognition or designation; presentation as being the "correct" form of a language in schools; published grammars, dictionaries, and textbooks that set forth a correct spoken and written form; and an extensive formal literature that employs that dialect (prose, poetry, non-fiction, etc.). There may be multiple standard dialects associated with a single language. For example, Standard [[American English]], Standard [[British English]], Standard [[Canadian English]], Standard [[Indian English]], Standard [[Australian English]], and Standard [[Philippine English]] may all be said to be standard dialects of the [[English language]].

A [[nonstandard dialect]], like a standard dialect, has a complete vocabulary, grammar, and [[Syntax|syntax]], but is usually not the beneficiary of institutional support. Examples of a nonstandard English dialect are [[Southern American English]], [[Western Australian English]], [[New York English]], [[New England English]], [[Mid-Atlantic American English| Mid-Atlantic American]] or [[Philadelphia English|Philadelphia]] / [[Baltimorese|Baltimore]] English, [[Scouse]], [[Brummie]], [[Cockney accent|Cockney]], and [[Yorkshire dialect|Tyke]]. The [[Dialect Test]] was designed by [[Joseph Wright (linguist)|Joseph Wright]] to compare different English dialects with each other.

== Dialect or language ==
{{see also|Abstand and ausbau languages|A language is a dialect with an army and navy}}
There is no universally accepted criterion for distinguishing two different languages from two dialects (i.e. varieties) of the same language.&lt;ref&gt;Cysouw, Michael; Good, Jeff. (2013). "Languoid, Doculect, and Glossonym: Formalizing the Notion 'Language'." ''Language Documentation and Conservation''. 7. 331–359. {{hdl|10125/4606}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of rough measures exist, sometimes leading to contradictory results. The distinction is therefore subjective and depends upon the user's frame of reference. For example, there has been discussion about whether or not the [[Limón Creole English]] should be considered "a kind" of English or a different language. This creole is spoken in the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica (Central America) by descendants of Jamaican people. The position that Costa Rican linguists support depends upon which University they represent.

The most common, and most purely linguistic, criterion is that of [[mutual intelligibility]]: two varieties are said to be dialects of the same language if being a speaker of one variety confers sufficient knowledge to understand and be understood by a speaker of the other; otherwise, they are said to be different languages. However, this definition becomes problematic in the case of [[dialect continuum|dialect continua]], in which it may be the case that dialect B is mutually intelligible with both dialect A and dialect C but dialects A and C are not mutually intelligible with each other. In this case, the criterion of mutual intelligibility makes it impossible to decide whether A and C are dialects of the same language or not. The mutual intelligibility criterion also flounders in cases in which a speaker of dialect X can understand a speaker of dialect Y, but not vice versa.

=== Sociolinguistic definitions ===
[[File:West Germanic dialect diagram.svg|thumb|right|upright=2|Local varieties in the West Germanic dialect continuum are oriented towards either Standard Dutch or Standard German depending on which side of the border they are spoken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | ref = harv
}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Another occasionally used criterion for discriminating dialects from languages is the [[sociolinguistic]] notion of [[autonomy and heteronomy (sociolinguistics)|linguistic authority]]. According to this definition, two varieties are considered dialects of the same language if (under at least some circumstances) they would defer to the same authority regarding some questions about their language. For instance, to learn the name of a new invention, or an obscure foreign species of plant, speakers of [[Westphalian language|Westphalian]] and [[East Franconian German]] might each consult a German dictionary or ask a German-speaking expert in the subject.
Thus these varieties are said to be dependent on, or [[autonomy and heteronomy (sociolinguistics)|heteronomous]] with respect to, [[Standard German]], which is said to be autonomous.
In contrast, speakers in the Netherlands of [[Dutch Low Saxon|Low Saxon]] varieties similar to Westphalian would instead consult a dictionary of [[Standard Dutch]].
Similarly, although Yiddish is classified by linguists as a language in the [[Middle High German]] group of languages, a Yiddish speaker would consult a different dictionary in such a case.

Within this framework, [[William Alexander Stewart|W. A. Stewart]] defined a ''language'' as an autonomous variety together with all the varieties that are heteronomous with respect to it, noting that an essentially equivalent definition had been stated by [[Charles A. Ferguson]] and [[John J. Gumperz]] in 1960.&lt;ref name="Stewart"&gt;{{cite book

Similarly, a heteronomous variety may be considered a ''dialect'' of a language defined in this way.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;
In these terms, [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], though mutually intelligible to a large degree, are considered separate languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the framework of [[Heinz Kloss]], these are described as languages by ''[[abstand and ausbau languages|ausbau]]'' (development) rather than by ''abstand'' (separation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dialect and language clusters ===

In other situations, a closely related group of varieties possess considerable (though incomplete) mutual intelligibility, but none dominates the others.
To describe this situation, the editors of the ''Handbook of African Languages'' introduced the term ''dialect cluster''.
Dialect clusters were treated as classificatory units at the same level as languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}} p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political factors ===

In many societies, however, a particular dialect, often the sociolect of the [[elite]] class, comes to be identified as the "standard" or "proper" version of a language by those seeking to make a social distinction and is contrasted with other varieties. As a result of this, in some contexts, the term "dialect" refers specifically to varieties with low [[social status]]. In this secondary sense of "dialect", language varieties are often called ''dialects'' rather than ''languages'':
* if they have no standard or [[Codification (linguistics)|codified]] form,
* if they are rarely or never used in writing (outside reported speech),
* if the speakers of the given language do not have a [[State (polity)|state]] of their own,
* if they lack [[prestige dialect|prestige]] with respect to some other, often standardised, variety.

The status of "language" is not solely determined by linguistic criteria, but it is also the result of a historical and political development. [[Romansh language|Romansh]] came to be a written language, and therefore it is recognized as a language, even though it is very close to the Lombardic alpine dialects. An opposite example is the case of [[Chinese language|Chinese]], whose variations such as [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]] are often called dialects and not languages in China, despite their mutual unintelligibility.

Modern [[nationalism]], as developed especially since the [[French Revolution]], has made the distinction between "language" and "dialect" an issue of great political importance. A group speaking a separate "language" is often seen as having a greater claim to being a separate "people", and thus to be more deserving of its own independent state, while a group speaking a "dialect" tends to be seen not as "a people" in its own right, but as a sub-group, part of a bigger people, which must content itself with regional autonomy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The distinction between language and dialect is thus inevitably made at least as much on a political basis as on a linguistic one, and can lead to great political controversy or even armed conflict.

The [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] linguist [[Max Weinreich]] published the expression, ''A shprakh iz a dialekt mit an armey un flot'' ({{rtl-lang|yi|"אַ שפּראַך איז אַ דיאַלעקט מיט אַן אַרמײ און פֿלאָט"}}: "[[A language is a dialect with an army and navy]]") in ''YIVO Bleter'' 25.1, 1945, p.&amp;nbsp;13. The significance of the political factors in any attempt at answering the question "what is a language?" is great enough to cast doubt on whether any strictly linguistic definition, without a socio-cultural approach, is possible. This is illustrated by the frequency with which the army-navy aphorism is cited.

==={{anchor|languoid}}Terminology ===

By the definition most commonly used by linguists, any linguistic variety can be considered a "dialect" of ''some'' language—"everybody speaks a dialect". According to that interpretation, the criteria above merely serve to distinguish whether two varieties are dialects of the ''same'' language or dialects of ''different'' languages.

The terms "language" and "dialect" are not necessarily mutually exclusive, although it is often perceived to be.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Thus there is nothing contradictory in the statement "the ''language'' of the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] is a dialect of [[German (language)|German]]".

There are various terms that linguists may use to avoid taking a position on whether the speech of a community is an independent language in its own right or a dialect of another language. Perhaps the most common is "[[variety (linguistics)|variety]]";&lt;ref name=finegan&gt;{{cite book |title=Language: Its Structure and Use|edition=5th |last=Finegan |first=Edward |year=2007 |publisher= Thomson Wadsworth|location=Boston, MA, USA|isbn=978-1-4130-3055-6 |page=348}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "[[lect]]" is another.  A more general term is "languoid", which does not distinguish between dialects, languages, and groups of languages, whether genealogically related or not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glottopedia.org/index.php/Languoid "Languoid"] at ''Glottopedia.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

{{see also|Mesoamerican languages#Language vs. dialect|l1=Mesoamerican languages § Language vs. dialect}}

=== German ===
When talking about the German language, the term [[German dialects]] is only used for the traditional regional varieties. That allows them to be distinguished from the regional varieties of modern standard German.

The German dialects show a wide spectrum of variation. Some of them are not mutually intelligible. [[German dialectology]] traditionally names the major dialect groups after [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] from which they were assumed to have descended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cutewriters.com/german-language-dialect-variations/|title=From dialect to variation space|last=Danvas|first=Kegesa|date=2016|website=Cutewriters|publisher=Cutewriters Inc.|access-date=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent to which the dialects are spoken varies according to a number of factors: In Northern Germany, dialects are less common than in the South. In cities, dialects are less common than in the countryside. In a public environment, dialects are less common than in a familiar environment.

The situation in [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]] is different from the rest of the German-speaking countries. The [[Swiss German]] dialects are the default everyday language in virtually every situation, whereas standard German is only spoken in education, partially in media, and with foreigners not possessing knowledge of Swiss German. Most Swiss German speakers perceive standard German to be a foreign language.

The [[Low German]] varieties spoken in Germany are often counted among the German dialects. This reflects the modern situation where they are [[Dachsprache|roofed]] by standard German. This is different from the situation in the [[Middle Ages]] when Low German had strong tendencies towards an [[ausbau language]].

The [[Frisian languages]] spoken in Germany are excluded from the German dialects.

===Italian===
{{See also|Languages of Italy|Regional Italian}}
Italy is home to a vast array of [[Languages of Italy|native regional minority languages]], most of which are [[Romance language|Romance]]-based and have their own local variants. These [[regional language]]s are often referred to colloquially or in non-linguistic circles as Italian "dialects", or ''dialetti'' (standard Italian for "dialects"). However, the majority of the regional languages in Italy are in fact not actually "dialects" of [[standard Italian]] in the strict linguistic sense, as they are not derived from modern [[standard Italian]] but instead evolved locally from [[Vulgar Latin]] independent of standard Italian, with little to no influence from what is now known as "standard Italian." They are therefore better classified as individual languages rather than "dialects."

In addition to having evolved, for the most part, separately from one another and with distinct individual histories, the [[Latin]]-based regional Romance languages of Italy are also better classified as separate languages rather than true "dialects" due to the often high degree in which they lack [[mutual intelligibility]]. Though mostly mutually unintelligible, the exact degree to which the regional Italian languages are mutually unintelligible varies, often correlating with geographical distance or geographical barriers between the languages, with some regional Italian languages that are closer in geographical proximity to each other or closer to each other on the [[dialect continuum]] being more or less mutually intelligible. For instance, a speaker of purely [[Eastern Lombard dialect|Eastern Lombard]], a language in [[Northern Italy]]'s [[Lombardy|Lombardy region]] that includes the [[Bergamasque dialect]], would have severely limited mutual intelligibility with a purely [[standard Italian]] speaker and would be nearly completely unintelligible to a speaker of a pure [[Sicilian language]] variant. Due to Eastern Lombard's status as a [[Gallo-Italic]] language, an Eastern Lombard speaker may, in fact, have more mutual intelligibility with a [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], or [[French language|French]] speaker than with a standard Italian or Sicilian language speaker. Meanwhile, a Sicilian language speaker would have a greater degree of mutual intelligibility with a speaker of the more closely related [[Neapolitan language]], but far less mutual intelligibility with a person speaking [[Gallo-Italic of Sicily|Sicilian Gallo-Italic]], a language that developed in isolated Lombard emigrant communities on the [[Sicily|same island]] as the Sicilian language.

Modern standard Italian itself is heavily based on the Latin-derived [[Florentine dialect|Florentine]] [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan language]]. The Tuscan-based language that would eventually become modern standard Italian had been used in poetry and literature since at least the [[12th century]], and it first spread throughout Italy among the educated upper class through the works of authors such as [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], and [[Petrarch]]. Dante's Florentine-Tuscan literary Italian thus slowly became the language of the [[literate]] and [[upper class]] in Italy, and it spread throughout the peninsula as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' among the Italian [[educated]] class as well as Italian traveling merchants. The economic prowess and cultural and artistic importance of [[Tuscany]] in the [[Late Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]] further encouraged the diffusion of the Florentine-Tuscan Italian throughout Italy and among the educated and powerful, though local and regional languages remained the main languages of the common people.

During the [[Risorgimento]], proponents of Italian republicanism and Italian nationalism, such as [[Alessandro Manzoni]], stressed the importance of establishing a uniform [[national language]] in order to better create an Italian [[national identity]]. With the [[unification of Italy]] in the 1860s, standard Italian became the official national language of the new Italian state, while the various unofficial regional languages of Italy gradually became regarded as subordinate "dialects" to Italian, increasingly associated negatively with lack of education or provincialism. However, at the time of the Italian Unification, standard Italian still existed mainly as a literary language, and only 2.5% of Italy's population could speak standard Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ita |title=Lewis, M. Paul (ed.), 2009. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Sixteenth edition |publisher=Ethnologue.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, the vast [[conscription]] of Italian men from all throughout Italy during [[World War I]] is credited with facilitating the diffusion of standard Italian among less educated Italian men, as these men from various regions with various regional languages were forced to communicate with each other in a common tongue while serving in the Italian military. With the eventual spread of the radio and television throughout Italy and the establishment of [[public education]], Italians from all regions were increasingly exposed to standard Italian, while literacy rates among all social classes improved. Today, the majority of Italians are able to speak standard Italian, though many Italians still speak their regional language regularly or as their primary day-to-day language, especially at home with family or when communicating with Italians from the same town or region. However, to some Italians, speaking a regional language, especially in a formal setting or outside of one's region, may carry a stigma or negative connotations associated with being lower class, uneducated, boorish, or overly informal.

Italians in different regions today may also speak regional varieties of standard Italian, or [[regional Italian|regional Italian dialects]], which, unlike the majority of [[languages of Italy]], are actually dialects of standard Italian rather than separate languages. A regional Italian dialect is generally standard Italian that has been heavily influenced or mixed with local or regional native languages and accents.

The languages of Italy are primarily [[Latin]]-based [[Romance languages]], with the most widely spoken languages falling within the [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian language]] family. This wide category includes:
*Standard Italian and [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]]; 
*the various related [[Central Italian]] dialects, such as [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]] in [[Rome]];
*the [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] group (also known as "Southern Italian"), which encompasses not only [[Naples]]' and [[Campania]]'s speech but also a variety of related neighboring varieties like the [[Irpinian dialect]], [[Abruzzo|Abruzzese]] and Southern [[Marche]]giano, [[Molisan]], [[Calabrian language#Northern Calabrian (Cosentino)|Northern Calabrian or Cosentino]], and the [[Bari dialect]]. The [[Cilentan dialect]] of [[Salerno]], in [[Campania]], is considered significantly influenced by the Neapolitan and the below-mentioned language groups;
*the [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] group, including [[Salentino dialect|Salentino]] and [[Calabrian languages|Calabrian]].

Aside from the more common [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian]] [[Romance language]]s in Italy, other native languages in Italy include: 
*a variety of [[Gallo-Italic languages]], [[Gallo-Rhaetian languages]], [[Rhaeto-Romance languages]], and [[Ibero-Romance languages]] (such as [[Emilian-Romagnol language|Emilian-Romagnol]], [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]], [[Friulian]], the [[Lombard language]]s, [[Gallo-Italic of Sicily|Sicilian Gallo-Italic]], [[Algherese dialect|Algherese]], the [[Vivaro-Alpine dialect]], [[Ladin language|Ladin]], etc.); 
*[[Germanic language|Germanic]] languages, such as the [[Cimbrian language]]s, [[Southern Bavarian]], [[Walser German]] and the [[Mòcheno language]];
*the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] [[Arbëresh language]]; 
*the [[Hellenic language|Hellenic]] [[Griko language]] and [[Calabrian Greek]];
*the [[Serbo-Croatian]] [[Slavomolisano dialect]];
*various [[Slovene language]]s, including the [[Gail Valley dialect]] and [[Istrian dialect]].

The [[Sardinian language]] is considered to be its own Romance language family, separate not only from Italian and the wider Italo-Dalmatian family but from all the other Neo-Latin families; it is often subdivided into the [[Campidanese Sardinian|Campidanese]] and [[Logudorese dialect|Logudorese]] dialects. The [[Corsican language|Corsican]]-related [[Gallurese dialect|Gallurese]] and [[Sassarese language|Sassarese]] which are also spoken in [[Sardinia]], on the other hand, are often considered closely related to or derived from [[Tuscan language|Tuscan]] and are therefore fully part of the Italo-Dalmatian languages. Furthermore, the [[Gallo-Romance]] language of [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]] and the [[Catalan language|Catalan]] [[Algherese dialect]] are also spoken in Sardinia, respectively in [[Carloforte]]/[[Calasetta]] and [[Alghero]].

=== The Balkans ===
The classification of speech varieties as dialects or languages and their relationship to other varieties of speech can be controversial and the verdicts inconsistent. English and [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] illustrate the point. English and Serbo-Croatian each have two major variants ([[British English|British]] and [[American English]], and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]], respectively), along with numerous other varieties. For political reasons, analyzing these varieties as "languages" or "dialects" yields inconsistent results: British and American English, spoken by close political and military allies, are almost universally regarded as varieties of a single language, whereas the national standards of [[Serbia]] and [[Croatia]], which are closer to each other than some local vernacular dialects of [[Serbo-Croatian]] are to themselves, differing to a similar extent as the formal varieties of English, are treated by some linguists from the region as distinct languages, largely because the two countries oscillate from being brotherly to being bitter enemies. (The [[Serbo-Croatian|Serbo-Croatian language article]] deals with this topic much more fully.)

Similar examples abound. [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], although largely mutually intelligible with [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], certain dialects of Serbo-Croatian and to a lesser extent the rest of the [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] [[dialect continuum]], is considered by Bulgarian linguists to be a Bulgarian dialect, in contrast with the contemporary international view and the view in the [[Republic of Macedonia]], which regards it as a language in its own right. Nevertheless, before the establishment of a literary standard of Macedonian in 1944, in most sources in and out of Bulgaria before the Second World War, the southern Slavonic dialect continuum covering the area of today's Republic of Macedonia were referred to as Bulgarian dialects.

===Lebanon===
In [[Lebanon]], a part of the Christian population considers "[[Lebanese language|Lebanese]]" to be in some sense a distinct language from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and not merely a dialect. During the civil war Christians often used Lebanese Arabic officially, and sporadically used the [[Latin script]] to write Lebanese, thus further distinguishing it from Arabic. All Lebanese laws are written in the standard literary form of Arabic, though parliamentary debate may be conducted in Lebanese Arabic.

===North Africa===
In Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco, the [[Darija]]s (spoken North African languages) are sometimes considered more different from other Arabic dialects. Officially, North African countries prefer to give preference to the [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] and conduct much of their political and religious life in it (adherence to [[Islam]]), and refrain from declaring each country's specific variety to be a separate language, because Literary Arabic is the [[liturgical language]] of Islam and the language of the Islamic sacred book, the [[Qur'an]]. Although, especially since the 1960s, the Darijas are occupying an increasing use and influence in the cultural life of these countries. Examples of cultural elements where Darijas' use became dominant include: theatre, film, music, television, advertisement, social media, folk-tale books and companies' names.

===Ukraine===
The [[Modern Ukrainian language]] has been in common use since the late 17th century, associated with the establishment of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]]. In the 19th century, the [[Tsar]]ist Government of the [[Russian Empire]] claimed that [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] was merely a dialect of [[Russian language|Russian]] and not a language on its own. According to these claims, the differences were few and caused by the conquest of western Ukraine by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. However, in reality the dialects in Ukraine were developing independently from the dialects in the modern Russia for several centuries, and as a result they differed substantially.

Following the signing of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Ukraine–Central Powers)|Brest-Litovsk Treaty]], the [[German Empire]] briefly [[Ukraine during World War I|gained control over Ukraine]] during [[World War I]], but was eventually defeated by the [[Triple Entente|Entente]], with major involvement by the Ukrainian Bolsheviks. After Bolsheviks managed to conquer the rest of Ukraine from the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] and the [[White movement|Whites]], Ukraine became part of the USSR, whence a process of Ukrainization was begun, with encouragement from Moscow. However, in the late 1920s - early 1930s, the process started to reverse. Witnessing the Ukrainian cultural revival spurred by the ukrainization in the early 1290s, and fearing that it might lead to an independence movement, Moscow started to remove from power and in some cases [[Executed Renaissance|physically eliminate the public proponents]] of ukrainization. The appointment of [[Pavel Postyshev]] as the secretary of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Ukraine]] marked the end of ukrainization, and the opposite process of russification started. After World War II, citing [[Ukrainian collaboration with Nazi Germany]] in an attempt to gain independence as the reason, Moscow changed its policy towards repression of the Ukrainian language.

Today the boundaries of the Ukrainian language to the Russian language are still not drawn clearly, with an intermediate dialect between them, called [[Surzhyk]], developing in Ukraine.

===Moldova===
There have been cases of a variety of speech being deliberately reclassified to serve political purposes. One example is [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]]. In 1996, the Moldovan parliament, citing fears of "Romanian expansionism", rejected a proposal from [[President of Moldova|President]] [[Mircea Snegur]] to change the name of the language to Romanian, and in 2003 a [[Moldovan–Romanian dictionary]] was published, purporting to show that the two countries speak different languages. Linguists of the [[Romanian Academy]] reacted by declaring that all the Moldovan words were also Romanian words; while in Moldova, the head of the [[Academy of Sciences of Moldova]], Ion Bărbuţă, described the dictionary as a politically motivated "absurdity".

===Greater China===
{{Main|Varieties of Chinese#Classification}}
Unlike languages that use alphabets to indicate their pronunciation, [[Chinese characters]] have developed from [[logograms]] that do not always give hints to their pronunciation. Although the written characters have remained relatively consistent for the last two thousand years, the pronunciation and grammar in different regions have developed to an extent that the [[Varieties of Chinese|varieties of the spoken language]] are often mutually unintelligible. As a series of migration to the south throughout the history, the regional languages of the south, including [[Gan Chinese|Gan]], [[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]], [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], [[Min Chinese|Min]], [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] and [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] often show traces of [[Old Chinese]] or [[Middle Chinese]]. From the [[Ming dynasty]] onward, Beijing has been the capital of China and the dialect spoken in Beijing has had the most prestige among other varieties. With the founding of the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]], [[Standard Mandarin]] was designated as the official language, based on the spoken language of Beijing. Since then, other spoken varieties are regarded as ''fangyan'' (regional speech). [[Cantonese]] is still the most commonly-used language in [[Guangzhou]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and among some overseas Chinese communities, whereas [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Hokkien]] has been accepted in [[Taiwan]] as an important local language alongside [[Taiwanese Mandarin|Mandarin]].

{{Main|Interlingua}}

One language, [[Interlingua]], was [[Interlingua and eligibility of international words|developed]] so that the languages of Western civilization would act as its dialects.&lt;ref name="coljld"&gt;[[Alice Vanderbilt Morris|Morris, Alice Vanderbilt]], [http://www.interlingua.fi/ialagr45.htm#manyrepresented General report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060814204450/http://www.interlingua.fi/ialagr45.htm |date=2006-08-14 }}. New York: International Auxiliary Language Association, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing from such concepts as the [[international scientific vocabulary]] and [[Standard Average European]], linguists{{who|date=July 2013}} developed a theory that the modern Western languages were actually dialects of a hidden or latent language.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Researchers at the [[International Auxiliary Language Association]] extracted words and affixes that they considered to be part of Interlingua's vocabulary.&lt;ref name = "jawmqc"&gt;[[Alexander Gode|Gode, Alexander]], ''[[Interlingua-English Dictionary]]''. New York: Storm Publishers, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, speakers of the Western languages would understand written or spoken Interlingua immediately, without prior study, since their own languages were its dialects.&lt;ref name = "coljld"/&gt; This has often turned out to be true, especially, but not solely, for speakers of the Romance languages and educated speakers of English. Interlingua has also been found to assist in the learning of other languages. In one study, Swedish high school students learning Interlingua were able to translate passages from Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian that students of those languages found too difficult to understand.&lt;ref&gt;Gopsill, F. P., ''International languages: A matter for Interlingua''. Sheffield: British Interlingua Society, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted, however, that the vocabulary of Interlingua extends beyond the Western language families.&lt;ref name = "jawmqc"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9267">[[File:Museum schnuetgen ausstellungskataloge.jpg|thumb|Exhibition catalogues of [[Museum Schnütgen]], Cologne]]

There are two types of '''exhibition catalogue''' (or '''exhibition catalog'''): a printed list of exhibits at an [[Art exhibition|art]] exhibition; and a directory of exhibitors at a [[trade fair]] or business-to-business event.

==Art or museum exhibition catalogues==
Catalogues for art or museum exhibitions may range in scale from a single printed sheet to a lavish [[hardcover]] "[[coffee table book]]". The advent of cheap colour-[[printing]] in the 1960s transformed what had usually been simple "handlists" with several works to each page into large scale "descriptive catalogues" that are intended as both contributions to scholarship and books likely to appeal to many general readers.  The catalogues for exhibitions held at a museum are now often far more detailed than the catalogues of their permanent collections. 
  
In the early 21st century, exhibitions that gather items from other institutions (museums, galleries, libraries, etc.) and that are elaborately publicized very often have catalogues in the form of substantial books.

===Format of art catalogues===
Book-sized exhibition catalogues in the West typically have a colour photograph of every item on display, and also of other relevant works not in the exhibition (these usually smaller and often in black and white).  There will be a short formal catalogue description of each item, and usually interpretative text often amounting to one or more pages.  The resulting book will have at least one introductory essay, often several, footnotes, [[bibliography]] and other [[critical apparatus]].  It is usually only in the language of the location, although if the exhibition is travelling internationally, local translated editions will be produced for each location.  The book may be published by the institution that hosts the exhibition (or one of these institutions), but is distributed by and often co-published with a larger publisher.  It will not dwell on the fact that it is the catalogue of a particular exhibition, and often will not contain a plan of the exhibition.  Visitors to the exhibition will anyway know this, and the intention - often successful - is to create a book which has a permanent usefulness.  Nearly all are produced in [[paperback]]; a hardback edition is a sign of serious intentions.  Most major catalogues are sold in at least some bookshops, and are available for order more widely through the booktrade.  Many receive specific sponsorship to finance them, and usually a number of authors contribute.
[[File:Bibliotheca Zriniana (Croatia) - katalog.jpg|thumb|Front cover of the 2008 [[Čakovec]] exhibition catalogue of ''[[Bibliotheca Zriniana]]'' library from 1662, owned by [[Nikola Zrinski]], Ban (Viceroy) of Croatia]]

In recent decades, exhibition catalogues have grown to prodigious sizes and may be the most comprehensive sources for even rather large subject areas.  Probably the largest to be produced were in the 1970s in a competitive spree by Italian provinces and German [[States of Germany|lander]] to promote the significance of their region by mounting huge exhibitions on the period when its cultural production was at its peak.  A typical example is the three-volume ''Die ''Parler'' und der schöne Stil 1350-1400. Europäische Kunst unter den Luxemburgern'' from [[Cologne]] of 1978, with a further two volumes published in 1980 on a colloquium held in conjunction with the exhibition.  The three volumes covering the exhibition proper amount to over a thousand pages and it would have been unfeasible to have taken them into the exhibition itself.  Another example is ''The History of Japanese Photography,'' 432 pages long and with over four hundred plates.

This trend was led in Britain by the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] and in the USA by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York and the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington.

===Japanese catalogues===
Japanese exhibition catalogues often provide captions, a certain amount of text, or both in a second language (usually English), and occasionally also a smaller amount in a third language. This is not always so: the large catalogue (over 360 pages) for a major exhibition of the [[Woodblock printing in Japan|wood-block]] artist [[Yasunori Taninaka]] is in Japanese alone. Meanwhile, ''Works by 25 Photographers in their 20s'' is completely bilingual, Japanese and English.

The great majority of Japanese exhibition catalogues are only available directly from the galleries or museums that host or hosted the exhibitions. These catalogues are acquired and shelved by libraries together with other books and are available on the used book market, but lack [[ISBN]]s. However, exceptions do exist: the catalogue of an exhibition of the photographs of [[Nakaji Yasui]] was produced via an independent publisher and distributed as a regular book.

==Catalogues for trade fairs==
Exhibition catalogues are used at commercial exhibitions and trade fairs to profile all the exhibitors at the event. They serve not only as a guide for visitors on the day, but also as an industry directory used afterwards by visitors (and others) to find suppliers and business partners.

Many exhibition catalogues are used by market researchers because they contain good quality information about companies that are active in a particular market place.

A typical exhibition catalogue contains the following: 
* Introduction and welcome message from the event organiser
* Floor plan showing the location of each exhibition stand
* Summary alphabetical list of exhibitors
* Exhibitor profiles (normally a textual description of each exhibitor plus their contact details)
* A ‘buyer’s guide’ where exhibitors are listed under relevant product or service categories
* Details of seminars or conference sessions running alongside the exhibition
* Advertisements promoting the exhibitors

The format of exhibition catalogues for trade fairs can range from A5-sized ‘saddle-stitched’ publications with descriptions of as few as 30-40 exhibitors, to much larger perfect-bound ‘stretched A5’ or A4-sized directories containing profiles on thousands of companies exhibiting at major international trade events such as The [[London Book Fair]], SIAL (the Paris-based food exhibition), and [[Nuremberg International Toy Fair]] (Spielwarenmesse).

The exhibition organiser is ultimately responsible for publishing the catalogue for their own event. However, many organisers outsource the design, production and advertising sales for these publications to specialist exhibition catalogue contract publishers operating within the exhibitions industry.

Other common terms to describe the exhibition catalogue at a trade fair include 'event guide', 'show guide', 'show catalogue', 'exhibition directory', 'fair guide' or 'exhibition guide'. Often exhibition organisers will add the word 'official' to the front of the name of the publication (e.g. 'Official exhibition catalogue') to distinguish their publication from unofficial exhibition catalogues for their event produced by trade magazine publishers.

== History ==
Dr. [[Gordon W. Prange]], a professor of History at the University of Maryland, worked as Chief of [[General Douglas MacArthur]]'s historical staff between 1946 and 1951 during the [[Occupation of Japan]]. When censorship of the Japanese media by the [[Civil Censorship Detachment]] (CCD) was lifted, Dr. Prange arranged for the shipment of the CCD materials to the University of Maryland.  The materials arrived at the University in 1950.  In 1978, the Board of Regents of the University of Maryland passed a motion to name the collection the "Gordon W. Prange Collection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.umd.edu/prange/about-us/gordon-w.-prange|title=Gordon W. Prange|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Holdings ==
The holdings of the Prange Collection once constituted the files copies of the Civil Censorship Detachment (CCD). Two copies of print publications were submitted to the CCD for censorship review.  One copy was retained by the CCD, and one copy was returned to the publisher or author with instructions for revisions.  The Prange Collection also holds several gift collections, including [[Charles Louis Kades|Charles L. Kades]]' drafts of the Japanese Constitution of 1947. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lib.guides.umd.edu/c.php?g=326790&amp;p=2194121|title=LibGuides: English-language Materials in the Gordon W.

The holdings are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.umd.edu/prange/collection-holdings/collection-holdings|title=Collection Holdings|publisher=[[University of Maryland]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 71,000 book and pamphlet titles

== Preservation == 
Between 1992 and 2001, the University of Maryland Libraries partnered with the [[National Diet Library]] (NDL) to microfilm the Prange magazines and newspapers.  In 2005, the digitization of the Prange books and pamphlets began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.umd.edu/prange/about-us/preservation--access|title=Preservation|publisher=[[National Diet Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Phase One consisted of the scanning of the 8,000 children's books in the Prange Collection, which was completed in 2010.  Phase Two began that same year with the scanning of the books in the social sciences, including political science, economics, and history. Currently, education-related books are being scanned. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rnavi.ndl.go.jp/kensei/entry/Prange.php|title=Gordon W.

'''Human rights in Cuba''' are under the scrutiny of human rights organizations, who accuse the [[Cuba]]n government of systematic human rights abuses, including [[arbitrary imprisonment]] and unfair trials.&lt;ref name="hrw1999"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=April 7, 1967 |url=http://www.cidh.org/countryrep/Cuba67sp/indice.htm |title=Information about human rights in Cuba |publisher=Comision Interamericana de Derechos Humanos |language=Spanish |accessdate=2006-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614143826/http://www.cidh.org/countryrep/Cuba67sp/indice.htm |archivedate=June 14, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = November 16, 2005 | url = http://newsfromrussia.com/world/2005/11/16/67822.html | title = Castro sued over alleged torture | publisher = News from Russia | accessdate = 2006-07-09 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060214150400/http://newsfromrussia.com/world/2005/11/16/67822.html | archivedate = February 14, 2006 | df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; International human rights organizations such as [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] have drawn attention to the actions of the human rights movement and designated members of it as [[Prisoner of conscience|prisoners of conscience]], such as [[Óscar Elías Biscet]].

[[Cuban law]] limits freedom of expression, association, assembly, movement, and the press. Concerns have also been expressed about the operation of [[due process]]. According to Human Rights Watch, even though Cuba, officially [[state atheism|atheist]] until 1992, now "permits greater opportunities for religious expression than it did in past years, and has allowed several religious-run humanitarian groups to operate, the government still maintains tight control on religious institutions, affiliated groups, and individual believers".&lt;ref name="hrw1999"/&gt; [[Censorship in Cuba]] has also been at the center of complaints.&lt;ref name="RWB-Index2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cubaonline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/rapport_gb_md_1.pdf |title=Going online in Cuba: Internet under surveillance |publisher=Reporters Without Borders |year=2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303221407/http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/rapport_gb_md_1.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the report of Human Rights Watch from 2017 the [[government]] continues to rely on arbitrary detention to harass and intimidate critics, independent activists, [[Dissident|political opponents]], and others. This report added that the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and [[National Reconciliation]], an independent human rights group that lacks official authorization and is therefore considered illegal by the government, received more than 7,900 reports of arbitrary detentions from January through August 2016. This represents the highest monthly average of detentions in the past six years.&lt;ref name="Cuba Events of 2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/cuba|title=World Report 2017: Rights Trends in Cuba|author=|date=12 January 2017|website=hrw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amnesty International's 2017-2018 Annual Report also noted that more [[Arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrary detentions]], discriminatory layoffs by state agencies and harassments in [[self-employment]] with the aim of making them silent in criticism. Regarding any Progress in [[education]] Amnesty International reported that advances in education were undermined by ongoing online and offline censorship. Cuba remained mostly closed to independent human rights monitors.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/americas/cuba/report-cuba/|title=Cuba 2017/2018|author=|date=|website=www.amnesty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relating to arbitrary arrests and [[Detention (imprisonment)|detentions]] the report added that human rights and political activists continued to be harassed, [[Intimidation|intimidated]] and arbitrarily detained in high numbers. The Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation, a Cuban [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] not officially recognized by the state, recorded 5,155 arbitrary detentions in 2017, compared to 9,940 in 2016.

== History ==
{{Politics of Cuba}}
During [[Spanish colonization]], the oppression of the indigenous populations was chronicled at length by clergyman [[Bartolomé de las Casas]]. The subsequent transportation of African slaves to the island, which lasted over 300 years, led to [[United Kingdom|British]] military intervention and a determination "to put a stop to these abuses".&lt;ref&gt;"Report from the British commissionary judge, Havana, to the Foreign secretary (Lord Stanley)." September 30, 1866. Thomas, Hugh. ''Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom''. p.1050.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Cuba achieved independence in 1902, successive Cuban governments have been criticised and condemned by various groups, both within Cuba and internationally, for human rights violations on the island. During the latter part of the Spanish colonial era in Cuba, human rights on the island became a particular international concern. After a visit to the region in 1898, [[U.S. Senator]] [[Redfield Proctor]] estimated that up to 200,000 Cubans had died from starvation and disease within "[[Valeriano Weyler, 1st Duke of Rubí#Cuba|Spanish forts]]", essentially [[concentration camps]].&lt;ref&gt;http://hcs.harvard.edu/~rhetoric/proctor.htm Harvard rhetorical society&lt;/ref&gt; The concern was a contributory factor in garnering support for the [[Spanish–American War]] in the U.S.

After independence, and following a sustained period of instability, the 1924–33 government of [[Gerardo Machado]] proved to be authoritarian. Machado extended his rule until [[Fulgencio Batista]] led an uprising called the Revolt of the Sergeants, as part of a coup which deposed Machado in 1933. Batista then became the strongman behind a succession of puppet presidents until he was himself elected president in 1940. According to [[Hugh Thomas (writer)|Hugh Thomas]], the post-Machado period was marked by violent reprisals, mass lynchings and a deterioration towards corruption and ''gansterismo'' throughout the island.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Thomas (writer)|Hugh Thomas]]. ''Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom''. p.388&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1940, Cuba had a multiparty electoral system until [[Fulgencio Batista]] (President from 1940–1944) staged a coup with military backing on March 10, 1952.&lt;ref name="Bethell-Cuba"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cuba|author=Leslie Bethell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sweig-Inside"&gt;{{cite book|title=Inside the Cuban Revolution|author=Julia E. Sweig|isbn=978-0-674-01612-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, ''Time'' magazine wrote: "Cuba's fanatic, poorly armed rebels last week tried to smash President Fulgencio Batista with the ultimate weapon of civilian revolutions: the general strike.&amp;nbsp;... Fulgencio Batista got ready for the strike by offering immunity to anyone who killed a striker and by threatening to jail any employer who closed shop." During the strike, militants and youths stole guns, and threw bombs (one of which may have set up a gas-mains fire), after which some people were killed in clashes.

The strike was short-lived: "With the upper hand, Batista drove boldly around the city while his cops proceeded to make their supremacy complete. When a patrol car radioed that it had clashed with rebels and had 'a dead man and a prisoner', the dispatcher ordered: 'Shoot him.' At midafternoon, cops burst into a boardinghouse, grabbed three young men who were leaders of Cuba's lay Catholic Action movement, which sympathizes with Castro. Two hours later their stripped, tortured and bullet-torn bodies were turned over to relatives. Total dead: 43."{{attribution needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,810279,00.html |work=Time |title=CUBA: Strongman's Round |date=April 21, 1958 |accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, [[Fidel Castro]] and his forces succeeded in displacing Batista from power. At that time there were fundamental changes in the judicial and political process. During this transitional period there were some concerns voiced about [[due process]].&lt;ref&gt;The Day After — Cuba: His Brother's Keeper Foreign Policy archive.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiu.edu/~fcf/castro_year1/castroyr1.ruleoflaw.html The End of the Rule of Law March 1959] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312142726/http://www.fiu.edu/~fcf/castro_year1/castroyr1.ruleoflaw.html |date=March 12, 2013 }} Fidel Castro, by Robert E. Quirk 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Cuban National Reconciliation movement", a U.S.-based organisation that claims to act as a forum for discussing Cuban society, has detailed what it believes are complex variables when analysing human rights immediately after the revolution. In the 1960s, violent confrontations known as the [[Escambray Rebellion]] between the Cuban government and armed opposition were ongoing, but had declined by the early 1970s. The group asserts that by the time international human rights movements flourished in the 1970s, the most severe period of repression was over, making non-partisan retrospective assessments of the period difficult. The reconciliation movement also cite the difficulties in assessing accounts of abuses that are commonly split upon partisan lines. According to the group, [[Cuban exiles]] who were often the first to denounce the Cuban government, largely shared an anti-Communist ideology and overlooked violations committed by other regimes, whilst many left leaning observers did not give the claims of Cuban victims due consideration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memoria.fiu.edu/memoria/documents/Book_English.pdf ''Cuban National Reconciliation movement''] Task force report 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

After coming to power in 1959, Fidel Castro's government built a highly effective machinery of [[Political repression|repression]], according to Human Rights Watch.&lt;ref name="hrw1999"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1999/cuba/Cuba996-01.htm#P348_12349|title=Cuba's repressive machinery|publisher=Human Rights Watch|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political executions ===
Various estimates have been made in order to ascertain the number of political executions carried out on behalf of the Cuban government since the revolution. Within the first two months of the 1959, Castro's government performed more than 300 executions of Batista officials,&lt;ref name="APfeb59"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berrellez|first1=Robert|title=True Picture Of Batista Regime's Atrocities In Cuba Begins To Emerge|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1338&amp;dat=19590223&amp;id=NP1XAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=O_cDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2501,4729775|accessdate=19 March 2017|work=[[Spokane Daily Chronicle]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=23 February 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Latin American historian Thomas E.

Human Rights'', Amnesty International Publications, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-Castro Archivo Cuba estimates that 4,000 people were executed in Cuba between 1959 and 2016. [[The Black Book of Communism]] estimated that between 15,000 and 17,000 people were executed by the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-38153673|title=Fidel Castro: las muertes, desapariciones y detenciones que se le atribuyen al líder de la Revolución Cubana|first=|last=Redacción|date=3 December 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of those executed directly following the 1959 revolution were policemen, politicians and informers for the Batista regime who were accused of crimes such as torture and murder, and their public trials and executions enjoyed widespread popular support among the Cuban population. Most scholars agree that those executed were probably guilty as charged, but their trials did not follow [[due process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Chase|first=Michelle|authorlink=|editor1=[[Greg Grandin]]|editor2=Joseph Gilbert|editor-link=|encyclopedia=A Century of Revolution|title=The Trials|url=http://read.dukeupress.edu/content/a-century-of-revolution|accessdate=2 October 2015|year=2010|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|location=Durham, NC|isbn= 0822347377|doi=|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YJ7ZBGy0wsIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=a%20century%20of%20revolution&amp;pg=PA163#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 163–198]|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nova.wpunj.edu/newpolitics/issue25/farber25.htm|title=The Resurrection of Che Guevara|author=|date=|website=nova.wpunj.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cuban Government justified such measures on the grounds that the application of the death penalty in Cuba against war criminals and others followed the same procedure as the one previously followed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] during the [[Nuremberg trials]]. Some Cuban scholars maintain that had the government not applied severe legislation against the torturers, terrorists, and other criminals employed by the Batista regime, the people themselves would have taken justice into their own hands.&lt;ref&gt;Raul Gomez Treto, "Thirty Years of Cuban Revolutionary Penal Law", ''Latin American Perspectives'', Vol. 18, No. 2, Spring, 1991, pp. 114–125&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Refugees ===
According to the US government, some 1,200,000 Cubans (about 10% of the current population) left the island for the United States between 1959 and 1993,&lt;ref name="census.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/facts_for_features_special_editions/000797.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090709154810/http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/facts_for_features_special_editions/000797.html |archivedate=2009-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; often by sea in small boats and [[Balseros (rafters)|fragile rafts]].

=== Forced labor camps and abuse of prisoners ===
In 1987 a "Tribunal on Cuba" was held in [[Paris]] to present testimonies by former prisoners of Cuba's penal system to the international media. The gathering was sponsored by Resistance International and The Coalition of Committees for the Rights of Man in Cuba. The testimonies presented at the tribunal, before an international panel, alleged a pattern of torture in Cuba's prisons and "hard labor camps". These included beatings, biological experiments in diet restrictions, violent interrogations and extremely unsanitary conditions. The jury concurred with allegations of arbitrary arrests; sentencing by court martial with neither public audience nor defense; periods in hard labour camps without sufficient food, clothes and medical care; and the arrests of children over nine years old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://polarch.sas.ac.uk/pdf_documents/TropicalGulag.pdf Tribunal on Cuba] Paris April 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of reported executions in Cuba declined during the 1970s and by the 1980s they were restricted to rare high-profile cases, notably the execution of General [[Arnaldo Ochoa]] in 1989. Ochoa, once proclaimed "Hero of the Revolution" by Fidel Castro, along with three other high-ranking officers, was brought to trial for [[drug trafficking]]. This offense carries a maximum sentence of 20 years, but Ochoa and the others were convicted of [[treason]] and promptly executed. Opponents of the Castro government outside of Cuba expressed skepticism about the legitimacy of Ochoa's arrest and execution.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

=== Political abuse of psychiatry ===
Although Cuba has been politically connected to the Soviet Union since the United States broke off relations with Cuba shortly after the president [[Fidel Castro]] came to power in 1959, few considerable allegations regarding the [[political abuse of psychiatry]] in this country emerged before the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed"&gt;{{cite book|title=Medicine betrayed: the participation of doctors in human rights abuses|year=1992|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=1-85649-104-8|pages=74–76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bMTu_oIfVsIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA74,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|74}} [[Americas Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]] published reports alluding to cases of possible unwarranted hospitalization and ill-treatment of political prisoners.&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed" /&gt;{{rp|75}} These reports concerned the Gustavo Machin hospital in [[Santiago de Cuba]] in the southeast of the country and the major mental hospital in [[Havana]].&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed" /&gt;{{rp|75}} In 1977, a report on the alleged abuse of psychiatry in Cuba presenting cases of ill-treatment in mental hospitals going back to the 1970s came out in the United States.&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed" /&gt;{{rp|75}} It presents grave allegations that prisoners end up in the forensic ward of mental hospitals in Santiago de Cuba and Havana where they undergo ill-treatment including [[electroconvulsive therapy]] without [[muscle relaxant]]s or [[anaesthesia]].&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed" /&gt;{{rp|75}} The reported application of ECT in the forensic wards seems, at least in many of the cited cases, not to be an adequate clinical treatment for the diagnosed state of the prisoner—in some cases the prisoners seem not to have been diagnosed at all.&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed" /&gt;{{rp|75}} Conditions in the forensic wards have been described in repulsive terms and apparently are in striking contrast to the other parts of the mental hospitals that are said to be well-kept and modern.&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed" /&gt;{{rp|75}}

In August 1981, the Marxist historian Ariel Hidalgo was apprehended and accused of "incitement against the social order, international solidarity and the Socialist State" and sentenced to eight years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed" /&gt;{{rp|75}} In September 1981, he was transported from State Security Headquarters to the Carbó-Serviá (forensic) ward of Havana Psychiatric Hospital where he stayed for several weeks.&lt;ref name="Medicine betrayed" /&gt;{{rp|76}}

===Political repression===
{{Further|Cuban dissidents}}

A 2009 report by [[Human Rights Watch]] concluded that "Raúl Castro has kept Cuba’s repressive machinery firmly in place...since being handed power by his brother Fidel Castro."&lt;ref name='HRW 2009'&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.hrw.org/news/2009/11/18/cuba-ra-l-castro-imprisons-critics-crushes-dissent | title = New Castro, Same Cuba: Political Prisoners in the Post-Fidel Era | accessdate = 2012-02-17 | date = 2009-11-18 | work = Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report found that "[s]cores of political prisoners arrested under Fidel continue to languish in prison, and Raúl has used draconian laws and sham trials to incarcerate scores more who have dared to exercise their fundamental rights."

[[File:Press conference, Havana.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jorge Luis García Pérez]] assailed the [[Cuban thaw]] as a capitulation to the Castro's regime]]
A 1999 Human Rights Watch report notes that the Interior Ministry's principal responsibility is to monitor the Cuban population for signs of dissent.&lt;ref name="HRW-Cuba1999-VIII"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1999/cuba/Cuba996-08.htm#P1517_344135|title=VIII. ROUTINE REPRESSION|publisher=Human Rights Watch|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 two new mechanisms for internal surveillance and control emerged. Communist Party leaders organized the Singular Systems of Vigilance and Protection (Sistema Unico de Vigilancia y Protección, SUVP). Rapid Action Brigades (Brigadas de Acción Rapida, also referred to as Rapid Response Brigades, or Brigadas de Respuesta Rápida) observe and control dissidents.&lt;ref name="HRW-Cuba1999-VIII"/&gt; The government also "maintains academic and labor files (expedientes escolares y laborales) for each citizen, in which officials record actions or statements that may bear on the person's loyalty to the revolution. Before advancing to a new school or position, the individual's record must first be deemed acceptable".&lt;ref name="HRW-Cuba1999-VIII"/&gt;

The opposition movement in Cuba is a widespread collection of individuals and nongovernmental organizations, most of whom are working for the respect of [[individual rights]] on the island.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/report2004/cub-summary-eng Amnesty International&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608152653/http://web.amnesty.org/report2004/cub-summary-eng |date=June 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the best known Cuban members of the opposition include the [[Ladies in White]] (recipients of the [[Sakharov Prize]] for Freedom of Thought), [[Marta Beatriz Roque]], and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] nominee and [[Sakharov Prize]] winner [[Oswaldo Payá]], as well as [[Óscar Elías Biscet]], and [[Jorge Luis García Pérez]] "Antúnez."

===Censorship===
{{Main|Censorship in Cuba}}

Cuba officially adopted the civil and political rights enumerated in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948. One of the key principles in the declaration was the insistence on [[Freedom of Speech|Freedom of expression and opinion]]. The [[Cuban constitution]] says that free speech is allowed "in keeping with the objectives of socialist society" and that artistic creation is allowed "as long as its content is not contrary to the Revolution".

Cuba's ranking was on the bottom of the [[Press Freedom Index]] 2008 compiled by the [[Reporters Without Borders]] (RWB).&lt;ref name="RWB-Index2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/cl_en_2008.pdf |title=Press Freedom Index 2008 |publisher=Reporters Without Borders |year=2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303221403/http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/cl_en_2008.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuba was named one of the ten most censored countries in the world by the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]].&lt;ref name="CPJ-2006"/&gt;

Books, newspapers, radio channels, television channels, movies and music are supposedly censored, although a lot of foreign media, particularly movies and music, has notably been heard and seen without any police interference.

Media is operated under the supervision of the [[Communist Party of Cuba|Communist Party's]] ''Department of Revolutionary Orientation'', which "develops and coordinates propaganda strategies".&lt;ref name="CPJ-2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpj.org/censored/censored_06.html|title=10 most censored countries|publisher=The Committee to Protect Journalists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights groups and international organizations believe that these articles subordinate the exercise of freedom of expression to the state. The [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] assess that: "It is evident that the exercise of the right to freedom of expression under this article of the Constitution is governed by two fundamental determinants: on the one hand, the preservation and strengthening of the communist State; on the other, the need to muzzle any criticism of the group in power."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiu.edu/~fcf/IACHR.html#II Inter-American Commission on Human Rights Report on Cuba] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128091641/http://www.fiu.edu/~fcf/IACHR.html#II |date=January 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights group [[Amnesty International]] assert that the universal state ownership of the media means that freedom of expression is restricted. Thus the exercise of the right to freedom of expression is restricted by the lack of means of mass communication falling outside state control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGAMR250012006 CUBA: fundamental freedoms still under attack] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718170319/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGAMR250012006 |date=2008-07-18 }} Amnesty&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] states: "Refusing to recognize human rights monitoring as a legitimate activity, the government denies legal status to local human rights groups. Individuals who belong to these groups face systematic harassment, with the government putting up obstacles to impede them from documenting human rights conditions. In addition, international human rights groups such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are barred from sending fact-finding missions to Cuba. It remains one of the few countries in the world to deny the International Committee of the Red Cross access to its prisons."&lt;ref name=HumanRightsWatch&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/01/18/cuba12207.htm "Cuba"].

Foreign journalists are systematically expelled from Cuba, e.g. notable journalists of [[New Left]] [[Gazeta Wyborcza]], Anna Bikont and Seweryn Blumsztahn, were expelled in 2005.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

=== Restrictions of assembly ===
Human Rights Watch states that "[[freedom of assembly]] is severely restricted in Cuba, and political dissidents are generally prohibited from meeting in large groups.&lt;ref name=HumanRightsWatch/&gt; [[Amnesty International|Amnesty]] states that "All human rights, civil and professional associations and unions that exist today in Cuba outside the officialdom of the state apparatus and mass organizations controlled by the government are barred from having legal status. This often puts at risk the individuals who belong to these associations of facing harassment, intimidation or criminal charges for activities which constitute the legitimate exercise of the fundamental freedoms of expression, association and assembly."{{dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGAMR250012006?open&amp;of=ENG-CUB] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518055507/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGAMR250012006?open&amp;of=ENG-CUB|date=May 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cuban authorities only recognize a single national trade union centre, the [[Central de Trabajadores de Cuba]] (CTC), heavily controlled by the State and the Communist Party which appoints its leaders. Membership is compulsory for all workers. Before a worker can be hired, they must sign a contract in which they promise to support the Communist Party and everything it represents{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}. The government explicitly prohibits independent trade unions, there is systematic harassment and detention of labor activists, and the leaders of attempted independent unions have been imprisoned. The right to strike is not recognized in law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubaverdad.net/workers_paradise.htm "Is Cuba a 'Workers Paradise'?."] Cuba Verdad.

===Society===
In 2001 an attempt was made by [[Oswaldo Payá Sardiñas]] and others from the Christian Liberation Movement, operating as the [[Varela Project]], to have a national [[plebiscite]] using provisions in the [[Constitution of Cuba]] which provided for [[initiative|citizen initiative]]. If accepted by the government and approved by public vote, the amendments would have established such things as [[freedom of association]], [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of press]], as well as starting private businesses. The [[petition]] was refused by the National Assembly and in response a referendum was held in support of socialism being a permanent fixture of the constitution, for which the government claimed 99% voter approval.

Another important project is the establishment of the Assembly to Promote Civil Society. The Assembly to Promote Civil Society in Cuba is a coalition of 365 independent civil society groups with the stated aims of forming a democratic culture, developing a social movement, strengthening the Assembly’s organization, communicating among groups to promote the civil society, using all available means to combat poverty and seeking the betterment of the community’s life conditions, developing a true knowledge of Cuba’s history, in all its dimensions: economic, social and political, undertaking activities and projects aimed at the protection and conservation of natural resources and the ecosystem, and promoting a true culture on labor rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asambleasociedadcivilcuba.info/Asamblea/Asamblea-en.htm Sitio Oficial de la Asamblea para Promover la Sociedad Civil en Cuba&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615070735/http://www.asambleasociedadcivilcuba.info/Asamblea/Asamblea-en.htm |date=June 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assembly had its first meeting in May 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/05/20/world/main697016.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Cuban Dissidents Cry 'Freedom' | date=May 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capital punishment===
{{main|Capital punishment in Cuba}}
Cuba placed a moratorium on the use of [[capital punishment]] in 1999. However, an exception was made when, in 2003, three Cubans were executed for a ferry hijacking in which Cuban passengers and two young French female tourists were held at gunpoint. The hijackers were attempting to reach Florida, USA in order to seek asylum. No one was harmed in the incident but the gang held knives to the throats and threatened to kill them if the vessel was not given enough fuel to carry them to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2941041.stm|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acts of repudiation===
Human rights groups including Amnesty International have long been critical of what the Cuban authorities have termed "Acts of repudiation" (''actos de repudio''). These acts occur when large groups of citizens verbally abuse, intimidate and sometimes physically assault and throw stones and other objects at the homes of Cubans who are considered [[counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionaries]]. Human rights groups suspect that these acts are often carried out in collusion with the security forces and sometimes involve the [[Committees for the Defence of the Revolution]] or the Rapid Response Brigades. The level of violence of these acts have increased significantly since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGAMR250012006 Amnesty International report 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718170319/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGAMR250012006 |date=2008-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable prisoners of conscience===
* In 1960, [[Armando Valladares]] was working at the Cuban Postal Savings Bank when agents of the Ministry of Communications handed him a card bearing a communist slogan and told him to put it on his worktable. The 23-year-old Valladares refused. Astonished, the agents asked him if he had anything against Castro. Valladares answered that if Castro was a communist, he did. Valladares was convicted on a charge of placing bombs in public places and was sentenced to thirty years in prison. His supporters contend that he was never part of the Batista police as alleged by Castro supporters (because Valladares was only 19 at the time of the revolution), and that his imprisonment was the result of his vocal opposition to the Castro government. Conservative author [[David Horowitz (conservative writer)|David Horowitz]] has called him a "Human Rights Hero." Valladares claims to have been tortured and humiliated while he was on a [[hunger strike]] in order to protest against prison abuses; he claims the guards denied him water until he became delirious, and they proceeded to urinate in his mouth and on his face. Valladares was released from prison after serving twenty-two years of his sentence upon the intercession of France's Socialist President [[François Mitterrand]].
* In 1973, gay writer [[Reinaldo Arenas]] was sent to prison after being charged and convicted of 'ideological deviation' and for publishing abroad without official consent. He escaped from prison and tried to leave Cuba by launching himself from the shore on a tire inner tube. The attempt failed and he was re-arrested near Lenin Park and imprisoned at the notorious El Morro Castle alongside murderers and rapists. After escaping from Cuba, Arenas described the horrors he endured under the Cuban government in his autobiography ''Antes que anochezca'' (1992), English translation ''Before Night Falls'' (1993).
* On August 28, 1998, a Havana court sentenced [[Reynaldo Alfaro García]], a member of the [[Democratic Solidarity Party]], to three years in prison for "spreading enemy propaganda" and "rumour-mongering".
* Desi Mendoza, a Cuban doctor, was imprisoned for making statements criticizing Cuba's response to an [[epidemic]] of [[dengue fever]] in [[Santiago de Cuba]] which he alleged had caused several deaths. Dr. Mendoza had previously been fired from his job in a Cuban hospital three years earlier for establishing an independent medical association. He was later released due to ill-health, subject to his leaving the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGAMR250281997?open%26of%3DENG-348 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415060951/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGAMR250281997?open&amp;of=ENG-348 |archivedate=2006-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aaas.org/program/scientific-responsibility-human-rights-law|title=Scientific Responsibility, Human Rights &amp; Law Program|author=|date=17 June 2013|website=AAAS - The World's Largest General Scientific Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Óscar Elías Biscet]], a medical doctor, has been sentenced to jail for 25 years for his non-violent, but vocal opposition to Castro.
* In early 2003, dozens of persons, including independent journalists, librarians and other opponents of the Castro government were jailed after summary [[show trial]]s, with some sentences in excess of 20 years, on the charge of receiving money from the United States in order to carry out anti-government activities.
* An [[Amnesty International]] report, [https://web.archive.org/web/20060518055507/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGAMR250012006?open&amp;of=ENG-CUB CUBA: fundamental freedoms still under attack] from [[Amnesty International]] calls for the "Cuban authorities to release all prisoners of conscience immediately and unconditionally" and to "revoke all legislation that restricts freedom of expression, assembly and association, and to put a halt to all actions to harass and intimidate dissidents, journalists, and [[human rights defender]]s".
* [[Jorge Luis García Pérez]] was reported to have been released from prison in April 2007 after serving his full sentence of 17 years and 34 days for having, at the age of 25, shouted slogans against Fidel Castro. García Antúnez was convicted of sabotage after authorities accused him of setting fire to sugar cane fields, sabotage, spreading "enemy propaganda", and being in illegal possession of a weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Castro opponent free after 17 years in jail | date=April 24, 2007 | publisher= | url =https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSN2331960920070423 | work =Reuters | pages = | accessdate = 2007-04-24 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engAMR250032001!Open Insufficient medical care for Jorge Luis García Pérez] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112015238/http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engAMR250032001%21Open |date=January 12, 2007 }}.

=== Travel and immigration ===

As of January 14, 2013, all Cuban government-imposed travel restrictions and controls have been abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/internacionales/275273-reforma-migratoria-favorece-militantes-cubanos/|title=Reforma migratoria también favorece a los militantes cubanos|last=|first=|date=January 23, 2013|website=El Nuevo Diario|publisher=|access-date=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cuba: What Everyone Needs to Know|last=Sweig|first=Julia|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=264–265|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that date, any Cuban citizen, with a valid passport, can leave the country at will, without let or hindrance from the Cuban authorities. Visa requirements for Cuban citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Cuba. In 2014, Cuban citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 61 countries and territories, ranking the Cuban passport 69th in the world. Persons holding dual Spanish and Cuban citizenships are now allowed to travel freely, using their Spanish passport in lieu of a visa for countries normally requiring a visa for the Cuban passport. Moreover, ever since that date, the Cuban government extended the allowable time abroad from 11 to 24 months, allowing Cubans who return within the 24-month time frame to retain their status and benefits of "Cuban Resident of the Interior". Should the citizen remain out of Cuba for more that 24 months, then his status would change to "Cuban Resident of the Exterior" and he would lose his privileges within. By this change, there is no longer such a thing as "illegal" or "unauthorized" travel, and therefore persons who leave Cuba via unconventional means (boats etc.) are no longer violating Cuban law, and therefore not subject to detention or imprisonment.

Prior to January 13, 2013, Cuban citizens could not travel abroad, leave or return to Cuba without first obtaining official permission along with applying for a government issued passport and travel visa, which was often denied.&lt;ref name="travel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/01/18/cuba12207.htm|title=Essential Background: Overview of human rights issues in

Cuba (Human Rights Watch, 31-12-2005)|author=|date=|website=hrw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unauthorized travel abroad had sometimes resulted in criminal prosecution. It was common, in those days, that certain citizens who were authorized travel (primarily medical personnel and other professionals deemed essential to the country) were not permitted to take their children with them overseas. In the event that Cuban doctors defect to the United States when they are sent to a "mission" out of Cuba to any foreign country, any children left behind would not be allowed to join their defector parent for a minimum of ten years, even if they had received a foreign visa, and regardless of their age.&lt;ref name="travel"/&gt; Castro opposition leader [[Oswaldo Payá]] has been allowed to travel abroad to receive his [[Sakharov Prize]], but [[Ladies in White]] was not.

Even discussing about unauthorized travel carried a six-month prison sentence.&lt;ref name="kobayashi"/&gt;

From 1959 through 1993, some 1.2 million Cubans (about 10% of the current population) left the island for the United States,&lt;ref name="census.gov"/&gt; often by sea in small boats and fragile rafts. In the early years, a number of those who could claim dual Spanish-Cuban citizenship left for [[Spain]]. Over time a number of [[Cuban Jews]] were allowed to emigrate to [[Israel]] after quiet negotiations; the majority of the 10,000 or so Jews who were in Cuba in 1959 have left. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, many Cubans now reside in a diverse number of countries, some ending up in countries of the [[European Union]]. A large number of Cubans live in [[Mexico]] and [[Canada]].

At times the exodus was tolerated by the Cuban government as a "release valve"; at other times the government has impeded it. Some Cubans left for economic reasons and some for political ones. Others emigrated by way of the [[United States Navy|U.S. Naval Base]] at [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]], which is blocked on the Cuban (land) side by barbed-wired fences and land mines.

In 1995 the US government entered into an agreement with the Cuban government to resolve the emigration crisis that created the [[Mariel Boatlift]] of 1980, when Castro opened the docks to anyone who wanted to leave. The result of the negotiations was an agreement under which the United States was required to issue 20,000 visas annually to Cuban emigrants. This quota is rarely filled; the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] has refused to comply with the act, issuing only 505 visas to Cubans in the first six months of 2003. It has also blocked some Cubans who have visas.

On July 13, 1994, 72 Cubans attempted to leave the Island on a [[World War II]] era [[tugboat]] named the ''[[13 de Marzo Incident|13 de Marzo]]''. In an attempt by the Cuban Navy to stop the tugboat, patrol boats were sent out to intercept the tug. Crewmen and survivors reported that the interception vessels rammed the tugboat and sprayed its passengers with high-pressure fire hoses, sweeping many overboard.

The US Coast Guard reported that the interceptions in high seas have been characterized as violent confrontations with authorities and by the deaths of immigrants. According to the same authorities, the Cubans are taken to the US on speed boats by a network of criminals specialized in human trafficking, former drug traffickers, based in southern Florida which now find contraband of humans more lucrative than drugs. These criminals charge 8 to 12 thousand dollars per person, overcrowding the small vessels. The majority of those that attempt to emigrate are individuals that have relatives in the United States, others who do not qualify to be considered as legal immigrants in the US, or those who do not want to wait their turn in the annual quota, assigned under the migratory treaties for legal immigrants &lt;ref name="Gomez"&gt;{{cite web |date=February 2006 | url = https://groups.yahoo.com/group/CubaNews/message/46114 | title =Washington's Weapon to Create a Migratory Crisis | publisher =AIN }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since November 1966, the [[Cuban Adjustment Act]] provides automatic permanent residency for almost all Cubans arriving legally or illegally after one year and one day in the US. No immigrant from any other nation has this privilege. Controversy over this policy centers around the loss of Cuba's scientists, professionals, technicians and other skilled individuals, but it has also prompted concerns of a migratory crisis.

At the end of the 2005 fiscal year which ended September 30, the US Coast Guard Service reported having intercepted 2,712 Cubans at sea, more than double the 1,225 reported in 2004&lt;ref name="Gomez"/&gt; The figure for 2005 is the third highest of Cubans intercepted in the Florida straights during the last 12 years. The highest had been reported in 1993 with 3,656 and 1994 when over 30,000 Cubans emigrated illegally due to the so-called migratory crisis between the two countries.&lt;ref name="Gomez"/&gt;

The 1994 and 1995 migratory accords signed between Havana and Washington, and which emerged due to the crisis in August 1994, are still in effect. These accords force the US to return all those intercepted at sea by US authorities to Cuba, except the cases in which political persecution can be proven to justify exile in the United States.

The accords were designed to discourage those who would consider emigrating illegally by sea but the Bush administration has not complied with Washington's part of the agreements.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Although the Coast Guard says that only 2.5 percent of the Cubans intercepted are granted political asylum, the public understanding, the public perception in Cuba and among the Cuban community in Miami, is not the same. And since that is not the perception, more and more people continue to illegally leave the island by sea causing fatal consequences. According to studies carried out by Cuban experts on the island, it is estimated that at least 15 percent of those that attempt to cross the sea die before reaching the US.&lt;ref name="Gomez"/&gt;

However, figures of those fleeing other Latin American or Caribbean countries of origin compare similarly with those of Cuba. During the 2005 fiscal year, 3,612 Dominicans were picked up at high seas attempting to illegally reach the US (900 more than Cubans intercepted) and in 2004, 3,229 Haitians were also picked up (2,000 more than the 1,225 Cubans that fiscal year). The Brazilian daily ''O Globo'' published an article on illegal immigrants in the US, quoting official sources, pointing out that during the first semester of 2005, 27,396 Brazilians were stopped from illegally crossing US borders, an average of 4,556 per month and 152 a day. In 2004, a total of 1,160,000 foreigners, were stopped when attempting to illegally enter the US, 93 percent of them (close to 1,080,000) were Mexicans.&lt;ref name="Gomez"/&gt;

===Education===
{{Main|Education in Cuba}}
Education in Cuba is normally free at all levels and controlled by the Ministry for Education. In 1961 the government nationalized all private educational institutions and introduced a state-directed education system. The system has been criticized for political indoctrination and for monitoring the political opinions of the students.

Strong ideological content is present. The constitution states that educational and cultural policy is based on Marxism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/TestFrame/e7d25838f4d76da08025666700335f64?Opendocument|title=unhchr.ch|author=|date=|website=www.unhchr.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Healthcare===
{{Main|Healthcare of Cuba}}
The Cuban government operates on national health system and assumes full fiscal and administrative responsibility for the health care of its citizens. The government prohibits any private alternatives to the national health system. In 1976, Cuba's healthcare program was enshrined in Article 50 of the revised constitution which states, "Everyone has the right to health protection and care". Healthcare in Cuba is also free.

However, there is no right to privacy, or a patient's informed consent, or the right to protest or sue a doctor or clinic for malpractice.&lt;ref name="Hirschfeld"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.miscelaneasdecuba.net/media/pdf/Article-Hirschfeld-Press.pdf |title=Re-examining the Cuban Health Care System: Towards a Qualitative Critique |author=Katherine Hirschfeld |journal=Cuban Affairs |volume=2 |issue=3 |date=July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317225912/http://www.miscelaneasdecuba.net/media/pdf/Article-Hirschfeld-Press.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirschfeld-since1898"/&gt; Moreover, the patient does not have right to refuse treatment (for example, a [[Rastafarian]] cannot refuse an [[amputation]] on grounds that his religion forbids it.)&lt;ref name="Hirschfeld"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirschfeld-since1898"&gt;{{cite book|title=Health, politics, and revolution in Cuba since 1898|author=Katherine Hirschfeld}}{{full citation needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Cubans complain about politics in medical treatment and health care decision-making.&lt;ref name="Hirschfeld"/&gt;

After spending nine months in Cuban clinics, anthropologist Katherine Hirschfeld wrote "My increased awareness of Cuba’s criminalization of dissent raised a very provocative question: to what extent is the favorable international image of the Cuban health care system maintained by the state’s practice of suppressing dissent and covertly intimidating or imprisoning would-be critics?"&lt;ref name="Hirschfeld"/&gt;

Family doctors are expected to keep records of their patients' "political integration."&lt;ref name="Hirschfeld-since1898"/&gt; Epidemiological surveillance has become juxtaposed with political surveillance.&lt;ref name="Hirschfeld-since1898"/&gt;

=== Religious freedom ===
{{Main|Religion in Cuba}}
In the years following the [[Cuban Revolution]], the activities of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] were severely limited and in 1961 all property held by religious organizations was confiscated without compensation. Hundreds of members of the [[clergy]], including a [[bishop]], were permanently expelled from the nation. The Cuban leadership was officially [[atheism|atheist]] until 1992 when the [[Communist Party of Cuba|Communist Party]] agreed to allow religious followers to join the party. In 1998, [[Pope John Paul II]] visited the island and was allowed to conduct large outdoor [[mass (liturgy)|masses]] and
[[Visa (document)|visas]] were issued for nineteen foreign priests taking up residence in the country. In addition, other religious groups in Cuba such as the [[Jew]]ish community are now permitted to hold public services and to import religious materials and [[kosher]] food for [[Passover]], as well as to receive [[rabbi]]s and other religious visitors from abroad. In October 2008, Cuba marked the opening of a [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] Cathedral in Havana in a ceremony attended by Raúl Castro, Vice President [[Esteban Lazo]], Parliament leader [[Ricardo Alarcón]], and other figures.&lt;ref name="Orthodox Cathedral"&gt;"Raul Castro Attends Dedication of Russian Orthodox Cathedral in Havana". 20 Oct. 2008.

Women have relatively high representation in the country, with women holding 48.9% of the parliamentary seats in the [[Cuban National Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdr.undp.org/statistics/data/country_fact_sheets/cty_fs_CUB.html The Human Development Index] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909163705/http://hdr.undp.org/statistics/data/country_fact_sheets/cty_fs_CUB.html |date=2006-09-09 }} United Nations Development report.&lt;/ref&gt;

They are confined to narrow cells with no sunlight called "drawers" that have cement beds, a hole on the ground for their bodily needs, and are infested with a multitude of rodents, roaches, and other insects&amp;nbsp;... In these "drawers" the women remain weeks and months. When they scream in terror due to the darkness (blackouts are common) and the heat, they are injected sedatives that keep them half-drugged.|[[Juan Carlos González Leiva]], State Security Prison. Holguín, Cuba, October 2003.&lt;ref name="torture of women"/&gt;}}

The Cuban Foundation for Human Rights, directed by Juan Carlos González Leiva, reports torture of female prisoners in Cuba.&lt;ref name="torture of women"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cubanet.org/CNews/y03/nov03/10e8.htm |title=Cuba: Torture of women prisoners |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331143515/http://www.cubanet.org/CNews/y03/nov03/10e8.htm |archivedate=March 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About the torture in Cuba, in 2005 a group of culture personalities, including several [[Nobel Prize]] laureates, have signed an appeal on ''[[The Guardian]]'' in defense of Cuba, stating that "the government of the US has no moral authority to elect itself as the judge over human rights in Cuba, where there has not been a single case of disappearance, torture or extra-judicial execution since 1959, and where despite the economic blockade, there are levels of health, education and culture that are internationally recognised." The appeal is signed, for example, by [[Rigoberta Menchú Tum]], [[Adolfo Pérez Esquivel]], [[José Saramago]], [[Claudio Abbado]], [[Manu Chao]], [[Walter Salles]], [[Nadine Gordimer]], [[Harold Pinter]], [[Tariq Ali]], [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Danny Glover]], [[Ernesto Cardenal]], [[Alice Walker]], [[Ramsey Clark]] and [[Danielle Mitterrand]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2005/mar/26/guardianletters2 ''Human rights and Cuba''], The Guardian, March 26th, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Race relations==
{{Main|Racism in Cuba}}
Esteban Morales Dominguez has pointed to [[institutionalized racism]] in his book ''[[The Challenges of the Racial Problem in Cuba]]'' ({{lang|es|Fundación Fernando Ortiz}}). ''Racial Politics in Post-Revolutionary Cuba'' discusses the [[racial politics]] prevalent in communist Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Racial Politics in Post-Revolutionary|author=Cuba Mark Q. Sawyer University of California, Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Enrique Patterson]], writing in the ''[[Miami Herald]]'', describes race as a "social bomb" and he says, "If the Cuban government were to permit black Cubans to organize and raise their problems before [authorities]&amp;nbsp;... totalitarianism would fall".&lt;ref name="barrier"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/multimedia/news/afrolatin/part4/index.html|title=A barrier for Cuba's blacks|publisher=Miami Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carlos Moore (writer)|Carlos Moore]], who has authored extensive on the issue, says that "There is an unstated threat, blacks in Cuba know that whenever you raise race in Cuba, you go to jail. Therefore the struggle in Cuba is different. There cannot be a civil rights movement. You will have instantly 10,000 black people dead".&lt;ref name="barrier"/&gt; He says that a new generation of black Cubans are looking at politics in another way.&lt;ref name="barrier"/&gt;

[[Jorge Luis García Pérez]], a well-known Afro-Cuban human rights and democracy activist who was imprisoned for 17 years, in an interview with the Florida-based&lt;ref name="directorio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.directorio.org/mediacoverage/note.php?note_id=1546 |title=Cuban former political prisoner Jorge Luis García Perez Antúnez: I felt death was very close several times |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429182538/http://www.directorio.org/mediacoverage/note.php?note_id=1546 |archivedate=2009-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Directorio Democrático Cubano]]'' states "The authorities in my country have never tolerated that a black person oppose the revolution. During the trial, the color of my skin aggravated the situation. Later when I was mistreated in prison by guards, they always referred to me as being black".&lt;ref name="directorio"/&gt;

==Black Spring==
{{Main|Black Spring (Cuba)}}
In March 2003, the government of Cuba arrested dozens of people (including self-identified journalists and [[human rights activist]]s), and charged them with [[sedition]] due to their alleged cooperation with [[James Cason]], head of the [[United States Interests Section in Havana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hermanos.org/docs/tmh032103.html|title=Posted on Thu|author=|date=|website=www.hermanos.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accused were tried and sentenced to prison terms ranging from 15 to 28 years. In all, 75 people were given lengthy sentences averaging 17 years each. Among those sentenced were [[Raúl Rivero]], [[Marta Beatriz Roque]], and [[Oscar Elías Biscet]]. [[Amnesty International]] described the trials as "hasty and manifestly unfair."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://takeaction.amnestyusa.org/action/index.asp?step=2&amp;item=10678 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2004-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040427121421/http://takeaction.amnestyusa.org/action/index.asp?step=2 |archivedate=2004-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuban Foreign Minister [[Felipe Pérez Roque]] denied these accusations and responded: "Cuba has the right to defend itself and apply punishment just like other nations do, like the United States punishes those who cooperate with a foreign power to inflict damage on their people and territory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ain.cubaweb.cu/2004/marzo/25cmconferencia.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2004-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050108055623/http://www.ain.cubaweb.cu/2004/marzo/25cmconferencia.htm |archivedate=2005-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trial, evidence was presented that the defendants had received funds from the U.S. Interests Section. Cuban officials claim that the goal of this funding was to undermine the Cuban state, disrupt internal order, and damage the Cuban economy. For his part, Cason denies offering funds to anyone in Cuba.

On November 29, 2004, the Cuban government released three of those arrested in the March 2003: [[Oscar Espinosa Chepe]], [[Marcelo López]], and [[Margarito Broche]]. The action followed a meeting between the Spanish ambassador and Cuba's foreign minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4053581.stm | work=BBC News | title=Cuba frees political dissidents | date=November 29, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent days four more dissidents were released: [[Raúl Rivero]], [[Osvaldo Alfonso Valdés]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4055647.stm | work=BBC News | title=Cuba releases leading dissident | date=November 30, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edel José García]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4063617.stm | work=BBC News | title=Cuba frees sixth jailed dissident | date=December 2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jorge Olivera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4074191.stm | work=BBC News | title=Cuba frees dissident journalist | date=December 6, 2004 | first=Stephen | last=Gibbs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven other prisoners had previously been released for health reasons.

==Campaigns against homosexual behavior==
{{Main|LGBT rights in Cuba|Military Units to Aid Production}}

Thousands of [[homosexual]]s, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], conscientious objectors, and dissidents were forced to conduct their compulsory military service in the 1960s at UMAP camps, where they were subject to political "[[:wikt:reeducation|reeducation]]".&lt;ref name="Hirschfeld-since1898"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=World Police Encyclopedia|author=Dilip K. Das, Michael Palmiotto|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Military commanders brutalized the inmates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Machos, Maricones, and Gays|author=Ian Lumsden|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlos Alberto Montaner says "Camps of forced labour were instituted with all speed to "correct" such deviations&amp;nbsp;... Verbal and physical mistreatment, shaved heads, work from dawn to dusk, hammocks, dirt floors, scarce food&amp;nbsp;... The camps became increasingly crowded as the methods of arrest became more expedient".&lt;ref name="Hirschfeld-since1898"/&gt;

In the late 1960s, because of "revolutionary social hygiene", the Castro government claimed to cleanse the arts of "fraudulent sodomitic" writers and "sick effeminate" dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Machos, Maricones, and Gays|author=Ian Lumsden|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, men with long hair were locked up and their hair was cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Machos, Maricones, and Gays|author=Ian Lumsden|pages=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Castro is reported to once have asserted that, "in the country[side], there are no homosexuals", before claiming in 1992 that homosexuality is a "natural human tendency that must simply be respected".&lt;ref name="Tatchell"&gt;[http://www.galha.org/glh/213/cuba.html ''Gay Rights and Wrongs in Cuba,''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020821192118/http://www.galha.org/glh/213/cuba.html |date=2002-08-21 }}, Peter Tatchell (2002), published in the "Gay and Lesbian Humanist", Spring 2002. An earlier version was published in a slightly edited form as [https://www.theguardian.com/cuba/story/0,11983,712621,00.html The Defiant One], in [[The Guardian]], Friday Review, 8 June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Another source reports Castro as having denounced "maricones" ("[[Faggot (slang)|faggots]]") as "agents of imperialism".&lt;ref&gt;Llovio-Menéndez, José Luis. ''Insider: My Hidden Life as a Revolutionary in Cuba,'' (New York: Bantam Books, 1988), p. 156-158, 172-174.&lt;/ref&gt; Castro has also reportedly asserted that "homosexuals should not be allowed in positions where they are able to exert influence upon young people".&lt;ref&gt;Lockwood, Lee (1967), ''Castro's Cuba, Cuba's Fidel''. p.124. Revised edition (October 1990) {{ISBN|0-8133-1086-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent changes===
Cuba has taken some reforms in 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, Esteban, [http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/cgi-script/csArticles/articles/000021/002197.htm "Castro's niece fights for new revolution"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822022909/http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/cgi-script/csArticles/articles/000021/002197.htm |date=2006-08-22 }}, ''[[Reuters]]'', 2006-07-03&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Carlos Sanchez from the [[International Lesbian and Gay Association]] issued a report on the status of gay people in Cuba that claimed that the Cuban government no longer offers any legal punishment for its gay citizens, that there is a greater level of tolerance among Cubans for gay, bisexual, and transgender people, and that the Cuban government was open to endorsing a gay and lesbian rights plank at the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilga.org/news_results.asp?LanguageID%3D1%26FileCategory%3D10%26ZoneID%3D5%26FileID%3D26 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628192450/http://www.ilga.org/news_results.asp?LanguageID=1&amp;FileCategory=10&amp;ZoneID=5&amp;FileID=26 |archivedate=2006-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2005 [[sex reassignment surgery|sex reassignment surgeries]] for transgender individuals are free under law, and are paid for by the government.&lt;ref name="sexchange"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN06395397|title=Cuba approves sex change operations|publisher=Reuters|date=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=42693 |title=HEALTH-CUBA: Free Sex Change Operations Approved |publisher=Inter Press Service |date=June 6, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612094759/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=42693 |archivedate=2010-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[Havana]] now has a "lively and vibrant" gay and lesbian scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Havana rights |work=The Guardian |url=http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/calvin_tucker/2007/03/the_street_scene_was_entertain.html |date=2007-03-28 | location=London | first=Calvin | last=Tucker | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 interview with Mexican newspaper ''La Jornada'', the former president of Cuba, Fidel Castro, called the persecution of homosexuals whilst he was in power "a great injustice, great injustice!" Taking responsibility for the persecution, he said, "If anyone is responsible, it's me&amp;nbsp;... We had so many and such terrible problems, problems of life or death. In those moments I was not able to deal with that matter [of homosexuals]. I found myself immersed, principally, in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis|Crisis of October]], in the war, in policy questions." Castro personally believed that the negative treatment of gays in Cuba arose out of the country's pre-revolutionary attitudes toward homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==United Nations Human Rights Commission==
Since 1990, the United States has presented various resolutions to the annual [[UN Human Rights Commission]] criticizing Cuba’s human rights record. The proposals and subsequent diplomatic disagreements have been described as a "nearly annual ritual".&lt;ref name="Herald"&gt;[http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/human-rights/un-vote.htm U.N. panel condemns Cuba for rights abuses] Miami Herald April 19, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Long-term consensus between Latin American nations has not emerged.&lt;ref name = "coha-OAS-UNHRC"&gt;[http://www.coha.org/2005/05/02/cuba-the-un-human-rights-commission-and-the-oas-race/ Cuba, the U.N.

In the Americas, some governments back the criticism, others oppose it, seeing it as a cynical manipulation of a serious human rights issue in order to promote the isolation of the island and to justify the decades-old embargo.&lt;ref name = "coha-OAS-UNHRC"/&gt; European Union nations have universally voted against Cuba since 1990, though requests that the resolution should contain references to the negative effects of the economic embargo have been made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/human-rights/panel.htm U.N. rights panel votes to criticize Cuba] Miami Herald 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Incomes Data Services''' ('''IDS''') was a British research organisation dedicated to employment-related areas. It was acquired by Thomson Reuters in September 2005. It was dedicated to providing original research, analysis and training on pay benchmarking, pay settlements, HR policy and practice, pensions law and practice, and employment law. IDS published numerous journals and books, had several subscription websites, and undertook contract research. In December 2014 Thomson Reuters announced its decision to close the business from 31 March 2015, discontinuing the pay and HR products. 

At the same time it sold a licence to former employees to use the pay and data and software code to establish a new business called Incomes Data Research. 

The employment law products – namely [[IDS Employment Law Brief]], IDS Employment Law Handbooks and IDS Employment Law Cases – continue to be published by Thomson Reuters and are available online through the Westlaw service.

==History==
IDS was founded by David Layton&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/sep/29/david-layton-obituary&lt;/ref&gt; in 1966 with the aim of providing accurate and timely information which could be put to practical use by all those involved in determining pay, benefits and related employment policies in Britain. The company was the first to provide this information. As the employment law field became more complex IDS launched more information services covering new areas.

IDS was acquired by [[The Thomson Corporation|Thomson]] owned [[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]] in September 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Sweet+&amp;+Maxwell+acquires+Income+Data+Services.-a0139678257&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Gaza blockade}}
The '''Just Future for Palestine Flotilla''', also known as the '''JFP Flotilla''' and the '''2018 Gaza Freedom Flotilla''', was a 2018 campaign by the [[Freedom Flotilla Coalition]] to challenge the [[Israel]]i [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip (2007-present)|naval blockade]] of the [[Gaza Strip]]. The flotilla consisted of two ships ''Al Awda'' (''The Return'') and ''Freedom'' and two yachts ''Mairead'' and ''Falestine''.

==Preparing to sail to Gaza==

''Al Awda'' and ''Freedom'' sailed from [[Scandinavia]] to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] via European canals and river, while the ''Mairead'' and ''Falestine'' sailed alongside Africa along the Atlantic coast. In late July 2018, the flotilla converged in the Mediterranean near Sicily for the final leg of their journey to Gaza. Then due to mechanical and crewing issues, ''Mairead'' and ''Falestine'' were forced to pull out of the flotilla.&lt;ref name="JFP FAQs"&gt;{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions |url=https://jfp.freedomflotilla.org/about-just-future-palestine/faq |website=Right to a Just Future for Palestine |publisher=[[Freedom Flotilla Coalition]] |accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Legal Cases"&gt;{{cite web |title=Gaza Freedom Flotillas-Ships, Passengers &amp; Lawsuits Against the Israeli government |url=https://legalcasesagainstisraelattacksoncivilianboatstogaza.wordpress.com/2017/06/03/31-boats-challenge-israeli-naval-blockade-of-gaza/ |website=Legal Cases Against Israeli Attacks on Civilian Boats to Break the Illegal Israeli Blockade of Gaza |accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sailing to Gaza==

''Al Awda'' and ''Freedom'' left [[Palermo]], [[Sicily]] on 22 July 2018 for their final leg to Gaza. ''Al Awda'' had 22 on board including crew, medical volunteers, activist and journalist, ''Freedom'' had 12 crew medical volunteers, activist and journalist none of which Israel wished to reach Gaza, much of the ships cargo were reportedly 114 boxes of medical supplies including sterile gauze and sutures. 

On 29 July and 3 August 2018, both ships ''Al Awda'' and ''Freedom'' were boarded and seized by the [[Israeli Navy]]. All personnel were arrested, while some reported being [[Taser|tasered]], attacked and beaten by Israeli military personnel. Most of the participants were detained by the Israeli authorities and subsequently deported to their home countries.&lt;ref name="Legal Cases" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NZH 31 Jul 2018"&gt;{{cite news |title=Unite Union leader Mike Treen reportedly tasered repeatedly by Israeli military |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12098292 |accessdate=26 October 2018 |publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' |date=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TOI 4 Aug 2018"&gt;{{cite news |title=Israel seizes boat trying to break Gaza blockade |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-seizes-boat-trying-to-break-gaza-blockade/ |accessdate=26 October 2018 |publisher=''[[The Times of Israel]]'' |date=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals and objectives==
The Freedom Flotilla Coalition launched the Just Future for Palestine Flotilla to challenge the Israeli naval blockade of Gaza. This campaign emphasized Palestinian freedom of movement and [[Palestinian right of return|their "right of return]]." The Coalition also supports the goals of the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] campaign: 

# Ending its [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupation]] and colonization of all Arab lands and dismantling the [[Israeli West Bank barrier|Wall]];
# Recognizing the fundamental rights of the [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel]] to full equality; and
# Respecting, protecting and promoting the rights of [[Palestinian refugees]] to [[Palestinian right of return|return to their homes and properties]] as stipulated in [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194|UN Resolution 194]].&lt;ref name="JFP FAQs" /&gt;

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
'''{{Nihongo||起承転結|Kishōtenketsu}}''' describes the [[Dramatic structure|structure]] and development of classic [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[narrative]]s. It was originally used in Chinese poetry as a four-line composition, such as [[Qijue]], and is also referred to as {{Nihongo||起承転合|kishōtengō}}. The first [[Chinese character]] refers to the introduction or {{Nihongo||起句|kiku}}, the next: development, {{Nihongo||承句|shōku}}, the third: twist, {{Nihongo||転句|tenku}}, and the last character indicates conclusion or {{Nihongo||結句|kekku}}. 句 is the {{nihongo|[[phrase]]|句|ku}}, and {{nihongo||合|gō}} means "meeting point of ''introduction'' 起 and ''twist'' 転" for conclusion.

The following is an example of how this might be applied to a fairytale.
* {{nihongo|Introduction||ki}}: introducing [[Fictional character|characters]], era, and other important information for understanding the setting of the [[narrative|story]].
* {{nihongo|Development||shō}}: follows leads towards the twist in the story. Major changes do not occur. 
* {{nihongo|Twist||ten}}: the story turns toward an unexpected development. This is the crux of the story, the {{Nihongo||ヤマ|yama}} or climax. In case of several turns in the narrative, this is the biggest one. 
* {{nihongo|Conclusion||ketsu}}, also called {{Nihongo||落ち|ochi}} or ending, wraps up the story.

A specific example by the poet Sanyō Rai (頼山陽):
* {{nihongo|Introduction||ki}}: Daughters of Itoya, in the [[Honmachi]] of [[Osaka]].
* {{nihongo|Development||shō}}: The elder daughter is sixteen and the younger one is fourteen. 
* {{nihongo|Twist||ten}}: Throughout history, generals (''[[daimyō]]s'') killed the enemy with bows and arrows. 
* {{nihongo|Conclusion||ketsu}}: The daughters of Itoya kill with their eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Maynard, S. K. (1997). ''Japanese communication: Language and thought in context.'' Honolulu, HI: University of Hawai'i Press, 159-162.&lt;/ref&gt;
The first verse introduces the female characters of the story. The second verse gives more details about both. Verse three goes astray to an unrelated territory. Verse four explains: The main characters of the story seduce men with their eyes – killing them just as the, until now, unrelated generals who kill with bows and arrow – thus showing the relation of the daughters of Itoya and the killing generals.

The same pattern is used to arrange arguments:
* {{nihongo|Introduction||ki}}: In old times, copying information by hand was necessary. Some mistakes were made.
* {{nihongo|Development||shō}}: Copying machines made it possible to make quick and accurate copies. 
* {{nihongo|Twist||ten}}: Traveling by car saves time, but you don't get much impression of the local beauty. Walking makes it a lot easier to appreciate nature close up. 
* {{nihongo|Conclusion||ketsu}}: Although photocopying is easier, copying by hand is sometimes better, because the information stays in your memory longer and can be used later. 

In the structure of narrative and [[yonkoma]] [[manga]], and even for [[document]] and [[dissertation]], the style in ''kishōtenketsu'' applies to sentence or sentences, and even [[clause]] to [[Chapter (books)|chapter]] as well as the phrase for understandable introduction to conclusion.

The concept has also been used in [[game design]], particularly in [[Nintendo]]'s [[video game]]s, most notably ''[[Super Mario]]'' games such as ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' (2007) and ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'' (2013); their designers [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] and Koichi Hayashida are known to utilize this concept for their game designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-03-17-how-nintendos-best-mario-levels-were-structured-using-chinese-poetry | title=Nintendo's "kishōtenketsu" Mario level design philosophy explained | work=Eurogamer.net | date=2015-03-17 | accessdate=September 16, 2016 | author=Tom Phillips}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Maud''''', named for [[Maud of Wales|Queen Maud of Norway]], was a ship built for [[Roald Amundsen]] for his second expedition to the [[Arctic]]. Designed for his intended voyage through the [[Northern Sea Route|Northeast Passage]], the vessel was built in [[Asker]], a suburb of the capital, [[Oslo]].

''Maud'' was launched in June 1916&lt;ref name=june16&gt;[https://www.norwegianamerican.com/featured/unsinking-a-ship-maud-returns-home/ Unsinking a ship: Maud returns home - Roald Amundsen and Maud]&lt;/ref&gt; or 17 June 1917&lt;ref name=june17&gt;[http://www.maudreturnshome.no/project/ Maud Returns Home]&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Vollen, Akershus|Vollen]] and [[Ceremonial ship launching|ceremonially christened]] by Amundsen crushing a chunk of ice against her bow:
{{quote|It is not my intention to dishonor the glorious grape, but already now you shall get the taste of your real environment. For the ice you have been built, and in the ice you shall stay most of your life, and in the ice you shall solve your tasks. With the permission of our Queen, I christen you Maud|Roald Amundsen&lt;ref name=june16/&gt;}}

==Career and fate==
She lived up to her christening, as she remained in the ice until 2016. Whereas other vessels used in Amundsen's polar explorations, ''[[Gjøa]]'' and ''[[Fram]]'', have been preserved at the [[Norwegian Maritime Museum]], ''Maud'' had a more rugged fate. After sailing through the [[Northeast Passage]], which did not go as planned and took six years between 1918 and 1924, she ended up in [[Nome, Alaska]] and in August 1925 was sold on behalf of Amundsen's creditors in [[Seattle, Washington]].

The buyer was the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], which renamed her ''Baymaud''. She was to be used as a supply vessel for Company outposts in [[Northern Canada#Sub-divisions|Canada's western Arctic]]. Prior to her final voyage ''Baymaud'' was given a refit in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. (The work was supervised by Tom Hallidie, who later went on to design the RCMP vessel ''[[St. Roch (ship)|St. Roch]]'', based on ''Maud.'') In the winter of 1926 she was frozen into the ice at [[Cambridge Bay]], where she sank in 1930. The wreck lay just offshore, across the inlet from the community's former Hudson's Bay Company store. Nearby is the site of the former [[Cambridge Bay LORAN Tower]], built in 1947.

In 1990 the ship was sold by the Hudson's Bay Company to Asker with the expectation that she would be returned to the town. Although a Cultural Properties Export permit was issued, the price tag to repair and move the ship was 230 million [[Norwegian krone|kroner]] ($43,200,000) and the permit expired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://explorenorth.com/library/weekly/aa082799.htm Underwater Treasure of Cambridge Bay]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nunavut News/North Monday August 20, 2007 "Saving the Maud"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pwnhc.ca/research/archrep/archrep96/central.htm Cambridge Bay] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201230638/http://www.pwnhc.ca/research/archrep/archrep96/central.htm |date=2010-12-01 }}, Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 an Asker-based company, Tandberg Eiendom AS, in the project Maud Returns Home&lt;ref name="MaudReturnsHome"&gt;[http://www.maudreturnshome.no/ Maud Returns Home]&lt;/ref&gt; announced a plan to return ''Maud'' to Norway. They intend to build a museum in [[Vollen, Akershus|Vollen]] to house her, near where she was built and had purchased a barge to move her. Concern about the plan came from the community of Cambridge Bay, [[Parks Canada]], the [[Government of Nunavut]], the [[International Polar Heritage Committee]], and some people in her intended destination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/stories/article/16557_norway_wants_amundsens_maud_back_from_nunavut/ Norway wants Amundsen’s Maud back from Nunavut]&lt;/ref&gt; Initial refusal of a new export permit from the federal government, on the grounds of a lack of a full archeological study was later reversed on appeal in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/stories/article/65674Ottawa_nixes_export_permit_for_maud/ Ottawa nixes export permit for Maud]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MaudReturnsHome" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/norwegians-set-to-repatriate-maud-after-reversing-export-permit-refusal/article534560/ Norwegians set to repatriate ''Maud'' after reversing export permit refusal]&lt;/ref&gt; The salvage operation was under way in the summer of 2015, with a plan to return the hull to Norway in the summer of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maudreturnshome.no Project Website]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:AO7E8669.jpg|thumb|Maud at Vollen on 18 August 2018]]
On 31 July 2016 it was reported that the hull of ''Maud'' had been raised to the surface and placed on a barge in preparation for shipment to Norway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/north/the-maud-recovered-july-30-2016-1.3702513 CBC News: The Maud floats again: Norwegians bring long-sunken ship to surface]&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017 ''Maud'' began the journey back to Norway; she was towed through the [[Northwest Passage]]. In September 2017 she arrived in Greenland to stay for the winter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/maud-journey-home-cambridge-bay-norway-1.4266797 Ship that sank in Cambridge Bay 87 years ago finally on journey home to Norway]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/maud-to-return-to-norway-1.4242183 Cambridge Bay prepares to bid adieu to the Maud as Norwegian mayor visits community]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Maud'' arrived in Bergen on 6 August 2018, finally returning to Norway nearly a century after her departure with Amundsen. She was then towed along the Norwegian coast, and arrived at Vollen on 18 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maud Returns to Norway |url=https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/maud-returns-to-norway#gs.qHAlf3Y|publisher=The Maritime Executive|date=6 August 2018|accessdate=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9563">[[Image:Fyrkat hus stor.jpg|360px|right|thumb|A reconstructed Viking Age [[longhouse]] (28.5 metres long).]]In ancient [[Scandinavia]] and Germanic Europe a '''[[mead]] hall''' or '''[[Eating|feast]]ing hall''' was initially simply a large building with a single room. From the fifth century to early [[Middle Ages|medieval times]] such a building was the residence of a lord and his [[Affinity (medieval)|retainers]]. The mead hall was generally the great hall of the king.

==Etymology==
The old name of such halls may have been ''sal/salr'' and thus be present in old place names such as "Uppsala".&lt;ref&gt;Brink, Stefan, 1996. Political and Social Structures in Early Scandinavia. A Settlement-historical Pre-study of the Central Place.&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning has been preserved in German ''Saal'', Dutch ''zaal'', Frisian ''seal'',  Icelandic ''salur'', Swedish, Norwegian and Danish ''sal'', Lithuanian ''salė'', Finnish ''sali'', Estonian ''saal'', Izhorian ''saali'', French ''salle'', Italian/Polish/[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]/Spanish ''sala'' and Russian ''зал''(zal), (all meaning "hall" or "large room"). In Old English, ''sele'' and ''sæl'' were used.  These words are etymologically related to the modern English words ''salon'' and ''saloon''.

==Archaeology==
From around the year 500 C.E. up until the [[Christianization of Scandinavia]] (by the 13th century), these large halls were vital parts of the political center. They were  later superseded by medieval [[banquet hall]]s.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lejre Hall - AD 900.jpg|360px|thumb|The last hall at Lejre c. 900 CE]] --&gt;
Examples that have been excavated include:
*  Southwest of [[Lejre]], [[Denmark]]. Remains of a [[Viking]] hall complex were uncovered in 1986–88 by Tom Christensen of the Roskilde Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, Tom. "Lejre Beyond Legend — The Archaeological Evidence." ''Journal of Danish Archaeology 10'', 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Wood from the foundation was [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon-dated]] to circa 880. It was later found that this hall was built over an older hall which was itself dated to 680. In 2004–05, Christensen excavated a third hall located just north of the other two. This hall was built in the mid-6th century, exactly the time period of [[Beowulf]]. All three halls were about 50 meters long.&lt;ref name="Niles"&gt;Niles, John D., [http://www.historytoday.com/dt_main_allatonce.asp?gid=31861&amp;aid=&amp;tgid=&amp;amid=30234433&amp;g31861=x&amp;g31848=x&amp;g30026=x&amp;g20991=x&amp;g21010=x&amp;g19965=x&amp;g19963=x Beowulf’s Great Hall], ''History Today'', October 2006, '''56'''(10):40–44&lt;/ref&gt; Ongoing excavations have helped to establish the visual characteristics of the royal halls and their location in the landscape around Lejre, circa 500-1000 &lt;ref&gt;Medieval Histories 2016, No. 5[http://www.medievalhistories.com/wp-content/uploads/Medieval-News-2016-May-5-1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gudme]], Denmark. Two similar halls were excavated in 1993. Of the so-called "Gudme Kongehal" (King's hall) only the post holes were found. The larger of the two was 47 meters long and 8 meters wide. Gold items found near the site have been dated between 200 and 550. The [[Iron Age]] graveyards of Møllegårdsmarken and Brudager are close by. The halls may have been part of a regional religious and political center serving as royal feasting places with Lundeborg serving as harbor.&lt;ref&gt;Sørensen, Palle Østergaard, 1993. Hal på hal Skalk 1993:6. -1994. Gudmehallerne. Kongeligt byggeri fra jernalderen. Nationalmusees Arbejdsmark.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precursor==
The mead hall developed from European [[longhouse]]s:
*The unrelated [[Neolithic long house]] was introduced with the first farmers of central and western Europe around 5000 BC. Later longhouses did not come into use until more than a thousand years after the neolithic version ceased to be used.
*Germanic cattle-farmer longhouses emerged along the southwestern [[North Sea]] coast in the third or fourth century BC and are the predecessors of the German and Dutch ''Fachhallenhaus'' or [[Low German house]]. &lt;!--{BC houses can't be descendants of medieval houses! Probable simple typo, but needs a reference anyway if corrected.} They might have common ancestors with several other medieval house types such as the Scandinavian ''langhus'' and English, Welsh and Scottish longhouses.--&gt;

The possibly related medieval longhouse types of Europe of which some examples have survived are among others:
*The Scandinavian or [[Viking]] ''Langhus'', with the variants of traditional farm house such as excavated in [[Vorbasse]], a garrison/barracks type for warriors such as found at the [[Viking ring castles]] and the sophisticated large banquetting halls such as the mead halls.
*The southwest England variants in [[Dartmoor longhouse|Dartmoor]] and Wales
*The northwest England type in Cumbria
*The Scottish Longhouse, "[[blackhouse]]" or ''taighean dubha''
*The French ''longère'' or ''maison longue'' (only considering the types similar to the ones described in Dartmoor or Cumbria, possibly of Norman origin)

==Legends and history==
[[Image:Konung Ingjald Illråda bränner upp 6 Fylkiskonungar by Hugo Hamilton.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Ingjald burning his subordinate kings alive in his new feasting hall.]]
There are several accounts of large feasting halls constructed for important feasts when Scandinavian royalty was invited. According to a legend recorded by [[Snorri Sturluson]], in the ''[[Heimskringla]]'', the late 9th century [[Värmland]]ish chieftain Áki invited both the Norwegian king [[Harald Fairhair]] and the Swedish king [[Eric Eymundsson]], but had the Norwegian king stay in the newly constructed and sumptuous one, because he was the youngest one of the kings and the one who had the greatest prospects. The older Swedish king, on the other hand, had to stay in the old feasting hall. The Swedish king was so humiliated that he killed Áki.

The construction of new feasting halls could also be the preparation for treacherous murders of royalty. In the ''[[Ynglinga saga]]'' part of the ''Heimskringla'', Snorri relates how, in the 8th century, the legendary Swedish king [[Ingjald]] constructed a large feasting hall solely for the purpose of burning all his subordinate petty kings late at night when they were asleep. According to ''[[Yngvars saga víðförla]]'', the same ruse was done by the Swedish king [[Eric the Victorious]] and the Norwegian ruler [[Haakon Sigurdsson|Sigurd Jarl]], when they murdered Áki, a rebellious Swedish subking, at [[Gamla Uppsala]], in the late 10th century.

==Mythology==
From at least the tenth century onwards in [[Norse mythology]], there are numerous examples of halls where the dead may arrive. The best known example is [[Valhalla]], the hall where [[Odin]] receives half of the dead lost in battle. [[Freyja]], in turn, receives the other half at [[Sessrúmnir]].

The story of [[Beowulf]] includes a Mead-Hall called [[Heorot]] that was so big and had so much attendant laughter that the creature [[Grendel]] broke in and slaughtered the noisemakers.

==In fiction==
In fiction, mead halls usually appear in works that take place during the [[Middle Ages]].
* In [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[fictional universe]] of [[Middle-earth]], [[Meduseld]] (meaning mead hall in Old English) was the great ''Golden Hall'' built in [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]]. Meduseld was a large hall with a straw roof, which made it appear as if it were made out of [[gold]] when seen from far off. Its walls were richly decorated with tapestries depicting the history and legends of the [[Rohirrim]], and it served as a house for the King and his kin, a meeting hall for the King and his advisors, and a gathering hall. Also, a mead hall is the central location of [[Beorn]]'s home grounds where he serves mead and food to [[Bilbo Baggins]], the Dwarves and [[Gandalf]] in ''[[The Hobbit]]''.
* In [[The Elder Scrolls]] by [[Bethesda Softworks]], a race called the Nords, who resemble the Germanic peoples, build large mead halls, such as [[Jorrvaskr]] found in  [[Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]].
* In [[Shrek the Third]], Prince Charming visits a mead hall in order to gather some fairytale villains in order to do the "dirty work" with him in the film.
* The film, [[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]] has a brief scene with a mead hall.
* The film [[Beowulf]] mostly takes place in a mead hall.
* In the [[Harry Potter (franchise)|Harry Potter]] series, students and professors at Hogwarts drink butter-beer in a mead hall.
* In [[The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe]], Aslan had a ceremony with Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy becoming royalty based on their heroism in a mead hall.
* In Norwegian comedy television series [[Norsemen (TV series)]] (Vikingane in Norwegian), celebrations were frequently held in the village's mead hall.

'''Montagu Brownlow Parker, 5th Earl of Morley''' ([[:fr:Montagu Brownlow Parker|13 October 1878 – 28 April 1962]]) was a [[British people|British]] [[aristocrat]] and army officer, best known for being one of the first real-life "[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]".

Lord Morley's father was [[Albert Edmund Parker, 3rd Earl of Morley]].  He was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] and served as a [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] in the [[Grenadier Guards]] in the [[Second Boer War]] between 1900 and 1902, where he was wounded.  He was [[Aide-de-camp]] to GOC Germiston District, South Africa in 1902 and to GOC Home District in 1903.  He fought in the [[World War I|First World War]] during which he was [[mentioned in dispatches]] and decorated with the [[Croix de Guerre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepeerage.com/p8109.htm#i81082 The Peerage, entry for 5th Earl of Morley]&lt;/ref&gt;  He inherited the earldom and other titles in 1951 after the death of his older brother [[Edmund Parker, 4th Earl of Morley|Edmund Robert Parker, 4th Earl of Morley]].
 
Lord Morley led the "Parker Expedition", which carried out excavations searching for treasure from [[Solomon's Temple]] between 1909 and 1911. [[Neil Asher Silberman]] described the expedition as "Conceived in folly, but planned with cunning, the Parker Mission had come to Jerusalem with a single goal: to locate and unearth the fantastic treasure of Solomon’s Temple buried beneath the Temple Mount."&lt;ref name=Silberman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Silberman|first1=Neil Parker|title=In Search of Solomon’s Lost Treasures|journal=Biblical Archaeology Review|date=July–August 1980|volume=6|issue=4|url=http://members.bib-arch.org/publication.asp?PubID=BSBA&amp;Volume=6&amp;Issue=4&amp;ArticleID=3|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Morley died at the age of 83 in 1962.  He was unmarried and was succeeded in the earldom and other titles by his younger brother's son [[John Parker, 6th Earl of Morley|John St Aubyn Parker, 6th Earl of Morley]].

==Hughes Vincent Map==

The first expedition map documented the location of tunnels and artifacts discovered in and on the bedrock in the areas around [[Warren's Shaft|Warrens Shaft]] on the eastern slopes of the mountain above the Spring Citadel over the [[Gihon Spring]]. In recent years many of the map elements were verified by archaeologists [[Ronny Reich]] and [[Eli Shukron]].

'''Neurolaw''' is an emerging field of interdisciplinary study that explores the effects of discoveries in neuroscience on legal rules and standards. Drawing from [[neuroscience]], [[philosophy]], [[social psychology]], [[cognitive neuroscience]], and [[criminology]], neurolaw practitioners seek to address not only the descriptive and predictive issues of how neuroscience is and will be used in the legal system, but also the normative issues of how neuroscience should and should not be used.

The most prominent questions that have emerged from this exploration are as follows: To what extent can a tumor or brain injury alleviate criminal punishment? Can sentencing or rehabilitation regulations be influenced by neuroscience? Who is permitted access to images of a person's brain? Neuroscience is beginning to address these questions in its effort to understand human behavior, and will potentially shape future aspects of legal processes.&lt;ref name="Eagleman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eagleman|first=David M.|date=July–August 2011|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/print/2011/07/the-brain-on-trial/8520|title=The Brain on Trial|journal=The Atlantic}} [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/print/2011/07/the-brain-on-trial/8520]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Petoft"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petoft|first=Arian|title=Neurolaw: a brief introduction|publisher=''Iranian Journal of Neurology''|date=2015|url=http://ijnl.tums.ac.ir/index.php/ijnl/article/download/570/232|pmc=4395810|pmid=25874060|volume=14|journal=Iran J Neurol|pages=53–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New insights into the psychology and cognition of the brain have been made available by [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI). These new technologies were a break from the conventional and primitive views of the brain that have been prevalent in the legal system for centuries. Brain imaging has provided a much deeper insight into thought processes, and will have an effect on the [[law]] because it contests customary beliefs about mental development. Because the science is still developing and because there is substantial opportunity for misuse, the legal realm recognizes the need to proceed cautiously. Neurolaw proponents are quickly finding means to apply neuroscience to a variety of different contexts. For example, intellectual property could be better evaluated through neuroscience. Major areas of current research include applications in the courtroom, how neuroscience can and should be used legally, and how the law is created and applied.&lt;ref name="Petoft-2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petoft|first=Arian|title=Toward Human Behavior Sciences from the Perspective of Neurolaw|publisher=''International Journal of Public Mental Health and Neurosciences''|date=2015|url=http://sarvasumana.in/files/26.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodenough"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodenough|first=Oliver R. and Macaela Tucker|date=December 2010| url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.093008.131523|title=Law and Cognitive Neuroscience|journal=Annual Review of Law and Social Science|publisher=Annual Review|volume=6|pages=61–92|doi=10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.093008.131523|last2=Tucker|first2=Micaela}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Neuroscience and the law have interacted over a long history, but interest spiked in the late 1990s. After the term neurolaw was first coined by Sherrod J. Taylor in 1991,&lt;ref name="taylor-erickson"/&gt; scholars from both fields began to network through presentations and dialogs. This led to an increasing pull to publish books, articles, and other literature. The Gruter Institute for Law and Behavioral Research and the Dana Foundation were the first groups to provide funding for the new interdisciplinary field. Parallel to the expansion of neurolaw, an emergence of ethics specifically regarding neuroscience was developing as well. The intersection of neurolaw and ethics was able to be better scrutinized by the initiation of the Law and Neuroscience Project in 2007.&lt;ref name="Goodenough" /&gt; The MacArthur Foundation launched Phase I of its project through a $10 million grant in hope of integrating the two fields. The initiative sustained forty projects addressing a multitude of issues, including experimental and theoretical data that will provide further evidence as to how neuroscience may eventually shape the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawneuro.org/About-Us/History.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130024912/http://www.lawneuro.org/About-Us/History.aspx|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-01-30|title=History: Phase I|publisher=The Law &amp; Neuroscience Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new field of study has also piqued the interests of several universities. Baylor College of Medicine's Initiative on Neuroscience and the Law’s research seeks to research, educate, and make policy change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neulaw.org/goals|title=Goals of the Initiative|publisher=Baylor College of Medicine|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514220120/http://www.neulaw.org/goals|archivedate=2011-05-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Pennsylvania’s Center for Neuroscience and Society began in July 2009, and is working towards confronting the social, legal, and ethical inferences of neuroscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neuroethics.upenn.edu/|title=Center for Neuroscience and Society|publisher=University of Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurocriminology==

The term neurolaw was first used in practice by the neuroscientist and attorney J. Sherrod Taylor in 1991.&lt;ref name="taylor-erickson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=J. Sherrod |author2=J. Anderson Harp |author3=Tyron Elliott|date=Oct 1991|title=Neuropsychologists and Neurolawyers|journal=Neuropsychology|volume=5|issue=4|pages=293–305|doi=10.1037/0894-4105.5.4.293}}  See also: {{cite journal|last=Erickson|first=Steven K.|year=2010|ssrn=1472245|title=Blaming the Brain|journal=Minnesota Journal of Law, Science &amp; Technology|publisher=University of Missouri School of Law Legal Studies|volume=11|issue=2009–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor's book, ''Neurolaw: Brain and Spinal Cord Injury'' (1997), was used as a resource for attorneys to properly introduce medical jargon into the courtroom and to further develop the implications of neuroscience on litigation. In addition, Taylor explained the consequences of ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals]]''.&lt;ref name="Juliano"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Juliano|first=Elizabeth|author2=James R. Fell |date=April 1998|url=http://www.medicineforthedefense.com/MAIN/articles/newspubs-a-07.aspx|title=Book Review: Neurolaw: Brain and Spinal Cord Injuries|journal=The MIM Reporter|publisher= Litigation Management, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This United States Supreme Court case resulted in what is now known as [[Daubert Standard]], which sets rules regarding the use of scientific evidence in the courtroom.

===Crime prediction===

[[Psychological testing|Behavioral testing]] and [[neuroimaging]] evidence offer a potentially accurate method of predicting human behavior. This advancement would be beneficial particularly for determining guilty criminal sentences or discerning which criminals deserve to be released on parole or detained in jail due to the  possibility of future offenses. Not only could it aid in the process of [[recidivism]], it could also show an indication of the need for personal rehabilitation. In light of this information and its potential applications, the legal system seeks to create a balance between just punishment and penalties based on the ability to predict additional criminal activity.&lt;ref name="Eagleman"/&gt;

===Insanity defense===

The tendency of the United States criminal justice system has been to limit the degree to which one can claim innocence based on [[mental illness]]. During the middle of the 20th century, many courts through the [[Durham rule|Durham Rules]] and the American Law Institute Model Penal Code, among others, had regarded impaired volition as legitimate grounds for the [[insanity defense]]. However, when [[John Hinckley]] was acquitted due to insanity, a reversal of opinion occurred, which then spurred a narrowing definition of mental illness. Decisions became increasingly based on the [[M’Naghten Rules]], which asserted that unless one was able to prove that a mental illness kept him or her from knowing that the act was wrong, or knowing the disposition of the criminal act, one would not be able to be tried as mentally handicapped. Contemporary research conducted on the prefrontal cortex has criticized this standpoint because it considers impaired volition as a factor. Many courts are now considering "irresistible impulse" as legitimate grounds for mental illness.&lt;ref name="Sapolsky"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sapolsky|first=Robert M.|authorlink=Robert Sapolsky|date=2004-11-26|url=http://neuro.bcm.edu/eagleman/neurolaw/papers/%5BSapolsky%5DFrontalCortexandJustice2004.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614055055/http://neuro.bcm.edu/eagleman/neurolaw/papers/%5BSapolsky%5DFrontalCortexandJustice2004.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-06-14|title=The frontal cortex and the criminal justice system|journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B|publisher=The Royal Society|volume=359|pages=1787–1796|doi=10.1098/rstb.2004.1547|issue=1451|pmid=15590619|pmc=1693445}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the factors neuroscience has added to the insanity defense is the claim that the brain “made someone do it.” In these cases, the argument is based on an understanding that decisions are made before the person is able to consciously realize what is happening. More research on control and inhibition mechanisms will allow further modifications to the insanity defense.&lt;ref name="Goodenough" /&gt; Impaired functioning of the [[prefrontal cortex|PFC]] is evidence proving that a prime factor in mental illness is an issue of volition. Many experiments using MRI show that one of the functions of the PFC is to bias a person towards taking the more difficult action. This action is representative of a long-term reward, and it is competing with an action that will lead to immediate satisfaction. It is responsible for moral reasoning, including regret. Individual variations that impair the PFC are extremely detrimental to the decision-making process, and give an individual a greater likelihood in a committing a crime he or she would have otherwise not committed.&lt;ref name="Sapolsky"/&gt;

===Brain death===

Injuries or illnesses that lead to a [[persistent vegetative state]] have come to the forefront of many ethical, legal, and scientific issues regarding brain death.&lt;ref name="Eagleman2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eagleman|first=David M.|date=March–April 2008|url=http://www.thehoustonlawyer.com/aa_mar08/page36.htm|title=Neuroscience and the Law|journal=The Houston Lawyer|publisher=Houston Bar Association|volume=16|issue=6|pages=36–40}} [http://neuro.bcm.edu/eagleman/papers/Eagleman_NeuroscienceandLaw_HoustonLawyer.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a difficult subject to know when someone is beyond hope for recovery, as well as to decide who has the right to make the decision of when death is most appropriate. Research to determine a person’s cognitive state has helped develop an understanding of the vegetative state. While a person can be awake and conscious, he or she may not show any signs of awareness or recognition to external stimulation. In 2005, research was conducted on a 23-year-old female who suffered severe head trauma due to an automobile accident. The woman was diagnosed to be in a vegetative state; after five months she continued to be unresponsive, but did show normal sleep and wake cycles.  Using fMRI technology, researchers concluded that she was able to understand external stimuli, showing a response via activity in specific regions of the brain. For example, there was increased activity in the middle and superior temporal gyri similar to activity exhibited by control subjects. This positive response reveals potential for medical imaging to be used to understand the implications of brain death, and to help answer legal, scientific, and ethical questions pertaining to brain death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Owen|date=2006-09-08|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/313/5792/1402.full|title=Detecting Awareness in the Vegetative State|journal=Science|publisher=AAAS|volume=313|issue=5792|doi=10.1126/science.1130197|page=1402|pmid=16959998|display-authors=1|last2=Coleman|first2=MR|last3=Boly|first3=M|last4=Davis|first4=MH|last5=Laureys|first5=S|last6=Pickard|first6=JD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nootropics==

In addition to questions involving how neuroscience should influence criminal and civil law, neurolaw also encompasses ethical questions regarding [[nootropics]], more commonly known as mind-enhancing drugs. A plethora of drugs are already known to cause a variety of effects on the brain, for example, the stimulatory action of [[caffeine]]. Similarly, current research suggests that the future may hold even more powerful medications that can specifically target and alter brain function.&lt;ref name="Lanni"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lanni|first=Cristina|author2=Silvia C.

Analogous to the controversy over the use of [[anabolic steroids]] in professional sports, many high schools and universities are wary of students eventually using nootropics to artificially boost academic performance.

Some of the questions raised regarding the use of nootropics include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sahakian|first=Barbara|author2=Sharon Morein-Zamir |date=2007-12-20|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v450/n7173/full/4501157a.html|title=Professor's little helper|journal=Nature|volume=450|pages=1157–1159|doi=10.1038/4501157a|issue=7173|pmid=18097378}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* How will these enhancers affect performance gaps between family income classes?
* Will it become necessary to use an enhancing drug simply to remain competitive in society?
* How does society distinguish between what is an acceptable substance (e.g. caffeine) and an unacceptable substance to alter one's mind?
* Do people have the right to experiment with substances to modify their own cognition?

Scientists and ethicists have attempted to answer these questions while analyzing the overall effect on society. It is largely accepted that mind-enhancing drugs are acceptable for use with patients facing cognitive disorders, as in a case of prescribing [[Adderall]] to children and adults with [[ADHD]]. In contrast, Adderall and [[Ritalin]] have become popular black-market drugs, most notably on college campuses. Students often use them to maintain focus when struggling to complete large amounts of schoolwork.&lt;ref name="Talbot"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Talbot|first=Margaret|date=2009-04-27|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/04/27/090427fa_fact_talbot?currentPage=all|title=Brain Gain|journal=The New Yorker|publisher=Condé Nast Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==

Much of neurolaw depends on state-of-the-art medical technology that has been adapted to a new role in the legal system. Among the most prominent technologies and disciplines are [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[positron emission tomography]] (PET scan), [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), and [[epigenetics]]. MRI and fMRI are particularly important because they allow detailed [[Brain mapping|mapping of the human brain]], potentially allowing technicians to visualize another person's thoughts. FMRI, a derivative of MRI, allows for oxygen-specific mapping to view the most active areas of a brain at a specific moment. Combined with the knowledge of how the brain works in different situations (lying, remembering, etc.), there is the potential to use functional neuroimaging evidence as a modern form of [[lie detection]]. Similarly, PET scans use a radioactive tracer injected into the body to analyze brain tissue.&lt;ref name="Eagleman2008"/&gt;

===Lie detection===

[[Image:Brianlies.png|thumb|500px|right|The diagram above is an overview of the varying patterns of brain activity detected by fMRI. Yellow highlighted regions are where there is the most activity occurring. TR and CR levels represent "telling the truth." LT signals indicate a subject is withholding information. LN signals indicate a subject is making up information.]]
In regard to neuroscience as a form of lie-detection, specific regions of the brain have been analyzed in order to uncover patterns of truth telling, deception, and false memory. Notably, an important obstacle to any form of lie detection is when subjects inadvertently recall [[source-monitoring error|false memories]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} This is induced experimentally by presenting subjects a list of semantically related words. While they believe their responses to be true, their recollections are in fact false. For instance, reading a long list of words including "moon," "sun," and "Mars," may cause a subject to incorrectly believe the word "Earth" to have been listed, even if it was not. This is a normal psychological occurrence, but presents numerous problems to jury attempting to sort out the facts of a case. Indeed, researchers have attempted to distinguish genuine truths from "false truths." Subjects are subsequently quizzed on the word list while specific regions of the brain are analyzed for activity. For instance, the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] has been shown to activate when subjects are pretending to know information which they do not know, in contrast to truth telling and false recognition. Alternatively, the [[hippocampus|right anterior hippocampus]] activates when a subject presents false recognition in contrast to lying or accurately telling a truth. However, there remain limitations to how much brain imaging can distinguish between the many forms of truths and deceptions. For instance, future research hopes to uncover patterns that differentiate whether someone has genuinely forgotten an experience in contrast to the active choice to withhold information.&lt;ref name="Abe"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abe|first=Nobuhito|date=December 2008|url=http://neulaw.org/papers/%5BAbe2008%5DCorrelatesofFalseMemory.pdf|title=Neural Correlates of True Memory, False Memory, and Deception|journal=Cerebral Cortex|volume=18|pages=2817|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhn037|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114004801/http://neulaw.org/papers/%5BAbe2008%5DCorrelatesofFalseMemory.pdf|archivedate=2011-01-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===

The Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics (SCBE) specifically analyzes the contribution of fMRI to legal, ethical, and social challenges so that their conclusions may offer a liable transfer of fMRI information to policy recommendations and the clinical realm. The research will focus on identifying emerging trends of emotion, moral judgment, and other complex human behaviors. With the information that the researchers obtain, an advisory board will compile a list of guidelines to interpret the results. In analyzing the use of fMRIs, they will assess the risks and accuracy of using these machines to quantitatively detect mental illness. The [[Major Depressive Disorder]] is used as their main experimental model.&lt;ref name="Illes"&gt;{{cite web|author=Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics|year=2011|url=http://bioethics.stanford.edu/research/projects/illes_advanced_neuro.html|title=Advancing Neuroimaging: Ethical, Legal and Social Issues|publisher=Stanford School of Medicine|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002041436/http://bioethics.stanford.edu/research/projects/illes_advanced_neuro.html|archivedate=2011-10-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===

The use of neuroimaging in the legal system creates a very divided critical audience; many argue for its potential, while others argue it will not accurately replace human investigations to verify criminal decision making processes. Neuroimaging is inadequately understood; the multiple variables it displays, including [[medication]], [[nutrition]], and [[hormones]] create an image that is very complex and often impossible to interpret accurately. Other critics highlight that the image derived from the technology does not display the brain’s [[intentionality]] during the illegal act. Functional neuroimaging was not intended to calculate volition, and while it may offer insight into the processes that cause behavior, it is debated whether or not the images can objectively narrow in on human reason.&lt;ref name="Aggarwal"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aggarwal|first=Neil K.|year=2009|url=http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/reprint/37/2/239.pdf|title=Neuroimaging, Culture, and Forensic Psychiatry|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law|publisher=The American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law|volume=37|issue=2|pages=239–244|pmid=19535562}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also many worries about privacy as well.

Controversy over the science behind fMRI lie detection entered a Federal courtroom in 2010 with a [[Daubert]] hearing concerning its admissibility in a criminal trial but was excluded based on the state of the supporting science. A 2012 appeal of the case failed to change the court's view of the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Appeal from the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee at Jackson|url=http://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/12a0312p-06.pdf|website=United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortcomings in the laboratory research that forms the basis of fMRI lie detection, and absence of validation in more complex contexts outside of the laboratory, leave serious open questions about the suitability of the method for legal or other high-stakes uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Martha J.|last2=Hutchinson|first2=Benjamin|last3=Phelps|first3=Elizabeth A.|last4=Wagner|first4=Anthony D.|title=Functional MRI-based lie detection: scientific and societal challenges|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|date=20 January 2014|volume=15|pages=123–131|doi=10.1038/nrn3665|url=http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v15/n2/full/nrn3665.html|pmc=3867253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application in practice==

Neurolaw has already been applied to various situations throughout the United States and other countries. Two companies, [[No Lie MRI]] and Cephos Corp, both offer lie-detection services using fMRI. Advertising to lawyers, prosecutors, and other firms, they attempt to provide a twenty-first century version of the traditional [[polygraph]].&lt;ref name="Chen"/&gt; Because of variations among individuals’ responses however, the technology is not fool proof and many are skeptical of its uses. Nevertheless, It is often considered to be a more advanced technique than the polygraph test. The United States rarely allows evidence to be accepted in the court of law; and in response to worries of its scientific validity, judges have so far veered away from allowing Cephos and No Lie MRI tests into the courtroom.&lt;ref name="Goodenough" /&gt;

===Criminal law===
In Mumbai, India, the legal system has taken a more rapid approach in applying neuroscience, and has already incorporated it into criminal convictions. In 2008, an Indian woman was convicted of murder based on strong [[circumstantial evidence]], including a brain scan that suggested her guilt. This conviction was sharply criticized by Hank Greely, a professor of law at Stanford University. Greely contested the scan based on evidence produced by a [[Brain Electrical Oscillation Signature Profiling]] test (BEOSP).  No scientific peer-review studies had ever been published demonstrating the efficacy of BEOS, raising questions about its reliability in such an important decision.&lt;ref name="Chen"/&gt;

In the United States, convicts have used introduced brain scan results during the sentencing phase of trials. Because the court system allows nearly any mitigating evidence during sentencing, brain scans have not faced as many hurdles for this application. In two instances occurring in California and New York, defendants were able to reduce their sentence of first-degree murder to manslaughter. Each presented brain scans suggesting hindered neurological function hoping to mitigate their responsibility in the crime.&lt;ref name="Chen"/&gt; Brain images were also used in the case of Harrington v. State of Iowa in 2003 as evidence for the defense.&lt;ref name="Goodenough" /&gt;

===Government and military===
The United States Military has become increasingly interested in the possibilities made available by neuroscience. In an effort to combat terrorism, officials hope to use modern technologies for a variety of purposes. Brain imaging may help to distinguish between enemy combatants from those who pose no risk. Similarly, officials can help determine the mental stability of their own soldiers. Nootropic drugs could also be used to enhance the focus and memories of soldiers, allowing for better recognition of dangers and improved performance. However, this has led to questions regarding the personal privacy of soldiers and detainees. While the general population generally has the right to refuse medication, soldiers may eventually face compulsory medication to benefit the overall mission.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Additionally, questions regarding the accuracy of brain imaging arise when testing detainees for concealed information. Although the civilian court system is reluctant to use unproven technologies, the military's reliance on them may generate controversy over the possible innocence or guilt of enemy combatants.&lt;ref name="Begley"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Begley|first=Sharon|date=2006-12-15|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116613325554750607|title=A Pentagon Agency Is Looking at Brains -- And Raising Eyebrows|journal=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of novel technological innovations and information in the field of neuroscience, the military has begun to anticipate specific uses for such neuroscience research. However, these approaches, which can alter human cognitive abilities as well as infringe on an individual’s right to the privacy of his or her own thoughts, are still innovatory and early in development. Therefore, the precise effects and potential influence are yet to be well explained.&lt;ref name="Huang"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huang|first=Jonathan Y.|author2=Margaret E. Kosal |date=2008-06-20|url=http://thebulletin.org/security-impact-neurosciences|title=The security impact of the neurosciences|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt; Present day treaties, such as the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights and the Chemical Weapons Conventions, address only the use of certain chemical agents and therefore cannot adequately regulate the fast-paced evolution of recent advancements in cognitive science research.&lt;ref name="Huang"/&gt; Due to this ambiguity and the potential of technology misuse, it has become increasingly pressing to address the regulations needed for controlling the extent to which neuroscience research can be employed in military functions.

Another area of interest to the military is the use of human enhancement drugs. [[DARPA]] (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), a Pentagon branch of the United States Department of Defense, is often perceived to be responsible for military research and development of technology. A current operation of DARPA is named the Preventing Sleep Deprivation Program, which conducts research on the molecular processes and changes in the brain involved with sleep deprivation, with the ultimate purpose to maximize warfighters’ cognitive abilities, even with sleep deprivation.&lt;ref name="Clancy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Frank|date=2006-01-17|url=http://journals.lww.com/neurotodayonline/Fulltext/2006/01170/At_Military_s_Behest,_Darpa_Uses_Neuroscience_To.4.aspx|title=At Military's Behest, Darpa Uses Neuroscience To Harness Brain Power|journal=Neurology Today|publisher=American Academy of Neurology|volume=6|issue=2|pages=4, 8–10|doi=10.1097/00132985-200601170-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of this research, sleep deprivation prevention drugs such as Modafinil and Ampakine CX717 have increased in significance. However, because these chemical drugs directly affect natural chemical reactions and receptors in the body, the ethics of their use as well as safety are in question.&lt;ref name="Kluger"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kluger|first=Jeffrey|date=2009-03-17|url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1885825,00.html|title=Safety Concerns Raised Over Popular Wakefulness Drug|journal=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cautions and concerns==
Neuroscience is a complex field and one not well understood by the general public. Although experts recognize the possibilities and drawbacks of brain imaging relatively well, others may be either too confident in or completely reject the field. Judges must decide on the validity of various neurological evidence so it can enter the courtroom, and juries must not be too willing to place all faith in neuroscience.&lt;ref name="Petoft-3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petoft|first=Arian|title=Controversial Brain Imaging as a Terrorism Emergency Measure in Neurolaw Discourse|publisher=''Neurology &amp; Neurotherapy Journal''|date=2017|url=https://medwinpublishers.com/NNOAJ/NNOAJ16000118.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Ingfei|date=2009-10-21|url=http://stanfordlawyer.law.stanford.edu/2009/10/neurolaw/|title=Neurolaw|journal=Stanford Lawyer|publisher=Stanford School of Law|issue=81|volume=44|issn=0585-0576|pages=14–21}} [http://www.law.stanford.edu/publications/stanford_lawyer/issues/81/pdfs/sls81-articles.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to glorified depictions of forensics labs on popular television shows, brain imaging has faced criticism for having a "[[CSI effect]]". Society may soon develop a false sense of what is possible with contemporary technologies, and may not understand the value of evidence being presented.&lt;ref name="Merikangas"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merikangas|first=James R.|year=2008|url=http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/content/full/36/4/499|title=Commentary: Functional MRI Lie Detection|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law|publisher=American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law|volume=36|issue=4|pages=499–501|pmid=19092067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American professor of law and psychology [[Stephen J. Morse]] described the abuse of neuroscience in courtrooms with a pseudo-disease he called "Brain Overclaim Syndrome".  He focused on claims made about people having [[diminished responsibility]] or no responsibility for their actions because those actions were caused by "the brain", in situations where the science could not support such causal claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morse|first1=Stephen J.|title=Brain Overclaim Syndrome and Criminal Responsibility: A Diagnostic Note|journal=Ohio State Journal of Criminal Law|date=2006|volume=3|page=397|url=http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/osjcl/Articles/Volume3_2/Symposium/Morse-PDF-04-05-06.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buchen|first1=L|title=Science in court: Arrested development.|journal=Nature|date=18 April 2012|volume=484|issue=7394|pages=304-6|doi=10.1038/484304a|pmid=22517146|url=https://www.nature.com/polopoly_fs/1.10456!/menu/main/topColumns/topLeftColumn/pdf/484304a.pdf?origin=ppub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Omnilateralism''' (from ''[[wiktionary:omnibus|omnibus]]'' in [[Latin]] ''"for all and by all"'') is used as a term in [[international relations]] in order to distinguish movements towards comprehensive [[global governance]] from the current [[multilateralism|multilateral]] institutions that have evolved since the [[Congress of Vienna]].

==History==
Historically, the Prussian philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] defined omnilateral in the ''Science of Right'', the first part of the [[Metaphysics of Morals]] (1797), as ''"derived from the particular wills of all the individuals"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophy.eserver.org/kant/science-of-right.txt |title= The Science of Right, 1790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Omnilateralism as a political philosophy==
While [[multilateralism]] refers only to multiple countries working in concert on a given issue, omnilateralism connotes a wider participation by all and a broader purpose for all. Hence, it includes not only nations in the [[United Nations]], but also [[Non-governmental organization|Non-Governmental Organisations]] as well as private actors and [[Civil society]] at large that can together contribute to the advancement of the [[Common good|common global good]].

The term omnilateralism is in particular used in the context of issues that can be solved neither [[Unilateralism|unilaterally]] by one country, nor [[Bilateralism|bilaterally]] between two countries, or [[Plurilateral agreement|plurilaterally]] at a regional level, like the [[European Union]], or multilaterally by institutions such as the [[G-20 major economies|G20]] or the United Nations, since they do not encompass all actors concerned.

==Omnilateral issues==
Typical issues of omnilateralism relate to the [[Global warming|global environment]], avoidance of [[The Clash of Civilizations|conflicts of civilisations]], [[multiculturalism]] and [[Minority group|minorities]].

'''''Op. cit.''''' is an abbreviation of the [[Latin phrase]] ''{{lang|la|opus citatum}}'',&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th"&gt;{{Chicago 16th |pp=670 |at=14.31 |title=‘''Op. cit.''’ and ‘''loc. cit.''’ |accessdate=2012-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "the work cited".&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th" /&gt;

==Overview==
The abbreviation is used in an [[endnote]] or [[footnote]] to refer the reader to a previously cited work, standing in for repetition of the full title of the work.&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th" /&gt; ''Op. cit.'' thus refers the reader to the [[bibliography]], where the full citation of the work can be found, or to a full citation given in a previous footnote. ''Op. cit.'' should never therefore be used on its own, which would be meaningless, but most often with the author's surname,&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th" /&gt; or another brief clue as to which work is referred to. For example, given a work called ''The World of Salamanders'' (1999) by Jane Q. Smith, the style would typically be "Smith ''op. cit.''", usually followed by a page number, to refer the reader to a previous full citation of this work (or with further clarification such as "Smith 1999, ''op. cit.''" or "Smith, ''World of Salamanders'', ''op. cit.''", if two sources by that author are cited).  Given names or initials are not needed unless the work cites two authors with the same surname, as the whole purpose of using ''op. cit.'' is economy of text.  For works without an individually named author, the title can be used, e.g. "''CIA World Fact Book'', ''op. cit.''"  As usual with foreign words and phrases, ''op. cit.'' is typically given in italics.  The variant ''[[Loc. cit.]]'', an abbreviation of the Latin phrase ''loco citato'' meaning "in the place cited",&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th" /&gt; has been used for the same purpose but also indicating the same page not simply the same work; it is now rarely used or recognized.

The ''[[Chicago Manual of Style]]'', 16th edition, claims that ''op. cit.'' and ''loc. cit.'' are "rightly falling into disuse", and "instead uses the short-title form",&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th" /&gt; e.g. the form ''World of Salamanders'', to use the example above.&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th 2"&gt;''Chicago'' (2011), "14.28: Short form for titles", pp.&amp;nbsp;668&amp;ndash;669.&lt;/ref&gt;  Various different styles call for other alternatives, such as a reference to the author's surname and publication year, e.g. "Smith 1999".&lt;!--Is this MLA style? A citation for it needs to be added from a major style guide, common as it may be.--&gt;

''Op. cit'' is contrasted with ''[[ibid.]]'', an abbreviation of the Latin adverb ''ibidem'', meaning "in the same place; in that very place"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cassell's Latin Dictionary |author=Marchant and Charles, eds. |edition=260th |chapter=ibidem}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th 3"&gt;''Chicago'' (2011), "14.29: ‘''Ibid.''’", p. 669.&lt;/ref&gt; which refers the reader to the title of the work in the preceding footnote. The easily confused ''[[idem]]'' (sometimes abbreviated ''id.''), the Latin definitive pronoun meaning "the same"&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th 4"&gt;''Chicago'' (2011), "14.30: ‘''Idem''’", pp.&amp;nbsp;669&amp;ndash;630.&lt;/ref&gt; is also used on occasion (especially in legal writing) within footnotes, and is a stand-in for the last-cited author, rather than title.&lt;ref name="Chicago 16th 4" /&gt; The Latin adverb ''[[supra (grammar)|supra]]'', meaning "above" means simply "see above" and can therefore be somewhat imprecise.

==Examples==
Footnotes 9 to 15:
* (9) R. Millan, ''Art of Latin Grammar'' (Academic: New York, 1997), p. 23.
* (10) G. Wiki, ''Language and Its Uses'' (Blah Ltd.: London, 2000), p. 217.
* (11) G. Wiki, ''Towards a More Perfect Speech'' (Blah Ltd.: London, 2003), p. 354.
* (12) G. Wiki, ''I Say, You Say'' (Blah Ltd.: London, 2003), p. 35.

* (14) Wiki 2000, ''op. cit.'', p. 66.
* (15) Wiki, ''I Say, You Say op. cit.'', p. 4.

Reference number 13 refers to the last cited work by the author R. Millan, and hence, it is the same as in number 9 (R. Millan, ''Art of Latin Grammar''), although the page referred to is different. Reference number 14 refers to reference number 10, ''Language and Its Uses'' (because the work was published in 2000), page 66. Reference number 15 refers to reference number 12: there are two works by Wiki published in 2003 so you must use the title.

For the short-title form:
* (9) R. Millan, ''Art of Latin Grammar'' (Academic: New York, 1997), p. 23.
* (10) G. Wiki, ''Language and Its Uses'' (Blah Ltd.: London, 2000), p. 217.

* (13) ''Art of Latin Grammar'', p. 5.
* (14) ''Language and Its Uses'', p. 66.
* (15) ''I Say, You Say'', p. 4.

This is exactly the same as the long form above.

'''Рatchwork religion''' — term in the [[sociology of religion]] for indicating situations, when individual or religious movement forms its own world view from different elements, which were taken from different existing religions or own [[religious experience]]. Collected from these elements religious world view reminds of a patchwork quilt with a unique pattern. Term has common features with social concepts like [[syncretism]], [[bricolage]], [[sheilaism]].

== History ==
Use of term patchwork concerning religion was for the first time suggested by an American sociologist [[Robert Wuthnow]]. Wutthow studies aspects of American religiosity, believing that its patchwork and avoidance of keeping to strictly defined forms are its essential features. Thus he writes:  &lt;blockquote&gt;“Now, at the end of the twentieth century, growing numbers of Americans piece together their faith like a patchwork quilt. Spirituality has become a vastly complex quest in which each person seeks in his or her own way”.&lt;ref&gt;Wuthnow R. After Heaven: Spirituality in America Since the 1950s / Robert Wuthnow. — Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998. — Р. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;At the same time patchwork of individual religiosity, as Wuthnow states, doesn’t contradict loyalty of individual to church’s official position, in which it must be. In his other book Wuthnow connects patchwork with a feature of American religiosity called The Shopping Mentality. Bearers of such mentality mostly admit the existence of God or some kind of mystical force, but believe that none of religions is able to explain exhaustively this mystery to people. At the same time within the framework of each religion good examples of penetration into mysterious spheres of divine can be found, which means that a person can take some elements from each religion in order to gather them into a general picture of individual religiosity.  &lt;blockquote&gt;“When God is ultimately a mystery, it is easy to assume that all religions contain insights about God but no religion provides a complete understanding of God, and thus one way to increase one`s understanding of God is by gleaning ideas from many different religious traditions”.&lt;ref&gt;Wuthnow R. America and the Challenges of Religious Diversity / Robert Wuthnow. — Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2007. — Р. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Wuthnow writes about spiritual shoppers as about people, who  &lt;blockquote&gt;“Having learned to be open-minded and to patch together ideas from many different sources”.&lt;ref&gt;Wuthnow R. America and the Challenges of Religious Diversity / Robert Wuthnow. — Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2007. — Р. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Patchwork religion in collective consciousness ==
Nevertheless the fact that originally patchwork religion was applied to individual religiosity, it’s also being used in description of public worldview features. Patchwork is inherent in religious traditions, when their representatives include in original teaching or practice not originally inherent elements, for example which were characteristic for other religion, which was dominant among these representatives before. This explains dual faith, superstitions, which can be characterized as interpolations, brought not by an individual believer, but during a historical process. Some scientists think that each religious tradition has its people’s version, which includes such kinds of interpolations (for example, people’s Catholicism, people’s Buddhism etc.).&lt;ref&gt;«Denz H.» Religion, Popular Piety, Patchwork Religion / Hermann Denz // Church and Religion in Contemporary Europe: Results from Empirical and Comparative Research. — Wiesbaden: VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften | GWV Fachverlage GmbH, 2009. — P. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Collective form of patchwork religion, as well as an individual, is an evidence of a conjunction to religious tradition of elements, which were not inherent before, or of a refusal to admit elements, which are inherent in it.

'''''Power Monkeys''''' is a 2016 British political comedy series which appeared on [[Channel 4]] in the run-up to and immediate aftermath of the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|2016 UK EU membership referendum]], and also lampooned the ongoing [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States Presidential election]] campaign. 

The six-part series depicts four different sets of fictional mid-level political operatives, reacting to and commentating on political and other events. Like its predecessor series ''[[Ballot Monkeys]]'', episodes were written and produced within hours of transmission, allowing the characters to react to recent real-world events.&lt;ref name="radi_Jack"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Jack Dee, Claire Skinner and Archie Panjabi join Brexit comedy Power Monkeys |author= |work=RadioTimes |date= |access-date=9 June 2016 |url = http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-05-25/jack-dee-claire-skinner-and-archie-panjabi-join-brexit-comedy-power-monkeys}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inde_Powe"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Power Monkeys is written on the day of broadcast to ensure maximum topicality |author= |work=The Independent |date=8 June 2016 |access-date=9 June 2016 |url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/power-monkeys-the-new-political-sitcom-is-written-on-the-day-of-broadcast-to-ensure-maximum-a7070126.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The series was written by [[Andy Hamilton]] and [[Guy Jenkin]]. It stars Jack Dee, Kevin McNally and Archie Panjabi.&lt;ref name="cast"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Power Monkeys programme information | author =  | work = channel4.com | date =  | accessdate = 2016-06-09 | url = http://www.channel4.com/info/press/programme-information/power-monkeys-programme-information | quote = cast }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Though broader in scope, ''Power Monkeys'' is similar in format to its predecessor, featuring four mostly non-interacting groups of mid-level political operatives. The characters of Gerry of Ukip and Ruby of the Conservatives from ''Ballot Monkeys'' feature. The settings are:&lt;ref name="PM_press"&gt;{{cite web |title=Power Monkeys Press Pack |url= http://www.channel4.com/info/press/press-packs/power-monkeys-press-pack |website=Channel4.com |access-date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[papyrus]] rolls and [[manuscripts]], a '''''reclamans''''' (plural: ''reclamantes'') is a catchline included at the end of a section of text showing the first line or sentence of the subsequent roll or [[codex]], thus ensuring that the reader could quickly determine the proper order in which the particular work was to be read.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|West|1963|p=314}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is well-attested in [[Homeric]] papyri, but it appears to have fallen into disuse in these texts around the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|West|1963|p=315}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems very likely that the increased popularity of inscribing each roll with a book title precipitated the obsolescence of the ''reclamans''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|West|1963|p=315}}, {{harvtxt|Schironi|2010|p=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of prose works, however, the practice continued to be used, and several medieval manuscripts of works like [[Herodotus]]' ''Histories'' and the [[Hippocratic Corpus]] include ''reclamantes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Schironi|2010|p=74–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Son of the White Mare''''' ({{Lang-hu|'''Fehérlófia'''}}) is a 1981 Hungarian animated adventure film directed by [[Marcell Jankovics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Fehérlófia|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/429153/Feherlofia/overview}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story's main character is Fehérlófia (Son of the White Mare), who has superhuman powers. It is based, but deviates at points from, the work of [[László Arany]] and ancient [[Huns|Hunnic]] and [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avaric]] legends as a tribute to ancient steppe peoples.

==Production==
The film was made from 1979 to 1981.&lt;ref name=Jankovics&gt;{{cite web|title=Curriculum Vitae (magyar nyelvű)|url=http://sites.google.com/site/jankovicsmarcell/bemutatkozas/curriculum-vitae|work=Jankovics Marcell honlapja|publisher=[[Google Sites]]|accessdate=27 May 2012|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the second animated feature-length film of Jankovics and [[PannóniaFilm|Pannónia Filmmstúdió]].&lt;ref name=bcdb&gt;"[http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/74921-Feherlofia.html Fehérlófia]". ''Bcdb.com'', April 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Fehérlófia (Son of the White Mare) is born as the third son of a [[horse]], and he gains his power by suckling the horse's milk. He listens to old tales, mostly about the Forefather and the end of his reign, caused by evil [[dragon]]s. After the horse's death, Fehérlófia decided to search and destroy the dragons, who seized power over the world. He met his two brothers, Kőmorzsoló (Stonecrumbler) and Vasgyúró (Ironkneader), who also have superhuman abilities. In search of the Underworld's entrance (home of the dragons), they accommodate themselves in a tree hollow. One of them stays there every day, in order to cook [[mush (cornmeal)|mush]] and make rope while the other two search for the entrance. An ancient and mischievous creature, Hétszűnyű Kapanyányi Monyók (Sevenwinged Skullsized Gnome) keeps asking them to give him some mush. Kőmorzsoló and Vasgyúró refuse to give him food, so Hétszűnyű attacks them and eats the mush from their belly. Fehérlófia, however, stops him by trapping his beard in the tree hollow. Trying to escape, Hétszűnyű fells the tree, and the heroes find the entrance of the Underworld under its roots.

Only Fehérlófia dares to go down there, where he finds the three dragons and three princesses. After the victory, Kőmorzsoló and Vasgyúró rescue the princesses but, Fehérlófia puts apples, each containing a castle, into the cauldron, and although both brothers and the princesses try to lift it, it is too heavy for them. The opening closes and Fehérlófia is left down in the Underworld. The desperate Fehérlófia finds a [[griffin]]'s nest. A [[snake]] tries to eat the griffin chicks, but Fehérlófia stops it. To show his gratitude, the Griffin Father takes Fehérlófia to the upper world. The trip is very long so the griffin has to get some food in order to survive. Finally, Fehérlófia has to cut off his own legs to give something to the griffin to eat.

After the arrival, the griffin chicks restore Fehérlófia's legs, which gives him more power. He is very angry at his brothers, for he believes they left him behind on purpose, but finally, he forgives them. All three marry with one of the princesses and move into castles, and the Forefather restores the power which he lost by the dragon's arrival.

==Comparison with mythology==
There are slight differences between ''Fehérlófia'' and the film. In ''Son of the White Mare'', Fehérlófia and Fanyűvő (Treetearer) are the same person. The film contains elements of creation myths, namely Ősanya (Progenitrix), Ősapa (Forefather), and the Világfa or [[world tree]].

'''''Sum: Forty Tales from the Afterlives''''', also simply called '''''Sum''''', is a work of [[speculative fiction]] by the neuroscientist [[David Eagleman]]. It is in press in 28 languages {{As of|2016|lc=yes}}.  The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described it as "teeming, writhing with imagination."&lt;ref name= "LATimes"&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/features/books/la-ca-discoveries1-2009feb01,0,6815929.story David Eagleman''s Sum] (book review), Los Angeles Times, February 1, 2009. Retrieved on 2009-02-08.&lt;/ref&gt;  Barnes and Noble named it one of the Best Books of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bnreview.barnesandnoble.com/t5/Reviews-Essays/The-Best-Books-of-2009-Editors-Picks/ba-p/1853 Best Books of 2009], Barnes and Noble Review, Dec 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
As a [[short story cycle]], the book presents forty mutually exclusive stories staged in a wide variety of possible afterlives. The author has stated that none of the stories is meant to be taken as serious theological proposals but, instead, that the message of the book is the importance of exploring new ideas beyond the ones that have been traditionally passed down.&lt;ref name="Writing about what comes next"&gt;Lanham, F. [http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/features/6266014.html# Writing about what comes next]. Houston Chronicle. Feb 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The title word "Sum" refers to the Latin for "I am," as in ''[[Cogito ergo sum]]''.

Like Italo Calvino's ''[[Invisible Cities]]'', ''Sum'' does not fit entirely into the traditional category of a novel.  ''Sum'' has been called "philosofiction",&lt;ref name= "Texas"&gt;[http://www.texasmonthly.com/2009-02-01/bookreviews.php David Eagleman's ''Sum: Forty Tales from the Afterlives''] (book review), Texas Monthly, February 2009.

The [[New York Times]] Book Review called Sum a "delightful, thought-provoking little collection [which] belongs to that category of strange, unclassifiable books that will haunt the reader long after the last page has been turned".&lt;ref&gt;Alexander McCall Smith, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/14/books/review/Smith-t.html Eternal Whimsy: Review of David Eagleman's ''Sum''], New York Times Book Review, June 12, 2009.

On September 10, 2009, Sum was ranked by Amazon as the #2 bestselling book in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebookseller.com/news/96631-story-collection-soars-after-fry-tweet.html Story collection soars after Fry Tweet].

The book received accolades from non-religious reviewers as well as from the religious community. The recommendations of [[Stephen Fry]], [[Philip Pullman]], [[Brian Greene]], [[Brian Eno]], and others appear on the cover, and ''Sum'' was named as one of the Best Spiritual Books of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiritualityandpractice.com/books/features.php?id=19213 The Best Spiritual Books of 2009], Spirituality and Practice.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Eagleman refers to himself as a [[possibilianism|possibilian]]&lt;ref&gt;Eagleman, David, [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727795.300-between-god-and-atheism-why-i-am-a-possibilian.html?full=true Beyond God and atheism: Why I am a 'possibilian'], 27 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and to ''Sum'' as a reflection of that position.&lt;ref name="TOTN"&gt;NPR: Talk of the Nation, Feb 17, 2009.

[http://www.onpointradio.org/shows/2009/02/envisioning-the-afterlife 'Envisioning the Afterlife'].&lt;/ref&gt;  The possibilian perspective is distinguished from [[agnosticism]] in that it consists of an active exploration of novel possibilities and an emphasis on holding multiple hypotheses at once when no data is available to privilege one position over the others.&lt;ref name="TOTN" /&gt;  [[Possibilianism]] is understood to be consonant with the "scientific temperament" of creativity and tolerance for multiple ideas when there is a lack of data.&lt;ref name="Writing about what comes next"/&gt;  Speaking with ''the New York Times'', Eagleman stated that he was working on a book entitled "Why I am a Possibilian".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Blake, [http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/10/stray-questions-for-david-eagleman Stray Questions for David Eagleman], NYTimes.com, July 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HarleianMisc.png|thumb|right|Title page from the second edition of ''Harleian Miscellany'' (1753)]]
'''''The Harleian Miscellany''''' is a collection of material from the [[library]] of the [[Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer]] collated and edited by [[Samuel Johnson]] and [[William Oldys]] between 1744 and 1753 on behalf of the publisher [[Thomas Osborne (publisher)|Thomas Osborne]]. Its subtitle was  '''A Collection of Scarce, Curious, And Entertaining Pamphlets And Tracts, as well In Manuscript As In Print, Found In The Late Earl Of Oxford's Library, Interspersed With Historical, Political, And Critical Notes'''.

==Provenance==
The "late Earl of Oxford" whose library was the source of the texts could refer either to [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer]] (died 1724), or to his son, [[Edward Harley, 2nd Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer]] (died 1741). A passage at the beginning of the first volume emphasizes the role of Robert Harley, the first earl, in the creation of the library:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There can be no Objection against the Prefixing the reasons for Creating the Right Honorable Robert Harley, Esq., a Peer of Great-Britain, and Earl of Oxford; especially, as the valuable Collection, intended to be published in this Form, was made by the Greatness of his Knowledge in all Branches of Learning, and at the vast Expence of that noble Family. ...his Library consisted of more than 100000 different Authors: He, I say, cannot be denied the first Place in this Miscellany, which esteems it an Honour to bear his Name.&lt;ref&gt;''The Harleian Miscellany'', vol. 1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WpVCAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=harleian+miscellany&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QHn0zKwrab&amp;sig=IUkRPlFiwZx9IoUKv2GUHQ81PHU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ciA5TZL8HIO78gbd9cX1Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=robert%20harley&amp;f=false p. 1].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Edward Harley, the second earl, who had died only a few years before ''The Harleian Miscellany'' was published, was also a [[bibliophile]] who had greatly expanded the library.&lt;ref&gt;David Stoker, ‘[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12337 Harley, Edward, second earl of Oxford and Mortimer (1689–1741)]’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anthony Joseph &amp; The Spasm Band''' were a band led by [[Trinidad]]ian poet, novelist and lecturer [[Anthony Joseph]]. The band was formed in [[London]] in 2005 as an offshoot of his then novel-in-progress [[The African Origins of UFOs]]. The band's musical influences include [[Free Jazz]], Afro-Caribbean funk, [[spoken word]], [[soca music|soca]], [[rapso]], [[Calypso music|Calypso]], [[Rock music|Rock]] and the hypnotic [[Spiritual Baptist]] rhythms that were prominent in Joseph's childhood in Trinidad.
In December 2005, as a quartet, they recorded their first album 'The Spasm Band' in London. The album was self produced and received only limited exposure. It was heard via Myspace by Parisian producer and Jazz aficionado Antoine Rajon who signed Joseph to his Heavenly Sweetness label and released the Spasm Band's debut 12" [[Extended play|EP]] [[Spirit Lash]], which featured songs from their initial recordings.

==Leggo de Lion==
Their debut album [[Leggo de Lion]] was released in April 2007 by Kindred Spirits and the Spasm Band toured Europe and the UK during 2007 in support of the album, appearing at the [[North Sea Jazz Festival]], Rotterdam, Les Eurockeennes, Belfort, Roskilde, Denmark and the Blue Note Jazz Festival in Paris. They also performed at the Jazz au Chellah Festival in Rabat, Morocco.

==Bird Head Son==
In March 2008 they recorded their second album [[Bird Head Son]] in just two days in Meudon, France, produced by Antoine Rajon. During the sessions, 20 songs were recorded live in the studio with no overdubs. The album features the now expanded Spasm Band line up as well as guest performers Keziah Jones, Defunkt founder Joseph Bowie, David Neerman and Jamika Ajalon. A 3 track EP La Diablese was released by Heavenly Sweetness in July 2008. It included the tracks "Vero", "Robberman" (both included on the Bird Head Son album) and an exclusive version of  Poverty is Hell by the [[Mighty Shadow]].

The Bird Head Son Tour commenced in December 2008 at Rennes, France and continued throughout 2009.

The album was released in January 2009 by Naive/Heavenly Sweetness. As with Joseph's last album, [[Leggo de Lion]] this album is also accompanied by a new literary work; Joseph's 3rd collection of poetry, also entitled Bird Head Son which was published by Salt Publishing in February 2009 to coincide with the UK release of the album. It includes lyrics from the album.

==Rubber Orchestras==

The band's third album [[Rubber Orchestras]] was released in October 2011. It featured production from Malcolm Catto and Jerry Dammers and was named Jazz/World album of 2011 by Les Inrocks magazine, album of the year by Vibrations Magazine. A single and video 'She is the sea' was also released from the album in late October 2011.&lt;ref name="http://yearendlists.com/2011/12/les-inrocks-100-best-albums-of-2011/"&gt;http://www.yearendlist.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Third World Quarterly''''' is a [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] published by [[Routledge]], established in 1979. {{As of|2017}}, its [[editor-in-chief]] is Shahid Qadir. It was published eight times per year until 2011, when publication increased to ten times per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Third World Quarterly | url = http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/CTWQ | publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |accessdate= 29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now published monthly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Third World Quarterly | url = http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/CTWQ | publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |accessdate= 21 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'', the journal had an [[impact factor]] of 1.451 in 2014, ranking it 35th out of 55 journals in the category "Planning and Development".&lt;ref name="WoS"&gt;{{cite book|title=2014 [[Journal Citation Reports]]|last=|first=|publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]]|year=2014|isbn=|edition=Social Sciences|series=[[Web of Science]]|location=|pages=|chapter=Journals Ranked by Impact: Planning and Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In September 2017, the journal attracted controversy after it published an article entitled "The Case for Colonialism" by political scientist [[Bruce Gilley]]. This was described by Portia Roelofs and Max Gallien of the [[London School of Economics]] as "a travesty, the academic equivalent of a Trump tweet, clickbait with footnotes." 

On 19 September 2017, a large number of the journal's [[editorial board]] resigned in protest, citing a flawed peer review process for the colonialism submission and inaccurate statements from the editor-in-chief, Shahid Qadir.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Thomas, Rosamma|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/journals-editorial-board-resigns-over-colonialism-essay/articleshow/60754617.cms|title=Journal's editorial board resigns over colonialism essay |work=The Times of India|date=19 September 2017|access-date=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all, 15 of the 34 members of the international editorial board were signatories to the resignation letter. A petition at [[Change.org]] to retract the piece had more than 10,000 supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/09/19/controversy-over-paper-favor-colonialism-sparks-calls-retraction|title=Controversy over a paper in favor of colonialism sparks calls for retraction|last=Flaherty|first=Colleen|date=19 September 2017|work=[[Inside Higher Education]]|access-date=19 September 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/editorial-board-of-third-world-quarterly-resigns/120188|title=Editorial Board of ‘Third World Quarterly’ Resigns|last=Zamudio-Suaréz|first=Fernanda|date=20 September 2017|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|access-date=23 September 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/simon-dawes-co-signatories/open-letter-to-third-world-quarterly-on-publication-of-case-for-coloniali|title=Open letter to Third World Quarterly on the publication of 'The case for colonialism'|date=20 September 2017|work=openDemocracy|access-date=23 September 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VanGogh-self-portrait-with bandaged ear.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Vincent van Gogh]], ''Self-portrait with Bandaged Ear, Easel and Japanese Print'', January 1889. Van Gogh, who struggled with poverty and mental illness for most of his life, is regarded as a famous example of the tortured artist.]]
The '''tortured artist''' is a [[stock character]] and real-life [[stereotype]] who is in constant torment due to frustrations with [[art]] and other people.

==Characteristics==
Tortured artists feel alienated and misunderstood due to the perceived ignorance or neglect of others who do not understand nor support them and the things they feel are important. They sometimes [[tobacco smoking|smoke]], experience [[sexual frustration]] and recurring [[broken heart|heartbreak]], and generally appear overwhelmed by their own emotions and inner conflicts. They are often mocked in popular culture for "thinking too much", being [[quixotism|quixotic]], or coming across as pretentiously averse to happiness and fun. Other stereotypical traits vary between extremes—from being [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] and [[Extraversion and introversion#Extraversion|extraverted]] to being [[Self-hatred|self-loathing]] and [[Extraversion and introversion#Introversion|introverted]]. Tortured artists are often self-destructive in behavior and are generally associated with mental health issues such as [[substance abuse]], [[personality disorder]]s or [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. Tortured artists are often prone to [[Self-harm|self-mutilation]] and have a high rate of [[suicide]].

The '''vertical deflection''' ('''VD'''; also known as '''deflection of the [[plumb line]]''' and '''astro-geodetic deflection''') at a point on the Earth is a measure of how far the [[gravity direction]] has been shifted by local anomalies such as nearby mountains. They are widely used in [[geodesy]], for [[surveying]] networks and for geophysical purposes.

The vertical deflection are the angular components between the true [[zenith]] (plumb line) and the line perpendicular to the surface of the [[reference ellipsoid]] chosen to approximate the earth's sea-level surface. VDs are caused by [[mountain]]s and by underground [[geology|geological]] irregularities and can amount to angles of 10″ (flat areas) or 20–50″ (alpine [[terrain]]){{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}.

The deflection of the vertical has a north-south component ''ξ'' and an east-west component&amp;nbsp;''η''. The value of ''ξ'' is the difference between the ''astronomic latitude'' minus the ''[[geodetic latitude]]'' (taking north latitudes to be positive and south latitudes to be negative); the latter is usually calculated by geodetic network [[coordinate]]s. The value of ''η is'' the ''astronomic longitude'' minus the [[longitude]] (taking east longitudes to be positive and west longitudes to be negative). When a new mapping datum replaces the old, with new geodetic latitudes and longitudes on a new ellipsoid, the calculated vertical deflections will change too.

[[Image:GRAVIMETRIC DATUM ORIENTATION.SVG|thumb|Earth's ellipsoid, geoid, and two types of vertical deflection]]

==Determination==
The deflections reflect the [[undulation of the geoid]] and [[gravity anomaly|gravity anomalies]], for they depend on the [[gravity field]] and its inhomogeneities.

VDs are usually determined astronomically. The ''true zenith'' is observed astronomically with respect to the [[star]]s, and the ''ellipsoidal zenith'' (theoretical vertical) by geodetic network computation, which always takes place on a [[reference ellipsoid]]. Additionally, the very local variations of the VD can be computed from gravimetric survey data and by means of [[digital terrain model]]s (DTM), using a theory originally developed by [[Felix Andries Vening Meinesz|Vening-Meinesz]].

VDs are used in [[astro-geodetic levelling]], a geoid determination technique. As a vertical deflection describes the difference between the geoidal and ellipsoidal normals, it represents the horizontal [[gradient]] of the undulations of the geoid (i.e., the separation between geoid and reference ellipsoid). Given a starting value for the geoid undulation at one point, determining geoid undulations for an area becomes a matter for simple integration.

In practice, the deflections are observed at special points with spacings of 20 or 50 kilometers. The densification is done by a combination of DTM models and areal [[gravimetry]]. Precise VD observations have accuracies of ±0.2″ (on high mountains ±0.5″), calculated values of about 1–2″.

The maximal VD of [[Central Europe]] seems to be a point near the [[Großglockner]] (3,798&amp;nbsp;m), the highest peak of the [[Austria]]n [[Alps]]. The approx. values are ξ = +50″ and η = −30″. In the [[Himalaya]] region, very asymmetric peaks may have VDs up to 100″ (0.03°). In the rather flat area between [[Vienna]] and [[Hungary]] the values are less than 15", but scatter by ±10″ for irregular rock densities in the subsurface.

More recently, a combination of [[digital camera]] and [[tiltmeter]] have also been used, see [[zenith camera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1061/(ASCE)SU.1943-5428.0000009| title = Modern Determination of Vertical Deflections Using Digital Zenith Cameras| journal = Journal of Surveying Engineering| volume = 136| pages = 1| year = 2010| last1 = Hirt | first1 = C. | last2 = Bürki | first2 = B. | last3 = Somieski | first3 = A. | last4 = Seeber | first4 = G. N. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
Vertical deflections are principally used in four matters:
# For precise calculation of '''survey networks'''. The geodetic [[theodolite]]s and levelling [[measuring instrument|instrument]]s are oriented with respect to the true [[vertical direction|vertical]], but its [[Deflection (physics)|deflection]] exceeds the geodetic measuring accuracy by a factor of 5 to 50. Therefore, the data have to be corrected exactly with respect to the global ellipsoid. Without these reductions, the surveys may be [[distortion|distorted]] by some centimeters or even decimeters per km.
# For the '''geoid determination''' (mean sea level) and for exact transformation of [[elevation]]s. The global geoidal [[Undulation of the geoid|undulation]]s amount to 50–100&amp;nbsp;m, and their [[region]]al values to 10–50&amp;nbsp;m. They are adequate to the [[integral]]s of VD components ξ,η and therefore can be calculated with cm accuracy over distances of many kilometers.
# For '''[[GPS]] surveys'''. The [[satellite]]s measurements refer to a pure [[geometry|geometrical]] system (usually the [[WGS84]] ellipsoid), whereas the terrestrial heights refer to the geoid. We need accurate geoid data to combine the different types of measurements.
# For '''[[geophysics]]'''. Because VD deflection data are affected by the physical structure of the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]] and mantle, [[geodesist]]s are engaged in [[model (abstract)|models]] to improve our knowledge of the Earth's interior. Additionally and similar to ''applied geophysics'', the VD data can support the future [[exploration]] of raw materials, [[Petroleum|oil]], gas or [[ore]]s.

Various explanations have been raised.
