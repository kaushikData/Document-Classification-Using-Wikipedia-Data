__NOTOC__
Year '''487 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Sicinius and Aquillius''' (or, less frequently, '''year 267 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 487 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==

=== By place ===

==== Greece ====
* The island of [[Aegina]] and the city of [[Athens]] go to war. The island has earned the enmity of Athens by earlier submitting to the Persians. The Spartan King, [[Leotychidas]], tries unsuccessfully to arrange a truce in the war.
* The [[Athens|Athenian]] Archonship becomes elective by lot from all the [[Citizenship|citizens]], an important milestone in the move towards radical [[Athenian democracy]]. There are nine [[archon]]s and a secretary. Three of the archons have special functions: the [[basileus]], or sovereign; the [[polemarch]] (originally a military commander); and the archon eponymous (chief magistrate), who gave his name to the year.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

====Rome====
* Wars are fought between [[Roman republic|Rome]] and each of the [[Roman-Volscian_wars#Ongoing_hostilities_from_487_BC|Volsci]] and the [[Roman_conquest_of_the_Hernici#The_foedus_Cassianum_-_5th_century_BC|Hernici]].  Rome prevails in both disputes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5667">'''Accident-proneness''', also known as '''clumsiness''', is the idea that some people have a greater predisposition than others to suffer [[accident]]s, such as [[car crash]]es and [[industrial injuries]]. It may be used as a reason to deny any [[insurance]] on such individuals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insurancecompanies.com/insider-information-how-insurance-companies-measure-risk/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early work==

The early work on this subject dates back to 1919, in a study by Greenwood and Woods, who studied workers at a British munitions factory and found that accidents were unevenly distributed among workers, with a relatively small proportion of workers accounting for most of the accidents.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, M. and Woods, H.M. (1919) The incidence of industrial accidents upon individuals with special reference to multiple accidents. ''Industrial Fatigue Research Board, Medical Research Committee'', Report No. 4. Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London.&lt;/ref&gt;
Further work on accident-proneness was carried out in the 1930s and 1940s.

== Present study ==

The subject is still being studied actively.  Research into accident-proneness is of great interest in [[safety engineering]], where human factors such as pilot error, or errors by nuclear plant operators, can have massive effects on the reliability and safety of a system.
One of the areas of most interest and more profound research is the Aeronautical area, where accidents have been reviewed from psychological and human factors, to mechanical and technical failures. There has been many conclusive studies, that present that human factor has great influence on the results of those occurrences.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Statistical evidence ===

Statistical evidence clearly demonstrates that different individuals can have different rates of accidents from one another; for example, young male drivers are the group at highest risk for being involved in car accidents. There also seems to be substantial variation in personal accident rates between individuals.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Doubt ===

However, a number of studies have cast doubt on whether accident-proneness actually exists as a ''distinct, persistent and independently verifiable'' physiological or psychological syndrome. Although substantial research has been devoted to this subject, there still seems to be no conclusive evidence either for or against the existence of accident proneness in this sense.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Nature and causes ===

The exact nature and causes of accident-proneness, assuming that it exists as a distinct entity, are unknown.  Factors which have been considered as associated with accident-proneness have included [[absent-mindedness]], [[wikt:clumsiness|clumsiness]], [[carelessness]], [[impulsivity]], predisposition to [[risk]]-taking, and unconscious desires to create accidents as a way of achieving secondary gains.
Broad studies on the speed and accuracy using a specially designed test sheet of finding a specific figure on various people as Japanese, Brazil born Japanese, Chinese, Russian, Spanish, Filipinos, Thai and Central Americans with different educational backgrounds. The studies have revealed that educational background or study experience is the key factor of concentration capability. Screening new employees using this test gave drastic decrease of work accidents in several companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f6.dion.ne.jp/~iccinc |title=創造性ﾃｽﾄ、薬不要の風邪治療(妊婦､ｱｽﾘｰﾄ､NSAID)、適性ﾃｽﾄ |publisher=F6.dion.ne.jp |date= |accessdate=2015-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923000135/http://www.f6.dion.ne.jp/~iccinc/ |archivedate=2015-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Addis Fortune''''' (also known as '''''Fortune''''') is a private and independent newspaper based in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]].

==Overview==
It is reportedly the largest English-language weekly in the country. Its circulation is often quoted at a meager 7,500 copies per week in a country with a population of 100 million. However, its rival, ''Capital'', which is also based in Addis Ababa, recently claimed to have topped ''Fortune'' in circulation in a project launched to celebrate its ten-year anniversary. Fortune still claims to be the largest circulating paper in its category, surpassing all others in the competition by an average of 60%. Its current editor-in-chief is Fasika Tadesse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://addisfortune.com/About_Addis_Fortune.htm Addis fortune performs better than other English papers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221190540/http://addisfortune.com/About_Addis_Fortune.htm |date=February 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three individuals named some variation of al Ghamdi on 
the [[Saudi most wanted list]]: [[Ali A. Al-Ghamdi]], [[Hani S. Al-Ghamdi]] and [[Bandar A. Al-Ghamdi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saudinf.com/main/y5703.htm |title=Saudi security authorities abort attempted terrorist attack |publisher=SAMIRAD |accessdate=2009-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[BBC News]]'' Ali Abd al-Rahman al-Faqasi al-Ghamdi surrendered on June 26, 2003, shortly after he had been listed as the second most senior wanted individual on the first [[Saudi most wanted list]].&lt;ref name=Bbc2003-06-27/&gt;
They reported US officials asserted that he had been present in [[Afghanistan]] in late 2001, and that he had been present at the [[battle of Tora Bora]].

The first season of ''[[American Idol]]'' premiered on June 11, 2002 (under the full title '''''American Idol: The Search for a Superstar''''') and continued until September 4, 2002.  It was won by [[Kelly Clarkson]]. The first season was co-hosted by [[Ryan Seacrest]] and [[Brian Dunkleman]], the latter of whom left the show after the season ended.

The winner, Kelly Clarkson, signed with [[RCA Records]], the label in partnership with American Idol's [[19 Recordings]]. Immediately post-finale, Clarkson released two singles, including the coronation song, "[[A Moment Like This]]". "A Moment Like This" went on to break a thirty-eight-year-old record held by [[The Beatles]] for a song's biggest leap to number one on the Billboard Hot 100. It jumped up from number fifty-two to number one in just one week. She held that record for five years but she reclaimed that record back in 2009 with her hit single "[[My Life Would Suck Without You]]" when it jumped up from number ninety-seven to number one.   Clarkson has enjoyed a successful recording career since winning, with multiple-platinum albums, a number of Top 10 hit singles and three [[Grammy Awards]]. Runner-up Justin Guarini also signed with RCA Records, eventually debuting an album in 2003 after the conclusion of season 2. RCA dropped him shortly after its debut.  In addition to Clarkson and Guarini, also signed were [[Nikki McKibbin]], [[Tamyra Gray]], [[R. J. Helton]], and Christina Christian.

After the finale, a special show in Las Vegas was also shown on September 23, 2002 where all 30 of the contestants who made the judges' initial cut performed during in a two-hour concert.

The show inspired a 2003 musical film, ''[[From Justin to Kelly]]'', featuring Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini.

==Regional auditions==

Auditions were held in [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Chicago]], [[Dallas]], [[Miami]], [[Atlanta]], and [[Seattle]] in the spring of 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idolonfox.msn.com/info/index_nf.htm |title=Show info programs |publisher=idolonfox.msn.com |date= |accessdate=September 4, 2011 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20020808131710/http://idolonfox.msn.com/info/index_nf.htm |archivedate = August 8, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and around 10,000 attended the auditions.

One of the more prominent auditioners this season was Tamika Bush who objected to the judges' critiques and their pronunciation of her name.  She was later invited back to critique the contestants' semifinal performance.  [[Kristin Holt]] who auditioned in Dallas was put through to the Hollywood rounds, but in her rush to embrace the judges, fell and slipped under the judges' table.

Kelly Clarkson was notable for being largely absent in the audition episode, and she remains the only winner whose audition was not aired in the original broadcast.  The other top 10 finalists in Season 1 whose auditions were not shown were Nikki McKibbin and EJ Day.

===Structure of auditions===
There are usually three stages in the audition process in every season, the first stage being the open call audition advertised.  In this stage those auditioning each sings briefly in groups of five in front of selectors, though some may be asked to sing further.  Most of those who attended are eliminated at this stage with only a limited number of auditioners selected to proceed further. In the second round they sing in front the executive producers and more are eliminated. In some later years a further round may be added before this round of audition.  In the last round those who survive the first two-stage sing in front of the judges and this is the audition shown on television.  Those who gain at least two "yes" votes from the three judges then receive a golden ticket to Hollywood.

In the first season, the second and third stage of the audition may take place within a single day, but in the following seasons each stage of the audition may take place on separate days.  The initial audition venue need not necessarily be the final audition venue in front of the judges, and in later seasons, up to three separate venues may be used for the auditions in each city.  The venues and dates of the second audition in front of the producers are not specifically listed in these pages.   In the early seasons, the entire audition process in each city took place within a relatively short span of time, 3 days in the case of Season 1, but became progressively extended in later seasons until the callback date may be many weeks after the initial auditions.

==Hollywood week==
The Hollywood week rounds were held in [[Pasadena Civic Center]] where 121 contestants competed for a place in the finals.  The contestants first emerged on stage in groups of nine or ten but performed solo unaccompanied, and those who did not impress the judges were cut after the group finished their individual performances.  65 were selected to proceed on to the next round.  The singers were expected to learn their songs that night and perform the next day in groups of three.  The girls and boys were separated and given crash course to learn their song, which was [[Dionne Warwick]]'s "[[I Say a Little Prayer]]" for the girls and "[[For Once in My Life]]" for the boys.  Many however frequently forgot the lyrics.  Again those who failed to impress were cut immediately after their performance.  45 made it to the next round, and the 20 cut were given their last chance to voice their opinion to the judges before leaving.

In the final round, the remaining 45 were given new songs to learn and each performed solo and a cappella.  30 contestants were chosen after this round. The Top 15 were first announced, the judges then selected 15 more out of the remaining 30.  The 30 were split into two groups and the judges then went to each group to announce the chosen group.

Delano Cagnolatti was initially amongst those announced as the Top 30, but he was later disqualified for falsifying his age,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realitynewsonline.com/cgi-bin/ae.pl?mode=1&amp;article=article2022.art&amp;page=1 Age and Talent on 'American Idol'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507000450/http://www.realitynewsonline.com/cgi-bin/ae.pl?mode=1&amp;article=article2022.art&amp;page=1 |date=May 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and became the first person to be disqualified on ''American Idol''.  He was replaced by [[EJay Day]].

==Semi-finals==
The 30 contestants who reached this stage in this season were referred to in the show as the finalists.

Before their performance, the contestants took part in intensive music workshop where they were given vocal coaching by Debra Byrd and advice by stylists.  The contestants were held in the Red Room before they each emerged to perform solo with piano accompaniment.  There was no studio audience at this stage and the performance was pre-taped.  The audience voted after each round of performance, and the results of the vote were announced the next day live.  A total of 3.3 million votes were cast in the first week of voting.&lt;ref name="telescpe"/&gt;
 
Below are the three semi-final groups with contestants listed in their performance order. In each group, three people advanced to the next round, based on votes by the viewers.

== Finals ==

The finals were broadcast live, in front of a live studio audience. The finals lasted for eight weeks, each finalist performed a song or songs selected from a weekly theme. During the first few weeks, contestants sang one song each. By the top four week, the contestants sang two songs each, and in the finale the two finalists performed three songs apiece.

The results of public vote were revealed in the night following the performance night in the results show. The three or two contestants in the later rounds who received the lowest number of votes were typically called the Bottom Three or Two. From the bottom three, one contestant was sent to safety so that two contestants remained and finally the contestant who received the fewest votes was eliminated from the competition.  A farewell video with montage of the eliminated contestant is shown.

This season largely set the pattern for later seasons, such as group performance by the contestants during the result shows, hometown visits for the top 3, and performing the songs for the top 2 that would be released immediately after the finale.  In this season, there were no guest mentors apart from the [[Burt Bacharach]] week where the composer helped the contestants prepare their songs.

The finale was between [[Kelly Clarkson]] and [[Justin Guarini]], and Kelly Clarkson was declared the winner with 58% out of 15.5 million votes cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1457324/kelly-clarkson-crowned-american-idol.jhtml |title=Kelly Clarkson Crowned 'American Idol' |publisher=Mtv.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over 110 million votes were cast over the entire season.&lt;ref name="telescpe"&gt;[http://www.telescope.tv/americanIdol1.html Telescope Case Studies] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026064253/http://www.telescope.tv/americanIdol1.html |date=October 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A television special from [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] starring the top thirty-two finalists aired later, a [[American Idols LIVE! Tour 2002|thirty date tour]] with the top ten followed, as did the [[box office bomb]] movie titled ''[[From Justin to Kelly]]''.

It was revealed during the season that around 100 [[Phreaking|phone-phreak]] hackers with power-dialing hardware and software were able to place as many as 10,000 votes a night from a single phone line with the touch of a button.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2002-08-16-american-idol_x.htm |title=Tech-savvy viewers may skew 'American Idol' vote |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2002-08-17 |accessdate=2014-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, FremantleMedia, which produces the show, contended that the hackers have had 'statistically insignificant' effect on the vote. Simon Cowell also insisted that Tamyra Gray's unexpected ouster from the show only strengthened the producers' contention that the voting was fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Susman |first=Gary |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20312226_340308,00.html |title=Simon Says |publisher=Ew.com |date=2002-08-23 |accessdate=2014-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, concerns were raised about possible unfairness in the situation of a tight vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realitynewsonline.com/cgi-bin/ae.pl?mode=1&amp;article=article2149.art&amp;page=1 American Idol Voting May Be Skewed] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415020521/http://www.realitynewsonline.com/cgi-bin/ae.pl?mode=1&amp;article=article2149.art&amp;page=1 |date=April 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ken Warwick later said in Season 5 that equipment was put in place afterwards to address this issue but it has never detected such a problem since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realitytvmagazine.sheknows.com/2006/02/04/american-idol-producer-ken-warwick-denies-voting-problems/ |title=American Idol Producer Ken Warwick Denies Voting Problems |publisher=Realitytvmagazine.sheknows.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110402234513/http://realitytvmagazine.sheknows.com/2006/02/04/american-idol-producer-ken-warwick-denies-voting-problems/ |archivedate=2011-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Idol contestants were reported to having to sign a 'phone book-thick' contract that gives producers 'sole discretion' to pick the winners and change the rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Susman |first=Gary |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20312226_339274,00.html |title=Campaign Promise |publisher=Ew.com |date=2002-08-21 |accessdate=2014-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer Nigel Lythgoe however said that the contracts had to anticipate every possible situation, and was not intended to rig the show in favor of any contestant.

Controversy erupted when the winner of Season 1, Kelly Clarkson, was invited to sing "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" in a deal arranged by her then management company, [[19 Entertainment]], at a special commemoration for the first anniversary of [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]] at Washington's [[Lincoln Memorial]]. Some critics suggested that Clarkson's appearance would turn a somber occasion of national mourning into a "giant promotional opportunity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alex Kuczynski |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/07/us/traces-of-terror-the-singer-idol-star-rethinks-9-11-role.html |title=TRACES OF TERROR: THE SINGER; 'Idol' Star Rethinks 9/11 Role |location=Washington (Dc) |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2002-09-07 |accessdate=2014-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kelly Clarkson herself considered withdrawing from the commemoration, saying  "I think it is a bad idea ... If anybody thinks I'm trying to market anything, well, that's awful." and added "I am not going to do it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Silverman |first=Stephen M. |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,624716,00.html |title=Kelly Clarkson Hits Sour Note over 9/11 |publisher=People.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was however unable to withdraw from the event.

==Contestants who appeared on other shows==
*Semi finalist Kelli Glover appeared on the [[America's Got Talent (season 4)|fourth season]] of ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' in 2009 and was eliminated during Judgement Week; she would return to that show for its [[America's Got Talent (season 9)|ninth season]] in 2014 and made it to the live shows.

== US Nielsen ratings ==
Season one of ''American Idol'' was a surprise summer hit show of 2002 and had an average viewership of 12.7 million per episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bill Carter |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/23/business/fox-mulls-how-to-exploit-the-mojo-of-american-idol.html |title=NY Times May 23, 2003 |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2003-05-23 |accessdate=2014-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the summer’s highest-rated show in the 18/49 demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/news2002/aug02/aug26/3_wed/news3wednesday.html |title=Some late summer trophies for 'Idol' |publisher=Medialifemagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902100158/http://www.medialifemagazine.com/news2002/aug02/aug26/3_wed/news3wednesday.html |archivedate=2011-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Andromedids''' [[meteor shower]] is associated with [[Biela's Comet]], the showers occurring as Earth passes through old streams left by the comet's [[Comet tail|tail]]. The comet was observed to have broken up by 1846; further drift of the pieces by 1852 suggested the moment of breakup was in either 1842 or early 1843, when the comet was near Jupiter.&lt;ref name="Space.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jenniskens2007/&gt; The breakup led to particularly spectacular showers in subsequent cycles (particularly in 1872 and 1885).&lt;ref name="Kronk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hergenrother"/&gt;

In the early 19th century, before the break-up of comet [[3D/Biela]], the [[Radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]] was in [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]].&lt;ref name=wieg120926/&gt; In the last century the radiant of the modern weaker meteor shower is generally in the constellation of [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]] as the name of the shower suggests, but due to its age and diffuseness meteors may appear to come from the neighbouring constellations, such as [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]], [[Triangulum]] and Cassiopeia.&lt;ref name="IMO2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Space.com"/&gt;

==Historical appearances==
[[File:Andromedid_meteors,_November_1872.jpg|thumb|right|The Andromedids of 27 November 1872, a product of the breakup of [[Biela's Comet]] several decades previously.]]
The first known sighting of the Andromedids was December 6, 1741, over [[St Petersburg]], Russia.&lt;ref name="Hergenrother"/&gt; Further strong showers were witnessed in 1798, 1825, 1830, 1838 and 1847. The Andromedids produced spectacular displays of several thousand [[meteor]]s per hour in 1872 and 1885, as a result of Earth crossing the comet's debris stream. [[Johann Friedrich Julius Schmidt|Schmidt]], observing from [[Athens]], said that the 1872 shower consisted mainly of faint (5th to 6th magnitude) meteors with "''broad and smoke-like''" trains and a predominantly orange or reddish colouration.&lt;ref name=ajs153&gt;''American Journal of Science'', Third Series, V (Jan-Jun 1873), 153&lt;/ref&gt; In [[England]], [[Edward Joseph Lowe|Lowe]] estimated the same shower as producing at least 58,600 visible meteors between 5.50 and 10.30 pm, observed that the meteors were much slower than the [[Leonids]], and noted noises "''like very distant gun-shots''" several times to the north-west.&lt;ref name=ajs152&gt;''AJS'', V, 152&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Burma]], the 1885 shower was perceived as a fateful omen and was indeed followed swiftly by the collapse of the [[Konbaung dynasty]] and the conquest by Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Lonely Planet Myanmar, 10th edition page 256&lt;/ref&gt;

The November 27, 1885, shower was the occasion of the first known photograph of a meteor, taken by [[Austro-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] astronomer, [[Ladislaus Weinek]], who caught a 7mm-long trail on a plate at his Prague observing station.&lt;ref name=SHughes2012&gt;{{cite book |last=Hughes |first=Stefan |title= Catchers of the Light: The Astrophotographers' Family History |date=2012 |url= http://www.catchersofthelight.com |publisher= S. Hughes |isbn= 162050961X |pages=457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current activity==
Since the 19th century the Andromedids have faded so substantially that they are no longer generally visible to the naked eye, though some activity is still observable each year in mid-November given suitable detection equipment.&lt;ref name="Hergenrother"/&gt; In recent years, peak activity had been less than three meteors per hour, around November 9&lt;ref name="IMO2012"/&gt; to 14.&lt;ref name="Kronk"/&gt; Andromedid activity of November comes from the newest streams, while that of early December comes from the oldest.&lt;ref name="Kronk"/&gt;

On December 4, 2011, six Canadian radar stations detected 50 meteors in an hour. The activity was likely from the 1649 stream.&lt;ref name=wieg120926/&gt; On December 8, 2013, Meteor specialist Peter Brown reported that the Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar had recorded an outburst from the Andromedid meteors in the past 24 hours.&lt;ref name="Sky&amp;Tel131208"/&gt; Scientists postulate a somewhat weaker return in 2018, but a yield of up to 200 meteors an hour in 2023.&lt;ref name=wieg120926/&gt;&lt;ref name=kcros121019/&gt; Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar (CMOR) data also detected a spike of 30 meteors per hour on November 27, 2008.&lt;ref name=wieg120926/&gt;

During the 2012 shower an inconspicuous maximum occurred on November 9.&lt;ref name="IMO2012"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2449">The '''Baxter Althane disaster''' in autumn 2001 was a series of 53 sudden deaths of [[renal failure]] patients in Spain, Croatia, Italy, Germany, Taiwan, Colombia and the USA (mainly Nebraska and Texas). All had received hospital treatment with Althane [[hemodialysis]] equipment, a product range manufactured by [[Baxter International]], USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baxter Dialyzer Recall|url=http://biomed.brown.edu/Courses/BI108/BI108_2007_Groups/group05/pages/baxter.html|work=Major Recalls of Organ Replacement Devices|accessdate=12 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012151427/http://biomed.brown.edu/Courses/BI108/BI108_2007_Groups/group05/pages/baxter.html|archivedate=12 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baxter Faces Suit On Dialysis Deaths|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/14/business/baxter-faces-suit-on-dialysis-deaths.html|accessdate=12 October 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 14, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although official investigations initially found no link between the cases, Baxter Co. eventually published its own findings, admitting that a perfluorohydrocarbon-based cleaning fluid was not properly removed from the tubings during manufacture. Baxter also announced discontinuation and permanent recall of all Althane equipment. Families of most non-US victims were compensated by Baxter voluntarily, while US plaintiffs settled via a [[class action lawsuit]]. The company continues to manufacture dialysis machines of a newer design.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The '''Belgrade International Theatre Festival''' (abbr. '''BITEF''') is a [[theatre festival]] that takes place every September annually in [[Belgrade]], Serbia.

==History==
Founded in 1967, BITEF has continually followed and supported the latest theatre trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.serbiaincoming.com/magazine/47th-bitef-belgrade-international-theatre-festival/ | title=47th BITEF – Belgrade International Theatre Festival | work=Serbia Incoming magazine | publisher=Serbia Incoming magazine | date=18 August 2013 | accessdate=4 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has become one of the most significant culture festivals of Serbia.{{fact|date=August 2014}}

During the 1960s, the founders of this festival ([[Mira Trailović]], [[Jovan Ćirilov]] and their associates) courageously followed tumultuous events in global theatre teeming with [[avant-garde]] explorations.{{fact|date=August 2014}} In the 1980s, BITEF showed Belgrade the highest reaches of the art of theatre, thus becoming one of the few festivals comprising both experimental forms and significant classic achievements.{{fact|date=August 2014}} In spite of political-economic crisis and embargo, in the final decade of the 20th century, BITEF, thanks to the help of international culture centres, government and non-government organizations, managed to keep abreast with the rest of world, through promotion of new theatre trends and ultimate theatre values.

In 1999, BITEF was awarded a Special Prize ''Premio Europa Per Il Teatro'', Taormina arte.{{fact|date=August 2014}} BITEF was the first international theatre festival to receive an award from [[Premio Europa]].{{fact|date=August 2014}}

'''''Brooklyn Lobster''''' is a 2005 American [[drama (film and television)|drama film]] "presented" by [[Martin Scorsese]] and written, produced, and directed by Kevin Jordan. The screenplay is based on Jordan's family's efforts to salvage their [[Brooklyn]]-based [[wholesale]] and [[retail]] [[Fish marketing|seafood operation]] when the bank [[Default (finance)|defaulted]] on a loan they had secured to finance a restaurant extension to the business.

==Plot==
Frank Giorgio's life is thrown into chaos when the bank that loaned him money for a restaurant addition to his seafood business folds and the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation|FDIC]] demands he repay the loan in full immediately. With the threat of a public [[auction]] looming, the very proud and stubborn Frank, his family, and eccentric crew rally to save the business.

Frank's son Michael, who works in the tech world of [[Seattle]], and his girlfriend Kerry return home for [[Christmas]] and are dragged into the family drama. Michael’s childhood home has been sold, and his mother Maureen, who has separated from Frank and is hoping to establish her own identity apart from the business that has consumed her life, is scheduled to move into a rental house after the holidays. Over the course of two weeks, Michael finds himself sleeping on a pull-out couch with his father in Frank's office, catching wandering lobster crates in the bay, and trying to mend his relationship with Kerry after his father assaults her uncle. Meanwhile, his sister Lauren, who has worked with her father since graduating from college, is striving to keep the lines of communication open among all the family members.

In the end, Frank's longtime customer and friend Bill Lau offers the highest bid on the property, with the idea he and Frank will complete construction of the restaurant and operate it as partners.

==Production==
In a bonus feature on the [[DVD]] release of the film, Kevin and Darren Jordan discuss family events that inspired them to develop the film. In 1938, their grandfather established a seafood business on [[Bleecker Street]] in [[Manhattan]], and later moved it to a waterfront location in the [[Sheepshead Bay]] section of Brooklyn where, under the name Jordan's Lobster Dock, it became a popular local landmark. Their father Bill decided to expand the operation by adding a restaurant, but midway through construction the bank that loaned him money to finance the project failed, and the FDIC demanded full repayment of the loan, placing the family in a financial bind.

The film was shot in less than five weeks on the actual site of the Jordan business, as well as in [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]] and [[Rockville Centre]]. All members of Jordan's immediate family had [[Cameo appearance|cameo roles]].

The film premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] and was shown at the [[Hamptons International Film Festival]], the Avignon Film Festival, and the [[Bahamas International Film Festival]]. It went into theatrical release in the US on November 4, 2005 and earned $11,729 in two theaters on its opening weekend. It eventually grossed a total of $138,267.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=brooklynlobster.htm BoxOfficeMojo.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' said the film "has a spontaneous, confident realism about it" and added, "''Brooklyn Lobster'' is a sweet and touching film, worth a visit." &lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060323/REVIEWS/60323004/1023 ''Chicago Sun-Times'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Wilmington of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' awarded the film three out of four stars, calling it "the kind of smart, realistic [[Independent film|indie]] family drama the movies should give us more often, just as they should more often offer performances as full-blooded and rich as Aiello's and Curtin's here." &lt;ref&gt;[http://chicago.metromix.com/movies/review/movie-review-brooklyn-lobster/161579/content ''Chicago Tribune'' review] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725212416/http://chicago.metromix.com/movies/review/movie-review-brooklyn-lobster/161579/content |date=July 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joe Leydon of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said, "Despite worthy contributions on both sides of the camera, ''Brooklyn Lobster'' comes across primarily as a showcase for Danny Aiello in a powerhouse performance . . . Character's multiple mid-life crises could make this genuinely engaging drama especially appealing to older viewers." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117928769.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 ''Variety'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Caretaker cabinet|Caretaker Cabinet]] of [[Vassiliki Thanou-Christophilou]]''' was formed following the resignation of the [[First Cabinet of Alexis Tsipras|Syriza-ANEL coalition government]] on 20 August 2015, and the failure of opposition parties to form their own government. The cabinet was headed by Thanou-Christophilou, the President of the [[Court of Cassation (Greece)|Court of Cassation]], who was sworn in as [[Prime Minister of Greece|Prime Minister]] on 27 August 2015, and the rest of the cabinet were sworn in the next day on 28 August. The cabinet remained in office until the completion of the [[Greek legislative election, September 2015|legislative election on 20 September 2015]].

== Background ==
On 20 August 2015, Prime Minister [[Alexis Tsipras]], who was leading a [[Syriza]]-[[Independent Greeks|ANEL]] [[First Cabinet of Alexis Tsipras|coalition government]], resigned following a rebellion by party members on a key vote related to the [[Third Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece|third bailout package]]. Tsipras said that he needed a stronger mandate in order to implement the bailout package, and so called for a [[Greek legislative election, September 2015|snap legislative election to take place in September]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/28/greece-caretaker-government-sworn-in-first-female-prime-minister|title = Greece's caretaker government sworn in with first female prime minister|last = |first = |date = 28 August 2015|work = Associated Press|access-date = 21 January 2016|via = The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Constitution of Greece|Greek constitution]], the [[President of Greece]] could not just call an election, but had to consult all the major parties in turn to see if they could form their own government, described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' at the time as "a near impossibility given the current makeup of the parliament."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/20/greek-bailout-alexis-tsipras-call-snap-elections|title = Greek bailout: Alexis Tsipras steps down to trigger new elections|last = Henley|first = Jon|date = 20 August 2015|work = The Guardian|access-date = 21 January 2016|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 August, the President, [[Prokopis Pavlopoulos]], informed the party leaders that there was no chance of a coalition government being formed by the existing parliament.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.ekathimerini.com/200978/article/ekathimerini/news/top-judge-thanou-becomes-greeces-first-female-prime-minister|title = Top judge Thanou becomes Greece's first female prime minister|last = |first = |date = 27 August 2015|work = Kathimerini|access-date = 21 January 2016|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

That evening, [[Vassiliki Thanou-Christophilou]] was sworn in as the caretaker [[Prime Minister of Greece]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On 28 August, the rest of the caretaker cabinet were sworn in at the Presidential Mansion. Later that day, Pavlopoulos signed a degree for the snap election, setting the date at 20 September. Also, the caretaker cabinet had their first meeting where they agreed to work towards an "impeccable" election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.ekathimerini.com/200990/article/ekathimerini/news/president-signs-election-decree-caretaker-cabinet-meets|title = President signs election decree, caretaker cabinet meets|last = |first = |date = 28 August 2015|work = Kathimerini|access-date = 21 January 2016|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appointments ==
[[George Chouliarakis]], an academic economist who had been part of the Greek negotiating team during the talks surrounding the third bailout package, was appointed as [[Ministry of Finance (Greece)|Minister of Finance]]. [[Petros Molyviatis]], a "veteran diplomat", was appointed as [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Greece)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], a role he had held in 2012 and from 2004 to 2006. [[Alkistis Protopsalti]], a singer, was appointed as the Alternate Minister of Tourism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Composition==
The cabinet was composed of ten full ministers, nine alternate ministers, one deputy minister and two [[Minister of State (Greece)|Ministers of State]], for a total of 22 members. This would become 23 members if the Government [[Spokesman]], [[Rodolfos Moronis]], was included. 20 members of the cabinet (including Moronis) were male; 3 were female.

Only two members of the [[First Cabinet of Alexis Tsipras]] remained in the same roles, [[Panagiotis Nikoloudis]] as Minister of State for Combatting Corruption and [[Tryfon Alexiadis]] as Alternate Minister of Finance. [[Dimitris Papangelopoulos]] had formerly served in Tsipras's cabinet as a Deputy Minister for Justice, but served as the [[Ministry of Justice, Transparency and Human Rights|Minister of Justice, Transparency and Human Rights]] in the Caretaker Cabinet.

'''Check washing''' is the process of erasing details from [[cheque|checks]] to allow them to be rewritten, usually for [[crime|criminal]] purposes such as fraudulent withdrawal from the victim's [[bank account]]. The technique could potentially be used to remove ink stains from books.

Various steps can be taken by the writer of the check to reduce the possibility of falling victim to check washing. These include mailing checks by placing them in secured mailboxes, using secure ink dispensed from a gel, rollerball, or [[fountain pen|fountain]] [[pen]], filling in all lines on the check, and careful scrutiny of bank statements.

The actual process of washing a check is relatively simple and can be accomplished with basic solvents. The actual solvent is largely irrelevant — more importantly, the polarity of the solvent must match the polarity of the dye in the ink. For example, an ink that is mostly made of a polar dye would require a polar solvent (e.g. [[acetone]] or [[isopropanol]]). Both nail polish remover (acetone) and rubbing alcohol (isopropanol) are able to pull most common inks away from paper in minutes. Similarly, a non-polar dye would require a non-polar solvent (e.g. [[toluene]] or a similar hydrocarbon).

'''Chewidden Thursday''' (also known as White Thursday, Chewidden Day or Jew-whidn) was a festival celebrated by the tin miners of West [[Cornwall]] on the last clear Thursday before (i.e. at least one week before) [[Christmas]]. The festival celebrated the discovery of 'white tin' or smelted tin by St Chiwidden, a little-known Cornish saint who in legend was an associate of [[St Piran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Courtney|first1=Margaret Ann|title=Folklore &amp; Legends of Cornwall|date=1973|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=0874710200|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Hunt (scientist)|Robert Hunt]] in ''Popular Romances of the West of England'' states: 
*''The last Thursday – a clear week before Christmas Day – was formerly always claimed by the tinners as a holiday, and was called by them White-Thursday (Jew-whidn), because on this day, according to tradition, black tin (tin ore) was first melted and refined into white tin. From Jew-whidn to Chi-widden is an easy transition.''&lt;ref&gt;https://cornishculture.co.uk/portfolio/chewidden-thursday/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CyberPatriot''' is the National Youth Cyber Education Program created to help direct students toward careers in [[cybersecurity]] or other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The program, created by the [[Air Force Association]] (AFA), features the National Youth Cyber Defense Competition for high school and middle school students.

Now in its eleventh season, CyberPatriot XI is open to all high schools, middle schools, and accredited home school programs around the country. [[JROTC]] units of all Services, [[Civil Air Patrol]] squadrons, and [[Naval Sea Cadet Corps]] divisions may also participate in the competition.  Outside of the regular competition, CyberPatriot also hosts two additional sub-programs: Summer CyberCamps&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/special-initiatives/afa-cybercamp-program/program-overview|title=2018 AFA CyberCamp Program Overview|website=www.uscyberpatriot.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an Elementary School Cyber Education Initiative&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/special-initiatives/afa-cybercamp-program/standard-afa-cybercamp-information|title=Standard AFA CyberCamp Information|website=www.uscyberpatriot.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[Northrop Grumman]] Foundation is the presenting sponsor. A spin off program is run in the UK called [[Cyber Centurion]].

==History==
CyberPatriot began in 2009 as a proof of concept demonstration at AFA’s Air Warfare Symposium in Orlando, Florida. Nine high school [[Civil Air Patrol]] squadrons competed.  The second phase of the program was limited to Air Force [[JROTC|AFJROTC]] and Civil Air Patrol teams. Online training and qualification competitions were held during fall 2009 with nearly 200 teams from 44 states competing for eight slots to the in-person National Finals Competition in February 2010, held in Orlando, Florida. The final phase of the developmental program, full national deployment, is now underway. Over 1,500 teams from all 50 states, Canada, and DoD Dependant schools overseas competed in CyberPatriot VI. CyberPatriot VII began in October 2014, with over 2,100 teams registered to compete. A new division, the Middle School Division, has been added this season. CyberPatriot IX, started in October 2016, featured over 4,300 registered teams.

==Goals and objectives==

CyberPatriot, is designed to be accessible to any high school or middle school student, provides a path from high school to college and the workforce, and benefits all CyberPatriot partners and our nation. The program increases the awareness of cybersecurity by delivering a basic cybersecurity education in a competitive format that enhances leadership, communication, and cooperation skills among its competitors.

==Organization and preparation==

Teams have the following members:
* Coach: Supervises, chaperones team. Usually a teacher. Does not need to have a technical background.  
* Competitors: 2-6 students (5 competitors, 1 alternate)
* Technical Mentor (Optional):  Particularly useful when coach is not cyber-savvy. Helps teach cyber concepts.
* Team Assistant (Optional): Assistants Coach with daily administrative tasks related to the competition

Each team is required to have a registered Coach and registered Competitors. Coach registration begins in the late spring to allow preparation over the summer. The qualification rounds of the competition are completed online at the teams’ home locations from September to early January.

== Competition guidelines ==
The competition is a tournament structure with three divisions:
# Open High School Division:  Open to all public, private, parochial, magnet, charter, home schools, and special groups such as CampFire, Boys &amp; Girls Club, Boy Scouts, Church Youth Groups, Girl Scouts, etc.
# All-Service Division: Open to all JROTC Services, Civil Air Patrol squadrons, US Naval Sea Cadet Corps units. The registration fee is waived for teams competing in the All-Service Division
# Middle School Division: Open to all middle schools and junior high schools which follow the same common organizations as mentioned above in the Open High School Division.

The early rounds of the competition are done online during weekends via the Internet from teams’ schools or other sponsoring organizations’ facilities. Prior to the round, teams download virtual image representations of operating systems with known flaws, or cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Each team is tasked to find the flaws while keeping specified computer functions (services such as email) working. Team progress is recorded by a central CyberPatriot scoring system.

The scores from Qualification Rounds 1 and 2 are totaled to determine which tier a team advances to:

*Platinum: Top 30% of teams. Rounds include State (guaranteed), Semifinals, and National Finals
*Gold: Middle 40% of teams. Rounds include State (guaranteed) and Semifinals.
*Silver: Bottom 30% of teams. Rounds include State (guaranteed) and Semifinals.

Teams in the Platinum tier are the only teams eligible to qualify for National Finals.

See additional rules below:

* The Qualification Competition begins as soon as this image is opened, and ends 6 consecutive hours later, after which the score will be logged. Attempting to continue after the time limit has reached will incur penalties. It is the coach's responsibility to ensure their team does not exceed the limit.
* Only one instance of the image can be open at any given time. Opening multiple instance of a virtual image will result in a penalty.
* No person may compete on a team with which they are not registered, and may only be registered with one team per competition.
* During the competition, no outside assistance may be given to or received from anyone.
* No competitor may offer assistance to another after their round ends and the others begins.
* No outside communication is allowed during the competition. This includes but is not limited to verbal, electronic, written or coded.
* No offensive activity of any kind is permitted, including but not limited to hacking through programs or manual code injection, interfering with another team through social engineering and/or deception, or attaining the opposing machine.

==National Finals Competition==

The top scoring Semifinal teams from each division, approximately 28 teams, are invited (all-expenses paid) to the in-person National Finals Competition each spring.  For CyberPatriot IV - VII, National Finals Competitions was held at the Gaylord National Hotel and Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland. Beginning the CyberPatriot VIII season, the National Finals Competitions moved to the Hyatt Regency in Inner Harbor, Baltimore, Maryland.

The Challenges that teams may face include:

# Network Security Master Challenge, in which teams fix vulnerabilities in "images" of Operating Systems that have been purposely tampered with while protecting the "images" from "Red Team" which is a group of "hackers" that will unfix vulnerabilities and mess with the competitors.
# Leidos Digital Forensics Challenge, in which teams solve mysteries with computer programs.
# Digital Crime Scene Challenge, in which teams search a live "crime scene" for digital evidence.
# Cisco Networking Challenge, in which teams show their knowledge about Wiring, Cisco's Packet Tracer, and in a Cisco quiz.

Winning teams in the Open and All Service Division earn education grants to the school of their choice. First place teams earn $2,000 per competitor, second place teams earn $1,500 per competitor, and third place earns $1,000 per competitor. The scholarship money is provided by Northrop Grumman Corp. In CyberPatriot VII, for first, second, and third place, an additional $2,000, $1,500, and $1,000 were awarded to the teams, respectively, by the National Security Agency.

The '''Felling Colliery''' (also known as Brandling Main) in [[Great Britain|Britain]], suffered four disasters:{{efn|5 or more killed, the definition used by the Durham Mining Museum}} 1812, 1813, 1821 and 1847. By far the worst of the four was the 1812 disaster which claimed 92 lives on 25 May 1812. The loss of life in the  1812 disaster was one of the motivators for the development of the miners' safety lamp.

==Colliery description==
[[File:Plan of Felling Colliery, May 25 1812.svg|thumb|The drawing is a copy of a published plan of the colliery at the time of the 1812 explosion]]
[[File:John Pit Felling.jpg|thumb|John Pit, Felling. The main access route to the colliery.  Photograph undated, possibly late 19thC]]
[[Felling, Tyne and Wear]] is now part of [[Gateshead]] but at the time of the disasters was a separate manor in what used to be [[County Durham]].{{sfn|Hodgson|1999|p=1}}  Mining of the upper seams had continued throughout the 18th century. Following borings starting in 1758, the main pit was opened in 1779.  The first seam to be worked was the '''High Main''' which ceased production in 1811. Shortly before the High Main was exhausted, the pit was deepened to reach the '''Low Main''' which came into production in May 1811, just a year before the disaster.  The Low Main lies {{convert|94|fathom}} below the surface and is {{convert|3|ft}} thick.  Subsequently two other seams, the Bensham (or Maudlin) and the Hutton were won.{{sfn|Whellan|1894}}

To ensure adequate ventilation two shafts were dug, John Pit and William Pit.  John Pit was the main access shaft and was the ''down-cast'' shaft where fresh air was drawn into the pit.  A steam engine was provided for winding gear, and in 1812 there was a standby horse-whim for when the steam engine was out of use.{{efn|Hodgson notes:"when it lies idle on pay Saturdays"}}{{sfn|Hodgson|1999|p=1}} William Pit was the ''up-cast'' or ''furnace'' pit and had a fire burning at its base.  The rising hot air drew air though the mine from the down-cast pit.  Above each of the two pits were pulleys, those over John Pit were {{convert|6|ft}} in diameter.  The pulleys for the horse-whim were mounted on a crane and kept out of the way, being swung over the pit mouth when required. This arrangement proved fortuitous in the aftermath of the disaster.{{sfn|Hodgson|1999|p=1}}

From the base of the pits a number of '''headings''' were first driven. Between the headings were driven '''stentings'''.  An excavated area was called a '''board''', broken up by '''walls'''.  To ensure the air circulated throughout the mine some boards were blocked off with '''stoppings''' either of brick or timber.  Openings in some of the stoppings allowed the movement of men and materiel. When not being used the openings were closed by '''traps'''.{{sfn|Hodgson|1999|p=1}}

In an era before the invention of the [[safety lamp]], the only practical source of light was a candle.  Where explosive gas was suspected, a [[Safety lamp#First attempts at safe lamps|Spedding mill]] was used.{{sfn|Hodgson|1999|p=7}} A steel cylinder was revolved at high speed against a flint and the resulting shower of sparks gave some light.  Although safer than candles, the Wallsend colliery explosion of 1785 had shown that mills could cause explosions.{{sfn|Durham Mining Museum|2012a}}

==1812 disaster==
At 11:30 on Monday, 25 May 1812 the first explosion occurred. For half a mile around the earth shook and the noise was heard up to four miles away.{{sfn|Hodgson|1999|p=6}}  Large clouds of dust and small coals were thrown up from both William Pit and John Pit.{{sfn|Hodgson|1999|p=6}}  As well as the small particles, the coal baskets and pieces of wood were blown out of the pits and landed nearby. The dust fell like a shower for up to a mile and a half downwind.{{sfn|Hodgson|1999|p=6}}  The ''pit-heads'' or ''shaft-frames'' carrying the pulleys at both pits were blown off, set on fire and the pulleys broken.{{sfn|Hodgson|1999|p=6}} At William Pit the up-cast fed to a horizontal flue on the surface which led to a stack.  Coal dust was distributed three inches thick within this flue which then burnt to a "light cinder".{{sfn|Hodgson|1999|p=6}}

The pulleys for the horse-whim at John Pit were mounted in a crane kept swung away from the shaft.  As a result they were undamaged and could be swung over the shaft.  Men on the surface applied themselves in place of the horses and brought 33 survivors and two corpses out of the colliery.  Three of the survivors subsequently died.  87 men and boys were left below ground.{{sfn|Hodgson|1999|p=6}}

45 minutes after the initial explosion, at 12:15, a rescue team descended the shaft.{{sfn|Hodgson|1999|p=7}}{{efn|The men were Mr. Straker (viewer), Mr. Anderson, William Haswell (overman), Edward Rogers, John Wilson, Joseph Pearson, Henry Anderson, Michael Menham and Joseph Greener (keeper of the adjacent toll-bar).}}  Because of the firedamp they used Spedding mills to light their way.{{sfn|Hodgson|1999|p=7}} It was noted that the sparks fell "like dark drops of blood" due to the foul air.{{sfn|Hodgson|1999|p=7}}  Having attempted two directions and being forced back by difficulty breathing they retreated to the pit bottom. The party ascended, but while two were still below and two were in the shaft a second explosion occurred.{{sfn|Hodgson|1999|p=8}} Haswell and H. Anderson were the two left below and they hung onto a pit prop whilst the blast lifted them and turned them.{{sfn|Hodgson|1999|p=8}}

The rescue team all agreed that there was no possibility of the men left below ground being alive.{{sfn|Hodgson|1999|p=8}}  Two explosions, [[blackdamp]] (locally called choak-damp{{sic}}), fire and the lethal [[afterdamp]] made any rescue attempt impossible. The suggestion was made that the pit be stopped up to extinguish the fire.  However, local recollections of three men who had survived for 40 days in a pit near [[Byker]] led to shouts of "Murder" and obstruction.{{sfn|Hodgson|1999|p=8}}

===Closure===
On the following day, Tuesday, a crowd gathered around John Pit and accusations of cowardice were thrown around.  Eventually the leaders of the crowd were won around.  The owners offered "no expense should be spared" in executing and scheme of rescue but they refused to offer a reward since "they would be accessary to no man's death by persuasion or a bribe".{{sfn|Hodgson|1999|p=9}} William pit was closed over with planks.

On the Wednesday Mr Straker and William Haswell (the [[colliery viewer|viewer]] and the overman) descended John Pit.  The sparks from the Spedding mill were extinguished by the blackdamp and Haswell began staggering within {{convert|7|yd}} due to the effects of the gas. Straker helped him to the shaft where it was still difficult to breathe even in the current of air.{{sfn|Hodgson|1999|p=9}}  Two further men descended but could not move more than a few yards from the base of the shaft and their clothes had the smell of [[stinkdamp]] upon them.{{sfn|Hodgson|1999|p=9}}  Smoke was seen ascending from John Pit, a sure sign of the fire below and so the base of John Pit was sealed with clay and planks laid over the mouth.  Two days later William Pit was further sealed with clay.{{sfn|Hodgson|1999|p=9}}

===Reopening and recovery===
The pit was cautiously reopened on 4 July. The issuing gas was collected in bladders and tested.  At first it exploded when released near a candle flame but by 8 July it was diluted enough not to do so.{{sfn|Hodgson|1999|p=10}} The pits were then opened fully on the seventh and allowed to vent.  In the morning of the eighth, Straker, Anderson, Haswell and six others descended William shaft and found the air cool and wholesome.

Work on recovering the victims and securing the mine then started. All work was performed using Spedding mills for light.  As the workers moved through the mine all the various stoppings and traps had to be repaired to force the air current to fully ventilate it.

The parish priest for Jarrow and Heworth was the [[John Hodgson (antiquary)|Reverend John Hodgson]] (1779–1845).{{sfn|Lumsdon|2013}}  As well giving comfort to the bereaved, he was instrumental in persuading them to accept a common, speedy burial. The bodies had lain for seven weeks in the pit while the fires were extinguished and were badly decayed.  Dr. Ramsay gave his opinion that if the bodies were returned to their homes for a normal [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] and burial "putrid fever" might spread throughout the neighbourhood.{{sfn|Hodgson|1999|p=11}}

Between 8 July and 19 September the business of recovering the dead and repairing the mine continued. Hodgson details the decayed and putrid state of some of the corpses.  The recovery teams placed the bodies in coffins in the mine, there was a fear that the bodies might fall apart.{{sfn|Hodgson|1999|p=10}}

Identification was a problem. Mothers and widows failed to identify most of the bodies "they were too much mangled and scorched to retain any of their features".{{sfn|Hodgson|1999|p=11}}  Most were identified by clothes, tobacco-boxes, shoes and other items.{{efn|Smoking and smoking materials were allowed in many pits (including Felling) at this date.}}

Finally on Sunday 20 September 117 days after the explosion, the pit was inspected by candle light. The furnace below William Pit was relighted and the whole mine brought back into production.  One body has never been found.

===Analysis===
The cause of the first explosion is not known for certain. The most probable cause was firedamp, there being no evidence of large amounts of coal dust in the air, the other significant risk.

After the first explosion the trap doors used for ventilation and the internal wall in the vicinity of the underground crane were observed to be in a good state by the men who escaped.{{sfn|Hodgson|1999|p=14}} Indeed, even the lamp at the crane was still burning. When the mine was reopened the area was found to damaged: "the stoppings and trap-doors were blown down, the roof fallen and as great marks of destruction as in any other part of the mine".{{sfn|Hodgson|1999|p=14}} The area was near John Pit, the down-cast shaft where fresh air was entering the mine at its greatest velocity. Hodgson realised that this was significant and supposed that "the atmospheric current ... intercepted the progress of the first explosion, and prevented it from igniting the fire damp here".{{sfn|Hodgson|1999|p=14}}

Hodgson then proceeds to assume that the "choak-damp", perhaps here thinking of afterdamp rather than blackdamp, pressing upwards from the seat of the explosion forced a pocket of firedamp to where the coal was burning and set off the second explosion.{{sfn|Hodgson|1999|p=14}} However two paragraphs down he observes that the dust in the barrow-ways was burnt to a cinder.{{sfn|Hodgson|1999|p=14}} That coal dust raised by an initial explosion could be the cause of a further explosion was only starting to be understood in this period.

===Aftermath===
{{main|Safety lamp}}
[[File:Davy lamp.png|thumb|A Davy lamp, an early example of a safety lamp]]
The tragedy inspired Hodgson to raise public concern about the hazards of mining. Public interest was fed by a short (16-page) pamphlet written by him and published prior to the second disaster in late 1813. Hodgson wrote for an interested public, not for practical miners, and as such explains mining terms and procedures.  His description and analysis of the two explosions was historically significant as one of the first to attempt a scientific analysis of such events.

On 1 October 1812 the Sunderland Society was set up consisting of clergymen, doctors, owners and mine managers.{{sfn|Lumsdon|2013}}  One of the doctors was [[William Reid Clanny]] (1776-1850) who had already produced a first, impractical, safety lamp. Also present was [[George Stephenson]] who at that time was enginewright for the collieries at Killingworth.  The society aimed for:
*greater publicity for accidents and their causes
*the scientific study of ventilation
*the development of safety lamps.

Stephenson designed a [[safety lamp]], known as the [[Geordie lamp]], with air fed through narrow tubes, down which a flame could not move. It also led Sir [[Humphry Davy]] to devise another safety lamp, the [[Davy lamp]], in which the flame was surrounded by iron gauze. The gauze had to have small spaces so that a flame could not pass through, but could admit [[methane]], which then burned harmlessly inside the lamp. The height of the luminous cone above the flame gave a measure of the methane concentration in the atmosphere.

==1813 disaster==
On 24 December 1813 at 01:30 the colliery again exploded, this time with the loss of 9 men and 13 boys along with 12 horses.{{sfn|Durham Mining Museum|2012b}}  All the dead were in the headways by William Pit (the upcast pit). Those in the boards away from William Pit were saved. The {{harv|Newcastle Courant|1813}} reported the supposition that "the hydrogen{{sic}} took fire at the crane lamp, in the south headways".{{efn|It was not commonly realised at the time that firedamp was essentially methane rather than hydrogen}}{{sfn|Newcastle Courant|1813}}  Thomson also reports this but warns against too early an assumption, mentioning other possibilities such as the failure of a stopping or furnace mismanagement.{{sfn|Thomson|1814|p=132}}

The southern boards were crossed by several fissures ('''dykes''') from which periodic discharges of gas came through apertures called '''blowers'''.  The blowers could make "the coals on the floor dance round their orifices, like gravel in a strong spring".{{sfn|Newcastle Courant|1813}} The discharges were dealt with by the strong current of air, strong enough to extinguish candles.{{sfn|Newcastle Courant|1813}}

None of the mine was found to be damaged by fire so after retrieval of the bodies and inspection of the mine it was reopened.  On 30 December workmen found fire in part of the waste and as a result the mouths of the shafts were stopped up for a while.{{sfn|Newcastle Courant|1813}}
&lt;!-- ==1821 disaster== --&gt;

==1847 disaster==
On Tuesday 22 June 1847, shortly after 21:00, another explosion occurred at Felling Colliery.{{sfn|Newcastle Guardian|1847a}}  Six miners were killed, four outright and two died of their injuries over the following two days. The surgeon employed by the mine owners tried, unsuccessfully, to treat the injured.  Two of the dead were killed immediately by a fall of rock from the roof, the other two by afterdamp.{{sfn|Newcastle Guardian|1847b}} As well as the human cost, eighteen horses were killed either by the explosion or by the afterdamp.

One of the survivors, Peter Gibbon, saw from his safety lamp that the air quality had changed. He commented to the man he was working with, George Chapman, "Do ye mind what a current of air there was!".{{efn|1="Do ye mind" = "Did you notice".}}{{sfn|Newcastle Guardian|1847a}} Chapman had not noticed anything, but being at that time in charge of the pit he went off to investigate.  Chapman was subsequently rescued, but died the following day. After an hour Gibbon tried to escape but broke his lamp and in the darkness was blocked by a roof fall.  He was eventually rescued. That, although significant damage was done, some of the men neither heard nor felt and shock was commented upon in newspaper reports.{{sfn|Newcastle Guardian|1847a}}

The viewer, Mr Foster, stated to the Newcastle Guardian that Davy lamps were employed throughout the colliery and that all the men were given written instructions in their use.  The old areas of the colliery released a lot of foul air, but there was "not a better ventilated colliery on the Tyne". Foster reported that {{convert|60000|cuft}} per minute was drawn down the shaft, a fact confirmed at the coroner's inquest by Mr Foster, the viewer.{{sfn|Newcastle Guardian|1847a}}{{sfn|Newcastle Guardian|1847b}}

The colliery overman, John Greener, told the coroner that he had gone down the pit after the explosion and "found the separation stoppings blown down, and the stables on fire".  He penetrated up to {{convert|600|yd}} from the shaft before being overcome by foul air and forced to retreat and go home.{{sfn|Newcastle Guardian|1847a}}

On the Thursday evening, two days later a coroner's inquest was opened and adjourned until a full inspection could take place.  The inquest reopened on the following Wednesday.  The principal witness was the viewer, Mr Thomas Forster. He confirmed much that had earlier been reported; the pit was well ventilated and Davy lamps were in use.{{sfn|Newcastle Guardian|1847b}}

The seat of the explosion was found by Mr Foster to be an underground engine used to haul coals to the pit base.  The engineman had added fresh coal to the fire and closed the damper before going off shift at 16:00. The damper should have remained slightly open to allow burnt gas from the fire to escape up the chimney.  It was supposed that the damper had been closed fully and partial combustion had occurred effectively generating town gas ("acting as a retort"). The gas eventually escaped and the resultant explosion caused major damage to the boiler and flue.{{sfn|Newcastle Guardian|1847b}}

Four viewers from other pits all corroborated Foster's conclusions. The engineman, George Hope, said that he put on around 3½ pecks{{efn|just under {{convert|1|impbu}}.}} of small coals and "left the damper open about an inch and three-quarters I always leave my fire this way". The coroner's jury returned a verdict of "Accidental Death".  The jury recommended that a pin was placed in the damper so stop it closing to less than four inches ({{convert|4|in|disp=output only}}).{{sfn|Newcastle Guardian|1847b}}

==The memorial to 1812==
A memorial to the 91 victims was placed in St Mary's Churchyard where most of the coffins were placed in a common grave.{{efn|{{gbmapping|NZ 286,619}}}}{{sfn|Durham Mining Museum|2014}}  The monument has a square base with a square pyramid above. On each of the four faces is a brass plaque:

==Description==
The name derives from [[Genkem]], a brand of glues which had "become the generic name for all the glues used by [[Inhalant abuse|glue-sniffing]] children" in South Africa, where the drug originated and is most popular on the African continent today.&lt;ref name=cassere2010&gt;Cassere, Di (November 14, 2000). [http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/glue-loses-high-to-save-street-kid-addicts-1.53018 Glue loses high to save street-kid addicts.] ''[[Independent Online (South Africa)|The Independent]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''Children of AIDS: Africa's Orphan Crisis'' by Emma Guest, the making of jenkem is described: "fermented human sewage, scraped from pipes and stored in plastic bags for a week or so, until it gives off numbing, intoxicating fumes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Guest |first=Emma |title=Children of AIDS: Africa's Orphan Crisis |url= |accessdate= |edition=2nd|year=2003 |publisher=Pluto Press |location= |isbn=978-0-7453-2075-5 |oclc= |page=149 |chapter=Falling through the net. A street child's story, Zambia |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process is similarly described in a 1995 [[Inter Press Service|IPS]] report: "Human [[excreta]] is scooped up from the edges of the sewer ponds in old cans and containers which are covered with a [[polyethylene]] bag and left to stew or ferment for a week."&lt;ref name=IPS/&gt; A 1999 [[BBC]] article refers to "the dark brown sludge, gathering up fistfuls and stuffing it into small plastic bottles. They tap the bottles on the ground, taking care to leave enough room for [[methane]] to form at the top."&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

The effects of jenkem inhalation last for around an hour and consist of auditory and visual [[hallucinations]] for some users.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; In 1995, one user told a reporter it is "more potent than [[cannabis]]."&lt;ref name=IPS&gt;{{cite news |title=Zambia-Narcotics: 'Huffing and Puffing' to a new High |publisher=[[Inter Press Service]] |date=August 26, 1995}} (reprinted in a Snopes.com [http://www.snopes.com/crime/warnings/jenkem.asp article on jenkem], retrieved December 30, 2007.)&lt;/ref&gt; A 1999 report interviewed a user, who said, "With glue, I just hear voices in my head. But with jenkem, I see visions. I see my mother who is dead and I forget about the problems in my life."&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Fumito Ichinose, an anesthesia specialist in Boston who conducted a study on the effects of [[hydrogen sulfide]] gas, or "sewer gas," on mice, informed [[Salon (website)|Salon.com]] that holding your breath, choking, or "the inhalation of gases like those produced from jenkem could result in [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], a lack of oxygen flow to the body that could be alternately euphoric and physically dangerous."&lt;ref name=Salon/&gt;

==Media reports==

===1995–2006===
The second media description of jenkem came from an [[Inter Press Service]] wire report in 1995.&lt;ref name=IPS/&gt; According to a 1998 report in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Fountain of Hope, a [[non-profit organization]], said that jenkem was used by [[street children]] in [[Lusaka]], [[Zambia]] to obtain a "powerful high".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Suzanne |last=Daley |title=In Zambia, the Abandoned Generation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/18/world/in-zambia-the-abandoned-generation.html?pagewanted=2 |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=September 18, 1998 |accessdate=2015-03-11}} (Spelled ''Jekem'')&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Project Concern International Zambia and Fountain of Hope released a report entitled "Rapid Assessment of Street Children In Lusaka", where jenkem is listed as the third most popular drug among Lusaka's street children, following [[Cannabis sativa|Dagga]] (Cannabis) and "glue and Dagga" but ahead of "Ballan" (uncured tobacco) and [[Gasoline|petrol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

John C. Zulu, director of the Ministry of Sport, Youth and Child Development in Zambia, said in November 2007 that jenkem usage is less common than [[glue-sniffing]] and, "Initially, they used to get it from the sewer, but they make it anywhere ... They say it keeps them warm and makes them fearless."&lt;ref name=Salon/&gt; In 1999, [[BBC News]] ran a story about jenkem.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; In 2004, South African weekly investigative newspaper ''[[Mail &amp; Guardian]]'' mentioned jenkem abuse in a report on Zambia's street children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Zarina |last=Geloo |title=Bleak outlook for Zambia's street kids |url=http://mg.co.za/article/2004-12-29-bleak-outlook-for-zambias-street-kids |publisher=[[Mail &amp; Guardian]] |date=December 24, 2004 |accessdate=2015-03-11 |quote=Marijuana was used most commonly, along with glue for sniffing, jenkem (fermented sewage), petrol and cocaine.

===2007 to present===
[[File:Jenkem1.jpg|thumb|The Collier County Sheriff Office intelligence bulletin from September 26, 2007 which was later leaked to the media.]]

On September 26, 2007, the Sheriff's Department of [[Collier County, Florida]] issued an internal bulletin about jenkem based on a [[TOTSE]] internet forum post by user "Pickwick", which included purported photos of the manufacture and use.&lt;ref name=smokinggun/&gt; "Pickwick" confessed it was a hoax around the time of the internal bulletin.&lt;ref name=wasahoax&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.totse.com/community/showthread.php?t=2055429 |title=The jenkem thing was a hoax |last=pickwick |work=TOTSE |publisher=totse.com |accessdate=17 September 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080728042704/http://www.totse.com/community/showthread.php?t=2055429 |archivedate=2008-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November of that year, officials at the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] said no reports of jenkem use had been confirmed in the United States.&lt;ref name=goldman2007&gt;{{cite news |last=Goldman |first=Russell |title='Jenkem': Stay Alert or Call It a Hoax? |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Drugs/Story?id=3834092&amp;page=1 |format= |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=November 7, 2007 |accessdate=2007-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After initially classifying stories of Western jenkem use as "undetermined", [[Snopes]] quickly reclassified it as "false". [[About.com]] also concluded reports were "based on faulty [[Internet research]]".&lt;ref name=UrbanLegend/&gt; [[The Smoking Gun]] stated the Collier County alert "may be full of shit".&lt;ref name=NewDrugAlert!-Nov5.2007&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2007/1105072jenkem1.html |title=NewDrugAlert!-Nov5.2007 |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drug research site [[Erowid]] reported, "the jenkem stories that have been circulating in the U.S. media are almost certainly the strange result of a hoax."&lt;ref&gt;Vaults of Erowid (November 2007).

[[Image:Katastrofa hali Katowice, 2006.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Hall after collapse.]]
On 28 January 2006, the roof of one of the buildings at the [[Katowice International Fair]] (''Międzynarodowe Targi Katowickie'') collapsed in [[Chorzów]] / [[Katowice]], Poland&lt;!---[[Chorzów]] (land buildings) and [[Katowice]] (address and main street to KIF)---&gt;.

At 16:15 GMT (17:15 local time), the central section of the roof of the hall collapsed, possibly due to the weight of snow on the building. According to the [[Policja|police]] there were roughly 700 people in the hall at the time of the collapse. A further collapse occurred 90 minutes later during rescue operations. [[Polish government]] spokesman [[Krzysztof Mejer]] confirmed that there had been 65 dead as well as more than 170 injured, including 13 foreigners. There are confirmed deaths of ten foreign tourists – one from [[Belgium]], one from Germany, three from [[Slovakia]], one from the [[Netherlands]], one from [[Hungary]] and three from the [[Czech Republic]]. The trade hall was hosting the 56th National Exhibition of [[Carrier Pigeon]]s, with over 120 exhibitors from all over Europe. Poland was at that time experiencing very cold weather with heavy snow. This meant that the [[rescue]] operation was undertaken in sub-zero temperatures, putting the survivors inside the building at risk of exposure.

==Rescue operation==
Rescue support was sent from the surrounding area, including Katowice, as well as from the neighbouring province of [[Lesser Poland]]. Since parts of the collapsed structure were supported only by heaps of snow, the rescue teams could not heat the pockets beneath the collapsed roof with hot air, fearing that the roof might collapse even further.

The [[search and rescue]] action was terminated on the afternoon of Sunday 29 January 2006 as, according to [[Janusz Skulich]], commander of the [[Silesia]]n Fire Fighters, the probability of rescuing any more survivors from beneath the collapsed roof was by then close to zero. Heavy equipment is reported to have started clearing the area of the remaining rubble.

The rescue action was carried out by 103 firefighter teams (more than 1000 fire fighters altogether), [[Emergency medical services in Poland|EMS]] units as well as 230 policemen with dogs, military police units from [[Kraków]] and [[Gliwice]], the [[GOPR]] [[mountain rescue]] team of [[Szczyrk]] and specialists from the [[mine rescue]] team of [[Bytom]]. Survivors were taken to nearby hospitals in [[Chorzów]] and [[Katowice]], and to other towns of the region, including [[Siemianowice Śląskie]], [[Bytom]], [[Sosnowiec]], [[Ruda Śląska]], [[Dąbrowa Górnicza]] and [[Piekary Śląskie]]. [[Andrzej Skrzyś]], vice-president of [[Polish Society of Carrier-Pigeons]] said that by Saturday the rescue services had brought over 1,000 pigeons to the office of the society, that were being fed and watered by pigeon-fanciers from Chorzów until the arrival of their owners.

On 30 January 2006 there were 67 confirmed deaths and about 30 missing people. Later that day the number of victims was revised down to 62 confirmed deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Poland cuts death toll from cave-inof roof to 62|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/30/world/europe/30iht-poland.html|work=New York Times|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 January three more bodies were found in the ruins of MTK, raising the death toll to 65. Next day, officials stated that due to irregularities by funeral houses and dissection rooms, the wrong number of victims had been reported, and on 1 February there were 63 confirmed deaths. On 11 and 14 February the bodies of the 64th and 65th victims of roof collapse were found.

In the morning of 19 February workers got to the last area of the hall that was still covered by fragments of the hall’s collapsed roof. They found no more victims but found two pigeons that were still alive after spending 22 days trapped under the rubble.

==Aftermath and investigation==
After the tragedy, senior authorities arrived at the scene, including the Prime Minister [[Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz]] and the President of Poland [[Lech Kaczyński]]. The latter declared the period until 1 February to be [[National day of mourning|national days of mourning]].

On Tuesday, 21 February, at 0600 hours Central European Time (0500 UTC) three people were arrested and brought to the Katowice District Prosecutor’s Office: New Zealand–born chairman of the International Katowice Fair Board of Management Bruce Robinson (who was also a Managing Director of the London–based Expomedia company that owned a 51% share in MTK), deputy chairman Ryszard Ziółek, and the company’s technical manager Adam Hildebrandt. They were interviewed and charged with criminal negligence – allegedly they were aware of the fact that the building was unsafe and yet allowed the Fair to go on, and by doing so they contributed to deaths of 65 people. The spokesperson for the Prosecutor’s Office did not rule out laying other charges in the future – depending on facts established by experts on causes of the building’s collapse. A search warrant was also executed at Mr. Robinson’s Warsaw apartment. The charges carried a maximum of 8 years imprisonment. Prosecutors also applied to the court for the accused to be detained for 3 months. The application was granted by the court, their application for bail was refused. A judge is quoted as saying that immediately after the catastrophe the accused destroyed some vital documents and there exists a possibility that if they were released on bail they would intimidate witnesses to change their testimonies. Their appeal against arrest was rejected by the District Court on 5 May.

After interviewing some 200 witnesses, the analysis of company documents, experts’ findings and data from the company’s computers (some of which was recovered by computer specialists) the prosecutors allege that the accused were responsible for failing to remove heavy snow and ice from the building’s roof, and also that in the past, the roof had gotten damaged and yet they carried out only emergency repairs and did not report the damage to a building inspector as required by Polish law. Earlier the managers claimed both that the snow was removed from the roof and that it was impossible for them to clear the roof because a Tax Office seized their accounts due to tax arrears. A spokesperson for the Tax Office refuted this claim saying that only some of the company’s cash was seized and amounts remaining should have been more than sufficient to pay for snow and ice removal.

On 31 March 2006 the commission investigating causes of the disaster released a preliminary report into their findings. They found numerous design and construction flaws that contributed to the speed of the collapse. The snow from the roof was not being removed which resulted in construction overload by more than 100%. Moreover, in 2002 the construction buckled under the heavy snow; contrary to the regulations the hall was repaired without getting a building inspector’s clearance and without doing necessary tests and calculations to determine if the construction was stable and had sufficient strength.

On Monday, 26 June 2006, three architects who designed the hall were arrested. Two were charged with "wilfully causing a building catastrophe" and by this causing the death of 65 people, the third one was charged with "involuntarily causing a building catastrophe." The prosecutor alleges that Jacek J. and Szczepan K. made several errors and introduced several amendments to the project that were not agreed upon. Both were aware of the fact that in January 2000 the roof buckled under the weight of the snow, yet they did not take any steps to remedy the situation and perhaps prevent the tragedy. The third architect, Andrzej W., is charged with approving the project despite its errors and deficiencies. The charges are the result of reports made by experts on building, steel constructions and reinforced concrete constructions. Pursuant to Polish law that automatically grants the accused name suppression, the surnames of the accused are unavailable in the Polish media.

On 14 February 2007 the Court of Appeal in Katowice granted bail to the three top bosses of the company – Bruce Robinson, Ryszard Ziółek, and Adam Hildebrandt. Mr. Robinson had to pay a 100,000 zloty bond (approx. €25,000/$33,000/£17,000), and the other two – 50,000 zloty each. All three also had to remain under police supervision and had to surrender their passports. The prosecutor appealed against granting of bail while one of the accused appealed against the amount. On Monday, the 5 March 2007, the Court of Appeal in Katowice rejected both appeals and at the same time raised the amount that Bruce Robinson has to deposit to 300,000 zloty (about €75,000/$100,000/£50,000). The ruling was final.

As a result of the catastrophe, in March 2007 Polish building law was amended. Large buildings must now undergo a technical survey twice every year (before and after winter) to make sure they are safe and structurally sound. Failure to conduct the survey is punishable by a minimum 1,000 zloty fine or a term in prison.

==Indictment and trial==

The investigation was formally completed at the end of June 2008. The public prosecutor of the Katowice District Public Prosecutor’s Office decided to indict 12 people. These include the designers of the hall, Jacek J. and Szczepan K., who on conviction for “directly endangering lives of other people” faced up to 12 years of prison, two members of the board, Bruce Robinson and Ryszard Ziółek, and 7 other people, who if convicted for gross negligence would face up to 8 years in jail, and the Chorzów County building inspector who faced lesser charges. The indictment was filed with the court on 18 July.

The experts determined that the main reason for the catastrophe was incorrect design. It was changed in order to make the construction cheaper. Emails recovered from seized computers proved that members of the Board of Directors were fully aware of the problems and of an expert’s recommendation that snow be removed from the roof and that the design was verified. One of the indicted, technical coordinator Piotr I., was charged with failing to order the evacuation doors to be opened; he is the only one that pleaded guilty. In the course of the investigation it was found that none of the victims died because of locked evacuation doors.

Post-mortems carried out on victims have shown that none of them died of exposure; all died because of injuries sustained because of the collapse of the roof.

==Location of MTK==
There has been some confusion over whether MTK is located in Katowice or Chorzów. The registered and street addresses of the company are in Katowice, and the entrance to the grounds is from a street that belongs administratively to Katowice. However, the company’s grounds—and thus the site of the catastrophe—lie within Chorzów’s administrative boundaries. &lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://www.chorzow.um.gov.pl/index.php4?ID=113848898720415286 official explanation and map of the Katowice-Chorzów boundary]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Leyenda de Plata''''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "the Silver Legend") is an annual [[lucha libre]] [[tournament]] held by the [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[professional wrestling promotion]] [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) since 1998. The tournament honors [[El Santo]], ''Enmáscarado de Plata'' (the Silver mask) and has been held every year since 1998 except for 2003 when [[El Hijo del Santo]] (El Santo's son) did not work for CMLL.&lt;ref name=Leyenda&gt;{{cite web | url= http://superluchas.net/2008/07/25/el-torneo-leyenda-de-plata/ | title= Torneo Leyenda de Plata | date= July 25, 2008 | author= | accessdate= September 23, 2009 | publisher=''SuperLuchas'' Magazine | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; CMLL still holds the annual tournament despite El Hijo del Santo no longer works for CMLL. It is the most prestigious of all of CMLL's annual tournaments. The original format of the tournament was the ''[[Torneo cibernetico]]'' to qualify for a semi-final. The winner of the semi-final faces the winner of the previous year's tournament in the final. Since 2005 CMLL has held two cibernetico matches and the winner of each then meet in the semi-final. In 2011, the tournament was modified to eliminate the final stage. The winner is given a plaque with a solid silver ''El Santo'' mask on it. Only two wrestlers have won ''Leyend de Plata'' more than once, [[Místico]] won it in 2006, 2007 and 2008 and [[Negro Casas]] in 2000, 2014 and 2015. After a two-year hiatus, the tournament returned in 2011.

The first ever ''Leyenda de Plata'' tournament was held in 1998 from July 24 to July 31 in ''[[Arena Mexico]]'', [[Mexico City, Mexico]]. The tournament was held to commemorate the 15 year anniversary of [[El Santo]]'s death in 1983. Unlike later tournaments there was no final, instead El Santo's son, [[El Hijo del Santo]], faced the winner of the ''Cibernetico'' to determine the first winner. [[Scorpio Jr.]] won the ''cibernetico'', outlasting [[Atlantis (wrestler)|Atlantis]], [[Shocker (wrestler)|Shocker]], [[Olímpico]], [[Pantera (wrestler)|Pantera]], [[El Felino]], [[Negro Casas]], [[Tony Rivera]], [[La Fiera]], [[Dr. Wagner Jr.]], [[Blue Panther]], [[Satánico]], [[Karloff Lagarde Jr.]], [[Black Warrior (wrestler)|Black Warrior]], [[Último Guerrero]] and [[Violencia]].

The qualifying ''Cibernetico'' took place on November 26, 1999 and saw El Hijo del Santo outlast a field of 15 other wrestlers including [[Antifaz (wrestler)|Antifaz del Norte]], [[Bestia Salvaje]], [[Black Warrior (wrestler)|BlacK warrior]], [[Blue Panther]], [[Emilio Charles Jr.]], [[El Felino]], [[Fuerza Guerrera]], [[Negro Casas]], [[Olímpico]], [[Rey Bucanero]], [[Satánico]], [[Tarzan Boy (wrestler)|Tarzan Boy]], [[Tony Rivera]], [[Último Guerrero]] and [[Zumbido]]. El Hijo del Santo only eliminated one wrestler in the match, Último Guerrero to qualify for the final. Like in 1998 the 1999 ''Leyenda de Plata'' cibernetico winner went straight to the final, a rematch from the 1998 tournament, only this time El Hijo del Santo defeated Scorpio Jr. to win the tournament named after his father.&lt;ref name=Plata1999/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeyendaSL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LdP1999"&gt;{{cite news | author = Box y Lucha staff | title = Segunda Leyenda de Plata | work = Box y Lucha Magazine | pages= 3&amp;ndash;6 | id = issue 2432 | date = December 14, 1999 | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third annual ''Leyenda de Plata'' started on September 22, 2000, with a 16-man ''tornero cibernetico''. Unlike in 1998 and 1999, CMLL added a semi-final match to the tournament as the last two wrestlers in the ''cibernetico'' would meet in a singles match the following week. The semi-finalsts were [[Dr. Wagner Jr.]] and [[Negro Casas]], outlasting [[Antifaz (wrestler)|Antifaz del Norte]], [[Atlantis (wrestler)|Atlantis]], [[Mephisto (wrestler)|Astro Rey Jr.]], [[Black Warrior (wrestler)|Black Warrior]], [[Blue Panther]], [[El Felino]], [[Fuerza Guerrera]], [[Olímpico]], [[Rey Bucanero]], [[Ephesto|Safari]], [[Satánico]], [[Scorpio Jr.]], [[Tarzan Boy (wrestler)|Tarzan Boy]] and [[Zumbido]]. The two survivors faced off in a singles match the following week, which Negro Casas won. On October 6, 2000, Negro Casas defeated El Hijo del Santo to win the 2000 ''Leyenda de Plata''.&lt;ref name=Leyenda/&gt;&lt;ref name=Plata2000/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeyendaSL"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Canoe2000&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingInternational/mexico_timeline-can.html | title=SLAM!

The 2001 ''Leyenda de Plata'' was the fourth annual tournament and the first tournament to feature a [[Battle Royal]] to determine the two teams for the cibernetico. The first eight men eliminated from the battle royal would be one team and the remaining eight wrestlers would form the other team in the cibernetico match that followed immediately after the battle royal. Team "A" consisted of [[Averno (wrestler)|Averno]], [[Black Warrior (wrestler)|Black Warrior]], [[Black Tiger III|Black Tiger]], [[Fuerza Guerrera]], [[Juventud Guerrera]], [[Dr. Wagner Jr.]], [[Mephisto (wrestler)|Mephisto]] and [[Antonio Gómez Medina|Másacara Mágica]]. Team "B" consisted of [[Antifaz (wrestler)|Antifaz]], [[Atlantis (wrestler)|Atlantis]], [[Blue Demon Jr.]], [[El Hijo del Santo]], [[El Felino]], [[Ricky Marvin]], [[Ephesto|Safari]] and [[Virus (wrestler)|Virus]]. The last two survivors were Black Warrior and Black Tiger III, both from Team "A". On October 12, 2001, Black Warrior and BlacK Tiger III faced off in a singles match that Black Warrior won. The [[narrative thread|storyline]] of the match was Black Tiger III turning ''Rudo'' ([[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] or "bad guy") while Black Warrior was turning ''Tecnico'' ([[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] or "good guy") during the course of the match. The following week Black Warrior's momentum helped him gain the victory over Negro Casas to win the 2001 ''Leyenda de Plata''.&lt;ref name=Leyenda/&gt;&lt;ref name=Plata2001/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeyendaSL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LdP2001"&gt;{{cite news | author = Box y Lucha staff | title = Black Warrior Ganador! | work = Box y Lucha Magazine | pages= 3&amp;ndash;6 | id = issue 2531 | date = November 11, 2001 | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After not holding a ''Leyenda de Plata'' tournament in 2003, it returned in 2004 with the qualifying ''cibernetico'' being held on July 16, 2004.&lt;ref name=Leyenda/&gt; the teams were: "A", [[Alan Stone (wrestler)|Alan Stone]], [[Atlantis (wrestler)|Atlantis]], [[Averno (wrestler)|Averno]], [[Mephisto (wrestler)|Mephisto]], [[Misterioso Jr.]], [[Satánico]], [[Tarzan Boy (wrestler)|Tarzan Boy]] and [[Virus (wrestler)|Virus]]. Team "B", [[Black Warrior (wrestler)|Black Warrior]], [[Perro Aguayo Jr.]], [[Emilio Charles Jr.]], [[Antonio Gómez Medina|Másacara Mágica]], [[Místico]], [[Negro Casas]], [[Super Crazy]] and [[Volador Jr.]]. The main storyline of the ''cibernetico'' was the building rivalry between Negro Casas and the recently ''rudo''-turned Perro Aguayo Jr. Aguayo cheated to eliminate Negro Casas and along with Atlantis were the last two surviving wrestlers. On July 23, 2004 Aguayo and Atlantis wrestled in a singles match, which unlike previous years was a "best of three falls" match, that actually went to four falls before Perro Aguayo Jr. won. A week later Perro Aguayo Jr. defeated El Felino, using the victory to further the storyline with Negro Casas, Felino's brother and corner-man for the night. Following his victory Perro Aguayo Jr. broke the plaque with El Santo's mask on it, claiming that the Aguayo's were the greatest family in wrestling, refusing to accept a trophy with El Santo's name on it.&lt;ref name=Leyenda/&gt;&lt;ref name=Plata2004/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeyendaSL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LdP2004"&gt;{{cite news | author = Rivera, Miguel | title = Leyenda de Plata! | work = Super Luchas | id = issue 65 | date = August 8, 2004 | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2005 ''Leyenda de Plata'' is the only tournament to not feature the previous year's champion defending the trophy, playing off Aguayo's breaking of the trophy the previous year.&lt;ref name=Leyenda/&gt; The lack of defending champion forced CMLL to change the format of the ''Leyenda de Plata'' as they held two eight-man ''ciberneticos'' instead of one 16-man, with the winner of each cibernetico facing each other the following week. The two ''cibernetico'' format has been the standard tournament format for the ''Leyenda de Plata'' ever since 2005. The first cibernetico took place on October 28, 2005 and featured  [[El Hijo del Santo]], [[Ephesto|Hombre Sin Nombre]], [[La Mascara (wrestler)|La Máscara]], [[Volador Jr.]], [[Misterioso Jr.]], [[Jado]], [[Averno (wrestler)|Averno]] and [[Negro Casas]]. The match came down to Hijo del Santo and Casas and initially ended in a double pin. After the match was restarted El Hijo del Santo won by submission. The second ''cibernetico'' took place on November 4 and saw [[Atlantis (wrestler)|Atlantis]] outlast a field that also included [[Místico]], [[Último Dragón]], [[Maximo (wrestler)|Máxmio]], [[El Sagrado]], [[Mephisto (wrestler)|Mephisto]], Hijo de Pierroth and [[Gedo (wrestler)|Gedo]]. On November 11, 2005, Atlantis defeated El Hijo del Santo with help from his corner-man [[Último Guerrero]] to win the seventh ''Leyenda de Plata''.&lt;ref name=Leyenda/&gt;&lt;ref name=Plata2005/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeyendaSL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LdP2005"&gt;{{cite news | author = Rivera, Miguel | title = Leyenda de Plata! | work = Super Luchas | id = issue 132 | date = November 20, 2005 | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2006 ''Leyenda de Plata'' started on August 25, 2006 with the first of two eight-man ''cibernetico'' qualifying matches. The ''cibernetico'' saw [[Black Warrior (wrestler)|Black Warrior]] eliminate [[Rey Bucanero]] as the last man in a match that also included [[Heavy Metal (wrestler)|Heavy Metal]], Metro II, [[La Mascara (wrestler)|La Máscara]], [[Último Guerrero]], [[Mephisto (wrestler)|Mephisto]] and [[Misterioso Jr.]]. With Black Warrior winning the first ''cibernetico'' it was not too surprising that [[Místico]] won the second ''cibernetico'' as the two had been involved with a long-running storyline feud throughout 2006. Místico outlasted [[Mr. Águila]], [[Negro Casas]], [[El Sagrado]], [[Volador Jr.]], [[Averno (wrestler)|Averno]] and [[Alex Koslov]]. The semi-final on September 8, 2006, saw Místico defeat Black Warrior, followed by a "mask vs. mask", ''[[Lucha libre#Luchas de Apuestas|Luchas de Apuesta]]'' challenge from Black Warrior that Místico accepted for the [[CMLL 73rd Anniversary Show]]. On September 15, 2006 Místico defeated Atlantis to win the ''Leyeda de Plata'', overcoming interference from Atlantis' corner-man Black Warrior. After the match Black Warrior stole the ''Leyenda de Plata'' trophy and ran off with it, furthering their feud.&lt;ref name=Leyenda/&gt;&lt;ref name=Plata2006/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeyendaSL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LdP2006"&gt;{{cite news | author = Rivera, Miguel | title = Leyenda de Plata! | work = Super Luchas | id = issue 177 | date = October 1, 2006 | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ninth ''Leyenda de Plata'' was held between May 18 and June 8, 2007. This was the first year that ''Leyenda de Plata'' was held without [[El Hijo del Santo]] working for CMLL, CMLL claimed that they owned the rights to promote the ''Leyenda de Plata'' and has promoted it without Hijo del Santo working for CMLL since then. The first ''Cibernetico'' took place on May 18, [[Perro Aguayo Jr.]] was originally scheduled to be part of the match, hinting at a very anticipated Aguayo vs. [[Místico]] match that had been building for a while. In the weeks leading up to the first ''cibernetico'' Perro Aguayo Jr. was injured and had to pull out of the match, he was replaced by fellow ''[[Los Perros del Mal]]'' member [[Mr. Águila]], who'd go on to win the qualifier over [[Negro Casas]], [[El Felino]], [[Tarzan Boy (wrestler)|Tarzan Boy]], [[Mephisto (wrestler)|Mephisto]], [[Maximo (wrestler)|Máximo]], [[Alex Koslov]], [[Stuka Jr.]], [[Volador Jr.]] and [[Mictlán (wrestler)|Mictlán]]. On May 25, 2007 [[El Sagrado]] qualified for his first ever ''Leyenda'' semi-final as he outlasted [[Averno (wrestler)|Averno]], [[Ephesto]], [[Virus (wrestler)|virus]], [[El Texano Jr.]], [[Leono]], [[Loco Max]], [[Valiente (wrestler)|Valiente]], [[Heavy Metal (wrestler)|Heavy Metal]] and [[Black Warrior (wrestler)|BlacK Warrior]].&lt;ref name="LdP2007-semi"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://superluchas.net/2007/06/02/resultados-arena-mexico-1-jun-07/

The '''2016 ''Leyenda de Plata''''' (Spanish for "Silver Legend") was anannual [[professional wrestling]] tournament held by the Mexican [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] ("World Wrestling Council" in English; CMLL) that is slated to start on July 15, 2016. The ''Leyenda de Plata'' tournament honors ''[[lucha libre]]'' legend [[El Santo]] and has been held on an almost-annual schedule since 1998. The tournament consists of a ''[[torneo cibernetico]]'' elimination match as the first round and the winner of that match would face the previous' year's winner in the finals. For the 2016 tournament CMLL originally announced that the [[#Leyenda de Plata 2015|2015 tournament winner]], [[Negro Casas]], was part of the initial field, but later replaced him with [[Dragon Lee II|Dragon Lee]] to keep the original format intact.

This is a '''list of close [[election]] results''' at [[Nation-state|national]] and [[State (administrative division)|state]] level.

It lists results that have been decided by a margin of less than 1 vote in 1000 (a margin of victory of less than 0.1%). To provide context, after the first table is another table showing the distribution of winning margins in different areas. Depending on the area, from 1 in 40 to 1 in 500 election contests is decided by less than 1 vote in 1000. This list is limited to elections in which at least 1000 votes were cast.

According to a 2001 study of state and federal elections in the United States between 1898 and 1992, "one of every 100,000 votes cast in U.S. elections, and one of every 15,000 votes cast in state elections, "mattered" in the sense that they were cast for a candidate that officially tied or won by one vote."&lt;ref name="pivotal"/&gt;

While not an election, a member of Congress once owed his seat to the drawing of lots. In 1902, after more than 7000 votes at three conventions, the Democrats were unable to decide among three candidates for nomination to [[Texas's 12th congressional district]]. Two candidates put their names in a hat, drew one out and the loser agreed to withdraw and support the winner. [[Oscar W. Gillespie]] won the game of lots, the nomination and the following general election, serving in Congress for 8 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gillespie is Nominated|url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86090049/1902-09-10/ed-1/seq-2.pdf|accessdate=27 December 2017|work=The San Angelo Press|date=10 September 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a variety of ways in which tied elections are settled. Some are decided by drawing lots or other games of chances. Others lead to a runoff or special election. Still others are decided by some third party such as the legislature or a high-ranking elected official. In one case in [[Crawfordsville, Indiana]], in 1891, it was settled with a 200-yard footrace. In that case William Simms seemed to be cruising to an easy victory for County Treasurer when he tripped and fell 3 yards from the finish line allowing Frank Hollowell to win the race instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crawled over the Line|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16439766/|accessdate=11 January 2018|work=The Pensacola News|date=10 May 1891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Table of close national and state elections==
&lt;!-- In the table below, Margin % refers to the (margin in votes)/(total number of votes cast for the two close candidates). Do not include blank votes or votes for other candidates --&gt;

|The initial vote count had [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] William Moss ahead of Democrat Jim Burch by 1 vote for the sixth at-large seat in what was then a six-member district. But then a three-judge circuit court ruled that one of the ballots was "defaced" because the names of two candidates were crossed out with the notation "Do not desire to vote for these two". They did this even though the person who cast this vote (which was known because it was a signed absentee ballot) testified that he intended to vote for Moss. Throwing out the ballot created a tied vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whitaker|first1=Joseph|title=Youth, 18, Says He Cast Vote That, Thrown Out, Tied Race|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2017/12/31/elections-gone-wild-the-teen-who-messed-up-his-absentee-ballot-creating-va-s-last-tied-race/|accessdate=5 January 2018|work=Washington Post|date=25 December 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names of the two candidates were placed in sealed envelopes, and a blindfolded Elections Board chairman plucked one from a silver [[Loving cup|loving cup]].

|Four candidates Democrats John R. McIntyre and Dick Casey; and, Republicans Hal Wick and Judy Rost were contesting two seats. In the initial tally, they had respectively 4195 (24.73%), 3889 (22.93%), 4191 (24.71%), and 4687 (27.63%) votes (16,962 total votes). McIntyre was initially declared to have been elected by a four-vote margin. Wick petitioned for a recount in accordance with SDCL 12-21-12. The recount was conducted in the presence of representatives for both candidates. The results were certified on December 4, 1996, and showed that Wick had been elected by one vote: 4191 (24.71%), 3891 (22.94%), 4192 (24.71%), 4689 (27.64%) (16,963 total votes). The [[South Dakota Supreme Court]] examined several ballots and invalidated one vote for Wick. The House then voted, mostly along party lines, 46–20 to seat Wick.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ujs.sd.gov/Supreme_Court/opiniondetail.aspx?ID=947|title=Opinion|website=ujs.sd.gov|access-date=2017-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sdsos.gov/elections-voting/election-resources/election-history/1996/1996_general_election_returns_legislative_races.aspx|title=Election Resources: South Dakota Secretary of State, Shantel Krebs|website=sdsos.gov|access-date=2017-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remarkably, two years later, McIntyre and Wick would again tie (at least on the initial count).

|Daniel Kelso was initially up one vote on David Henry: 917-916. This election was extensively contested. It was alleged that two additional votes had been incorrectly given to Kelso, so that Henry had in fact won 916–915. There was also one fraudulent vote found in favor of Henry, so the Senate Committee concluded that the correct vote was 915–915. But the Committee also found that the county provision in case of a tie (to let county officials decide the winner) was unconstitutional, and so they reported that no legal election had taken place in Switzerland County and neither Henry nor Kelso won.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wd0fAQAAMAAJ|title=Journal of the Senate of the State of Indiana at Their ...

Also:

"It has been repeated time and again that the annexation of Texas was carried in the United States Senate by one vote; that Edward A. Hannegan, then the United States Senator from Indiana was elected to the Senate by one vote, and that that one vote was given Hannegan by Daniel Kelso, then senator from Switzerland County, who was elected by one majority.

"This is an error, for Kelso, when he voted for Hannegan as United States Senator, represented Switzerland County by virtue of a majority of about 150 voters of the county, over Samuel Howard at the August election of 1842. In 1843 David Henry was elected over Kelso by one majority. Kelso contested the election, and the Senate declared that neither was elected, and sent them back to the people for decision, and at the August election, 1844, Henry was elected by a small but decided majority."

(An apocryphal story continues to be told, for example by [http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=121726 ABC News], about a "David Kelso" winning by one vote in an 1844 Indiana Senate election, the one vote being the vote of a dying man whom "David Kelso" once defended.)

|[[Marcus Morton]] and the incumbent [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] [[Edward Everett]] received 51,034–50,725 votes respectively, with the remaining 307 votes went to scattering. The constitution of Massachusetts required a candidate to receive a majority of votes cast in order to win the office outright; otherwise, the legislature would have the authority to choose among the leading candidates. Morton exceeded this threshold by just 1 vote (50% of the 102,066 ballots cast), and had he not, the Whig controlled legislature would have been allowed to select the governor. The legislature could successfully deprive Morton of a majority if it disqualified the return from the town of Westfield. There was, moreover, an argument for doing so: the Westfield return was irregular and improper under the laws of the state because the attestation of its authenticity was not under seal. Instead, the return had been sealed first, and only afterward affixed with an attestation from the relevant local official. Despite pressure from partisans to contest this result, Everett refused. In the annals of American history there is not an equivalent example of a candidate in a major statewide election willing to forgo a victory so tantalizingly within reach based on, first, such a narrow margin and, second, such a readily available legal argument for invalidating disputed ballots.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=zP7DCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT103&lt;/ref&gt;

|On the initial tally, incumbent Democrat [[James C. Allen]] was ahead of challenger Republican William B. Archer by one vote: 8452–8451.
Archer contested. Livingston precinct had initially certified Allen and Archer's votes as 47–100 (in that precinct). But they later certified that they had made a mistake and the vote (in that precinct) should instead have been 46–102. In which case the overall vote should have been 8451–8453.

The Committee of Elections concluded that Allen had won by at least 1 and probably 2 votes and recommended that he be seated. However, the House voted 94–90 that Allen would not be seated and also voted 91–89 that Archer would not be seated either. The seat was thus vacated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hUAFAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA811|title=The Congressional Globe ...|date=1856|publisher=Printed at the Globe Office for the editors}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NG8LAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA169|title=Congressional Serial Set|date=1865|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|South Carolina was readmitted to Congress in 1868, after passage of the 14th Amendment. That amendment ended the three-fifths rule effectively raising the population of states that once had slavery. As a result, South Carolina and other slave states tried to seat extra members of Congress. South Caroline choose two additional congress members during at-large election. In one of those, Johann Peter Martin Epping defeated Lucius W. Wimbush by 61 votes: 71803-71742. But the House refused to seat him and the other at-large winner. "A number of southern states upon readmission claimed that since their slaves were emancipated, they were entitled to larger delegations in the House. Epping's election falls in this category. The claims were rejected by the House."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nqAaAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=epping+71803+wimbush+71742|title=Guide to U.S. elections|last=Press|first=C.

|On election night, Democrat Robert Emond was declared the victor over incumbent Republican Sydney Nixon by one vote. Nixon then petitioned for a recount in Windham Superior Court under the provisions of 17 V.S.A. § 1361. The recount committee in that court found Nixon to be the winner by one vote and the court gave him a certificate of election.
However, a House committee did its own recount and found Emond to be the winner by one vote (572–571 according to one site&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.townofmiddleton.org/Pages/MiddletonMA_Clerk/power?textPage=1|title=Town of Middleton&amp;nbsp;– The Power of One Vote|last=Middleton|first=Town of|website=www.townofmiddleton.org|access-date=2017-07-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211115551/http://townofmiddleton.org/Pages/MiddletonMA_Clerk/power?textPage=1|archivedate=2017-02-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The margin was effectively one vote at that point in the count, and depending on which party was ahead either the Labor Party and PUP or the Sports Party and the Greens would have been elected.
As the recount was taking place it became apparent that there were some missing ballots, which was greater than the margin, so the election was voided and a re-run was conducted in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-11-08/wa-senate-result-came-down-to-just-one-vote/5080162|title=WA Senate result came down to just one vote|date=2013-11-08|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-08-29|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16615">The '''guest list at the [[wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer]]''' on 29 July 1981 included many members of [[royal families]] from across the world, republican heads of state, and members of the bride's and groom's families. As [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] was heir to the British throne, the event was automatically deemed a "state occasion", formally requiring the invitation of many foreign heads of state; in addition, the marriage of the prince, who remained a bachelor until the age of 32, to the 20-year-old [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Lady Diana]] drew much attention from across the world. The guest list for the wedding, which took place at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in [[London]], included 3,500 people.&lt;ref name="bbcWeddingDay"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/29/newsid_2494000/2494949.stm|title=1981: Charles and Diana marry|date= 29 July 1982|accessdate=13 October 2008|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24429">The '''Michelin Cup''' refers to a number of competitions sponsored by the French tyre manufacturer [[Michelin]] for long distance flight made in [[aeroplane]]s.
[[File:Coupemichelin.jpg|thumb|]]
The first Michelin prize was announced in March 1908. The principal prize, to be awarded annually for an initial period of eight years, was a prize for long distance flight, and consisted of a bronze statue as a trophy (valued at 10,000 FF-[[French francs]]) and a money prize of 20,000 FF. The flying club of the winner also received a replica of the trophy if they did not already own one. Administration and determination of the exact conditions for each year were delegated to the [[Aéro-Club de France]] (AeCF). Attempts to win the prize could be made anywhere in the world where there was a flying club associated with the AeCF.

At the same time, '''Prix d'Aviation Michelin''' was a special prize of 100,000 francs offered for a flight by an aircraft carrying a passenger, taking off from either the department of [[Seine]] or [[Seine-et-Oise]], flying over the [[Arc de Triomphe]] and the cathedral of [[Clermont-Ferrand]], and landing on the summit of the {{convert|1456|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Puy de Dôme]] inside six hours starting from the time at the Arc de Triomphe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[l'Aérophile]]|url= http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6550620m/f125.image.r=Michelin.langEN|page=115|language=French|date=March 1908|title=La Coupe d'Aviation et les Prix d'Aviation Michelin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was won by [[Eugène Renaux]] on 7 March 1911, flying a [[Farman MF.7|Maurice Farman biplane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1911/1911%20-%200205.html|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|date=11 March 1911|title =Renaux wins the Michelin Puy de Dome Prize|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, a second award, the '''British Empire Michelin Cup''', was announced, for flights made by aviators who were citizens of the British Empire, flying aircraft of all-British manufacture. The original award therefore became known as the '''International Michelin Cup'''.

When the prizes were first instituted, 25 [[French franc]]s were worth one [[pound Sterling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1909/1909%20-%200181.html|title=Prize Treatise on Aerial Navigation|date=27 March 1909|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Michelin Cup==

===1908===
Won by [[Wilbur Wright]] with a flight made on 31 December 1908 at [[Le Mans]] officially reckoned as {{convert|124.7|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The course over which the flight was made was an isosceles triangle with two sides of 1&amp;nbsp;km and a third of 200&amp;nbsp;m, totalling 2.2&amp;nbsp;km. The flight had to be made before sunset and only complete circuits counted. Wright took off at 2&amp;nbsp;pm and completed 56 circuits before sunset. He then landed, flying a further 1.5&amp;nbsp;km to set a new world distance record of 124.7&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1909/1909%20-%200022.html|date=9 Jan 1924|title=Wright's Final Effort for the 1908 Michelin Prize. |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1909===
For the greatest distance exceeding 123.2&amp;nbsp;km. in a closed circuit made before the end of the year: 20,000 francs, and a bronze replica of the Michelin trophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|title=Michelin Cup Rules for 1909  |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1909/1909%20-%200050.html|date=23 January 1909|page= 52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Won by [[Henry Farman]] with a flight of {{convert|234.212|km|mi|abbr=on}} lasting 4h 6m 25s made on 3 November 1909 at [[Châlons-en-Champagne|Chalons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[l'Aérophile]]|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65523525/f13.image.|title=Pour la Coupe Michelin|date=1 January 1911|page=7|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1910===
Won by [[Maurice Tabuteau]] flying a [[Farman MF.7|Maurice Farman biplane]] with a flight of {{convert|584.745|km|mi|abbr=on}}, taking 7hr 48m 36.6s at Buc on 30 December 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[l'Aérophile]]|url= http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65523525/f32.image.n|title=La Coupe Michelin|date=1 January 1911|page=26|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1911===
In 1911, the closing date for the competition was brought forward to 31 October.

Won by E. Helen flying a [[Nieuport II]] monoplane on 8 September 1911, when he covered {{convert|1,252.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 14&amp;nbsp;hr 7&amp;nbsp;min.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]] |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1911/1911%20-%200964.html|title=Helen wins Michelin Cup|date=4 November 1911|page=966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1912===
For the 1912 competition, the rules were considerably elaborated. The flight had to be made over a course made up of three different circuits, each starting from the same point. The first and third, each of about {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}}, had to have three or four compulsory landing-places, and the second, of {{convert|255|km|mi|abbr=on}}, one or two landing places. Refuelling was only allowed at the starting point of each circuit. The circuits had to be covered in order, and if a competitor landed somewhere other than a nominated airfield, they had to start that circuit again. For every 75&amp;nbsp;kg of useful load carried apart from the pilot and necessary fuel, a bonus of 25% was allowed on the time, up to a maximum of 100 per cent. The extra load could be made up of passengers or ballast. Competing aircraft had to carry a sealed [[barograph]], and an average speed of at least {{convert|40|kph|mph|abbr=on}} had to be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]] |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1912/1912%20-%200179.html|title=1912 International Michelin Competition|date=24 February 1912|page=179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1912 prize was not won by any competitor, and the prize money was added to the prize for the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[l'Aérophile]]|url= http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6552332d/f386.image.r=coupe%20michelin378|date=15 August 1913|title=Pour La Coupe Michelin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1913===
The 1913 competition was very different. It was awarded for the greatest distance flown on a series of consecutive days, flying over a {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} course, with a compulsory landing after each circuit.

The Cup was won by Emmanuel Helen flying a Nieuport monoplane, with a total distance of {{convert|16096.6|km|mi|abbr=on}} flown between 22 October and 29 November 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|title=Helen's Record for the Michelin Cup|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1913/1913%20-%201305.html|page=1331|date=6 December 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1914===
The nature of the competition was changed again for the 1914 competition, the prize being awarded for the fastest time over a circuit of about {{convert|3000|km|mi|abbr=on}}.
Won by [[Eugène Gilbert]] flying a Morane-Saulnier monoplane. Starting from [[Villacoublay]] at 03:04 on 8 June 1914, he flew via [[Péronne, Somme|Peronne]], [[Rheims]], [[Saint-Dizier]], [[Gray, Haute-Saône|Gray]], [[Joigny]], [[Beaune]], [[Vienne]] and [[Nimes]], landing at [[Mirande]] before reaching [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]], owing to running out of fuel. On the next day he flew via Pau, [[Saint-André-de-Cubzac|St. André de Cubzac]], [[Romorantin]], [[Angers]], [[Evreux]] and [[Calais]] back to Villacoublay, landing at 18:37 p.m, having covered a distance of {{convert|2970|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 39h 35m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1914/1914%20-%200636.html|title=Gilbert Flies Round France in Two Days|date=June 12, 1914|page=636}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[l'Aérophile]]|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6585089x/f29.image|title=Performances de la Quinzaine|page=301|date= 1 July 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1921===
After the [[First World War]], the competition was resumed in 1921. The competition was for the fastest time over a (3,000&amp;nbsp;km {1,860&amp;nbsp;mi) circuit: the French circuit was [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]]&amp;mdash;[[Amiens]]&amp;mdash;[[Mourmelon-le-Grand]]&amp;mdash;[[Saint-Dizier]]&amp;mdash;[[Dijon]]&amp;mdash;[[Joigny]]&amp;mdash;[[Beaune]]&amp;mdash;[[Lyon]]&amp;mdash;[[Nîmes]]&amp;mdash;[[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]]&amp;mdash;[[Bordeaux]]&amp;ndash;[[Romorantin]],&amp;mdash;[[Angers]]&amp;mdash;[[Évreux]]&amp;mdash;[[Calais]]&amp;mdash;Versailles, and the aircraft had to land at each of these airfields.

The result was the cause of considerable controversy. The best French time was achieved by [[Alphonse Poiré]] flying a [[Caudron C.60]], who completed the circuit in 37h 23m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1921/1921%20-%200608.html|title= The International Michelin Cup|date=8 September 1921|page= 608}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A faster time of 35h 45m over an Italian circuit was achieved by Capt Raffaele Martinetti-Bianchi&lt;ref&gt;L'Aéreophile 1-15 octobre 1921&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1921/1921%20-%200859.html|date= 29 December 1921|page=859|title=The Michelin Cup}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he had not landed at the same aerodrome as he had departed from, since this had become waterlogged and he was not allowed to land there. The dispute between the Italian authorities, who had ratified his performance, and the Aéro-Club de France was taken to a specially appointed [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] committee, which found in Martinetti's favour, but the AeCF disputed their judgement: eventually the prize was held to have been won by neither man, although in recognition of his performance the AeCF awarded the Gold Medal of the AeCF and a sum of money equal to the Michelin Prize to Poiré.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[l'Aérophile]]|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6555017m/f162.image.r=Martinetti|title=Comité de Direction|date=1 May 1923|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1922-3===
A five-year extension, with annual prizes of 20,000 francs, was announced in 1922. The time period of the annual competition was altered to run from the beginning of July in one year to the end of the following June.

Won by Capt Girier flying a [[Breguet 14]], taking 20hr 41m 57sec, covering the course [[Lyons]]&amp;mdash;[[Nimes]]&amp;mdash;[[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]]&amp;mdash;[[Bordeaux]]&amp;mdash;[[Angers]]&amp;mdash;[[Saint-Inglevert|St. Inglevert]]&amp;mdash;[[Mourmelon-le-Grand|Mourmelon]]&amp;mdash;[[Metz]]&amp;mdash;[[Strasbourg]]&amp;mdash;[[Dijon]]&amp;mdash;[[Avord]]&amp;mdash;Lyons at an average speed (including time on the ground) of {{convert|136.2|kph|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[l'Aérophile]]|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6555017m/f213.image|page=201|date=1 July 1923|title= La Coupe Michelin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1923-4===
The 1924 French circuit was [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]]&amp;mdash;[[Saint-Inglevert]]&amp;mdash;[[Valenciennes]]&amp;mdash;[[Mourmelon-le-Grand|Mourmelon]]&amp;mdash;[[Metz]]&amp;mdash;[[Strasbourg]]&amp;mdash;[[Dijon]]&amp;mdash;[[Clermont-Ferrand]]&amp;mdash;[[Lyon]]&amp;mdash;[[Nimes]]&amp;mdash;[[Toulouse]]&amp;mdash;[[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]]&amp;mdash;[[Bordeaux]]&amp;mdash;[[Angers]]&amp;mdash;Versailles

===1924-5===
Won by [[Pelletier d'Oisy]] flying a [[Blériot-SPAD S.61]], completing the course in 15h 8m.&lt;ref name=Raids&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[l'Aérophile]]|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6553816b/f203.image|title=Raids, Records et Performances|page=197|date=1 July 1925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1925-6===
At the request of the military aviation authorities, the 1925-6 competition was limited to competitors flying the principal French bombing aircraft, the [[Breguet 19]].&lt;ref name=Raids/&gt;
The best time was achieved by Capt. Coslin, with Lieut Gérard as observer, with a time of 18h 0m 24s, a speed of {{convert|163.6|kph|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[l'Aérophile]]|url= http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65547488/f205.image|title=La Coupe Michelin|date=1 July 1926|  page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since this time did not better the previous best, the cup did not change hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[l'Aérophile]]|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6553815x/f242.image|title=Les Coupe Michelin |  date=1 August 1927   |page=236  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1926-7===
There were two competitions in 1926-7, one restricted to the Breguet 19. The course for both competitions was Paris ([[Paris–Le Bourget Airport|Le Bourget]])&amp;mdash;[[Nancy, France|Nancy]]&amp;mdash;[[Metz]]&amp;mdash;[[Strasbourg]]&amp;mdash;[[Dijon]]&amp;mdash;[[Bourges]]&amp;mdash;[[Clermont-Ferrand]]&amp;mdash;[[Lyons]]&amp;mdash;[[Istres]]&amp;mdash;[[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]]&amp;mdash;[[Cazaux Air Base|Casaux]]&amp;mdash;[[Châteauroux]]&amp;mdash;[[Tours]]&amp;mdash;[[Romorantin-Lanthenay|Romorantin]]&amp;mdash;[[Chartres]]&amp;mdash;Paris, a distance of {{convert|2727.5|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[l'Aérophile]]|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65547488/f165.image|date= 1 May 1926|title=Nouvell Coupe Michelin|page=159|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main competition was won by Capitain Challes flying a [[Blériot-SPAD S.61]] in 12h 14m 37s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1927/1927%20-%200470.html|title=The Michelin Cup|date= 30 June 1927|page= 428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1928-9===
In 1928, the prize was offered for a further four years. The winning flight had to be made in France, although the competition was open to all nationalities, and the competition was restricted to single-seater aircraft with an engine of 230&amp;nbsp;hp or less. A minimum average speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} had to be maintained over the circuit, including time spent on the ground at the fifteen cities making up the circuit.&lt;ref name=F32_623&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1932/1932%20-%200671.html|date= 8 July 1932|page=623  |title=The Michelin Cup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==British Michelin cup==
In 1909, Michelin instituted a United Kingdom award, offering an annual award for five years of a trophy and £500. The competition was limited to British subjects flying aircraft of British construction. Administration of the competition was entrusted to the [[Royal Aero Club|Aero Club of Great Britain]].

===1909&amp;ndash;10===
For the first year, the flight was to be around a closed circuit made up of two or more markers, and a minimum distance of {{convert|5|mi|km}} was specified. The closing date for the first competition was 31 March 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1910/1910%20-%200189.html|page= 185|date=8 March 1910|title=The British Empire Michelin Cup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules were redefined for the 1912 competition: the No.&amp;nbsp;1 cup and cash prize of £5,000 was purely for endurance, all flying to be done between sunrise and sunset. The No.&amp;nbsp;2 cup and prize of £600 was for distance covered over a cross-country course of about {{convert|186|mi|km|abbr=on}} of the competitor's choosing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1912/1912%20-%200468.html|date=25 May 1912  |title=Notices to Members  |page=   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The No.&amp;nbsp;1 cup was won by [[Harry Hawker]] flying the [[Sopwith-Wright biplane]], with a flight lasting 8 hours 23 minutes made on 24 October 1912 at [[Brooklands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1912/1912%20-%201005.html|date=2 November 1912|title=British Duration Records|page=1005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The No.&amp;nbsp;2 cup was won by Samuel Cody flying the [[Cody V]], with a flight of 186 miles in 3hr 26m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]] |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1912/1912%20-%200946.html|title= Col.

===1913===
Michelin Cup No.&amp;nbsp;1 for the longest distance flight round the course Brooklands&amp;ndash;Hendon&amp;ndash;[[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]], with a minimum distance of 300 miles. Competitors had to make periodical stops of not less than five minutes, with engine stopped, on completing an entire circuit of the course plus one section: e.g., starting from Brooklands the competitor would pass Hendon, Farnborough, Brooklands, and alight at Hendon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|title=The British Empire Michelin Cup No. 1|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1913/1913%20-%200404.html|date= 12 April 1913|page= 412}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The prize had not been won by the closing date of 31 October 1913, so the closing date was extended to 14 November 1913.

The No.&amp;nbsp;1 Cup was won by [[Reginald H. Carr]] flying the [[Grahame-White Type X|Grahame White "Charabanc"]], with a flight of over {{convert|300|mi|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|title= Reginald H.

The No.&amp;nbsp;2 cup, for the fastest time round a circuit of the competitor's choice of about 450&amp;nbsp;km, was not awarded. Although the prize was carried over to the next year, competition was terminated by the outbreak of [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1914/1914%20-%200342.html|title=Notices to members|date=28 March 1914|page=342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar''' ('''NISAR''') mission is a joint project between [[NASA]] and [[ISRO]] to co-develop and launch a dual frequency [[synthetic aperture radar]] satellite. The satellite will be the first [[radar imaging]] satellite to use dual frequency and it is planned to be used for [[remote sensing]] to observe and understand natural processes on Earth.

==Description==
The NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar, or NISAR satellite, will provide an unprecedented detailed view of Earth by using advanced radar imaging. It is designed to observe and take measurements of some of the planet's most complex processes, including [[Disturbance (ecology)|ecosystem disturbances]], [[Ice-sheet dynamics|ice-sheet collapse]], and natural hazards such as [[earthquake]]s, [[tsunami]]s, [[volcano]]es and [[landslide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nisar.jpl.nasa.gov/ |title=NASA-ISRO SAR Mission (NISAR) |work=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] |accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the terms of the agreement, NASA will provide the mission's L-band [[synthetic aperture radar]] (SAR), a high-rate communication subsystem for science data, GPS receivers, a solid state recorder, and a payload data subsystem. ISRO will provide the [[satellite bus]], an [[S-band]] synthetic aperture radar, the launch vehicle and associated launch services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/september/us-india-to-collaborate-on-mars-exploration-earth-observing-mission/ |title=U.S., India to Collaborate on Mars Exploration, Earth-Observing Mission |work=[[NASA]] |date=Sep 30, 2014 |accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data collected from NISAR will reveal information about the evolution and state of Earth's crust, help scientists better understand our planet's processes and [[Climate change|changing climate]], and aid future resource and hazard management. The mission is a partnership between [[NASA]] and [[ISRO]].&lt;ref name="jpl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/nasa-isro-synthetic-aperture-radar-nisar/ |title=NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperature Radar |work=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] |accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Noise Fest''' was an influential festival of [[no wave]] [[noise music]] performances curated by [[Thurston Moore]] of [[Sonic Youth]] at the [[New York City]] art space [[White Columns]] in June 1981. [[Sonic Youth]] made their first live appearances at this show.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Reynolds]], ''Rip It Up and Start Again: Post-punk 1978-1984'' (2006) Penguin&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Noise Fest.jpg|thumb|250px|ZG records Noise Fest cover {{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;

In mid 1981 [[Kim Gordon]] and Josh Baer convinced Thurston Moore to organize this nine-day noise festival to accommodate underemployed experimental performers in the downtown scene. The festival was held in the [[White Columns]] gallery, which had a capacity of 60 people. Each night three to five acts performed, including [[Glenn Branca]], [[Rhys Chatham]], Jeffrey Lohn, Built on Guilt, [[Rudolph Grey]], the Avant Squares, Off Beach, Mofungo, Red Decade, NNB, [[Robin Crutchfield]]'s Dark Day, Ad Hoc Rock, Smoking Section, Chinese Puzzle, Avoidance Behaviour, and [[Sonic Youth]].&lt;ref&gt;Marc Masters, (2007) [[No Wave]] London, Black Dog Publishing, pp. 170-171&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recording history==
In 1978 a similar series of [[punk rock]] influenced loud [[noise music]] mixed with [[performance art]] was held at New York’s Artists’ Space that led to the [[Brian Eno]]-produced recording ''[[No New York]]''. This recording was seen by many as the first attempt to define the [[no wave]] sound, as it documented [[James Chance and the Contortions|The Contortions]], [[Teenage Jesus and the Jerks]], [[Mars (band)|Mars]] and [[DNA (No Wave band)|DNA]].

Music from the '''Noise Festival''' was first released as a cassette titled ''Noise Fest'' on ZG Music in 1981; the music label of the legendary ZG magazine organized by Rosetta Brookes. All material was recorded live at White Columns. This included the music of John Rehnberger, Off Beach, Ut, [[Lee Ranaldo]], Mofungo, [[Phil_Shoenfelt | Khmer Rouge]], The Problem, Smoking Section, [[Sonic Youth]], Jeff Lohn, Ima, Jules Baptiste Red Decade, EQ'D, Avant Squares, Don King, Primivites, Ad Hoc Rock, Y Pants, Barbotemagus (as it is spelled on the cover), Economical Animal, Chinese Puzzle, Glorious Strangers, Built On Guilt, Fakir, Lampshades. In 1982 the ''Noise Festival Tape'' was released by [[White Columns]].

==Influence==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Speedtrials.jpg|thumb|250px|Speed Trials program {{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;
Noise Fest inspired the '''Speed Trials''' [[noise rock]] series organized by [[Live Skull]] members in May 1983 at [[White Columns]]. Among an [[art installation]] created by [[David Wojnarowicz]] and [[Joseph Nechvatal]], various [[performance art]]ists such as Ilona Granet and Emily XYZ did their acts intermixing with the music of [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]], [[Beastie Boys]], [[Live Skull]], [[Sonic Youth]], [[Lydia Lunch]], [[Elliott Sharp]], [[Swans (band)|Swans]] and [[Arto Lindsay]].

''Speed Trials'' was eventually released as a live album recorded by Mark Roule and became one of the best-selling independent records of its time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carlo McCormick]], ''The [[Downtown]] Book: The New York Art Scene, 1974–1984'', [[Princeton University]] Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox South African Border War}}

'''Operation ''Bruilo''f''' ({{lang-en|'''Operation Wedding'''}}) was a planned [[military operation]] in 1978 by the [[South African Defence Force]] during the [[South African Border War]] and [[Angolan Civil War]].

== Background ==
The operation was planned for May 1978, to be conducted by [[61 Mechanised Infantry Battalion Group]] and paratroops.&lt;ref name=Steenkamp&gt;{{cite book|last=Steenkamp|first=Willem|title=South Africa's border war, 1966-1989|year=1989|publisher=Ashanti Pub.|location=Gibraltar|isbn=0620139676}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|74}}  This was to be the first mechanised force to be deployed by the South African forces during the war and consisted of the then new [[Ratel IFV|Ratel]] [[Infantry Fighting Vehicle]]s as well as [[Eland Mk7|Eland]] [[Armored car (military)|Armoured Car]]s.

The plan called for the SADF to cross the [[South-West Africa]]-[[Angola]] border, with the battle group attacking and destroying six [[South-West Africa People's Organisation]] bases around Chetequera before withdrawing.&lt;ref name=Steenkamp/&gt;{{rp|74}}

The plan was eventually abandoned and merged into what became [[Operation Reindeer]] planned for the 4 May.&lt;ref name=Steenkamp/&gt;{{rp|74}}

Operation Delego is a spinoff investigation from leads developed through "Operation Nest Egg," the prosecution of another online group dedicated to sharing and disseminating child pornography.  Operation Nest Egg was a spinoff investigation developed from leads related to another international investigation, "Operation Joint Hammer," which targeted transnational rings of child pornography trafficking.&lt;ref name=wyss-sentence /&gt; Dozens of law enforcement agencies were involved worldwide in Delego,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.dhs.gov/ynews/releases/20110803-napolitano-holder-announce-largest-prosecution-criminal-network.shtm |title=DHS: Secretary Napolitano and Attorney General Holder Announce Largest U.S. Prosecution of International Criminal Network Organized to Sexually Exploit Children |publisher=[[Department of Homeland Security]]-Dhs.gov |date=2011-08-03 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Eurojust]], and arrests were made on all five continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://capitalregion.ynn.com/content/top_stories/552291/72-charged-in-federal-child-porn-bust/ |title=72 charged in federal child porn bust |work= Your News Now |publisher=Capitalregion.ynn.com |date=2011-08-04 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty of those charged, however, are only known by their Internet handles, and as such were individually charged as [[John Doe]]s and remain at large. However, some of the indictments were unsealed as of August 2011, and the names of some of those involved in Dreamboard are publicly available.

[[United States Department of Homeland Security]] Secretary [[Janet Napolitano]] stated at a news conference that  "The board may have been the vehicle for the distribution of up to 123 terabytes of child pornography, which is roughly equivalent to 16,000 DVDs," making this the DHS's largest child porn bust in its history. Launched in 2009 by federal law enforcement, Operation Delego resulted in the arrest of 52 people in 14 countries including [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[Ecuador]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Kenya]], the [[Netherlands]], the [[Philippines]], [[Qatar]], [[Serbia]], [[Sweden]] and [[Switzerland]], according to [[United States Department of Justice]] Attorney General [[Eric Holder]].  Furthermore, according to federal agents, while Dreamboard's servers were located in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], [[Louisiana]], the site's top administrators were in France and Canada.

Operation Delego is ongoing.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2939">'''Pierre Picaud''' ({{IPA-fr|piko|lang}}) was a 19th-century shoemaker in [[Nîmes]] who may have been the basis for the character of [[Edmond Dantès]] in [[Alexandre Dumas, père]]'s novel, ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]''. In 1807, Picaud was engaged to marry a rich woman, but three jealous friends &amp;mdash; Loupian, Solari, and Chaubart &amp;mdash; falsely accused him of being a [[spy]] for [[England]] (a fourth friend, Allut, knew of their conspiracy, but did not report it).&lt;ref&gt;H. Ashton-Wolfe,  p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; He was imprisoned in the [[Fenestrelle Fort|Fenestrelle]] fortress for seven years, not even learning why until his second year there.&lt;ref&gt;H. Ashton-Wolfe, p. 20-21&lt;/ref&gt; During his imprisonment he ground a small passageway into a neighboring cell and befriended a wealthy [[Italian people|Italian]] priest named Father Torri who was being held there.&lt;ref&gt;H. Ashton-Wolfe, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, a dying Torri bequeathed to Picaud a treasure he had hidden in [[Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Ashton-Wolfe, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; When Picaud was released after the fall of the Imperial government in 1814, he took possession of the treasure, returned under another name to [[Paris]] and spent 10 years plotting revenge against his former friends.

Picaud first murdered Chaubart, or had him murdered.&lt;ref&gt;H. Ashton-Wolfe, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Picaud's former fiancée had, two years after his disappearance, married his former friend Loupian, who became the subject of his most brutal revenge. Picaud tricked Loupian's daughter into marrying a criminal, whom he then had arrested. Loupian's daughter promptly died of shock. Picaud then burned down Loupian's restaurant, or arranged to have it burned down, leaving Loupian impoverished.&lt;ref&gt;H. Ashton-Wolfe, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Next, he poisoned Solari to death and either manipulated Loupian's son into stealing some gold jewelry or framed him for committing the crime.&lt;ref&gt;H. Ashton-Wolfe p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The boy was sent to jail, and Picaud stabbed Loupian to death. He was himself then abducted by Allut and killed.

Allut's deathbed confession forms the bulk of the French police records of the case. The detailed description of Picaud's experiences in prison, which could not have been known to Allut, were supposedly dictated to him by the ghost of Father Torri.&lt;ref&gt;H. Ashton-Wolfe p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Police impersonation''' is an act of falsely portraying oneself as a member of the [[police]], for the purpose of deception. In the vast majority of countries, the practice is illegal and carries a [[custodial sentence]].

Impersonating a [[police officer]] is sometimes committed in order to assert police-like authority in order to commit a crime. Posing as a police officer enables the offender to legitimize the appearance of an illegal act, such as: [[burglary]], making a [[traffic stop]], or [[Detention (imprisonment)|detaining]].

Dressing up as a police officer in costume (e.g. for [[Halloween]]), or pretending to be a police officer for the purpose of play or a harmless prank toward an acquaintance is generally not considered a crime, provided that those involved recognize the imposter is not a real police officer, and the imposter is not trying to deceive those involved into thinking they are. Nevertheless, replica police uniforms sold in the UK must not be identical to the uniforms currently used by the police, and traders have been jailed in the past for selling on genuine uniforms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2874609/Police-uniform-trader-sold-helmets-truncheons-TV-shows-prosecuted-unable-prove-weren-t-bought-terrorists.html|title=Police uniform trader who sold helmets and truncheons to TV shows is prosecuted - Daily Mail Online|work=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2010/10_october/18/inside_out_southeast.shtml|title=BBC - Press Office - Inside Out South East reveals illegal trade in police uniforms|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following impersonations class as the offence:

*'''Verbal identification''': The imposter announces to the unsuspecting victim that they are a police officer or other law enforcement agent.
*'''Fake [[Badge]] or [[Warrant card]]''': The imposter, though not in any special clothes, displays a police-like badge or identification card to the victim. Sometimes, even a real police officer will not even be able to differentiate between the real and fake badge, as some duplicates are very similar to a real badge, if not identical to one. This is much more of a problem in the USA than in the UK, as in the UK, police identification includes photographic ID as well as the police shield, whereas in the USA, a police shield alone counts as ID, making it easier for people to pretend to be police officers. 
*'''Fake [[uniform]]''': The imposter wears a uniform that looks very much like that of a police officer.
*'''Fake [[Police car|vehicle]]:''' The imposter places police lights (these can be either permanently mounted onto the car or temporary lights magnetically attached to the cartop), decals, siren, or other equipment on a personal vehicle to disguise it as a [[police car]] and enable the offender to pass through red traffic lights, bypass traffic other non-emergency traffic would have to wait for, make [[traffic stop]]s, or even [[arrest]]s.

Much of the equipment described above is available for purchase by the general public, thereby enabling imposters to obtain the necessary materials to commit such a crime. While the equipment will not bear the name of a specific law enforcement agency, the unsuspecting victim may not notice the difference.

In an extreme case, a [[Hempstead (village), New York|Hempstead, New York]] man set up a fake [[police station]] in addition to the above, where he [[Interrogation|interrogated]] those he [[arrest]]ed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/story/alleged-fake-cop-ran-own-police-station-interrogated-suspects|title=Alleged Fake Cop Ran Own 'Police Station,' Interrogated 'Suspects'|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;



Some of the following crimes have been committed while impersonating a police officer:{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}
*[[Burglary|Home invasion]], by gaining entry under the guise of a police officer, followed by [[theft]] from the premises, [[rape]], [[torture]], or in rare cases, [[murder]].
*'''Theft and [[motor vehicle theft]]''' - approaching a victim, explaining that an item or a vehicle is stolen. The impersonator will then seize the "evidence" and never return it.
*[[Armed robbery]], following a [[traffic stop]]
*[[Kidnapping]] following a traffic stop or [[false arrest]]
*'''Fake authority''', in which the officer attempts to [[extortion|extort]] money from the victim, claiming it is a fine, or can be paid on the spot to avoid further legal consequences.
*[[Prank]] phone calls and other [[fraudulent]] / deceptive electronic [[communications]], where one might make a comment about a group that invites retaliation.

==Popular culture==
The 2014 American film ''[[Let's Be Cops]]'' features the main characters pretending to be police officers.
A popular webseries ''[[Dick Figures]]'' aired an episode called 'We're Cops' featured 'red' and 'blue' rob a bank dressed as a police officer.

==Role in Azariqa faction==
In 687, Ibn al-Fuja'a assumed leadership over the Azariqa sub-sect of the [[Khawarij]] sect of [[Islam]] during the [[Second Fitna]]. Leading his troops from [[Kerman]], he recaptured portions of [[Ahvaz]] and marched towards [[Basra]].&lt;ref name="gaiser"/&gt;

Around 698 or 699, the governor of Iraq [[al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf]] sent two of his generals, [[al-Muhallab ibn Abi Suffrah]] and [[Sufyan ibn al-Abrad al-Kalbi]], to attack Ibn al-Fuja'a and his men who were encamped in [[Tabaristan]].

The "'''Redhead murders'''",  are a series of unsolved homicides believed to have been committed by an unidentified [[serial killer]], also known as the '''Bible Belt Strangler''', in various parts of the United States, including Tennessee, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.&lt;ref name="daughter"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Robinson |first1=Grant |title=Potential daughter of redheaded Jane Doe visits town where body was found |url=https://www.wbir.com/article/news/local/potential-daughter-of-redheaded-jane-doe-visits-town-where-body-was-found/51-568003661 |accessdate=6 July 2018 |work=10 News NBC |date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bass, William ; Jefferson, Jon|title=Death's Acre: Inside the Legendary Forensic Lab the Body Farm Where the Dead Do Tell Tales|date=October 5, 2004|publisher=Berkley Trade|location=New York, New York|isbn=0425198324|page=149|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MTLS-F-HmoQC&amp;pg=PA149}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gadsden&gt;{{cite news|title=Five states join probe of 'redhead murders'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1891&amp;dat=19850425&amp;id=brgfAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1432,4859376|accessdate=December 18, 2014|work=Gadsden Times|date=April 25, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is presumed that the killings occurred between October 1978 and the 1980s, but they may have continued until 1992.&lt;ref name=evening1/&gt;&lt;ref name=bres/&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newton|first1=Michael|title=The Encyclopedia of Unsolved Crimes|date=September 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|location=New York, New York|isbn=081607819X|page=316|edition=Second|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gijG7fSwvjAC&amp;pg=PA316}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victims, many of whom have never been identified, usually had reddish hair and their bodies were abandoned along major highways in the United States; presumably, they were hitchhiking or engaged in prostitution.&lt;ref name=gadsden/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strand|first1=Ginger|title=Killer on the Road: Violence and the American Interstate|date=February 14, 2014|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=0292757522|page=174|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wR3puj6g9XoC&amp;pg=PA174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities are unsure of how many people were responsible for these murders, if they were all performed by the same perpetrator(s), or how many victims there were.&lt;ref name=identify/&gt; It is believed that a total of six to eleven victims were involved.&lt;ref name=gadsden/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lawmen from 5-States Probe Redhead Murders|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DQohAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3744,2202729&amp;dq=jerry+leon+johns|accessdate=January 8, 2015|work=Schenectady Gazette|date=April 25, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Redhead' murders probed|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=3050655&amp;fcfToken=4c493933705175677a6a387a59304d4831623078526c5931373250424e6d766771314f44496c463969792b7a6f38586878732f524c697a45315a7a6e55346353|accessdate=January 19, 2016|via=Newspapers.com|work=The Galveston Daily News|date=April 25, 1985|page=6}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the presumed victims, four have been identified.&lt;ref name="farmerID" /&gt;&lt;ref name="identify" /&gt;&lt;ref name=espy/&gt;&lt;ref name=shelton&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shelton |first1=Caitlyn |title=1985 Tennessee homicide victim identified as New Hampshire missing 17-year-old |url=https://fox17.com/news/local/new-hampshire-missing-17-year-old-identified-as-1985-tennessee-homicide-victim |accessdate=14 November 2018 |work=WZTV |date=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victims==

===Wetzel County victim===

The body of a white female was found naked alongside Route 250 near [[Littleton, West Virginia|Littleton]], [[Wetzel County, West Virginia]] on February 13, 1983. A pair of senior citizens reported that they thought the remains were a mannequin before discovering it was a human corpse. The body had been placed at the area recently, as the snow was on the ground and absent on the body. Tire tracks and footprints indicate she died at a different area and was transported to the location where she was found. It is presumed that she had died two days before. She had not been an apparent victim of sexual assault, although foul play may have been involved in her death. This woman's cause of death was not officially determined, but she is a possible victim, as she may have been suffocated or strangled. This woman was one of the older victims, as her age range was between 35 and 45. The woman's hair was auburn, which matched the criteria for the killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dead Woman May Be Linked to 5-State Readhead Murders|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2519&amp;dat=19850426&amp;id=vYZiAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2332,4145700|accessdate=December 18, 2014|work=Observer-Reporter|date=April 26, 1985|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her height was estimated to be approximately {{convert|5|ft|6|in|cm|spell=in}} and weight as {{convert|135|lb}}. Her eyes were presumed to be brown, although decomposition made it difficult to accurately determine eye color. She had two distinct scars, including one found on her abdomen from a [[Caesarean section]], indicating she had at least one child and another found on one of the index fingers. The woman's legs and underarms were shaven, indicating an attention to grooming not characteristic of a transient or hitchhiker. A person of interest has emerged in this case, believed to be a middle-aged white male at the height of approximately {{convert|5|ft|10|in|cm|spell=in}} and weighing {{convert|185|to|200|lb}}. The man was seen near the area where the body was found and could have been involved with disposing of her body. The victim herself may have been seen alive in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]] as an employee or customer at a bar. She was subsequently buried after a funeral took place. West Virginia authorities are skeptical if this woman was a victim of this span of killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File: 56UFWV|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/56ufwv.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=December 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lisa Nichols===

The body of 28-year-old Lisa Nichols, who also used the last name of Jarvis, was found on September 16, 1984 along Interstate 40 near [[West Memphis, Arkansas]]. She was a resident of West Virginia and authorities were not able to come into contact with family members for some time, indicating she was estranged from them, resulting in her remaining unidentified for nearly a year. Her body was not identified until June 1985, nine months after she was strangled and left wearing only a sweater. She was identified through fingerprints.&lt;ref name=high&gt;{{cite news |last1=Townsend |first1=Catherine |title=WHO IS THE "BIBLE BELT STRANGLER"?

Her remains were identified by a couple from Florida, who had allowed her to stay with them for a period of time. Nichols may have been murdered after leaving a truck stop along the highway and may have attempted to hitchhike.&lt;ref name=identify&gt;{{cite news|title=Police Identify 1 Readhead Murder Victim|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eFQPAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3836,2247741|accessdate=December 18, 2014|work=Daily News|date=June 27, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tina Farmer===

On January 1, 1985, a bound body was found at the roadside near [[Jellico, Tennessee]], in Campbell County on Interstate 75. Although her murder occurred about three days before, presumably on December 30, 1984, she was already in an advanced state of decomposition.&lt;ref name=id1579&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 1579|url=https://identifyus.org/cases/1579|date=April 11, 2008|website=identifyus.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the others, she was white and had short red hair, which was somewhat curly. She was likely between the ages of 17 and 25, although she may have been as old as 30 at the time she was murdered.&lt;ref name=id1579/&gt; The victim was found clothed, with a tan pullover, a shirt and jeans. The Jane Doe had green or hazel eyes, which could not be positively confirmed as a certain color because of the state of her body. The young woman also had freckles, various scars and burn marks on her body and was two and a half to five months pregnant when she was strangled.&lt;ref name=doej/&gt;&lt;ref name=NCMEC2/&gt; She had no evidence of dental work, except for a partial denture holding two false teeth on her upper jaw.&lt;ref name=doej&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 910UFTN|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/910uftn.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|date=December 8, 2012|accessdate=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is believed that she was between five feet one and {{convert|5|ft|4|in|cm|spell=in}} when she died and was approximately {{convert|110|to|115|lb}}.&lt;ref name=id1579/&gt;&lt;ref name=doej/&gt;&lt;ref name=NCMEC2&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Doe 1985|url=http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1184609/1#poster|website=missingkids.org|publisher=[[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]]|accessdate=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced on September 6, 2018, the victim had been identified as Tina Marie McKenney Farmer of Indiana. Fingerprinting was the method of identification. She was 21 at the time of her death and was last seen in Indianapolis accompanied by a trucker headed to Kentucky.&lt;ref name="farmerID"&gt;{{cite news |title='Redhead Murder' victim in Campbell County identified after 33 years |url=https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/crime/2018/09/06/redhead-murder-victim-campbell-county-identified/1214514002/ |accessdate=6 September 2018 |work=Knoxville News Sentinel |date=6 September 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Agents ID body found in Tennessee in ’80s as Indy woman, ask public to help solve murder |url=https://fox59.com/2018/09/06/agents-id-body-found-in-tennessee-in-80s-as-indy-woman-ask-public-to-help-solve-murder/ |accessdate=6 September 2018 |work=FOX59 |date=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmer had one daughter prior to disappearing in 1984. She was reported missing by her family, yet authorities in Indiana did not enter her into national databases, as there was no law in the state, like others, which required them to do so.&lt;ref name="years"&gt;{{cite news |last=Turner |first=Angela |title=Body found 33 years ago has been identified |url=http://www.thetimestribune.com/news/local_news/body-found-years-ago-has-been-identified/article_270e6bba-917d-5487-b080-8e0796135e3f.html |work=The Times-Tribune.com |date=12 September 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campbell County victim===
The second victim in Campbell County was found on April 3, 1985, but her hair color is unknown, which does not immediately indicate she was a victim of the Redhead Murderer. She was believed to have died between 1981 and 1984, one to four years before. Unlike the other victims, she was younger, between 9 and 15, when the others were estimated to be over 16. She was located by a passerby about 200 yards off Big Wheel Gap Road, four miles southwest of Jellico in Campbell County, some distance from Interstate 75, near a strip mine.&lt;ref name="85redhead2ncmec"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Doe 1985|url=http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1105475/1#poster|website=missingkids.org|publisher=[[National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]]|accessdate=January 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of this girl's death is unknown, as her remains were partial, but still may be homicide. Thirty-two bones, including her skull, were all that were recovered from the scene. Her skull allowed facial reconstruction. She wore a necklace and bracelet made of plastic buttons from clothing. There were a pair of boots recovered that were size 5, which may not belong to the victim, and a few scraps of clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 482UFTN|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/482uftn.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=December 19, 2014|date=June 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the condition of her body, her height, weight, eye color and hair color were not possible to estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 1577|url=https://identifyus.org/cases/1577|website=identifyus.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=January 2, 2015|date=April 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent analysis of the victim's remains indicated she was not native to the area she was discovered. The tests showed she was likely born in Florida or central Texas, later relocating to the Midwest, Rocky Mountain states, the Southwest or the Pacific Coast.&lt;ref name="85redhead2ncmec" /&gt;

===Cheatham County victim===
The skeletonized body of a red-haired female was located on March 31, 1985 in [[Pleasant View, Tennessee|Pleasant View]], [[Cheatham County, Tennessee]]. She was believed to have died three to five months before, due to an unknown cause. However, her case is possibly linked to the redhead murders because her remains were found at the side of Interstate 24 between mile markers 29 and 30.&lt;ref name="new hope"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jaglois |first1=Jessica |title=Identification provides new hope in 'Redhead Murders' |url=https://www.wkrn.com/news/identification-provides-new-hope-in-redhead-murders-/1437829539 |accessdate=13 September 2018 |work=WKRN |date=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gadsden/&gt;&lt;ref name=doeche/&gt; Unlike some of the other victims, she wore clothing: a shirt, sweater, pants and underwear. She was white, between five feet and {{convert|5|ft|2|in|cm|spell=in}} tall with an inestimable weight. By examining her teeth, the victim had some evidence of crowding and overlapping of her teeth.&lt;ref name=doeche&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File: 911UFTN|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/911uftn.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This woman was believed to be between the ages of thirty-one and forty at the time of her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 1578|url=https://identifyus.org/cases/1578|website=identifyus.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Espy Pilgrim===

[[File:Gray Kentucky Redhead Jane 192UFKY 001d.jpg|thumb|left|Reconstruction of Espy Pilgrim prior to identification]]

The body of a woman who had died by suffocation was found in a white [[Admiral (electrical appliances)|Admiral]] refrigerator in [[Gray, Kentucky|Gray]], [[Knox County, Kentucky]] on April 1, 1985, alongside Route 25.&lt;ref name=gadsden/&gt;&lt;ref name=bres/&gt; The refrigerator had a decal of the words "Super Woman" on the front.&lt;ref name=doeknox/&gt; The victim had been dead for a few days, and was nude except for two distinctive necklace pendants, one of a heart and the other of a gold-colored eagle, and two pairs of socks; one white, and the other white with green and yellow stripes.&lt;ref name=bres/&gt;&lt;ref name=namusknox/&gt; There were reports that the victim may have been soliciting a ride to North Carolina over CB radio.&lt;ref name=doeknox/&gt; Five hundred people attended her funeral, which was also televised. The case was a local sensation in Gray, as the town was a "quiet" and "sleepy" place where little out of the ordinary usually happened.&lt;ref name=bres/&gt; Distinguishing features of the body included a number of [[nevus|moles]] (on the right side of her neck, near one ankle, and below each breast), a yellow-stained upper incisor, and a scar and other marks on her abdomen, indicating that she had borne a child. Her eyes were  light brown and her hair was red and nearly a foot long, which fit the pattern of the redhead killer. After her autopsy, she was determined to be between 24 and 35 years old and  approximately 4 feet 9 to 4 feet 11 inches tall.&lt;ref name=doeknox&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File: 192UFKY|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/192ufky.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=December 18, 2014|date=January 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also possible that she owned a pair of boots found near the refrigerator. Several missing persons have been eliminated as possible matches for the victim.&lt;ref name=namusknox&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 82|url=https://identifyus.org/cases/82|website=identifyus.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=December 18, 2014|date=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the case was publicized in January 2013, the police received some tips, but it is unknown if they became solid leads.&lt;ref name=bres&gt;{{cite news|last1=Breslow|first1=Josh|title=The Redhead Murders|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wr0T7Se5J7k|accessdate=December 18, 2014|work=18 News|agency=NBC|date=January 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=likely&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nesbitt|first1=Jim|title=Serial Killer Likely Preying On Redheads|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1985-04-21/news/0290210184_1_serial-killer-redheaded-woman-abandoned-refrigerator|accessdate=December 18, 2014|work=Orlando Sentenial|date=April 21, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elizabeth Lamotte===

On April 14, 1985, a young white female's body was located in [[Greeneville, Tennessee|Greeneville]], [[Greene County, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name=string&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aldrich|first1=Marta W.|title=OFFICIALS PUZZLE OVER STRING OF REDHEAD MURDERS|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1985/Officials-Puzzle-Over-String-of-Redhead-Murders/id-8ad8d3ad5b164d3818827a4768931a2c|accessdate=December 18, 2014|work=Associated Press|date=April 25, 1985|location=Nashville, Tennessee}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ncmecgreene&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Doe 1985|url=http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1106925/1#poster|website=missingkids.org|publisher=[[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]]|accessdate=November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had died by severe blunt-force trauma and possibly a stab wound three to six weeks before and was an advanced state of decomposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 264UFTN|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/264uftn.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, her fingerprints were possible to obtain, as well as her DNA and dental information.

==Investigation==
It is believed that most of the victims remain unidentified due to being estranged or not close with existing family members or may not have been native to the states in which that they were found. In 1985, not long after the Greene County victim was found, the states of Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Arkansas and Mississippi requested the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] for assistance with the cases. There were inconsistencies with some of the victims, as some were found with or without clothing and some had a sexual encounter before their murders.&lt;ref name=string/&gt; During the conference, it was stated that four victims found in Texas and a victim found in 1981 in Ohio, nicknamed "Buckskin Girl” (later identified as [[Murder of Marcia King|Marcia King]]), were ruled out as possible victims in 1985.&lt;ref name=string/&gt;

A possible suspect emerged in the mid-eighties when a 37-year-old trucker attacked and attempted to strangle a woman with reddish hair, but was later dismissed, although he had left her lying near a highway, presuming she was dead.&lt;ref name=gadsden/&gt;  Another suspect was a 32-year-old trucker in Pennsylvania who was questioned after kidnapping and raping a young woman in the state of Indiana before she managed to escape. This suspect was also dismissed, after being questioned by Tennessee police.&lt;ref name=evening1&gt;{{cite news|title=Trucker not a suspect in 'Redhead Murders'|via=Newspapers.com|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=3050651|accessdate=January 19, 2016|work=The Evening Times|date=February 6, 1986|location=Sayre, Pennsylvania|page=18}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, students enrolled in a sociology class at [[Elizabethton High School]] studied the case with the aid of their instructor. The class coined the name "Bible Belt Strangler."&lt;ref name="high" /&gt; Furthermore, the information developed by the class was submitted to an FBI profiler. They described the subject as a white male born between 1936 and 1962 (aged between 23 and 49 in 1985) who was likely a commercial trucker frequenting Interstate 40. They estimated his height and weight to be 5'9 to 6'2" and 180-270 pounds, respectively.  His work was likely based in or near the city of [[Knoxville, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name="years" /&gt;&lt;ref name="high" /&gt;

The three '''Round Table Conferences''' of 1930–32 were a series of conferences organized  by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]] and Indian national congress was participant to discuss constitutional reforms in [[India]]. These started in November 1930 and ended in December 1932. They were conducted as per the recommendation of [[Jinnah]] to [[Viceroy  of India|Viceroy]] [[Lord Irwin]] and [[Prime Minister of Great Britain|Prime Minister]] [[Ramsay MacDonald]],&lt;ref name="Jinnah of Pakistan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolpert|first1=Stanley|title=Jinnah of Pakistan|date=2013|publisher=University Press|location=Karachi, Pakistan|isbn=978-0-19-577389-7|page=107|edition=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolpert|first1=Stanley|title=Shameful Flight|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Karachi, Pakistan|isbn=978-0-19-906606-3|page=5|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the report submitted by the [[Simon Commission]] in May 1930. Demands for [[swaraj]], or self-rule, in India had been growing increasingly strong. Mahatma Gandhi, Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, Srinivasa, Sir Muhammad Zafrulla Khan and Mirabehn are key participants from India.  By the 1930s, many British politicians believed that India needed to move towards [[dominion status]]. However, there were significant disagreements between the Indian and the British political parties that the Conferences would not resolve. The key topic was about constitution and India which was mainly discussed in that conference.

=={{anchor|First Round Table Conference}}First Round Table Conference (November 1930 – January 1931)==
The Round Table Conference officially inaugurated by His Majesty [[George V]] on November 12, 1930 in Royal Gallery [[House of Lords]] at [[London]]&lt;ref name="Jinnah of Pakistan"/&gt; and chaired by the British Prime Minister, [[Ramsay MacDonald]].

The three British political parties were represented by sixteen delegates. There were fifty-eight political leaders from British India and sixteen delegates from the princely states. In total 74 delegates from India attended the Conference. However, the [[Indian National Congress]], along with Indian business leaders, kept away from the conference. Many of them were in jail for their participation in [[Civil Disobedience Movement]].&lt;ref name=IRTCP&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Round Table Conference Proceedings|year=1931|publisher=Government of India|url=https://archive.org/details/indianroundtable029616mbp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proceedings===
The conference started with 6 plenary meetings where delegates put forward their issues 9 sub committees were formed to deal with several different matters including federal structure, provincial constitution, province of Sindh and NWFP, defense services and minorities e.t.c.&lt;ref name="Pakistan studies"/&gt; These were followed by discussions on the reports of the sub-committees on Federal Structure, Provincial Constitution, Minorities, [[Burma]], [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North West Frontier Province]], Franchise, Defense services and [[Sindh]]. These were followed by 2 more plenary meetings and a final concluding session.&lt;ref name=IRTCP/&gt; It was difficult for progress to be made in the absence of the [[Indian National Congress]] but some advances were made.

The idea of an All-India Federation was moved to the centre of discussion by [[Tej Bahadur Sapru]].&lt;ref name=TOPMenon&gt;{{cite book|last1=Menon|first1=V.P.|title=Transfer of Power in India|date=1957|publisher=Orient Longman Limited|page=44|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=FY5gI7SGU20C&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the groups attending the conference supported this concept. The princely states agreed to the proposed federation provided that their internal sovereignty was guaranteed. The Muslim League also supported the federation as it had always been opposed to a strong Centre. The British agreed that representative government should be introduced on provincial level.

Other important discussions were the responsibility of the executive to the legislature and a separate electorate for the [[Dalit|Untouchables]] as demanded by Dr. [[B.R. Ambedkar]].

=={{anchor|Second Round Table Conference}}Second Round Table Conference (September – December 1931)==
The Congress had boycotted the first conference was requested to come to a settlement by Sapru, [[M. R. Jayakar]] and [[V. S. Srinivasa Sastri]]. A settlement between Mahatma Gandhi and Viceroy [[Lord Irwin]] known as the [[Gandhi–Irwin Pact]] was reached and Gandhi was appointed as the sole representative of the Congress to the second Round Table Conference. Although MacDonald was still Prime Minister of Britain, he was by this time heading a coalition Government (the "National Government") with a Conservative majority. It was held in London in September 1931. The discussion led to the passing of the Government Of India act of 1935.

===Proceedings===
The second session opened on September 7, 1931. There were three major differences between the first and second Round Table Conferences. By the second:
[[File:Second round tableconf.gif|right|thumb|200x200px|'''The Second Round Table Conference''''' ''(September 7, 1931)]]
*''Congress Representation'' — The [[Gandhi-Irwin Pact]] opened the way for Congress participation in this conference.  [[Mahatma Gandhi]] was invited from India and attended as the sole official Congress representative accompanied by [[Sarojini Naidu]] and also [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]], [[Ghanshyam Das Birla]], [[Muhammad Iqbal]], [[Sir Mirza Ismail]] ([[List of Diwans of Mysore|Diwan of Mysore]]), [[Surendra Kumar Datta|S.K. Dutta]] and Sir Syed Ali Imam. Gandhi claimed that the Congress alone represented political India; that the Untouchables were Hindus and should not be treated as a “minority”; and that there should be no separate electorates or special safeguards for Muslims or other minorities. These claims were rejected by the other Indian participants. According to this pact, Gandhi was asked to call off the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) and if he did so the prisoners of the British government would be freed except the criminal prisoners, i.e. those who had killed British officials. He returned to India, disappointed with the results and empty-handed.
*''National Government'' — two weeks earlier the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government in London had fallen. [[Ramsay MacDonald]] now headed a National Government dominated by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].
*''Financial Crisis'' – During the conference, Britain went off the Gold Standard further distracting the National Government.

During the Conference, Gandhi could not reach agreement with the Muslims on Muslim representation and safeguards. At the end of the conference Ramsay MacDonald undertook to produce a [[Communal Award]] for minority representation, with the provision that any free agreement between the parties could be substituted for his award{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}.

Gandhi took particular exception to the treatment of untouchables as a minority separate from the rest of the Hindu community.  He clashed with the leader of depressed classes, Dr.[[B. R. Ambedkar]], over this issue: the two eventually resolved the situation with the [[Poona Pact]] of 1932.

=={{anchor|Third Round Table Conference}}Third Round Table Conference (November – December 1932)==
The third and last session assembled on November 17, 1932. Only forty-six delegates attended since most of the main political figures of India were not present. The Labour Party from Britain and the Indian National Congress refused to attend.

From September 1931 until March 1933, under the supervision of the Secretary of State for India,  [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Sir Samuel Hoare]], the proposed reforms took the form reflected in the [[Government of India Act 1935]].

'''Shakespeare &amp; Company''' is an American [[theatre]] company located in [[Lenox, Massachusetts]] in the [[Berkshire County, Massachusetts|Berkshire]] region of western Massachusetts.  It was founded in 1978 by [[artistic director]] Tina Packer, who stepped down in 2009. Allyn Burrows is the current artistic director.  A co-founder was [[Kristin Linklater]], who developed the Linklater vocal technique and left the company in the mid-1990s. The company performs [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and new plays of "social and political significance", reaching over 75,000 patrons annually, and it conducts training programs for professional classical actors as well as education programs for elementary through high school students, the latter reaching over 50,000 students annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shakespeare.org/sandco.php?pg=about&amp;category=about%20the%20company&amp;subCat=Company+History Company History]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1978 to 2001, Shakespeare &amp; Company was based at [[The Mount (Lenox, Massachusetts)|The Mount]], Edith Wharton's historic property in Lenox, Massachusetts. 

Shakespeare &amp; Company is listed as a major festival in the book ''Shakespeare Festivals Around the World'' by Marcus D. Gregio ([[editing|Editor]]), 2004.

==The Fall Festival of Shakespeare==
Each fall, the education department of Shakespeare &amp; Company hosts a program called "The Fall Festival of Shakespeare". 10 [[high school]]s in Berkshire County, New York, central and eastern Massachusetts participate in this program.  Teaching Artists and Technicians from the company come into the schools and work with the students to create 90 minute cuts of plays by Shakespeare. Each school has performances at their own venue, then all the plays are performed the weekend before [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] at Shakespeare &amp; Co. The Fall Festival of Shakespeare is a non-competitive celebration of the students work. The festival just finished its twenty-ninth year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21231">The city of '''[[Galway]]''', [[Ireland]] - built as a [[naval base]] and [[military]] [[fort]] by [[Tairrdelbach mac Ruaidri Ua Conchobair]] in 1124, refounded as a military outpost and [[town]] by [[Richard Mor de Burgh]] in 1230 - has been subjected to a number of [[battle]]s, [[looting|sack]]s and [[siege]]s. This article enumerates them.

==Dun Beal Gallimhe==

Dun Beal Gallimhe can be translated as ''"fort at the mouth of the Gallimhe river."'' It is believed to have been situated on the site of the present Customs House. This building is situated in the heart of the old medieval city between Quay Street to the north, Flood Street to the south, Druid Lane to the east and Quay Lane to the west. Subsequent to the founding of Galway in 1232, a castle and hall were built upon the site. The latter building was known as the Red Earl's hall and was excavated in 1999.

There is some slight evidence for [[Viking]] use of the area, at least as a seasonal camp, as the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] of [[Limerick]] made a number of devastating raids in the area in the 9th and 10th centuries, and though the annalistic evidence is ambiguous, seem to have made some sort of semi-permanent camp along the river or in [[Lough Corrib]]. Be that as it may, the earliest known building was erected there in 1124 at the instigation of High King [[Tairrdelbach mac Ruaidri Ua Conchobair]].

Both as a naval base and military base Dun Beal Gallimhe offered several advantages. It was surrounded to the north by a number of small islands that, separated from the Dun by large streams and extremely boggy ground, made physical progress difficult and an attack futile. To the south it was bounded by muddy estuary flats and the effects of the tide which made approach from this side just as difficult. The Dun itself was raised at the very end of a thin peninsula of land that could withstand attack by a relatively small number of defenders. Due west was the river, which is one of the fastest-flowing in Europe, and yet almost the only ford on the river. If all was lost, defenders could withdraw to the west bank and flee into [[Iar Connacht]]. If, however, the attacking force could still not make the east bank, there were only two other routes to the other side, neither favourable: one was to risk a crossing of Lough Corrib, which however can be treacherous at the best of times to an unskilled sailor; second, the unenviable sixty mile slog north to [[Cong, County Mayo|Cong]].

From a naval point of view Gallimhe did not make an especially desirable port, lacking a deep harbour. Up to the early 19th century smaller ships docked at the river quay, while larger ones remained at anchor out in the bay for unloading. Yet in the early days of its existence it offered a way into Lough Corrib and its surrounding landmass, from which an invader could strike deep into the heart of [[Delbhna Tir Dha Locha]] or [[Maigh Seola]]. Conversely it also offered a route out of the latter kingdom and a means to attack its ruler's enemies. Indeed, it was used in this capacity both in the 1160s and 1590s.

At least some of these factors played a part in subsequent sieges of the settlement. Only much later in its history it would be put to use as the premier merchant port and market of Ireland's west coast. By then it had far outgrown its initial ''raison d'être'' as seen by O&amp;nbsp;Conchobair and de&amp;nbsp;Burgh and become ''"the City of the Tribes"'' (see [[Tribes of Galway]]).

==O Brian's siege of 1132==

[[Naval warfare|Naval-based warfare]] became something of a regular occurrence in early 12th century [[Ireland]]. The [[Annals of Inisfallen]] note raids of this nature occurring in 1100, 1101, 1119, and 1124. Perhaps this was what led to [[Tairrdelbach mac Ruaidri Ua Conchobair]] to build Dún Béal Gallimhe in 1124. It was located in Clan Fergal, the territory of the O Hallorans but was supervised by Ua Conchobair's vassals, the Ua&amp;nbsp;Flaithbheartaigh, who at this time were still based in their homeland of [[Maigh Seola]].

During the summer of 1132, Conchobhair O&amp;nbsp;Brian of Thomond (modern north Munster) invaded [[Hy-Many]] where he ''"plundered ... Maenmhagh ... [and] carried off many cows."'' This raid was purely of a plundering nature, yet apparently within a very short period of time, he followed it up with a full-scale assault on O Conchobair's new naval base at Dún Béal Gallimhe. The [[Annals of the Four Masters]] noted that ''"The castle of Bun-Gaillmhe was burned and demolished [by] a fleet of the men of Munster."'' The Munstermen then followed this up with a devastating raid on both Clan Fergal and Magh Seola, for the same annals note that ''"A great slaughter was made of the Connachtmen by the men of Munster, wherein Conchobhar Ua&amp;nbsp;Flaithbheartaigh, lord of West Connacht"'' was slain.

Also among the dead were ''"the two sons of Cathal Ua&amp;nbsp;Mughroin"'' and ''Ua&amp;nbsp;Taidhg "an Teaghlaigh"''. This is significant because the Ua Mughroin were a sept native to Hy-Many, some distance from Gallimhe which was in any case historically based in a different territory, Clann Fergal. Therefore, they must have travelled some distance to be present to fight against the forces from Munster, possibly in a levy raised by Tairrdelbach himself. Ua&amp;nbsp;Taidgh's nickname, An Teaghlaigh, indicates that he was of the household, or indeed the household bodyguard, of Tairrdelbach, who would of necessity have only accompanied the High King. Therefore, the deaths of members of these three vassal clans, as well as his own possible presence at the battle, indicates the importance the High King attached to his "''dún''" on the Gallimhe. This is underlined by the fact that it was rebuilt, which can be inferred by a further attack in 1149.

==O Brian's siege of 1149==

The 1149 siege of Dún Béal Gallimhe was led by Toirdhealbhach O&amp;nbsp;Brían, then King of Thomond. It was a combined raid of plunder (taking the rich pickings of [[Maigh Seola]]) and military strategy (destroying the Dún).

In the years immediately prior to 1149, the respective interests of Connacht - still ruled by High King [[Tairrdelbach mac Ruaidri Ua Conchobair]] - and of Thomond had were confined to putting down rebellions and civil strife in their kingdoms, as well as maintaining their areas of interest. Ruaidri was frequently at odds with the O&amp;nbsp;Neills in Ulster and Meath, and had a sometime antagonistic relationship with Tighernan O&amp;nbsp;Rúairc, King of Brefine, which was a buffer state carved out of disputed territory between Connacht and Ulster.

Toirdhealbhach O&amp;nbsp;Brían on the other hand was pre-occupied with extending his influence into Leinster (the kingdom whose rejection of tributes had led to his ancestor, [[Brian Boru]]'s, death in 1014), as well as with putting down rebellion in his native Thomond and with ensuring his vassals of Munster, the MacCarthys, knew their place. Both Kings had in fact ratified a treaty at Terryglass Monastery in 1144, possibly to recognise and respect their spheres of influence.

However the following year Toirdhealbhach was decisively defeated by O&amp;nbsp;Conchobair and his vassals at Feara Ceall in the Sliabh Bloom; O&amp;nbsp;Brian had been en route to Meath to fight O&amp;nbsp;Ruairc but had been intercepted by O&amp;nbsp;Conchobair. O&amp;nbsp;Brian was forced to return home, ''"without prey, without hostage, without peace, without truce."'' This brought O&amp;nbsp;Brian and O&amp;nbsp;Conchobhair into open war; O&amp;nbsp;Brian struck within the same year with "an army into Connacht; and they carried off Ua&amp;nbsp;Ceallaigh, i.e. Tadhg, son of Conchobhar, lord of Ui-Maine, and slew Ruaidhri Ua&amp;nbsp;Flaithbheartaigh". The death of Ua&amp;nbsp;Flaithbheartaigh indicates that an attempt may have been made on Gallimhe, but O&amp;nbsp;Brian would have to wait a full four years before he reached this objective.

According to the Four Masters, in 1149 ''"An army was led by Toirdhealbhach Ua&amp;nbsp;Briain and the men of Munster into Connacht, until they arrived at Magh Ua&amp;nbsp;mBriuin; they carried off a great spoil of cattle, and demolished Dún-Gaillmhe; and Ua&amp;nbsp;Lochlainn, lord of Corca-Modhruadh, was drowned in the (river) Gaillimh."'' Again, the mention of Magh Ua&amp;nbsp;mBriuin - an alternative name for [[Maigh Seola]] - demonstrates the destruction of Gallimhe and its fleet was merely one tactic employed by O&amp;nbsp;Brian. Kinsmen and vassals would only stay loyal as long as a king could deliver the goods to ensure their loyalty, hence the rich plains were plundered of their goods, food and fine cattle. It also had the additional prize of weakening O&amp;nbsp;Conchobair's prime vassal in the area, Ua&amp;nbsp;Flaithbheartaigh.

Ua Lochlainn was of the Corcu Mo Druad, vassals of O&amp;nbsp;Brian, and strategically located across Galway Bay. Thus it is possible that while O Brian led his army by land, Ua&amp;nbsp;Lochlainn sailed across the bay and the two inflicted a sea-and-land siege of Gallimhe; this possibility is obliquely hinted at in the manner of Ua&amp;nbsp;Lochlainn's death. It may even be that, contending for the lordship of Galway Bay - from which plundering raids could be made into Clan Fergal, Maigh Seola, Meadraige and [[Uí Fiachrach Aidhne]] - O&amp;nbsp;Brian may have been letting Ua&amp;nbsp;Lochlainn unleash himself against a prime adversary.

In a surprising turn of events, in 1151, O&amp;nbsp;Brian was deposed as King of Munster by his son, Muircheartach. Muircheartach was subsequently captured ''"by treachery"'' by ''"Tadhg son of Diarmaid O&amp;nbsp;Brian and Diarmaid Súgach O Conchobhair"'' and delivered to his father. However, Tadhg mac Diarmaid O&amp;nbsp;Brian rose against O&amp;nbsp;Brian in rebellion, with the result that ''"Toirdhealbhach son of Ruaidhrí O Conchobhair came with him to defend the kingship of Munster for him."''!

==De Burgh's siege of 1230==

[[Cathal Crobderg Ua Conchobair]] had owed his position as King of Connacht to King John, and the support of the latter's vassals in Ireland. In addition, he was able to obtain recognition of his son, [[Aedh mac Cathal Crobdearg Ua Conchobair]] as his heir.

In the year after Cathal's death in 1224, Aedh had to face a rebellion by Donn Oge Mageraghty of Sil Muirdeag, Aedh Ua Flaithbertaigh of [[Maigh Seola]] and an invasion by O Neill of Tir Eoghain from Ulster. O Neill and Aedh's rebellious vassals then crowned Turlough mac Ruaidri O Conchobair King of Connacht in opposition to Aedh, who was supported by only a few vassals such as MacDermott of Moylourg and O Flynn of the Cuirc remaining loyal. With the help of his Norman allies, Aedh was eventually able to suppress the rebellion, though ''"there was not a church or territory in Connacht at that time that had not been plundered and desolated."'' The war was made worse by ''"An oppressive malady raged in the province of Connacht at this time: it was a heavy burning sickness, which left the large towns desolate, without a single survivor."''

One incident during the war had given Aedh cause for concern: his erstwhile allies, the Normans of Leinster and Munster, had invaded south Connacht ''"and slew all the people that they caught, and burned their dwellings and villages."'' Aedh was furious at this because it was not by his command, and because the Normans ''"were themselves excited by envy and rapacity, as soon as they had heard what good things the Lord Justice and his English followers had obtained in Connacht at that time."'' It was a sign of things to come.

Aedh mac Cathal was murdered by the Normans in 1228 and [[Aedh mac Ruaidri Ua Conchobair]] was chosen by the Normans and the chiefs of Connacht to take his place. Yet in 1230 Aedh and his vassals turned on the Normans, vowing ''"they would never own a lord who should bring them to make submission to the Galls. They made then great raids on the Galls, Aed son of Ruaidri and the men of West Connacht plundering the young son of William and Adam Duff, while Donn Oc and the sons of Magnus with the new levies of Sil Murray plundered Mac Gosdelb and Tir Maine as far as Athlone."'' It was in response to this that [[Richard Mor de Burgh]] led an army into Connacht ''"and desolated a large portion of that country." De Burgh brought with him [[Felim mac Cathal Crobderg Ua Conchobair]] whom he intended to make king in place of Aedh. They crossed the Shannon at Athlone and made straight for Gallimhe.

The Dún at Gallimhe was being held and defended by Aedh Ua Flaithbertaig, who still held for Aedh mac Ruaidri (Ua Flaithbertaigh had been exiled into [[Iar Connacht]] by Aedh mac Cathal for his rebellion) . Apparently de Burgh was just reaching the Dún (and a highly apprehensive Ua Flaithbertaigh) ''"when Aed mac Ruaidri came to his help with the Connachtmen, including the sons of Muirchertach O Conchobair."  At some point in the fighting Aedh seems to have lost, or ceded possession of, the Dún, because the Annals of Connacht states that ''"They were on the western bank of the Galway River and the Galls on the eastern."'' However, this does not seem to have been a decisive factor for de Burgh; as much as a week passed with ''"much fighting ... between them every day, and in this condition the Galls remained, obtaining neither pledge nor hostage nor submissions from the Connachtmen."'' Dissatisfied with the inconclusiveness of the conflict, de Burgh cut his losses and left in the direction of [[Cong, County Mayo|Cong]] ''"to pursue the cattle and folk which had fled into the mountains and recesses of the countryside and the sea-islands."''

But as subsequent events would show, the strategic position of Dún Béal Gallimhe had made an impression upon de&amp;nbsp;Burgh, and he would be back.

==De Burgh's siege of 1232==
In 1232 de Burgh returned in force and took Fedhlim O'Conor prisoner, replacing him by Hugh O'Conor. Having taken control of the castle de Burgh made a number of substantial additions to the building. &lt;ref name= HG&gt; {{cite book|title=The History of the Town and Country of the Town of Galway|first= James|last = Hardiman|page=48}} &lt;/ref&gt;

When Hugh O'Conor died in 1233 Fedhlim O'Conor regained his freedom and retook the town and castle. He demolished the castle works of de Burgh. &lt;ref name= HG/&gt;

==O Donnell's siege of 1596==
During the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]] [[Hugh Roe O'Donnell|Hugh Ruadh O'Donnell]], in league with other chieftains, attacked the county of Galway in 1596 and, after burning Athenry, marched to the town of Galway. There they asked for provisions but were refused, retaliating by setting fire to outlying houses on the edge of the town. O'Donnell's forces were then driven off by cannon fire and an armed sally by the defenders and retreated to Mayo.&lt;ref name= HG/&gt;

==Lord Forbes's siege of 1642==
On the morning of 7 August 1642, to the ''"considerable agitation and suspense [of the] town"'', a naval squadron of seventeen ships appeared in Galway Bay. Led by Alexander, 11th Lord Forbes (died 1671), they had come to relieve the garrison of Forthill{{ref|1|1}} at the request of the English Parliament, and which had authorised him, as Lieutenant-General, to waste the coasts of Ireland. Launching long boats from the ship, Forthill was resupplied with food, arms and ammunition. Forbes then sent a messenger with a letter for Mayor Walter Lynch [[Hiberno-Norman|fitz]] James, ordering them to ''"confess themselves to have been rebels, and humbly submitting to beg his majesty's intercession for them to the parliament of England, and to declare they would admit such governors as the king and state should appoint, and until then put themselves under the protection of Lord Forbes."''

Mayor Lynch and the town council utterly refused the terms, to the surprise and anger of Lord Forbes. They instead made representations to the [[Earl of Clanricarde]] - who was at the time a neutral - for protection. Clanricarde in turn communicated to Forbes that, should he make war against the town, it would be both a breach of the peace and endanger the country by bringing yet another area into [[Irish Confederate Wars|the war]]. Furthermore, he made it clear that, should the citizens become actively hostile against Forbes, there would be nothing he could do to influence them.

According to [[James Hardiman]] ''" ... Forbes, stimulated by Willoughby and Ashley"'' - captains of the besieged Forthill - ''"and governed by the advice of Hugh Peters, whom he brought with him as his chaplain ... was entirely deaf to every remonstrance of reason or discretion."'' Being unable to directly assault the town itself, Forbes landed men west of the town and took possession of the [[Claddagh]]{{ref|2|2}}, on the west bank of the [[River Corrib|Corrib]]. All of the town's surrounding suburbs and villages were burned and destroyed; dozens of locals were killed, assaulted and raped. St. Mary's Church in the Claddagh was badly defaced; in its graveyard, coffins were dug up as Lord Forbes's troops searched the bodies for rings, gold chains and the like.

Forbes placed ''"two pieces of ordnance"'', or cannons, at St. Mary's and used them to bombard the city. However, they had little effect and by early September Forbes's men were becoming irritated at both their lack of progress and lack of payment. On 7 September he cut his losses and sailed for Limerick. Forthill was once more under siege and on its own, Clanricarde's political stock had plummeted as he had been unable to prevent the sacking, and any waverers among the people of Galway were now solidly on the [[Irish Confederate Wars|Irish Confederate]] side.

{{main article|Siege of Galway}}
The Parliamentary siege took place from August 1651 to May 1652 during the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]]. [[Galway]] was the last city held by Irish Catholic forces in Ireland and its fall signalled the end to most organised resistance to the Parliamentarian conquest of the country.

==Ginkel's siege of 1691==
This short siege took place during the [[Williamite Wars]]. After his success at the nearby [[Battle of Aughrim]] on 12 July 1692 (old style) the Dutch Williamite General [[Godert de Ginkell, 1st Earl of Athlone|Godert de Ginkell]] in command of the English forces decided to capture the town of Galway before advancing on Limerick. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite book|title=The history of the town and county of the town of Galway|first=James|last=Hardiman|page= 158}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Galways's defences were depleted but food supplies were adequate and reinforcements had been promised. The town's Governor, [[Henry Dillon, 8th Viscount Dillon|Lord Dillon]], and the military commander, Lieutenant-General D'Ussone, decided to hold out rather than surrender. On 20 July 1692 a column of 14,000 English infantry surrounded the town and occupied an outlying fort. Other troops cut off the route by which reinforcements would arrive. Under pressure from the townspeople the Governor surrendered and the treaty was signed the following day, under the terms of which the town would be surrendered on 26 July with free passage to anyone who wished to leave and free pardon to those who stayed.

The Governor and the garrison forces were escorted to Limerick and Sir [[Henry Belasyse (died 1717)|Henry Belasyse]] appointed as the new Governor.

'''Swing dance'''  is a group of dances that developed with the [[swing music|swing]] style of [[jazz]] music in the 1920s–1940s, with the origins of each dance predating the popular "swing era". During the swing era, there were hundreds of styles of swing dancing, but those that have survived beyond that era include: [[Lindy Hop]], [[Balboa (dance)|Balboa]], [[Collegiate shag|Collegiate Shag]], and [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anchorsteps.com/lindy.htm|title=What is Lindy Hop?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rebirth&gt;''The Rebirth of Shag''. Dir. Ryan Martin. ''Vimeo''. 2014 &lt;http://vimeo.com/88253085&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the most well-known of these dances is the [[Lindy Hop]],  which originated in [[Harlem]] in the early 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is swing dancing? |url=http://studio88swingen.com/dance-styles |access-date=October 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the majority of swing dances began in [[African Americans|African American]] communities as [[vernacular dance|vernacular]] [[African American dance]]s, some swing era dances, like Balboa, developed outside of these communities.

Somewhat surprisingly, "swing dance" was not commonly used to identify a group of dances until the latter half of the 20th century. Historically, the term "Swing" referred to the style of jazz music, which inspired the evolution of the dance. [[Jitterbug]] is an umbrella term that denotes all forms of swing dance, though it is often used as a synonym for the six-count derivative of Lindy Hop called "East Coast Swing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Jitterbug |url=http://www.streetswing.com/histmain/z3jtrbg.htm |access-date=October 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also common to use the word to identify a kind of dancer (i.e., a ''swing dancer'').  A "jitterbug" might prefer to dance Lindy Hop, Shag, or any of the other swing dances.  The term was famously associated with swing era band leader [[Cab Calloway]] because, as he put it, "[The dancers] look like a bunch of jitterbugs out there on the floor due to their fast, often bouncy movements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Christine Zona|first1=Chris George|title=Gotta Ballroom|date=2008|publisher=Human Kinetics, Inc.|location=United States|isbn=9780736059077|pages=13–214|url=https://books.google.com/?id=42gtx61V0KgC&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=%22They%20look%20like%20a%20bunch%20of%20jitterbugs%20out%20there%20on%20the%20floor%22&amp;pg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q=%22They%20look%20like%20a%20bunch%20of%20jitterbugs%20out%20there%20on%20the%20floor%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "swing dancing" is often extended to include other dances that do not have certain characteristics of traditional swing dances: [[West Coast Swing]], [[Carolina Shag]], [[East Coast Swing]], [[Hand dancing|Hand Dancing]], [[Jive (dance)|Jive]], [[Rock and Roll (dance)|Rock and Roll]], [[Modern Jive]], and other dances developed during the 1940s and later.  A strong tradition of social and competitive [[Boogie-woogie (dance)|boogie woogie]] and Rock 'n' Roll in Europe add these dances to their local swing dance cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Beautiful Times|title=Swing dance|url=https://thebeautifultimes.wordpress.com/the-swing-era/swing-dance/|website=The Beautiful Times|publisher=wordpress|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original forms dating from the 1920s and early 1930s==


* [[Lindy Hop]] evolved in the early 1930s.&lt;ref name="Frankie Manning: Ambassador of Lindy Hop"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manning|first1=Frankie|title=Frankie Manning: Ambassador of Lindy Hop|date=2007|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=9781592135639|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cPdDLXYWWaUC&amp;lpg=PA274&amp;dq=international%20encyclopedia%20of%20dance%20swing&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q=lindy%20hop&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a dance of African American origin characterized by a high degree of physical vigor.&lt;ref&gt;Spring, Howard. Swing and the Lindy Hop: Dance, Venue, Media, and Tradition. Vol. 15. University of Illinois Press, 1997. 183-207&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterized by an 8-count circular basic or "swing out" and has an emphasis on improvisation and the ability to easily adapt to include other steps in 8-count and 6-count rhythms.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manning|first1=Frankie|title=Frankie Manning: Ambassador of Lindy Hop|date=2007|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=9781592135639|page=230|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cPdDLXYWWaUC&amp;lpg=PA274&amp;dq=international%20encyclopedia%20of%20dance%20swing&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q=lindy%20hop&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Lindy Hop" is often attributed to "Shorty" George Snowden during an interaction with a reporter who asked him what kind of dance they were doing. Because Charles Lindbergh had just made his famous solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean, Shorty George is said to have replied, "the Lindy Hop." Whether it was Shorty George who coined the name is disputed by some writers, but, in any case, the name stuck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pritchett|first1=Judy|title="Shorty" George Snowden|url=http://www.savoystyle.com/shorty_george.html|website=www.savoystyle.com|publisher=1995-2006|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Savoy Ballroom]] in Harlem was the home of the Lindy Hop. As its popularity increased, professional troupes were formed. These troupes toured the United States and Europe performing versions of the Lindy Hop.&lt;ref&gt;Spring, Howard. Swing and the Lindy Hop: Dance, Venue, Media, and Tradition. Vol. 15. University of Illinois Press, 1997. 183-207.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Balboa (dance)|Balboa]], also known as "Bal" is an eight-count dance that's done in closed position. The earliest form of the dance (often called "Pure Balboa") evolved in the mostly conservative dance halls of southern California where space was limited and strict codes of conduct were enforced.  These dance halls usually prohibited the wild kicks of the Charleston and Lindy Hop.  Pure Balboa is characterized by an upright posture with partners standing chest to chest.  There are no spins or turns and the dancers remain in contact through the upper chest at all times. Not leaving much scope for variations, pure Balboa is an intrinsically very simple dance. The few step variations generally play with the rhythm or look and feel (style) from below the knee downwards and deal with changes in direction. Balboa is frequently danced to fast [[jazz]] (usually anything from 180 to 320&amp;nbsp;BPM [[beats per minute]]), though many like to Balboa to slower (170-190&amp;nbsp;BPM) [[Tempo|tempi]]. While most dancers differentiate between pure Balboa and [[Bal Swing]], both are considered to be a part of the dance. Bal Swing evolved from Balboa when original Balboa dancers experimented with fancier variations of the dance which forced the chest to chest connection to be broken. In this form of Bal a variety of spins, turns, dips, tricks, and even air steps are introduced. These improvisations are permissible provided the overall style and framework remain true in spirit to the original dance and are combined with original Balboa footwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guest|first1=Dan|title=Balboa History|url=http://www.lindycircle.com/history/balboa/|website=www.lindycircle.com|publisher=10/17/2005|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Collegiate Shag]] (or "Shag") is done primarily to uptempo swing and sometimes pre-swing jazz music (185-200+ [[beats per minute]]). It is believed that the dance originated in the Carolinas in the 1920s,&lt;ref name=rebirth/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Shag Latest Dance” ''Blytheville Courier News'' (Arkansas) 25 July 1929: 5 [Research credit: Forrest Outman]&lt;/ref&gt; later spreading across the United States during the 1930s.  The shag is still danced today by swing dance enthusiasts worldwide. Shag is believed to have been the first and most popular swing dance of the original swing era&lt;ref name=rebirth/&gt;
* [[Lindy Charleston]] is very similar to the original Charleston of the 1920s, only the pulse of the dance is lowered (the up-and-down motion in the pulse emphasizes the downward movement) to match that of the Lindy Hop.  This form of Charleston includes a number of positions, including side-by-side, hand-to-hand, and tandem.  In "jockey position", the closed position is opened out so that both partners may face forward, without breaking apart.  In side-by-side Charleston, partners open the closed position entirely, so that their only points of connection are at their touching hips and arm contact, wherein the leader's right hand and arm touch the follower's back and the follower's left hand and arm touch the leader's shoulder and arm.  Both partners then swing their free arms as they would in solo Charleston. In both jockey and side-by-side Charleston, the leader steps back onto his left foot, while the follower steps back onto her right. In tandem Charleston, one partner stands in front of the other (usually the follower, though the arrangement may vary), both face in the same direction to start, and both begin by stepping back onto the left foot.  The partner behind holds the front partner's hands at the latter's hip height, and their joined arms swing backwards and forwards, as in the basic step.

==Forms dating from the late 1930s and early 1940s==


*[[St. Louis shag]] (or "Shag") is a dance that evolved out of the [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | publisher = StreetSwing.com
 | url = http://www.streetswing.com/histmain/z3shagst.htm
 | accessdate = 2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As its name suggests, it is recognized as having started in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], Missouri. St. Louis Shag features a stationary 8-count basic that is most commonly composed of triple-step, kick, triple-step, kick. It is a very fast closed position dance that is usually done to [[Stomp (music)|stomp]], [[Jump (music)|jump]], and [[Boogie-woogie (music)|boogie-woogie]] music.

* [[Big Apple (dance)|Big Apple]] is both a partner dance and a "called" circle dance that originated in the Afro-American community of the United States in the beginning of the 20th century.  The dance that eventually became known as the Big Apple is speculated to have been created in the early 1930s by African-American youth dancing at the Big Apple Club, which was at the former [[House of Peace Synagogue]] on Park Street in [[Columbia, South Carolina]].&lt;ref name="wilkinson"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilkinson|2003b}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The synagogue was converted into a black [[juke joint]] called the "Big Apple Night Club".&lt;ref name="wilkinson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="danguest"&gt;{{Harvnb|Guest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="barrett"&gt;{{Harvnb|Barrett}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jitterbuzz"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jitterbuzz}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Little Apple (dance)|Little Apple]] This dance was a partnered version of the Big Apple, which is also believed to have originated in the Carolinas of the Southern United States.&lt;ref name=rebirth/&gt;

==Derivatives of swing dance from the 1940s and 1950s==


* [[East Coast Swing]] is a simpler 6-count variation that spawned from the six-count variations of the Lindy Hop.  It evolved with swing-band music of the 1940s and the work of the [[Arthur Murray]] dance studios in the 1940s.&lt;ref name = "caknsw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centralhome.com/ballroomcountry/swing.htm|title=Swing History origins of Swing Dance|year=1996|accessdate=2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as Six-count Swing, Triple-Step Swing, or Single-Time Swing.  East Coast Swing has very simple structure and footwork along with basic moves and styling. It is popular for its simple nature and is often danced to slow, medium, or fast tempo [[jazz]], blues, or rock and roll.  Occasionally, Rockabilly, aka Rock-a-billy, is mistaken for East Coast Swing, but Rockabilly is more closely related to Western Swing.
* [[West Coast Swing]] was developed in the 1940s, as a stylistic variation on the Los Angeles style of the Lindy Hop. It is a slotted dance and is done to a wide variety of music including: [[blues]], [[rock and roll]], [[Country music|country western]], pop, hip hop, [[smooth jazz|smooth]], [[cool jazz]], R&amp; B, and funk music.&lt;ref name="zzounds.com"&gt;"The History of Swing Dancing at ZZounds."

* [[Western Swing]] has long been the name for jazz-influenced western music of the 1940s and, by extension, two-step, line dancing or swing dance done to such music. Contemporary 21st century [[Country Swing]]  or dancing or "Country Western Swing Dancing"  (C/W Swing) has a distinct culture, with classes and instructional videos on YouTube and DVD teaching dips, lifts, aerials and flips. It adds variations from other country dances, swing styles, salsa and more. As the name suggests, it is most often danced to [[Country music|country and western music]].
* [[Boogie-woogie (dance)|Boogie-woogie]] developed originally in the 1940s, with the rise of [[boogie woogie]] music. It is popular today in Europe, and was considered by some to be the European counterpart to East Coast Swing, a 6-count dance standardized for the American ballroom industry. It is danced to rock music of various kinds, blues or boogie woogie music but usually not to jazz. As the dance has developed, it has also taken to 8-count variations and swing outs similar to Lindy Hop, while keeping the original boogie woogie footwork.
* [[Carolina Shag]] was danced along the strands between Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and Wilmington, North Carolina, during the 1940s but, during the 1990s and later, has expanded to many other places. It is most often associated with [[beach music]], which refers to songs that are rhythm-and-blues-based and, according to [[Bo Bryan]], a noted shag historian and resident of Beaufort County, is a term that was coined at [[Carolina Beach]], North Carolina.
* [[Imperial Swing]] is a cross between East Coast and West Coast Swing as it is done in slot and in the round. It started at the [[George Edick's Club Imperial|Club Imperial]] in St Louis. George Edick, who owned the club, let teenagers dance on the lower level and the swing dancers of the time taught them what was learned from their trips to the east coast. As people traveled around, they added parts of west coast, bop and Carolina shag to complement the dance and make it distinctive. "The Imperial" has elements of "East Coast", "West Coast", "Carolina Shag" and "Bop".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ImperialSwing.com |url=http://www.imperialswing.com/ |access-date=October 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jive (dance)|Jive]] is a dance of International Style Ballroom dancing. It is a very upbeat dance in which the performers look to be hopping off the ground. It initially was based on Eastern swing taken to England by American Troops in World War II and evolved before becoming the now standardized form of today.
* [[Skip jive|Skip Jive]] is a British variant of the Jive, popular in the 1950s and 1960s, danced to [[trad jazz]].
* [[Modern Jive]] (also known as [[LeRoc]] and [[Ceroc]]©) developed in the 1980s, reputedly from a French form of Jive.  Modern Jive is not technically of the Jive family, which typically use a 6-count pattern of various combinations of walking and triple steps (Ballroom Jive - back/replace triple-triple; Swing Jive - triple-triple back/replace), etc.  It is pared down to a simple box step and concentrates on the simpler forms of couple dance styling, gauged to provide a social atmosphere rather than technical aptitude. There are debates about whether it is a form of swing dancing due to lack of syncopations, rhythmic footwork variations, a static partner dynamic, and lack of swinging music, amongst the swing community at large, but they do consider themselves a style of swing.
* [[Rock and Roll (dance)|Rock and Roll]] - Developing in the 1950s in response to [[rock and roll|rock and roll music]], rock-and-roll is very popular in Australia and danced socially as well as competitively and in performances. The style has a long association with Lindy Hop in that country, as many of the earliest Lindy Hoppers in the early 1990s moved to Lindy Hop from a rock-and-roll tradition. There are ongoing debates about whether rock-and-roll constitutes swing dancing, particularly in reference to the music to which it is danced: there is some debate as to whether or not it [[Swung note|swings]]. 
* [[Acrobatic Rock'n'Roll]] – Popular in Europe, acrobatic rock'n'roll is popularly associated with Russian gymnasts who took up the dance, though it is popular throughout Europe today. It is a performance dance and sport rather than a social dance, though there are people who remove the acrobatic stunts to dance it on a social level.
* [[Hand dancing|Washington Hand Dancing]] originated around Washington, DC in the mid-1950s,  and a new generation of dancers started innovating and dancing to Motown music. From its very beginning, DC Hand-dance was referred to and called “DC Hand-Dance/Hand-Dancing”, “DC Swing”, “DC Style” (swing) and “fast dance” (meaning DC Hand-Dance).  This is the first time a version of “swing” dance was termed “hand-dance/hand-dancing”.  DC Hand-Dance is characterized by very smooth footwork and movements, and close-in and intricate hand-turns, danced to a 6-beat, 6-count dance rhythm.  The more modern footwork consists of smooth and continuous floor contact, sliding and gliding-type steps versus hopping and jumping-type steps of the older style which stylistically still held elements of its Jitterbug/Lindy Hop roots, and there are no aerials.
* [[Push (dance)|Push]] and [[Whip (dance)|Whip]] are [[Texas]] forms of swing dance developed in the 1940s and 1950s.  They are slotted swing dances, danced to a wide variety of music including blues, pop, jazz, and rock and roll.  Similar to West Coast Swing, they emphasize the closed position, double resistance/rock step, and lead-follow and also incorporate intricate arm work.  Slow Whip is a variation on Whip/Push that is danced to slow blues music, typically 60&amp;nbsp;BPM or slower.

==Swing dancing today==

Swing dancing was most popular in the 1930s and 1940s, but it still continues today. Dance moves have evolved with the music. Swing dancing styles are the foundation of many other dance styles including disco, country line dancing, and hip hop.  Swing dancing clubs and contests are still held around the world.&lt;ref name="zzounds.com"/&gt;

==Competition, social dancing and music==

===Competition===
Traditionally, distinctions are made between "Ballroom Swing" and "Jazz Dance Swing" styles. East Coast Swing is a standardized dance in "American Style" [[Ballroom dancing]], while Jive is a standardized dance in "International Style"; however both of these fall under the "Ballroom Swing" umbrella.

Jazz Dance forms (evolved in dance halls) versus ballroom forms (created for ballroom competition format) are different in appearance.  Jazz Dance forms include Lindy Hop, [[Balboa (dance)|Balboa]], [[Collegiate Shag]], and [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]].
{{original research|section|date= May 2010}}

====Types of competition====

Dance competitions specify which forms are to be judged, and are generally available in four different formats:

# Strictly:  One couple competing together in various heats, to randomly selected music, where no pre-choreographed steps are allowed.
# [[Jack and Jill (dance)|Jack and Jill]]:  Where leaders and followers are randomly matched for the competition.  In initial rounds, leaders and followers usually compete individually, but in final rounds, scoring depends on the ability of the partner you draw and your ability to work with that partner.  Some competitions hold a Jill-and-Jack division where leaders must be women and followers must be men.
# Showcase:  One couple competing together for a single song which has been previously choreographed.
# Classic:  Similar to Showcase but with restrictions on lifts, drops, moves where one partner supports the weight of the other partner, and moves where the partners are not in physical contact.

====Levels====
In West Coast Swing the competitions are divided into sections by level of experience.
The levels are Newcomer, Novice, Intermediate, Advanced and All-Star. There is no official system in the United States to ensure that couples dance at the appropriate level of experience. Competitors should keep track of their own points and register accordingly at competitions. Once you earn 7 points in a level, you can no longer dance at that level.

The World Swing Dance Council holds a Registry of all points attained at different levels of competition, however not all competitions qualify as "Registry Points Events".

&lt;ref&gt;"Competition Rules." - Swing Dance America. Accessed April 10, 2015. http://www.swingdanceamerica.com/competition-rules.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no points system for the majority of Lindy Hop competitions.

====Judging criteria====

Swing dancing falls under the American Rhythm category. There are several different categories at competitions depending on what type of dance you do.&lt;ref name="usadance.org"&gt;"DanceSport - Competition Guides - For the Competitor - USADance.org." DanceSport - Competition Guides - For the Competitor - USADance.org. Accessed April 10, 2015. http://usadance.org/dancesport/competition-guides/for-the-competitor/.&lt;/ref&gt; Each form of Swing Dance, and each organization within those forms, will have various rules, but those most often used are pulled and adapted from Ballroom usage.

Judging for competition is based on the three "T's" (''below'') as well as showmanship&lt;ref name = "swungover"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swungover.wordpress.com/2012/01/05/on-judging-part-3-swing-judging-philosophy-101/|title=On Judging, Part 3: Swing Judging Philosophy 101|year=2012|accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; (unless the contest in question designates the audience as the deciding factor).
The three "T's" consist of:
# Timing - Related to tempo &amp; rhythm of the music.
# Teamwork - How well a leader and follower dance together and lead/follow dance variations.
# Technique - How clean and precise the cooperative dancing is executed.

Showmanship consists of presentation, creativity, costumes, and difficulty.

Lindy Hop's most prestigious events have never used these criteria, usually having the simple judging value as who was the best/most-impressive Lindy Hop couple. The Harvest Moon Ball competition in New York City, The American Vernacular Jazz Institute's Hellzapoppin' Competition, and the Ultimate Lindy Hop Showdown all fall into this category.

====Heats====
Most competition dance floors can only hold about 12 couples dancing at a time. If the number of participants is larger than what the floor can hold, the competition will hold qualifying rounds. Once they get to 24 couples there will then be the quarterfinal round (2 separate rounds of about 12 each), then the semifinal (1 round of about 12), and finally the final round (1 round, usually 6 or 7 couples).&lt;ref name="usadance.org"/&gt;

====Team formations====

Additionally a "Team Formation" division may also be specified at a competition.  Under this category, a minimum of 3 to 5 couples (depending on individual competition rules) perform a pre-choreographed routine to a song of their choosing, where the group dances in [[synchronization]] and into different formations.  This division is also judged using the three "T's" and showmanship; however the criteria now apply to the team as a whole.

===Social swing dancing===

Many, if not most, of the swing dances listed above are popular as [[social dance]]s, with vibrant local communities that hold dances with DJs and live bands that play music most appropriate for the preferred dance style. There are frequently active local clubs and associations, classes with independent or studio-/school-affiliated teachers and workshops with visiting or local teachers. Most of these dance styles — as with many other styles — also feature special events, such as camps or [[Lindy exchange]]s.

===Music===

The historical development of particular swing dance styles was often in response to trends in popular music. For example, 1920s and solo Charleston was - and is - usually danced to 2/4 [[ragtime]] music or traditional jazz, Lindy Hop was danced to [[Swing (genre)|swing music]] (a kind of swinging [[jazz]]), and Lindy Charleston to either traditional or swing jazz.  West Coast Swing is usually danced to Pop, R&amp;B, Blues, or Funk.  Western Swing and Push/Whip are usually danced to [[country and western]] or [[Blues]] music.  There are local variations on these musical associations in each dance scene, often informed by local DJs, dance teachers and bands.

Modern swing dance bands active in the U.S. during the 1990s and 2000s include many contemporary jazz [[big bands]], swing revival bands with a national presence such as Lavay Smith and Her Red Hot Skillet Lickers (based in San Francisco), and local/regional jazz bands that specialize in 1930s-1940s swing/Lindy dance music, such as [[The Swingout Big Band]], [[White Heat Swing Orchestra]], and [[Beantown Swing Orchestra]] (Boston), [[The Boilermaker Jazz Band]] (Pittsburgh), the [[Tony Balluff|Southside Aces]] (Minneapolis), Gordon Webster Septet (New York), Jonathan Stout and His Campus Five (Los Angeles) and The Jonathan Stout Orchestra featuring Hilary Alexander (Los Angeles), The Flat Cats (Chicago), [[Glenn Crytzer]] and his Syncopators (Seattle), the Solomon Douglas Swingtet (Seattle), The Gina Knight Orchestra (Chicago and Joliet, IL), the [[Solomon Douglas Swingtet]] and the [[Tom Cunningham Orchestra]] (Washington, D.C.), Sonoran Swing (Arizona), and [[The Bill Elliott Swing Orchestra]] (Los Angeles).

'''''The Children's Monologues''''' was a theatrical performance, produced by [[Amber Sainsbury]] at [[Old Vic Theatre]] in London on 14 November 2010 and at [[Royal Court Theatre]] on 25 October 2015 for the benefit of [[Dramatic Need]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11754201|title=BBC News - Old Vic hosts one-off Dramatic Needs charity show|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured the adapted stories of children’s first-hand experiences in [[South Africa]] being retold and re-interpreted by and performed by actors such as [[Sir Ben Kingsley]], [[Benedict Cumberbatch]], [[Tom Hiddleston]], [[Gemma Arterton]] and [[Eddie Redmayne]], directed by [[Danny Boyle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Children’s Monologues|url=http://www.thecrossedcow.com/2010/11/16/the-childrens-monologues/|publisher=The Crossed Cow|accessdate=27 June 2012|date=16 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227213735/http://www.thecrossedcow.com/2010/11/16/the-childrens-monologues/|archivedate=27 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The play was performed on 7 February, in the lead-up to [[World Aids Day]] 2010, with 15 actors, 7 writers and director Danny Boyle participating. The play was dedicated to the work of [[Dramatic Need]] and intended to raise money for the Pete Patsa Arts Centre. Writers adapted 12 monologues from personal tales handwritten by children living in abysmal conditions in [[rural]] [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="South African"&gt;{{cite web|title=Arterton, Boyle and Kingsley collaborate for SA’s children|url=http://www.thesouthafrican.com/news/uk-community/arterton-boyle-and-kingsley-collaborate-for-sa%E2%80%99s-children-2.htm|publisher=The South African|accessdate=27 June 2012|date=9 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These monologues were performed on stage by the actors at the Old Vic Theatre in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dramatic Need :: The Children's Monologues|url=http://www.dramaticneed.org/monologues.php|publisher=Dramatic Need|accessdate=27 June 2012|date=November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831193303/http://www.dramaticneed.org/monologues.php|archivedate=31 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The stories==
The Children’s Monologues soliloquize the testimonies and re-lived memories of young people, some still small children. Some struggled with horrible realities of death and violence, while others shared cherished moments of rare and short-lived happiness. The monologues ranged from light hearted tales of birthday parties and the joy of birthday oranges, to a redemptive tale of a gangster-gone-good to absolutely harrowing, brutally raw stories of rape and violation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Scarlett|title=The Childrens Monologues- Old Vic – 14 November 2010|url=http://scarlettgreen.wordpress.com/2010/11/16/the-childrens-monologues-old-vic-14-november-2010/|publisher=Word Press|accessdate=27 June 2012|date=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Walter E. Ellis''' (June 24, 1960 – December 1, 2013), also known as the '''Milwaukee North Side Strangler''', was an American [[serial killer]] who [[rape]]d and [[strangled]] seven women in the city of [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] between 1986 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://murderpedia.org/male.E/images/ellis_walter/criminal-complaint.pdf Profile], murderpedia.org; accessed April 21, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
The North Side Strangler victims were all African-American women. Milwaukee Police Department Homicide Detective Steven Spingola authored an e-magazine article, ''The Killer in Our Midst: the Case of Milwaukee's North Side Strangler'', which chronicled his investigation of the homicides of Sheila Farrior and Florence McCormick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://badgerwordsmith.com/books.html#killer|title=BWS Books|publisher=Badger Wordsmith|date=2001-09-11|accessdate=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trained in criminal background analysis, Spingola provided a detailed profile of the killer, which Milwaukee talk-radio host and former Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeff Wagner described as "eerily accurate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wagner |first=Jeff |url=http://www.620wtmj.com/shows/jeffwagner/57750552.html |title=Portrait Of A Milwaukee Serial Killer |publisher=620 WTMJ |accessdate=2012-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307084605/http://www.620wtmj.com/shows/jeffwagner/57750552.html |archivedate=March 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spingola, however, retired before Detectives Gilbert Hernandez and Kathy Hein of the Milwaukee Police Department's cold case homicide unit, reexamined DNA evidence that linked a suspect to the homicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amended Criminal Complaint|year=2009|url=http://media.trb.com/media/acrobat/2009-09/49185745.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2013-04-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105085937/http://media.trb.com/media/acrobat/2009-09/49185745.pdf|archivedate=2012-11-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todaystmj4.com/news/local/58314652.html |title=Five New Charges Filed in North Side Strangler Case |publisher=Todaystmj4.com |date=2012-07-27 |accessdate=2012-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927154718/http://www.todaystmj4.com/news/local/58314652.html |archivedate=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 7, 2009, Walter E. Ellis (then aged 49), was arrested on suspicion of being the notorious serial killer. Ellis had been arrested 12 times between 1981 and 1998, when he was sentenced to five years for reckless endangerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leamanczyk |first=Lauren |url=http://www.todaystmj4.com/news/local/57658317.html?ref=jsonline |title=Relief For Families of Strangler Victims |publisher=Todaystmj4.com |date=1986-10-10 |accessdate=2012-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927154642/http://www.todaystmj4.com/news/local/57658317.html?ref=jsonline |archivedate=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially represented by Attorney Russell Jones in defense of these claims, Ellis pleaded not guilty, and stood prepared to defend himself.  Jones was withdrawn from the case, and then on February 18, 2011, Ellis pleaded no contest to seven murders or intentional homicides, and was convicted despite not admitting his guilt. On February 24, 2011, he was given seven life sentences, to be served consecutively, without the possibility of parole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vielmetti|first=Bruce|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/crime/116824883.html|title=Ellis gets life - 7 times over|publisher=JSOnline|date=2011-02-24|accessdate=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he was convicted, he was initially held at the [[Dodge Correctional Institution]] in [[Waupun, Wisconsin]], for Assessment and Evaluation in accordance with the Wisconsin Administrative Code, from where he was transferred to the [[Wisconsin Secure Program Facility]] in [[Boscobel, Wisconsin]]. In November 2011, Ellis was transferred to the maximum custody unit at the [[South Dakota State Penitentiary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vielmetti|first=Bruce|url=http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/134628628.html?page=1#!page=1&amp;pageSize=10&amp;sort=newestfirst|title=Serial killer Walter Ellis staying connected in South Dakota|publisher=JSOnline|date=2011-11-28|accessdate=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the name "North Side Strangler" in reference to the case has been limited to one local news organization, WTMJ, Channel 4, which is believed to have coined the nickname,&lt;ref&gt;Milwaukee Magazine, Pressroom column, August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; although it has been picked up by some bloggers and by British media as well. Use of the nickname, however, has also been a subject of criticism in other Milwaukee media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kane|first=Eugene|title=Nickname aggravates family grief|work=JSOnline|publisher=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=2009-09-09|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/58275382.html|accessdate=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foxtrot-echo.blogspot.com/2009/05/so-were-calling-him-north-side-strangle.html|work=The Chief|title=So We're Calling Him the "North Side Strangler" Now?|publisher=Foxtrot-echo.blogspot.com|date=2009-05-19|accessdate=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Ellis died at a [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]] hospital on December 1, 2013 from apparent natural causes, according to a South Dakota Department of Corrections news release.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://doc.sd.gov/documents/2013-12-01InmateWalterEllisDeath.pdf State Prison Inmate Dies], doc.sd.gov; December 1, 2013; accessed April 21m 2015. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203010745/http://doc.sd.gov/documents/2013-12-01InmateWalterEllisDeath.pdf |date=December 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wawona Tree''', also known as the '''Wawona Tunnel Tree''', was a famous [[Sequoiadendron giganteum|giant sequoia]] that stood in [[Mariposa Grove]], [[Yosemite National Park]], California, USA, until February 1969. It had a height of {{convert|227|ft|m}} and was {{convert|26|ft|m}} in diameter at the base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/seki/faqtunnel.htm|title=Frequently Asked Questions, Tunnel Tree|work=Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Fallen Tunnel Tree.jpg|thumb|right|The fallen tree, October 2012]]

A tunnel was cut through the tree in 1881, enlarging an existing fire scar. Two men, the Scribner brothers, were paid $75 for the job ({{Inflation|US|75|1881|fmt=eq}}).  The tree had a slight lean, which increased when the tunnel was completed. Created by the Yosemite Stage and Turnpike Company as a tourist attraction, this human-made tunnel became immensely popular. Visitors were often photographed driving through or standing in the tunnel.

Construction of the Wawona Tree was part of an effort by the Park Service to increase tourism in the age of the automobile. [[Stephen Mather]], the first Director of the National Park Service, was a main supporter of building a tourist clientele for the parks, which would in turn attract increasing appropriations from Congress and establish the Park Service as a legitimate and noteworthy bureaucratic agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allin|first1=Craig W.|chapter=9: Wilderness Preservation as a Bureaucratic Tool|editor1-last=Foss|editor1-first=Phillip O.|title=Federal Lands Policy|date=1987|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=New York|pages=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mather and his chief aide, [[Horace Albright]], who would also be his successor, worked to make the parks as accessible as possible and, with drive-through attractions such as the Tunnel Tree, as memorable as possible. Mather and Albright had already worked on the "See America First" campaign, trying to connect with western railroads to increase visitation to the parks. In the 1920s, the Park Service actively promoted automobile tourism. Roads and roadside attractions bloomed on the sites of Yellowstone, the Grand Canyon, and Yosemite. Roads, they believed, would also increase accessibility for "those who are not as strong and agile as you and I, for they too are entitled to their inspiration and enjoyment," as Albright stated in a 1931 letter about roads in the Smokies. Around this time, the term 'scenic drive' became introduced into the national vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pierce|first1=Daniel S.|chapter=9: The Road to Nowhere Tourism Development versus Environmentalism in the Great Smoky Mountains|editor1-last=Starnes|editor1-first=Richard D.|title=Southern Journeys: Tourism, History, and Culture in the Modern South|date=2003|publisher=[[University of Alabama Press]]|location=Tuscaloosa, AL|pages=200–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Wawona Tree may also have served as the inspiration for the 1946 children's book, ''[[Big Tree (novel)|Big Tree]]'', by [[Mary and Conrad Buff]].

The Wawona Tree fell in February 1969&lt;ref name="nationalparkstraveler.com"/&gt; under a heavy load of snow on its crown.  The giant sequoia is estimated to have been 2,300 years old. When the giant tree fell, there was much debate over what to do with it. It has remained where it fell primarily for ecological reasons, but still serves as a popular tourist destination. Because of their size, giant sequoias can create vast new ecosystems when they fall, providing habitat for insects and animals and allowing new plant growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=When Giants Fall|journal=American Forests|date=Winter 2012|volume=117|issue=4|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now known as the '''Fallen Tunnel Tree'''.

Visitors to nearby [[Tunnel Log|Sequoia National Park]] sometimes confuse Yosemite's Fallen Tunnel Tree with Sequoia National Park's [[Tunnel Log]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Johnson |first=Terrell |date=Feb 19, 2013 |title=The World's 20 Most Amazing Tunnels |url =http://www.weather.com/travel/worlds-most-amazing-tunnels-20130213?pageno=6 |publisher=[[weather.com]] Travel |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usdf"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fsbdev3_058751.pdf |publisher=United States Forest Service |title=Where is the tree you can drive through? |accessdate=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NPS"&gt;{{cite web|title= The Myth of the Tree You Can Drive Through |website= [[National Park Service]] |accessdate= 2017-01-10 |url= https://www.nps.gov/seki/faqtunnel.htm |quote= [The Wawona Tree] was the second standing sequoia to be tunneled (the first, a dead tree, still stands in the Tuolumne Grove in Yosemite).}}&lt;/ref&gt; A modest notice of both the Wawona Tree and another tunnel tree appears in the May 28, 1899 issue of a ''[[Sacramento Daily Union]]'' article: "In the lower grove there is another tree through which the wagon road runs. It is named California and is twenty-one feet in diameter at the base and 248 feet in height."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leitch|first1=B.

==Other tunnel trees==
A number of big trees in California had tunnels dug through them in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The tunnel allowed tourists to drive, bike, or walk through the tree. The tunneling inflicted severe damage to the health and strength of the trees. The tunnels were cut to stimulate automobile tourism; the cutters did not know or care about the profound damage they were inflicting on the trees. Because of the damaging effects of carving through trees, the practice of creating tunnel trees has long passed.

===Giant sequoias===
The other giant sequoia drive-through tree has also fallen:

*[[Pioneer Cabin Tree]] fell in 2017 in [[Calaveras Big Trees State Park]]&lt;ref name="usdf"/&gt;

But two walk-through tunnel trees still stand:

*California Tunnel Tree in [[Mariposa Grove]], [[Yosemite National Park]]. The California Tunnel Tree's passageway was dug in 1895 to allow horse-drawn stagecoaches to pass through the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Hilton |first= Spud |title= Original essays: Why they love the parks |date= 2016-06-17 |newspaper= [[San Francisco Chronicle]] |accessdate= 2017-01-09 |url= http://www.sfchronicle.com/travel/article/Why-they-love-the-parks-8205530.php |quote= The iconic California Tunnel Tree, cut in 1895 to allow horse-drawn stages to pass through, at the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias in Yosemite National Park.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, people can walk or bike through it.
