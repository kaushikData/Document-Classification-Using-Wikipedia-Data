'''Adam Smith''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRSA}} ({{OldStyleDateNY|16 June|5 June}} 1723&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/smith_adam.shtml|title=Adam Smith (1723-1790)|website=BBC|quote=Adam Smith's exact date of birth is unknown, but he was baptised on 5 June 1723.}}&lt;/ref&gt; – 17 July 1790) was a Scottish [[economist]], [[philosopher]] and [[author]] as well as a [[Ethics|moral philosopher]], a pioneer of [[political economy]] and a key figure during the [[Scottish Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Great Thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/scottishhistory/enlightenment/features_enlightenment_enlightenment.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith is best known for two classic works, ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'' (1759) and ''[[The Wealth of Nations|An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776). The latter, often abbreviated as ''The Wealth of Nations'', is considered his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' and the first modern work of economics.

Smith studied [[social philosophy]] at the [[University of Glasgow]] and at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by fellow Scot [[John Snell]]. After graduating, he delivered a successful series of public lectures at [[Edinburgh]], leading him to collaborate with [[David Hume]] during the Scottish Enlightenment. Smith obtained a professorship at Glasgow, teaching moral philosophy and during this time, wrote and published ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments''. In his later life, he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout Europe, where he met other intellectual leaders of his day.

Smith laid the foundations of classical [[free market]] economic theory. ''The Wealth of Nations'' was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, he developed the concept of [[Division of labour#Adam Smith|division of labour]] and expounded upon how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] writers in the moralising tradition of [[William Hogarth]] and [[Jonathan Swift]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} In 2005, ''The Wealth of Nations'' was named among the 100 best Scottish books of all time.&lt;ref name="100 Best Scottish Books, Adam Smith"&gt;[http://www.list.co.uk/articles/100-best-scottish-books/adam-smith/ "100 Best Scottish Books, Adam Smith"]. Retrieved 31 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===

Smith was born in [[Kirkcaldy]], in the County of [[Fife]], Scotland. His father, also Adam Smith, was a Scottish [[Society of Writers to Her Majesty's Signet|Writer to the Signet]] (senior [[Solicitor#Scotland|solicitor]]), [[Advocate#Scotland|advocate]] and [[Prosecutor#Scotland|prosecutor]] (judge advocate) and also served as comptroller of the customs in Kirkcaldy.&lt;ref name="rae 1895 1"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1720, he married Margaret Douglas, daughter of the landed Robert Douglas of Strathendry, also in Fife. His father died two months after he was born, leaving his mother a widow.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The date of Smith's baptism into the [[Church of Scotland]] at Kirkcaldy was &lt;!-- 5 June is OS; 5 June is NS. --&gt;5 June 1723&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this has often been treated as if it were also his date of birth,&lt;ref name="rae 1895 1"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is unknown. Although few events in Smith's early childhood are known, the Scottish journalist [[John Rae (biographer)|John Rae]], Smith's biographer, recorded that Smith was abducted by gypsies at the age of three and released when others went to rescue him.{{efn|In ''Life of Adam Smith'', Rae writes: "In his fourth year, while on a visit to his grandfather's house at Strathendry on the banks of the Leven, [Smith] was stolen by a passing band of gypsies, and for a time could not be found. But presently a gentleman arrived who had met a gypsy woman a few miles down the road carrying a child that was crying piteously. Scouts were immediately dispatched in the direction indicated, and they came upon the woman in Leslie wood. As soon as she saw them she threw her burden down and escaped, and the child was brought back to his mother. [Smith] would have made, I fear, a poor gypsy."&lt;ref name="rae 1895 5" /&gt;}} Smith was close to his mother, who probably encouraged him to pursue his scholarly ambitions.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 39"&gt;{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Burgh School of Kirkcaldy]]—characterised by Rae as "one of the best secondary schools of Scotland at that period"&lt;ref name="rae 1895 5"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;—from 1729 to 1737, he learned [[Latin]], mathematics, history, and writing.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 39"/&gt;

===Formal education===

Smith entered the [[University of Glasgow]] when he was 14 and studied moral philosophy under [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]].&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 39"/&gt; Here, Smith developed his passion for [[liberty]], [[reason]], and [[free speech]]. In 1740, Smith was the graduate scholar presented to undertake postgraduate studies at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], under the [[Snell Exhibition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith considered the teaching at Glasgow to be far superior to that at Oxford, which he found intellectually stifling.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 41"&gt;{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Book V, Chapter II of ''The Wealth of Nations'', Smith wrote: "In the University of Oxford, the greater part of the public professors have, for these many years, given up altogether even the pretence of teaching."
Smith is also reported to have complained to friends that Oxford officials once discovered him reading a copy of [[David Hume]]'s ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'', and they subsequently confiscated his book and punished him severely for reading it.&lt;ref name="rae 1895 5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rae 1895 24"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buchholz 1999 12"&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to William Robert Scott, "The Oxford of [Smith's] time gave little if any help towards what was to be his lifework."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Introductory Economics |publisher=New Age Publishers |isbn=81-224-1830-9 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Smith took the opportunity while at Oxford to teach himself several subjects by reading many books from the shelves of the large [[Bodleian Library]].&lt;ref name="rae 1895 22"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Smith was not studying on his own, his time at Oxford was not a happy one, according to his letters.&lt;ref name="rae 1895 24–25"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of his time there, Smith began suffering from shaking fits, probably the symptoms of a nervous breakdown.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 42"&gt;{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left Oxford University in 1746, before his scholarship ended.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 42" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Book V of ''The Wealth of Nations'', Smith comments on the low quality of instruction and the meager intellectual activity at [[List of universities in England|English universities]], when compared to their Scottish counterparts. He attributes this both to the rich endowments of the colleges at Oxford and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], which made the income of professors independent of their ability to attract students, and to the fact that distinguished [[Intellectual#Man of Letters|men of letters]] could make an even more comfortable living as ministers of the [[Church of England]].&lt;ref name="Buchholz 1999 12" /&gt;

Smith's discontent at Oxford might be in part due to the absence of his beloved teacher in Glasgow, Francis Hutcheson, who was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the University of Glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students, colleagues, and even ordinary residents with the fervor and earnestness of his orations (which he sometimes opened to the public). His lectures endeavoured not merely to teach philosophy, but also to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives, appropriately acquiring the epithet, the preacher of philosophy. Unlike Smith, Hutcheson was not a system builder; rather, his magnetic personality and method of lecturing so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as "the never to be forgotten Hutcheson"—a title that Smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people, his good friend David Hume and influential mentor Francis Hutcheson.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, W.&amp;nbsp;R. "The Never to Be Forgotten Hutcheson: Excerpts from W.&amp;nbsp;R. Scott," ''Econ Journal Watch 8(1):'' 96–109, January 2011.[http://econjwatch.org/articles/the-never-to-be-forgotten-hutcheson-excerpts-from-wr-scott]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adam Smith's mother.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|Portrait of Smith's mother, Margaret Douglas]]
===Teaching career===
Smith began delivering public lectures in 1748 in Edinburgh, sponsored by the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh under the patronage of [[Henry Home, Lord Kames|Lord Kames]].&lt;ref name="rae 1895 30"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; His lecture topics included [[rhetoric]] and ''[[belles-lettres]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A. ([1762] 1985). ''Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres'' [1762]. vol. IV of the Glasgow Edition of the ''Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'' (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 1984). Retrieved 16 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and later the subject of "the progress of opulence". On this latter topic, he first expounded his economic philosophy of "the obvious and simple system of [[Natural and legal rights|natural liberty]]". While Smith was not adept at [[public speaking]], his lectures met with success.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 43"&gt;{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1750, Smith met the philosopher David Hume, who was his senior by more than a decade. In their writings covering history, politics, philosophy, economics, and religion, Smith and Hume shared closer intellectual and personal bonds than with other important figures of the Scottish Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Smith, Adam (bap. 1723, d. 1790) |encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of National Biography]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=September 2004 |author=Winch, Donald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1751, Smith earned a professorship at Glasgow University teaching [[logic]] courses, and in 1752, he was elected a member of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh, having been introduced to the society by Lord Kames. When the [[Professor of Moral Philosophy (Glasgow)|head of Moral Philosophy in Glasgow]] died the next year, Smith took over the position.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 43" /&gt; He worked as an academic for the next 13 years, which he characterised as "by far the most useful and therefore by far the happiest and most honorable period [of his life]".&lt;ref name="rae 1895 42"&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith published ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'' in 1759, embodying some of his Glasgow lectures. This work was concerned with how human morality depends on sympathy between agent and spectator, or the individual and other members of society. Smith defined "mutual sympathy" as the basis of [[Moral sense theory|moral sentiments]]. He based his explanation, not on a special "moral sense" as the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Third Lord Shaftesbury]] and Hutcheson had done, nor on [[utilitarianism|utility]] as Hume did, but on mutual sympathy, a term best captured in modern parlance by the 20th-century concept of [[empathy]], the capacity to recognise feelings that are being experienced by another being.

[[File:François Quesnay.jpg|thumb|upright|[[François Quesnay]], one of the leaders of the [[Physiocracy|physiocratic]] school of thought|alt=A drawing of a man sitting down]]
Following the publication of ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', Smith became so popular that many wealthy students left their schools in other countries to enroll at Glasgow to learn under Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the publication of ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', Smith began to give more attention to [[jurisprudence]] and economics in his lectures and less to his theories of morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Smith lectured that the cause of increase in national wealth is labour, rather than the nation's quantity of gold or silver, which is the basis for [[mercantilism]], the [[economic theory]] that dominated Western European economic policies at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1762, the University of Glasgow conferred on Smith the title of [[Doctor of Law]]s (LL.D.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/archives/exhibitions/smith/photogallery/honorarydegree/|title=MyGlasgow - Archive Services - Exhibitions - Adam Smith in Glasgow - Photo Gallery - Honorary degree|website=University of Glasgow|accessdate=November 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1763, he obtained an offer from [[Charles Townshend]]—who had been introduced to Smith by David Hume—to tutor his stepson, [[Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch|Henry Scott]], the young Duke of Buccleuch. Smith resigned from his professorship in 1764 to take the tutoring position. He subsequently attempted to return the fees he had collected from his students because he had resigned partway through the term, but his students refused.&lt;ref name="Buchholz 1999 16"&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tutoring and travels===
Smith's tutoring job entailed touring Europe with Scott, during which time he educated Scott on a variety of subjects, such as etiquette and manners. He was paid [[Pound sterling|£]]300 per year (plus expenses) along with a £300 per year pension; roughly twice his former income as a teacher.&lt;ref name="Buchholz 1999 16" /&gt; Smith first travelled as a tutor to [[Toulouse]], France, where he stayed for a year and a half. According to his own account, he found Toulouse to be somewhat boring, having written to Hume that he "had begun to write a book to pass away the time".&lt;ref name="Buchholz 1999 16" /&gt; After touring the south of France, the group moved to [[Geneva]], where Smith met with the philosopher [[Voltaire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Allan Ramsay - David Hume, 1711 - 1776. Historian and philosopher - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|[[David Hume]] was a friend and contemporary of Smith's.|alt=A man posing for a painting]]
From Geneva, the party moved to Paris. Here, Smith met [[Benjamin Franklin]], and discovered the [[Physiocracy]] school founded by [[François Quesnay]].&lt;ref name="Buchholz 17"&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physiocrats were opposed to [[mercantilism]], the dominating economic theory of the time, illustrated in their motto ''[[Laissez-faire|Laissez faire et laissez passer, le monde va de lui même!]]'' (Let do and let pass, the world goes on by itself!).

The wealth of France had been virtually depleted by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis&amp;nbsp;XIV]]{{efn|During the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis&amp;nbsp;XIV]], the population shrunk by 4 million and agricultural productivity was reduced by one-third while the taxes had increased. Cusminsky, Rosa, de Cendrero, 1967, ''Los Fisiócratas'', Buenos Aires: Centro Editor de América Latina, p. 6}} and [[Louis XV of France|Louis&amp;nbsp;XV]] in ruinous wars,{{efn|1701–1714 War of the Spanish Succession, 1688–1697 War of the Grand Alliance, 1672–1678 Franco-Dutch War, 1667–1668 War of Devolution, 1618–1648 Thirty Years' War}} and was further exhausted in aiding the [[American Revolution|American insurgents]] against the British. The excessive consumption of goods and services deemed to have no economic contribution was considered a source of unproductive labour, with France's agriculture the only economic sector maintaining the wealth of the nation.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Given that the English economy of the day yielded an income distribution that stood in contrast to that which existed in France, Smith concluded that "with all its imperfections, [the Physiocratic school] is perhaps the nearest approximation to the truth that has yet been published upon the subject of political economy."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Wealth of Nations'' edited by R.&amp;nbsp;H. Campbell and A.&amp;nbsp;S. Skinner, The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith, vol. 2b, p. 678.&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between productive versus unproductive labour—the physiocratic ''classe steril''—was a predominant issue in the development and understanding of what would become classical economic theory.

===Later years===
In 1766, Henry Scott's younger brother died in Paris, and Smith's tour as a tutor ended shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith returned home that year to Kirkcaldy, and he devoted much of the next decade to writing his ''magnum opus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, he befriended [[Henry Moyes]], a young blind man who showed precocious aptitude.  Smith secured the patronage of David Hume and [[Thomas Reid]] in the young man's education.&lt;ref&gt;''Dr [[James Currie (physician)|James Currie]] to [[Thomas Creevey]]'', 24 February 1793, Lpool RO, Currie MS 920 CUR&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1773, Smith was elected fellow of the [[Royal Society of London]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was elected a member of the [[The Club (dining club)|Literary Club]] in 1775. ''The Wealth of Nations'' was published in 1776 and was an instant success, selling out its first edition in only six months.&lt;ref name="Buchholz 19"&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1778, Smith was appointed to a post as commissioner of customs in Scotland and went to live with his mother (who died in 1784)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Durant|first1=Will|last2=Durant|first2=Ariel|title=The Story of Civilization: Rousseau and Revolution|date=1 July 1967|publisher=MJF Books|ISBN=1567310214}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Panmure House (Edinburgh)|Panmure House]] in Edinburgh's [[Canongate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, as a member of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh when it received its royal charter, he automatically became one of the founding members of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1787 to 1789, he occupied the honorary position of Lord [[Rector of the University of Glasgow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===

Smith died in the northern wing of Panmure House in Edinburgh on 17 July 1790 after a painful illness. His body was buried in the [[Canongate Kirkyard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his deathbed, Smith expressed disappointment that he had not achieved more.&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 53"&gt;{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith's literary executors were two friends from the Scottish academic world: the physicist and chemist [[Joseph Black]] and the pioneering geologist [[James Hutton]].&lt;ref name="buchan 2006 25"&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith left behind many notes and some unpublished material, but gave instructions to destroy anything that was not fit for publication.&lt;ref name="buchan 2006 88"&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; He mentioned an early unpublished ''History of Astronomy'' as probably suitable, and it duly appeared in 1795, along with other material such as ''[[Essays on Philosophical Subjects]]''.&lt;ref name="buchan 2006 25"/&gt;

Smith's library went by his will to [[David Douglas, Lord Reston]] (son of his cousin Colonel Robert Douglas of Strathendry, Fife), who lived with Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |chapter= Adam Smith's Will |title=A Catalogue of the Library of Adam Smith |editor=Bonar, James |editor-link= James Bonar (civil servant) |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |year=1894 |pages= XIV |oclc=2320634 |url=https://archive.org/stream/catalogueoflibr00smit#page/n19/mode/2up |ref=harv |via=Internet Archive}|accessdate= 13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was eventually divided between his two surviving children, Cecilia Margaret (Mrs.&amp;nbsp;Cunningham) and David Anne (Mrs.&amp;nbsp;Bannerman). On the death of her husband, the Reverend W.&amp;nbsp;B. Cunningham of Prestonpans in 1878, Mrs.&amp;nbsp;Cunningham sold some of the books. The remainder passed to her son, Professor [[Robert Oliver Cunningham]] of Queen's College, Belfast, who presented a part to the library of Queen's College. After his death, the remaining books were sold. On the death of Mrs. Bannerman in 1879, her portion of the library went intact to the New College (of the Free Church) in Edinburgh and the collection was transferred to the University of Edinburgh Main Library in 1972.

==Personality and beliefs==

===Character===
[[File:Smith medallion portrait.jpg|upright|thumb|[[James Tassie]]'s enamel paste medallion of Smith provided the model for many engravings and portraits that remain today.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bonar|1895|pp=xx–xxiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=An enamel paste medallion, depicting a man's head facing the right]]

Not much is known about Smith's personal views beyond what can be deduced from his published articles. His personal papers were destroyed after his death at his request.&lt;ref name="buchan 2006 88" /&gt; He never married,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and seems to have maintained a close relationship with his mother, with whom he lived after his return from France and who died six years before him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith was described by several of his contemporaries and biographers as comically absent-minded, with peculiar habits of speech and gait, and a smile of "inexpressible benignity".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was known to talk to himself,&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 53" /&gt; a habit that began during his childhood when he would smile in rapt conversation with invisible companions.&lt;ref name="skousen 2001 32"&gt;{{harvnb|Skousen|2001|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had occasional spells of imaginary illness,&lt;ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 53" /&gt; and he is reported to have had books and papers placed in tall stacks in his study.&lt;ref name="skousen 2001 32" /&gt; According to one story, Smith took Charles Townshend on a tour of a [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] factory, and while discussing [[free trade]], Smith walked into a huge [[Tanning (leather)|tanning pit]] from which he needed help to escape.&lt;ref name="Buchholz 14"&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also said to have put bread and butter into a teapot, drunk the concoction, and declared it to be the worst cup of tea he ever had. According to another account, Smith distractedly went out walking in his nightgown and ended up {{convert|15|mi|km}} outside of town, before nearby church bells brought him back to reality.&lt;ref name="skousen 2001 32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Buchholz 14" /&gt;

[[James Boswell]], who was a student of Smith's at Glasgow University, and later knew him at the [[The Club (Literary Club)|Literary Club]], says that Smith thought that speaking about his ideas in conversation might reduce the sale of his books, so his conversation was unimpressive. According to Boswell, he once told [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]], that 'he made it a rule when in company never to talk of what he understood'.&lt;ref&gt;Boswell's '[[Life of Samuel Johnson]]'', 1780.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AdamSmith1790b.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Smith by [[John Kay (caricaturist)|John Kay]], 1790|alt=A drawing of a man standing up, with one hand holding a cane and the other pointing at a book]]

Smith has been alternately described as someone who "had a large nose, bulging eyes, a protruding lower lip, a nervous twitch, and a speech impediment" and one whose "countenance was manly and agreeable."&lt;ref name="Buchholz 1999 12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ross|2010|p=330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith is said to have acknowledged his looks at one point, saying, "I am a beau in nothing but my books."&lt;ref name="Buchholz 1999 12" /&gt; Smith rarely sat for portraits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stewart |first=Dugald |title=The Works of Adam Smith: With An Account of His Life and Writings |publisher=Henry G. Bohn |location=London |year=1853 |page=lxix |oclc=3226570 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FbYCAAAAYAAJ |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; so almost all depictions of him created during his lifetime were drawn from memory. The best-known portraits of Smith are the profile by [[James Tassie]] and two [[etching]]s by [[John Kay (caricaturist)|John Kay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|pp=376–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line engravings produced for the covers of 19th-century reprints of ''The Wealth of Nations'' were based largely on Tassie's medallion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bonar|1895|p=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious views===
Considerable scholarly debate has occurred about the nature of Smith's religious views. Smith's father had shown a strong interest in Christianity and belonged to the moderate wing of the [[Church of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ross|1995|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Adam Smith received the Snell Exhibition suggests that he may have gone to Oxford with the intention of pursuing a career in the [[Church of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Times obituary of Adam Smith|journal=[[The Times]]|date=24 July 1790|pages=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Times/1790/Obituary/Adam_Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anglo-American economist [[Ronald Coase]] has challenged the view that Smith was a deist, based on the fact that Smith's writings never explicitly invoke God as an explanation of the harmonies of the natural or the human worlds.&lt;ref name="Coase"&gt;{{harvnb|Coase|1976|pp=529–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Coase, though Smith does sometimes refer to the "[[Great Architect of the Universe]]", later scholars such as [[Jacob Viner]] have "very much exaggerated the extent to which Adam Smith was committed to a belief in a personal God",&lt;ref name="Coase-God"&gt;{{harvnb|Coase|1976|p=538}}&lt;/ref&gt; a belief for which Coase finds little evidence in passages such as the one in the ''Wealth of Nations'' in which Smith writes that the curiosity of mankind about the "great phenomena of nature", such as "the generation, the life, growth, and dissolution of plants and animals", has led men to "enquire into their causes", and that "superstition first attempted to satisfy this curiosity, by referring all those wonderful appearances to the immediate agency of the gods. Philosophy afterwards endeavoured to account for them, from more familiar causes, or from such as mankind were better acquainted with than the agency of the gods".&lt;ref name="Coase-God" /&gt;

Some other authors argue that Smith's social and economic philosophy is inherently theological and that his entire model of social order is logically dependent on the notion of God's action in nature.&lt;ref name="hidden theology"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Hill |first1=L. |doi=10.1080/713765225 |title=The hidden theology of Adam Smith |journal=The European Journal of the History of Economic Thought |volume=8 |pages=1–29 |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith was also a close friend and later the executor of David Hume, who was commonly characterised in his own time as an [[atheist]].&lt;ref name="hume on religion"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-religion/ |title=Hume on Religion |publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |accessdate=26 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication in 1777 of Smith's letter to [[William Strahan (publisher)|William Strahan]], in which he described Hume's courage in the face of death in spite of his irreligiosity, attracted considerable controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Eric Schliesser |year=2003 |journal=Hume Studies |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=327–62 |title=The Obituary of a Vain Philosopher: Adam Smith's Reflections on Hume's Life |url=http://www.humesociety.org/hs/issues/v29n2/schliesser/schliesser-v29n2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published works==

===''The Theory of Moral Sentiments''===
{{Main article|The Theory of Moral Sentiments}}
In 1759, Smith published his first work, ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments,'' sold by co-publishers [[Andrew Millar]] of London and Alexander Kincaid of Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.millar-project.ed.ac.uk/|title=Andrew Millar Project, University of Edinburgh|website=millar-project.ed.ac.uk|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith continued making extensive revisions to the book until his death.{{efn|The 6 editions of ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' were published in 1759, 1761, 1767, 1774, 1781, and 1790, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Adam Smith, Glasgow Edition of the Works and Correspondence Vol. 1 The Theory of Moral Sentiments [1759]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Although ''The Wealth of Nations'' is widely regarded as Smith's most influential work, Smith himself  is believed to have considered ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' to be a superior work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the work, Smith critically examines the moral thinking of his time, and suggests that conscience arises from dynamic and interactive social relationships through which people seek "mutual sympathy of sentiments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/item_single.php?item_id=37&amp;item=biography |title=Biography of Smith |accessdate=14 May 2008 |publisher=[[Liberal Democrat History Group]] |year=1997 |author=Falkner, Robert |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611110312/http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/item_single.php?item_id=37&amp;item=biography |archivedate=11 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His goal in writing the work was to explain the source of mankind's ability to form moral judgement, given that people begin life with no moral sentiments at all. Smith proposes a theory of sympathy, in which the act of observing others and seeing the judgements they form of both others and oneself makes people aware of themselves and how others perceive their behaviour. The feedback we receive from perceiving (or imagining) others' judgements creates an incentive to achieve "mutual sympathy of sentiments" with them and leads people to develop habits, and then principles, of behaviour, which come to constitute one's conscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2002|p=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have perceived a conflict between ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' and ''The Wealth of Nations''; the former emphasises sympathy for others, while the latter focuses on the role of self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Viner|1991|p=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, however, some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Wight, Jonathan B. ''Saving Adam Smith''. Upper Saddle River: Prentic-Hall, Inc., 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Lionel. ''A History of Economic Thought''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brue, Stanley L., and Randy R. Grant. ''The Evolution of Economic Thought''. Mason: Thomson Higher Education, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; of Smith's work have argued that no contradiction exists. They claim that in ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', Smith develops a theory of psychology in which individuals seek the approval of the "impartial spectator" as a result of a natural desire to have outside observers sympathise with their sentiments. Rather than viewing ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' and ''The Wealth of Nations'' as presenting incompatible views of human nature, some Smith scholars regard the works as emphasising different aspects of human nature that vary depending on the situation. [[James Otteson|Otteson]] argues that both books are Newtonian in their methodology and deploy a similar "market model" for explaining the creation and development of large-scale human social orders, including morality, economics, as well as language.&lt;ref&gt;Otteson, James R. 2002, ''Adam Smith's Marketplace of Life''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Ekelund|Ekelund]] and Hebert offer a differing view, observing that self-interest is present in both works and that "in the former, sympathy is the moral faculty that holds self-interest in check, whereas in the latter, competition is the economic faculty that restrains self-interest."&lt;ref&gt;Ekelund, R. &amp; Hebert, R. 2007, ''A History of Economic Theory and Method'' 5th Edition. Waveland Press, United States, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Wealth of Nations''===
{{Main article|The Wealth of Nations}}

Disagreement exists between classical and neoclassical economists about the central message of Smith's most influential work: ''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations'' (1776). Neoclassical economists emphasise Smith's [[invisible hand]],&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Wealth of Nations'' edited by R.&amp;nbsp;H. Campbell and A.&amp;nbsp;S. Skinner, ''The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'', vol. 2a, p. 456.&lt;/ref&gt; a concept mentioned in the middle of his work – Book&amp;nbsp;IV, Chapter&amp;nbsp;II – and classical economists believe that Smith stated his programme for promoting the "wealth of nations" in the first sentences, which attributes the growth of wealth and prosperity to the division of labour.

Smith used the term "[[invisible hand|the invisible hand]]" in "History of Astronomy"&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1980, ''The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'', vol. 3, p. 49, edited by W.&amp;nbsp;P.&amp;nbsp;D. Wightman and J.&amp;nbsp;C. Bryce, Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; referring to "the invisible hand of Jupiter", and once in each of his ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]''&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'', vol. 1, pp. 184–85, edited by D.&amp;nbsp;D. Raphael and A.&amp;nbsp;L. Macfie, Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (1759) and [[The Wealth of Nations]]&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'', vol. 2a, p. 456, edited by R.&amp;nbsp;H. Cambell and A.&amp;nbsp;S. Skinner, Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (1776). This last statement about "an invisible hand" has been interpreted in numerous ways.

[[File:19th-century building at location where Adam Smith lived, 1767-1776.jpg|thumb|[[Adam Smith House|Later building on the site]] where Smith wrote ''The Wealth of Nations''|alt=A brown building]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Those who regard that statement as Smith's central message also quote frequently Smith's dictum:&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Wealth of Nations.jpg|thumb|upright|The first page of ''The Wealth of Nations'', 1776 London edition|alt=The first page of a book]]
Smith's statement about the benefits of "an invisible hand" may be meant to answer{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} [[Bernard Mandeville|Mandeville's]] contention that "Private Vices ... may be turned into Public Benefits".&lt;ref&gt;Mandeville, B., 1724, ''The Fable of the Bees'', London: Tonson.&lt;/ref&gt; It shows Smith's belief that when an individual pursues his self-interest under conditions of justice, he unintentionally promotes the good of society. Self-interested competition in the free market, he argued, would tend to benefit society as a whole by keeping prices low, while still building in an incentive for a wide variety of goods and services. Nevertheless, he was wary of businessmen and warned of their "conspiracy against the public or in some other contrivance to raise prices".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, pp. 145, 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Again and again, Smith warned of the collusive nature of business interests, which may form cabals or [[Monopoly|monopolies]], fixing the highest price "which can be squeezed out of the buyers".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith also warned that a business-dominated political system would allow a conspiracy of businesses and industry against consumers, with the former scheming to influence politics and legislation. Smith states that the interest of manufacturers and merchants "in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public ... The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gopnik |first=Adam |title=Market Man |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |issue=18 October 2010 |page=82 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/18/101018crbo_books_gopnik |accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Smith's chief worry seems to be when business is given special protections or privileges from government; by contrast, in the absence of such special political favours, he believed that business activities were generally beneficial to the whole society:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the great multiplication of the production of all the different arts, in consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people. Every workman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of beyond what he himself has occasion for; and every other workman being exactly in the same situation, he is enabled to exchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity, or, what comes to the same thing, for the price of a great quantity of theirs. He supplies them abundantly with what they have occasion for, and they accommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for, and a general plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of society. (''The Wealth of Nations,'' I.i.10)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The neoclassical interest in Smith's statement about "an invisible hand" originates in the possibility of seeing it as a precursor of [[neoclassical economics]] and its concept of [[General equilibrium theory|general equilibrium]] – [[Paul Samuelson|Samuelson's]] "Economics" refers six times to Smith's "invisible hand". To emphasise this connection, Samuelson&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson, P.&amp;nbsp;A./Nordhaus, William&amp;nbsp;D., 1989, ''Economics'', 13th edition, N.Y. et al.: McGraw-Hill, p. 825.&lt;/ref&gt; quotes Smith's "invisible hand" statement substituting "general interest" for "public interest". Samuelson&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson, P.&amp;nbsp;A./Nordhaus, William&amp;nbsp;D., 1989, idem, p. 825.&lt;/ref&gt; concludes: "Smith was unable to prove the essence of his invisible-hand doctrine. Indeed, until the 1940s, no one knew how to prove, even to state properly, the kernel of truth in this proposition about perfectly competitive market."

[[File:Smith - Inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations, 1922 - 5231847.tif|thumb|170px|1922 printing of ''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations'']]
Very differently, classical economists see in Smith's first sentences his programme to promote "The Wealth of Nations". Using the physiocratical concept of the economy as a circular process, to secure growth the inputs of Period 2 must exceed the inputs of Period 1. Therefore, those outputs of Period 1 which are not used or usable as inputs of Period 2 are regarded as unproductive labour, as they do not contribute to growth. This is what Smith had heard in France from, among others, [[François Quesnay]], whose ideas Smith was so impressed by that he might have dedicated ''The Wealth of Nations'' to him had he not died beforehand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, D., 1799, ''Essays on Philosophical Subjects, to which is prefixed An Account of the Life and Writings of the Author by Dugald Steward, F.R.S.E.'', Basil; from the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Read by M. Steward, 21 January, and 18 March 1793; in: The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith, 1982, vol. 3, pp. 304 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; To this French insight that unproductive labour should be reduced to use labour more productively, Smith added his own proposal, that productive labour should be made even more productive by deepening the [[division of labour]]. Smith argued that deepening the division of labour under competition leads to greater productivity, which leads to lower prices and thus an increasing standard of living—"general plenty" and "universal opulence"—for all. Extended markets and increased production lead to the continuous reorganisation of production and the invention of new ways of producing, which in turn lead to further increased production, lower prices, and improved standards of living. Smith's central message is, therefore, that under dynamic competition, a growth machine secures "The Wealth of Nations". Smith's argument predicted Britain's evolution as the workshop of the world, underselling and outproducing all its competitors. The opening sentences of the "Wealth of Nations" summarise this policy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually consumes ... . [T]his produce ... bears a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume it ... .[B]ut this proportion must in every nation be regulated by two different circumstances;
* first, by the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which its labour is generally applied; and,
* secondly, by the proportion between the number of those who are employed in useful labour, and that of those who are not so employed [emphasis added].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, vol. 2a, p. 10, idem&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Smith added that the "abundance or scantiness of this supply too seems to depend more upon the former of those two circumstances than upon the latter."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, vol. 1, p. 10, para. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism and dissent===
[[Alfred Marshall]] criticised Smith's definition of the economy on several points. He argued that man should be equally important as money, services are as important as goods, and that there must be an emphasis on human welfare, instead of just wealth. The "invisible hand" only works well when both production and consumption operates in free markets, with small ("atomistic") producers and consumers allowing supply and demand to fluctuate and equilibrate. In conditions of monopoly and oligopoly, the "invisible hand" fails. Nobel Prize-winning economist [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] says, on the topic of one of Smith's better-known ideas: "the reason that the [[invisible hand]] often seems invisible is that it is often not there."&lt;ref&gt;''The Roaring Nineties'', 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other works===
[[File:Adam Smith Grave.JPG|thumb|upright|Smith's burial place in [[Canongate Kirkyard]]|alt=A burial]]

Shortly before his death, Smith had nearly all his manuscripts destroyed. In his last years, he seemed to have been planning two major treatises, one on the theory and history of law and one on the sciences and arts. The posthumously published ''Essays on Philosophical Subjects'', a history of [[astronomy]] down to Smith's own era, plus some thoughts on [[ancient physics]] and [[metaphysics]], probably contain parts of what would have been the latter treatise. ''[[Lectures on Jurisprudence]]'' were notes taken from Smith's early lectures, plus an early draft of ''The Wealth of Nations'', published as part of the 1976 Glasgow Edition of the works and correspondence of Smith. Other works, including some published posthumously, include ''Lectures on Justice, Police, Revenue, and Arms'' (1763) (first published in 1896); and ''Essays on Philosophical Subjects'' (1795).&lt;ref&gt;''The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'', 1982, 6 volumes&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

===In economics and moral philosophy===
''The Wealth of Nations'' was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, Smith expounded how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] writers in the moralising tradition of Hogarth and Swift, as a discussion at the University of Winchester suggests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=11 February 2010 |url=http://journalism.winchester.ac.uk/?page=343 |title=Adam Smith – Jonathan Swift |publisher=University of Winchester |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128233435/http://journalism.winchester.ac.uk/?page=343 |archivedate=28 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, ''The Wealth of Nations'' was named among the 100 Best Scottish Books of all time.&lt;ref name="100 Best Scottish Books, Adam Smith" /&gt; 

In light of the arguments put forward by Smith and other economic theorists in Britain, academic belief in mercantilism began to decline in Britain in the late 18th century. During the [[Industrial Revolution]], Britain embraced free trade and Smith's ''laissez-faire'' economics, and via the [[British Empire]], used its power to spread a broadly liberal economic model around the world, characterised by open markets, and relatively barrier-free domestic and international trade.&lt;ref&gt;L.Seabrooke (2006). "Global Standards of Market Civilization". p. 192. Taylor &amp; Francis 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Stigler]] attributes to Smith "the most important substantive proposition in all of economics". It is that, under competition, owners of resources (for example labour, land, and capital) will use them most profitably, resulting in an equal rate of return in [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] for all uses, adjusted for apparent differences arising from such factors as training, trust, hardship, and unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler, George&amp;nbsp;J. (1976). "The Successes and Failures of Professor Smith," ''Journal of Political Economy'', 84(6), [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1831274 pp. 1199]–213, 1202.

[[Paul Samuelson]] finds in Smith's pluralist use of supply and demand as applied to wages, rents, and profit a valid and valuable anticipation of the [[general equilibrium]] modelling of [[Walras]] a century later. Smith's allowance for wage increases in the short and intermediate term from capital accumulation and invention contrasted with [[Thomas Robert Malthus|Malthus]], [[David Ricardo|Ricardo]], and [[Karl Marx]] in their propounding a rigid subsistence–wage theory of labour supply.&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson, Paul A. (1977). "A Modern Theorist's Vindication of Adam Smith," ''American Economic Review'', 67(1), [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1815879 p. 42.] Reprinted in J.C. Wood, ed., ''Adam Smith: Critical Assessments'', pp. 498–509. [https://books.google.com/books?id=B8FY8mo5zX4C&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PA498=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Schumpeter]] criticised Smith for a lack of technical rigour, yet he argued that this enabled Smith's writings to appeal to wider audiences: "His very limitation made for success. Had he been more brilliant, he would not have been taken so seriously. Had he dug more deeply, had he unearthed more recondite truth, had he used more difficult and ingenious methods, he would not have been understood. But he had no such ambitions; in fact he disliked whatever went beyond plain common sense. He never moved above the heads of even the dullest readers. He led them on gently, encouraging them by trivialities and homely observations, making them feel comfortable all along."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Schumpeter History of Economic Analysis |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical economists presented competing theories of those of Smith, termed the "[[labour theory of value#The theory's development|labour theory of value]]". Later Marxian economics descending from classical economics also use Smith's labour theories, in part. The first volume of [[Karl Marx]]'s major work, ''Das Kapital'', was published in German in 1867. In it, Marx focused on the labour theory of value and what he considered to be the exploitation of labour by capital.&lt;ref name="Roemer"&gt;[[John Roemer|Roemer, J.E.]] (1987). "Marxian Value Analysis". ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 3, 383.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Mandel|Mandel, Ernest]] (1987). "Marx, Karl Heinrich", ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'' v. 3, pp. 372, 376.&lt;/ref&gt; The labour theory of value held that the value of a thing was determined by the labour that went into its production. This contrasts with the modern contention of [[neoclassical economics]], that the value of a thing is determined by what one is willing to give up to obtain the thing.

The body of theory later termed "neoclassical economics" or "[[marginalism#The Marginal Revolution|marginalism]]" formed from about 1870 to 1910. The term "economics" was popularised by such neoclassical economists as [[Alfred Marshall]] as a concise synonym for "economic science" and a substitute for the earlier, broader term "[[political economy]]" used by Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Marshall, Alfred |author2=Marshall, Mary Paley |year=1879 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NLcJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#PPA2,M1 |title=The Economics of Industry |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jevons, W. Stanley |year=1879 |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aYcBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR3#PPR3,M1 |title=The Theory of Political Economy |page=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This corresponded to the influence on the subject of mathematical methods used in the [[natural science]]s.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Clark, B. (1998). ''Political-economy: A comparative approach'', 2nd ed., Westport, CT: Praeger. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Neoclassical economics systematised [[supply and demand]] as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium, affecting both the allocation of output and the distribution of income. It dispensed with the [[labour theory of value]] of which Smith was most famously identified with in classical economics, in favour of a [[marginal utility]] theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side.&lt;ref&gt;Campos, Antonietta (1987). "Marginalist Economics", ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 3, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;

The bicentennial anniversary of the publication of ''The Wealth of Nations'' was celebrated in 1976, resulting in increased interest for ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' and his other works throughout academia. After 1976, Smith was more likely to be represented as the author of both ''The Wealth of Nations'' and ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', and thereby as the founder of a moral philosophy and the science of economics. His ''[[homo economicus]]'' or "economic man" was also more often represented as a moral person. Additionally, economists David Levy and Sandra Peart in "The Secret History of the Dismal Science" point to his opposition to hierarchy and beliefs in inequality, including racial inequality, and provide additional support for those who point to Smith's opposition to slavery, colonialism, and empire. They show the caricatures of Smith drawn by the opponents of views on hierarchy and inequality in this online article. Emphasised also are Smith's statements of the need for high wages for the poor, and the efforts to keep wages low. In The "Vanity of the Philosopher: From Equality to Hierarchy in Postclassical Economics", Peart and Levy also cite Smith's view that a common street porter was not intellectually inferior to a philosopher,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=§Book I, Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and point to the need for greater appreciation of the public views in discussions of science and other subjects now considered to be technical. They also cite Smith's opposition to the often expressed view that science is superior to common sense.&lt;ref&gt;"The Vanity of the Philosopher: From Equality to Hierarchy" in ''Postclassical Economics'' [http://www.wfu.edu/~hammond/review%20of%20Peart&amp;Levy,%20final.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith also explained the relationship between growth of private property and civil government:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Men may live together in society with some tolerable degree of security, though there is no civil magistrate to protect them from the injustice of those passions. But avarice and ambition in the rich, in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of present ease and enjoyment, are the passions which prompt to invade property, passions much more steady in their operation, and much more universal in their influence. Wherever there is great property there is great inequality. For one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many. The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his possessions. It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property, which is acquired by the labour of many years, or perhaps of many successive generations, can sleep a single night in security. He is at all times surrounded by unknown enemies, whom, though he never provoked, he can never appease, and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it. The acquisition of valuable and extensive property, therefore, necessarily requires the establishment of civil government. Where there is no property, or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days' labour, civil government is not so necessary. Civil government supposes a certain subordination. But as the necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property, so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property. (...) Men of inferior wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of their property, in order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the possession of theirs. All the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel that the security of their own herds and flocks depends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman; that the maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority, and that upon their subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in subordination to them. They constitute a sort of little nobility, who feel themselves interested to defend the property and to support the authority of their own little sovereign in order that he may be able to defend their property and to support their authority. Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all. (Source: ''The Wealth of Nations'', Book 5, Chapter 1, Part 2)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===In British Imperial debates===
Smith's chapter on colonies, in turn, would help shape British imperial debates from the mid-19th century onward. ''The Wealth of Nations'' would become an ambiguous text regarding the imperial question. In his chapter on colonies, Smith pondered how to solve the crisis developing across the Atlantic among the empire's 13 American colonies. He offered two different proposals for easing tensions. The first proposal called for giving the colonies their independence, and by thus parting on a friendly basis, Britain would be able to develop and maintain a free-trade relationship with them, and possibly even an informal military alliance. Smith's second proposal called for a theoretical imperial federation that would bring the colonies and the metropole closer together through an imperial parliamentary system and imperial free trade.&lt;ref&gt;E. A. Benians, ‘Adam Smith’s project of an empire’, ''Cambridge Historical Journal'' 1 (1925): 249–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith's most prominent disciple in 19th-century Britain, peace advocate [[Richard Cobden]], preferred the first proposal. Cobden would lead the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] in overturning the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846, shifting Britain to a policy of free trade and empire "on the cheap" for decades to come. This hands-off approach toward the British Empire would become known as [[Cobdenism]] or the [[Manchester Liberalism|Manchester School]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Howe, ''Free trade and liberal England, 1846–1946'' (Oxford, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; By the turn of the century, however, advocates of Smith's second proposal such as [[Joseph Shield Nicholson]] would become ever more vocal in opposing Cobdenism, calling instead for imperial federation.&lt;ref&gt;J. Shield Nicholson, ''A project of empire: a critical study of the economics of imperialism, with special reference to the ideas of Adam Smith'' (London, 1909)&lt;/ref&gt; As Marc-William Palen notes: "On the one hand, Adam Smith’s late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Cobdenite adherents used his theories to argue for gradual imperial devolution and empire ‘on the cheap’. On the other, various proponents of imperial federation throughout the British World sought to use Smith’s theories to overturn the predominant Cobdenite hands-off imperial approach and instead, with a firm grip, bring the empire closer than ever before."&lt;ref&gt;Marc-William Palen, [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9159669&amp;fileId=S0018246X13000101 “Adam Smith as Advocate of Empire, c. 1870–1932,”] ''Historical Journal'' 57: 1 (March 2014): 179–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's ideas thus played an important part in subsequent debates over the British Empire.

===Portraits, monuments, and banknotes===

Smith has been commemorated in the UK on banknotes printed by two different banks; his portrait has appeared since 1981 on the [[Pound sterling|£]]50 notes issued by the [[Clydesdale Bank]] in Scotland,&lt;ref name="clydesdale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aes.iupui.edu/rwise/banknotes/scotland/ScotlandP209-50Pounds-1981-donatedowl_f.jpg |title=Clydesdale 50 Pounds, 1981 |publisher=Ron Wise's Banknoteworld |accessdate=15 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030185820/http://aes.iupui.edu/rwise/banknotes/scotland/ScotlandP209-50Pounds-1981-donatedowl_f.jpg |archivedate=30 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scotbanks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotbanks.org.uk/banknotes_current_clydesdale_bank.php |title=Current Banknotes : Clydesdale Bank |publisher=The Committee of Scottish Clearing Bankers |accessdate=15 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003071439/http://www.scotbanks.org.uk/banknotes_current_clydesdale_bank.php |archivedate=3 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 2007 Smith's image also appeared on the new series of [[Bank of England £20 note|£20 notes]] issued by the [[Bank of England]], making him the first Scotsman to feature on an [[Bank of England note issues|English banknote]].&lt;ref name="bbc1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6096938.stm |title=Smith replaces Elgar on £20 note |accessdate=14 May 2008 |publisher=BBC |date=29 October 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324062831/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6096938.stm |archivedate=24 March 2007 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:6 Burlington Gardens facade Smith.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Statue of Smith built in 1867–1870 at the old headquarters of the [[University of London]], 6 Burlington Gardens]]

A large-scale memorial of Smith by [[Alexander Stoddart]] was unveiled on 4 July 2008 in Edinburgh. It is a {{convert|10|ft|adj=on}}-tall bronze sculpture and it stands above the [[Royal Mile]] outside [[St&amp;nbsp;Giles' Cathedral]] in Parliament Square, near the [[Mercat cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Adam Smith sculpture to tower over Royal Mile |date=26 September 2007 |work=[[Edinburgh Evening News]] |author=Blackley, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; 20th-century sculptor [[Jim Sanborn]] (best known for the ''[[Kryptos]]'' sculpture at the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]]) has created multiple pieces which feature Smith's work.

A bust of Smith is in the Hall of Heroes of the [[National Wallace Monument]] in [[Stirling]].

===Residence===
Adam Smith resided at Panmure House from 1778 to 1790. This residence has now been purchased by the [[Edinburgh Business School]] at [[Heriot Watt University]] and fundraising has begun to restore it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The restoration of Panmure House |url=http://www.adamsmith.org/blog/misc/the-restoration-of-panmure-house |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122103606/http://www.adamsmith.org/blog/misc/the-restoration-of-panmure-house |archivedate=22 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Adam Smith's Home Gets Business School Revival |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/video/adam-smith-s-home-gets-business-school-revival-byl368j8Sii~TiQiBHwEyw.html |work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the Northern end of the original building appears to have been demolished in the 19th century to make way for an iron foundry.

===As a symbol of free-market economics===
[[File:Sanborn-CSU.jpg|thumb|upright|''Adam Smith's Spinning Top'', sculpture by [[Jim Sanborn]] at [[Cleveland State University]]|alt=A sculpture of an upside down cone]]

Smith has been celebrated by advocates of free-market policies as the founder of free-market economics, a view reflected in the naming of bodies such as the [[Adam Smith Institute]] in London, the Adam Smith Society&lt;ref name="urlThe Adam Smith Society"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adamsmith.it/presentazione.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070721032612/http://www.adamsmith.it/presentazione.html |archivedate=21 July 2007 |title=The Adam Smith Society |accessdate=24 May 2008 |publisher=The Adam Smith Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Australian Adam Smith Club,&lt;ref name="urlThe Australian Adam Smith Club"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adamsmithclub.org/ |title=The Australian Adam Smith Club |accessdate=12 October 2008 |publisher=Adam Smith Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in terms such as the Adam Smith necktie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications_papers/pub_display.cfm?id=3748 |title=Interview with Milton Friedman |last=Levy |first=David |date=June 1992 |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis |accessdate=1 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Greenspan]] argues that, while Smith did not coin the term ''[[laissez-faire]]'', "it was left to Adam Smith to identify the more-general set of principles that brought conceptual clarity to the seeming chaos of market transactions". Greenspan continues that ''The Wealth of Nations'' was "one of the great achievements in human intellectual history".&lt;ref name="urlFRB: Speech, Greenspan – Adam Smith – 6 February 2005"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20050206/default.htm |title=FRB: Speech, Greenspan – Adam Smith – 6 February 2005 |accessdate=31 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512080427/http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20050206/default.htm |archivedate=12 May 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[P. J. O'Rourke]] describes Smith as the "founder of free market economics".&lt;ref name="urlAdam Smith: Web Junkie – Forbes.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/free_forbes/2007/0507/086.html |title=Adam Smith: Web Junkie |work=Forbes |accessdate=10 June 2008 |date=5 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520232632/http://www.forbes.com/free_forbes/2007/0507/086.html |archivedate=20 May 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers have argued that Smith's support for ''laissez-faire'' (which in French means leave alone) has been overstated. [[Herbert Stein]] wrote that the people who "wear an Adam Smith necktie" do it to "make a statement of their devotion to the idea of free markets and [[limited government]]", and that this misrepresents Smith's ideas. Stein writes that Smith "was not pure or doctrinaire about this idea. He viewed government intervention in the market with great skepticism...yet he was prepared to accept or propose qualifications to that policy in the specific cases where he judged that their net effect would be beneficial and would not undermine the basically free character of the system. He did not wear the Adam Smith necktie." In Stein's reading, ''The Wealth of Nations'' could justify the [[Food and Drug Administration]], the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]], mandatory employer health benefits, environmentalism, and "[[Pigovian tax|discriminatory taxation]] to deter [[sin tax|improper]] or [[sumptuary tax|luxurious behavior]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stein, Herbert |date=6 April 1994 |title=Board of Contributors: Remembering Adam Smith |journal=[[The Wall Street Journal Asia]] |page=A14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Vivienne Brown stated in ''[[The Economic Journal]]'' that in the 20th-century United States, [[Reaganomics]] supporters, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', and other similar sources have spread among the general public a partial and misleading vision of Smith, portraying him as an "extreme dogmatic defender of ''laissez-faire'' capitalism and [[supply-side economics]]".&lt;ref name="Brown93"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brown, Vivienne |date=January 1993 |journal=[[The Economic Journal]] |volume=103 |issue=416 |pages=230–32 |doi=10.2307/2234351 |title=Untitled review of 'Capitalism as a Moral System: Adam Smith's Critique of the Free Market Economy' and 'Adam Smith and his Legacy for Modern Capitalism' |last2=Pack |first2=Spencer J. |last3=Werhane |first3=Patricia H. |jstor=2234351}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, ''The Wealth of Nations'' includes the following statement on the payment of taxes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state.&lt;ref name="Smith 1977 loc=bk. V, ch. 2"&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=bk. V, ch. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some commentators have argued that Smith's works show support for a progressive, not flat, income tax and that he specifically named taxes that he thought should be required by the state, among them [[Luxury tax|luxury-goods taxes]] and tax on rent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/18/101018crbo_books_gopnik |title=Market Man |date=18 October 2010 |work=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Smith argued for the "impossibility of taxing the people, in proportion to their economic revenue, by any capitation" (''The Wealth of Nations,'' V.ii.k.1). Smith argued that taxes should principally go toward protecting "justice" and "certain publick institutions" that were necessary for the benefit of all of society, but that could not be provided by private enterprise (''The Wealth of Nations,'' IV.ix.51).

Additionally, Smith outlined the proper expenses of the government in ''The Wealth of Nations, Book V, Ch. I''. Included in his requirements of a government is to enforce contracts and provide justice system, grant patents and copy rights, provide public goods such as infrastructure, provide national defence, and regulate banking. The role of the government was to provide goods "of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual" such as roads, bridges, canals, and harbours. He also encouraged invention and new ideas through his patent enforcement and support of infant industry monopolies. He supported partial public subsidies for elementary education, and he believed that competition among religious institutions would provide general benefit to the society. In such cases, however, Smith argued for local rather than centralised control: "Even those publick works which are of such a nature that they cannot afford any revenue for maintaining themselves . . . are always better maintained by a local or provincial revenue, under the management of a local and provincial administration, than by the general revenue of the state" (''Wealth of Nations,'' V.i.d.18). Finally, he outlined how the government should support the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate, such that they are equal or above the public in fashion. He even states that monarchs should be provided for in a greater fashion than magistrates of a republic because "we naturally expect more splendor in the court of a king than in the mansion-house of a [[doge]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=bk. V}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he allowed that in some specific circumstances, retaliatory tariffs may be beneficial:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The recovery of a great foreign market will generally more than compensate the transitory inconvenience of paying dearer during a short time for some sorts of goods.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, p. 468.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, he added that in general, a retaliatory tariff "seems a bad method of compensating the injury done to certain classes of our people, to do another injury ourselves, not only to those classes, but to almost all the other classes of them" (''The Wealth of Nations,'' IV.ii.39).

[[Economic historian]]s such as [[Jacob Viner]] regard Smith as a strong advocate of free markets and limited government (what Smith called "natural liberty"), but not as a dogmatic supporter of ''laissez-faire''.&lt;ref name="Viner 1927"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Viner, Jacob |date=April 1927 |journal=[[The Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=198–232 |doi=10.1086/253837 |title=Adam Smith and Laissez-faire |jstor=1823421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Daniel B. Klein|Daniel Klein]] believes using the term "free-market economics" or "free-market economist" to identify the ideas of Smith is too general and slightly misleading. Klein offers six characteristics central to the identity of Smith's economic thought and argues that a new name is needed to give a more accurate depiction of the "Smithian" identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Klein, Daniel B. |year=2008 |title=Toward a Public and Professional Identity for Our Economics |journal=Econ Journal Watch |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=358–72 |url=http://econjwatch.org/articles/toward-a-public-and-professional-identity-for-our-economics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Klein, Daniel B. |year=2009 |title=Desperately Seeking Smithians: Responses to the Questionnaire about Building an Identity |journal=Econ Journal Watch |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=113–80 |url=http://econjwatch.org/articles/desperately-seeking-smithians-responses-to-the-questionnaire-about-building-an-identity}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economist [[David Ricardo]] set straight some of the misunderstandings about Smith's thoughts on free market. Most people still fall victim to the thinking that Smith was a free-market economist without exception, though he was not. Ricardo pointed out that Smith was in support of helping infant industries. Smith believed that the government should subsidise newly formed industry, but he did fear that when the infant industry grew into adulthood, it would be unwilling to surrender the government help.&lt;ref name="New Ideas From Dead Economists"&gt;Buchholz, Todd (December 1990). pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith also supported tariffs on imported goods to counteract an internal tax on the same good. Smith also fell to pressure in supporting some tariffs in support for national defence.&lt;ref name="New Ideas From Dead Economists"/&gt;

Some have also claimed, [[Emma Rothschild]] among them, that Smith would have supported a minimum wage,&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Christopher. "Adam Smith and Liberal Economics: Reading the Minimum Wage Debate of 1795–96," ''Econ Journal Watch'' 8(2): 110–25, May 2011 [http://econjwatch.org/articles/adam-smith-and-liberal-economics-reading-the-minimum-wage-debate-of-1795-96]&lt;/ref&gt; although no direct textual evidence supports the claim. Indeed, Smith wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The price of labour, it must be observed, cannot be ascertained very accurately anywhere, different prices being often paid at the same place and for the same sort of labour, not only according to the different abilities of the workmen, but according to the easiness or hardness of the masters. Where wages are not regulated by law, all that we can pretend to determine is what are the most usual; and experience seems to show that law can never regulate them properly, though it has often pretended to do so. (''The Wealth of Nations'', Book 1, Chapter 8)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Smith also noted, to the contrary, the existence of an [[equality of bargaining power|imbalanced, inequality of bargaining power]]:&lt;ref&gt;A Smith, ''Wealth of Nations'' (1776) Book I, ch 8&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A landlord, a farmer, a master manufacturer, a merchant, though they did not employ a single workman, could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already acquired. Many workmen could not subsist a week, few could subsist a month, and scarce any a year without employment. In the long run, the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him, but the necessity is not so immediate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16744">'''Asian pride''' is a term utilized internationally but has various origins and meanings.&lt;ref name="Misiroglu2015" /&gt;

==International usage==
Asian pride is a broad term that can cover several topics. Within the [[international relations]] context, [[Asian people|Asian]] [[pride]] can be seen within Asian politics as advancement of [[Pan-Asianism]] through heavy criticism of the [[Western world|West]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Langguth |first1=Gerd |year=1996 |title=Dawn of the "Pacific Century"? |journal=German Foreign Affairs Review |volume=47 |issue=4 |url=http://www.gerd-langguth.de/fremdsprachtext/asian_values.htm |accessdate=18 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610190612/http://www.gerd-langguth.de/fremdsprachtext/asian_values.htm |archivedate=10 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dalrymple |first=Rawdon |title=Continental Drift: Australia's Search for a Regional Identity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tujY4nUQdtkC&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=%22Asian%20Pride%22&amp;pg=PA119#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Asian%20Pride%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=9 January 2013 |year=2003 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd |isbn=9780754634461 |page=119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, China referred to India's successful [[Mars Orbiter Mission]] of ''Mangalyaan'' as the "pride of Asia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/china-heralds-indias-mars-mission-mangalyaan-pride-asia-1466953 |title=China Heralds India's Mars Mission Mangalyaan as 'Pride of Asia'

==United States==
The pan-ethnicity Asian American concept is not embraced by many Asian Americans in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wong |first=William |title=Yellow Journalist: Dispatches from Asian America |series=Maping Racisms |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=evNtIyLKQZcC&amp;lpg=PA187&amp;dq=Asian%20pride&amp;pg=PA187#v=onepage&amp;q=Asian%20pride&amp;f=false |accessdate=20 December 2012 |year=2001 |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=9781566398305 |page=187 |quote=The Asian pride argument is not realistic in these times, at least in most cities and especially at state and national levels. For one thing, what is "Asian Pride"? There is a pan-Asian sentiment among some Asian Americans. Many Americans of Asian background, though, don't embrace the vague "Asian American" sobriquet. The identity label of choice rangers from plain old "American" to particular Asian ethnicity.}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Tilden Rhea|title=Race Pride and the American Identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nlue11bhyb4C&amp;pg=PA39|date=1 May 2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-00576-1|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States the term has older roots within the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counter culture movement]] among Asian Americans in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Misiroglu2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Meredith Leigh Oyen|editor=Gina Misiroglu|title=American Countercultures: An Encyclopedia of Nonconformists, Alternative Lifestyles, and Radical Ideas in U.S. History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j4KsBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45|date=26 March 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-47729-7|page=45|chapter=Asian Pride}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period there was the [[Black Power]] movement, and Asian Americans seeing the impact it had on African-American culture and overall society, rejecting being called "[[Oriental]]" and the stereotype of the "[[yellow peril]]" used the term Asian Pride, along with "yellow power", to advance empowerment of Asian Americans.&lt;ref name="Misiroglu2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Margaret L.

A more modern usage of the term "Asian Pride" (also spelled '''AZN pride''') the [[United States]] is a positive stance to being Asian American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ann Malaspina|title=The Ethnic and Group Identity Movements: Earning Recognition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYvUouktxv4C&amp;pg=PA31|year=2007|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0633-5|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term arose from influences of [[Hip hop#Culture|hip hop culture]] within [[Asian American]] communities in the [[Western United States]] due to the creation of an Asian American pan-ethnicity (the concept was influenced in the late 20th century due to the influence of publications such as ''[[Yolk magazine|Yolk]]'' and ''[[Giant Robot (magazine)|Giant Robot]]'' magazines) that did not specify a specific ethnicity (such as [[Vietnamese American|Vietnamese]], or [[Hmong American|Hmong]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=DiMaggio |first=Paul |last2=Fernández-Kelly |first2=María Patricia  |title=Art in the Lives of Immigrant Communities in the United States |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uHJprl1xkmUC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=Asian+pride&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XAfUUPPpLOGuiQLk7YHQAg&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Asian%20pride&amp;f=false |accessdate=20 December 2012 |year=2010 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=9780813547572 |page=135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Kathleen |editor1-last=Nadeau |editor2-first= Jonathan H.X.  |editor2-last=Lee |last=Nguyen |first=Jason R. |title=Encyclopedia of Asian American Folklore and Folklife, Volume 1 |chapter=Pan Asian Americans: "Got Rice?" |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-0sEJ_0vV1QC&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=Asian%20pride&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q=Asian%20pride&amp;f=false |accessdate=20 December 2012 |year=2010 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9780313350672 |page=68 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One manifestation of this was the [[Got Rice?]] term, which spun off from the advertising campaign [[Got Milk?]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ann Malaspina|title=The Ethnic and Group Identity Movements: Earning Recognition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYvUouktxv4C&amp;pg=PA31|year=2007|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0633-5|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Younger Asian Americans are finding strength from their Asian identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chou |first=Rosalind S. |title=Asian American Sexual Politics: The Construction of Race, Gender, and Sexuality |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dVUvp-XcLB8C&amp;lpg=PA182&amp;dq=Asian%20pride&amp;pg=PA182#v=onepage&amp;q=Asian%20pride&amp;f=false |accessdate= |year=2012 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=9781442209244 |page=182 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another usage of the term was [[Greg Pak]]'s ''Asian Pride Porn!'', which used [[political correct]] [[pornography]] parody to present Asian Americans in a positive light compared to their [[Stereotypes of East Asians in the United States#Emasculation and asexuality|portrayal in late 20th century mainstream media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rachel C.

===Got Rice?===
The phrase '''"Got Rice?"''' is a term that was coined by [[Asian American]] youth in the 1990s shortly after the original "[[Got Milk?]]" advertising campaign for the California Milk Board in 1993.&lt;ref name="LeeNadeau2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jonathan H. X. Lee|author2=Kathleen M. Nadeau|title=Encyclopedia of Asian American Folklore and Folklife|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BrfLWdeISoC&amp;pg=PA67|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-35066-5|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase has since come to be used as a symbol for the cohesiveness of Asian American cultural identity and cultural pride, especially on the [[Internet]]. It's usually mentioned close to the [[Asian Pride]] slogan.&lt;ref name="LeeNadeau2011" /&gt;

The humor is derived from the fact that [[rice]] is a staple food in many Asian cultures. The slogan can thus be viewed as an Asian American cultural response to American media and advertising.&lt;ref name="LeeNadeau2011" /&gt;

There is also a parody song called "Got Rice?", often referred as AZN Pride, which samples [[Tupac Shakur|2Pac's]] "[[Changes (Tupac Shakur song)|Changes]]".&lt;ref name="Raphael-HernandezSteen2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TuNguyen2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thuy Linh Nguyen Tu|author2=Mimi Thi Nguyen|title=Alien Encounters: Popular Culture in Asian America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oCt-TShr854C&amp;pg=PA66|date=27 March 2007|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-8983-5|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The song dates back to at least 2000, and has been described as being in the [[wikt:raptivist|raptivist]] genre;&lt;ref name="Raphael-HernandezSteen2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Heike Raphael-Hernandez|author2=Shannon Steen|title=AfroAsian Encounters: Culture, History, Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EvqgBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA151|date=1 November 2006|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-7690-2|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is also noted as an example of Asian Americans, specifically [[Chinese Americans]], adoption and adaption of [[Hip Hop culture]].&lt;ref name="Lee2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan H.

====T-shirt campaign====
While the phrase itself presumably began as Asian American slang, the first notable usage is the T-shirt campaign first started by the Asian American magazine ''[[Yolk magazine|Yolk]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
  | author= Olivia Barker
  | title= Eastern Influences Become Icons of Popular Culture
  | url = http://www.modelminority.com/article8.html
  | publisher=USA Today
  | date = March 22, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Soon, other Asian American organizations began promoting the phrase and selling similar T-shirt designs. The organizations and their proponents intended for the T-shirts to be a fun way of promoting Asian American cultural heritage:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Political identi-tees don’t all have to be so in-your-face. The Japanese American National Museum (http://www.janm.org/) in L.A.’s Little Tokyo offers an array of kinder, gentler tees commemorating aspects of Japanese-American heritage both fun and serious. Among the most popular designs, a line of adult and baby tees feature the rallying cry of the lactose liberation movement, "Got Rice?"
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 |url=http://www.imdiversity.com/Villages/Asian/arts_culture_media/archives/ikeda_asian_tshirts1_archived.asp

 |archivedate=2006-03-16 
 |df= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many in the Asian American community viewed the design as evidence of significant progress for the viability of Asian American culture and identity; whereas before identity may have been enforced on Asians via stereotypes from the dominant society, the "Got Rice?" shirts were an attempt by Asian Americans to define their identity and to take back those symbols used to stereotype them.&lt;ref&gt;Heike Berner.

[[Count]] '''August Dołęga Cieszkowski''' ({{IPAc-en|tʃ|ɛ|s|ˈ|k|ɒ|f|s|k|i}}; 12 September 1814 – 12 March 1894) was a [[Poland|Polish]] philosopher, economist and social and political activist. His Hegelian philosophy influenced the young [[Karl Marx]] and [[Action theory (philosophy)|action theorists]].

==Biography==
Cieszkowski was born in [[Nowa Sucha, Węgrów County|Nowa Sucha]], in the [[Duchy of Warsaw]]. He studied at the [[Jagiellonian University]] and in then, from 1832, at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] where he became interested in [[Hegelianism]] through the lectures of [[Karl Ludwig Michelet]], who became a lifelong friend. He gained his doctorate in philosophy from [[Heidelberg University]] in 1838. After his studies he travelled around Europe, visiting France, England and Italy before returning to Poland in 1840 and settling permanently in Wierzenica, near [[Poznań]], in 1843.

Cieszkowski co-founded the Polish League (Liga Polska) in 1848. He was a member of the [[Kingdom of Prussia#Politics|Prussian National Assembly]] (1848–1855)  and a political activist. He (unsuccessfully) endeavoured to start a university in Poznań and co-founded the [[Poznań Society of Friends of Arts and Sciences]] ([[PTPN]]) in 1857, being elected to its presidency three times (1857–1858, 1861–1868, 1885). It was the most important cultural and scientific society in Poland until the creation of Kraków's [[Academy of Learning]] (Akademia Umiejętności) in 1871-73. In 1870 he founded the Halina School of Agriculture in Żabikowo, named after his wife Halina, who had died in 1861. In 1873 it became affiliated to the Kraków [[Polish Academy of Learning|Academy of Learning]], established in 1872.

==Philosophical work&lt;!--'Historiosophy' redirects here--&gt;==
Cieszkowski coined the term '''historiosophy'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; in his 1838 work ''Prolegomena zur Historiosophie'' (''Prolegomena to a Historiosophy''),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.it/search?tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:%22August+Dołęga+Cieszkowski%22%22Prolegomena+zur+Historiosophie%22+1838 ''Prolegomena zur Historiographie'']. Over a century later, the term has been attributed to [[Gershom Scholem]]: {{cite web |first=Shaul |last=Magid |authorlink=Shaul Magid |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scholem/#HisThe |title=Gershom Scholem. 6. Historiography and Theology |website=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |date=October 30, 2013 |accessdate=February 5, 2017 |quote=This suggests that kabbalistic circles were using metaphysics to reify historical reality, which led Scholem to coin the term "historiosophy" to describe his understanding of history and metaphysics.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a revision of the Hegelian [[philosophy of history]]. He adopted a threefold division of human history from medieval [[millenarians]] such as [[Joachim of Fiore]] and mixed it with Hegelian categories and concepts. He is arguably the creator of the "[[philosophy of action]]."

The ''first'' period of history was that of [[Ancient history|antiquity]]. 

The ''second'' period was the [[Christian era]], which represented the birth of reflectiveness, a turning inwards and upwards from natural sensual immediacy toward the universal and abstract. The spirit existed 'for itself' (''für sich''). This period was marked by an intolerable duality between the opposed worlds of the God and temporal existence, spirit and matter, action and thought. The Hegelian philosophy of spirit, thought and universality at the expense of will, matter and particularly the (Hegelian) spirit had not yet experienced the division of mind and body and living in a primal pre-reflective unity with nature, mainly expressing itself through art. The spirit was 'in itself' (''an sich'') in Hegelian jargon. The  existence represented the apotheosis and supreme manifestation of this period of history.

The ''third'' period of history was the 'post-Hegelian' era in which the dualisms of the last were overcome and superseded. The one-sided emphasis on thought in the Christian era would be overcome and the spirit would assimilate nature to itself as well. Thus philosophy would come to an end as the synthesising and self-actualising activity of the spirit now took the form of creative practical activity. This final stage of the development of spirit represents the ultimate synthesis of opposites: God and world, necessity and freedom, desire and duty, Heaven and Earth are all as one.

Cieszkowski's later works, ''Gott und Paligenesie'' (''God and [[Palingenesis]]'') (1842) and ''Ojcze Nasz'' (''Our Father'', 1848–1906, four volumes), reformulate his triad in much more explicitly religious terms. The three eras are expressed as those of God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. He stresses the role of the Catholic Church and accords a significant world-transforming role to the Slavs (a common theme in the [[History of philosophy in Poland#Messianism|Messianistic]] philosophy current in Poland at the time) in the process through which the Holy Spirit would emerge.

Cieszkowski's belief in a personal God, it has been argued, disqualifies him from being a [[Left Hegelian]], who were distinguished from Hegel's [[Right Hegelians|more orthodox followers]] by their generally critical attitude to religion and Christianity. He was certainly not counted by the Left as one of their own, even though the idea of the unity of philosophy of action was soon taken up by some of its members. On the other hand, he did incorporate an elaborate system of social reforms into his philosophy and was strongly influenced by the French socialist tradition, which was often overtly religious, and thus did not share the characteristic political conservatism of the 'Right Hegelians'.

==Legacy==
[[File:Collegium Cieszkowskich Poznan 2.JPG|thumb|Commemoration plaque, Poznan.]]
Cieszkowski exerted a significant (and reciprocated) influence on Polish Romantic poet, playwright and Gothic novelist [[Zygmunt Krasinski]], whom he met in Milan in 1839 and became close friends with ([[:pl:Józef Kallenbach|Józef Kallenbach]] published (in Polish) two volumes of their correspondence in 1912). He also influenced the poet [[Cyprian Norwid]], philosopher [[:pl:Bronisław Ferdynand Trentowski|Bronisław Trentowski]] and philosopher, art historian and proto-psychologist [[:pl:Józef Kremer|Józef Kremer]]. He is arguably the creator of the "[[philosophy of action]]." His most important philosophical legacy is probably his influence on the young [[Karl Marx]], via German communist and [[Young Hegelian]] [[Moses Hess]]. The latter adopted Cieszkowski's idea of that the dualism between consciousness and action would collapse in the latter part of the history of humanity, though he believed the synthesis had occurred on various occasions throughout history and located the transition to the 'third age' at the Reformation instead of the philosophy of Hegel. Marx, who was a friend of and collaborator with Hess from a few years from 1841 onwards, owes various aspects of his thought on alienation and the nature of and transition to communist society to Cieszkowski, including that the dualism between consciousness and action would collapse in revolutionary ''[[Praxis (process)|praxis]]''.{{fact|date=July 2017}} (Cieszkowski was one of the earliest philosophers to use the term ''praxis'' as meaning "action oriented towards changing society" in his ''Prolegomena zur Historiosophie'').&lt;ref&gt;G. Duncan Mitchell (ed.), ''A New Dictionary of the Social Sciences, Second Edition'', Transaction Publishers, 1979: "praxis."&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Life Sciences in Poznań]] was named the August Cieszkowski Agricultural University of Poznań from 1996 until 11 April 2008, when it gained official university status, in recognition of Cieszkowski's contributions to agricultural science and education in the region.

'''Carlo Cattaneo''' ({{IPA-it|ˈkarlo katˈtaːneo|lang}}; Milan, June 15, 1801 – Castagnola, February 6, 1869) was an Italian philosopher and writer, famous for his role in the [[Five Days of Milan]] on March 1849, when he led the [[city council]] during the rebellion.

==Biography==
[[File:Politecnico1.jpg|thumb|left|The first issue of "Il Politecnico"]]
Cattaneo was born in [[Milan]]. A republican in his convictions, during his youth he had taken part in the [[Carbonari]] movement in [[Lombardy]]. He devoted himself to the study of philosophy, with the hope of regenerating Italian people by withdrawing them from romanticism and rhetoric, and turning their attention to the positive sciences. In this period, Cattaneo met philosopher [[Giandomenico Romagnosi]] and he "was especially attracted by Romagnosi's emphasis on practical solutions and interdisciplinary work".&lt;ref&gt;[[Filippo Sabetti]], ''Civilization and Self-Government: The Political Thought of Carlo Cattaneo'', Lanham, Lexington Books, 2011, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Developing some intuitions coming from his mentor, Cattaneo expounded his ideas in a review founded by him in Milan in 1839, called ''II Politecnico''. He resided at the [[Palazzo Gavazzi]] from 1840 until 1848.&lt;ref name="Simone2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Simone|first=Gabriella Anedi de|title=Milano nei palazzi privati: cortili, giardini, salotti|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BPgVAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=September 12, 2012|year=2003|publisher=CELIP|page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolution===
When the revolution of 1848 broke out, he threw himself heart and soul into the fray, and became one of the leading spirits of the insurrection against the Austrians, known as the [[Five Days of Milan]] (March 18 – 22, 1848). Together with the young democrats Enrico Cernuschi, Giulio Terzaghi and Giorgio Clerici he formed a council of war which, having its headquarters at Palazzo Taverna in via Bigli, directed the operations of the insurgents.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was second to none in self-sacrifice and heroic resolution. When on March 18 Field Marshal [[Radetzky]], feeling that the position of the Austrian garrison was untenable, sounded the rebels as to their terms, some of the leaders were inclined to agree to an armistice which would give time for the Piedmontese troops to arrive (Piedmont had just declared war), but Cattaneo insisted on the complete evacuation of Lombardy. Again, on March 21, Radetzky tried to obtain an armistice, and Durini and Borromeo were ready to grant it, for it would have enabled them to reorganize the defences and replenish the supplies of food and ammunition, which could only last another day. But, Cattaneo replied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The enemy having furnished us with munitions thus far, will continue to do so. Twenty-four hours of victuals and twenty-four hours of hunger will be many more hours than we shall need. This evening, if the plans we have just arranged should succeed, the line of the bastions will be broken. At any rate, even though we should lack bread, it is better to die of hunger than on the gallows.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Carlo Cattaneo2.jpg|thumb|left|Cattaneo in his later years]]
On the expulsion of the Austrians the question arose as to the future government of Milan and Italy. Cattaneo was an uncompromising republican and a federalist; so violent was his dislike of the Piedmontese monarchy that when he heard that King Charles Albert had been defeated by the Austrians, and that Radetzky was marching back to reoccupy Milan, he exclaimed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Good news, the Piedmontese have been beaten. Now we shall be our own masters; we shall fight a people's war, we shall chase the Austrians out of Italy, and set up a Federal Republic.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Writings===
[[File:Cattaneo - Memorie di economia pubblica dal 1833 al 1860, 1860 - 5707207.tif|thumb|''Memorie di economia pubblica dal 1833 al 1860'', 1860]]
When the Austrians returned, Cattaneo had to flee and took refuge in Lugano, where he gave lessons, wrote his Storia della Rivoluzione del 1848 (History of the 1848 Revolution), the Archivio triennale delle cose d'Italia (3 vols., 1850–1855), then, early in 1860, he started publishing the Politecnico once more. He strongly opposed Cavour for his unitarian views, and for the cession of Nice and Savoy. In 1860 Garibaldi summoned him to Naples to take part in the government of the Neapolitan provinces, but he would not agree to the union with Piedmont without local autonomy. After the union of Italy he was frequently asked to stand for parliament, but always refused because he could not conscientiously take the oath of allegiance to the monarchy. In 1868 the pressure of friends overcame his resistance, and he agreed to stand, but at the last moment he drew back, still unable to take the oath, and returned to Lugano, where he died in 1869.

As a writer, Cattaneo was learned and brilliant, but some view him as being too bitter a partisan to be judicious, owing to his narrowly republican views; his ideas on local autonomy were wise, but, at a moment when unity was regarded as an absolute requisite, they were deemed inopportune.

===Death===

He died in [[Castagnola]], close to [[Lugano]] in the Swiss canton of [[Ticino]], where he had spent the last twenty years of his life in exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{HDS|3315|Castagnola|author=Antonio Gili}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:RadulescuMotru.PNG|thumb|170px|Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]]
'''Constantin Rădulescu-Motru''' ({{IPA-ro|konstanˈtin rəduˈlesku ˈmotru}}; born '''Constantin Rădulescu''', he added the surname ''[[Motru]]'' in 1892; February 15, 1868&amp;nbsp;– March 6, 1957) was a [[Romania]]n philosopher, psychologist, sociologist, [[logician]], academic, dramatist, as well as [[centre-left]] [[Nationalism|nationalist]] politician with a noted [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] discourse. A [[list of members of the Romanian Academy|member of the Romanian Academy]] after 1923, he was its vice president in 1935–1938, 1941–1944, and its president between 1938 and 1941.

==Early life==
Born in [[Butoieşti]], [[Mehedinţi County]], he was the son of Radu Poppescu, whose natural father was [[Eufrosin Poteca]],&lt;ref&gt;Rădulescu-Motru, ''Revizuiri şi adăugiri...''&lt;/ref&gt; and Judita Butoi. His mother died during childbirth, and Radu Poppescu married Ecaterina Cernăianu, who gave birth to Constantin's nine half-siblings.

During his childhood, Constantin fell ill with [[malaria]]. He also fractured a leg, resulting in a permanent physical impediment.

Radu Poppescu, who worked as a secretary for Poteca for part of his life, inherited a certain sum after the death of his employer and father; this was to take the form of a [[scholarship]] for Constantin Rădulescu. He ultimately refused to make use of it, indicating that he would use instead revenue from his [[Estate (land)|estate]] in Butoieşti; the scholarship was eventually awarded to [[Gheorghe Ţiţeica]], the renowned mathematician.

In 1885, he graduated from [[Carol I National College|Carol I High School]] in [[Craiova]], and subsequently entered the [[University of Bucharest]], applying to both its Faculty of Law and Faculty of Letters. He was taught by [[Titu Maiorescu]], who was to become his mentor, and attended lectures by [[Constantin Dumitrescu-Iaşi]], [[V. A. Urechia]], [[Grigore Tocilescu]], and [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]]. He was part of the last generation of [[intellectual]]s to participate in the activities of the ''[[Junimea]]'' [[literary society]] (where Maiorescu had endured as the major influence).&lt;ref&gt;Stahl; Vulcănescu&lt;/ref&gt;

Rădulescu-Motru was awarded a law degree ''[[magna cum laude]]'' in 1888, and passed his philosophy exam the following year.

==Studies abroad==
In the summer of 1889, he accompanied Maiorescu on a trip to [[Austria-Hungary]], [[German Empire|Germany]], and [[Switzerland]], notably visiting the [[University of Vienna]] and the [[University of Munich]], establishing contacts with German academics. This brought his inclusion into the last stage of a program initiated by Maiorescu as the [[Kingdom of Romania]]'s Minister of Education: alongside other important cultural and scientific figures (such as [[Alexandru A. Philippide]], [[Ştefan Zeletin]], [[Ion Rădulescu-Pogoneanu]], [[Iorgu Iordan]], [[Simion Mehedinţi]], [[Nicolae Bănescu]], [[P. P. Negulescu]], [[Teohari Antonescu]], and [[Constantin Litzica]]), he was given official assistance in order complete his education abroad (in order to provide Romania with a new generation of academics).&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, he directed his interest towards studies in [[France]], attending [[Henry Beaunis]]' lectures in psychology at the [[University of Paris]] during the fall of 1899.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă; Ornea 1995, p.188&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1890 and 1893, Rădulescu settled in Germany&amp;nbsp;– he lived in [[Munich]] and studied at the university for one semester (as a student of [[Carl Stumpf]]), and then moved to [[Leipzig]], where he began working in the laboratory of [[Wilhelm Wundt]] at the [[University of Leipzig|local university]]. While completing his training with Wundt, he attended classes in physics, [[physiology]], [[chemistry]], [[psychiatry]], and mathematics, as well as [[Gustav Weigand]]'s lectures in [[Romanian language|Romanian philology]]. He married a German woman, who later refused to accompany him back to Romania; they eventually divorced. He took his [[doctorate]] in 1893, with a thesis on [[Immanuel Kant]]'s philosophy (''Zur Entwickelung von Kant's Theorie der Naturkausalität''), one notably quoted by [[Henri Bergson]] in his ''[[Introduction to Metaphysics (Bergson)|Introduction à la Métaphysique]]''.

==Academic and political career==
After 1897, [[Spiru Haret]], he served on the editorial board of [[Spiru Haret]]'s ''Albina'' [[popular science]] magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Antonescu&lt;/ref&gt; On January 1, 1900, he also founded and edited ''[[Noua Revistă Română]]'' (which published articles by, among others, [[Nicolae Iorga]], [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], [[George Coşbuc]], [[Lazăr Şăineanu]], [[Ioan Nădejde]], [[Ovid Densusianu]], [[H. Sanielevici]], and [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]]).&lt;ref&gt;Adamescu&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed to the chair of Philosophy at the University of Bucharest in 1906 (after three years of employment at the cultural foundation created by [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]]),&lt;ref&gt;Ornea 1995, p.188&lt;/ref&gt; he was also the founder of the review ''Studii filosofice'' (later renamed ''Revista de filosofie''), and, in 1918, became head of the [[National Theatre Bucharest]].

In 1923, Rădulescu-Motru joined [[Virgil Madgearu]], [[Constantin Costa-Foru]], [[Victor Eftimiu]], [[Grigore Iunian]], [[Radu D. Rosetti]], [[Dem I. Dobrescu]], and the [[Socialism|socialists]] [[Constantin Titel Petrescu]], [[Nicolae L. Lupu]], and [[Constantin Mille]], in creating ''Liga Drepturilor Omului'' (the League for [[Human Rights]]), protesting against measures taken by the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal]] cabinet of [[Ion I. C. Brătianu]] in dealing with left-wing opposition forces.&lt;ref&gt;''Constantin Titel Petrescu''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, Rădulescu-Motru, [[Nicolae Basilescu]], and [[Traian Bratu]] were part of a government-appointed committee investigating the roles of [[A. C. Cuza]] and [[Corneliu Şumuleanu]] in the [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] violence having occurred at the [[University of Iaşi]] in 1923-1925.&lt;ref&gt;''Evreii în prima universitate...''&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially a [[Conservatism|conservative]],&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.119"&gt;Ornea 1995, p.119&lt;/ref&gt; he became active inside the newly created [[National Peasants' Party]] towards the end of the 1920s,&lt;ref&gt;Niculae et al., p.15&lt;/ref&gt; and adapted the group's advocacy of a peasant state that would favour small-scale agricultural property (an echo of [[Poporanism]]), while taking a more [[Centrism|centrist]] stand than his friend Madgearu.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea 1995, p.120&lt;/ref&gt; A member of the party's Study Circle, he took part in drafting a new party program (a 1935 initiative taken by [[Ion Mihalache]] and [[Mihai Ralea]], it also involved the left-wingers [[Ernest Ene]], [[Mihail Ghelmegeanu]], and [[Petre Andrei]]).&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.119"/&gt;

It was at this time that his ideas on [[ethnicity]] (''Romanianism'') came to be debated by various figures on the [[Right-wing politics|Right]], and were the subject of virulent criticism from [[intellectual]]s sympathetic to the [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Iron Guard]], who notably rejected his commitment to [[secularism]] and Maiorescu's ''[[Junimea]]'' tradition ([[Mircea Vulcănescu]] spoke against "his hostile attitude, shared by his ''Junimist'' colleagues, against the penetration of a new, religious spirit, inside the University [of Bucharest]"),&lt;ref&gt;Vulcănescu, in Ornea 1995, p.78&lt;/ref&gt; as well as from the nationalist [[Modernism|modernist]] [[Lucian Blaga]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea 1995, p.84, 119-129&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a later assessment of his work by Vulcănescu, who had since become influenced by the centrist National Peasants' Party member [[Dimitrie Gusti]], the latter's outlook on [[sociology]] was also in disagreement with Rădulescu-Motru's adherence to ''Junimist'' guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;Vulcănescu&lt;/ref&gt;

Toward the end of the 1930s, Rădulescu-Motru was involved in a dispute with the [[far right]] philosopher [[Nae Ionescu]], who, although appointed his assistant at the Philosophy department, had begun to criticize his views in the pro-Iron Guard journal ''[[Cuvântul]]''; writing to [[Mircea Eliade]] in 1938, he accused Ionescu of various unacademic practices, including using lectures on Logic to promote "a sort of dilettante [[mysticism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Rădulescu-Motru, in Handoca&lt;/ref&gt;

The President of the Academy at the moment when [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] assumed dictatorial powers, he chose to support the new [[National Renaissance Front]] (FRN) regime, and moved away from party politics.&lt;ref name="Ţurlea"&gt;Ţurlea&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in office after Carol's fall from power of and the establishment of the Iron Guard's [[National Legionary State]] government; in the autumn of 1940, as Madgearu and [[Nicolae Iorga]], who had been assassinated by the Guard's armed groups, were being buried, he led the delegation of Academy members who defied the policies of [[Horia Sima]] by attending the funeral.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea 1995, p.341&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], he was supportive of the dictatorship of [[Ion Antonescu]] and Romania's alliance with [[Nazi Germany]] against the [[Soviet Union]]. As late as 1944 he abhorred the attempts of the Romanian opposition to negotiate the country's switch to the camp of the [[Allies of World War II|United Nations]]. Even after the war, in his personal journals he continued to adopt a position sympathetic to the Romanian and Nazi [[war criminal]]s, dismissing the [[Nuremberg Trials]] and the [[Romanian People's Tribunals|People's Tribunals]].&lt;ref name="Ornea 1999"&gt;Ornea 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communist persecution==
Critical of Romania's exit from the [[Axis Powers]] during [[World War II]] (''see [[Romania during World War II]]''),&lt;ref name="Ornea 1999"/&gt; he was alarmed by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] advances and the [[Soviet occupation of Romania|eventual occupation]]; in his private notes, he deplored the fact that Romania failed to adopt the [[Marshall Plan]].&lt;ref&gt;Rădulescu-Motru, in Lăcustă&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1948, six months after the establishment of a [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], Rădulescu-Motru was among [[List of purged members of the Romanian Academy|the members of the Academy purged]] by the new authorities (he was reinstated post-mortem in 1990).&lt;ref&gt;Dumitrescu&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his protests, his entire work was dismissed by official [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] rhetoric as "[[idealism]]".&lt;ref name="Bagdasar, in Dumitrescu"&gt;Bagdasar, in Dumitrescu&lt;/ref&gt;

He was denied employment in his field of expertise, until two years before his death, when he was admitted to the minor post of researcher at the Psychology Institute; according to his biographer N. Bagdasar, his final years were marked by extreme poverty.&lt;ref name="Bagdasar, in Dumitrescu"/&gt; Granted assistance following the interventions of [[Miron Constantinescu]] and [[Constantin Ion Parhon]], Rădulescu-Motru was hospitalized in a [[Bucharest]] clinic for much of his final years.&lt;ref name="Bagdasar, in Dumitrescu"/&gt; He died while in there, and was buried in [[Bellu cemetery]].

==Philosophy and politics==

===Outlook===
Influenced by [[Wilhelm Wundt]]'s theories on [[introspection]], Rădulescu-Motru moved away from [[Kantianism|Kantian]] philosophy and its tenet regarding the impossibility of transcending reality as perceived through the senses. He considered [[metaphysics]] to be open to [[Epistemology|objective]] scrutiny, and placed their knowledge at the summit of philosophical approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Isac; Ornea 1995, p.121-122&lt;/ref&gt;

Stating that there was, in effect, a unity between [[person]] and material nature, Rădulescu-Motru developed his own version of [[Personalism]], which thought of the human being and its [[Personality psychology|personality]] as the goal of [[evolution]] in nature&amp;nbsp;– a theory he called ''Energetic Personalism''.&lt;ref&gt;Isac&lt;/ref&gt; He recognized the influence of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s views on the relation between [[being]] and the [[Holism|whole]], arguing that his [[Idealism|idealist]] concept of [[externalization]] ("the belief that the world is being led by our ideal",&lt;ref&gt;Rădulescu-Motru, in Vianu, p.313&lt;/ref&gt; which he deemed "transitory Personalism")&lt;ref&gt;Rădulescu-Motru, in Vianu, p.314&lt;/ref&gt; had been the driving force behind all modern ideologies, from [[Socialism]] and [[Anarchism]] to [[Liberalism]] (''see [[Right Hegelians]] and [[Left Hegelians]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p.313&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to Wundt's ''[[Völkerpsychologie]]'', Rădulescu-Motru dedicated much of his work to assessing and defining [[nationalism]] in Romanian social context. Concentrating his analysis on the impact of [[modernization]] and [[Westernization]], he argued for a need to adapt forms to the [[Romanians|Romanian ethnicity]] (which he defined through [[heredity]]),&lt;ref name="Caraiani"&gt;Caraiani&lt;/ref&gt; and represented as the true social fundament (the "community of spirit").&lt;ref&gt;Rădulescu-Motru, in Stahl&lt;/ref&gt; He supported the existence of [[Racism|human races and differences among them]], as well as [[eugenics]], even after the defeat of Nazi Germany led to the abandonment of such theories in the mainstream scientific world.&lt;ref name="Ornea 1999"/&gt;

===Views on modernization===
In his ''Cultura română şi politicianismul'' ("Romanian culture and petty politics"), he devised a [[hierarchy]] of cultures, placing [[Western world|Western civilization]] at the top of the scale, and the [[Far East]] at its bottom;&lt;ref&gt;Pantelimon; Stahl&lt;/ref&gt; he later confessed to [[Mircea Eliade]] his reticence in dealing with [[Hindu philosophy]] (conversations between the two centered instead on [[Indian nationalism]] in general and ''[[Satyagraha]]'' in particular).&lt;ref&gt;Handoca&lt;/ref&gt; The system placed Romania in the margin of European progress, still subject to adopting cultural forms from Western societies:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Nowhere have [[bourgeois]] institutions stemmed out of natural spiritual needs of the peoples, but rather out of the needs of [[capitalism]]; the complete harmonizing of these institutions with the popular [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] was a gradual, difficult enterprise, the more so in our country, where the dazzling development of capitalism has left the spiritual evolution, always more laborious, far behind."&lt;ref&gt;Rădulescu-Motru, in Ornea 1995, p.25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Elsewhere, he argued that, despite a traditional pattern of [[individualism]], Romanians lacked "[[Initiative (enterprise)|initiative]] in economic and social life, the two characteristics traits of individualism as experienced by the cultured [[Western world|Western peoples]] and constituting bourgeois spirit";&lt;ref name="Rădulescu-Motru, in Scurtu et al."&gt;Rădulescu-Motru, in Scurtu et al.&lt;/ref&gt; according to him, the common folk relied on collective work, which had ensured the survival of village communities during "cursed centuries"&lt;ref name="Rădulescu-Motru, in Scurtu et al."/&gt; (maintaining the mobility of villages "from plain to mountains",&lt;ref name="Rădulescu-Motru, in Scurtu et al."/&gt; but preventing their actual breakup during the [[Romania in the Middle Ages|medieval period]]).

In his chapters on the [[universal suffrage]], the [[parliamentary system]], and the [[1923 Constitution of Romania|Romanian Constitution of 1923]], Rădulescu-Motru expanded on this fundamentally [[Conservatism|conservative]] thesis, arguing that such reforms had come too soon to be properly integrated.&lt;ref name="Antonesei; Pantelimon"&gt;Antonesei; Pantelimon&lt;/ref&gt; The main danger he saw in the process was the appearance of "petty politics" (''politicianism''), which, he argued, had a potential of destroying natural developments inside the nation.&lt;ref name="Antonesei; Pantelimon"/&gt;

Taking in view the characteristics of this evolution towards petty politics, he vehemently rejected [[Mihai Eminescu]]'s theory on the almost exclusively foreign origin of the bourgeoisie inside the post-[[Phanariotes|Phanariote]] [[Romanian Old Kingdom|Old Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Rădulescu-Motru, in Dumitrescu&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Rădulescu-Motru expanded on [[Titu Maiorescu]]'s criticism of "forms without fundament" (in reference to the discrepancy between the Westernized facade and the underdeveloped economic and social setting), viewing the class of low-ranking [[boyars]], increasingly attracted to [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|Liberal currents]] during the 19th century, as the main agents of incoherent change&amp;nbsp;– this attracted him the criticism of the [[Poporanism|Poporanist]] [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]], who argued that ''[[Junimea]]'' was an [[Exclusivism|exclusivist]] school of criticism that "has never said [of foreign models] what, how much, and when should be imported".&lt;ref&gt;Ibrăileanu, ''Primul junimist...''&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, Ibrăileanu emphasized the gestures of boyars before and during the ''[[Regulamentul Organic|Organic Regulation]]'' government, as indicative of a skeptical nationalist mood (rather than of a [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] ideology).&lt;ref&gt;Ibrăileanu, ''Evoluţia spiritului critic...''&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Romanianism'' and secularism===
With ''Învăţământul filosofic în România'' ("Philosophical education in Romania"), his 1931 essay first published in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', Rădulescu-Motru introduced a polemic that was to mark numerous other writings of his during the following period: reacting to the growth in appeal of [[far right]] magazines that claimed to follow a [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] philosophy&amp;nbsp;– ''[[Cuvântul]]'' and ''[[Gândirea]]''&amp;nbsp;–, he made a difference between a "[[Belles-lettres|belletristic]]" trend in higher learning and a "scientific" one, arguing in favour of the latter, and presenting the former as the objective source of [[Anti-intellectualism|anti-intellectualist]] attitudes he observed inside the new political phenomenon&lt;ref&gt;Ornea 1995, p.77-78&lt;/ref&gt; (which emphasized the "human need for mystery").&lt;ref&gt;Rădulescu-Motru, in Ornea 1995, p.83&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, the [[Secularism|secularist]] Rădulescu-Motru followed the ''Junimea'' tradition of rejecting [[mysticism]], viewing it as the unwanted characteristic of a [[working class]] mentality.&lt;ref name="Caraiani"/&gt;

He questioned the [[Subjectivism|subjective]] approaches of [[Lucian Blaga]], [[Nichifor Crainic]], and [[Nae Ionescu]]: developing his ''Romanianism'', Rădulescu-Motru stated his support for cultural and national dialogue ("and not the isolation of each people in its own ethnicity"),&lt;ref name="Rădulescu-Motru, in Ornea, p.85"&gt;Rădulescu-Motru, in Ornea 1995, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; and for the ultimate integration of Romanian culture in the highest section of European culture.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea 1995, p.120-121&lt;/ref&gt; He even argued that principles supported by the Right in defining Romanian specificity were in fact being shared with other cultures (answering Blaga's emphasis on [[Romanian folklore]], he pointed out that its themes were commonplace in neighbouring [[Balkans|Balkan]] cultures;&lt;ref&gt;Rădulescu-Motru, in Ornea 1995, p.84&lt;/ref&gt; replying to Ionescu's views on allegedly particular tendencies toward [[theology]] and [[metaphysics]] inside national culture, he stated his belief that "the prestige of the [[metaphor]], the attraction towards mystery and the [[ontology]] of the [[Ethnic group|ethnos]] [...] only show themselves from the second quarter of the 20th century onwards, [and are under the influence of] foreign university circles [...]";&lt;ref name="Rădulescu-Motru, in Ornea, p.85"/&gt; he also rejected Crainic's views on Orthodoxy as the source for specificity, arguing for [[Christianity and world religions|Christian universalism]] in detriment of "nationalist spirituality"&lt;ref&gt;Rădulescu-Motru, in Ornea 1995, p.122&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– an idea nevertheless interpreted by Crainic as evidence of "militant philosophical [[atheism]]").&lt;ref&gt;Crainic, in Ornea 1995, p.125&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peasant doctrine===
After joining the [[National Peasants' Party]], Rădulescu-Motru maintained a particular approach towards the group's doctrines and policies after 1935: adapting his criticism of [[individualism]] (a trait he associated with the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberals]]) to the [[Poporanism|Poporanist]] doctrine of the "peasant state", he defined the latter as necessarily "[[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]]":
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[It] differs from other totalitarian states in that it sets among its norms, first and foremost, the preeminence of the permanent interests of the peasant population. Unlike the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist]], the [[Nazi Germany|National-Socialist]], and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] states, it believes that it can serve the totality of the population it is supposed to govern, not on the basis of a glorious [[Imperialism|imperialist]] tradition, or through the cultivation of a [[Aryan race|race relation]], or through industrial structuring on the basis of [[first five-year plan|a dictatorial plan]], but through the creation of a healthy, moral, and labouring peasantry, ready to defend the country's borders as the geographical and historical conditions demand it."&lt;ref&gt;Rădulescu-Motru, in Niculae et al., p.209&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A pro-[[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] critic soon reproached that such an ideal, despite its aim to compete with purely nationalist trends, was in fact [[social class]]-based, and its "numerical, that is to say [[Democracy|democratic]]" definition (around the argument that peasants formed the majority in Romania) was leading to "peasant [[Anomie|anarchy]]".&lt;ref&gt;Nicolae Roşu, in Ornea 1995, p.126&lt;/ref&gt;

Rădulescu-Motru came to support [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]]'s [[National Renaissance Front]] (FRN) and the [[One-party state|one-party system]] in 1938, speaking out in favour of the kings' initiative to introduce [[uniform]]s for members of the Academy (clashing over the matter with his fellow academic [[Nicolae Iorga]], in February 1939).&lt;ref name="Ţurlea"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19398">'''Due process''' is the legal requirement that the state must respect all [[legal rights]] that are owed to a person. Due process balances the power of [[law of the land]] and protects the individual person from it. When a government harms a person without following the exact course of the law, this constitutes a due process violation, which offends the [[rule of law]].

[[File:Attorney General Seal Variant.jpg|thumb|right|A variant of [[Lady Justice]] used in [[California Department of Justice|California]], wherein the blindfold covering her eyes represents the due process of law]]

Due process has also been frequently interpreted as limiting [[law]]s and [[legal process|legal proceedings]] (see [[substantive due process]]) so that judges, instead of legislators, may define and guarantee fundamental fairness, justice, and liberty. That interpretation has proven controversial. Analogous to the concepts of [[natural justice]], and [[procedural justice]] used in various other jurisdictions, the interpretation of due process is sometimes expressed as a command that the government must not be unfair to the people or abuse them physically.
The term is not used in contemporary English law, but two similar concepts are [[natural justice]], which generally applies only to decisions of administrative agencies and some types of private bodies like trade unions, and the British constitutional concept of the [[rule of law]] as articulated by [[A. V. Dicey]] and others.&lt;ref name="Marshall, 69"&gt;Geoffrey Marshall, "Due Process in England", in ''Nomos XVIII: Due Process'', eds. J. Roland Pennock &amp; John W. Chapman, 69–92 (New York: New York University Press, 1977), 69.&lt;/ref&gt; However, neither concept lines up perfectly with the American theory of due process, which, as explained below, presently contains many implied rights not found in either ancient or modern concepts of due process in England.&lt;ref
name="Marshall, 69–70"&gt;Marshall, 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due process developed from clause 39 of [[Magna Carta]] in England. Reference to due process first appeared in a statutory rendition of clause 39 in 1354 thus: "No man of what state or condition he be, shall be put out of his lands or tenements nor taken, nor disinherited, nor put to death, without he be brought to answer by due process of law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt5bfrag1_user.html| title = CRS Annotated Constitution: Due Process| accessdate = June 30, 2014
| publisher = Cornell University Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt; When English and American law gradually diverged, due process was not upheld in England but became incorporated in the [[US Constitution]].

==By jurisdiction==

===Magna Carta===
In clause 39 of [[Magna Carta]], issued in 1215, [[John of England]] promised: "No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any other way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land."&lt;ref name="Magna"&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/magnacarta.html The Text of Magna Carta (1215)]&lt;/ref&gt; Magna Carta itself immediately became part of the "[[law of the land]]", and Clause 61 of that charter authorized an elected body of 25 barons to determine by majority vote what redress the King must provide when the King offends "in any respect against any man."&lt;ref name="Magna"/&gt; Thus, Magna Carta established the [[rule of law]] in England by not only requiring the monarchy to obey the law of the land but also limiting how the monarchy could change the law of the land. However, in the 13th century, the provisions may have been referring only to the rights of landowners, and not to ordinary peasantry or villagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McKechnie |first=William Sharp |title=Magna Carta: A Commentary on the Great Charter of King John |publisher=Robert MacLehose and Co., Ltd. |year=1905 |location=Glasgow |pages=136–37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCWIAAAAMAAJ}}: "The question must be considered an open one; but much might be said in favor of the opinion that 'freeman' as used in the Charter is synonymous with 'freeholder'...."&lt;/ref&gt;

Shorter versions of Magna Carta were subsequently issued by British [[monarchs]], and Clause 39 of Magna Carta was renumbered "29."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/magna_carta/translation.html The Text of Magna Carta (1297)]&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''due process of law'' first appeared in a statutory rendition of Magna Carta in 1354 during the reign of [[Edward III of England]], as follows: "No man of what state or condition he be, shall be put out of his lands or tenements nor taken, nor disinherited, nor put to death, without he be brought to answer by due process of law."&lt;ref&gt;28 Edw. 3, c. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1608, the English jurist [[Edward Coke]] wrote a treatise in which he discussed the meaning of Magna Carta. Coke explained that no man shall be deprived but by ''legem terrae'', the law of the land, "that is, by the common law, statute law, or custom of England.... (that is, to speak it once and for all) by the due course, and process of law.."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/18th/coke2nd1797/coke2nd1797_051-100.pdf 2 ''Institutes of the Laws of England'' 46 (1608)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the clause in Magna Carta and the later statute of 1354 were again explained in 1704 (during the reign of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]) by the [[King's Bench|Queen's Bench]], in the case of ''Regina v. Paty''.&lt;ref name="paty"&gt;''Regina v. Paty'', 92 Eng. Rep. 232, 234 (1704) reprinted in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SA4wAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1108&amp;lpg=PA1108&amp;dq=%22not+confined+to+the+common+law+but+takes+in+all+the+other+laws+which+are+in+force+in+this+realm%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=TXaUQaHu_X&amp;sig=x3B0WSlbDv2Y0HufHcrZAfneS6U Reports of Cases Argued and Adjudged in the Courts of King's Bench and Common Pleas: In the Reigns of the Late King William, Queen Anne, King George the First, and King George the Second]'', Vol. 2, pp. 1105, 1108.(1792).&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, the [[British House of Commons]] had deprived John Paty and certain other citizens of the right to vote in an election and committed them to [[Newgate Prison]] merely for the offense of pursuing a legal action in the courts.&lt;ref&gt;Dudley Julius Medly, [https://books.google.com/books?num=100&amp;q=%22julius+medley%22+and+%22Manual+of+english+constitutional+history%22+and+1902&amp;as_brr=1 ''A Student's Manual of English Constitutional History'' 613 (1902)]&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen's Bench, in an opinion by Justice Powys,{{clarification needed|date=January 2018|reason=Finding for which party?}} explained the meaning of "due process of law" as follows:
{{quote|[I]t is objected, that by Mag. Chart. c. 29, no man ought to be taken or imprisoned, but by the law of the land. But to this I answer, that lex terrae is not confined to the common law, but takes in all the other laws, which are in force in this realm; as the civil and canon law.... By the 28 Ed. 3, c. 3, there the words lex terrae, which are used in Mag. Char. are explained by the words, due process of law; and the meaning of the statute is, that all commitments must be by a legal authority; and the law of Parliament is as much a law as any, nay, if there be any superiority this is a superior law.&lt;ref name="paty"/&gt;}}

[[John Holt (judge)|Chief Justice Holt]] dissented in this case because he believed that the commitment had not in fact been by a legal authority. The House of Commons had purported to legislate unilaterally, without approval of the [[British House of Lords]], ostensibly to regulate the election of its members.&lt;ref&gt;George Godfrey Cunningham,[https://books.google.com/books?num=100&amp;q=%22John+Paty%2C+and+four+others%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=1 4 ''Lives of Eminent and Illustrious Englishmen'' 54 (1835)]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Queen's Bench held that the House of Commons had not infringed or overturned due process, John Paty was ultimately freed by Queen Anne when she [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogued]] Parliament.

===English law and American law diverge===

Throughout centuries of British history, many laws and treatises asserted various requirements as being part of "due process" or included in the "law of the land". That view usually held in regards to what was required by existing law, rather than what was intrinsically required by due process itself. As the [[United States Supreme Court]] has explained, a due process requirement in Britain was not "essential to the idea of due process of law in the prosecution and punishment of crimes, but was only mentioned as an example and illustration of due process of law as it actually existed in cases in which it was customarily used."&lt;ref name="caselaw1"&gt;''Hurtado v. California'', {{ussc|110|516|1884}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the scattered references to "due process of law" in [[English law]] did not limit the power of the government; in the words of American law professor [[John V. Orth]], "the great phrases failed to retain their vitality."&lt;ref&gt;John V. Orth, ''Due Process of Law: A Brief History'' ([[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence, KS]]: University Press of Kansas, 2003), 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Orth points out that this is generally attributed to the rise of the doctrine of [[parliamentary supremacy]] in the United Kingdom, which was accompanied by hostility towards [[judicial review]] as an undemocratic foreign invention.&lt;ref&gt;Orth, 28–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have occasionally interpreted Lord Coke's ruling in ''[[Dr. Bonham's Case]]'' as implying the possibility of judicial review, but by the 1870s, [[John Campbell, 1st Baron Campbell|Lord Campbell]] was dismissing judicial review as "a foolish doctrine alleged to have been laid down extra-judicially in Dr. Bonham's Case..., a conundrum [that] ought to have been laughed at."&lt;ref&gt;Orth, 29.&lt;/ref&gt;
Lacking the power of judicial review, English courts possessed no means by which to declare government statutes or actions invalid as a violation of due process. In contrast, American legislators and executive branch officers possessed virtually no means by which to overrule judicial invalidation of statutes or actions as due process violations, with the sole exception of proposing a constitutional amendment, which are rarely successful.&lt;ref&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court recognized that it is nearly impossible for the legislative branch to overrule the Court's constitutional interpretations in ''[[Washington v. Glucksberg]]'', 521 U.S. 702, 720 (1997): "By extending constitutional protection to an asserted right or liberty interest, we, to a great extent, place the matter outside the arena of public debate and legislative action. We must therefore exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field."&lt;/ref&gt;  As a consequence, English law and American law diverged.  Unlike their English counterparts, American judges became increasingly assertive about enforcing due process of law.  In turn, the legislative and executive branches learned how to avoid such confrontations in the first place, by tailoring statutes and executive actions to the constitutional requirements of due process as elaborated upon by the judiciary.

In 1977, an English political science professor explained the present situation in England for the benefit of American lawyers:
&lt;blockquote&gt;An American constitutional lawyer might well be surprised by the elusiveness of references to the term 'due process of law' in the general body of English legal writing.... Today one finds no space devoted to due process in Halsbury's ''Laws of England'', in Stephen's ''Commentaries'', or Anson's ''Law and Custom of the Constitution.'' The phrase rates no entry in such works as Stroud's ''Judicial Dictionary'' or Wharton's ''Law Lexicon.''&lt;ref name="Marshall, 69" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two similar concepts in contemporary English law are [[natural justice]], which generally applies only to decisions of administrative agencies and some types of private bodies like trade unions, and the British constitutional concept of the [[rule of law]] as articulated by [[A. V. Dicey]] and others.&lt;ref name="Marshall, 69"/&gt; However, neither concept lines up perfectly with the American conception of due process, which presently contains many implied rights not found in the ancient or modern concepts of due process in England.&lt;ref name="Marshall, 69–70"/&gt;

===United States===
{{main article|Due Process Clause}}
The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendments]] to the [[United States Constitution]] each contain a [[Due Process Clause]]. Due process deals with the administration of justice and thus the Due Process Clause acts as a safeguard from arbitrary denial of life, liberty, or property by the government outside the sanction of law.&lt;ref name="PAMadisonDPC"&gt;{{cite web |last=Madison |first=P. A. |title=Historical Analysis of the Meaning of the 14th Amendment's First Section |url=http://www.federalistblog.us/mt/articles/14th_dummy_guide.htm#due |publisher=The Federalist Blog |accessdate=19 January 2013|date=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] interprets the clauses as providing four protections: [[procedural due process]] (in civil and criminal proceedings), [[substantive due process]], a prohibition against [[void for vagueness|vague]] laws, and as the vehicle for the [[incorporation of the Bill of Rights]].

===Others===
Various countries recognize some form of due process under [[custom (law)|customary]] [[international law]]. Although the specifics are often unclear, most nations agree that they should guarantee foreign visitors a basic minimum level of justice and fairness. Some nations have argued that they are bound to grant no more rights to aliens than they do to their own [[citizens]], the doctrine of [[national treatment]], which also means that both would be vulnerable to the same deprivations by the government. With the growth of [[international human rights law]] and the frequent use of [[treaty|treaties]] to govern treatment of foreign nationals abroad, the distinction, in practice, between these two perspectives may be disappearing.

'''Edmund L. Gettier III''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|ɛ|t|i|ər}}; born October 31, 1927) is an [[Americans|American]] [[philosopher]] and [[Professor Emeritus]] at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]].  He is best known for his short 1963 article "Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?", which has generated an extensive philosophical literature trying to respond to what became known as the [[Gettier problem]].

==Life==
Gettier was educated at [[Cornell University]], where his mentors included [[Max Black]] and [[Norman Malcolm]]. Gettier, himself, was originally attracted to the opinions of the later [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. His first teaching job was at [[Wayne State University]] in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], where his colleagues included [[Keith Lehrer]], R. C. Sleigh, and [[Alvin Plantinga]]. Because he had few publications, his colleagues urged him to publish any ideas he had just to satisfy the administration. The result was a three-page article that remains one of the most famous in recent philosophical history. According to anecdotal comments that Plantinga has given in lectures, Gettier was originally so unenthusiastic about the article that he had someone translate it into Spanish and published it first in a South American journal.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} The article was later published in [[Analysis (journal)|Analysis]]. Gettier has since not published anything, but he has invented and taught to his graduate students new methods for finding and illustrating countermodels in modal logic, as well as simplified semantics for various modal logics.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

In his article, Gettier challenges the "[[Epistemology#Belief|justified true belief]]" definition of [[knowledge]] that dates back to [[Plato]]'s ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', but is discounted at the end of that very dialogue. This account was accepted by most philosophers at the time, most prominently the epistemologist [[Clarence Irving Lewis]] and his student [[Roderick Chisholm]]. Gettier's article offered counter-examples to this account in the form of cases such that subjects had true beliefs that were also justified, but for which the beliefs were true for reasons unrelated to the justification.  Some philosophers, however, thought the account of knowledge as justified true belief had already been questioned in a general way by the work of Wittgenstein. (Later, a similar argument was found in the papers of [[Bertrand Russell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |title=The Problems of Philosophy |year=1912 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |pages=131f}} Citation taken from {{cite journal |last=Kratzer |first=Angelika |title=Facts: Particulars of Information Units? |journal=[[Linguistics and Philosophy]] |volume=25 |issue=5–6 |year=2002 |pages=655–670 |doi=10.1023/a:1020807615085}}, p. 657.&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Work==
===Gettier problem===
{{main|Gettier problem}}
Gettier provides several examples of [[belief]]s that are both true and justified, but that we should not intuitively term knowledge.  Cases of this sort are now termed "Gettier (counter-)examples". Because Gettier's criticism of the justified true belief model is systemic, other authors have imagined increasingly fantastical counterexamples.  For example: I am watching the men's Wimbledon Final, and John McEnroe is playing Jimmy Connors, it is match point, and McEnroe wins.  I say to myself: "John McEnroe is this year's men's champion at Wimbledon".  Unbeknownst to me, however, the BBC were experiencing a broadcasting fault and so had broadcast a tape of last year's final, when McEnroe also beat Connors.  I had been watching last year's Wimbledon final, so I believed that McEnroe had bested Connors.  But at that same time, in real life, McEnroe was repeating last year's victory and besting Connors!  So my belief that McEnroe bested Connors to become this year's Wimbledon champion is true, and I had good reason to believe so (my belief was justified) — and yet, there is a sense in which I could not really have claimed to "know" that McEnroe had bested Connors because I was only accidentally right that McEnroe beat Connors — my belief was not based on the right kind of justification.

Gettier inspired a great deal of work by philosophers attempting to recover a working definition of knowledge.  Major responses include:
* Gettier's use of "justification" is too general, and only some kinds of justification count.
* Gettier's examples do not count as justification at all, and only some kinds of evidence are justificatory.
* Knowledge must have a fourth condition, such as "no false premises" or "indefeasibility".
* [[Robert Nozick]] suggests knowledge must consist of justified true belief that is "truth-tracking" — a belief such that if it was revealed to be false, it would not have been believed, and conversely.
* [[Colin McGinn]] suggests that knowledge is atomic (it is not divisible into smaller components). We have knowledge when we have knowledge, and an accurate definition of knowledge may even contain the word "knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Colin |last=McGinn |title=The Concept of Knowledge |journal=Midwest Studies in Philosophy |volume=9 |issue= |year=1984 |pages=529–554 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-4975.1984.tb0076.x }} reprinted in {{cite book |pages=7–35 |first=Colin |last=McGinn |title=Knowledge and Reality: Selected Essays |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1999 |isbn=0-19-823823-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2001 study by Weinberg, Nichols, and Stich suggests that the effect of the Gettier problem varies by culture. In particular, people from Western countries seem more likely to agree with the judgments described in the story than do those from East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weinberg |first=J. |last2=Nichols |first2=S. |last3=Stich |first3=S. |title=Normativity and Epistemic Intuitions |journal=[[Philosophical Topics]] |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=429–460 |year=2001 |doi= 10.5840/philtopics2001291/217}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent studies were unable to replicate these results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nagel |first=J. |title=Intuitions and Experiments: A Defense of the Case Method in Epistemology |journal=[[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]] |year=2012 |doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2012.00634.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Egocentric predicament''', a term coined by [[Ralph Barton Perry]] in an article (''Journal of Philosophy 1910''), is the problem of not being able to view [[reality]] outside of our own [[perception]]s. All worldly knowledge takes the form of [[mental representation]]s that our mind examines in different ways. Direct contact with reality cannot be made outside of our own minds; therefore, we cannot be sure reality even exists. This means that we are each limited to our own perceptual world and views. [[Solipsism]] is an extension of this which assumes that only one's own mind is sure to exist.

Since 1710, when [[George Berkeley]] broached in his fashion the problem of the '''egocentric predicament''', denying the existence of material substance except as ideas in the minds of perceivers, and thus asserting a problematical relation with reality, hence has this thesis proved a stumbling block.

[[Samuel Johnson]] is well known for his "refutation" of [[George Berkeley|Bishop Berkeley's]] [[immaterialism]], his claim that matter did not actually exist but only seemed to exist:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bate|1977|p=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; during a conversation with [[James Boswell|Boswell]], Johnson powerfully stomped a nearby stone and proclaimed of Berkeley's theory, "I refute it ''thus''!"&lt;ref name="Boswell p. 122"/&gt;

Both Perry's concept and the term he used influenced American philosopher, [[Everett W. Hall]] to create the solecism "the categorio-centric predicament" to express the impossibility of seeing the world outside the "categories" imposed by one's native language and conceptual scheme.

{{quote box|quoted=yes|width=25em|quote=After we came out of the church, we stood talking for some time together of Bishop Berkeley's ingenious sophistry to prove the non-existence of matter, and that every thing in the universe is merely ideal. I observed, that though we are satisfied his doctrine is not true, it is impossible to refute it. I never shall forget the alacrity with which Johnson answered, striking his foot with mighty force against a large stone, till he rebounded from it, 'I refute it ''thus''.'&lt;ref name="Boswell p. 122"&gt;{{Harvnb|Boswell|1986|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;|source=Boswell's ''Life of Samuel Johnson''}}

== Philosophy ==
One of Sober's main fields of research has been the subject of simplicity or [[Occam's razor|parsimony]] in connection with theory evaluation in science.  Sober also has been interested in altruism, both as the concept is used in evolutionary biology and also as it is used in connection with human psychology.  His book with David Sloan Wilson, ''Unto Others: the Evolution and Psychology of Unselfish Behavior'' (1998), addresses both topics.

Sober has been a prominent critic of [[intelligent design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Intelligent Design and Probability Reasoning|journal = International Journal for Philosophy of Religion|date = 2002-01-01|pages = 65–80|volume = 52|issue = 2|first = Elliott|last = Sober|jstor=40036455|doi=10.1023/a:1019579220694}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Blackwell Guide to Philosophy of Religion|last = Mann|first = William|publisher = Blackwell Publishing|year = 2004|isbn = 978-0-631-22128-9|location = Malden|pages = 117–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = What Is Wrong With Intelligent Design?|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6452178_What_is_wrong_with_intelligent_design|journal = The Quarterly Review of Biology|pages = 3–8|volume = 82|issue = 1|doi = 10.1086/511656|first = Elliott|last = Sober|pmid=17354991|date=March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also has written about evidence and probability,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = EPSA Philosophy of Science: Amsterdam 2009 {{!}} Henk W. de Regt {{!}} Springer|url = https://www.springer.com/us/book/9789400724037#|website = www.springer.com|access-date = 2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; scientific realism and instrumentalism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Instrumentalism, Parsimony, and the Akaike Framework|url = http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/341839|journal = Philosophy of Science|date = 2002-09-01|issn = 0031-8248|pages = S112–S123|volume = 69|issue = S3|doi = 10.1086/341839|first = Elliott|last = Sober}}&lt;/ref&gt; laws of nature,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Priori Causal Models of Natural Selection|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00048402.2010.535006|journal = Australasian Journal of Philosophy|date = 2011-12-01|issn = 0004-8402|pages = 571–589|volume = 89|issue = 4|doi = 10.1080/00048402.2010.535006|first = Elliott|last = Sober}}&lt;/ref&gt; the mind-body problem&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%253A1004519608950|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%253A1004519608950|doi = 10.1023/a:1004519608950 | volume=95|journal=Philosophical Studies|pages=135–174}}&lt;/ref&gt; and naturalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Oxford Studies in Philosophy of Religion|last = Kvanvig|first = Jonathan|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0199603220|location = New York|pages = 187–221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philosophy of biology ===
Sober's ''The Nature of Selection: Evolutionary Theory in Philosophical Focus'' (1984) has been instrumental in establishing the philosophy of biology as a prominent research area in philosophy. According to the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], "''The Nature of Selection''...marks the point at which most philosophers became aware of the philosophy of biology."&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/biology-philosophy/&lt;/ref&gt; In his review of the book, biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] wrote "Sober has ... given us what is perhaps the most careful and penetrating analysis of the concept of natural selection as it affects the process of evolution".&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst. ''Paleobiology'', Vol. 12, No. 2 (Spring, 1986), pp. 233–239&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parsimony ===
Sober's first publication on parsimony was his 1975 book, ''Simplicity''. In it, he argued that the simplicity of a hypothesis should be understood in terms of a concept of question-relative informativeness. Sober abandoned this theory in the 1980s when he started to think about the concept of [[cladistic parsimony]] used in evolutionary biology. This led him to think of parsimony in terms of the concept of likelihood, an idea he developed in his 1988 book ''Reconstructing the Past: Parsimony, Evolution, and Inference''. In the 1990s he started to think about the role of parsimony in model selection theory—for example, in the [[Akaike information criterion|Akaike Information Criterion]]. He published a series of articles in this area with Malcolm Forster, the first of which was their 1994 paper "How to Tell When Simpler, More Unified, or Less Ad Hoc Theories Will Provide More Accurate Predictions." His most recent publication on parsimony, his 2015 book ''Ockham's Razors: A User's Manual'', describes both the likelihood framework and the model selection frameworks as two viable "parsimony paradigms."

==Definition==

[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] originated this term,&lt;ref&gt;Claude Lévi-Strauss, "Introduction à l'oeuvre de Marcel Mauss" in ''Mauss, Sociologie et Anthropologie'', Paris, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; where he identifies terms like ''[[mana]]'' (magical mystical substance of which the magic is formed), or ''oomph'' (American slang term for flavor in the figurative sense)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/oomph | title= ''Oomph'' definition | publisher= Thefreedictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; "to represent an undetermined quantity of signification, in itself void of meaning and thus apt to receive any meaning".  Daniel Chandler defines the term as "a signifier with a vague, highly variable, unspecifiable or non-existent signified".&lt;ref name=Chandler&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/S4B/sem02a.html | last= Chandler | first= Daniel | title= Semiotics for Beginners | publisher= aber.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such a "floating signifier" may "mean different things to different people: they may stand for many or even any signifieds; they may mean whatever their interpreters want them to mean". Such a floating signifier—which is said to possess "symbolic value zero"—necessarily results to "allow symbolic thought to operate despite the contradiction inherent in it".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Mehlman, ''The "Floating Signifier": From Lévi-Strauss to Lacan'', Yale French Studies, No. 48, '''French Freud: Structural Studies in Psychoanalysis'''. (1972), pp. 10–37.&lt;/ref&gt; In Emancipation(s), Ernesto Laclau frames empty signifier a context of social interactions. For Laclau, empty signifier is the hegemonic representative of a collection of various demands, constituting a chain of equivalence whose members are distinguished through a differential logic (as in elements exist only in their differences to one another) but combine through an equivalential one. This chain of unsatisfied demands create an unfulfilled totality, inside of which one signifier subordinates the rest and assumes representation of the rest via a hegemonic process.

==Uses and examples==

The notion of floating signifiers can be applied to concepts such as [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://caffeinesparks.blogspot.com/2007/08/race-floating-signifier.html | title= Race: a Floating Signifier? Stuart Hall speech | publisher= caffeine_sparks}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gender]], as a way of asserting that the word is more concrete than the concept it describes, where the concept may not be stable, but the word is. It is often applied to [[Meaning (non-linguistic)|non-linguistic signs]], such as the example of the [[Rorschach inkblot test]]. [[Roland Barthes]], while not using the term "floating signifier" explicitly, referred specifically to non-linguistic signs as being so open to interpretation that they constituted a "floating chain of signifieds."&lt;ref name=Chandler/&gt; For example, the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] is at once a signifier of the geographical nation it represents, of patriotism to that nation, of the nation's set of governmental policies, and/or of the ideologies associated with it, such as [[liberty]]. Depending on the context, the flag can carry either positive ''or'' negative significance.

The concept is used in some more textual forms of [[postmodernism]], which rejects the strict anchoring of particular signifiers to particular signifieds and argues against the concept that there are any ultimate determinable meanings to words or signs. For example, [[Jacques Derrida]] speaks of the "freeplay" of signifiers: arguing that they are not fixed to their signifieds but point beyond themselves to other signifiers in an "indefinite referral of signifier to signified."&lt;ref name=Chandler/&gt;

[[Image:Germ-band extension.png|thumb|550px|alt=germ-band extension.|Schematic of ''Drosophila'' embryo at the start of germ-band elongation and 30 minutes later.  The germ-band (grey) is posterior to the cephalic furrow (curved-line) and folds dorsally (red arrow) upon cell intercalation.  Each rectangle represents a field of cells before (0 min) and after (30 min) convergent extension.  Colored nuclei arbitrarily mark rows of cells in order to visualize tissue morphogenesis.]]

'''Germ-band extension''' is a [[morphogenesis|morphological]] process widely studied in ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' in which the [[germ layer|germ-band]], which develops into the segmented trunk of the embryo, approximately doubles in length along the [[anterior|anterior-posterior]] axis while subsequently narrowing along the dorsal-ventral axis.&lt;ref name="wie94"&gt;Irvine, K., and Wieschaus, E. (1994). Cell intercalation during Drosophila germ-band extension and its regulation by pair-rule segmentation genes. Development 120, 827–841.&lt;/ref&gt;

Germ-band extension begins shortly after [[gastrulation]] and is divided into two phases.  The fast phase, in which most of the extension occurs, takes about 25 minutes. The remaining extension continues during the slow phase and is completed in the following 70 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;da Silva, S. M. &amp; Vincent, J. P. (2007). Oriented cell divisions in the extending germband of Drosophila. Development 134, 3049–3054.&lt;/ref&gt;  During this process the ventral germ-band extends around the posterior end of the embryo, effectively folding over onto the dorsal side of the egg. Multiple individual cells intercalating mediolateral to the anterior-posterior axis drive the resulting global elongation of the embryo. In addition, cell shape changes, and oriented cell divisions in the posterior germ-band are in part required for full elongation.&lt;ref name="Butler, L.C. 2009"&gt;Butler, L.C., et al. (2009). Cell shape changes indicate a role for extrinsic tensile forces in Drosophila germ-band extension. Nature Cell Biology 11, 859-864.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, elongation of the body axis seems to be primarily linked to changes in cell neighbor relations.

This article describes axis elongation in ''Drosophila''.   However, the basis of germ-band elongation is applicable to many organisms including other [[invertebrates]] and [[vertebrates]] alike.&lt;ref&gt;Keller, R. (2006). Mechanisms of elongation in embryogenesis. Development 133, 2291–2302.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cellular basis==
[[Image:T1Junction.png|thumb|550px|alt=T1 Junction Exchange.|Schematic of neighbor exchange or an elementary T1 process involving four cells.  T1-magenta cells are in direct contact.  T2-all cells share a common vertex. T3-resolution results in green cells sharing a common boundary.]]

In order for cells to intercalate between one another the [[adherens junctions]] that maintain the integrity of the [[epithelial]] tissue must be dynamically remodeled. [[Time-lapse microscopy]] has captured this process of cell neighbor exchange, which is schematically represented to the right. In the type 1 configuration, two cells contact each other along the anterior-posterior axis, whereas two dorsal-ventral cells do not directly contact. Next, the cell boundary between the two anterior-posterior neighbors selectively shrinks, resulting in an obligatory intermediate type 2 junction, where the four cells share a vertex. Upon resolution of the type 2 junction, a new type 3 junctions forms perpendicular to the original type 1 configuration. During this process the two dorsal-ventral cells have become neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;Bertet, C., Sulak, L. &amp; Lecuit, T. (2004). Myosin-dependent junction remodelling controls planar cell intercalation and axis elongation. Nature 429, 667–671.&lt;/ref&gt; When multiple clusters of cells intercalate in the dorsal-ventral axis, through junctional neighbor exchange, the outcome is an extension of germ-band in the anterior-posterior axis.

In addition to the simple neighbor exchange, higher-ordered rosette formations have been observed in which five or more cells meet at a vertex. Multicellular rosettes form and resolve in a directional fashion that promotes germ-band elongation.&lt;ref&gt;Blankenship, J. T., Backovic, S. T., Sanny, J. S., Weitz, O. and Zallen, J. A. (2006). Multicellular rosette formation links planar cell polarity to tissue morphogenesis. Dev. Cell 11, 459-470.&lt;/ref&gt; Neighbor exchange and multicellular rosette formation involve oriented junctional remodeling, which indicates that the intercalating cells are intrinsically polarized within the plane of the epithelium.

==Molecular basis==
[[Image:planarpolarity.png|thumb|450px|alt=Planar Polarity.|Asymmetric localization of proteins to reciprocal cell borders in the apical plane of a polarized epithelial.]]

The dorsal-ventral intercalation of cells during germ-band extension ultimately arises from the asymmetric localization of proteins within individual cells. [[Immunofluorescence]] reveals that non-muscle [[Myosin II]] localizes to the anterior-posterior boundaries of cells, destabilizing adherens junctions, whereas the Bazooka/Par-3 complex localizes to dorsal-ventral boundaries, stabilizing adherens junctions. Moreover, ''bazooka'' mutants are defective in germ-band extension, which supports the idea that polarized protein localization is critical for cell rearrangements.&lt;ref name="wie04"&gt;Zallen, J., and Wieschaus, E. (2004). Patterned gene expression directs bipolar planar polarity in Drosophila. Dev. Cell 6, 343–355.&lt;/ref&gt; One mechanism by which Myosin II might promote polarized cell remodeling is through contractile activity that creates tension orienting junctional disassembly.&lt;ref&gt;Baum  B. (2004). Animal development: crowd control. Curr Biol. 7;14, 716-718.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the precise mechanism in which asymmetrically localized protein complexes encourage directed intercalation remains disputed.

The source that establishes planar polarity during germ-band extension remains elusive. Polarized intercalation is largely unaffected in mutant embryos that lack dorsal-ventral cell types. Yet, mutations that disrupt segmental patterning along the anterior-posterior axis, such as ''[[pair-rule gene|eve]]'' and ''[[pair-rule gene|runt]]'', decrease cell intercalation and subsequent germ-band elongation.&lt;ref name="wie94"/&gt; Furthermore, [[ectopic expression]] of eve or runt is sufficient to locally reorient the polarity of nearby cells. This evidence argues that planar polarity is established by cell-cell interactions, and not by a [[morphogen|long-range polarizing cue]]. Thus, polarizing information can spread from one cell to the next, downstream of an Eve-dependent signal that remains to be identified.&lt;ref name="wie04"/&gt;

==Tensile forces==
Researchers suggest that [[mesoderm]] [[invagination]] provides an anterior-posterior pulling force that contributes to germ-band extension through passive cell shape changes. Although anterior-posterior patterning mutants fail to fully extend their germ-bands, during the fast phase the elongation length is normal despite defects in polarized cell intercalation. Time-lapse analysis revealed that an increase in cell shape stretching in the anterior-posterior axis was compensating for aberrant cell intercalation, independent of anterior-posterior patterning. Furthermore, during [[wild type]] development, it has been suggested that intercalary cell behavior relaxes the stress imposed on the germ-band, allowing stretched cells to restore to isometric shapes.&lt;ref name="Butler, L.C. 2009"/&gt;

In addition, there is evidence that mechanical tension is necessary and sufficient for the cortical localization of Myosin II. Thus, not only can Myosin II generate tension but it may also be up-regulated by tensile forces, creating a [[positive feedback]] loop that allows cells to dynamically respond to fluctuations in their mechanical environment.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez-Gonzalez R, Simoes Sde M, Röper JC, Eaton S, Zallen JA. (2009). Myosin II dynamics are regulated by tension in intercalating cells. Dev Cell. 17, 736–743.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3508">In [[esoteric]] and [[occult]] teachings, '''giants''' are beings who live on [[spiritual (spiritual plane)|spiritual]], [[etheric (etheric plane)|etheric]] and [[physical (physical plane)|physical]] [[planes of existence]]. Giants were a popular theme in [[Theosophy (disambiguation)|theosophical]] [[literature]], [[Atlantis]], [[lost continents]] and later the [[earth mysteries]] movement of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} 

==History==
The concept of giants was discussed by the [[theosophist]] and [[occult]] author [[Blavatsky]] who wrote about the existence of giants in her book ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' connecting them to her theory of [[root races]] and claiming they correspond with [[Hindu cycle of the universe]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}  According to theosophists, ape-like giants were the third [[root race]] who lived on the continent of [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Gardner, Fads and fallacies in the name of science, 1957, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophists also linked giants to the Atlantean race.

The [[Germans|German]] [[occultist]] [[Guido von List]] was influenced by Blavatsky's writings on giants and mixed together [[paganism]], [[mythology]], and theosophy, creating a basis for the belief in giants living in different realms based on the first four rounds of the root race theory.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, Occult Roots of Nazism: Secret Aryan Cults and Their Influence on Nazi Ideology, 1993, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz]], an [[Egyptologist]] and [[tradition]]alist, believed that giants had roamed the [[earth]], and that after the fall of [[Adam]], humanity fell into a state of degeneration.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Lachman, Politics and the Occult: The Left, the Right, and the Radically Unseen, 2008, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lewis Spence]], a writer on mythology, was critical of theosophy but accepted the existence of giants. He researched [[English folklore]] and mythology depicting such giants such as [[Gog and Magog|Magog]] and the British giant [[Albion]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Spence, 1976, The Occult Sciences in Atlantis, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Another writer who was opposed to occultism was the British [[journalist]] and author [[William Comyns Beaumont]]. Like Spence, he accepted the existence of giants based on folklore, mythology, and [[archeology]]. Beaumont believed that [[United Kingdom|Britain]] was the location of [[Atlantis]] and that it was occupied by a giant race of [[Aryan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IZNKVA1JcWwC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=comyns+beaumont+giants&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rlr3TcGTBpOctwejoeS_Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEUQuwUwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Karl Shaw, Curing Hiccups with Small Fires: A Delightful Miscellany of Great British Eccentrics]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1970s many of the authors of the [[earth mysteries]] movement in Britain wrote about Giants. [[John Michell (writer)|John Michell]] wrote about the existence of giants in his book ''The View over Atlantis''. Anthony Roberts wrote the book ''Sowers of Thunder: Giants in Myth and History'' in 1978, in which he claimed that giants were the original inhabitants of the  [[British Isles]] and linked [[Alfred Watkins]]' [[ley lines]] to the British giants.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Chippindale, Stonehenge complete, Cornell University Press, 1983, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

One of the first theories of health behavior,&lt;ref name="Glanz 2010" /&gt; the health belief model was developed in the 1950s by social psychologists Irwin M. Rosenstock, Godfrey M. Hochbaum, S. Stephen Kegeles, and Howard Leventhal at the [[U.S. Public Health Service]] to better understand the widespread failure of screening programs for [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name="Meta-Analysis 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carpenter|first=Christopher J.|title=A meta-analysis of the effectiveness of health belief model variables in predicting behavior|journal=Health Communication|year=2010|volume=25|issue=8|pages=661–669|doi=10.1080/10410236.2010.521906|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2010.521906}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="K.

Glanz 2008 book" /&gt; and behaviors related to chronic illnesses,&lt;ref name="HBM Decade Later" /&gt; which may require long-term behavior maintenance in addition to initial behavior change.&lt;ref name="HBM Decade Later" /&gt; Amendments to the model were made as late as 1988 to incorporate emerging evidence within the field of psychology about the role of [[self-efficacy]] in decision-making and behavior.&lt;ref name="Glanz 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="K. Glanz 2008 book" /&gt;

==Theoretical constructs==

The following constructs of the health belief model are proposed to vary between individuals and predict engagement in health-related behaviors (e.g., getting vaccinated, getting screened for asymptomatic diseases, exercising).&lt;ref name="HBM Decade Later" /&gt;

===Perceived severity===

Perceived severity refers to the subjective assessment of the severity of a health problem and its potential consequences.&lt;ref name="HBM Decade Later" /&gt;&lt;ref name="K. Glanz 2008 book" /&gt; The health belief model proposes that individuals who perceive a given health problem as serious are more likely to engage in behaviors to prevent the health problem from occurring (or reduce its severity). Perceived seriousness encompasses beliefs about the disease itself (e.g., whether it is life-threatening or may cause disability or pain) as well as broader impacts of the disease on functioning in work and social roles.&lt;ref name="HBM Decade Later" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Origins of HBM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="K. Glanz 2008 book" /&gt; For instance, an individual may perceive that [[influenza]] is not medically serious, but if he or she perceives that there would be serious financial consequences as a result of being absent from work for several days, then he or she may perceive [[influenza]] to be a particularly serious condition.

===Perceived susceptibility===

Perceived susceptibility refers to subjective assessment of risk of developing a health problem.&lt;ref name="HBM Decade Later" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Origins of HBM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="K. Glanz 2008 book" /&gt; The health belief model predicts that individuals who perceive that they are susceptible to a particular health problem will engage in behaviors to reduce their risk of developing the health problem.&lt;ref name="Origins of HBM" /&gt; Individuals with low perceived susceptibility may deny that they are at risk for contracting a particular illness.&lt;ref name="Origins of HBM" /&gt; Others may acknowledge the possibility that they could develop the illness, but believe it is unlikely.&lt;ref name="Origins of HBM" /&gt; Individuals who believe they are at low risk of developing an illness are more likely to engage in unhealthy, or risky, behaviors. Individuals who perceive a high risk that they will be personally affected by a particular health problem are more likely to engage in behaviors to decrease their risk of developing the condition.

The combination of perceived severity and perceived susceptibility is referred to as perceived threat.&lt;ref name="K. Glanz 2008 book" /&gt; Perceived severity and perceived susceptibility to a given health condition depend on knowledge about the condition.&lt;ref name="Origins of HBM" /&gt; The health belief model predicts that higher perceived threat leads to higher likelihood of engagement in health-promoting behaviors.

===Perceived benefits===

Health-related behaviors are also influenced by the perceived benefits of taking action.&lt;ref name="K. Glanz 2008 book" /&gt; Perceived benefits refer to an individual's assessment of the value or efficacy of engaging in a health-promoting behavior to decrease risk of disease.&lt;ref name="HBM Decade Later" /&gt; If an individual believes that a particular action will reduce susceptibility to a health problem or decrease its seriousness, then he or she is likely to engage in that behavior regardless of objective facts regarding the effectiveness of the action.&lt;ref name="Origins of HBM" /&gt; For example, individuals who believe that wearing sunscreen prevents skin cancer are more likely to wear sunscreen than individuals who believe that wearing sunscreen will not prevent the occurrence of skin cancer.

===Perceived barriers===

Health-related behaviors are also a function of perceived barriers to taking action.&lt;ref name="K. Glanz 2008 book" /&gt; Perceived barriers refer to an individual's assessment of the obstacles to behavior change.&lt;ref name="HBM Decade Later" /&gt; Even if an individual perceives a health condition as threatening and believes that a particular action will effectively reduce the threat, barriers may prevent engagement in the health-promoting behavior. In other words, the perceived benefits must outweigh the perceived barriers in order for behavior change to occur.&lt;ref name="HBM Decade Later" /&gt;&lt;ref name="K. Glanz 2008 book" /&gt; Perceived barriers to taking action include the perceived inconvenience, expense, danger (e.g., side effects of a medical procedure) and discomfort (e.g., pain, emotional upset) involved in engaging in the behavior.&lt;ref name="Origins of HBM" /&gt; For instance, lack of access to affordable health care and the perception that a flu vaccine shot will cause significant pain may act as barriers to receiving the flu vaccine.

===Modifying variables===

Individual characteristics, including [[demographic]], [[psychosocial]], and structural variables, can affect perceptions (i.e., perceived seriousness, susceptibility, benefits, and barriers) of health-related behaviors.&lt;ref name="Origins of HBM" /&gt; Demographic variables include age, sex, race, ethnicity, and education, among others.&lt;ref name="Origins of HBM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="K. Glanz 2008 book" /&gt; Psychosocial variables include personality, social class, and peer and reference group pressure, among others.&lt;ref name="Origins of HBM" /&gt; Structural variables include knowledge about a given disease and prior contact with the disease, among other factors.&lt;ref name="Origins of HBM" /&gt; The health belief model suggests that modifying variables affect health-related behaviors indirectly by affecting perceived seriousness, susceptibility, benefits, and barriers.&lt;ref name="Origins of HBM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="K. Glanz 2008 book" /&gt;

===Cues to action===

The health belief model posits that a cue, or trigger, is necessary for prompting engagement in health-promoting behaviors.&lt;ref name="HBM Decade Later" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Origins of HBM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Meta-Analysis 2010" /&gt; Cues to action can be internal or external.&lt;ref name="HBM Decade Later" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Meta-Analysis 2010" /&gt; Physiological cues (e.g., pain, symptoms) are an example of internal cues to action.&lt;ref name="HBM Decade Later" /&gt;&lt;ref name="K. Glanz 2008 book" /&gt; External cues include events or information from close others,&lt;ref name="HBM Decade Later" /&gt; the media,&lt;ref name="Meta-Analysis 2010" /&gt; or health care providers&lt;ref name="HBM Decade Later" /&gt; promoting engagement in health-related behaviors. Examples of cues to action include a reminder postcard from a dentist, the illness of a friend or family member, and product health warning labels. The intensity of cues needed to prompt action varies between individuals by perceived susceptibility, seriousness, benefits, and barriers.&lt;ref name="Origins of HBM" /&gt; For example, individuals who believe they are at high risk for a serious illness and who have an established relationship with a primary care doctor may be easily persuaded to get screened for the illness after seeing a public service announcement, whereas individuals who believe they are at low risk for the same illness and also do not have reliable access to health care may require more intense external cues in order to get screened.

===Self-efficacy===

[[Self-efficacy]] was added to the four components of the health belief model (i.e., perceived susceptibility, severity, benefits, and barriers) in 1988.&lt;ref name="K. Glanz 2008 book" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Soc Learning Theory"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenstock|first=Irwin M.|author2=Strecher, Victor J. |author3=Becker, Marshall H. |title=Social learning theory and the health belief model|journal=Health Education &amp; Behavior|year=1988|volume=15|issue=2|pages=175–183|doi=10.1177/109019818801500203|url=http://heb.sagepub.com/content/15/2/175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-efficacy refers to an individual's perception of his or her competence to successfully perform a behavior.&lt;ref name="K. Glanz 2008 book" /&gt; Self-efficacy was added to the health belief model in an attempt to better explain individual differences in health behaviors.&lt;ref name="Soc Learning Theory" /&gt; The model was originally developed in order to explain engagement in one-time health-related behaviors such as being screened for cancer or receiving an immunization.&lt;ref name="Origins of HBM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Soc Learning Theory" /&gt; Eventually, the health belief model was applied to more substantial, long-term behavior change such as diet modification, exercise, and smoking.&lt;ref name="Soc Learning Theory" /&gt; Developers of the model recognized that confidence in one's ability to effect change in outcomes (i.e., self-efficacy) was a key component of health behavior change.&lt;ref name="K. Glanz 2008 book" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Soc Learning Theory" /&gt;

==Empirical support==

The health belief model has gained substantial empirical support since its development in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="HBM Decade Later" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Meta-Analysis 2010" /&gt; It remains one of the most widely used and well-tested models for explaining and predicting health-related behavior.&lt;ref name="Meta-Analysis 2010" /&gt; A 1984 review of 18 prospective and 28 retrospective studies suggests that the evidence for each component of the health belief model is strong.&lt;ref name="HBM Decade Later" /&gt; The review reports that empirical support for the health belief model is particularly notable given the diverse populations, health conditions, and health-related behaviors examined and the various study designs and assessment strategies used to evaluate the model.&lt;ref name="HBM Decade Later" /&gt; A more recent meta-analysis found strong support for perceived benefits and perceived barriers predicting health-related behaviors, but weak evidence for the predictive power of perceived seriousness and perceived susceptibility.&lt;ref name="Meta-Analysis 2010" /&gt; The authors of the meta-analysis suggest that examination of potential moderated and mediated relationships between components of the model is warranted.&lt;ref name="Meta-Analysis 2010" /&gt;

==Applications==

The health belief model has been used to develop effective interventions to change health-related behaviors by targeting various aspects of the model's key constructs.&lt;ref name="Meta-Analysis 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Soc Learning Theory" /&gt; Interventions based on the health belief model may aim to increase perceived susceptibility to and perceived seriousness of a health condition by providing education about prevalence and incidence of disease, individualized estimates of risk, and information about the consequences of disease (e.g., medical, financial, and social consequences).&lt;ref name="K. Glanz 2008 book" /&gt; Interventions may also aim to alter the cost-benefit analysis of engaging in a health-promoting behavior (i.e., increasing perceived benefits and decreasing perceived barriers) by providing information about the efficacy of various behaviors to reduce risk of disease, identifying common perceived barriers, providing incentives to engage in health-promoting behaviors, and engaging social support or other resources to encourage health-promoting behaviors.&lt;ref name="K. Glanz 2008 book" /&gt; Furthermore, interventions based on the health belief model may provide cues to action to remind and encourage individuals to engage in health-promoting behaviors.&lt;ref name="K. Glanz 2008 book" /&gt; Interventions may also aim to boost self-efficacy by providing training in specific health-promoting behaviors,&lt;ref name="K. Glanz 2008 book" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Soc Learning Theory" /&gt; particularly for complex lifestyle changes (e.g., changing diet or physical activity, adhering to a complicated medication regimen).&lt;ref name="Soc Learning Theory" /&gt; Interventions can be aimed at the individual level (i.e., working one-on-one with individuals to increase engagement in health-related behaviors) or the societal level (e.g., through legislation, changes to the physical environment).&lt;ref name="Stretcher book 1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stretcher|first=Victor J.|title=Cambridge handbook of psychology, health and medicine|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0521430739|pages=113–117|author2=Irwin M. Rosenstock|editor=Andrew Baum|chapter=The health belief model}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==

The health belief model attempts to predict health-related behaviors by accounting for individual differences in beliefs and attitudes.&lt;ref name="HBM Decade Later" /&gt; However, it does not account for other factors that influence health behaviors.&lt;ref name="HBM Decade Later" /&gt; For instance, habitual health-related behaviors (e.g., smoking, seatbelt buckling) may become relatively independent of conscious health-related decision making processes.&lt;ref name="HBM Decade Later" /&gt; Additionally, individuals engage in some health-related behaviors for reasons unrelated to health (e.g., exercising for aesthetic reasons).&lt;ref name="HBM Decade Later" /&gt; Environmental factors outside an individual's control may prevent engagement in desired behaviors.&lt;ref name="HBM Decade Later" /&gt; For example, an individual living in a dangerous neighborhood may be unable to go for a jog outdoors due to safety concerns. Furthermore, the health belief model does not consider the impact of emotions on health-related behavior.&lt;ref name="K. Glanz 2008 book" /&gt; Evidence suggests that fear may be a key factor in predicting health-related behavior.&lt;ref name="K. Glanz 2008 book" /&gt;

Alternative factors may predict health behavior, such as outcome expectancy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schwarzer|first=Ralf|date=April 2001|title=Social-Cognitive Factors in Changing Health-Related Behaviors|url=https://doi.org/10.1111%2F1467-8721.00112|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=10|issue=2|pages=47–51|via=|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00112}}&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e., whether the person feels they will be healthier as a result of their behavior) and self-efficacy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seyde|first=Erwin|last2=Taal|first2=Erik|last3=Wiegman|first3=Oene|date=1990|title=Risk-appraisal, outcome and self-efficacy expectancies: Cognitive factors in preventive behaviour related to cancer|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/08870449008408144|journal=Psychology &amp; Health|volume=4|issue=2|pages=99–109|via=|doi=10.1080/08870449008408144}}&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e., the person’s belief in their ability to carry out preventative behavior).

The theoretical constructs that constitute the health belief model are broadly defined.&lt;ref name="Meta-Analysis 2010" /&gt; Furthermore, the health belief model does not specify how constructs of the model interact with one another.&lt;ref name="Meta-Analysis 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="K. Glanz 2008 book" /&gt; Therefore, different operationalizations of the theoretical constructs may not be strictly comparable across studies.&lt;ref name="K. Glanz 2008 book" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scales for HBM"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maiman|first=Lois A. |author2=Marshall H. Becker |author3=John P. Kirscht |author4=Don P. Haefner |author5=Robert H. Drachman|title=Scales for Measuring Health Belief Model Dimensions: A Test of Predictive Value, Internal Consistency, and Relationships Among Beliefs|journal=Health Education &amp; Behavior|year=1977|volume=5|pages=215–230|doi=10.1177/109019817700500303|url=http://heb.sagepub.com/content/5/3/215.full.pdf+html|accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research assessing the contribution of cues to action in predicting health-related behaviors is limited.&lt;ref name="HBM Decade Later" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Origins of HBM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Meta-Analysis 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="K. Glanz 2008 book" /&gt; Cues to action are often difficult to assess, limiting research in this area.&lt;ref name="Origins of HBM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="K. Glanz 2008 book" /&gt; For instance, individuals may not accurately report cues that prompted behavior change.&lt;ref name="Origins of HBM" /&gt; Cues such as a public service announcement on television or on a billboard may be fleeting and individuals may not be aware of their significance in prompting them to engage in a health-related behavior.&lt;ref name="Origins of HBM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="K. Glanz 2008 book" /&gt; Interpersonal influences are also particularly difficult to measure as cues.&lt;ref name="Origins of HBM" /&gt;

'''Heather Marsh''' is a philosopher, programmer and [[human rights]] activist. She is the author of Binding Chaos, a study of methods of [[mass collaboration]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.opednews.com/articles/Binding-Chaos-Meditations-by-Burl-Hall-Activist_Education_Fear_Internet-140114-349.html|author=Burl Hall|title=Article: Binding Chaos: Meditations on the Work of Heather Marsh|work=OpEdNews}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roarmag.org/2013/12/heather-marsh-binding-chaos-review/|title='Binding Chaos': a compassionate vision for a future society - ROAR Magazine|work=roarmag.org|date=December 12, 2013|accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the founder of Getgee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getgee.xyz/|title=Getgee Universal Database|website=www.getgee.xyz|accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a project to create a global data commons and trust network.

She gives talks about mass collaboration, democracy, economy and other societal issues. She has spoken about Getgee and the need for a global data commons at various software conferences. She gave a keynote speech on approval economy at the Alternate G8 summit in 2013. She was invited to the 2012 [[Berlin Biennale]] as part of their Occupy art exhibition. She represented the Berlin Biennale hackathon at the World Free Media Forum in Rio in June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/georgiebc/berlin-radio-2012-05-29|title=Berlin radio 2012-05-29 talking about Global Square|work=SoundCloud|date=May 29, 2015|accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a journalist, she has written many freelance articles and from 2010 to 2012 she was the sole editor and administrator for the Wikileaks sponsored news site, Wikileaks Central. As an activist, she has started many very successful human rights campaigns. As a philosopher, she has given many interviews to media and academics, written books and essays and given talks in many countries. In 2018 she was invited to speak at the Oxford Union, which claims to be "the world’s most prestigious debating society" and "the last bastion of free speech". The video of her talk was censored on order from a former CIA operative and director of the US DIA.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailypublic.com/articles/05312018/irony-oxford-union-wont-release-video-whistleblowing-panel&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet and Journalism==
Since 2015 she has been working to initiate a global data commons project with Getgee, a universal database and trust network. Getgee seeks to allow global collaboration on research and information without control by a specific platform. This is a continuation of her earlier viral project called the Global Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/fivelive/pods/pods_20120221-0400a.mp3|title=Outriders|last=Knowles|first=Jamillah|date=February 22, 2012|publisher=BBC|accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/yourcommunity/2011/12/would-you-join-a-facebook-style-occupy-social-network.html|title=Would you join a Facebook-style Occupy social network?|date=December 28, 2011|website=[[CBC.ca]]|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20111229004256/http://www.cbc.ca/news/yourcommunity/2011/12/would-you-join-a-facebook-style-occupy-social-network.html|archivedate=December 29, 2011|accessdate=December 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.complex.com/tech/2011/12/occupy-protestors-building-activist-only-facebook|title='Occupy' Protestors Building Activist-Only Facebook|last=Chanda|first=Devin|date=December 29, 2011|newspaper=Complex Tech|accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://massimo.in.ua/?p=1213|script-title=ru:Cоциальная сеть "The Global Square" от движения "Occupy Wall Street"|trans-title=The social network "The Global Square" from the movement "Occupy Wall Street"|language=ru|date=December 29, 2011|newspaper=Massimo|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20130605150449/http://massimo.in.ua/?p=1213|archivedate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/1862178|title=Сеть оккупантам|date=February 6, 2012|newspaper=Коммерсантъ (Citizen K)|language=ru|accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a continuation of years of writing about mass communication including open journalism and scientific and academic research.

Her own journalism has covered investigations of leaked material and individual human rights cases as well as breaking coverage of global events. In one unpublished interview with Guantanamo defence attorney [[Dennis Edney]], the two discuss blackmail attempts of witnesses by the FBI and the possibility that [[Omar Khadr]]'s plea deal was signed without legal counsel. The interview was subsequently leaked to Cryptome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/2013/11/02/how-canada-has-hidden-the-truth-about-omar-khadr-us-war-crimes-institutional-racism-and-media-failures/|title=How Canada Has Hidden the Truth About Omar Khadr: US War Crimes, Institutional Racism and Media Failures|date=February 11, 2013|accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interview discusses the delaying of publication until after Edney returns from Guantanamo; when he returned from Guantanamo he was fired from the case and forbidden to speak of it.

As both a journalist and a media critic, she has often combined the two in articles such as [[The Guardian]]: Redacting, Censoring or Lying?, (the topic of an interview between Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger and Julian Assange in the documentary [[Mediastan]]), [[Toronto Star]] Coverage of Omar Khadr since his trial week&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgiebc.wordpress.com/2012/07/20/toronto-star-coverage-of-omar-khadr-since-his-trial-week-oct-25-2010/|author=Heather Marsh|title=Toronto Star coverage of Omar Khadr since his trial week (Oct 25, 2010)|work=GeorgieBC's Blog|publisher=[[WordPress]]|date=July 20, 2012|accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Zimbabwe election, [[Reuters]] and the troll who accidentally won the Internet.

==Human rights==
She has advocated for both transparency for actions and organizations that affect the public and privacy for individuals. She is against control and ownership of knowledge by copyrights and patents but writes "Privacy and ownership of personal stories are closely related to human dignity" and credit (although not ownership) for ideas and intellectual labour is essential in an approval economy.She has been active in freedom of information, anti-poverty, justice related cases and all forms of 'human dignity' as well as advocating for individual rights ahead of all systems of governance. She has been associated with Guantanamo activism, primarily for Canadian POW Omar Khadr, and [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] activity, particularly human rights issues.&lt;ref name="globalpost.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/the-grid/myanmar-anonymous-rallies-around-rohingya-prepares-june-operation|author=Jeb Boone|title=Myanmar: Anonymous rallies around Rohingya, prepares for online operation|work=GlobalPost|date=May 6, 2013|accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/society/anonymous-oprohingya-burma-myanmar-twitter/|title=How Anonymous gamed Twitter to shed light on a hidden massacre|work=The Daily Dot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailydot.com/politics/anonymous-opgabon-bongo-murder-africa/|author=Lorraine Murphy|title=Anonymous challenges crisis in West Africa with OpGabon|work=The Daily Dot|date=December 11, 2015|accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/the-grid/opgabon-anonymous-attacks-gabon-government-protest-ritual-killings|author=Jeb Boone|title=OpGabon: Anonymous attacks Gabon government sites in protest of ritual killings|work=GlobalPost|date=April 16, 2013|accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has reported and campaigned extensively against human trafficking and violations committed by global resource corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavaca.org/mu/mu-83-podemos/|title=Mu 83: Podemos|work=Lavaca|date=December 18, 2014|accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has written extensively on her activism including investigative reports and interviews on Canadian juvenile Omar Khadr, one of the youngest prisoners of Guantanamo Bay. Her popular blog is well-received globally. She is the national spokesperson for the Free Omar Khadr group in Canada, spending her time writing, speaking, advocating for Omar's release. One of her most recent interviews were published in ''The Diplomat'' related to her work about Omar Khadr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thediplomat.com/the-pulse/2013/06/03/freeing-omar-khadr-an-interview-with-guantanamo-bay-activists/|title=Freeing Omar Khadr: An Interview with Guantanamo Bay Activists|author=Sonya Rehman, The Diplomat|work=The Diplomat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She wrote the first English media articles about [[Abdulelah Haider Shaye]], a Yemeni journalist ordered imprisoned by Obama, a year and a half before any report appeared in the US. She brought global awareness to topics such as the Rohingya genocide in Burma&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/the-rohingya-movement-as-seen-by-a-journalist-in-burmahttps://venturebeat.com/2013/03/25/anonymous-puts-plight-of-rohingya-people-in-twitter-spotlight/|title=VICE - United States - The Definitive Guide to Enlightening Information|work=VICE}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ritual killings in Gabon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailydot.com/news/anonymous-op-gabon-returns/|author=Lorraine Murphy|title=Anonymous' OpGabon returns ahead of Gabon's municipal elections|work=The Daily Dot|date=November 29, 2013|accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began a research project to map connections between the people behind resource corporations, militias, spies and prisons in response to a fracking protest in New Brunswick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/the-grid/opfrackoff-anonymous-canada-Elsipogtog-anti-fracking-protest|title=OpFrackOff: Anonymous pledges support to Canada anti-fracking protesters|work=GlobalPost}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became opCanary which seeks to form alliances between local groups fighting the same multinational resource corporations. She started the OpDeathEaters campaign to inform the public of high level complicity in the human trafficking and 'paedosadism' industries with a goal of independent inquiries to investigate and a change in public discourse around these crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/behind-anonymouss-operation-to-reveal-britains-elite-child-rape-syndicate-273|author=Patrick McGuire|title=Behind Anonymous's Operation to Reveal Britain's Elite Child-Rape Syndicate|work=VICE|date=January 15, 2015|accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11363303/Anonymous-hackers-turn-fire-on-global-paedophile-menace.html|title=Anonymous hackers turn fire on global paedophile menace|date=January 23, 2015|website=[[Telegraph.co.uk]]|accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her opGabon and opDeatheaters campaigns were the subject of a book, [[Crime, Justice and Social Media]] by Australian criminologist Michael Salter which asked "How is social media changing contemporary understandings of crime and injustice, and what contribution can it make to justice-seeking?" and featured extensive interviews with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Crime_Justice_and_Social_Media.html?id=iUHSsgEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Crime, Justice and Social Media|author=Michael Salter|date=October 12, 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781138919679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She started Gaza Rebirth, "a new paradigm for recovery activism" to establish direct aid to Gaza in 2014 and "to start a dialogue about this cycle of destruction and 'rebuilding' where corporate empires are feeding off real human torment as a growth industry to enrich themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecryptosphere.com/2014/10/20/an-interview-with-gazarebirth-a-new-paradigm-for-recovery-activism/|title=An interview with #GazaRebirth: a New Paradigm for Recovery Activism|work=The Cryptosphere|date=October 20, 2014|accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has frequently called for the decentralization of NGOs which she considers part of the "systems of dissociation" which stand between people and prevent creation of healthy society.

==WikiLeaks, Anonymous, Occupy and more==
In 2010 she became administrator, editor in chief and domain holder for the Wikileaks sponsored news site Wikileaks Central, "a global news site which was requested, announced, promoted, endorsed and hosted by Wikileaks but run autonomously and separately" by Marsh.&lt;ref&gt;https://georgiebc.wordpress.com/2018/04/07/democracy-vs-cambridge-analytica-and-facebook/&lt;/ref&gt; As editor/administrator of WL Central, she created a community for 70+ activists around the world to provide a new hard news organization, covering only "the news people require in order to govern themselves".''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wlcentral.org/q-a|title=Contact|publisher=WL Central|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20101123105353/http://wlcentral.org/q-a|archivedate=November 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''She used WL Central to tie Wikileaks releases to current events and advocate for social change under the slogan "News, analysis, action." The Action section contained protest calendars, petitions, and information for activists. The site published in 16 languages and protests were listed for over one hundred countries.

WL Central rapidly became an internationally very widely read news site, broke several important stories such as the secret CIA prisons in Poland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wlcentral.org/category/content-topics/cia-prison-poland|title=CIA prison in Poland|work=wlcentral.org|accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provided the most in depth coverage of many uprisings. Influential net critic Geert Lovink called WL Central the fourth website he visits every day: "WL Central turned into an alternative news aggregator and a kind of alternative CNN a.k.a. follow-up of Indymedia in the good old days of 2000-2001. it's gone down a bit but still can up with amazing stories from its own correspondents. WL Central shows what the Web is capable of doing beyond the 140 characters of Twitter and the informal chit-chat on Facebook."

She resigned as editor in chief, administrator and domain holder of Wikileaks Central on March 8, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikileaks.theblogger.com.au/2012/03/08/to-whom-it-may-concern/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022134047/http://wikileaks.theblogger.com.au/2012/03/08/to-whom-it-may-concern/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=October 22, 2015|title=To Whom It May Concern|last=Marsh|first=Heather|publisher=WL Central|accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She used the media attention on Wikileaks from 2010 to 2012 to shine light on human rights and transparency issues and support activist movements around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wlcentral.org/node/2312|title=2011-10-25 Thoughts on revolution from Take the Square, WL Central and a member of US Day of Rage (AUDIO)|publisher=WL Central|accessdate=October 25, 2011|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20111026233141/http://wlcentral.org/node/2312|archivedate=October 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of those groups were the South Korean [[Hope Riders]], the North African [[Arab Spring|Day of Rage]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, the Chinese [[Jasmine revolution china|Jasmine revolution]], the Spanish [[Indignados]]/Take the Square/15M movement and the [[Occupy Wall Street|Occupy]] movement.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/building-on-wikileaks-20111028-1mo38.html|title=Building on WikiLeaks|last=Dorling|first=Philip|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=October 29, 2011|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20111029141515/http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/building-on-wikileaks-20111028-1mo38.html|archivedate=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' She wrote the first article referencing what became the US Occupy movement on the day it started, March 10, 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wlcentral.org/node/1454|title=@USDayofRage is on facebook #USDOR|author=GeorgieBC|publisher=WL Central|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20110314164538/http://wlcentral.org/node/1454|archivedate=March 14, 2011|accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and covered many other day of rages within hours of their beginnings. A Canadian activist, she created Take the Square Canada in association with the Spanish movement.

She has received frequent international support from Anonymous for her human rights campaigns since 2010 and she calls them "old friends".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11363303/Anonymous-hackers-turn-fire-on-global-paedophile-menace.html|author=Peter Foster|title=Anonymous hackers turn fire on global paedophile menace|website=Telegraph.co.uk|date=January 23, 2015|accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hackread.com/opdeatheaters-anonymous-gearing-up-to-expose-pedophile/|title=OpDeathEaters: Anonymous Gearing up to Expose Global Pedophile Networks|date=January 25, 2015|work=HackRead|accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has referenced them as a method of collaboration, not a movement or group, and says the method they use is stigmergy. She says Anonymous follows ideas and actions instead of personalities, a form of organization she recommends for mass movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|work=Medialab-Prado|publisher=[[YouTube]]|title=Inteligencia Colectiva para la Democracia.

'''Henry Hodgkin''' (1877-1933) was a [[medical doctor]] and a British [[Quaker]] [[missionary]] who, in the course of his 55-year life, co-founded the [[West China Union University]] in [[Chengdu]], co-founded and led the first [[Christian pacifist]] movement, the [[International Fellowship of Reconciliation]], and founded the [[Pendle Hill Quaker Center for Study and Contemplation|Pendle Hill Quaker meeting and training center]], in [[Wallingford, Pennsylvania]].

==Life==

===Early Years===
Henry Theodore Hodgkin was born on 21 April 1877 in a very affluent Quaker family of [[Darlington]] in [[County Durham]], [[North East England]].&lt;ref name=BMJ&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2368451/?page=1 British Medical Journal, 1 April 1933]&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of Jonathan Backhouse Hodgkin (1843-1926), banker and mayor of Darlington, and of Mary Anna Pease, both from [[Quaker]] families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancestry.co.uk/genealogy/records/jonathan-backhouse-hodgkin_37048073 Genealogic site ancestry.co.uk, last accessed on 14/12/2015.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Hodgkins lived in the majestic Victorian manor of Elm Ridge in  Darlington.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmridgemethodist.co.uk/history.html Elm Ridge manor (now belonging to the [[Methodist Church]]) history page, last accessed on 15/12/2015.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912030904/http://www.elmridgemethodist.co.uk/history.html |date=2012-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After [[Leighton Park School]] he studied first in [[King's College (Cambridge)|King's College, Cambridge]], then in [[St Thomas' Hospital]], London, to become a [[medical doctor]] (M.B. B.Ch (Cantab) ).&lt;ref name=BMJ/&gt; Extremely tall, with exceptional charisma and personality,&lt;ref name=DDA&gt;Dave D’Albert, A Lexicon of Spiritual Leaders In the IFOR Peace Movement, Part 1, Version 3, 2010 [https://www.ifor.org/s/spiritual-leaders-of-ifor.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; he became President of the English Student Missionary Union from 1902 to 1905. This organization's aim was to recruit missionaries among British students.&lt;ref name=BDCM&gt;Ralph R.

===Missionary work in China===
After completing his studies in 1905, Henry Hodgkin left immediately for [[Chengdu]], in the [[Sichuan]] province, [[China]], as a missionary The Friends' Foreign Missionary Association, a Quaker organisation which later became The Friends Service Council ; he stayed in China until 1909. During his stay in Chnegdu, he helped set up the [[West China Union University]], a Protestant university sponsored by several Protestant churches until its closure in 1926; after 1926 the Chinese professors took over from the foreign professors, and perpetuated their work so well that this university has now been incorporated into Chengdu's various universities.

From 1910 to 1920, Henry Hodgkin returned to England, to be the Secretary of The Friends' Foreign Missionary Association. He departed again for China in 1921, initially to deliver a series of lectures. He received however as a result a pressing invitation to become one of the secretaries of the [[National Christian Council of China]]; he held this position from 1922 to 1929.&lt;ref name=BMJ/&gt;&lt;ref name=BDCM/&gt;

===Launching of the [[International Fellowship of Reconciliation]]===
During his decade in Britain from 1910 to 1920, Hodgkin became active on the [[pacifist]] scene. In the summer of 1914, he had joined a group of about 150 European Christians who were convinced that a major conflagration was coming soon in Europe and who had gathered in [[Constance]], in southern Germany, to envisage possible actions to avert an actual war. This conference was far from successful since it was interrupted by the actual declaration of war! While conference participants were hurriedly returning home by train, Henry Hodgkin and the [[Germany|German]] [[Lutheran]] [[pastor]] [[Friedrich Siegmund-Schultze]] made a mutual commitment before parting in [[Cologne]] that while their countries might be at war with each other, "We are one in Christ and can never be at war." This commitment implied of course to abstain from any direct personal participation in the conflict, in line with the traditional pacifist Quaker position, but also to work relentlessly to reestablish peace between their two nations no matter the policies of their governments.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Kupisch, Die deutschen Landes Kirchen im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert, Publisher: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1975, 127 pages, quoting p. 93: "Friedrich Siegmund-Schultze was a pioneer of ecumenism. On 1 August 1914, he was present at the conference of the "Council of Churches of the British and German empires for the promotion of friendly relations between the two peoples" as he was the secretary of this organization. Unfortunately the beginning of the war put an end to the debates even before they could start. With great difficulty, and working his way through them thanks to his good relations with the German imperial court as former pastor of the [[Church of Peace (Sanssouci)|Friedenskirche Potsdam]], Siegmund-Schultze managed to secure the return of the 130 British participants by organising a special train to the Netherlands via [[Cologne]]. " It is on one of the platforms of the [[Köln Hauptbahnhof|Cologne Central Station]] that, on 3 August 1914, the famous embrace between Henry Hodgkin Friedrich Siegmund-Schultze took place during which they mutually promised to remain united in Christ in spite of war and to proclaim the message of peace of the Gospel whatever the circumstances."&lt;/ref&gt; 
Hodgkin kept his word immediately and initiated a first meeting at [[Queens' College, Cambridge]], where he lectured in philosophy: an ecumenical group of about 20 people came together to reflect on the implications of war on their personal and community life. They wrote a common declaration stating they could conceive God as a [[nationalist]] and couldn’t accept the idea of a moratorium on the [[Sermon on the Mount]] on hold for the duration of the war.  The first chapter of the Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR) was born. Another meeting gathered 128 people at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where Henry Hodgkin was elected president of the FOR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forusa.org/blogs/ifor/ifor-centennial-invitation/12896 US site of the International Fellowship of Reconciliation, last accessed on 14/12/2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222111715/http://forusa.org/blogs/ifor/ifor-centennial-invitation/12896 |date=2015-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1915 Hodgkin travelled to New York City with a group of 66 people and convened a meeting at [[Union Theological Seminary (New York City)|Union Theological Seminary]] that included some very influential theologians and ministers the day, including [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] (who would become critical of Christian pacifism in the ’30s and consequently break with the FOR). Among those present that day were [[Edward Evans (divine)|Edward Evans]], [[Norman Thomas]], socialist educator [[Jessie Wallace Hughan]] (who would later found the more secular [[War Resisters League]]), [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] [[Paul Jones (bishop)|bishop Paul Jones]] (who would be forced to resign his Utah see in April 1918 because of his outspoken opposition to World War I), [[Grace Hutchins]] et [[John Haynes Holmes]]. The American chapter of the now [[International Fellowship of Reconciliation]] was then founded.&lt;ref&gt;[https://levellers.wordpress.com/2009/11/08/a-brief-history-of-the-fellowship-of-reconciliation/ « Levellers » site, last accessed on 14/12/2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work in the United States===
In 1929 Henry Hodgkin was called to launch the Quaker [[Pendle Hill Quaker Center for Study and Contemplation|religious and social meeting centre of Pendle Hill]] near [[Philadelphia]] ( [[Pendle Hill]] being the name of the [[Lancashire]] hill where [[George Fox]], the inspirator of [[Quakerism]], had his founding vision).&lt;ref name=BMJ/&gt; Historian Douglas Gwyn has shown Henry Hodgkin’s determining role, contributing his spiritual depth and his social concern to the drafting of the meeting centre’s vision:&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Gwyn, Personality and Place: The Life and Times of Pendle Hill, Plain Press, 2014. 512 pages.  {{ISBN|9781500549367}} [http://www.friendsjournal.org/personality-and-place-the-life-and-times-of-pendle-hill/  Review by Valerie Brown in The Friends’ Journal, 1 November 2015, last accessed on 14/12/2105]&lt;/ref&gt; Pendle Hill’s early vision was to be "a vital center of spiritual culture and as a place for training leaders." In 1929, Henry Hodgkin gathered a dozen leaders to discern the direction for this new center and four key focus areas were chosen as a result:
*House of Rest, a place of peace and deep quiet;
*School of the Prophets, a place to be grounded in a few well-chosen areas rather than teaching on many interesting topics;
*Laboratory of Ideas, a place to test beliefs in practice; and
*Fellowship ’Round Christ among students and staff.
He had to leave this position in 1932 for health reasons.&lt;ref name=BMJ/&gt;

==Books==
Henry  Hodgkin wrote several books, among which: 
*The Message and Mission of Quakerism (1912) (with [[William Charles Braithwaite]] (1862 – 1922))
*Friends beyond the Seas (1916)&lt;ref&gt;Publisher Headley Bros., London, 1916&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Missionary Spirit - Swarthmore Lecture for 1916&lt;ref&gt;Publisher Headley Bros., London, 1916&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Christian Revolution (1923)
*Living Issues in China (1932)

==Philosophy==
Henry Hodgkin’s philosophy was rooted in his Quaker faith, which brought along a deep adhesion to [[pacifism]] and in a high social sensitivity. His views evolved from a strict English Quaker missionary’s view to a more multicultural approach. One of his biographers wrote that he was "a man large of body and mind".&lt;ref name=DDA/&gt; He summarised his own evolution as follows: "By processes too numerous and diverse even to summarize, I have reached a position which may be stated in a general way somewhat like this: "I believe that God's best for another may be so different from my experience and way of living as to be actually impossible for me. I recognize a change to have taken place in myself, from a certain assumption that mine was really the better way, to a very complete recognition that there is no one better way and that God needs all kinds of people and ways of living through which to manifest Himself in the World. This has seemed to carry with it two conclusions which greatly affect conduct. One is that I really find myself wanting to learn from people whom I previously would have regarded as fit objects for my 'missionary zeal'. To discover another way in which God is operating - along lines it may be distasteful or dangerous to me - is a large part of the fun of living. The second direction in which conduct is influenced is the deliberate attempt to share the life and interests of others who are not in my circle ... [for] in such sharing I can most deeply understand the other's life and through that reach, maybe, fresh truths about God.&lt;ref name=DDA/&gt;"

==Family==
Henry Hodgkin married Elizabeth Joy Montgomery. They had three children. He died on 26 March 1933 in [[Dublin]] a few weeks after undergoing surgery. 
His family counted a variety of personalities who deeply influenced the region of [[Darlington]]:
*As a banker, his father had financed a fair share of the region’s  industrial development. 
*His father-in-law, John Pease was the oldest son of railway pioneer [[Edward Pease (railway pioneer)|Edward Pease]], and another affluent Quaker industrialist who had the Elm Ridge manor built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmridgemethodist.co.uk/history.html Page historique sur Elm Ridge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912030904/http://www.elmridgemethodist.co.uk/history.html |date=2012-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*His brother Jonathan Edward Hodgkin (1875-1953) was a devoted humanitarian during World War I, heading the local branch of The Friends War Victims Relief Committee - FWVRC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quaker.org.uk/about-quakers/our-history/quakers-and-wwi Historical page about the Quakers, last accessed on 15/12/2015]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1916 on he served in [[Durham, England|Durham]] as a Quaker chaplain to the imprisoned conscientious objectors and organised transport for wounded in Darlington district. He also became treasurer of the [[Peace Society|London Peace Society]].&lt;ref&gt;"Conscription and Conscience: A History, 1916-1919″, quoted by [http://www.durhamatwar.org.uk/story/11343/  Historical of Durham city]&lt;/ref&gt;
*His sister Mary Hodgkin (1882-1956) was the secretary of Darlington Town Mission for many years. She raised the needed money to build the Chapel at the Darlington Memorial Hospital for the use of the patients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aboutdarlington.co.uk/friends_burial_ground.htm Her grave can be seen in Darlington Quaker cemetery.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Diogenes looking for a man - attributed to JHW Tischbein.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.3|''Diogenes Searching for an Honest Man'', attributed to [[Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein|J. H. W. Tischbein]] ({{circa}} 1780)]]
'''Honesty''' is a [[facet]] of [[moral character]] that connotes positive and [[virtue|virtuous]] attributes such as [[integrity]], [[truth]]fulness, straightforwardness, including straightforwardness of conduct, along with the absence of lying, cheating, theft, etc. Honesty also involves being trustworthy, [[Loyalty|loyal]], [[wikt:fair#Adjective|fair]], and [[Sincerity|sincere]].

Honesty is valued in many ethnic and religious cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Carl R. (1964.) "Toward a modern approach to values: The valuing process in the mature person.", ''The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology'', 68(2):160-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dahlsgaard, Katherine; Peterson, Christopher; Seligman, Martin E. P. (2005.) "Shared Virtue: The Convergence of Valued Human Strengths Across Culture and History", ''Review of General Psychology'', 9(3):203-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hilbig, Benjamin E.; Zettler, Ingo. (2009.) "Pillars of cooperation: Honesty–Humility, social value orientations, and economic behavior", ''Journal of Research in Personality'', 43(3):516-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Lange, Paul A. M.; Kuhlman, D. Michael. (1994.) "Social value orientations and impressions of partner's honesty and intelligence: A test of the might versus morality effect", ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 67(1):126-141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schluter, Dolph; Price, Trevor. (1993.) "Honesty, Perception and Population Divergence in Sexually Selected Traits", ''Proceedings of the Royal Society B'', 253(1336):117-22.&lt;/ref&gt;
"Honesty is the best policy" is a [[proverb]] of [[Benjamin Franklin]], while the quote "Honesty is the first chapter in the book of [[wisdom]]" is attributed to [[Thomas Jefferson]], as used in a letter to  [[Nathaniel Macon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=mtj1&amp;fileName=mtj1page051.db&amp;recNum=211 |work=The Thomas Jefferson Papers Series 1. General Correspondence. 1651-1827 |title= Thomas Jefferson to Nathaniel Macon |date=January 12, 1819}}&lt;/ref&gt; April 30 is national [[Honesty Day]] in the [[United States]].

[[William Shakespeare]] famously describes honesty as an attribute people leave behind when he wrote that "no legacy is so rich as honesty" in act 3 scene 5 of "[[All's Well that Ends Well]]."&lt;ref name="shakespeare"&gt;William Shakespeare. [http://shakespeare.mit.edu/allswell/allswell.3.5.html All's Well That Ends Well] MIT Shakespeare.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have noted, however, that "[t]oo much honesty might be seen as undisciplined openness".&lt;ref&gt;Barbara MacKinnon, Andrew Fiala, ''Ethics: Theory and Contemporary Issues, Concise Edition'' (2015), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, individuals may be perceived as being "too honest" if they honestly express the negative [[opinion]]s of others, either without having been asked their opinion, or having been asked in a circumstance where the response would be trivial.

==Definitions==
[[Merriam-Webster]] defines honesty as "fairness and straightforwardness of conduct" or "adherence to the facts."&lt;ref name="merriamwebster"&gt;Merriam-Webster (2017) [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/honesty Honesty] Merriam-Webster.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines honesty as "the quality of being honest."&lt;ref name="oed1"&gt;Oxford English Dictionary (2017) [https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/honesty Honesty] OED.&lt;/ref&gt; Honest is, in turn, defined as "Free of deceit; truthful and sincere...Morally correct or virtuous...(attributive) Fairly earned, especially through hard work...(of an action) done with good intentions even if unsuccessful or misguided...(attributive) Simple, unpretentious, and unsophisticated.&lt;ref name="oed2"&gt;Oxford English Dictionary (2017) [https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/honest Honest] OED.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intensional logic''' is an approach to [[predicate logic]] that extends [[first-order logic]], which has quantifiers that range over the individuals of a universe (''[[Extension (predicate logic)|extensions]]''), by additional quantifiers that range over terms that may have such individuals as their value (''[[intension]]s'').  The distinction between intensional and extensional entities is parallel to the distinction between [[sense and reference]].

[[Logic]] is the study of proof and [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]] as manifested in language (abstracting from any underlying psychological or biological processes).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruzsa|2000|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Logic is not a closed, completed science, and presumably, it will never stop developing: the logical analysis can penetrate into varying depths of the language&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruzsa|2000|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; (sentences regarded as atomic, or splitting them to predicates applied to individual terms, or even revealing such fine logical structures like [[Modal logic|modal]], [[Temporal logic|temporal]], [[dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic]], [[Epistemic logic|epistemic]] ones).

In order to achieve its special goal, logic was forced to develop its own formal tools, most notably its own grammar, detached from simply making direct use of the underlying natural language.&lt;ref name=logical_grammar&gt;{{harvnb|Ruzsa|2000|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Functors belong to the most important categories in logical grammar (along with basic categories like ''sentence'' and ''individual name''&lt;ref name=basic_category&gt;{{harvnb|Ruzsa|2000|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;): a functor can be regarded as an "incomplete" expression with argument places to fill in. If we fill them in with appropriate subexpressions, then the resulting entirely completed expression can be regarded as a result, an output.&lt;ref name=functor/&gt; Thus, a functor acts like a function sign,&lt;ref name=function_sign&gt;{{harvnb|Ruzsa|2000|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking on input expressions, resulting in a new, output expression.&lt;ref name=functor&gt;{{harvnb|Ruzsa|2000|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Formal semantics (logic)|Semantics]] links expressions of language to the outside world. Also logical semantics has developed its own structure. Semantic values can be attributed to expressions in basic categories: the [[reference]] of an individual name (the "designated" object named by that) is called its [[Extension (semantics)|extension]]; and as for sentences, their [[truth value]] is called also extension.&lt;ref name=logical_semantics&gt;{{harvnb|Ruzsa|2000|pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for functors, some of them are simpler than others: extension can be attributed to them in a simple way. In case of a so-called ''extensional'' functor we can in a sense abstract from the "material" part of its inputs and output, and regard the functor as a function turning directly the ''extension of'' its input(s) into the extension of its output. Of course, it is assumed that we can do so at all: the extension of input expression(s) determines the extension of the resulting expression. Functors for which this assumption does not hold are called ''intensional''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruzsa|2000|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural languages abound with intensional functors,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruzsa|1987|p=724}}&lt;/ref&gt; this can be illustrated by [[intensional statement]]s. [[Extensional logic]] cannot reach inside such fine logical structures of the language, it stops at a coarser level. The attempts for such deep logical analysis have a long past: authors as early as [[Aristotle]] had already studied modal [[syllogism]]s.&lt;ref name=Aristotle&gt;{{harvnb|Ruzsa|2000|pp=246–247}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gottlob Frege]] developed a kind of [[two dimensional semantics]]: for resolving questions like those of [[intensional statement]]s, he has [[Sense and reference|introduced a distinction between two semantic values]]: sentences (and individual terms) have both an extension and an [[intension]].&lt;ref name="function_sign" /&gt; These semantic values can be interpreted, transferred also for functors (except for intensional functors, they have only intension).

As mentioned, motivations for settling problems that belong today to intensional logic have a long past. As for attempts of formalizations. the development of [[Proof calculus|calculi]] often preceded the finding of their corresponding formal semantics. Intensional logic is not alone in that: also Gottlob Frege accompanied his (extensional) calculus with detailed explanations of the semantical motivations, but the formal foundation of its semantics appeared only in the 20th century. Thus sometimes similar patterns repeated themselves for the history of development of intensional logic like earlier for that of extensional logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruzsa|2000|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some intensional logic systems that claim to fully analyze the common language:
* [[Transparent Intensional Logic]]
* [[Modal logic]]

== Modal logic ==
{{main|Modal logic}}

[[Modal logic]] is historically the earliest area in the study of intensional logic, originally motivated by formalizing "necessity" and "possibility" (recently, this original motivation belongs to [[alethic logic]], just one of the many branches of modal logic).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruzsa|2000|p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modal logic can be regarded also as the most simple appearance of such studies: it extends extensional logic just with a few sentential functors:&lt;ref name="Ruzsa"&gt;{{harvnb|Ruzsa|2000|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; these are intensional, and they are interpreted (in the metarules of semantics) as quantifying over possible worlds. For example, the Necessity operator (the 'square') when applied to a sentence A says ' The sentence "('square')A" is true in world i if it is true in all worlds accessible from world i'. The  corresponding Possibility operator (the 'diamond') when applied to A asserts that "('diamond')A" is true in world i iff A is true in some worlds (at least one) accessible to world i. The exact semantic content of these assertions therefore depends crucially on the nature of the Accessibility relation. For example, is world i accessible from itself? The answer to this question characterizes the precise nature of the system, and many exist, answering moral and temporal questions (in a temporal system, the accessibility relation covers states or 'instants' and only the future is accessible from a given moment. The Necessity operator corresponds to 'for all future moments' in this logic. The operators are related to one another by similar [[Duality (mathematics)|dualities]] to quantifiers do&lt;ref name=sf&gt;{{harvnb|Ruzsa|2000|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for example by the analogous correspondents of [[De Morgan's laws]]). I.e., Something is necessary iff its negation is  not possible, i.e. inconsistent. Syntactically, the operators are not quantifiers, they do not bind variables,&lt;ref name=qpw/&gt; but govern whole sentences. This gives rise to the problem of Referential Opacity, i.e. the problem of quantifying over or 'into' modal contexts. The operators appear in the grammar as sentential functors,&lt;ref name=sf/&gt; they are called [[modal operator]]s.&lt;ref name=qpw&gt;{{harvnb|Ruzsa|2000|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned, precursors of modal logic includes [[Aristotle]]. Medieval scholastic discussions accompanied its development, for example about [[De dicto and de re|''de re'' versus ''de dicto'']] modalities: said in recent terms, in the ''de re'' modality the modal functor is applied to an [[open sentence]], the variable is [[Free variables and bound variables|bound]] by a [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]] whose [[Variable (programming)#Scope and extent|scope]] includes the whole intensional subterm.&lt;ref name=Aristotle/&gt;

Modern modal logic began with the [[Clarence Irving Lewis]], his work was motivated by establishing the notion of [[strict implication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruzsa|2000|p=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Possible world]]s approach enabled more exact study of semantical questions. Exact formalization resulted in [[Kripke semantics]] (developed by [[Saul Kripke]], [[Jaakko Hintikka]], Stig Kanger).&lt;ref name="Ruzsa" /&gt;

== Type theoretical intensional logic ==

Already in 1951, [[Alonzo Church]] had developed an intensional [[Proof calculus|calculus]]. The semantical motivations were explained expressively, of course without those tools that we know in establishing semantics for modal logic in a formal way, because they had not been invented then:&lt;ref name=Church&gt;{{harvnb|Ruzsa|2000|p=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Church has not provided formal semantic definitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruzsa|1989|p=492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, [[possible world]] approach to semantics provided tools for a comprehensive study in intensional semantics. [[Richard Montague]] could preserve the most important advantages of Church's intensional calculus in his system. Unlike its forerunner, [[Montague grammar]] was built in a purely semantical way: a simpler treatment became possible, thank to the new formal tools invented since Church's work.&lt;ref name=Church/&gt;

'''John Edmund Hare''' (born 26 July 1949) is a British [[Classical studies|classicist]], [[philosopher]], [[ethicist]], and currently [[Noah Porter]] Professor of [[Philosophical Theology]] at [[Yale University]].

==Biography==
He received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] honours in [[Literae Humaniores]] in 1971 from [[Balliol College, Oxford]], and a [[PhD]] in classical philosophy from [[Princeton University]] in 1975. He was a visiting assistant professor at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1975, a Professor of Philosophy at [[Lehigh University]] from 1975 to 1989, and Professor of Philosophy at [[Calvin College]] from 1989 to 2003. Hare served on the staff of the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs]] from 1982–83, and was selected to give the [[Gifford Lectures]] at the [[University of Glasgow]] in 2005. He has been the [[Noah Porter]] Professor of [[Philosophical Theology]] at [[Yale University]] since 2003.

Hare has been on the editorial boards of several academic journals, including ''The Journal of Religious Ethics'', ''[[American Philosophical Quarterly]]'', ''[[History of Philosophy Quarterly]]'', and ''[[Ancient Philosophy (journal)|Ancient Philosophy]]'', and currently serves on the boards of the Yale Center for Bioethics, [[Yale Center for Faith and Culture]] and [[Berkeley Divinity School]].

==Philosophical Views==
The author of over sixty articles in scholarly journals, Hare has worked on a wide range of topics, including [[ancient philosophy]], medieval Franciscan philosophy, [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], contemporary ethical theory, the theory of the [[Ransom theory of atonement|atonement,]] [[medical ethics]], [[international relations]] and [[aesthetics]].

The son of the British [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] [[R. M. Hare]], Hare has created an [[Meta-ethics|ethical theory]] which integrates [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian [[deontological ethics]] with [[utilitarian]] [[consequentialism]]. Unlike his father's, Hare's philosophy is specifically Christian and includes elements of [[Divine command theory]].

In ''The Moral Gap'' (1996), Hare outlined and analyzed various philosophers' responses to the gap &amp;mdash; which he finds to be identified in Kant's writings &amp;mdash; between human ethical ability and human ethical [[duty]]; between what is possible and what is required. He sees this "moral gap" as ultimately unbridgable apart from [[religion]]. In ''God's Call'' (2001), Hare addresses the "moral gap" with a discussion of the divine command theory of morality, and argues against [[J. B. Schneewind]]'s secularized reading of Kant's philosophy.

In ''Why Bother Being Good?'' (2002), Hare delivers a non-technical apologetic for Christian beliefs and argues that morality cannot be adequately grounded in reason alone but needs a firm basis in faith, or something that will do the work theology has done for the Western tradition in the past. In ''God and Morality: A Philosophical History'' (2007), Hare evaluates the ethical theories of [[Aristotle]], [[Duns Scotus]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and the author's father, [[R. M. Hare]], with close attention to the similarities among the philosophers and the relationship of their work to theism.

==Awards and honors==
In addition to being the Plantinga Lecturer (2008) and [[Gifford Lecturer]] (2005), Hare has been the Calvin Lecturer (1999–2000) and the Stob Lecturer (1999). He held the senior fellowship at the Center for Philosophy of Religion at the [[University of Notre Dame]] from 1998–99, and again from 2008-09. In 1997, Hare was the recipient of the Institute for Advanced Christian Studies Book Prize and held the Pew Evangelical Fellowship from 1991–92. He was also a Congressional Fellow of the [[American Philosophical Association]] from 1981–82, and a visiting fellow in the humanities at the [[Medical College of Pennsylvania]] from 1978-81. Hare is the recipient of the Junior Lindback Award for Distinguished Teaching (1981) and was elected an honorary member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]] (1979).

==Personal==
Hare worked as a teacher at [[Tyndale Biscoe School]] in Kashmir (India) from 1966-67. He is a published composer of liturgical compositions for choir and organ. A student in Hare's course on [[theological aesthetics]] at Yale disclosed on the student review platform [[RateMyProfessors.com|Rate My Professors]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;John Hare is a gem, the kind of professor in [[C. S. Lewis]]'s books. He's brilliant, a leading expert in the field, played Beethoven on the piano to illustrate philosophical concepts, and made me cry while he read poems about God. I will remember his lectures for the rest of my life. He deals in heavy concepts, so do the reading and bring your A game.&lt;ref name="signandsight1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=565944 |title=Student review (12/07/2012) |publisher=ratemyprofessors.com |accessdate=2015-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''John Hardwig''' is a retired [[Philosophy|philosopher]] who was head of the philosophy department at the [[University of Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.utk.edu/~philosop/staff/hardwig.html|title=John Hardwig|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160217052827/http://web.utk.edu/~philosop/staff/hardwig.html|archivedate=2016-02-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has published widely on [[bioethics]], end of life issues and the notion of epistemic dependency and the role of experts. He is best known for a 1997 article proposing that individuals have a duty to die in situations when those who love them would have their lives seriously compromised by continuing to take care of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/euthanasia/overview/duty.shtml | title=Is there a duty to die? | work=BBC Ethics | accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In much of his writings, he calls for the learning of a "dying art", which he describes as becoming necessary at a time when death comes too late, rather than too early. This phenomenon is often referred to as the 'fourth phase' of the [[epidemiological transition]].&lt;ref name="fourthstage"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olshansky|first1=S.J.|last2=Ault|first2=A.B.|title=The Fourth Stage of the Epidemiological Transition: The Age of Delayed Degenerative Diseases|journal=Milbank Memorial  Fund  Quarterly Health and Society|date=1986|volume=64|pages=355–391|jstor=3350025}}&lt;/ref&gt; He frequently argued that there are cases in which there exists a [[right to die]], especially when prolonging life imposes a great burden on loved ones. His arguments have been very influential among contemporary philosophers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8236">'''John of la Rochelle, O.F.M.''' (also known as '''Jean de La Rochelle''', '''John of Rupella''', and '''Johannes de Rupella''') ({{circa}} 1200 - 8 February 1245), was a [[French people|French]] [[Franciscan]] and [[theology|theologian]].

== Life ==
He was born in [[La Rochelle]] (in Latin, ''Rupella''), towards the end of the 12th century, and seems to have entered the Franciscan Order at an early age. He was a pupil of [[Alexander of Hales]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://servus.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/fra/FRAtho02.html Franciscan Schools of Thought]&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first Franciscan to receive a [[bachelor's degree]] of theology from the [[University of Paris]].  He produced multiple treatises, sermons, commentaries on scripture, and also played a large role in the ''Summa fratris Alexandri'', a theological ''[[Summa]]'' written by Alexander.  “Hales left the beginnings of the theological Summa, and it was completed by John of la Rochelle and others”.&lt;ref&gt;Smalley, ''The gospels in the Paris schools in the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries: Peter the Chanter, Hugh of St. Cher, Alexander of Hales, John of la Rochelle''.    Franciscan Studies, Volume 39, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1238, he was a master of theology, with his own pupils, for his name is found in the list of masters convoked in that year by [[William of Auvergne, Bishop of Paris]], to discuss the question of ecclesiastical [[benefice]]s.

“For Jean de la Rochelle, theology is essentially wisdom…Jean deems that three things are required for a theologian: knowledge, a holy life, and teaching.  Someone who teaches Scripture should have a solid doctoral formation, but should also embody in himself sacred knowledge by his good will and moral actions, before practicing his profession upon others through teaching and preaching”.&lt;ref name=Gracia /&gt;

In dissensions which rent the Franciscan order, John was one of the opponents of [[Brother Elias]], and with Alexander of Hales was involved in discussions that led to the plot which brought about Elias' downfall in 1239. When the 1241 Chapter of [[Definitor]]s called for comments on disputed questions on the Franciscan Rule, the Province of Paris asked John of La Rochelle, together with [[Alexander of Hales]], Robert of Bascia and Odo of Rigaud, to furnish an explanation of the [[Rule of St. Francis]]. The work received the approbation of the [[General Chapter]] of the Order held at [[Bologna]] in 1242, and subsequently became known as the "Exposition of the Four Masters."

He died in 1245, the same year as his teacher Alexander of Hales.

== Works ==
His works, the ''Tractatus de divisione potentiarum animae'' (''A Treatise on the Multiple Divisions of the Soul’s Power''), written c. 1233, and ''Summa de anima'' (''Summa on the Soul''), written c. 1235, were arguably some of his best. Father Fidelis of [[Fanna]] says (on the ''Summa'') that no subject is to be found so frequently in manuscripts of the 13th and 14th centuries in the many European libraries he searched.

There also exist ''summae'' on the virtue, vices, the articles of the faith, and the ten commandments; many biblical commentaries; sermons, and disputed questions on grace and other theological topics.

John was among those who declared against the general lawfulness of plurality. He appears to have enjoyed a favorable reputation, and is described by [[Bernard of Besse]] as a professor of great fame for holiness and learning, whose writings were both solid and extremely useful.

The main aim of the ''Summa de anima'' is to set out Jean’s position on being and essence in the context of the debate between those who defend the theory that all of created being is composed of matter and form, and those who, like Thomas Aquinas later would, rejected the doctrine which attributed a composite nature to the soul.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Denise ''Jean de la Rochelle’s Distinction Between Being and Essence and its Significance in Debate Regarding the Aristotelian Four Causes in Relation to the Rational Soul''. Yearbook of the Irish Philosophical Society, National University of Ireland (Department of Philosophy) 29 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Jean investigates the soul according to the four Aristotelian causes: material, efficient, formal, and final.  
He states what he believes to be intellectual cognition, “while nonetheless retaining certain [[Avicenna|Avicennian]] doctrines”.&lt;ref name="Gracia"&gt;Gracia, Jorge J. E. and Timothy B. Noone (eds). ''A companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages'' (Malden MA: Blackwell 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  Going deeper into the investigation of the soul, Jean introduces a doctrine that distinguishes the soul into two levels of reason: higher and lower.  The levels of the soul are distinguished according to their objects: the objects of higher reasoning can be classified as a spiritual being, and the objects of lower reasoning are classified as corporeal.
“Following Augustine, Jean classifies the objects of knowledge further by dividing them into four categories: beings above, beside, in, or beneath the soul”.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, Leonard ''The Development of the Doctrine of the Agent Intellect in the Franciscan School of the Thirteenth Century''. Modern Schoolman: A Quarterly Journal of Philosophy, Volume 50, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;  He also proposes a different agent intellect for each class of objects: the immanent agent intellect suitable for corporeal beings, and two further agent intellects: one for beings outside the soul, such as angels, and one for the being above the soul, God himself. The distinction between the agent intellect outside the soul and the one above the soul, also shows Augustine’s heavy influence on Jean, since similar doctrines are found in Augustine’s work ''On Spirit and the Soul''.  Jean's idea here is similar to Avicenna’s views on separate intelligence, in relation to a separate ''angelic'' agent intellect that acts upon the soul’s immanent agent intellect.

John’s ''Treatise on the Multiple Divisions of the Soul’s Power'' (''Tractatus'') gives another detailed view of his conception of the soul. "Fortunately it shows more clearly than his Summa how he appropriates and begins to transform his philosophical sources”.&lt;ref name=Craig /&gt;  The Tractatus is divided into three parts that correspond to the three ways of looking at the soul: definition, division, and completion or perfection. “Jean’s typical procedure in each of the three parts of the Tractatus is to assemble authoritative texts on the point at hand and then to analyze their competing vocabularies”.&lt;ref name=Craig&gt;Craig, Edward ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' Volume 5, Published by Routledge 1998&lt;/ref&gt; His analysis of competing vocabularies of the soul includes a wide range of sources, including Plato, Aristotle, Seneca, the book of Genesis, Nemesius of Emesa, and Avicenna. Jean’s Tractatus was a great example of how challenging it was for theologians to organize and clarify much of the newly translated material of the 13th century.

Jean made significant progress as a philosopher in a time when Parisian theologians abstained from philosophical studies. Jean had many influences and referenced many works from theologians and philosophers alike; however, much of his work, especially that in philosophy of the soul, indicates much originality.

==Biography==
Keerandhaiyar is believed to have belonged to the Brahmin caste of the Keerar tribe, who changed their occupation from yagna to [[performing arts]]. These people primarily spoke [[Sanskrit]] but have adapted themselves to the [[Tamil culture]] and language. He belonged to the [[Aryan race]] who had come down south and settled down in the Tamil land since antiquity. There were about 24 poets of the Sangam era who belonged to this tribe, including Nakkirar I and Kanakkaayanar.&lt;ref name="SangaIlakkiyam_2"&gt;{{cite book

'''Khilafah Ammah''' (خلافة عامّة) is a type of [[Islam]]ic governmental concept introduced by Shah Waliullah in his book ''[[Izalatul Khafa'an Khilafatul Khulafa]]''.

In that book he introduces a unique classification of ''khilafah'' ([[Caliphate]]) into 'Ammah' (ordinary) and '[[Khilafah Khassah|Khassah]]' (extraordinary). Whatever has so far been explained concerning the qualifications, the modes of election or functions and duties of the khalifah, pertain to what Shah Waliullah terms as ''Khilafah Ammah''.

This latter type of khilafh, ''Khilafah Ammah'', can be established at any point of time in history whenever the necessary conditions exist. A ''khalifah'' ([[Caliph]]) who belongs to the category of khilafah 'Ammah, does not enjoy the lofty level of faith from the community.

Members of the community do support his appointment on account of high level of knowledge and integrity, but they do so merely on the basis of their opinion in that behalf and not pursuant to any revelational indication or Prophetic approval to that effect.

'''Kitodo''' ([[Abbreviation|Abbr.]] of ''key to digital objects'') is an [[open-source software]] suite intended to support mass digitization projects for cultural heritage institutions. The software implements international standards such as [[Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard|METS]], [[Metadata Object Description Schema|MODS]] and other formats maintained by the [[Library of Congress]]. Kitodo consists of several independent modules serving different purposes such as controlling the digitization workflow, enriching descriptive and structural metadata, and presenting the results to the public in a modern and convenient way. It is used by archives, libraries, museums, publishers and scanning utilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|accessdate = 2017-04-12

|title      = Kitodo - open source software for workflow management in digitization projects
|url        = http://www.kitodo.org/en/
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
Kitodo contains the two main modules ''Kitodo.Presentation'' and ''Kitodo.Production'' and the following properties:
* Central management of the digital copies (images)
* Central [[metadata]] [[Data management|management]]: it supports cataloguing and integration of metadata from various locations
* Controlling mechanisms: they are used to control the progress of work of the partners
* Export and import interfaces for metadata and third-party digital copies
* Management tasks: managing error messages, completion of work work steps and to convey to the next step, including the change of partners
* Platform-independence: Kitodo is a [[Web application]] and has to be designed in this way, as partners in digitisation of a customer are often distributed all over the world.

The viewer module includes an ''indexer''.

Components for the distributed workflow management are integrated into the product to ensure the management of a distributed communication and production among various partners.

==History==
Until May 2016, Kitodo was known as ''[[Goobi]]'' (Abbreviation of ''[[Göttingen]] online-objects binaries'').
The workflow part of the software exists in two different forks of the original Goobi software. While the Goobi community edition, now known as Kitodo, is cooperatively maintained by major German libraries and digitization service providers, the Intranda edition is developed by a single company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Kitodo is used in at least 8 German libraries.

In May 2016, the German Goobi association ''Goobi Digitalisieren im Verein e.&amp;nbsp;V.'' decided to choose the new name ''Kitodo'' to avoid legal problems with the old name ''Goobi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10923">'''Legal certainty''' is a principle in national and international law which holds that the law must provide those subject to it with the ability to regulate their conduct.  Legal certainty is internationally recognised as a central requirement for the [[rule of law]].

== Definition ==
The legal system needs to permit those subject to the law to regulate their conduct with certainty and to protect those subject to the law from arbitrary use of state power. Legal certainty represents a requirement that decisions be made according to legal rules, i.e. be lawful. The concept of legal certainty may be strongly linked to that of [[individual autonomy]] in national jurisprudence. The degree to which the concept of legal certainty is incorporated into law varies depending on national jurisprudence. However, legal certainty frequently serves as the central principle for the development of legal methods by which law is made, interpreted and applied.&lt;ref name= Maxeiner /&gt;

Legal certainty is an established legal concept both in the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law legal systems]] and [[common law legal systems]]. In the civil law tradition, legal certainty is defined in terms of maximum predictability of officials' behaviour. In the common law tradition, legal certainty is often explained in terms of citizens' ability to organise their affairs in such a way that does not break the law. In both legal traditions, legal certainty is regarded as grounding value for the legality of legislative and administrative measures taken by public authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Claes| first = Erik| last2 = Devroe| first2 = Wouter | last3 = Keirsblick| first3 = Bert| title = Facing the limits of the law| publisher = Springer| year = 2009| pages =92–93 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pXrCHgUptpUC&amp;dq=%22legal+certainty%22+%22Void+for+vagueness%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn =978-3-540-79855-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rule of law ==
The legal philosopher [[Gustav Radbruch]] regarded legal certainty, justice and purposiveness as the three fundamental pillars of [[law]].&lt;ref name="Leawood"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leawood|first1=Heather|title=Gustav Radbruch: An Extraordinary Legal Philosopher|journal=Washington University Journal of Law &amp; Policy|date=2000|volume=2|page=489|ref=Leawood}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today legal certainty is internationally recognised as a central requirement for the [[rule of law]].&lt;ref name= Maxeiner /&gt; According to the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) the concept of the rule of law "first and foremost seeks to emphasize the necessity of establishing a rule-based society in the interest of legal certainty and predictability." At the G8 Foreign Ministers' Meeting in [[Potsdam]] in 2007, the G8 committed to the rule of law as a core principle entailing adherence to the principle of legal certainty.&lt;ref name= Maxeiner /&gt;

== England and Europe ==
Most European nations regard legal certainty as a fundamental quality of the legal system and a guiding requirement for the [[rule of law]], although they have differing meanings of the term. 

The concept can be traced through [[English common law]]&lt;ref name= Maxeiner /&gt; in that system's recognition that legal certainty requires that laws be made such that people can comply with them.

It also recognised in all European civil legal systems.&lt;ref name="Chalmers 2006 454"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Chalmers| first = Damian| title = European Union law: text and materials | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2006| page= 454 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xvAGWfi2EjwC&amp;dq=legal+certainty+foreseeable&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-521-52741-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is recognised in Germany as ''[[:de:Rechtssicherheit|Rechtssicherheit]]'', in France as ''[[:fr:Sécurité juridique|sécurité juridique]]'', in Spain as ''[[:es:Seguridad juridica|seguridad juridica]]'', in Italy as ''[[:it:Certezza del diritto|certezza del diritto]]'', in the Benelux countries as ''rechtszekerheid'', in Sweden as ''[[:sv:Rättssäkerhet|rättssäkerhet]]'', in Poland as ''[[:pl:Pewność prawa|pewność prawa]]'', and in Finland as ''[[:fi:Oikeusvarmuus|oikeusvarmuus]]''. Legal certainty is now recognised as one of the general principles of [[European community law]] and "requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person – if need be, with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail".&lt;ref name= Maxeiner /&gt; The principle of legal certainty, and as such the rule of law, requires that:
* laws and decisions must be made public
* laws and decisions must be definite and clear
* the decisions of courts must be regarded as binding
* the [[Ex post facto law|retroactivity]] of laws and decisions must be limited
* legitimate interests and expectations must be protected.&lt;ref name="Maxeiner"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Maxeiner| first = James R.| title = Some realism about legal certainty in globalization of the rule of law| publisher = Houston Journal of International law| date = Fall 2008| url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/193182657.html| accessdate = 29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== General principle of European Union law ===
The concept of legal certainty has been recognised as one of the [[general principles of European Union law]] by the [[European Court of Justice]] since the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Chalmers 2006 454"/&gt; It is an important [[general principle of international law]] and [[public law]], which predates European Union law. As a general principle in European Union law, it means that the law must be certain, in that it is clear and precise, and its legal implications foreseeable, especially when applied to financial obligations. The adoption of laws which will have legal effect in the European Union must have a proper legal basis. Legislation in member states which implements European Union law must be worded so that it is clearly understandable by those who are subject to the law.&lt;ref name="Kaczorowsky 2008 232"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Kaczorowsky| first = Alina| title = European Union law | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis| year = 2008| page = 232 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9atmZGmyJKoC&amp;dq=general+principle+of+community+law&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-415-44797-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[European Union law]] the general principle of legal certainty prohibits [[Ex post facto law|''Ex post facto'' laws]], i.e. laws should not take effect before they are published. The general principle also requires that sufficient information must be made public to enable parties to know what the law is and comply with it. For example in ''Opel Austria v Council''&lt;ref&gt;''Opel Austria v Council'' [1997] ECR II-39 Case T-115/94&lt;/ref&gt; the European Court of Justice held that [[European Council]] Regulation did not come into effect until it had been published. Opel had brought the action on the basis that the Regulation in question violated the principle of legal certainty, because it legally came into effect before it had been notified and the regulation published.&lt;ref name="Chalmers 2006 454"/&gt; The doctrine of [[legitimate expectation]], which has its roots in the principles of legal certainty and [[good faith]], is also a central element of the [[General principles of European Union law#Legal certainty|general principle of legal certainty in European Union law]].&lt;ref name="Chalmers 2006 455"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Chalmers| first = Damian| title = European Union law: text and materials | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2006| page = 455 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xvAGWfi2EjwC&amp;dq=legal+certainty+foreseeable&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-521-52741-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legitimate expectation doctrine holds that "those who act in good faith on the basis of law as it is, or seems to be, should not be frustrated in their expectations".&lt;ref name="Kaczorowsky 2008 232"/&gt; This means that a European Union institution, once it has induced a party to take a particular course of action, must not renege on its earlier position if doing so would cause that party to suffer loss. The European Court of Justice has considered the legitimate expectation doctrine in cases where violation of the general principle of legal certainty was alleged in numerous cases involving agricultural policy and European Council regulations, with the leading case being ''Mulder v Minister van Landbouw en Visserij''.&lt;ref&gt;''Mulder v Minister van Landbouw en Visserij'' [1988] ECR 2321 Case 120/86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chalmers 2006 455"/&gt;

The misuse of power test is another significant element of the general principle of legal certainty in European Union law. It holds that a lawful power must not be exercised for any other purpose than that for which it was conferred. According to the misuse of power test a decision by a European Union institution is only a misuse of power if "it appears, on the basis of objective, relevant and consistent evidence, to have been adopted with the exclusive or main purpose of achieving any end other than those stated." A rare instance where the European Court of Justice has held that a European Union institution has misused its powers, and therefore violated the general principle of legal uncertainty, is ''Giuffrida v Commission''.&lt;ref&gt;''Giuffrida v Commission'' [1976] ECR 1395 Case 105/75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Chalmers| first = Damian| title = European Union law: text and materials | publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2006| page = 456 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xvAGWfi2EjwC&amp;dq=legal+certainty+foreseeable&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-521-52741-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general principle of legal certainty is particularly stringently applied when European Union law imposes financial burdens on private parties.&lt;ref name="Chalmers 2006 454"/&gt;

=== European human rights law ===
The concept of legal certainty is recognised by the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name= Maxeiner /&gt;

== United States ==
In United States law the principle of legal certainty is phrased as [[fair warning (law)|fair warning]] and the [[void for vagueness]] principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Claes| first = Erik| last2 = Devroe| first2 = Wouter | last3 = Keirsblick| first3 = Bert| title = Facing the limits of the law| publisher = Springer| year = 2009| pages =93 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pXrCHgUptpUC&amp;dq=%22legal+certainty%22+%22Void+for+vagueness%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn =978-3-540-79855-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the ''[[Calder v. Bull]]'' case it was established that in the U.S. the prohibition of [[ex post facto]] laws applies only to criminal cases, not to civil law.

'''Martin Cyril D'Arcy''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Society of Jesus|SJ]]}} (1888–1976) was a [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Roman Catholic priest]], [[philosophy of love|philosopher of love]], and a correspondent, friend, and adviser of a range of literary and artistic figures including [[Evelyn Waugh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.thetablet.co.uk/article/3038 |publisher=The Tablet |first=Ian |last=Ker |title=Waugh the Catholic }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dorothy L. Sayers]], [[W. H. Auden]], [[Eric Gill]] and [[Edwin Lutyens|Sir Edwin Lutyens]]. He has been described as "perhaps England's foremost Catholic public intellectual from the 1930s until his death".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Harp, "A Conjuror at the Xmas Party", ''[[The Times Literary Supplement|TLS]]'', Dec. 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Educated at [[Stonyhurst]], he entered the [[Society of Jesus]] in 1907 and was ordained priest in 1921. He was [[Provincial superior|Provincial]] of the English Province of the Society of Jesus from 1945 to 1950.

He spent much of his working life at the English Jesuit house in [[Oxford]], [[Campion Hall, Oxford|Campion Hall]], but also spent periods in residence at American universities, including [[Georgetown University]], [[Gonzaga University]], [[Cornell]], and at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].

His major work is ''The Mind and Heart of Love'', published by [[T. S. Eliot]] at [[Faber and Faber]] in 1945,&lt;ref&gt;M. C. D'Arcy, ''The Mind And Heart Of Love: Lion And Unicorn, A Study In Eros And Agape'', Faber and Faber, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; which explores theological relation of [[Eros (concept)|eros]] love and [[agape]] love.

The permanent collection of [[Loyola University Museum of Art]] is named in his memory the ''Martin D'Arcy Collection''.

The c. 350 BCE '''''Neiye''''' 內業 or '''''Inward Training''''' is the oldest Chinese [[received text]] describing [[Daoist meditation|Daoist breath meditation]] techniques and ''[[qi]]'' circulation. After the ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]'' political and philosophical compendium included the ''Neiye'' around the 2nd century BCE, it was seldom mentioned by Chinese scholars until the 20th century, when it was reevaluated as a "proto-Daoist" text that clearly influenced the ''[[Daode jing]]'', ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'', and other classics. ''Neiye'' traditions also influenced [[Chinese thought]] and [[Chinese culture|culture]]. For instance, it had the first references to cultivating the life forces ''[[Jing (TCM)|jing]]'' "essence", ''[[qi]]'' "vital energy", and ''[[Shen (Chinese "spirit; god")|shen]]'' "spirit", which later became a fundamental concept in Daoist ''[[Neidan]]'' "internal alchemy", as well as the [[Three Treasures (traditional Chinese medicine)|Three Treasures]] in [[traditional Chinese medicine]].

==Book==
The [[sinologist]] [[A. C. Graham]] regards the ''Neiye'' as "possibly the oldest 'mystical' text in China" (1989: 100). The professor of [[religious studies]] [[Harold D. Roth]] describes it as "a manual on the theory and practice of meditation that contains the earliest references to breath control and the earliest discussion of the physiological basis of self-cultivation in the Chinese tradition" (1991: 611-2), and perhaps the oldest extant text of Daoism (1994: 37).

===Title===
The title is a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] of two common Chinese words: ''nèi'' [[wikt:内|内]] meaning "inside; inner; internal" and ''yè'' [[wikt:業|業]] "work; deed; achievement; production".

In ancient [[Old Chinese]] that was used when the ''Neiye'' was compiled, the two titular component words had complex meanings. [[Bernhard Karlgren]]'s classic ''[[Grammata Serica Recensa]]'' dictionary translates ''nèi'' 內 as "enter; to bring in, to present; take to heart"; and says the early characters for ''yè'' 業 depicted a "horizontal board of a bell stand or frame", which was used as a [[Chinese character classification#Rebus (phonetic loan) characters|phonetic loan character]] for "initiate; work; action; deed; profession; fortune, inheritance; strong; terrible" (1957: 695e, 640a)

While many English-language authors [[Transliteration of Chinese|transliterate]] the 內業 title as ''Neiye'' or ''Nei-yeh'', some translate it as:
*''The Workings of the Inner'' (Riegel 1978)
*''Inner Workings'' (Rickett 1985) 
*''Operation of the Inner'' (Harper 1987)
*''Inner Cultivation'' or ''Inner Development'' (Kirkland 1997, 2008)
*''Inward Training'' (Graham 1989, Roth 1999)
*''Inner Training'' (Campany 2005)
*''The Inner Enterprise'' (Eno 2005)
[[A. C. Graham]]'s and [[Harold D. Roth]]'s ''Inward Training'' is apparently the most common English title, owing to Roth's ''Neiye'' articles and translation (1991, 1994, 1996, 1997, and 1999).

In modern [[Standard Chinese]] construction and engineering usage, ''nèiyè'' 內業 or 内业 can historically refer to the ancient Daoist text, but more commonly designates "interior work; office work", as opposed to ''wàiyè'' 外業 or 外业 "field operation; field work" (''[[Wenlin]]'' 2016).

===Literary form===
The ''Neiye'' 內業 is a collection of poetic verses describing a method of guided [[breathing meditation]] and the underlying [[cosmology]] of the ''[[Tao|Dao]]'' on which it is based. Roth calls the mystical method "inner cultivation", the goal of which is to directly apprehend this "all-pervading cosmic force" (1999: 11).

The text contains a total of 1,622 characters, and the verses are written almost exclusively in rhymed prose. Most of the lines of verse are [[wikt:tetrasyllabic|tetrasyllabic]], that is, they contain four syllables each of which is represented by one character, but other patterns of five or more syllables sometimes occur. The rhymes occur most often at the end of every second line (Roth 1999: 12). Both the ''Neiye'''s rhymed literary form and philosophical content are similar to the more renowned ''[[Daode jing]]'', which is about three times longer (Kirkland 2008: 771).

Take for example, Verse 2 (with rhyme words shown in [[Old Chinese]] reconstruction) discussing ''jing'' "vital energy":
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Therefore this vital energy is:
Bright!—as if ascending the heavens [天 *''ten''];
Dark!—as if entering an abyss [淵 *''wen''];
Vast!—as if dwelling in an ocean [海 *''xməɣ''];
Lofty!—as if dwelling on a mountain peak [屺 *''kiəɣ''].
Therefore this vital energy
Cannot be halted by force, [力 *''liək'']	
Yet can be secured by inner power [德 *''tək''].
Cannot be summoned by speech,
Yet can be welcomed by the awareness [意 *''ˑiəɣ''].
Reverently hold onto it and do not lose it:
This is called "developing inner power" [德 *''tək''].
When inner power develops and wisdom emerges,
The myriad things will, to the last one, be grasped [得 *''tək'']. 
(tr. Roth 1999: 48-49) &lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Scholars infer two kinds of contextual evidence that the redactor of an initial written ''Neiye'' edition brought together a series of originally distinct verses: the variety of meter and rhyme in the lines, and the two usages of the [[Conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]] ''shìgù'' 是故 “therefore" (Roth 1999: 14). Riegel proposes that these poetic features of the ''Neiye'' would have facilitated memorization and recitation, suggesting that they might have been transmitted orally for a period of time before the compiler assembled and wrote them down. (1978: 148)

Although extant editions of the ''Neiye'' text have only two or three general divisions, it is possible to identify distinct units based on semantic, syntactic, and phonological criteria. Some different proposed textual separations are: fifteen separate verses with some subdivisions (Ma Feibai 馬非百, [[W. Allyn Rickett]] 1985-98); eighteen verses plus four subdivisions ([[Gustav Haloun]] and Jeffrey Riegel 1978); and twenty-six separate verses (Roth 1999: 14).

===Dating===
The date when the ''Neiye'' was compiled is uncertain. Rickett dated the text to the late 4th or early 3rd century BCE, Graham to the 4th, and Roth to the mid-4th (Kirkland 1997: 3); it is thus generally dated to around 350-300 BCE (Kirkland 2008: 771). Campany rejects Roth's arguments for dating the ''Neiye'' to the 4th century BCE because they are based on his "speculative and wishful assumption" that political considerations were added only later to an "original Dao" (2005: 26).

The problem of the dating of the ''Neiye'' is connected to some other texts within the ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]''. Four chapters (''piān'' 篇) have descriptions of meditation practices: ''Xinshu'' 心術 "Techniques of the Mind I and II" (chapters 36 and 37), ''Baixin'' 白心 "The Purified Mind" (38), and ''Neiye'' 內業 "Inward Training" (49). The ''Guanzi'' is an heterogenous collection of writings by diverse [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist]], [[Confucianism|Confucianist]], and [[Daoism|Daoist]] authors; compilation probably began around 300 BCE and material may have been added until 26 BCE when [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]] edited the received text (Roth 1999: 18). 

[[File:Linzi model 2010 06 06.jpg|thumb|right|Model of [[ancient Linzi]].]]
Since these four texts are the only ''Guanzi'' chapters to mention the significance of breath mediation, researchers tend to consider them together (Roth 1999: 18). Furthermore, all four exhibit the irregular rhyme patterns thought to be characteristic of the [[Chu (state)|Chu]] region [[Varieties of Chinese|variety of Chinese]] (Roth 1994: 11). Many scholars have debated over the relationship between ''Neiye'', ''Xinshu I and II'', and ''Baixin''. Most concur that these texts were written by [[Huang-Lao]] Daoist philosophers at the [[Jixia Academy]] in the [[Qi (state)|Qi]] capital of [[Ancient Linzi|Linzi]], but many disagree over the dating of the texts and identity of the redactors. After analyzing the structure and rhetorical characteristics of the ''Daode jing'', ''Neiye'', ''Xinshu I'', and ''Baixin'', The Chinese linguist [[William H. Baxter]] proposed that they constitute a specific [[literary genre]], which emerged from "a distinctive tradition of philosophical verse with strong oral elements and little concept of individual authorship" (1998: 240-243, 249).

In order to estimate the dates of compilation for these ''Guanzi'' writings about breath circulation techniques, Roth analyzed the linguistic features of the ''Neiye'', ''Xinshu I and II'', and ''Baixin''; and concluded that the ''Neiye'' is a genuine 4th-century BCE text while the others are derived from it (1999: 23-25). The first three works have close conceptual and textual parallels, but the ''Baixin''—which is a mostly prose essay on how a sage ruler can apply the meditation techniques to governing—is considered the latest work in the group. Three types of evidence support the antiquity of the ''Neiye''. First, its distinctive literary structure as a composition of originally independent, rhythmic and rhymed verse is a sign of oral transmission before literacy became widespread in the latter half of the 4th century BCE. Second, the ''Neiye'' does not contain the kind of sustained argumentation typically found in 3rd-century BCE philosophical essays, and it shows only a loose principle of organization between its verses. Third, the absence of the correlative cosmology of [[yin and yang]] and the [[Wu Xing|Five Phases]], characteristic of 3rd-century BCE texts. Using [[redaction criticism]] – analyzing the production a text from how the [[redaction|redactors]] (editors, compilers) combined and arranged the source materials – Roth found that the ''Xinshu II'' is an original prose essay in which the redactor deliberately extracted and rearranged ''Neiye'' verses for the purpose of advocating the political benefits of inner cultivation methods (1994: 34). It thus complements ''Xinshu I'' and accounts for the ''Guanzi'' labeling them as parts of one essay (1999: 26).

More specifically, Roth proposes that the ''Neiye'''s exclusively verse format and absence of political thought would support a date of mid-4th century at the latest. The first part of ''Xinshu I'' contains verses that are almost as old, but since they begin to advocate applying inner cultivation techniques to the task of governing and show evidence of interaction with rival intellectual positions, he dates them to about 300 BCE. The commentary contained in the second part of ''Xinshu I'' shows the influence of the ''Daodejing'' and so must be dated to a later time after this work became influential in intellectual circles about 250 BCE (1999: 26-27).

A 45-character inscription on a Warring States era jade artifact may possibly be an earlier record of breath meditation than the ''Neiye'' (Harper 1999: 881). This rhymed passage entitled ''Xíngqì'' 行氣 "circulating the vital breath" was inscribed on a [[dodecagonal]] block of jade, with nine trisyllabic phrases describing the stages of breath cultivation. While the dating is uncertain, estimates range from earlier than 400 BCE ([[Joseph Needham]]), 380 BCE ([[Guo Moruo]]), to late 4th century BCE (Harper). In any case, scholars agree that this is the earliest Chinese epigraphical evidence on the practice of breath meditation (Roth 1999: 162).

==Basic concepts==
The ancient ''Neiye'' presents a "seamless web … connecting the psychological, physiological, and spiritual aspects of the human being" (Roth 1999: 106). It is the earliest known text that explains self-cultivation through daily, practiced regulation of a group of life forces. Namely, ''qi'' "vital energy" (the universal force that gives life to all things), ''jing'' "vital essence" (one's innate reservoir of ''qi''), ''xin'' "heart-mind", ''shen'' "spirit; spiritual consciousness", ''dao'' "the Way", and ''de'' "inner power". These terms later became keywords in Chinese philosophy, but the ''Neiye'' sometimes used them idiosyncratically, for instance, ''dao'' was effectively interchangeable with ''shen'' and ''qi'' (Kirkland 2008: 771).

'''''[[Qi]]''''', which Roth translates as "vital energy" or "vital breath", integrates the physical with the psychological. Kirkland describes ''qi'' "life-energy" in the ''Neiye'' as "a powerful salubrious reality" that is present everywhere and within all things (1997: 5). According to the ''Neiye'', human beings are made up of systems containing various manifestations of ''qi''; the ''[[Zang-fu#Zang|wǔzàng]]'' 五臟 Five Orbs/Viscera system includes not only the physical organs (lungs, kidneys, liver, gallbladder, and spleen), but also the psychological range of mental and emotional states—presciently similar to the contemporary idea of [[neural correlates]] for consciousness (Roth 1999: 41-42). 

'''''[[Jing (Chinese medicine)|Jing]]''''' "vital essence" is a central concept in the ''Neiye'', with meanings that span from the universal life-giving essence contained in all creatures to the particular physiological substrate that allows sages to achieve profound tranquility. Within each person, ''qi'' energy is centered in the ''jing'' essence, which Roth describes as "the source of the vital energy in human beings [and] the basis of our health, vitality, and psychological well-being" (1999: 42). Verse 8 provides the following clear equation: "The vital essence [''jing'' 精]: it is the essence [精] of the vital energy [''qi'' 氣]." Thus, it is concentrated and subtle form of vital energy (Roth 1999: 101). 

The original meaning of ''jing'' (written 精 with the "[[rice radical]]" 米) "finest and purest rice" was a religious concept (Harper 1998: 119). Pure and refined things were considered as the "stuff of spirits; quintessence; essence", referring either to sacrificial offerings suitable for the gods/spirits or the potency of the spirits themselves. In later usage ''jing'' came to mean "germinal essence; energy that nourishes the human body; vitality". Harper translates this term both as "essence" and "specter, spectral" in the ''Neiye'' (1998: 155).

The two most important philosophical concepts in the "Neiye" are the closely related notions of the vital essence and the Way. The power of the Way to generate all things is manifested as the vital essence, which is the procreative principle within all phenomena (Roth 1999: 101). The first lines of the text compare heavenly and earthly ''jing''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;The vital essence of all things: 
It is this that brings them to life. 
It generates the five grains below 
And becomes the constellated stars above. 
When flowing amid the heavens and earth,
We call it ghostly and numinous. 
When stored within the chests of human beings, 
We call them sages. (Verse 1, tr. Roth 1999: 46) &lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
By storing ''jing'' within the heart/mind, one can become sagely. The sage's cultivation does not occur only at the spiritual level but rather sets into motion physiological changes, causing the human body to become thoroughly transformed and renewed (Yang 2003: 102).

'''''[[Xin (concept)|Xin]]''''' "heart; mind" is regularly translated by Roth as "mind" with a concrete connotation of not just the physical "heart" but also the entire sphere of vital energy that flows through it (1999: 42). The ''xin'' is described as the ruling agency in an individual's "biospiritual nexus, i.e., in the entire personal complex of body/mind/heart/spirit" (Kirkland 1997: 6). The ''xin'' can become agitated by excessive thought or emotion, which leads to dissipation of one's ''jing'' 精 "vital essence", and can result in sickness and death. To preserve health and vitality, the ''Neiye'' says that ''jing'' 靜 "stabilizing; calming" the ''xin'' will draw in the external realities of ''shen'' and ''dao'' (Kirkland 2008: 771). 

'''''[[Shen (Chinese religion)|Shen]]''''' is usually translated as English "spirit; spiritual", but in order to avoid the connotative ambiguities of ''spirit'', Roth uses "[[numen]]; [[numinous]]" in reference to a layer of mystical awareness that lies within the human body (1999: 43). ''Shen'' comprises perception, cognition, and higher forms of awareness. The original meaning of ''shen'' "god; spirit; deity" was also a religious concept. External spirits were believed to occasionally descend to human beings (particularly shamans), or humans could draw them down with the power of ''de'' "inner power; virtue" (Harper 1998: 119).

Verse 13 describes the aspects of ''shen'' "numen; numinous":
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;There is a numinous [mind] naturally residing within [有神自在身];
One moment it goes, the next it comes,
And no one is able to conceive of it.
If you lose it you are inevitably disordered;
If you attain it you are inevitably well ordered.
Diligently clean out its lodging place [敬除其舍]
And its vital essence will naturally arrive [精將自來].
Still your attempts to imagine and conceive of it.
Relax your efforts to reflect on and control it.
Be reverent and diligent
And its vital essence will naturally stabilize.
Grasp it and don't let go
Then the eyes and ears won't overflow
And the mind will have nothing else to seek.
When a properly aligned mind resides within you [正心在中],
The myriad things will be seen in their proper perspective. (tr. Roth 1999: 70) &lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Verse 14 describes this ''shen'' "numinous [mind]" as a nondual awareness of the Way: "Within the mind there is yet another mind. / That mind within the mind: it is an awareness that precedes words." (tr. Roth 1999: 72). This statement means the mind can be divided into two levels: empirical and transcendent. The former awaits transformation by the latter (Yang 2003: 104). The ''Neiye'''s privately practiced meditation, in which the ''shen'' settles into the practitioner's body, directly descends from the trance of the professional ''[[Wu (shaman)|wu]]'' "shaman; spirit medium" (Graham 1989: 101).

'''''[[Tao|Dao]]''''' "the Way" is a well-known [[List of English words of Chinese origin|Chinese loanword in English]] meaning "an absolute entity which is the source of the universe" (''[[OED]]''), but the ancient ''Neiye'' sometimes used it as an equivalent of the ''qi'', ''jing'', and ''shen'' that a practitioner works to cultivate (Kirkland 1997: 7-9). The ''Neiye'' describes the Way as a force that can enter or leave a person, and by engaging in specific self-cultivation practices one can make it come into direct experience or can keep it from going away (Roth 1999: 43).
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Clear! as though right by your side.
Vague! as though it will not be attained.
Indiscernible! as though beyond the limitless.
The test of this is not far off:
Daily we make use of its inner power [''de'' 德].
The Way is what infuses the body,
Yet people are unable to fix it in place.
It goes forth but does not return,
It comes back but does not stay.
Silent! none can hear its sound.
Suddenly stopping! it abides within the mind.
Obscure! we do not see its form.
Surging forth! it arises with us.
We do not see its form,
We do not hear its sound,
Yet we can perceive an order to its accomplishments.
We call it "the Way." (4, tr. Roth 1999: 52) &lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Thus, the term ''dao'' refers to a transient reality that a person needs to attract and to retain (Kirkland 1997: 13). The ''Neiye'' warns that forceful efforts cannot make the ''dao'' arrive or stay, only one's ''de'' "inner power" (see below) can attract it and other life forces (Kirkland 2008: 772).

''Neiye'' verse 4 above depicts the Way as the ineffable cosmic power familiar from other early Daoist texts like the ''Daodejing'', yet it has a much more tangible presence in the ''Neiye'' (Roth 1999: 102). Verse 5 says the Way is a constantly moving power that seems to come and go within the human mind.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;The Way has no fixed position;
It abides within the excellent mind [善心].
When the mind is tranquil and the vital breath is regular [心靜氣理],
The Way can thereby be halted.
That Way is not distant from us;
When people attain it they are sustained
That Way is not separated from us;
When people accord with it they are harmonious.
Therefore: Concentrated! as though you could be roped together with it.
Indiscernible! as though beyond all locations.
The true state of that Way:
How could it be conceived of and pronounced upon?
Cultivate your mind, make your thoughts tranquil [修心靜意],
And the Way can thereby be attained. (tr. Roth 1999: 54) &lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Although constantly moving in and out of one's mind, the Way can stay within it when one cultivates tranquility through the regular and systematic practice of breathing meditation. While the Way is always present, one is aware of this presence within the mind only when it is properly cultivated (Roth 1999: 103).

'''''[[De (Chinese)|De]]''''' "inner power" is a basic concept in traditional Daoism meaning "inherent character; inner moral power; virtue; integrity", but the ''Neiye'' used ''de'' to mean the "acquisitional agency" through which one can receive ''qi'', ''jing'', ''shen'', and ''dao'' (Kirkland 1997: 6). Thus, ''de'' "inner power" (which is [[cognate]] with ''de'' 得 "get; acquire"), is something that we "acquire" when all elements of the body/heart/mind are peaceful and aligned. Unlike other Daoist classics such as the ''Daodejing'' and ''Zhuangzi'' that describe ''de'' as intrinsic to everyone, the ''Neiye'' says one should practice daily self-control of thoughts and actions in order to build up one's ''de'' (Kirkland 1997: 7). Inner power is a distinct quality of mental concentration that arises naturally, along with tranquility, through the practice of proper posture and breathing meditation (Roth 1999: 105).
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;When your body is not aligned [形不正], 
The inner power will not come.
When you are not tranquil within [中不靜],
Your mind will not be well ordered.
Align your body, assist the inner power [正形攝德],
Then it will gradually come on its own. (Verse 11, tr. Roth 1999: 66) &lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This inner power can be thought of as a psychological condition of "focused and balanced awareness from which the adept is able to respond spontaneously and harmoniously to whatever arises" (Roth 1999: 126).

"Neiye" physiological concepts developed in the intellectual background of the 4th century BCE, a period when Chinese philosophers, notably the [[Ethical egoism|ethical egoist]] [[Yang Zhu]], first considered the question of maintaining one's own physical wellbeing (Harper 1998: 120). The chief innovation made in the "Neiye" is equating ''jing'' vital essence and ''qi'' vital breath/energy, which unites vital energy and essence with ''shen'' spirit/numen—thus naturalizing the old religious connotations of ''jing'' and ''shen'' into new physical meanings. This inventive physiological theory merged a person's physical and spiritual components, and made vital breath/energy the source of each. The "Neiye" opens with the statement that'' jing'' "vital essence" is the source of life. Then the text identifies the mind as the "lodging place for the vital essence", defines vital essence as the "essence of vital breath/energy", and links ''jing'' with the indwelling ''shen'' "spirit". ''De'' "inner power; virtue" serves as the mechanism by which the triad of vital energy, vital essence, and spirit are drawn to the body where they must be stored and concentrated in order to create a wellspring of vitality (Harper 1998: 119). The "Neiye" introduced the physiological theory that one could transform oneself into a sage through heartmind training that cultivates ''qi'' vital breath/energy, ''jing'' vital essence, and ''shen'' spirit/numen in the body (Harper 1998: 78, 112).

From a modern perspective, these 2500-year-old ''Neiye'' concepts seem enigmatic; ''qi'' "vital breath" constitutes both [[Mass–energy equivalence|matter and energy]], while ''xin'' "body/heart/mind" or [[bodymind]] circumvents [[Cartesian dualism]]. Owing to a [[semantic gap]] in the English lexicon, there is no standard word denoting the ancient Chinese ''Neiye'' worldview that spiritual life involves activities that also have physical components. Suggested [[protologisms]] include "biospiritual" (Kirkland 1997), "physio-spiritual" (Harper 1998),"psychophysiological" (Roth 1991), and "psychospiritual" (Roth 1999).

According to the ''Neiye'', there is a set of elusive life forces that enter and leave the human body, but will only remain within a person who has transformed him/herself into an efficient receptacle. For instance, "Cultivate your mind, make your thoughts tranquil, / And the Way can thereby be attained." (Verse 5), and "Diligently clean out [spirit's] lodging place / And its vital essence will naturally arrive." (13). Kirkland says a good analogy for these forces might be [[radio waves]] that continually flow through us but can only be utilized by a device that is properly [[Tuner (radio)|tuned]]. Figuratively, we are all radios that were originally fully operational, but now are experiencing [[Electromagnetic interference|electromagnetic interference]] caused by excessive heart/mind activity, and we need to retune ourselves to eliminate the disturbance and begin functioning properly again (1997: 14).

==Practices ==
[[File:Daoyin technique to assimilate Normal Qi, C19 Chinese MS Wellcome L0039800.jpg|thumb|[[Qing dynasty]] illustration of modern ''[[Daoyin]]'' technique for ''zhengqi'' 正氣 "aligning the vital energy"]]
The ''Neiye'' acclaims a variety of practices and techniques for acquiring, or metaphorically "tuning in" to, the subtle forces of the Way. Basic daily practices include proper alignment of one's body/heart/mind, breath meditation, and moderation in thinking and eating. 

Practicing ''zhèng'' 正 '"alignment" of bodymind in order to attain ''jìng'' 靜 "tranquility" (cf. later ''[[jingzuo]]'' "tranquil sitting" meditation) is one of the most important aims in the ''Neiye'', where the word ''zheng'' "to rectify; to square up; to center; to align" appears in 9 of the 26 verses and ''jing'' "still; quiet; calm; tranquil" in 11. "Fourfold Aligning" is the basic method of ''Neiye'' practice: ''zhengxing'' 正形 "aligning the body", ''zhengsiti[zhi]'' 正四體[肢] "aligning the four limbs", ''zhengqi'' 正氣 "aligning the vital energy", and ''zhengxin'' 正心 "aligning the mind" (Roth 1999: 109). Since the human body is believed to be imbued with ''qi'' vital energy, the term ''zhengxing'' refers to aligning or harmonizing the flow of vital energy within the physical form (''xing'' 形 literally means "form; shape"), while ''zhengxin'' refers to aligning the flow of vital energy within the mind (Roth 1991: 612).

"Aligning the body" and "aligning the four limbs" are closely related. The former appears in Verse 11 (above): "When your body is not aligned [形不正], / The inner power will not come. / When you are not tranquil within [中不靜], / Your mind will not be well ordered. / "Align your body, assist the inner power [正形攝德], / Then it will gradually come on its own." The latter alignment of arms and legs creates a figurative ''she'' 舍 "guest-house; lodging" for ''jing'' "vital essence" in Verse 8. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;If you can be aligned and be tranquil [能正能靜],
Only then can you be stable.
With a stable mind at your core [定心在中],
With the eyes and ears acute and clear,
And with the four limbs firm and fixed [四枝堅固],
You can thereby make a lodging place for the vital essence [可以為精舍].
The vital essence: it is the essence of the vital energy.
When the vital energy is guided, it [the vital essence] is generated,
But when it is generated, there is thought,
When there is thought, there is knowledge,
But when there is knowledge, then you must stop.
Whenever the forms of the mind have excessive knowledge,
You lose your vitality. (tr. Roth 1999: 60)&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In both these verses, being aligned precedes being tranquil, and thus developing a stabilized mind. ''Neiye'' "alignment" apparently refers to sitting in a steady posture with the limbs aligned or squared up with one another, comparable to the [[Vajrasana (yoga)|vajrasana]] posture in Buddhist meditation (Roth 1999: 110).

This ''Neiye'' metaphor of "make a lodging place for the vital essence" refers to the primary mystical praxis, which Verse 13 (above) symbolically describes, "Diligently clean out its [the bodily ''shen'''s] lodging place [敬除其舍] / And its vital essence will naturally arrive [精將自來]". The method of "cleaning out [''chú'' 除 "eliminate; remove; clean out"] the lodging place of the numinous" is essentially an [[Apophatic theology|apophatic]] process in which one "gradually and systematically removes the normal feelings, desires, thoughts, and perceptions that commonly occupy consciousness" (Roth 1999: 134). 

''Xinshu I'' repeats this ''Neiye'' metaphor: "The Tao is not far off, but it is hard to reach its limit. It rests together with man, but it is hard to grasp. Empty out your desires, and the numen will enter its abode. If the abode is not thoroughly swept clean, the numen will not remain there." (tr. Roth 1991: 623). It also adds recommendations to "open its doors" (the senses), "relinquish selfishness", and "stop talking" in order to give the practitioner ''shenming'' 神明 "numinous clarity" (Roth 1991: 625).

Systematic breath meditation practices in the ''Neiye'' usually involve sitting in a stable position, circulating and refining the ''qi'' "vital breath", in order to produce concentrated ''jing'' "vital essence", which is thought of as the material counterpart of psychological tranquility. Since vital essence is expended in everyday activities such perceiving, thinking, and feeling, one should minimize them. Aligning the body and emptying the mind will maximize physical vitality and psychological well-being (Roth 1999: 126).

''Neiye'' Verse 24 describes breath meditation practice in which the adept ''shouyi'' 守一 "maintains the One" and ''yunqi'' 運氣 "revolves the ''qi''", which brings about a profound tranquility. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;When you enlarge your mind and let go of it,
When you relax your vital breath and expand it,
When your body is calm and unmoving:
And you can maintain the One and discard the myriad disturbances.
You will see profit and not be enticed by it,
You will see harm and not be frightened by it.
Relaxed and unwound, yet acutely sensitive,
In solitude you delight in your own person.
This is called "revolving the vital breath":
Your thoughts and deeds seem heavenly. (24, tr. Roth 1999: 92) &lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Roth says this ancient reference to ''shouyi'', which later became a central tenet of Daoist and Chinese Buddhist meditation (Kohn 1989), describes a contemplative technique in which one sits calmly and exclusively concentrates on the Way, which enables one to set aside all the "disturbances of perceptions, thoughts, emotions, and desires that normally fill your conscious mind" (1999: 116).

Verse 17 provides specific details about regularized breath meditation. Breathing is said to "coil and uncoil" (''zhōu'' 周 "encircle; surround" and ''kuān'' 寬 "let go; release; stretch out; extend") or "contract and expand" (''mì'' 密 "snug; condense; squeezed together" and ''shū'' 舒 "stretch; spread out; expand; unfold"), with coiling/contracting referring to [[exhalation]] and uncoiling/expanding to [[inhalation]] (Roth 1991: 619).
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;For all [to practice] this Way:
You must coil, you must contract, 
You must uncoil, you must expand,
You must be firm, you must be regular [in this practice].
Hold fast to this excellent [practice]; do not let go of it.
Chase away the excessive; abandon the trivial.
And when you reach its ultimate limit
You will return to the Way and its inner power. (18, tr. Roth 1999: 78) &lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition to discussing mystical transformation through vital breath circulation, the ''Neiye'' recommends moderation in thought and diet so that the vital energy can flow freely and harmony can be achieved (Roth 1991: 619). For instance, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Deep thinking generates knowledge.
Idleness and carelessness generate worry.
Cruelty and arrogance generate resentment.
Worry and grief generate illness.
When illness reaches a distressing degree, you die.
When you think about something and don't let go of it,
Internally you will be distressed, externally you will be weak.
Do not plan things out in advance
Or else your vitality will cede its dwelling.
In eating, it is best not to fill up;
In thinking, it is best not to overdo.
Limit these to the appropriate degree
And you will naturally reach it [vitality]. (20, tr. Roth 1999: 84) &lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Neiye'' also discusses common health concerns such as the "way of eating".
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;For all the Way of eating [食之道] is that:
Overfilling yourself with food will impair your vital energy
And cause your body to deteriorate.
Overrestricting your consumption causes the bones to wither
And the blood to congeal.
The mean between overfilling and overrestricting:
This is called "harmonious completion."
It is where the vital essence lodges
And knowledge is generated. … (23, tr. Roth 1999: 90)&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
These holistic descriptions of harmonizing body, mind, and spirit are early references to the practice later called ''yǎngshēng'' 養生 "nourishing one's vital principle" (Roth 1999: 122).

==Influences==
The c. 4th-century ''Neiye'' had long-reaching effects on Daoism and Chinese culture. It influenced classic texts such as the ''Daodejing'' and ''Zhuangzi'', as well as what later became [[Daoist meditation]], ''[[Neidan]]'' "internal alchemy", ''[[Daoyin]]'', and [[Daoist diet]] practices. It also influenced theories about the [[Three Treasures (traditional Chinese medicine)|Three Treasures]] (''jīng-qì-shén'' 精氣神 "essence, vital energy, and spirit") in [[traditional Chinese medicine]], and may have impacted the Confucian teachings of [[Mencius]] (c. 372-c. 289 BCE) about cultivating the ''xin'' "heartmind" (Kirkland 2008: 771).

===Daoism===
The ''Neiye'' had a unique position in the history of [[Chinese philosophy]]. Compared with other [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] texts from the [[Warring States period]] (475-221 BCE), the ''Neiye'' does not mention many basic philosophical theories such as [[yin and yang]] (Rickett 1985-98: 155). The text is unconcerned with political philosophy; unlike the ''Daodejing'', which contains many passages discussing the problems involved with ruling a state (Kirkland 1997: 10). Nor does the ''Neiye'' criticize Confucianism, as the ''Daodejing'' and ''Zhuangzi'' frequently do. The Neiye contains no evidence that its authors or compilers were aware of the teachings from other current philosophical traditions, neither [[Confucianism]], [[Mohism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], nor the [[School of Yin Yang]] (Kirkland 2008: 772).

Another distinctive feature of the ''Neiye'' is that it lacks the early Chinese idea of ''[[Tian]]'' "Heaven" as a beneficent agency overseeing and guiding life. Both the Confucians and the Mohists shared ideas about ''Tian'' Heaven as the divine ruler and the ''Tianzi'' [[Son of Heaven]] as the earthly ruler (Kirkland 1997: 17). The character ''tian'' 天 appears in a number of ''Neiye'' passages, in which Roth translates it in the naturalistic sense as "the heavens" (for instance, "Bright!—as if ascending the heavens", Verse 2 above) rather than the usual deified "heaven; Heaven" (1999: 43). 

To illustrate the c. 4th-century BCE ''Neiye'''s effects on early Daoism, examples are given below from the c. 3rd-century BCE ''Daodejing'' and the c. 3rd/2nd-century BCE ''Zhuangzi''.

The ''Neiye'' and ''Daodejing'' have parallels as well as differences. Both texts contain teachings that originated in an oral tradition. The ''Neiye'', like much of the ''Daodejing'', is primarily composed in rhymed verse, and some scholars believe that certain sections may have been borrowed from an early Daoist hymn (Rickett 1985-98: 154). Harper suggests both texts were "canons of physical cultivation theory" meant for recitation by initiates who could have received fuller knowledge of its meaning either orally or in supplementary texts (1987: 561).

Both texts also share a conception of ''Dao'' "the Way" as the ultimate power through which everything generates and develops (Roth 1999: 145). Compare how they describe the Way and the ''wanwu'' 萬物 "myriad things": "The myriad things are generated by it" and "The myriad things are completed by it" (''Neiye'' verse 6) and "The Way gives birth to them, nourishes them, matures them, completes them, rests them, rears them, supports them, and protects them" (''Daodejing'' chapter 51). Both texts also similarly describe the concept of ''de'' "inner power". In the ''Neiye'' (verses 4 and 2), ''de'' is the aspect of the Way that we "daily make use of" and which we develop through refining the ''qi'' vital breath into the ''jing'' vital essence through breath meditation. The ''Daodejing'' (chapter 55) also links ''de'' and ''jing'' comparing one "who is filled with an abundance of inner power" with the newborn babe in whom the vital essence is maximized. The ''Neijing'''s emphasis on the importance of attaining ''jing'' tranquility through breath meditation is also found in the ''Daodejing'', where the term occurs in 7 of the 81 chapters, for instance, to "maintain tranquility is the central (practice)" (16, tr. Roth 1999: 147).

The most explicit ''Daodejing'' reference to practicing breath meditation contains three phrases with close parallels to the ''Neiye''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Amid the daily activity of the psyche, can you embrace the One and not depart from it?
When concentrating your vital breath until it is at its softest, can you be like a child?
Can you sweep clean your Profound Mirror so you are able to have no flaws in it?
In loving the people and governing the state, can you do it without using knowledge?
When the Gates of Heaven open and close, can you become feminine?
In clarifying all within the Four Directions, can you do it without using knowledge? (chapter 10, tr. Roth 1999: 150; cf. Mair 1994: 69) &lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
First, this ''Daodejing'' term ''baoyi'' 抱一 "embracing the One" parallels the ''Neiye'' ''zhiyi'' 執一 "hold fast to the One" (verse 9, tr. Roth 1999: 62), and both terms refer to retaining a sense of union with the Way in everyday life. Second, ''zhuanqi'' 專氣 "concentrating the vital breath (until it is at its softest)" closely resembles ''tuanqi'' 摶氣 "concentrating your vital breath (as if numinous)" denoting to the practice of breath meditation (19, tr. Roth 1999: 82). Third, ''dichu xuanjian'' 滌除玄覽 " sweep clean your Profound Mirror" and the distinctive ''Neiye'' metaphor ''jingchu qi she'' 敬除其舍 "diligently clean out its lodging place" (13, tr. Roth 1999: 70) share the same syntax and verb ''chu'' "eliminate; remove". These three textual counterparts demonstrate that the redactors of both the ''Neiye'' and ''Daodejing'' shared knowledge of traditional proto-Daoist meditation techniques through which one could directly experience the Way and its inner power (Roth 1999: 152). 

Notwithstanding these similarities and parallels, there are significant differences between the two texts. As already mentioned, the ''Neiye'' contains virtually no political philosophy, which is a major focus in the ''Daodejing''. There is no trace in the ''Neiye'' of many now-famous themes of the ''Daodejing'', such as ''[[Mu (negative)|wu]]'' "non-being", ''[[ziran]]'' "naturally; spontaneously", ''[[wu wei|wuwei]]'' "non-interference", ''[[Pu (Daoism)|pu]]'' "uncarved; unhewn", ''[[Xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' "transcendent; immortal", and ''xu'' 虛 "emptiness" (Kirkland 2008: 772-773). Unlike the ''Daodejing'' gender-based concepts of the Dao as mother, the Mysterious Female, and "feminine" behaviors such as humility or yielding, the ''Neiye'' has nothing to say about gender, which hints that women as well as men may have engaged in mediation practices (Kirkland 1997: 16).

In addition, the authors/compilers of the ''Zhuangzi'' were clearly familiar with ''Neiye'' inner cultivation practices. The ''Zhuangzi'' text contains both weak and strong evidence of meditation techniques shared with the ''Neiye''. Some passages contain similar terminology and others use sentences that are almost identical with those in the ''Neiye'' (Roth 1999: 153). Here are two examples.

In the first passage, the character Wearcoat (被衣) instructs Gnaw Gap (齧缺) about the Way. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;You must align your body [正汝形],
Unify your vision,
And the heavenly harmony will arrive.
Gather in your knowledge,
Unify your attention, 
And the numinous will enter its lodging place [神將來舍],
The inner power will beautify you,
And the Way will reside in you.
You will see things with the eyes of a newborn calf
And will not seek out their precedents. (22, tr. Roth 1999: 158; cf. Mair 1994: 213-214) &lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
''Zhengxing'' 正形 "aligning the body" is a basic ''Neiye'' practice, and ''jing chu qi she'' 敬除其舍 "cleaning out the lodging place of the numinous" resembles this ''shen jianglai she'' 神將來舍 "the numinous will enter its lodging place".

In the second ''Zhuangzi'' passage, Laozi instructs Nanrong Zhu (南榮趎) about meditation practices by paraphrasing, if not quoting, the ''Neiye''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;The practice for guarding vitality [衛生之經]:
Can you embrace the One [能抱一乎]?
Can you not lose it [能勿失乎]?
Can you not resort to divining by tortoise or milfoil [能無卜筮]?
Yet know good and bad fortune [而知吉凶乎]?
Can you be still? Can you cease [能止乎能已乎]?
Can you quit (seeking for) it in others [能舍諸人]
And seek for within yourself [而求諸己乎]?
Can you be casual?
Can you be naive?
Can you be like a child?
The child howls all day but its throat does not become hoarse. (tr. Roth 1999: 159)&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
These ''Zhuangzi'' instructions are an almost verbatim repetition of ''Neiye'' Verse 19.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;By concentrating your vital breath as if numinous, 
The myriad things will all be contained within you.
Can you concentrate? Can you unite with them [能一乎]?
Can you not resort to divining by tortoise or milfoil [能無卜筮]?
Yet know bad and good fortune [而知吉凶乎]?
Can you stop? Can you cease [能止乎能已乎]?
Can you not seek it in others [能勿求諸人]?,
Yet attain it within yourself [而得之己乎]? … (tr. Roth 1999: 82)&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Based upon the remarkable correspondences between these contexts, the authors of this ''Zhuangzi'' chapter were unquestionably familiar with the ''Neiye'' or a similar text (Roth 1999: 160).

The contents of the ''Neiye'' are distinct from either the ''Daodejing'' or the ''Zhuangzi'', despite the striking similarities among the texts. Since the ''Neiye'' was written earlier than the ''Daodejing'', Kirkland proposes that it could be interpreted as an example of the earliest known Daoist teachings. Since the compilers of the ''Daodejing'' were clearly interested in the same social and political issues that concerned members of other philosophical schools, one could reasonably characterize the teachings of the ''Neiye'' as "original Daoism," and the teachings of the ''Daodejing'' as "applied Daoism." Although both texts apparently developed from the same general tradition, the ''Neiye'' compilers were primarily interested in self-cultivation practices, the ''Daodejing'' compilers were also interested in the broader issues of living in human society (Roth 1997: 18-19).

===Mencius===
There is evidence that the ''Neiye'' also influenced the teachings of [[Mencius]] (c. 370-c. 290 BCE) on cultivating the ''xin'' heartmind and building up ''qi'', which later developed into [[Neo-Confucian]] ideals of self-cultivation (Kirkland 2008: 771). In the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]'', Mencius tells his disciple Gongsun Chou 公孫丑, "At forty, I attained to an unperturbed mind [''budong xin'' 不動心]" adding that attaining it is not difficult and another disciple [[Gaozi]] achieved it at a younger age. Mencius also says, "I am good at nourishing my flood-like ''ch'i'' [''haoran zhi qi'' 浩然之氣]". When asked what that means, he explains,
&lt;blockquote&gt; A hard thing to speak of. It is the sort of ''ch'i'' which is utmost in vastness, utmost in firmness. If by uprightness you nourish it and do not interfere with it, it stuffs the space between heaven and earth. It is the sort of ''ch'i'' which matches the right with the Way; without these it starves. It is generated by accumulation of rightdoing, it is not that by sporadic rightdoing one makes a grab at it. If anything in conduct is dissatisfying to the heart it starves. That is why I say that [Gaozi] has never understood the right, because he thinks it external. There must be work for it, but do not adjust its course; do not let your heart forget it, but do not help it to grow. (2A.2, tr. Graham 1989: 127, cf. Legge 1875: 165) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Mencius's description of a sage's ''qi'' vital energy as ''haoran'' 浩然 "flood-like" was likely taken from this ''Neiye'' passage: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;For those who preserve and naturally generate vital essence 
On the outside a calmness will flourish. 
Stored inside, we take it to be the well spring. 
Floodlike, it harmonizes and equalizes [浩然和平]
And we take it to be the fount of the vital energy. (15, tr. Roth 1999: 74) &lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Graham dates the ''Neiye'' from the 4th century BCE, and says its practices may predate the hypothetical split between Confucianism and Daoism (1989: 100).

Another ''Neiye''-''Mencius'' textual parallel exists between "By concentrating your vital breath as if numinous, / The myriad things will all be contained within you [摶氣如神萬物備存]." (19, tr. Roth 1999: 82, see ''Zhuangzi'' above) and "Mencius said, 'The myriad things are all here at my disposal in myself [萬物皆備於我矣]. There is no greater joy than to look back into oneself and find integrity'." (7A/4, tr. Graham 1989: 127, cf. Legge 1875: 345) 

Both the ''Neiye'' and ''Mencius'' assume that one is born with an inherently perfect heartmind, and when one becomes confused that perfection is lost, but one can return to the original state of heart/mind by allowing an inherent harmony to replace the confusion. Kirkland reasons that since these ideas seem more integral to the teachings of the ''Neiye'', it is logical to conclude that the ideas, if not the text itself, may have been known to Mencius or at least to his text's compilers (1997: 3, 11).

===Excavated texts===
[[File:Qigong taiji meditation.jpg|thumb|Portion of the ''[[Tao yin#The Daoyintu|Daoyin tu]]'' Drawings of Guiding and Pulling in the [[Mawangdui Silk Texts]]]]
The c. 4th century BCE ''Neiye'' is connected with a corpus of 2nd century BCE medical and physical cultivation texts that archaeologists discovered in [[Western Han dynasty]] tombs. The c. 168 BCE [[Mawangdui Silk Texts]], excavated in 1973 near [[Changsha]], [[Hunan]], include several previously-unknown medical texts, such as the ''[[Wushi'er Bingfang]]'' "Recipes for Fifty-Two Ailments" and ''Shiwen'' 十問 "Ten Questions". The c. 186 BCE [[Zhangjiashan Han bamboo texts]], excavated in 1983 near [[Linyi]], [[Hubei]], include additional writings on medicine and health. One of the most widely known Mawangdui silk texts is the ''[[Tao yin#The Daoyintu|Daoyin tu]]'' 導引圖 "Drawings of Guiding and Pulling" that illustrates 44 sitting and standing ''[[tao yin|daoyin]]'' exercises.

The psychophysiological cultivation practices in the ''Neiye'' and the Mawangdui and Zhangjiashan texts have numerous parallels. They share technical vocabulary for breath cultivation, particularly the three basic elements of human physiology: ''qi'' vital energy, ''jing'' vital essence, and ''shen'' spirit. The texts also similarly describe circulating the vital energy in a stable, sitting posture with the spine erect (Roth 1999: 110, 168). Furthermore, the ''Neiye'' and the Mawangdui [[Huangdi Sijing#The four texts|Four Texts]] manuscript share a rhyme scheme associated with the state of [[Chu (state)|Chu]], and contain identical passages, thus indicating "an affinity that is too close to be a matter of chance" (Rickett 1993: 248-249).

However, the ''Neiye'' and the excavated texts give different purposes for practicing inner cultivation. The Mawangdui and Zhangjiashan manuscripts are primarily concerned with goals of better health and longer life; although the ''Neiye'' occasionally mentions the physical benefits of breath cultivation, its goals are more psychological and spiritual (Roth 1999: 169). For example, the Mawangdui text that most closely resembles the ''Neiye'' is the ''Shiwen'' Ten Questions. While both mention ''tuanqi'' 摶氣 "concentrating your vital breath", it is done in order to attain the Way in the ''Neiye'' but to achieve longevity in the ''Shiwen'' (19, tr. Roth 1999: 82). Both texts describe ''jing'' as being like a ''quanyuan'' 泉原 "wellspring", but in the ''Neiye'' vital essence is generated in order to attain tranquility (15, Roth 1999: 74), while in the ''Shiwen'' it is generated by "sucking in vital energy" and circulating it into the extremities (Roth 1999: 169).

Unlike the "Neiye" that discourses on philosophical and mystical concepts of human physiology, the Mawangdui and Zhangjiashan texts focus on teaching practical techniques for bodily care and long life. Based on the "Neiye" text, Harper thinks that Warring States cultivation theory and practice was an esoteric tradition with few actual practitioners. The Mawangdui and Zhangjiashan texts suggest that physical cultivation was popular in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE (1998: 126). While the excavated texts do not mention how many people practiced the techniques and recipes, the literature was clearly available and represented a kind of "baseline macrobiotic hygiene for the elite" (Harper 1998: 114).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1498">'''''Nomological danglers''''' is a term used by Scottish-Australian philosopher [[J._J._C._Smart|J.J.C. Smart]] in his article ''Sensations and Brain Processes''. He credits the term to [[Herbert Feigl]] and his article ''The "Mental" and the "Physical"''. It refers to the occurrence of something (in this case a sensation), which does not fit into the system of established laws. He thinks that systems in which such "nomological danglers would dangle" are quite odd. In his example the nomological danglers would be sensations such that are not able to be explained by the scientific theory of brain processes. Some mental entities for example in a phenomenological field, are not able to be found (and do not behave in the way that is expected) in physics. In the context Smart uses it, he is criticising [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] and [[epiphenomenalism]] as philosophies of mind, and the concerns over physical and causal laws they raise. Smart puts forward his own theory in the form of [[Materialism]], claiming it is a better theory, in part because it is free from these nomological danglers, making it superior in accordance with [[Occam's Razor]].

'''Numinous''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|nj|uː|m|ᵻ|n|ə|s}}) is an English adjective, derived from the Latin ''[[numen]]'', meaning "arousing spiritual or religious emotion; mysterious or awe-inspiring".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Collins English Dictionary -7th ed. - 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
''Numinous'' is an English adjective, derived in the 17th century from the Latin ''[[numen]]'', that is (especially in ancient Roman religion) a "deity or spirit presiding over a thing or space".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Meaning "denoting or relating to a numen", it describes the power or presence or realisation of a [[divinity]]. It is [[etymology|etymologically]] unrelated to Immanuel Kant's ''[[noumenon]]'', a Greek term referring to an unknowable reality underlying all things.

==Popularization==
The word was popularized by the German theologian [[Rudolf Otto]] in his influential 1917 book ''Das Heilige'', which appeared in English as ''[[Rudolf Otto#The Idea of the Holy|The Idea of the Holy]]'' in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Otto|first=Rudolf |editor-first=Gregory D. |editor-last=Alles |title=Autobiographical and Social Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D13tugwJcY0C&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=1996 |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]] |location=Berlin |id={{ISBN|3-11014519-7}} |isbn=978-3-110-14519-9|quote=[https://books.google.com/books?id=D13tugwJcY0C&amp;q=numinous ''numinous''].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otto writes that while the concept of "the holy" is often used to convey moral perfection – and does entail this – it contains another distinct element, beyond the ethical sphere, for which he uses the term numinous.&lt;ref name="idea-holy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Otto|first1=Rudolf|title=The Idea of the Holy|date=1923|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-500210-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/theideaoftheholy00ottouoft |accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5–7}} He explains the numinous as a "non-rational, non-sensory experience or feeling whose primary and immediate object is outside the self". This mental state "presents itself as ''ganz Andere'',&lt;ref&gt;Otto, Rudolf (1996). p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=D13tugwJcY0C&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=%22ganz+andere%22%22ganz+an%22%22ders+%5bwholly+other%5d%22 30].&lt;/ref&gt; wholly other, a condition absolutely ''[[sui generis]]'' and incomparable whereby the human being finds himself utterly abashed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Alice L.|last1=Eckardt|first2=A.

In other words, our ''X'' cannot, strictly speaking, be taught, it can only be evoked, awakened in the mind."&lt;ref name="idea-holy"/&gt;{{rp|7}} Chapters 4 to 6 are devoted to attempting to evoke the numinous and its various aspects. Using Latin, he describes it as a mystery ({{lang-la|[[wikt:mysterium#Latin|mysterium]]}}) that is at once terrifying (''[[wikt:tremendum|tremendum]]'') and fascinating (''[[wikt:fascinans|fascinans]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Otto, Rudolf (1996). [https://books.google.com/books?&amp;id=D13tugwJcY0C&amp;q=%22mysterium+tremendum+et+fascinans%22 ''Mysterium tremendum et fascinans''].&lt;/ref&gt; He writes:

{{Quote|The feeling of it may at times come sweeping like a gentle tide pervading the mind with a tranquil mood of deepest worship. It may pass over into a more set and lasting attitude of the soul, continuing, as it were, thrillingly vibrant and resonant, until at last it dies away and the soul resumes its “profane,” non-religious mood of everyday experience. [...] It has its crude, barbaric antecedents and early manifestations, and again it may be developed into something beautiful and pure and glorious. It may become the hushed, trembling, and speechless humility of the creature in the presence of—whom or what? In the presence of that which is a Mystery inexpressible and above all creatures.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Meland|first1=Bernard E.|title=Rudolf Otto {{!}} German philosopher and theologian|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Rudolf-Otto|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Online]]|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="idea-holy"/&gt;{{rp|12–13}}}}

[[C.S. Lewis]] described the numinous experience as follows in ''[[The Problem of Pain]]'':
{{quote|Suppose you were told there was a tiger in the next room: you would know that you were in danger and would probably feel fear.  But if you were told "There is a ghost in the next room," and believed it, you would feel, indeed, what is often called fear, but of a different kind. It would not be based on the knowledge of danger, for no one is primarily afraid of what a ghost may do to him, but of the mere fact that it is a ghost.  It is "uncanny" rather than dangerous, and the special kind of fear it excites may be called Dread.  With the Uncanny one has reached the fringes of the Numinous. Now suppose that you were told simply "There is a mighty spirit in the room," and believed it. Your feelings would then be even less like the mere fear of danger: but the disturbance would be profound. You would feel wonder and a certain shrinking—a sense of inadequacy to cope with such a visitant and of prostration before it—an emotion which might be expressed in Shakespeare's words "Under it my genius is rebuked." This feeling may be described as awe, and the object which excites it as the ''Numinous.''&lt;ref name="csl"&gt;Lewis, C.S. (2001) [1940].

==References to the concept==
Otto's use of the term as referring to a characteristic of [[religious experience]] was influential among certain intellectuals of the subsequent generation.&lt;ref name="yourdiction"&gt;{{cite web|title=Louis Karl Rudolf Otto Facts|url=http://biography.yourdictionary.com/louis-karl-rudolf-otto|website=YourDictionary.com|publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="encyc-com"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Alles |first=Gregory D. |title=Otto, Rudolf |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion | location=[[Farmington Hills, Michigan]] |publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Thomson Gale]] |date=2005 |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/otto-rudolf |accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "numinous" as understood by Otto was a frequently quoted concept in the writings of [[Carl Jung]],&lt;ref&gt;Jung, "Collected Works" vol. 11 (1969), "A Psychological Approach to the Dogma of the Trinity" (1948), ¶222-225 (p.149).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4898">'''Philosophy of motion''' is a branch of philosophy concerned with exploring questions on the existence and nature of motion. The central questions of this study concern the [[epistemology]] and ontology of motion, whether motion exists as we perceive it, what is it, and, if it exists,  how does it occur. The philosophy of motion is important in the study of theories of change in natural systems and is closely connected to studies of space and time in philosophy.

The philosophy of motion was of central concern to Ancient Greek and Roman philosophers, particularly the [[pre-Socratic]] philosophers such as [[Parmenides]], [[Zeno of Elea]], [[Heraclitus]] and [[Democritus]].  As such, it was influential in the development of the philosophy of science in general.

==Early history==
===The Greek Physiology===

The concept of motion is closely related to the idea of change, and it is arguments about what made change possible that led the early Greek philosophers to pioneer naturalistic explanations for phenomena.

Heraclitus had famously declared that "all is motion".

Parmenides professed that from our human point of view there are two aspects to the study of the universe of which we must be aware, on the one hand how we see it, and on the other how it must really be. Motion is a fact from our point of view, but Parmenides argues that as far as things must really be, it is logically impossible that motion could exist as we perceive it.

Zeno of Elea, a pupil of Parmenides, formulated the Arguments against motion, more commonly referred to as the [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]], in order to support his masters theories of the One and of the consequent impossibility of motion at the fundamental level. The rigorous denial of even the possibility of motion forced a more thorough response from philosophers engaged on the same theoretical project.

====Atomism and Determinism====
In response, Democritus expounded the [[atomic theory]], in which indivisible bits of matter are in constant motion through the void. In the absence of something to perturb them they fall evenly through space.

Motion conceived in this way led naturally to questions of [[free will]] and [[determinism]]. In response to this, [[Epicurus]] appears to have included the concept of the [[clinamen]], or atomic swerve. This tiny random motion serves to bring atoms into contact and begin the cascade that leads to the organisation of matter as we see it now., it also introduced an element of uncertainty which appears to have been an important concept in Epicurus' insistence on the existence of individual choice.

===Later Development===
[[Aristotle]], in his physics, defines motion  as the actuality of a potentiality.

===Buddhist===
The philosophy of motion is treated by the [[Buddhist]] philosopher [[Nagarjuna]] in his treatise the [[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]] or Fundamental verses of the [[Middle Way]], in the 2nd and 3rd century CE.

Further east, in China, the [[Sanlun]] school of [[Mahayana]] Buddhism developed a sophisticated philosophy of motion under the philosopher [[Sengzhao]]. His treatise called The Immutability of Things, deals with motion explicitly.

===Aztec===
Aztec metaphysics gave priority to motion over substance in its cosmological [[ontology]]. In other words, process was seen to be fundamental and objects or substances as ephemeral. Change therefore was naturally conceived of as motion, and this motion was divided into three forms, out of which all change occurs. These were named olin (bouncing, oscillating) malinalli (spinning, twisting, spiralling) and, the most important, nepantla (weaving, intersecting, joining, balancing).&lt;ref&gt;https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/53017-aztec-philosophy-understanding-a-world-in-motion/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval==
* [[Maimonides]]
* [[Averroes]]
* [[Thomas Aquinas]]

==Modern==
Achieving a coherent understanding of motion has been, and continues to be, of importance in understanding the nature of space and time in modern science.{{According to whom|date=November 2015}} The main philosophical debate has been between absolute and relational conceptions of motion.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spacetime-theories/&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Descartes]]
* [[Leibniz]]
* [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]
* [[Ernst Mach|Mach]]
* [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]
* [[Chaos theory]]
* Astronomy

===Biology===
Motion in [[complex systems]] such as protein folding.

===Evolution===
Morphogenesis of animal bodies and change on large and small scales. Niche construction.

===Scale relativity===
The work of Nottale.

===Quantum physics===
Questions of the nature of motion continue to arise in modern physics, with many of the issues of concern to early thinkers arising in different form. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and the clinamen of the Epicureans.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3179">'''Postnormal times''' ('''PNT''') is a concept developed by [[Ziauddin Sardar]] as a development of [[Post-normal Science]]. Sardar describes the present as "postnormal times", "in an in-between period where old orthodoxies are dying, new ones have yet to be born, and very few things seem to make sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sardar|first1=Ziauddin|title=Welcome to postnormal times|journal=Futures|date=June 2010|volume=42|issue=5|pages=435–444|doi=10.1016/j.futures.2009.11.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
In support of engaging communities of various scope and scale on how to best navigate PNT and imagine preferred pathways toward the future(s), Sardar and Sweeney published an article in the journal ''[[Futures (journal)|Futures]]'' outlining The Three Tomorrows method, which fills a gap in the field as "many methods of futures and foresight seldom incorporate pluralism and diversity intrinsically in their frameworks, and few, if any, emphasize the dynamic and merging nature of futures possibilities, or highlight the ignorance and uncertainties we constantly confront."&lt;ref&gt;Ziauddin Sardar &amp; John A. Sweeney, "The Three Tomorrows of Postnormal Times," Futures 75(2016) 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John A. Sweeney, "Signs of postnormal times," East-West Affairs 1, no. 3/4(2013).''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory and criticism==
Rakesh Kapoor criticized PNT in 2011 as a Western concept, that does not apply to India and other [[emerging market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Rakesh Kapoor, "Is there a postnormal time? From the illusion of normality to the design for a new normality," Futures 43(2011) 216-220. &lt;/ref&gt; Sam Cole criticised the three C’s of PNT (chaos, complexity and contradictions) as "Alliterative Logic, theorizing through alliterative word-triads that is not based on empirical evidence".&lt;ref&gt;Sam Cole, "Alliterative logic: A theory of postnormal times," Futures 43(2011) 209-215.&lt;/ref&gt; Jay Gray has suggested that PNT is embryonic, needs a more robust framework, and should be extended to include [[C. S. Holling|C S Holling's]] adaptive cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Jay E. Gary, "Toward a new macrohistory: An extension to Sardar’s ‘postnormal times,’" Futures 43(2011) 48-51. &lt;/ref&gt; Scientists working on complex evolving systems have pointed out that PNT recalls the ‘Long Waves’ of [[Kondratiev wave|Kondratiev]] and [[Joseph Schumpeter]]’s view of waves of "creative destruction."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Allen and Liz Varga, "Modelling sustainable energy futures for the UK," Futures 57(2014) 28-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

PNT is one of the core areas of research for the Center for Postnormal Policy and Futures Studies at [[East-West University]] in [[Chicago]], Illinois, US. A number of articles and editorials on PNT have been published in the journal ''East-West Affairs''.

QAnon's posting campaign has a history of false, baseless and unsubstantiated claims. Starting with the first posts incorrectly predicting [[Hillary Clinton]]'s imminent arrest and followed by more false allegations, such as claiming that [[North Korea]]n [[List of leaders of North Korea|Supreme Leader]] [[Kim Jong-un]] is a [[puppet ruler]] installed by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ywex8v/what-is-qanon-conspiracy-theory|title=A Guide to QAnon, the New King of Right-Wing Conspiracy Theories|last=Caffier|first=Justin|date=June 12, 2018|work=Vice|access-date=July 15, 2018|language=en-us|issn=1077-6788}}&lt;/ref&gt; QAnon's posts have become more cryptic and vague allowing followers to map their own beliefs into them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2018/08/01/how-qanon-the-conspiracy-theory-spawned-by-a-trump-quip-got-so-big-and-scary/|title=How QAnon, the conspiracy theory spawned by a Trump quip, got so big and scary|last=Selk|first=Avi|last2=Ohlheiser|first2=Abby|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; By generating a keyboard heatmap of QAnon's supposedly coded messages, [[information security]] researcher Mark Burnett concluded that they "are not actual codes, just random typing by someone who might play an instrument and uses a [[QWERTY]] keyboard", adding that "almost all the characters" in the codes alternate between the left and right hands, or the characters are close to each other on the keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90219187/qanons-codes-are-probably-just-random-typing-says-researcher|title=QAnon's "codes" are probably just random typing, says researcher|date=August 15, 2018|last=Grothaus|first=Michael|author-link=Michael Grothaus|work=Fast Company|access-date=August 16, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of QAnon's more concrete allegations include his February 16, 2018 false claim that [[U.S. Representative]] and former [[Democratic National Committee]] chairwoman [[Debbie Wasserman Schultz]] hired [[El Salvador]]ian gang [[MS-13]] to murder DNC staffer [[Seth Rich]],&lt;ref name="newsweek" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/qanon-the-storm/|title=The QAnon Conspiracy Is the Oldest Scam Out There|last=Rothschild|first=Mike|date=March 19, 2018|work=The Daily Dot|access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his March 1, 2018 apparent suggestion that [[Chancellor of Germany|German Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] is the [[Hitler family|granddaughter]] of [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://444.hu/2018/08/07/trump-tamogatoi-kozott-elkezdett-terjedni-hogy-az-elnok-az-egyesult-allamokat-iranyito-satanista-pedofilok-ellen-harcol|title=Trump támogatói között elkezdett terjedni, hogy az elnök az Egyesült Államokat irányító sátánista pedofilok ellen harcol - 444|last=Király|first=Attila|date=August 7, 2018|work=444|access-date=September 19, 2018|language=hu-HU|trans-title=Trump supporters have started to spread their belief that the President fights against Satanist pedophiles who govern the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; A July 7, 2018 article published in ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' also noted that QAnon falsely claimed that "each mass shooting is a [[False flag|false-flag]] attack organized by the cabal".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/what-is-qanon-the-craziest-theory-of-the-trump-era-explained|title=What Is QAnon?

According to this idea, the [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–present)|Mueller investigation]] is actually a countercoup led by Donald Trump, who pretended to collude with Russia in order to hire Robert Mueller to secretly investigate the Democrats.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Another recurring theme is that certain Hollywood stars are pedophiles, and that the [[Rothschild family]] are the leaders of a [[Satanic ritual abuse|satanic cult]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; By interpreting the information fed to them by Q, QAnon adherents come to these conclusions.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

On multiple occasions, QAnon has dismissed his false claims and incorrect predictions as wilful misinformation, claiming that "disinformation is necessary".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/a-new-wave-of-qanon-activists-emerge-from-the-cult-of-maga/|title=A New Wave Of ‘QAnon’ Activists Emerge From The Cult Of MAGA|work=Right Wing Watch|last=Holt|first=Jared|date=July 9, 2018|access-date=September 21, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led [[Australia]]n psychologist [[Stephan Lewandowsky]] to emphasize the "self-sealing" quality of the conspiracy theory, highlighting its anonymous purveyor's use of [[plausible deniability]] and noting that evidence against the theory "can become evidence of [its] validity in the minds of believers".&lt;ref name="vox" /&gt;

==Identity==
There has been much speculation regarding the motive and the identity of the poster, with theories ranging from the poster being a military intelligence officer, to Donald Trump himself, to the posting campaign being an [[alternate reality game]] by [[Cicada 3301]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/who-is-q-anon/|title=Who is Q Anon, the internet's most mysterious poster?|last=Rothschild|first=Mike|date=May 29, 2018|work=The Daily Dot|access-date=July 5, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because [[4chan]] is anonymous and does not allow registration by users, any number of individuals may post using the same handle. The poster uses a frequently changing [[tripcode]] to authenticate himself on [[8chan]].

The Italian leftist [[Wu Ming]] foundation has speculated that QAnon has been inspired by the [[Luther Blissett (nom de plume)|Luther Blissett]] persona, which was used by leftists and anarchists to organize pranks, media stunts, and hoaxes in the 1990s. "Blissett" also published the novel ''[[Q (novel)|Q]]'' in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Broderick |first1=Ryan |title=People Think This Whole QAnon Conspiracy Theory Is A Prank On Trump Supporters |url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/its-looking-extremely-likely-that-qanon-is-probably-a |accessdate=14 August 2018 |work=BuzzFeed News |date=6 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, [[Jack Posobiec]], a conspiracy theorist and correspondent for [[One America News Network]], claimed to know the identity of the creators of QAnon. According to him, the phenomenon was started by two pro-Trump Twitter trolls who intended to generate enthusiasm among Trump supporters following the [[Unite the Right rally]], which was viewed as a disaster for the far-right. Posobiec claims that the letter Q was indeed chosen due to the Italian novel, and that the conspiracy theory was carefully assembled from pieces of Wikileaks information drops, Pizzagate, and [[Infowars]] rhetoric. After the original authors ended their involvement, a new group – supposedly called ″the Patriot Soapbox group″ – continued it and moved to an 8chan board moderated by them, apparently in an effort to make money. (On 8chan, users are allowed to set up and moderate their own boards, whereas boards and moderation on 4chan are completely controlled by the site staff.) The profit-oriented approach to QAnon has since then been joined by others, including a person who sells ″exclusive Q decodes″ via [[Patreon]].&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oann.com/exposed-creator-of-qanon-speaks-for-the-first-time/|title=Exposed – Creator of QAnon Speaks for the First Time|last=Posobiec |first=Jack|date=September 5, 2018|website=One America News Network|accessdate=November 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 15, 2018, Apple pulled the app after an inquiry from [[NBC News]].&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/exclusive-apple-google-cashed-pizzagate-offshoot-conspiracy-app-n891726|title=Apple, Google cashed in on Pizzagate-offshoot conspiracy app|last=Collins|first=Ben|date=July 16, 2018|access-date=July 19, 2018|publisher=NBC News|last2=Zadrozny|first2=Brandy|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Targeting of Michael Avenatti ===
{{tweet|name=Michael Avenatti|username=MichaelAvenatti|date=Jul 30, 2018|text=We are trying to identify the man in this picture, which was taken outside my office yesterday (Sun) afternoon.

On July 29, 2018, Q posted a link to [[Stormy Daniels]]' attorney [[Michael Avenatti]]'s website and photos of his [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]], [[California]], office building, along with the message, "Buckle up!". The anonymous poster then shared the picture of an as-of-yet unidentified man, appearing to be holding a cellphone in one hand, and a long, thin object in the other, standing in the street near Avenatti's office, adding that a message "had been sent". This sparked an investigation by the [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]] [[Police Department]]. On July 30, Avenatti asked his Twitter followers to contact the Newport Beach Police Department if they "have any details or observed" the man in the picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/01/us/youtube-qanon-8chan-conspiracy-theory-trnd/index.html|title=How a right-wing conspiracy theory is going mainstream|last=Mezzofiore|first=Gianluca|date=August 3, 2018|work=CNN|access-date=September 19, 2018|last2=Lear|first2=Justin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/avenatti-targeted-in-person-by-qanon-the-crazy-pro-trump-conspiracy-theory|title=Michael Avenatti Targeted in Person by QAnon, the Crazy Pro-Trump Conspiracy Theory|last=Sommer|first=Will|date=July 30, 2018|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=September 19, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thinkprogress.org/stormy-daniels-lawyer-targeted-by-qanon-conspiracy-theory-d2b1f07d0e1f/|title=Stormy Daniels’ lawyer targeted by supporters of pro-Trump conspiracy theory|last=Barnes|first=Luke|date=July 31, 2018|work=ThinkProgress|access-date=September 19, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harassment of Jim Acosta===
On August 1, 2018, responding to a question by [[David Martosko]] of ''[[Daily Mail|The Daily Mail]]'' asking if the White House encouraged the support of "QAnon fringe groups"—in light of their hostile behavior toward [[CNN]] chief [[White House correspondent]] [[Jim Acosta]] at a [[List of post-election Donald Trump rallies|Trump rally]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/trump-florida-rally-supporters-cnn-jim-acosta-tampa-maga-a8472436.html|title=Trump supporters filmed hurling sustained abuse at journalists following 'Make America Great Again' rally|last=Embury-Dennis|first=Tom|date=August 1, 2018|work=The Independent|access-date=August 1, 2018|language=en-GB|issn=0951-9467}}&lt;/ref&gt;—[[White House Press Secretary]] [[Sarah Huckabee Sanders]] denounced "any group that would incite violence against another individual", without specifically responding to the QAnon mention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2018/08/01/sanders-denounces-media-hecklers-at-trump-rally-then-slams-the-media/|title=Sanders denounces media hecklers at Trump rally – then slams the media|last=Fredericks|first=Bob|date=July 1, 2018|work=New York Post|access-date=July 1, 2018|language=en|issn=1090-3321}}&lt;/ref&gt; She added that President Trump "certainly doesn't support groups that would support that type of behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/01/politics/qanon-trump/|title=QAnon is the one conspiracy theory to rule them all|last=Cillizza|first=Chris|date=August 1, 2018|access-date=August 1, 2018|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|last=Huckabee Sanders|first=Sarah|authorlink=Sarah Huckabee Sanders|date=August 1, 2018|title=Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sarah Sanders|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-080118/|location=[[James S.

=== Accusations of antisemitism ===
The conspiracy theory's targeting of [[George Soros]] and the [[Rothschild family]] has led [[Jewish American literature|Jewish-American]] [[magazine]] [[The Forward|''The Forward'']] as well as ''[[The Washington Post]]'' to accuse it of containing "striking anti-Semitic elements"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://forward.com/news/national/407121/explained-what-s-anti-semitic-about-qanon-the-trump-base-s-latest-pet-theory/|title=EXPLAINED: What’s Anti-Semitic About QAnon, The Trump Base’s Latest Pet Theory?|last=Pink|first=Aiden|date=August 1, 2018|work=The Forward|access-date=September 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "garden-variety nonsense with racist and anti-Semitic undertones".&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; However, this was contested by the [[Anti-Defamation League]], which reported that "the vast majority of QAnon-inspired conspiracy theories have nothing to do with anti-Semitism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.adl.org/resources/reports/quantifying-hate-a-year-of-anti-semitism-on-twitter|title=Quantifying Hate: A Year of Anti-Semitism on Twitter|last=|first=|date=|publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] article published in ''[[Haaretz]]'' on August 3, 2018 stated that "although not specifically, some of QAnon's archetypical elements—including secret elites and kidnapped children, among others—are reflective of historical and ongoing anti-Semitic conspiracy theories".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/is-qanon-the-latest-pro-trump-conspiracy-theory-anti-semitic-1.6340841|title=Is QAnon, the Latest pro-Trump Conspiracy Theory, anti-Semitic?|last=Dunst|first=Charles|date=August 3, 2018|work=Haaretz|access-date=September 21, 2018|agency=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Reactions===
On November 26, 2017, President Donald Trump [[Reblogging|retweeted]] a tweet from [[Twitter]] account @MAGAPILL, a self-styled "official President Donald Trump accomplishment list" and a major proponent of the conspiracy theory, less than a month after QAnon first started posting.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

On December 28, 2017, the Russian government-funded television network [[RT (TV network)|RT]] aired a segment discussing "QAnon revelations", referring to the anonymous poster as a "secret intelligence operative inside the Trump administration known by QAnon".&lt;ref name="ibt" /&gt;

On January 9, 2018, [[Fox News]] commentator [[Sean Hannity]] shared QAnon-related material on his Twitter account.&lt;ref name="ibt" /&gt;

On March 13, 2018, [[Operation Rescue (Kansas)|Operation Rescue]] vice president and pro-life activist [[Cheryl Sullenger]] referred to QAnon as a "small group of insiders close to President Donald J. Trump" and called his internet postings the "highest level of intelligence to ever be dropped publicly in our known history".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/operation-rescue-hypes-qanon-blockbuster-intel-drop-about-planned-parenthood/|title=Operation Rescue Hypes QAnon 'Blockbuster Intel Drop' About Planned Parenthood|last=Blue|first=Miranda|date=March 15, 2018|work=Right Wing Watch|access-date=April 5, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.operationrescue.org/archives/blockbuster-intel-drop-reveals-trump-is-trying-to-end-planned-parenthood-twitter-attempts-censorship/|title=Blockbuster Intel Drop Reveals Trump is Trying to "End" Planned Parenthood – Twitter Attempts Censorship|date=March 13, 2018|first=Cheryl|last=Sullenger|author-link=Cheryl Sullenger|work=Operation Rescue|access-date=April 5, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 15, 2018, [[Kiev]]-based ''[[:uk:Рабочая газета|Rabochaya Gazeta]]'', the official newspaper of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], published an article calling QAnon a "military intelligence group".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://rg.kiev.ua/page5/article41143 |title= Доживают ли Гавайи свои последние дни? |last=Gamma |first=Viktor |date=May 25, 2018 |work= Rabochaya Gazeta |access-date=July 5, 2018 |trans-title= Are we witnessing the final days of Hawaii? |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 31, 2018, U.S. actress [[Roseanne Barr]] appeared to promote the conspiracy theory, which was subsequently covered by [[CNN]], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', and ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/31/politics/roseanne-barr-conspiracy-tweets/index.html |title=Roseanne tweets support of Trump conspiracy theory, confuses Twitter |last=Cole |first=Devan |work=CNN |access-date= April 1, 2018 |date=December 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/03/31/the-conspiracy-theory-behind-a-curious-roseanne-barr-tweet-explained/ |title=Analysis {{!}} The conspiracy theory behind a curious Roseanne Barr tweet, explained |last=Weigel |first= David |author-link=David Weigel |date= March 31, 2018 |work= Washington Post |access-date=April 1, 2018 |language=en-US |issn= 0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://thehill.com/homenews/media/381123-roseanne-barr-faces-social-media-backlash-over-trump-conspiracy-theory-tweet |title= Roseanne Barr faces backlash over Trump conspiracy theory tweet |last=Bowden |first= Tohn |work=The Hill |access-date= March 31, 2018 |date= March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/06/opinion/qanon-trump-conspiracy-theory.html |title= Opinion {{!}} The Conspiracy Theory That Says Trump Is a Genius |date= April 6, 2018 |work=The New York Times |access-date=April 6, 2018 |issn=0362-4331 |first=Michelle |last=Goldberg |author-link= Michelle Goldberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the conspiracy theory was initially promoted by [[Alex Jones]] and [[Jerome Corsi]],&lt;ref name="newsweek" /&gt; it was reported by [[Right Wing Watch]] that they had both ceased to support QAnon by May 2018, declaring the source to now be "completely compromised".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/stick-a-fork-in-qanon-alex-jones-and-jerome-corsi-claim-that-qanon-has-been-completely-compromised/|title=Stick A Fork In QAnon: Alex Jones And Jerome Corsi Claim That QAnon Has Been 'Completely Compromised'|last=Mantyla|first=Kyle|date=May 11, 2018|work=Right Wing Watch|access-date=July 5, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in August 2018, Corsi reversed course and stated that he "will comment on and follow QAnon when QAnon is bringing forth news", adding that "in the last few days, QAnon has been particularly good".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/jerome-corsi-wants-to-make-amends-with-qanon/|title=Jerome Corsi Wants To Make Amends With QAnon|last=Holt|first=Jared|date=August 17, 2018|work=Right Wing Watch|access-date=August 19, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 2018, [[WikiLeaks]] publicly accused QAnon of "leading anti-establishment Trump voters to embrace regime change and neo-conservatism".&lt;ref group="tweet"&gt;{{cite tweet|number=1011441579565953025|user=wikileaks|title=Why is "Qanon" leading anti-establishment Trump voters to embrace regime change and neo-conservatism?|author=WikiLeaks|author-link=WikiLeaks|date=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; QAnon had previously pushed for regime change in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mintpressnews.com/pro-trump-conspiracy-monger-qanon-calls-for-regime-change-in-iran/244686/|title=Pro-Trump Conspiracy-Monger "QAnon" Calls for Regime Change in Iran|last=Webb|first=Whitney|date=June 25, 2018|work=MintPress News|access-date=July 5, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, the whistleblower organization shared an analysis by [[Internet Party (New Zealand)|Internet Party]] president Suzie Dawson, claiming that QAnon's posting campaign is an "intelligence agency-backed [[Psychological warfare|psyop]]" aiming to "round up people that are otherwise dangerous to the Deep State (because they are genuinely opposed to it) usurp time &amp; attention, &amp; trick them into serving its aims".&lt;ref group="tweet"&gt;{{cite tweet|number=1000795757983780865|user=wikileaks|title=

On June 28, 2018, a [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] article listed the anonymous "Q" among the 25 Most Influential People on the Internet in 2018. Counting more than 130,000 related discussion videos on YouTube, ''Time'' cited the wide range of this conspiracy theory and its more prominent followers and spreading news coverage.&lt;ref name="timemag"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://time.com/5324130/most-influential-internet/ |title=25 Most Influential People on the Internet|issn=0040-781X |last=Chan |first=Melissa |date=June 28, 2018 |work=Time |access-date=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 4, 2018, the [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] shared on its official Facebook and Twitter accounts a YouTube video on QAnon, calling QAnon a "mysterious anonymous inside leaker of deep state activities and counter activities by President Trump". The posts were then deleted.&lt;ref name="tampabay"&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2018/07/16/conspiracy-theorist-qanon-promoted-then-deleted-by-hillsborough-county-gop/|title=Conspiracy theorist QAnon promoted, then deleted, by Hillsborough County GOP|last=March|first=William|date=July 16, 2018|work=Tampa Bay Times|access-date=July 16, 2018|issn=2327-9052}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Thomsen |first=Jacqueline |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/397615-florida-county-gop-promoted-conspiracy-theory-on-twitter |title=Florida county GOP promoted, then deleted, conspiracy theory on Twitter |date=July 18, 2018 |work=The Hill |accessdate=July 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1, 2018, following the ''en masse'' presence of QAnon supporters at the July 31 [[List of post-election Donald Trump rallies|Trump rally]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]],&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.com/what-qanon-conspiracy-theorists-showed-support-trump-tampa-rally-1051708|title=QAnon: Conspiracy theorists determined to expose a "deep state" child abuse ring show up to support Trump in Tampa|last=Porter|first=Tom|date=August 1, 2018|work=Newsweek|access-date=August 1, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MSNBC]] news anchors [[Hallie Jackson]], [[Brian Williams]], and [[Chris Hayes]] dedicated a portion of their respective television programs to the conspiracy theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|url=https://www.msnbc.com/hallie-jackson/watch/-we-are-q-conspiracy-cult-leaps-from-the-internet-to-trump-rally-1289927747781|title=Who is 'QAnon'?

On August 2, 2018, [[Washington Post]] editorial writer Molly Roberts stated, "The storm QAnon truthers predict will never strike because the conspiracy that obsesses them doesn’t exist. But while they wait for it, they’ll try to whip up the winds, and the rest of us will struggle to find shelter."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2018/08/02/what-makes-qanon-so-scary/|title=Opinion {{!}} QAnon is terrifying.

On August 4, 2018, former [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Sean Spicer]] was asked to comment on the conspiracy theory in his "[[/r/IAmA|ask me anything]]" session on the [[/r/The_Donald]] [[subreddit]]. In response to the question "is Q legit?", Spicer answered "no".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inquisitr.com/5014935/sean-spicer-just-sparked-a-civil-war-among-reddits-trump-loving-corners-by-saying-that-qanon-is-fake/|title=Sean Spicer Just Sparked A Civil War Among Reddit's Trump-Loving Corners By Saying That QAnon Is Fake|last=Francis|first=Nathan|date=August 4, 2018|work=The Inquisitr|access-date=August 4, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 24, 2018, President Donald Trump hosted [[Lionel (radio personality)|William "Lionel" Lebron]], a leading promoter of the QAnon conspiracy, in the [[Oval Office]] for a [[photo op]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/403549-trump-meets-with-promoter-of-qanon-conspiracy-theory-in-oval|title=Trump meets with promoter of 'QAnon' conspiracy theory in Oval Office|first=Justin|last=Wise|date=August 24, 2018|publisher=|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spread and popularity===
According to an August 2018 [[Qualtrics]] poll for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 58% of Floridians are familiar enough with QAnon to have an opinion about it, among whom only 24% hold a favorable view of the conspiracy theory.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/08/30/the-qanon-conspiracy-movement-is-very-unpopular-our-new-poll-finds/|title=New poll: the QAnon conspiracy movement is very unpopular|last=Uscinski|first=Joseph|last2=Klofstad|first2=Casey|date=August 30, 2018|website=Washington Post|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive feelings toward QAnon were found to be strongly correlated with one's proneness to conspiracy thinking.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

===Disillusionment===
Q had predicted Republican success in the US midterm elections in November 2018, and claimed that Sessions was involved in secret work for Trump, with apparent tensions between them a cover. When Democrats made significant gains and Trump fired Sessions, there was disillusionment among many in the Q community.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.salon.com/2018/11/15/qanons-true-believers-are-devastated-as-the-conspiracy-theory-goes-down-in-flames/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/qanon-jeff-sessions-2018-midterms/ | title=Jeff Sessions, the 2018 midterms, and the continued grift of QAnon| date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samson L. Bodnărescu''' ({{IPA-ro|samˈson bodnəˈresku}}; June 27, 1840 – 1902) was a [[Romania]]n [[poet]].

He was a member of the cultural society ''[[Junimea]]'' and his poetry often reflected his idealistic philosophical views. This was demonstrated in the tragedy ''Rienzi'', (1868) which was inspired by [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], and later ''Lăpușneanu-vodă'' (1878–1879),

The son of a [[Buddhist]] priest, he studied philosophy at [[Kyoto University]] where his mentor [[Keiji Nishitani]] oriented his studies toward medieval mystics. He then went to Germany where he received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree from the [[University of Marburg]] with a thesis on the [[Western Christian]] mystic, [[Meister Eckhart]]. He returned to Kyoto University to teach philosophy of religion. Later he specialized in the thought of [[Kitaro Nishida]]. Being a Zen practitioner, Ueda -like Nishida- studied [[Zen Buddhism]] under the philosophical categories of Western philosophy. He is considered a third generation member of [[Kyoto School]].&lt;ref name=Buri1997/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23422">'''Technological utopianism''' (often called '''techno-utopianism''' or '''technoutopianism''') is any [[ideology]] based on the premise that advances in science and technology could and should bring about a [[utopia]], or at least help to fulfill one or another utopian ideal.

A '''techno-utopia''' is therefore an ideal [[society]], in which laws, government, and social conditions are solely operating for the benefit and well-being of all its citizens, set in the near- or far-[[future]], as advanced science and technology will allow these ideal living standards to exist; for example, [[post-scarcity]], [[Trans-human|transformations in human nature]], the avoidance or prevention of suffering and even the [[immortality|end of death]].

Technological utopianism is often connected with other discourses presenting technologies as agents of social and cultural change, such as [[technological determinism]] or [[Media imaginary|media imaginaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Natale|first=Simone|last2=Balbi|first2=Gabriele|date=2014-04-03|title=Media and the Imaginary in History|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13688804.2014.898904|journal=Media History|volume=20|issue=2|pages=203–218|doi=10.1080/13688804.2014.898904|issn=1368-8804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Douglas Rushkoff]], a leading theorist on [[technology]] and [[cyberculture]] claims that technology gives everyone a chance to voice their own opinions, fosters individualistic thinking, and dilutes hierarchy and power structures by giving the power to the people.&lt;ref&gt;Rushkoff, Douglas. EME: Explorations in Media Ecology, “Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative”. Hampton Press, 2002, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; He says that the whole world is in the middle of a new Renaissance, one that is centered on technology and self-expression. However, Rushkoff makes it clear that “people don’t live their lives behind a desk with their hands on a keyboard” &lt;ref&gt;Rushkoff, Douglas. “Douglas Rushkoff - Articles - 21st Century Renaissance.” Douglas Rushkoff - Articles - 21st Century Renaissance. Web. 02 March 2015. http://www.rushkoff.com/articles-individual/2008/3/31/21st-century-renaissance.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A tech-utopia does not disregard any problems that technology may cause,&lt;ref&gt;Segal, Howard P. Imagining Tomorrow: History, Technology and The American Future, "The Technological Utopians", Cambridge: MIT Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; but strongly believes that technology allows mankind to make social, economic, political, and cultural advancements.&lt;ref&gt;Rushkoff, Douglas. EME: Explorations in Media Ecology, “Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative”. Hampton Press, 2002, p. 41-57.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Technological Utopianism views technology’s impacts as extremely positive.

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, several ideologies and movements, such as the [[cyberdelic]] counterculture, the [[Californian Ideology]], [[transhumanism]],&lt;ref name="Hughes 2003"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Hughes, James | title = Rediscovering Utopia | year=  2003 | url = http://archives.betterhumans.com/Columns/Column/tabid/79/Column/232/Default.aspx  | accessdate=2007-02-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927204653/http://archives.betterhumans.com/Columns/Column/tabid/79/Column/232/Default.aspx |archivedate = 2007-09-27 | authorlink = James Hughes (sociologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[singularitarianism]], have emerged promoting a form of techno-utopia as a reachable goal. Cultural critic [[Imre Szeman]] argues technological utopianism is an irrational [[metanarrative|social narrative]] because there is no evidence to support it. He concludes that it shows the extent to which [[Modernity|modern]] societies place faith in [[Idea of Progress|narratives of progress and technology]] overcoming things, despite all evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref name="sciencedaily.com"&gt;{{Cite news |title=People Generally Do Not Act on Information on the Effects of Oil on the Environment |date=May 28, 2010 |accessdate=17 Nov 2010 |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100528150833.htm |work=ScienceDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===From the 19th to mid-20th centuries===

[[Karl Marx]] believed that [[science]] and [[democracy]] were the right and left hands of what he called the move from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom. He argued that advances in science helped delegitimize the rule of kings and the power of the [[Christian Church]].&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"&gt;{{cite book| author = Hughes, James | title = Citizen Cyborg: Why Democratic Societies Must Respond to the Redesigned Human of the Future | publisher = Westview Press | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8133-4198-1 | authorlink = James Hughes (sociologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

19th-century [[Classical liberalism|liberals]], [[Socialism|socialists]], and [[Republicanism|republicans]] often embraced techno-utopianism. [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicals]] like [[Joseph Priestley]] pursued scientific investigation while advocating democracy. [[Robert Owen]], [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, Comte de Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]] in the early 19th century inspired [[Communalism|communalists]] with their visions of a future scientific and [[technological evolution]] of humanity using reason. Radicals seized on [[Darwinism|Darwinian evolution]] to validate the idea of [[social progress]]. [[Edward Bellamy]]’s [[Utopian socialism|socialist utopia]] in ''[[Looking Backward]]'', which inspired hundreds of socialist clubs in the late 19th century [[United States]] and a national political party, was as highly technological as Bellamy’s imagination. For Bellamy and the [[Fabian Society|Fabian Socialist]]s, socialism was to be brought about as a painless corollary of industrial development.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;

Marx and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] saw more pain and conflict involved, but agreed about the inevitable end. [[Marxism|Marxists]] argued that the advance of technology laid the groundwork not only for the creation of a new society, with [[Mutualism (economic theory)|different property relations]], but also for the emergence of new human beings reconnected to nature and themselves. At the top of the agenda for [[Empowerment|empowered]] [[proletarian]]s was "to increase the total [[productive forces]] as rapidly as possible". The 19th and early 20th century Left, from [[Social democracy|social democrats]] to [[Communism|communists]], were focused on [[industrialization]], [[economic development]] and the promotion of reason, science, and the idea of [[Progress (history)|progress]].&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;

Some technological utopians promoted [[eugenics]]. Holding that in studies of families, such as the [[The Jukes family|Jukes]] and [[Kallikaks]], science had proven that many traits such as criminality and alcoholism were hereditary, many advocated the sterilization of those displaying negative traits. Forcible sterilization programs were implemented in several states in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Haller, Mark ''Eugenics: Hereditarian attitudes in American thought'' (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1963)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[H.G. Wells]] in works such as ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'' promoted technological utopianism.

The horrors of the 20th century – namely fascist dictatorships and the world wars – caused many to abandon optimism. The [[Holocaust]], as [[Theodor Adorno]] underlined, seemed to shatter the ideal of [[Condorcet]] and other thinkers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], which commonly equated [[scientific progress]] with social progress.&lt;ref name="Adorno1983"&gt;{{cite book|last=Adorno|first=Theodor W.|title=Prisms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f1y_dX04yBgC|accessdate=31 March 2011|date=29 March 1983|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-51025-7|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===From late 20th and early 21st centuries===

{{quotation|The Goliath of totalitarianism will be brought down by the David of the microchip.|[[Ronald Reagan]]|[[The Guardian]], 14 June 1989}}

A movement of techno-utopianism began to flourish again in the [[dot-com company|dot-com]] culture of the 1990s, particularly in the West Coast of the United States, especially based around [[Silicon Valley]]. The [[Californian Ideology]] was a set of beliefs combining [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] and [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] attitudes from the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] with techno-utopianism and support for [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] economic policies. It was reflected in, reported on, and even actively promoted in the pages of ''[[Wired Magazine|Wired]]'' magazine, which was founded in San Francisco in 1993 and served for a number years as the "bible" of its adherents.&lt;ref name="Borsook 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Borsook, Paulina|authorlink = Paulina Borsook|title = Cyberselfishness|year = 1996|url = https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/1996/07/borsook.html?welcome=true|accessdate = 2007-02-06|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929125249/https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/1996/07/borsook.html?welcome=true|archivedate = 2007-09-29|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Borsook 2000"&gt;{{cite book|author = Borsook, Paulina|title = Cyberselfish: A Critical Romp Through the Terribly Libertarian Culture of High-Tech| publisher = PublicAffairs|year = 2000|isbn = 1-891620-78-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook and Cameron 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Barbrook, Richard |author2=Cameron, Andy |title = The California Ideology|year = 2000 |url = http://www.hrc.wmin.ac.uk/theory-californianideology.html| accessdate=2007-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of techno-utopianism reflected a belief that technological change revolutionizes human affairs, and that digital technology in particular – of which the [[Internet]] was but a modest harbinger – would increase personal freedom by freeing the individual from the rigid embrace of bureaucratic big government. "Self-empowered knowledge workers" would render traditional hierarchies redundant; digital communications would allow them to escape the modern city, an "obsolete remnant of the [[industrial age]]".&lt;ref name="Borsook 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Borsook 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook and Cameron 2000"/&gt;

Similar forms of "digital utopianism" has often entered in the political messages of party and social movements that point to the [[World Wide Web|Web]] or more broadly to [[new media]] as harbingers of political and social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Natale|first=Simone|last2=Ballatore|first2=Andrea|date=2014-01-01|title=The web will kill them all: new media, digital utopia, and political struggle in the Italian 5-Star Movement|url=http://mcs.sagepub.com/content/36/1/105|journal=Media, Culture &amp; Society|language=en|volume=36|issue=1|pages=105–121|doi=10.1177/0163443713511902|issn=0163-4437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its adherents claim it transcended conventional "[[Left–right politics|right/left]]" distinctions in [[politics]] by rendering politics obsolete. However, techno-utopianism disproportionately attracted adherents from the [[Right-libertarianism|libertarian right]] end of the political spectrum. Therefore, techno-utopians often have a [[Economic liberalism|hostility toward government regulation]] and a belief in the superiority of the [[free market]] system. Prominent "[[oracles]]" of techno-utopianism included [[George Gilder]] and [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]], an editor of ''Wired'' who also published several books.&lt;ref name="Borsook 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Borsook 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook and Cameron 2000"/&gt;

During the late 1990s dot-com boom, when the [[Dot-com bubble|speculative bubble]] gave rise to claims that an era of "permanent prosperity" had arrived, techno-utopianism flourished, typically among the small percentage of the population who were employees of Internet [[Startup company|startups]] and/or owned large quantities of high-tech stocks. With the subsequent [[Stock market crash|crash]], many of these dot-com techno-utopians had to rein in some of their beliefs in the face of the clear return of traditional economic reality.&lt;ref name="Borsook 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook and Cameron 2000"/&gt;

In the late 1990s and especially during the first decade of the 21st century, [[technorealism]] and [[techno-progressivism]] are stances that have risen among advocates of [[technological change]] as critical alternatives to techno-utopianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technorealism|url=http://technorealism.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carrico 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = Carrico, Dale|    title =  Technoprogressivism Beyond Technophilia and Technophobia|    year = 2005 |   url = http://amormundi.blogspot.com/2005/06/technoprogressivism-beyond.html| accessdate=2007-01-28|    authorlink = Dale Carrico}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, technological utopianism persists in the 21st century as a result of new technological developments and their impact on society. For example, several [[Technical journalism|technical journalists]] and social commentators, such as [[Mark Pesce]], have interpreted the [[WikiLeaks]] phenomenon and the [[United States diplomatic cables leak]] in early December 2010 as a precursor to, or an incentive for, the creation of a techno-utopian [[Freedom of information laws by country|transparent society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/42148.html |title=The state, the press and a hyperdemocracy |work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |author=Mark Pesce |date=December 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyber-utopianism]], first coined by [[Evgeny Morozov]], is another manifestation of this, in particular in relation to the [[Internet]] and [[social networking]].

==Principles==
Bernard Gendron, a professor of philosophy at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, defines the four principles of modern technological utopians in the late 20th and early 21st centuries as follows:&lt;ref name="Gendron 1977"&gt;{{cite book|    author = Gendron, Bernard|     title = Technology and the Human Condition| publisher = St.Martin's Press|      year = 1977|        isbn = 0-312-78890-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#We are presently undergoing a ([[post-industrial]]) revolution in technology;
#In the post-industrial age, [[technological change|technological growth]] will be sustained (at least);
#In the post-industrial age, technological growth will lead to the [[post scarcity|end of economic scarcity]];
#The elimination of economic scarcity will lead to the elimination of every major [[social issues|social evil]].

Rushkoff presents us with multiple claims that surround the basic principles of Technological Utopianism:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rushkoff|first1=Douglas|title=Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|date=2002|volume=1|issue=1|pages=21–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''Technology reflects and encourages the best aspects of human nature''', fostering “communication, collaboration, sharing, helpfulness, and community.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rushkoff|first1=Douglas|title=Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|date=2002|volume=1|issue=1|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Technology improves our interpersonal communication, relationships, and communities.''' Early Internet users shared their knowledge of the Internet with others around them.
#'''Technology democratizes society.''' The expansion of access to knowledge and skills led to the connection of people and information. The broadening of freedom of expression created “the online world...in which we are allowed to voice our own opinions.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rushkoff|first1=Douglas|title=Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|date=2002|volume=1|issue=1|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction of the inequalities of power and wealth meant that everyone has an equal status on the internet and is allowed to do as much as the next person.
#'''Technology inevitably progresses.''' The interactivity that came from the inventions of the TV [[remote control]], video game [[joystick]], [[computer mouse]] and [[computer keyboard]] allowed for much more progress.
#'''Unforeseen impacts of technology are positive.''' As more people discovered the Internet, they took advantage of being linked to millions of people, and turned the Internet into a social revolution. The government released it to the public, and its “social side effect… [became] its main feature.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
#'''Technology increases efficiency and consumer choice.''' The creation of the TV remote, video game joystick, and computer mouse liberated these technologies and allowed users to manipulate and control them, giving them many more choices.
#'''New technology can solve the problems created by old technology.''' Social networks and blogs were created out of the collapse of [[dot.com bubble]] businesses’ attempts to run pyramid schemes on users.

==Criticisms==

Critics claim that techno-utopianism's identification of [[social progress]] with [[scientific progress]] is a form of [[positivism]] and [[scientism]]. Critics of modern libertarian techno-utopianism point out that it tends to focus on "government interference" while dismissing the positive effects of the [[regulation]] of [[business]]. They also point out that it has little to say about the [[Technology#Environmental|environmental impact of technology]]&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}, 464 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; and that its ideas have little relevance for much of the rest of the world that are still relatively quite poor (see [[global digital divide]]).&lt;ref name="Borsook 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Borsook 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbrook and Cameron 2000"/&gt;

In his 2010 study ''System Failure: Oil, Futurity, and the Anticipation of Disaster'', [[Canada Research Chair]]holder in cultural studies Imre Szeman argues that technological utopianism is one of the social narratives that prevent people from acting on the knowledge they have concerning the [[environmental issues with petroleum|effects of oil on the environment]].&lt;ref name="sciencedaily.com"/&gt;

In a controversial article "Techno-Utopians are Mugged by Reality", [[Wall Street Journal]] explores the concept of the violation of free speech by shutting down social media to stop violence. As a result of British cities being looted consecutively, Prime British Minister David Cameron argued that the government should have the ability to shut down social media during crime sprees so that the situation could be contained. A poll was conducted to see if Twitter users would prefer to let the service be closed temporarily or keep it open so they can chat about the famous television show X-Factor. The end report showed that every Tweet opted for X-Factor. The negative social effects of technological utopia is that society is so addicted to technology that we simply can't be parted even for the greater good. While many Techno-Utopians would like to believe that digital technology is for the greater good, it can also be used negatively to bring harm to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903918104576506393735675856.html#articleTabs%3Darticle|title= Techno-Utopians Are Mugged by Reality}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics of a techno-utopia include the worry of the human element. Critics suggest that a techno-utopia may lessen human contact, leading to a distant society. Another concern is the amount of reliance society may place on their technologies in these techno-utopia settings.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], ”Technological Dependency and Loss of Freedom”, pp. 245, New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These criticisms are sometimes referred to as a technological anti-utopian view or a techno-dystopia.

Even today, the negative social effects of a technological utopia can be seen. Mediated communication such as phone calls, instant messaging and text messaging are steps towards a utopian world in which one can easily contact another regardless of time or location. However, mediated communication removes many aspects that are helpful in transferring messages. As it stands today, most text, email, and instant messages offer fewer nonverbal cues about the speaker’s feelings than do face-to-face encounters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adler &amp; Proctor II|first=Ronald B. &amp; Russell F.|title=Looking Out Looking In|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth Cenage Learning|location=Boston, MA|isbn=978-0-495-79621-3|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it so that mediated communication can easily be misconstrued and the intended message is not properly conveyed. With the absence of tone, body language, and environmental context, the chance of a misunderstanding is much higher, rendering the communication ineffective. In fact, mediated technology can be seen from a dystopian view because it can be detrimental to effective interpersonal communication.  These criticisms would only apply to messages that are prone to misinterpretation as not every text based communication requires contextual cues.  The limitations of lacking tone and body language in text based communication are likely to be mitigated by [[videotelephony|video]] and [[augmented reality]] versions of digital communication technologies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tcworld.info/e-magazine/technical-communication/article/augmented-reality-in-technical-communication/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The KGB and Soviet Disinformation: An Insider's View''''' is a non-fiction book about the [[KGB]]'s use of [[disinformation]] and [[information warfare]] during the [[Soviet Union]] period. It was written by former intelligence officer specializing in disinformation for the [[Security Information Service|Czech Intelligence Service]] and retired professor of disinformation at [[Boston University]], Ladislav Bittman (now known as [[Lawrence Martin-Bittman]]).&lt;ref name=richman /&gt;&lt;ref name=butterfield /&gt;&lt;ref name=bittman1985 /&gt;

Under the direction of the [[Soviet secret police]], Bittman was deputy chief of the disinformation division for Czech intelligence called the Department for Active Measures and Disinformation.&lt;ref name=butterfield /&gt; In the book, he warns how disinformation can lead to [[Blowback (intelligence)|blowback]], causing [[unintended consequences]] from [[intelligence agency]] actions, which were harmful to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=bittman1985 /&gt;&lt;ref name=boghardt /&gt;&lt;ref name=arenstein /&gt; The book includes case studies of joint disinformation campaigns by the Soviet Union and Czech intelligence and their repercussions, including a successful operation to stop the building of an aerospace center in [[West Germany]] and a failed plot to accuse [[CBS News]] anchor [[Dan Rather]] of murder in [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=bittman1985 /&gt;&lt;ref name=arenstein /&gt;

The book received a positive reception from ''[[SAIS Review]]'', where it was called "fascinating reading".&lt;ref name=arenstein /&gt; ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' gave a mixed review saying the author exaggerated the role of the KGB.&lt;ref name=campbell /&gt; One review in the ''[[International Journal of Intelligence and CounterIntelligence]]'' called the book "an excellent study" and its author "the top authority on disinformation in the U.S.", while another in the same journal said it lacked depth.&lt;ref name=phillips/&gt;&lt;ref name=unsinger /&gt; It was also reviewed in the Italian language ''Rivista di Studi Politici Internazionali''.&lt;ref name=rivista/&gt;

==Background==

Ladislav Bittman graduated from [[Charles University in Prague]] in 1954 and was recruited by Czech intelligence.&lt;ref name=butterfield /&gt; He served within the Czechoslovak intelligence agency as its deputy chief of the disinformation division, the Department for Active Measures and Disinformation, from 1964–1966.&lt;ref name=butterfield /&gt;&lt;ref name=boghardt&gt;{{citation|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Operation_INFEKTION_-_Soviet_Bloc_Intelligence_and_Its_AIDS_Disinformation_Campaign.pdf|accessdate=9 December 2016|title=Operation INFEKTION - Soviet Bloc Intelligence and Its AIDS Disinformation Campaign|first=Thomas|last=Boghardt|date=26 January 2010|journal=[[Studies in Intelligence]]|volume=53|issue=4|publisher=Center for the Study of Intelligence, [[Central Intelligence Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=arenstein /&gt; This division was under the control of the Soviet secret police.&lt;ref name=butterfield /&gt; One of his significant achievements in disinformation was [[Operation Neptune (espionage)|Operation Neptune]], where a falsified list of Nazi spies was obtained by the media and believed as accurate.&lt;ref name=richman /&gt;&lt;ref name=butterfield /&gt; In 1967, he was assigned to [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] in an [[undercover operation]] as a press attaché, to recruit European reporters as [[secret agent]]s that Soviet intelligence could use to spread disinformation.&lt;ref name=butterfield /&gt; He chose to defect to the United States in 1968 at the conclusion of the period known as the [[Prague Spring]], after the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref name=richman /&gt; The Czechoslovak government sentenced Bittman to death for treason; his sentence was removed 20 years later.&lt;ref name=richman /&gt;

Bittman became a professor in the department of communication at Boston University (BU) and began to use the name Lawrence Martin.&lt;ref name=richman /&gt;&lt;ref name=butterfield /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Ladislav|last=Bittman|title=The use of disinformation by democracies|pages=243–261 |year=1990|doi=10.1080/08850609008435142|journal=[[International Journal of Intelligence and CounterIntelligence]] |volume=4|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, Bittman taught journalism with a focus on disinformation at BU and founded the Program for the Study of Disinformation, the first academic center in the U.S. to focus on the study of disinformation.&lt;ref name=richman&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/27/us/the-spy-who-came-into-the-classroom-teaches-at-boston-u.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 27, 1994|first=Evan|last=Richman|title=The Spy Who Came Into the Classroom Teaches at Boston U.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=richman /&gt;&lt;ref name=butterfield&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/18/us/boston-u-focuses-on-disinformation.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Fox|last=Butterfield|date=November 18, 1986|title= Boston U. focuses on disinformation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the publication of ''The KGB and Soviet Disinformation'', Bittman had written a book on the history of disinformation in Soviet covert operations, ''The Deception Game: Czechoslovak Intelligence in Soviet Political Warfare'' (1972).&lt;ref name=bittman1972&gt;{{citation|first=Ladislav|last= Bittman|authorlink=Lawrence Martin-Bittman|title=The Deception Game: Czechoslovak Intelligence in Soviet Political Warfare|publisher=[[SRC Inc.|Syracuse University Research Corporation]]|year=1972|isbn=0-8156-8078-3|pages=39–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents summary==
[[File:Disinformation vs Misinformation.jpg|thumb|300px|Graphic showing differences between disinformation, [[misinformation]] and [[hoax]]]]
Bittman recounts his time as a [[StB|Czech State Security]] (StB) expert at misleading individuals. He describes information warfare tactics used by the Soviet Union, which they internally referred to as disinformation, intended to fool and defraud others. The author defines disinformation as "a carefully constructed false message leaked to an opponent's communication system in order to deceive the decision-making elite or the public".&lt;ref name=arenstein /&gt; Ideally, such methods would confuse foreign beliefs about key issues affecting the Soviet Union. The author recounts covert operations that significantly affected international relations. Bittman writes that for disinformation covert operation campaigns to succeed, "every disinformation message must at least partially correspond to reality or generally accepted views".&lt;ref name=boghardt /&gt; In some instances such covert operations led to blowback and unintended consequences from intelligence agency actions, which were harmful to the Soviet Union. Bittman argues such disinformation tactics had the cumulative effect of negative political consequences to the Soviet Union, because its subterfuge campaigns injected false information into society.&lt;ref name=bittman1985&gt;{{citation|first=Ladislav|last=Bittman|title=The KGB and Soviet Disinformation: An Insider's View|year=1985|isbn=0-08-031572-0|publisher=Pergamon-Brassey's|pages=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=boghardt /&gt;&lt;ref name=arenstein /&gt;

The author recalls a StB operation which began in 1964 with the assistance of the KGB, whose goal was to inflame public opinion within [[Indonesia]] and increase negative perceptions towards the U.S. The operation targeted an Ambassador from Indonesia through a [[honeypot (espionage)|honeypot espionage]] ploy, tempting him with attractive women. The KGB and StB agents were able to turn the Indonesian Ambassador to their interests and through him they passed along to [[President of Indonesia]] [[Sukarno]] fabricated analyses and [[false document]]s, alleging the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] was planning to harm him. In particular, a specific false report stated a fictitious strategy supposedly planned by the United Kingdom jointly with the U.S., to invade Indonesia through [[Malaysia]]. Another such forgery claimed that the CIA plotted a covert assassination attempt on the Indonesian president.&lt;ref name=bittman1985 /&gt;

The KGB and StB ruse succeeded in causing paranoia and the Indonesia president began to make public statements highly critical of the U.S. Reporters within the employ of the two Soviet intelligence agencies promptly capitalized on Sukarno's remarks and incensed the [[Indonesians]] with broadcasts of the false reporting on [[Radio Moscow]] and groups of angry citizens attacked U.S. buildings in the city of [[Jakarta]]. Negative commentary about the U.S. grew markedly within the country at a rapid pace. Perceptions of American interests within the country were decreased to a negligible level, directly due to the Soviet intelligence disinformation campaign.&lt;ref name=bittman1985 /&gt;

Bittman recounts other case studies, including efforts by the Soviet intelligence services to influence the views of the [[Third World]] against Americans so that such countries would support Russian interests in the [[United Nations]].&lt;!--The dirty war against Vietnam might have had something to do with it too--&gt; The author details fruitful efforts of the KGB to stop the building of an aerospace facility in West Germany, after Soviet intelligence fomented false notions that the building was part of a Central Intelligence Agency plot to turn Germany into a nuclear-capable country. He describes a failed attempt by the Soviet intelligence services to make Dan Rather, then a newsman with [[CBS News]], appear guilty with killing citizens in [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=bittman1985 /&gt;&lt;ref name=arenstein /&gt;

==Release and reception==

The book was first published in 1983 by Pergamon-Brassey's and another edition was released in 1985 by the same publisher, with a foreword by [[Roy Godson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{oclc|59067176}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{oclc|443300735}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Spanish language edition was released in 1987 by Editorial Juventud.&lt;ref&gt;{{oclc|16103979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seth Arenstein analyzed the book for ''[[SAIS Review]]'' and wrote that "Bittman's treatment of disinformation, particularly his meticulous research, makes ''The KGB and Soviet Disinformation'' fascinating reading".&lt;ref name=arenstein&gt;{{citation|first=Seth|last=Arenstein|journal=[[SAIS Review]]|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/434995/summary|volume=6|issue=2|year=1986|pages=224–226|doi=10.1353/sais.1986.0061|oclc=4894382744|title=The KGB and Soviet Disinformation, and: Sovieticus: American Perceptions and Soviet Realities (review)}}&lt;/ref&gt; John C. Campbell reviewed the book for the journal ''Foreign Affairs'' and gave a mixed review, "Going well beyond the author's personal experience–he left Czechoslovakia in 1968–the book ranges over the entire field ... with many illustrative cases and items of interest, but also with a tendency to write the KGB's role as larger than life".&lt;ref name=campbell&gt;{{citation|journal=[[Foreign Affairs]]|first=John C.|last=Campbell|issn=0015-7120|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/1986-03-01/kgb-and-soviet-disinformation-insiders-view|date=March 1, 1986|oclc=5547492362|title=Book Review: The KGB and Soviet Disinformation: An Insider's View|volume=64|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The KGB and Soviet Disinformation'' received both a negative and a positive review in the ''International Journal of Intelligence and CounterIntelligence'', with Phillips writing "Chez Espionage regulars consider" the book "an excellent study", referring to its author as "the top authority on disinformation in the U.S.".&lt;ref name=phillips&gt;{{citation|journal=[[International Journal of Intelligence and CounterIntelligence]]|oclc=12566055|issn=0885-0607|publisher=[[Routledge]]|author=Phillips|volume=1|issue=3|title=The KGB and Soviet Disinformation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other reviewer, Peter C. Unsinger, wrote "At times his examination is superficial, and for depth into some specific events, the reader will have to look at Bittman's earlier work".&lt;ref name=unsinger&gt;{{citation|journal=[[International Journal of Intelligence and CounterIntelligence]]|oclc=12566055|issn=0885-0607|publisher=[[Routledge]]|volume=1|issue=2|title=The KGB and Soviet Disinformation|last=Unsinger|first=Peter C.|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08850608608435017|year=1986|pages=137–179|doi=10.1080/08850608608435017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was reviewed by Cesare Marongiu Buonaiuti in the Italian language journal ''Rivista di Studi Politici Internazionali''.&lt;ref name=rivista&gt;{{citation|title=Book Review: The KGB and Soviet Disinformation, An Insider's View|first=Cesare Marongiu|last= Buonaiuti|language=Italian|journal=Rivista di Studi Politici Internazionali|volume=56|issue=3|pages=493–494|oclc=5792426414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2609">'''Transcendental theology''' is a term invented by [[Immanuel Kant]] to describe a method of discerning theological concepts.&lt;ref name=KantCritique&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', [https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;q=%22Transcendental+theology+aims+either+at+inferring+the+existence+of+a+Supreme+Being+from+a+general+experience,+without+any+closer+reference+to+the+world+to+which+this+experience+belongs,+and+in+this+case%22%22it+is+called+cosmotheology;+or+it+endeavours+to+cognize+the+existence+of+such+a+being,+through+mere+conceptions,+without+the+aid+of+experience,+and+is+then+termed+Ontotheology%22 Section VII: Critique of all Theology based upon Speculative Principles of Reason].&lt;/ref&gt; Kant divided transcendental theology into "[[ontotheology]]" and "[[cosmotheology]]", both of which he also invented, "in order to distinguish between two competing types of 'transcendental theology'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomson |first=Iain Donald |authorlink=Iain Thomson |title=Heidegger on Ontotheology. Technology and the Politics of Education |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Bqdx-DjouyoC&amp;printsec=frontcover |date=2005 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0521851157 |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=Bqdx-DjouyoC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=%22Kant+coined+“ontotheology”+and+“cosmotheology”+in+order+to+distinguish+between+two+opposing+kinds+of+“transcendental+theology”%22 7]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant defined the relationship between ontotheology and cosmostheology as follows: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Transcendental theology aims either at inferring the existence of a Supreme Being from a general experience, without any closer reference to the world to which this experience belongs, and in this case it is called cosmotheology; or it endeavours to cognize the existence of such a being, through mere conceptions, without the aid of experience, and is then termed ontotheology."&lt;ref name=KantCritique/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The problem of transcendental theology as developed by Kant is that human reason is not capable of proving [[God's existence]]. Kant solves this problem by appealing to moral symbolism. Thus, Kant describes God as a moral trinity: holy lawgiver, good governor, and just judge.&lt;ref&gt;For details, see Stephen Palmquist, "Kant's Perspectival Foundation for Critical Theology", Part Two of [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/ksp2 ''Kant's Critical Religion''] (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vladimir J. Konečni''' (born October 27, 1944&lt;ref name="VJKbio" /&gt;) is an [[United States|American]] and [[Serbia]]n psychologist, aesthetician, poet, dramatist, fiction writer, and art photographer, currently an Emeritus Professor of Psychology at the [[University of California, San Diego]].&lt;ref name="SPN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UCSD" /&gt; 

In psychology, he has carried out influential work in several distinct areas, related to each other by strong methodological concerns.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Anderson, N. H. (2013). Unified psychology based on three laws of information integration. ''Review of General Psychology, 17'', 125-132. doi: 10.1073/a0032921&lt;/ref&gt; Konečni has conducted laboratory and field studies of human [[emotion]] and (physical and verbal) [[aggression]], as well as of [[Altruism|altruistic]] behavior, which have been cited in numerous social psychology textbooks.

[[Decision-making]] has been another major research area in which Konečni has been heavily involved (in close collaboration with Dr. Ebbe B. Ebbesen, a long-time colleague at the University of California, San Diego). Most of their work has been devoted to [[Legal psychology|judicial decisions]] in the criminal justice system, but they have also conducted a number of frequently cited studies of drivers’ decisions in real-world settings.&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J., Ebbesen, E. B., &amp; Konečni, D. K. (1976). Decision processes and risk taking in traffic: Driver response to the onset of yellow light. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 61'', 359-367.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ebbesen, E. B., Parker, S., &amp; Konečni, V. J. (1977). Laboratory and field analyses of decisions involving risk. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 3'', 576-589.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Finally, Konečni has for some forty years worked in the multi-faceted interdisciplinary domains of [[International Association of Empirical Aesthetics|empirical aesthetics]], [[psychology of art]], and [[music psychology]]. Notable groups of his studies in these areas have addressed the highly specialized and technical problems of the “[[golden ratio]]” (or “golden section”) in visual art, the significance of [[Musical form|macrostructure in music]], peak aesthetic responses, and the relationship between [[music and emotion]].

==Biography==
Vladimir Konečni grew up in [[Belgrade]] (then the capital of Yugoslavia, now of [[Serbia]]). His parents were Dora D. Konečni (née Vasić), an economist and banker, and Josip J. Konečni, M.D., a Professor of Medicine at the University of Belgrade.

Konečni is of Serbian, Czech, and Austrian descent.&lt;ref name="VJKbio" /&gt;

Konečni is married and has two sons. He lives in San Diego (California, USA), Amsterdam (Netherlands), Tallinn (Estonia), and Belgrade (Serbia).&lt;ref name="VJKbio" /&gt;

==Career==
Konečni received his Bachelor of Arts degree in experimental and clinical psychology, and philosophy, from the University of Belgrade in 1969; as an undergraduate, he published three refereed articles.&lt;ref name="CV" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konecni, V. J. (1968). Psychological bases of application of the item-hierarchy procedure in behavior therapy. ''Psihološki Bilten'' (Yugoslavia), ''1'', 7-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konecni, V. J. (1969). Interaction in the clinical interview: Manipulation of certain formal variables. ''Psihologija'' (Yugoslavia), ''2'', 308-323.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konecni, V. J. (1971). Piaget’s concept of egocentrism and some related issues. ''Psihologija'' (Yugoslavia), ''4'', 197-210.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1970, he began graduate studies in experimental and social psychology at the University of Toronto, Canada, receiving an M.A. degree in 1971 and a Ph.D. in 1973. The title of his dissertation was “Experimental Studies of Human Aggression: The Cathartic Effect.”&lt;ref name="dissert"&gt;[http://search.library.utoronto.ca/details?2951077&amp;uuid=8734e28e-309f-483f-bc7f-2fff03b3d489 University of Toronto Library Catalogue]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK3"&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1975). Annoyance, type and duration of postannoyance activity, and aggression: The “cathartic effect”. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 104'', 76-102.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1973, Konečni was appointed Assistant Professor and thus began his 35-year-long uninterrupted association with the Department of Psychology at the University of California, San Diego (Associate Professor in 1978; Professor in 1982; Emeritus Professor in 2008).

In the period after 1973, he was at various times a Visiting Professor at a number of renowned universities outside the United States, including the London School of Economics, Sydney University, Hebrew University Jerusalem, University of Cape Town, Universiteit van Amsterdam, and Freie Universität Berlin.&lt;ref name="CV" /&gt; In the course of his career so far, Konečni has given colloquia on his research at some 150 universities on all continents.&lt;ref name="CV" /&gt;

===Negative Emotions, Physiological Arousal, and Aggressive Behavior===
In the period 1972-1984, Konečni carried out, in parallel, field experiments on [[Altruism|altruistic]] behavior,&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1972). Some effects of guilt on compliance: A field replication. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 23'', 30-32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J., Libuser, L., Morton, H., &amp; Ebbesen, E. B. (1975). Effects of a violation of personal space on escape and helping responses. ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 11'', 288-299.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J., &amp; Ebbesen, E. B. (1975). Effects of the presence of children on adults’ helping behavior and compliance: Two field studies. ''Journal of Social Psychology, 97'', 181-193.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1976). Altruism: Methodological and definitional issues. ''Science, 194'', 562.&lt;/ref&gt; and laboratory and field studies on human physical and verbal [[aggression]].&lt;ref name="VJK3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK1"&gt;Konečni, V. J., &amp; Doob, A. N. (1972). Catharsis through displacement of aggression. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 23'', 379-387.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK2"&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1974).

Anger and expression of aggression: Effects on aesthetic preference. ''Scientific Aesthetics, 1'', 47-55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK7"&gt;Konečni, V. J., &amp; Ebbesen, E. B. (1976).

Austin &amp; S. Worchel (Eds.), ''The social psychology of intergroup relations'' (pp. 85-102). Monterey, CA: Brooks/Cole.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK10"&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2013).

Psihološki aspekti ekspresije gneva i nasilja na sceni (V. Radovanović Trans.). [Psychological aspects of the expression of anger and violence on the stage]. ''Psihologija u Svetu, 7'', 29-45.&lt;/ref&gt; 

With regard to aggression, on the basis of experimental findings, Konečni distinguished among physical, verbal, play, fantasy and other types of aggression, and proposed the existence of bidirectional causation (behavioral and psychophysiological) between the degree of anger (high arousal antagonistically labeled) and the amount of expressed physical aggression.&lt;ref name="VJK1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK6" /&gt; 

This theoretical model, which emphasized previously unacknowledged feedback loops, seems to resolve the classical issue of “catharsis.” By means of definitional clarity and experimental precision, the model shifts the debate to the many implications of the theoretically sound and empirically observable “cathartic effect,”&lt;ref name="VJK3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baron, R.A. (1977). ''Human aggression''. New York, NY: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, R. M., Konečni, V. J., &amp; Novaco, R. W. (Eds.). (1984). ''Aggression in children and youth''. The Hague, The Netherlands: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; replacing unfocused appeals to sources as diverse as [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Aristotle’s ''Poetics'']], [[Melanie Klein|Kleinian]] play therapy, and Albert Bandura’s social learning theory.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1973). ''Aggression: A social learning analysis''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; This Anger-Aggression Bidirectional-Causation (AABC&lt;ref name="VJK10" /&gt;) theoretical model parsimoniously accounts for hundreds of experimental findings in the literature.&lt;ref name="VJK8" /&gt; These ideas have also been applied to the role of aversive events in the development of intergroup conflict.&lt;ref name="VJK9" /&gt; Subsequently, Konečni's writing on aggression was extended to the concept of revenge&lt;ref name="VJK10" /&gt; and the expression of anger and violence on the stage.&lt;ref name="VJK11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK12" /&gt;

===Legal Psychology and Judicial Decision-Making===
From 1973 to 2011 (the year of Emeritus Professor Ebbe B. Ebbesen’s passing), Ebbesen and Konečni worked on judicial decision-making in the criminal justice system. Using quantitative methods, they studied how various participants in the system – judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, police officers, perpetrators, and others – combine the information available to them into decisions that then become information items for other decision-makers in the system. 

This work has been very influential&lt;ref&gt;Lösel, F., Bender, D., &amp; Bliesener, T. (Eds.). (1992). ''Psychology and law: International perspectives''. Berlin, Germany: Walter de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wrightsman, L. S., Nietzel, M. T., &amp; Fortune, W. H. (1994). ''Psychology and the legal system'' (3rd ed.). Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks/Cole Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lovegrove, A. (1997). ''The framework of judicial sentencing: A study in legal decision making''. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kapardis, A. (2003). ''Psychology and law: A critical introduction'' (2nd ed.). New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been described as “arduous” and “pioneering.”&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt; 

One of its major features has been the comparison of data from experimental simulations to those obtained from archival records and court hearings, often involving the same participants or the same classes of participants (even Superior Court judges participated in the simulations). After their much-cited first article, in 1975, comparing judges’ bail-setting decisions in a simulation to those they made in the courtroom,&lt;ref&gt;Ebbesen, E. B., &amp; Konečni, V. J. (1975). Decision making and information integration in the courts: The setting of bail. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 32'', 805-821.&lt;/ref&gt; Ebbesen and Konečni published a number of critical methodological articles on the key issue of ''external validity'' at many points in the existing research on the legal process, with special reference to jury simulations.&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J., &amp; Ebbesen, E. B. (1979). External validity of research in legal psychology. ''Law and Human Behavior, 3'', 39-70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ebbesen, E. B., &amp; Konečni, V. J. (1980). On the external validity of decision-making research: What do we know about decisions in the real world? In T. S. Wallsten (Ed.), ''Cognitive processes in choice and decision behavior'' (pp. 21-45). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J., &amp; Ebbesen, E. B. (1981). A critique of theory and method in social-psychological approaches to legal issues. In B. D. Sales (Ed.), ''The trial process'' (Vol. 2, pp. 481-498). Perspectives in law and psychology. New York, NY: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J., &amp; Ebbesen, E. B. (1984).

Criticisms of the criminal justice system: A decision-making analysis. ''Behavioral Sciences &amp; the Law, 3'', 177-194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J., &amp; Ebbesen, E. B. (1992). Methodological issues in research on legal decision-making, with special reference to experimental simulations. In F. Lösel, D. Bender &amp; T. Bliesener (Eds.), ''Psychology and Law'' (pp. 413-423).

Oxford, England: Pergamon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and critiques of the resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Shah, A. S. (1988). A critique of legal psychology. ''Contemporary Psychology, 33'', 586-588.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1982, Konečni and Ebbesen edited a book (dedicated to [[Egon Brunswik]] and [[Kurt Lewin]]), ''The Criminal Justice System: A Social-Psychological Analysis'', to which they contributed five chapters that outlined their theoretical and methodological viewpoint and addressed several major empirical issues.&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J., &amp; Ebbesen, E. B. (Eds.). (1982). ''The criminal justice system: A social-psychological analysis''. San Francisco, CA: W. H. Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the chapters presented the results of a large project (over one thousand cases) on judicial sentencing for felonies in California; among other findings, it included a causal analysis that eliminated several popular views of sentencing and highlighted the decisive role of probation officers.&lt;ref&gt;Ebbesen, E. B., &amp; Konečni, V. J. (1981). The process of sentencing adult felons: A causal analysis of judicial decisions. In B. D. Sales (Ed.), ''The trial process'' (Vol. 2, pp. 413-458).

Ebbesen (Eds.), ''The criminal justice system: A social-psychological analysis'' (pp. 293-332). San Francisco, CA: W. H. Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Konečni and Ebbesen, with several students, also conducted empirical investigations of “mentally disordered sex offenders,” child-custody decisions, and other issues of societal importance.&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J., Mulcahy, E. M., &amp; Ebbesen, E. B. (1980). Prison or mental hospital: Factors affecting the processing of persons suspected of being “mentally disordered sex offenders”. In P. D.

They also published extensive critiques of what they believed were mistaken, yet entrenched, views on another major issue in legal psychology, namely, the probative value of prior eyewitness memory research in general,&lt;ref&gt;Ebbesen, E. B., &amp; Konečni, V. J. (1997). Eyewitness memory research: Probative v. prejudicial value. ''Expert Evidence, 5'', 2-28.&lt;/ref&gt; and, specifically, the probative value of psychologists’ testimony on eyewitness issues in the cases of exonerations by DNA evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V.

Czerederecka, T. Jaskiewicz-Obydzinska &amp; J. Wojcikiewicz (Eds.), ''Forensic psychology and law: Traditional questions and new ideas'' (pp. 41-45). Krakow, Poland: Institute of Forensic Research.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Finally, while working in Konečni’s laboratory, G. Kette, an Austrian psychologist, coauthored two articles with Konečni on communication channels and the decoding and integration of cues in judicial decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Kette, G., &amp; Konečni, V. J. (1996). Communication channels and gender differences in decoding and integration of cues in legal decision-making. In G. Davies, S. Lloyd-Bostock, M. McMurran &amp; C. Wilson (Eds.) ''Psychology, law, and criminal justice: International developments in research and practice'' (pp. 314-326). Berlin, Germany: Walter de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kette, G., &amp;  Konečni, V.

[Gender-specific decoding and integration of nonverbal information in judicial judgements]. ''Gruppendynamik, 3'', 309-328.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Empirical Aesthetics===
Throughout his career, Vladimir Konečni has conducted numerous experiments in diverse areas of [[International Association of Empirical Aesthetics|empirical aesthetics]] – a field dominated by scientifically oriented psychologists and thus often referred to as psychological or (psycho-) aesthetics (distinct from “[[aesthetics]],” which usually refers to philosophical aesthetics).&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2005). On philosophical and empirical aesthetics. In A. Šļahova (Ed.), ''Proceedings of the 4th International Conference Person-Color-Nature-Music'' (pp. 46-55). Daugavpils, Latvia: Saule.&lt;/ref&gt; In his first article (1976) in psycho-aesthetics, Konečni, influenced by [[Daniel Berlyne]] (one of his graduate-school mentors&lt;ref name="VJKbio" /&gt;), successfully combined work on physiological arousal with his own prior work on the “cathartic effect” to study music preference (as a dependent variable).&lt;ref name="VJK6" /&gt; A broad and innovative empirical approach to the study of emotional, mood, and personality antecedents of aesthetic preference and choice in both visual art and music resulted in a number of publications with several American and European graduate students and in various languages.&lt;ref name="VJK13"&gt;Konečni, V. J., &amp; Sargent-Pollock, D. (1976). Choice between melodies differing in complexity under divided-attention conditions.

''Music Perception, 2'', 459-470.&lt;/ref&gt; Konečni also wrote two widely cited theoretical articles that addressed (a) the social, emotional, and cognitive determinants of aesthetic preference and (b) the measurable psychological consequences of exposure to aesthetic stimuli,&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1979). Determinants of aesthetic preference and effects of exposure to aesthetic stimuli: Social, emotional and cognitive factors. In B. A. Maher (Ed.), ''Progress in experimental personality research'' (Vol. 9, pp. 149-197). New York, NY: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK16"&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1982). Social interaction and musical preference. In D. Deutsch (Ed.), ''The psychology of music'' (pp. 497-516). New York, NY: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in his formulation of the “Model of Aesthetic Episode” (MAE), which he continued to refine over many years.&lt;ref name="VJK17"&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2013). Empirical psycho-aesthetics and her sisters: Substantive and methodological issues (Part 2). ''Journal of Aesthetic Education, 47'', 1-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Visual Art====
Various problems in the area of visual art have been frequently and to this day investigated by Konečni. There have been articles, inspired by MAE, on the interactive effects of visual art and music on emotion and mood,&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1994). Interactive effects of music and visual art. In I. Deliège (Ed.), ''Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference for Music Perception and Cognition'' (pp. 23-24). Liège, Belgium: Université de Liège.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1995). Interactive effects of music and visual art in different emotional states. In I. Gorlova, V. M. Petrov &amp; Yu. Rags (Eds.), ''Proceedings of the International Conference on The Human in the World of Art: Informational Aspects'' (pp. 126-133). Moscow, Russia.&lt;/ref&gt; culminating recently (2010, 2015) in two theoretical articles.&lt;ref name="VJK18"&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2010). The influence of affect on music choice. In P. N. Juslin &amp; J. A. Sloboda (Eds.), ''Handbook of music and emotion: Theory, research, applications'' (pp. 697-723).

''American Journal of Psychology, 128'', 305-322.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he is one of very few psychoaestheticians who has been able to study the creative process ''in vivo'' – in his experimental study of portraiture.&lt;ref name="VJK17" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1991). Portraiture: An experimental study of the creative process. ''Leonardo, 24'', 325-328.&lt;/ref&gt; Konečni has also written about the politics and social ecology of architecture – specifically in Stalin’s Soviet Union and Hitler’s Germany – and he has recently addressed the aesthetic and social issues regarding new museums in China.&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1996). Politika i social'naya ekologiya arkhitektur'i. [Politics and the social ecology of architecture]. ''Kul'turologicheskie Zapiski, 2'', 175-189.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2015). Two extraordinary new museums in south-eastern China. ''Art and Design Review, 3'', 76-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The “Golden Ratio”====
For about ten years (1995-2005), Konečni did a great deal of experimental and theoretical work on the “[[golden ratio]]” (or “golden section”).&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1997). The vase on the mantelpiece: The golden section in context. ''Empirical Studies of the Arts, 15'', 177-207.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2001). The golden section in the structure of 20th-century paintings. ''Rivista di Psicologia dell'Arte'' (Nuova Serie), ''12'', 27-42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J., &amp; Cline, L. E. (2001). The ‘golden woman’: An exploratory study of women’s proportions in paintings. ''Visual Arts Research, 27'', 69-78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2002). “Zlatni presek” kao estetska zamisao i empirijska činjenica. [The ‘golden section’ as aesthetic idea and empirical fact]. ''Likovni Život, 97-98'', 81-87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2003). Kuldloige kui esteetikamote ja empiiriline toik. [The ‘golden section’ as aesthetic idea and empirical fact]. ''Akadeemia, 15'', 1253-1271.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK20"&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2003). The golden section: Elusive, but detectable. ''Creativity Research Journal, 15'', 267-276.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2003). The ‘golden section’ as aesthetic idea and empirical fact [CD, No.1022]. ''Proceedings of the XVth International Congress of Aesthetics: The Great Book of Aesthetics''. Tokyo, Japan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK21"&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2005). On the ‘golden section’. ''Visual Arts Research, 31'', 76-87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2006). On the “golden section” (Chinese Trans. by Geng Yan). ''Art and Science, 2'', 154-160.&lt;/ref&gt; He has repeatedly emphasized the need for distinguishing among the numerous facets of this classical problem in aesthetics and art: Objects in nature vs. objects in art and architecture; the known presence vs. absence of artist’s intention in utilizing the ratio; the degree of perceivers’ awareness of the ratio in an object and the influence of that awareness, if any, on the object’s aesthetic appeal. In his work on paintings, Konečni used many different measures, including the dimensions of the rectangle (frame); the vertical and horizontal bisections of a painting; and the dimensions of significant depicted objects within the painting. He considered the analysis of this variety of measures indispensable and developed several methodological innovations, as well as refinements of the classical [[Gustav Fechner|Fechnerian]] ones. Konečni has described the golden ratio as “elusive but detectable,”&lt;ref name="VJK20" /&gt; and more likely to influence the results of carefully conducted experiments as part of higher-order interactions than as a main effect; its “contextuality and configurality” make it, he has suggested, comparable to concepts in Zen aesthetics.&lt;ref name="VJK21" /&gt;

====Neuroaesthetics====
This new, 21st century, area of research has been considered a branch of empirical aesthetics. Konečni has described its main characteristics, and has critically analyzed some of the claims made by several prominent practitioners, arguing that these claims are exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2012). Empirical psycho-aesthetics and her sisters: Substantive and methodological issues (Part 1). ''Journal of Aesthetic Education, 46'', 1-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2012). Empirical psycho-aesthetics and her sisters: Substantive and methodological issues. In F. Dorsch &amp; D.-E. Ratiu (Eds.), ''Proceedings of the European Society for Aesthetics, 4'', 271-315.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2015). Reflections on psychological and neuroaesthetics. ''Theoria, 58'', 5-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music Psychology===
Konečni has been heavily involved in many aspects of music psychology. In addition to the experimental and theoretical articles on the effects of a variety of factors (including high arousal and other forms of stress) on music preference and choice (for example, among melodies differing in complexity),&lt;ref name="VJK13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK16" /&gt; he developed a new methodology to investigate the theoretically interesting question of “hedonic effects of development vs. chance in resolved and unresolved aural episodes.”&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1999). Expression and meaning in Tasol: Hedonic effects of development vs. chance in resolved and unresolved aural episodes. ''Musikpsychologie, 14'', 102-123.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he contributed to topics of interest to musicians, such as a two-part article that presented a psychological analysis of J. S. Bach’s ''St. Matthew Passion'',&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1986, July). Bach's St. Matthew Passion: A rudimentary psychological analysis (Part 1). ''BACH, 17'', 10-15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1986, October). Bach's St. Matthew Passion: A rudimentary psychological analysis (Part 2). ''BACH, 17'', 3-16.&lt;/ref&gt; and another on mode and tempo in Western classical music of the common-practice era.&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2009). Mode and tempo in Western classical music of the common-practice era: My grandmother was largely right – but no one knows why. ''Empirical Musicology Review, 4'', 23-26.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Konečni wrote about the (Latin) ''Requiem'' by the Russian composer Vyacheslav Artyomov and about the playing style of the Canadian pianist Glenn Gould.&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1997, October–November). Rekviem Vyacheslava Artyomova: Proizvedenie gumanista? [Vyacheslav Artyomov's Requiem: A humanist document?]. ''In the concert program for the performances of the Requiem at the Moscow Conservatory Great Hall'' (pp. 11-16). Moscow, Russia: Fond Duchovnogo Tvorchestva.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1991) [Review of the book ''Glenn Gould, a life and variations'' by O. Friedrich]. ''Musik Psychologie, 8'', 148-153.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also his three contributions to ''Music in the Social and Behavioral Sciences: An Encyclopedia'' by SAGE&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2014). Emotions, aesthetic. In W. F. Thompson (Ed.), ''Music in the social and behavioral sciences: An encyclopedia'' (Vol. 1, pp. 382-385). London, England: SAGE.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J.

(2014). Music research, causal effects. In W. F. Thompson (Ed.), ''Music in the social and behavioral sciences: An encyclopedia'' (Vol. 2, pp. 756-761). London, England: SAGE.&lt;/ref&gt; and a highly technical review of Steven Jan’s book ''The Memetics of Music: A Neo-Darwinian View of Musical Structure and Culture''.&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2008). [Review of the book ''The memetics of music: A neo-Darwinian view of musical structure and culture'' by S. Jan]. ''British Journal of Aesthetics, 48'', 463-465.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan, S. B. (2007). ''The memetics of music: A neo-Darwinian view of musical structure and culture''. Aldershot, England: Ashgate.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Macrostructure in Music====
In 1984, Konečni published an article with five experiments on the “elusive effects of artists’ ‘messages,’”&lt;ref name="VJK17" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1984). Elusive effects of artists’ “messages”. In W. R. Crozier &amp; A. J. Chapman (Eds.), ''Cognitive processes in the perception of art'' (pp. 71-93). Amsterdam, The Netherlands: North Holland.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crozier, W. A., &amp; Chapman, A. J. (Eds.). (1984). ''Cognitive processes in the perception of art''. Amsterdam, The Netherlands: North Holland.&lt;/ref&gt; in which “messages” were defined broadly to include, in the two experiments devoted to music, the [[Musical form|macrostructure of the pieces]], such as the original ordering of the movements in [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven’s]] piano sonatas and string quartets. Surprisingly, and contrary to strongly held musicological conventions, even drastic reordering of the movements produced negligible decrements in listeners’ enjoyment. Follow-up experiments produced analogous results; a variety of highly esteemed and diverse music pieces were used as research stimuli in this work, including [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach’s]] ''Goldberg Variations'' (diverse ordering of the variations) and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart’s]] ''Symphony in G-Minor'', K. 550 (reordering of the key structural parts of the first movement).&lt;ref&gt;Gotlieb, H., &amp; Konečni, V. J. (1985). The effects of instrumentation, playing style, and structure in the Goldberg Variations by Johann Sebastian Bach.

The effects of structural interventions in the First Movement of Mozart's Symphony in G-Minor K. 550 on aesthetic preference. ''Music Perception, 10'', 63-72.&lt;/ref&gt; These and related experiments were further discussed by Konečni and Karno in 1994, at which time they also summarized the previous debate with musicologists Robert Batt and [[Nicholas Cook]] about this research.&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J., &amp; Karno, M. (1994). Empirical investigations of the hedonic and emotional effects of musical structure. ''Musik Psychologie, 11'', 119-137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (1987).

====Music and Emotion====
Konečni has been very active in this area since about 2002. There have been reports of laboratory experiments,&lt;ref name="VJK22"&gt;Konečni, V. J., Wanic, R. A., &amp; Brown, A. (2007).

''The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, 73'', 214-218.&lt;/ref&gt; Konečni has taken a strong and elaborate – albeit minority – stance against what he regards is an avalanche of insufficiently substantiated claims regarding the relationship between music and emotion, and specifically against the thesis that music ''causes'' emotion. In a recent book review, he wrote: “The authors never clearly state something very simple and almost certainly true: ''some'' music ''may'', ''sometimes'', in ''some'' people, under ''some'' circumstances, elicit ''some'' psychobiological emotions, but never nearly as powerful as the correspondent emotions in social life.”&lt;ref name="VJK29" /&gt; Konečni has based this view on a careful examination of the literature in both music psychology and philosophical aesthetics; on the Prototypical Emotion-Episode Model (PEEM, which he had developed over many years);&lt;ref name="VJK24" /&gt; on his own experimental findings and theoretical work regarding music and emotion;&lt;ref name="VJK18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK23" /&gt; and on what he perceives as widespread neglect of definitional precision and sound methodology in this multidisciplinary field, including in numerous highly cited research articles.&lt;ref name="VJK18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK24" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK27" /&gt;

====Anti-“Emotivism”====
Konečni has written that there is ample evidence to view the majority position about the relationship between music and emotion as an aspect of the socio-culturally prevalent “emotivism,”&lt;ref name="VJK25" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK26" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VJK28" /&gt; which he distinguished from [[emotivism]] in ethics, and defined as “the propensity for excessive insertion of emotion and ‘feeling’ into both lay and scientific theories of mental life, motives, needs, and daily behavior, in matters artistic and non-artistic.”&lt;ref name="VJK25" /&gt; He has suggested that the proclivity for emotional and quasi-emotional excess is related to the prevalent anti-narrative social climate, which often ignores evidence and reason.

Konečni recently published a theoretical article on emotion in the domain of painting and art installations&lt;ref name="VJK19" /&gt; and discussed emotivism in this context also.&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2013). A critique of emotivism in aesthetic accounts of visual art. ''Philosophy Today, 57'', 388-400.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2014).

===Peak Aesthetic Experiences===
This issue is one in which philosophical aesthetics and psycho-aesthetics are intertwined – in general and in Konečni’s extensive work in the past decade. In 2005, he published a theoretical article outlining his “aesthetic trinity theory” (ATT),&lt;ref name="VJK30"&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2005). The aesthetic trinity: Awe, being moved, thrills. ''Bulletin of Psychology and the Arts, 5'', 27-44.&lt;/ref&gt; in which “trinity” refers to a tripartite hierarchical organization of peak aesthetic responses&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2005). Ancient and contemporary aesthetic “emotions”. ''Proceedings of the Wuhan University Aesthetics Conference Beauty and the way of modern life'' (pp. 351-367). Wuhan, China: Wuhan University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konečni, V. J. (2006). Ancient and contemporary aesthetic “emotions” (Chinese Trans. by Yang Yi &amp; Deng Yang-zhou).

Many aspects of ATT are testable and the results would speak to both philosophical and psychological aestheticians.&lt;ref name="VJK30" /&gt;

The '''World Pantheist Movement''' ('''WPM''') is the world's largest organization of people associated with [[pantheism]], a [[philosophy]] which asserts that [[spirituality]] should be centered on [[nature]]. The WPM promotes [[naturalistic pantheism]]&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Bron|title=Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature|date=2008|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=1441122788|pages=1341–1342|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i4mvAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1342&amp;lpg=PA134|accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WPM grew out of a mailing list started by [[Paul Harrison (pantheist)|Paul Harrison]] in 1997, arising around his Scientific Pantheism website. An initial group of 15 volunteers worked on a joint statement of agreed beliefs (the Pantheist Credo).&lt;ref name=Credo&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pantheist Credo|url=http://www.pantheism.net/manifest.htm|publisher=World Pantheist Movement|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WPM officially opened for membership in December 1999.

== Beliefs and practices ==
The official views of the World Pantheist Movement are listed in the nine points of the Belief Statement (see external links).
These are summarized as follows:&lt;ref name=Credo /&gt;
    
* Reverence, awe, wonder and a feeling of unity with Nature and the wider Universe.
* Respect and active care for the rights of all humans and other living beings.
* Celebration of our lives in our bodies on this beautiful earth as a joy and a privilege.
* Realism - acceptance that the external world exists independently of human consciousness or perception.
* Strong naturalism - without belief in supernatural realms, afterlives, beings or forces.
* Respect for reason, evidence and the scientific method as our best ways of understanding nature and the Universe.
* Promotion of religious tolerance, freedom of religion and complete separation of state and religion.

The specific Statement is as follows:&lt;ref name=Credo /&gt;

* 1. We revere and celebrate the Universe as the totality of being, past, present and future. It is self-organizing, ever-evolving and inexhaustibly diverse. Its overwhelming power, beauty and fundamental mystery compel the deepest human reverence and wonder.
* 2. All matter, energy, and life are an interconnected unity of which we are an inseparable part. We rejoice in our existence and seek to participate ever more deeply in this unity through knowledge, celebration, meditation, empathy, love, ethical action and art.
* 3. We are an integral part of Nature, which we should cherish, revere and preserve in all its magnificent beauty and diversity. We should strive to live in harmony with Nature locally and globally. We acknowledge the inherent value of all life, human and non-human, and strive to treat all living beings with compassion and respect.
* 4. All humans are equal centers of awareness of the Universe and nature, and all deserve a life of equal dignity and mutual respect. To this end we support and work towards freedom, democracy, justice, and non-discrimination, and a world community based on peace, sustainable ways of life, full respect for human rights and an end to poverty.
* 5. There is a single kind of substance, energy/matter, which is vibrant and infinitely creative in all its forms. Body and mind are indivisibly united.
* 6. We see death as the return to nature of our elements, and the end of our existence as individuals. The forms of "afterlife" available to humans are natural ones, in the natural world. Our actions, our ideas and memories of us live on, according to what we do in our lives. Our genes live on in our families, and our elements are endlessly recycled in nature.
* 7. We honor reality, and keep our minds open to the evidence of the senses and of science's unending quest for deeper understanding. These are our best means of coming to know the Universe, and on them we base our aesthetic and religious feelings about reality.
* 8. Every individual has direct access through perception, emotion and meditation to ultimate reality, which is the Universe and Nature. There is no need for mediation by priests, gurus or revealed scriptures.
* 9. We uphold the separation of religion and state, and the universal human right of freedom of religion. We recognize the freedom of all pantheists to express and celebrate their beliefs, as individuals or in groups, in any non-harmful ritual, symbol or vocabulary that is meaningful to them.

The WPM encourages wonder and awe at the beauty and mystery of the Universe and fosters the full range of positive emotional responses to life. It promotes ethical principles such as respect for the rights of humans and other living creatures, non-discrimination, justice and peace.

It respects the scientific method as humanity's most accurate approach for deepening its understanding of nature, while accepting that science is a never-ending quest and that some technologies have created massive social and environmental problems. It accepts that there are some questions that science may never answer - such as why anything exists, rather than nothing at all. It does not give any credence to ideas such as a separate soul distinct from the body, or of the consciousness' survival after death, but believes that people achieve a form of immortality through the ongoing effects of their actions, the things they create, others' memories, the legacy of their genes, and the recycling of their elements in nature.

It does not prescribe any particular set of religious practices, instead leaving the matter up to individuals. Pantheistic activity is viewed not as a ritual that must be upheld in order to placate gods and spirits, or to follow rules prescribed in scripture, but rather as an individual expression of one's deep feelings towards Nature and the wider Universe. Among members and friends of the WPM, the most common practices are meditation and close, daily observation of nature. Both of these are sometimes accompanied by the use of natural objects such as pebbles, shells, bark etc. About a quarter of WPM members report using some form of [[pagan]] celebration, but this is done for self-expression and fun, rather than out of literal belief in pagan theologies.

Members and friends may meet in small groups, the format of which varies. Groups may discuss general ideas; watch and discuss relevant (often nature-related) books, or films; share personal experiences; go on nature outings; or participate in nature conservation projects or other forms of community service.

Viewing the recycling of human elements in soil, water, and the atmosphere as a major element of human "immortality," the WPM supports the "natural death" approach. In this context, it seeks to return the elements to the natural cycle in the fastest and most responsible way possible, such as burial in a biodegradable container in nature-reserve type grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Naturalizing Death|url=http://www.pantheism.net/pan/free/pan15s.pdf|publisher=World Pantheist Movement|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization and activities ==
The WPM is governed by a board of 13 directors. Its main forms of activity consist of:
* A Facebook Page with over 162,000 members&lt;ref name=Facebook&gt;{{cite web|title=Pantheism Facebook group|url=http://www.facebook.com/Pantheism?v=wall|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A richly featured social network with over 3,000 members with wide-ranging discussions and interest groups, as well as 34 local forum groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pantheism Forum at Ning|url=http://pantheists.ning.com/|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Its periodical, ''Pan''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public PAN Magazine Issues|url=https://www.scribd.com/pan8009/shelf|publisher=[[Scribd]]|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  explores the possibilities of naturalistic spirituality across a wide range of fields.
* Saving land to be managed in the interests of native wildlife, through direct sponsorship of conservation organizations, member click groups, and a pantheist wildlife reserves scheme. {{convert|300|acre|km2}} have been saved to date.
* A small [[Folding@home]] group that has contributed 204 work units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Team 13161's contributions to Folding@home|url=http://fah-web.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/main.py?qtype=teampage&amp;teamnum=13161|publisher=Folding@Home|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An associated [[SETI@home]] group that has amassed 2,138,435 credits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientific Pantheist|url=http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/team_display.php?teamid=31590|publisher=SETI@Home|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Pantheist Movement symbol is the spiral as seen in the curves of the nautilus shell, or in the spiral arms of a galaxy, showing the link between the cosmic physical (thousands of light years) and the biological. Sometimes the Nautilus spiral alone is used; it embodies the [[Fibonacci series]] and the [[golden ratio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harrison|first=Paul|title=Pantheist Art|url=http://www.pantheism.net/pan/free/pan9.pdf|publisher=World Pantheist Movement|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diversity of beliefs ==
The WPM has a policy of accepting a diversity of language and methods of celebration among its members, although - following large surveys of its website visitors' preferences - it generally avoids overtly theistic or religious language in its official literature. Some members view themselves as [[atheism|atheists]], while others hold [[agnosticism|agnostic]] stances. Some members use [[theism|theistic]] vocabulary, however they do not believe in a thinking [[Creator deity|creator god]], and simply use the word "[[God]]" to describe their feelings of reverence towards Nature and the wider Universe. Some members, while accepting the basic naturalistic beliefs of the WPM, like to combine these with symbols and ceremonies from other traditions, most commonly paganism, philosophical [[Taoism]], and [[Buddhism]].

The WPM does not interfere with or promote any specific personal choices regarding sexuality or the use of recreational or psychotropic drugs. Similarly, members have a diversity of views on [[vegetarianism]], hunting, non-violence, and many other political, social, and technological issues. All these issues are left to members' understanding of Naturalistic Pantheistic morality and the Belief Statement.

== Relationship to other pantheist organizations ==
[[Paul Harrison (pantheist)|Paul Harrison]], the World Pantheist Movement founder, was vice president of the [[Universal Pantheist Society]] (UPS) in the mid-1990s, but resigned after becoming skeptical of the possibility of promoting "generic" pantheism given the very wide variety of beliefs held by different types of pantheist (specifically, by those with naturalistic beliefs and those with dualist or idealist beliefs). The WPM has since gained a membership considerably larger than the UPS, along with a wider circle of non-members who participate in its online forum and Facebook pages.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

{{nihongo|'''''Yamato-damashii'''''|大和魂||"Japanese spirit"}} or {{nihongo|'''''Yamato-gokoro'''''|大和心||"Japanese heart/mind"}} is a [[Japanese language]] term that refers to the cultural values and characteristics of the [[Japanese people]]. The phrase was coined in the [[Heian period]] to describe the indigenous Japanese 'spirit' or cultural values as opposed to cultural values of foreign nations such as those identified through contact with [[Tang dynasty]] [[China]].  Later, a qualitative contrast between Japanese and Chinese spirit was elicited from the term. [[Edo period]] writers and [[samurai]] used it to augment and support the [[Bushido]] concept of honor and valor.  [[Japanese nationalism|Japanese nationalists]] propagandized ''Yamato-damashii''&amp;nbsp;– "the brave, daring, and indomitable spirit of Japanese people"&amp;nbsp;– as one of the key [[Statism in Shōwa Japan|Japanese military-political doctrines in the Shōwa period]]. English translations of ''Yamato-damashii'' include the "Japanese spirit", "Japanese soul", "Yamato spirit", and "The Soul of Old Japan". [[Lafcadio Hearn]] mentions the latter in connection with [[Shinto]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;For this national type of moral character was invented the name ''Yamato-damashi'' (or ''Yamato-gokoro''),&amp;nbsp;— the Soul of Yamato (or Heart of Yamato),&amp;nbsp;— the appellation of the old province of Yamato, seat of the early emperors, being figuratively used for the entire country. We might correctly, though less literally, interpret the expression ''Yamato-damashi'' as "The Soul of Old Japan". (1904:177)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Origin of the term==
Originally ''Yamato-damashi'' did not bear the bellicose weight or ideological timbre that it later assumed in pre-war modern Japan. It first occurs in the {{nihongo|''Otome''|乙女|}} section of ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' (Chapter 21), as a native virtue that flourishes best, not as a contrast to foreign civilization but, rather precisely, when it is grounded on a solid basis in Chinese learning. Thus we read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No, the safe thing is to give him a good, solid fund of knowledge. It is when there is a fund of Chinese learning (''zae'' 才)  that the Japanese spirit (''yamato-damashii'' 大和魂) is respected in the world. ([[Murasaki Shikibu]], ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' tr. [[Edward Seidensticker]], 1976, 1:362) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Lexicology==
''Yamato-damashii'' "Japan, Japanese" [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] ''Yamato'' ([[Wikt:大和|大和]], "great harmony") with ''damashii'', which is the [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] ''[[rendaku]]'' pronunciation of ''tamashii'' ([[Wikt:魂|魂]] "spirit; soul"). Both these ''[[kanji]]'' ([[Chinese characters]] used in Japan) readings ''Yamato'' (大和) and ''damashii'' (魂) are native Japanese ''[[kun'yomi]]'', while the ''Wakon'' (和魂 "Japanese spirit") reading is Sinitic ''[[on'yomi]]'' borrowed from Chinese ''Héhún'' (和魂).

''Yamato'' is historically the second of three common Japanese [[endonym]]s (or autonyms) for 'Japan; Japanese'.
*''[[Wa (Japan)|Wa]]'' ([[Wikt:倭|倭]] or [[Wikt:和|和]]) is Japan's oldest endonym and derives from the  [[Han dynasty]] Chinese exonym ''Wō'' 倭 "Japan, Japanese". This character 倭, which graphically combines the [[Wikt:亻|亻]] "human, person" [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]] and a ''wěi'' [[Wikt:委|委]] "bend" [[phonetic]], was usually pronounced ''wēi'' in [[Classical Chinese]] compounds like ''wēichí'' 倭遲 "winding, circuitous", but scholars have interpreted ''Wō'' 倭 "Japanese" as connoting either "submissive; docile" or "short; dwarf". In the 8th century, Japanese scribes replaced the [[Graphic pejoratives in written Chinese|pejorative Chinese character]]  倭 for ''Wa'' "Japan" with ''Wa'' 和 "harmony; peace".
*''Yamato'' (大和, "great harmony") is the oldest native name for "Japan". ''Daiwa'' and ''Taiwa'' (borrowed from Chinese ''dàhé'' 大和) are ''on'yomi'' readings. This name ''Yamato'' (大和) originally referred to "[[Yamato Province]]", around present-day [[Nara Prefecture]], where [[Emperor Jimmu]] legendarily founded Japan. Common words with this [[prefix]] include ''Yamato-jidai'' (大和時代 "[[Yamato period]]", 250-710 CE), ''Yamato-minzoku'' (大和民族 "[[Yamato people]]; Japanese race"), and ''[[Yamato-e]]'' (大和絵 "traditional Japanese-style paintings").
*''Nihon'' or ''Nippon'' ([[Wikt:日本|日本]], "sun's origin"; "[[Japan]]") is the normal modern [[endonym]]. Compared with the neutral pronunciation ''Nihon'', ''[[Names of Japan|Nippon]]'' has more nationalistic connotations. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}
In current Japanese usage, ''Wa'' 倭 is an archaic [[variant Chinese character]] for ''Wa'' 和, ''Yamato'' is a literary and historical term, and ''Nihon'' is the usual name for "Japan; Japanese".

''Tamashii'' or ''tama'' (魂 "soul; spirit; ghost" or 霊 "spirit; soul") is Japanese ''kun'yomi'', while ''kon'' or ''gon'' is Chinese ''on'yomi'' (from ''hún'' [[Hun and po|魂]]). The [[Shinto]]-influenced semantics of Japanese ''tama''/''tamashii'' exceed customary English concepts of "spirit", "soul", or "ghost", besides the human soul, it also includes diverse spiritual forces found in nature. [[Roy Andrew Miller]] suggests that German ''[[Geist]]'' or French ''[[Wikt:élan|élan]]'' are better translations than English ''spirit'' or ''soul'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;But finally we must conclude that nothing in any commonly used European language, including English, really does justice to Japanese ''tama''. The spirit, soul, ''Geist'', or ''élan'' to which the Japanese term has reference, whether it is the ''tama'' of ''Yamato-damashii'' or the ''tama'' of ''kotodama'', is a vital and active entity that plays no part in any usual Western-language imagery or expression. We have no such word, and we make use of no imagery capitalizing upon the concepts that it employs; but the Japanese have, and they do. (1982:131) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[Kotodama]]'' ({{lang|ja|言霊}}, "word spirit", approximately "[[magic word]]") illustrate this traditional Japanese belief about ''tama(shii)'' energies. ''[[Kenkyūsha's New Japanese-English Dictionary]]'' (5th ed., 2003) gives ''kotodama'' translation [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|equivalents]] and a revealing usage example: "{{lang|ja|ことだま【言霊】}}, the soul [spirit] of language; the miraculous power of language [a phrase, a spell]. ̍ ⇨ {{lang|ja|言霊の幸(さきわ)う国}} Japan, "the land where the mysterious workings of language bring bliss"."

''[[Yamato nadeshiko]]'' ({{lang|ja|大和撫子}}, "Japanese [[fringed pink]]") is a floral metaphor for "the idealized traditional Japanese woman". During World War II, ultra-nationalists popularized ''Yamato-nadeshiko'' as the female manifestation of ''Yamato-damashii''.

== Later history==
The record of ''Yamato-damashii'' dates back one millennium to the Heian period (794–1185) of Japanese history, when [[Chinese culture]] and [[Chinese language]] were highly influential.

''Yamato-gokoro'' (大和心 "Japanese heart; Japanese mind" is the closest synonym of ''Yamato-damashii''. The Heian poet [[Akazome Emon]] first used ''Yamato-gokoro'' in her ''Goshūi Wakashū'' (後拾遺和歌集 "Later Collection of [[Waka (poetry)|Waka]] Gleanings," 1086).

Since ''Wa'' 和 commonly abbreviates ''Yamato'' 大和 "Japan; Japanese", 和魂 (also read ''Wakon'') is a contraction of ''Yamato-damashii''. The ''[[Konjaku Monogatarishū]]'' (circa 1120) first uses it describing a burglar who murdered a nattering scholar of Chinese classical law. "Although Kiyohara no Yoshizumi (清原善澄) had admirable learning, he is said to have died in this childish way because he did not have the slightest knowledge of the Japanese spirit" (tr. Carr 1994:283).

For centuries after its use by Heian authors ''Yamato-damashii'' was rarely recorded until the late [[Edo period]] (1600–1868). One [[Kamakura period|Kamakura-period]] exception is the ''[[Gukanshō]]'' history (ca. 1220), which uses ''Yamato-damashii'' (和魂) in praising the character of child [[Emperor Toba]] (r. 1107–1123).
&lt;blockquote&gt; Still, he had the personality of (his uncle) Fujiwara no Kinzane (藤原公実) characterized by Chinese learning and followed in the footsteps of (his ancestor) [[Sugawara no Michizane]], but Toba had even more Japanese spirit than either of them. (adapted from Carr 1994:283)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Three new "Japanese spirit" phrases originated around the 1867 [[Meiji Restoration]]. First, the modernization {{nihongo|''Nihon-damashii''|日本魂|}} was fashioned by [[Kyokutei Bakin]], a famous [[samurai]] author of ''[[Gesaku]]''. His ''Chinsetsu Yumiharizuki'' ("The Crescent Moon", 1811) quotes [[Minamoto no Tametomo]] discussing ''[[seppuku]]'' rituals: "I admit that a person who does not care about dying when on the verge of death may superficially have the Japanese spirit, but I think this is a misunderstanding from not having learned about it." (tr. Carr 1994:284). Second, ''Wakon-kansai'' (和魂漢才 "Japanese spirit and Chinese scholarship") occurs in the ''Kanke ikai'' (菅家遺戒 "Sugawara's dying instructions"). Third, ''Wakon-yōsai'' (和魂洋才 "Japanese spirit and Western techniques") was created by Yoshikawa Tadayasu (吉川忠安) in his ''Kaika sakuron'' (開化策論 , "Questions and Themes on Progress", 1867).

Following the Japanese victories in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and [[Russo-Japanese War]], nationalists made ''Wakon-yōsai'' into a catchphrase for [[modernization]] and [[militarization]], and developed ''Yamato-damashii'' into what Miller (1982:13) calls "the official rallying cry for the Japanese armed forces in [[World War II]]."

In the present day, ''Yamato-damashii'' is historically associated with [[Japanese nationalism]], but is commonly used in ''[[Nihonjinron]]'' discussions and sports media. It is the motto for the international Purebred [[mixed martial arts]] school headed by Japanese-American [[Enson Inoue]]. Professor David Pollack predicts that ''Yamato-damashii'' will become extinct.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Synthesis comes to an end only when antithesis ceases to appear. For many centuries Japan found its most significant antithesis in China. During the last century and a half the West has been the antithetical term in the dialectic, and as always it has been in that "other" that Japan has sought its own image, peering anxiously for signs of its own identity into the mirror of the rest of the world. After the challenge of Western technology has been successfully met, one wonders what will be left that is "alien," besides the very fact that the historically necessary "other" is lacking. In that case, "Japanese spirit" (Yamato-damashii) will find itself face to face with the most frightening "other" of all – its lack – at which point opposition must cease or else feed upon itself. (1986:52-3) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Definitions==
Racially and ethnically offensive words are problematic for dictionaries. [[Lexicographer]]s and publishers have editorial policies for treating [[ethnic slurs]] and insults. For example, [[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]] (4th ed., 2000) defines ''Jap'' as "''Offensive Slang''. Used as a disparaging term for a person of Japanese birth or descent."

Michael Carr argues that ''Yamato-damashii'' (1994:280-1) "significantly differs from everyday racist slurs because it is not an overt insult, it is the opposite: an ethnic adulation. It belongs to a special category of benedictions such as ''[[Manifest Destiny]]'' or ''[[Chosen People]]'' that imply national, racial, or ethnic self-conceit." The nationalist and racist connotations of Japanese ''Yamato-damashii'' are comparable with German ''Herrenvolk'' ("[[Master race]]").

Carr lexicographically analyzed ''Yamato-damashii'' definitions among modern general-purpose [[Japanese dictionaries]] from four publishers, namely, ''[[Daijisen]]'' (Shōgakukan, 1986), ''[[Daijirin]]'' (Sanseidō, 1988), ''[[Nihongo Daijiten]]'' (Kōdansha, 1989), and ''[[Kōjien]]'' (Iwanami, 1991).

For instance, this definition from the popular ''Daijirin'' dictionary gives the ''kanji'' 大和魂, modern and [[Old Japanese]] pronunciations, two meanings, synonyms, and usage examples from [[Japanese literature]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;やまとだましい［―だましひ］4 【《大和》魂】①大和心。和魂。（漢学を学んで得た知識に対して）日本人固有の実務・世事などを処理する能力・知恵をいう。「才(ざえ)を本としてこそ、―の世に用ゐらるる方も強う侍らめ〔出典： 源氏（乙女）〕」 「露、―無かりける者にて〔出典： 今昔 二十〕」②( 近世以降の国粋思想の中で用いられた語)日本民族固有の精神。日本人としての意識。&lt;br&gt;
'''yamato''' ... '''-damashii''', ''-damashiFi'' "type 4" [accent on ''da''] 【《大和》魂】1. ''yamato-gokoro''. ''wakon''. (in contrast to knowledge obtained from studying Chinese classics) Japanese people's characteristic ability or wisdom/intelligence for managing/treating actual things and worldly affairs. ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' (The Maiden [chapter]) "Without a solid foundation of book-learning this 'Japanese spirit' of which one hears so much is not of any great use in the world." [Tales of] Times Now Past (20) "He did not have the slightest knowledge of the Japanese spirit." 2. (term used in ultra-nationalistic ideology of recent times) characteristic mentality of the Japanese race/people. Consciousness/awareness of being a Japanese person. (tr. Carr 1994:288)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Collectively, these four definitions provide insights into what ''Yamato-damashii'' means in current Japanese usage. They all distinguish two basic meanings: ① "A Japanese practical ability; opposed to Chinese scholarship" and ② "A traditional (bushido/nationalistic) concept of death-defying valor".  When two or more definitions use identical terminology, it suggests consensus on semantics. For instance, while the dictionaries split on whether meaning ① refers to ''Nihon-minzoku'' (日本民族 "Japanese race/people/nation") or ''Nihon-jin'' (日本人 "Japanese person/people"), all four say the nationalistic meaning ② refers to ''Nihon-minzoku''.

For meaning ①, the most salient word (used 7 times) is ''koyū'' (固有 "inherent; innate; characteristic; special quality"). This sense is defined as a ''noryoku'' (能力 "ability, capability; competency") or ''chie'' (知恵 "wisdom; insight; intelligence"), which pertains to ''jisseikatsujōno'' (実生活上 "real life; everyday/practical reality') or ''jitsumutekina'' (実務的な "actual things, practical experience").

For meaning ②, all the definitions describe a ''seishin'' (精神 "mind; mentality; spirit; soul; genius"). Specifically a "Japanese spirit" with ''kakan'' (果敢 "boldness; courage; daring; determination"), ''yūmō'' (勇猛 "bravery; valor; intrepidness; daring"), and ''shinmei o mo oshimanai'' (身命をも惜しまない "without regard for one's life"), especially when ''koto ni atatte'' (事に当たって "facing a vital matter; in case of crisis"). Purity is mentioned with ''seijo'' (清浄 "purity; cleanliness") and ''isagiyoi'' (潔い "pure; clean; honorable; gallant; brave").

Within this dictionary sample, only the ''Nihongo daijiten'' qualifies ''Yamato-damashii'' as a characteristic that is ''to sareta'' (とされた "assumed, supposed; alleged'"), whereas the other three define it as a matter of fact. Carr concludes (1994:290), "Believing that all individuals of any race or nationality share certain "spiritual" characteristics is at best overgeneralization, or at worst racism."

Some monolingual English dictionaries enter ''Yamato'' or ''Yamato-e'', but only the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] enters ''Yamato-damashii''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Yamato''' (ja'mato) [Jap., = 'Japan']&lt;br&gt;
'''1'''. The style or school of art in Japan which culminated in the 12th and 13th centuries and dealt with Japanese subjects in a distinctively Japanese (rather than Chinese) way. Usu. as '''Yamato-e''' ('''†-we''') [''e'' picture]; also –'''ryū''' [-''ryū'' style, orig. stream, school]. … &lt;br&gt;
'''2'''. '''Yamato-damashii''': the Japanese spirit. … (v. 3, 2002) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''OED'' gives three usage examples, starting with ''Yamato-damashi'' (1942, ''Royal Air Force Journal'', "He will be filled with what is called ''yamato damashi'' [sic] or the pure spirit of Japan.") and ''Yamato-damashii'' (1957, ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''). Note that the 1904 Hearn quotation above antedates this 1942 citation.

Most Japanese-English dictionaries literally translate ''Yamato-damashii'' as "the Japanese spirit". For instance, [[Kenkyūsha's New Japanese-English Dictionary]] (5th ed., 2003) enters ''Yamato'' "'''やまと'''【大和】 Yamato; (old) Japan" along with 14 subentries, including ''Yamato-damashii'' "'''大和魂''' the Japanese spirit" and ''Yamato-gokoro'' "'''大和心''' the Japanese spirit; the Japanese sensibility."

The online ''Encyclopedia of Shinto'' (linked below, note the pronunciation file) comprehensively defines '''Yamato-damashii'''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Literally, "Japanese spirit"; ''Yamato damashii'' is also written 大和魂. This term is often contrasted with "Chinese Learning" (''karasae''), that is, knowledge and scholarship imported into Japan from China. ''Yamato damashii'' refers to an inherent faculty of common-sense wisdom, resourcefulness, and prudent judgment that is characteristic of, and unique to, the Japanese people. It also refers to a practical, "real life" ability and intelligence that is in contrast with scholarship and knowledge acquired through formal education. It is a term used to express such ideas as the essential purity and resolute spirit of the Japanese people, the wish for the peace and security of the nation, and the possession of a strong spirit and emotion that will meet any challenge, even at the expense of one's own life. ''Yamato damashii'' is synonymous with ''Yamato gokoro'' (lit. "Japanese heart"). &lt;/blockquote&gt;
