The '''1693 Sicily earthquake''' struck parts of southern [[Italy]] near [[Sicily]], [[Calabria]], and [[Malta]] on [[January 11]] at around 21:00 local time.&lt;ref name="bonajutus"/&gt; This earthquake was preceded by a damaging [[foreshock]] on January 9.&lt;ref name=Gutscher&gt;Gutscher, M.-A., J.

According to a contemporary account of the earthquake by Vincentius Bonajutus, published in the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'', "It was in this country impossible to keep upon our legs, or in one place on the dancing Earth; nay, those that lay along on the ground, were tossed from side to side, as if on a rolling billow."&lt;ref name="bonajutus"&gt;Bonajutus, V. and M. Malpighius.

January 1, 1694 18:2–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tectonic setting==
Sicily lies on part of the complex [[convergent boundary]] where the [[African Plate]] is [[subduction|subducting]] beneath the [[Eurasian Plate]]. This subduction zone is responsible for the formation of the [[stratovolcano]] [[Mount Etna]] and considerable seismic activity. Most damaging earthquakes however, occur on the Siculo-Calabrian rift zone. This zone of extensional faulting runs for about {{convert|370|km|mi}}, forming three main segments through Calabria, along the east coast of Sicily and immediately offshore, and finally forming the southeastern margin of the [[Hyblaean Mountains|Hyblaean Plateau]]. Faults in the Calabrian segment were responsible for the [[1783 Calabrian earthquakes]] sequence.&lt;ref name="Catalano"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Catalano|first=S.|author2=De Guidi G.|author3=Monaco C.|author4=Tortorici G.|author5=Tortorici L.|last-author-amp=yes|year=2008|title=Active faulting and seismicity along the Siculo–Calabrian Rift Zone (Southern Italy)|journal=Tectonophysics|publisher=Elsevier|volume=453|issue=1–4|pages=177–192|doi=10.1016/j.tecto.2007.05.008|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040195108000553|accessdate=19 November 2011|bibcode = 2008Tectp.453..177C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the southern part of the eastern coast of Sicily, investigations have identified a series of active [[Fault (geology)#Dip-slip faults|normal faults]], dipping to the east. Most of these lie offshore and some control basins that contain large thicknesses of [[Quaternary]] sediments. The two largest faults, known as the western and eastern master faults, border [[half-graben]]s with fills of up to {{convert|700|m|ft}} and {{convert|800|m|ft}} respectively. Onshore, two ages of faulting have been recognised, an earlier phase trending NW-SE and a later phase trending SSW-NNE that clearly offsets the first group, including the Avola fault and the Rosolini-Ispica fault system.&lt;ref name=Bianca&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bianca|first=M.|author2=Monaco C.|author3=Tortorici L.|author4=Cernobori L.|last-author-amp=yes|year=1999|title=Quaternary normal faulting in southeastern Sicily (Italy): a seismic source for the 1693 large earthquake|journal=[[Geophysical Journal International]]|publisher=[[Royal Astronomical Society]]|location=London|volume=139|issue=2|pages=370–394|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?db_key=AST&amp;bibcode=1999GeoJI.139..370B&amp;letter=0&amp;classic=YES&amp;defaultprint=YES&amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;page=370&amp;epage=370&amp;send=Send+PDF&amp;filetype=.pdf|accessdate=19 November 2011|bibcode = 1999GeoJI.139..370B |doi = 10.1046/j.1365-246X.1999.00942.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earthquake characteristics==
[[File:Siculo-Calabrian Rift.png|thumb|Main faults of the Siculo-Calabrian rift zone]]

===January 9 foreshock===
A destructive earthquake occurred two days before the mainshock at 21:00 local time, centered in the Val di Noto. It had an estimated magnitude of 6.2 and a maximum perceived intensity of VIII–XI on the [[Mercalli intensity scale]]. Intensities of VIII or higher have been estimated for [[Augusta, Sicily|Augusta]], [[Avola|Avola Vecchia]], [[Floridia]], [[Melilli]], [[Noto|Noto Antica]], [[Catania]], [[Francofonte]], [[Lentini]], [[Scicli]], [[Sortino]] and [[Vizzini]].&lt;ref name =CFTI4MED&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://storing.ingv.it/cfti4med/quakes/01148.html|title= Catalogue of Strong Earthquakes in Italy (461 BC – 1997) and Mediterranean Area (760 B.C. – 1500)|last=Guidoboni|first=E.|author2=Ferrari G.|author3=Mariotti D.|author4=Comastri A.|author5=Tarabusi G.|author6=Valensise G.|last-author-amp=yes|publisher=INGV-SGA|accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;!--Note firstly that the link takes you to an index map, which can be interrogated for information about individual earthquakes and secondly that this source is occasionally unavailable for weeks at a time, but always comes back eventually--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Augusta lies well outside the main zone of severe shaking; its extensive damage is probably due to its construction on unconsolidated sediments.&lt;ref name=Bianca/&gt;

From the shape and location of the area of maximum damage, this earthquake is thought to have been caused by movement on the Avola fault.&lt;ref name=Bianca/&gt;

===January 11 mainshock===
The earthquake lasted for four minutes, according to contemporary accounts.&lt;ref name="bonajutus"/&gt; The estimated magnitude of 7.4 is taken from the extent and degree of the recorded damage, with a very large area that reached X (''Extreme'') or more on the Mercalli scale. The maximum shaking reached XI in the towns of [[Buscemi]], [[Floridia]], [[Melilli]], [[Grammichele|Occhiola]] and [[Sortino]].&lt;ref name =CFTI4MED/&gt;

The source of the January 11 earthquake is debated. Some catalogues give an onshore epicentre without any direct association with a known structure, while others propose that the source was offshore due to the associated tsunami, involving either rupture along a normal fault, part of the Siculo-Calabrian rift zone,&lt;ref name=Bianca/&gt; or rupture along the subduction zone beneath the Ionian Sea.&lt;ref name=Gutscher/&gt; An analysis of the distribution of tsunami run-ups along the coast suggests that a submarine landslide triggered by the earthquake is the most likely source, in which case the tsunami provides no constraint on the epicenter.&lt;ref name="Billi"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Billi|first=A.|author2=Minelli L.|author3=Orecchio B.|author4=Presti D.|last-author-amp=yes|year=2010|title=Constraints to the Cause of Three Historical Tsunamis (1908, 1783, and 1693) in the Messina Straits Region, Sicily, Southern Italy|journal=Seismological Research Letters|publisher=Seismological Society of America|volume=81|issue=6|pages=907–915|doi=10.1785/gssrl.81.6.907|url=http://171.66.125.217/content/81/6/907.full.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225233247/http://171.66.125.217/content/81/6/907.full.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 February 2012|accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A landslide origin is supported by the observation of possible landslide bodies along the Hyblean-Malta escarpment.&lt;ref name="Armigliato"&gt;{{cite journal|title=New contributions to the debate on the cause of the January 11th, 1693 tsunami in eastern Sicily (Italy): earthquake or offshore landslide source (or may be both)?|volume=53|last=Armigliato|first=A.|author2=Tinti S.|author3=Zaniboni F.|author4=Pagnoni G.|author5=Argnani A.|last-author-amp=yes|year=2007|work=American Geophysical Union, Fall Meeting 2007, abstract #S53A-1019|accessdate=|bibcode=2007AGUFM.S53A1019A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historic documents in the [[Archivo General de Simancas]] mention dozens of aftershocks, some as late as August 1694, and some reportedly as strong as the initial quake of January 11, 1693.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Fernando|last1=Rodríguez de la Torre|year=1995|title=Spanish sources concerning the 1693 earthquake in Sicily|journal=Annali di Geofisica|pages=531|volume=38|issue=5–6|url=http://www.earth-prints.org/bitstream/2122/1744/1/06%20torre.pdf}}, '''Table I.''' List of aftershocks 1693–1694 from the AGS documents.&lt;/ref&gt; Aftershocks continued until at least 1696, with their effects concentrated in towns along the coast, supporting an epicenter either near the coast or offshore.&lt;ref name=Bianca/&gt;

==Tsunami==
The tsunami triggered by the earthquake affected most of the Ionian Sea coast of Sicily, about {{convert|230|km|mi}} in all. The first thing that was noted at all localities affected was a withdrawal of the sea. The strongest effects were concentrated around Augusta, where the initial withdrawal left the harbour dry, followed by a wave of at least {{convert|2.4|m|ft}} height, possibly as much as {{convert|8|m|ft}}, that inundated part of the town. The maximum inundation of about {{convert|1.5|km|mi}} was recorded at [[Mascali]].&lt;ref name="Gerardi"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gerardi|first=P.|author2=Barbano M.S.|author3=De Martini P.M.|author4=Pantosti D.|last-author-amp=yes|year=2008|title=Discrimination of Tsunami Sources (Earthquake versus Landslide) on the Basis of Historical Data in Eastern Sicily and Southern Calabria|journal=Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America|volume=98|issue=6|pages=2795–2805|doi=10.1785/0120070192|url=http://www.earth-prints.org/bitstream/2122/4119/2/Gerardi%20manuscript%202007192.pdf|accessdate=20 November 2011|bibcode = 2008BuSSA..98.2795G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tsunami deposit]]s linked to the 1693 tsunami have been found both onshore and offshore. At Ognina, just south of Syracuse, at the head of a [[ria]], a sequence containing several coarse clastic layers has been found, inconsistent with its lagoonal setting. The uppermost coarse layer, which has a strongly erosive base, consists of coarse sand with up to granule size clasts. The layer has been dated as 17th to 18th century based on pottery shards and one well-preserved clay pipe, consistent with the 1693 tsunami.&lt;ref name="Scicchitano"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scicchitano|first=G.|author2=Costa B.|author3=Di Stefano A.|author4=Longhitano S.|author5=Monaco C.|last-author-amp=yes|year=2008|title=Tsunami deposits in the Siracusa coastal area (south-eastern Sicily)|journal=Rend. online SGI Note Brevi|publisher=Società Geologica Italiana|volume=1|pages=159–162|url=http://www.socgeol.info/Ricerca/documents/rendiconti_online_1_2008_140_221.pdf#page=20|accessdate=21 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225233258/http://www.socgeol.info/Ricerca/documents/rendiconti_online_1_2008_140_221.pdf#page=20|archive-date=2012-02-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Offshore from Augusta, a sequence identified using [[chirp]] [[sonar]] data was sampled with a {{convert|6.7|m|ft}} [[Core sample|gravity core]] in {{convert|72|m|ft}} of water. Following detailed analysis of both grain size and [[foraminifera]] assemblages, eleven possible high-energy events were found based on the presence of large numbers of shallow water forams combined with a greater proportion of fine sand in the same interval. The uppermost two events correlate well with the tsunamis from the [[1908 Messina earthquake]] and the 1693 earthquake.&lt;ref name="Smedile"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smedile|first=A.|author2=De Martini P.M.|author3=Pantosti D.|author4=Bellucci L.|author5=Del Carlo P.|author6=Gasperini L.|author7=Pirrotta C.|author8=Polonia A.|author9=Boschi E.|last-author-amp=yes|year=2011|title=Possible tsunami signatures from an integrated study in the Augusta Bay offshore (Eastern Sicily—Italy)|journal=Marine Geology|publisher=Elsevier|volume=281|issue=1–4|pages=1–13|doi=10.1016/j.margeo.2011.01.002|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025322711000041|accessdate=21 November 2011|bibcode=2011MGeol.281....1S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Link to eruption of Etna==
Although there are reports of an eruption at the time of the earthquake, most sources suggest that the volcano had been inactive since the destructive [[Mount Etna#Historical eruptions|eruption of 1669]]. Analysis of the relationship between eruptions and earthquakes has found that earthquakes are followed by long periods without activity in the 'rift zones' that extend out to north and south from the summit. Estimates of [[Coulomb stress transfer]] due to the [[Dike (geology)|dyke]] intrusion in the rift zones associated with the 1669 eruption, suggest that this could have helped to trigger the 1693 earthquake, by increasing stress levels on the faults.&lt;ref name="Feuillet"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feuillet|first=N.|author2=Cocco M.|author3=Musumeci C.|author4=Nostro C.|last-author-amp=yes|year=2006|title=Stress interaction between seismic and volcanic activity at Mt Etna|journal=Geophysical Journal International|publisher=[[Royal Astronomical Society]]|location=London|volume=164|issue=3|pages=697–718|doi=10.1111/j.1365-246X.2005.02824.x|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?db_key=AST&amp;bibcode=2006GeoJI.164..697F&amp;letter=0&amp;classic=YES&amp;defaultprint=YES&amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;page=697&amp;epage=697&amp;send=Send+PDF&amp;filetype=.pdf|accessdate=20 November 2011|bibcode = 2006GeoJI.164..697F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Damage==

[[File:Castello di Noto.JPG|thumb|Ruins of the Norman castle in Noto Antica]]

===January 9 foreshock===
Despite the difficulty of separating the effects of this event from the mainshock, some information is available. This earthquake caused widespread damage, particularly in Augusta where almost half of the houses were destroyed. Most of the buildings in two districts of Avola collapsed and many buildings were also destroyed in Noto, Floridia, Lentini and Mellili. Some buildings collapsed in Catania, Vizzini and Sortini. There were an estimated 200 deaths in both Augusta and Noto.&lt;ref name =CFTI4MED/&gt;

===January 11 mainshock===
The area of severe damage covered most of southeastern Sicily, an area of about {{convert|14000|km2|sqmi}}, including all the present provinces of [[Province of Catania|Catania]], [[Province of Ragusa|Ragusa]] and [[Province of Syracuse|Syracuse]]. At least 70 cities, towns and villages were devastated, with some examples of at least partial building collapse as far afield as [[Messina]], [[Agrigento]], [[Palermo]], [[Reggio Calabria]] and [[Malta]].&lt;ref name =CFTI4MED/&gt;

The earthquake also triggered large landslides, such as at Noto Antica and Sortino, and in one case a large rock-slide dammed a stream, forming a lake a few kilometres long. Several large NW-SE trending fractures were created up to {{convert|500|m|ft}} long and {{convert|2|m|ft}} wide, on the plains just south of Catania.  In the same area, [[sand volcano]]es were formed by jets of water spurting as much as several metres into the air, with similar phenomena being reported from the Lentini plain and along some river valleys.&lt;ref name=Bianca/&gt;

At Augusta the tsunami damaged galleys of the [[Knights of Malta]] that were anchored in the harbour when they were grounded during the initial withdrawal of the sea.&lt;ref name =CFTI4MED/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bianca/&gt;

The number of deaths recorded at the time in official sources were about 12,000 in Catania (63% of the population), 5,045 in Ragusa (51%), 3,500 in Syracuse (23%) 3,000 in Noto (25%), 1,840 in Augusta (30%) and 3,400 in [[Modica]] (19%).&lt;ref name =CFTI4MED/&gt; The total death toll in the same source was recorded as 54,000 with other sources referring to totals of about 60,000.&lt;ref name=deaths1693/&gt; In 1853, [[Robert Mallet|Mallet]] recorded 93,000 deaths, in his catalogue of earthquakes.&lt;ref name="NGDC"/&gt;

===Response===
Sicily was at the time ruled as part of the [[Crown of Aragon]] by the [[List of Spanish monarchs|Kings of Spain]]. The [[List of viceroys of Sicily|Viceroy]] in Madrid, the [[Juan Francisco Pacheco y Téllez-Girón, 4th Consort Duke of Uceda|Duke of Uzeda]], reacted by appointing [[Giuseppe Lanza]], the Duke of Camastra, and the Prince of Aragon as [[Vicar general|Vicars General]] for the Val Demone and Val di Noto regions of Sicily respectively. Due to illness, both the Prince of Aragon and his replacement the bishop of Syracuse were unable to take up the position of Vicar General for Val di Noto and the Duke of Camastra was forced to take on the responsibility for both areas. Camastra already had considerable experience as an administrator, having served in a number of senior military and judicial positions. The Viceroy also appointed three generals as commissioners in order to organise the immediate relief efforts in the worst affected cities. One of the Duke of Camastra's first acts was to temporarily exempt the worst affected areas from taxes.&lt;ref name =CFTI4MED/&gt; Amongst other administrators sent to the damaged area was Colonel Don [[Carlos de Grunenbergh]], Royal Engineer to the King of Spain, who had experience in planning and building fortifications.&lt;ref name="Tobriner"/&gt;

In Palermo, the Viceroy formed two councils, a civil one made up of nobles, and another that was ecclesiastical, made up of senior church officials. They were directed to meet twice weekly,&lt;ref name="Tobriner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tobriner|first=S.|title=The Genesis of Noto: An Eighteenth-century Sicilian City|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gR7IxxQiX5UC&amp;pg=PA13|series=Studies in Architecture|volume=21|year=1982|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-03526-3|pages=27–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were charged with the drawing up of plans for the reconstruction of the worst affected towns and cities.&lt;ref name =CFTI4MED/&gt;

===Reconstruction===

The initial reconstruction efforts concentrated on restoring the military defences of Syracuse, Augusta, Catania and Acireale, due to their strategic importance.&lt;ref name =CFTI4MED/&gt; The reconstruction plans were of three types: move the town to a new site, rebuild at the same site with a completely new town plan or rebuild using the existing town plan. Examples of towns that fell in the first category were Avola and Noto, their former locations now being known as Avola Antica&lt;ref name="Siracusa-sicilia_Avola"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siracusa-sicilia.it/english/avola.htm|title=Avola|last=Siracusa-sicilia|accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Noto Antica.&lt;ref name="Siracusa-sicilia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siracusa-sicilia.it/english/noto_antica.htm|title=Noto Antica|last=Siracusa-sicilia|accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Catania is an example of a city that was rebuilt on the same site to a new plan, while adapting some of the existing structures. Syracuse is an example of a city rebuilt entirely to its existing plan.&lt;ref name =CFTI4MED/&gt; Ragusa was partly rebuilt on its old site to the medieval plan (''Ragusa Ibla'') and partly on a new, but neighbouring site, to a 'modern' plan (''Ragusa Superiore'').&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt;

The degree and extent of the damage caused by the earthquake prompted an architectural revival in the towns of [[Sicily]] and [[Malta]], a style that has become known as [[Sicilian Baroque]].&lt;ref name="Valdes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Valdes|first=G.|title=Art and History: Sicily|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CpUEb1atzNQC&amp;pg=PA9|accessdate=22 November 2011|year=2003|publisher=Casa Editrice Bonechi|isbn=978-88-476-0756-9|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time many of the palazzi, public buildings, cathedrals and churches were reconstructed in this style. Towns that suffered serious damage from the earthquake in which many of their structures were rebuilt, include [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], [[Ragusa, Italy|Ragusa]], [[Catania]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Condorelli|first=Stefano|title=The Reconstruction of Catania after the Earthquake of 1693|url=https://www.academia.edu/2640421/The_Reconstruction_of_Catania_after_the_Earthquake_of_1693|work=Proceedings of the Second International Congress on Construction History (Queens’ College Cambridge 2006), Exeter, Short Run Press, 2006, I, pp. 799–815}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caltagirone]], [[Palazzolo Acreide]], [[Modica]], [[Comiso]], [[Scicli]] and [[Mdina]] on [[Malta]]. Many of these towns now form part of the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] ''Late Baroque Towns of the Val di Noto (South-Eastern Sicily)'', inscribed in 1992, referring to the "exceptional quality" of the region's art and architecture.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt;

The '''A354''' is a [[primary route]] in [[England]] which runs from [[Salisbury]] in [[Wiltshire]] to [[Villages of Portland|Easton]] on the [[Isle of Portland]] in [[Dorset]], a total distance of {{convert|51|mi}}. From Salisbury the road crosses [[Cranborne Chase]] and briefly merges with the [[A350 road|A350]] at the [[Blandford Forum]] bypass before crossing the [[Dorset Downs]] and merging with the [[A35 road|A35]] at the [[Puddletown]] bypass. {{convert|7|mi}} to the west it splits from the [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]] bypass and runs south. The road now bypasses [[Upwey, Dorset|Upwey]] and [[Broadwey]] on a new section of road which has some 2 lane sections going north and 1 lane continuously going south towards [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]]. After the old and new sections meet at Manor Roundabout the road follows down Weymouth Way alongside [[Radipole Lake]]. The final stretch runs across a short bridge over [[Chesil Beach#The Fleet Lagoon|Chesil beach]] onto Portland.

==Weymouth Relief Road==
The project was to build a {{convert|3.75|mi|km|adj=on}} single carriageway road, with crawler lane along part, linking the A354 Manor Roundabout near Radipole to the A354 at the top of the Ridgeway Hill.
The main carriageway of the Weymouth Relief Road opened on Thursday 17 March 2011.

The 2012 Olympics at Portland played a major factor in making £89m funding for the road available.

==The History of Improving the A354 Dorchester Road==
1983 - The Dorset Structure Plan proposed to construct the A354 Weymouth, Ridgeway to Mount Pleasant improvement as a primary route.

December 1987 to April 1988 - a public inquiry was held into proposals for development in the Lorton area which included a new single-carriageway route running from Mount Pleasant to Littlemoor. These proposals were refused consent by the Secretary of State.

Between 1989 and 1992 - various studies and consultation exercises undertaken into alternative route options and alignments for a dual carriageway road between the Ridgeway and north Weymouth.

1992 - work on a planning application and Environmental Statement for this scheme began.

July 1994 - a dual carriageway road along the alignment was granted planning permission.

1996 - A public inquiry into the Compulsory Purchase and Side Road Orders was held. The Secretary of State approved these orders. However, work on the scheme was never started as, following a Government review of road construction, the funding for the scheme was not forthcoming. The planning permission lapsed after 5 years.

Following the lapse of permission Dorset County Council undertook a review of the previously consented scheme. The previous dual carriageway route was rejected in light of changing policy guidance, developments within the area of the proposed route and new information about the ecological value of areas along the route.

A new preferred route for a single carriageway road was identified, running from Manor Roundabout alongside the eastern side of the Weymouth/Dorchester railway to Littlemoor, through Littlemoor and then parallel with the alignment of the railway to the Ridgeway (often referred to as the Orange Route).

December 2003 - the Government Office of the South West confirmed that this scheme was 'Provisionally Accepted', subject to completion of all relevant statutory processes and final approval of Ministers.

September 2005 - a planning application and Environmental Statement for a road along the preferred route was submitted by Dorset County Council. However, the application was not determined as, following its submission and at the request of the planning authority, the council carried out further studies, including an examination of the potential for further reducing the effects on the environment, especially those parts which are nationally designated.

As a result of the council's re-assessment, changes were made to the September 2005 proposals, primarily to the stretch of road through the AONB.

March 2011 - Relief Road was opened

'''Albert Paddock Crary''' (July 25, 1911 – October 29, 1987), was a pioneer polar [[geophysics|geophysicist]] and [[glaciology|glaciologist]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He was the first person to have stepped foot on both the North and South Poles, having made it to the [[North Pole]] on May 3, 1952 (with [[Joseph O. Fletcher]] and [[William P. Benedict]]) and then to the [[South Pole]] on February 12, 1961, as the leader of a team of eight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FPOL%2FPOL24_149%2FS0032247400009049a.pdf&amp;code=b61bfadf972f924db1a15cd526574854 | author = de Q. Robin, Gordon |title=Obituary | date= November 1987 | publisher= Cambridge Journals }}&lt;/ref&gt; The South Pole expedition set out from [[McMurdo Station]] on December 10, 1960, using three [[Snowcat]]s with trailers. Crary was the seventh expedition leader to arrive at the South Pole by surface transportation (the six others before him were&amp;mdash;in sequence&amp;mdash;[[Roald Amundsen|Amundsen]], [[Robert Falcon Scott|Scott]], [[Edmund Hillary|Hillary]], [[Vivian Fuchs|Fuchs]], a Russian expedition in 1959/60 from [[Vostok, Antarctica|Vostok base]], and Antero Havola).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polartrec.com/expeditions/human-impacts-in-antarctica-2011/journals/2011-11-28 | author = Brown, Michelle |title=Welcome to Crary | date= 28 November 2011 | publisher= PolarTREC Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was widely admired for his intellect, wit, skills and as a great administrator for polar research expeditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic41-1-89.pdf | author = Staff |title=Albert Paddock Crary | date= January 1989 | publisher= Arctic Institute of North America – University of Calgary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Crary was born in 1911 into a farming family in northern New York State. He was the second oldest in a family of 7 children. He was a physics major and geology student at [[St. Lawrence University]]  in [[Canton, New York]]. He graduated in 1931 [[Phi Beta Kappa]] from [[St. Lawrence University]] and then enrolled at [[Lehigh University]] to obtain a master's degree in physics.  After spending years completing and facilitating research at both poles, Crary eventually settled in [[Bethesda, Maryland]],  with his wife and son.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

His awards included the [[Cullum Geographical Medal]] (1959), the [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Patron's Gold Medal]] (1963), and the [[Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography|Vega Medal]] (1972).&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

He died on October 29, 1987, at the [[George Washington University Hospital]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/31/obituaries/albert-crary-geophysicist-dies-an-explorer-of-both-polar-regions.html | author = [[Edward Hudson (reporter)|Hudson, Edward]] |title=Albert Crary, Geophysicist, Dies. An Explorer of Both Polar Regions | date= 31 October 1987 | publisher= [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1991, the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF), which manages the [[U.S. Antarctic Program]] (USAP), honoured his memory by dedicating a state-of-the-art laboratory complex in his name, the [[Albert P. Crary Science and Engineering Center]] (CSEC) located in [[McMurdo Station]]. He was also honored by having the [[Crary Mountains]] (76 degrees 48' S, 117 degrees 40' W) and the [[Crary Ice Rise]] in Antarctica named for him as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.igsoc.org:8080/journal/34/116/igs_journal_vol34_issue116_pg139-140.pdf |author=Bentley, Charles |title=Albert P.

Although the burgage plot was used for small scale activities such as livestock or orchards, the back lane frequently divided the village from the main agricultural area - such as the [[open field system|open fields]].

The name frequently survives as a street name in a much enlarged urban settlement (there is an example in [[Wheldrake]]), although it is not uncommon for the back lane to be reduced to a narrow pathway.

A back lane, laneway, or [[alley]] is also a service, or access road behind houses, or in a commercial district, which was created for deliveries and parking, amongst other things.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.surrey.ca/city-services/758.aspx|title = Back Lanes|website = City of Surrey|language = en-US|access-date = 2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[human geography]], a '''catchment area''' is the area from which a city, service or institution attracts a population that uses its services. For example, a school catchment area is the [[geographic]] area from which students are eligible to attend a local [[school]].

Governments and [[community service]] organizations often define catchment areas for planning purposes and [[public safety]] such as ensuring universal access to services like fire departments, police departments, ambulance bases and hospitals.

==Creation==
Catchment areas are generally established and modified by local governments. These boundaries can be modeled using [[geographic information system]]s (GIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McLafferty |first1=Sara L. |title=GIS and Health Care |journal=Annual Review of Public Health |volume=24 |issue= |pages=25–42 |year=2003 |pmid=12668754 |doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.24.012902.141012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There can be large variability in the services provided within different catchments in the same area depending upon how and when those catchments were established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jenkins |first1=C. |last2=Campbell |first2=J. |title=Catchment areas in general practice and their relation to size and quality of practice and deprivation: a descriptive study in one London borough |journal=BMJ |volume=313 |issue=7066 |pages=1189–92 |year=1996 |pmid=8916754 |pmc=2352502 |doi=10.1136/bmj.313.7066.1189 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are usually contiguous but can overlap when they describe competing services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schuurman |first1=Nadine |last2=Fiedler |first2=Robert S |last3=Grzybowski |first3=Stefan CW |last4=Grund |first4=Darrin |title=Defining rational hospital catchments for non-urban areas based on travel-time |journal=International Journal of Health Geographics |volume=5 |issue= |pages=43 |year=2006 |pmid=17018146 |pmc=1617091 |doi=10.1186/1476-072X-5-43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defining===
Catchments can be defined based upon a number of factors including distance to the facility, actual travel time to the facility, geographic boundaries or population within the catchment.  In a distance based catchment, the area serviced will often depend on the number of visits expected to that institution by each individual.  For example, it may be more acceptable to have a larger catchment for a hospital where any one individual will have few annual visits in comparison to a school where visits will be daily and hence desired distance would be closer.  
When a facility’s capacity can only service a certain volume, the catchment may be used to limit a population’s ability to access services outside that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parsons |first1=Eddie |last2=Chalkley |first2=Brian |last3=Jones |first3=Allan |title=School Catchments and Pupil Movements: A case study in parental choice |journal=Educational Studies |volume=26 |issue=1 |year=2000 |pages=33–48 |doi=10.1080/03055690097727 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, children may be unable to enroll in a school outside their catchment to prevent the school's services being exceeded.

==Examples==
*[[Airport]]s can be built and maintained in locations which minimize the driving distance for the surrounding population to reach them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Airports: Non-Financial Analysis |publisher=[[Transport Canada]] |url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/programs/airports/RSAS/nonfinanalysis.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*A neighborhood or district of a city often has several small convenience shops, each with a catchment area of several streets.  Supermarkets, on the other hand, have a much lower density, with catchment areas of several neighborhoods (or several villages in rural areas).  This principle, similar to the [[central place theory]], makes catchment areas an important area of study for [[geographers]], [[economists]], and [[urban planners]].
*In Nigeria, most Federal Schools respect the fact that some states are educationally less developed than others. The country's higher education &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Admission: University Admission |publisher=Students Nigeria |url=https://www.students.com.ng/category/admission }}&lt;/ref&gt; catchment areas have therefore been designed to ensure a good mixture of students from different backgrounds.

This article gives a detailed listing of all the countries, including [[puppet state]]s, that have existed in [[Europe]] since the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 to the present day. Each country has information separated into columns: name of the distinct country, its lifespan, the country or countries that hold all or some of the territory it once did, and further information about it.&lt;ref&gt;This information is based on the main articles on these former countries.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.progenealogists.com/germany/articles/ganatomy.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091101081203/http://www.progenealogists.com/germany/articles/ganatomy.htm |archivedate=2009-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Article scope ==
{{Further|Congress of Vienna|Concert of Europe}}

The scope of this article begins in 1815, after a round of negotiations about European borders and spheres of influence were agreed upon at the [[Congress of Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bloy|first=Marjie|title=The Congress of Vienna, 1 November 1814 – 8 June 1815|publisher=The Victorian Web|date=30 April 2002|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/forpol/vienna.html|accessdate=2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Congress of Vienna was a nine-month, pan-European meeting of statesmen who met to settle the many issues arising from the destabilising impact of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bloy|first=Marjie|title=The Congress of Vienna, 1 November 1814 – 8 June 1815|publisher=The Victorian Web|date=30 April 2002|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/forpol/vienna.html|accessdate=2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate background was [[First French Empire|Napoleonic France's]] defeat and [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|surrender in May 1814]], which brought an end to twenty-five years of nearly continuous war during which France had caused the [[annexation]] or geopolitical reorganisation of myriad European microstates as well as some larger ones. The Congress of Vienna was the first of a series of international meetings that came to be known as the [[Concert of Europe]], which was an attempt to forge a peaceful [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bloy|first=Marjie|title=The Congress of Vienna, 1 November 1814 – 8 June 1815|publisher=The Victorian Web|date=30 April 2002|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/forpol/vienna.html|accessdate=2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; including restoring or reorganising many of the states which had previously been removed from Europe's political map.

==Sovereign countries==

This is a list of all the independent countries or [[puppet state]]s that existed between 1815 and the present day that no longer exist. (Lifespan of each is based on that country's sovereignty. This means that those countries may have existed outside of those dates as well but not under full independence.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3648">The '''geology of [[Moldova]]''' encompasses basement rocks from the [[Precambrian]] dating back more than 2.5 billion years, overlain by thick sequences of [[Proterozoic]], [[Paleozoic]], [[Mesozoic]] and [[Cenozoic]] sedimentary rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|year=1997|title=Encyclopedia of European &amp; Asian Regional Geology|publisher=Springer|p=540}}&lt;/ref &gt;
==Stratigraphy &amp; Geologic History==
Very few rocks outcrop at the surface from periods of geologic time before the [[Neogene]] and most are limited to the [[Dniester River]] valley. Only [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]] rocks outcrop and elsewhere in the country, older rocks are primarily known from borehole drilling. Moldova is underlain by the East European Precambrian Platform and in the southwest, basement rock is covered by a deep [[Mesozoic]] basin. Heavily deformed [[Archean]] and [[Proterozoic]] rocks form the basement of the entire country, including [[granite]], granite [[gneiss]] and [[gabbro]]. 
By contrast, the overlying sedimentary rocks that ascend to the ground surface are undeformed and include units from the [[Riphean (stage)|Riphean]] (an Eastern European stratigraphic division dating to the transition from the Proterozoic), [[Paleozoic]], Mesozoic and [[Cenozoic]]. 
[[Potassium-argon dating]] of [[glauconite]] from the lowest units gives an age of 1.01 billion to 590 million years ago, with units 100 to 150 meters thick, overlain by 700 meter thick [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]], [[sandstone]] and [[siltstone]]. A six meter thick sandstone in the west is the only [[Ordovician]] rock unit in the country. 

[[Silurian]] deposits are common in Moldova, mainly clay and carbonates 150 meters thick in north and grading to as much as 900 meters in the southwest. [[Devonian]] [[quartzite]] is found in the southwest and a few other Devonian rocks are known only in a small area of the Predobrugian Depression. Geologists debate whether 200 meter thick limestone and [[dolomite]] found in some boreholes is from the [[Carboniferous]], or if the period is not present in the country. Boreholes have uncovered [[Permian]] [[argillite]], sandstone, limestone and [[anhydrite]]. 

Paleozoic rocks are overlain by [[Triassic]] and [[Jurassic]] conglomerate, sandstone, siltstone and limestone that lack fossils and reach a maximum thickness of 600 meters near the town of [[Kahul, Moldova]]. Although late Jurassic rocks are widespread in the south, unconformably overlying the Precambrian basement and the Hercynian platform, the early Jurassic has not been found anywhere. Red clay, gypsum, anhydrite and sandstone are all typical Jurassic rocks, sometimes reaching thicknesses of up to two kilometers. Except in the southwest, [[Cretaceous]] deposits are also common. Marine calcareous rocks are characteristic of the [[Paleogene]] in southern and central Moldova, while reef limestone and gypsum records the [[Miocene]]. [[Quaternary]] deposits from the last 2.5 million years cover almost the entire country. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=538-539}}

==Natural resource geology==
Moldova has small oil and gas fields in southern rocks from the [[Sarmatian]] time as well as several Cenozoic brown coal deposits which are not economically viable. The sugar industry uses high-purity limestone while construction companies quarry gravel, sand and other raw material for concrete and ceramics. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=540}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3434">A '''geometric network''' is an object commonly used in [[geographic information systems]] to model a series of interconnected features. A geometric network is similar to a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] in [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], and can be described and analyzed using theories and concepts similar to [[graph theory]]. Geometric networks are often used to model road networks and public utility networks (such as electric, gas, and water utilities).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meehan|first=Bill|title=Empowering Electric and Gas Utilities with GIS|year=2007|publisher=ESRI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition of a Geometric Network==

A geometric network is composed of '''edges''' that are connected. Connectivity rules for the network specify which edges are connected and at what points they are connected, commonly referred to as '''junction''' or '''intersection''' points. These edges can have weights or flow direction assigned to them, which dictate certain properties of these edges that affect analysis results&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Childs|first=Colin|title=ArcGIS Network Analyst: Networks and Network Models|url=http://www.esri.com/news/podcasts/transcripts/arcgisnetworkanalyst_networksandnetworkmodels.pdf|publisher=ESRI Inc.|accessdate=22 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403011630/http://www.esri.com/news/podcasts/transcripts/arcgisnetworkanalyst_networksandnetworkmodels.pdf|archivedate=3 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
. In the case of certain types of networks, source points (points where flow originates) and sink points (points where flow terminates) may also exist. In the case of utility networks, a source point may correlate with an electric substation or a water pumping station, and a sink point may correlate with a service connection at a residential household.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meehan|first=Bill|title=Empowering Electric and Gas Utilities with GIS|year=2007|publisher=ESRI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=James Robert|title=Algorithms for Networks and Graphs, Volume 1|year=1992|publisher=Marcel Dekker, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==

Networks define the interconnectedness of features. Through analyzing this connectivity, paths from one point to another on the network can be traced and calculated. Through optimization algorithms and utilizing network weights and flow, these paths can also be optimized to show specialized paths, such as the shortest path between two points on the network, as is commonly done in the calculation of driving directions. Networks can also be used to perform spatial analysis to determine points or edges that are encompassed in a certain area or within a certain distance of a specified point. This has applications in [[hydrology]] and [[urban planning]], among other fields.

==Applications==

* [[Routing]]: for calculating driving directions, paths from one point of interest to another, locating nearby points of interest
* [[Urban Planning]]: for site suitability studies, and traffic and congestion studies.
* [[Electric Utility]] Industry: for modeling an [[electrical grid]] in GIS, tracing from a generation source
* [[Public Utility|Other Public Utilities]]: for modeling water distribution flow and natural gas distribution

The Great Barrier Reef has long been known to and used by the [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal Australian]] and [[Torres Strait Islander]] peoples, and is an important part of local groups' cultures and spirituality. The reef is a very popular destination for tourists, especially in the [[Whitsunday Islands]] and [[Cairns]] regions.

===Climate change===
The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority considers the greatest threat to the Great Barrier Reef to be climate change, causing ocean warming which increases [[coral bleaching]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.150.theage.com.au/view_bestofarticle.asp?straction=update&amp;inttype=1&amp;intid=1850 |title=Global climate change, the Great Barrier Reef and our obligations |publisher=The National Forum |accessdate=26 September 2007 |date=19 November 2004 |author1=Rothwell, Don |author2=Stephens, Tim |location=Melbourne |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012184305/http://150.theage.com.au/view_bestofarticle.asp?straction=update&amp;inttype=1&amp;intid=1850 |archivedate=12 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/info_services/publications/misc_pub/climate_change_vulnerability_assessment/our_changing_climate |title=Our changing climate |accessdate=26 September 2007 |author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029074337/http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/info_services/publications/misc_pub/climate_change_vulnerability_assessment/our_changing_climate |archivedate=29 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mass coral bleaching events due to elevated ocean temperatures occurred in the summers of 1998, 2002 and 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority |title=Coral Bleaching and Mass Bleaching Events |url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/info_services/science/climate_change/coral_bleaching.html |accessdate=30 May 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420004634/http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/info_services/science/climate_change/coral_bleaching.html |archivedate=20 April 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and coral bleaching is expected to become an annual occurrence.&lt;ref name="tele"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,21141105-1702,00.html?from=public_rss |title=Online version |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |date=30 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226143455/http://www.news.com.au/story/0%2C10117%2C21141105-1702%2C00.html?from=public_rss |archivedate=26 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As global warming continues, corals will not be able to keep up with increasing ocean temperatures.

Bleaching events in benthic coral communities (deeper than {{convert|20|m|ft|disp=or}}) in the Great Barrier reef are not as well documented as those at shallower depths, but recent research has shown that benthic communities are just as negatively impacted in the face of rising ocean temperatures. Five Great Barrier Reef species of large benthic corals were found bleached under elevated temperatures, affirming that benthic corals are vulnerable to thermal stress.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schmidt |first=C. |last2=Heinz |first2=P. |last3=Kucera |first3=M. |first4=Sven |last4=Uthicke |year=2011 |title=Temperature-induced stress leads to bleaching in larger benthic foraminifera hosting endosymbiotic diatoms |journal=Limnology and Oceanography |volume=56 |issue=5 |pages=1587–1602 |url=http://wap.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_56/issue_5/1587.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.4319/lo.2011.56.5.1587 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304034652/http://wap.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_56/issue_5/1587.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all |bibcode=2011LimOc..56.1587S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pollution===
Another key threat faced by the Great Barrier Reef is [[Marine pollution|pollution]] and declining [[Water pollution|water quality]]. The rivers of north eastern Australia pollute the Reef during tropical flood events. Over 90% of this pollution comes from farm [[Surface runoff|runoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2003 |url=http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/register/p01258bs.pdf |title=Coastal water quality |work=The State of the Environment Report Queensland 2003 |publisher=Environment Protection Agency Queensland |format=PDF |accessdate=7 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614223713/http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/register/p01258bs.pdf |archivedate=14 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 80% of the land adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef is used for farming including intensive cropping of sugar cane, and major beef cattle grazing. Farming practices damage the reef due to [[overgrazing]], increased run-off of agricultural sediments, nutrients and chemicals including [[fertiliser]]s, [[herbicide]]s and [[pesticide]]s representing a major health risk for the coral and biodiversity of the reefs.&lt;ref name="Human Impact on the Great Barrier Reef"&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Impact on the Great Barrier Reef|url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/gc2sec7labgroup3/pollution|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=12 February 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429151658/http://sitemaker.umich.edu/gc2sec7labgroup3/pollution|archivedate=29 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sediments containing high levels of copper and other heavy metals sourced from the [[Ok Tedi Mine]] in Papua New Guinea are a potential pollution risk for the far northern Great Barrier Reef and [[Torres Strait]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, P.T., 2001.

Some 67% of corals died in the reef's worst-hit northern section, the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies report said.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-38127320|title=Great Barrier Reef suffered worst bleaching on record in 2016, report finds|last=Griffith|first=Hywel|date=2016-11-28|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128131749/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-38127320|archivedate=28 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The runoff problem is exacerbated by the loss of coastal [[wetland]]s which act as a natural filter for toxins and help deposit sediment.&lt;ref name=wetlands&gt;{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority |title=Wetlands |url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/key_issues/water_quality/wetlands |accessdate=13 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002034022/http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/key_issues/water_quality/wetlands |archivedate=2 October 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brodie07"&gt;{{cite web|year=2007|author=Brodie, J.|url=https://research.jcu.edu.au/tropwater/resources/06%2007%20Nutrient%20mgmt%20zones%20in%20the%20GBR%20catchment.pdf|title=Nutrient management zones in the Great Barrier Reef Catchment: A decision system for zone selection|publisher=Australian Centre for Tropical Freshwater Research|format=PDF|accessdate=14 March 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325202543/https://research.jcu.edu.au/tropwater/resources/06%2007%20Nutrient%20mgmt%20zones%20in%20the%20GBR%20catchment.pdf|archivedate=25 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Australian Government Productivity Commission|year=2003|title=Industries, Land Use and Water Quality in the Great Barrier Reef Catchment – Key Points|url=http://www.pc.gov.au/projects/study/gbr/docs/finalreport/keypoints|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080816135937/http://www.pc.gov.au/projects/study/gbr/docs/finalreport/keypoints|archivedate=2008-08-16|accessdate=14 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that the poor water quality is due to increased light and oxygen [[Competition (biology)|competition]] from [[algae]].&lt;ref name=waterquality&gt;{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority |year=2006 |title=Principal water quality influences on Great Barrier Reef ecosystems |url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/key_issues/water_quality/principal_influences.html |accessdate=22 October 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016155955/http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/key_issues/water_quality/principal_influences.html |archivedate=16 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eutrophication====
Farming fertiliser runoff release [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], and [[potassium]] into the oceanic ecosystem, these [[limiting nutrient]]s cause massive algal growth which leads to depletion in oxygen available for other creatures which decreases the biodiversity in the affected areas, altering the species composition. A study by Katharina Fabricius and Glen Death of [[Australian Institute of Marine Science]] found that hard corals numbers were almost double on reefs that were far from agricultural areas.&lt;ref name="Human Impact on the Great Barrier Reef"/&gt;

Fertilizers also increase the amount of phytoplankton available for the crown-of-thorns starfish larvae to consume. A study showed that a doubling of the chlorophyll in the water leads to a tenfold increase in the crown-of-thorns starfish larvae's survival rate.&lt;ref name="Human Impact on the Great Barrier Reef"/&gt;

====Sediment runoff====
Sediment runoff from farming carries chemicals into the reef environment also reduces the amount of light available to the corals decreasing their ability to extract energy from their environment.&lt;ref name="Human Impact on the Great Barrier Reef"/&gt;

====Pesticides====
Pesticides used in farming are made up of heavy metals such as lead, mercury, arsenic and other toxins are released into the wider environment due to erosion of farm soil, which has a detrimental effect on the coral.&lt;ref name="Human Impact on the Great Barrier Reef"/&gt;

====Pollution from mining====
Mining company Queensland Nickel discharged nitrate-laden water into the Great Barrier Reef in 2009 and 2011 – on the later occasion releasing {{convert|516|t}} of waste water. The [[Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority]] (GBRMPA) stated "We have strongly encouraged the company to investigate options that do not entail releasing the material to the environment and to develop a management plan to eliminate this potential hazard; however, GBRMPA does not have legislative control over how the Yabulu tailings dam is managed".&lt;ref name="Clive Palmer's nickel refinery pumped toxic waste into Great Barrier Reef park"&gt;{{cite news|last=Milman|first=Oliver|title=Clive Palmer's nickel refinery pumped toxic waste into Great Barrier Reef park|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/12/cliver-palmers-nickel-refinery-pumped-nitrogen-great-barrier-reef-park|accessdate=12 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 February 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223012657/http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/12/cliver-palmers-nickel-refinery-pumped-nitrogen-great-barrier-reef-park|archivedate=23 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overfishing===
The unsustainable [[overfishing]] of [[keystone species]], such as the [[Triton (mollusk)|Giant Triton]], can disrupt [[food chain]]s vital to reef life. Fishing also impacts the reef through increased water pollution from boats, [[by-catch]] of unwanted species (such as dolphins and turtles) and [[habitat destruction]] from [[trawling]], [[anchors]] and nets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CSIRO Marine Research |year=1998 |title=Environmental Effects of Prawn Trawling |url=http://www.marine.csiro.au/LeafletsFolder/26trawl/26.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20060218004827/http://www.marine.csiro.au/LeafletsFolder/26trawl/26.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 February 2006 |accessdate=28 May 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the middle of 2004, approximately one-third of the [[Great Barrier Reef Marine Park]] is protected from species removal of any kind, including fishing, without written permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority |title=Marine Park Zoning |url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/management/zoning/index.html |accessdate=8 August 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719173858/http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/management/zoning/index.html |archivedate=19 July 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protection and preservation: Reef 2050 plan ==
In March 2015, the Australian and [[Government of Queensland|Queensland’s governments]] formed a plan for the protection and preservation of the reef’s universal heritage until 2050. This 35 years plan, titled "Reef 2050 Plan" is a document proposing possible measures for the long-term management of the pollution, climate change and other issues that threaten the life span and value of this global heritage. The plan contains all the elements for measurement and improvements, including; long-term sustainability plan, water quality improvement plan and the investment plan for the protection and preservation of The Reef until 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/marine/gbr/long-term-sustainability-plan|title=The Reef 2050 Plan|last=|first=|date=July 2018|website=Department of the Environment and Energy|publisher=[[Australian Government]]|language=en|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180304225814/http://www.environment.gov.au/marine/gbr/long-term-sustainability-plan|archivedate=4 March 2018|deadurl=no|access-date=2018-04-18|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, whereas the 2050 plan aims to incorporate protective measures such as improving water quality, reef restoration, killing of predatory starfish, it does not incorporate additional measures to address the root cause the problem namely climate change (which is caused by greenhouse gas emissions). As such, experts doubt on whether it will be enough to save the fragile environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/great-barrier-reef-investment-save-coral-reefs-australia-2018-4?|title=Half of the Great Barrier Reef has died since 2016 — but Australia's $400 million attempt to save it doesn't address the main problem|last=Loria|first=Kevin|date=1 May 2018|work=Business Insider|accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/25/great-barrier-reef-2050-plan-no-longer-achievable-due-to-climate-change-experts-say|title=Great Barrier Reef 2050 plan no longer achievable due to climate change, experts say|last=Slezak|first=Michael|date=25 May 2017|work=The Guardian (Australia)|accessdate=1 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180828120136/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/25/great-barrier-reef-2050-plan-no-longer-achievable-due-to-climate-change-experts-say|archive-date=28 August 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the Australian Parliament passed the [[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act]], which improved the operation of national environmental law by providing guidance about regional biodiversity conservation priorities. The marine bioregional planning process came from the implementation of this law. This process conserves marine biodiversity by considering the whole ecosystem a species is in and how different species interact in the marine environment.

There are two steps to this process. The first step is to identify regional conservation priorities in the five (currently) different marine regions. The second step is to identify marine reserves (protected areas or marine parks) to be added to Australia's National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas. Like protected areas on land, marine reserves are created to protect biodiversity for generations to come. Marine reserves are identified based on criteria written in a document created by Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council called "Guidelines for establishing the national representative system of marine protected areas", also known as just "the Guidelines". These guidelines are nationally recognised and implemented at the local level based on the Australian policy for implementation outlined in the "Goals and Principles for the Establishment of the National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas in Commonwealth Waters". These policies are in place to make sure that a marine reserve is only added to the NRSMPA after careful evaluation of different data.

The priorities for each region are created based on human and environmental threats and the Marine Bioregional Plans are drafted to address these priorities. To assess different region's priorities, three steps are taken, first, a bioregional profile is created, second, a bioregional plan is drafted, and third, the plan is finalised. After the plan is finalised, activity in different bioregions may become limited based on particular threats an activity may pose.&lt;ref name="Marine Bioregional Planning Process"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/mbp/publications/east/pubs/fs-mbp.pdf |title=FACT SHEET – MARINE BIOREGIONAL PLANNING – THE PROCESS |publisher=environment.gov.au |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314003841/http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/mbp/publications/east/pubs/fs-mbp.pdf |archivedate=14 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the GBRMPA released a report about the declining water quality in the Great Barrier Reef and detailed the importance of this issue. In response to this report, in 2003, the Australian and Queensland governments launched a joint initiative to improve the quality of water entering the Great Barrier Reef.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reefplan.qld.gov.au/about/history/|title=History|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216232922/http://reefplan.qld.gov.au/about/history/|archivedate=16 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decline in the quality of water over the past 150 years (due to development) has contributed to coral bleaching, [[algal bloom]]s, and [[pesticide pollution]]. These forms of pollution have made the reef less resilient to climate change.

When the plan was introduced in October 2003, it originally contained 65 actions built on previous legislation. Their immediate goal was to halt and reverse the decline in water quality entering the reef by 2013. By 2020, they hope that the quality of the water entering in the reef improves enough so that it doesn't have a detrimental impact on the health of the Great Barrier Reef. To achieve these goals they decided to reduce pollutants in the water entering the reef and to rehabilitate and conserve areas of the reef that naturally help reduce water pollutants. To achieve the objectives described above, this plan focuses on non-point sources of pollution, which cannot be traced to a single source such as a waste outlet.

The plan specifically targets nutrients, pesticides and sediment that make their way into the reef as a result of agricultural activities. Other non-point sources of pollution that are attributed to urban areas are covered under different legislation. In 2009, the plan was updated. The updated version states that to date, none of the efforts undertaken to improve the quality of water entering the reef has been successful. The new plan attempts to address this issue by "targeting priority outcomes, integrating industry and community initiatives and incorporating new policy and regulatory frameworks (Reef Plan&amp;nbsp;5)". This updated version has improved the clarity of the previous plan and targets set by that plan, have improved accountability and further improved monitoring and assessment. The 2009 report found that 41 out of the 65 actions met their original goals, however, 18 were not progressing well according to evaluation criteria as well as 6 were rated as having unsatisfactory levels of progress.

Some key achievements made since the plan's initial passing in 2003 were the establishment of the Reef Quality Partnership to set targets, report findings and monitor progress towards targets, improved land condition by landowners was rewarded with extended leases, Water Quality Improvement Plans were created to identify regional targets and identified management changes that needed to be made to reach those targets, Nutrient Management Zones have been created to combat [[sediment]] loss in particular areas, education programs have been started to help gather support for sustainable agriculture, changes to land management practices have taken place through the implementation of the Farm Management Systems and codes of practice, the creation of the Queensland Wetland program and other achievements were made to help improve the water quality flowing into the coral reefs.

A taskforce of scientists was also created to assess the impact of different parts of the plan on the quality of water flowing into the coral reefs. They found that many of the goals have yet to be reached but found more evidence that states that improving the water quality of the Great Barrier Reef will improve its resilience to climate change. The Reefocus summit in 2008, which is also detailed in the report, came to similar conclusions. After this, a stakeholder working group was formed that worked between several groups as well as the Australian and Queensland governments to update reef goals and objectives. The updated version of the plan focuses on strategic priority areas and actions to achieve 2013 goals. Also quantitative targets have been made to critically assess whether targets are being met.

Some examples of the water quality goals outlined by this plan are that by 2013, there will be a 50% reduction in nitrogen and phosphorus loads at the end of catchments and that by 2020, there will be a reduction in sediment load by 20%. The plan also outlines a number of steps that must be taken by landholders to help improve grazing, soil, nutrient, and chemical management practices. There are also a number of supporting initiatives to take place outlined in the plan to help create a framework to improve land use practices which will in turn improve water quality.

Through these means the governments of Australia and Queensland hope to improve water quality by 2013. The 2013 outlook report and revised water quality plan will assess what needs to be done in the future to improve water quality and the livelihoods of the wildlife that resides there.&lt;ref name="WQ protection plan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reefplan.qld.gov.au/library/pdf/reef-plan-2009.pdf |title=Reef Water Quality Protection Plan 2009 |publisher=reefplan.qld.gov.au |format=PDF |date=2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706122458/http://www.reefplan.qld.gov.au/library/pdf/reef-plan-2009.pdf |archivedate=6 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Abbot Point coal port dredge dumping controversy====
In December 2013, [[Greg Hunt]], the [[Minister for the Environment (Australia)|Australian environment minister]], approved a plan for dredging to create three shipping terminals as part of the construction of a coalport. According to corresponding approval documents, the process will create around 3&amp;nbsp;million cubic metres of dredged seabed that will be dumped within the Great Barrier Reef marine park area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Greg Hunt approves dredging off Queensland to create huge coalport|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/10/greg-hunt-approves-dredging-off-queensland-to-create-huge-coalport|accessdate=18 December 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 December 2013|author=Oliver Milman|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217221419/http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/10/greg-hunt-approves-dredging-off-queensland-to-create-huge-coalport|archivedate=17 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 January 2014, the GBRMPA issued a dumping permit that will allow three million cubic metres of sea bed from [[Abbot Point]], north of Bowen, to be transported and unloaded in the waters of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Potential significant harms have been identified in relation to dredge spoil and the process of churning up the sea floor in the area and exposing it to air: firstly, new research shows the finer particles of dredge spoil can cloud the water and block sunlight, thereby starving sea grass and coral up to distances of 80&amp;nbsp;km away from the point of origin due to the actions of wind and currents. Furthermore, dredge spoil can literally smother reef or sea grass to death, while storms can repeatedly resuspend these particles so that the harm caused is ongoing; secondly, disturbed sea floor can release toxic substances into the surrounding environment.&lt;ref name="Spoil"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dredge dumping: just because you can doesn't mean you should|url=http://www.abc.net.au/environment/articles/2014/01/31/3935720.htm|accessdate=1 February 2014|newspaper=ABC News|date=31 January 2014|author=Dermot O'Gorman|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203074313/http://www.abc.net.au/environment/articles/2014/01/31/3935720.htm|archivedate=3 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dredge spoil from the Abbot Point port project is to be dumped {{convert|24|km|mi}} away, near Bowen in north Queensland, and the approval from the Authority will result in the production of an extra 70 million tonnes of coal annually, worth between A$1.4&amp;nbsp;billion and $2.8&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="Spoil" /&gt; Authority chairman, Dr Russell Reichelt, stated after the confirmation of the approval:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This approval is in line with the agency’s view that port development along the Great Barrier Reef coastline should be limited to existing ports. As a deepwater port that has been in operation for nearly 30 years, Abbot Point is better placed than other ports along the Great Barrier Reef coastline to undertake expansion as the capital and maintenance dredging required will be significantly less than what would be required in other areas. It’s important to note the seafloor of the approved disposal area consists of sand, silt and clay and does not contain coral reefs or seagrass beds.&lt;ref name="Spoil" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The approval was provided with a corresponding set of 47 new environmental conditions that include the following:

*A long-term water quality monitoring plan extending five years after the disposal activity is completed.
*A heritage management plan to protect the Catalina second world war aircraft wreck in Abbot Bay.
*The establishment of an independent dredging and disposal technical advice panel and a management response group, to include community representatives.&lt;ref name="Spoil" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marine Parks dredge dumping permit"&gt;{{cite web|title=Marine Parks dredge dumping permit|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/123166/G34897.1-signed.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Federal Government announced on 13 November that there would now be a ban on the dumping of dredge spoil in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The World Heritage Committee asked Environment Minister Greg Hunt to investigate alternative options to dump on land instead. The Queensland government and the Commonwealth have now accepted the alternative option and advice from The World Heritage Committee and will now commence dumping on land.

===Tourism===
{{main|Tourism on the Great Barrier Reef}}

[[File:Amazing Great Barrier Reef 1.jpg|thumb|right|Helicopter view of the reef and boats]]
Due to its vast [[biodiversity]], warm clear waters and accessibility from the tourist boats called "[[live aboard]]s", the reef is a very popular destination, especially for [[scuba diving|scuba divers]]. Tourism on the Great Barrier Reef is concentrated in Cairns and also The Whitsundays due to their accessibility. These areas make up 7%–8% of the Park's area.&lt;ref name=CRC46/&gt; The Whitsundays and [[Cairns]] have their own Plans of Management.&lt;ref name = "2005Brochure"/&gt; Many cities along the Queensland coast offer daily boat trips. Several continental and coral cay islands are now [[resort]]s, including [[Green Island (Queensland)|Green Island]] and [[Lady Elliot Island]]. As of 1996, 27 islands on the Great Barrier Reef supported resorts.&lt;ref name=CRC46/&gt;

In 1996, most of the tourism in the region was domestically generated and the most popular visiting times were during the Australian winter. At this time, it was estimated that tourists to the Great Barrier Reef contributed [[Australian dollar|A$]]776&amp;nbsp;million per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Sally |last1=Driml |first2=Mick |last2=Common |year=1996 |title=Ecological Economics Criteria for Sustainable Tourism: Application to the Great Barrier Reef and Wet Tropics World Heritage Areas, Australia |journal=Journal of Sustainable Tourism |volume=4 |issue=1 |url=http://www.multilingual-matters.net/jost/004/0003/jost0040003.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=31 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218133426/http://www.multilingual-matters.net/jost/004/0003/jost0040003.pdf |archivedate=18 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the largest commercial activity in the region, it was estimated in 2003 that tourism generated over A$4&amp;nbsp;billion annually,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority |year=2003 |title=Summary report of the social and economic impacts of the rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. |url=http://www.ens.gu.edu.au/2281aes/docs/TEV_GBR.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=14 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920151126/http://www.ens.gu.edu.au/2281aes/docs/TEV_GBR.pdf |archivedate=20 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2005 estimate increased to A$5.1&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=2005Brochure&gt;{{cite web |author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority |year=2005 |title=Protecting Biodiversity Brochure 2005 |url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/info_services/publications/brochures/index.html |accessdate=11 November 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017010423/http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/info_services/publications/brochures/index.html |archivedate=17 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Deloitte]] report published by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority in March 2013 states that the Reef's 2,000 kilometres of coastline attracts tourism worth A$6.4&amp;nbsp;billion annually and employs more than 64,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Is Australia shooting itself in the foot with reef port expansions?|url=http://theconversation.com/is-australia-shooting-itself-in-the-foot-with-reef-port-expansions-22992|accessdate=14 March 2014|newspaper=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]|date=14 March 2014|author=[[Ove Hoegh-Guldberg (biologist)|Ove Hoegh-Guldberg]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314143306/http://theconversation.com/is-australia-shooting-itself-in-the-foot-with-reef-port-expansions-22992|archivedate=14 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outer part of the Great Barrier Reef is favoured for such activities, due to water quality.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Management of tourism in the Great Barrier Reef is geared towards making tourism [[ecological sustainability|ecologically sustainable]]. A daily fee is levied that goes towards research of the Great Barrier Reef.&lt;ref name = "2005Brochure"/&gt; This fee ends up being 20% of the GBRMPA's income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority |year=2005 |title=How is the Money Used? |work=Onboard – The Tourism Operator's Handbook for the Great Barrier Reef |url=http://www.tourismoperators.reefhq.com.au/emc/use_of/index.html |accessdate=11 November 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060920042807/http://www.tourismoperators.reefhq.com.au/emc/use_of/index.html |archivedate=20 September 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Policies on [[cruise ship]]s, [[bareboat charter]]s, and anchorages limit the traffic on the Great Barrier Reef.&lt;ref name = "2005Brochure"/&gt;

The problems that surround ecotourism in the Great Barrier Reef revolve around permanent tourism platforms. Platforms are large, ship-like vessels that act as a base for tourists while scuba diving and snorkelling in the Great Barrier Reef. Seabirds will land on the platforms and defecate which will eventually be washed into the sea. The feces carry nitrogen, phosphorus and often [[DDT]] and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which cause [[aspergillosis]], [[yellow-band disease]], and [[black band disease]]. Areas without tourism platforms have 14 out of 9,468 (1.1%) diseased corals versus areas with tourism platforms that have 172 out of 7,043 (12%) diseased corals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lamb|first=Joleah|author2=Bette Willis|title=Using coral disease prevalence to assess the effects of concentrating tourism activities on offshore reefs in a tropical marine park|journal=Conservation Biology|date=August 2011|volume=25|issue=5|pages=1044–1052|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01724.x|pmid=21848962}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourism is a major economic activity for the region. Thus, while non-permanent platforms could be possible in some areas, overall, permanent platforms are likely a necessity. Solutions have been suggested to siphon bird waste into gutters connecting to tanks helping lower runoff that causes coral disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kight|first=Caitlin|title=Are Coral Reefs Literally Sick of Ecotourists?|url=http://www.science20.com/anthrophysis/are_coral_reefs_literally_sick_ecotourists-82312|accessdate=15 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429185754/http://www.science20.com/anthrophysis/are_coral_reefs_literally_sick_ecotourists-82312|archivedate=29 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has also placed many permanent anchorage points around the general use areas. These act to reduce damage to the reef due to anchoring destroying soft coral, chipping hard coral, and disturbing sediment as it is dragged across the bottom. Tourism operators also must comply with speed limits when travelling to or from tourist destinations, to prevent excessive wake from the boats disturbing the reef ecosystem.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

===Fishing===
The [[fishing industry]] in the Great Barrier Reef, controlled by the Queensland Government, is worth [[Australian dollar|A$]]1&amp;nbsp;billion annually.&lt;ref name="economics"&gt;{{cite web|author=Access Economics Pty Ltd|year=2005|title=Measuring the economic and financial value of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/5584/gbrmpa_RP84_Measuring_The_Economic_And_Financial_Value_Of_The_GBRMP_2005.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2 March 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FsFbPnYy?url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/5584/gbrmpa_RP84_Measuring_The_Economic_And_Financial_Value_Of_The_GBRMP_2005.pdf|archivedate=14 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It employs approximately 2000 people, and fishing in the Great Barrier Reef is pursued commercially, for recreation, and as a traditional means for feeding one's family.&lt;ref name= traditionalfishing/&gt;

===Dugong hunting===
Under the [[Native Title Act 1993]], native title holders [[Dugong hunting in Australia|retain the right to legally hunt dugongs]] and [[green turtle]]s for "personal, domestic or non-commercial communal needs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatbarrierreef.org.au/dugongs-and-turtles/|title=DUGONGS AND TURTLES|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611050734/http://www.greatbarrierreef.org.au/dugongs-and-turtles/|archivedate=11 June 2014|df=dmy-all|access-date=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{reliable|date=October 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2030">'''Hierocles''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: Ἱεροκλῆς ''Hierokles'') was a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] geographer of the sixth century and the attributed author of the ''[[Synecdemus]]'' or ''Synekdemos'', which contains a table of administrative divisions of the Byzantine Empire and lists of the cities of each.  The work is dated to the reign of [[Justinian]] but prior to 535, as it divides the 912 listed cities in the Empire among 64 [[Eparchy|Eparchies]].  The ''Synecdemus'' is thus one of the most invaluable monuments which we have to study the political geography of the sixth century East. The work of Hierocles along with that of [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] were the principal sources of [[Constantine VII]]'s work on the [[Theme (Byzantine district)|Theme]]s (''De Thematibus'').  Hierocles was published by Parthey (Hieroclis Synecdemus; Berlin, 1866) then in a corrected text, by A. Burckhardt in the [[Teubner]] series ([https://books.google.com/books?id=HIITK93F54wC Hieroclis Synecdemus; Leipzig, 1893]).  The most recent major publication was by E. Honigmann (''Le Synekdèmos d'Hiéroklès et l'opuscule géographique de Georges de Chypre''; Brussels, 1939). 

The Synecdemus of Hierocles should not be confused with a [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] prayer book by the same name.

'''ISO 3166-2:ST''' is the entry for [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for São Tomé and Príncipe, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for the 2 former provinces, [[São Tomé Island|São Tomé]] and [[Príncipe]]. Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|ST}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of São Tomé and Príncipe. The second part is a letter.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:ST ISO 3166 codes for Sao Tome and Principe]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Council on Mining and Metals''' (ICMM) was founded in 2001 to improve [[sustainable development]] performance in the mining and metals industry.

== Sustainable Development ==
In 2001 the International Council on Mining and Metals were developed to bring many different mining companies together and increase performance measures and development in this sector. The ICMM's main goal is to create new opportunities in the mining sector, and overcome many challenges that will be presented in the future. ICMM are looking for ways to continually improve the sector and bring the many issues to the forefront to be resolved in the future. Another goal of ICMM is to work alongside all their shareholders and in turn create new and prosperous relationships with them. They feel that creating a identity with other companies and shareholders will boost there overall public image and help them meet their goals.

The ICMM has developed 10 principles to which member companies must adhere. These considerations resulted from a survey of concerned parties both within and outside the council. They seek to comply and reinforce guidelines established by organizations including the [[OECD]] and the [[World Bank]].

He is a Professor Emeritus in the Department of Geology and Geography at [[West Virginia University]].

==Early life and education==

Martis was born in Toledo, Ohio in December 1945.  His four grandparents and father were immigrants from Slovakia. Martis obtained a B.Ed. degree from The University of Toledo in 1968 and a M.A. in geography from San Diego State College (later San Diego State University) in 1970.  In 1975 he joined the faculty of West Virginia University and the next year received his Ph.D. in geography from the [[University of Michigan]], studying under political geographer [[George Kish]].

==Contributions to Political Geography==

Martis is the author or co-author of eight award winning books on the United States Congress and American politics.  The first book in his series of historical political atlases, ''[[The Historical Atlas of United States Congressional Districts: 1789-1983]]'', was designated a Selected Reference Book by the journal ''College and Research Libraries'' and won the American Historical Association's [[Waldo G. Leland]] Prize for the best reference book in all fields of history for the period 1981-1986.  The Atlas was the first book in American history to map every congressional district for every election and catalog all state redistricting laws. Based on the archival work for this book, Martis and Ruth A. Rowles were awarded the 1984 Organization of American Historian's Charles Thomson Prize for their article "Mapping Congress: Developing a Geographic Understanding of American Political History."[[File:Wiki-37thMap.JPG|thumb|Congressional Districts of the Thirty-Seventh Congress, 1861-1863|551x551px]]

The Thirty-seventh Congress illustration is an example of the congressional district boundary maps found in ''[[The Historical Atlas of United States Congressional Districts: 1789-1983]]''. In the atlas there are ninety-seven national scale district maps, one for each of the first ninety-seven House of Representatives. The Thirty-seventh House (1861-1863) was primarily elected in 1860 and is the first House to convene during the Civil War. The striped areas designate districts in the eleven seceded states which did not send representatives to the United States Congress. However, the House did certify and seat ten “Unionist” members from three seceded states, five from Virginia, three from western Tennessee and two from southern Louisiana (elected after the New Orleans area was occupied). On the page opposite of each map is an alphabetical list of all who served in the House with their state and congressional district number or designation (note in the Thirty-seventh House illustration two members from Minnesota and three from California were not elected from districts but on a General Ticket, that is, statewide). Insert maps are used to illustrate very small districts in densely populated urban areas. Information is found at the bottom of each map giving the session dates, total number of representatives, Speaker, newly admitted states, and map notes indicating vacancies throughout the Congress and any significant state or national boundary changes.

In 1989 the second book in his series of political atlases was published, ''[[The Historical Atlas of Political Parties in the United States Congress: 1789-1989]]''. The atlas was the first in American history to map all congressional elections for every state and district and identify the political party affiliation of every person elected to Congress from 1788. The Library Journal designated the political party atlas as one of the Best Reference Books of 1989 and College and Research Libraries named it a Selected Reference Book of 1989-90. The Library of Congress selected the political cartography from this work as the centerpiece of its main exhibition "Tides of Party Politics: Two Centuries of Congressional Elections" celebrating of the 1989 bicentennial of the United States Congress. The data developed for this work is now considered the standard source of political party affiliation of members of Congress by the official ''Biographical Directory of the United States Congress''. In 2013 an article in Real Clear Politics selected the political party atlas as one of the 15 most influential/indispensable books on the subject of American election analysis (ranked #10).[[File:Political Parties of the Eightieth Congress, 1947 - 1949.jpg|thumb|554x554px|Political Parties of the Eightieth Congress (1947-1949)]]The Eightieth Congress illustration is an example of the election maps found in [[The Historical Atlas of Political Parties in the United States Congress: 1789-1989]]. In the atlas there are one hundred large national four-color district election maps for the House of Representatives, and one hundred smaller state election maps for the Senate, for each of the first one hundred congresses. The maps are based upon the results tabulated on the regular Election Day. The Eightieth Congress (1947-1949) was a midterm election, with voting taking place on November 5, 1946 (Maine September 9, 1946). On the large House map blue indicates districts electing a Republican and red designates districts electing a Democrat. Insert maps are used to illustrate the results in very small districts in densely populated urban areas. The atlas identifies and maps all third party members elected to Congress in American history.  In the Eightieth House one third party representative was elected, an American-Labor Party candidate from the 18th District of New York. The percentage pie chart on the lower right gives a visual view and specific numbers for the partisan divide in each House. The map and pie chart on the lower left show the geographical pattern and partisan make-up of the Senate. The blue states have two Republican senators, red states two Democrats, and striped states one each. On the page opposite of the map page is a state by state list of all who served in the House and Senate, including replacements by special election or appointment, with their proper state and congressional district number and party affiliation (note in the Eightieth House illustration two representatives from both Arizona and New Mexico were not elected from districts but on a General Ticket, that is, statewide). The atlas facilitates comparisons with the previous Seventy-ninth Congress, and subsequent Eighty-first Congress, and all other congresses, in both geographic pattern and partisan divide. The geographical pattern shown for the Eightieth Congress is a classic post-Civil War regional division of the solid Democratic South and solid Republican North, with some Democrats elected from large urban areas.  
In 1993 his third book on Congress, co-authored with Gregory A. Elmes, ''The Historical Atlas of State Power in Congress: 1790-1990'' was published. This work maps and analyzes every apportionment change for every state for all of United States history. This work won the 1993 Washington Book Publishers award for best book design.

In 1994 ''The Historical Atlas of the Congresses of the Confederate States of America: 1861-1865'' was published.  This book is the first nonmilitary nonbattlefield atlas of the American Civil War.  The American Library Association, Choice Magazine, designated this work an Outstanding Academic Book of 1994. 
[[File:District Occupation Status - First Confederate Congress, Fourth Session.jpg|thumb|551x551px|District Occupation Status – First Confederate Congress Fourth Session]]
During the Civil War the Confederate Constitution set up a government with a president and a legislature, which was composed of a Senate and House of Representatives. The Confederate congressional atlas maps the districts, characteristics, elections and roll call voting behavior of this institution. The illustration shows the Union occupation status of the 106 districts of the Confederate House of Representatives in late 1863 and early 1864. Note the Confederacy admitted the slave states of Missouri and Kentucky, and they had full voting rights in the Confederate Congress, in spite of being Union controlled virtually from the beginning of the war, and in spite of their continued representation in the United States Congress. At the end of the First Confederate Congress only a little over a half of the House districts (52.8%) were unoccupied. The Union occupied areas mostly supported the increasingly stringent legislative proposals of Confederate President Jefferson Davis with respect to measures like conscription, impressment and habeas corpus. In other words, Confederate congressmen from occupied districts tended to support increasing conscription knowing men from their areas would not be subject, but many representatives from unoccupied districts tended to vote no, knowing men from their areas would bear the brunt of being drafted.

In 2002 the ''Atlas of American Politics: 1960-2000'', was published, which Martis co-authored with J. Clark Archer, Stephen J. Lavin, and Fred M. Shelley.  This atlas won the American Library Association Outstanding Academic Book Award of 2003.  In 2006 he co-authored the ''Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections: 1788-2004'' with the same collaborators; it was the first county four-color atlas of all American presidential elections.  In 2006 the Atlas was awarded the Library Journal Best Reference Book prize and the Association of American Publishers Outstanding Single Volume Reference Book in the Humanities &amp; Social Sciences recognition. His most recent two books are co-edited works, ''Atlas of the 2012 Elections'' and ''Atlas of the 2016 Elections''. These atlases cover a myriad geographical aspects of the fall 2012 and 2016 elections on the national, regional, state and county level, and each contain nearly 200 maps, graphs and illustrations.

In 1987 he was a Fulbright Scholar in Perugia, Italy studying the Italian electoral system at the ''Universitá per Stranieri''.  In 2001 he was interviewed for the distinguished "Geographers on Film" series that highlights the career and work of notable American geographers.  Kenneth C. Martis is a Professor Emeritus of Geography at West Virginia University and is the first awardee of that institution's highest academic honor, Benedum Distinguished Scholar.  He was awarded the 2007 US/West Virginia Professor of the Year Award by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE), Washington, DC.

For his work on the historical geography of Congress and American politics he has received support from the National Endowment for the Humanities, National Science Foundation, Association of American Geographers, Everett McKinley Dirksen Congressional Leadership Research Center, Huntington Library, and the Newberry Library.

[[File:Mining claim, South Yuba River (cropped).jpg|thumb|Claim at the [[Yuba River|South Yuba River]]]]
A '''land claim''' is a legal declaration of desired control over areas of property, including bodies of water. The phrase is usually only used with respect to disputed or unresolved land claims. Some types of land claims include [[aboriginal land claim]]s, [[Territorial claims of Antarctica|Antarctic land claims]], and post-colonial land claims.

Land claims is sometimes used as a term when referring to disputed territories like [[Western Sahara]] or to refer to the claims of displaced persons. 

In the [[Colonialism|colonial]] times of the United States American men could claim a piece of land for themselves and the claim has different level of merit according to the [[de facto]] conditions:
# claim without any action on the ground
# claim with (movable) property of the claimant on the ground
# claim with the claimant visiting the land
# claim with claimant living on the land.

Today, only small areas of unclaimed land remain, yet large plots of land with little economical value (e.g., in Alaska) can still be bought for very low prices. Also, in certain parts of the world, land can still be [[Land_tenure#Modes_of_ownership_and_tenure|obtained]] by making productive use of it.

==Mining claim (United States)==
A '''mining claim''' is the claim of the right to extract minerals from a tract of public land. In the United States, the practice began with the [[California gold rush]] of 1849. In the absence of effective government, the miners in each new mining camp made up their own rules, and chose to essentially adopt Mexican mining law then in effect in California. The Mexican law gave the right to mine to the first one to discover the mineral deposit and begin mining it. The area that could be claimed by one person was limited to that which could be mined by a single individual or a small group.

The US system of mining claims is an application of the legal theory of ''[[prior appropriation]]'', by which public property is granted to the first one to put it to beneficial use.  Other applications of appropriation theory were the [[Homestead Act]], which granted public land to farmers, and water rights in the west.

The California miners spread the concept of mining claims to other mining districts all over the western United States.  The US Congress legalized the practice in 1866, and amended it in the [[Mining Act of 1872]].  All land in the [[Public_domain_(land)|public domain]], that is, federal land whose use has not been restricted by the government to some specific purpose, was subject to being claimed.  The mining law has been changed numerous times, but still retains some features similar to those settled on by the California [[California_Gold_Rush#Forty-niners|49ers]].

The concept was also used in other countries, for example during the [[Australian gold rushes]] which occurred at a similar time starting from the 1850s, and included similar groups of people including miners that migrated from the American gold rushes. The [[Oriental Claims]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] are one example of this.

===Staking a claim===
[[File:Mining claim corner Blue Ribbon Mine Alaska.jpg|thumb|Corner post of the claim of the Blue Ribbon Mine in Alaska]]

'''Staking a claim''' involves first the discovery of a valuable mineral in quantities that a "prudent man" (the Prudent Man Rule) would invest time and expenses to recover. Next, marking the claim boundaries, typically with wooden posts or capped steel posts, which must be four feet tall, or stone cairns, which must be three feet tall. Finally, filing a claim with both the land management agency (USFS or BLM), and the local county registrar.

There are four main types of mining claims: 
# Placer (minerals free of the local bedrock, and deposited in benches or streams) 
# Lode (minerals in place in the mother rock), 
# Tunnel (a location for a proposed tunnel which claims all veins discovered during the driving of it) 
# Millsite (a maximum five acre site for processing ore) 

A mining claim always starts out as an '''unpatented claim'''. The owner of an unpatented claim must continue mining or exploration activities on an unpatented claim, or he may pay a fee to the land management agency by September 1 of each year, or it is considered abandoned and becomes null. Activities on unpatented claims must be restricted to those necessary to mining. A '''patented claim''' is one for which the federal government has issued a ''patent'' (deed). To obtain a patent, the owner of a mining claim must prove to the federal government that the claim contains locatable minerals that can be extracted at a profit. A patented claim can be used for any purpose desired by the owner, just like any other real estate. However, Congress has ceased funding for the patenting process, so at this time a claim cannot be patented.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

{{Politics of Venezuela}}

Under the [[Constitution of Venezuela|Venezuelan Constitution]], the [[President of Venezuela]] is the [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] of [[Venezuela]]. As chief of the executive branch and face of the government as a whole, the presidency is the highest political office in the country by influence and recognition. The president is also the [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[National Bolivarian Armed Forces of Venezuela]]. The president is [[direct election|directly elected]] through a popular vote to a six-year [[Term of office|term]]. Since the [[Venezuelan constitutional referendum, 2009|2009 constitutional referendum]], any person can be elected to the office an indefinite number of times. Upon the death, resignation, or removal from office of an incumbent president, the [[Vice President of Venezuela|vice president]] assumes the office. The president must be at least 30 years of age, and has to be a "natural born" citizen of Venezuela, and cannot possess any other citizenship.

This list includes only those persons who were sworn into office as president following the establishment of the independent [[State of Venezuela]], which took place on January 13, 1830. There have been 46 people sworn into office, and 64 presidencies, as several politicians (most prominently between 1830 and 1953) have held the office more than once. [[José Antonio Páez]], the first president, was inaugurated in 1830. [[Antonio Guzmán Blanco]] served during the most number of terms, with three. [[Juan Vicente Gómez]] has served during the longest (although interrupted by interim presidencies), with over 27 years. [[Hugo Chávez]] served the longest uninterrupted period in office with 11 consecutive years, starting after his restoration to power in April 2002 and until his death in March 2013. The current president, [[Nicolás Maduro]], was elected to his first term in [[Venezuelan presidential election, 2013|2013]].

==History==

===Before 1830===
The presidential designation encompasses only those persons who were sworn into office as President of Venezuela following [[Venezuelan Declaration of Independence|Venezuela's declaration of independence]] from [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] [[imperialism|colonial rule]], which took effect on July 5, 1811. The first president, taking office on July 5, 1811, was actually the president of a [[triumvirate]] of the [[First Republic of Venezuela|first established Republic of Venezuela]] that rotated the presidency weekly. The person serving as president during the week of July 5 was one of the three signatories of the Declaration of Independence: [[Cristóbal Mendoza]]. Mendoza shared the triumvirate with Juan Escalona and Baltasar Padrón. A second [[triumvirate]] followed on April 3, 1812 whose members were Francisco Espejo, Fernando Toro and Francisco Javier Ustariz.&lt;ref&gt;{{es_icon}} {{cite web|title=Presidentes de Venezuela|url=http://www.pac.com.ve/contenido/educacion/lista-de-presidentes-de-venezuela/11062/81|publisher=Consulado General de Bucaramanga}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Briceño Perozo, Mario. "Mendoza, Cristóbal de"lar, 1899. {{ISBN|978-980-6397-37-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to the profound confusion of the [[Venezuelan War of Independence]] and the period of [[Gran Colombia]] over what is now Venezuela, this page has gaps between 1813 and 1819. For this period in time, historians refer to the Republic of Venezuela as the [[Second Republic of Venezuela]] (1813–1814) and the [[Third Republic of Venezuela]] (1817–1819) as [[Simon Bolivar]] twice reestablished the republic. The [[Congress of Angostura]] appointed [[Simón Bolívar]] "Supreme Commander of the Republic of Venezuela" (Jefe Supremo de la República de Venezuela) from 1819 until 1830.

===After 1830===
In 1830, [[José Antonio Páez]] declared Venezuela independent from [[Gran Colombia]] and became president, taking office on January 13, 1830. Although he was not the first president of Venezuela (having in mind [[Cristóbal Mendoza]] in 1811), he was the first head of state of independent Venezuela, after the dissolution of Gran Colombia.

The list below includes interim "caretaker" as well as regular [[Incumbency|serving]] presidents, and democratically installed presidents as well as those installed by other means (e.g.; [[Marcos Pérez Jiménez]]).

! №&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ref name=President&gt;For the purposes of numbering, a presidency is defined as an uninterrupted period of time in office served by one person. For example, [[Carlos Soublette]] was both the 8th and 10th President because the two periods where he was president were not consecutive. A period during which a vice-president temporarily becomes acting president under the Constitution is not a presidency, because the president remains in office during such a period.&lt;/ref&gt;

! Term of office
! Term&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ref name=Term&gt;For the purposes of numbering, a term is a period between two presidential elections. Some terms might be longer than originally expected due to [[coup d'état]]s or the installation of military dictatorships, thus extending the time between two elections. Venezuela's unique history has allowed several presidents to serve during a single term, as well as some presidents, such as [[Jose Maria Vargas]], serving twice during a single term.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republic of Venezuela (1953–1999)===
Venezuela took the name of '''Republic of Venezuela''' ({{lang-es|República de Venezuela}}) with the adoption of the 1953 constitution, written by the Constituent Assembly elected in November 1952. The Presidents of Venezuela under this constitution (as well as the 1961 Constitution, which kept the name) were officially styled as President of the Republic of Venezuela.

This period of the history of Venezuela began with the presidency of [[Marcos Pérez Jiménez]], widely perceived to be a [[dictator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/22/world/marcos-perez-jimenez-87-venezuela-ruler.html|title=Marcos Pérez Jiménez, 87, Venezuela Ruler|last=Rohter|first=Larry|date=22 September 2001|accessdate=20 January 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/sep/21/guardianobituaries1|title=Obituary: General Marcos Pérez Jiménez|work=[[The Guardian]]|last=Ledezma|first=Eurídice|date=21 September 2001|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a short period of political instability following Pérez Jiménez's exile in 1958, democracy was restored in the country with the election of [[Democratic Action]] leader [[Rómulo Betancourt]] as President in 1959. This marked the beginning of the so-called [[Punto Fijo Pact]], which was characterized by the prevalence of the [[Two-party system|bipartidism]] of the two main political parties in the country at the time, Democratic Action and [[Copei]].

The [[second presidency of Carlos Andrés Pérez]] (1989–93) saw a deep economic crisis, major riots in which hundreds were killed by security forces (the [[Caracazo]], 1989), [[1992 Venezuelan coup d'état attempts|two coup attempts in 1992]], and the 1993 impeachment of Pérez. That same year, [[Rafael Caldera]] became the first President of Venezuela not to belong to either Democratic Action or Copei in over forty years, having been elected under the banner of [[National Convergence (Venezuela)|National Convergence]]. The Punto Fijo Pact ended in 2000 when a [[Constitution of Venezuela|new constitution]] entered in force.

===Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (1999–present)===
{{main|History of Venezuela (1999–present)}}
Venezuela became the "[[Bolivarian Revolution|Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela]]" ({{lang-es|República Bolivariana de Venezuela}}) with the adoption of the [[Constitution of Venezuela|1999 constitution]], which renamed the country in honor of [[Simón Bolívar]]. The new constitution was promulgated by President [[Hugo Chávez]], who served ''de jure'' from 1999 until his death in 2013. The new constitution augmented the presidential term from five years to six years.

Chávez's presidency was interrupted shortly in 2002 following a failed [[2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt|coup d'état attempt]] that put [[Pedro Carmona]] in office for a day. After government-loyal forces ousted Carmona from [[Miraflores Palace|Miraflores]], [[Vice President of Venezuela|Vice President]] [[Diosdado Cabello]] assumed executive control for a couple of hours until Chávez could be restored. In 2009, a [[Venezuelan constitutional referendum, 2009|constitutional referendum]] approved the elimination of term limits, which allowed Chávez to be re-elected again in [[Venezuelan presidential election, 2012|2012]]. However, Chávez [[Death and state funeral of Hugo Chávez|died]] in March 2013, only three months into his fourth term, and was succeeded by his Vice President [[Nicolás Maduro]], who was [[Venezuelan presidential election, 2013|elected]] the following month to finish Chávez's term, enforcing the majority of Chávez's [[Economic policy of the Hugo Chávez government|economic policies]].

Under Maduro, Venezuela has seen a rise in [[unemployment]], shortages of goods, closures of several corporations, and the deterioration of productivity. Maduro – who has seen a sharp decline in his approval ratings in correlation to the economic collapse, and was the subject of a 2016 recall referendum to remove him from office that was later suspended&lt;ref name="FOXsuspend"&gt;{{cite news|title=Venezuela Suspends Recall Campaign Against President Maduro|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/10/20/venezuela-suspends-recall-campaign-against-president-maduro.html|accessdate=21 October 2016|work=[[Fox News]]|date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; – has been criticized for what opponents consider to be him [[Democratic backsliding|backsliding]] the country towards a full-fledged authoritarian regime; this led to an ongoing [[2017 Venezuelan constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis]] stemming from a March 2017 ruling by the [[Supreme Tribunal of Justice (Venezuela)|Supreme Tribunal of Justice]] (whose members largely consist of Maduro supporters) that removed immunity for [[National Assembly (Venezuela)|National Assembly]] members (including those opposing Maduro),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-39449494|title=Venezuela 'coup': Alarm grows as court takes power|date=2017-03-31|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-03-31|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; which subsequently made a brief assumption of legislative powers from the Assembly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/world/americas/venezuelas-supreme-court-takes-power-from-legislature.html|title=Venezuela Muzzles Legislature, Moving Closer to One-Man Rule|last=Casey|first=Nicholas|date=2017-03-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-31|last2=Torres|first2=Patricia|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-39468045|title=Venezuela: Supreme court backtracks on powers bid|date=2017-04-01|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-04-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Venezuelan Constituent Assembly election, 2017|Constituent Assembly election]], which resulted in the formation of a [[2017 Constituent Assembly of Venezuela|Constituent Assembly]] intended to rewrite the 1999 constitution. These actions have worsened tensions and sparked violence during protests against the Maduro administration over concerns that Maduro would eliminate or significantly erode Venezuela's democratic institutions and shift the country towards [[dictatorship|one-man rule]].

After the ceremony, Geraldine literally flies up into the sky as a sign of happiness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29833">This '''toponymical list of counties of the United Kingdom''' is a list of the origins of the names of [[Counties of the United Kingdom|counties]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. For [[England]] and [[Wales]] it includes ancient and contemporary counties.

==Background==

Throughout the histories of the four [[countries of the United Kingdom]], a variety of languages have been used to name places. These languages were often used in parallel with each other.  As a result, it is often difficult to assess the genuine [[etymology]] of a placename, hence some of the entries below are assigned more than one meaning, depending on which language was used to originally give the place its name. One of the most common words used in county names in the United Kingdom is the [[Affix|suffix]] ''[[shire]]''. This is a [[West Sexaon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon]] word meaning ''division''.

| Ancient

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17930">{{main article|Altitudinal zonation}}

The climate and ecology of different locations on the globe naturally separate into [[life zones]], depending on [[elevation]], location, and [[latitude]]. The generally strong dependency on elevation is known as [[altitudinal zonation]]: the average temperature of a location decreases as the elevation increases.

The general effect of elevation depends on atmospheric physics. However, the specific climate and ecology of any particular location depends on specific features of that location. This article provides a '''list of life zones by region''', in order to illustrate the features of life zones for regions around the globe.

In the altitudes between 3,400 meters (11,000 feet) and 4,500 meters (15,000 feet) some of the most extreme examples of adaptations can be found. At altitudes below 3,400 meters (12,000 feet) the daily temperature fluctuations are less extreme, the average daily temperature steadily increases, and the growth forms and ecology of the ''[[Dendrosenecio|Dendroseneico]]'' reflect the increased influence of [[biotic factor]]s (such as competition for light) over [[Abiotic components|abiotic factor]]s (such as nightly frost).&lt;ref name="Speciation"&gt;Knox, Eric B.

== Jade Dragon Snow Mountains ==
The Jade Dragon Snow Mountains contain the glacier nearest of the Equator on the North Hemisphere. The landmarks 4,506 m and 4,680 m at the end of the glacier can be achieved through the cable car from Ganhaizi (Tibetan for dry lake, a grassland with conifers at 3,400 m). The mountain desert begins around 4,000 m. The [[Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas|Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan]] ([[List of World Heritage Sites in Asia and Australasia|UNESCO World Heritage Site]]) encompasses the watershed areas of the [[Yangtze]] (Jinsha), [[Mekong]] ([[Lancang River|Lan Cang]]) and [[Salween]] (Nujiang) rivers and is the joint of the [[Palearctic ecozone]] and the [[Indomalaya ecozone]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2688">The '''Mapping Services Agreement''' (MSA) is a licensing [[contract]] between local authorities in the [[United Kingdom]] and suppliers of [[geographic data]]. Most of its contents are covered by commercial in confidence requirements. The general outcome of the MSA, however, is the supply of geographic data to local authorities and the defining of licensing issues regarding address data.

The MSA replaced an existing agreement for the supply of geographic data between local authorities, police, fire and other emergency services, and the national mapping agency, [[Ordnance Survey]] (OS). It also complied with [[European Union]] rules on procurement. As a result, suppliers of geographic information had to go through a process of open procurement managed on behalf of local authorities by the IDeA, an umbrella government organisation coordinating and promoting local authority good practice.

The result was that three suppliers were selected: Ordnance Survey, Intermap and Intelligent Addressing. For local authorities this meant little change in the supply of mapping data which continued to be supplied by OS. Intermap, however, supplied height data not previously covered by other arrangements.

Perhaps the most significant outcome of the MSA is the resolution of ownership, licensing and royalty issues that had existed between local authorities and OS. In the agreement the address databases (called [[Local Land and Property Gazetteer]]s – LLPG) maintained by local authorities acknowledged the partial input of OS's address product, [[Address Point]] to these databases. In effect local authorities became "value added resellers" of ADDRESS-POINT and are required to pay OS royalties for the proportion of their use of the OS product.

The agreement also puts into place funding for the [[National Land and Property Gazetteer]] (NLPG), the UK's national address infrastructure, which is made up of the LLPGs compiled by local authorities. It also enables the NLPG to compel local authorities to maintain their LLPGs and thus ensure the nationwide coverage and compliance by local authorities.

The Mapping Services Agreement contract expired on 31 March 2012 and was replaced by the Data Co-operation Agreement.

'''Maru''' ([[Devanagari]]: मरु) is a historical neighborhood in central [[Kathmandu]], [[Nepal]] and one of the most important cultural spots in the city. It is linked with the origin of the name Kathmandu, and forms part of what is generically known as [[Durbar Square]] (including [[Kathmandu Durbar Square]], [[Patan Durbar Square]], and [[Bhaktapur Durbar Square]]), the old royal palace complexes of temples, shrines and palace buildings all of which have been declared [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s.

Maru is also a market square, a venue for religious festivals and a celebrated residential quarter. It is a crossroads where two ancient trade routes connecting [[India]] and [[Tibet]] intersect.&lt;ref&gt;Slusser, Mary Shepherd (1982) ''Volume 2 of Nepal Mandala: A Cultural Study of the Kathmandu Valley.''

Maru consists of a large square encircled by temples and rest houses. It presents an example of a temple square typical of traditional [[Newar]] urban planning. Streets radiate out from the square, and inconspicuous entryways lead to residential courtyards that are home to silversmiths and other craftsmen.

==Highlights==

The square is dominated by the massive pagoda roofs of Maru Satah (मरु सत:) ([[Kasthamandap]]) which stands on the northern side of the square. Built in the 12th century, it houses a shrine of [[Gorakhnath]]. It was erected as a shelter for travellers on the trade route, and assumed its present shape in the 17th century. The name Kathmandu is derived from Kasthamandap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/photocoll/s/019pho000430s52u00008000.html | title = Street scene, Khatmandu 430528| work = | publisher = British Library | date=| accessdate = 26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Majupuria, Trilok Chandra and Kumar, Rohit (1993).

On the eastern side stands Dhansā Degah (धन्सा देग:) (alternative name: Dhunsar), a 17th-century pagoda-shaped building.

Gakuti (गकुति) is a three-sided courtyard on the western side of Maru. There is a temple dedicated to [[Shiva|Mahadev]] at the center.

Lakhu Phalechā (लखु फलेचा), a roadside shelter at the corner of an alley at the southwest of Maru, is linked with the founding of [[Nepal Sambat]]. This is where the porters from [[Bhaktapur]] are said to have rested with their loads of sand. The procession of the goddess Dāgin, which is held during the [[Yenya]] festival, starts from this house.

The temple of Maru Ganeshya (मरु गनेद्य:) on the northern side of Maru Sata is one of the more important [[Ganesh]] shrines in Kathmandu. A notable feature of this temple is the absence of the usual pinnacle.

Maruhiti (मरुहिति) is a celebrated stone water spout on an alley at the northwest of Maru. The alley was once famed by its nickname Pie Alley for the many pie shops here during the [[hippie]] days of the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.lonelyplanet.com/nepal/kathmandu/sights/other/maru-tole | title = Maru Tole | work = | publisher = Lonely Planet| date=| accessdate = 25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Menaceur''' is a small town and commune in [[Algeria]], situated about 100 km west of [[Algiers]]. Menaceur has a population of 40,000. The [[Bouchanoun River]] passes through Menaceur. Nearby mountains include Zabrir, el Pic, Boumaad, and Tizi Franco. 

==History==
Menaceur is known for its fight against French colonization. Tizi Franco, where French troops were ambushed in 1957, deeply influenced French army tactics in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lesoirdalgerie.com/articles/2006/01/09/article.php?sid=32915&amp;cid=23 Le soir d\Algerie, 1er Septembre BENI MENACEUR RESISTANCE OF 1871]&lt;/ref&gt;


1 - Introduction

Following the example of resistance, popular uprisings and revolts that marked the nineteenth century and encompassed various parts of Algeria, the resistance of Beni Menaceur, Miliana and Cherchell between July 14 and August 21, 1871 was the One of the links in the chain revolts. Like all revolutions that preceded it, it was underpinned by the causes and circumstances which, although they were mostly particular, remain virtually unchanged. 2 - Because of the resistance of Beni Menaceur Among the main reasons that prompted the outbreak of the revolt, is the policy of colonialism french based on injustice, oppression, repression and the plundering of private and public property, along with the adoption by the French authorities of the policy of "divide and conquer" in an attempt to reconcile the benevolence of some families which it entrusted the mission to look after its interests at the expense of the majority of residents. In this region, the colonial authorities were able to create from scratch a conflict between two Algerian families: on the one hand that of Brahim Sa'îd ibn Mohammed El Ghobrini, which was one of the families from the outset collaborated with the authorities Tenure and taken up arms against the Titteri Bey and the Bey Boumezrag and another family of El Berkani whose stronghold was located Miliana and which was headed by Sheikh al Malek ibn al Berkani Sahraoui, nephew Mohammed Ben Aissa el Berkani, khalifa (*) The Emir Abdelkader in Titteri. Following France's policy, the two families went down in a bloody conflict all that the family commissioned an El Berkani eastern part of Beni Menaceur, something that El Ghobrini the family did not accept. To this should be added the suffering of the people of Cherchell Miliana and as a result of the colonial policy based on the forced collection of taxes, which drain resources and damage to their most sacred values in matters of religion. 3 - Steps resistance Beni Ménaceur The first spark of resistance springs on April 30, 1871 when the colonial authorities undertook to provoke the people by ordering gang bosses that they were subjected to collect the taxes without taking into account the tragic conditions of the inhabitants. Residents expressed their refusal by hunting with stones agents of colonialism. -- 1 - First step: The chouyouks (*) of Beni Menaceur found it necessary to hold an extraordinary meeting to discuss the social and economic situation in the region arising from the French policy. On May 6, 1871 was the date fixed for the meeting to kubba (*) of the saint Sidi Ahmed Benyoucef, near the region of Souk el Had.

The meeting s'achev on the decision, as a first step, to assassinate gang bosses allied to France. All present agreed on the need to eliminate El Mouloud El Habbouchi, regarded as the man in the hand of France in the region. However, France, rightly fearing the reaction of people worked to get his resignation and he was replaced on 20 May 187, by Mohammed Said El Ghobrini, which was on the list of people to be slaughtered and prepared by the participants of the meeting , May 6, 1871. The designation of the latter provoked discontent and anger of the people whose chouyoukhs met again on 28 and 29 June 1871 for agreeing to assassinate Said El Ghobrini. However, the chairman of the bureau Arabic, Mr VARLOUD, prevented this by the appointment of a new caïd, namely Mouloud El Ben Abidi, who was also rejected because he did not belong to the region of Beni Menasra . But the Governor General De Gueydon maintained his decision to appoint Ben El Mouloud, which ratcheted up the discontent of the people against this policy.

-2 - The second stage

Lassés of politics Governor General De Gueydon, residents of Beni Menaceur decided to move to the crucial stage of the battle, July 13, 1871. The starting point was the region Théniet el Had, and the movement spread to the villages and causing dechras popular support. Ben Abidi and Mouloud El Said El Ghobrini quickly to inform the colonial authorities of this popular movement and what happened at the meeting at which the decision was taken revolutionary. This enabled the French authorities to take measures to cope with the events.

-3 - Third stage

It was imperative for the elders and chouyoukhs of Beni Menaceur to take steps as soon as possible in order not to lose the leadership of the business and provide an opportunity for the occupation authorities to nip in the bud the revolt. To this end, it was agreed to appoint Sheikh Malek El Berkani, as leader after the betrayal of El Ghobrini and Ben Mouloud El was proved. The title of agha fighters he was awarded and the troops were divided into three groups:

-- The main group headed by Malek El Berkani, assisted by his brother and Brahim Mustapha ibn Mohammed Oudjelloul Abdelmalek and was given the task to head on Cherchell, headquarters of the occupation authority and the attack.

-- A second group, called Beni Menaceur East, the command was given to Oukerjouj Ali ibn Ahmed, a friend of El Berkani and that was one of the prominent leaders of the revolt, was instructed to head for the region Zourikh .
-- A third group, called Blessed Ménaceur West whose command was given to Ahmed Ouddadi, attended by heads of douars and dechras and was to head for the region Noufi. This step was also characterized by the letters sent by El Berkani Malek, head of the revolt, in many areas, to encourage them to undertake the holy war against infidels. He obtained and the rallying of Kaddour Ben El Moubarek of Koléa and Abdelkader Ben El Mokhtar of Miliana, two strong personalities whose rallying gave a new impetus to revolt, and allowed the fighters to carry out numerous attacks against the enemy and its allies July 17, 1871. Indeed, they faced a troupe led military VARLOUD Captain in the region of Noufi. From there, they headed towards Hadjout, burned the hotel Hammam Righa and killed many french. Faced with the growing phenomenon of revolts and their intensification, the French authorities were forced to send additional troops to Koléa under the command of Colonel DESANDRE. However, these reinforcements n'entamèrent not the determination of fighters led by El Berkani since managed to extend the revolt in the region of Hadjout, coming to the ends of the Capital. During this stage, the revolt recorded many victories against the French and their allies. So on July 23, a number of settlers were killed and burned their factories including a mill and oil, along with fires farms settlers and their plantations erected at the expense of local residents. The day of July 25, 1871 was characterized by attacks by fighters against the troops. This day also took place at the Battle of Bellagh Oued, near Mount Chenoua, at the end of which the combatants were victorious, and they managed to cut water supply to the City of Cherchell and burn some farms of settlers whose firm Nicolas.
4 - Consequences of Resistance of Beni Menaceur

The French authorities acquired the conviction that to deal with this uprising, intensified its military presence was necessary. To this end, order was given to its land and sea forces attacking hotbeds of revolt. They came so Miliana, Algiers and Béjaïa under the command of the officer PONSARK. In addition, the French troops led by the officer BOUSQUET, and supported by the escort LAVISO-KLEBER and did DESAX route to the affected areas. From this imbalance in the balance of power, it resulted: -- The death on the field of honour of the leader Malek El Berkani on 02 August 1871 during a battle near the region Zourikh. -- The destruction of the zaouia El Berkani at Miliana. -- The succession of his brother Ibrahim at the head of the revolt he continued committing several battles between 19 and August 20. -- The surrender of the latter on August 21, 1871, which put an end to the revolt. -- The families of the rebels were subjected to severe penalties, including the confiscation of their land, the destruction of their homes, the burning of their property and judgement of many of them by the courts martial and their sentences ranging from life imprisonment with forced labor and deportation.

'''Metropolitan France''' ({{lang-fr|France métropolitaine}} or ''la Métropole''), also known as '''European France''' or '''Mainland France''', is the part of [[France]] in [[Europe]]. It comprises mainland France and nearby [[island|islands]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[English Channel]] ({{lang-fr|la Manche}}), and the [[Mediterranean Sea]], including [[Corsica]]. 

[[Overseas France]] (''la France d'outre-mer'', or ''l'Outre-mer'', or colloquially ''les DOM-TOM'') is the collective name for the part of France outside Europe: French [[overseas region|overseas regions]] (''départements et régions d'outre-mer'' or ''DROM''),&lt;ref&gt;Since 2003, the constitutional term for an overseas department is [[overseas region]] (French: ''région d'outre-mer'').&lt;/ref&gt; [[Overseas territory (France)|territories]] (''territoires d'outre-mer'' or ''TOM''), [[overseas collectivity|collectivities]] (''collectivités d'outre-mer'' or ''COM''), and the [[French overseas departments and territories|sui generis collectivity]] (''collectivité sui generis'') of [[New Caledonia]].

Metropolitan France and [[Overseas France]] together form the [[France|French Republic]]. Metropolitan France accounts for 82.0% of the land territory, 3.3% of the [[exclusive economic zone]] (EEZ), and 95.9% of the population of the [[France|French Republic]].

The five [[overseas region]]s ([[overseas department|departments]])—[[Martinique]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Réunion]], [[French Guiana]], and [[Mayotte]]—have the same political status as metropolitan France's regions. Metropolitan France and these five overseas regions together are sometimes called ''la France entière'' ("the whole of France") by the French administration. But this ''France entière'' does not include the French overseas collectivities and territories that have more autonomy than do the overseas departments.

In overseas France, a person from metropolitan France is often called a ''métro,'' short for ''métropolitain''.

==Etymology==
The term "metropolitan France" dates from the country's [[colony|colonial]] period (from the 16th to the 20th century), when France was referred to as ''la Métropole'' (literally "the Metropolis"), as distinguished from its colonies and protectorates, known as ''les colonies'' or ''l'Empire''. Similar terms existed to describe other European colonial powers (e.g. "metropolitan Britain", "España metropolitana"). This application of the words "metropolis" and "metropolitan" came from [[Ancient Greek]] "[[metropolis]]" (from μήτηρ ''mētēr'' "mother" and πόλις ''pólis'' "city, town"), which was the name for a city-state that created colonies across the Mediterranean (e.g. [[Marseille]] was a colony of the city-state of [[Phocaea]]; therefore Phocaea was the "metropolis" of Marseille). By extension "metropolis" and "metropolitan" came to mean "motherland", a nation or country as opposed to its colonies overseas.

Today, some people in [[overseas France]] object to the use of the term ''la France métropolitaine'' due to its colonial history. They prefer to call it "the European territory of France" ('''le territoire européen de la France'''), as the [[Treaties of the European Union]] do. Likewise, they oppose treating overseas France and metropolitan France as separate entities. For example, [[INSEE]] used to calculate its statistics (demography, economy, etc.) for metropolitan France only, and to analyze separate statistics for the overseas departments and territories. People in the overseas departments have opposed this separate treatment, arguing that the then four overseas departments were fully part of France. 

As a result, since the end of the 1990s INSEE has included the four overseas departments in its figures for France (such as total population or GDP). The fifth overseas department, [[Mayotte]], has been included in the figures for France since the mid-2010s too. INSEE refers to metropolitan France and the five overseas departments as ''la France entière'' ("the whole of France"). "The whole of France" includes the five overseas departments, but does not include the other overseas collectivities and territories that have more autonomy than the departments. Other branches of the French administration may have different definitions of what ''la France entière'' is. For example, in contrast to INSEE, when the [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Ministry of the Interior]] releases election results, they use the term ''la France entière'' to refer to the entire French Republic, including all of overseas France, and not just the five overseas departments.

Note that since INSEE now calculates statistics for ''la France entière'', this practice has spread to international institutions. For instance, the French GDP published by the [[World Bank]] includes metropolitan France and the five overseas departments. The World Bank refers to this total as "France"; it does not use the phrase "the whole of France", as INSEE does.

==Statistics==
Metropolitan France covers a land area of 543,940&amp;nbsp;km² (210,016 sq. miles),{{efn|French [[Land registration|Land Register]] data, which exclude lakes, ponds and [[glacier]]s larger than 1&amp;nbsp;km² (0.386&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi or 247&amp;nbsp;acres) as well as the estuaries of rivers. French [[Institut Géographique National|National Geographic Institute]] data, which includes bodies of water, gives a value of {{convert|551695|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} for the land area of Metropolitan France.}} while [[overseas France]] covers a land area of 119,396&amp;nbsp;km² (46,099 sq. miles),&lt;ref name=French_Republic&gt;Land area of the 4 old overseas departments ([https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/2864136#consulter]), Mayotte, the overseas collectivities, and New Caledonia ([https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/fichier/2045658/my_oldcol_01.pdf page 21]), the French Southern and Antarctic Lands and the Scattered Islands ([http://observatoire-outre-mer.interieur.gouv.fr/site/layout/set/print/content/download/166/1067/file/Tdb_TAAF_Novembre17.pdf]), and Clipperton ([http://agriculture.gouv.fr/telecharger/44764?token=428075c480768259a6a7d05a971137ea]).&lt;/ref&gt; for a total of 663,336&amp;nbsp;km² (256,115 sq. miles) in the French Republic (excluding [[Adélie Land]] in [[Antarctica]] where sovereignty is suspended since the signing of the [[Antarctic Treaty]] in 1959). Thus, metropolitan France accounts for 82.0% of the French Republic's land territory.

At sea, the [[exclusive economic zone]] (EEZ) of metropolitan France covers {{convert|333691|km2|abbr=on}}, while the EEZ of [[overseas France]] covers {{convert|9825538|km2|abbr=on}}, for a total of {{convert|10159229|km2|abbr=on}} in the French Republic (excluding Adélie Land).&lt;ref name="searoundus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seaaroundus.org/data/#/eez.aspx |title=Sea Around Us – Fisheries, Ecosystems and Biodiversity |publisher= |accessdate=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, metropolitan France accounts for 3.3% of the French Republic's EEZ.

According to [[INSEE]], 65,018,000 people lived in metropolitan France as of January 2018, while 2,790,000 lived in overseas France, for a total of 67,808,000 inhabitants in the French Republic.&lt;ref name="French_Republic_2"&gt;Population of Metropolitan France: [https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/1893198]. The population of all five overseas departments totaled 2,169,000 [https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/1893198] in January 2018. The population of the overseas collectivities amounted to 621,000 inhabitants (Saint-Pierre and Miquelon [https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/3545753?sommaire=3292701], Saint-Barthélemy [https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/3545753?sommaire=3292701], Saint-Martin [https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/3545753?sommaire=3292701], French Polynesia [https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/2122700], Wallis et Futuna [https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/2121453], New Caledonia [http://www.isee.nc/population/demographie]). The total population of the overseas departments and territories of France is estimated at 2,790,000.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, metropolitan France accounts for 95.9% of the French Republic's population.

In the second round of the [[French presidential election, 2017|2017 French presidential election]], 35,467,327 French people cast a ballot (meaning a [[Voter turnout|turnout]] of 74.56%). 33,883,463 of these (95.53% of the total voters) cast their ballots in metropolitan France (turnout: 76.26%), 1,003,910 (2.83% of the total voters) cast their ballots in overseas France (turnout: 53.59%), and 579,954 (1.64% of the total voters) cast their ballots in foreign countries (French people living abroad; turnout: 45.84%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Elections/Les-resultats/Presidentielles/elecresult__presidentielle-2017/(path)/presidentielle-2017/index.html | title=Résultats de l'élection présidentielle 2017| first=[[Cabinet of France|Government of France]]| last=[[Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]]| accessdate=2018-06-20| language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Assembly of France|French National Assembly]] is made up of 577 deputies, 539 of whom (93.4% of the total) are elected in metropolitan France, 27 (4.7% of the total) in overseas France, and 11 (1.9% of the total) by French citizens living in foreign countries.

==Mainland France==
[[File:Hexagone.png|thumb|''l'Hexagone'' illustrated by overlaying the outline of mainland France with the hexagon on the 1988 Charles de Gaulle commemorative [[French franc|1 franc]] coin. The sides of the hexagon are: 1. the [[English Channel|Channel]] coast, 2. the [[Atlantic]] coast, 3. the [[Pyrenees]] (border with [[Spain]]), 4. the [[Mediterranean]] coast, 5. the eastern border ([[French Alps|Alps]], [[Jura mountains|Jura]] and [[Upper Rhine]]; [[Monaco]] to [[Karlsruhe]]), and 6. the northeastern border (German Rhineland and Belgium; Karlsruhe to [[Dunkirk]]).]]

Mainland France (French: ''la France continentale''), or just "the mainland" (French: ''le continent''), does not include the French islands in the Atlantic Ocean, English Channel or Mediterranean Sea, the largest of which is Corsica.

In Corsica, people from the mainland part of Metropolitan France are referred to as ''les continentaux''.

A casual synonym for the mainland part of Metropolitan France is ''l'Hexagone'' ("the [[Hexagon]]"), for its approximate shape, and the adjective ''hexagonal'' may be a casual synonym of French (usually understood as metropolitan only, except in topics related to the foreign affairs and national politics of France as a whole).

==Description==
Mill ponds were often created through the construction of a [[mill dam]] or [[weir]] (and mill stream) across a [[waterway]].
 
In many places, the common proper name Mill Pond has remained even though the mill has long since gone. It may be fed by a man-made stream,&lt;ref name="DicDef3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Mill%20pond|accessdate=7 September 2013

The channel or stream leading from the mill pond is the [[mill race]], which together with weirs, dams, channels and the terrain establishing the mill pond, is the power producing purpose of the civil engineering hydraulic system.

The term mill pond is often used colloquially and in literature to refer to a very flat body of water.&lt;ref name="DicDef2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Mill%20pond|accessdate=7 September 2013

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3738">The '''Northland temperate kauri forests''' [[ecoregion]], within the [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]] [[biome]], is in northern [[New Zealand]].

==Location and description==
This ecoregion covers the northern end of [[North Island]]. The landscape is flat when compared with most of New Zealand and includes the regions of [[Northland Region|Northland]], [[Auckland Region|Auckland]] around the city of [[Auckland]] and [[Waikato Region|Waikato]] around the town of [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]]. Kauri trees are found north of 38°S. The region also includes a number of offshore islands and some of New Zealand's few remaining original wetland habitats such as the [[Firth of Thames]], and the [[Kopuatai Peat Dome]] and the Whangamarino swamp in the [[Hauraki Plains]]. The climate is warm and humid.

==Flora==
This area is home to a number of endemic plants especially in regions of Northland such as [[Cape Reinga]] and [[Te Paki]] which have at times been cut off from the rest of the island by high sea levels. The ecoregion is named for its most notable endemic species, the impressive [[Agathis australis|southern kauri]] trees, which can grow to 55m high and 20m round and has no lower branches but a long trunk of up to 30m and a wide crown. There are few areas still thickly covered by the kauri forest that once dominated this whole area, but the trees are so huge that they are the most noticeable feature even in woodland where they are present in small numbers. Much of the kauri forest has been cleared for timber and the land converted to agriculture. This region is the southernmost habitat of the kauri and also [[mangrove]]s. There are more endemic species on the offshore islands such as the [[Poor Knights Islands]] and [[Three Kings Islands]], which are home to rare plants including the only species of ''[[Elingamita]]'' and others such as ''[[Pennantia baylisiana]]'' and [[Tecomanthe speciosa|Three Kings vine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=aa0406|name=Northland temperate kauri forests}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fauna==
The forests are home to a number of rare birds including the endangered [[North Island kokako]] wattlebird, the [[North Island brown kiwi]], and three endemic parrots [[red-crowned parakeet]], the [[New Zealand kaka]] and the [[kakapo]], the last of which now only survives on the offshore [[Little Barrier Island]]. Invertebrates found in the region include the large [[weta]]s and [[cave weta]]s.

==Threats and preservation==
This fertile area has long been the most populous part of New Zealand and the original kauri forest has mostly been removed. The logging and gum-tapping that caused this has stopped now and much of the remaining kauri forest is now protected in the Northland region and on the [[Coromandel Peninsula]]. The largest stands of kauri are found in [[Waipoua Forest]] with another large area in [[Trounson Kauri Park]] south of [[Aranga, New Zealand|Aranga]], both areas are on the west coast of Northland.

Wildlife in the region is vulnerable to introduced predators such as the [[Polynesian rat]], [[ferret]]s and [[stoat]]s to the extent that the strongest remaining populations of many plants, birds and reptiles are on offshore islands rather than North Island itself. Some North Island species have been introduced to the offshore as a preservation measure, while other species found there are indigenous to the small islands, including a number of lizards on the [[Mercury Islands]] and the [[Falla's skink]] on the Three Kings Islands.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5119">The '''Politics of [[Guangdong]]''' follows a dual party-government system like the rest of China's provinces.  Guangdong is known for a surge of legislative activism in recent years, often called the Guangdong Phenomenon (''Guangdong Xianxiang''). The Guangdong Provincial People's Congress has enacted measures to increase democracy and transparency, and exert more control over the financial sector. In a well-publicized case in 2000, the Guangdong PPC also harshly criticized the Environmental Protection Bureau for allowing the construction of an electroplating park without a proper environmental impact investigation.&lt;ref name='Leviathan'&gt;{{cite book | last = Yang | first = Dali | authorlink = Dali Yang | coauthors = | title = Remaking the Chinese Leviathan: Market Transition and the Politics of Governance in China | publisher = Stanford University Press | date = 2004 | location = Stanford, California | pages = 273–274 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-8047-5493-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Afghanistan}}
The '''[[Prime Minister]] of [[Afghanistan]]''' was a post in the [[Politics of Afghanistan|Afghan government]]. The position was created in 1927 as an official appointed by the [[List of heads of state of Afghanistan#Royal heads of state|King of Afghanistan]]. The holder served mostly as an advisor, until the end of the [[Kingdom of Afghanistan]] in 1973. During the 1980s, the position was the [[head of government]].

==History of the office==
===Kingdom===
{{Main|Kingdom of Afghanistan}}
The '''Chairman of the Council of Ministers''' was not headed by the Prime Minister, but the King. Only during his absence was the Premier the acting Chairman of the Council. 

Until 1963, King [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] appointed his relatives as prime ministers. King Zahir Shah also had the power to dismiss or transfer the Prime Minister.

This was changed, stating that the Head of the Afghan Government was the Prime Minister, and that the government consisted of its ministers. It was the first time that King Zahir Shah did not play an important role in the government, leaving it to an elected authority. However, it also stated that they cannot engage in any other profession during their tenure of office.

The [[1964 Constitution of Afghanistan|1964 Constitution]] also granted the Prime Minister the power to summon the '''Electoral College''' in case of the death of the King. The Prime Minister only answered to the [[Wolesi Jirga]] about the ''General Policy'' of the government, and individually for their prescribed duties.&lt;ref name=cs&gt;{{Country study|country=Afghanistan|abbr=af|editor=Peter R. Blood|date=1997|section=The Constitutional Period, 1964-73|author=Richard S. Newell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic Republic===
{{Main|Democratic Republic of Afghanistan}}
In April 1978, [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] was killed during a coup that started the ''[[Saur Revolution]]''. The [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA) revived the office of Prime Minister that year, and it remained throughout the 1980s. 

The President was in charge of the appointment of the Prime Minister, who in turn appointed the [[Council of Ministers (Afghanistan)|Council of Ministers]]. The Council's stated purpose was to formulate and implement domestic and foreign policies, to formulate economic development plans and state budgets, and to ensure public order.

Under the 1987 Constitution, the President was required to appoint the Prime Minister in order to form the Government. The Prime Minister had the power to dissolve the government. Several Afghan presidents during the Democratic Republic era were also appointed as Prime Minister. With the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], the Prime Minister was no longer in charge of the government. The General Secretary of the PDPA or the Director of the [[KHAD]] exercised greater power.

Also, the 1990 Constitution established that only Afghan-born citizens are eligible to hold the office, something that was not specified in the previous documents.

===Islamic State/Emirate===
{{Main|Islamic State of Afghanistan|Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan}}
After the collapse of [[Mohammad Najibullah]]'s government, a transitional state was created. Thus, the office of '''Prime Minister''' once again played an important role in the history of the nation. 

There was constant friction between the President and the Premier during this period. The State had collapsed and there was not an effective central Government from 1992 until 1996. Thus, the position became ''de facto'' ceremonial, with little power in what was left of the Government.

The title was abolished when the [[Taliban]] forces of the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]] took over control in 1996. The Deputy Leader of the Taliban was often known as the Prime Minister throughout its rule. With the death of [[Mohammad Rabbani]] in 2001,&lt;ref name=nytimes01&gt;{{cite news|last=Dugger|first=Celia W.|title=Muhammad Rabbani, Advocate of Some Moderation in Taliban|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/20/world/muhammad-rabbani-advocate-of-some-moderation-in-taliban.html|accessdate=29 September 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=20 April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Taliban decided not to revive the office. 

Until August 1997, the government which the Taliban had ousted, which remained in rebellion until the end of the Taliban rule in 2001, had a Prime Minister in the government, but the position was abolished.

The '''Rainbow Bridge''' is the theme of several works of poetry written in the 1980s and 1990s that speak of an other-worldly place where [[pet]]s go upon death, eventually to be reunited with their owners. One is a [[prose poetry|prose poem]] whose original creator is uncertain. The other is a six-stanza poem of rhyming pentameter couplets, created by a couple to help ease the pain of friends who lost pets. Each has gained popularity around the world among animal lovers who have [[pet loss|lost a pet]]. The belief has many antecedents, including similarities to the [[Bifröst]] bridge of [[Norse mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rohrer |first=Finlo |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8454288.stm |title=How much can you mourn a pet? |publisher=BBC News |date=13 January 2010 |access-date=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Story ==

The story tells of a lush green [[meadow]] just "this side of [[Heaven]]" (i.e. before one enters into it). Rainbow Bridge is the name of both the meadow and the adjoining pan-prismatic conveyance connecting it to Heaven.

According to the story, when a pet dies, it goes to the meadow, restored to perfect health and free of any injuries. The pet runs and plays all day with the others; there is always fresh food and water, and the sun is always shining. However, it is said that while the pet is at peace and happy, they also miss their owner whom they left behind on Earth.

When their owner dies, they too arrive at the meadow, and that is when the pet stops playing, turns, sniffs at the air and looks into the distance where they see their beloved owner. Excited, they run as fast as they can until they are one jump away from their owner's arms. The pet licks its owners in joy while the human looks into the soft eyes of their pet—who might have been absent on Earth, but never absent in their heart. Then side by side, they cross the Rainbow Bridge together into Heaven, never again to be separated.

== Authorship ==

Having been circulated widely around the world, the prose poem's original authorship is uncertain. [[About.com]] suggests three presently known contenders to the development of the prose poem:
* Paul C. Dahm, a grief counselor in [[Oregon]], US, said to have written the poem in 1981 and published it in a 1998 book of the same name (1981, {{ISBN|0-9663022-0-6}}).
* William N. Britton, author of ''Legend of Rainbow Bridge'' (1994, {{ISBN|0-9645018-0-5}})
* Wallace Sife, head of the Association for Pet Loss and Bereavement, whose poem ''All Pets Go to Heaven'' appears on the association's website as well as in his book ''The Loss of a Pet''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cats.about.com/od/lossandgrieving/a/rainbowbridge.htm cats.about.com, Rainbow Bridge]&lt;/ref&gt;

The genesis of the rhyming poem is  straightforward: spouses Diane and Steve Bodofsky operated a ferret rescue&lt;ref&gt;[http://newrainbowbridge.com The Last Chance Ferret Rescue]&lt;/ref&gt; that specialized in gravely ill animals and had many friends whose loss of pets were acutely painful; they wrote the poem for them. But when a local veterinarian asked if they could make it the basis of sympathy cards he might send to his patients, the poem gained popularity. The internet widened the restorative power of the poem internationally.

== Background ==

The concept of a paradise where pets wait for their human owners appeared much earlier, in the little-known sequel to ''[[Beautiful Joe]]'', the [[Margaret Marshall Saunders]]' book, ''Beautiful Joe's Paradise''.  In this green land, the animals do not simply await their owners, but also help each other learn and grow and recover from mistreatment they may have endured in life.  But the animals come to this land, and continue to true heaven, not by a bridge but by balloon.

The first mention of the "Rainbow Bridge" story on the internet is a post on the [[newsgroup]] ''rec.pets.dogs'', dated 7 January 1993, quoting the poem from a 1992 (or earlier) issue of "Mid-Atlantic Great Dane Rescue League Newsletter", which in turn is stated to have quoted it from the Akita Rescue Society of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rainbow Bridge (Was: Pets passing away. |url=http://groups.google.com/group/rec.pets.dogs/browse_thread/thread/296f9182afe238a0/368bccee5dd282fd?lnk=st&amp;q=%22cross+the+rainbow+bridge%22&amp;rnum=13&amp;hl=en#368bccee5dd282fd |access-date=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other posts from 1993 suggest it was already well established and being circulated on the Internet at that time, enough for the quotation of even a single line to be expected to be recognized by other newsgroup readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Breeder – Lifelong Responsibility |url=http://groups.google.com/group/rec.pets.dogs/browse_thread/thread/ad01fbda620bb6f4/3b24ad2002e3e12b?lnk=st&amp;q=%22cross+the+rainbow+bridge%22&amp;rnum=6&amp;hl=en#3b24ad2002e3e12b |access-date=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''side valley''' and a '''tributary valley''' are [[valleys]] whose brook or [[river]] [[Confluence|flows into]] a greater one.

Upstream, the valleys can be [[Categorization|classified]] in an increasing order which is equivalent to the usual [[orographic order]]: the tributaries are ordered from those nearest to the [[source (river or stream)|source of the river]] to those nearest to the [[River delta|mouth of the river]]. A [[confluence]] is where two or more tributaries or rivers flow together.

==Orographic order (e.g. Humber)==
In the [[orographic]] classification ([[order of rivers]]) the [[tributary]] river has order ''n+1'', if ''n'' describes the primary (or main) river. A river which flows directly into the [[ocean]] (e.g. the English rivers Thames or [[Humber]]) has the orographic order n=1, the [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|River Ouse]] n=2, the [[River Wharfe|Wharfe]] n=3 and so on.

==Basic facts of geomorphology==
However, the term "side valley" is used rather for ''higher order valleys'' near the mountains (example above: the [[Pennines]]), for the lower valleys often do not show a drastic relief. The reason is a simple one: The "[[main stem|mainstem river]]" (into which the secondary river flows) passes much more water than its tributaries and therefore

* has a lower current (see [[Hydrology]])
* much more fine [[sediment]]s
* which are [[Deposition (sediment)|deposed]] in a more flat matter.

The higher the order of a valley, the steeper usually are the [[hill]]sides resp. [[hill|valley slope]]s. Looking upstream, the steepest slopes are normally near the source of a brook (with the exception of very hard rocks in downstream direction).

===Hanging valleys===
The [[estuary]] of broad rivers lies rather in flat regions (river flats) than of rivers in higher elevation. Therefore, the [[stream gradient]] of the tributary near its [[mouth]] is small (e.g. 1 m per km), but much more at waters of higher order (in the [[Alps]] up to 100 m per km). This is one reason for the large number of [[hanging valley]]s in some mountain ranges (e.g. [[Salzburg]] or [[Graubünden]]).

The others are glaciologic or geologic reasons:

* The huge [[glacier]]s of the [[ice age]] caused a major [[erosion]] which resulted in many [[Valley|U-shaped]] "glacial valleys", especially in altitudes of 400–800 m which is typical for alpine main valleys.
* At the place where the tributary flew into the river before the glacial period, there is now a [[valley shoulder]]. The side valley has to lose a lot of its height and is developing into a hanging valley.
* In permeable rock like [[limestone]]) the side-valley will become a [[gorge]].
* In [[granite]] or other crystalline areas a [[waterfall]] may be the result.

All these stages of valley genesis can be seen in higher mountain ranges - e.g. in the "young" [[Rocky Mountains]], in the "old" ranges and [[fjord]]s of [[Scandinavia]], or in the Eastern Alps ([[Salzach]] or [[Inn (river)|Inn]] valley).

==Shape of side valleys==
[[Image:Rocamadour - village 3.jpg|thumb|At [[Rocamadour]] (Lot, France) the traditional village clings to the slope, leaving the valley floor for agriculture]]
Whereas the valleys near the ''[[river flats]]'' don't have special forms, the shape of ''alpine'' valleys depends much more from the former glaciology and of the [[rock type]].

Like the main valleys described above, the side- or secondary valley can be V-shaped or U-shaped. Also the [[valley floor]] varies - from just a few meters up to some 100 m (e.g. [[Bad Gastein]] or [[St. Moritz]], where small towns have been developed instead of 1000 or 1500 m altitude.

Some valleys are stepped in longitudinal direction (German "Talstufe") which means that these zones show a quicker [[current (stream)|current]] than in average. Therefore, the brook will dig its own narrow canal, and the eroded sediments are deposed at the end of each clammy, forming a series of local [[plain]]s. They are an important basis of traditional [[mountain farmer|mountain farming]] because of excellent places for alpine [[agriculture]] or [[pasture]]s.

==Miscellaneous==
[[Orography]]: The descriptive terms ''right'' or ''left'' side-valley (resp. tributary) always apply from the perspective of looking [[Source (river or stream)|downstream]] (in the direction the [[current (stream)|current]] is going).

[[Sandbanks]] often occur at reaches with ''slow'' current, especially near the [[river bank]]s. Studying the various rock types of the [[gravel]] is an excellent and cheap [[geological survey|survey]] for a summarized [[geology]] of the rivers [[drainage basin|watershed]] (catchment area).

At most valley forks or stream [[confluence]]s it is clear which stream is the main river and which is the tributary - as one stream is both much longer and carrying clearly more water than the other. It can, however, happen that one stream is longer, but the other carries more water. This case has no fixed rules to decide. Usually the ''longer valley'' is chosen as the main valley.

But in lowlands the decision may be arbitrary: in [[Switzerland]] the long Alpine [[Rhine]] is chosen as the main stream, although the [[Aar]] carries more water for her huge midland area. &lt;br&gt;
In the case of the [[Mississippi River]] (which carries more water) and [[Missouri River]] (which is much longer) the choice is made according to the opposite criterion.

'''Sky islands''' are isolated mountains surrounded by radically different lowland environments. The term originally referred to those found near the southern borders of Arizona and New Mexico, and has extended to similarly isolated high-altitude forests. The isolation has significant implications for these natural habitats. The [[American Southwest]] region began warming up between ∼20,000–10,000&amp;nbsp;years BP and atmospheric temperatures increased substantially, resulting in the formation of vast deserts that isolated the Sky Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Favé |first=M., Johnson |date=2015 |title=Past climate change on Sky Islands drives novelty in a core developmental gene network and its phenotype |url=http://fh6xn3yd3x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fsummon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Past+climate+change+on+Sky+Islands+drives+novelty+in+a+core+developmental+gene+network+and+its+phenotype&amp;rft.jtitle=BMC+evolutionary+biology&amp;rft.au=Fav%C3%A9%2C+Marie-Julie&amp;rft.au=Johnson%2C+Robert+A&amp;rft.au=Cover%2C+Stefan&amp;rft.au=Handschuh%2C+Stephan&amp;rft.date=2015&amp;rft.eissn=1471-2148&amp;rft.volume=15&amp;rft.spage=183&amp;rft_id=info%3Apmid%2F26338531&amp;rft.externalDocID=26338531&amp;paramdict=en-US |journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology |volume=15 |page=2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Endemism]], [[altitudinal migration]], and [[relict]] populations are some of the natural phenomena to be found on sky islands.

The complex dynamics of [[species richness]] on sky islands draws attention from the discipline of [[biogeography]], and likewise the [[biodiversity]] is of concern to [[conservation biology]]. One of the key elements of a sky island is separation by physical distance from the other mountain ranges, resulting in a habitat island, such as a forest surrounded by desert.

Some sky islands serve as [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]] for boreal species stranded by warming climates since the [[last glacial period]]. In other cases, localized populations of plants and animals tend towards [[speciation]], similar to oceanic islands such as the [[Galápagos Islands]] of [[Ecuador]].

==Origin of the term==
The sky island concept originated in 1943 when Natt N. Dodge, in an article in ''Arizona Highways'' magazine, referred to the [[Chiricahua Mountains]] in southeastern Arizona as a "mountain island in a desert sea".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In about the same era, the term was used to refer to high alpine, unglaciated, ancient topographic landform surfaces on the crest of the Sierra Nevada, California.

The term was popularized by nature writer Weldon Heald, a resident of southeastern Arizona. In his 1967 book, ''Sky Island'', he demonstrated the concept by describing a drive from the town of [[Rodeo, New Mexico]], in the western [[Chihuahuan desert]], to a peak in the Chiricahua Mountains, {{convert|35|miles|km|0|abbr=off|order=flip}} away and {{convert|5600|ft|m|abbr=off|order=flip}} higher in elevation. Ascending from the hot, arid desert, to grasslands, then to oak-pine woodland, pine forest, and finally to spruce-fir-aspen forest. His book mentions the concept of [[biome]], but prefers the terminology of [[life zone]]s, and makes reference to the work of [[Clinton Hart Merriam]]. The book also describes the wildlife and living conditions of the Chiricahuas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Characteristics==
The [[Madrean sky islands]] are probably the most studied sky islands in the world. Found in the U.S. states of [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]] and the Mexican states of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] and [[Sonora]], these numerous mountains form links in a chain connecting the northern end of the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] and the southern [[Colorado Plateau]]. Sky Islands of the central and northern mountains in the United States are often called [[island range]]s, especially by populations within view of such islands of mountains surrounded by plains such as those found within the [[Wichita Mountains]] of [[southwestern Oklahoma]].

[[File:Catalina Mountains elev7000.JPG|thumb|left|View from above {{convert|7000|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} in the [[Santa Catalina Mountains]], showing pines and snow in the foreground and desert beyond]]
Some more northerly examples are the [[Crazy Mountains]], [[Castle Mountains (Montana)|Castle Mountains]], [[Bears Paw Mountains]], [[Highwood Mountains]], and [[Little Rocky Mountains]], all in the US state of [[Montana]].  Each of these ranges is forested and has tundra and snowpack above treeline, but is not connected to any other range by forested ridges; the ranges are completely surrounded by treeless prairie and/or semi-arid scrubland below.  Other well-known sky islands of North America are the [[Great Basin]] montane forests, such as the [[White Mountains (California)|White Mountains]] in California, and the [[Spring Mountains]] near Las Vegas, [[Nevada]]. One of the unique aspects of the sky islands of the [[U.S.-Mexico border]] region is the mix of floristic affinities, that is, the trees and plants of higher elevations are more characteristic of northern latitudes, while the flora of the lower elevations has ties to the desert and the mountains further south.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Some montane species apparently evolved within their current range, adapting to their local environment, such as the [[Mount Lyell shrew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

These bears historically made use of the forests and meadows found in the Madrean sky islands, as well as lower-elevation habitats such as [[riparian zone]]s. (Grizzlies were extirpated from the region in the 20th century.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Confusing the matter somewhat is the potential for an archipelago of sky islands or even the valleys between them to act not only as a barrier to [[biological dispersal]], but also as a path for migration. Examples of birds and mammals making use of the Madrean archipelago to extend their ranges northward are the [[elegant trogon]] and [[white-nosed coati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The mythical or "recognized" Strait of Anián, separating Asia and the Americas, is also shown. Part of the known North American coast is possibly widely shifted to the northwest]]
The '''Strait of Anián''' was a semi-mythical strait, documented from around 1560, that was believed by early modern cartographers to mark the boundary between [[North America]] and [[Asia]] and to permit access to a [[Northwest Passage]] from the [[Arctic Ocean]] to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. The true strait was discovered in 1728 and became known as the [[Bering Strait]]. The Strait of Anián had been generally placed nearby but sometimes appeared as far south as [[geography of California|California]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''The European Discovery of America'', 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zmItJhso1EIC&amp;dq=Hayes+historical+atlas&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Derek Hayes,’Historical Atlas of the North Pacific Ocean’,2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The source of this idea is unknown. The [[Martin Waldseemüller]] map of 1506 or 1507 shows America and Asia separated. A 1562 map by Paolo Forlani shows Asia and North America joined north of about the latitude of San Diego. The strait probably took its name from Ania, a Chinese province mentioned in a 1559 edition of [[Marco Polo]]'s book. The name probably first appeared on a map issued by the Italian [[Cartography|cartographer]] [[Giacomo Gastaldi]] in 1562.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, page 24. He says this is a revision of a 1546 map.&lt;/ref&gt; It appeared on maps by [[Abraham Ortelius]] (1564), [[Bolognini Zaltieri]] (1567) and [[Gerardus Mercator]] (1567). The Zaltieri and Gastaldi maps show it narrow and crooked. Gastaldi and Ortelius have an "Ania" or "Anian" on the east side of the strait. A speculative map of 1578 shows [[Frobisher Strait]] extending all the way across Canada and ending at the Strait of Anian.&lt;ref&gt;Glyn Williams,"Arctic Labyrinth", 2010, page 30&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juan de Fuca]], a Greek navigator, sailed in a Spanish expedition in 1592 to seek the fabled Strait of Anián. A 1719 map by [[Herman Moll]] shows the strait as a probable bay at 50° North north of an [[Island of California]]. The 1728 edition of a map by [[Johannes van Keulen]] shows the strait north of the Island of California with the note that 'they say that one can come through this strait to Hudson Bay, but this is not proven.'

A '''stream gauge''', '''streamgage''' or '''gauging station''' is a location used by [[hydrologists]] or [[environmental scientist]]s to monitor and test [[surface water|terrestrial bodies of water]]. [[hydrometry|Hydrometric]] measurements of [[water level]] surface elevation ("[[stage (hydrology)|stage]]") and/or volumetric [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] (flow) are generally taken and observations of [[biota (ecology)|biota]] and [[water quality]] may also be made.  The location of gauging stations are often found on [[Topographic map|topographical maps]].  Some gauging stations are highly automated and may include [[telemetry]] capability transmitted to a central [[data logging]] facility.

==Measurement equipment==
{{see also|Streamflow#Measurement}}

[[Image:Snoqualmie Gaging Station 04135.JPG|right|180px|thumb|Stream Gaging Station, [[Carnation, Washington]]]]
Automated direct measurement of streamflow discharge is difficult at present.  In place of the direct measurement of streamflow discharge, one or more surrogate measurements can be used to produce discharge values.  In the majority of cases, a stage (the elevation of the water surface) measurement is used as the surrogate.  Low gradient (or shallow-sloped) streams are highly influenced by variable downstream channel conditions.  For these streams, a second stream gauge would be installed, and the slope of the water surface would be calculated between the gauges.  This value would be used along with the stage measurement to more accurately determine the streamflow discharge.  Within the last ten years, the technological advance of velocity sensors has allowed the use of water velocity as a reliable surrogate for streamflow discharge at sites with a stable cross-sectional area.  These [[sensor]]s are permanently mounted in the stream and measure velocity at a particular location in the stream and related to flow in a manner similar to the use of traditional water level.

In those instances where only a stage measurement is used as the surrogate, a '''rating curve''' must be constructed.  A rating curve is the functional relation between stage and discharge.  It is determined by making repeated discrete measurements of streamflow discharge using a [[Velocimetry|velocimeter]] and some means to measure the channel geometry to determine the cross-sectional area of the channel.  The technicians and [[hydrologist]]s responsible for determining the rating curve visit the site routinely, with special trips to measure the hydrologic extremes (floods and droughts), and make a '''discharge measurement''' by following an explicit set of instructions.

[[Image:HueyCreekAntarctica2001.jpg|thumb|right|280px|December 12, 2001 photo of the [[USGS]] streamflow-gaging station at [[Huey Creek]], [[McMurdo Dry Valleys]], [[Antarctica]].]]

Once the rating curve is established, it can be used in conjunction with stage measurements to determine the volumetric streamflow discharge.  This record then serves as an assessment of the volume of water that passes by the stream gauge and is useful for many tasks associated with hydrology.

In those instances where a velocity measurement is additionally used as a surrogate, an '''index velocity determination''' is conducted.  This analysis uses a velocity sensor, often either magnetic or acoustic, to measure the velocity of the flow at a particular location in the stream cross section.  Once again, discrete measurements of streamflow discharge are made by the technician or hydrologist at a variety of stages.  For each discrete determination of streamflow discharge, the mean velocity of the cross section is determined by dividing streamflow discharge by the cross-sectional area.  A rating curve, similar to that used for stage-discharge determinations, is constructed using the mean velocity and the index velocity from the permanently mounted meter.  An additional rating curve is constructed that relates stage of the stream to cross-sectional area.  Using these two ratings, the automatically collected stage produces an estimate of the cross-sectional area, and the automatically collected index velocity produces an estimate of the mean velocity of the [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]].  The streamflow discharge is computed as the estimate of the cross section area and the estimate of the mean velocity of the streamflow.

[[Image:B62doddieburn.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Stream gauge B62, a [[Weir#Compound weir|combination weir]] at Doddieburn, on the [[Mzingwane River]], [[Zimbabwe]]]]

A variety of hydraulic structures / primary device are used to improve the reliability of using water level as a surrogate for flow (improving the accuracy of the rating table), including:
* [[Weir]]s
**[[Weir#V-notch weir|V-notch]],
** [[Weir#Broad-crested weir|broad-crested]],
** [[Weir#Sharp crested weir (fayoum weir)|sharp-crested]] and
** [[Weir#Compound weir|combination]] weirs
* [[Flume]]s
**[[Parshall flume]]

Other equipment commonly used at permanent stream gauge include:
* Cableways - for suspending a hydrographer and current meter over a river to make high flow measurement
* Stilling well - to provide a calm water level that can be measured by a sensor

{{anchor|Water level}}Water level gauges:
* [[Staff (head) gauge]]s - for a visual indication of water depth
* Water pressure measuring device (Bubbler) - to measure water level via pressure (typically done directly in-stream without a stilling well)
* Stage [[rotary encoder|encoder]] - a [[potentiometer]] with a wheel and pulley system connected to a float in a stilling well to provide an electronic reading of the water level
* [[Ultrasonic sensor|Simple ultrasonic devices]] - to measure water level in a stilling well or directly in a canal.
* Electromagnetic gauges

[[Discharge (hydrology)|Discharge]] measurements of a stream or canal without an established stream gage can be made using a [[current meter]] or [[Acoustic Doppler current profiler]]. One informal methods that is not acceptable for any official or scientific purpose, but can be useful is the '''float method''', in which a floating object such as a piece of wood or orange peel is observed floating down the stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_rm/rm_gtr245.pdf|title=Stream channel reference sites: an illustrated guide to field technique.

In the United States, the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] (USGS) is the principal federal agency tasked with maintaining records of [[natural resources]].  Within the USGS, the Water Resources Division carries the responsibility for monitoring water resources.

To establish a stream gauge, USGS personnel first choose a site on a stream where the geometry is relatively stable and there is a suitable location to make discrete direct measurements of streamflow using specialized equipment.  Many times this will be at a bridge or other stream crossing.  Technicians then install equipment that measures the '''stage''' (the elevation of the water surface) or, more rarely, the '''[[velocity]]''' of the flow.  Additional equipment is installed to record and transmit these readings (via the [[Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite]]) to the Water Science Center office where the records are kept.  The USGS has a Water Science Center office in every state within the United States.  Current streamflow data from USGS streamgages may be viewed in map form at: [http://waterwatch.usgs.gov/?id=ww_current].

===Zimbabwe===

In [[Zimbabwe]], the national stream gauge network is the responsibility of the [[Zimbabwe National Water Authority]]. This is an extensive network covering all major rivers and catchments in the country. However, a review of existing gauges raised serious concerns about the reliability of the data of a minority of stations, due in part to ongoing funding problems.&lt;ref&gt;Nyabeze, W.R. 2005.

===Czech Republic===

In the Czech Republic, in some measuring places (profiles) are defined three levels which define three degrees of flood-emergency activity. The degree I is a situation of alertness, the degree II is a situation of readiness, the degree III is a situation of danger.

A '''tourist trap''' is an establishment, or group of establishments, that has been created or re-purposed with the aim of attracting [[tourists]] and their money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

While some establishments may be viewed by tourists as fun and interesting diversions, tourist traps can also have negative connotations when they direct travelers off highways into commercial areas.

==United States==

===Activities===
In some areas, simple facilities may be a sufficient draw to entice tourists to stop. [[Wall Drug]], in [[South Dakota]], began its tourist trade simply by offering ice water.&lt;ref Name="Wall"&gt;{{cite web  | title =WallDrug.com  | work =The Wall Drug Store got its start during the Depression years by offering Free Ice Water to thirsty travelers  | publisher =  | year =2007  | url =http://www.walldrug.com/  | format =web  | accessdate = 2008-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Breezewood, Pennsylvania]] represents a physical tourist trap at the intersection of Interstate 70 and Interstate 76, where the two major highways are not directly connected; forcing transiting drivers off the interstate and "into several suddenly urban blocks with traffic lights and a dense bazaar of gas stations, fast food restaurants and motels."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/06/us/politics/a-pennsylvania-highway-town-at-the-junction-of-politics-and-policy.html|title=As Trump Vows Building Splurge, Famed Traffic Choke Point Offers Warning|last=Savage|first=Charlie|date=2017-02-06|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2017-02-06|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The term "tourist trap"===
A few establishments take pride in the term and embody it into their names, such as "[[Da Yoopers#Tourist Trap|Da Yoopers Tourist Trap]]",&lt;ref Name="Yoopers"&gt;{{cite web   | title = Da Yoopers Tourist Trap &amp; Museum  | work = Ishpeming, Michigan, Business web site  | url = http://www.dayoopers.com/thetrap.html  | format = Web   | accessdate = 2007-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; run by the comedy troupe [[Da Yoopers]] in [[Michigan]]’s [[Upper Peninsula]], and "The Tourist Trap"&lt;ref name="Maryland"&gt;{{cite web   | title = The Tourist Trap  | work = Deep Creek Lake, Maryland, Business web site  | publisher =   | date = 2003 | url = http://www.shoptouristtrap.com  | format = Web  | doi =  | accessdate =  2007-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Deep Creek Lake, Maryland]].

== Canada ==

[[Clifton Hill, Niagara Falls]] is a popular tourist trap in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]]. The street attractions are owned by two entities. The area also extends to a small portion north of Victoria Avenue east and west of Clifton Hill and Centre Street north of Victoria Avenue.

There are a large number of [[Australia's big things|"big things" in Australia]]. Many of those were initially created as Tourist Traps, but have gained [[Cult following|cult]] status in the country since.

'''Vuosaari Harbour''' (''Vuosaaren satama'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]; ''Nordsjö hamn'' in [[Finland-Swedish|Swedish]]) is a [[seaport]] facility in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], opened in November 2008. It is also 19th tallest building in [[Finland]]. 

The harbour, located in the suburb of [[Vuosaari]] in [[East Helsinki]], handles goods traffic for the [[Greater Helsinki]] region, while passenger services remain in Helsinki city centre. Vuosaari Harbour has assumed the operations of two container harbours, [[West Harbour, Helsinki|West Harbour]] in the city centre and [[Sörnäinen]] Harbour, and will eventually also replace the oil harbour in [[Laajasalo]]. In addition, the railway depot in [[Pasila]] currently used by goods transport will be moved northwards. These processes release land for commercial and residential redevelopment.

The harbour has a total land area of 150 [[hectare]]s, including 90 hectares of land reclaimed by filling the sea. There is also a 75-hectare [[business park]] next to the harbour. The harbour project also included the extension of [[Kehä III|Ring III]] to the new seaport and a new railway line to be used for transporting goods in and out of the harbour.

The Vuosaari harbour was built on the site of the former [[Vuosaari shipyard]].
