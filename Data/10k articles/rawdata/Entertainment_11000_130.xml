{{2018 Commonwealth Games}}
The opening ceremony for the [[2018 Commonwealth Games]] took place on the evening of Wednesday 4 April in the [[Carrara Stadium]], [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As mandated by the Commonwealth Games Charter, the proceedings of the ceremony combined the formal opening of the sporting event (including hoisting of the flags, parade of the athletes and welcome speeches) with an artistic performance to showcase the host nation's culture. The 2018 Games were formally opened by [[Charles, Prince of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.royal.uk/opening-gold-coast-2018-commonwealth-games?page=4|title=Opening of The Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games|last=Jenny.minard|date=2017-07-27|work=The Royal Family|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Morton Worldwide]] was given the contract to produce the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2018 Commonwealth Games. The theme of the opening ceremony was '''''Hello Earth''''' and directed by [[David Zolkwer]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  

The ceremony began at 20:00 [[AEST]] and lasted almost three hours. It was watched by an estimated worldwide television of 1.5 billion.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The principal sections of the artistic display represented Australia's [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous culture]], Gold Coast's [[Surfers Paradise, Queensland|Surfers Paradise]], wildlife and theme parks. A medley of Australian classics were played live by the [[Queensland Symphony Orchestra]]''',''' [[Queensland Youth Orchestras|Queensland Youth Orchestra]] and Gold Coast Youth Orchestra during the parade of nations. Popular Australian recording artists such as [[Christine Anu]], [[Delta Goodrem]], [[Katie Noonan]] and [[Ricki-Lee Coulter|Ricki-Lee Coutler]] performed at the ceremony. The opening ceremony was seen as a tremendous success and worldwide praised.       

== Preparations ==
Three Australian companies: Specktak International, World Events, Dae Global and one American company [[Jack Morton Worldwide]] (JMW) submitted bids to the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games Corporation (GOLDOC) to produce the opening and closing ceremonies of the [[2018 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]]. On 27 December 2015, the GOLDOC announced they chose Jack Morton Worldwide to produce the ceremonies of the games. This sparked a controversy as the head of all the three Australian Companies [[Ric Birch]], head of Spectak, [[David Atkins]], head of Dae Global and Julie Brooks, head of World Events questioned to GOLDOC that why an American company (JMW) was chosen for the production of ceremonies which was going to happen in Australia. [[Ric Birch]], who co-ordinated the ceremonies of the [[1982 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Brisbane]], the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in [[Sydney]] and the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], called for a review of the decision to overlook three Australian companies to present the ceremonies at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/dec/27/olympics-creative-director-unhappy-over-2018-commonwealth-games-snub|title=Olympics creative director unhappy over 2018 Commonwealth Games snub|last=Press|first=Australian Associated|date=2015-12-27|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; GOLDOC's head of communications Marcus Taylor said that JMW  is an international company which have been working in Australia since 1983 and have a range of experiences in producing the ceremonies of events as they have previously done for [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]], [[2006 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Melbourne]] and the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Glasgow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-27/us-company-to-produce--gold-coast-commonwealth-games-ceremonies/7055462|title=US company to produce Gold Coast Commonwealth Games ceremonies|date=2015-12-27|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-07-01|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 22 November 2017, the GOLDOC revealed some of the key artistic personnel working on the ceremonies of the games. The creative team for the opening and closing ceremonies consisted of a roster of renowned individuals. Leading the ceremonies team as Artistic Director and Project Director was [[David Zolkwer]], Head of [[Jack Morton Worldwide]] Public Events. David previously led the teams for the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]], [[2002 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Manchester]], [[2006 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Melbourne]] and [[2014 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Glasgow]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jackmorton.com/people/david-zolkwer/|title=David Zolkwer {{!}} Jack Morton|work=Jack Morton|access-date=2018-07-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian singer [[Katie Noonan]], winner of five [[ARIA Music Awards|ARIA music awards]] and former lead singer of [[Brisbane]] based band [[George (band)|George]], was given the role of the Music Director of the ceremonies. Katie said "I'm a fiercely proud Queensland musician; I think we make some of the best music in the world and indeed some of the best art in the world. There's some truly world class dance and music being made here, so it's a good time to focus on our (cultural) identity and realise that we're really good at what we do."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/katie-noonan-to-direct-music-in-commonwealth-games-ceremonies-20171122-p4yx5r.html|title=Katie Noonan to direct music in Commonwealth Games ceremonies|last=Wenzel|first=Murray|date=2017-11-22|website=Brisbane Times|language=en|access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has served as the Artistic Director of the [[Queensland Music Festival]] since 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qmf.org.au/aboutus/artistic-director/|title=Artistic Director - Queensland Music Festival|work=Queensland Music Festival|access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proceedings==

=== Countdown ===
The opening ceremony started with a countdown from 65000 years quickly to 10-1 seconds. When the countdown is finished, a very large firework exploded in the middle of the ground of the Carrara Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/commonwealth-games/live-updates-of-commonwealth-games-2018-opening-ceremony/10987654321-and-the-ceremony-begins-/articleshow/63611318.cms|title=10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 and the ceremony begins... - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Hello Earth ===
Australian Actor [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]] spoke about the history of Earth along with holding an illuminated globe.
{{Cquote|Home. That’s where we live. From here, you can’t see any borders. No barriers built to divide us, no people on different sides. All that we are, and have been, and can be, all that we value, all that we love, all our memories and stories, our hopes and our dreams, the best, and the worst, of us – is here, on that tiny grain of rock. From here there’s no sound of our quarrels, no voices in conflict, no people at war. From here it seems, we’re all the same, not drifting apart, but all connected. No sign of ‘Other’ – only Sister and Brother. No ‘You’, or ‘Me’ – just ‘We’. From here, all that we see is all that we share: Shining, fragile, awesome… …our island home in a cosmic sea.|source=[[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]], in the ceremony programme&lt;ref name=Intro&gt;{{cite news |title=Hello Earth featured in Commonwealth Games opening ceremony |url=http://www.katebushnews.com/index.php/2018/04/hello-earth-featured-in-commonwealth-games-opening-ceremony/ |publisher=Kate Bush News |first= Seán|last=Twomey|date=4 April 2018 |accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
When he finished his narration, he then placed the globe in the ground which was covered with beach sand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/commonwealth-games/live-updates-of-commonwealth-games-2018-opening-ceremony/australia-actor-jack-thompson-welcomes-everyone-with-a-message-of-hope-peace-and-unity-holding-what-looks-like-a-globe-and-places-it-on-the-floor-sand-before-it-explodes/articleshow/63611442.cms|title=Australia actor  Jack Thompson welcomes everyone with a message of hope, peace and unity, holding what looks like a globe and places it on the floor (sand) before it explodes - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.katebushnews.com/index.php/2018/04/hello-earth-featured-in-commonwealth-games-opening-ceremony/|title=Hello Earth featured in Commonwealth Games opening ceremony {{!}} Kate Bush News|website=www.katebushnews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image of earth was projected on the ground showcasing the movement of winds, oceans, wind currents and large mass of land. A group of girls stood at the image projection of land and raised their right hands. The large mass of land immediately separated into seven continents. After the separation of land masses, a white [[humpback whale]] "Migaloo" was shown swimming across the oceans and diving into the land of Australia. 

=== Four Winds ===
World-renowned didgeridoo player [[William Barton (musician)|William Barton]] played his instrument at the top of the [[Q1 (building)|Q1]] tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/commonwealth-games/live-updates-of-commonwealth-games-2018-opening-ceremony/william-barton-one-of-australias-finest-traditional-didgeridoo-players-entertains-the-crowd-and-singer-christine-anu-joins-him/articleshow/63611566.cms|title=William Barton, one of Australia’s finest traditional didgeridoo players, entertains the crowd and singer Christine Anu joins him - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hip-hop artist [[Mau Power]] from [[Thursday Island]] in the [[Torres Strait]] and Australian singer [[Christine Anu]] sang the song "[[My Island Home#Christine Anu version|My Island Home]]" along with Four Winds Didgeridoo Orchestra. A group of dancers holding small glowing spheres danced along with the song. When the song finished, the dancers immediately stood adjacent to each other forming the shape of Australian land boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news.com.au/sport/commonwealth-games/were-performers-at-commonwealth-games-opening-ceremony-lip-syncing/news-story/117f63ca733a82bf69b77c40c33f00b2|title=Did Christine Anu lip sync at Commonwealth Games’ Opening Ceremony?|work=NewsComAu|access-date=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christine Anu sang the same song at the [[2000 Summer Olympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]] of the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] and in the opening ceremonies of the [[2000 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Sydney]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2018/apr/04/commonwealth-games-2018-opening-ceremony-in-pictures|title=Commonwealth Games 2018 opening ceremony – in pictures|last=Bynon|first=Daffydd|date=2018-04-04|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-06-24|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Totem ceremony ===
After the history of Earth segment, the traditional [[totem]] ceremony was showcased. This part of the ceremony represented the moment of reconnecting and regeneration.

== Technical aspects ==
Norwest productions was the official audio supplier for the opening and closing ceremonies of the Games.

Some 15,000 tickets for the event had the wrong day printed on them (Thursday), instead of the correct date (Wednesday).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wolfe|first=Natalie|date=13 February 2018|title=Gold Coast Commonwealth Games Opening Ceremony hit with printing error|url=http://www.news.com.au/sport/sports-life/gold-coast-commonwealth-games-opening-ceremony-hit-with-printing-error/news-story/8558b57430ba47cb176f22389d691518|work=[[news.com.au]]|access-date=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bar Facal''' is one of the most traditional [[Uruguay]]an [[coffeehouse]]. Located in the corner 18 de Julio avenue and Yí street, [[Centro, Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]]. It was founded in 1882 by Galician Manuel Facal and his brothers. It is the oldest Uruguayan downtown bar.

The coffeehouse was originally a factory for chocolates and quince candy. Outside the bar is a sculpture of [[Carlos Gardel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espectador.com/sociedad/318043/inauguraron-estatua-de-carlos-gardel-en-puerta-del-bar-facal#1|title= Inauguraron estatua de Carlos Gardel en puerta del Bar Facal |author=espectador|date= 2015|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.republica.com.uy/estatua-a-carlos-gardel/522895/ |title=Inauguraron hoy una fstatua a Carlos Gardel en 18 y Yi |author=republica|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a fountain where tourists leave [[love locks]].

In 2009 the Departmental Board of Montevideo recognized the contribution of the Bar Facal to the national culture and the national gastronomy with a plaque that is in the wall. There is also a plaque of the Mayor's office in [[Medellín]].

'''''Barnyard''''' (often marketed as '''''Barnyard: The Original Party Animals''''') is a 2006 German-American&lt;ref name=AFIBarnyard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&amp;Movie=63712|title=Detail view of Movies Page|website=www.afi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] [[comedy]] film, distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]], co-produced by [[Nickelodeon Movies]], [[O Entertainment]] and Omation Animation Studio, directed by [[Steve Oedekerk]] (who was also one of the producers and the main writer) with music by [[John Debney]] and co-produced by Paul Marshal. It was released on August 4, 2006. The film stars the voices of [[Kevin James]], [[Courteney Cox]], [[Sam Elliott]], [[Danny Glover]], [[Wanda Sykes]], [[Andie MacDowell]] and [[David Koechner]]. Most of the production was carried out in [[San Clemente, California]].

''Barnyard'' grossed $116.5 million worldwide against a $51 million production budget and spawned a television series, titled ''[[Back at the Barnyard]]'', which ran for two seasons between 2007 and 2011.

==Plot==
Otis ([[Kevin James]]) is a carefree young cow who prefers playing with his friends rather than accept responsibility. His strict father Ben ([[Sam Elliott]]) is the leader of the barnyard. After Otis interrupts a barnyard meeting with his wild antics, Ben has a talk with his son, warning him that he will never be happy if he spends his life partying without acting more maturely. Otis ignores his advice and leaves to have fun with his friends Pip the Mouse ([[Jeffrey Garcia|Jeff Garcia]]), Pig the Pig ([[Tino Insana]]), Freddy the Ferret ([[Cam Clarke]]), and Peck the Rooster ([[Rob Paulsen]]). That same day, Otis meets a pregnant cow named Daisy ([[Courteney Cox|Courtney Cox]]), who is accompanied by her friend, Bessy ([[Wanda Sykes]]).

That night, the animals throw a party in the barn. All the animals at the barnyard are there except Ben, who guards the fence line. Otis is assigned a shift along with Ben, but Otis talks himself out of work. Before Otis leaves, Ben tells him that the night he found him as a baby calf stumbling alone in the meadow, he swore he saw the stars dance, thus giving him reason to know his place was at the farm. Later, Ben takes on a pack of coyotes led by Dag ([[David Koechner]]), plundering the chicken coop. He manages to fight off the pack until he is bitten on the leg by the red coyote, making him fall. The Coyotes pile on Ben, but he manages to grab Dag and escapes the pile. He threatens to punch Dag but lets him go, scaring away him and the coyotes. Ben falls on the ground, exhausted. Otis is alerted and he runs outside to his father. Ben dies and is buried on a hill by the farmer ([[Fred Tatasciore]]), and the other animals mourn Ben after the farmer leaves.

After Ben's death, all the animals elect Otis as the new leader of the barnyard. Otis shirks his duties by leaving Freddy and Peck in charge of the coop, then helps the trouble-making Jersey Cows Eddy, Igg, and Bud ([[S. Scott Bullock]], [[John DiMaggio]], and [[Maurice LaMarche]]) teach a lesson to a mean fat youngster called Snotty Boy ([[Steve Oedekerk]]) for cow-tipping, eluding the police along the way. Later that night, when Otis is holding Daisy's hoof under the starlight, he overhears the coyotes chasing a rabbit and leaves Daisy to pursue the coyotes and avenge his father. Otis tries to attack Dag and his pack, but is outnumbered. Since Otis is weaker, Dag proposes a deal: he and his pack will take various barnyard animals at random times and that, if Otis tries to stand up to them, they will slaughter everyone at the barnyard. Otis decides to leave the barnyard, realizing that his chances of victory are slim.

The next morning, before leaving, Otis is informed that the Coyotes took some hens including Maddy (Madeline Lovejoy), a little chick who is one of Otis' friends. Otis realizes that he has been fooled by Dag, as he was not expecting him and the coyotes until tonight, and sets off to rescue the chickens. Otis confronts the pack but is easily defeated after Dag bites him in the leg; however, Pip, Pig, Freddy, Peck, Miles ([[Danny Glover]]), Ben's old friend, and the Jersey Cows arrive to help Otis. Dag tries to attack Otis from behind, but Otis is alerted when Peck successfully manages to crow a warning. Otis catches Dag and warns him to never return to the barnyard. Otis then swings Dag out of the junkyard with a golf club, finally avenging his father's death.

After hijacking a biker gang's motorcycles from the diner, Otis and the rest make it back to the barn to witness Daisy giving birth to a calf that she names Li'l Ben. Otis then takes full responsibility and becomes the new leader of the barnyard as he watches the stars of himself, Daisy and Lil' Ben dance just like Ben said. Mrs. Beady gets ready for bed, but she noticed that Wild Mike is on top of her head.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
The film has an approval rating of 22% at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 97 reviews and an average rating of 4.4/10. The site's consensus says, "Unimaginative and unfunny, this tale of barnyard mischief borders on 'udder' creepiness and adds little to this summer's repertoire of animated films."&lt;ref name=RottenTomatoes&gt;{{cite web|title=Barnyard (2006)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/barnyard/|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], it has a score of 42 out of 100, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barnyard|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/barnyard|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger Moore of the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' gave the film 2 stars out of 5, saying that, "with ''Barnyard'', another quick-and-dirty 'all-star cast' mess churned out by the digital start-ups hired to steal some of [[Pixar]]'s cash, the year that computer-generated animation '[[Jumping the shark|jumps the shark]]' becomes official. Politically correct, anatomically incorrect and ugly to look at, the only thing that saves ''Barnyard'' is a writer (and director) Steve Oedekerk's gift for gags and almost-edgy humor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moore|first=Roger|title=Udder nonsense falls short in 'Barnyard'|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2006-08-04/entertainment/BARNYARD_1_barnyard-ant-bully-sam-elliott|accessdate=November 18, 2012|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|date=August 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kyle Smith]] of the ''[[New York Post]]'' gave the film a score of 1.5/4, saying that "if you want to punish your kids, send them to bed without dinner.

On the positive side, J. R. Jones of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' enjoyed ''Barnyard'', saying that "it's way funnier than many of the R-rated comedies I've seen lately, though Oedekerk seems to have ignored the writer's edict to know your subject—most of his cows are male. The CGI is excellent, with characters whose depth and solidity suggest [[Nick Park]]'s clay animations. The laughs subside near the end as the requisite moral kicks in, but this is still that rare kids' movie I'd recommend to parents and non-parents alike."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Barnyard {{!}} Chicago Reader|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/barnyard/Film?oid=1067541|accessdate=17 November 2012|newspaper=Chicago Reader|date=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claudia Puig of ''[[USA Today]]'' gave the film a score of 2.5/4, calling it "a sweet and mildly funny movie that will entertain young audiences, but one aspect is utterly mystifying: The two main characters, father and son bovine creatures, have large, distracting udders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Watch your step in 'Barnyard' - USATODAY.com|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/2006-08-03-barnyard_x.htm|accessdate=17 November 2012|date=3 August 2006|work=USA Today|first=Claudia|last=Puig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The_High_Rollers_Extravaganza_Co._-_Bend_Her_-_c.1900.jpg|thumb|300px|Burlesque on ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ|Ben-Hur]]'', c. 1900]]
A '''burlesque''' is a literary, dramatic or musical work intended to cause laughter by caricaturing the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/24999 "Burlesque",] ''Oxford English Dictionary'', Oxford University Press, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word derives from the Italian ''{{wiktita|burlesco}}'', which, in turn, is derived from the Italian ''{{wiktita|burla}}'' – a joke, ridicule or mockery.&lt;ref&gt;In theatrical use, a burla was "a comic interlude or practical joke introduced, usually extempore, into a performance by the servant masks of the [[commedia dell'arte]] … developed at will into a small independent 'turn', the characters returning at its conclusion to the main theme of the plot". See Hartnoll, Phyllis and Peter Found. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t79.e492 "Burla",] ''The Concise Oxford Companion to the Theatre'',  Oxford University Press, 1996. Oxford Reference Online, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.myheritage.com/research/record-90100-43624043/the-new-york-clipper-vol-62-september#fullscreen "Burlesque News – The Growth of Burlesque"], ''[[New York Clipper]]'', Vol. 62, No. 31, September 12, 1914, p. 18 (accessed February 28, 2017, ''via'' [[MyHeritage]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Burlesque overlaps in meaning with [[caricature]], [[parody]] and travesty, and, in its theatrical sense, with [[extravaganza]], as presented during the [[Victorian burlesque|Victorian era]].&lt;ref&gt;[[H. W. Fowler|Fowler, H. W.]], rev. [[Ernest Gowers|Sir Ernest Gowers]] (1965). ''Modern English Usage''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 68 and 96&lt;/ref&gt;  "Burlesque" has been used in English in this literary and theatrical sense since the late 17th century. It has been applied retrospectively to works of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and to the Graeco-Roman classics.&lt;ref name=Baldick&gt;Baldick, Chris. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t56.e153 "Burlesque",] ''The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'', Oxford University Press, 2008. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrasting examples of literary burlesque are [[Alexander Pope]]'s  ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'' and [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Hudibras]]''.  An example of musical burlesque is  [[Richard Strauss]]'s 1890 [[Burleske|Burleske for piano and orchestra]].  Examples of [[Victorian burlesque|theatrical burlesques]] include [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'' and the [[A. C. Torr]] – [[Meyer Lutz]] shows, including ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blase Roue|Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]''.

A later use of the term, [[American burlesque|particularly in the United States]], refers to performances in a [[variety show]] format.  These were popular from the 1860s to the 1940s, often in [[cabaret]]s and clubs, as well as theatres, and featured bawdy comedy and female [[striptease]].  Some Hollywood films attempted to recreate the spirit of these performances from the 1930s to the 1960s, or included burlesque-style scenes within dramatic films, such as 1972's ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'' and 1979's ''[[All That Jazz (film)|All That Jazz]]'', among others. There has been a resurgence of interest in this format since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sankar-Gorton|first1=Eliza|title=Burlesque Is Back and Here Is What You Need to Know About It|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eliza-sankargorton/burlesque-is-back-and-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-about-it_b_7176112.html| website=www.huffingtonpost.com|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=30 April 2015|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Petkovic| first1=John| title=Burlesque: Then and now, a timeline of performers from Lili St. Cyr to Dita VonTeese|url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2010/11/burlesque_then_and_now_a_timel.html|website=www.cleveland.com|publisher=[[The Plain Dealer]]|date=28 November 2010|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary origins and development==
[[File:Arabella-Fermor-crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Arabella Fermor, target of ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'']]
The word first appears in a title in [[Francesco Berni]]'s ''Opere burlesche'' of the early 16th century, works that had circulated widely in manuscript before they were printed. For a time, burlesque verses were known as ''poesie bernesca'' in his honour. 'Burlesque' as a literary term became widespread in 17th century Italy and France, and subsequently England, where it referred to a grotesque imitation of the dignified or pathetic.&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;Fredric Woodbridge Wilson: "Burlesque", ''Grove Music Online'' ed. L. Macy (Accessed December 04, 2008), [http://www.grovemusic.com (subscription access)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s Pyramus and Thisbe scene in ''[[Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' and the general mocking of romance in Beaumont and Fletcher's ''[[The Knight of the Burning Pestle]]'' were early examples of such imitation.&lt;ref name=stanton&gt;Stanton, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

In 17th century Spain, playwright and poet [[Miguel de Cervantes]] ridiculed medieval romance in his many satirical works. Among Cervantes' works are ''[[Exemplary Novels]]'' and the ''Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes'' published in 1615.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5kwQTtSRP?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570534/burlesque.html Burlesque], ''MSN Encarta'', accessed 18 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The term burlesque has been applied retrospectively to works of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] and Shakespeare and to the Graeco-Roman classics.&lt;ref name=Baldick/&gt;

Burlesque was intentionally ridiculous in that it imitated several styles and combined imitations of certain authors and artists with absurd descriptions. In this, the term was often used interchangeably with "[[pastiche]]", "[[parody]]", and the 17th and 18th century genre of the "[[mock-heroic]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; Burlesque depended on the reader's (or listener's) knowledge of the subject to make its intended effect, and a high degree of literacy was taken for granted.&lt;ref&gt;Speaight, George. "All froth and bubble", ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', 1 October 1976, p. 1233&lt;/ref&gt;

17th and 18th century burlesque was divided into two types: '''High burlesque''' refers to a burlesque imitation where a literary, elevated manner was applied to a commonplace or comically inappropriate subject matter as, for example, in the literary [[Parody#English term|parody]] and the [[mock-heroic]]. One of the most commonly cited examples of high burlesque is [[Alexander Pope]]'s "sly, knowing and courtly" ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, pp. 290–91&lt;/ref&gt; '''Low burlesque''' applied an irreverent, mocking style to a serious subject; an example is [[Samuel Butler (1612-1680)|Samuel Butler]]'s poem ''[[Hudibras]]'', which described the misadventures of a Puritan knight in satiric [[doggerel]] verse, using a colloquial idiom.  Butler's addition to his comic poem of an ethical subtext made his caricatures into [[satire]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hudibras'' was so popular that it became the subject of parody itself.  See Sanders, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent times, burlesque true to its literary origins is still performed in [[revue]]s and [[Sketch comedy|sketches]].&lt;ref name=stanton/&gt;  [[Tom Stoppard]]'s 1974 play ''[[Travesties]]'' is an example of a full-length play drawing on the burlesque tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, p. 50; and Hunter, Jim (1982) ''Tom Stoppard's Plays''. London: Faber and Faber, {{ISBN|0-571-11903-4}}, pp. 23–33, 141–146 and 237–242&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music==
{{see also|Parody music}}

===Classical music===
Beginning in the early 18th century, the term burlesque was used throughout Europe to describe musical works in which serious and comic elements were juxtaposed or combined to achieve a grotesque effect.&lt;ref name=kennedy&gt;[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] (2006), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Music'', p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; As derived from literature and theatre, "burlesque" was used, and is still used, in music to indicate a bright or high-spirited mood, sometimes in contrast to seriousness.&lt;ref name=kennedy/&gt;

In this sense of farce and exaggeration rather than parody, it appears frequently on the German-language stage between the middle of the 19th century and the 1920s. Burlesque operettas were written by [[Johann Strauss II]] (''Die lustigen Weiber von Wien'', 1868),&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Andrew (1992), "Strauss, Johann" in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', ed. Stanley Sadie (London) {{ISBN|0-333-73432-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Michael Ziehrer|Ziehrer]] (''Mahomed's Paradies'',1866; ''Das Orakel zu Delfi'', 1872; ''Cleopatra, oder Durch drei Jahrtausende'', 1875; ''In fünfzig Jahren'', 1911)&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Andrew (1992), "Ziehrer, C. M." in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', ed. Stanley Sadie (London) {{ISBN|0-333-73432-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bruno Granichstaedten]] (''Casimirs Himmelfahrt'', 1911). French references to burlesque are less common than German, though [[André Grétry|Grétry]] composed for a "drame burlesque" (''Matroco'', 1777).&lt;ref&gt;Charlton, David and M. Elizabeth C. Bartlet, [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/43361 "Grétry, André-Ernest-Modeste: Works,"] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 24 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] called his 1916 one-act chamber opera-ballet ''[[Renard (Stravinsky)|Renard]]'' (''The Fox'') a ''"Histoire burlesque chantée et jouée"'' (''burlesque tale sung and played'') and his 1911 ballet ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' a "burlesque in four scenes". A later example is the 1927 burlesque operetta by [[Ernst Krenek]] entitled ''[[Schwergewicht]]'' (''Heavyweight'') (1927).
{{listen|filename=Richard_Strauss_-_Neal_O'Doan_-_Burleske.ogg|title=Burleske|description=''[[Burleske]]'' (1885–86), by [[Richard Strauss]]. Performed by Neal O'Doan with the Seattle Philharmonic Orchestra|format=[[ogg]]}}
Some orchestral and chamber works have also been designated as burlesques, of which two early examples are the Ouverture-Suite ''Burlesque de Quixotte'', TWV 55, by [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]] and the Sinfonia Burlesca by [[Leopold Mozart]] (1760). Another often-performed piece is [[Richard Strauss]]'s 1890 [[Burleske|Burleske for piano and orchestra]].&lt;ref name=kennedy/&gt;  Other examples include the following:
*1901: Six Burlesques, Op. 58 for piano four hands by [[Max Reger]]
*1904: Scherzo Burlesque, Op. 2 for piano and orchestra by [[Béla Bartók]]
*1911: Three Burlesques, Op. 8c for piano by Bartók
*1920: Burlesque for Piano, by [[Arnold Bax]]
*1931: Ronde burlesque, Op. 78 for orchestra by [[Florent Schmitt]]
*1932: Fantaisie burlesque, for piano by [[Olivier Messiaen]]
*1956: Burlesque for Piano and Chamber Orchestra, Op. 13g by [[Bertold Hummel]]
*1982: Burlesque for Wind Quintet, Op. 76b by Hummel

Burlesque can be used to describe particular movements of instrumental musical compositions, often involving dance rhythms. Examples are the Burlesca, in [[Partitas, BWV 825-830|Partita No. 3 for keyboard (BWV 827)]] by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], the "Rondo-Burleske" third movement of [[Symphony No. 9 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 9]] by [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], and the "Burlesque" fourth movement of [[Violin Concerto No. 1 (Shostakovich)|Shostakovich's Violin Concerto No. 1]].&lt;ref&gt;McGregor, Andrew, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/mmzf "Dmitri Shostakovich Violin Concertos 1 &amp; 2 Review"], BBC Music, accessed 24 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of burlesque has not been confined to classical music. Well known [[ragtime]] travesties include ''The Russian Rag'', by [[George L. Cobb]], which is based on [[Rachmaninoff]]'s [[Prelude in C-sharp minor (Rachmaninoff)|Prelude in C-sharp minor]], and [[Harry L. Alford|Harry Alford]]'s  ''Lucy's Sextette'' based on the [[sextet]], 'Chi mi frena in tal momento?', from ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' by [[Donizetti]].&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Max (2006): ''Rachmaninoff: Life, Works, Recordings'' p 229&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victorian theatrical burlesque==

{{main|Victorian burlesque}}
Victorian burlesque, sometimes known as "travesty" or "[[extravaganza]]",&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', "the various genre terms were always applied freely", and by the 1860s their use had become "arbitrary and capricious": see [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque,"] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}.  In an 1896 article on Burlesque in ''The Theatre'', the three terms are used interchangeably: see Adams, W. Davenport. "Burlesque: Old ''v.'' New", ''The Theatre'', 1 March 1896, pp. 144–45&lt;/ref&gt; was popular in London theatres between the 1830s and the 1890s.  It took the form of [[parody music|musical theatre parody]] in which a well-known opera, play or ballet was adapted into a broad comic play, usually a musical play, often risqué in style, mocking the theatrical and musical conventions and styles of the original work, and quoting or [[pastiche|pastiching]] text or music from the original work.  The comedy often stemmed from the incongruity and absurdity of the classical subjects, with realistic historical dress and settings, being juxtaposed with the modern activities portrayed by the actors.  [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]] produced burlesques at the [[Olympic Theatre]] beginning in 1831 with ''Olympic Revels'' by [[J. R. Planché]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, W. Davenport. ''A Book of Burlesque'' (London: Henry and Co., 1891), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  Other authors of burlesques included [[H. J. Byron]], [[G. R. Sims]], [[F. C. Burnand]], [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Fred Leslie]].&lt;ref name=times70/&gt;

Victorian burlesque related to and in part derived from traditional English [[pantomime]] "with the addition of gags and 'turns'."&lt;ref name=grove&gt;[[Erich Schwandt|Schwandt, Erich]] et al.

This English style of burlesque was successfully introduced to New York in the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Delmer D.

[[File:Faustupto.jpg|thumb|150px|Sheet music from ''[[Faust up to Date]]''|left]]
Some of the most frequent subjects for burlesque were the plays of Shakespeare and grand opera.&lt;ref name=marvin&gt;Marvin, Roberta Montemorra.

Macbeth asks Banquo, "What mean these salutations, noble thane?" and is told, "These showers of 'Hail' anticipate your 'reign'".&lt;ref name=wells/&gt; A staple of burlesque was the display of attractive women in [[Breeches role|travesty roles]], dressed in tights to show off their legs, but the plays themselves were seldom more than modestly risqué.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

Burlesque became the speciality of certain London theatres, including the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety]] and [[Royal Strand Theatre]] from the 1860s to the early 1890s.  Until the 1870s, burlesques were often one-act pieces running less than an hour and using [[pastiche]]s and parodies of popular songs, opera [[aria]]s and other music that the audience would readily recognize.  The house stars included [[Nellie Farren]], [[John D'Auban]], [[Edward O'Connor Terry|Edward Terry]] and [[Fred Leslie]].&lt;ref name=times70&gt;"Theatrical Humour in the Seventies", ''[[The Times]]'', 20 February 1914, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;"Mr. D'Auban's 'Startrap' Jumps". ''The Times'', 17 April 1922, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  From about 1880, Victorian burlesques grew longer, until they were a whole evening's entertainment rather than part of a double- or triple-bill.&lt;ref name=times70/&gt;  In the early 1890s, these burlesques went out of fashion in London, and the focus of the Gaiety and other burlesque theatres changed to the new more wholesome but less literary genre of [[Edwardian musical comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, Kurt.

==American burlesque==

{{main|American burlesque}}
American burlesque shows were originally an offshoot of Victorian burlesque. The English genre had been successfully staged in New York from the 1840s, and it was popularised by a visiting British burlesque troupe, [[Lydia Thompson]] and the "British Blondes", beginning in 1868.&lt;ref name=Friends&gt;Hoffos, Signe and Moulder, Bob.  [http://www.kensalgreen.co.uk/documents/FOKGC43_Thompson.pdf "Desperately Seeking Lydia" and "Appreciating Lydia",] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513080257/http://www.kensalgreen.co.uk/documents/FOKGC43_Thompson.pdf |date=2011-05-13 }} ''The Friends of Kensal Green Cemetery Magazine'', Vol. 43, Autumn 2006, pp. 1–7&lt;/ref&gt;  New York burlesque shows soon incorporated elements and the structure of the popular [[minstrel show]]s. They consisted of three parts: first, songs and ribald comic sketches by low comedians; second, assorted [[Olio (musical number)|olios]] and male acts, such as acrobats, magicians and solo singers; and third, chorus numbers and sometimes a burlesque in the English style on politics or a current play. The entertainment was usually concluded by an exotic dancer or a wrestling or boxing match.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;[http://library.eb.co.uk/eb/article-9018177 "Burlesque show",] ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Online Library Edition, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While burlesque went out of fashion in England towards the end of the 19th century, to be replaced by [[Edwardian musical comedy]], the American style of burlesque flourished, but with increasing focus on female nudity. Exotic "cooch" dances were brought in, ostensibly Syrian in origin.  The entertainments were given in clubs and cabarets, as well as music halls and theatres. By the early 20th century, there were two national circuits of burlesque shows competing with the [[vaudeville]] circuit, as well as resident companies in New York, such as [[Minsky's Burlesque|Minsky's]] at the Winter Garden.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

The transition from burlesque on the old lines to striptease was gradual. At first, [[soubrette]]s showed off their figures while singing and dancing; some were less active but compensated by appearing in elaborate stage costumes.&lt;ref name=humez&gt;Humez, Nick.

Sara Pendergast and Tom Pendergast, Gale Virtual Reference Library, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strippers gradually supplanted the singing and dancing soubrettes; by 1932 there were at least 150 strip principals in the US.&lt;ref name=humez/&gt; Star strippers included [[Sally Rand]], [[Gypsy Rose Lee]], [[Tempest Storm]], [[Lili St. Cyr]], [[Blaze Starr]], [[Ann Corio]] and [[Margie Hart]], who was celebrated enough to be mentioned in song lyrics by [[Lorenz Hart]] and [[Cole Porter]].&lt;ref name=humez/&gt; By the late 1930s, burlesque shows would have up to six strippers supported by one or two comics and a master of ceremonies. Comics who appeared in burlesque early in their careers included [[Fanny Brice]], [[Mae West]], [[Eddie Cantor]], [[Abbott and Costello]], [[W. C. Fields]], [[Jackie Gleason]], [[Danny Thomas]], [[Al Jolson]], [[Bert Lahr]], [[Phil Silvers]], [[Sid Caesar]], [[Danny Kaye]], [[Red Skelton]] and [[Sophie Tucker]].&lt;ref name=humez/&gt;

[[File:Display Card Flourish.jpg|thumb|An advanced two-handed flourish]]

'''Cardistry''' is a name given to the [[performance art]] of [[Playing cards|card]] flourishing. The term is a [[portmanteau]] of "card" and "artistry". Unlike [[card magic]], cardistry is meant to be visually impressive and appear very hard to execute. People who engage in cardistry are colloquially known as "cardists".

==History==
{{Main article|History of cardistry}}
[[File:Charlier (cropped).jpg|thumb|A Charlier one-handed cut]]
Conjuring tricks with playing cards became popular around the [[19th century]]. At that time, simple card flourishes—such as the [[Charlier Cut]], [[Riffle shuffle|Riffle Shuffle]] and Thumb Fan—were often performed by magicians as a way of demonstrating sleight of hand.&lt;ref name="Hugard"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hugard |first1=Jean |first2=Frederick |last2=Braué |first3=Paul |last3=Fleming |location=Mansfield Centre, CT |year=2015|title=The Royal Road to Card Magic |publisher=[[Dover Publications]], Martino Publishing |origyear=1999 |isbn=1614278601 |id={{ISBN|978-1614278603}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardistry is a portmanteau of “card” and “artistry.”  It involves the use of hands to create cuts, displays, fans, patterns and sequences through the use of playing cards.  Various armspreads, cuts, shuffles and springs can be used.  The intent is to create a captivating motion and beautiful display.  The effects are limited only by the types of cards used, the imagination, and the degree of manual dexterity of the performer.  The presentation is typically neither “illusionary” nor purportedly “magic”; rather, it is more like juggling, mime, or similar entertaining activities.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tanz |first1=Jason |date=20 April 2015 |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/04/inside-elegant-mesmerizing-subculture-card-juggling/ |title=Inside the Elegant, Mesmerizing Subculture of Card Juggling |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |quote=Cardistry is an arcane but growing pastime in which (primarily) young men shuffle, riffle, twist and toss decks of cards through acrobatic arrangements and sequences. Its practitioners, called cardists, share their feats by recording and posting EDM-backed compilations of their best moves. They already have built something of a canon. |accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardistry moves typically have unusual names that reflect their creator, origin, or appearance. There is Kevin Ho's "Flurf", "Off the Hook", and "Racoon", Joey Burton's "Skater Cut", Huron Low's "Firefly" and "Flicker", Daren Yeow's "Rev 2 Twirl", Bone Ho's "Anaconda" and "Tornado Deck Split", Oliver Sogard's "Friffle", Dan Buck's "Vertigo", and many more. Chris Kenner's two-handed "Sybil Cut" flourish uses multiple packets of cards, and is a good example of a popular flourish. It is arguably the most well-known and recognized move among cardists, and is a common starting challenge that newbies to the art try to take on. But from there, there are all kinds of advanced maneuvers to learn, some almost being a sub-genre of their own, such as "isolations".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://playingcarddecks.com/blogs/all-in/what-is-cardistry|title=What is Cardistry?|work=PlayingCardDecks.com|access-date=2018-09-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jonas Vinther demonstrating the five faces of Sybil.gif|thumb|[[Chris Kenner (magician)|Chris Kenner]]'s Sybil flourish]]
American magician [[Chris Kenner (magician)|Chris Kenner]] published ''[[Totally Out of Control]]'' in 1992, an instructional book concerning magic tricks with household objects. On page 125 was a two-handed flourish he called "[[Sybil (card flourish)|The Five Faces of Sybil]]". Making use of all fingers, the ending face of Sybil displays five distinct packets. Kenner referred to Sybil in his book as "a quick cut flourish to demonstrate skill and dexterity". The cut became the most notable creation from ''Totally Out of Control'' and would eventually form the nucleus of what is now known as cardistry. Kevin Pang of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine remarked that "every cardist can deftly perform Sybil the way guitarists can run through a [[blues progression]]".

[[Los Angeles]]-based magician Brian Tudor released an instructional [[VHS]] tape in 1997 dubbed ''Show Off'' which featured only flourishes, including numerous variations of Sybil. The tape was well received by critics and resulted in growing attention to card flourishing as a performance art.
[[File:Brian Tudor cardistry.jpg|thumb|Brian Tudor]]

Sybil enthusiasts and twin brothers [[Dan and Dave (magicians)|Dan and Dave]] released in 2001 ''Pasteboard Animations'', another VHS tape explaining advanced cuts and flourishes. It sold hundreds of copies and was critically praised in a ''[[Genii (magazine)|Genii]]'' magazine review that same year. In 2004, the twins released the instructional DVD ''The Dan and Dave System'' which officially separated advanced card flourishing from magic. Three years later in 2007, Dan and Dave released ''The Trilogy'', a three-disc DVD set. Retailing at $85 per unit, ''The Trilogy'' is the best-selling cardistry release of all time, having sold more than 25,000 copies. Virtually every cardist mentions either the ''System'' or ''The Trilogy'' as the source of their inspiration.

==Cardistry-Con==
Cardistry-Con, dubbed CC, is an interactive conference centered around the art of cardistry, where cardists from all over the world can gather and explore the limitless expressive potential of an ordinary deck of playing cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/04/cardistry-con-2015|title=72 Hours Inside the Eye-Popping World of Cardistry|first=Kevin|last=Pang|date=April 21, 2015|website=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|accessdate=November 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event promotes cardistry in an encouraging environment suitable for anyone passionate about the art. The "beta" Cardistry-Con occurred in 2014 as a subsection of Dan &amp; Dave's Magic Con. In 2015, Magic Con was discontinued and an official Cardistry Con took its place. The 2015 CC took place in Brooklyn, New York. With the second annual Cardistry-Con in Berlin, Germany 2016, the Cardistry-Con Championship (CCC) was birthed, allowing cardists to compete in a competitive showcase of skill. The two finalists would be flown out to the event and have their video's screened live. The third annual Cardistry-Con took place in Los Angeles, California 2017.

'''Ceroc''' is an international dance club which has with over 200 venues across the UK as well as national and regional competitions and weekend events throughout the year. It also has franchises in many other countries in Europe, Asia and the antipodes.

The name 'Ceroc' is said to derive from the French "C'est le roc" (it's roc), used to describe rock n' roll dancing in France.

== History ==
Ceroc was created in London, England, by James Cronin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamescronin.co.uk "James Cronin - Dance Coaching"]&lt;/ref&gt; the son of writer [[Vincent Cronin]], and grandson of Scottish author [[A. J. Cronin]]. In January 1980 he held the first ever Ceroc event in [[Porchester Hall]] in London.  By 1982, Ceroc had a [[cabaret]] team that performed routines in London nightclubs and venues. Throughout the spring and summer of 1982, the Ceroc troupe worked with choreographer Michel Ange Lau, whose classes Cronin and Sylvia Coleman had attended at the Centre Charles Peguy, a French youth centre, in [[Leicester Square]]. The first video recording of a Ceroc event appears on the description for the "Gold Bug" routine, performed at the 1982 Ceroc Ball, a charity event, at the [[Hammersmith Palais]].

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Cronin and Sylvia Coleman created [[Ceroc Enterprises]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.howtojive.com/spotlight-ceroc.htm "How to jive - spotlight on Ceroc"]&lt;/ref&gt; registered Ceroc as a trademark&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipo.gov.uk/t-find-number?detailsrequested=H&amp;trademark=1336994 IPO trademark details for "Ceroc"]&lt;/ref&gt; and started to sell Ceroc franchises around the country. In 1992, the Ceroc Teachers Association (CTA) was created, with associated examinations – all Ceroc teachers had to pass the relevant CTA examinations to be licensed to teach at Ceroc events. In 1994, Ceroc introduced 'taxi dancers' to their venues – volunteers who are experienced dancers, designated to assist beginners.

In the early 2000s, Cronin and Coleman sold [[Ceroc Enterprises]] to Mike Ellard, the current owner. By 2004, Ceroc Enterprises were running over 100 different venues, and claimed attendance figures of 500,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceroclondon.com/history_of_ceroc.htm Ceroclondon.com - History of Ceroc] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323151005/http://www.ceroclondon.com/history_of_ceroc.htm |date=March 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Ceroc started expanding into the "Weekender" market.

As of 2008, Ceroc Enterprises has franchises operating in Ireland, France, Italy, Spain, the [[UAE]], Canada, the United States and Hong Kong. As of September 2008, there are over 30 Ceroc franchises running in the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceroc.com/ceroc_links_uk.html Ceroc franchises in the UK] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707103231/http://www.ceroc.com/ceroc_links_uk.html |date=July 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ceroc.com/ceroc_franchising.html Ceroc Franchising information] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825015525/http://ceroc.com/ceroc_franchising.html |date=August 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 150 Ceroc venues there. There are also Ceroc organizations in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Africa and [[Dubai]].&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;{{cite news|date=December 2003 |title=Ceroc &amp;mdash; a new dance craze to get you jiving |author=Clare Bowman |work=[[BBC News]] |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/stoke/music/2003/12/ceroc.shtml |publisher=BBC |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527203005/http://www.bbc.co.uk/stoke/music/2003/12/ceroc.shtml |archivedate=May 27, 2006 }}

&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the franchises described above, there are Ceroc organisations in Australia and New Zealand. Ceroc Enterprises is a separate company to ''Ceroc Australia'' and ''Ceroc and Modern Jive Dance Company'' or CMJ (also based in Australia). These Australian companies are not franchisees of Ceroc Enterprises. Similarly, there is no legal connection between Ceroc Enterprises and ''Ceroc New Zealand''. In November 2013 'Ceroc Australia' was sold to 'Ceroc and Modern Jive Dance Company'' or CMJ to bring them both back under the same umbrella since they split in 1998.

== Modern Jive ==
Outside of the Ceroc Franchise, the dance style [[Modern Jive]] is also taught and danced in many independent venues, where it is commonly called LeRoc. Originally it was the same dance style taught in Ceroc venues and independents, but these have diverged enormously over the last 20 years. However, dancers who have learned at either Ceroc venues or independents can dance together in freestyle, as underneath stylistic differences it is fundamentally the same dance. Ceroc franchise venues often attract a younger demographic than independents, largely because of their branding and that they often recruit younger teachers, however this is by no means ubiquitous.

In 1990, Robert Austin, an original Ceroc franchisee who had broken away from Ceroc to form LeJive, coined the term "Modern Jive". "Modern Jive" is a generic term for the dance form, and is used by teachers and clubs that are not affiliated to Ceroc Enterprise. Ceroc does not recognise the term “Modern Jive”, and Ceroc’s web site states that it teaches dance in general and not a specific dance form.

== Class format ==
Most Ceroc venues run regular classes, every week, usually on Monday through Thursdays.

Ceroc class formats are quite different from most other dance forms, in that:
* Students are typically taught in rows taught from a stage, rather than gathered around the teacher.
* Class sizes are typically larger - often over 100 people per class in some UK venues.
* Classes are highly-structured; a precise routine is taught to the leads who then lead the follows
* Beginner routines are centrally-controlled; each venue teaches the same beginner class on a given day.
* Partners are rotated frequently - typically every couple of minutes - so allowing Ceroc to advertise classes as "no partner required".This helps in the learning process as when you attend a Ceroc lesson you will dance with experienced and beginners alike.  Lessons are organised so that partners are rotated every few minutes, or every couple of moves.&lt;ref name=BBC2 /&gt;
* A small number of volunteer experienced dancers (called ''[[taxi dancer]]s'' or ''taxis'') are often available specifically to dance with beginners.&lt;ref name=Spurrell /&gt;
* Dancers pay for the evening, rather than paying per class.

=== UK format ===
In the UK, the franchise nature of Ceroc enforces a degree of uniformity across all teachers and all venues.&lt;ref name=Spurrell /&gt; Ceroc classes typically follow the same format,&lt;ref name=CerocWhatHappens&gt;{{cite web
 |publisher=Ceroc Enterprises

}} 
&lt;/ref&gt; and comprise:
* A ''Beginners'' lesson, involving a routine of 3 moves drawn from a restricted repertoire of 12 moves,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | publisher = Ceroc
 | url = http://www.ceroclondon.com/?page=12705
 | title = Ceroc London - Dance Routines for Beginners
 | accessdate = 2014-05-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lasting approximately 45 minutes.&lt;ref name=BBC2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CerocWhatHappens /&gt;  The Beginners routine taught on any given day is the same across all teachers and all venues. This is intended to allow beginners to practice what they have learned with beginners from other venues.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}
* A [[Freestyle dance|freestyle]] period of approximately 15 minutes, in which beginners are encouraged to practise what they have learned, and experienced dancers are free to dance whatever they wish.  No moves are barred during a freestyle period, except aerials, and moves are [[improvisation|improvised]] on the spot to the music.  Partner swapping occurs whenever the music changes, and does not require leaving the dance floor.&lt;ref name=BBC2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DT2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CerocWhatHappens /&gt;
* An ''Intermediate'' lesson, involving a routine of 3 moves drawn from a much larger repertoire of Intermediate-level moves, and lasting approximately 45 minutes. At least one of the Intermediate moves will be a ''Classic'' move which is intended for new Intermediate dancers. Many of the harder Intermediate moves are based around these ''Classic'' moves. There are 24 ''Classic'' moves.&lt;ref name=CerocWhatHappens /&gt;  Individual teachers are less constrained as to the content of the intermediate-level lesson.  Intermediate moves are more complex and may contain footwork.&lt;ref name=BBC2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DT1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DT2 /&gt;
* In many venues, depending on available space, a ''Beginners Practice Session'' takes place at the same time, where beginners may review the moves taught in the ''Beginners'' lesson with the help of the taxi dancers.&lt;ref name=CerocWhatHappens /&gt; Beginners may instead watch the Intermediate lesson, if they so choose.  The usual recommendation is for Beginners to complete approximately six Beginners classes before attempting to move up to Intermediate level.&lt;ref name=BBC2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Spurrell /&gt;
* A second freestyle period lasting for the rest of the evening, which is around an hour and a half to two hours.&lt;ref name=BBC2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DT1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CerocWhatHappens /&gt;

The start time varies from venue to venue, but is generally between 7pm and 8pm. Sunday classes often start earlier. Whatever the start time, the entire evening lasts three to four hours in most venues (with rare exceptions).&lt;!-- reference: this can be determined by adding up the above time periods --&gt;

=== Australian format ===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2007}}
A ''Beginner Progression'' [http://www.ceroc.com.au/] class (also known variously as ''Bridging'', ''Beginner Consolidation'', ''Intromediate'' or ''Freestyle class'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20160105124430/http://www.cerocaustralia.com.au/aboutprices.php]) taught at the same time as the ''Intermediate'' or ''Intermediate/Advanced'' class has also been introduced in [[Sydney]], [[Brisbane]], [[Melbourne]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], and [[Adelaide]], involving a breakdown of technique and either a review of the preceding ''Beginner'' class (possibly with some extensions or variations to the moves from that class) or a new routine drawn from a mixture of intermediate and beginner level moves [http://www.ceroc.com.au/classes/beginner-corner.php].  This class is taught at the same time as the ''Intermediate'' class.

Individual teachers are less constrained as to the content of the Intermediate classes, however there is generally a stronger focus on technique (footwork, frame &amp; connection, balance etc.), intermediate skills (dips &amp; drops, leans, spinning etc.) and styling rather than just teaching ''moves''.

A video clip of a Ceroc class filmed in Melbourne can be seen at [https://archive.is/20130418195452/http://www.mindbodysoul.tv/fitness/ceroc-modern-jive.html Mind Body &amp; Soul]

Most Australian schools teach "Step" footwork. See [[Modern Jive#Step footwork vs Rock footwork]]

=== New Zealand format ===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2007}}
In New Zealand there are typically ''Beginners,'' ''Intermediate'' and ''Advanced'' classes, with the clearer separation of moves between the classes. Moving up the classes leads to moves which are more complicated, more syncopated and physically closer. Beginners moves have 2-4 timing, preserve contact between partners at all times, have single speed, single turn spins, the dancers keep their balance (no leans, drops or dips) and partners only contact with each other is hands, arms and shoulders. Intermediate moves introduce single speed double spins and assisted double speed turns, contact with the partners back, and leans (in which one partner takes the others' weight with their body). Advanced moves can include multiple speed, multiple turn spins, loss of contact, significant [[Syncopation (dance)|syncopation]], dips and drops (in which one partner takes the weight of the other with their arms) and/or contact with different body parts.

==Events==

===Freestyles and Tea Dances===
As well as regular class nights, most Ceroc franchises put on special events, termed 'Freestyles', on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.&lt;ref name=BBC2 /&gt; Sunday freestyles are termed 'tea dances' and are often held in the afternoon rather than evening. Some freestyle events begin with an 'icebreaker' class, usually at an intermediate level as beginners are unlikely to attend freestyles.

A typical Saturday night freestyle would begin at either 8pm or 9pm and run until between 12midnight and 2am. Freestyles are usually held at larger venues such as town halls, and often have two rooms: the Main Room, usually the largest room playing up tempo music between 100 and 150BPM; and often a 'Blues Room' or 'Chillout' room, playing slower music between 80 and 110BPM, allowing for slower dancing focusing more on connection, interpretation and musicality.

===Workshops===
Many Ceroc teachers also occasionally run daytime dance workshops at weekends, which in the UK are known as Cerocshops.&lt;ref name=BBC2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CerocShops&gt;{{cite web
 | publisher = Ceroc Enterprises
 | url = http://www.ceroc.org.uk/workshops/cerocshops#cerocshop_info
 | title = Cerocshops
 | accessdate = 2014-05-23 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; A workshop lasts for four hours, and covers more moves than are covered in a single regular evening class. The standard Ceroc workshops are graded (''Beginners 1'', ''Beginners 2'', ''Beginners Plus'', ''Intermediate 1'', ''Intermediate 2'', and ''Intermediate Plus'').&lt;ref name=CerocShops /&gt;
Specialised workshops may also be available which cover more advanced techniques and styles such as ''Dips &amp; Drops'', ''Baby Aerials'', ''Double Trouble'' (one lead, two follows), ''Switch it Up'' (swapping partners),  ''Ceroc to Blues'', ''Footwork'', ''Frame'', ''Spins &amp; Turn technique'', ''Musicality'', ''Connection &amp; Posture''. The frequency and content of these workshops depends on the resident teacher or guest teachers who may teach various workshops over the course of a weekend often with a freestyle party in the evening such as Ceroc Aberdeen's Beach Ballroom Weekend&lt;ref name="Ceroc Aberdeen"&gt;{{cite web
 | publisher = Ceroc Scotland
 | url = http://www.cerocscotland.com/venues?venue=1116
 | title = Ceroc Aberdeen
 | accessdate = 2013-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Ceroc Conexion's Extreme Mini Weekender.&lt;ref name="Ceroc Conexion"&gt;{{cite web

 | url = http://www.cerocconexion.co.uk/?article=7484&amp;page=9280
 | title = Ceroc Conexion
 | accessdate = 2013-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Championships===
Ceroc Enterprises holds an annual UK Ceroc dance championship.&lt;ref name=CerocChamps&gt;{{cite web
 |publisher    = Ceroc Enterprises
 |url          = http://www.cerocchamps.com/index.php
 |title        = Ceroc Championships

 |archive-date = 2008-06-25
 |dead-url     = yes
 |df           = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is held in London (currently at the Watford Colosseum) at the beginning of May&lt;ref name=CerocChamps /&gt; with a mix of freestyle dancing and competitions.&lt;ref name=CerocChamps /&gt; Competitions range from beginner oriented categories, such as the Lucky Dip (a [[Jack and Jill (dance)|Jack and Jill]] competition) and 'Ceroc X' where competitors are restricted to a set list of 8 basic moves, which they have to dance to different musical styles and are judged on performance and musicality.

In recent years, the Intermediate and Advanced Freestyle Categories have been merged into an All Stars category divided into three different age brackets. Above this there is still the Open category, and Top Cats, another Jack and Jill where individual competitors are judged rather than couples. Other categories include Aerials, Showcase, and Team Cabaret competitions.&lt;ref name=CerocChamps /&gt;

There are other championships held on a regional or franchise basis, for example the Midlands, Ceroc Scotland and Welsh champs, and the Australasian.

Ceroc also hosts the European Neo-Blues Championships. This is held at the weekender 'Breeze' at the Pontins at Brean Sands in October, and includes an invitational Masters Jack and Jill, Blues Open, Blues DWAS, and Showcase categories.

=== Weekenders ===
{{refimprove section|date=August 2008}}

Ceroc hosts a number of 'Ceroc Escape' dance weekenders throughout the year, attracting hundreds of dancers from around the UK and Europe. Most of these take place at the Pontins holiday resorts at Camber Sands, Southport and Somerset. Other more luxurious weekenders are held at hotels, such as LUX and Swish. Freestyle dancing begins on the Friday night and carries on through until the Monday morning. During the day a range classes and workshops are available with teachers from around the country. Most events have a Saturday night cabaret, featuring teachers showcase, competition, and showcase performances.

In 2005, Ceroc Enterprises completed the purchase of Rebel Roc, along with its annual dance weekender event at Pontins, Camber Sands. The first such event under the ownership of Ceroc Enterprises was Ceroc "Storm" at [[Camber Sands]] in March 2006. Ceroc Enterprises has been expanding its weekender offerings, and has taken over weekender venues from JiveTime (Camber Sands) at the end of 2007, and Jive Addiction ([[Southport]]) in August 2008.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Controversies surrounding ''Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2''}}
''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]'' is a [[first-person shooter]] video game developed by [[Infinity Ward]] and published by [[Activision]]. Released worldwide on November 10, 2009, it generated several controversies. In the game's fourth [[level (video gaming)|level]], "[[No Russian]]", the player controls an undercover [[CIA]] agent who participates in a [[mass shooting]] at a [[Moscow]] airport to gain the trust of a Russian [[terrorist]] group. This level was largely criticized for allowing players to partake in a terrorist attack, and international versions of the game were subject to censorship due to the level's content. Allegations of [[Homophobia|homophobic]] content arose when Infinity Ward released a video titled "Fight Against Grenade Spam". Some video game journalists chastised the video's use of [[profanity]], and that the video's title forms the [[acronym]] [[faggot (slang)|F.A.G.S.]], a pejorative for gay people. In response, Infinity Ward removed the video from [[YouTube]]. An [[easter egg (media)|easter egg]] referencing the United States policy "[[don't ask, don't tell]]" was also seen as homophobic, though most journalists belittled these allegations. The [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] version of the game was also met with criticism from players, when it was revealed that the game would not support dedicated [[game server|servers]] among a litany of other changes. Windows players created an [[online petition]] to allow for dedicated servers, receiving over 150,000 signatures in ten days. However, despite these controversies, ''Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2'' grossed [[United States dollar|$]]310 million in its first day of release.

In the game's fourth [[level (video gaming)|level]], "No Russian", the player controls an undercover [[CIA]] agent who participates in a [[mass shooting]] at a [[Moscow]] airport to gain the trust of a Russian [[terrorist]] group.&lt;ref name="After 911"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yin-Poole|first=Wesley|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-03-15-call-of-duty-no-russian-actors-tearful|title=Call of Duty No Russian actors "tearful"|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=March 15, 2011|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It begins with the player walking out of an elevator with four other gunmen, who proceed to open fire on a large group of civilians at a [[airport security|security checkpoint]].&lt;ref name="After 911"&gt;{{cite book|last=Payne|first=Matthew|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=phj-CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=closing+the+perspectival+distance+in+%22no+russian%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eg4rbjJI8W&amp;sig=ooiIRfjqF2Q2CP99uO1TKj9wjQw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwik1d-dzJzOAhUTwWMKHReGD4gQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=closing%20the%20perspectival%20distance%20in%20%22no%20russian%22&amp;f=false|title=Playing War: Military Video Games After 9/11|chapter=The First-Personal Shooter|publisher=[[New York University Press]]|date=April 2016|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player then accompanies the gunmen as they walk through the airport, killing any remaining civilians. The only legitimate targets are a group of security personnel encountered in waves throughout the airport interior, and a more heavily armed gang of riot squad members deployed on the tarmac. The level is very graphic, as screams can be heard throughout, and the injured crawl away leaving blood trails.&lt;ref name="Artful"&gt;{{cite web|last=Peckham|first=Matt|authorlink=Matt Peckham|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/181140/modern_warfare_2_artful.html|title=Is Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 Terrorist Gameplay Artful?|work=[[PC World]]|date=November 2, 2009|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the player is never forced to partake in the massacre, and may instead let their comrades kill the civilians. If the player does not feel comfortable during the level, they are allowed to skip to the next level with no penalties.&lt;ref name="That Time"&gt;{{cite web|last=Klepek|first=Patrick|url=http://kotaku.com/that-time-call-of-duty-let-you-shoot-up-an-airport-1738376241|title=

Prior to the release of ''Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2'', footage taken from the "No Russian" level was leaked on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thorsen|first=Tor|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/modern-warfare-2-massacre-not-representative-of-overall-experience-activision/1100-6238331/|title=Modern Warfare 2 massacre 'not representative of overall experience' - Activision|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=October 29, 2009|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though some journalists were cautious towards the level's content, they decided to wait until they could actually play the level to judge its merits.&lt;ref name="Artful"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoggins|first=Tom|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/6460444/Call-Of-Duty-Modern-Warfare-2-leaked-footage-analysis.html|title=Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 leaked footage analysis|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=October 29, 2009|accessdate=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wildgoose|first=David|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2009/11/monday-musings-war-games/|title=Monday Musings: War Games|work=[[Kotaku|Kotaku Australia]]|date=November 2, 2009|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the game's release, "No Russian" was largely criticized for allowing players to partake in a terrorist attack. Vince Horiuchi of ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'' felt that the level was in poor taste following the [[2009 Fort Hood shooting]], and questioned why the level couldn't have been told through a non-interactive [[cutscene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Horiuchi|first=Vince|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/story.php?ref=/technology/ci_13799461|title=Oh My Tech: 'Call of Duty' has troubling scene|work=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|date=November 16, 2009|accessdate=December 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marc Cieslak of [[BBC News]] was saddened by "No Russian", as he felt it disproved his theory that the [[video game industry]] had "grown up".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Orry|first=James|url=http://www.videogamer.com/xbox360/cod_modern_warfare_2/news/bbc_reporter_saddened_but_not_shocked_by_mw2.html|title=BBC reporter 'saddened' but not 'shocked' by MW2|publisher=VideoGamer.com|date=November 10, 2009|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several prominent British religious leaders condemned "No Russian": [[Alexander Goldberg]] of the [[London Jewish Forum]] was worried that children would play the level; Fazan Mohammed of the [[British Muslim Forum]] described the level as an intimate experience of enacting terrorism; and [[Stephen Lowe (bishop of Hulme)|Stephen Lowe]], the retired [[Bishop of Hulme]], felt that the level was "sickening".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ingham|first=Tim|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/religious-leaders-slam-modern-warfare-2|title=Religious leaders slam Modern Warfare 2|work=[[The Market for Computer &amp; Video Games]]|date=November 16, 2009|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the graphic content featured in "No Russian", ''Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2'' was subject to censorship in international versions of the game, including the entire removal of the level from the Russian version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Welsh|first=Oli|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/activision-chose-to-censor-russian-mw2|title=Activision chose to censor Russian MW2|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=November 17, 2009|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ashcraft|first=Brian|url=http://kotaku.com/5422287/modern-warfare-2-censored-in-japan|title=Modern Warfare 2 Censored In Japan|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=December 9, 2009|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of homophobic content==
In October 2009, Infinity Ward posted a video titled "Fight Against Grenade Spam" on [[YouTube]]. In the video, professional baseball player [[Cole Hamels]] delivers a [[public service announcement]] that advocates against the use of grenade [[Spam (gaming)|spam]]. Hamels uses [[profanity]] in the video, calling grenade spam "for [[pussy#weakness|pussies]]", and says "what the fuck" when he is blown up with grenades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sarkar|first=Samit|url=https://www.destructoid.com/cole-hamels-pussies-use-random-mw2-grenades-update--153686.phtml|title=Cole Hamels: 'Pussies' use random MW2 grenades (Update)|work=[[Destructoid]]|date=October 30, 2009|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kotaku 1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Good|first=Owen|url=http://kotaku.com/5394032/cole-hamels-reminds-you-that-grenades-are-for-pussies|title=Cole Hamels Reminds You That Grenades are "for Pussies"|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=October 30, 2009|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the video was released, it was quickly discovered that the video's title forms the [[acronym]] [[faggot (slang)|F.A.G.S.]], which is a pejorative term against [[gay]] people.&lt;ref name="Gamasutra"&gt;{{cite web|last=Graft|first=Kris|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/116843/Infinity_Ward_Pulls_Modern_Warfare_2_Video_Amid_Criticism.php|title=Infinity Ward Pulls ''Modern Warfare 2'' Video Amid Criticism|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|date=November 2, 2009|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phillip Kollar of ''[[Game Informer]]'' criticized that the title's acronym and use of profanity, and felt that Infinity Ward was condoning homophobic slurs.&lt;ref name="Kotaku 2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Good|first=Owen|url=http://kotaku.com/5394595/infinity-ward-removes-modern-warfare-2-fags-video|title=Infinity Ward Removes Modern Warfare 2 "F.A.G.S." Video|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=November 1, 2009|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freelance]] journalist Mitchell Dyer echoed Kollar's statement, and commented that the video "seems to enforce the asshole-ry" of homophobic slurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sarkar|first=Samit|url=https://www.destructoid.com/infinity-ward-pulls-mw2-hamels-video-after-internet-furor-153731.phtml|title=Infinity Ward pulls MW2 Hamels video after Internet furor|work=[[Destructoid]]|date=October 31, 2016|accessdate=August 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the backlash, Infinity Ward community manager Robert Bowling remarked that while the video was intended to be a [[social commentary]] joke, he understood why people found it offensive, and removed the video from YouTube.&lt;ref name="Gamasutra"/&gt;

Further allegations of homophobic content arose when a [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] was discovered in the game's opening [[tutorial]] level. If the player remains idle for a brief period of time, they are able to hear one soldier ask another soldier about his sexuality, and then remark "don't ask, don't tell".&lt;ref name="Destructoid Easter Egg"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sterling|first=Jim|authorlink=Jim Sterling|url=https://www.destructoid.com/modern-warfare-2-has-a-homophobic-easter-egg--156677.phtml|title=Modern Warfare 2 has a homophobic Easter egg!?|work=[[Destructoid]]|date=December 2, 2009|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Register Easter Egg"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sherwood|first=James|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/12/09/mw2_gay/|title=''Modern Warfare 2'' hit by anti-gay claim|work=[[The Register]]|date=December 9, 2009|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This easter egg references the United States policy "[[Don't ask, don't tell]]", which prevented openly gay people from serving in the [[United States Armed Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bumiller|first=Elizabeth|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/23/us/23military.html|title=Obama Ends 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' Policy|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 22, 2011|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the "Fight Against Grenade Spam" video, few journalists commented on the easter egg. [[Jim Sterling]] of ''[[Destructoid]]'' felt that the easter egg was "too silly/stupid" for him to be angry at,&lt;ref name="Destructoid Easter Egg"/&gt; while James Sherwood of ''[[The Register]]'' commented that people were trying to generate controversy over unimportant dialogue.&lt;ref name="The Register Easter Egg"/&gt; Lyle Masaki of [[Logo TV]]'s NewNowNext.com deemed the easter egg to be homophobic, but not representative of the game as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Masaki|first=Lyle|url=http://www.newnownext.com/what-does-a-homophobic-joke-tell-us-about-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2/12/2009/|title=What does a homophobic joke tell us about "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2"?|publisher=[[Logo TV|NewNowNext.com]]|date=December 9, 2009|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the Windows version==
In a [[webcast]] conducted prior to the game's release, Bowling revealed that the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] version of ''Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2'' would not support dedicated [[Game server|servers]], and would instead be powered by the IWNet server.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Martin|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/10/19/no-dedicated-servers-for-pc-mw2|title=No Dedicated Servers For PC MW2|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=October 19, 2009|accessdate=August 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infinity Ward would go on to state that the Windows version would also lack [[Command (computing)|console commands]], not support [[multiplayer]] matches larger than 18 players, and the inability for players to ban other players who are [[Cheating in online games|cheating]].&lt;ref name="arstechnica1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kuchera|first=Ben|authorlink=Ben Kuchera|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2009/11/pc-modern-warfare-2-its-much-worse-than-you-thought/|title=PC Modern Warfare 2: it's much worse than you thought|work=[[Ars Technica]]|date=November 5, 2009|accessdate=November 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These decisions angered many Windows gamers, with Ben Kuchera of ''[[Ars Technica]]'' commenting: "at launch, this will be one of the most locked-down, inflexible, and gamer-unfriendly game ever created."&lt;ref name="arstechnica1"/&gt; An [[online petition]] was created to have Infinity Ward allow dedicated servers, which surpassed 150,000 signatures in ten days.&lt;ref name="Ars Technica"&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson|first=Michael|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2009/10/modern-warfare-2-the-case-for-the-dedicated-server/|title=Modern Warfare 2: the case for the dedicated server|work=[[Ars Technica]]|date=October 29, 2016|accessdate=August 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, users on [[Amazon.com]] submitted over 125 one-star reviews for the Windows version of the game.&lt;ref name="1UP"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pereira|first=Chris|url=http://www.1up.com/news/gamers-hate-modern-warfare-2|title=Why Do PC Gamers Hate Modern Warfare 2's New Matchmaking System?|work=[[1UP.com]]|date=October 21, 2009|accessdate=August 5, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609144750/http://www.1up.com/news/gamers-hate-modern-warfare-2|archivedate=June 9, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Griffiths, [[CEO]] of Activision, stated that while Infinity Ward was aware of the petition, they weren't overly worried.

"'''Criminal'''" is a song by American recording artist [[Britney Spears]] from her seventh studio album, ''[[Femme Fatale (Britney Spears album)|Femme Fatale]]'' (2011). The song was released as the fourth and final single from the album. "Criminal" was written and produced by [[Max Martin]] and [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]], with additional writing by Tiffany Amber. After Spears first listened to the song, she felt it was different and unlike anything she had heard before. She posted a snippet of it online on March 2, 2011, prior to the album's release. "Criminal" was chosen as a single by a poll on her [[Facebook]] page, as Spears explained it was a way to give back to her fans. The artwork for the single was released on September 14, 2011.

"Criminal" is a [[guitar]] and [[synth]]-driven mid-tempo pop ballad which incorporates a [[Folk music|folk]]-style flute melody. It is considered the only ballad on ''Femme Fatale'', and is less aggressive than the other songs of the album. "Criminal" is influenced by the works of [[ABBA]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. In the song, Spears sings about being in love with a [[Bad boy (archetype)|bad boy]] and [[outlaw]], and pleads to her mother to not worry about their relationship. "Criminal" received critical acclaim, with reviewers praising its organic and refreshing feel in comparison with the rest of the album. After the release of ''Femme Fatale'', the song charted on the South Korean International chart. "Criminal" has also charted in major markets such as Canada, France, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States.

The accompanying music video for the song was filmed at [[Dalston]] and [[Stoke Newington]], London. It features Spears as a woman in upper society and follows her relationship with a criminal, played by her then real-life boyfriend Jason Trawick. Prior to its release, London officials criticized Spears for shooting scenes with a replica gun and glamorizing violence. The video received a positive response from critics, with some calling it the best music video from ''Femme Fatale''. Reviewers also noted the parallels between the storyline and themes of the video with Spears's personal life.

==Background==
"Criminal" was written in 2008 by Max Martin, Shellback and Tiffany Amber, and was produced by Martin and Shellback.&lt;ref name=threeyears/&gt;&lt;ref name=liner&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=Femme Fatale |others=Britney Spears|year=2011 |type=liner notes |publisher=[[Jive Records]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spears told [[MTV News]] that after she first listened to the song, she felt it was different and unlike anything she had heard before.&lt;ref name=announce&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1669925/britney-spears-next-single-criminal.jhtml|title=Britney Spears Reveals Next Single At VMAs|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|last2=Montgomery|first2=James|date=August 28, 2011|accessdate=August 29, 2011|publisher=MTV.

In the verses, Spears sings about being in love with a bad boy and outlaw, in lyrics such as "He is a hustler / He's no good at all / He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, bum" and "He is a bad boy with a tainted heart / And even I know this ain't smart".

Sarah Zupko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Leahey of ''[[The Washington Times]]'' and Erin Thompson of the ''Seattle Weekly'' compared the lyrics to those of Madonna's "[[Papa Don't Preach]]" (1986), while David Bunachan compared them to [[Coolio]]'s "Mama I'm in Love Wit' a Gangsta" (1994).&lt;ref name=seattleweekly/&gt;&lt;ref name=cos/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/mar/28/britneys-latest-new-life/|title=Listening Station: Britney’s latest new life|last=Leahey|first=Andrew|date=March 28, 2011|accessdate=April 9, 2011|work=[[The Washington Times]]|publisher=[[News World Media Development]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The words in the chorus end in 'al's syllables, as evident in lyrics such as "And this type of love isn't rational / It's physical". Keith Caufield noted that they were an unintentional nod to [[Supertramp]]'s "[[The Logical Song]]" (1979).&lt;ref name=bbffrw/&gt; Thompson stated that Spears's vocals are less processed than on the rest of the album, while according to Amy Sciarretto they are "heavily [[Auto-Tune|auto-tuned]] and studio-treated, [...] she delivers her lines in a monotone, robotic fashion."&lt;ref name=seattleweekly/&gt;&lt;ref name=popcrush/&gt;

==Critical reception==
Criminal received critical acclaim from [[music critics]]. Andy Gill of ''[[The Independent]]'' called it one of the highlights of ''Femme Fatale'', along with "[[Till the World Ends]]". Gill also said that the album sounds more programmed than natural, commenting that "indeed, such is the shock when the final track, 'Criminal', opens with a little folksong-style flute and guitar figure that one's immediate reaction is that a [[Midlake]] soundfile has been accidentally appended to Britney's running-order."&lt;ref name=independent&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/album-britney-spears-femme-fatale-jive-2251912.html|title=Album: Britney Spears, Femme Fatale (Jive)|last=Gill|first=Andy|date=March 25, 2011|accessdate=April 8, 2011|work=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush gave the song four stars, explaining that "Only Brit can make a flute sound sexy.

When they get to his house, it is revealed by a newspaper that he is a criminal. She opens one of the lockers in his house and finds a gun, after which the couple kisses. This is followed by scenes of them having sex.

The next morning, the criminal brings Spears breakfast to the bed and kisses her on the forehead. He has several tattoos in his body, including one on his chest that reads "R.I.P. Goose", a reference to the film ''[[Top Gun]]'' (1986).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dose.ca/music/Britney+Spears+Jason+Trawick+Debut+Criminal+Video+Really+Tattoos/5567497/story.html?cid=dose_nav_drop|title=Britney Spears and Jason Trawick Debut 'Criminal' Video, Really Bad Tattoos|work=[[Dose (magazine)|Dose]]|publisher=[[Postmedia Network]]|date=October 18, 2011|first=Leah|last=Collins|accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They go to a convenience store where she steals vanilla candles and points the gun to the employee; the criminal takes money out of the cash register and they escape by stealing a [[Citroën DS3]].&lt;ref name=idolatormv/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landingpage.citroen.com/ |date=22 October 2011 |archivedate=22 October 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62d9GPfE5?url=http://www.landingpage.citroen.com/ |title=Citroën Landing Page |publisher=[[Citroën]] |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The robbery is caught by the security cameras, and pictures of the couple appear on the local news. There are scenes of them having sex in the shower. As they change clothes, several policemen then appear outside the criminal's house; they start shooting it with [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5]]'s as Spears and the man embrace, kissing passionately. The policemen then enter the house, and one of them confirms that the couple escaped. The video ends with Spears and the criminal escaping on the motorcycle as the credits roll. One of them reads "No vanilla candles were harmed in the making of this music video." The video also includes intercut scenes of Spears performing dance moves similar to [[Vogue (dance)|voguing]].&lt;ref name=idolatormv/&gt;

===UK controversy===
[[File:Diane Abbott, New Statesman hustings, trimmed.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Hackney North and Stoke Newington (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Diane Abbott]] said that Spears contributed to the glamorization of guns with the video.&lt;ref name=hackney/&gt;]]
After pictures of Spears and Trawick carrying replica guns on set surfaced online, the [[Hackney London Borough Council]] criticized her for "promoting gun violence", since the area had been badly affected by the [[2011 England riots]]. The Council told ''[[London Tonight]]'' that they had not agreed to the use of replica guns at Stoke Newington Town Hall, and that they would be raising the matter with the production company. Councillor Ian Rathbone added that Spears should apologize and make a sizeable donation to a Hackney charity "for the rudeness and damage she's done to this community." When asked if she thought the council was overreacting, [[Hackney North and Stoke Newington (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Diane Abbott]] insisted: "It is only a music video but it's images like this, with popstars glamorising gangs, which means that some young people... get drawn in. Britney should really know better."&lt;ref name=hackney/&gt; Rae Alexandra of the ''[[SF Weekly]]'' explained that the United Kingdom "is not a place that readily embraces guns. Rather, it's a place where guns are rare, gun licensing is tightly controlled, and the entire establishment has been in a panic about gun use on its streets for the last three years."&lt;ref name=sfweekly&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.sfweekly.com/shookdown/2011/10/britney_and_rihanna_debut_new.php|title=Britney and Rihanna Debut New Videos – and Anti-English Sentiments|last=Alexandra|first=Rae|date=October 25, 2011|accessdate=October 21, 2011|work=[[SF Weekly]]|publisher=Village Voice Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 26, 2011, Spears' representatives released a statement to MTV News saying, "The video is a fantasy story featuring Britney's boyfriend, Jason Trawick, which literally plays out the lyrics of a song written three years before the riots ever happened."&lt;ref name=threeyears&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1671542/britney-spears-criminal-video-gun-criticism-response.jhtml|title=Britney Spears Responds To 'Criminal' Video Controversy|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=September 26, 2011|accessdate=September 30, 2011|publisher=MTV.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Holding the gun became a controversial thing 'cause we filmed it in London, and they don't have a lot of gun use out there. That doesn't mean that there's no gun use, so I did find it really interesting. For me, the thing is, it blew me away that members of [the British] Parliament were speaking about this. One, because it's a music video, and two, because don't you guys have television shows out there that show crime? It's really strange to me. I don't understand why pop stars are put on such a high pedestal over other celebrities. Why do members of Parliament feel that they need to scrutinize her for having a gun, and 'She's in the public,' and 'She should know better,' and 'She's a role model,' but what about every other celebrity out there? What about every other actor? That's very strange to me. I was really surprised at how much the gun use was scrutinized. [Trawick plays] a professional criminal, so it makes sense he has a gun. We shouldn't censor ourselves."&lt;ref name=pilierogun&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1672848/britney-spears-criminal-director-gun.jhtml|title=Britney Spears' 'Criminal' Director Talks Gun Controversy|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|last2=White Wolf|first2=Vanessa|date=October 20, 2011|accessdate=October 25, 2011|publisher=MTV.

The reviewer found the scenes of physical abuse "surprising" and called the acting "stiff", but said that "from there on out, we're in the usual comfort zone of a Britney video – sexy dancing, sexy vamping – with the added bonus of gratuitous PDA between the pop star and her real-life boyfriend."&lt;ref name=rsmr&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/videos/new-and-hot/britney-spears-criminal-20111018|title=Video: 'Criminal'|work=Rolling Stone|date=October 18, 2011|accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The critic summarized the review by saying that the video is "entertaining [as] a bad-girl adventure story, and her role here is essentially that of a (wait for it) [[femme fatale]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.vh1.com/2011-10-20/britney-spears-makes-news-in-criminal/|title=Britney Spears Makes The News, Makes Out In "Criminal"|publisher=VH1.

===Themes and analysis===
[[File:Rihanna, LOUD Tour, Belfast cropped 2.jpg|thumb|165px|left|The plot and themes of the video received comparisons to that of [[Rihanna]]'s "[[We Found Love (music video)|We Found Love]]", which premiered two days after "Criminal".&lt;ref name=pdrihanna/&gt;]]
Alyssa Rosenberg of [[ThinkProgress]] said that although it is common to see pop stars being assaulted by men in their videos —exemplifying [[Rihanna]]'s "[[Man Down (song)|Man Down]]"— the public is aware of Spears's vulnerability, explaining that "we believe she really would choose a guy who would do something like this to her." Rosenberg also stated even though her bad behaviour once she leaves her boyfriend is not directed at him, the fact that he treated her badly is a form of narrative permission for her to rob a store and have sex with the criminal. She also commented that the same narrative works on her previous video with Marrs Piliero for "I Wanna Go".&lt;ref name=think&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thinkprogress.org/alyssa/2011/10/19/346770/the-vulnerabilities-of-britney-spears/|title=The Vulnerabilities Of Britney Spears|first=Rosenberg|last=Alyssa|publisher=[[ThinkProgress]]. [[Center for American Progress]]|date=October 21, 2011|accessdate=October 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video received comparisons to Rihanna's "[[We Found Love]]", which was released two days after "Criminal", on October 19, 2011.&lt;ref name=sfweekly/&gt;&lt;ref name=pdrihanna/&gt; Among the similarities, critics noted that they were both filmed in the United Kingdom and arose controversy in the country; both contain scenes of sex, violence and crime; both feature bad boy archetypes and both evoke the personal lives of the artists.&lt;ref name=pdrihanna&gt;{{cite web|url=http://popdust.com/2011/10/24/rihanna-britney-spears-personal-lives-videos/|title=Britney Spears, Rihanna, And the Videos Ripped From the Rumors|first=Katherine|last=St Asaph|publisher=Popdust. Popdust LLC|date=October 24, 2011|accessdate=October 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Katherine St Asaph found the opening line of Spears's boyfriend ("Would you try smiling ''just once''?") a subtle dig at the press. She explained that there is a tendency among writers and spectators to call "her every smile plastered on or [[Conservatorship|conservator]]-mandated", and that the fact the line is delivered by her abusive boyfriend only makes it more evident. According to her, that there are two contradictory ways to analyze the relationship between Spears and Trawick as the criminal: it could be seen as him luring her into her life, but Spears is the one that kisses him and she is the first to pull the gun.&lt;ref name=pdrihanna/&gt;

St Asaph explained that the only interpretation of the video lies on the opinion of each viewer about Spears's personal life, and how active a role each person imagines she plays in it. It was noted by St Asaph that although most pop stars release videos that draw from their personal lives, they do not make the viewer uncomfortable. The same cannot be said for Spears and Rihanna, and it does not matter if they themselves have moved on from past situations, because the discussion around them has not. St Asaph also expressed that neither Spears or Rihanna said much about the parallels to their lives, but that they do not need to: their videos are much more effective than anything they could reveal in an interview.&lt;ref name=pdrihanna/&gt; Rae Alexandra of the ''SF Weekly'' also compared it to "We Found Love", saying that both videos feature an [[anti-British sentiment]]. She wrote that all the villains in the video – her boyfriend and the policemen – are British, whereas her savior in the video is an American criminal. Alexandra noted that Spears and Rihanna chose to films their "grittiest videos" in a country with a lower [[crime rate]] than the United States, that is also so against guns that politicians felt the need to talk about it. According to her, the videos continue with a [[xenophobic]] portrayal of British people as villains by American [[popular culture|pop culture]].&lt;ref name=sfweekly/&gt;

One of the most common "dad jokes" goes as follows:  A child will say to the dad, "I'm hungry,"  to which the dad will reply, "Hi, Hungry, I'm Dad." Many dad jokes may be considered [[Anti-humor|anti-jokes]], deriving humour from an intentionally unfunny punchline.

==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
Christoph Nord&lt;ref&gt;''Maverick #2''&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[East Germany]] to American parents. His early history is clouded in mystery, though there are whispers that his parents were involved with the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime.&lt;ref&gt;''Maverick'' #9&lt;/ref&gt; He also had an older brother, Andreas.&lt;ref name="flashbacks"&gt;as told in flashbacks in ''X-Men Unlimited'' #15 and ''Maverick'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], Christoph possessed the ability to absorb [[kinetic energy]] through impact with little to no harm.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cell Six===
A self-described idealist, he fought against the [[communist]] regime during the height of the [[Cold War]], joining a [[West Germany|West German]] black ops unit named '''Cell Six'''. On a mission in [[Italy]], he was injured by a rival [[assassination|assassin]] codenamed the Confessor.&lt;ref name="maverick2"&gt;as told in flashback in ''Maverick'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

While recovering, he met an Italian nurse, Ginetta Barsalini, whom he fell in love with and married. Over the next three years, Cell Six's field agents were eliminated one by one, except for Nord. Nord realized Ginetta was a spy. Threatening to shoot her, he demanded to know her employer. Saying he didn't have the guts to shoot a defenseless woman in cold blood, she lunged at him with a knife, causing him to shoot her in [[self-defense]]. Dying, she revealed that in killing her, he also killed their unborn child. Long after this incident, Nord continues to be wracked with guilt about the betrayal and still seeks answers as to whom Barsalini was working for. This watershed moment left Nord cold and distrusting of everyone, especially women.&lt;ref name="maverick2"/&gt;

===Weapon X===
Fueled by the betrayal, North became one of the most efficient covert operatives in Germany. In the 1960s, his exploits caught the attention of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], who offered him a spot in the clandestine [[Team X (comics)|Team X]]. He agreed, and at this time, changed his name to '''David North'''.&lt;ref name="maverick2"/&gt; As a part of Team X, he was one of the several mutant operatives the government experimented on and exploited. Each member unknowingly received false memory implants,&lt;ref name="wolverine62"&gt;''Wolverine'' #62-64&lt;/ref&gt; and North received a slight healing factor culled from Logan's [[DNA]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine Annual'' (September 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; North's immediate team consisted of three field agents: North, Logan (who later became [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]), and Victor Creed (who later became [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]). The mutant [[Teleportation|teleport]]er John Wraith also referred to as [[Kestrel (Marvel Comics)|Kestrel]], served as the team's intelligence man and extractor. It was at this time that North began wearing his signature yellow and black faceplate.

On a mission in East Germany, both Creed and Logan were badly injured. Rather than follow protocol and leave them, North dragged them to the extraction point. Cornered by Andreas Nord, now an assassin, North saved his teammates the only way he could; killing his own brother in cold blood. Because of this incident, Logan holds North in very high regard.&lt;ref name="flashbacks"/&gt;

Another mission saw the three agents confront [[Omega Red]] in Berlin. They succeeded in stealing the [[Adamantium#Carbonadium|carbonadium]] synthesizer, which was necessary for the Russian to control his death factor [[pheromone]]. Taking down the [[psychopath]]ic Omega Red was not as easy. In the chaos, Creed panicked, killing Janice Hollenback, the CIA [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] they were attempting to rescue. The team then escaped by jumping from a ten-story window. The synthesizer was thought lost, and a rift formed between Creed and Logan due to Creed's actions on the mission. Unbeknownst to the agency, Logan had recovered the synthesizer and hid it. North suspected as much at the time but did not know for sure.&lt;ref&gt;as told in flashbacks in ''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #5 and ''Wolverine'' #60&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1970s, Team X was summarily disbanded. However, the team's agents were captured by [[Weapon X]] to be used as test subjects. When Logan underwent the adamantium bonding, he went on a murderous rampage, allowing North and the others to escape. Around this time, North inexplicably lost his powers. Undaunted, North continued to work in espionage as a mercenary using the trade name Maverick. The inspiration for the name had come from a conversation in which North boasted that he neither trusted nor needed anyone, to which Logan responded, "A regular maverick, eh?"&lt;ref name="maverick2"/&gt;

===Mercenary===
Time passed and Maverick developed a reputation as one of the best-hired guns available. Maverick compensated for his lack of powers with meticulous planning and a reliance on the latest technology.

He worked for private parties and governmental agencies alike, taking several contracts from retired Major Arthur Barrington, the man who had brought North into the CIA. When Omega Red captured Wolverine as well as several of the [[X-Men]] in Berlin in an effort to locate the carbonadium synthesizer, Maverick was sent in by Barrington. Maverick helped free the captive X-Men and tracked Sabretooth to Omega Red. With the X-Men's help, he obtained the device from Wolverine and hid it once again. Maverick aided the X-Men in combat against Sabretooth, Omega Red, [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]], and [[Matsu'o Tsurayaba]]. During the course of this incident, Maverick murders apparently Dr. [[Abraham Cornelius]] in cold blood.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #5-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Barrington later sent him to acquire the Xavier Files, profiles of the powers and weaknesses of various mutants, which were compiled by the X-Men's founder. Maverick battled [[Warhawk (Marvel Comics)|Warhawk]] and killed Dr. Alexander Ryking. In the clash, Warhawk exploded, seemingly destroying the files.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #10-11&lt;/ref&gt; Maverick was later hired by the US government to protect Aldo Ferro, a former Weapon X member. Former Team X alumni sought Ferro out after [[Mastodon (comics)|Mastodon]] died when his age suppression factor reversed. Unbeknownst to Team X, Ferro was the second Psi-Borg and was responsible for the planting of false memories during their time with Weapon X. Betrayed by Ferro, Maverick then sided with his former teammates Wolverine, Sabretooth, [[Silver Fox (comics)|Silver Fox]], and John Wraith, and Ferro was seemingly killed in the subsequent battle.&lt;ref name="wolverine62"/&gt;

Maverick next sought to kill Sabretooth, who was in the midst of a psychotic murderous rampage following the death of Birdy. First seeking Wolverine to aid him in this goal, he reluctantly aids the X-Men in merely capturing Sabretooth, setting in motion what became a failed attempt by Charles Xavier to rehabilitate the serial killer.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men Unlimited'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy Virus===
Maverick swiftly contracted the [[Legacy Virus]]. This development brought about the random return of his powers but also a loss of energy and horrible scarring all over his body. He tried to convince Wolverine to kill him, but Wolverine refused. Maverick decided to make the best of it, and "fight the good fight."&lt;ref name="wolverine87"&gt;''Wolverine'' #87&lt;/ref&gt; His health declining, he travelled the world from [[safe house]] to safe house, using his savings to procure treatment for his infection.

During this time, he recruited a very unstable Wolverine to help him rescue [[Deadpool]]. Maverick was attacked by a group led by [[Slayback]] at his Manhattan safe house. Maverick managed to escape to the X-Mansion and spent several hours in a coma. After coming to, Maverick revealed that he and Deadpool had been targeted because both were mutants with healing factors taken from Wolverine's DNA template. Maverick felt they would soon come for Wolverine directly. Deadpool was being experimented on in an attempt to create a cure for the Legacy Virus. Maverick and Wolverine located and rescued Deadpool. It was later discovered by [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] that Deadpool's body could not generate a cure.&lt;ref name="annual"&gt;''Wolverine Annual''(September, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

While in New York, he saved a fellow Legacy Virus-positive mutant, teenager [[Chris Bradley]] and his family from an attack by the [[Friends of Humanity]]. The FOH retaliated by firebombing Bradley's home, spurring Maverick to use his connections to relocate the Bradley family to Florida under aliases. He also got Chris medical treatment and set his parents up with new jobs.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men Unlimited'' #15&lt;/ref&gt;

He then left for [[Canada]]. While there, former [[KGB]] agent and mutant [[telepath]] Elena Ivanova found him, demanding he helps her track down Sabretooth, who had killed her mother during his Weapon X years. Before he could answer her, they were attacked by Omega Red, who had tracked Ivanova to Maverick in hopes of recovering the carbonadium synthesizer. With the help of John Wraith, they succeeded in keeping the device away from the villain.&lt;ref&gt;''Maverick:In the Shadow of Death''&lt;/ref&gt;

Ivanova felt that she owed Maverick and stuck by his side, despite his icy demeanor. They travelled together for a time. The Legacy Virus then took hold, killing North. Ivanova used her powers to resuscitate him. To their surprise, the virus seemingly went into [[remission (medicine)|remission]], all of his wounds from the virus were healed. His powers not only returned but were enhanced. Also, Weapon X's memory implants were cleared from his mind. He would later realize that the Legacy Virus made his new powers inconsistent, at times making them a danger to himself. Immediately, trouble found them in the form of Russian mob boss Ivan Pushkin, who sent his enforcers Hammer and Sickle to abduct them.&lt;ref name="maverick1"&gt;''Maverick'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Pushkin used Ivanova's powers in an attempt to brainwash Maverick into killing Major Arthur Barrington by making him believe it was Barrington who had set up Barsalini's betrayal all those years ago. In reality, Barrington was to deliver testimony at an inquest that would have been damaging to Pushkin's business interests. Attacking but not killing Barrington, Maverick quickly regained his senses. While he blinded the left eye of Sickle with his own weapon, Hammer killed Barrington.&lt;ref&gt;''Maverick'' #2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Chris Bradley ran away from home, missing his girlfriend in New York. The FOH tapped his friends' phone and when he reached New York, they again tried to kill Chris. Maverick, Ivanova, and Wolverine saved him and his friend. Ivanova then used her abilities to make the FOH and Chris' girlfriend think he'd died in the scuffle. Both shaken by the life-threatening events of the past few days, Ivanova and North's relationship, platonic up to this point, became physical.&lt;ref&gt;''Maverick'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

The following morning, Ivanova still expressed the desire to go after Sabretooth. Maverick harshly warned that an assault against Sabretooth was a fool's errand, and implied she'd slept with him to coerce him to aid her goal. Angered, Ivanova left Maverick that night to continue her vendetta. A regretful Maverick traced Ivanova's steps and found her as she was rendered comatose by Sabretooth's assault. Maverick stopped Sabretooth from delivering the killing blow and left a badly injured Ivanova in the care of the Bradley family.&lt;ref&gt;''Maverick'' #5-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Maverick then renewed his vendetta with Ivan Pushkin, desperate to avenge Barrington's death. Pushkin captured Maverick, hoping to coerce Maverick to work for him. Maverick, however, freed himself and ruined Pushkin's attempted theft of a payload of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] weaponry. In the midst of this, Sickle gained a measure of revenge by gouging out Maverick's left eye and stranding him in the [[Swiss Alps]] &lt;ref&gt;''Maverick'' #8-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agent Zero===
The Weapon X project was soon reinvigorated and having brought Sabretooth and Wraith back into the fold, they were sent to recruit Maverick. Wraith lured an unwitting Maverick into a rendezvous. Maverick refused to join, and a fierce battle ensued. Sabretooth caught Maverick off guard, impaling him in the chest then throwing him off the roof of a 20-story building and onto the street below.&lt;ref name="wolverine166"&gt;''Wolverine'' #166&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Zeroheal.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Agent Zero's anti-healing factor corrosive.]]
Taken to Weapon X near death, [[Malcolm Colcord]] again offered him the chance to join, as he could still be saved. This time, he reluctantly agreed, rationalizing it by saying he couldn't "fight the good fight" as a corpse. He was healed and then upgraded with the explicit intent of assassinating Wolverine. He has no scent, makes no sound thanks to a [[vibranium]] suit, possesses an enhanced healing factor, and a corrosive was added to his concussive blasts that hinder a foes' healing factor. In addition, he was equipped with a wide array of weapons, from wrist-mounted plasma blasters to an adamantium-coated knife. The world believed that North was dead, and he sought to keep it that way. He dyed his brown hair black and adopted the new alias Agent Zero.  After sending him on a few simple missions, Colcord tried to break his will by sending him to kill Wolverine, a mission he purposely botched.&lt;ref name="zero"/&gt;

Feeling guilty for joining the enemy, he contemplated suicide daily. His hatred for his teammate Sabretooth still ran deep, as he tried yet again to kill him, only to be stopped from dealing a fatal blow by the Director.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

During a mission, Agent Zero encountered a new Maverick, who unbeknownst to Zero, was Chris Bradley. Bradley had infiltrated a mutant terrorist group called [[Gene Nation]] in an effort to destroy them from inside. Bradley had wanted revenge on Weapon X for 'killing' North. To achieve that goal, he received training in [[black ops]] from [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and assumed the Maverick mantle. Zero, believing this new Maverick was a terrorist, shot and killed him, only to find the truth as Bradley lay dying. Returning to the base after this occurred, Zero found Weapon X had disappeared without a trace. Zero then picked up Bradley's fight, attacking Gene Nation strongholds across the world and also searched for answers as to what happened to the program.&lt;ref&gt;''Weapon X'' #21&lt;/ref&gt;

It was revealed that Zero doesn't know what happened to Weapon X was because he was being [[Brainwashing|brainwashed]] by [[Mesmero]] as Zero had become increasingly harder to control. Zero had gone after Gene Nation because of Weapon X's instruction. Without realizing it, Zero served as executioner at Neverland, a mutant [[concentration camp]] set up by Weapon X. But as soon as Weapon X bothered to reveal these truths, they put him under again, and Zero went on, none the wiser.&lt;ref name="dofn3"&gt;''Weapon X: Days of Future Now'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decimation===
Agent Zero lost his powers on [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], as a result of [[Scarlet Witch|Scarlet Witch's]] actions during the [[House of M]]. It has been revealed that he is among the mutants who have been depowered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference|Title = New Avengers|Issue = 18|Date = (Jun 2006)|Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North is seen residing in a center for former mutants and once again using the Maverick alias.&lt;ref name="Wolverine: Origins #6"&gt;''Wolverine: Origins'' #6&lt;/ref&gt; Wolverine sought him out for information on carbonadium, reuniting the two and [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]]. However, Omega Red soon attacked the building, looking for the carbonadium synthesizer.&lt;ref name="Wolverine: Origins #6"/&gt;

Maverick stole Weapon X files and sold them on the black market. In an effort to cover up his involvement in Kick-starting the Strikeforce X program from Wolverine, he killed the man to whom he sold the files.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine: Weapon X'' #1-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
North's primary mutant power is an ability to absorb the kinetic energy generated by an impact without harm to himself. While there are limits to this power, North is able to survive falls from tremendous heights, energy blasts, and being struck by superhumanly strong foes without being injured.

Upon accepting his first offer to work for the Weapon X Program, North is artificially granted a slight healing factor that allows him to recover from mild to moderate injuries much faster than a normal human.&lt;ref name="annual"/&gt; It also renders him immune to most diseases and toxins and also greatly suppressed his natural aging process. However, after contracting the [[Legacy Virus]], his kinetic absorption ability is dramatically reduced in efficiency and his healing factor burns itself out while fighting the virus.&lt;ref name="wolverine87"/&gt;

After the virus claims his life and he is resuscitated by Elena Ivanova, the Legacy Virus immediately goes into remission and his kinetic absorption ability mutates. After absorbing energy, North must release the energy in the forms of powerful concussive or heat blasts. He can also channel the energy into physical attacks, increasing the physical force of his punches and kicks to superhuman levels.&lt;ref name="maverick1"/&gt;

After being forced to join the Weapon X Program once again, North's kinetic absorption ability is artificially mutated further. Now, aside from channeling the energy to increase the strength of his physical attacks, North can expel a corrosive enzyme that is secreted from the tips of his fingers via his energy blasts. Aside from its acidic properties, the enzyme is specifically designed by the Weapon X Program to counteract the effects of an opponent's self-healing capabilities by reversing the process. The more an enemy's body attempts to heal itself from injuries sustained by the enzyme, the worse the injuries become. As a side effect of the procedure used to grant him this ability, North's body now possesses no discernible scent.&lt;ref name="zero"/&gt;

Currently, North possesses no superhuman powers. Like most of the world's mutant population, North has lost his mutant powers following the events of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' #18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skills and equipment===
North is a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant and covert operative. He is also an expert marksman, skilled in the use of virtually all types of firearms. He has also worn a variety of uniforms over the course of his career.

The costume he has worn for most of his mercenary career as Maverick is a suit of body armor consisting of lightweight fiberglass armor plating, a padded [[kevlar]] lining,&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men Unlimited'' #3,&lt;/ref&gt; and airtight seals or shields that allow him to seal the suit for further protection.&lt;ref name="maverick6"&gt;''Maverick'' #6&lt;/ref&gt; His mask contained a limited oxygen supply as well as infrared scanning and targeting systems.&lt;ref name="maverick6"/&gt; The suit also harnessed a booster pack that could magnify the kinetic energy his body absorbed.&lt;ref name="Maverick #7"&gt;''Maverick'' #7&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian inventor Isabel Ferguson is the primary source of his specialized gear.&lt;ref name="maverick1"/&gt;

As Agent Zero, North wears a body armor woven from [[vibranium]], rendering him completely silent as he moves. It also refracts light which renders him practically invisible to conventional detection methods in total darkness.&lt;ref name="zero"/&gt;

North has carried a wide array of weaponry including, but not limited to: thermite bombs, hydraulic bolt guns, titanium bullets,&lt;ref name="wolverine166"/&gt; wrist-mounted projectile tasers,&lt;ref name="Maverick #7"/&gt; wrist-mounted plasma blasters, [[adamantium]] bullets, anti-metal bullets, and an adamantium-coated knife.&lt;ref name="zero"/&gt;

==Other versions==

===Exiles===
An alternate version of Maverick was revealed to exist in ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' #62. Maverick was forced to join [[Weapon X (Exiles)|Weapon X]], a group of reality-hopping people who had to kill people in order to save realities. Little is known about Maverick, except that he apparently was killed by the bladed shield of an alternate version of [[Captain America]]. For a time, the body was trapped in the Timebroker's Crystal Palace until the Exiles sent his body back home. On his homeworld of Earth-1287, Maverick was revealed to be an agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] before his abduction, working alongside [[Nick Fury]], who later honored his best agent by giving him a proper funeral.{{issue|date=December 2010}}

===Earth-5700===
In a possible future timeline (Earth-5700), Agent Zero joined a Wolverine-led version of the X-Men, teaming with [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]], [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], [[Aurora (comics)|Aurora]], and [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]. After a time, the Director activated Zero's embedded mental directive, and Zero, against his will, slaughtered the X-Men, except for Wolverine. Unable to bring himself to kill his friend and teammate, he fought the mind control just long enough to commit suicide.&lt;ref name="dofn3"/&gt;

==In other media==

===Television===
[[Image:Sliver Mar.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Maverick (left) and [[Silver Fox (comics)|Silver Fox]] as seen in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' 1990s cartoon.]]
* Maverick appeared in the 1990s ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' cartoon. In the episode "Weapon X, Lies, and Videotape", he searches for answers about his past and his involvement with Weapon X, teaming with [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] and [[Silver Fox (comics)|Silver Fox]] to take down the robot Talos. In the episode "Whatever It Takes", [[Morph (comics)|Morph]] briefly turns into Maverick to taunt Wolverine, and Maverick also appears in [[flashback (continuity)|flashback]]s that depict himself and Wolverine battling Omega Red (although that memory could be one of Weapon X's implanted memories).
* In ''[[X-Men Evolution]]'', [[Omega Red]] tells Wolverine of having a vendetta against Wolverine, Sabretooth, and Maverick which Wolverine does not recall.
* Maverick appears in ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'', voiced by [[Crispin Freeman]]. This version's only power is kinetic absorption but he is also the father of [[Petra (comics)|Christie Nord]], a mutant with geokinesis. In the episode "Past Discretions", he primarily appears in a flashback as a target for Wolverine and Sabretooth. Although he is presumed deceased, he was captured and brainwashed with his memories were removed by Weapon X. In the episode "Stolen Lives", Maverick is sent to abduct Kristie, causing Wolverine to team-up with [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]. Like Wolverine's recruitment for Weapon X, the majority of his memories have been permanently erased, however, [[Emma Frost]] restores his memories and then he reunites with his daughter.

===Film===
[[Image:Zerorigins.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Daniel Henney as Agent Zero in ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]''.]]
* Agent Zero appears in the film ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'', played by [[Daniel Henney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dominic Monaghan Zaps To "Wolverine" |publisher=Dark Horizons |date=2008-02-22 |url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/news08/080222h.php |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120731092510/http://www.darkhorizons.com/news08/080222h.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-31 |accessdate=2008-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depicted as Asian in ethnicity, he is a superhumanly accurate sniper/assassin and he is [[William Stryker]]'s second in command of [[Team X (comics)|Team X]]. He and Victor Creed are the only ones from Team X that stayed faithful to Stryker. When Wolverine breaks out from the Weapon X facility, Zero pursues Wolverine to an old barn belonging to an elderly couple who have taken Wolverine in. Zero kills the couple and orders a helicopter strike to kill Wolverine. When Wolverine gets away on a motorcycle, Zero pursues in the helicopter which Wolverine eventually causes to crash. After mocking Wolverine about how "good, innocent people tend to die around [Wolverine]", Wolverine ignites a trail of fuel with his own claws that cause the helicopter to explode, presumably killing Zero who is apparently inside. Zero was also allegedly the one who told [[Blob (comics)|Fred Dukes]] and [[Kestrel (Marvel Comics)|John Wraith]] about Stryker and Victor working together and hunting down mutants. This version of the character is depicted as being exceptionally ruthless, killing several innocent civilians over the course of the film in order to complete his mission. Agent Zero, in fact, refers to himself as a soldier at heart. His powers in the film are enhanced speed, reflexes, agility, and superhuman accuracy with firearms. He is also shown as an expert tracker. Producer [[Lauren Shuler Donner]] says on the DVD commentary that Agent Zero has no scent and that a sequence was planned that he escapes the crash and Logan cuts down the forest to stop him. The character is repeatedly referred to as Zero rather than using his given name.

===Video games===
* Maverick is briefly mentioned in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''.
* Agent Zero appears in the ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine (video game)|X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'' video game adaptation, voiced by [[Robert Wu]]. He hunts Wolverine after the latter escapes the facility that bonded the adamantium into the skeleton. At one point, he attempts to take Wolverine out with a sniper rifle. Wolverine manages to take down his helicopter and kills Nord by stabbing him in the stomach with the claws. His name in the game is '''David Nord'''.

{{nihongo|'''''Lupin III: Farewell to Nostradamus'''''|ルパン三世 くたばれ!ノストラダムス|Rupan sansei: Kutabare! Nosutoradamusu|lit. "Lupin III: Die! Nostradamus"|lead=yes}}, sometimes also referred to as ''To Hell With Nostradamus,'' is a 1995 Japanese [[anime|animated]] film. It is the fourth theatrical feature film in the ''[[Lupin III]]'' franchise.  The North American release was done by [[FUNimation]]; it was released individually and later made a part of the "Final Haul" box set.

==Plot==
{{Long plot|date=September 2017}}
[[Lupin the Third]] and [[Daisuke Jigen]] steal a diamond and hide it in a doll. Though [[Inspector Zenigata]] attempts to catch the two, he fails and they escape on an airplane. While on the plane, a little girl named Julia steals Lupin's doll. Lupin chases her and she leads him to [[Fujiko Mine]], who is chaperoning her. Lupin tries to bargain with Fujiko in an effort to get the doll back, but their conversation is interrupted when the plane is hijacked.

The hijackers land the plane at a nearby airport and request transportation and a million dollar ransom in exchange for the women and children, as well as the [[Brazil National Football Team]] who also boarded the plane. While Fujiko and Julia are allowed to get off the plane, Lupin and Jigen must stay on with the hijackers. Meanwhile, a man named Chris watches the commotion from a distance and activates the bomb the hijackers have using his watch. When the bomb starts counting down, the hijackers become startled and Lupin, Jigen, and the rest of the passengers use this opportunity to fight back and escape from the plane.

During the commotion, Zenigata arrives and makes another attempt to arrest Lupin and Jigen, but he becomes sidetracked when he tries to disarm the bomb. As Lupin and Jigen escape, Julia (still holding the doll) is kidnapped by Chris and his henchmen via helicopter. Fujiko then explains to Lupin and Jigen that Julia is the daughter of Douglas, a nominee for President of the United States and is worth $50,000,000. Meanwhile, a man named Rhisley, the head of a cult known as the Nostradamus Sect, speaks to a crowd of followers. He claims to have a book filled with the lost prophecies of Nostradamus and recites one of the verses which predicted the plane's hijacking.

In actuality, his book is a fake. The real one is in the safe on the top floor of the Earth Building, which belongs to Douglas. Fujiko reveals that she took the job of looking after Julia in order to break into the safe and steal the lost prophecies of Nostradamus. The three travel to the Earth Building and Fujiko meets with Douglas and his wife, Mary, to tell them that Julia has been kidnapped while Lupin and Jigen try to break into the vault. During all of this, Chris makes an appearance on TV and demands that Douglas drop out of the presidential race in exchange for Julia. Douglas refuses, saying that the kidnapping will lead to sympathy for his campaign.

Meanwhile, Lupin and Jigen fail to open the vault and Fujiko is kidnapped by Chris. While driving through the city searching for Fujiko, Lupin and Jigen come across [[Goemon Ishikawa XIII]] and convince him to join them. Goemon agrees because he is also searching for the lost prophecies. Lupin then makes a plan to get himself arrested and sent to Execution Island, a prison where Lupin's Uncle Philip is kept in. He does this because Philip was the only person who managed to get inside the vault. During Lupin's stay, Chris and the Nostradamus Sect take Uncle Philip and use a machine to get inside his brain and extract the information on how to get into the vault. However, during the process, Philip dies. Lupin takes Philips body and discovers that one of his eyes is fake. He takes it out and keeps it as something to remember him by.

After the mishap, Jigen and Goemon arrive in a helicopter and try to help Lupin escape, but Lupin is shot in the arm by Chris and falls into the ocean. The next day, Lupin wakes up on an island and is being nursed back to health by a boy named Sergio and his grandmother. While on the island, he discovers that Fujiko is there as well, but Sergio's grandmother says that she's really a handmaiden of the Nostradamus Sect named Tanya. Lupin follows Fujiko to a cathedral where the sect is located. When he sneaks in, he finds out that Julia is being kept prisoner there and Fujiko has lost her memory. Before he can find out anything else, Lupin is discovered by the sect and they throw them in a cell.

Meanwhile, Jigen and Goemon believe that Lupin is dead and stake out a black market weapons shop, waiting for Chris. He shows up with some henchmen and they partake in a short battle. Jigen attempts to kill Chris, but he gets away. After the fight, Lupin contacts Jigen with a device hidden in his tooth. He informs Jigen that the Nostradamus Sect is connected to the kidnapping and that he is being held prisoner by them. While this is taking place, Julia cuts off a wrist band that Fujiko is wearing and her memories return. Chris then meets with Rhisley as their plan is revealed. As more people join the Nostradamus Sect, and their lies become the only truths, they plan to gain enough power to have the entire world bow down to them. Rhisley tells Chris that since Douglas won't back down, that Julia isn't of any use to them anymore.

An attempt on Julia's life is made, but Lupin, Fujiko, and Sergio help her escape. As the sect closes in on them, Jigen and Goemon arrive and get them all out of there via helicopter, but Julia is kidnapped once again. They make their way back to the States and try to come up with a plan to get into the vault. Lupin then recalls the fake eye he got from Uncle Philip and thinks that since the security system only recognizes the eyes of Douglas' immediate family, Philip must have used the eye to get into the vault. Meanwhile, the Brazilian Soccer Team is staying in the Earth Building when Chris uses his watch to activate the same wrist bands they're wearing that Fujiko had on earlier. The bands hypnotize them and they place several bombs throughout the building. Goemon discovers what's going on and informs the others about it.

The next day, Rhisley speaks to a crowd of people in front of the Earth Building and informs them that one of the verses states that the skyscraper will explode, leading to the many people inside to evacuate. During the commotion, Lupin, Jigen, Fujiko, and Goemon make another attempt to break into the vault. However, Chris goes against Rhisley's plan and enter the building to steal the lost prophecies of Nostradamus for himself. Rhisley chases him with a helicopter to stop him. Chris gets to the vault first and uses Julia to get inside, but the inside of the vault has a defense mechanism which creates the illusion that Chris is falling into an endless abyss. When Lupin and Jigen arrive, Julia gives them the prophecies of Nostradamus, but Rhisley meets them and threatens to kill them if they don't give him the prophecies.

While Chris is still affected by the vault's illusion, he panics and activates the bombs with his watch. The building is severely damaged, but is still able to stand. Jigen, Goemon, and Fujiko are separated from Lupin and Julia, but Douglas gets parachutes to all of them and they plan to meet up at the bottom. However, the vault's illusion is disrupted and Chris comes to his senses and attacks Lupin and Julia. As the Earth Building continues to break apart, the vault collapses onto Chris, killing him. Lupin and Julia make their escape and Rhisley falls to his death.

When the disaster is over, Julia is reunited with her family. As Lupin and the others make plans to sell the book of lost prophecies, Goemon discovers that Julia had doodled on several of the pages in the past, so no one would ever buy it. Realizing, that it's now useless, they destroy the book, but Julia returns the diamond to Lupin and they all watch as the Earth Building collapses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8981">'''Film analysis''' is the process in which a [[film]] is analyzed in terms of [[mise-en-scène]], [[cinematography]], [[sound]], and [[editing]].  One way of analyzing films is by the shot-by-shot analysis, though that is typically used only for small clips or scenes. Film analysis is closely connected to [[film theory]].

Different authors suggest various approaches to film analysis. [[Jacques Aumont]] and [[Michel Marie]] in their publication Analysis of Film&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=L’Analyse des films/Analysis of Film|year=1988|publisher=Nathan|author=Aumont Jacques|author2=Michele Marie}}&lt;/ref&gt; propose several key points regarding film analysis. (1) There is general method of film analysis, (2) film analysis can never be concluded as there will always be something more to explore and (3) it is necessary for one to have knowledge about film history in order to perform a film analysis. They recognize various types of approaches: (1) Text-based film analysis (structural approach), (2) topic based analysis (narrative approach), (3) picture and sound approach (iconic analysis), (4) psychoanalytical approach and (5) historical approach.

Another methodology is suggested by Thomas and Vivian Sobchack in their publication Introduction to film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Film|year=1997|publisher=Longman|isbn=067339302X|author=Thomas Sobchack|author2=Vivian Sobchack}}&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest viewer can observe following elements: (1) analysis of film space, (2) analysis of film time and (3) film sound. As they focus mainly on iconic aspects of film they further propose additional elements: the image, tone, composition and movement.

==Iconic analysis==
Iconic analysis basically deals with [[image]] or [[picture]] (and sometimes also film sound). In iconic analysis we try to understand how different pictorial elements convey the meaning of film. There are several examples in [[film history]] where image was even more than just key element of film (i.e. pre WWII avant-garde films, [[Italian neorealism]], [[film noir]], etc.). However today in most narrative films ([[Fictional film]]) we try to hide [[pictorial elements]] from [[audience]] and mask them behind the [[Narrative|story]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Film|year=1997|publisher=Longman|isbn=067339302X|author=Thomas Sobchack|author2=Vivian Sobchack}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such films it is usually difficult (if not event pointless) to analyze image as such. We therefore more often tend to observe various other elements like light, camera movement (see [[Cinematography]]), [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] etc. and try to understand how these elements influence or cross-reference other elements of film, like story, mood etc. As iconic analysis derives from single image and it is closely related to techniques of film production thus demanding at least brief understanding of these technical elements of film it is mostly useful method of research for film schools and other educational institutions. Film critics tend not use this method as a “stand alone” approach, but they rather use it as a part of other analysis method.

==Semiotic analysis==
Semiotics (also called semiotic studies and in the [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] tradition called semiology) is the study of meaning-making, the philosophical theory of signs and symbols. This includes the study of [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] and sign processes ([[semiosis]]), indication, designation, likeness, [[analogy]], [[metaphor]], [[symbol]]ism, signification, and communication. Semiotics is closely related to the field of [[linguistics]], which, for its part, studies the structure and meaning of [[language]] more specifically. As different from linguistics, however, semiotics also studies non-linguistic [[sign systems]]. Semiotics often is divided into three branches:
[[Semantics]] is the relation between signs and the things to which they refer; their ''denotata'', or [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]. [[Syntax|Syntactics]] is relations among signs in formal structures. [[Pragmatics]] is the relation between signs and sign-using agents.

==Psychoanalytical approach==
Ancient Greek philosophy's "overturning of mythology"&lt;ref&gt;Love, Page 53, By Wikipedians&lt;/ref&gt; as a definition to understanding of the heightened [[aesthetic]].&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, "Introduction", in Hunt ed., Eroticism p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Plato]], [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]] takes an almost [[transcendent (philosophy)|transcendent]] manifestation when the subject seeks to go beyond itself and form a communion with the objectival other: "the true order of going...to the things of love, is to use the beauties of earth as steps...to all fair forms, and from fair forms to fair actions, and from fair actions to fair notions, until from fair notions he arrives at the notion of absolute beauty".&lt;ref&gt;"The Symposium", in Benjamin Jowett trans, ''The Essential Plato'' (1999) p. 746&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shot by shot analysis==
This is a written description of a given sequence in a film in order of the shots.  According to Michael Ryan and Melissa Lenos, when doing shot-by-shot analysis, we start with describing the techniques used in the shots or images we are analyzing. After that, we also need to elaborate what effects these techniques can produce when viewing the movie; for example, camera leads what we see in the film so the changes in camera angles have impact on audience's interpretations of the meanings the movie tries to convey. Some of the techniques used in film producing could be composition (foreground/background, frame/raming, etc.), [[cinematography]] ([[close-up]], [[medium shot]] and [[long shot]], pan shot, tilt shot, etc.), editing ([[montage (filmmaking)|montage]], [[eyeline match]], etc.), and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Michael, and Melissa Lenos. ''An Introduction to Film Analysis: Technique and Meaning in Narrative Film.'' London: Continuum, 2012. Print. {{ISBN|9780826430021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent developments from internet-based film analysts==
A number of varied film analysis approaches have emerged and gained popularity on the internet such as those by [[Red Letter Media]] and Rob Ager.&lt;ref&gt;Quercia, Jacopo Della. "Six pop culture mysteries that were solved by fans" http://www.cracked.com/article_19684_6-pop-culture-mysteries-that-were-solved-by-fans.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wook, Kim. Time Entertainment. "29 movie head-scratchers explained" http://entertainment.time.com/2012/08/13/hollywood-mystery-solved-29-movie-head-scratchers-explained/slide/the-thing/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 [[Room 237]], a documentary showcasing a variety of such interpretations of [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s horror film [[The Shining (film)|The Shining]], was screened at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and generated wide media coverage followed by a distribution deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Leffler | first=Rebecca | title=Cannes 2012: Michel Gondry’s 'The We &amp; The I' to Open Director's Fortnight | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/michel-gondry-cannes-film-festival-directors-fortnight-314985 | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | accessdate=2012-04-25 | date=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2012 Selection |url=http://www.quinzaine-realisateurs.com/2012-selection-h201.html |work=[[Directors' Fortnight]] |publisher=quinzaine-realisateurs.com |accessdate=2012-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426224019/http://www.quinzaine-realisateurs.com/2012-selection-h201.html |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film has since generated considerable comment and debate from film critics and film communities.&lt;ref&gt;Vanairsdale, S.T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4709">'''Frances Robinson-Duff''' (1878-1951) was an American actress and [[vocal pedagogy|voice teacher]] known as "the foremost [[acting coach|dramatic coach]] in America" in the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Behrman"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Behrman |first1=S. N. |title=Do or Diaphragm |journal=The New Yorker |date=May 25, 1935 |pages=22-27 |url=http://snbehrman.com/library/newyorker/35.5.25.NY.htm |accessdate=26 September 2018 |ref=Behrman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Reston |first1=James |title=A New Yorker at Large |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9953043/montana_butte_standard/ |accessdate=27 September 2018 |work=Montana Standard (Butte) |publisher=p 10 |date=February 23, 1935}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frances was born in [[Bangor, Maine]], to British mining engineer Colonel Charles Duff (d. circa 1920) and his wife Sarah Robinson (d. 1934), a native of Bangor who, after the couple separated, moved to Chicago and later to Paris, becoming a noted opera singer and singing teacher under the name Sarah Robinson-Duff; her first pupil was future opera star [[Mary Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shigo |first1=Daniel James |title=Mrs. Robinson-Duff comes out swinging |url=http://www.voice-talk.net/2015/02/mrs-robinson-duff-comes-out-swinging.html |website=Voicetalk:  Historical Perspectives on the Art of Singing |accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From an early age, Frances wanted to teach dramatic arts, but her mother insisted that she first gain experience in the craft of acting.  After being instructed in the  [[François Delsarte|Delsarte system]] by a drama teacher in Chicago, Frances was invited to join the touring company of famed Shakespearean actress [[Julia Marlowe]].  In 1898 she made her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut with Miss Marlowe at the [[Knickerbocker Theatre (Broadway)|Knickerbocker Theatre]] in New York, and subsequently appeared in numerous productions in New York and London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Reston |first1=James |title=A New Yorker at Large |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9953043/montana_butte_standard/ |accessdate=27 September 2018 |work=Montana Standard (Butte) |publisher=p 10 |date=February 23, 1935}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

After eleven years of acting, she joined her mother in Paris, where they enjoyed the company of performers and composers such as [[Enrico Caruso]], [[Sarah Bernhardt]] and [[Camille Saint-Saens]].  Frances began her teaching career in Paris, and during [[World War I]], she volunteered her services to teach wounded soldiers how to regain the use of damaged lungs.&lt;ref name="Behrman"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Behrman |first1=S. N. |title=Do or Diaphragm |journal=The New Yorker |date=May 25, 1935 |pages=22-27 |url=http://snbehrman.com/library/newyorker/35.5.25.NY.htm |accessdate=26 September 2018 |ref=Behrman}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Shortly after the end of the war, mother and daughter moved to New York City, where Frances established herself as a leading voice teacher, whose many famous pupils included [[Mary McCormic]], [[Dorothy Gish]], [[Helen Hayes]], [[Kenneth MacKenna]], [[Catherine Calvert]], [[Ina Claire]], [[Miriam Hopkins]], [[Ruth Chatterton]], [[Mary Pickford]], [[Clark Gable]], [[Norma Shearer]], and [[Katharine Hepburn]].&lt;ref name="Behrman"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Behrman |first1=S.

The Robinson-Duff approach to voice training involved elaborate vocal and breathing exercises focused on the use of the diaphragm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Frances Robinson-Duff's Summer Classes |journal=Pacific Coast Musical Review |date=April 8, 1922 |volume=XLII |issue=9 |pages=12-13 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6XI9AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=frances+robinson-duff&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwik0Jy2tdndAhWD3FMKHUlED98Q6AEIPzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=frances%20robinson-duff&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; a method humorously recounted by Hepburn (who never mastered it) in her autobiography, ''Me:  Stories of My Life'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hepburn |first1=Katharine |title=Me:  Stories of My Life |date=1991 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=0345410092 |pages=80-82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6423">'''Furniture music''', or in [[French (language)|French]] '''''musique d’ameublement''''' (sometimes more literally translated as ''furnishing'' music), is [[background music]] originally played by live performers. The term was coined by [[Erik Satie]] in 1917.

==Satie's compositions==
===The music===
[[File:Satie Tapisserie en Fer forge 1924.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Furniture music: «Tapisserie en Fer forgé», 1924]]
Although other selections of Erik Satie's music can be experienced (and are sometimes indicated) as furniture music, Satie himself applied the name only to five short pieces, composed in three separate sets:
* 1st set (1917), for [[flute]], [[clarinet]] and [[string instrument|strings]], plus a trumpet for the first piece:
** 1. '''''Tapisserie en fer forgé''''' - pour l'arrivée des invités (grande réception) - À jouer dans un vestibule - Mouvement: ''Très riche'' (Tapestry in forged iron - for the arrival of the guests (grand reception) - to be played in a vestibule - Movement: Very rich)
** 2. '''''Carrelage phonique''''' - Peut se jouer à un lunch ou à un contrat de mariage - Mouvement: ''Ordinaire'' (Phonic tiling - Can be played during a lunch or civil marriage - Movement: Ordinary),
* 2nd set, '''''Sons industriels''''' (Industrial sounds, February/March 1920), for piano duet, 3 clarinets and [[trombone]]:
** Premier Entr'acte: '''''Chez un "Bistrot"''''' (First Entr'acte: At a "[[Bistro]]")
** Second Entr'acte: '''''Un salon''''' (Second Entr'acte: A drawing room)
* 1923, commissioned by Mrs Eugène Meyer jr. (living in Washington DC), for small orchestra:
** '''''Tenture de cabinet préfectoral''''' (Wall-lining in a chief officer's office)

[[File:Satie Carrelage Phonique 1917.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Furniture music: «Carrelage Phonique», 1917]]
The first set was apparently never performed (nor the score published) during Satie's lifetime.

The second set contained reminiscences of popular tunes by, amongst others, [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] and [[Ambroise Thomas]]. It was premiered in Paris the year it was composed, as [[intermission]] music to a lost [[List of comedies#Theatrical Comedies|comedy]] by [[Max Jacob]]. During these intermissions the audience was invited to visit an exposition of children's drawings in the [[Galerie Barbazanges]] that was hosting the premiere.

Indications of the intentions of the artists giving the first performance are found in the manuscript of the score:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Furnishing [[divertissement]] organised by the group of musicians known as the "[[Les Six|Nouveaux Jeunes]]"
&lt;br /&gt;
Furnishing music replaces "[[waltz]]es" and "[[opera]]tic [[fantasia (music)|fantasias]]" etc. Don't be confused! ''It's something else!!!'' No more "false music"
&lt;br /&gt;
Furnishing music completes one's property;
&lt;br /&gt;
it's new; it doesn't upset customs; it isn't tiring; it's [[France|French]]; it won't wear out; it ''isn't boring''
&lt;br /&gt;
''--quoted in [[Satie#Sources|Gillmor, 1988]], p 325-326''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

See also the [[Entr'acte (film)|Entr'acte]] article for more details regarding the circumstances of this first, and only documented, public performance of furniture music during Satie's lifetime, assisted by the composer himself.

The separate commissioned piece was sent to America. There are no known public performances or publications of this music prior to leaving the European continent. This piece is sometimes presented as ''furniture music No. 3''.

As Satie's pieces of furniture music were very short pieces, with an indefinite number of repeats, this kind of furniture music later became associated with [[repetitive music]] (sometimes used as a synonym of [[minimal music]]), but this kind of terminology did not yet exist in Satie's time.

===Publication===
For a quarter of a century after the composer's death, all of the furniture music pieces remained hidden from the general public, apart from being mentioned in early Satie biographies. By the end of the 1960s parts of the furniture music started to appear as [[facsimile]] illustrations to press articles and new Satie biographies. The first full publication of sets 1 and 3 followed in the early 1970s. There was no full publication of the 2nd set before the last years of the 20th century.

==Revival==
Several decades after Satie's death, furniture music was revived, largely due to the American composer [[John Cage]], as the composer's theory of [[minimalism|minimalist]] background music. Furniture music appeared as the launchpad for minimalist/experimental/avant-garde music since it was the first instance of music being played or produced out of context: not as a centerpiece but as a cerebral backdrop.

These and other related ideas were picked up by several composers of the neo-Classical/20th Century school of music, accentuating atmosphere and texture over traditional form and movement. The minimalist references and anachronisms were not solidified until composer [[John Cage]] performed Satie's "hidden" piece ''[[Vexations]]'' 840 times as requested by Satie's own scribbled notes on the original sheet music.

'''Jean Marie Lucien Pierre Anouilh''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒɑ̃ anuj|lang}};&lt;ref&gt;Not, as often mispronounced, {{IPA-fr|anwi}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 23 June 1910 – 3 October 1987)  was a French [[dramatist]] whose career spanned five decades. Though his work ranged from high drama to absurdist farce, Anouilh is best known for his 1944 play ''[[Antigone (Anouilh)|Antigone]]'', an adaptation of [[Sophocles]]' classical drama, that was seen as an attack on [[Philippe Pétain|Marshal Pétain]]'s [[Vichy France|Vichy government]]. One of France's most prolific writers after World War II, much of Anouilh's work deals with themes of maintaining integrity in a world of moral compromise.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Anouilh was born in [[Cérisole]], a small village on the outskirts of [[Bordeaux]], and had [[Basque people|Basque]] ancestry. His father, François Anouilh, was a tailor, and Anouilh maintained that he inherited from him a pride in conscientious craftmanship. He may owe his artistic bent to his mother, Marie-Magdeleine, a violinist who supplemented the family's meager income by playing summer seasons in the casino orchestra in the nearby seaside resort of [[Arcachon]]. Marie-Magdeleine worked the night shifts in the music-hall orchestras and sometimes accompanied stage presentations, affording Anouilh ample opportunity to absorb the dramatic performances from backstage. He often attended rehearsals and solicited the resident authors to let him read scripts until bedtime. He first tried his hand at playwriting here, at the age of 12, though his earliest works do not survive.&lt;ref name="Rocchi"/&gt;

[[Image:lycée chaptal.jpeg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Lycée Chaptal]], at the corner of rue de Rome and the boulevard des Batignolles]]

In 1918 the family moved to Paris where the young Anouilh received his secondary education at the [[Lycée Chaptal]]. [[Jean-Louis Barrault]], later a major French director, was a pupil there at the same time and recalls Anouilh as an intense, rather dandified figure who hardly noticed a boy some two years younger than himself. He earned acceptance into the law school at the [[Sorbonne]] but, unable to support himself financially, he left after just 18 months to seek work as a copywriter at the advertising agency Publicité Damour. He liked the work, and spoke more than once with wry approval of the lessons in the classical virtues of brevity and precision of language he learned while drafting advertising copy.&lt;ref name="Liukkonen"/&gt;

Anouilh's financial troubles continued after he was called up to military service in 1929.  Supported by only his meager conscription salary, Anouilh married the actress [[Monelle Valentin]] in 1931. Though Valentin starred in many of his plays, Anouilh's daughter Caroline (from his second marriage), claims that the marriage was not a happy one. Anouilh's youngest daughter Colombe even claims that there was never an official marriage between Anouilh and Valentin. She allegedly had multiple extramarital affairs, which caused Anouilh much pain and suffering.  The infidelity weighed heavily on the dramatist as a result of the uncertainty about his own parentage. According to Caroline, Anouilh had learned that his mother had had a lover at the theatre in Arcachon who was actually his biological father. In spite of this, Anouilh and Valentin had a daughter, Catherine, in 1934 who followed the pair into theatre work at an early age. Anouilh's growing family placed further strain on his already limited finances. Determined to break into writing full-time, he began to write comic scenes for the cinema to supplement their income.&lt;ref name="AnouilhCaroline"/&gt;

===Theatre work===
At the age of 25, Anouilh found work as a secretary to the French actor and director [[Louis Jouvet]] at the Comédie des Champs-Elysées. Though Anouilh's boss had happily lent him some of the set furniture left over from the production of [[Jean Giraudoux]]'s  play ''Siegfried'' to furnish his modest home, the director was not interested in encouraging his assistant's attempts at playwriting.&lt;ref name="Falb"/&gt; Jouvet had risen to fame in the early 1930s through his collaborations with the playwright Giraudoux, and together the two worked to shift focus from the authorial voice of the director (which had dominated the French stage since the early twentieth century) back to the playwright and his text.

Giraudoux was an inspiration to Anouilh and, with the encouragement of the acclaimed playwright, he began writing again in 1929. Before the end of the year he made his theatrical debut with ''Humulus le muet'', a collaborative project with [[Jean Aurenche]]. It was followed by his first solo projects, ''L'Hermine'' (''The Ermine'') in 1932 and ''Mandarine'' in 1933, both produced by [[Aurélien Lugné-Poe]], an innovative actor and stage manager who was then head of the [[Théâtre de l'Œuvre]].&lt;ref name="Levi"/&gt; Ruled by the philosophy, "the word creates the decor," Lugné-Poe let Anouilh's lyrical prose shine in front of a backdrop of simple compositions of line and color that created a unity of style and mood.&lt;ref name="Brockett442"/&gt;

The plays were not great successes, closing after 37 and 13 performances respectively, but Anouilh persevered, following it up with a string of productions, most notably ''Y'avait un prisonnier'' (1935). These works, most in collaboration with the experimental Russian director [[Georges Pitoëff]], were considered promising despite their lack of commercial profits, and the duo continued to work together until they had their first major success in 1937 with ''[[Le voyageur sans bagage]]'' (''Traveller Without Luggage''). In subsequent years, there was rarely a season in Paris that did not prominently feature a new Anouilh play and many of these were also being exported to England and America.&lt;ref name="Pronko"/&gt; After 1938, however, much of Anouilh's later work was directed by the prominent Paris scenic designer [[André Barsacq]], who had taken over as director of the [[Théâtre de l'Atelier]] after [[Charles Dullin]]'s retirement in 1940.  Barsacq was a champion for Anouilh and their affiliation was a major factor in the playwright's continued success after the war.&lt;ref name="Brockett458485"/&gt;

===Playwright===
In the 1940s, Anouilh turned from contemporary tales to more mythical, classic, and historic subjects.  With protagonists who asserted their independence from the fated past, themes during this period are more closely related to the existential concerns of such writers as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Albert Camus]]. The most famous play of this group is ''Antigone'', which "established Anouilh as a leading dramatist, not only because of the power with which he drew the classic confrontation between the uncompromising Antigone and the politically expedient Creon, but also because French theatre-goers under the occupation read the play as a contemporary political parable."&lt;ref name="Carlson"/&gt; His post-war plays dealt with similar concerns and included ''Roméo et Jeannette'', ''Médée'' (''Medea''), and Anouilh's [[Joan of Arc]] story ''L'Alouette'' (''[[The Lark (play)|The Lark]]''), which, in its distinct optimism, rivalled the commercial success of ''Antigone''.

Anouilh himself grouped his plays of this period on the basis of their dominant tone, publishing his later works in collected volumes to reflect what he felt "represented the phases of his evolution and loosely resembled the distinction between comedy and tragedy."&lt;ref name="Rocchi"/&gt; ''Pièces noires'' or "Black plays" were tragedies or realistic dramas and included ''Antigone'', ''Jézabel'', and ''La Sauvage'' (''The Restless Heart'').  This category typically featured "young,  idealistic, and uncompromising protagonists [who] are able to maintain their integrity only by choosing death."&lt;ref name="Brockett483"/&gt;  By contrast, Anouilh's ''pièces roses'' or "pink plays" were comedies where fantasy dominated with an atmosphere similar to that of fairy tales. In these plays such as ''Le Bal des voleurs'' (''Carnival of Thieves''), ''Le Rendez-vous de Senlis'' (''Dinner with the Family'') and ''[[Léocadia]]'' (''Time Remembered''), the focus is on "the burden of the environment and especially of the past on a protagonist seeking a happier, freer existence."&lt;ref name="Carlson"/&gt;

Most of Anouilh's plays of the late 1940s and into the 1950s become darker and distinctly cruel and, in contrast with his earlier works, begin to feature middle-aged characters who must view life more practically than Anouilh's former idealistic youths. The playwright divided the works of this period into ''pièces brillantes'' ("brilliant plays") and ''pièces grinçantes'' ("grating plays"). The first group includes works such as ''L'Invitation au château'' (Ring Round the Moon) and ''Colombe'', and are typified by aristocratic settings and witty banter. The grating plays like ''[[The Waltz of the Toreadors|La Valse des toréadors]]'' (''Waltz of the Toreadors'') and ''Le Réactionnaire amoureux'' (''The Fighting Cock'') are more bitterly funny, trading clever word play for a darker tone of disillusionment.

Another category Anouilh specifies are his ''pièces costumées'' ("costume plays") which include ''The Lark'', ''La Foire d'Empoigne'' (''Catch as Catch Can''), and ''Becket'', an international success, depicting the historical martyr [[Thomas Becket]], the Archbishop of Canterbury who sought to defend the church against the monarch (and his friend), [[Henry II of England]], who had appointed him to his see. So classified because they share historical "costumed" settings, Anouilh also specifies that these plays must also prominently feature an enlightened protagonist seeking "a moral path in a world of corruption and manipulation."&lt;ref name="Carlson"/&gt;

Anouilh's final period begins with ''La Grotte'' (''The Cavern''), in which he comments on his own progress as a writer and a theatre artist. The central character is a playwright suffering from writer's block who in his frustration recalls the foibles of [[Luigi Pirandello]]'s ''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]''. Anouilh's work had always contained hints of [[metatheatre|metatheatricality]], or commentary on the business of theatre within the world of the play, but in his late works these structures became more fully developed as he begins to write primarily about character who are dramatists or theatre directors. There is also a pronounced link, during this time, of Anouilh's emphasis of theatre and the family, displaying intimate relationships that are "more profound and more important than the traditional heightened action of 'theatre'&amp;thinsp;".{{whose quote|dated=October 2016}} Antoine, the playwright-protagonist of ''Cher Antoine; ou, L'Amour raté'' (''Dear Antoine; or, The Love That Failed''), asserts that the world must take notice of these ''pièces secrètes'' (secret dramas) and Anouilh scholars have proposed this name, ''pièces secrètes'', to classify the collected works of his latest period."&lt;ref name="Carlson"/&gt;{{clarify|date=October 2016}}&lt;!--one double-quotation mark missing; quotation uncertain.--&gt;

===Political controversy===
Anouilh remained staunchly apolitical for most of his life and career. He served in the military during at least two periods, having been drafted into the French Army in 1931 and 1939. He was a prisoner of war for a short time when the Germans conquered France and willingly lived and worked in Paris during the subsequent [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation]]. Because he refused to take sides during France's collaboration with the [[Axis Alliance]] some critics have branded him as a potential Nazi sympathiser.  This controversy escalated as a result of Anouilh's public clashes with leader of the [[Free French Forces]] (and later President of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]]), [[Charles de Gaulle|General Charles de Gaulle]].  In the mid-1940s Anouilh and several other intellectuals signed a petition for clemency to save the writer [[Robert Brasillach]], who was condemned to death for being a Nazi collaborator. Brasillach was executed by firing squad in February 1945, despite the outcry from Anouilh and his peers that the new government had no right to persecute individuals for "intellectual crimes" in the absence of military or political action.&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt; Nevertheless, Anouilh refused to comment on his political views, writing in a letter to the Belgian critic Hubert Gignoux in 1946, "I do not have a biography and I am very happy about it. The rest of my life, as long as God wills it, will remain my personal business, and I will withhold the details of it."&lt;ref name="Ginestier"/&gt;
Anouilh's plays provide the most important clues about his political point of view, though their reputation for ambiguity further complicates the matter. For instance ''Antigone'', provides an [[allegory|allegorical]] representation of the debate between the idealistic members of the [[French Resistance]] and the pragmatism of the collaborationists. Though many have read the play as having a strong anti-Nazi sentiment, the fact that the Vichy Regime allowed the piece to be performed without censure testifies to the fact that it was potentially seen as supportive of the occupation in its time.&lt;ref name="Wiles"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Krauss"/&gt;  Though the playwright romanticizes Antigone's sense of honor and duty to what is morally right, in this case resisting the Nazi forces, it can also be said that Anouilh, like Sophocles before him, makes a convincing argument for Creon's method of leadership.&lt;ref name="Smith2426"/&gt;

===Awards and recognition===
In 1970 his work was recognized with the ''[[Prix mondial Cino Del Duca]]''. In 2012, the Nobel Records were opened after 50 years and it was revealed that Anouilh was among a shortlist of authors considered for the 1962 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], along with John Steinbeck (winner), [[Robert Graves]], [[Lawrence Durrell]] and [[Karen Blixen]].&lt;ref name=floodjan2013&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/03/swedish-academy-controversy-steinbeck-nobel |title=Swedish Academy reopens controversy surrounding Steinbeck's Nobel prize |work=[[The Guardian]] |author=Alison Flood |date=3 January 2013 |accessdate=January 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report in ''The Guardian'', "It is not clear why Anouilh was passed over, but the French poet [[Saint-John Perse]] had taken the Nobel in 1960, meaning that France was well represented on the roster of winners, and ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'' reveals that [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], who won the prize in 1964, was starting to be seriously considered as a candidate."&lt;ref name=floodjan2013/&gt;

In 1980, he was the first recipient of the [[Grand prix du théâtre (Académie française)|Grand Prix du Théâtre de l'Académie française]] established that year.

==Critical discussion==
By the end of his career, Anouilh's reputation outstripped all his contemporaries. However, his repertoire remained unusually confined to theatre and film. Most French dramatists of the 1930s and 1940s, including Anouilh's most significant contemporary influence, Giraudoux, not only wrote for the stage but also composed poetry, novels, or essays.&lt;ref name="Rocchi"/&gt; Nevertheless, he remained prolific, consistently producing and publishing performance works for more than fifty years.

Anouilh's early works were "naturalistic studies of a sordid and corrupt world."&lt;ref name="Liukkonen"/&gt; Many of these plays present the reader with the striking and inescapable dichotomy between pragmatism and a sort of transcendent idealism.  There is little to no "middle ground of ambiguity" that exists where this conflict asserts itself.&lt;ref name="Pucciani"/&gt; This is evidenced in ''Le Voyageur Sans Bagage.'' The main character Gaston, a World War I veteran who suffers from amnesia, cannot remember the moral depravity of his youth (he slept with his brother's wife and severely injured his best friend). This checkered past is invariably at odds with the near-angelic behavior that he now exhibits, and recognition of this truth forces him to leave his former identity behind, unable to reconcile the two sides of himself. In denouncing his past, Gaston reclasses his freedom as an illusion, but one of his own making. He befriends a young English boy and shows him his identifying scar; this gesture allows the boy to describe Gaston to the authorities, thereby claiming him as kin. With a new life and a new family, Gaston has a fresh start.&lt;ref name="Rocchi"/&gt;  David I. Grossvogel, describes this situation as the "restoration of a childhood paradise lost," attributing ''Le Voyageur Sans Bagage'' as the beginning of Anouilh's search to justify the unhappiness of his youth.&lt;ref name="Grossvogel"/&gt; Theatre historian Marvin Carlson agrees, noting that this play epitomizes the "complex tonality and deft dramatic technique" that remained throughout his work, though, he asserts, it was only as the playwright matured that his "dark view of the human condition [reached] its final expression."&lt;ref name="Carlson"/&gt;

Anouilh disagreed with these somber readings of his best works, however, arguing that, like all great French literature, his plays had found ways to laugh at misfortune. "Thanks to Molière," Anouilh said, "the true French theatre is the only one that is not gloomy, in which we laugh like men at war with our misery and our horror. This humor is one of France's messages to the world."&lt;ref name="Hotchman"/&gt;

Disclosing his thoughts on French theatre and his personal perspective as a playwright, he said that the perception of his work was often misguided:

{{quote|I am played in private theaters, so I write for the bourgeoisie.  One has to rely on the people who pay for their places; the people who support the theater are bourgeois.  But this public has changed:  They have such a terror of not being in touch, of missing out on a fashionable event that they no longer exist as a decisive force.  I think the public has lost its head.  They now say that a play can't be that good if they can understand it.  My plays are not hermetic enough.  It's rather Molièresque, don't you think?|author=Jean Anouilh&lt;ref name="Porter"/&gt;}}

In the 1950s, Anouilh examined his antagonism with General de Gaulle in ''L'Hurluberlu, ou Le Reactionnaire amoureux'' (1958) and ''Le Songe du critique'' (1960). He began to lose the favor of audiences and critics alike, however, with the emergence of such playwrights as [[Eugène Ionesco]] and [[Samuel Beckett]]. Though he shared with these authors a "similar desperate vision of human existence,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Liukkonen|first=Petri and Ari Pesonen|title=Jean Anouilh (1910-1987)}}&lt;/ref&gt; these new absurdist theatres' pursuit of alternative dramaturgies made Anouilh's semi-realistic plays seem dull and old-fashioned. In the 1980s Anouilh reinvented himself as a director, staging his own plays as well as those of other authors. He died of a heart attack in Lausanne, Switzerland on 3 October 1987. By then divorced from Monelle Valentin, he was survived by his second wife, Nicole Lançon, and four children.

Born on [[Maltus (comics)|Maltus]], Krona is an Oan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|Writer = [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]|Cowriters =|Penciller = [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]|Copencillers =|Inker = [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]|Coinkers = [[Keith Williams (comics)|Keith Williams]]|Story = Hell Is Where the Heart Is...|Title = Action Comics|Volume =|Issue = #596|Date = January 1988|Publisher = DC Comics|Page = 4|Panel =|ID =}}&lt;/ref&gt; scientist who became obsessed with observing the origins of the universe itself, despite an ancient legend that said discovering that secret would cause a great calamity. Krona constructs a machine that pierces the temporal barrier and views the beginnings of time itself. Krona catches a glimpse of the hand of creation depositing the speck that would become the entire cosmos. His machine explodes at that instant, and the universe is shattered causing the creation of the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] as the universe replicates into an infinite number of [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]]. At this same moment, the Anti-Matter Universe is created, unleashing evil into the cosmos; thus, the [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]] and the [[Anti-Monitor]] are born. As punishment for this act, Krona is transformed into pure energy by his fellow Oans and is sent to forever wander the cosmos. Krona's actions are what caused the Oans to become the [[Guardians of the Universe]].&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 1) #40 (Oct. 1965); ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #7–10 (October 1985 – January 1986); ''History of the DC Universe'' #1 (1988); ''Green Lantern: Ganthet's Tale'' (March 1992); ''Zero Hour: Crisis in Time'' #4-0 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

Krona returns to a physical state using the energies of [[Alan Scott]]'s mystical power ring, but is again turned into his energy form by the Guardians.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' #40 (vol. 1, Oct. 1965)&lt;/ref&gt; Krona is finally restored to his original form thanks to [[Nekron]]—who gained additional power due to the anomaly of an immortal entering the realm of the dead when the Guardians kill him—and attempts to kill all of the Guardians, only to be narrowly defeated by the weakened Green Lantern Corps.&lt;ref&gt;''Tales of the Green Lantern Corps'' #1–3 (May–July 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

Krona later resurfaces as the manifestation of Entropy itself and battles the [[New Guardians]].&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 3) #32–35 (November 1992 – January 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross-universal threat===
{{main|JLA/Avengers}}
While trying to discover the secret of universal creation, Krona destroys entire universes, eventually arriving in the [[Marvel Universe]]. There he confronts the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]],&lt;ref&gt;''JLA/Avengers'' #1 (September 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; who, in an attempt to save his universe, informs Krona of the existence of a being in the Marvel Universe who has witnessed the Big Bang. In exchange for Krona not destroying this universe, the Grandmaster and he will play a game; two teams, one from each universe, seek out 12 items of great power, six from each universe. Should Krona's team (the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]) win, Grandmaster will give the knowledge Krona seeks in return for not destroying his universe. But when Grandmaster's team (the [[Justice League]]) wins—thanks in part to [[Batman]], [[Captain America]] and the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]] having discovered the nature of the game in time to ensure that the League win instead of declaring a draw—Krona strikes down the Grandmaster in a rage, draining his knowledge to learn the identity of the being he spoke of, allowing him to summon [[Galactus]]. He then repeats the process with Galactus,&lt;ref&gt;''JLA/Avengers'' #2 (October 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; but the Grandmaster tricks him and uses the power of the items to lock Krona at the multiversal junction point, having linked the two universes together.&lt;ref&gt;''JLA/Avengers'' #3 (November 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grandmaster's hopes are dashed, though, when it becomes evident Krona would continue even in his extremely dangerous location in his insane quest to view the birth of a universe despite the risks posed to himself. Even from there, he continued his onslaught to destroy both the Marvel and DC universes in order to create a new one, so that he could watch creation first-hand. He forces them closer together, causing reality to warp wildly, and even making items and people switch worlds. He is briefly disrupted by the efforts of the [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]], but then continues his experiments. After being told what has happened by a dying Grandmaster, the two teams get to Krona's stronghold, led by Captain America and coordinated by the Martian Manhunter, pitting them against various brainwashed villains and increasing the scale of his 'recruits' as the heroes defeat each wave. He nearly kills all of both teams as they penetrate his final wave of defences—even with Superman wielding [[Captain America's shield]] and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s [[Mjolnir (comics)|hammer]]— but [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and the Flash ([[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]), who had earlier faked their deaths, stop his plan, Hawkeye firing a [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] arrow at Krona's machinery. The blast was immense, and ended up sucking Krona into the universe seed called the [[World egg|Cosmic Egg]]. The [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] then pushes the worlds apart and reality returns to normal.&lt;ref&gt;''JLA/Avengers'' #4 (December 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

This egg is kept and studied in the JLA headquarters. Its fluctuations are a matter of intense scrutiny in the "Syndicate Rules" storyline,&lt;ref&gt;''JLA'' #107–114 (December 2004–July 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; during which it is speculated that the reconstruction of the universes also altered the original 'rules' that allowed the League and the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Syndicate]] to always win on their home ground, requiring each to fight harder in the future. After the League believes they have the situation under control, they implement tighter scans on the egg, to register alarms at even the most minor of fluctuations. At the end of the storyline, the New God [[Metron (comics)|Metron]] places several devices around the egg, so as to feed false readings to the League and to let the egg develop without interference.

===Trinity===
{{main|Trinity (comic book)}}
The Cosmic Egg is taken by [[Despero]] in the [[Trinity (comic book)|Trinity series]].&lt;ref name="Trinity #7"&gt;''Trinity'' #7&lt;/ref&gt; It is used by [[Despero]], [[Morgaine le Fey (DC Comics)|Morgaine le Fey]] and [[Enigma (DC Comics)|Enigma]] to create powerful monsters, and was later used in a ritual to reshape the world.&lt;ref name="Trinity #7"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Trinity'' #17&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of these events, Krona is freed. He recruits some [[Controllers (comics)|Controllers]] in an attempt to communicate with the consciousness of the universe, but is double-crossed by them, who attempt to absorb and study his energies. In retaliation, Krona destroys them and their lab planet, only to hear the planet's consciousness "freed" from its "prison". Krona then sets out to do the same for many other planets.&lt;ref&gt;''Trinity'' #20&lt;/ref&gt;

Krona is later approached by Morgaine and her allies, seeking his power to fend off the returned Trinity ([[Superman]], [[Batman]], and [[Wonder Woman]]). Morgaine offers the planet Earth's consciousness in return, intending to replace it with the soul of Enigma's daughter.&lt;ref&gt;''Trinity'' #45&lt;/ref&gt;

Krona accepts and a lengthy battle ensues between him, the JLA, JSA, Titans, Teen Titans, the God-like trinity consisting of Superman, Wonder Woman and Batman, and other various heroes, aliens and villains. During the height of the battle Krona is imprisoned due to the united efforts of several heroes and villains, but is set free by Morgaine, finally snapped, claiming that if she cannot have the world, then nobody shall. Following that, Krona unleashes his powers and destroys the Earth.

Moments after Earth's destruction he encounters its essence, the Worldsoul, which continuously alters its form between a little girl, an adult woman and an old hag. Krona inquires about the law of universes, wishing to know how the Worldsoul and other entities like it function and exist, hoping to learn of some higher plan or design. However, he is horrified to learn that the Worldsoul has no actual function other than to simply exist, resonate and, most importantly, to ''feel'', to share in the positive emotions of every lifeform that dwells upon its surface, at one with the Universe in a Great Dance with the other souls of worlds. This explanation, such as it is, defies all logic and science Krona has studied, and he believes this renders himself and his entire life, in effect, pointless. In a fit of rage, he attempts to destroy the Worldsoul, but is stopped by the Trinity, who have survived the destruction of Earth. Combining their powers with that of the Worldsoul, they imprison Krona and reform the Earth, restoring everything and everyone to the way it was prior to its destruction, even the supervillains of the planet.&lt;ref&gt;''Trinity'' #50&lt;/ref&gt; Krona's ultimate fate was to be remade as the Worldsoul of Earth-1, this time imprisoned for all eternity.

===War of the Green Lanterns===
After the events of the ''[[Blackest Night]]'', a cloaked stranger appears on Ryut, walking near an ancient temple with seven pillars marked with the symbols of the Emotional Spectrum and plotting against the Lantern Corps.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #53 (May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first act of this stranger's plan occurs with the abduction of the fear entity, [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]], during the finale of "Blackest Night", imprisoning the creature within the pillar marked with the symbol of the Sinestro Corps. He then proceeds to remove the willpower entity, [[Ion (DC Comics)|Ion]], from [[Sodam Yat]], effectively turning Daxam's sun from yellow back to red and killing hundreds of Daxamites in the process,&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #54 (June 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; and later helps [[Hector Hammond]] get out of prison, to pursue the [[Larfleeze#Entity|Avarice Entity]] which is trapped inside [[Larfleeze]]'s lantern.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #56 (June 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The stranger is also shown working with [[Hank Henshaw]] (Cyborg Superman), telling him that enslaving and altering the qualities of the Alpha Lanterns will restore his mortality. He is also shown working with the telepathic Zardor in his plot to brainwash rookie members of the Green Lantern Corps that will lead to the destruction of the Green Lantern Corps.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #50 (July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The stranger also freed [[Lyssa Drak]] from the Book of the Black, and informs her that her assistance is required since another book will soon be made and a keeper is needed.&lt;ref&gt;''Untold Tales of Blackest Night'' (October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The stranger later appears on the Eastern Seaboard of the United States—with an obedient Parallax in tow—where he faces [[Hal Jordan]], [[Blue Lantern Corps#Entity|Nicole Morrison]], [[Larfleeze]], [[Blue Lantern Corps#Prominent members|Saint Walker]] and the [[Indigo Tribe]], seeking to obtain both the hope entity, [[Blue Lantern Corps#Entity|Adara]], and the compassion entity, [[Indigo Tribe#Entity|Proselyte]], for his collection.

When the figure captures the entities by ripping Proselyte and Adara from their hosts, he is confronted by Jordan. The figure finally reveals himself as Krona, the rogue Guardian, long believed dead – the bandages serving to help restore his body after the damage he has sustained in his previous encounters – and tells that prior to his banishment by the Guardians, he was the caretaker responsible for protecting the entities, which explains how he's aware of the orange power of avarice and its location as revealed during Hal Jordan's first encounter with Larfleeze,&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #60 (December 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; and that is why he can control them and the abilities they possess.

Despite the combined efforts of the New Guardians (sans Sinestro and Carol Ferris), Krona still managed to overwhelm them with the assistance of Ophidian. Immobilized by Ophidian's disruptive powers, Krona discovered the location of the Butcher from the avarice entity, and expunged it from Atrocitus's power battery. As Hal struggled with his defiance, Krona unleashed the power of all of the entities, effectively defeating the New Guardians. Having no other reason for staying on Earth, Krona left with the entities in tow.&lt;ref name="Green Lantern 2011"&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #62 (March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Later as Hal Jordan, Larfleeze, Atrocitus, Saint Walker, Indigo-1 and a returned Sinestro tried to reach Zamaron, since the entity of love was the only one still free, they found instead a delusioned Carol Ferris who tells them that Krona had captured the Predator. Through Indigo-1 they follow Krona to the Dead Planet of Ryut where they found the Book of the Black, which after detecting the presence of the "New Guardians" opened its pages to unveil the history of Krona, revealing that it was Krona that was responsible for the [[Manhunters (DC Comics)|Manhunters]]' programming glitch, which resulted in the annihilation of Sector 666. He did it to prove that there were flaws in an emotionless police force. He was also the one who created a gauntlet that harnessed Willpower which was the basis for the Green Lantern Power Ring. When he became the keeper of the emotional entities, he used the gauntlet to harness their powers and named it the Gauntlet of Power, since it could harness all emotions.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #63 (April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[War of the Green Lanterns]]'', Krona, along with the emotional entities, launched an attack on Oa, attacking the six remaining Guardians (with Ganthet working in the Anti-Matter universe at the time), by having them possessed by all the entities, except for Parallax, who is placed inside the Central Power Battery. With the yellow impurity returned to the Central Power Battery, all of the Green Lanterns—even the experienced wielders, with the apparent exception of the Green Lanterns who had been possessed by Parallax before—are placed under Krona's control, revealing that they could not overcome the fear associated with it as the Guardians had thought.&lt;ref name="Green Lantern 2011"/&gt; Even the Alpha Lanterns are affected by the yellow impurity which made them enter into some kind of hibernation.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern Corps'' #58 (March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The former Guardian then declares that he will show the universe the true power of the Green Lanterns.&lt;ref name="Green Lantern 2011"/&gt; However, despite his attempts to stop them by using [[Mogo]] against them, Hal Jordan, John Stewart, Guy Gardner and Kyle Rayner are able to escape Krona and fight back by using the rings of the other Corps— Hal wielding a Sinestro and an Orange ring, Guy a Red and a Star Sapphire, Kyle a Blue, and John an Indigo— to escape Parallax's influence long enough to kill Mogo&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #60 (May 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; and extract Parallax from the Power Battery.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern: Emerald Warriors'' #10 (May 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Undaunted, Krona uses all seven varieties of power ring at once, attacking Hal Jordan and the freed Sinestro (who had just been selected by another green ring). Despite his greater power, Krona is eventually killed by Hal Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (Vol. 4) #67 (July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, the Guardians of the Universe then wish to honor the fallen Guardian by putting him in the crypt on Oa, along with other dead Lanterns. Many Lanterns disagree with their decision and journey to the Crypt where they encounter [[Salaak]] creating a space for Krona. Later, Ganthet honors his promise to Atrocitus and gives Krona's corpse to him to do as he wishes.&lt;ref&gt;''War of the Green Lanterns: Aftermath'' #2 (August 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The New 52===
Following the ''[[War of the Green Lanterns]]'', it is revealed that [[Atrocitus]] has kept Krona's corpse as a 'confidant', talking to the body when he needs to give voice to his feelings about the [[Red Lantern Corps]] and his plans to upgrade their intelligence. However, after granting intellects to three Red Lanterns, Atrocitus returns to the place where he has left Krona's body only to find it gone.&lt;ref&gt;''Red Lanterns'' #4 (December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Although Atrocitus attempts to find Krona's body, he is left to consider both the worrying possibility that Krona has come back to life,&lt;ref&gt;''Red Lanterns'' #5 (January 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; when faced with a revolt from Bleez, Atrocitus starts to wonder if the loss of Krona's body has robbed him of the focus of his rage, as he has begun to try and justify his actions where he previously considered his mere identity enough of a justification.&lt;ref&gt;''Red Lanterns'' #6 (February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Krona's body, however, is found to be possessed by Abysmus, a demonic entity created by the earliest experiments of Atrocitus with shamanistic and necromantic magic, who willingly ate his body and flayed his skin to empower himself and a race of similar creatures, the so-called Abysmorphs.&lt;ref&gt;''Red Lanterns'' #7 (March 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the events of 'Rise of the Third Army', in the opening of 'Wrath of the First Lantern', it is revealed that Krona's history has been changed: although he attempted to observe the beginning of the universe, the cosmos-spanning hand now bears a Lantern Power ring and when the viewscreen explodes, it is because a time-travelling ship has just arrived. From the ship, appears the mysterious Volthoom.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 5) #17 (February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; During a conversation with Atrocitus, Krona's spirit-which manifests as a result of Abysmus's manipulations-claims that he became caught up in his work after his wives and child were killed in an accident, but Atrocitus dismisses the idea that this excuses his later actions; moments later, the newly freed Volthoom disperses Krona's spirit, apparently ending the last remnants of his existence.&lt;ref&gt;''Red Lanterns'' #17&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also revealed that Krona's banishment from the Guardians of the Universe was not from the result of his machinations, but because he issued the order to the Manhunters to destroy Sector 666.&lt;ref name="rl17"&gt;''Red Lanterns'' #17 (February 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Lost Army===
A very alive Krona later finds John Stewart, Kilowog, Arisia, Two-Six and new Lantern Xrill-Vrek in a seeming hostile territory, long way from home. Given that this Krona is back to his Maltusan look, does not recognize any of the Green Lanterns and that the Green Lantern rings cannot locate anyone or the Central Power Battery, provides a little clue as to what has happened. Either they have been displaced to another universe, another time, or both.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lanterns: Lost Army'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Krona possesses a supreme [[genius]]-level [[intellect]], but his arrogance, lack of patience, short temper and above all insatiable hunger for knowledge have gotten the better of him. If it brought him any benefit, he would be the sort to attempt to quantify dance or measure a soul, solely for the sake of knowing. It is this madness that got Krona exiled and brought about his constant defeats. He has unhesitatingly destroyed universes and risked his own existence for a chance to gain deeper insight.

Like the rest of his species, Krona possesses enhanced physical abilities, vast [[psionic]] powers (including [[telepathy]] and [[telekinesis]]) and virtual [[immortality]] (he does not need to [[breathing|breathe]], [[eat]] or [[sleep]], and can [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] from any [[injury]] at an accelerated rate). His powers were later increased by [[Nekron]], making him more powerful than any of the Guardians.

As [[Entropy (comics)|Entropy]], Krona was composed of anti-energy, could absorb others into his body, converting them into more anti-energy, and was able to create an army composed of anti-energy that were completely under his control. During the ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'' [[miniseries]], where he wielded the power of all the universes he had previously destroyed, Krona proved able to easily defeat both the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] and [[Galactus]], although the Grandmaster's power was sufficient to make him initially hesitant at the prospect of fighting the other being until his attempt to beat the Grandmaster in a game to gain the information he sought failed.

Also, as the caretaker of the Emotional entities which are the pure embodiments of the emotions comprising the Emotional Spectrum, Krona wields the powers of the entire emotional spectrum.

'''''Little Jimmy''''', originally titled '''''Jimmy''''', was a newspaper comic strip created by [[Jimmy Swinnerton]]. With a publication history from February 14, 1904, to 1958, it was one of the first continuing features and one of the longest running.

==Characters and story==
The title character was a little boy who was constantly forgetting what he was supposed to do and ended up getting into trouble. As comics historian [[Don Markstein]] described:
{{quote|Jimmy was a wide-eyed innocent, but easy prey to the foibles of little boys. He'd constantly forget what task he was about and wander off to do boyish things, to the great consternation of the adults in his life. He also had a considerable propensity for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, which often triggered outlandishly action-packed consequences. His constant companions were his even smaller friend, Pinkey, and his dog, Beans. A supporting character added a few years later was Li'l Ol' Bear, strongly reminiscent of the cartoonist's first feature, ''The Little Bears''.&lt;ref name=toonopedia&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/jimmy.htm ''Little Jimmy''] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]. [https://www.webcitation.org/6cwgrBRxa Archived] from the original on November 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The strip first appeared sporadically in'' [[New York Journal American|The New York Journal]]''. It soon became a regular in the [[Sunday comics]] section and was picked up as a feature in other newspapers owned by [[William Randolph Hearst]]. When [[King Features Syndicate]] was created in 1915, ''Little Jimmy'' went into nationwide syndication. In 1920, a daily strip was added and ran until the late 1930s. The [[Sunday strip]] continued until Swinnerton retired in 1958.

Markstein noted that Swinnerton "drew his strip in a clear, open style, unlike most cartoonists of his time. In this, he anticipated dominant styles of the 20th century, less crowded and more easily read — quite appropriate for newsprint production, where the printing isn't always as clear as it should be."&lt;ref name=toonopedia /&gt;

==Animation==
Little Jimmy appeared in silent film animation and later in the 1936 [[Betty Boop]] film ''[[Betty Boop and Little Jimmy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bcdb title|1537}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Little Jimmy Camp in the [[Angeles National Forest]], near Los Angeles, California, is named after the comic strip in honor of Swinnerton, who once stayed there.{{cn|date=August 2012}}

[[File:Lunapark Elektroturm modified.jpg|thumb|right|alt=[[Luna Park, Coney Island (1903)|Luna Park, Coney Island]] was the first of dozens of Luna Parks. Its success inspired the creation of dozens of Luna Parks, [[Electric Park]]s, and similar amusement parks.|The "Electric Tower", centerpiece of the original [[Luna Park, Coney Island (1903)|Luna Park]] on Coney Island, ''ca.'' 1905. Many subsequent [[amusement park]]s that took the name "Luna Park" had their own central towers.]]

'''Luna Park''' is a name shared by dozens of currently operating and defunct [[amusement park]]s. They are named after, and partly based on, the first [[Luna Park, Coney Island (1903)|Luna Park]], which opened in 1903 during the heyday of large [[Coney Island, New York]], parks.

==History==
The original Luna Park on Coney Island, a massive spectacle of rides, ornate towers and cupolas covered in 250,000 electric lights, was opened in 1903 by the showmen and entrepreneurs Frederic Thompson and Elmer "Skip" Dundy. The park was either named after the fanciful airship Luna, part of the new park's central attraction [[A Trip to the Moon (attraction)|A Trip to the Moon]], or after Dundy's sister.&lt;ref&gt;Dale Samuelson, AJP Samuelson, and Wendy Yegoiants, ''The American Amusement Park'' {{ISBN|0-7603-0981-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coney Island's success with electronic attractions and rides also inspired a proliferation of parks named [[Electric Park]] (Samuelson, Samuelson, Yegoiants, ''The American Amusement Park'').&lt;/ref&gt; Luna Park was a vastly expanded attraction built partly on the grounds of [[Sea Lion Park]], the first enclosed amusement park on Coney Island which closed down due to competition from near by [[Steeplechase Park]].

In 1905, [[Frederick Ingersoll]], who was already making a reputation for his pioneering work in roller coaster construction and design (he also designed [[Roller_coaster#Scenic_railways|scenic railroad]] rides) borrowed the name when he opened [[Luna Park, Pittsburgh|Luna Park in Pittsburgh]] and [[Luna Park, Cleveland|Luna Park in Cleveland]]. These first two amusement parks, like their namesake, were covered with electric lighting (the former was adorned with 67,000 light bulbs;&lt;ref name="Jim Futrell 2002"&gt;Jim Futrell, ''Amusement Parks of Pennsylvania'' (Flagpole Books, 2002) {{ISBN|0-8117-2671-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter, 50,000&lt;ref name="post-gazette.com"&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08245/908516-42.stm Luna Park's luminary: Entrepreneur/roller coaster designer deserves his due] – ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'', 1 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;). Later, in 1907, [[Charles Looff]] opened another [[Luna Park (Seattle)|Luna Park]] in Seattle, Washington. Ultimately, Ingersoll opened 44 Luna Parks around the world, the first chain of amusement parks. For a short time, Ingersoll renamed his parks '''Ingersoll's Luna Park''' to distinguish them from the Luna Parks to which he had no connection.&lt;ref name="Robert Cartmell 1987"&gt;Robert Cartmell, ''The Incredible Scream Machine'' (Popular Press 1987) {{ISBN|0-87972-342-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ingersoll's death in 1927 and the closing of most of his Luna Parks did not stop new parks from taking the name.

Today, the term ''luna park'' or ''lunapark'' means "amusement park" in several European languages.

'''MasterImage 3D''' is a company that develops [[stereoscopic 3D]] systems for theaters, and [[Autostereoscopy|auto-stereoscopic]] 3D displays for [[mobile device]]s.

==3D Cinema Technology==
The MasterImage 3D MI-CLARITY3D system for cinemas is a [[polarized 3D system]] that is based on the projector presenting a spinning polarized filter, which contains alternating segments of circularly polarized material. Mounted in front of the projector lens, this filter is synchronized to the projected images, giving each frame a polarization perpendicular to the previous one, which can be viewed with [[polarized 3D glasses]]. The filter wheel can be lowered out of the lens' path for non-3D material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://masterimage3d.com/products/cinema-system "MasterImage Digital 3D Cinema System] November 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted that an earlier version of the spinning polarized filter malfunctioned, but the problem has been addressed with an updated replacement filter which was supplied to all theaters using the system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/19991006020409/http://film-tech.com/ Film-Tech (Independent Cinema Technical Site)] November 23, 2010 This site disables direct linking. See Forums, "Straight to Video" (the name of their digital cinema forum), thread entitled "Master Image VS. Real D."&lt;/ref&gt; MasterImage 3D offers different types of 3D cinema technology (including those based on a polarized filter disc, as well as solid-state liquid crystal), based on different cinema configurations. The company also produces passive [[3D eyewear]] that is optically matched to their 3D systems.

==Auto-Stereoscopic Cell-Matrix 3D Technology==

MasterImage 3D also produces [[Autostereoscopy|auto-stereoscopic]] displays for [[smartphones]] and [[tablet computer|tablets]], which allow devices to present 3D images without the need for glasses. MasterImage 3D provides screens ranging from 4.3 inches to 10.1 inches. They achieve the effect through its patented Cell-Matrix Parallax Barrier technology, which uses a cell-gap approach that enables landscape and portrait modes, provides a 10 degree viewing angle, and reduces the Moire pattern that causes ghosting. MasterImage 3D's auto-stereoscopic display was used in one of the world's first glasses-free 3D mobile phones, the Hitachi Wooo, available in Japan in 2009. Another device featuring the MasterImage 3D Cell-Matrix 3D display, the Micromax A115 Canvas 3D, was released in April 2013.

[[Image:Versailles M2.JPG|thumb|right|330px|The [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] menagerie during the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]]]
A '''menagerie''' is a collection of captive animals, frequently exotic, kept for display; or the place where such a collection is kept, a precursor to the modern [[Zoo|zoological garden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=menagerie |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/menagerie |website=Merriam-Webster On-line Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first used in 17th-century [[France]] in reference to the management of household or domestic stock. Later, it came to be used primarily in reference to [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] or royal animal collections. The French-language ''Methodical Encyclopaedia'' of 1782 defines a menagerie as an "establishment of luxury and curiosity". Later on, the term referred also to travelling animal collections that exhibited wild animals at fairs across [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]].

==Aristocratic menageries==
[[Image:towrlndn.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The [[Tower of London]] housed [[England]]'s royal menagerie for several centuries (Picture from the 15th century, [[British Library]]).]]
A menagerie was mostly connected with an aristocratic or royal court and was situated within a garden or park of a palace. The aristocratic menageries are distinguished from the later [[zoological garden]]s since they were founded and owned by aristocrats whose intentions were not primarily of scientific and educational interest. These aristocrats wanted to illustrate their power and wealth, because exotic animals, alive and active, were less common, more difficult to acquire, and more expensive to maintain.

===Medieval period and Renaissance===
During the [[Middle Ages]], several sovereigns across Europe maintained menageries at their royal courts. An early example is that of the Emperor [[Charlemagne]] in the 8th century. His three menageries, at [[Aachen]], [[Nijmegen]] and [[Ingelheim am Rhein|Ingelheim]], located in present-day [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]], housed the first elephants seen in Europe since the [[Roman Empire]], along with monkeys, lions, bears, camels, falcons, and many exotic birds.  
Charlemagne received exotic animals for his collection as gifts from rulers of Africa and Asia.&lt;ref name=Fisher40&gt;[[James Fisher (naturalist)|Fisher, James]], ''Zoos of the World: The Story of Animals in Captivity'', Aldus Book, London, 1966, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 797, the [[caliph]] of [[Baghdad]], [[Harun al-Rashid]], presented Charlemagne with an Asian elephant named [[Abul-Abbas]]. The pachyderm arrived on July 1, 802 to the Emperor's residence in [[Aachen]]. He died in June 810.&lt;ref&gt;Cardini, Franco, ''Europe and Islam'', Blackwell Publishing, Oxford, 2001, pp. 14–15. {{ISBN|0-631-22637-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] had a small royal menagerie. At his manor, Woodstock, he began a collection of exotic animals. Around the year 1100 his son, Henry I, enclosed Woodstock and enlarged the collection.
At the beginning of the 12th century, [[Henry I of England]] is known to have kept a collection of animals at his palace in [[Woodstock, Oxfordshire|Woodstock]], [[Oxfordshire]], reportedly including [[lion]]s, [[leopard]]s, [[lynx]]es, [[camel]]s, [[owl]]s and a [[porcupine]].&lt;ref name=Blunt15&gt;Blunt, Wilfrid, ''The Ark in the Park: The Zoo in the Nineteenth Century'', Hamish Hamilton, 1976, pp. 15–17. {{ISBN|0-241-89331-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most prominent animal collection in medieval England was the [[Tower of London#Royal Menagerie|Tower Menagerie]] in London that began as early as 1204.
It was established by King [[John of England|John]], who reigned in England from 1199 to 1216 and is known to have held [[lion]]s and [[bear]]s.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;
[[Henry III of England|Henry III]] received a wedding gift in 1235 of three [[leopard]]s from [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]].
The most spectacular arrivals in the early years were a white bear and an elephant, gifts from the kings of [[Norway]] and [[France]] in 1251 and in 1254 respectively.
In 1264, the animals were moved to the Bulwark, which was renamed the Lion Tower, near the main western entrance of the Tower.&lt;ref name=Blunt15/&gt;
This building was constituted by rows of [[cage (enclosure)|cage]]s with arched entrances, enclosed behind grilles. They were set in two storeys, and it appears that the animals used the upper cages during the day and were moved to the lower storey at night.&lt;ref name=ORegan&gt;O'Regan, Hannah, "[http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba68/feat2.shtml From bear pit to zoo]", British Archaeology, No. 68, December 2002, pp. 13–19.&lt;/ref&gt;
The menagerie was opened to the public during the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in the 16th century. During the 18th century, the price of admission was three half-pence, or the supply of a cat or dog to be fed to the [[lion]]s.&lt;ref name=Blunt15/&gt;
Animals recorded here at the end of the 18th century included lions, tigers, hyaenas and bears.
Most of the animals were transferred in 1831 to the newly opened [[London Zoo]] at Regent's Park,&lt;ref name=ORegan/&gt; which did not receive all the animals but rather shared them with [[Dublin Zoo]].&lt;ref name=Mullan109&gt;Mullan, Bob and Marvin, Garry, ''Zoo Culture: The Book about Watching People Watch Animals'', Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1987, p. 109. {{ISBN|0-297-79222-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Tower Menagerie was finally closed in 1835, on the orders of the [[Duke of Wellington]].&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4371908.stm "Big cats prowled London's tower"], [[BBC News]], October 24, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tower Menagerie in London can be considered to have been the royal menagerie of England for six centuries.

In the first half of the thirteenth century, Emperor Frederick II  had three permanent menageries in Italy, at [[Melfi]] in [[Basilicata]], at [[Lucera]] in [[Apulia]] and at [[Palermo]] in [[Sicily]].&lt;ref name=Fisher41&gt;[[James Fisher (naturalist)|Fisher, James]], ''Zoos of the World: The Story of Animals in Captivity'', Aldus Book, London, 1966, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1235, the Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] established at his court in southern [[Italy]] the "first great menagerie" in western [[Europe]]. An elephant, a white bear, a giraffe, a leopard, hyenas, lions, cheetahs, camels and monkeys were all exhibited; but the emperor was particularly interested in [[bird]]s, and studied them sufficiently to write a number of authoritative books on them.&lt;ref name=Hoage8-18&gt;Hoage, Robert J., Roskell, Anne and Mansour, Jane, "Menageries and Zoos to 1900", in ''New World, New Animals: From Menagerie to Zoological Park in the Nineteenth Century'', Hoage, Robert J. and Deiss, William A. (ed.), Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 1996, pp. 8–18. {{ISBN|0-8018-5110-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 15th century, the aristocracy of [[Renaissance Italy]] began to collect exotic animals at their residences on the outskirts of the cities. The role played by animals within the gardens of Italian [[villa]]s expanded at the end of the 16th century and the beginning of the seventeenth century, and one prominent example was the [[Villa Borghese gardens|Villa Borghese]] built 1608–1628 in [[Rome]].&lt;ref name=Baratay43-46&gt;Baratay, Eric and Hardouin-Fugier, Elisabeth, ''Zoo: A History of Zoological Gardens in the West'', Reaktion Books, London, 2002, pp. 43–46. {{ISBN|1-86189-111-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Versailles and its legacy===
[[Image:Kaiserliches Pavillon Schoenbrunn August 2006.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Pavilion]] constructed by Jean-Nicolas Jadot de Ville-Issey in 1759 at the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] menagerie, the contemporary [[Tiergarten Schönbrunn]].]] 
During the seventeenth century, exotic birds and small animals provided diverting ornaments for the court of [[France]]; lions and other large animals were kept primarily to be brought out for staged fight.
The collecting grew and attained more permanent lodgings in the 1660s, when Louis XIV constructed two new menageries: one at Vincennes, next to a palace on the eastern edge of Paris, and a more elaborate one, which became a model for menageries throughout Europe, at Versailles, the site of a royal hunting lodge two hours (by carriage) west of Paris.&lt;ref name=Robbins/&gt;

Around 1661, he had a menagerie of "ferocious" beasts built at Vincennes for the organization of fights. Surrounding a rectangular courtyard, a two-storey building with balconies allowed spectators to view the scene. The animals were housed on the ground floor in cells bordering the courtyard, with small yards on the outside where they could take a bit of exercise.&lt;ref name=Baratay40-41/&gt;
At Vincennes, lions, tigers, and leopards were kept in cages around an amphitheater where the king could entertain courtiers and visiting dignitaries with bloody battles.
In 1682, for instance, the ambassador of Persia enjoyed the spectacle of a fight to the death between a royal tiger and an elephant.&lt;ref name=Robbins/&gt;

When the [[palace of Versailles]] was built, [[Louis XIV]] of [[France]] also erected a menagerie within the palace’s park.&lt;ref name=Baratay48-49/&gt;
The menagerie at Versailles was to be something very different from the one at Vincennes.&lt;ref name=Robbins/&gt;
Most of it was constructed in 1664 when the first animals were introduced, although the interior fittings were not finished until 1668-70. Situated in the south-west of the park, it was Louis XIV’s first major project at Versailles and one of several pleasure houses that were gradually assembled around the palace.&lt;ref name=Baratay48-49&gt;Baratay, Eric and Hardouin-Fugier, Elisabeth, ''Zoo: A History of Zoological Gardens in the West'', Reaktion Books, London, 2002, pp.48-49. {{ISBN|1-86189-111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It represented the first menagerie according to [[Baroque]] style. The prominent feature of Baroque menageries was the circular layout, in the middle of which stood a beautiful pavilion. Around this pavilion was a walking path and outside this path were the enclosures and cages. Each enclosure had a house or stable at the far end for the animals and was bounded on three sides with walls. There were bars only in the direction of the pavilion.&lt;ref name=Kisling82&gt;Strehlow, Harro, "Zoological Gardens of Western Europe", in ''Zoo and Aquarium History: Ancient Collections to Zoological Gardens'', Vernon N. Kisling (ed.), CRC Press, Boca Raton, 2001, p.82. {{ISBN|0-8493-2100-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal fights were halted at Vincennes around 1700, the site fell into disuse, and the animals were installed at Versailles with the others.&lt;ref name=Baratay40-41/&gt;
At about this time, the lions, leopards, and tigers from the menagerie at Vincennes were transferred to Versailles, where they were housed in newly built enclosures fronted with irons bars.&lt;ref name=Robbins&gt;Robbins, Louise E., ''Elephant Slaves and Pampered Parrots: Exotic Animals in Eighteenth-Century Paris'', Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 2002, pp.37-67. {{ISBN|0-8018-6753-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This particular enterprise marked a decisive step in the creation of menageries of curiosities and was imitated to some extent throughout Europe after the late seventeenth century.
Monarchs, princes and important lords built them in France (Chantilly from 1663), England (Kew, Osterley), the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] (Het Loo from 1748), Portugal (Belém in 1726, Queluz around 1780), Spain (Madrid in 1774) and Austria ([[Belvedere (palace)|Belvedere]] in 1716, Schönbrunn in 1752) as well in the Germanic lands following the ravages of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648) and the ensuing reconstruction. [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]], Elector of [[Prussia]], equipped [[Potsdam]] with a menagerie around 1680. The [[Elector of the Palatinate]], the Prince Regent of [[Westphalia]] and many others followed suit.&lt;ref name=Baratay40-41&gt;Baratay, Eric and Hardouin-Fugier, Elisabeth, ''Zoo: A History of Zoological Gardens in the West'', Reaktion Books, London, 2002, pp.40-41. {{ISBN|1-86189-111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This design was adopted particularly by the [[Habsburg]] monarchy in Austria. In 1752 [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]] erected his famous Baroque menagerie in the park of [[Schönbrunn Palace]] near [[Vienna]]. 
Being at first a courtly menagerie with private character it was opened to the general public in 1779. Initially, it was only open for "respectably dressed persons".

Another aristocratic menagerie was founded in 1774 by [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] of [[Spain]] on grounds which were part of the gardens of the [[Parque del Buen Retiro|Buen Retiro]] Palace in [[Madrid]].
During two centuries, it was a predecessor institution of the modern facilities of the [[Zoo Aquarium de Madrid|Madrid Zoo Aquarium]], moved in 1972 to the [[Casa de Campo]].&lt;ref&gt;Historic Madrid: [http://www.turismomadrid.es/INGL/HIST/pagina/HISTLaCasaDeFieras/HISTLaCasaDeFieras.htm The Wild Animal House in the Retiro Park] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108100313/http://www.turismomadrid.es/INGL/HIST/pagina/HISTLaCasaDeFieras/HISTLaCasaDeFieras.htm |date=2009-01-08 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth century the aristocratic menageries were displaced by the modern [[zoological garden]]s with their [[science|scientific]] and [[education]]al approach. The last menagerie in Europe was the [[Tiergarten Schönbrunn]] in Vienna, which was known officially as a "menagerie" until 1924, before evolving into a modern zoological garden with a scientific, educational and [[conservation biology|conservationist]] orientation. Due to its local continuity, the former menagerie established in the medieval through baroque tradition of private wild-animal collections of princes and kings, is often seen as the oldest remaining zoo in the world. Although many of the old Baroque enclosures have been changed, one can still obtain a good impression of the symmetrical ensemble of the formerly imperial menagerie.

==Travelling menageries==
{{main|Travelling menagerie}}
In [[England]] travelling menageries had first appeared at around 1700.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} In contrast to the aristocratic menageries, these travelling animal collections were run by [[showman|showmen]] who met the craving for sensation of the ordinary population.  These animal shows ranged in size but the largest was [[George Wombwell]]'s. The earliest record of a fatality at one such travelling menagerie was the death of [[Hannah Twynnoy]] in 1703 who was killed by a tiger in [[Malmesbury, Wiltshire|Malmesbury]], [[Wiltshire]].
Also in [[North America]] travelling menageries became even more popular during that time.

The first exotic animal known to have been exhibited in America was a lion, in [[Boston]] in 1710, followed a year later in the same city by a camel.&lt;ref name=Kisling147-150/&gt;
A sailor arrived in [[Philadelphia]] in August 1727 with another lion, which he exhibited in the city and surrounding towns for eight years.&lt;ref name=Hancocks86-87&gt;Hancocks, David, ''A different nature: The paradoxical world of zoos and their uncertain future'', University of California Press, Berkeley, 2001, pp.86-87. {{ISBN|0-520-21879-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first [[Asian elephant|elephant]] was imported from [[India]] to America by a ship’s captain, Jacob Crowninshield, in 1796. It was first displayed in [[New York City]] and travelled extensively up and down the East Coast.&lt;ref name=Kisling147-150&gt;Kisling, Vernon N., "Zoological Gardens of the United States", in ''Zoo and Aquarium History: Ancient Collections to Zoological Gardens'', Vernon N. Kisling (ed.), CRC Press, Boca Raton, 2001, pp.147-150. {{ISBN|0-8493-2100-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1834 James and William Howes’ New York Menagerie toured [[New England]] with an [[elephant]], a [[rhinoceros]], a [[camel]], two [[tiger]]s, a [[polar bear]], and several [[parrot]]s and [[monkey]]s.&lt;ref name=Hoage98&gt;Flint, Richard W., "American Showmen and European Dealers: Commerce in Wild Animals in Nineteeth Century", in ''New World, New Animals: From Menagerie to Zoological Park in the Nineteenth Century'', Hoage, Robert J. and Deiss, William A. (ed.), Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 1996, p.98. {{ISBN|0-8018-5110-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

America’s touring menageries slowed to a crawl under the weight of the depression of the 1840s and then to a halt with the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Only one travelling menagerie of any size existed after the war: The Van Amburgh menagerie travelled the [[United States]] for nearly forty years. Unlike their [[Europe]]an counterparts, America’s menageries and [[circus]]es had combined as single travelling shows, with one ticket to see both. This increased the size and the diversity of their collections. [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]] advertised their shows as the “World’s Greatest Menagerie”.&lt;ref name=Hancocks86-87/&gt;

'''Micro Forté Studios''' is an [[Australia]]n electronic entertainment company with development studios in [[Canberra]] and [[Sydney]]. Founded in 1985 by [[John De Margheriti]] at a time when there was little game development presence in Australia, Micro Forté has been closely linked to the growth of the Australian game development industry, with CEO De Margheriti initiating events such as the [[Australian Game Developers Conference]] (AGDC) and founding the [[Academy of Interactive Entertainment]] (AIE) which have helped to lift the profile and create a pool of talent for the industry in Australia.

Micro Forté Studios is primarily a developer of [[massively multiplayer online game]]s and [[virtual world]] content.

==History==
Micro Forté’s first title developed for [[Electronic Arts]] and released in 1986 was the ''[[Americas Cup]] Sailing Simulation'' for the [[Commodore 64]] platform. Their second title also developed for Electronic Arts, ''[[Demon Stalkers]]'' was well received following its release in 1987. The sequel ''Fire King'' was published by SSG [[Strategic Studies Group]] in 1989.

For a number of years the company pursued other activities outside the arena of game development, returning in 1994 to game development creating two children’s titles ''Nordice'' and ''Bombs Away''.
Micro Forté then developed titles for other international publishers including ''Enemy Infestation'' (Panasonic/Ripcord), ''HotWheels Bash Arena'' (THQ), and ''Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel'' (Interplay). Their most widely known title, ''[[Fallout Tactics]]: Brotherhood of Steel'' was published by [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]] and was a squad based tactical game based on the [[Fallout (video game)]] universe, and achieved scores between 80 and 90 from reviewers and fans alike.&lt;ref name = "metacriticreviews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/fallouttacticsbrotherhood?q=fallout%20tactics|title=Fallout Tactics: What the critics said|publisher=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of BigWorld Technology==
In 1994 when Micro Forté returned to game development, the company began work on Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOG) technology. The research and development work was supported with a grant from the Australian Government and venture capital received through Allen &amp; Buckeridge.

Micro Forté spent a number of years concentrating their efforts on developing a technology capable of supporting multiple platforms with more players able to participate in limitless worlds and in the same space. The culmination of years of research and development resulted in BigWorld Technology, which is now a separate commercial company, and provides game developers a cost effective, stable and complete middleware solution to develop MMOG and virtual worlds.

The [[BigWorld]] company was formed in 1999 and the BigWorld Technology Suite was commercialised and launched in 2002. BigWorld is now one of the leading middleware solutions available for developers of online games.

[[Image:Moscow Orphanage asv2018-01.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Orphanage, 2018]]
The '''Moscow Orphanage''' or '''Foundling Home''' ({{lang-ru|Воспитательный дом в Москве}}) was an ambitious project conceived by [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]] and [[Ivan Betskoy]], in the early 1760s. This idealistic experiment of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] was intended to manufacture "ideal citizens" for the Russian state by bringing up thousands of abandoned children to a very high standard of refinement, cultivation, and professional qualifications. Despite more than adequate staffing and financing, the Orphanage was plagued by high infant mortality and ultimately failed as a social institution.

The main building, one of the earliest and largest Neoclassical structures in the city, occupies a large portion of [[Moskvoretskaya Embankment]] between [[the Kremlin]] and [[Yauza River]], boasting a 379-metre frontage on [[Moskva River]]. The complex was built in three stages over two centuries, from [[Karl Blank]]'s master plan (1767) to its complete implementation in the 1940s. Today, the ensemble of the Orphanage houses the [[Soviet military academies|Academy of Missile Forces]] and [[Russian Academy of Medicine]].

==Architecture==
[[Image:Vospitatelny Dom in Moscow 1763.jpg|thumb|275px|[[Karl Blank]]'s plans for the Orphanage, 1760s]]
An outgrowth of the [[Russian Enlightenment]], the idea of a state-run orphanage in Moscow was proposed by educator [[Ivan Betskoy]] and endorsed by [[Catherine II of Russia]] on September 1, 1763. Betskoy envisaged a spacious, strictly controlled, state-of-the-art institution that could raise abandoned infants and train them depending on each child's abilities—in craftsmanship, fine arts, or in preparation for university classes. Children born in slavery were automatically emancipated, and upon graduation could join the state service or the [[Estates of the realm|merchant estate]].

The institution was set on a large lot of land between [[Kitai-gorod]], [[Solyanka Street]], [[Moskva River|Moskva]] and [[Yauza River|Yauza]] rivers, site of a former [[Armory (military)|armoury]]. Construction was financed through a public subscription. The Empress herself pledged 100,000 [[roubles]]; the largest private donations, from [[Demidov|Prokofy Demidov]] and Ivan Betskoy, amounted to 200,000 and 162,995 roubles.&lt;ref name="V2"&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.bmstu.ru/~vil/kniga/o2.htm I. L. Volkevich, History of Moscow Technical University, ch.2]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the master plan by [[Karl Blank]] (assisted by [[Yury Felten]]), the Orphanage was designed as a chain of three square-shaped buildings: the eastern wing for the girls, the western wing for the boys and the central administration block connecting them. The inauguration ceremony, attended by the Empress, was held on April 21, 1764, although the western wing was not completed by Blank until three years later. The central building, constructed between 1771 and 1781, was surmounted by a square dome with a spire. The adjacent [[Moskva River]] embankment was paved in 1795–97 and set in granite in 1801–06.

Although the eastern wing did not materialize, the Orphanage expanded continuously, under the supervision of senior architects [[Giovanni Gilardi]] (1790s-1817) and [[Domenico Gilardi]] (1817–34). Domenico and [[Afanasy Grigoriev]] designed and built the Board of Trustees building facing Solyanka Street. By the mid-19th century, the Orphanage had evolved into "a city within a city" – a largely independent and wealthy institution housing thousands of residents. The bulk of the Orphanage survived the [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|Fire of 1812]] and preserved its original aspect until the mid-20th century.

In the 1940s, the missing eastern wing was finally constructed to a design by [[Alexander Loveyko]], who generally followed Blank's original plans, albeit in a considerably simplified form.

==Early years (1764–1797)==
[[Image:Betskoy Ivan Ivanovich2.jpg|thumb|200px|Portrait of [[Ivan Betskoy]].]]

On the inauguration day, 19 newborn babies were brought to the unfinished Orphanage. Two of them were publicly [[Baptism|baptized]] Catherine and Paul, after the Empress and her heir, but both died soon afterward. This was an early portent of extremely high infant mortality that would be characteristic of the Orphanage in the 18th century.

Of some 40,996 children admitted to the Orphanage during Catherine II's reign, 35,309, or 87%, died during their stay there.&lt;ref name="V2"/&gt; As a result, the vast complex housed only a handful of survivors. A 1792 report listed as few as 257 resident orphans who studied a variety of trades ranging from metallurgy to accountancy.&lt;ref name="V2"/&gt; Several attempts to decrease mortality by passing infants on to [[Foster care|foster families]] did not improve the survival rate. The aged Betskoy could not be relied on for managing the expanding faculty, and the Orphanage became notorious for fraud and [[child abuse]].&lt;ref name="VE"&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.strana-oz.ru/?numid=18&amp;article=873 Alexandra Veselova, Betskoy's Concept]&lt;/ref&gt;

Children lived at the Orphanage until the age of 11, whereupon they were sent for training to local factories and government offices. Some were assigned to the [[Michael Maddox]] theater school; others managed to qualify for free admission to [[Moscow State University]]. 180 students furthered their education in the universities of Western Europe. The majority, however, graduated with little more than a rouble in cash and a [[Internal passport|passport]] (which served to distinguish free men from serfs).

The institution was managed by the Board of Trustees and financed by private donations and two special taxes—a tax on public theater shows and a tax on playing cards. For nearly a century, all playing cards sold in Imperial Russia were taxed 5 kopecks per deck on domestic-made cards and 10 kopecks on imports. As a result, every pack of Russian cards displayed the symbol of the Orphanage, the [[pelican]]. This tax generated 21,000 roubles in 1796 and 140,000 roubles by 1803.

Beginning in 1772, the Orphanage also managed three banks: Loan Treasury, Savings Treasury, and Widows Treasury. These financial institutions, initially plagued by fraud and poor management, became effective and influential under the guidance of [[Maria Feodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg)|Empress Maria]]. By 1828, their total assets exceeded 359 million roubles, the largest capital assets in all of Moscow.&lt;ref name="V3"&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.bmstu.ru/~vil/kniga/o2.htm Volkevich, ch.3]&lt;/ref&gt; This stock was the principal source of cash for the Orphanage throughout the 19th century.

==Orphanage Theatre==
[[File:Vid na Kreml ot Vospitatelnogo doma.jpg|thumb|240px|Moscow Orphanage. By [[Fyodor Alekseyev]], 19th century]]
In 1772, plans began to be formed for a "domestic theatre" affiliated with the Foundling Home. There were classes on acting, and the first production premiered late in 1773. In the course of 1778 alone, the Orphanage Theatre produced twelve comedies, two operas, and several ballets. By October 1783, the troupe of orphans had become so popular that Baron Vanzura petitioned the Empress to open this "home theatre" for the general public. Catherine readily approved the project of a public theatre and presented to the Orphanage a disused wooden building of the [[Golovin Opera House]] near the Yauza. The public Orphanage Theatre was inaugurated on 9 February 1764 with the pantomime ''The Marine Brigands'' and the ballet ''Venus and Adonis''.

The creation of a rival theatre company enraged [[Michael Maddox]], an English entrepreneur who held the monopoly on public entertainment in Moscow. Under his pressure, the Board of Trustees agreed to close the Orphanage Theatre in November 1784, but the orphans were allowed to continue their acting careers on the stage of the [[Bolshoi Theatre|Petrovsky Theatre]], which was run by Maddox.

==Reforms of Empress Maria (1797–1828)==
[[Image:Wiki Solyanka Opekunsky Sovet by Giliardi and Grigoriev.jpg|thumb|240px|The building of the Board of Trustees was erected shortly before [[Maria Feodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg)|Maria's]] death. In the 1820s, the Board controlled Moscow's largest bank.]]
In May 1797 Emperor [[Paul of Russia]] asked his wife, [[Maria Feodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg)|Maria Feodorovna]], to oversee the national charities. Empress Maria remained in charge of the Orphanage and similar institutions after her husband's assassination in 1801 until her death in 1828.

Step by step, Empress Maria changed the social profile of the Orphanage. She encouraged a thorough inspection of prospective foster parents and limited admissions "from the street"; these measures decreased the inflow of new orphans and considerably reduced mortality. By 1826, the mortality rate was reduced to 15% per annum.&lt;ref name="V3"/&gt; The figure may appear outrageous by modern standards yet it was a great improvement on the 18th century.

The institution, headed by retired general [[Ivan Tutolmin]], was not damaged during [[Napoleon I]]'s occupation of Moscow, despite its proximity to the centre of the [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|Fire of Moscow]], which completely destroyed the adjacent districts, including [[Kitai-gorod]] and [[Tagansky District|Taganka]]. While the French held the city, the Orphanage provided shelter for 350 children and an unspecified number of wounded soldiers. After the end of the Napoleonic wars, the Board of Trustees capitalized on the recent disaster by building cheap rental housing on its properties. As a result of this policy, the new facilities housed up to 8,000 residents of all ranks in the 1820s.&lt;ref name="V4"&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.bmstu.ru/~vil/kniga/o4.htm Volkevich, ch.4]&lt;/ref&gt;

Empress Maria realized the need to downsize the institution, separating children from adult tenants and improving the educational program for the former. She detested the "dirty" appearance of trade workshops and transferred them to new, independent orphanages. The Moscow Crafts College, the largest spin-off, was established as an orphanage for teenagers in 1830, and continues today as the [[Bauman Moscow State Technical University]].&lt;ref name="V4"/&gt; In the old Orphanage, a premium was placed upon high-level educational programs along the lines of the "Latin classes" for boys (established 1807) and the "[[midwife]] classes" for girls.

By the 1830s, the Orphanage finally achieved the espoused aim of taking the ablest children from the streets and preparing them for state service and professional careers. Among the teachers and tenants were [[Gerhardt Friedrich Müller]], [[Alexander Vostokov]], [[Sergey Solovyov]], [[Vasily Klyuchevsky]], [[Nicholas Benois]], [[Isaak Levitan]], and [[Vasily Vereshchagin]]. Until the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], the Moscow Orphanage ranked among the most prominent national charities.

==20th century==

The [[Bolsheviks]] disbanded the Orphanage immediately after the Revolution. The main building was conveyed to the [[Soviet trade unions]], followed by [[Dzerzhinsky Military Academy]] and a long succession of state institutions. The satirical novel ''[[The Twelve Chairs]]'' features a famous episode: an abandoned wife chasing [[Ostap Bender]], her runaway husband, through numerous editorial offices of the former Orphanage.

During [[Joseph Stalin]]'s reconstruction of old Moscow (1937), several Orphanage buildings facing [[Bolshoy Ustinsky Bridge]] were torn down to make way for the new bridge. The right wing of the Orphanage was topped out by [[Operation Barbarossa|June 1941]], but the project was not completed until after [[World War II]]. Viewed from the outside, this later addition is only marginally different from the left wing, to which the top floor was added at about the same time. The main building conforms quite closely to Blank's original designs.

== 21st century – Parliament Center ==
Moscow chief architect A. Kuzminov proposed to house Russian Parliament Center in the premises of the Orphanage.  The Russian Parliament Center will be used by both [[Russian Senate]] and [[Russian State Duma]] as their main residence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rg.ru/2009/08/24/kuzmin.html Rossiiskaya Gazeta]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Year's Nation''' is the only event of its kind in the United States, connecting thousands of people in multiple cities on the biggest night of the year. The New York-based company, founded by Jann Yogman, throws a simultaneous New Year's Eve party across four time zones. Guests from coast-to-coast can celebrate with friends in other cities and toast the new year every time the clock strikes midnight.

On December 31, 2006, New Year's Nation hosted 5,000 guests at a national New Year's Eve bash in five U.S. cities of New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas and Boston, all connected by streaming video on giant plasma screens.&lt;ref name="cnn.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/12/28/smbusiness/new_years_nation.fsb/index.htm|title=Startup Bets Everything On New Year's Eve - Dec. 28, 2007|work=cnn.com|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/entertainment/29243114.html|title=Stuff: To do, to buy, to talk about|work=jsonline.com|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, New Year's Nation expanded the New Year's Eve party to the eight U.S. cities of [[Boston]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Dallas]], [[Detroit]], [[Denver]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Philadelphia]] and [[Seattle]].&lt;ref name="cnn.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2007/dec/28/new-years-eve-2008/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2004094890_nite28.html|title=Everyone else’s excuse to bar hop|work=The Seattle Times|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_7764676?source=rss|title=3Deep Productions gets in yule spirit with holiday parties|work=denverpost.com|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=12218|title=New Year's Eve Kicks List|work=Detroit Metro Times|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/2007/12/29/2007-12-29_new_years_eve_events_in_nyc.html?print=1&amp;page=all&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, New Year's Nation held their partys in 10 U.S. cities: Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Las Vegas, Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia, Portland and Seattle. [[Travis Barker]] and DJ-AM ([[Adam Goldstein]]) performed at New Year's Nation's Los Angeles party at The Wiltern, and their performance were streamed live in [[High-definition video|high-definition]] quality on the Internet at newyearsnation.com, and broadcast live through NYN-TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2008/12/01/Barker_DJ_AM_book_New_Years_gig/UPI-60061228185645/|title=Barker, D.J.

'''''Pareh''''' ([[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] for "rice"), released internationally as '''''Pareh, Song of the Rice''''', is a 1936 film from the [[Dutch East Indies]] (modern day Indonesia). Directed by the Dutchmen [[Albert Balink]] and [[Mannus Franken]], it featured an amateur [[Native Indonesians|native]] cast and starred [[Raden Mochtar]] and Soekarsih. The story follows the forbidden love between a fisherman and a farmer's daughter.

Balink began work on the film in 1934, working with the [[Wong brothers]], who served as [[cinematographers]]. They gathered a budget of 75,000 [[Netherlands Indies gulden|gulden]]&amp;nbsp;– several times the budget of other local productions&amp;nbsp;– and brought Franken from the Netherlands to assist in production. The film was edited in the Netherlands after being shot in the Indies. The film was a commercial and critical success with European audiences, but disliked by native ones; despite this success, ''Pareh'' bankrupted its producers.

''Pareh'' resulted in a change in the cinema of Dutch East Indies, which had been Chinese-oriented for several years; films began to make more effort at targeting local audiences.  Balink later found commercial success with ''[[Terang Boelan]]'' (1937). The American visual anthropologist [[Karl G. Heider]] considers ''Pareh'' and ''Terang Boelan'' the two most important cinematic works from the Dutch East Indies during the 1930s.{{sfn|Heider|1991|p=15}}

==Premise==
Mahmud ([[Rd. Mochtar]]), a fisherman, is in love with Wagini (Soekarsih), a farmer's daughter. However, local superstition dictates that their relationship will bring disaster. This seems to prove true after the village leader's [[keris]] is stolen, but eventually Mahmud and Wagini are able to unite with the help of his fellow villagers.

==Production==
During 1934 and early 1935, all feature films released in the [[Dutch East Indies]] had been produced by [[The Teng Chun]], based on [[Chinese mythology]] or martial arts, and targeted at low-class audiences, generally [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=380–381}} This situation was created by the [[Great Depression]], which had led to the Dutch East Indies government collecting higher taxes, advertisers asking for more money, and cinemas selling tickets at lower prices; this ensured that there was a very low [[profit margin]] for local films. During this period cinemas in the country mainly showed [[Hollywood]] productions.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=145}}

[[File:A Wong Brother KR 30 April 1947.jpg|thumb|upright|One of the [[Wong brothers]], {{circa}} 1947]]
[[Albert Balink]], a Dutch journalist, began work on what was to become ''Pareh'' in 1934. Unlike The Teng Chun, the inexperienced Balink chose to target his film at Dutch audiences.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=146}} He brought in two of the [[Wong brothers]], Chinese filmmakers who had been inactive since making ''[[Zuster Theresia]]'' (''Sister Theresa'') in 1932.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=155}} The Wongs donated their studio&amp;nbsp;– an old [[tapioca flour]] factory&amp;nbsp;– as well as filmmaking equipment. Meanwhile, much of the funding came from other backers. According to the Indonesian film historian [[Misbach Yusa Biran]], the money came from the cinema mogul Buse,{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=156}} while [[EYE Film Institute Netherlands|EYE Film Institute]] records indicate that the film was backed by the Centrale Commissie voor Emigratie en Kolonisatie van Inheemschen and meant to promote migration from [[Java]] to [[Sumatra]].{{sfn|EYE Film Institute 2011, Pareh}}

Balink and the Wongs spent most of two years compiling the necessary funds, with Balink in charge of general operations as the head of [[Java Pacific Film]], a joint operation.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=157}} Balink insisted on perfection and had a clear idea what kind of actor he wanted in the film.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=157}} Unlike earlier filmmakers in the country, Balink invested time and money in searching for the best locations and actors possible, without considering whether a person was already a celebrity.{{sfn|Biran|Ramadhan K.H.|Labrousse|1973|p=167}} Ultimately, most of those cast for ''Pareh'' had not acted before,{{sfn|EYE Film Institute 2011, Pareh}} including stars Mochtar and Soekarsih.{{sfn|Ali|1955|p=25}} 

The role of Mahmud was filled when Balink was out with coffee with Joshua and Othniel Wong and saw a young man, tall, strong, and handsome&amp;nbsp;– as he expected for the role&amp;nbsp;– driving by. Balink called the Wongs and they got into their car, then chased and caught the young man. The man, Mochtar, a [[Javanese people|Javanese]] of [[priyayi|noble descent]], was told to use the title ''Raden'' for the film, which he and his family had already abandoned.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=157}} According to the Indonesian anthropologist Albertus Budi Susanto, the emphasis on Mochtar's title was meant as a way to draw a higher-class audience.{{sfn|Susanto|2003|p=241}}

Artistic direction and some of the screenwriting was handled by [[Mannus Franken]], an ''[[avant-garde]]'' documentary filmmaker from the Netherlands, whom Balink had brought to the Indies. Franken insisted on including [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] shots to better present the local culture to international audiences.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=159}} Franken took an interest in the documentary and ethnographic aspects of the film, directing the shots for these portions, while the Wongs handled the general shots. According to Biran, this was reflected in the [[camera angle]]s used.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=160}} 

''Pareh'', which had been recorded on [[35 mm film]] using [[Single-system recording|single-system devices]], was brought to the Netherlands for editing. There the original voices of the cast were dubbed by actors in the Netherlands, resulting in stilted language use and heavy Dutch accents.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=160}}{{sfn|EYE Film Institute 2011, Pareh}} Though initially the filmmakers had planned on using ''[[gamelan]]'' music, the poor quality of the recording equipment in the Indies led to the soundtrack being redone, using European-style music, in the Netherlands. {{sfn|Pane|1955|p=22}} 

From start to finish the production of ''Pareh'' cost 75,000 [[Netherlands Indies gulden|gulden]] (approximately [[US$]] 51,000{{sfn|New York Times 1936, Foreign Exchange}}), 20&amp;nbsp;times as much as a regular local production.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=162}} After editing there were 2,061 metres of film, equivalent to 92 minutes of runtime.{{sfn|EYE Film Institute 2011, Pareh}}{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Pareh}}

==Release and reception==
''Pareh'' was screened in the Netherlands as ''Pareh, een Rijstlied van Java'' (also noted as ''Het Lied van de Rijst'') beginning on 20&amp;nbsp;November 1936. The film was also shown in the Indies.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Pareh}} It was unable to recoup its costs and bankrupted the producers.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=161–162}} The film was critically acclaimed in the Netherlands, partially owing to the emphasis of Franken's involvement.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=160}} Although it was a commercial success amongst the [[intelligentsia]] in the Indies, ''Pareh'' was a failure with lower-class [[Native Indonesians|native audiences]]. Mochtar never viewed the film in full.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=161–162}} 

Historical reception of ''Pareh'' has generally been positive. Writing in 1955, the Indonesian author and cultural critic [[Armijn Pane]] opined that ''Pareh'' was technically unparalleled in contemporary Indies cinema, with careful [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] and dynamic [[Cut (transition)|cuts]]. He was critical, however, of the film's tendency to see the Indies' native population through European eyes and depict them as "primitive".{{sfn|Pane|1955|pp=22&amp;ndash;23}} The American film historian John Lent, writing in 1990, described ''Pareh'' as a "meticulously detailed and costly" film which attempted to not only earn money, but show the local culture.{{sfn|Gray|2010|p=83}} The American visual anthropologist [[Karl G. Heider]] considers ''Pareh'' one of the two most important cinematic works from the Dutch East Indies during the 1930s; Balink's later work ''[[Terang Boelan]]'' (''Full Moon''; 1937) was the other.{{sfn|Heider|1991|p=15}} Heider, [[John H. McGlynn]], and Salim Said note that the film was of acceptable technical quality but is best remembered for changing the path of cinematic developments in the country.{{sfn|Said|McGlynn|Heider|1991|p=2}}

==Legacy==
The release of ''Pareh'' was followed by a shift in genres popularised by the local cinema. The Teng Chun, who&amp;nbsp;– together with Balink&amp;nbsp;– continued to be the only active filmmaker in the country until 1937, began focusing on more modern stories and those which would be popular with native audiences. Biran suggests that this was influenced by ''Pareh''.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=163}} Other filmmakers in the late 1930s, partially inspired by ''Pareh'', began to improve the quality of the audio in their films.{{sfn|Prayogo|2009|p=15}} Pane notes that, following ''Pareh'', films produced domestically no longer centred around ethnic European casts.{{sfn|Pane|1955|p=22}}

Mochtar and Soekarsih, who first met on the set of ''Pareh'', married after appearing together in ''Terang Boelan''.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Pareh}} This later production included much of the same cast and was highly successful, leading to a renewed interest in filmmaking in the Indies.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=171}} ''Terang Boelan'' proved to be the most successful local production until 1953's ''Krisis'' (''Crisis''), released after Indonesia had become independent.{{sfn|Anwar|2004|p=84}}

'''Perception''' was a media entertainment company working in the [[video game]]s, film and television space. The company claimed to be working on a video game for the PC and console platforms and to be in pre production on an animated television series &amp; Sony PSP game. The company has staff based in Sydney, Melbourne and Vienna.

The company announced via its website in December 2007 that it was working on a licensed game as well as an animated TV series called ''The Four Horsemen''. However, by May 2008, this information had been removed.

== History ==
Perception began in 1995 as a small animation and sound studio, but by 1998 had expanded into the video game market. Between 1998 and 2004, two products were developed primarily for the coin-op arcade market; Thunderboats and Top Down Racer, but neither were financial successes. Thunderboats was planned to be ported to the Sega Dreamcast game console, but the project was cancelled.

In 2004, the company successfully negotiated with MGM entertainment to develop a new video game based on the Stargate television series. Unfortunately, MGM cancelled the deal some time in late 2005 or early 2006 and all staff were made redundant (with the exception of the CEO and his assistant).

Digital and Voice Media approached Perception in 2006 to negotiate a take-over, but the deal fell through a few months later.

In November 2007, Perception announced that they were suing their former publisher for damages.

'''''Pollen''''' is a [[first-person (video games)|first-person]] [[Science fiction|sci-fi]] [[mystery fiction|mystery]] [[exploration]] [[video game]] developed by Finnish company Mindfield Games for [[Microsoft Windows]]. ''Pollen'' is playable on regular monitors and [[Oculus Rift]] [[virtual reality]] headsets (beta), and will be playable on [[HTC Vive]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pollengame.com/?page_id=2814 "P.O.L.L.E.N FAQ"], ''pollengame.com'', 3 Jul 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The game takes place in an alternate timeline of humanity's history, on a research base called Station M found on Saturn's largest moon Titan. The gameplay centers around semi-linear first person exploration, allowing the player to discover the story through puzzles and interacting with the objects around them.

== Gameplay ==
In ''Pollen'', the player assumes the role of a RAMA Industries employee, who is sent to Titan to replace a missing crew member on Station M. Just before entering the base the player loses all contact with the research team, and must enter the station in search of answers. The player will have to examine everything in their environment, listen to audio tapes, as well as solve puzzles to advance through the story. Station M contains several areas for the player to explore, including the landing pad, crew quarters, cargo bay, laboratory, comm station, and generator room.

== Setting ==
The game is set in an alternate reality where manned exploration of the solar system is happening at a rapid pace, however computers are between 10 and 20 years behind what they are at the same time in our world. The point of divergence is in 1963, when John F. Kennedy survives an assassination attempt, the U.S. and U.S.S.R. eventually allying. RAMA Industries is founded by the governments of several nations, becoming the main space company in existence.

== Development ==
''Pollen''{{'}}s development began in late 2013 with the Unity 4 engine, and was later ported to the Unity 5 engine.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Pope, [http://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/02/16/pollen-vr-developing-high-end-visuals-with-unity-5/ "P.O.L.L.E.N VR: Developing High-End Visuals with Unity 5"], ''Unity 3D'', 16 Feb 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The development team consisted initially of 5 team members. The game was announced in Aug 2014 accompanied by an teaser trailer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ign.com/videos/2014/08/07/pollen-teaser-trailer/ "PO.L.L.E.N Teaser Trailer"], ''IGN'', 7 Aug 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In Oct 2015, the first gameplay trailer was released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ign.com/videos/2015/10/05/pollen-gameplay-trailers-first-person-creepiness/ "PO.L.L.E.N Gameplay Trailer"], ''IGN'', 5 Oct 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 5, 2015, ''Pollen'' was posted on [[Steam (software)|Steam]], and after getting 86% yes votes within 36 hours, it was Greenlit by the community two days later on 7 Oct, 2015.,{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} after receiving a significant amount of press coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Smith, [http://www.newgamernation.com/pollen-interview-at-pax-east-2015_030915-1030/ "Pollen Interview with Olli Sinerma of MindField Games | PAX East 2015"], ''Newgamernation'', 9 Mar 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blake Peterson, [http://www.gamerevolution.com/preview/pollen "Pollen Preview"], ''Game Revolution'', 31 Aug 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Prelude to Foundation''''' is a  novel  by American writer [[Isaac Asimov]], published in 1988. It is one of two prequels to the [[Foundation series|''Foundation'' series]]. For the first time, Asimov chronicles the fictional life of [[Hari Seldon]], the man who invented [[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]] and the intellectual hero of the series. The novel was nominated for the [[Locus Award]].&lt;ref name="WWE-1989"&gt;{{cite web

==Plot summary==
Prelude to Foundation is set in the year 12,020 G.E. (Galactic era), during the rocky reign of the Emperor Cleon I. It starts with Seldon's presentation of a paper at a mathematics convention detailing how practical use of psychohistory might theoretically make it possible to predict the future. The Emperor of the [[Galactic Empire (Asimov)|Galactic Empire]] learns of this and wants to use Seldon for political gain. In a face-to-face interview, Seldon emphasizes that psychohistory is something that he has not even begun developing or even has a clear idea how to do so, but Cleon is not wholly convinced that Hari is of no use to the Empire.

Seldon then meets reporter [[Chetter Hummin]], who convinces him that Cleon's first minister, [[Eto Demerzel]], is attempting to capture him, and that it is therefore imperative for Seldon to escape and try to make psychohistory practical. He is taken by Hummin to Streeling University, one of the top ranked of the Empire and introduced to [[Dors Venabili]] by Hummin. Seldon theorizes that the first development of psychohistory requires a smaller, yet still significant sample than the entire Empire, possibly just the original world where humans originated...which is now lost, along with much of the older historical records.

Hari and Dors narrowly evade capture at Streeling University, and Hummin arranges for them to be sheltered in the reclusive [[Mycogen]] sector, which supposedly values its ancient history. Seldon and Venabili are welcomed by Sunmaster Fourteen, the leader of Mycogen. Seldon obtains the Mycogenians' treasured religious/historical book, but finds it disappointing except for the revelation of what the Mycogenians call their home planet, [[Aurora (planet)|Aurora]], and references to "robots" (which do not exist in the Empire). Seldon and Venabili face execution when Seldon insists on entering the Mycogenian "temple", the Sacratorium, in disguise in hopes of interviewing a robot supposedly housed there. They are easily detected, but Hummin arrives in the nick of time to save them. 

The action then shifts to the Dahl sector, where Seldon and Venabili rent rooms from a middle-class family. While in Dahl, they meet a guttersnipe named Raych, whom Seldon later adopts. Also in Dahl, they are told by an old wise woman that the Aurora of the Mycogenians is not the original world, but actually the "enemy" of the original human planet, called [[Earth (Foundation universe)|Earth]]. (This links with the [[Robot series (Asimov)|Robot series]].)

Towards the end of the novel, Seldon, Venabili, and Raych are kidnapped and taken to Rashelle, the Mayor of Wye, a powerful and vital sector situated at Trantor's south pole. Rashelle and her father have long been plotting to overthrow the Emperor and take his place. Seldon has the revelation that he could try to develop psychohistory using Trantor itself as a test case because of the great cultural diversity of its sectors. Rashelle launches her coup attempt, but it quickly collapses due to Demerzel's skillful subversion of Wye's forces. The finale reveals that "Hummin" is actually Eto Demerzel. Seldon then gets Demerzel to admit he is a robot; Demerzel is in fact [[R. Daneel Olivaw]], who can influence humans mentally. He wants the development of psychohistory to help him better protect humanity, as per "The Zeroth Law Of Robotics." Seldon also suspects that Venabili is a robot, too. This theme would later be picked up in ''[[Forward the Foundation]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2375">The '''Roemer model of political competition''' is a game between political parties in which each party announces a multidimensional policy vector.  Since [[Nash equilibrium|Nash equilibria]] do not normally exist when the policy space is multidimensional, [[John Roemer]] introduced the concept of party-unanimity Nash equilibrium (PUNE), which can be considered a generalization of the concept of Nash equilibrium in models of political competition.  It is also a generalization of the [[Wittman model]] of political competition.

In Roemer's model, all political parties are assumed to consist of three types of factions—[[opportunism|opportunists]], [[Militant (word)|militants]], and [[reform movement|reformers]].  Opportunists seek solely to maximize the party's vote share in an election; militants seek to announce (and implement) the preferred policy of the average party member; and reformers have an objective function that is a [[convex combination]] of the objective functions of the opportunists and militants.  It has been shown that the existence of reformers has no effect on what policies the party announces.

With two parties, a pair of policy announcements constitute a PUNE if and only if the reformers and militants of any given party do not unanimously agree to deviate from their announced policy, given the policy put forth by the other party.  In other words, if a pair of policies constitute a PUNE, then it should not be the case that ''both'' factions of a party can be made weakly better off (and one faction strictly better off) by deviating from the policy that they put forward. Such unanimity to deviate can be rare, and thus PUNEs are more likely to exist than regular Nash equilibria.

Although there are no known cases where PUNEs do not exist, no simple necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of non-trivial PUNEs have yet been offered.  (A nontrivial PUNE is one in which no party offers the ideal policy of either its militants or opportunists.) The question of the existence of non-trivial PUNEs remains an important open question in the theory of political competition.

A '''spoiler''' is an element of a disseminated summary or description of any piece of [[fiction]] that reveals any [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] elements which threaten to give away important details. Typically, the details of the conclusion of the plot, including the climax and ending, are especially regarded as spoiler material. It can also be used to refer to any piece of information regarding any part of a given media that a potential consumer would not want to know beforehand. Because enjoyment of fiction depends a great deal upon the suspense of revealing plot details through standard narrative progression, the prior revelation of how things will turn out can "spoil" the enjoyment that some consumers of the narrative would otherwise have experienced. Spoilers can be found in message boards, articles, reviews, commercials, and movie trailers.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==On the Internet==
The term spoiler was introduced in the early days of the Internet, and came to prominence in [[newsgroup]] conversations. It is still common in [[internet]] articles and [[social media]] discussions. Early rules of [[netiquette]] insisted that spoilers could and should be normally avoided, but if the posting of "spoiling" information was unavoidable, it be preceded by a warning such as "SPOILER ALERT", or the spoiler itself has to be masked so that it can not be visible to any but those keen for details and not fazed at the thought of such potentially plot-revealing information.

Sometimes, these warnings are omitted, accidentally or deliberately (see below), and some unwitting readers have had [[literature]], [[film]]s, [[television]] programmes and other works that they were looking forward to experiencing "spoiled".&lt;ref name=howsoon&gt;{{cite news|author=Tom Jicha |url=http://blogs.sun-sentinel.com/tv/2009/01/how-soon-is-too-soon-for-spoilers.html |title=How soon is too soon for spoilers? |date=2009-01-23 |work=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]] |accessdate=2016-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203105208/http://blogs.sun-sentinel.com/tv/2009/01/how-soon-is-too-soon-for-spoilers.html |archivedate=2016-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a common demand, especially among internet users, to have protection against accidentally seeing material considered to include "spoiler" information, even in the internet version of settings where such material has conventionally and historically appeared, such as discussion groups or literary reviews. As a result of this level of objection to spoilers, [[Troll (Internet)|trolls]] may post them purely for their own pleasure, finding amusement in believing they are completely ruining a narrative experience for others. On reputable websites, these can be reported to [[forum moderator|moderators]] and such posts taken down, the posters blacklisted, but only after the fact. Most such websites provide a means of tagging certain threads as containing spoilers for those who wish to discuss a fictional work in depth, including the outcomes of events and the handling of the narrative resolution. Some{{who|date=January 2016}} have felt compelled to avoid participating on public websites altogether, set up "closed" websites to exclude those who are sensitive about spoilers, or decided they had to unilaterally blog at the expense of public exchange.

On [[Usenet]], the common method for obscuring spoiler information is to precede it with many blank lines known as 'spoiler space' – traditionally enough to push the information in question on to the next screen of a 25-line [[Dumb terminal|terminal]]. A simple cipher called [[ROT13]] is also used in newsgroups to obscure spoilers, but is rarely used for this purpose elsewhere.

Some producers actively seed bogus information in order to misdirect fans. The director of the film ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'' orchestrated a "disinformation campaign" where false spoilers were distributed about the film, to mask any true rumors about its plot.&lt;ref name=foilers&gt;{{cite news | author = Hugh Hart | url = https://www.wired.com/2009/01/new-lost-season | title = Spoiler Wars Heat Up as Lost Returns | date = 2009-01-21 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | accessdate = 2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wikipedia]] discloses spoilers in its articles without giving advance warning, although it previously did prior to 2006. Matthew Prichard, the grandson of [[Agatha Christie]], criticized Wikipedia for giving away spoilers in the play "The Mousetrap". Andrew Jarecki, the producer of ''[[Catfish (film)|Catfish]]'', a documentary, argued that Wikipedia should have spoiler alerts. The plot of ''Catfish'' had been posted on Wikipedia before its theatrical release because the film had been shown at the [[2010 Sundance Film Festival]]. Jay Walsh, a [[Wikimedia Foundation]] spokesperson, said that Wikipedia is intended to be an exhaustive knowledge source, so it would have spoilers.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Noam. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/18/business/media/18spoiler.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1284931453-Cougj2fpRsBoD+tJX2gG5g Spoiler Alert: Whodunit? Wikipedia Will Tell You]." ''[[The New York Times]]''. September 17, 2010. Retrieved on August 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some internet forums and reference sites, such as [[TV Tropes]] and the [[IMDb]] FAQ section, have optional spoiler tags covering major plot details. The information underneath may be revealed by highlighting the text or, in the case of IMDb, rolling over the spoiler tag.

In 2011, Nicholas Christenfeld and Jonathan Leavitt of UC San Diego did a psychological experiment testing whether spoilers diminish enjoyment of fiction. They gave subjects short stories with twist endings to read, giving some of the subjects information about the twist in advance. For nearly every story, subjects who had the story "spoiled" enjoyed the story more than the subjects who didn't know the ending in advance.&lt;ref&gt;Lehrer, Jonah. "[https://www.wired.com/2011/08/spoilers-dont-spoil-anything/ Spoilers Don't Spoil Anything]." ''[[Wired (magazine)]]''. August 10, 2011. Retrieved on October 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some applications that prevent users from reading spoilers, such as [[TVShow Time]]'s [[Google Chrome extension]], which, once set up, blocks posts on [[social media]] about episodes that the user has not seen.

==In print or other media==
One of the first print uses of the terms was in the April 1971 issue of ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marksverylarge.com/issues/7104.html |title=National Lampoon Issue #14 |accessdate=2016-01-28 |author=Table of Contents |date=April 1971 |publisher=[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207072228/http://www.marksverylarge.com/issues/7104.html |archivedate=2016-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An article entitled "Spoilers," by [[Doug Kenney]], lists spoilers for famous films and movies.

[[File:Roger Ebert cropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[Roger Ebert]] in 2007]]
In 2005, the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote an article entitled "Critics have no right to play spoiler" which contained spoilers and spoilers warnings.&lt;ref name="CST01"/&gt; Ebert wrote:

:The characters in movies do not always do what we would do. Sometimes they make choices that offend us. That is their right. It is our right to disagree with them. It is not our right, however, to destroy for others the experience of being as surprised by those choices as we were. A few years ago, I began to notice "spoiler warnings" on Web-based movie reviews -- a shorthand way of informing the reader that a key plot point was about to be revealed. Having heard from more than a few readers accusing me of telling too much of the story, I began using such warnings in my reviews.

Ebert used two spoiler warnings in the article, saying "If you have not yet seen ''[[Million Dollar Baby]]'' and know nothing about the plot, read no further" and later said, "Now yet another spoiler warning, because I am going to become more explicit." Ebert discussed six films in the article and mentioned how many critics handled ''[[The Crying Game]]'' and also noted a detail about the film ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously (film)|The Year of Living Dangerously]]''. Ebert also mentioned two films alongside ''[[Million Dollar Baby]]''.&lt;ref name="CST01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050129/COMMENTARY/501290301 |title=Critics have no right to play spoiler |accessdate=2016-01-28 |author=Roger Ebert |date=2005-01-29 |publisher= [[Chicago Sun-Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ebert additionally criticized two commentators, [[Rush Limbaugh]] and [[Michael Medved]] (the latter of whom had "for a long time been a political commentator, not a movie critic"), for deliberately revealing the ending of the movie due to a moral disagreement with the lead character's life decision. "[S]hould no movie be allowed to consider [the moral issue]?" Ebert asked. "The [[separation of church and state]] in [[United States of America|America]] was wisely designed to prevent [[religions]] from dictating the personal choices of those who do not share the same beliefs."&lt;ref name="CST01" /&gt;

In an interview about his ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|Dark Tower]]'' series (appearing in issue #4 of the 2007 [[Marvel Comic]] adaptation ''[[The Gunslinger Born]]''), [[Stephen King]] was asked if there are spoilers in the first few novels that would ruin someone's experience of the comic. "There are no spoilers!", King replied, "You might as well say 'I'm never gonna watch ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|Wizard of Oz]]'' again because I know how it comes out'".

The executive producer of ''Doctor Who'', [[Steven Moffat]], expressed disappointment with fans who revealed spoilers after a leaked copy of "The Impossible Astronaut" was made available online before the episode's first television broadcast.

In April 2015, the [[Under the Gun Theater]] created ''Swarm of Spoilers'', a parody show based on [[George R.R. Martin]]'s ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' series. The comedic play recapped the previous four seasons of the [[HBO]] television show. Kevin Mullaney, who directed ''Swarm of Spoilers'', stated: "I'm somebody who's very sensitive about spoilers, so I wanted to make sure it was very clear from the title," though he went on to say, "There's actually this theory about spoilers that we think that they hurt the enjoyment of shows, and I definitely feel that way sometimes, but I think there's been studies that show the other side: that when we know the ending of a story that we haven't read before, it actually enhances the story, so I don't know if it would actually hurt anyone to come see it [''Swarm of Spoilers'']." &lt;!-- Is this referring to Christenfeld &amp; Leavitt, 2011? --&gt; The final production included 45 of the series' characters, and was played by an 18-person [[Ensemble cast|ensemble]].&lt;ref name="Redeye Purdom"&gt;Purdom, Gwendolyn [http://www.redeyechicago.com/entertainment/theater/redeye-swarm-of-spoilers-game-of-thrones-chicago-20150331-story.html Under the Gun Theater produces on 'Game of Thrones' parody show].

[[File:CF46618267 109996904033.gif|frame|right|250px|&lt;center&gt;A dancer spotting towards the viewer while performing [[fouetté]]s]]
'''Spotting''' is a technique used by dancers during the execution of various [[Turn (dance)|dance turns]]. The goal of spotting is to attain a constant orientation of the dancer's head and eyes, to the extent possible, in order to enhance the dancer's control and prevent dizziness.

As a dancer turns, spotting is performed by rotating the body and head at different rates. While the body rotates smoothly at a relatively constant speed, the head periodically rotates much faster and then stops, so as to fix the dancer's gaze on a single location (the ''spotting point'', or simply the ''spot'').  Dancers will sometimes focus on an actual visual spot if one is available (e.g., a light or other object), but if no suitable object is available they will attempt to end each head rotation in a consistent orientation. The spotting point may be another dancer, in which case the spot may move.&lt;ref name=laban/&gt;

==Usage==

Spotting is advantageous for dancers in several ways:
*It prevents [[dizziness]] by providing a fixed focus for the eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Laws, Martha Swope (2002) "Physics and the Art of Dance: Understanding Movement", {{ISBN|0-19-514482-1}}, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;
*The fixed focus also helps the dancer control [[Balance (ability)|balance]].
*It helps the dancer control the direction of travel during traveling turns such as [[Glossary of ballet#Chaînés|chaînés]] and [[Glossary of ballet#Piqué|piqués]].

Spotting technique is employed for many types of turns, including [[pirouette]]s and chaînés. It is deliberately avoided in some types of turns, however. For example, [[adagio (ballet technique)|adagio]] turns — in which the aesthetics are intended to convey serenity and calm — would be disturbed by the abrupt head movements of spotting. Turns in adagio style include turns in [[arabesque (ballet position)|arabesque]] or [[attitude (ballet position)|attitude]] positions.&lt;ref name=b101&gt;Robert Greskovic (2006) "Ballet 101: A Complete Guide to Learning and Loving the Ballet", {{ISBN|0-87910-325-6}}, pp. 521, 527&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases multiple spots may be used during a turn. For example, during a [[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]] ''[[cross-body lead]] with inside turn'', the lady spots away from her partner to control travel and then spots on her partner to control the stop of rotation.

===In video games===
An adaptation of spotting is used in [[first person (video games)|first person video games]] to avoid [[simulation sickness]] caused by scenery changes that are uncorrelated with body movement. For example, a visible crosshair or targeting reticle is provided in [[Mirror's Edge]] as a spotting reference point.&lt;ref name="sickness"&gt;{{cite web |last=Totilo |first=Stephen |publisher= MTV | title= EA Discusses ''Mirror's Edge'' Sickness Concerns, Lack Of Color Green |url= http://www.mtv.com/news/2456471/ea-discusses-mirrors-edge-sickness-concerns-lack-of-color-green/ | date= March 7, 2008 | accessdate=May 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dance notation==
In [[Labanotation]], spotting is recorded as a face sign followed by the "spot hold" sign, which is a [[diamond shape]] ('''◊''') with a dot in the center.&lt;ref name=laban&gt;Ann Hutchinson Guest (2004) "Labanotation: The System of Analyzing and Recording Movement", {{ISBN|0-415-96561-6}}, p.399&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Gardens Between''''' is a [[puzzle game|puzzle video game]] developed by Australian studio The Voxel Agents, released in September 2018 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], [[Linux]], [[Nintendo Switch]], and [[PlayStation 4]].

==Gameplay==
The game centers around teenagers Arina and Frendt, a girl and boy that live next door to each other that have become close friends since Arina's family moved into the area. One rainy night, the two sneak out and hide out in their treehouse, built on a small garden square next to both houses.  In the midst of a rainstorm, they see a light sphere form in front of them, which suddenly causes the treehouse to fall into a vast dream ocean with small islands made up of their shared experiences. They sail between the islands in the treehouse to light each portal at the top, and finally to a central island and a large portal, together; as they progress, the weather of this dreamspace becomes overcast and then rainy.&lt;ref name="rps review"/&gt; Once lit, the islands all collapse into the ocean, leaving them in their treehouse. When the next morning comes Arina and Frendt are hugging each other, as Frendt's family is now moving out. The two say their final goodbyes as Frendt's family drives off.

The game consists of about twenty abstract levels, grouped into sets of two or three levels each, each influenced by memories of Arina and Frendt's friendship. Arina gains control of a magic lantern that is able to carry a sphere of light, which is needed to activate a portal to the next level, while Frendt has the ability to sound wind chimes that open or close flowers that provide the light for the lantern, as well as interfacing with a device that manipulates the flow of time for some objects. Obstacles in the environment include small cubes that jump about the level, but which can also carry Arina's lantern past obstacles, flowers that emit a black light that steals spheres of light that come close, and purple fog that is solid when the light is not present but becomes intangible when the light is close.

While the path to the portal at the top of each level is straight forward, the game is about manipulating the flow of time. The player does not directly move the characters but instead has their process move forward or backward in time, which will have the pair move forward or backward along the path. However, Arina and Frendt's interactions with the environment remain mutable with time. For example, the player may need to have Arina work forward in time to grab a sphere of light for the lantern, move time backward for her to place it on a jumping cube, and then continue to move forward pass a fog bridge to recollect the cube later. The player cannot move time forward or past a point where either Arina or Frendt cannot progress. Separately, Frendt's ability to interact with devices that control the flow of time for objects in the level may be needed to create paths previously blocked, bring falling light flowers into close proximity to Arina's paths, or similar motions.&lt;ref name="rps review"&gt;{{cite web  |url = https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/09/19/wot-i-think-the-gardens-between/ | title = Wot I Think: The Gardens Between | first = Jay | last= Costello | date = 19 September 2018 | accessdate = 24 September 2018 | work = [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other solutions may require [[lateral thinking]] that recognizing how the various time stream manipulations can work.&lt;ref name="polygon review"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2018/9/19/17874838/the-gardens-between-review-windows-pc-playstation-4-nintendo-switch-mac | title = The Gardens Between is a magical journey that’s well worth your time | first=  Colin | last =Campbell | date = 19 September 2018 | accessdate =24 September 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the player has completed a set of levels, they are presented with a short scene of Arina and Frendt involved in these activities, where a hidden jumping cube can be found using similar time manipulation controls. This completes a [[constellation]], which once the final level is completed, merge into a final memory.

==Development==
''The Gardens Between'' was developed by the Australia studio The Voxel Agents. Lead designer and animator Josh Alan Bradbury stated that the game was meant to be an allegory for how one looks back at childhood friends when they become older. Bradbury descirbed that Arina and Frendt are not necessary the most compatible friends - Arina is shown more adventurous and outgoing, while Frendt is shy and seeks intellectual pursuits - and as an adult may make little sense how they developed a friendship, but through the lens of their shared childhood memories, one is able to see how their friendship developed. The time manipulation mechanics was representative of trying to relive these childhood memories, running through them back and forth in order to recall them correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://mashable.com/2017/09/29/the-gardens-between-interview/ | title = This indie game about childhood friendships is so real it hurts | first = Tina | last = Amini |date = 29 September 2017 | accessdate = 24 September 2018 | work = [[Mashable]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The game's soundtrack is composed by [[Tim Shiel]].

The game was released on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[MacOS]], [[Linux]], [[Nintendo Switch]], and [[PlayStation 4]] consoles on 20 September 2018.&lt;ref name="polygon review"/&gt;

The Verge's Michael Moore considered how ''The Gardens Between'' presented a type of [[theoretical physics]] related to different points-of-view when discussing the potential of time travel, as what Arina and Frendt would witness would be drastically different from what the player witnesses or other potential perspectives in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/30/17902274/the-gardens-between-nintendo-switch-steam-short-play | title = The Gardens Between is an unexpected lesson in theoretical physics | first=  Michael | last = Moore | date = September 30, 2018 | accessdate =October 1, 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Truco''' is a variant of [[Truc]] and a popular [[trick-taking card game]] originally from Valencia and Balearic Islands (Spain) and played specially in the Southern Cone in Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Italy (in Piemonte, in Lomellina, and a particular variant in the towns Porto San Giorgio, Sirolo, Numana, Porto Recanati, Potenza Picena (Marche) and Paulilatino (Sardegna) ), Paraguay, southern Chile and Venezuela. It is played using a [[Spanish playing cards|Spanish deck]], by two, four or six players, divided into two teams.

Except for the variant played in the Brazilian states of [[Minas Gerais]], [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] and some others, '''Truco''' is played with a 40-card [[Spanish playing cards|Spanish deck]] - ''See [[Truco#Truco in Brazil|below]]''.

== Overview ==
Each player is dealt three cards from a subset of the deck consisting of the numbers 1 to 7 and figures ''sota'' in Spanish or ''valete'' in Portuguese (jack, worth 10), ''caballo'' in Spanish or ''dama'' in Portuguese (equivalent to a queen, worth 11) and ''rey'' in Spanish or ''rei'' in Portuguese (king, worth 12).

The most common form of the game is the four-player version, in which there are two teams of two players, who sit opposite each other. For six players, there are two teams of three players, with every second player on the same team.

The game is played until a team finishes a game with 30 points or more. The 30 points are commonly split into two halves, the lower half called ''malas'' in Spanish or ''ruins'' in Portuguese (bad) and the higher half called ''buenas'' in Spanish or ''boas'' in Portuguese (good). Therefore, a team with 8 points would be ''ocho malas'' or ''oito ruins'' (8 bad ones), and a team with 21 points would be ''seis buenas'' or ''seis boas'' (6 good ones). However, because both teams can score points in one round, it is possible (but very rare) for both teams to go over 30 points in one round. Usually as soon as one team goes over 30 points, the game is ended, to stop there being a tie situation. However, sometimes the winner is the one with more points, otherwise another hand is played, until the tie is broken.

The popular appeal of the game comes from the exciting bidding process. Each type of scoring can be bid on to score your team more points. Bids can be accepted, rejected or upped. [[Bluff (poker)|Bluffing]] and deception are also fundamental to the game.

== Card Ranking ==
*Ace of swords/spades ("Espada" in Southeast of Brazil, "Ancho de espadas" or "Macho" (male) in Argentina, "Espadilla" in Uruguay)
*Ace of clubs ("Ancho de basto", "Bastillo" in Uruguay)
*7 of swords ("Siete de espadas", "Siete Bravo" in Uruguay, "Manilha de Espada" in South of Brazil)
*7 of gold (''Siete de oro'' in Spanish or ''Sete Ouro'', ''Sete belo'' or ''Maneca de Ouro'' in Portuguese, "Siete Bello" in Uruguay)
*3s
*2s
*Ace of cup and ace of gold (''Anchos falsos'' in Spanish, ''Ás falso'' in Southeast of Brazil, ''Gueime'' in South of Brazil, "Copon" and "Huevo Frito" respectively in Uruguay )
*Kings (''Reyes'' in Spanish and ''Reis'' in Portuguese) (12s)
*Knights (Caballo, the King, Knight and Jack are called "Cartas Negras") (11s)
*Jacks ("Valetes" in Brazil, "Sota" in Argentina) (10s)
*7 of clubs and 7 of cups (''Sietes falsos'' in Spanish or ''Sete Copa'' in Portuguese, all cards from here down are considered "Cartas Blancas")
*6s
*5s
*4s (''Zap'' in Southeast of Brazil)

In addition, the Uruguayan version of the game uses a "Muestra" each hand. The following cards of the same suit as the "Muestra" are ranked higher than the Ace of swords and are called "Piezas": 2, 4, 5, Knight, which in some regions is called ''Perico,'' worth 30 points,&lt;ref name=McLeod&gt;{{cite web|last=McLeod|first=John|title=Card games in Venezuela|url=http://www.pagat.com/national/venezuela.html|work=National and Regional Games &gt; Venezuela|publisher=Pagat.com|accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Jack, which in some regions is called ''Perica,'' worth 29 points.&lt;ref name=Parlett&gt;{{cite book|last=Parlett|first=David Sidney|title=The Oxford guide to card games|year=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-214165-1|pages=100|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=0786T8f-JpC7hAfelcCRCg&amp;hl=cs&amp;id=gtPfAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Perica+truco&amp;q=lau}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, if any player has the King of the same suit as the "Muestra" and the "Muestra" is a "Pieza", the King becomes that card.

The Venezuelan version&lt;ref name=Sole&gt;{{cite web|last=Sole|first=Francisco|title=El Juego De Truco|url=http://www.reocities.com/TimesSquare/Bunker/1686/|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is quite similar to Uruguayan version with the exception that the "Piezas" 2, 4, and 5 are not used.  The "Muestra" or as it is known in Venezuela, "La Vira" (or trump suit) is designated by turning over the top card of the deck after shuffle or optionally, the top card following the deal.  "La Vira" is then placed beneath the deck offset 90 degrees so that it is visible during the play of the hand.  The suit of "La Vira" designates the suit of ''El Perico'' (the Knight) and ''La Perica'' (the Jack) which become the highest two cards in the game respectively.  The remaining three Knights and Jacks are ranked as initially specified.

== Mano (Mão) &amp; Pie (Pé) ==

In Truco, there are two concepts concerning which player begins the round and who is the last. The ''mano'' in Spanish or ''mão'' in Portuguese ("hand") is the one that plays first and the ''pie'' in Spanish or ''pé'' in Portuguese ("foot"), the dealer, is the last to play. The hand is always the player on the right of the foot. The turn to deal is then passed counterclockwise, so the hand of the first round is the foot of the second and so on. If playing in teams, partners sit opposite each other.

They can also refer, when playing in teams of two, which player of the partnership plays before and which after. This has no significance in the game, as the playing is always done counterclockwise. But it has strategic significance since the foot of a team is traditionally considered the "captain" of the partnership during that round.

If the game is tied (for example, if two opponents have the same points for envido), the hand wins. That advantage is offset by the fact that, being the last one to play, the foot plays with all their opponent's cards in sight. Also, the foot and the one sitting to his left are the ones who call envido in a game of four or more. Then, the hand is the first one to call his points for envido.

== Structure of the game ==

Players can earn points in three different ways. These will be further developed below in special sections for each one.
*'''Truco''': points can be earned by winning in the playing of the cards (the "tricks").
*'''Envido''': points can be earned by having the best combination of two cards of the same suit or a single card.
*'''Flor''': points may be earned by having all three cards of the same suit.

The score won by a player is added to his team's score (when playing in teams). Any bet, win, loss, or surrender by a player also affects his partner/s. For this reason, partnerships are usually formed by mutual arrangement between two players who know each other very well. As in [[contract bridge|bridge]], it is not rare for partners to share information using preestablished signs and gestures. Communication is usually performed by a standard set of gestures (see [[Truco#Señas|señas]]). Arranging a secret set of gestures is thus frowned upon.

== Truco ==

The playing of the cards is done thus: the ''mano'' leads to the first trick (each round has three tricks) by playing one card. Then, counterclockwise, each other player plays one card. The player with the highest card (according to the ranking shown above) wins the trick. The cards remain face-up on the table until the round is finished.

Sometimes it happens that there is no single highest card, but a tie between two or more cards. If these tied cards were played by the same team, that team wins the trick. If that is not the case, the trick is called a draw, ''parda''. The same ''mano'' then leads the next trick.

By winning two of three tricks, one wins a round, equivalent to one point. If a team wins the first two tricks, the third is not played. But if one of the games ended in a ''parda'', the team that won the ''earlier'' of the other two tricks wins (e.g. If trick 1 was won by A, trick 2 was won by B, and trick 3 was a draw, A wins the round for having won the earlier trick. That concept is often referred to as "primera vale doble" (first is worth double) If trick 1 is drawn and trick 2 is won by B, the winner of the round is B and a third trick is not played). In the case of two ''pardas'', the winner of the remaining trick wins the round. In case of three ''pardas'', the ''mano'' wins the round. The winner of each round is the first one to play the next card. If a round is tied, or "parda", the hand plays first.

During play, there are multiple opportunities to raise the stakes of the round. 
*'''Truco''': Any player can call ''truco'' at any stage of the round to increase the value of the round to 2 points for the winner team. To accept the bet, the challenged team says ''quiero''. If not, ''no quiero'', and the round ends there, so the challenger team wins one point and a new round begins.
*'''Retruco''': The team that answered ''quiero'' to the ''truco'' can call ''retruco'' to increase the value of the round to 3 points. It may be said immediately after ''truco'' or after having accepted the bet. The other team must answer with ''quiero'' or ''no quiero''. If the answer is ''no quiero'', the round ends there and the team that called ''retruco'' wins 2 points.
*'''Vale cuatro''': The team that answered the ''retruco'' can say this immediately after the ''retruco'' or after accepting it. This makes the round worth 4 points and is the highest bet made in Truco. If the challenged team refuses the bet, the team that called ''vale cuatro'' wins the round and scores 3 points.

''Truco'' must be accepted explicitly: if ''truco'' is said, the only way to accept it is by saying ''quiero'', but in a less competitive fashion it could be accepted to close the challenge saying ''veo, dale'' or any way of saying yes . To call ''retruco'' immediately, it is necessary first to say ''quiero'' (and the same is true when calling ''vale Cuatro''). Instead of saying explicitly "quiero", a player can play a card and it is implied that he accepted.

A player can play his card face up or face down, in which case it does not count towards the score. A card can be played face down in order to prevent opponents from deducing the value of a remaining card. In some cases (for example, when envido has been played), other players can deduce the value of some cards the remaining ones. If a player does not want his opponents to know his cards, which can be done in order to trick them into raising their bets, he can play his card face down. This should not be confused with "irse al mazo" (going to the deck), which means a whole team admits defeat without finishing the hand.

=== Envido ===

In games of two people, "envido" must be said before the player plays a card. In games of four or six, the foot and the player to the left of the foot are the ones who say "envido" (when they do, there are already cards played).

It is important to know that ''Envido'' bets have precedence before ''Truco'' bets. If one team calls ''Truco'', and then the '''other''' calls ''Envido'', the last must be completed (accepting, increasing or declining it) before the ''Truco''.

When ''Envido'' is said, the challenged team/player can answer in any of these ways:
*'''Quiero''': accepts to take the bet.
*'''Envido''': accepts the 2 points of the first ''Envido'' and proposes to raise the bet by 2 points.
*'''Real Envido''': accepts the 2 points of the first ''Envido'' and proposes to raise the bet by 3 points.
*'''Falta Envido''': if both players score less than 15, the one with the highest score wins the game. If they score more than 15, the winner gets as many points as his opponent is short of reaching 30.
*'''No quiero''': refuses to take the ''last'' bet. Thus, the challenger team/player earns 1 point if there were no raisings, or the number of points that were accepted (e.g. ''Envido-Real Envido-No quiero'' is 2 points worth).

For ''Real Envido'', the answers are the same, excepting ''Envido'' (because it would "lower" the bet). For ''Falta Envido'', the answers are also the same as in ''Envido'', excepting ''Envido'' and ''Real Envido'' (that leaves only ''Quiero'' and ''No quiero'').

''Quiero'' and ''No quiero'' close the bet and after one of that, no other ''Envido'' bet can be opened. In the cases where the bet is ended with ''Quiero'', a comparison of the pairs (''puntos de envido'' = "score of envido") is performed to see which team/player has the highest and wins the bet. The ''puntos de envido'' are calculated according to these rules: 
#The score of a pair of the same suit is the sum of the values of the cards + 20, but considering that the King (12s), the Knights (11s) and ''Sotas'' (10s) are worth 0.
#If the player has no suit pair, then his ''puntos de envido'' is the value of his highest card, with Kings, Knights and ''Sotas'' worth 0.
#If playing ''without Flor'', in case of having three cards of the same suit, the ''puntos de envido'' are those of the highest pair of the hand.
#A player is obliged to report his score correctly, because that can be used later to deduce his cards. For example, if a player has already played a six of spades and he has 27 for envido, he is forced to report his correct score, even if doing that means he reveals his ace of spades to the rest of the players. If the winner reports his score wrong, the points at stake are assigned to the other team.

The ''puntos de envido'' are told from the ''mano'' to the dealer player anticlockwise. In case of a tie between two or more players, the earliest (i.e. the one most on the left among the tied players) has preference. Any player, in case of having a bad ''envido'' can surrender without revealing information of his cards to the other team/player by saying ''Son buenas'' ("They're good"). To say this when playing in teams, is to surrender on behalf of the team. It is usual that when playing in teams, while telling the ''puntos de envido'', the partner of the player that had said the highest ''envido'' can remain silent unless someone of the other team says a higher ''envido''. Then, that player that remained silent will have to say either his score for the ''envidos'' (if his/her is higher) or ''Son buenas'' to recognize the defeat.

After finishing the truco, the winner of envido has to show his cards to the rest of the players by placing them on the table and announcing "[the amount of the envido] en mesa", or, more commonly in Argentina "las [the amount of the envido] jugadas" meaning that the announced cards have been played. Failure to do so may be noted by the opponents and causes the points to be given to them.

The envido is also referred to as "tanto", in order to talk about it without actually proposing it.

=== Flor ===

In [[Argentina]], Truco is usually played without ''Flor'' (flower). The variant is called ''Sin Flor'', or ''Sin Jardinera'' (without the gardenmaid).

To have a ''Flor'' is to have three cards of the same suit in the hand. When playing with ''flor'', any player having one must announce it or a penalty ([[#Pedir Flor|see below]]) is risked. The player having the best ''Flor'' wins 3 points for each ''Flor'' announced. On the other hand, if a player has no ''Flor'', that player cannot announce a ''Flor'' (on the contrary to ''Envido'', where any player having or not the pair of the same suit can announce it).

The call for ''Flor'' can only be made before playing the first card, by simply saying ''Flor''. Then, any other player having ''flor'' must announce his own (the playing of cards is suspended, so players without ''flores'' should wait until the bet is over), going anticlockwise and by saying any of this possible answers:

*'''Flor''': A simple announcement. If nothing more is said, the team having the best ''Flor'' scores 3 points for each ''Flor'' announced this way or by an accepted ''Contraflor'' (see below).
*'''Con flor me achico''': You announce you have ''Flor'', but surrender on behalf of the team. The ''Flor'' bet is closed and the opponent team scores 3 points for their ''Flores'' and 1 for your surrender.
*'''Contraflor''': You announce your ''Flor'' and challenge the opponent team to answer (see below).
*'''Contraflor al resto''': You announce your ''Flor'' and propose to raise the bet to the number of points the leading team needs to win the game plus 3 for each ''Flor''.

After calling ''Contraflor'', the challenged team must answer by one of these:
*'''Con flor quiero''': the challenged team confirms that each ''Flor'' will be three points worth.
*'''Con flor me achico''': The same as above, when answering a simple ''Flor''.
*'''Contraflor al resto''': See above.

After '''Contraflor al resto''', the answers are:
*'''Con flor quiero''': Accepts raising the bet to the number of points the leading team needs to win plus 3 per each ''Flor''.
*'''Con flor me achico''': See above.

After the bet has been closed by saying ''con flor quiero'' or ''con flor me achico'', players announce the ''flores''. The comparison between ''Flores'' is done similarly as in ''Envido'': the values of the three cards are added up plus 20 (Aces to 7 are worth the face value and ''Sotas'', Knights and Kings, 0). When two ''flores'' have the same suit, the one of that player playing earlier (counting anticlockwise, as usual in ''Truco'') has precedence. If an earlier player announces a better ''flor'' than the one you have, it is usual to say ''Son buenas'', admitting defeat but without unnecessarily revealing information about your cards. At the end of the hand, the ''flores'' must be shown.

As with all bets in Truco, each ''Flor'' (or surrender) is made on behalf of the team.

==== Pedir Flor ====

This is a penalty for those players that, having a ''Flor'', didn't announce it. If a player suspects that another one is hiding a ''Flor'', he/she can challenge this player by saying ''Pido flor''. In the case that the player had actually a ''Flor'', the challenger team earns three points. But, if the challenged player shows at least two different cards, his/her team earns one point.

== The Real Trickery ==

In contrast to [[Poker]], where things are kept at a low level and quiet, the game of Truco is actually played by tricking your opponent by playing fast and distracting them through conversation. Truco is generally played with friends, and players are often loud, telling jokes, and talking amongst each other. When playing fast and laughing, it sometimes becomes hard to concentrate on the game, which is what many experienced players take advantage of. This is done in many ways:
*Raising the stakes and bluffing can put pressure on your opponent, and might cause him to fold.
*Asking questions with the words ''envido'' or ''truco'' while having the cards in you hand (when you are holding your cards, you are active and can call a bet). For example, assuming players A and C form a team, and B and D the opposing team, Player A may bid ''envido'' and Player B may ask "innocently" while being active -- "did he say ''envido''?", which effectively raises the stakes. This may entice either A or C to quickly call "quiero", as they may have been fooled into thinking the raise was out of clumsiness and not really intended.
*As a funny aside, a usual prank goes like this: the ''pie'', the dealer, might be talking and laughing while shuffling the deck. Then he might put the cards down beside the ''mano'', the player to the right of the ''pie''. The ''mano'' might think he is the one to cut the deck because the ''pie'' gave him the cards, but in fact, he is not the one to cut the deck. When the ''mano'' then reaches towards the cards, the ''pie'' will hit his hand as a punishment for being tricked into thinking he was the one to cut the deck. This of course has no effect on gameplay.
*When someone has called envido and the opposite time has declined to ask the a player, if he is distracted to call it "canta"{{Clarify|date=September 2012}}. If he falls for it he will tell his score making it easy to recognize his cards further into the game.
*A not so common trick is, when holding a high card and a low one to put the low in front of the high covering it and pretend to scratch your ear or face the other way leaving the card for the opposite player to see but not making it obvious so that he believes you have a low card and would fall for a truco.

However, as tricky as it might be, in truco it is of very bad taste to cheat. Whether when writing down the score, hiding cards or cheat shuffling ("cartearse", to card yourself).

== Pica Pica ==

In a game of 6, sometimes ''Pica Pica'' is also played. When players get their cards, instead of playing the 2 teams of 3, each confronted pair of players of different teams play a game, adding the resulting points to their teams. Usually ''Pica Pica'' played is every other game, but only if a team has 5 or more points, and no team has more than 20 (or 25). ''Pica Pica'' is also known as ''Punta y Hacha''.

This is a way of finishing the game more quickly, because each pair in a pica pica plays a complete hand, with corresponding scores. Therefore, it is possible to have, for example, three "vale cuatro" in the same hand, which raises scores very quickly. However, envidos and its raises are usually capped (the most usual cap being 6 points).

== Truco in Brazil ==

Truco is also a popular game in [[Brazil]], with many regional variations, some similar to the Spanish counterparts, although the most known versions (''Truco Paulista'' and ''Truco Mineiro'') use a [[French playing cards|French deck]] and different rules. ''Truco Paulista'' can be known as ''Ponta Acima'' in some regions.

Truco in Brazil is mostly associated to [[college]] culture and lifestyle. The custom of students sitting on a table to play the game while drinking alcoholic beverages has become a [[stereotype]] itself, in such a way that it has even been featured prominently in advertising campaigns and it has been included in the program of every University "Olympic" Games around the country, known as ''Jogos Universitários''. ''Truco'' can be played by two, three and even four people in each team, which makes it more way exciting and intriguing.

Brazilian ''Truco'' differs from the game played in other countries in various ways, including a maximum score of 12 points, the value of each hand and the card ranking (which itself can be different depending on where the game is played. It is also common to use a best-of-three games system when playing truco.

=== Truco Paulista ===
''Truco Paulista'' is played mostly (but not limited to) the state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] and most usually played between two teams of two players each. The game is won by the first team to reach 12 points, with each regular round being worth 1 point.

One of the players is chosen to be the first to shuffle and deal. The dealer is allowed to look at the faces of the cards while shuffling so as to be able to place certain cards at certain spots within the deck (e.g. placing the highest-ranking cards together). They are not allowed, however, to browse freely through the deck. After shuffling, the deck must be handed to the player to the left (the ''cortador''), who can either reshuffle the deck (without looking at the faces of the cards), separate it into two or more parts or simply do nothing. The deck (or the part of it chosen by the ''cortador'', provided it contains at least than 12 cards) is then returned to the dealer who will deal the cards from the top or bottom of the deck (this is chosen by the ''cortador''). The cards must be dealt counter-clockwise, starting with the player to the dealer's right. They can be dealt one at a time or, most commonly, three at a time. If the ''cortador'' chooses not to reshuffle, they can deal their and their partner's cards in advance.

The players each play one card, starting with the player to the right of the dealer, the ''mão'' (hand) and ending with the dealer, called the ''pé'' (foot). The player who played the highest-ranked card wins the trick for the team and begins the following trick.

The rounds consist of a best-of-three tricks. The team that wins two tricks wins the round and gets the point. If the first trick (or first and second tricks) ends in a tie, the winner of the next trick wins the round. If the second or third tricks end in a tie, the winner of the first trick wins the hand. In the rare occasion that all three tricks end in ties, nobody is awarded the point. In the case of a tie, the following trick is started by the player who tied the last trick.

At any point during the game any of the players can raise the stakes by saying ''truco''. When a player ''asks for truco'', the opposing team has three options:
# Accept: the round is now worth '''three''' points;
# Run away: the team that asked for ''truco'' gets '''one''' point;
# Raise the stakes even further by ''asking for 6'' (this can also be done later at any point if the team chooses to accept the ''truco'').
If the team chooses to ''ask for 6'' they are automatically accepting that the round is now worth three points while trying to raise the stakes even further. The opposing team (the one who asked for ''truco'' in the first place) has the same three options:
# Accept: the round is now worth '''six''' points;
# Run away: the team that ''asked for 6'' gets '''three''' points;
# Raise the stakes even further by ''asking for 9''.
This system goes on in this same pattern, with the players being able to raise the stakes further to ''game'' and finally ''match.''

When one of the teams reaches 11 points, they play the ''mão-de-onze'' (round of eleven). In this round, the members of each team can see their partner's cards before the round begins and the team with eleven points may choose to play the round of run away. If they choose to play, the round is worth three points. If they choose to run away, the opposing team is awarded one point. If any of the players ask for truco during the round of eleven, the team loses the round. For this reason, if one of the players is dealt an unbeatable hand (having the two best cards at the same time) they may simply show the cards to the rest of the table and win the round without having to play. If both teams reach eleven points, the round must be played.

If one of the players receives fewer or more than three cards dealt by a member of the opposing team, they can point out this error after the round has begun and win the round. If the error is pointed out before the hand begins the deck must be shuffled and the cards dealt again.

In ''truco paulista'' the cards are ranked in the following order, from strongest to weakest:
* Trump cards;
* 3s;
* 2s;
* Aces;
* Kings;
* Jacks;
* Queens;
* 7s;
* 6s;
* 5s;
* 4s;
8s, 9s and 10s are never included. Upon agreement, the 7s, 6s, 5s, and 4s can be removed from the deck, this is called playing with a clean deck (''jogar com baralho limpo'').

After the cards are dealt, one card from the remainder of the deck is turned over to determine the ''trump cards'' (''manilhas''), which rank above all others. The trump cards are the cards directly above the one which was turned over (e.g. if the card revealed is a 7, the trump cards are the queens). The strength of a trump card when compared to the others is determined by its suit, with diamonds being the weakest, followed by spades, hearts and clubs being the strongest.

=== Truco mineiro ===
''Truco mineiro'' is a variety of truco played mostly in the state of [[Minas Gerais]], but also not limited to it. The rules are mostly the same as in ''truco paulista'', with only a few differences:
* Regular rounds are worth 2 points instead of 1;
* When a player ''asks for truco'', they propose the round be worth 4 points; if refused, the team receives 2 points.
* When a player ''asks for 6'', they propose the round be worth 8 points; if refused, the team receives 4 points;
* When a player ''asks for 9'', they propose the round be worth 10 points; if refused, the team receives 8 points;
In ''truco mineiro'', the round of eleven is replaced by the roughly similar ''round of ten'', the only differences (aside from the number of points required) being that only the team with ten points is allowed to see each other's cards and that the round is worth four points instead of three. If both teams reach ten points the round must be played and they are not allowed to see each other's cards.

''Truco mineiro'' uses a fixed set of trump cards, so there is no need to turn one card over after dealing to determine them (the order of the suits remain the same, however). The ranking of the cards is as follows:
* 4 of clubs (known as ''zap'');
* 7 of hearts;
* Ace of spades (known as ''espadilha'');
* 7 of diamonds (known as ''pica fumo'' or simply ''sete de ouros'');
* 3s;
* 2s;
* Aces (except the ace of spades);
* Kings;
* Jacks;
* Queens;
* 7s (clubs and spades only);
* 6s;
* 5s;
* 4s (except the 4 of clubs);
As an alternative, the game can also be played with only the cards up to the Queens, removing the weaker cards 4 through 7.

=== Signals ===
Most teams communicate through body or facial signals as a way of making their partners aware of their hands without having to show it to everyone at the table. The signals for each trump card are standard among most players, making it easy for new teammates to communicate with each other without previously defining signals, although long-time partners usually develop their own unique signals. The standard signals are the following:
*'''A wink''': ''Zap'' (trump of clubs)
*'''Raising both eyebrows''': ''Copas'' (trump of hearts)
*'''Pressing tongue against the cheek''': ''Espadilha'' (trump of spades)
*'''Showing the tip of the tongue''': ''Pica fumo'' (trump of diamonds)

== Señas ==

Señas are gestures that are used among players of the same team to tell the pie (hand captain) their most valuables cards or if they have good score for a potential envido situation. The most generally accepted señas are as follows:

*'''Ancho de Espadas (Ace of swords)''' - Both eyebrows up or wink with the right eye.
*'''Ancho de Bastos (Ace of clubs)''' - Wink with the left eye.
*'''Siete de Espadas (Seven of swords)''' - With lips closed, slightly move the right side to the right.
*'''Siete de Oro (Seven of gold)''' - With lips closed, slightly move the left side to the left.
*'''Tres (Any three)''' - Slowly and gently move the lower lip inside and take it back out slightly biting it with the two front teeth.
*'''Dos (Any two)''' - With lips closed, move them to the outside as if they were simulating a kiss. The lips remaining closed all the time.
*'''Ancho Falso (Ace of cups and ace of gold)''' - Mouth open for few seconds or inflate the cheeks.
*'''High score for envido''' - Shrink the middle of the face in such a way that the skin of the nose shrinks too. Another usual gesture is to slightly (and quickly) tilt your head towards the shoulder.
*'''Low or no score for truco'''- Both eyes closed.
*'''12, 11 or 10'''- Touching shoulder, chin, triceps of the arm or elbow respectively.
Performing the señas during the game is a skill that takes time to master. The player has to be very careful not to be seen by players of the opposite team, although because of this the señas also can be used as a strategy to trick them (for example, show a gesture of a low valuable card and then play with an unexpected card).

== Jargon ==

There are lots of informal expressions that have become part of the art of playing the game. Examples of jargon are described below:

*'''Siete bravo (brave seven)''' - the seven of spades and the seven of gold are sometimes referred to as brave sevens.
*'''Estar cargado (to be loaded)''' - to have high score for a potential envido or to have a good hand for truco.
*'''Vení (come)''' - this is said to a player by the pie (team captain) in order to ask him to play his lowest card.
*'''Vení acá (come here)''' - this is said to a player by the pie (team captain) in order to ask him to play his lowest card because he (the pie) supposedly has a good card to win the hand.
*'''Andá allá (go there)''' - this is said to a player by the pie (team captain) in order to ask him to play his lowest card because some other player has a good card to win the hand. Makes no sense in two-men team, so is usually used in 3-men team games.
*'''Estoy seco (I'm dry)''' or '''Estoy ciego (I'm blind)''' - this is said by a player to specify that he either has no points for envido or good cards to win the hand.
*'''No ha venido''' - This is said in a rhyming response to an envido when the player wants to refuse it.
*'''Va por las tuyas (Go on your own)''' - This is said by a player who does not have a good score when either truco or envido is proposed, to let other players know that they should accept or decline based on their cards solely.
*'''Falta un vidrio''' - This is sometimes said humorously, because it sounds like "falta envido".
*'''Jugala callado (Play it quietly)''' - This is said so that the other player plays his hand without calling truco or envido.
*'''Son las tuyas (It's yours (your cards))''' - This is said to indicate that the other player in one's team should state his envido because one's is too poor.
*'''A cara de perro''' - Literally dog-faced. That means players require of each other perfect compliance with the rules, especially regarding the displaying of envido. When playing among friends, often a player is excused if he forgets to show his cards for envido. However, when playing with strangers or for money, people tend to play "a cara de perro", meaning that they do not accept any error on the opponent's part. Another example would be interpreting any word as being a call in the game, even when it's obvious by context that it is not so.
*'''Está peluda''' - This is said to a player either when you can win the hand but it leaves you with no other cards or when you have low cards and winning the hand is unlikely.
*'''Dormir adentro/ Dormir afuera (Sleep inside/ Sleep outside''' - This is said either when a team makes more than 15 points or less than 15 points respectively.

=== Brazilian Jargon ===
*'''Baralho Vazio'''/''' Baralho Limpo''' (empty deck/clean deck) - used for the variations where the lowest cards  7s, 6s, 5s and 4s are not used.
*'''Baralho cheio'''/''' Baralho sujo''' (full deck/ dirty deck) - uses all the 40 cards.
*'''Melar'''/'''Cangar'''/'''Embuchar'''/'''Amarrar''' - to play a card of the same value of the highest card at the table.
*'''Mão de Onze''' (also '''mão de dez''')- When a player (or team) or both players (or teams) has 11 (or 10) points.
*'''Mão de Ferro''' (also '''mão escondida''')- When both teams have left 1 point to win the game (which means 11 points) so the last round is playable in the dark (''no escuro'') where no-one sees the cards. (This option is chosen by the players and both teams must agree. Usually played in ''Truco Paulista'').
*'''Cair''' (to fall) - To accept a Truco, Seis or Nove.
*'''Correr''' (to run) - To quit when the other player (or team) calls Truco, Seis or Nove.
*'''Manilhas''' - The trump cards.
In ''Truco Paulista'', ''manilha'' are the cards of the next number of the one who was trumped at the beginning of the round. For example: if you trumped a 2, the manilha will be the 3s. Then, the strength of each manilha depends on the stamp, which follows (strongest to weakest): clubs (zap), hearts (copas), spades (espadilha), diamonds (pica-fumo).
*'''Mão''' (hand) - The first to play.
*'''Pé''' (foot) - The last to play.
*'''Marreco'''/'''Pato''' ([[duck]]) - During the game, the losers are called ''patos'' or ''marrecos''.
*'''Turco''' (Turk),'''Túlio''' (a male name),'''Suco''' (juice)... - words sounding close to ''truco'', used to joke (and scare team partners) during a ''Mão de Onze'', when it is not allowed to call truco (mostly the play that say ''truco'' lose the game instantly).
*'''Na testa''' (to the forehead) - When you have the strongest card in the game, the ''Zap'', in order to show your complete happiness for winning that round you scream ''Na testa!'' and smash the card directly to the opponent's forehead. You can even lick it before, which is very common.
*'''Meio Pau'''/'''Meio saco''' (half dick/half sack)- to call ''Seis'' (works like a retruco). Meio means half and Seis is 6 (half dozen). However, in many variations, Seis does not mean 6 points.
*'''Morrer de pau duro''' (to die with a boner) - When you lose the round having in your hand the strongest card in the game, the ''Zap''.
*'''Surra de pau mole''' (equivalent to "pig blapping") - This one has many similar meanings. Basically it means when you bluff and win the game or round having absolutely nothing in your hand.
*'''Passar de baixo da mesa''' (to pass under the table) - When the opponents lose without making any points, they have to literally pass under the table as a punishment. It is used mainly in the southern like in the state of Santa Catarina

Many times jargon is used to make the other team believe one's team has better or worse cards than it really does. For instance: if one is holding the As of spades and a worthless card he could say "estou seco" I'm dry, to indicate he hasn't got any better cards so that the other team will go for a truco on the last hand.

'''Vadya''' ([[IAST]]: Vādya, वाद्य), also called ''Vadyaka'' or ''Atodya'', is one of the three components of ''[[sangita]]'' (musical performance arts), and refers to "instrumental music" in the Indian traditions.&lt;ref name="Rowell2015p13"/&gt;&lt;ref name=mmwvadya/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barthakur2003p3"/&gt; The other two components of ''sangita'' are ''gita'' (vocal music, song) and ''nrtya'' (dance, movement).&lt;ref name="Rowell2015p13"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lewis Rowell|title=Music and Musical Thought in Early India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h5_UCgAAQBAJ |year=2015| publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-73034-9| page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kunst2013p88"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jaap Kunst|title=Hindu-Javanese Musical Instruments|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ytLoCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88|year= 2013|publisher= Springer Science|isbn=978-94-011-9185-2|pages=88 with footnote 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ArnoldNettl2000p321"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alison Arnold|author2=Bruno Nettl|title=The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music: South Asia : the Indian subcontinent|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOlNv8MAXIEC&amp;pg=PA321|year=2000|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-8240-4946-1|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the general sense, ''Vadya'' means an instrument and the characteristic music they produce, sound or play out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lewis Rowell|title=Music and Musical Thought in Early India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h5_UCgAAQBAJ |year=2015| publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-73034-9| pages=113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mandakranta Bose|title=Movement and Mimesis: The Idea of Dance in the Sanskritic Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JS_pCAAAQBAJ |year=2012|publisher=Springer Science|isbn=978-94-011-3594-8|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Vadya'' in the sense of "music, sounded, played, uttered" appears in the Vedic literature such as in the ''Aitareya Brahmana'', and in early post-Vedic era Sanskrit texts such as the ''[[Natya Shastra]]'', ''[[Panchatantra]]'', ''Malvikagnimitra'' and ''Kathasaritsagara''.&lt;ref name=mmwvadya&gt;Monier Monier-Williams, [http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0900/mw__0973.html Sanskrit-English Dictionary with Etymology], Oxford University Press, page 940&lt;/ref&gt; These texts call the musician or the performer on the musical instrument as ''Vadyadhara''.&lt;ref name=mmwvadya/&gt; A stringed instrument is described with proportional lengths in ''Jaiminiya Brahmana'' and ''Aitareya Aranyaka'', and these are compared to poetical meters.&lt;ref name="Nijenhuis1992p12"&gt;{{cite book|author=Emmie Te Nijenhuis|title=Saṅgītaśiromaṇi: A Medieval Handbook of Indian Music |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kGzESuCeK-sC |year= 1992|publisher= BRILL Academic |isbn= 90-04-09498-9|pages= 12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sanskrit literature such as ''Natya Shastra'' describes four types of ''Vadya'':&lt;ref name="ArnoldNettl2000p321"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barthakur2003p3"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dilip Ranjan Barthakur|title=The Music and Musical Instruments of North Eastern India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oP4vH-4oSEcC |year=2003|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=978-81-7099-881-5|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wade1987p88"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bonnie C.

*''Susira'': hollow musical instrument ([[aerophone]])
*''Ghana'': solid musical instrument ([[idiophone]])
*''Avanaddha'': covered musical instrument ([[membranophone]])

The chapter 14 of the ''Saṅgītaśiromaṇi'' describes musical ensembles based on a collective performance of ''vadya'' instruments by musicians, and it calls such a band orchestra as a ''Kutapa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Emmie Te Nijenhuis|title=Saṅgītaśiromaṇi: A Medieval Handbook of Indian Music |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kGzESuCeK-sC |year=1992|publisher=BRILL Academic |isbn=90-04-09498-9|pages=524–525}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Vadya'' also appears in the Buddhist Sanskrit text ''[[Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra|Sukhavativyuha]]'', influential in the Chinese and Japanese traditions, which Luis Gomez translates as "instrumental music".&lt;ref&gt;Luis Gómez (1996), The Land of Bliss: Sanskrit and Chinese Versions of the Sukhāvatīvyūha Sutras, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8248-1760-2}}, page 72 (verse 28.23)&lt;/ref&gt; The 17th-century text ''Sangeeta Darpana'' defines ''sangita'' (musical arts) as "Gītam Vādyam Tathā Nrityam Trayan Sangeeta Muchyate", which states Dona means, ''sangita'' comprises ''gīta'' (vocal music), ''vādya'' (instrumental music) and ''nritya'' (dance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dona | first=Lasanthi Manaranjanie Kalinga | title=On the Therapeutic Aspects of Indian Classical Music | journal=Musik-, Tanz und Kunsttherapie | publisher=Hogrefe Publishing | volume=23 | issue=1 | year=2012 | doi=10.1026/0933-6885/a000069 | pages=8–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hindu-Javanese music tradition, ''Vadya'' is called ''Vaditra''.&lt;ref name="Kunst2013p88"/&gt; According to [[Roger Blench]], most scholars consider the African term ''[[Valiha]]'' for tube zither to be rooted in the Sanskrit term ''Vadya'', reflecting a period of cultural exchange over the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Blench (2014), Using Diverse Sources of Evidence for Reconstructing the Past History of Musical Exchanges in the Indian Ocean, African Archaeological Review, Volume 31, Issue 4 (December), pp 675–703&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Rosenbaum was born in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, into a Jewish family. His parents, Bernhard and Frederikke (Lichtinger) Rosenbaum, were both musicians: his father a [[Viola|violist]] in the [[Royal Danish Orchestra]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kglteater.dk/site/OmKunstarterne/Ensembler/Det_Kongelige_Kapel/Tidslinjen.aspx | title = Det Kongelige Teater – Kort fortalt | accessdate = 3 October 2010 | language = Danish | quote = My father played in the orchestra for more than 30 years – we couldn't recognise him, when he came home.

He gave his first piano recital when he was eight years old, and in 1918 was awarded a full scholarship at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Music]], studying under [[Olivo Krause]]. Later on, he was taught by [[Victor Schiøler]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]'s student [[Frederic Lamond (pianist)|Frederic Lamond]], and [[Ferruccio Busoni|Busoni]]'s pupil [[Egon Petri]].

Borge played his first major concert in 1926 at the Danish Odd Fellow Palæet (''The Odd Fellow's Lodge building'') concert hall. After a few years as a classical concert pianist, he started his now famous "[[stand-up comedy|stand-up]]" act, with the signature blend of piano music and jokes. He married American Elsie Chilton in 1933, the same year he debuted with his revue acts.&lt;ref name="Jensen1966"&gt;{{cite book

When the German armed forces occupied Denmark on April 9, 1940, during [[World War II]], Borge was playing a concert in [[Sweden]] and managed to escape to [[Finland]].&lt;ref name="Sears1986"&gt;{{cite book

===Move to America===
Even though Borge did not speak a word of English upon arrival, he quickly managed to adapt his jokes to the American audience, learning English by watching movies. He took the name of Victor Borge, and in 1941, he started on [[Rudy Vallee]]'s radio show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Borge quickly rose to fame, winning Best New Radio Performer of the Year in 1942. Soon after the award, he was offered film roles with stars such as [[Frank Sinatra]] (in ''[[Higher and Higher (film)|Higher and Higher]]''). While hosting ''[[The Victor Borge Show]]'' on [[NBC]] beginning in 1946,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; he developed many of his trademarks, including repeatedly announcing his intent to play a piece but getting "distracted" by something or other, making comments about the audience, or discussing the usefulness of [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]]'s "[[Minute Waltz]]" as an egg timer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|issn=0032-4558 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He would also start out with some well-known classical piece like [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s "[[Moonlight Sonata]]" and suddenly move into a harmonically similar pop or jazz tune, such as [[Cole Porter]]'s "[[Night and Day (song)|Night and Day]]" or "[[Happy Birthday to You]]."

===Borge's style===
One of Borge's other famous routines was  "Phonetic Punctuation," in which he read a passage from a book and added exaggerated sound effects to stand for all of the [[punctuation]] marks, such as periods, commas, and exclamation marks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|issn=0006-2510 
|quote=Victor Borge and his dead-pan interpretations of phonetic punctuation and gags clicked soundly with the pew-sitters.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is his "Inflationary Language," in which he added one to every number or homophone of a number in the words he spoke. For example: "once upon a time" becomes "twice upon a time," "wonderful" becomes "twoderful," "forehead" becomes "fivehead," "anyone for tennis" becomes "anytwo five elevennis," "I ate a tenderloin with my fork and so on and so forth" becomes "'I nine an elevenderloin with my five'k' and so on and so fifth."&lt;ref name="Cullen2007" /&gt;
[[File:Victor Borge in concert 1957.JPG|thumb|left|175px|Borge performing before an audience in 1957]]
Borge used physical and visual elements in his live and televised performances. He would play a strange-sounding piano tune from sheet music, looking increasingly confused; turning the sheet upside down or sideways, he would then play the actual tune, flashing a joyful smile of accomplishment to the audience (he had, at first, been literally playing the tune upside down or sideways). When his energetic playing of another song would cause him to fall off the piano bench, he would open the seat lid, take out the two ends of an automotive seat belt, and buckle himself onto the bench, "for safety." Conducting an orchestra, he might stop and order a violinist who had played a sour note to get off the stage, then resume the performance and have the other members of the section move up to fill the empty seat while they were still playing. From off stage would come the sound of a gunshot.

His musical sidekick in the 1960s, [[Leonid Hambro]], was also a well-known concert pianist. In 1968, classical pianist [[Şahan Arzruni]] joined him as his straight man, performing together on one piano a version of [[Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2|Liszt's Second Hungarian Rhapsody]], considered a musical-comedic classic.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|qyArTMtgT1w|Victor Borge – Hungarian Rhapsody #2. December 3, 2015 - This video is unavailable. &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also enjoyed interacting with the audience. Seeing an interested person in the front row, he would ask them, "Do you like good music?" or "Do you care for piano music?" After an affirmative answer, Borge would take a piece of sheet music from his piano and say, "Here is some," and hand it over. After the audience's laughter died down, he would say, "That'll be $1.95" (or whatever the current price might be). He would then ask whether the audience member could read music; if the member said yes, he would ask a higher price. If he got no response from the audience after a joke, he would often add "...when this ovation has died down, of course." The delayed punchline to handing the person the sheet music would come when he would reach the end of a number and begin playing the penultimate notes over and over, with a puzzled look. He would then go back to the person in the audience, retrieve the sheet music, tear off a piece of it, stick it on the piano, and play the last couple of notes from it.

Making fun of modern theater, he would sometimes begin a performance by asking if there were any children in the audience. There always were, of course. He would sternly order them out, then say, "We do have some children in here; that means I can't do the second half in the nude. I'll wear the tie. (pause) The long one. (pause) The very long one, yes."&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|Lx4n9P4bLEo|Victor Borge – Funny Jokes -Part 1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his stage shows in later years, he would include a segment with opera singer Marilyn Mulvey. She would try to sing an aria, and he would react and interrupt, with such antics as falling off the bench in "surprise" when she hit a high note. He would also remind her repeatedly not to rest her hand on the piano, telling her that if she got used to it, "and one day a piano was not there – ''Fffftttt!'' " After the routine, the spotlight would fall upon Mulvey and she would sing a serious number with Borge accompanying in the background.

===Later career===
Borge appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show|Toast of the Town]]'' hosted by [[Ed Sullivan]] several times during 1948. He became a [[naturalization|naturalized citizen]] of the United States the same year. He started the ''[[Comedy in Music]] '' show at [[John Golden Theatre]] in [[New York City]] on 2 October 1953. ''Comedy in Music'' became the longest running one-man show in the history of theater with 849 performances when it closed on 21 January 1956, a feat which placed it in the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]]''.&lt;ref name="Young1998"&gt;{{cite book

Victor Borge continued to tour until his last days, performing up to 60 times per year when he was 90 years old.

===Other endeavors===
Borge made several appearances on the long-running TV show ''[[What's My Line?]]'', both as a celebrity panelist, and as a contestant with the occupation "poultry farmer" (the latter was not a comedy routine; as a business venture, Borge raised and popularized [[Cornish game hen|Rock Cornish game hens]] starting in the 1950s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-Ps0H6Fwro | title = YouTube – Victor Borge—What's My Line | accessdate =2 October 2010 | date = 11 October 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Borge helped start several trust funds, including the Thanks to Scandinavia Fund,&lt;ref name="NYTimesObit"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/26/classified/paid-notice-deaths-borge-victor.html?ref=victor_borge | title = Paid Notice – Deaths BORGE, VICTOR – Paid Death Notice – NYTimes.com: | accessdate =2 October 2010 | work=The New York Times | date=26 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was started in dedication to those who helped the Jews escape the German persecution during the war.&lt;ref name="NYTimesObit" /&gt;

On 23 December 2000, Borge died in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], at the age of 91, after more than 80 years of entertaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1085323.stm|title=Comedian Victor Borge dies|date=24 December 2000|newspaper=BBC News|access-date=8 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160802190000/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1085323.stm|archive-date=2 August 2016|dead-url=|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2018|reason=The length of his entertainment career is not given in the source.}} He died peacefully in his sleep a day after returning from a concert in Denmark.

As per Borge's wishes, his connection to both the United States and Denmark was marked by having part of his ashes interred at [[Putnam Cemetery]] in Greenwich, with a replica of the iconic Danish statue ''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]]'' sitting on a large rock at the grave site, and the other part in [[Jewish Western Cemetery (Copenhagen)|Western Jewish Cemetery]] (''Mosaisk Vestre Begravelsesplads''), Copenhagen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Bente | last = Clausen | title = Victor Borges aske deles | date = 9 May 2001 | url = http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/219265:Kirke---tro--Victor-Borges-aske-deles | work=Kristeligt Dagblad | accessdate =3 October 2010 | language = Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Walt's Time: from before to beyond''''' is a 252-page autobiographical, full-color book by [[Robert B. Sherman]] and [[Richard M. Sherman]]. It was edited by [[Walt Disney Imagineering|Disney Imagineers]] Bruce Gordon, David Mumford and Jeff Kurtti and was published in 1998 by Camphor Tree Publishers of [[Santa Clarita, California]]. Bruce Gordon did the book design and layout.

==General outline==

The book is divided into three major sections.

===Section One:  "Walt's Time"===

The first section, "Walt’s Time", describes the Shermans’ years with [[Walt Disney]] at [[The Walt Disney Company]] starting with their first composition, [[Annette Funicello]]’s "[[Strummin’ Song]]", and continuing through 1967's ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]''.

===Section Two:  "Al's Time"===

The other influential person in their life, their father, [[Al Sherman]], himself a well-known songwriter in the 1930s and '40s, is covered in the middle section, "Al's Time." This part of the book discusses Al's life from coming to America as a Russian immigrant to becoming a successful songwriter for famous musicians including [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Al Jolson]], [[Lawrence Welk]] and [[Maurice Chevalier]]. This section also talks about the Shermans' early days growing up in Beverly Hills, their college years, [[Robert B. Sherman|Robert]]'s tour in [[World War II]] and their early, separate careers. The section ends where the first section starts, their first meeting with [[Walt Disney]].

===Section Three:  "Our Time"===

The final section of the book, “Our Time,” deals with the Shermans' life after Walt Disney and includes many more Disney projects including ''[[Winnie the Pooh]]'' and [[Epcot]]. This part also includes their many and varied non-Disney projects, including ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (film)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'', ''[[Snoopy Come Home]]'' and [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Tom Sawyer (1973 film)|Tom Sawyer]]'': A Musical Adaptation. The section concludes with their work on Disneyland's 1998 [[New Tomorrowland]]. The book also includes appendices with a song list, video list and some notes on their unpublished material. ''Walt's Time'' also includes a [[preface]] by then Walt Disney Company's vice-chairman [[Roy E. Disney]], a foreword by the Vice Chairman of Walt Disney Imagineering [[Marty Sklar]], and an introduction by Disney film historian [[Leonard Maltin]]. Also included are afterwords by each of the three editors as well as a thorough discography and videography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laughingplace.com/News-ID500880.asp LaughingPlace.com: Review: Walt's Time: From Before to Beyond, (The #1 Site for Disney)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wheel gymnastics''' (German: [[:de:Rhönradturnen|Rhönradturnen]]) is a form of [[gymnastics]] that originated in [[Germany]].

Wheel gymnasts do [[exercise]]s in a large [[wheel]] or [[hooping|hoop]] known as the '''Rhönrad''', '''gymnastics wheel''', '''gym wheel''', or '''German wheel''', in the beginning also known as '''ayro wheel''', '''aero wheel''', and '''Rhon rod'''. The large wheel consists of two circles, which are connected with six spokes. The diameter of the wheel depends on the length of the gymnast, so that the gymnast can hold himself on the grips when fully stretched.  The wheels are available from a diameter of 130 to 245cm. The wheels weigh between 40 and 60 kg. They are available in several depths and colors.

==History==
The wheel was invented in 1925 by [[Otto Feick]] in [[Schönau an der Brend]]. The grandson of a [[blacksmith]], Feick was inspired by the memory of an event from his childhood in [[Reichenbach-Steegen|Reichenbach]], when he had tied sticks between two [[Hoop rolling|hoop]]s that his grandfather had made and rolled down a hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/rhoenraderfinder-otto-feick-patent-fuer-zwei-reifen-und.871.de.html?dram:article_id=336201 |title=Patent für zwei Reifen und sechs Sprossen |trans-title=Patent For Two Hoops and Six Cross-bars |work=Deutschlandfunk |first=Thomas |last=Jaedicke |language=German |date=8 November 2015 |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He filed for a patent as "wheel-gymnastic and sports equipment". He had invented the wheel in [[Ludwigshafen|Ludwigshafen am Rhein]] ca. 1920-1922, on the grounds of the VSK Germania, a sports club, of which he was the founding chairman. The patent was issued on 8 November 1925; the name "Rhönrad" has been registered and protected since 1926 ("[[Rhön Mountains|Rhön]]" is the name of the mountain region where the wheel was invented).

The   '''Rhönrad''' was featured at the [[GeSoLei]] [[trade fair]] held in [[Düsseldorf]] in 1926.&lt;ref name="wdr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wir in den wilden Zwanzigern - Goldene Jahre (2/2)|url=http://www1.wdr.de/mediathek/video/sendungen/doku-am-freitag/video-wir-in-den-wilden-zwanzigern---goldene-jahre--100.html|website=wdr|publisher=WDR|accessdate=21 April 2017|language=de|date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, this sport was shown at the [[1936 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] in [[Berlin]], but was not presented as an Olympic discipline.

The focus of wheel gymnastics remains largely in Germany.
