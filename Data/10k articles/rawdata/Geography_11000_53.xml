The '''67th parallel north''' is a [[circle of latitude]] that is 67 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] [[true north|north]] of the [[Earth|Earth's]] [[equator|equatorial plane]], about 50&amp;nbsp;km north of the [[Arctic Circle]]. It crosses the [[Atlantic Ocean]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[North America]].

At this latitude the [[sun]] is visible for 24 hours, 0 minutes during the [[summer solstice]] and 1 hour, 30 minutes during the [[winter solstice]].

==Around the world==
Starting at the [[Prime Meridian]] and heading eastwards, the parallel 67° north passes through:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3099">The '''airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS)''' is the second in a series of [[imaging spectrometer]] instruments developed at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) for Earth [[remote sensing]]. This instrument uses scanning optics and four [[spectrometer]]s to image a 614-[[pixel]] swath simultaneously in 224 adjacent [[spectral band]]s.&lt;ref name=er-2&gt;{{cite web

 | accessdate =2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objective==
The main objective of the AVIRIS project is to identify, measure, and monitor constituents of the Earth's surface and atmosphere based on molecular absorption and particle scattering signatures. Research with AVIRIS data is predominantly focused on understanding processes related to the global environment and climate change. AVIRIS research areas include ecology, oceanography, geology, snow hydrology, cloud and atmospheric studies.&lt;ref name=obo&gt;{{cite web

 | date = 27 Nov 2012
 | url = http://aviris.jpl.nasa.gov/index.html
 | accessdate =2013-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Platforms==
AVIRIS has been flown on four aircraft platforms:  the [[Lockheed U-2|NASA ER-2]] jet, [[Twin Otter]] International's turboprop, [[Scaled Composites Proteus]], and NASA's [[WB-57]]. The ER-2 flies at approximately 20&amp;nbsp;km above sea level, at about 730&amp;nbsp;km/hr. The Twin Otter aircraft flies at 4&amp;nbsp;km above ground level at 130&amp;nbsp;km/hr. AVIRIS has flown North America, Europe, portions of South America, and Argentina.&lt;ref name=obo/&gt;

==Initial design and characteristics==
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory proposed to design and develop the AVIRIS in 1983. AVIRIS first measured spectral images in 1987 and measured the solar reflected spectrum from 400 nanometers to 2500 nanometers. AVIRIS measures upwelling radiance through 224 contiguous spectral channels at 10 nanometer intervals across the spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''anthropoid ceramic coffins''' of the Late [[Bronze Age]] [[Levant]] are a unique burial practice that is a synthesis of [[Egyptian culture|Egyptian]] and [[Near Eastern]] ideologies. The coffins date from the 14th to 10th centuries BCE and have been found at [[Deir el-Balah]], [[Beth Shean]], [[Lachish]], [[Tell el-Far’ah]], [[Sahab, Jordan|Sahab]], and most recently in the [[Jezreel Valley]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[Archaeology of the Land of the Bible, pg. 285]&lt;/ref&gt; The coffins show Egyptian influence in the Ancient [[Near East]] and exhibit many Egyptian qualities in the depictions on the face masks on the lids. The lids can be separated into two artistic categories, the [[natural]] and [[grotesque]], and the bodies are separated into ''type A'', tapered from the shoulders, and ''type B'', cylindrical.&lt;ref&gt;[The Cemetery at Deir el-Balah, 1973, p. 2]&lt;/ref&gt; The graves contain wealthy funerary offerings from a variety of origins from [[Cyprus]], [[Mycenae]], [[Egypt]], [[Phoenicia]], and [[Canaan]]. The graves appear to be originally reserved for Egyptian officials and then later became a part of [[Canaan]]ite and [[Philistine]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;[Archaeology of the Land of the Bible, p. 327]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The anthropoid clay coffins are generally believed to have been a product of the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]] in Egypt that were gradually disseminated to other regions and peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[Perry, W.J. "Sumer and Egypt." Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland: Vol. 29 (February 1929), 20.]&lt;/ref&gt; They were one of several forms of burial utilized by [[Sumer]]ians at [[Ur]] and the Egyptians.&lt;ref&gt;[Perry, W.J. "Sumer and Egypt." Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland: Vol. 29 (February 1929), 30.]&lt;/ref&gt; There is some disagreement about the social and economic associations of this form of burial among scholars, which can also be said to vary depending on the site.

The various forms utilized originally by the [[Egyptians]] can be described as inhumation, clay coffins, and tombs with stairways and vaulting. Typically the graves that utilized inhumation or vaulting contained bodies in wooden coffins, which were more valuable than their clay counterparts as well as items of wealth and even human sacrifices. Clay coffins are often associated with the poorest graves in Egyptian society, though not always in [[Levant]].&lt;ref&gt;[Perry, W.J. "Sumer and Egypt." Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland: Vol. 29 (February 1929), 29–30.]&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, Egypt continued to develop new methods of burial whereas Sumer ''stagnated.''&lt;ref&gt;[Perry, W.J. "Sumer and Egypt." Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland: Vol. 29 (February 1929), 31.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929 [[George Horsfield]], who was the Director of Antiquities for [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]], was made aware of a tomb near the city of [[Sahab, Jordan|Sahab]]. He notified [[W.F. Albright]] who personally visited the site. He describes the tomb as ''cistern-like'' and located on a hill [Albright 295]. He notes that the writing found here has no known identification, being dissimilar to both [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and [[Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;[Albright, W. F. "Clay Coffin from Sahab in Transjordan." American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Jul.–Sep.,1932), 296–297.]&lt;/ref&gt; Albright describes his finds at this tomb as similar to findings at [[Beth-shan]] and [[Tell el-Far’ah]], examined by Rowe and Petrie respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[Albright, W. F. "Clay Coffin from Sahab in Transjordan." American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Jul.–Sep.,1932), 298.]&lt;/ref&gt; The objects found here are in stark contrast to those found at Canaanite tombs and are more closely associated with the [[Philistines]].&lt;ref&gt;[Albright, W. F. "Clay Coffin from Sahab in Transjordan." American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Jul.-Sep.,1932), 298-299.]&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the findings suggest a date between the 11th and 12th centuries for the creation of these tombs.&lt;ref&gt;[Albright, W. F. "Clay Coffin from Sahab in Transjordan." American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Jul.–Sep.,1932), 299–300.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Egypt, Petries discovered several burials near [[Tell Nebesheh]] in 1885. As a result of the pottery he located here, he described the tombs as ''Cypriote'' and suggested that they were from the 5th to 7th century B.C.&lt;ref&gt;[Albright, W. F. "Clay Coffin from Sahab in Transjordan." American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Jul.–Sep.,1932), 301.]&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Tell el-Yahuidiyeh]] in 1888, Naville discovered several [[tumuli]] tombs. He described the pottery he found as ''Cypriote'' because he thought it was similar to Petries findings. However, it was actually [[Palestine (region)|Palestinian]] in origin.&lt;ref&gt;[Albright, W. F. "Clay Coffin from Sahab in Transjordan." American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Jul.–Sep.,1932), 303.]&lt;/ref&gt; A scarab found at this site dates to the 11–12th century. Some have suggested that the [[Philistines]] influenced the development of these sites, however it is more likely that they are a result of Egyptian influence.&lt;ref&gt;[Albright, W. F. "Clay Coffin from Sahab in Transjordan." American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Jul.–Sep.,1932), 305-306.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, [[Trude Dothan]] described recent findings at the cemetery of [[Deir el-Balah]] in [[Canaan]]. Items found here can be said to have arrived from a variety of sources. However, there is evidence of strong Egyptian influence on local items as well as items imported from Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;[Dothan, Trude. ‘’Excavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah’’. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 134–135.]&lt;/ref&gt; This is the earliest site of anthropoid coffins in [[Canaan]]. There is speculation about the source of the development of anthropoid coffins at this site, but Dothan believes that the source is more likely Egyptian than Philistine.&lt;ref&gt;[Dothan, Trude. ‘’Excavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah’’. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 145.]&lt;/ref&gt; Items here date from the 11-13th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[Dothan, Trude. ‘’Excavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah’’. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 135.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Coffins==

In a cemetery south of [[Deir el-Balah]] anthropoid coffins where found when locals were reclaiming sand dunes.&lt;ref&gt;[Dothan, Trude. ‘’Excavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah’’. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 1]&lt;/ref&gt; The coffins were found among a few simple burials and when unearthed appeared to be in pristine shape, however they were actually being held together by the sand that had filled the cracks and was supporting the frame of the coffin from external pressure.&lt;ref&gt;[Dothan, Trude. ‘’Excavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah’’. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 3]&lt;/ref&gt; In antiquity many coffins had fallen prey to grave robbers. These disturbed coffins, even though looted of their valuable objects, still hold a great deal of importance. Examining the coffins themselves proves to be of great value.[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/c/clay_coffin.aspx] In earlier times, at the end of the [[Pre-Dynastic]] Period and during the First Dynasty of Sumer and Egypt, clay coffins were imitations of ornamental wooden ones.&lt;ref&gt;[Perry, W.J. "Sumer and Egypt." Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland: Vol. 29 (February 1929), 28–33.]&lt;/ref&gt; Although most commonly found in single graves, at [[Tell el-Yahudiyeh]] there were many coffins placed next to one another in rows. These coffins were painted and plain, painted coffins are not commonly mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;[Albright, W. F. "Clay Coffin from Sahab in Transjordan." American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Jul.–Sep.,1932), 295–306.]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Ceramics===
:Local clay was used for the building of these coffins. Due to the large length, girth, and the weight it seems ideal for the construction to take place near. Moving them long distances wouldn’t have been feasible as the heavy clay would have been fragile. The material makeup of the clay has many impurities; rocks, sand, pot shards, and straw can be found in the shards.&lt;ref&gt;[Dothan, Trude. ‘’Excavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah’’. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 99]&lt;/ref&gt; The inconsistencies in the property of the clay would not have been detrimental to the coffin’s stability, it would in fact have helped the structure. Rocks, sand, grit, and broken shards in the clay would have allowed for less stress on the form while it was drying. This stronger clay would have made the surface require more smoothing attention.

===Construction, Building Technique===
:The coffins where coil built, this technique is done with large amounts of clay formed into coils and then layered upon one another with water or slip to act as a binder between layers.&lt;ref&gt;[Ibid]&lt;/ref&gt;  Whinding and forming the structure, large objects can be built in stages this way as a result of the lower sections being allowed to dry to support the continued addition of clay. Tapered at one or both ends.&lt;ref&gt;[Bloch-Smith, Elizabeth. “Life in Judah from the Perspective of the Dead.” Near Eastern Archaeology, Vol. 65, No. 2, The Archaeology of the Death (Jun., 2002), 135.]&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that the lids were cut out of the forms after the initial building to be reworked and molded, this would have been done at the [[leather hard]] stage when the clay was firm but still mailable.&lt;ref&gt;[Ibid]&lt;/ref&gt; The facial features tend to be formed by molding with the clay that is part of the formed lid, though with lids of the grotesque style applying more clay to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;[Albright, W. F. "Clay Coffin from Sahab in Transjordan." American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Jul.-Sep.,1932), 295–306.]&lt;/ref&gt; Attention was paid most notably to the face lids, secondly to the exterior of the coffin, which was smoothed down and compressed back into itself. And lastly the interior was left rough and undefined with coils still notable.&lt;ref&gt;[Albright, W. F. "Clay Coffin from Sahab in Transjordan." American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Jul.-Sep.,1932), 295–306.]&lt;/ref&gt; Some times handles can be found along the sides of the coffins, used for carrying as well as adapted and molded into representing the facial features on the lids.&lt;ref&gt;[Ibid.]&lt;/ref&gt; Handles seem to be one of the local variations that coffin sport; they are found in Transjordan and Beth-shan. The formations of the arms sculpted thinly along the edge of the lid are a conceptual representation and on a majority of the coffins they are not overly defined.&lt;ref&gt;[Albright, W. F. "Clay Coffin from Sahab in Transjordan." American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Jul.–Sep.,1932), 295–306.]&lt;/ref&gt; There are instances of painted or scribed hieroglyphs on the exteriors of the coffins, though they are usually crudely rendered.&lt;ref&gt;[Ibid]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Completing and Firing===
:The lids of the coffins are more often in better shape then the main bodies. The coffins found in Tomb 116 at [[Deir el-Balah]] have the lids close to intact while the body of the coffin, being fragile, broke easily upon excavation.&lt;ref&gt;[Dothan, Trude. ‘’Excavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah’’. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 30]&lt;/ref&gt; The stability of the clay is determined by how it was treated and how it has been fired. More durable ceramic pieces have been fired to a higher temperature, allowing the clay to dehydrate and burn off all of the water that was mixed into it to create a malleable material to craft and mold with. With the smaller face masks, where more time was devoted to sculpting, molding, and carving the features, more care has then been taken to ensure that they would last. “The coffins were fired in an open fire at a low temperature, which would account for the sometimes crumbly and mottled material.”&lt;ref&gt;[Dothan, Trude. ‘’Excavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah’’. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 90]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Face lids===
Face Lids fall into two categories, naturalistic or grotesque.

==== Natural ====
:[[Realism (arts)|Naturalistic]] Coffin Lids have a clearly shown face. [[File:Anthropid Clay Coffin2.jpg|thumb|border|right|top|upright=1|Anthropoid Clay Coffin with face lid and crossed arms. An example of a naturalistic face lid.]]

::Naturalistic style coffins have well defined heads and facial features. These coffins are often molded in relief and have large Egyptian features, i.e. almond shaped eyes, arched eyebrows, straight noses, and full lips. The hair or wigs tend to be molded less sharply.&lt;ref&gt;[Dothan, Trude. ‘’Excavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah’’. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 10]&lt;/ref&gt; The face lid of the coffins are molded separately and then later replaced upon the larger coffin, the shape of the lid hole also took into consideration the interning of bodies and is large enough for its purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[Dothan, Trude. ‘’Excavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah’’. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 13]&lt;/ref&gt; Distinctive features are the high curved forehead, arched eyebrows and eyelid, broad turned up nose with deeply indented nostrils, plump cheeks, and protruding chin.&lt;ref&gt;[Dothan, Trude. ‘’Excavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah’’. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 10]&lt;/ref&gt;  Flat planes and consistent lines complete the face. Arms are often thin and stick like, crossed or holding objects such as lotus blossoms.&lt;ref&gt;[Dothan, Trude. ‘’Excavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah’’. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 50]&lt;/ref&gt; The formations of the arms sculpted thinly along the edge of the lid are a conceptual representation and on a majority of the coffins they are not overly defined.&lt;ref&gt;[Albright, W. F. "Clay Coffin from Sahab in Transjordan." American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Jul.–Sep.,1932), 295–306.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Grotesque ====
:[[Grotesque]] Coffin Lids have no delineated facial outlines.&lt;ref&gt;[Excavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah’’. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 100]&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Anthropoid Clay Coffin4.jpg|thumb|border|right|top|upright=1|Anthropoid Clay Coffin with face lid and crossed arms. An example of a grotesque face lid.]]

::Grotesque style coffins have eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth, ears, and beard that have been applied separately to the leather hard clay. This can be done with a [[slipping and scoring]] that joins two separate pieces of clay together. "The fact that the lid ''is'' the face gives a bizarre somewhat caricature-like effect."&lt;ref&gt;[Excavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah’’. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 30.]&lt;/ref&gt; The grotesque lids are associated with the later coffins of the 11th-10th centuries BCE and the construction practices of the Philistines.

===Coffin Type===
:Typologically the coffins have been divided into two groups according to the outline of the lids and coffins. The groups are:

==== Group A ====
::This style is the dominant shape at [[Deir el-Balah]], it is mummy shaped with delineated head and shoulders in various proportions and silhouettes. The shape follows he traditional concept of [[Egyptian culture|Egyptian]] anthropoid coffins.

==== Group B ====
::Cylindrical Coffins, or Group B, have a head and shoulders that are not delineated. There is sometimes a round opening at the top of the head with a molded [[pithos]] like rim, this can appear like the opening of a vase. This style can also have a round opening in the base. The bottoms of both the feet are outlined. The lid is small in proportion to the coffin.&lt;ref&gt;[Excavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah’’. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 100]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egyptian Similarities===

:There are many similarities to Egyptian burials and iconography found in Near Eastern Clay Coffins.[https://web.archive.org/web/20141205193734/http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/dept/education/learningresources/factsheets/ancientegyptians/fs_coffins.pdf] Coffins with face lids from Egypt’s poor [http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/4170/Anthropoid_Coffin_of_Thothirdes] have been dated to 18th and 19th Dynasties (ca. 1575-1200).&lt;ref&gt;[Wright, G. Ernest. “Philistine Coffins and Mercenaries.” The Biblical Archaeologist, Vol. 22, No. 3 (Sep., 1959), 52–66.]&lt;/ref&gt; Lotus flowers carved into head masks as a symbol of rebirth. The features of the face have visibly Egyptian, the slanting shape of the eyes, arched eyebrows, and representation of the hair and the wigs are the most notable.&lt;ref&gt;[Excavations at the Cemetery of Deir el-Balah’’. Qedem, Monographs of the Institute of Archaeology: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1979. 50.]&lt;/ref&gt; Roman coffins, from an later period then our Near Eastern coffins, are poor earthenware imitations. Both the Near Eastern coffins and those of the Roman’s are imitations of Egyptian style coffins with individual features being characteristic of the regions they were crafted.&lt;ref&gt;[Albright, W. F. "Clay Coffin from Sahab in Transjordan." American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 36, No. 3 (Jul.–Sep.,1932), 295–306.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burials==

There were burials containing anthropoid ceramic coffins excavated at the sites of [[Deir el-Balah]] and [[Beth Shean]] predominantly, however there were coffins found in smaller numbers at [[Lachish]], [[Tell el-Far’ah]], [[Sahab, Jordan|Sahab]], and the [[Jezreel Valley]]. Many of the excavated anthropoid ceramic coffins from [[Deir el-Balah]] were buried in similar ritual contexts dating from the 14th-11th centuries BCE. The coffins were cut into a foundation of Kurkar (sandstone) or hamrah (red sand) and lined with rough stones and oriented to the west.&lt;ref&gt;[The Cemetery at Deir el-Balah, 1973, p. 1]&lt;/ref&gt;  The coffins at [[Deir el-Balah]] were marked with large [[pithoi]] at the head of the burial with dipper jugs inside and bowls on top serving as lids, these deposits served as the grave markers. At [[Deir el-Balah]] the coffins typically contained more than one individual and contained up to four people in some cases. At [[Beth Shean]] the coffins were placed into rock cut tombs also facing the west from the same time period as [[Deir el-Balah]].&lt;ref&gt;[The Northern Cemetery at Beth Shean, p. 91 ]&lt;/ref&gt; The northern cemetery at [[Beth Shean]] contained roughly fifty coffins with surviving face lids.&lt;ref&gt;[Ibid]&lt;/ref&gt; These graves had been disturbed in antiquity and the amount of information left was sparse. The coffins from [[Beth Shean]] were unique and were adorned with headdresses, which some have suggested to mean they are of [[Philistine]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;[Biblical Archaeology Review]&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Lachish]] and [[Tell el-Far’ah]] the several rock cut tombs found there containing anthropoid ceramic coffins date from a later period, 12th–10th centuries BCE, and are mostly associated with [[Philistine]] offerings.&lt;ref&gt;[Archaeology of the Land of the Bible, p. 283]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Offerings==
[[File:Antrhopid Clay Coffin3.jpg|thumb|border|right|top|upright=1.5|Interior of an Anthropoid Clay Coffin, ceramic vessels.]]
These burials were typically associated with a large variety of expensive grave offerings. The offerings consist of [[ceramics]], [[bronzes]], and [[jewelry]] of precious metals and stones. Wide ranges of ceramic offerings are found with the burials such as [[Cyprus|Cypriot]], [[Canaan]]ite, [[Egyptian culture|Egyptian]], [[Mycenae]]an, and [[Philistine]] pottery.&lt;ref&gt;[The Cemetery at Deir el-Balah, 1973, p. 3 ]&lt;/ref&gt; The pottery can be separated into two categories, that which is found ''within the coffin'' and that which is found ''outside of the coffin''. The pottery found outside of the coffin is typically larger and of a more utilitarian variety, such as storage jars, [[pithoi]], stirrup jars, and cooking pots. The pottery found inside the coffins is smaller and of a higher quality, including Cypriots milk bowls, Egyptian alabaster cups, pilgrim flasks, and juglets. The earlier burials (14th–12th centuries BCE) were associated with more Egyptian influenced pottery and finds, whereas the later burials (12th–10th centuries BCE) were associated with the [[Philistine]] culture.

Bronze tools and implements were another common burial offering associated with anthropoid ceramic coffins. The bronze items are usually Egyptian in style and consist of bowls, pitchers, knives, and in one case a wine set. The wine set consisted of a bronze pitcher and a strainer and is one of only a few complete sets found.&lt;ref&gt;[Anthropoid Clay Coffins from a Late Bronze Age Cemetery at Deir el-Balah, p. 10]&lt;/ref&gt; In a rich coffin of a woman at Deir el-Balah an [[Egyptian New Kingdom]] style bronze mirror was found. Bronze was not the only type metal artifact found; in one of the tombs at Tell el-Far’ah one of oldest pieces of ''Iron'' in the [[Levant]] was found.&lt;ref&gt;[The Cemetery at Deir el-Balah, 1973, p. 103]&lt;/ref&gt;

These anthropoid ceramic coffins appear to have been associated with wealthier individuals and consequently have a trove of expensive small finds. Many beads from necklaces and bracelets made of expensive materials were found inside the coffins.&lt;ref&gt;[Archaeology of the Land of the Bible, p. 298]&lt;/ref&gt; Golden beads in the shapes of [[palmettes]] and lotus blossoms were common and showed the incorporation of Egyptian and [[Near Eastern]] art motifs in the funerary adornment. Many of the beads found were made out of a semi-precious stone, carnelian.&lt;ref&gt;[The Cemetery at Deir el-Balah, 1973, p. 27 ]&lt;/ref&gt; Another interesting find associated with one of the coffins at Deir el-Balah was a makeup spoon in the shape of a diving woman.&lt;ref&gt;[The Cemetery at Deir el-Balah, 1973, p. 48]&lt;/ref&gt; This is a common motif found in Egyptian art of the New Kingdom period. One of the more important small finds associated with the coffins from all sites they were found at are [[scarabs]]. Scarabs bearing imagery and the [[cartouches]] of New Kingdom Pharaohs, including one of [[Rameses II]], have been found in context with most of the coffins and suggest that the people buried in the coffins were possibly Egyptian officials.&lt;ref&gt;[Life in Judah from the Perspective of the Dead, p. 125]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusion==
Most of the information known about these burials has been taken from the associated finds due to the lack of written evidence. Only on two occasions was there writing associated with the burials; one, a badly preserved funerary stele lining a grave at Deir el-Balah and two, a coffin lid from Lachish that had poorly written and preserved hieroglyphs on it.&lt;ref&gt;[Archaeology of the Land of the Bible, p. 285 ]&lt;/ref&gt; There are still some mysteries associated with these burials, one being sets of ''stone'' and ''bone pellets'' found inside many of the coffins.&lt;ref&gt;[The Cemetery at Deir el-Balah, 1973, p. 98]&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the pellets has yet to be discovered. The biggest unknown still surrounding these coffins, that the offerings have helped to unravel, is who were the coffins made for. Scholars have suggested they are for Egyptians, Canaanites imitating the Egyptians, and the Philistines.&lt;ref&gt;[Archaeology of the Land of the Bible, p. 327]&lt;/ref&gt; From the dates associated with the finds, it appears that the coffins originated with Egyptians and Egyptian influence in Canaan and then was adopted by the Philistines later.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5779">[[Image:Rindenmulch016.JPG|thumb|right|Barkdust]]
In [[agriculture]], [[gardening]], and [[landscaping]], '''barkdust''' (also '''bark dust''', '''bark chips''', '''bark mulch''', or '''beauty bark''') is a form of [[mulch]] produced out of chipped or shredded [[tree]] [[Bark (botany)|bark]].  Coarser forms of barkdust may be known as '''bark nuggets'''.  Trees typically used in the production of barkdust include the [[Douglas fir]] and the [[Western hemlock]].

==Production and types of barkdust==

Barkdust is commonly produced from several tree species.  The [[Douglas fir]] and the [[Western hemlock]] are the most common sources of barkdust, with [[Cedar wood|cedar]] bark also being used.  Barkdust may be a byproduct of [[lumber]] production, of [[Source Separated Organics|yard debris]] recycling processes, or it may be produced in its own right.  Barkdust is typically categorized by the source plant, as well as by the coarseness of the resulting material.  Fine barkdusts are used as [[mulch]], with coarser forms being used for weed control, as a [[playground]] surface, or for decorative purposes. 

According to voluntary guidelines published by the [[Mulch and Soil Council]], a trade group of mulch and soil producers, a material with "bark" in the name should consist of "the corky exterior covering of trees, with a maximum wood content (interior [[xylem]] of 15%)".   Products with greater than 15% wood content may be labelled as "wood mulch", but should not be called "bark", according to the group's guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fresh fir bark is reddish-brown in color.  The bark from cedar or hemlock is more tan in color, as the processes which produce these types of barkdust may leave a greater percentage of wood (as opposed to bark) in the resulting material.  Shredded Douglas fir bark is known for lots of slivers, those who handle it with bare hands or walk on it with bare feet are likely to get [[splinter]]s.  Bark produced from hemlock or cedar is far less likely to produce splinters, and is commonly used as a covering for children's play areas.

==Properties and uses==

Like many other types of [[mulch]], barkdust is used in gardening and landscaping for its properties in affecting soil [[pH]], in regulating the temperature of the underlying soil, 
and preventing water loss and erosion.

Barkdust increases soil acidity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to grow dahlias|publisher=Pleasant Valley Glads and Dahlias|accessdate=2007-08-06|url=http://www.gladiola.com/dahlias.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629114653/http://www.gladiola.com/dahlias.htm|archivedate=2007-06-29|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the decomposition of barkdust consumes [[nitrogen]], especially when fine bark mulch is mixed in with soil; coarser barkdust laid on top of soil will extract nitrogen at a much slower rate.  Barkdust is also effective at absorbing water and preventing water loss due to evaporation.

Barkdust is commonly used in landscaping around trees or shrubs.  It is especially common in the [[Pacific Northwest]] where the tree species used to produce it are native.  Barkdust is valued for its effectiveness at suppressing [[weed]]s; tree bark contains natural [[herbicide]]s{{cn|date=February 2017}}. In addition, many consider barkdust to be visually appealing{{citation needed |date=July 2014}}.

As barkdust is less dense than other types of soil or mulch, and doesn't compress a great deal, it is often considerably softer than bare earth.  As a result, it also finds applications as a [[playground]] surface.  For playground applications, hemlock or cedar bark is most commonly used, as fir bark frequently produces [[splinter]]s when handled by or trod upon with bare skin.

===Commerce in barkdust===

Barkdust is typically sold by the '''unit''', with one unit of barkdust being equal to 200&amp;nbsp;cubic&amp;nbsp;feet (7.41&amp;nbsp;cubic&amp;nbsp;yards, or 5.66&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;); such large quantities of barkdust are typically delivered by truck to a jobsite.  Barkdust is often spread with a [[bark blower]], a machine consisting of a supply of barkdust, a blower, and a long flexible tube which "sprays" the barkdust over the intended area.  Use of a bark blower often results in a more consistent application of barkdust than spreading it by hand, as well as being much faster.

Smaller quantities of barkdust, typically 2&amp;ndash;3&amp;nbsp;cubic&amp;nbsp;feet, are sold prepackaged in [[home improvement]] and [[gardening]] [[retailer]]s.

For landscaping applications, a layer of 2"&amp;ndash;3"&amp;nbsp;(5&amp;nbsp;cm&amp;ndash;7.5&amp;nbsp;cm) is generally recommended.  For use in playgrounds, a 12"&amp;nbsp;(30&amp;nbsp;cm) layer is often recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Caribbean Plate''' is a mostly [[oceanic crust|oceanic]] [[tectonic plate]] underlying [[Central America]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]] off the north coast of [[South America]].

Roughly 3.2 million square kilometers (1.2 million square miles) in area, the Caribbean Plate borders the [[North American Plate]], the [[South American Plate]], the [[Nazca Plate]] and the [[Cocos Plate]].  These borders are regions of intense [[seismology|seismic]] activity, including frequent [[earthquake]]s, occasional [[tsunami]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Boundary types==
The northern boundary with the North American plate is a [[transform boundary|transform or strike-slip boundary]] which runs from the border area of [[Belize]], [[Guatemala]] ([[Motagua Fault]]), and [[Honduras]] in Central America, eastward through the [[Cayman Trench|Cayman trough]] along the [[Swan Islands Transform Fault]] before joining the southern boundary of the [[Gonâve Microplate]]. East of the [[Mid-Cayman Rise]] this continues as the [[Walton fault zone]] and the [[Enriquillo–Plantain Garden fault zone]] into eastern [[Hispaniola]]. From there it continues into [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[Virgin Islands]].  Part of the [[Puerto Rico Trench]], the deepest part of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] (roughly 8,400 meters), lies along this border. The Puerto Rico trench is at a complex transition from the subduction boundary to the south and the transform boundary to the west.

The eastern boundary is a [[subduction zone]], the [[Lesser Antilles subduction zone]], where oceanic crust of the South American Plate is being subducted under the Caribbean Plate.   Subduction forms the volcanic islands of the [[Lesser Antilles Volcanic Arc]] from the Virgin Islands in the north to the islands off the coast of [[Venezuela]] in the south. This boundary contains seventeen active volcanoes, most notably [[Soufrière Hills volcano|Soufriere Hills]] on [[Montserrat]]; [[Mount Pelée]] on [[Martinique]]; [[La Grande Soufrière]] on [[Guadeloupe]]; [[Soufrière (volcano)|Soufrière Saint Vincent]] on [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]]; and the submarine volcano [[Kick 'em Jenny]] which lies about 10&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Grenada]]. Large historical earthquakes in 1839 and 1843 in this region are possibly megathrust earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An Earthquake Catalogue for the Eastern Caribbean 1530–1960 |first=G.

This boundary is in part the result of transform faulting along with [[thrust fault]]ing and some subduction. The rich Venezuelan [[petroleum]] fields possibly result from this complex plate interaction. The Caribbean plate is moving eastward about 22 millimeters per year in relation to the South American plate.&lt;ref&gt;Deiros D (2000) [Determination of Displacement Between Caribbean and South American plates in Venezuela using Global Positioning System (GPS) data.] Geological Code of Venezuela. {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pérez OJ, Bilham R, Bendick R, Hernández N, Hoyer M, Velandia J, Moncayo C y Kozuch M (2001) Relative velocity between the Caribbean and South America plates from observations Within the Global Positioning System (GPS) in northern Venezuela.{{es}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Venezuela much of the movement between the Caribbean Plate and the South American plate occurs along the faults of [[Boconó Fault|Boconó]], [[El Pilar Fault System|El Pilar]] and [[San Sebastian Fault|San Sebastián]].&lt;ref name=Aude1996/&gt;

The western portion of the plate is occupied by Central America. The [[Cocos Plate]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]] is subducted beneath the Caribbean Plate, just off the western coast of Central America.  This subduction forms the volcanoes of [[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[Costa Rica]], also known as the [[Central America Volcanic Arc]].

==Origin==
The usual theory as to the origin of the Caribbean Plate was confronted by a contrasting theory in 2002.

The mainstream theory holds that it is the [[Caribbean large igneous province]] (CLIP) which formed in the Pacific Ocean tens of millions of years ago. As the Atlantic Ocean widened, North America and South America were pushed westward, separated for a time by oceanic crust.&lt;ref name="GeolSocLond09"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Origin and Evolution of the Caribbean Plate | publisher=The [[Geological Society of London]] | url=http://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/328/1/local/front-matter.pdf | author=James, K.H., Lorente, M.A. and Pindfell, J.L. (editors) | year=2009 | location=London | isbn=978-1-86239-288-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pacific Ocean floor subducted under this oceanic crust between the continents. The CLIP drifted into the same area, but as it was less dense and thicker than the surrounding oceanic crust, it did not subduct, but rather overrode the ocean floor, continuing to move eastward relative to North America and South America.  With the formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] 3 million years ago, it ultimately lost its connection to the Pacific.

The more recent theory asserts that the Caribbean Plate came into being from an [[Atlantic]] hotspot which no longer exists.  This theory points to evidence of the absolute motion of the Caribbean Plate which indicates that it moves westward, not east, and that its apparent eastward motion is only relative to the motions of the [[North American Plate]] and the [[South American Plate]].&lt;ref name="Meschede"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meschede|first=M.|author2=Frisch W.|title=Caribbean Geology: Into the Third Millenium : Transactions of the Fifteenth Caribbean Geological Conference|editor=Jackson T.

==First American land bridge==
The Caribbean Plate began its eastward migration {{Mya|80}} (Ma) during the Late Cretaceous.  This migration eventually resulted in a [[volcanic arc]] stretching from north-western South America to the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], today represented by the [[Las Aves archipelago|Aves Islands]] and the [[Lesser Antilles|Lesser]] and [[Greater Antilles]].  This arc was the subject of constant tectonism and sea-level fluctuations but lasted until the mid-Eocene and intermittently formed a [[land bridge]] along the eastern and northern boundaries of the Caribbean Plate.&lt;ref name="Marshall-etal"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1=Marshall|first1=L.G.|last2=Sempere|first2=T.|last3=Butler|first3=R.F.|title=Chronostratigraphy of the Mammal-Bearing Paleocene of South America|year=1997|journal=Journal of South American Earth Sciences|volume=10|issue=1|page=63|url=http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_7/b_fdi_57-58/010024186.pdf|doi=10.1016/S0895-9811(97)00005-9|ref=harv|bibcode=1997JSAES..10...49M }} &lt;!-- {{Harvnb|Marshall|Sempere|Butler|1997}} --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (What would eventually become present-day Central America, part of the western plate boundary, was still isolated in the Pacific.)

{{Mya|58.5|56.5|Ma}}, during the [[Late Paleocene]], a local sea-level low-stand assisted by the continental uplift of the western margin of South America, resulted in a fully operative land bridge over which several groups of mammals apparently took part in an interchange.  For example, [[xenarthra]]ns are known from the [[Itaboraian]] stage of the [[South American Land Mammal Age | South American Land Mammal Age (SALMA)]] (59–57 Ma), palaeanodonts from the [[Tiffanian]] [[North American Land Mammal Age |North American Land Mammal Age (NALMA)]] (57 Ma) and ''[[Eurotamandua]]'' from the early middle [[Eocene]] (50 Ma) of Europe; [[opossum]]s are known from the [[Tiupampan]]/Itaboraian SALMA (64–57 Ma), from the [[Clarkforkian]] NALMA (55 Ma); and from the [[Ypresian]] in Europe (55 Ma).&lt;ref name="Marshall-etal" /&gt;

==Great American Interchange==
The [[Great American Interchange]] in which land and freshwater [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] migrated between North America and South America via the uplifted western margin of the Caribbean Plate ([[Central America]]) was a later event, which peaked dramatically around three million years ([[Year#SI prefix multipliers|Ma]]) ago during the [[Piacenzian]] age.

'''Children's geographies''' is an area of study within [[human geography]] and [[Childhood studies]] which involves researching the places and spaces of children's lives.

==Context==
Children's geographies is the branch of human geography which deals with the study of places and spaces of children's lives, characterised experientially, politically and ethically.

Ever since the cultural turn in geography, there has been recognition that society is not homogenous but heterogeneous. It is characterized by diversity, differences and subjectivities. While feminist geographers had been able to strengthen the need for examination of gender, class and race as issues affecting women, 'children' as an umbrella term encompassing children, teenagers, youths and young people, which are still relatively missing a 'frame of reference' in the complexities of 'geographies'. In the act of theorizing children and their geographies, the ways of doing research and the assumed ontological realities often "frame 'children' and 'adults' in ways that impose a bi-polar, hierarchical, and developmental model". This reproduces and enforces the hegemony of adult-centered discourses of children within knowledge production. Children's geographies has developed in academic human geography since the beginning of the 1990s, although there were notable studies in the area before that date. The earliest work done on children's geographies largely can be traced to [[William Bunge]]'s work on spatial oppression of children in Detroit and Toronto where children are deemed as the ones who suffer the most under an oppressing adult framework of social, cultural and political forces controlling the urban built environment.

This development emerged from the realisation that previously human geography had largely ignored the everyday lives of children, who (obviously) form a significant section of [[society]], and who have specific needs and capacities, and who may experience the world in very different ways. Thus children's geographies can in part be seen in parallel to an interest in [[gender]] in [[geography]] and [[feminist geography]] in so much as their starting points were the gender blindness of mainstream academic geography. Children's geographies also shares many of the underpinning principles of [[Childhood Studies]] (and the so-called New Social Studies of Childhood) and [[Sociology of the family]] - namely, that childhood is a social construction and that scholars should pay greater attention to children's voices and agency, although recent 'new wave' scholarship has challenged these principles (Kraftl, 2013)&lt;ref name="Kraftl 13–23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kraftl|first=Peter|date=2013-11-01|title=Beyond ‘voice’, beyond ‘agency’, beyond ‘politics’? Hybrid childhoods and some critical reflections on children's emotional geographies|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755458613000054|journal=Emotion, Space and Society|series=Children's Emotional Geographies|volume=9|pages=13–23|doi=10.1016/j.emospa.2013.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children's geographies rests on the idea that children as a social group share certain characteristics which are experientially,  politically and ethically significant and which are worthy of study. The pluralisation in the title is intended to imply that children's lives will be markedly different in differing times and places and in differing circumstances such as gender, [[family]], and [[social class|class]].The current developments in children's geographies are attempting to link the frame of analysing children's geographies to one that requires multiple perspectives and the willingness to acknowledge the 'multiplicity' of their geographies.

Children's geographies is sometimes coupled with, and yet distinguished from the geographies of childhood. The former has an interest in the everyday lives of children; the latter has an interest in how (adult) society conceives of the very idea of childhood and how this impinges on children's lives in many ways. This includes imaginations about the nature of children and the related (spatial) implications. In an early article, Holloway and Valentine termed these 'spatial discourses' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holloway|first=Sarah L.|last2=Valentine|first2=Gill|date=2000-01-01|title=Spatiality and the New Social Studies of Childhood|journal=Sociology|volume=34|issue=4|pages=763–783|doi=10.1017/s0038038500000468|jstor=42856231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children’s geographies can be observed through the various lenses provided by foci, thus the plurality inspired by post-modern and post-structural social geographers (Panelli, 2009).&lt;ref name="Panelli, 2009"&gt;[http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=baf32734-ce2a-4c53-a853-a46684a2b4fa%40sessionmgr12&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=12&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=39053680], Panelli, 2009. Approaches to Human Geography.&lt;/ref&gt; These focii include, but are not limited to: the history of its emergence (key authors and texts), the nature of the child (geographical concepts, family contexts, society contexts, gender variation, aged-based variation, cultural variation), children in the environment (home, school, play, neighbourhood, street, city, country, landscapes of consumption, cyberspace), designing environments for children (children as planners, utopian visions), environmental hazards (traffic, health and environment, accidents), indirect experience of place (not medium specific, literature, T.V. and cyberspace), social issues (children’s fears, parent’s fears for their children, poverty and deprivation, work, migration, social hazards, crime and deviance), citizenship and agency (environmental action, local politics, interest in the environment), and children’s geographical knowledge (environmental cognition, understanding the physical environment) (McKendrick, 2000).&lt;ref name="McKendrick, 2000"&gt;[http://chd.sagepub.com/content/7/3/359], McKendrick, 2000. The Geography of Children - An Annotated Bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the methodologies of researching children's worlds and the ethics of doing so has been distinguished by the [[otherness of childhood]].

There is now a journal dedicated to work in the subdiscipline: Children's Geographies&lt;ref&gt;[http://journalsonline.tandf.co.uk/openurl.asp?genre=journal&amp;issn=1473-3285 Journal of Children's Geographies]&lt;/ref&gt; which will give readers a good idea of the growing range of issues, theories and methodologies of this developing and vibrant sub-discipline. Another relevant journal is Children, Youth and Environments,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/action/showPublication?journalCode=chilyoutenvi CYE Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; published as an interdisciplinary tri-annual with a worldwide readership.

=== Theoretical trends in children's geographies ===
For some years, critics argued that scholarship in children's geographies was characterised by a lack of theoretical diversity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horton|first=John|last2=Kraftl|first2=Peter|date=2005-08-01|title=For more-than-usefulness: Six overlapping points about Children's Geographies|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14733280500161503|journal=Children's Geographies|volume=3|issue=2|pages=131–143|doi=10.1080/14733280500161503|issn=1473-3285}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 'block politics'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2004-08-01|title=Editorial: from dismissals and disciplinary inclusions; from block politics to panic rooms|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14733280410001720485|journal=Children's Geographies|volume=2|issue=2|pages=171–175|doi=10.1080/14733280410001720485|issn=1473-3285}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the mid-2000s, the subdiscipline has seen a proliferation and diversification of theoretical work away from the social constructivist principles of childhood studies and the New Social Studies of Childhood.

Recently, there has been vibrant debate about the political value of nonrepresentational approaches to childhood. Some scholars argue that nonrepresentational theories encourage a focus upon the banal, everyday, ephemeral and small-scale at the expense of understanding and critically interrogating wider-scaled and longer-standing processes of marginalisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Katharyne|last2=Elwood|first2=Sarah|date=2012-01-01|title=Mapping children’s politics: the promise of articulation and the limits of nonrepresentational theory|url=http://epd.sagepub.com/lookup/doi/10.1068/d9011|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|language=en|volume=30|issue=5|pages=788–804|doi=10.1068/d9011|pmc=4307017|pmid=25635154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ansell|first=N.|date=2008-08-28|title=Childhood and the politics of scale: descaling children's geographies?|url=http://phg.sagepub.com/cgi/doi/10.1177/0309132508090980|journal=Progress in Human Geography|language=en|volume=33|issue=2|pages=190–209|doi=10.1177/0309132508090980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that, whilst valid, nonrepresentational and 'new wave' approaches extend beyond the small-scale, offering useful and in some cases fundamental ways to critically and creatively re-think the ways that we do research with children and their 'common worlds'.&lt;ref name="Kraftl 13–23"/&gt;

A second key conceptual trend has been in work on [[Subjectivity]], children's [[Political geography]] and emotion. For instance, Louise Holt (2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holt|first=Louise|date=2013-01-01|title=Exploring the emergence of the subject in power: infant geographies|url=http://epd.sagepub.com/lookup/doi/10.1068/d12711|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|language=en|volume=31|issue=4|pages=645–663|doi=10.1068/d12711}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses the work of [[Judith Butler]] to critically examine the emergence of the infant as a 'subject' through power relations that are often gendered, as well as infanthood is a stage in the lifecourse that is subject to particular kinds of social construction. Elsewhere, there has been a surge in interest in children's political geographies, which has to some extent been informed both by developments in nonrepresentational theory and in theories of subjectivity. Central to this scholarship (especially in the work of Tracey Skelton,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skelton|first=Tracey|date=2013-04-01|title=Young People, Children, Politics and Space: A Decade of Youthful Political Geography Scholarship 2003–13|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13562576.2013.780717|journal=Space and Polity|volume=17|issue=1|pages=123–136|doi=10.1080/13562576.2013.780717|issn=1356-2576}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirsi Pauliina Kallio&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kallio|first=Kirsi Pauliina|last2=Häkli|first2=Jouni|date=2013-04-01|title=Children and Young People's Politics in Everyday Life|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13562576.2013.780710|journal=Space and Polity|volume=17|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1080/13562576.2013.780710|issn=1356-2576}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jouni Hakli) has been a move beyond a traditional concern with children's participation in decision-making processes to highlight the range of ways in which they may be 'political' - from 'micropolitical' engagements with ethnic or social in the school or the street to critical considerations of major policy documents such as the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]].

== Children in the environment ==
Since the age range assumed to constitute as childhood is quite vague within the cumulative research of children’s geographies it is evident the multitude of environments they experience will be quite broad. The array of spaces and places experienced by children includes, but are not restricted to, homes, schools, playgrounds, neighbourhoods, streets, cities, countries, landscapes of consumption, and cyberspace. As environment has been noted by a multitude of social geographers to entail a socio-spatial aspect, it is important to note that over time the recognition of the multiplicity of the term “environment” has both diverged and converged as social geography has evolved (Valentine, 2001; Bowlby, 2001).&lt;ref name="Valentine, 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/002919501753129925 | volume=55 | title=Whatever happened to the social?

=== Children at school ===
Although schools are such a relatively large institution in society, it has been noted that this environment has received little recognition in comparison to institutions of health (Collins and Coleman, 2008).&lt;ref name="Collins and Coleman, 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1749-8198.2007.00081.x | volume=2 | title=Social Geographies of Education: Looking Within, and Beyond, School Boundaries | year=2008 | journal=Geography Compass | pages=281–299 | last1 = Collins | first1 = Damian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collins and Coleman also note the centrality of schools in everyday life as they are “found in almost every urban and suburban neighbourhood” and most children experience a considerable time within this environment in their day-to-day lives. The role of this environment in a child’s life is pivotal to their development, especially in respects to the inclusionary and exclusionary processes of society experienced firsthand in schools (MacCrae, Maguire and Milbourne, 2002).&lt;ref name="MacCrae, Maguire and Milbourne, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/13603110304785 | volume=7 | title=Social exclusion: exclusion from school | year=2003 | journal=International Journal of Inclusive Education | pages=89–101 | last1 = Macrae | first1 = Sheila}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manifestation of social exclusion as bullying is an inter-personal socio-spatial aspect whose implications have been extensively researched both within school boundaries and how it is enabled by technology (Olweus and Limber, 2010; Black, Washington, Trent, Harner and Pollock, 2009).&lt;ref name="Olweus and Limber, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1939-0025.2010.01015.x | volume=80 | title=Bullying in school: Evaluation and dissemination of the Olweus Bullying Prevention Program. | year=2010 | journal=American Journal of Orthopsychiatry | pages=124–134 | last1 = Olweus | first1 = Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Black, Washington, Trent, Harner and Pollock, 2009"&gt;[http://hpp.sagepub.com/content/11/5/733], Black, Washington, Trent, Harner and Pollock, 2009. Translating the Olweus Bullying Prevention Program Into Real-World Practice.&lt;/ref&gt; School, therefore, is not only a place where children learn quantifiable subjects, but also a learning ground of life interaction skills needed later on.

Research in children's geographies has been central to the development of scholarship on 'geographies of education'. For many commentators, this work - which spans [[Social geography]], [[Cultural geography]], [[Political geography]] and [[Urban geography]] - does not (yet) constitute an identifiable subdiscipline of human geography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thiem|first=C. H.|date=2008-08-28|title=Thinking through education: the geographies of contemporary educational restructuring|url=http://phg.sagepub.com/cgi/doi/10.1177/0309132508093475|journal=Progress in Human Geography|language=en|volume=33|issue=2|pages=154–173|doi=10.1177/0309132508093475}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, geographers have held an enduring concern with education spaces, extending to and beyond school, as Collins and Coleman identify.

(2010) argue,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holloway|first=S.

As they argue, children's geographers have not only undertaken a huge range of research in schools, but that work has been central in developing geographers' understandings of both education spaces more widely, and schools in particular.

==== As an institution ====
Although schools are a relatively large institution in society, it has been noted that this environment has received little recognition in comparison to institutions of health (Collins and Coleman, 2008).&lt;ref name="Collins and Coleman, 2008" /&gt; Collins and Coleman also note the centrality of schools in everyday life as they are “found in almost ''every'' urban and suburban neighbourhood” and most children experience a considerable time within this environment in their day-to-day lives. The implications of home schooling have largely been a field of assumptions, taking after common myths (Romanowki, 2010),&lt;ref name="Romanowski, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3200/TCHS.79.3.125-129 | volume=79 | title=Revisiting the Common Myths about Homeschooling | year=2006 | journal=The Clearing House: A Journal of Educational Strategies, Issues and Ideas | pages=125–129 | last1 = Romanowski | first1 = Michael H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; although later work by geographers has examined in considerable detail the significance of space, place. emotion and materiality to the experiences of homeschoolers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kraftl|first=Peter|date=2013-07-01|title=Towards geographies of ‘alternative’ education: a case study of UK home schooling families|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-5661.2012.00536.x/abstract|journal=Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers|language=en|volume=38|issue=3|pages=436–450|doi=10.1111/j.1475-5661.2012.00536.x|issn=1475-5661}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The variance between public and private sector institutions and the implications of social status of children within the school community has also been a contentious field (Nissan and Carter, 2010).&lt;ref name="Nissan and Carter, 2010"&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/b625160263r4245m/], Nissan and Carter, 2010. Social Identity and Schooling Idequality.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst the majority of research by children's and youth geographers on education has focussed on institutions like schools and universities,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holton|first=Mark|last2=Riley|first2=Mark|date=2016-07-03|title=Student geographies and homemaking: personal belonging(s) and identities|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14649365.2015.1126626|journal=Social &amp; Cultural Geography|volume=17|issue=5|pages=623–645|doi=10.1080/14649365.2015.1126626|issn=1464-9365}}&lt;/ref&gt; that work has been challenged in a number of ways by scholarship on the geographies of alternative education. Examining a diverse range of non-State-funded, explicitly 'alternative' education spaces in the UK (like [[Homeschooling]], [[Waldorf education]], [[Montessori education]], [[Forest school (learning style)]] and [[Care farming]]), Peter Kraftl examines the connections and disconnections between 'mainstream' and 'alternative' education sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://policypress.co.uk/geographies-of-alternative-education-1|title=Policy Press {{!}} Geographies of alternative education - Diverse learning spaces for children and young people By Peter Kraftl|website=Policy Press|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on nonrepresentational children's geographies, Peter Kraftl explores how alternative educators work to intervene into children's bodily habits, how they create spaces in which mess and disorder are valorised, and how they work with conceptions of 'nature' that both resonate with and, critically, counter mainstream assumptions about children's disengagement with 'nature' in Western societies (see [[Nature deficit disorder]]). In doing so, alternative educators are attempting to create 'alter-childhoods' - alternative constructions, imaginations and ways of treating childhood that are knowingly different from a perceived mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kraftl|first=Peter|date=2015-01-02|title=Alter-Childhoods: Biopolitics and Childhoods in Alternative Education Spaces|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00045608.2014.962969|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|volume=105|issue=1|pages=219–237|doi=10.1080/00045608.2014.962969|issn=0004-5608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Relevance to social interactions ====
As children grow they look to the influential adults in their lives for guidance (parents, caregivers and teachers). Most researchers and adults alike agree that communication is key to healthy child development across all modal environments, especially within schools (Lasky, 2000; Hargreaves, 2000; Hargreaves and Fullan, 1998; Hargreaves and Lasky, 2004).&lt;ref name="Lasky, 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0742051X00000305 | doi=10.1016/S0742-051X(00)00030-5 | volume=16 | title=The cultural and emotional politics of teacher–parent interactions | year=2000 | journal=Teaching and Teacher Education | pages=843–860 | last1 = Lasky | first1 = Sue}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hargreaves, 2000"&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02754066], Hargreaves, 2000. Professionals and Parents: Personal Adversaries or Public Allies?&lt;/ref&gt; Lasky's focus remains on the cultural and emotional dynamic between teachers and the parents of their students. Where as Hargreaves continuously exemplifies through his data the significant improvement in child performance at school because of an equal power-play communication between teachers and parents/caregivers. Where there may be a lack of influential adults, children may look to older age groups within the school environment to observe acceptable behaviours and [[attention seeking]] behaviours. Research has begun to display the components of the “high quality experience” provided by controlled school-based mentoring relationships (Ahrens et al. 2011). However, other research disputes that the experience is as helpful as it claims to be, suggesting child-mentoring situations often fall short or are only temporarily beneficial (Spencer, 2007; Pryce, 2012).&lt;ref name="Pryce, 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10560-012-0260-6 | volume=29 | title=Mentor Attunement: An Approach to Successful School-based Mentoring Relationships | year=2012 | journal=Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal | pages=285–305 | last1 = Pryce | first1 = Julia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pryce’s research highlights the attunement of the mentor to the other’s needs highly dictates the beneficial nature of the mentor relationship.

==== Relevance of technology ====
The introduction of technology into children’s lives has provided a new platform upon which the school environment is no longer contained within a space. The place’s previous temporal and geographical constrictions have been mobilized by the used of the Internet. The outcomes of this mobilization have both been constructive and destructive in the availability of material to learning children (Sancho, 2004)&lt;ref name="Sancho, 2004"&gt;[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F1-4020-2495-9_10], Virtual Geographies of Educational Change: The More Complex the Problems the Simpler the Answers.&lt;/ref&gt; and more extrapersonal interactions among children. The educational benefit of I.C.T. (Interactive Computer Technology) in the classroom has been a subject supported by various researchers (Aviram and Talmi, 2004).

==== Relevance to the creation of social identities ====
The school is an institution in which children observe one another and experiment continuously with their self-image (Hernandez, 2004).&lt;ref name="Hernandez, 2004"&gt;[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F1-4020-2495-9_7], Hernandez, 2004. Mapping Visual Cultural Narratives to Explore Adolescents' Identities.&lt;/ref&gt; Hernandez’s research recognized a need to recognize children as individuals, and to incorporate their “personal maps” into the educational process, so the gap between the school environment and external environment does not elevate dangerously. The centrality of schools to social geography is pivotal. Public institutions in Canada and the USA were defined as “nation-building institutions, which sought to create common citizens from ethnically, linguistically and religiously diverse populations” (Moore, 2000; Sweet, 1997). The connection between nation-building and public education has held the view that schools shape the knowledge and identities of children (Collins and Coleman, 2008).&lt;ref name="Collins and Coleman, 2008" /&gt; Whether the connection is seen to create negative, destructive social norms or positive, construction of progressive values is dependent “on one’s broader political/moral compass” (Collins, 2006; Hunter 1991).

==Etymology==
[[File:Geology of Cyprus-SkiriotissaMine.jpg|thumb|right|A copper mine in Cyprus. In antiquity, Cyprus was a major source of copper.]]
The earliest attested reference to ''Cyprus'' is the 15th century BC [[Mycenaean Greek]] {{lang|gmy|𐀓𐀠𐀪𐀍}}, ''ku-pi-ri-jo'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Strange|first=John|title=Caphtor : Keftiu : a new investigation|year=1980|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=978-90-04-06256-6|page=167|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c9QUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA154}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "Cypriot" (Greek: {{lang|grc|Κύπριος}}), written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palaeolexicon.com/ Palaeolexicon], Word study tool of ancient languages&lt;/ref&gt;
The classical Greek form of the name is {{lang|grc|Κύπρος}} (''Kýpros'').

The etymology of the name is unknown.
Suggestions include:
* the Greek word for the [[Cupressus|Mediterranean cypress tree]] (''[[Cupressus sempervirens]]''), κυπάρισσος (''kypárissos'')
* the Greek name of the [[Lawsonia inermis|henna tree]] (''Lawsonia alba''), κύπρος (''kýpros'')
* an [[Eteocypriot]] word for [[copper]]. It has been suggested, for example, that it has roots in the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] word for copper (''zubar'') or for [[bronze]] (''kubar''), from the large deposits of copper ore found on the island.&lt;ref name=Beekes/&gt;

Through overseas trade, the island has given its name to the [[Classical Latin]] word for copper through the phrase ''aes Cyprium'', "metal of Cyprus", later shortened to ''Cuprum''.&lt;ref name=Beekes&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 805 (''s.v.'' "Κύπρος").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Fred H. ''Cyprus: Our New Colony And What We Know About It''. London: George Routledge and Sons, 1878, pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard [[demonym]] relating to Cyprus or its people or culture is ''[[Cypriot (disambiguation)|Cypriot]]''. The terms ''Cypriote'' and ''Cyprian'' are also used, though less frequently.

The revolt was suppressed, but Cyprus managed to maintain a high degree of autonomy and remained oriented towards the Greek world.&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov" /&gt;

The island was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]] in 333&amp;nbsp;BC. Following his death and the subsequent [[Partition of Babylon|division of his empire]] and [[Wars of the Diadochi|wars among his successors]], Cyprus became part of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic empire]] of [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]]. It was during this period that the island was fully [[Hellenization|Hellenized]]. In 58&amp;nbsp;BC Cyprus was acquired by the [[Roman Republic]].&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov" /&gt;

===Middle Ages===
{{Main|Cyprus in the Middle Ages|Kingdom of Cyprus}}
[[File:Nicosia by Giacomo Franco.jpg|thumb|The [[Walls of Nicosia]] were built by the Venetians to defend the city in case of an Ottoman attack]]
[[File:Kyrenia 01-2017 img11 Castle exterior.jpg|thumb|[[Kyrenia Castle]] was originally built by the Byzantines and enlarged by the Venetians]]
When the [[Roman Empire]] was divided into Eastern and Western parts in 395, Cyprus became part of the East Roman, or [[Byzantine Empire]], and would remain so until the [[Crusades]] some 800 years later. Under Byzantine rule, the Greek orientation that had been prominent since antiquity developed the strong Hellenistic-Christian character that continues to be a hallmark of the Greek Cypriot community.&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov" /&gt;

Beginning in 649, Cyprus endured several attacks launched by raiders from the [[Levant]], which continued for the next 300 years.{{Citation needed|reason=reference no longer found at former web-address: (lcweb2.loc.gov)|date=June 2018}} Many were quick piratical raids, but others were large-scale attacks in which many Cypriots were slaughtered and great wealth carried off or destroyed.{{Citation needed|reason=reference no longer found at former web-address: (lcweb2.loc.gov)|date=June 2018}}

There are no Byzantine churches which survive from this period; thousands of people were killed, and many cities – such as [[Salamis, Cyprus|Salamis]] – were destroyed and never rebuilt.&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov" /&gt; Byzantine rule was restored in 965, when Emperor [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] scored decisive victories on land and sea.&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov" /&gt;

In 1191, during the [[Third Crusade]], [[Richard I of England]] captured the island from [[Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus]]&lt;ref&gt;Riddle, J.M. ''A History of the Middle Ages.'' Lanham, MD, USA: Rowman &amp; Littlefield 2008. p. 326. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rhWpPr93KjMC&amp;pg=PA326]&lt;/ref&gt; He used it as a major supply base that was relatively safe from the [[Saracen]]s. A year later Richard sold the island to the [[Knights Templar]], who, following a bloody revolt, in turn sold it to [[Guy of Lusignan]]. His brother and successor [[Aimery of Cyprus|Aimery]] was recognised as [[Kingdom of Cyprus|King of Cyprus]] by [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor]].&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov" /&gt;

Following the death in 1473 of [[James II of Cyprus|James II]], the last Lusignan king, the [[Republic of Venice]] assumed control of the island, while the late king's Venetian widow, Queen [[Catherine Cornaro]], reigned as figurehead. Venice formally annexed the [[Kingdom of Cyprus]] in 1489, following the abdication of Catherine.&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov" /&gt; The Venetians fortified [[Nicosia]] by building the [[Walls of Nicosia]], and used it as an important commercial hub. Throughout Venetian rule, the [[Ottoman Empire]] frequently raided Cyprus. In 1539 the Ottomans destroyed [[Limassol]] and so fearing the worst, the Venetians also fortified [[Famagusta]] and [[Kyrenia]].&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov" /&gt;

Although the Lusignan French aristocracy remained the dominant social class in Cyprus throughout the medieval period, the former assumption that Greeks were treated only as serfs on the island&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov" /&gt; is no longer considered by academics to be accurate. It is now accepted that the medieval period saw increasing numbers of Greek Cypriots elevated to the upper classes, a growing Greek [[middle class|middle ranks]],&lt;ref&gt;See James G. Schryver, 'Colonialism or Conviviencia in Frankish Cyprus?' in I.W.

The Ottomans abolished the [[feudal]] system previously in place and applied the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet system]] to Cyprus, under which non-Muslim peoples were governed by their own religious authorities. In a reversal from the days of Latin rule, the head of the [[Church of Cyprus]] was invested as leader of the Greek Cypriot population and acted as mediator between Christian Greek Cypriots and the Ottoman authorities. This status ensured that the Church of Cyprus was in a position to end the constant encroachments of the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.cy/mfa/Embassies/Embassy_Madrid.nsf/all/6A33D29D666143A6C1257A36002ECA14/$file/ChipreUnaVisionHistorica.pdf?openelement|title=Cyprus a Historical Overview (Chipre Una Visión Historica) |work=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Cyprus website |first=William |last=Mallinson |format=PDF |language=Spanish |accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ottoman rule of Cyprus was at times indifferent, at times oppressive, depending on the temperaments of the sultans and local officials, and the island began over 250 years of economic decline.&lt;ref name="Cyprus – OTTOMAN RULE"&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/cyprus/7.htm Cyprus – OTTOMAN RULE], ''U.S. Library of Congress''&lt;/ref&gt;

As soon as the [[Greek War of Independence]] broke out in 1821, several Greek Cypriots left for Greece to join the Greek forces.

===Cyprus under the British Empire===

[[File:Hosting the British flag at Nicosia.jpg|thumb|upright|Hoisting the British flag at Nicosia]]

In the aftermath of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]] and the [[Congress of Berlin]], Cyprus was [[Cyprus Convention|leased]] to the [[British Empire]] which de facto took over its administration in 1878 (though, in terms of sovereignty, Cyprus remained a ''[[de jure]]'' Ottoman territory until 5 November 1914, together with [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt and Sudan]])&lt;ref name="Lausanne-Egypt-Sudan-Cyprus"/&gt; in exchange for guarantees that Britain would use the island as a base to protect the Ottoman Empire against possible Russian aggression.&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov" /&gt;

[[File:Cypriot demonstration 1930.jpg|thumb|[[Greek Cypriots|Greek Cypriot]] demonstrations for [[Enosis]] (union with [[Greece]]) in 1930]]
The island would serve Britain as a key military base for its colonial routes. By 1906, when the Famagusta harbour was completed, Cyprus was a strategic naval outpost overlooking the [[Suez Canal]], the crucial main route to India which was then Britain's most important overseas possession. Following the outbreak of the [[First World War]] and the decision of the Ottoman Empire to join the war on the side of the [[Central Powers]], on 5 November 1914 the British Empire formally annexed Cyprus and declared the Ottoman ''[[Khedive|Khedivate]]'' of [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt and Sudan]] a [[Sultanate of Egypt|''Sultanate'' and British protectorate]].&lt;ref name="Lausanne-Egypt-Sudan-Cyprus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov" /&gt;

In 1915, Britain offered Cyprus to Greece, ruled by King [[Constantine I of Greece]], on condition that Greece join the war on the side of the British. The offer was declined. In 1923, under the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]], the nascent Turkish republic relinquished any claim to Cyprus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Xypolia|first=Ilia|title='Cypriot Muslims among Ottomans, Turks and British|journal=Bogazici Journal|year=2011|volume=25|issue=2|pages=109–120|url=http://www.bujournal.boun.edu.tr/docs/13330942935.pdf|accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1925 it was declared a British [[crown colony]].&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov" /&gt; Many Greek and Turkish Cypriots fought in the [[British Army]] during both [[world war]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Ertl, Alan W. |title= Toward an Understanding of Europe: A Political Economic Précis of Continental Integration |publisher= Universal-Publishers|year= 2008 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=X9PGRaZt-zcC | page = 418 |isbn= 978-1-59942-983-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=January 2015}} During the [[Second World War]], many enlisted in the [[Cyprus Regiment]].

The Greek Cypriot population, meanwhile, had become hopeful that the British administration would lead to ''enosis''. The idea of ''enosis'' was historically part of the ''[[Megali Idea]]'', a greater political ambition of a Greek state encompassing the territories with Greek inhabitants in the former Ottoman Empire, including Cyprus and [[Asia Minor]] with a capital in [[Constantinople]], and was actively pursued by the [[Cypriot Orthodox Church]], which had its members educated in Greece. These religious officials, together with Greek military officers and professionals, some of whom still pursued the ''[[Megali Idea]]'', would later found the guerrilla organisation ''Ethniki Organosis Kyprion Agoniston or'' National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters ([[EOKA]]).&lt;ref name="lindsay14"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ker-Lindsay|first1=James|title=The Cyprus Problem: What Everyone Needs to Know|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-975716-9|pages=14–5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xTL382g5sWwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#v=onepage|quote=They hoped that the transfer of administration would pave the way for the island to be united with Greece—an aspiration known as "enosis."

Nationalistic slogans centred on the idea that "Cyprus is Turkish" and the ruling party declared Cyprus to be a part of the Turkish homeland that was vital to its security. Upon realising the fact that the Turkish Cypriot population was only 20% of the islanders made annexation unfeasible, the national policy was changed to favour partition. The slogan "Partition or Death" was frequently used in Turkish Cypriot and Turkish protests starting in the late 1950s and continuing throughout the 1960s. Although after the Zürich and London conferences Turkey seemed to accept the existence of the Cypriot state and to distance itself from its policy of favouring the partition of the island, the goal of the Turkish and Turkish Cypriot leaders remained that of creating an independent Turkish state in the northern part of the island.&lt;ref name="(Ozkan)2012"&gt;{{cite book |author=Behlul (Behlul) Ozkan (Ozkan)|title=From the Abode of Islam to the Turkish Vatan: The Making of a National Homeland in Turkey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kCArlsRcHUMC&amp;pg=PA199|date=26 June 2012|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-18351-1|page=199|quote=In line with the nationalist rhetoric that "Cyprus is Turkish", Menderes predicated his declaration upon the geographic proximity between Cyprus and Anatolia, thereby defining "Cyprus as an extension of Anatolia".

On 16 August 1960, Cyprus attained independence after the [[Zürich and London Agreement]] between the United Kingdom, Greece and Turkey. Cyprus had a total population of 573,566; of whom 442,138 (77.1%) were Greeks, 104,320 (18.2%) Turks, and 27,108 (4.7%) others.&lt;ref name="countrystudies.us"&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/cyprus/21.htm Eric Solsten, ed. ''Cyprus: A Country Study''], Library of Congress, Washington, DC, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The UK retained the two [[Sovereign Base Areas]] of [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]], while government posts and public offices were allocated by ethnic quotas, giving the minority Turkish Cypriots a permanent veto, 30% in parliament and administration, and granting the three mother-states guarantor rights.

However, the division of power as foreseen by the constitution soon resulted in legal impasses and discontent on both sides, and nationalist militants started training again, with the military support of Greece and Turkey respectively. The Greek Cypriot leadership believed that the rights given to Turkish Cypriots under the 1960 constitution were too extensive and designed the [[Akritas plan]], which was aimed at reforming the constitution in favour of Greek Cypriots, persuading the international community about the correctness of the changes and violently subjugating Turkish Cypriots in a few days should they not accept the plan.&lt;ref name="country12"&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/cyprus/12.htm Eric Solsten, ed.

===Post-division===
[[File:Cy-map.png|thumb|upright=1.6|A map showing the division of Cyprus]]

After the restoration of constitutional order and the return of Archbishop Makarios III to Cyprus in December 1974, Turkish troops remained, occupying the northeastern portion of the island. In 1983, the Turkish Cypriot leader proclaimed the [[Northern Cyprus|Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] (TRNC), which is recognised only by Turkey.

The events of the summer of 1974 dominate the [[Cyprus dispute|politics]] on the island, as well as [[Greco-Turkish relations]]. Around 150,000 settlers from Turkey are believed to be living in the north—many of whom were forced from Turkey by the Turkish government—in violation of the [[Geneva Convention]] and various [[United Nations resolution|UN resolutions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_bF8n8DaQtoC |title=Documents (working papers) 1993 |publisher= Council of Europe|author= Council of Europe | isbn= 978-92-871-2262-9 | page= 1997 |year=1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=beVKwgOtME0C |title=Who shall govern Cyprus – Brussels or Nicosia? |publisher= Evandia Publishing UK Limited |author=Chrysafi, A.

[[File:Avakas Gorge (Cyprus).jpg|thumb|Avakas Gorge in Akamas]]

Cyprus is the third largest island in the Mediterranean Sea, after the Italian islands of [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]] (both in terms of area and population). It is also the [[List of islands by area|world's 80th largest by area]] and [[List of islands by population|world's 51st largest by population]]. It measures {{convert|240|km|mi|0}} long from end to end and {{convert|100|km|mi|0}} wide at its widest point, with Turkey {{convert|75|km|mi|0}} to the north. It lies between latitudes [[34th parallel north|34°]] and [[36th parallel north|36° N]], and longitudes [[32nd meridian east|32°]] and [[35th meridian east|35° E]].

Other neighbouring territories include Syria and Lebanon to the east ({{convert|105|and|108|km|mi|0}}, respectively), Israel {{convert|200|km|mi|0}} to the southeast, Egypt {{convert|380|km|mi|0}} to the south, and Greece to the northwest: {{convert|280|km|mi|0}} to the small [[Dodecanese|Dodecanesian]] island of [[Kastellorizo]] (Megisti), {{convert|400|km|mi|0}} to [[Rhodes]] and {{convert|800|km|mi|0}} to the Greek mainland.

The physical relief of the island is dominated by two mountain ranges, the [[Troodos Mountains]] and the smaller [[Kyrenia Mountains|Kyrenia Range]], and the central plain they encompass, the [[Mesaoria]]. The Mesaoria plain is drained by the [[Pedieos River]], the longest on the island. The Troodos Mountains cover most of the southern and western portions of the island and account for roughly half its area. The highest point on Cyprus is [[Mount Olympus (Cyprus)|Mount Olympus]] at {{convert|1952|m|abbr=on}}, located in the centre of the Troodos range. The narrow Kyrenia Range, extending along the northern coastline, occupies substantially less area, and elevations are lower, reaching a maximum of {{convert|1024|m|abbr=on}}. The island lies within the [[Anatolian Plate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdik|first1=Mustafa|title=Strong Ground Motion Seismology|date=2013|page=469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Petra tou romiou beach.jpg|thumb|[[Petra tou Romiou]] ("Rock of the Greek").]]
[[Geopolitics|Geopolitically]], the island is subdivided into four main segments. The Republic of Cyprus occupies the southern two-thirds of the island (59.74%). The [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] occupies the northern third (34.85%), and the United Nations-controlled [[Green Line (Cyprus)|Green Line]] provides a [[buffer zone]] that separates the two and covers 2.67% of the island. Lastly, [[Sovereign Base Areas|two bases under British sovereignty]] are located on the island: [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]], covering the remaining 2.74%.

[[File:Kouris Dam - overflow day 8 April 2012.jpg|thumb|[[Kouris Dam]] overflow in April 2012]]

Cyprus suffers from a chronic shortage of water. The country relies heavily on rain to provide household water, but in the past 30 years average yearly precipitation has decreased.&lt;ref name=meteo&gt;{{cite web |author1=Department of Meteorology|title=The Climate of Cyprus|url=http://www.moa.gov.cy/moa/MS/MS.nsf/DMLcyclimate_en/DMLcyclimate_en?OpenDocument|accessdate=8 August 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614000827/http://www.moa.gov.cy/moa/ms/ms.nsf/DMLcyclimate_en/DMLcyclimate_en?opendocument|archivedate=14 June 2015|quote="Statistical analysis of rainfall in Cyprus reveals a decreasing trend of rainfall amounts in the last 30-year[s]."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2001 and 2004, exceptionally heavy annual rainfall pushed water reserves up, with supply exceeding demand, allowing total storage in the island's reservoirs to rise to an all-time high by the start of 2005.
However, since then demand has increased annually – a result of local population growth, foreigners moving to Cyprus and the number of visiting tourists – while supply has fallen as a result of more frequent droughts.&lt;ref name=meteo /&gt;

Dams remain the principal source of water both for domestic and agricultural use; Cyprus has a total of 107 dams (plus one currently under construction) and reservoirs, with a total water storage capacity of about {{convert|330000000|m3|-9|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moa.gov.cy/moa/wdd/Wdd.nsf/All/F1C37F7EC2249715C2256CC50039DDD5?OpenDocument&amp;highlight=108%20dams Dams of Cyprus] Water Development Department, Republic of Cyprus.&lt;/ref&gt; Water [[desalination]] plants are gradually being constructed to deal with recent years of prolonged drought.
The Government has invested heavily in the creation of water desalination plants which have supplied almost 50 per cent of domestic water since 2001. Efforts have also been made to raise public awareness of the situation and to encourage domestic water users to take more responsibility for the conservation of this increasingly scarce commodity.

Turkey has built a water pipeline under the Mediterranean Sea from [[Anamur]] on its southern coast to the northern coast of Cyprus, to supply Northern Cyprus with potable and irrigation water ''(see [[Northern Cyprus Water Supply Project]])''.

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Cyprus|House of Representatives (Cyprus)}}
[[File:Parlanet cyprus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Presidential Palace, Nicosia]]]]
[[File:Nicos Anastasiades at EPP HQ.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Nicos Anastasiades]], President of Cyprus since 2013.]]
Cyprus is a [[presidential republic]]. The head of state and of the government is elected by a process of [[universal suffrage]] for a five-year term. Executive power is exercised by the government with legislative power vested in the House of Representatives whilst the Judiciary is independent of both the executive and the legislature.

The 1960 Constitution provided for a presidential system of government with independent executive, legislative and judicial branches as well as a complex system of checks and balances including a weighted power-sharing ratio designed to protect the interests of the Turkish Cypriots. The executive was led by a Greek Cypriot president and a Turkish Cypriot vice-president elected by their respective communities for five-year terms and each possessing a right of veto over certain types of legislation and executive decisions. Legislative power rested on the House of Representatives who were also elected on the basis of separate voters' rolls.

Since 1965, following clashes between the two communities, the [[Turkish Cypriot]] seats in the House remain vacant. In 1974 Cyprus was divided ''de facto'' when the Turkish army occupied the northern third of the island. The Turkish Cypriots subsequently declared independence in 1983 as the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] but were recognised only by [[Turkey]]. In 1985 the TRNC adopted a constitution and held its first elections. The United Nations recognises the sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus over the entire island of Cyprus.

The House of Representatives currently has 59 members elected for a five-year term, 56 members by [[proportional representation]] and 3 observer members representing the [[Armenians in Cyprus|Armenian]], [[Roman Catholicism in Cyprus|Latin]] and [[Maronites in Cyprus|Maronite]] minorities. 24 seats are allocated to the [[Turkish people|Turkish]] community but remain vacant since 1964. The political environment is dominated by the communist [[Progressive Party of Working People|AKEL]], the liberal conservative [[Democratic Rally]], the [[centrism|centrist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=DotNetNuke |url=http://www.diko.org.cy/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611174508/http://www.diko.org.cy/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=24 |archivedate=11 June 2007 |title=Ιδεολογική Διακήρυξη του Δημοκρατικού Κόμματος |publisher=Diko.org.cy |accessdate=6 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Democratic Party (Cyprus)|Democratic Party]], the [[social democracy|social-democratic]] [[Movement for Social Democracy|EDEK]] and the centrist [[European Party (Cyprus)|EURO.KO]].
In 2008, [[Dimitris Christofias]] became the country's first Communist head of state. Due to his involvement in the [[2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis]], Christofias did not run for re-election in 2013. The Presidential election in 2013 resulted in [[Democratic Rally]] candidate [[Nicos Anastasiades]] winning 57.48% of the vote. As a result, Anastasiades was sworn in on and has been President since 28 February 2013. Anastasiades was re-elected with 56% of the vote in the [[Cypriot presidential election, 2018|2018 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribune.gr/world/news/article/434054/nikitis-ton-eklogon-stin-kypro-56-o-nikos-anastasiadis.html|title=Νικητής των εκλογών στην Κύπρο με 56% ο Νίκος Αναστασιάδης|first=Αίθουσα|last=Σύνταξης|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyprus has four [[exclave]]s, all in territory that belongs to the [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia|British Sovereign Base Area of Dhekelia]]. The first two are the villages of [[Ormidhia]] and [[Xylotymvou]]. The third is the [[Dhekelia Power Station]], which is divided by a British road into two parts. The northern part is the [[Electricity Authority of Cyprus|EAC]] refugee settlement. The southern part, even though located by the sea, is also an exclave because it has no [[territorial waters]] of its own, those being U.K. waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geosite.jankrogh.com/dhekelia.htm|title=Dhekelia |publisher=Geosite.jankrogh.com |date=  30 January 2012 |accessdate=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus|UN buffer zone]] runs up against Dhekelia and picks up again from its east side off [[Ayios Nikolaos, SBA|Ayios Nikolaos]] and is connected to the rest of Dhekelia by a thin land corridor. In that sense the buffer zone turns the [[Paralimni]] area on the southeast corner of the island into a ''de facto'', though not ''[[de jure]]'', exclave.

The [[2012–2013 Cypriot financial crisis]] led to an agreement with the [[Eurogroup]] in March 2013 to split the country's second largest bank, the Cyprus Popular Bank (also known as Laiki Bank), into a "bad" bank which would be wound down over time and a "good" bank which would be absorbed by the Bank of Cyprus. In return for a €10&amp;nbsp;billion [[bailout]] from the [[European Commission]], the [[European Central Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]], often referred to as the "troika", the Cypriot government was required to impose a significant [[haircut (finance)|haircut]] on [[deposit insurance|uninsured deposits]], a large proportion of which were held by wealthy [[Russians]] who used Cyprus as a [[tax haven]].

According to the first population census after the declaration of independence, carried out in December 1960 and covering the entire island, Cyprus had a total population of 573,566; of whom 442,138 (77.1%) were Greeks, 104,320 (18.2%) Turkish, and 27,108 (4.7%) others.&lt;ref name="countrystudies.us" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shrinking"&gt;Hatay, Mete "Is the Turkish Cypriot Population Shrinking?", International Peace Research Institute, 2007. Pages 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the inter-communal ethnic tensions between 1963 and 1974, an island-wide census was regarded as impossible. Nevertheless, the Cypriot government conducted one in 1973, without the Turkish Cypriot populace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=St John-Jones |first=L.W. |year=1983 |title=The Population of Cyprus: Demographic Trends and Socio-Economic Influences |place=London |publisher=Maurice Temple Smith Ltd |page=17 |isbn=0-85117-232-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this census, the Greek Cypriot population was 482,000. One year later, in 1974, the Cypriot government's Department of Statistics and Research estimated the total population of Cyprus at 641,000; of whom 506,000 (78.9%) were Greeks, and 118,000 (18.4%) Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Cyprus Ministry of Interior |year=1992 |title=The Demographic Structure of Cyprus |url=http://www.moi.gov.cy/moi/pio/pio.nsf/All/20C7614D06858E9FC2256DC200380113/$file/cuco%20report.pdf?OpenElement |publisher=Parliamentary Assembly |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the partition of the island in 1974, the government of Cyprus conducted four more censuses: in 1976, 1982, 1992 and 2001; these excluded the Turkish population which was resident in the northern part of the island.&lt;ref name="Shrinking" /&gt;

According to the Republic of Cyprus's latest estimate, in 2005, the number of Cypriot citizens currently living in the Republic of Cyprus is around 871,036.

===Education===
{{Main|Education in Cyprus}}
[[File:Izgled-Faneromeni shool and the Mausoleum of the Martyrs of 9 July 1821, Nicosia-2.jpg|thumb|[[Faneromeni School]] is the oldest all-girl primary school in Cyprus.]]

Cyprus has a highly developed system of primary and secondary education offering both public and private education. The high quality of instruction can be attributed in part to the fact that nearly 7% of the GDP is spent on education which makes Cyprus one of the top three spenders of education in the EU along with Denmark and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childinfo.org/files/IND_Cyprus.pdf UNICEF, Division of Policy and Practice, Statistics and Monitoring Section] childinfo.org, May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[State school]]s are generally seen as equivalent in quality of education to private-sector institutions. However, the value of a state high-school diploma is limited by the fact that the grades obtained account for only around 25% of the final grade for each topic, with the remaining 75% assigned by the teacher during the semester, in a minimally transparent way. Cypriot universities (like universities in Greece) ignore high school grades almost entirely for admissions purposes. While a high-school diploma is mandatory for university attendance, admissions are decided almost exclusively on the basis of scores at centrally administered university entrance examinations that all university candidates are required to take.

The majority of Cypriots receive their higher education at Greek, British, Turkish, other European and North American universities. It is noteworthy that Cyprus currently has the highest percentage of citizens of [[Legal working age|working age]] who have higher-level education in the EU at 30% which is ahead of Finland's 29.5%. In addition, 47% of its population aged 25–34 have tertiary education, which is the highest in the EU. The body of Cypriot students is highly mobile, with 78.7% studying in a university outside Cyprus.

==Culture==
[[File:Pagkiprio High school entrance Nicosia Republic of Cyprus.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|The entrance of the historic [[Pancyprian Gymnasium]]]]

Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots share a lot in common in their culture but also have differences. Several traditional food (such as [[souvla]] and [[halloumi]]) and beverages are similar, as well as expressions and ways of life. Hospitality and buying or offering food and drinks for guests or others are common among both. In both communities, music, dance and art are integral parts of social life and many artistic, verbal and nonverbal expressions, traditional dances such as [[tsifteteli]], similarities in dance costumes and importance placed on social activities are shared between the communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fong|first1=Mary|last2=Chuang|first2=Rueyling|title=Communicating Ethnic and Cultural Identity|date=2004|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-1739-4|page=286|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ue4CCUhRYa4C&amp;pg=PA286&amp;cad=0#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the two communities have distinct religions and religious cultures, with the Greek Cypriots traditionally being [[Church of Cyprus|Greek Orthodox]] and Turkish Cypriots traditionally being [[Sunni Muslims]], which has partly hindered cultural exchange.&lt;ref name="CyprusinEurope"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyprus in Europe: Seizing the Momentum of Nice |author=Patrick R.

The art history of Cyprus can be said to stretch back up to 10,000 years, following the discovery of a series of [[Chalcolithic]] period carved figures in the villages of [[Khoirokoitia]] and [[Lempa (Lemba)|Lempa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arcl.ed.ac.uk/arch/lemba/homepage.html |title=Lemba Archaeological Research Centre |publisher=Arcl.ed.ac.uk |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117041553/http://www.arcl.ed.ac.uk/arch/lemba/homepage.html |archivedate=17 January 2013 |accessdate=25 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island is the home to numerous examples of high quality religious [[icon painting]] from the [[Cyprus in the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]] as well as [[List of painted churches in Cyprus|many painted churches]]. Cypriot architecture was heavily influenced by [[French Gothic architecture|French Gothic]] and Italian [[renaissance architecture|renaissance]] introduced in the island during the era of Latin domination (1191–1571).

In modern times Cypriot art history begins with the painter Vassilis Vryonides (1883–1958) who studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Chrysanthos Christou, ''A short History of Modern and Contemporary Cypriot Art,'' Nicosia 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably the two founding fathers of modern Cypriot art were Adamantios Diamantis (1900–1994) who studied at London's [[Royal College of Art]] and Christopheros Savva (1924–1968) who also studied in London, at [[Saint Martin's School of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Education and Culture, ''State Gallery of Contemporary Cypriot Art'' (Nicosia: MOEC,1998)&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways these two artists set the template for subsequent Cypriot art and both their artistic styles and the patterns of their education remain influential to this day. In particular the majority of Cypriot artists still train in England&lt;ref&gt;Michael Paraskos, 'The Art of Modern Cyprus', in ''Sunjet,'' Spring 2002, 62f&lt;/ref&gt; while others train at art schools in [[Greece]] and local art institutions such as the [[Cyprus College of Art]], [[University of Nicosia]] and the [[Frederick Institute of Technology]].

One of the features of Cypriot art is a tendency towards figurative painting although [[conceptual art]] is being rigorously promoted by a number of art "institutions" and most notably the Nicosia Municipal Art Centre. Municipal art galleries exist in all the main towns and there is a large and lively commercial art scene. Cyprus was due to host the international art festival [[Manifesta]] in 2006 but this was cancelled at the last minute following a dispute between the Dutch organizers of Manifesta and the Cyprus Ministry of Education and Culture over the location of some of the Manifesta events in the Turkish sector of the capital [[Nicosia]].&lt;ref name="schools out"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/schools_out |title=Schools Out |date=September 2006 |publisher=www.frieze.com |access-date=6 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230144907/http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/schools_out# |archive-date=30 December 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Manifestaartnet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/news/zenakos/zenakos6-5-06.asp |title=Manifesta no more |publisher=www.artnet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- The ensuing furore over this event resulted in questions in Cyprus as to whether Manifesta was a [[CIA]]-backed plot to undermine the Greek Cypriot side in on-going negotiations over the reunification of Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Paraskos, 'Was Manifesta a CIA Plot?' in ''Artcyprus,'' issue 2, Autumn 2006, 2&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=February 2011}} : see chat--&gt;

Other notable Greek Cypriot artists include [[Helene Black]], [[Kalopedis family]], Panayiotis Kalorkoti, [[Nicos Nicolaides]], [[Stass Paraskos]], [[Arestís Stasí]], [[Telemachos Kanthos]], [[Konstantia Sofokleous]] and [[Chris Achilleos]], and Turkish Cypriot artists include [[İsmet Güney]], [[Ruzen Atakan]] and [[Mutlu Çerkez]].

[[File:Laghouto.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Laouto]], dominant instrument of the Cypriot traditional music.]]

The traditional [[folk music]] of Cyprus has several common elements with [[Music of Greece|Greek]], [[Music of Turkey|Turkish]], and [[Arabic Music]] including Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot dances such as the ''[[sousta]]'', ''[[syrtos]]'', ''[[zeibekikos]]'', ''[[tatsia]]'', and ''[[karsilamas]]'' as well as the Middle Eastern-inspired ''[[tsifteteli]]'' and ''arapies''. There is also a form of musical poetry known as ''chattista'' which is often performed at traditional feasts and celebrations. The instruments commonly associated with Cyprus folk music are the [[violin]] ("fkiolin"), [[lute]] ("laouto"), [[accordion]], Cyprus [[flute]] ([[fipple flute|''pithkiavlin'']]), [[oud]] ("outi") and percussions (including the "[[goblet drum|toumperleki]]"). Composers associated with traditional Cypriot music include [[Solon Michaelides]], [[Marios Tokas]], Evagoras Karageorgis and Savvas Salides. Among musicians is also the acclaimed pianist [[Cyprien Katsaris]] and composer and artistic director of the European Capital of Culture initiative [[Marios Joannou Elia]].

[[Popular music]] in Cyprus is generally influenced by the Greek ''[[Laïka]]'' scene; artists who play in this genre include international [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] star [[Anna Vissi]],&lt;ref name="Inc.1999"&gt;{{cite book |author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQ0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA8|date=8 May 1999|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=8|quote=Sony Music executives congratulate Greek artist Anna Vissi before her recent sold-out performance at the Theater at Madison Square Garden in New York the first stop in her North-American tour to promote her album Antidoto|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HellanderArmstrong2008"&gt;{{cite book |author1= Hellander, Paul|author2=Kate Armstrong|author3=Michael Clark|author4=Christopher Deliso|title=Lonely Planet Greek Islands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4PDWSOx4lUwC&amp;pg=PA49|year=2008|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74104-314-3|page=49|quote=The country's big pop and laïka stars include Anna Vissi, Notis Sfakiana- kis, Despina Vandi, Yiannis Ploutarhos, Antonis Remos, Mihalis Hatziyian- nis, heartthrob Sakis Rouvas and Greek-Swedish singer Elena Paparizou, who won Greece&amp;nbsp;...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Inc.2001"&gt;{{cite book |author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MhQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA71|date=14 July 2001|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=71|quote=The hits of platinum stars Anna Vissi, Despina Vandi and Keti Garbi are played in clubs together with the Anna Vissi international dance hits of Deep- swing, Planetfunk&amp;nbsp;... |issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rhythm: Global Sounds and Ideas"&gt;{{cite book |title=Rhythm: Global Sounds and Ideas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JbA4AQAAIAAJ|year=2000|publisher=World Marketing Incorporated|volume=9|issue=6–11|page=70|quote=We have a Euro Music category with clips by the Gipsy Kings and Anna Vissi, a huge star for Sony Greece "We also have ..}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evridiki]], and [[Sarbel]]. [[Hip Hop]], [[R&amp;B]] and [[reggae]] have been supported by the emergence of Cypriot [[rap music|rap]] and the [[urban music]] scene at [[Ayia Napa]]. Cypriot rock music and ''[[Éntekhno]]'' rock is often associated with artists such as [[Michalis Hatzigiannis]] and [[Alkinoos Ioannidis]]. [[Heavy metal music|Metal]] also has a small following in Cyprus represented by bands such as Armageddon (rev.16:16), Blynd, [[Winter's Verge]], [[Methysos]] and Quadraphonic.

Literary production of the antiquity includes the [[Cypria]], an [[epic poetry|epic poem]], probably composed in the late 7th century BC and attributed to [[Stasinus]]. The Cypria is one of the very first specimens of Greek and European poetry.&lt;ref&gt;"An indication that at least the main contents of the ''Cypria'' were known around 650 BC is provided by the representation of the [[Judgment of Paris]] on the [[Chigi vase]]" (Burkert 1992:103).

Epic poetry, notably the "acritic songs", flourished during [[Middle Ages]]. Two chronicles, one written by [[Leontios Machairas]] and the other by Georgios Voustronios, cover the entire Middle Ages until the end of Frankish rule (4th century–1489). Poèmes d'amour written in medieval Greek Cypriot date back from the 16th century. Some of them are actual translations of poems written by [[Petrarch]], [[Bembo]], [[Ariosto]] and G. [[Sannazzaro]].&lt;ref&gt;Th. Siapkaras- Pitsillidés, Le Pétrarchisme en Cypre. Poèmes d' amour en dialecte Chypriote d' après un manuscript du XVIe siècle, Athènes 1975 (2ème édition)&lt;/ref&gt; Many Cypriot scholars fled Cyprus at troubled times such as [[Ioannis Kigalas]] (c. 1622–1687) who migrated from Cyprus to Italy in the 17th century, several of his works have survived in books of other scholars.&lt;ref name=" Deutsche Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin 1956 209-210 "&gt;{{cite book |author= Deutsche Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin.

Modern Greek Cypriot literary figures include the poet and writer [[Kostas Montis]], poet [[Kyriakos Charalambides]], poet [[Michalis Pasiardis]], writer [[Nicos Nicolaides]], Stylianos Atteshlis, [[Altheides]], Loukis Akritas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philatelism.com/details.php?issueid=256 |title=Cyprus Stamp Issue: Loukis Akritas}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Demetris Th. Gotsis.

There is an increasingly strong presence of both temporary and permanent emigre Cypriot writers in world literature, as well as writings by second and third -generation Cypriot writers born or raised abroad, often writing in English. This includes writers such as [[Stephen Laughton]], [[Michael Paraskos]], [[Stel Pavlou]] and [[Stephanos Stephanides]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Davidian, 'A literary resilience' in ''The Cyprus Weekly'' (Cyprus newspaper), 10 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of Cyprus in foreign literature include the works of Shakespeare, with most of the play ''[[Othello]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] set on the island of Cyprus. British writer [[Lawrence Durrell]] lived in Cyprus from 1952 until 1956, during his time working for the British colonial government on the island, and wrote the book ''[[Bitter Lemons]]'' about his time in Cyprus which won the second [[Duff Cooper Prize]] in 1957. More recently British writer [[Victoria Hislop]] used Cyprus as the setting for her 2014 novel ''The Sunrise.''

Local television companies in Cyprus include the state owned [[Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation]] which runs two television channels. In addition on the Greek side of the island there are the private channels ANT1 Cyprus, Plus TV, Mega Channel, Sigma TV, Nimonia TV (NTV) and New Extra. In Northern Cyprus, the local channels are [[Bayrak|BRT]], the Turkish Cypriot equivalent to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation, and a number of private channels.

===Cinema===
{{Main|Cinema of Cyprus}}
The most worldwide known Cypriot director, to have worked abroad, is [[Michael Cacoyannis]].

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, George Filis produced and directed ''Gregoris Afxentiou'', ''Etsi Prodothike i Kypros'', and ''The Mega Document''. In 1994, Cypriot film production received a boost with the establishment of the Cinema Advisory Committee. In 2000, the annual amount set aside for filmmaking in the national budget was [[Cypriot pound|CYP£]]500,000 (about €850,000). In addition to government grants, Cypriot co-productions are eligible for funding from the [[Council of Europe]]'s [[Eurimages]] Fund, which finances European film co-productions. To date, four feature films on which a Cypriot was an executive producer have received funding from Eurimages. The first was ''I Sphagi tou Kokora'' (1996), followed by ''Hellados'' (unreleased), ''To Tama'' (1999), and ''O Dromos gia tin Ithaki'' (2000).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.filmbirth.com/cyprus.html Film Birth – History of Cinema – Cyprus]".&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Greek filmmaker [[Vassilis Mazomenos]] shot the drama film [[Guilt (movie)|''Guilt'']] in Cyprus. The film was awarded the Best Screenwriting and Best Photography award at the [[London Greek Film Festival]], and was an official selection in the [[Montreal World Film Festival]], [[Cairo International Film Festival]], [[India International Film Festival]], [[Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival]], and [[Fantasporto]]. It was also the opening film in the Panorama of European Cinema in [[Athens]]. In 2010, the film was nominated for the best film from the [[Hellenic Film Academy]].

Only a small number of foreign films have been made in Cyprus. This includes ''[[Incense for the Damned]]'' (1970), [[The Beloved (1970 film)|''The Beloved'']] (1970), and ''[[Ghost in the Noonday Sun]]'' (1973).&lt;ref&gt;Roger Lewis, ''The Life and Death of Peter Sellers'' (London: Arrow, 1995) p.130&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the [[John Wayne]] film ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'' (1962) were also filmed in Cyprus.

Common vegetable preparations include potatoes in olive oil and parsley, pickled cauliflower and beets, asparagus and [[taro]]. Other traditional delicacies are meat marinated in dried coriander seeds and wine, and eventually dried and smoked, such as ''lountza'' (smoked [[pork loin]]), charcoal-grilled lamb, [[souvlaki]] (pork and chicken cooked over charcoal), and [[sheftalia]] (minced meat wrapped in [[mesentery]]). ''Pourgouri'' ([[bulgur]], cracked wheat) is the traditional source of carbohydrate other than bread, and is used to make the delicacy [[Kibbeh|koubes]].

Fresh vegetables and fruits are common ingredients. Frequently used vegetables include courgettes, green peppers, [[okra]], green beans, artichokes, carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce and grape leaves, and pulses such as beans, broad beans, peas, black-eyed beans, chick-peas and lentils. The most common fruits and nuts are pears, apples, grapes, oranges, [[mandarin orange|mandarines]], nectarines, [[medlar]], blackberries, cherry, strawberries, figs, watermelon, melon, avocado, lemon, pistachio, almond, chestnut, walnut, and hazelnut.

==Areas of focus==

===Education===

Via print and film, Dancing Star Foundation seeks to increase awareness of environmental issues ranging from biodiversity and [[extinction]] to [[non-violence]] and [[over-population]].&lt;ref name="Mission"/&gt; Examples are ''No Vacancy'', a book and documentary film combination which addresses the volatile issue of population stabilization in the U.S., China, and eight other countries; the book ''Sanctuary'', "a 338-page compendium of full color photography showcasing twenty-four animal sanctuaries located throughout twenty different countries";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Book review: Sanctuary: Global Oases Of Innocence |publisher=[[Midwest Book Review]] |date=2008 |url=http://www.sanctuary-thebook.org/news/news.html |accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the documentary film ''Mad Cowboy'', the story of cattle rancher-turned-[[vegan]] and animal rights activist [[Howard Lyman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Richards |first=Jennie |date=1 March 2016 |title=Documentary film ''Mad Cowboy'', the story of Howard Lyman |url=http://www.humanedecisions.com/documentary-film-mad-cowboy-the-story-of-howard-lyman/ |website=humanedecisions.com |accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal protection===

The foundation operates an animal sanctuary in [[Central California]] for rescued animals.&lt;ref name="Sanctuary"&gt;{{cite web |title=Animal Protection – U.S. Sanctuaries |url=http://www.dancingstarfoundation.org/mission.php |website=dancingstarfoundation.org |publisher=Dancing Star Foundation |accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of the facilities is to provide sanctuary "for the benefit, solace, peace and quiet of the resident species".&lt;ref name="Sanctuary"/&gt;

===Biodiversity conservation===

The foundation is involved in efforts to promote biodiversity conservation—mostly through "documentation in book and film form of research being carried out by governments, other NGOs and individual ecologists"—in various countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Biodiversity Conservation |url=http://www.dancingstarfoundation.org/biodiversity_conservation.php |website=dancingstarfoundation.org |publisher=Dancing Star Foundation |accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UCLA medical school===

Dancing Star Foundation created and funded an alternative [[oncology]] program, the Sue Stiles Program in Integrative Oncology at the [[Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="Stiles Program"&gt;{{cite web |title=Stiles Program in Integrative Oncology |url=https://ccim.med.ucla.edu/?page_id=158 |website=ccim.med.ucla.edu |publisher=[[UCLA School of Medicine]] |accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is under the direction of oncologist Richard J. Pietras.&lt;ref name="Stiles Program"/&gt;

==Current leadership==

===President===

===Executive vice president===

Jane Gray Morrison is executive vice president of the foundation.&lt;ref name="Biographies"/&gt; An ecologist/filmmaker, Morrison produced the ten-hour [[Turner Broadcasting]] series "Voice of the Planet", which chronicled the history of life on Earth; the project "involved filming for nearly two years in 25 countries".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Morrison is also responsible for the production of a trilogy of [[documentary film]]s titled "Mad Cowboy", "No Vacancy", and "Hotspots", and has co-authored books on [[environmental issues]].&lt;ref name="Biographies"/&gt;

===Vice president, finance and operations===

Don Cannon is vice president of finance and operations of the foundation.&lt;ref name="Biographies"/&gt; Cannon's background includes tenures with both [[A&amp;M Records]] and [[Elektra Records]], as well as [[Hanna Barbera]] and other [[television production]] companies.&lt;ref name="Biographies"/&gt; Prior to joining Dancing Star Foundation, he was a senior vice president at [[ICM Partners]], a large talent management agency.&lt;ref name="Biographies"/&gt;

==Euthanasia controversy==

In early 2009, a small number of former employees alleged that the Cayucos animal sanctuary was [[Animal euthanasia|euthanizing animals]] for economic reasons.&lt;ref name=LAT260209&gt;{{cite news |last=Chawkins |first=Steve |date=26 February 2009 |title=Animal sanctuaries criticized over surge in euthanizations |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/feb/26/local/me-animal-sanctuary26 |accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CBS200209&gt;{{cite web |title=Ex-employees claim CA sanctuary killing animals |date=20 February 2009 |publisher=CBS 5 News |url=http://cbs5.com/local/animals.horses.Euthanized.2.940213.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228135350/http://cbs5.com/local/animals.horses.Euthanized.2.940213.html |archivedate=28 February 2009 |accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A maintenance supervisor who made similar allegations claims he was dismissed due to speaking out, although the sanctuary says he was terminated for other reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tanner |first=Kathe |date=19 February 2009 |title=Sanctuary is euthanizing animals to save money, ex-workers say; officials at Dancing Star shelter on north coast say actions are justified for health reasons |newspaper=[[The Tribune (San Luis Obispo)]] |url=http://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/local/breaking_news/story/631514.html}}{{dead link|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dancing Star denied the animal-care allegations, saying that they are "contrary to our most deeply held beliefs" and that the Foundation is "unwavering in our commitment to compassion".&lt;ref name=CBS200209/&gt; [[San Luis Obispo County]] Animal Services determined that the euthanized animals were "either beyond treatment or had conditions for which euthanasia would be at least one of the considerations that could be responsibly made".&lt;ref name="LAT260209"/&gt; The general counsel of the [[Farm Sanctuary]] in New York State, who examined the Cayucos sanctuary following the allegations, said he was unable to confirm the process for selecting those who had been euthanized.&lt;ref name=LAT260209/&gt; But he noted, "It's the best-funded place in the country for animals, and the staff appears to be caring."&lt;ref name=LAT260209/&gt;

Being part of the [[Kingdom of Denmark]], the '''foreign relations of Greenland''' are handled in cooperation with the Danish government and Government of Greenland.

Unlike Denmark, Greenland is no longer part of the [[European Union]]. However, Greenland has remained a full member of the [[Council of Europe]] and [[NATO]].

== Diplomatic representations ==
With the Kingdom of Denmark having the responsibility for Greenland's international affairs, other countries do not have direct diplomatic representation in Greenland—their embassies or consulates in Denmark are responsible for their relations with Greenland and their citizens in Greenland. Greenland is represented internationally by the embassies and consulates of Denmark, although Greenland does directly participate in some Nordic organisations{{Which|date=January 2011}} that provide membership for dependent territories.

== Disputes – ''international'' ==
* [[Qaanaaq]] (formerly Thule) is a sensitive area, due to the forced removal of the local population when establishing the base, handling of removal, compensation of the locals, later incidents aggravated the case.
* Uncontested dispute with [[Canada]] over [[Hans Island]] sovereignty in the [[Kennedy Channel]] between Canadian [[Ellesmere Island]] and [[Greenland]].

'''Full spectral imaging''' is a form of [[Imaging spectroscopy]] and is the successor to [[Hyperspectral imaging]].  Full Spectral Imaging was developed to improve the capabilities of [[Earth remote sensing]] (see also [[remote sensing]]).  Hyperspectral imaging acquires data as many contiguous spectral bands.  Full Spectral Imaging (FSI) acquires data as spectral curves.  A significant advantage of FSI over Hyperspectral is a significant reduction in data rate and volume.  FSI extracts and saves only the information that is in the raw data.  The information is contained in the shape of the spectral curves.  The rate at which data is produced by an FSI system is proportional to the amount of information in the scene/image.

Full Spectral Imaging, along with Empirical reflectance retrieval and Autonomous Remote Sensing are the components of the New System for Remote Sensing.  The New System for Remote Sensing could be the successor to the [[Landsat]] series of satellites of the [[Landsat program]].  The concepts mentioned above have been developed in collaboration with many experts, most of whom have little to nothing to do with traditional remote sensing.  These concepts rely solely on currently available off-the-shelf technology, and on existing infrastructure.

==References==

The first discussion of Full Spectral Imaging was presented SPIE International Remote Sensing Conference in Barcelona in 2004 in the paper; "Full spectral imaging: a revisited approach to remote sensing". [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004SPIE.5234..243B] or {{doi|10.1117/12.510485}}.

'''Gavdos''' ({{lang-el|Γαύδος}}, {{IPA-el|ˈɣavðos|}}) is the southernmost [[List of islands of Greece|Greek island]], located to the south of its much larger neighbour, [[Crete]], of which it is administratively a part, in the regional unit of [[Chania (regional unit)|Chania]]. It forms a community with surrounding islets and was part of the former [[Selino Province]]. The island is situated at the southern tip of Greece, thus making it the [[Extreme points of Europe|southernmost]] point of the entire [[Europe|European continent]].

==Name==
Gavdos has been known by a wide variety of names. For example, it appears in the biblical account of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]'s journey to Rome in [[Acts 27]] as "Clauda" ({{lang|grc|Κλαῦδα}}) or "Cauda" ({{lang|grc|Καῦδα}}). The island was also referred to as "Cauda" by Roman geographer [[Pomponius Mela]], and as "Gaudos" by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]. [[Ptolemy]] called Gavdos "Claudos" ({{lang|grc|Κλαῦδος}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.cc/acts/27-16.htm Acts 27:16], Biblos.com parallel bible&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]]s called it "Gotzo", perhaps in imitation of the [[Malta|Maltese]] island "[[Gozo]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kreta2005.nl/uk/gavdos.html ''The island of Gavdos''], [http://www.kreta2005.nl/uk/index.html Crete Travel Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; From the 17th to the 19th centuries, the island was known as "Gondzo". A [[Turkish language|Turkish]] name of Godzo was "Bougadoz".

[[File:Kap Tripiti.jpg|thumb|250px|left|&lt;center&gt;Kap Trypiti, the most southern point of Europe. The sculpture of the oversized chair can be seen.&lt;/center&gt;]]

==Geography==
The island is {{convert|26|nmi|km|0}} south of [[Chora Sfakion]]. The area of the municipality, which includes the small island [[Gavdopoula]], is {{convert|32.424|km2|1|abbr=out}}.&lt;ref name=stat01&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dlib.statistics.gr/Book/GRESYE_02_0101_00098%20.pdf |publisher=National Statistical Service of Greece |title=Population &amp; housing census 2001 (incl. area and average elevation) |language=el |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921212047/http://dlib.statistics.gr/Book/GRESYE_02_0101_00098%20.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The island is roughly triangular in shape. Its highest point is Mount Vardia, {{convert|345|m|0|abbr=off}}. The southeastern corner is a rocky peninsula with a [[natural arch]] carved by the elements, called Trypiti. A sculpture of an oversized chair sits on top of Trypiti.

There is an islet called [[Gavdopoula]] (Γαυδοπούλα, "little Gavdos") to the north west of Gavdos. Gavdos and Gavdopoula are covered with [[garrigue|phrygana]] (φρύγανα), low-lying shrubs. Both are important stops for [[bird migration|migrating]] birds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gavdos-online.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=17 ''European populations of migratory birds''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711075804/http://www.gavdos-online.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=17 |date=2011-07-11 }}, ''Natural History Museum of Crete'' of the [[University of Crete]], Flora and Fauna on Gavdos, [http://www.gavdos-online.com/index.php?option=com_frontpage&amp;Itemid=1 Gavdos Online Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310053956/http://www.gavdos-online.com/index.php?option=com_frontpage&amp;Itemid=1 |date=2010-03-10 }}, March 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Local birds include the [[Eurasian scops-owl|Eurasian scops owl]] and the [[European shag]]. Gavdos also has a variety of other vegetation, such as [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]] as well as forests of [[pine]]s and [[junipers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ornithologiki.gr/en/sppe/en181.php ''GR181 Gavdos and Gavdopoula islands''], Important Areas for the Birds of Greece, [[Hellenic Ornithological Society]], 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
Gavdos is the southernmost island in [[Greece]] and all of [[Europe]], with a [[Mediterranean climate|warm Mediterranean subtropical climate]] typical of the [[List of islands of Greece|Greek islands]] (Csa for [[Köppen climate classification|Koppen Classification]]), summers are constantly hot with daily temperatures reaching 32 ° C in August (extremes are occasional, sometimes it can reach 40 ° C) and extremely mild winters by European standards, February, the coldest month has an average temperature of 17 ° C. The [[Mediterranean Sea]] is an important thermal regulator that surrounds it island in all its directions, while maintaining the high temperature of the sea, especially in summer passing from 26 ° C. The mild climate is aided by hot winds blowing from the [[Sahara|Sahara Desert]]. The countless mountains of the [[Balkans]] protect from the cold, siberian air, in addition to its island condition. As a result of the [[Subtropical High]] of the [[Azores]] precipitation is concentrated in winter, making summer dry with almost none used as "beach time". It is the sunniest place in [[Europe]] and with the highest number of [[radiation]]: between 1800 and 1900 kWh/m² (ideal for [[Solar panel|solar panels]]), valoers closer to [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East|Middle East.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.touristmaker.com/greece/gavdos/|title=Gavdos, Greece|work=Tourist Maker|access-date=2018-08-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hotspotenergy.com/DC-air-conditioner/europe-solar-hours.php|title=Solar Sun Hours {{!}} Average Daily Solar Insolation {{!}} Europe|website=www.hotspotenergy.com|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Weather box

==Demographics==
There are only a small number of year-round residents of Gavdos and services for tourists are basic. {{As of|2011}}, the total population of Gavdos was measured as 152 people.&lt;ref name=census11/&gt; In reality, fewer than 50 people live permanently on the island. In the summer the total people on the island can reach over 3,500, most of whom are campers and tourists. The largest man-made harbour for [[ferry|ferries]] is Karave. The [[List of islands of Greece|island's]] capital is Kastri. The southernmost populated village is [[Vatsiana]], with a total permanent population of 31 people.

==History==
Gavdos has supported a permanent population since [[Neolithic]] times. However, the island currently has very few permanent residents.

Gavdos has been identified as a possible site of the mythical [[Ogygia]] where [[Calypso (mythology)|Kalypso]] held [[Odysseus]] prisoner. Archaeological evidence showed that the [[Roman empire]] was active on the island. During that time the [[flora (plants)|flora]] of the island was [[overexploited]] and that started a process of [[erosion]] which has continued to this day.

Gavdos had approximately 8,000 inhabitants by 900 AD. During the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s reign on the island, which lasted from 1665 until 1895, Gavdos was known as Gondzo. During this period the population decreased considerably to only 500 by 1882. A reference to [[Saracens]] on the island survives: the [[beach]] Sarakiniko ("''of the Saracens''").

In the 1930s the island was used as a place of exile of [[communist]]s; more than 250 people were [[exile]]d including leading figures of the Greek movement, such as [[Markos Vafiadis]]. During World War II, allied forces evacuated some forces to Gavdos following the German victory in the [[battle of Crete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Nazis Pound Crete Allies | date=June 1, 1941 | publisher= | url =https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/411267591.html?dids=411267591:411267591&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=Jun+01%2C+1941&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Nazis+Pound+Crete+Allies&amp;pqatl=google | work =Los Angeles Times | pages = | accessdate = 2007-09-27 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on, the general phase of [[urbanization]] that started in other parts of Greece in the 1960s took place in the 1950s on Gavdos. During that period the islanders exchanged their land on Gavdos with ex-Turkish land on Crete, which had now become exchangeable via the state.&lt;ref&gt;?&lt;/ref&gt; Upon settling in Crete they created a community known as Gavdiotika, which is part of the town of [[Paleochora]].

==Economy==
There are many abandoned terraces on Gavdos where farmers used to grow crops on the hillsides. There still is some agriculture on Gavdos. During the summer, the population of the island swells to a few thousand because of tourists, although there are few facilities for tourists. There is one year-round cafe in Carave (''Karabe'') on Gavdos run by Evangelina Tsigonakis.&lt;ref name=Pickford/&gt; There is a modern non-functioning reproduction lighthouse tower on Gavdos which now serves as a cafe during the summer season; the complex also contains a museum on the history of the original lighthouse with several rooms of photos and antique equipment. Gavdos has an [[FM radio]] station, ''Gavdos FM 88.8'', which is also available online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gavdosfm.gr/ Gavdosfm homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Following years of isolation, in 1996 the island came to [[Mass media|media]] prominence. In a [[NATO]] exercise Gavdos was the focal point of a confrontation between Greece and [[Turkey]]. Following that, [[Prime Minister of Greece|Prime Minister]] [[Costas Simitis]] visited Gavdos and announced a five-year, [[euro|€]]1.5 million plan for the island's development.

In 2001, [[Costis Stephanopoulos]], the Greek President, inaugurated a [[telemedicine]] centre on Gavdos, an island which has not had a full-time [[Physician|doctor]] in recent memory. This effort, however, was marred as the island's [[infrastructure]] could not provide the necessary [[Electrical power|power]] required by the centre. For the purposes of the inauguration, [[Electricity generation|generators]] were brought in, which were then removed. However, according to a 2008 [[BBC News]] report the island now features stable electrical power, and young medical graduates can serve for six months on Gavdos in lieu of [[Conscription in Greece|compulsory military service]]. But visitors to Gavdos in June 2008 found that the power station was not functioning and that businesses were relying on gas generators operated for a few hours per night; locals stated that the power station worked initially, but no longer serves the entire island reliably.&lt;ref name=Pickford/&gt;

In 2002, the island was in the news again, due to the arrests of members of the extremist [[Marxist]] group [[Revolutionary Organization 17 November|17 November]]. The leader of this organization had been living openly for several years on Gavdos as a [[beekeeper]].&lt;ref name=Pickford&gt;[http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/7205519.stm ''The Med's 'forgotten' island: It is hard to imagine a more spectacular edge of a continent''], John Pickford, [[BBC News]], January 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gavdos in Literature==
Gavdos is featured in [[James Aldridge]]'s 1944 novel ''The Sea Eagle'', which tells the story of the escape of a Greek partisan and two Australian soldiers after the [[Battle of Crete]]. The three join an expedition to liberate some Cretan fishermen from a [[Metaxas Regime|Metaxas-era]] prison on the eastern end of the island. The attack on the cliffs of Khavro Spahti Bay is described in Chapters 24-28.

The '''geology of Armenia''' was shaped by geological upheaval pushed up the [[Earth's crust]] to form the [[Armenian Plateau]] 25 million years ago. This created the complex [[topography]] of Armenia.

The [[Lesser Caucasus]] range extends through northern Armenia, runs southeast between [[Lake Sevan]] and Azerbaijan, then passes roughly along the Armenian-Azerbaijani border to Iran. Thus situated, the mountains make travel from north to south difficult.

==Earthquakes==
Geological turmoil continues in the form of devastating earthquakes. In December 1988, the second largest city in the republic, [[Gyumri]] (then called Leninakan), was heavily damaged by a massive quake that killed more than 25,000 people.

==Terrain==
About half of Armenia's area of approximately {{convert|29,800|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}} has an elevation of at least {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and only 3% of the country lies below {{convert|650|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The lowest points are in the valleys of the Araks River and the Debet River in the far north, which have elevations of {{convert|380|and|430|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, respectively. Elevations in the Lesser Caucasus vary between {{convert|2640|and|3280|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. To the southwest of the range is the Armenian Plateau, which slopes southwestward toward the Araks River on the Turkish border. The plateau is masked by intermediate mountain ranges and extinct volcanoes. The largest of these, [[Mount Aragats]], {{convert|4095|m|ft|0|sp=us}} high, is also the highest point in Armenia. Most of the population lives in the western and northwestern parts of the country, where the two major cities, [[Yerevan]] and Gyumri (which was called Aleksandropol' during the tsarist period), are located.

The valleys of the [[Debet River]] and [[Akstafa River]] as they pass through mountain areas form the chief routes into Armenia from the north. [[Lake Sevan]] is by far the largest lake at {{convert|72.5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} across at its widest point and {{convert|376|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} long. It lies {{convert|2070|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level on the plateau.

Armenia's terrain is most rugged in the extreme southeast, which is drained by the [[Bargushat River]] and most moderate in the [[Araks River]] valley to the extreme southwest. Most of Armenia is drained by the [[Araks]] or its tributary, the [[Hrazdan]], which flow from Lake Sevan. The Araks forms most of Armenia's border with [[Turkey]] and [[Iran]] while the [[Zangezur Mountains]] form the border between Armenia's southern [[Syunik Province|province of Syunik]] and Azerbaijan's adjacent Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic.

===Volcanic mountains===
Volcanic mountains in Armenia include [[Mount Ara]], [[Mount Aragats]], [[Azhdahak]], [[Ghegam Ridge]], [[Mount of Armenia]]. [[Porak]]. [[Arpi Gorge]] and [[Garni Gorge]] contain columnar igneous rocks ([[Columnar jointing]]).

==Mining==
Mines in Armenia include [[Kajaran Mine]] and [[Teghut Mine]]. Both are [[open pit mine]]s for [[copper]] and [[molybdenum]].

[[Image:Gulf of the Farallones NMS map.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary, showing the location of the Gulf itself within]]
'''Gulf of the Farallones''' is a [[:wikt:gulf|gulf]] of the [[Pacific Ocean]] off the northern [[California]] coast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?lat=37.82893&amp;lon=-122.53841&amp;datum=nad83&amp;u=4&amp;layer=DRG&amp;size=l&amp;s=1000 USGS], 09-18-07&lt;/ref&gt; It extends westward from the opening of the [[San Francisco Bay]] and [[Drakes Bay]] to the [[Farallon Islands]].  Most of the gulf lies in [[Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary]], which protects about {{convert|1250|sqmi|km2}}.

The gulf is home to major shipping lines to the [[Port of San Francisco]], [[Port of Oakland]], and [[Port of Richmond (California)|Port of Richmond]]. The gulf has also historically been used as a dumping ground for various types of waste, including dredging sediment, industrial waste, sunk vessels, and barrels of low-level nuclear waste.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/22018113 ''Beyond the Golden Gate'', pages 60-71]&lt;/ref&gt;  Around 47,800 barrels of nuclear waste were dumped between 1946 and 1970; their location was largely unknown until mapping and monitoring efforts in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/22018119 ''Beyond the Golden Gate'', pages 66]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Farallones'' comes from the Spanish ''farallón'' meaning sea cliff and is a reference to the islands. Historical names for the gulf include Bahia De Puerto De San Francisco, Ensenada De Los Farallones, and La Bahia De Los Pinos.&lt;ref name=gnis&gt;{{gnis|1654437|Gulf of the Farallones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ivvavik National Park''' is located in [[Yukon]], Canada. Initially named "Northern Yukon National Park," the park was renamed Ivvavik in 1992 for the [[Inuvialuktun]] word meaning "nursery" or "birthplace,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/ivvavik-national-park/|title=Ivvavik National Park|last=Finkelstein|first=Maxwell W.|newspaper=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to the importance of the area as a calving ground for caribou.&lt;ref&gt;2018 - Park Management - Ivvavik National Park {{ISBN|978-0-660-23910-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Created as a result of the [[Inuvialuit Final Agreement]] in 1984, negotiated between the [[Government of Canada|Canadian Government]] and the [[Inuvialuit]] of the Northern Yukon, Ivvavik is the first national park in Canada to be established as a result of an aboriginal land claims agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/yt/ivvavik/index.aspx|title=Parks Canada - Ivvavik National Park|last=Canada|first=Parks Canada Agency, Government of|website=www.pc.gc.ca|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ivvavik contains the [[British Mountains]] which run east to west, parallel to the Arctic coast, and merge into the [[Brooks Range]] in Alaska.
Draining north through the Park from the British Mountains is the [[Firth River]], the oldest river in Canada&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/yt/ivvavik/info&lt;/ref&gt; and considered one of the great rafting rivers of the world. The river starts from year-round [[aufeis]] formations at the headwaters and then flows through extensive canyon areas before forming a huge delta as it enters the [[Beaufort Sea]] just west of [[Herschel Island]]. The first raft descent was by Martyn Williams, Alan Dennis and Jim Boyde.
Gold miners have operated on the Firth River and at Sheep Creek until the area became a National Park. The area around Sheep Creek is the northern most extension of Dall sheep habitat in Canada

The park contains many cultural sites of continuing importance to the local indigenous people, both Inuit and Indian.
Protecting a portion of the calving grounds of the [[Porcupine caribou]] herd, the park allows only a minimal number of people to visit per year.

On the shore of Beaufort Sea, there is abundant game for [[Northwestern wolf|timber wolves]], [[grizzly bear]]s, and [[American black bear|black bear]]s that inhabit the area. Other animals that inhabit this park two species of [[fox]], [[Alaska moose|moose]], [[lemming]]s,  [[Dall sheep]], [[gyrfalcon]]s, [[muskox]]en, and [[wolverine]]s. The [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] lies just across the border in [[Alaska]].  The [[Firth River]] holds some of the longest stocks of [[Arctic char|Dolly Varden char]] in western Canada

On the south-east, Ivvavik National Park borders [[Vuntut National Park]], established in 1995.  Due to land claims negotiations, Vuntut is still quite undeveloped and has no roads or developed trails.  Due to its undeveloped nature, several people have got lost and are presumed dead.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

[[File:Камяна могила схема.jpg|thumb|The site schematics]]
'''Kamyana Mohyla''' ({{lang-uk|Кам'яна Могила}};  literally: "stone tomb") is an archaeological site in the [[Molochna River]] (literally "Milk river") valley, about a mile from the village of Terpinnya, [[Zaporizhia Oblast]], Ukraine. Petroglyphs of Kamyana Mohyla are dated from Upper Paleolithic (Kukrek culture) to Medieval, with Stone Age depictions subjected to most archaeological interest. 
[[File:Каменная Могила, панорама 3. Автор Максим Стоялов.jpg|thumb|]]
The site encompasses a group of isolated blocks of [[sandstone]], up to twelve meters in height, scattered around an area of some 3,000 square meters. As [[Noghai]] legend has it, it resulted from a scuffle of two [[baghatur]]s who took turns throwing rocks at each other. In truth, the site had its origins in a [[sandbank]] of the [[Tethys Ocean]]. For a long time it was an island in the Molochna River, which has since been silted up and now flows a short distance to the west. It is thought to represent the only sandstone outcrop in the [[Azov-Kuban Depression]].

The shape of this sand hill is similar to that of [[kurgan]]s that dot the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe]]. In 1889, the Russian archaeologist [[Nikolay Veselovsky]] was called upon to explore the enigmatic site and started excavations the following year. As soon as he concluded that the site was a burial mound, excavations were terminated. There was very little scientific exploration of the site during the first third of the 20th century. 

In the 1930s the site was investigated by a team of scholars from [[Melitopol]] under [[Valentin Danylenko]] (1913–82). The young archaeologist claimed to have discovered thirty caves with [[petroglyph]] inscriptions which he dated from the 20th century BC to the 17th century AD. Danylenko resumed his work on the site after [[World War II]] and claimed to have discovered thirteen additional caves with petroglyphs. [[Image:Kamenna2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A stone with petroglyphs.]]
The site was designated an archaeological preserve in 1954. The move was intended to prevent the area from being flooded after construction of a [[water reservoir]]. During the following decades, the condition of petroglyphs visibly deteriorated.

Petroglyphs are found only inside the caves and grottoes of Kamenna Mohyla, many of them still filled up with sand. No adequate protection from the elements has been provided to this day. No traces of ancient human settlement have been discovered in the vicinity, leading many scholars to believe that the hill served as a remote [[sanctuary]]. Faint traces of red paint remain on parts of the surface. Scholars have been unable to agree whether the petroglyphs date from [[Mesolithic]] or [[Neolithic]]. The latter dating is more popular, although the presumed depiction of a [[mammoth]] in one of the caves seems to favour the former date.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

In 2006, the government of Ukraine nominated the site for inscription on the [[World Heritage List]]. On the whole, the Stone Tomb images represent traces of religious exercises of the hunters and cattle-breeders of this steppe zone of southeast Europe from the 20th century BC to the 17th century AD. Some caves are of artificial origin; their cultural strata have been fixed as the Neolithic, Bronze and Early Iron Ages as well as of Middle Ages.[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5075/]

Danylenko's magnum opus about the site was released posthumously, but it took the publication of [[Anatoly Kifishin]]'s hefty monograph in 2001 to attract wider attention to Kamenna Mohyla. In this controversial work, Kifishin compared the petroglyphs of Kamenna Mohyla to those of [[Çatalhöyük]] and concluded that both were related to the [[Sumer]]ian [[cuneiform script]]. Shortly before his death, [[Igor Diakonov]] lashed out against Kifishin's hypothesis (the two openly feuded since the 1960s).

== Academic controversies ==
He has been involved in a number of academic controversies, and these debates have been of a methodological and substantive nature. They include:

* He has disagreed with the [[Richard Wilkinson (public health)|Wilkinson inequality]] hypothesis that within country differences in health and mortality are driven by invidious comparison; instead arguing that there is a materialist argument based on poverty even in advanced economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.11.026 |title=Global variations in health: Evaluating Wilkinson's income inequality hypothesis using the World Values Survey |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=68 |issue=4 |pages=643–53 |year=2009 |last1=Jen |first1=Min Hua |last2=Jones |first2=Kelvyn |last3=Johnston |first3=Ron }}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument is based on critique of Wilkinson's use of aggregate data and supports the ideas of [[Hugh Gravelle]] that if there is a non-linear individual relationship between income and ill-health then the aggregate relationship will necessarily involve the 'spread' (standard deviation) of country income that is inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.healthplace.2008.04.005 |title=Compositional and contextual approaches to the study of health behaviour and outcomes: Using multi-level modelling to evaluate Wilkinson's income inequality hypothesis |journal=Health &amp; Place |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=198–203 |year=2009 |last1=Jen |first1=Min Hua |last2=Jones |first2=Kelvyn |last3=Johnston |first3=Ron }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* He has argued against [[Growth in a Time of Debt]] thesis and (with Andy Bell) re-analyzed the Reinhart and Rogoff data to show that the evidence for many counties is that the relationship is around the other way - the lack of growth produces debt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/jeg/lbu005 |title=Stylised fact or situated messiness? The diverse effects of increasing debt on national economic growth |journal=Journal of Economic Geography |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=449–72 |year=2015 |last1=Bell |first1=Andrew |last2=Johnston |first2=Ron |last3=Jones |first3=Kelvyn }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the relationship between debt and growth varies significantly between countries, meaning that an average "rule", such as that suggested by Reinhart and Rogoff, has little meaning or policy relevance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Kelvyn |last1=Jones |first2=Andrew |last2=Bell |first3=Ron |last3=Johnston |date=May 15, 2013 |title=Significant variation across countries means that simple conclusions regarding growth and debt, like those offered by Reinhart &amp; Rogoff, have no policy relevance |url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/debt-and-economic-growth-but-no-geography-a-cautionary-tale/ |work=British Politics and Policy blog }}{{self-published inline|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* With colleagues, he has argued against [[Trevor Phillips]] that the UK is 'sleep walking to segregation', finding that ethnic residential segregation in London for example is decreasing.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/tran.12142 |title=Macro-scale stability with micro-scale diversity: Modelling changing ethnic minority residential segregation - London 2001-2011 |journal=Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=389–402 |year=2016 |last1=Johnston |first1=Ron |last2=Jones |first2=Kelvyn |last3=Manley |first3=David |last4=Owen |first4=Dewi }}&lt;/ref&gt; They dispute that Muslim ghettoes are developing in British cities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0308518X16651873 |title=In search of Britain's Muslim ghettoes |journal=Environment and Planning A |volume=48 |issue=9 |pages=1684–90 |year=2016 |last1=Johnston |first1=Ron |last2=Manley |first2=David |last3=Jones |first3=Kelvyn }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that Australian suburbs are being 'swamped' by Asians and Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00049182.2017.1329383 |title=Are Australia's suburbs swamped by Asians and Muslims? Countering political claims with data |journal=[[Australian Geographer]] |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=1–16 |year=2017 |last1=Forrest |first1=James |last2=Johnston |first2=Ron |last3=Siciliano |first3=Frank |last4=Manley |first4=David |last5=Jones |first5=Kelvyn }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* He has argued that quantitative analysis in the form of [[quantitative geography]] has an important role in emancipatory [[human geography]] (see [[critical geography]]). He has argued that this involves adopting a realist philosophy of science distinguished as [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]] and not [[positivism]]. The arguments are made in "The Practice of Quantitative Methods"&lt;ref&gt;Jones,Kelvyn (2011)The Practice of Quantitative Methods in Somekh, Bridget and Lewin, Cathy (eds.) ''Theory and methods in social research'' Sage Publications Ltd, 201-211, download from https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256801634_The_practice_of_quantitative_methods&lt;/ref&gt; and are further developed and exemplified with colleagues in "Mutual misunderstanding and avoidance, misrepresentations and disciplinary politics: spatial science and quantitative analysis in (United Kingdom) geographical curricula"&lt;ref&gt;Johnston R, Harris R, Jones K, et al (2014) Mutual mis-understanding and avoidance, mis-representations, and disciplinary politics: spatial science and quantitative analysis in (UK) geographical curricula. Dialogues in Human Geography 4(1): 3–25 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261054447&lt;/ref&gt; and a subsequent extended reply to critics in "One step forward but two steps back to the proper appreciation of spatial science".&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, R, et al. (2014) "One step forward but two steps back to the proper appreciation of spatial science." Dialogues in Human Geography 4.1 (2014): 59-69. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261062153&lt;/ref&gt; One commentator described this as "an extraordinary contribution. This is a panoramic survey of the legacy of half a century of innovation in spatial science—put into a critical, constructive engagement with half a century of innovation in critical social theory".&lt;ref&gt;Wyly, E. 2014. The new quantitative revolution. Dialogues in Human Geography 4(1): 26–38. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2043820614525732&lt;/ref&gt;
* He (with colleagues) has challenged the 'gold standard' that fixed effects should be the standard approach to the analysis of [[Panel data]] and that a Hausman test is an appropriate way of choosing between a [[Fixed effects model]] and a [[Random effects model]]. Somewhat controversially they argue that a particular form of the random effects model (the within-between model or the similar Mundlak model) offers all that fixed effects can provide and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/psrm.2014.7 |title=Explaining Fixed Effects: Random Effects Modeling of Time-Series Cross-Sectional and Panel Data |journal=Political Science Research and Methods |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=133–53 |year=2014 |last1=Bell |first1=Andrew |last2=Jones |first2=Kelvyn }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299604336_Fixed_and_Random_effects_making_an_informed_choice|title=Fixed and Random effects: making an informed choice (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/post/Is_there_some_other_method_other_than_hausman_test_to_decide_which_method_either_fixed_or_random_should_be_adopted_in_panel_data_analysis|title=Is there some other method other than hausman test to decide...|website=ResearchGate.net|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also challenge the Fixed Effects Vector Decomposition (FEVD) model of Plumper and Troeger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/vetroeger/publications/pa2011_pluemper_troeger.pdf|format=PDF|journal=Political Analysis|date=2011|volume=19|issue=2|pages=147–164|doi=10.1093/pan/mpr008|title=Fixed-Effects Vector Decomposition: Properties, Reliability, and Instruments|author1=Thomas Plumper|author2=Vera E. Troeger}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reaction was: "This paper and the instructive controversial over FEVD have shown me that my econometrics training had not - as I once assumed - taught me all that there is to know about fixed effects estimation. In particular, the authors' treatment of 'heterogeneity bias' clarifies the importance of addressing both 'within' and 'between' variation in the data and they make a compelling case for considering both 'individual' and 'ecological' influences".&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Thomas Pugh https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Geoffrey_Pugh/answers&lt;/ref&gt; Another was: "Bizarre and often incorrect paper by two political scientists on the virtues of random-effects over fixed-effects".&lt;ref&gt;Tweet from Amitabh Chandra@amitabhchandra2&lt;/ref&gt; to "You can and should use a well-specified random effects model. Always.".&lt;ref&gt;Panel data within group estimator on StackExchange demonstrates results with [[R (programming language)]] code https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/100168/panel-data-within-group-estimate-individual-fixed-effects-retrieved&lt;/ref&gt;
* He and colleagues argue that group-mean centering in multilevel models can be a useful procedure in random coefficient models,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11135-017-0593-5|title= Understanding and misunderstanding group mean centering: a commentary on Kelley et al.’s dangerous practice |journal=Quality &amp; Quantity |year=2017 |last1=Bell |first1=Andrew |last2=Jones |first2= Kelvyn |last3=Fairbrother |first3= Malcolm }}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby disagreeing that it is a 'dangerous' procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11135-015-0304-z |title=Group-mean-centering independent variables in multi-level models is dangerous |journal=Quality &amp; Quantity |volume=51 |pages=261–83 |year=2016 |last1=Kelley |first1=Jonathan |last2=Evans |first2=M. D. R. |last3=Lowman |first3=Jennifer |last4=Lykes |first4=Valerie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reactions to this critique include "may the Saints &amp; Angels protect us from ever having a paper this thoroughly dismantled"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/polesasunder/status/931602710876639233/|title=Andrew MacDonald on Twitter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Seriously though, if you are interested in multilevel modelling I highly recommend this short, instructive and frankly rather sassy paper." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/polesasunder/status/931609848281817088|title=Andrew MacDonald on Twitter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* He contends that even with population data (e.g. a full enumeration of all pupils in all schools in a country), a statistical inference approach is required to deal with stochastic or natural variation. Observed outcomes are seen as a result of a stochastic process which could produce different results under the same circumstances. It is this underlying process that is of interest and the actual observed values give only an imprecise estimate of this.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s13524-015-0430-1 |pmid=26487190 |pmc=4644210 |title=Ethnic Residential Segregation: A Multilevel, Multigroup, Multiscale Approach Exemplified by London in 2011 |journal=Demography |volume=52 |issue=6 |pages=1995–2019 |year=2015 |last1=Jones |first1=Kelvyn |last2=Johnston |first2=Ron |last3=Manley |first3=David |last4=Owen |first4=Dewi |last5=Charlton |first5=Chris }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/post/Why_cant_a_statistical_test_of_significance_inferential_analysis_be_applied_to_a_population|title=Why can't a statistical test of significance (inferential...|website=ResearchGate.net|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/post/Are_p-values_and_significance_tests_still_meaningful_in_census_data_analysis|title=Are p-values and significance tests still meaningful in...|website=ResearchGate.net|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Working with Andy Bell, he has argued that the multilevel model (in the form of the hierarchical-age–period–cohort (HAPC) model) is not an automatic solution to the identification problem of the age period cohort model. This third-party site considers some earlier papers in the exchange between Bell and Jones and Yang and Land,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maksimrudnev.com/2015/07/20/recent-clarifications-in-age-period-cohort-analysis/|title=Recent clarifications in age-period-cohort analysis|first=Dwayne Woods|last=says|date=20 July 2015|website=Makimrudnev.com|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while this most recent paper gives in Table 1 the key papers (and arguments made).;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11135-017-0488-5  |title=The hierarchical age–period–cohort model: Why does it find the results that it finds?  |journal=Quality &amp; Quantity  |year=2017  |last1=Bell  |first1=Andrew  |last2=Jones  |first2=Kelvyn  }}&lt;/ref&gt; the full list of papers that Bell and Jones have written are available for download from Research Gate.&lt;ref&gt;Age-period- cohort project site on Research Gate: https://www.researchgate.net/project/Age-period-cohort&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic work and projects ==
He researches in three main areas:&lt;ref&gt;These are listed on his University of Bristol website: http://www.bristol.ac.uk/geography/people/kelvyn-jones/research.html&lt;/ref&gt;

* Geography of health: particularly geographical inequalities in mortality in advanced economies;
* Research design: especially to develop evidence-based research in non-experimental, observational studies;
* Realistically complex modelling: this research work focuses on the quantitative analysis of social-science data with complex structure, particularly when there are many levels of analysis such as panels, spatial series, and space-time series.

Many lives have been lost by [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]] crews going to the aid of people and vessels in distress at sea and around the coasts of Britain and Ireland ([[UK]], [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Channel Islands]] and the [[Isle of Man]]), mainly but not exclusively in the service of the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution]] (RNLI). More than 600 names are inscribed on the RNLI Memorial at RNLI HQ, Poole.&lt;ref name=heritage&gt;{{cite web|title=The RNLI Heritage Trust preserves the history of the RNLI|url=http://rnli.org/aboutus/historyandheritage/Pages/Heritage-Trust.aspx|accessdate=5 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505165105/http://www.rnli.org/aboutus/historyandheritage/Pages/Heritage-Trust.aspx|archivedate=5 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some losses predate the RNLI (founded in 1824).

==19th century==
In the 19th century, lifeboats were almost exclusively oar and sail powered. Self-righting boats had been developed but were not yet widely adopted.

This is a list of people who have served as [[mayor]] or president of the [[city council]] of the city of [[Sarajevo]], the capital of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Sarajevo has had 37 different mayors since the position was created on 22 August 1878, upon [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] [[Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878|occupation]].

==History==
The first mayor of Sarajevo [[Mustafa Fadilpašić]] was also the city's longest-served mayor, having remained in the position for 14 years. The only mayor to serve more than once was [[Edhem Bičakčić]], who was mayor from 1928–29, then again from 1935–39. The first non-[[Bosniak]] mayor was [[Aristotel Petrović]] (1918–1920). [[Semiha Borovac]] became Sarajevo's first female mayor in 2005. [[Fehim Čurčić]], the city's fifth mayor, served during [[World War I]]. In 1941, Atih Hadžikadić was elected mayor, a position that was short-lived as he was hanged during [[World War II]] in August 1941.

The '''list of shipwrecks in the [[Channel Islands]]''' lists some of the [[ship]]s that wrecked on or sank in the waters of the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]] and the [[Bailiwick of Jersey]]. The list includes ships that sustained a damaged hull, which were later refloated and repaired.

[[Jersey]] experiences some of the largest tidal ranges in the world, up to 12 metres;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-26390204 |title=Channel Islands flooded after 'highest tide of the year'}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guernsey]] has slightly less dramatic tides. The mass of water moving in and out gives rise to fast moving currents. Alderney has the [[Alderney Race]], which can run up to about twelve knots during equinoctial tides. These combined with the numerous smaller islands, offshore reefs, and isolated rocks extending up to {{convert|13|mi|km}} from the main islands, as well as the Islands' location close to the [[English Channel]] shipping channels, has resulted in thousands of shipwrecks over the centuries.

The Bailiwick of Guernsey comprises the islands of [[Guernsey]], [[Alderney]], [[Sark]], [[Herm]] and a number of smaller islands, islets and rocks. See [[List of islands of the Bailiwick of Guernsey]] for a complete list of their smaller islands.

[[Les Casquets]] or (The) '''Casquets''' ({{IPAc-en|k|æ|s|ˈ|k|ɛ|t|s}} {{respell|kas|KETS|'}}); is a group of [[islet|rock]]s 13&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Alderney]] and are part of an underwater [[sandstone]] ridge. Other parts which emerge above the water are the islets of [[Burhou]] and [[Ortac]]. Little vegetation grows on them.

The Bailiwick of Jersey comprises the island of [[Jersey]] and a number of smaller islets and rocks, most of which are covered at high tide. See [[List of islands of the Bailiwick of Jersey]] for a complete list of their smaller islands.

[[Les Écréhous]] NE of [[Jersey]] consists of two reefs which form an extensive shoal area {{convert|7|mi|km}} long and {{convert|2.3|mi|km}} wide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jersey.com/english/discoverjersey/sightseeing/Pages/Les-Ecrehous.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Les Minquiers]] {{convert|9|mi|km}} S of [[Jersey]], its largest island is only 50 metres by 20 metres, but at low water, [[Les Minquiers]] has a land area greater than 100[[km²]].

The deliberate [[Wrecking (shipwreck)|wrecking]] of ships has not been a [[Channel Island]] trait, although the recovery of goods from a natural wreck has always been undertaken. [[Smuggling]] and [[Privateer]]'s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.priaulxlibrary.co.uk/articles/article/prizes |title=Prizes}}&lt;/ref&gt; have abounded in the Islands' waters over many centuries.

Modern navigation systems have helped reduce the number of disasters, but shipping still receive warnings of waters around the Channel Islands&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msi.nga.mil/MSISiteContent/StaticFiles/NAV_PUBS/SD/Pub191/Pub191bk.pdf |title=PUB. 191 SAILING DIRECTIONS (ENROUTE) ENGLISH CHANNEL |date=2014 |publisher=NATIONAL GEOSPATIAL-INTELLIGENCE AGENCY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All passengers and crew took to the lifeboats and were rescued. On 15 September 1850, the steam tug Polka was hurriedly pressed into service to make the daily run to St. Malo as Superb was undergoing repairs at St. Helier. When she was about halfway to her destination, Polka sprang a leak and began to sink whereupon her master, Captain Priaulx, calmly loaded everyone into the two lifeboats and landed them safely on the nearby Mâitre Ile. Picked up and taken into St. Malo the next day, the survivors counted themselves extremely fortunate and lavished both praise and a sizeable reward upon Captain Priaulx for his admirable seamanship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/10693/lot/79/ |title=Philip John Ouless (British, 1817-1885)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?119256 |title =Polka [+1850] |publisher=wrecksite.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;small&gt;On 17 September, only two days after the sinking of the PSS Polka, Superb left St. Malo with sixty passengers and crew aboard, including Captain Priaulx and several of the other survivors from the Polka. As they approached the Minquiers Reef, Superbs’ mate (John Fleming) was persuaded by some of the passengers to show them where the Polka had gone down but unfortunately, as he took Superb through the so-called eastern passage, she struck a rock known as La Pointue du Blanc Roc which tore deep into her hull. In the ensuing panic to load the lifeboats, twenty people lost their lives, four of whom had barely recovered from their experiences on the sinking Polka two days previously. Ironically, Superb herself remained stranded on the rock and the survivors including, once again, Captain Priaulx, were plucked straight off the decks by the rescue ships sent out from St. Helier. As an interesting postscript, one small vestige of Superb lived on after her boilers were salvaged and subsequently installed into one of her successors, another paddle steamer, the Rose, which took her name from Thomas Rose, the owner of the company.

One of the earliest steamships operating in the waters around the Channel Islands, the Superb was owned by the Jersey Steam Packet Company of St. Helier which ran her on their scheduled Jersey to St. Malo [and Granville] mail and passenger service.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/10693/lot/79/ |title =Philip John Ouless (British, 1817-1885)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YD2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.calameo.com/read/0008025524289752f2748 |title=Dictionnaire des naufrages dans la Manche |author=YvesDufiel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;small&gt;Shortly before 9am the steamer was observed just off Elizabeth Castle which, with the hermitage forms an outwork of rock a short distance from the entrance to Victoria Harbour, [[Jersey]]. The tide was just beginning to flow. the Captain (Hemmings) asked the pilot which passage he was going to take. The Sellette or the middle passage. The Pilot replied that he would take whichever passage the Captain chose to which the latter replied that it was not his province to interfere, adding that it was high time the pilot made up his mind. The Captain again warned the pilot of the danger which was now clearly apparent. This warning was scarcely off his lips when the vessel struck on a rock known as ´GRUNE VAUDIN´. The engines were stopped and set for astern.

It was then the captain ordered the lifeboats to be lowered. Ten minutes after the vessel struck, she went down in 5 fathoms of water. The Paris was valued at £7000 and was not insured. The masts of the sunken vessel were clearly visible from the shore.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name=YD2008/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?82895#15728 | title =PSS Paris [+1863] |publisher=wrecksite.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of bodies were washed ashore in Guernsey and given, by the Germans, a military funeral at le Foulon cemetery.

&lt;small&gt;British Navy, cruiser built in 1940 accompanied by the destroyer Limbourne and five other vessels (Grenville, Rocket, Talybont, Stevenstone and Wensleydale) was engaged in an offensive sweep off the French coast between Ushant (Ouessant) and the Channel Islands on the night of 23 October 1943.

The Force had been tracked by German radar and torpedo boats were sent to intercept. Visibility was poor and the vessels ran into the enemy light force of the German 4th TB Flotilla which managed to avoid their fire and to discharge a salvo of torpedoes with disastrous effect. The Charybdis was struck on port side by a torpedo, followed about five minutes later by another. She turned over and sank by the stern. Thirty officers, including the Captain and 432 ratings were killed. Only four officers and 103 ratings were saved.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name="hmswensleydale1943"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hmswensleydale.co.uk/charybdis.htm |title=23rd OF OCTOBER 1943: THE SINKING OF HMS CHARYBDIS AND HMS LIMBOURNE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of songs about [[Jerusalem]]''', including major parts of the city such as individual neighborhoods and sections. Religiously significant to all three [[Abrahamic religion]]s for centuries and politically controversial since the inception of the [[zionism|Zionist movement]], Jerusalem has been artistically associated with widely varied concepts. There are many songs about Jerusalem from various time periods, especially [[nationalism|nationalistically]]-themed songs from the time of the [[Six-Day War]], when [[East Jerusalem]] passed from [[Jordan]]ian control to [[Israel]]i. 

Additionally many [[Tanakh|Biblical]] [[Psalms]], styled as songs, were written specifically about Jerusalem. Jewish liturgy and hymns are rife with references to Jerusalem.

The '''[[Territory of the United States Virgin Islands]]''' is an [[Territories of the United States#Unincorporated organized territories|unincorporated organized territory]] of the [[United States of America]] located in the western portion of the [[Virgin Islands Archipelago]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]].&lt;ref name=CIA_World_Factbook&gt;{{cite web|date=July 9, 2009|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/vq.html|title=Virgin Islands|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=[[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=July 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Virgin Islands are part of the [[Leeward Islands]] of the [[Lesser Antilles]].  The [[British Virgin Islands]] comprises the eastern portion of the [[archipelago]].

The U.S. Virgin Islands consist of the main islands of [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Croix]], [[Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint John]] and [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas]], along with the much smaller but historically distinct [[Water Island, U.S. Virgin Islands|Water Island]], and many other surrounding [[Minor islands of the U.S. Virgin Islands|minor islands]]. The total land area of the territory is 346.36&amp;nbsp;km² (133.73 sq mi). As of the [[United States Census Bureau|2000 census]] the population was 108,612.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/2001/cb01cn172.html 2000 Population Counts for the U.S. Virgin Islands], U.S. Census Bureau.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the main islands have nicknames often used by locals: "Rock City" (St. Thomas), "Love City" (St. John), and "Twin City" (St. Croix).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = CANOE.ca | last = Slawych | first = Diane | title = Love is in the air | accessdate = 2008-01-25 | url = http://travel.canoe.ca/Travel/Activities/Romantic/2004/02/11/343943.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Singapore from above.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|alt=Shipping at Singapore Harbour|Seas have always been essential for human development and trade, as at Singapore with [[Port of Singapore|its harbour]] ([[List of world's busiest transshipment ports|the world's busiest transshipment port]]) and the important [[Malaccamax|shipping lanes]] through the [[Singapore Strait]] and the [[Strait of Malacca]].]]

The '''sea''', the '''world ocean''' or simply the '''ocean''' is the connected [[body of water|body]] of [[saline water|salty water]] that covers over 70 percent of the Earth's surface. It moderates the Earth's climate and has important roles in the [[water cycle]], [[carbon cycle]], and [[nitrogen cycle]].  It has been travelled and explored since ancient times, while the scientific study of the sea—[[oceanography]]—dates broadly from the voyages of Captain [[James Cook]] to explore the [[Pacific Ocean]] between 1768 and 1779. The word "sea" is also used to denote smaller, partly landlocked sections of the ocean.

The most abundant solid dissolved in sea water is [[sodium chloride]]. The water also contains [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]]s of [[magnesium]], [[calcium]], and [[potassium]], amongst many other elements, some in minute concentrations. [[Salinity]] varies widely, being lower near the surface and the mouths of large rivers and higher in the depths of the ocean; however the relative proportions of dissolved salts varies little across the [[ocean]]s. Winds blowing over the surface of the sea produce [[Wind wave|waves]], which [[Breaking wave|break]] when they enter shallow water. Winds also create surface currents through friction, setting up slow but stable circulations of water throughout the oceans. The directions of the circulation are governed by factors including the shapes of the continents and the rotation of the earth (the [[Coriolis effect]]). Deep-sea currents, known as the [[Thermohaline circulation|global conveyor belt]], carry cold water from near the poles to every ocean. [[Tide]]s, the generally twice-daily rise and fall of sea levels, are caused by the rotation of the Earth and the gravitational effects of the orbiting Moon, and to a lesser extent of the Sun. Tides may have a very high range in bays or estuaries. Submarine [[earthquakes]] arising from [[tectonic plate]] movements under the oceans can lead to destructive [[tsunami]]s, as can volcanoes, huge landslides or the impact of large [[meteorite]]s.

A wide variety of organisms, including bacteria, [[protists]], algae, plants, fungi and animals, live in the sea, which offers a wide range of [[marine habitats]] and [[ecosystem]]s, ranging vertically from the sunlit surface waters and the shoreline to the enormous depths and pressures of the cold, dark [[abyssal zone]], and in latitude from the cold waters under the [[Arctic]] ice to the colourful diversity of [[coral reefs]] in tropical regions. Many of the major groups of organisms evolved in the sea and [[Origin of life|life may have started]] there.

The sea provides substantial supplies of food for humans, mainly [[fish]], but also [[shellfish]], [[marine mammal|mammal]]s and [[seaweed]], whether caught by fishermen or [[aquaculture|farmed]] underwater. Other human uses of the sea include [[shipping|trade]], travel, [[Subsea (technology)|mineral extraction]], [[Electricity generation|power generation]], [[Naval warfare|warfare]], and leisure activities such as [[Human swimming|swimming]], [[sailing]] and [[scuba diving]]. Many of these activities create [[marine pollution]]. The sea is important in human culture, with major appearances in literature at least since [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', in [[marine art]], in cinema, in theatre and in classical music. Symbolically, the sea appears as monsters such as [[Scylla]] in [[mythology]] and represents the [[unconscious mind]] in [[dream interpretation]].

Although the amount of salt in the ocean remains relatively constant within the scale of millions of years, various factors affect the salinity of a body of water.&lt;ref name="setalleyduauang"/&gt; Evaporation and by-product of ice formation (known as "brine rejection") increase salinity, whereas [[precipitation]], sea ice melt, and runoff from land reduce it.&lt;ref name="setalleyduauang"&gt;{{cite book|last=Talley|first=Lynne D |editor1-last= MacCracken |editor1-first= Michael C|editor2-last= Perry|editor2-first= John S| chapter=Salinity Patterns in the Ocean |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2002 |pages=629–630|title=Encyclopedia of Global Environmental Change, Volume 1, The Earth System: Physical and Chemical Dimensions of Global Environmental Change|isbn=0-471-97796-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Baltic Sea]], for example, has many rivers flowing into it, and thus the sea could be considered as [[brackish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Feistel|first1=R |author2=et al. |title=Density and Absolute Salinity of the Baltic Sea 2006–2009|journal=Ocean Science |volume=6|year=2010|pages=3–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Red Sea is very salty due to its high evaporation rate.&lt;ref name="noaaaa"&gt;NOAA (11 Jan 2013). "[http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/drinksw.html Drinking Seawater Can Be Deadly to Humans]".&lt;/ref&gt;

Sea temperature depends on the amount of solar radiation falling on its surface. In the tropics, with the sun nearly overhead, the temperature of the surface layers can rise to over {{convert|30|°C}} while near the poles the temperature in equilibrium with the sea ice is about {{convert|-2|°C}}. There is a continuous circulation of water in the oceans. Warm surface currents cool as they move away from the tropics, and the water becomes denser and sinks. The cold water moves back towards the equator as a deep sea current, driven by changes in the temperature and density of the water, before eventually welling up again towards the surface. Deep seawater has a temperature between {{convert|-2|°C}} and {{convert|5|°C}} in all parts of the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eesc.columbia.edu/courses/ees/climate/lectures/o_circ.html |title=Ocean Circulation |author=Gordon, Arnold |year=2004 |work=The Climate System |publisher=Columbia University |accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seawater with a typical salinity of 35‰ has a freezing point of about −1.8&amp;nbsp;°C (28.8&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waterencyclopedia.com/Re-St/Sea-Water-Freezing-of.html |title=Sea Water, Freezing of|publisher=Water Encyclopedia|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When its temperature becomes low enough, [[ice crystals]] form on the surface. These break into small pieces and coalesce into flat discs that form a thick suspension known as [[frazil]]. In calm conditions this freezes into a thin flat sheet known as [[nilas]], which thickens as new ice forms on its underside. In more turbulent seas, frazil crystals join together into flat discs known as pancakes. These slide under each other and coalesce to form [[Drift ice|floes]]. In the process of freezing, salt water and air are trapped between the ice crystals. Nilas may have a salinity of 12–15&amp;nbsp;‰, but by the time the [[sea ice]] is one year old, this falls to 4–6&amp;nbsp;‰.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/939404/sea-ice |title=Sea ice |author=Jeffries, Martin O. |year=2012 |work=Encyclopedia Britannica |publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of oxygen found in seawater depends primarily on the plants growing in it. These are mainly algae, including [[phytoplankton]], with some [[vascular plant]]s such as [[seagrass]]es. In daylight the [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic activity]] of these plants produces oxygen, which dissolves in the seawater and is used by marine animals. At night, photosynthesis stops, and the amount of dissolved oxygen declines. In the deep sea, where insufficient light penetrates for plants to grow, there is very little dissolved oxygen. In its absence, organic material is broken down by [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] bacteria producing [[hydrogen sulphide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smhi.se/en/theme/oxygen-in-the-sea-1.11274 |title=Oxygen in the Sea |date=3 June 2010 |publisher=Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute |accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global warming is likely to reduce levels of oxygen in surface waters, since the solubility of oxygen in water falls at higher temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Long-term ocean oxygen depletion in response to carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels | author=Shaffer, Gary; Olsen, Steffen Malskær; Pedersen, Jens Olaf Pepke | journal=Nature Geoscience | year=2009 | volume=2 | issue=2 | pages=105–109 | doi=10.1038/ngeo420|bibcode = 2009NatGe...2..105S }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The amount of light that penetrates the sea depends on the angle of the sun, the weather conditions and the [[turbidity]] of the water. Much light gets reflected at the surface, and red light gets absorbed in the top few metres. Yellow and green light reach greater depths, and blue and violet light may penetrate as deep as {{convert|1000|m}}. There is insufficient light for photosynthesis and plant growth beyond a depth of about {{convert|200|m}}.&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;{{cite book |title=The Seas |last=Russell |first=F.

[[File:Propagation du tsunami en profondeur variable.gif|thumb|alt=Diagram showing wave approaching shore|When the wave enters shallow water, it slows down and its amplitude (height) increases.]]
{{Main|Wind wave}}

Wind blowing over the surface of a body of water forms [[Wind wave|waves]] that are perpendicular to the direction of the wind. The friction between air and water caused by a gentle breeze on a pond causes [[Capillary wave|ripples]] to form. A strong blow over the ocean causes larger waves as the moving air pushes against the raised ridges of water. The waves reach their maximum height when the rate at which they are travelling nearly matches the speed of the wind. In open water, when the wind blows continuously as happens in the Southern Hemisphere in the [[Roaring Forties]], long, organised masses of water called [[Swell (ocean)|swell]] roll across the ocean.&lt;ref name=Stow/&gt;{{rp|pages=83–84}}&lt;ref name="NOAA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/edu/learning/player/lesson09.html |title=Ocean waves |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |work=Ocean Explorer |accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Wind Generated Ocean Waves | first=I.

Gradually, they fall in with other waves travelling at similar speed—-where different waves are in phase they reinforce each other, and where out of phase they are reduced.

The top of a wave is known as the crest, the lowest point between waves is the trough and the distance between the crests is the wavelength. The wave is pushed across the surface of the sea by the wind, but this represents a transfer of energy and not a horizontal movement of water. As waves approach land and [[waves and shallow water|move into shallow water]], they change their behavior. If approaching at an angle, waves may bend ([[refraction]]) or wrap rocks and headlands ([[diffraction]]). When the wave reaches a point where its deepest oscillations of the water contact the [[seabed]], they begin to slow down. This pulls the crests closer together and increases the [[wave height|waves' height]], which is called [[wave shoaling]]. When the ratio of the wave's height to the water depth increases above a certain limit, it "[[wave breaking|breaks]]", toppling over in a mass of foaming water.&lt;ref name=mrgarrison/&gt; This rushes in a sheet up the beach before retreating into the sea under the influence of gravity.&lt;ref name=NOAA /&gt;

===Tsunami===
{{Main|Tsunami}}

A tsunami is an unusual form of wave caused by an infrequent powerful event such as an underwater earthquake or landslide, a meteorite impact, a volcanic eruption or a collapse of land into the sea. These events can temporarily lift or lower the surface of the sea in the affected area, usually by a few feet. The potential energy of the displaced seawater is turned into kinetic energy, creating a shallow wave, a tsunami, radiating outwards at a velocity proportional to the square root of the depth of the water and which therefore travels much faster in the open ocean than on a continental shelf.&lt;ref name="usgstsunami"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/tsunami/basics.html |title=Life of a Tsunami |work=Tsunamis &amp; Earthquakes |publisher=US Geological Survey |accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the deep open sea, tsunamis have wavelengths of around {{convert|80|to|300|mi|km}}, travel at speeds of over 600 miles per hour (970&amp;nbsp;km/hr)&lt;ref name=NTWC-physics/&gt; and usually have a height of less than three feet, so they often pass unnoticed at this stage.&lt;ref name=UoW&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthweb.ess.washington.edu/tsunami/general/physics/physics.html |title=The Physics of Tsunamis |work=Earth and Space Sciences |publisher=University of Washington |accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, ocean surface waves caused by winds have wavelengths of a few hundred feet, travel at up to {{convert|65|mph|kph}} and are up to {{convert|45|ft|m|abbr=off}} high.&lt;ref name=UoW/&gt;

A trigger event on the continental shelf may cause a local tsunami on the land side and a distant tsunami that travels out across the ocean. The energy of the wave is dissipated only gradually, but is spread out over the wave front, so as the wave radiates away from the source, the front gets longer and the average energy reduces, so distant shores will, on average, be hit by weaker waves. However, as the speed of the wave is controlled by the water depth, it does not travel at the same speed in all directions, and this affects the direction of the wave front - an effect known as [[refraction]] - which can focus the strength of the advancing tsunami on some areas and weaken it in others according to undersea topography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livescience.com/18998-deep-ocean-floor-focus-tsunami-waves.html |title=Deep Ocean Floor Can Focus Tsunami Waves |author=Our Amazing Planet staff |date=12 March 2012 |work=Livescience |accessdate=4 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Berry, M.

[[File:2004-tsunami.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Tsunami in Thailand|The [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 tsunami]] in Thailand]]
As a tsunami [[Wave shoaling|moves into shallower water]] its speed decreases, its wavelength shortens and its amplitude increases enormously,&lt;ref name=UoW/&gt; behaving in the same way as a wind-generated wave in shallow water, but on a vastly greater scale.  Either the trough or the crest of a tsunami can arrive at the coast first.&lt;ref name=usgstsunami/&gt; In the former case, the sea draws back and leaves subtidal areas close to the shore exposed which provides a useful warning for people on land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/tsunami/info/index.shtml |title=Tsunami Facts and Information |publisher =[[Bureau of Meteorology]] of the Australian Government |accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the crest arrives, it does not usually break but rushes inland, flooding all in its path. Much of the destruction may be caused by the flood water draining back into the sea after the tsunami has struck, dragging debris and people with it. Often several tsunami are caused by a single geological event and arrive at intervals of between eight minutes and two hours. The first wave to arrive on shore may not be the biggest or most destructive.&lt;ref name=usgstsunami/&gt;  Occasionally, a tsunami may transform into a [[Tidal bore|bore]], typically in a shallow bay or an estuary.&lt;ref name=NTWC-physics&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ntwc.arh.noaa.gov/?page=tsunami_science |title=Physics of Tsunamis |publisher=[[National Tsunami Warning Center]] of the USA |date=  |accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Currents===
[[File:Corrientes-oceanicas.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|alt=Map showing surface currents|Surface currents: red–warm, blue–cold]]
{{main|Ocean current}}
Wind blowing over the surface of the sea causes [[friction]] at the interface between air and sea. Not only does this cause waves to form but it also makes the surface seawater move in the same direction as the wind. Although winds are variable, in any one place they predominantly blow from a single direction and thus a surface current can be formed. Westerly winds are most frequent in the mid-latitudes while easterlies dominate the tropics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Meteorology Today: An Introduction to Weather, Climate, and the Environment |last=Ahrens |first=C. Donald |last2=Jackson |first2=Peter Lawrence |last3=Jackson |first3=Christine E. J. |last4=Jackson |first4=Christine E.

There are five main gyres in the world's oceans: two in the Pacific, two in the Atlantic and one in the Indian Ocean. Other smaller gyres are found in lesser seas and a single gyre flows around [[Antarctica]]. These gyres have followed the same routes for millennia, guided by the [[topography]] of the land, the wind direction and the [[Coriolis effect]]. The surface currents flow in a clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and anticlockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. The water moving away from the equator is warm, and that flowing in the reverse direction has lost most of its heat. These currents tend to moderate the Earth's climate, cooling the equatorial region and warming regions at higher latitudes.&lt;ref name=NOAAcurrent&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/edu/learning/player/lesson08.html |title=Ocean Currents |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |work=Ocean Explorer |accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global climate and [[weather forecasting|weather forecasts]] are powerfully affected by the world ocean, so [[global climate model]]ling makes use of [[List of ocean circulation models|ocean circulation models]] as well as models of other major components such as the [[atmosphere]], land surfaces, aerosols and sea ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6320515.stm | title=Models 'key to climate forecasts' | publisher=BBC | date=2 February 2007 | accessdate=8 September 2013 | author=Pope, Vicky}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ocean models make use of a branch of physics, [[geophysical fluid dynamics]], that describes the large-scale flow of fluids such as seawater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Introduction to Geophysical Fluid Dynamics: Physical and Numerical Aspects | publisher=Academic Press | author=Cushman-Roisin, Benoit; Beckers, Jean-Marie | year=2011 | isbn=978-0-12-088759-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thermohaline Circulation 2.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Alt=Map showing the global conveyor belt|The global conveyor belt shown in blue with warmer surface currents in red]]
Surface currents only affect the top few hundred metres (yards) of the sea, but there are also large-scale flows in the ocean depths caused by the movement of deep water masses. A main deep ocean current flows through all the world's oceans and is known as the [[thermohaline circulation]] or global conveyor belt. This movement is slow and is driven by differences in density of the water caused by variations in salinity and temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wunsch, Carl |year=2002 |title=What is the thermohaline circulation? |journal=Science |volume=298 |issue=5596 |pages=1179–1181 |doi=10.1126/science.1079329 |pmid=12424356 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At high latitudes the water is chilled by the low atmospheric temperature and becomes saltier as sea ice crystallizes out. Both these factors make it denser, and the water sinks. From the deep sea near Greenland, such water flows southwards between the continental landmasses on either side of the Atlantic. When it reaches the Antarctic, it is joined by further masses of cold, sinking water and flows eastwards. It then splits into two streams that move northwards into the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Here it is gradually warmed, becomes less dense, rises towards the surface and loops back on itself. Some flows back into the Atlantic. It takes a thousand years for this circulation pattern to be completed.&lt;ref name=NOAAcurrent/&gt;

Besides gyres, there are temporary surface currents that occur under specific conditions. When waves meet a shore at an angle, a [[Longshore drift|longshore current]] is created as water is pushed along parallel to the coastline. The water swirls up onto the beach at right angles to the approaching waves but drains away straight down the slope under the effect of gravity. The larger the breaking waves, the longer the beach and the more oblique the wave approach, the stronger is the longshore current.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usoceansafety.com/safety/popup/lscurrent.asp |title=Long-shore currents |year=2007 |publisher=Orange County Lifeguards |accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These currents can shift great volumes of sand or pebbles, create [[Spit (landform)|spits]] and make beaches disappear and water channels silt up.&lt;ref name=NOAAcurrent/&gt; A [[rip current]] can occur when water piles up near the shore from advancing waves and is funnelled out to sea through a channel in the seabed. It may occur at a gap in a [[Shoal|sandbar]] or near a man-made structure such as a [[groyne]]. These strong currents can have a velocity of {{convert|3|ft|1|abbr=on}} per second, can form at different places at different stages of the tide and can carry away unwary bathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ceoe.udel.edu/ripcurrents/characteristics/ |title=Rip current characteristics |work=Rip currents |publisher=University of Delaware Sea Grant College Program |accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temporary upwelling currents occur when the wind pushes water away from the land and deeper water rises to replace it. This cold water is often rich in nutrients and creates blooms of phytoplankton and a great increase in the productivity of the sea.&lt;ref name=NOAAcurrent/&gt;

===Tides===
{{main|Tide}}
[[File:Tides overview.png|thumb|left|upright|alt=Diagram showing how the sun and moon cause tides|High tides (blue) at the nearest and furthest points of the Earth from the Moon]]
Tides are the regular rise and fall in water level experienced by seas and oceans in response to the [[Gravity|gravitational]] influences of the Moon and the Sun, and the effects of the Earth's rotation. During each tidal cycle, at any given place the water rises to a maximum height known as "high tide" before ebbing away again to the minimum "low tide" level. As the water recedes, it uncovers more and more of the [[foreshore]], also known as the intertidal zone. The difference in height between the high tide and low tide is known as the [[tidal range]] or tidal amplitude.&lt;ref name=oceanservice&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/tutorial_tides/ |title=Tides and Water Levels |work=NOAA Oceans and Coasts |publisher=NOAA Ocean Service Education |accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.arctic.uoguelph.ca/cpe/environments/marine_water/features/Tides/amplitude.htm | title=Tidal amplitudes | publisher=University of Guelph | accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most places experience two high tides each day, occurring at intervals of about 12 hours and 25 minutes. This is half the 24 hours and 50 minute period that it takes for the Earth to make a complete revolution and return the Moon to its previous position relative to an observer. The Moon's mass is some 27&amp;nbsp;million times smaller than the Sun, but it is 400 times closer to the Earth.&lt;ref name=NOAAtides&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/edu/learning/player/lesson10.html |title=Tides |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |work=Ocean Explorer |accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tidal force|Tidal force or tide-raising force]] decreases rapidly with distance, so the moon has more than twice as great an effect on tides as the Sun.&lt;ref name=NOAAtides/&gt; A bulge is formed in the ocean at the place where the Earth is closest to the Moon, because it is also where the effect of the Moon's gravity is stronger. On the opposite side of the Earth, the lunar force is at its weakest and this causes another bulge to form. As the Moon rotates around the Earth, so do these ocean bulges move around the Earth. The gravitational attraction of the Sun is also working on the seas, but its effect on tides is less powerful than that of the Moon, and when the Sun, Moon and Earth are all aligned (full moon and new moon), the combined effect results in the high "spring tides". In contrast, when the Sun is at 90° from the Moon as viewed from Earth, the combined gravitational effect on tides is less causing the lower "neap tides".&lt;ref name=oceanservice/&gt;

Tidal flows of seawater are resisted by the water's [[inertia]] and can be affected by land masses. In places like the [[Gulf of Mexico]] where land constrains the movement of the bulges, only one set of tides may occur each day. Inshore from an island there may be a complex daily cycle with four high tides. The island straits at [[Halkis|Chalkis]] on [[Evvia|Euboea]] experience strong currents which abruptly switch direction, generally four times per day but up to 12 times per day when the moon and the sun are 90 degrees apart.&lt;ref name=EuripusStraits&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1929AN....236..321E | title=The problem of the tide of Euripus | author=Eginitis, D. | journal=Astronomische Nachrichten | year=1929 | volume=236 | pages=321–328|bibcode = 1929AN....236..321E | doi=10.1002/asna.19292361904 | issue=19–20 }} See also the commentary about this explanation in {{cite journal | title=Les marées de l'Euripe | author=Lagrange, E. | journal=Ciel et Terre (Bulletin of the Société Belge d'Astronomie) | year=1930 |language=French | volume=46 | pages=66–69 | bibcode=1930C&amp;T....46...66L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where there is a funnel-shaped bay or estuary, the tidal range can be magnified. The [[Bay of Fundy]] is the classic example of this and can experience spring tides of {{convert|15|m|0|abbr=on}}. Although tides are regular and predictable, the height of high tides can be lowered by offshore winds and raised by onshore winds. The high pressure at the centre of an [[anticyclone]]s pushes down on the water and is associated with abnormally low tides while [[low-pressure area]]s may cause extremely high tides.&lt;ref name=oceanservice/&gt; A [[storm surge]] can occur when high winds pile water up against the coast in a shallow area and this, coupled with a low pressure system, can raise the surface of the sea at high tide dramatically. In 1900, [[Galveston, Texas]] experienced a {{convert|15|ft|0|abbr=on}} surge during a [[1900 Galveston hurricane|hurricane]] that overwhelmed the city, killing over 3,500 people and destroying 3,636 homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.noaa.gov/stories_tales/cline2.html |title=Galveston Storm of 1900 |author=Cline, Isaac M. |date=4 February 2004 |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ocean basins===
[[File:Tectonic plate boundaries.png|thumb|right|300px|Three types of plate boundary]]
The Earth is composed of a magnetic central [[Planetary core|core]], a mostly liquid [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] and a hard rigid outer shell (or  [[lithosphere]]), which is composed of the Earth's rocky [[Crust (geology)|crust]] and the deeper mostly solid outer layer of the mantle. On land the crust is known as the [[continental crust]] while under the sea it is known as the [[oceanic crust]]. The latter is composed of relatively dense [[basalt]] and is some five to ten kilometres (three to six miles) thick. The relatively thin lithosphere floats on the weaker and hotter mantle below and is fractured into a number of [[tectonic plates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/156285/ |title=Structure of the Earth |author=Pidwirny, Michael |date=28 March 2013 |work=The Encyclopedia of Earth |accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-ocean, magma is constantly being thrust through the seabed between adjoining plates to form [[mid-oceanic ridge]]s and here convection currents within the mantle tend to drive the two plates apart. Parallel to these ridges and nearer the coasts, one oceanic plate may slide beneath another oceanic plate in a process known as [[subduction]]. Deep [[Oceanic trench|trenches]] are formed here and the process is accompanied by friction as the plates grind together. The movement proceeds in jerks which cause earthquakes, heat is produced and [[magma]] is forced up creating underwater mountains, some of which may form chains of volcanic islands near to deep trenches. Near some of the boundaries between the land and sea, the slightly denser oceanic plates slide beneath the continental plates and more subduction trenches are formed. As they grate together, the continental plates are deformed and buckle causing mountain building and seismic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/155264/ |title=Plate tectonics |author=Pidwirny, Michael |date=28 March 2013 |work=The Encyclopedia of Earth |accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/geology/tectonics.html |title=Plate Tectonics: The Mechanism |publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology |accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Earth's deepest trench is the [[Mariana Trench]] which extends for about {{convert|2,500|km|miles}} across the seabed. It is near the [[Mariana Islands]], a volcanic [[archipelago]] in the West Pacific, and though it averages just {{convert|68|km}} wide, its deepest point is 10.994 kilometres (nearly 7 miles) below the surface of the sea.&lt;ref name="smmt"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/8940571/Scientists-map-Mariana-Trench-deepest-known-section-of-ocean-in-the-world.html |title=Scientists map Mariana Trench, deepest known section of ocean in the world |accessdate=24 September 2013 |date=7 December 2011 |newspaper=The Telegraph }}&lt;/ref&gt; An even longer trench runs alongside the coast of Peru and Chile, reaching a depth of {{convert|8,065|m}} and extending for approximately {{convert|5900|km}}. It occurs where the oceanic [[Nazca Plate]] slides under the continental [[South American Plate]] and is associated with the upthrust and volcanic activity of the Andes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/453259/Peru-Chile-Trench |title=Peru-Chile Trench  |work=Encyclopedia Britannica |publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coasts===
[[Image:Praia da Marinha 2017.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Praia da Marinha]] in [[Algarve]], [[Portugal]]]]
The zone where land meets sea is known as the [[coast]] and the part between the lowest spring tides and the upper limit reached by splashing waves is the [[shore]]. A [[beach]] is the accumulation of sand or [[Shingle beach|shingle]] on the shore.&lt;ref name=Monkhouse291/&gt; A [[headland]] is a point of land jutting out into the sea and a larger [[promontory]] is known as a [[Cape (geography)|cape]]. The indentation of a coastline, especially between two headlands, is a [[bay]], a small bay with a narrow inlet is a [[cove]] and a large bay may be referred to as a [[List of gulfs|gulf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Penguin Dictionary of Physical Geography |last=Whittow |first=John B. |year=1984 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-051094-2 |pages=29, 80, 246 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coastlines are influenced by a number of factors including the strength of the waves arriving on the shore, the gradient of the land margin, the composition and hardness of the coastal rock, the inclination of the off-shore slope and the changes of the level of the land due to local uplift or submergence. Normally, waves roll towards the shore at the rate of six to eight per minute and these are known as constructive waves as they tend to move material up the beach and have little erosive effect. Storm waves arrive on shore in rapid succession and are known as destructive waves as the [[swash]] moves beach material seawards. Under their influence, the sand and shingle on the beach is ground together and abraded. Around high tide, the power of a storm wave impacting on the foot of a cliff has a shattering effect as air in cracks and crevices is compressed and then expands rapidly with release of pressure. At the same time, sand and pebbles have an erosive effect as they are thrown against the rocks. This tends to undercut the cliff, and normal [[weathering]] processes such as the action of frost follows, causing further destruction. Gradually, a wave-cut platform develops at the foot of the cliff and this has a protective effect, reducing further wave-erosion.&lt;ref name=Monkhouse291&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles of Physical Geography |last=Monkhouse |first=F. J. |year=1975 |publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton |isbn=978-0-340-04944-0 |pages=280–291 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Material worn from the margins of the land eventually ends up in the sea. Here it is subject to [[Attrition (erosion)|attrition]] as currents flowing parallel to the coast scour out channels and transport sand and pebbles away from their place of origin. Sediment carried to the sea by rivers settles on the seabed causing [[River delta|delta]]s to form in estuaries. All these materials move back and forth under the influence of waves, tides and currents.&lt;ref name=Monkhouse291/&gt; Dredging removes material and deepens channels but may have unexpected effects elsewhere on the coastline. Governments make efforts to  prevent flooding of the land by the building of [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]], [[seawall]]s, [[levee|dykes and levees]] and other sea defences. For instance, the [[Thames Barrier]] is designed to protect London from a storm surge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thames Barrier engineer says second defence needed |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-20904885 |newspaper=BBC News |date=5 January 2013 |accessdate=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the failure of the dykes and levees around [[New Orleans]] during [[Hurricane Katrina]] created a [[humanitarian crisis]] in the United States. [[Land reclamation in Hong Kong]] also permitted the construction of [[Hong Kong International Airport]] through the leveling and expansion of two smaller islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Plant, G.W.|author2=Covil, C.S|author3=Hughes, R.A.|title=Site Preparation for the New Hong Kong International Airport|publisher=Thomas Telford|date=1998|pages=1–4, 43 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=NVlGrr9WOp4C&amp;printsec=frontcover|isbn=978-0-7277-2696-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sea level===

In central Asia and other large land masses, there are [[endorheic basin]]s which have no outlet to the sea, separated from the ocean by mountains or other natural geologic features that prevent the water draining away. The [[Caspian Sea]] is the largest one of these. Its main inflow is from the [[River Volga]], there is no outflow and the evaporation of water makes it saline as dissolved minerals accumulate. The [[Aral Sea]] and [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]] in the western United States are further examples of large, inland saline water-bodies without drainage. Some endorheic lakes are less salty, but all are sensitive to variations in the quality of the inflowing water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unep.or.jp/ietc/publications/short_series/lakereservoirs-2/10.asp | title=Endorheic Lakes: Waterbodies That Don't Flow to the Sea |work=The Watershed: Water from the Mountains into the Sea | publisher=United Nations Environment Programme | accessdate=16 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can also enter through rivers as dissolved organic carbon and is converted by photosynthetic organisms into organic carbon. This can either be exchanged throughout the food chain or precipitated into the deeper, more carbon rich layers as dead soft tissue or in shells and bones as [[calcium carbonate]].

==Life in the sea==
[[File:Blue Linckia Starfish.JPG|right|upright|thumb|[[Coral reef]]s are among the most [[Biodiversity|biodiverse]] habitats in the world.]]
{{main|Marine biology}}
{{ocean habitat topics|image=|thumb|alt=Coral reef|caption=}}
The oceans are home to a diverse collection of life forms that use it as a habitat. Since sunlight illuminates only the upper layers, the major part of the ocean exists in permanent darkness. As the different depth and temperature zones each provide habitat for a unique set of species, the marine environment as a whole encompasses an immense diversity of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/pros-e/nenv-e/index-e.htm |title=Profile |publisher=Department of Natural Environmental Studies: University of Tokyo |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marine habitats range from surface water to the deepest [[oceanic trench]]es, including coral reefs, [[kelp forest]]s, [[seagrass meadow]]s, [[tidepool]]s, muddy, sandy and rocky seabeds, and the open [[pelagic]] zone. The organisms living in the sea range from [[cetaceans|whales]] 30 metres (100&amp;nbsp;ft) long to microscopic phytoplankton and [[zooplankton]], fungi, and bacteria.&lt;!-- and viruses, including recently discovered [[marine bacteriophage]]s which live parasitically inside bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mann | first = Nicholas H. | title = The third age of phage | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | pages = 753–755 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030182 }}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; Marine life plays an important part in the [[carbon cycle]] as photosynthetic organisms convert dissolved carbon dioxide into organic carbon and it is economically important to humans for providing [[fishery|fish]] for use as food.&lt;ref name=Jeffrey&gt;{{cite book | title=Marine Biology: International Edition: Function, Biodiversity, Ecology | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Levinton, Jeffrey S. | year=2010 | chapter=18.

Life may have originated in the sea and all the [[Phylum|major groups]] of animals are represented there. Scientists differ as to precisely where in the sea life arose: the [[Miller-Urey]] experiments suggested a dilute chemical "soup" in open water, but more recent suggestions include volcanic hot springs, fine-grained clay sediments, or deep-sea "[[black smoker]]" vents, all of which would have provided protection from damaging ultraviolet radiation which was not blocked by the early earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Stow/&gt;{{rp|pages=138–140}}

===Marine habitats===
{{main|Marine habitats}}
Marine habitats can be divided horizontally into coastal and open ocean habitats. Coastal habitats extend from the shoreline to the edge of the [[continental shelf]]. Most marine life is found in coastal habitats, even though the shelf area occupies only 7 percent of the total ocean area. Open ocean habitats are found in the deep ocean beyond the edge of the continental shelf. Alternatively, marine habitats can be divided vertically into [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]] (open water), [[Demersal zone|demersal]] (just above the seabed) and [[Benthic zone|benthic]] (sea bottom) habitats. A third division is by [[latitude]]: from polar seas with ice shelves, sea ice and icebergs, to temperate and tropical waters.&lt;ref name=Stow/&gt;{{rp|pages=150–151}}

Coral reefs, the so-called "rainforests of the sea", occupy less than 0.1 percent of the world's ocean surface, yet their ecosystems include 25 percent of all marine species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Spalding MD and Grenfell AM |doi=10.1007/s003380050078| title=New estimates of global and regional coral reef areas| year=1997| journal=Coral Reefs| volume=16| issue=4| page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best-known are [[tropical]] coral reefs such as Australia's [[Great Barrier Reef]], but cold water reefs harbour a wide array of species including corals (only six of which contribute to reef formation).&lt;ref name=Stow/&gt;{{rp|pages=204–207}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.coralscience.org/main/articles/climate-a-ecology-16/cold-water-reefs | title=Cold-water reefs | publisher=CoralScience.org | date=2008–2009 | accessdate=22 April 2013 | author=Neulinger, Sven}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Light is only able to penetrate the top {{convert|200|m}} so this is the only part of the sea where plants can grow.&lt;ref name=Russell/&gt; The surface layers are often deficient in biologically active nitrogen compounds.

This means that the most productive areas, rich in plankton and therefore also in fish, are mainly coastal.&lt;ref name=Stow/&gt;{{rp|pages=160–163}}

The pelagic zone contains [[Fauna#Macrofauna|macro-]] and [[microfauna]] and myriad zooplankton which drift with the currents.

The demersal zone supports many animals that feed on benthic organisms or seek protection from predators and the seabed provides a range of habitats on or under the surface of the [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] which are used by creatures adapted to these conditions. The tidal zone with its periodic exposure to the dehydrating air is home to [[barnacle]]s, [[mollusc]]s and [[crustacean]]s. The [[neritic zone]] has many organisms that need light to flourish. Here, among algal encrusted rocks live [[sponge]]s, [[echinoderm]]s, [[Polychaete|polychaete worms]], [[sea anemone]]s and other invertebrates. Corals often contain photosynthetic [[Symbiosis|symbionts]] and live in shallow waters where light penetrates. The extensive calcareous skeletons they extrude build up into coral reefs which are an important feature of the seabed. These provide a [[Biodiversity|biodiverse]] habitat for reef dwelling organisms. There is less sea life on the floor of deeper seas but marine life also flourishes around [[seamount]]s that rise from the depths, where fish and other animals congregate to spawn and feed. Close to the seabed live [[demersal fish]] that feed largely on pelagic organisms or [[Benthos|benthic]] invertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sedberry, G. R.; Musick, J.

As for the history of [[navigational instrument]], a [[compass]] was first used by the ancient Greeks and Chinese to show where north lies and the direction in which the ship is heading. The latitude (an angle which ranges from 0° at the equator to 90° at the poles) was determined by measuring the angle between the Sun, Moon or a specific star and the horizon by the use of an [[astrolabe]], [[Jacob's staff]] or [[Sextant (astronomical)|sextant]]. The [[longitude]] (a line on the globe joining the two poles) could only be calculated with an accurate [[Marine chronometer|chronometer]] to show the exact time difference between the ship and a fixed point such as the [[Prime meridian (Greenwich)|Greenwich Meridian]]. In 1759, [[John Harrison]], a clockmaker, designed such an instrument and James Cook used it in his voyages of exploration.&lt;ref name=NavHist/&gt; Nowadays, the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) using over thirty satellites enables accurate navigation worldwide.&lt;ref name=NavHist&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/interactive/animations/navigation/index_embed.shtml |title=A History of Navigation |work=History |publisher=BBC |accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regards to maps that are vital for navigation, in the second century, [[Ptolemy]] mapped the whole known world from the "Fortunatae Insulae", [[Cape Verde]] or [[Canary Islands]], eastward to  the [[Gulf of Thailand]]. This map was used in 1492 when Christopher Columbus set out on his voyages of discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jenkins, Simon |year=1992 |title=Four Cheers for Geography |journal=Geography |volume=77 |issue=3 |pages=193–197 |jstor=40572190 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, [[Gerardus Mercator]] made a practical map of the world in 1538, his map projection conveniently making [[rhumb lines]] straight.&lt;ref name=Stow/&gt;{{rp|pages=12–13}} By the eighteenth century better maps had been made and part of the objective of [[James Cook]] on his voyages was to further map the ocean.

===History of oceanography and deep sea exploration===
{{main|Deep-sea exploration}}
Scientific oceanography began with the voyages of Captain James Cook from 1768 to 1779, describing the Pacific with unprecedented precision from 71 degrees South to 71 degrees North.&lt;ref name=Stow/&gt;{{rp|page=14}} John Harrison's chronometers supported Cook's accurate navigation and charting on two of these voyages, permanently improving the standard attainable for subsequent work.&lt;ref name=Stow/&gt;{{rp|page=14}} Other expeditions followed in the nineteenth century, from Russia, France, the Netherlands and the United States as well as Britain.&lt;ref name=Stow/&gt;{{rp|page=15}} On [[HMS Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']], which provided [[Charles Darwin]] with ideas and materials for his 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', the ship's captain, [[Robert FitzRoy]], charted the seas and coasts and published his four-volume report of the ship's three voyages in 1839.&lt;ref name=Stow/&gt;{{rp|page=15}} [[Edward Forbes]]'s 1854 book, ''Distribution of Marine Life'' argued that no life could exist below around 600 metres (2000 feet). This was proven wrong by the British biologists [[W. B. Carpenter]] and [[C. Wyville Thomson]], who in 1868 discovered life in deep water by dredging.&lt;ref name=Stow/&gt;{{rp|page=15}} Wyville Thompson became chief scientist on the Challenger expedition of 1872–1876, which effectively created the science of oceanography.&lt;ref name=Stow/&gt;{{rp|page=15}}

On her {{convert|68890|nmi|km|adj=on}} journey round the globe, ''HMS Challenger'' discovered about 4,700 new marine species, and made 492 deep sea soundings, 133 bottom dredges, 151 open water trawls and 263 serial water temperature observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Oceanography: an introduction to the marine environment |last=Weyl |first=Peter K. |year=1970 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-471-93744-9 |page=49 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the southern Atlantic in 1898/1899, [[Carl Chun]] on the ''Valdivia'' brought many new life forms to the surface from depths of over {{convert|4000|m}}. The first observations of deep-sea animals in their natural environment were made in 1930 by [[William Beebe]] and [[Otis Barton]] who descended to {{convert|434|m}} in the spherical steel [[Bathysphere]].&lt;ref name=jrank&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/7100/Underwater-Exploration.html |title=Underwater Exploration - History, Oceanography, Instrumentation, Diving Tools and Techniques, Deep-sea Submersible Vessels, Key Findings in Underwater Exploration, Deep-sea pioneers |work=Science Encyclopedia |publisher=Net Industries |accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was lowered by cable but by 1960 a self-powered submersible, [[Bathyscaphe Trieste|Trieste]] developed by [[Jacques Piccard]], took Piccard and [[Don Walsh]] to the deepest part of the [[Earth]]'s oceans, the [[Mariana Trench]] in the Pacific, reaching a record depth of about {{convert|10915|m|ft|0}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jacques-piccard-oceanographer-and-pioneer-of-deepsea-exploration-992032.html |title=Jacques Piccard: Oceanographer and pioneer of deep-sea exploration |publisher=The Independent |date=5 November 2008 |accessdate=15 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a feat not repeated until 2012 when [[James Cameron]] piloted the [[Deepsea Challenger]] to similar depths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deepseachallenge.com/the-expedition/ |title=The expedition |author=James Cameron |work=Deepsea Challenge |publisher=National Geographic |accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[atmospheric diving suit]] can be worn for deep sea operations, with a new world record being set in 2006 when a US Navy diver descended to {{convert|2000|ft}} in one of these articulated, pressurized suits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=25000 |title=Navy Chief Submerges 2,000 Feet, Sets Record |author=Logico, Mark G. |date=8 April 2006 |work=America's Navy |publisher=United States Navy |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At great depths, no light penetrates through the water layers from above and the pressure is extreme. For deep sea exploration it is necessary to use specialist vehicles, either [[remotely operated underwater vehicle]]s with lights and cameras or manned [[submersible]]s. The battery-operated [[Mir (submersible)|Mir submersibles]] have a three man crew and can descend to 20,000 feet (6,000 m). They have viewing ports, 5,000-watt lights, video equipment and manipulator arms for collecting samples, placing probes or pushing the vehicle across the sea bed when the thrusters would stir up excessive sediment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/technology/subs/mir/mir.html |title=The Marvelous Mirs |work=Ocean Explorer |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bathymetry]] is the mapping and study of the [[topography]] of the ocean floor. Methods used for measuring the depth of the sea include single or multibeam [[echosounder]]s, [[laser airborne depth sounder]]s and the calculation of depths from satellite remote sensing data. This information is used for determining the routes of undersea cables and pipelines, for choosing suitable locations for siting oil rigs and offshore wind turbines and for identifying possible new fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ga.gov.au/marine/bathymetry.html |title=Marine and Coastal: Bathymetry |publisher=Geoscience Australia |accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law===
"Freedom of the seas" is a principle in [[international law]] dating from the seventeenth century. It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans and disapproves of war fought in [[international waters]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_historical_perspective.htm |title=The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (A historical perspective) | publisher=United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea| accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: "The high seas are open to all [[sovereign state|states]], whether coastal or [[landlocked country|land-locked]]." Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of [[submarine communications cable|submarine cables]], building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; The safety of shipping is regulated by the [[International Maritime Organization]]. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.imo.org/About/Pages/Default.aspx | title=Introduction to IMO | publisher=International Maritime Organization | year=2013 | accessdate=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UNCLOS defines various areas of water. "Internal waters" are on the landward side of a [[Baseline (sea)|baseline]] and foreign vessels have no right of passage in these. "Territorial waters" extend to 12&amp;nbsp;nautical miles (22&amp;nbsp;kilometres; 14&amp;nbsp;miles) from the coastline and in these waters, the coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use and exploit any resource. A "contiguous zone" extending a further 12&amp;nbsp;nautical miles allows for [[hot pursuit]] of vessels suspected of infringing laws in four specific areas: customs, taxation, immigration and pollution. An "exclusive economic zone" extends for 200&amp;nbsp;nautical miles (370&amp;nbsp;kilometres; 230&amp;nbsp;miles) from the baseline. Within this area, the coastal nation has sole exploitation rights over all natural resources. The "continental shelf" is the [[natural prolongation]] of the land territory to the [[continental margin]]'s outer edge, or 200 nautical miles from the coastal state's baseline, whichever is greater. Here the coastal nation has the exclusive right to harvest minerals and also living resources "attached" to the seabed.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

Control of the sea is important to the security of a maritime nation, and the naval [[blockade]] of a port can be used to cut off food and supplies in time of war. Battles have been fought on the sea for more than 3,000 years.

===Travel===
Sailing ships or [[Packet boat|packets]] carried mail overseas, one of the earliest being the Dutch service to [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] in the 1670s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Calendar of state papers, domestic series, of the reign of Charles II: preserved in the state paper department of Her Majesty's Public Record Office, Volume 1 |last=Public Record Office |year=1860 |publisher=Longman, Green, Longman &amp; Roberts |url=http://books.google.com/?id=0_JVAAAAYAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; These added passenger accommodation, but in cramped conditions. Later, scheduled services were offered but the time journeys took depended much on the weather. When steamships replaced sailing vessels, [[Ocean liner|ocean-going liners]] took over the task of carrying people. By the beginning of the twentieth century, crossing the Atlantic took about five days and shipping companies competed to own the largest and fastest vessels. The [[Blue Riband]] was an unofficial accolade given to the fastest liner crossing the Atlantic in regular service. The ''[[RMS Mauretania (1906)|Mauretania]]'' held the title with 26.06 knots (48.26&amp;nbsp;km/h) for twenty years from 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greatships.net/riband.html |title=The Blue Riband of the North Atlantic |author=Newman, Jeff |work=Great Ships  |accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hales Trophy, another award for the fastest commercial crossing of the Atlantic, was won by the ''[[SS United States|United States]]'' in 1952 for a crossing that took three days, ten hours and forty minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smith, Jack |year=1985 |title=Hales Trophy, won in 1952 by ''SS United States'' remains at King's Point as ''Challenger'' succumbs to the sea |journal=Yachting |issue=November |page=121  |url=http://books.google.com/?id=BLg5v41rbmEC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=%22Hales+trophy%22+United+States#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Hales%20trophy%22%20United%20States&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The great liners were comfortable but expensive in fuel and staff. The age of the trans-Atlantic liners waned as cheap intercontinental flights became available. In 1958, a regular scheduled air service between New York and Paris taking seven hours doomed the Atlantic ferry service to oblivion. One by one the vessels were laid up, some were scrapped, others became cruise ships for the leisure industry and still others floating hotels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Norris, Gregory J. |year=1981 |title=Evolution of cruising |journal=Cruise Travel |issue=December |page=28 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=IDEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=The+Evolution+of+the+Transatlantic+Liner&amp;pg=PA28#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Evolution%20of%20the%20Transatlantic%20Liner&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sea is still a route by which [[Refugees#Boat people|boat people]] travel in small, sometimes unseaworthy craft, often having paid money to [[People smuggling|people smugglers]] for their passage.

Maritime trade has existed for millennia. The [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] had developed trade with India using the Red Sea ports and in the first millennium BC the [[Arabs]], Phoenicians, [[Israelites]] and [[India]]ns traded in luxury goods such as spices, gold, and precious stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Shaw | first = Ian | title = The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2003 |page=426 | isbn = 0-19-280458-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Phoenicians were noted sea traders and under the Greeks and Romans, commerce continued to thrive. With the collapse of the Roman Empire, European trade dwindled but it continued to flourish among the kingdoms of Africa, the Middle East, India, China and southeastern Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cross-Cultural Trade in World History |last=Curtin |first=Philip D. |year=1984 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-26931-5 |pages=88–104 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=R4IiYFhliv4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=history+of+trade#v=onepage&amp;q=Roman%20Empire&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 16th to the 19th centuries, about 13&amp;nbsp;million people were shipped across the Atlantic  to be sold as slaves in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Atlantic Slave Trade: Effects on Africa |last=Kubetzek |first=Kathrin |last2=Kant |first2=Karo |year=2012 |publisher=GRIN Verlag |isbn=978-3-656-15818-9 |page=1 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=jSg1G5gKNsIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=slaves+shipped+across+Atlantic#v=onepage&amp;q=slaves%20shipped%20across%20Atlantic&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, large quantities of goods are transported by sea, especially across the Atlantic and around the Pacific Rim. A major trade route passes through the [[Pillars of Hercules]], across the Mediterranean and the [[Suez Canal]] to the Indian Ocean and through the [[Straits of Malacca]]; much trade also passes through the [[English Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://micheli.stanford.edu/pdf/30-Halpernetal2008Science.pdf | title=A global map of human impact on marine ecosystems | author=Halpern, Benjamin S.; Walbridge, Shaun; Selkoe, Kimberly A.; Kappel, Carrie V.; Micheli, Fiorenza; D'Agrosa, Caterina; Bruno, John F.; Casey, Kenneth S.; Ebert, Colin; Fox, Helen E.; Fujita, Rod; Heinemann, Dennis; Lenihan, Hunter S.; Madin, Elizabeth M.

Shipping is supplemented by [[air freight]], a more expensive process mostly used for particularly valuable or perishable cargoes.

There are two main kinds of freight, [[bulk cargo]] and [[break bulk cargo|break bulk]] or general cargo, most of which is now transported in [[Containerization|containers]]. [[Commodity|Commodities]] in the form of liquids, powder or particles are carried loose in the [[Hold (ship)|holds]] of [[bulk carrier]]s and include oil, grain, coal, ore, scrap metal, sand and gravel. Break bulk cargo is usually manufactured goods and is transported in packages, often stacked on [[pallet]]s.

Fish and other fishery products are among the most important sources of protein and other nutrients that are essential for a balanced diet and good health.&lt;ref name="faofisheries"/&gt; In 2009, 16.6% of the world's intake of animal protein and 6.5% of all protein consumed came from fish.&lt;ref name="faofisheries"/&gt; In order to fulfill this need, coastal countries have exploited marine resources in their [[exclusive economic zone]], although fishing vessels are increasingly venturing further afield to exploit stocks in international waters.&lt;ref name=GreenFacts&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenfacts.org/en/fisheries/ |title=Fisheries: Latest data |publisher=GreenFacts |accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the total world production of fish, including [[aquaculture]], was estimated to be 154&amp;nbsp;million tonnes, of which most was for human consumption.&lt;ref name="faofisheries"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i2727e/i2727e.pdf |title=The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2012 |year=2012 |isbn=978-92-5-107225-7 |publisher= FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Department |accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The harvesting of wild fish accounted for 90.4&amp;nbsp;million tonnes, while annually increasing aquaculture contributes the rest.&lt;ref name="faofisheries"/&gt; The north west Pacific is by far the most productive area with 20.9 million tonnes (27 percent of the global marine catch) in 2010.&lt;ref name="faofisheries"/&gt; In addition, the number of fishing vessels in 2010 reached 4.36 million, whereas the number of people employed in the primary sector of fish production in the same year amounted to 54.8 million.&lt;ref name="faofisheries"/&gt;

Modern fishing vessels include [[fishing trawler]]s with a small crew, stern trawlers, purse seiners, long-line factory vessels and large [[factory ship]]s which are designed to stay at sea for weeks, processing and freezing great quantities of fish. The equipment used to capture the fish may be [[purse seine]]s, other [[seine]]s, [[Trawling|trawls]], dredges, [[gillnet]]s and [[Longline fishing|long-lines]] and the fish species most frequently targeted are [[herring]], [[cod]], [[anchovy]], [[tuna]], [[flounder]], [[Mullet (fish)|mullet]], squid and [[salmon]]. Overexploitation itself has become a serious concern; it does not only cause the depletion of fish stocks, but also substantially reduce the population of predatory fish populations.&lt;ref name="Myers2003"/&gt; Myers &amp; Wworm estimated that "industrialized fisheries typically reduced community biomass by 80% within 15 years of exploitation."&lt;ref name="Myers2003"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Myers | first1 = R.

Nonetheless, research published in ''Nature'' in April 2018 found that the aggresive effort of the Indonesian [[Minister of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries of Indonesia]] [[Susi Pudjiastuti]] to curtail illegal fishing has "reduced total fishing effort by at least 25%, (...)

[[Artisan fishing]] methods include rod and line, harpoons, skin diving, traps, throw nets and drag nets. Traditional fishing boats are powered by paddle, wind or outboard motors and operate in near-shore waters.

As well as the wild stock, about 79&amp;nbsp;million tonnes (78M long tons; 87M short tons) of food and non-food products were produced by aquaculture in 2010, an all time high. About six hundred species of plants and animals were cultured, some for use in seeding wild populations.

Electricity [[power station]]s are often located on the coast or beside an estuary so that the sea can be used as a heat sink. A colder heat sink enables more efficient power generation, which is important for expensive [[Nuclear power|nuclear power plants]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Current-and-Future-Generation/Cooling-Power-Plants/ |title=Cooling power plants |date=1 September 2013 |publisher=World Nuclear Association |accessdate=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extractive industries===
{{main|Offshore drilling|Deep sea mining}}

The seabed contains enormous reserves of minerals which can be exploited by dredging. This has advantages over land-based mining in that equipment can be built at specialised [[shipyard]]s and [[infrastructure]] costs are lower. Disadvantages include problems caused by waves and tides, the tendency for excavations to silt up and the washing away of [[Spoil tip|spoil heaps]]. There is a risk of coastal erosion and environmental damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Undersea+Mining |title=Mining, Undersea |author=Nurok, G.

[[File:Minerals sediments.jpg|thumb|alt=Minerals from hydrothermal vent|Minerals precipitated near a hydrothermal vent]]
[[Seafloor massive sulfide deposits|Seafloor massive sulphide deposits]] are potential sources of [[silver]], [[gold]], [[copper]], [[lead]] and [[zinc]] and trace metals since their discovery in the 1960s. They form when [[Geothermal gradient|geothermally]] heated water is emitted from deep sea hydrothermal vents known as "black smokers". The ores are of high quality but prohibitively costly to extract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wealthdaily.com/resources/underwater-mining-companies |title=Underwater Mining Companies |author=Kohl, Keith |year=2013 |work=Wealth Daily |accessdate=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small scale mining of the deep sea floor is being developed off the coast of [[Papua New Guinea]] using [[robot]]ic techniques, but the obstacles are formidable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.co.uk/news/2013/13/130201-underwater-mining-gold-precious-metals-oceans-environment/ | title=Will Deep-sea Mining Yield an Underwater Gold Rush? | work=National Geographic | date=1 February 2013 | accessdate=6 May 2013 | author=Miner, Meghan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are large deposits of [[petroleum]], as oil and [[natural gas]], in rocks beneath the seabed. [[Oil platform|Offshore platforms]] and [[drilling rig]]s [[Offshore drilling|extract]] the oil or gas and store it for transport to land. Offshore oil and gas production can be difficult due to the remote, harsh environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/offshore-drilling.htm |title=How offshore drilling works |author=Lamb, Robert |year=2011 |work=HowStuffWorks |accessdate=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drilling for oil in the sea has environmental impacts. Animals may be disorientated by [[seismic wave]]s used to locate deposits, probably causing the [[Beached whale|beaching of whales]]. Toxic substances such as [[mercury (element)|mercury]], lead and [[arsenic]] may be released. The infrastructure may cause damage, and oil may be spilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/offshore-drilling-controversy2.htm |title=Effects of offshore drilling: energy vs. environment |author=Horton, Jennifer |year=2011 |work=HowStuffWorks |accessdate=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large quantities of [[methane clathrate]] exist on the seabed and in ocean sediment at a temperature of around {{convert|2|°C}} and these are of interest as a potential energy source. Some estimates put the amount available at between one and 5&amp;nbsp;million cubic kilometres (0.24 to 1.2&amp;nbsp;million cubic miles).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Milkov| first= A.

In the Pacific these may cover up to 30 percent of the deep ocean floor. The minerals precipitate from seawater and grow very slowly. Their commercial extraction for [[nickel]] was investigated in the 1970s but abandoned in favour of more convenient sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Achurra, L. E.; Lacassie, J.

[[Desalination]] is the technique of removing salts from seawater to leave [[Drinking water|fresh water]] suitable for drinking or irrigation. The two main processing methods, [[vacuum distillation]] and [[reverse osmosis]], use large quantities of energy. Desalination is normally only undertaken where fresh water from other sources is in short supply or energy is plentiful, as in the excess heat generated by power stations. The brine produced as a by-product contains some toxic materials and is returned to the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hamed, Osman A. |year=2005 |journal=Desalination |volume=186 |pages= 207–214 |doi=10.1016/j.desal.2005.03.095 |title=Overview of hybrid desalination systems – current status and future prospects}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marine pollution===
{{Main|Marine pollution}}

Many substances enter the sea as a result of human activities. Combustion products are transported in the air and deposited into the sea by precipitation. Industrial outflows and [[sewage treatment plant|sewage]] contribute [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]], [[pesticide]]s, [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]], [[disinfectant]]s, household cleaning products and other [[synthetic chemical]]s. These become concentrated in the surface film and in marine sediment, especially estuarine mud. The result of all this contamination is largely unknown because of the large number of substances involved and the lack of information on their biological effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seaweb.org/resources/briefings/toxic.php |title=Toxic Pollution |work=Ocean Briefing Book |publisher=SeaWeb |accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy metals of greatest concern are copper, lead, mercury, [[cadmium]] and zinc which may be [[Bio-accumulation|bio-accumulated]] by marine invertebrates. They are cumulative toxins and are passed up the food chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ansari, T. M.; Marr, L. L.; Tariq, N. |year=2004 |title=Heavy metals in marine pollution perspective: a mini review |journal=Journal of Applied Sciences |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=1–20 |doi=10.3923/jas.2004.1.20|bibcode = 2004JApSc...4....1. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most oil pollution in the sea comes from cities and industry.&lt;ref name=WWF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/blue_planet/problems/pollution/ |title=Marine problems: Pollution |publisher=World Wildlife Fund |accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oil is dangerous for marine animals. It can clog the feathers of sea birds, reducing their insulating effect and the birds' buoyancy, and be ingested when they preen themselves in an attempt to remove the contaminant. [[Marine mammals]] are less seriously affected but may be chilled through the removal of their insulation, blinded, dehydrated or poisoned. [[Benthos|Benthic]] invertebrates are swamped when the oil sinks, fish are poisoned and the food chain is disrupted. In the short term, oil spills result in wildlife populations being decreased and unbalanced, leisure activities being affected and the livelihoods of people dependant on the sea being devastated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nwf.org/What-We-Do/Protect-Habitat/Gulf-Restoration/Oil-Spill/Effects-on-Wildlife.aspx |title=How Does the BP Oil Spill Impact Wildlife and Habitat? |publisher=National Wildlife Federation |accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marine environment has self-cleansing properties and naturally occurring bacteria will act over time to remove oil from the sea. In the Gulf of Mexico, where oil-eating bacteria are already present, they take only a few days to consume spilt oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gulf of Mexico Has Greater-Than-Believed Ability to Self-Cleanse Oil Spills |author=American Chemical Society |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/04/130408152733.htm |newspaper=Science Daily |date=9 April 2013 |accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Run-off of [[fertiliser]]s from agricultural land is a major source of pollution in some areas and the discharge of raw [[sewage]] has a similar effect. The extra nutrients provided by these sources can cause [[eutrophication|excessive plant growth]]. Nitrogen is often the limiting factor in marine systems, and with added nitrogen, algal blooms and [[red tide]]s can lower the oxygen level of the water and kill marine animals. Such events have created dead zones in the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt; Some [[algal bloom]]s are caused by [[cyanobacteria]] that make [[shellfish]] that [[Filter feeder|filter feed]] on them toxic, harming animals like [[sea otter]]s.&lt;ref name=NationalGeographic&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/04/130412-diseases-health-animals-science-environment-oceans/ |title=New Diseases, Toxins Harming Marine Life |author=Dell'Amore, Christine |date=12 April 2013 |work=National Geographic Daily News |publisher=National Geographic |accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclear facilities too can pollute.

The dumping of waste (including oil, noxious liquids, sewage and garbage) at sea is governed by international law. The [[Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter|London Convention]] (1972) is a [[United Nations]] agreement to control ocean dumping which had been ratified by 89 countries by 8 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imo.org/OurWork/Environment/SpecialProgrammesAndInitiatives/Pages/London-Convention-and-Protocol.aspx |title=London Convention and Protocol |accessdate=15 September 2012 |publisher=International Maritime Organization }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MARPOL 73/78]] is a convention to minimize pollution of the seas by ships.

'''Shirvan''' (from {{lang-fa|شروان|translit=Shirvān}}; {{lang-az|Şirvan}}; [[Tat language (Caucasus)|Tat]]: ''Şirvan''), also spelled as '''Sharvān''', '''Shirwan''', '''Shervan''', '''Sherwan''' and '''Šervān''', is a [[historical region]] in the eastern [[Caucasus]], known by this name in both Islamic and modern times.&lt;ref name="EIS"&gt;Barthold, W. "SHīrwān , Shirwān or Sharwān." Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman , Th. Bianquis , C.E. Bosworth , E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, the region is an industrially and agriculturally developed part of the [[Azerbaijan Republic]] that stretches between the western shores of the [[Caspian Sea]] and the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura River]] and is centered on the Shirvan Plain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/541162/Shirvan-Plain Shirvan Plain (plain, Azerbaijan)] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval history and etymology==
{{main|Caucasian Albania|Shirvanshah|Safavid|Great Seljuq Empire|Afsharid dynasty|Zand dynasty|Qajar dynasty}}

[[Vladimir Minorsky]] believes that names such as Sharvān (Shirwān), Lāyzān and Baylaqān are Iranian names from the [[Iranian languages]] of the coast of the [[Caspian Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Minorsky, Vladimir. “A History of Sharvan and Darband in the 10th-11th Centuries”, Cambridge, 1958.  Excerpt: Such names as Sharvan, Layzan, Baylaqan, etc., suggest that the Iranian immigration proceeded chiefly from [[Gilan Province|Gilan]] and other regions on the southern coast of the Caspian.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several explanations about this name:
* Shirvan or Sharvan are changed forms of the word "Shahrbān" ({{lang-fa|{{Nastaliq|شهربان}}}}) which means "the governor". The word "Shahrban" has been used since Achaemenian Dynasty as "Xshathrapawn" to refer to different states of the kingdom.
* Shervan in Persian means cypress tree (the same as 'sarv' in Middle Persian and in New Persian, as well as in Arabic&lt;ref name="DehkhodaDictionary"&gt;Dehkhoda dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;). It is also used as a male name. 
* It is connected popularly to [[Khosrau I|Anushirvan]], the [[Sasanian]] King.&lt;ref name="DehkhodaDictionary"/&gt;
* Another meaning of 'Shirwan' according to the Dehkhoda Dictionary is ''protector of lion''. This meaning is also shared in Kurdish, where the name is widely used for males; there is a castle near Kirkuk (south Kurdistan) called Qelay Shirwana/Shirvana. Also there is a famous tribe in the north of Erbil Province in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region by the name of Sherwani that is part of Barzani tribe union. Sherwan town is the Center of Sherwani tribe. According to Heptner and Sludskii (1972), the word ''Shīr'' ({{lang-fa|{{Nastaliq|شیر}}}}) is in reference to the [[Asiatic lion]], which occurred in the [[Trans-Caucasus]] and [[Persia]], before the end of the 10th and 20th centuries, respectively.&lt;ref name="Geptner1972"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Heptner, V. G. |author2=Sludskij, A. A. |orig-year=1972 |year=1992 |title=Mlekopitajuščie Sovetskogo Soiuza. Moskva: Vysšaia Škola |trans-title=Mammals of the Soviet Union. Volume II, Part 2. Carnivora (Hyaenas and Cats) |publisher=Smithsonian Institution and the National Science Foundation |location=Washington DC |chapter=Lion |url=https://archive.org/stream/mammalsofsov221992gept#page/83/mode/2up |pages=82–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Said Nafisi]] points out that according to [[Khaqani]]'s poems, where Khaqani contrasts his home town with kheyrvān ({{lang-fa|{{Nastaliq|خیروان}}}}), the original and correct pronunciation of the name was Sharvān. So all etymologies relating this name to sher/shir (lion in Persian and Kurdish) or Anushiravan are most probably folk etymology and not based on historical facts. The form Shervān or Shirvān are from later centuries. According to the Encyclopedia of Islam, Shirwan proper comprised the easternmost spurs of the Caucasus range and the lands which sloped down from these mountains to the banks of the [[Kor River|Kur river]]. But its rulers strove continuously to control also the western shores of the Caspian Sea from Ḳuba (the modern town of [[Quba (city)|Quba]]) in the district of Maskat in the north, to [[Baku]] in the south. To the north of all these lands lay Bab al-Abwab or Derbend, and to the west, beyond the modern [[Goychay (city)|Goychay]], the region of [[Shaki, Azerbaijan|Shaki]]. In mediaeval Islamic times, and apparently in pre-Islamic Sāsānid ones also, Shirwan included the district of Layzan, which probably corresponds to modern Lahidj, often ruled as a separate fief by a collateral branch of the Yazidi Shirwan Shahs.''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Barthold, W., C.E. Bosworth "Shirwan Shah, Sharwan Shah. "Encyclopaedia of Islam. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2nd edition&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Azeri carpet (Sirvan group).jpg|thumb|Traditional pile carpet of Shirvan]]
The 19th century native historian and writer [[Abbasgulu Bakikhanov]] defines it as: "The country of Shirvan to the east borders on the Caspian Sea, and to the south on the river Kur, which separates it from the provinces of Moghan and Armenia".&lt;ref&gt;Willem Floor, Hasan Javadi(2009), "The Heavenly Rose-Garden: A History of Shirvan &amp;amp; Daghestan by Abbas Qoli Aqa Bakikhanov, Mage Publishers, 2009. pg 5: "The country of Shirvan to the east borders on the Caspian Sea, and to the south on the river Kur, which separates it from the provinces of Moghan and Armenia" "Thus, present day Shirvan with Saliyan, Sheki, Baku, Qobbeh, Darband, Tabarasan and Kur and the region of the Samuriyeh and some parts of lower Ilisu is part of that and constitutes the largest and the best part of this country."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shirvanshahs===
{{main|Shirvanshahs}}
Shirvanshah also spelled as Shīrwān Shāh or Sharwān Shāh, was the title in medieval Islamic times of a Persianized dynasty of Arabic origin.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  They ruled the area independently or as a vassal of larger empires from 800 A.D. up to 1607 A.D. when Safavid rule became firmly established.

===Safavid, Afsharid and Qajar eras===
{{main|Shirvanshahs|Safavids|Afsharid|Qajar dynasty}}

When the Shirvanshah Shah dynasty was ended by the [[Safavid]] Shah [[Tahmasp I]], Shirwan formed a province of the Safavids and was usually governed by a Khan, who is often called [[Beylerbey]].&lt;ref name="EIS"/&gt; Shirvan was taken by the Ottomans in 1578; however, Safavid rule was restored by 1607.&lt;ref name="EIS"/&gt; In 1722, during the [[Russo-Persian War (1722-1723)]], the Khan of Quba, Husayn Ali, submitted to [[Peter the Great]] and was accepted as his dignitary. The [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1723)]] forced the Iranian king to recognise the Russian annexation. By the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1724)|treaty]] between the Russian and Ottoman Empires in the year 1724, the coast of the territory of [[Baku]], which was occupied by the Russians, was separated from the rest of Shirvan, which was left to the Ottomans. It was only when Nader Shah [[Ottoman–Persian War (1730–35)|defeated the Ottomans (1735)]] that the Russians ceded back the coastal land and the other areas in the [[North Caucasus|North]] and [[South Caucasus]] as conquered in 1722-1723 from Safavid Iran conform the [[Treaty of Resht|Treaties of Resht]] and [[Treaty of Ganja|Ganja]], and the area became part of the Afsharid Empire,&lt;ref name="EIS"/&gt; by which century long Iranian rule was restored.

==Modern history from Qajar Iran up to the Azerbaijan SSR==
{{main|Russo-Persian War (1804-1813)|Russo-Persian War (1826-1828)|Treaty of Gulistan|Treaty of Turkmenchay}}
When the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajars]] had succeeded in restoring the unity of Persia, the sons of the Khan were no more able to maintain their independence like the other Caucasian chiefs and had to choose between Russia and Persia.&lt;ref name="EIS"/&gt; The Khan of Shirwan, Mustafa, who had already entered into negotiations with Zubov, submitted to the Russians in 1805, who occupied the Persian cities of [[Derbent|Derbend]] and Baku the next year (1806) during the [[Russo-Persian War (1804-1813)]], but soon afterwards he made overtures to the Persians and sought help from them.&lt;ref name="EIS"/&gt; By the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] (12/24 October 1813) following the end of the 1804-1813 war, Persia was forced to cede its territories and regions comprising [[Derbent|Darband]], [[Quba]], Shirwan and [[Baku]], while giving up all claims on them as well.&lt;ref name="EIS"/&gt; Nevertheless, Mustafa continued to have secret dealings with Persia. It was not until 1820 that his territory was occupied by Russian troops; the Khan fled to [[Persia]] and [[Shemakha]] was irrevocably incorporated in [[Russian Empire|Russian territory]].&lt;ref name="EIS"/&gt; Iranian anger while being dissatisfied with losing swaths of its integral territories in the North and South Caucasus subsequently sparked the [[Russo-Persian War (1826-1828)]], which resulted in another Iranian loss, as well as the ceding of its last remaining territories in the Caucasus comprising what is now [[Eastern Armenia|Armenia]], and southern parts of the contemporary Republic of Azerbaijan. The [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] of 1828 officially ratified the forced ceding of these Iranian territories to Imperial Russia, while it would also mark the official end of millennia long intertwined Iranian hegemony, rule, and influence over the [[Caucasus]] region, including Shirvan.

==People and culture==
{{main|Turkic peoples|Iranian Peoples|Azerbaijanis|Tat people (Caucasus)|Lezgins|Caucasian languages}}
[[File:Azerbaijani man from Shirvan.jpg|thumb|200px|Shirvan Tatar (i.e. Azeri). Engraving from book of Jean Baptiste Benoît Eyriès. Voyage pittoresque en Asie et en Afrique: résumé général des voyages anciens et modernes... T. I, 1839]]
The term Shirvani/Shirvanli is still in use in Azerbaijan to designate the people of Shirvan region, as it was historically.&lt;ref name="T"&gt;[[Tadeusz Swietochowski]], ''Russia and Azerbaijan: A Borderland in Transition'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1995. pg 10, 16&lt;/ref&gt; Since ancient time, the bulk population of Shirvan were Caucasian speaking groups. Later on Iranization of this native population and subsequent Turkification since the Seljuq era occurred. The bulk of the population today are Turkic-speaking [[Azerbaijanis]], although there are also smaller Caucasian speaking and Iranian speaking minorities.

===Caucasian population===
The original population were Paleo-Caucasians and spoke Caucasian languages, like the [[Caucasian Albanians]]. Today, other Daghestani Caucasian languages such as [[Udi language|Udi]], [[Lezgian language|Lezgian]] and [[Avar language|Avar]] are still spoken in the region.

===Iranian influence and population===
Iranian penetration started since the Achaemenid era and continued in the Parthian era. However it was during the Sassanid era that the influence really increased and Persian colonies were set up in the region. According to Vladimir Minorsky: ''The presence of Iranian settlers in Transcaucasia, and especially in the proximity of the passes, must have played an important role in absorbing and pushing back the aboriginal inhabitants. Such names as Sharvan, Layzan, Baylaqan, etc., suggest that the Iranian immigration proceeded chiefly from Gilan and other regions on the southern coast of the Caspian''.&lt;ref&gt;Minorsky, Vladimir. “A History of Sharvan and Darband in the 10th-11th Centuries”, Cambridge, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Masudi|Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn al-Husayn Al-Masudi]] (896–956), the [[Arab]] historian states Persian presence in Aran, Bayleqan, Darband, Shabaran, Masqat and Jorjan.&lt;ref&gt;Al Mas'udi, Kitab al-Tanbih wa-l-Ishraf, De Goeje, M.J. (ed.), Leiden, Brill, 1894, pp. 77-8).  Original Arabic from www.alwaraq.net: فالفرس أمة حد بلادها الجبال من الماهات وغیرها وآذربیجان إلى ما یلی بلاد أرمینیة وأران والبیلقان إلى دربند وهو الباب والأبواب والری وطبرستن والمسقط والشابران وجرجان وابرشهر، وهی نیسابور، وهراة ومرو وغیر ذلك من بلاد خراسان وسجستان وكرمان وفارس والأهواز، وما اتصل بذلك من أرض الأعاجم فی هذا الوقت وكل هذه البلاد كانت مملكة واحدة ملكها ملك واحد ولسانها واحد، إلا أنهم كانوا یتباینون فی شیء یسیر من اللغات وذلك أن اللغة إنما تكون واحدة بأن تكون حروفها التی تكتب واحدة وتألیف حروفها تألیف واحد، وإن اختلفت بعد ذلك فی سائر الأشیاء الأخر كالفهلویة والدریة والآذریة وغیرها من لغات الفرس. English: "The Persians are a people whose borders are the Mahat Mountains and Azarbaijan up to Armenia and Aran, and Bayleqan and [[Derbent|Darband]], and Ray and Tabaristan and Masqat and Shabaran and Jorjan and Abarshahr, and that is Nishabur, and Herat and Marv and other places in land of [[greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], and Sejistan and Kerman and Fars and Ahvaz...All these lands were once one kingdom with one sovereign and one language...although the language differed slightly. The language, however, is one, in that its letters are written the same way and used the same way in composition.  There are, then, different languages such as Pahlavi, Dari, Azari, as well as other Persian languages."&lt;/ref&gt; From 9th century, the urban population of Shirwan increasingly moved to [[Persian language]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kulichki.com/~gumilev/HE2/he2103.htm История Востока. В 6 т. Т. 2. Восток в средние века.] М., «Восточная литература», 2002. {{ISBN|5-02-017711-3}} (History of the East. In 6 volumes. Volume 2. Moscow, publishing house of the Russian Academy of sciences «East literature»): The polyethnic population of Albania left-bank at this time is increasingly moving to the Persian language. Mainly this applies to cities of Aran and Shirvan, as begin from 9-10 centuries named two main areas in the territory of Azerbaijan. With regard to the rural population, it would seem, mostly retained for a long time, their old languages, related to modern Daghestanian family, especially Lezgin. (russian text: Пестрое в этническом плане население левобережной Албании в это время все больше переходит на персидский язык. Главным образом это относится к городам Арана и Ширвана, как стали в IX-Х вв. именоваться два главные области на территории Азербайджана. Что касается сельского населения, то оно, по-видимому, в основном сохраняло еще долгое время свои старые языки, родственные современным дагестанским, прежде всего лезгинскому.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uni-persona.srcc.msu.su/site/authors/djakonov/posl_gl.htm Дьяконов, Игорь Михайлович. Книга воспоминаний. Издательство "Европейский дом", Санкт-Петербург, 1995., 1995]. - {{ISBN|5-85733-042-4}}. cтр. 730-731 [[Igor Diakonov]]. The book of memoirs.&lt;/ref&gt; while the rural population seems to mostly have retained their old Caucasian languages. Up to the nineteenth century, there was still a large number of Tat population (who claim to be descendants of Sassanid era Persian settlers), however due to similar culture and religion with Turkic-speaking Azerbaijanis, this population was partly assimilated.&lt;ref&gt;Natalia G. Volkova “Tats” in Encyclopedia of World Culture, Editor: David Publisher, New York: G.K. Hall, Prentice Hall International, 1991-1996).: "In the nineteenth century the Tats were settled in large homogeneous groups. The intensive processes of assimilation by the Turkic-speaking Azerbaijanis cut back the territory and numbers of the Tats. In 1886 they numbered more than 120,000 in Azerbaijan and 3,600 in Daghestan. According to the census of 1926 the number of Tats in Azerbaijan (despite the effect of natural increase) had dropped to 28,500, although there were also 38,300 “Azerbaijanis” with Tat as their native language."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkification of the region===

Turkic penetration in the region started in the Khazar era, however there are no unambiguous references to settlements.&lt;ref&gt;An Introduction to the History of the Turkic Peoples (Peter B. Golden. Otto Harrasowitz, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkification of the region started in the Seljuq era, although the area in parallel maintained its Persian culture under the Persianized Shirvanshah until the Safavid era. From the Safavid era onwards, the Turkification of the region accelerated with new wave of Turkoman settlements.&lt;ref&gt;(Olivier Roy. “The new Central Asia”, I.B. Tauris, 2007. Pg 7) “The mass of the Oghuz Turkic tribes who crossed the Amu Darya towards the west left the Iranian plateau, which remained Persian, and established themselves more to the west. Here they divided into Ottomans, who were Sunni and settled, and Turkmens, who were nomads and in part Shiite (or, rather, Alevi). The latter were to keep the name “Turkmen” for a long time: thus creating a new identity based on Shiism. These are the people today known as Azeris.”&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''steam mill''' is a type of [[Mill (grinding)|grinding mill]] using a [[stationary steam engine]] to power its mechanism.

==Reference to Marx==
For [[Karl Marx]], what defined [[feudalism]] was that the power of the ruling class (the [[aristocracy]]) rested on their control of arable land, leading to a [[class society]] based upon the exploitation of the peasants who farm these lands, typically under [[serfdom]]. Some interpret  Marx as advocating [[technological determinism]], with such statements as "The [[windmill]] gives you society with the feudal lord: the steam-mill, society with the industrial capitalist",&lt;ref&gt;Quote from [[The Poverty of Philosophy]] (1847), chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; but others argue that he was not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/tecdet/tdet02.html Technological or Media Determinism], Daniel Chandler&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1495">The '''Theban Mapping Project''' is an archaeological expedition devoted to [[Ancient Egypt]]. It was established in 1978 by the [[Egyptologist]] Dr. [[Kent R. Weeks]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. In 1985, it was moved to the [[American University in Cairo]], where it continues to be based. The Project's original goal was to create an archaeological map of the [[Valley of the Kings]], and that was published as the ''Atlas of the Valley of the Kings'' in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Kent R. Weeks (ed.).  Atlas of the Valley of the Kings.  Cairo: American University in Cairo Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; It now also appears online at www.Thebanmappingproject.com, where it was updated annually. The web site has not published an update in years and no longer responds to email{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}. Since 2001, the Project has also developed a management plan for the Valley of the Kings, which is funded by the World Monuments Fund.&lt;ref&gt;Kent R. Weeks (ed.), A Management Plan for the Valley of the Kings.  Cairo: Theban Mapping Project, 2001-2008.  Nine vols.&lt;/ref&gt;

The flatlands are the fertile bottom of a Pleistocene lake that existed until around 30,000 years BP. The last ''[[zipa]]'' of the Muisca, ruling over the Bogotá savanna, was '''Tisquesusa''', who was killed by one of the soldiers of the conquest expedition, opening up the reign of the Spanish over the terrain and the foundation of [[Bogotá]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16315">'''Vegetation and slope stability''' are interrelated by the ability of the [[plant]] life growing on slopes to both promote and hinder the stability of the slope.  The relationship is a complex combination of the type of [[soil]], the [[Climate|rainfall regime]], the plant species present, the [[Aspect (geography)|slope aspect]], and the steepness of the slope.  Knowledge of the underlying slope stability as a function of the soil type, its age, [[Soil horizon|horizon]] development, compaction, and other impacts is a major underlying aspect of understanding how [[vegetation]] can alter the stability of the slope.&lt;ref name=Mattia&gt;Mattia, C.; Bishetti, G. &amp; Gentile, F. 2005, ‘Biotechnical characteristics of root systems of typical Mediterranean species’, Plant and Soil, vol. 278, no.1, pp.&amp;nbsp;23–32&lt;/ref&gt; There are four major ways in which vegetation influences slope stability: [[wind]] throwing, the [[Water cycle|removal of water]], mass of vegetation (surcharge), and mechanical reinforcement of [[root]]s.

==Wind throwing==

Wind throw is the toppling of a [[tree]] due to the force of the wind, this exposes the root plate and adjacent soil beneath the tree and influences slope stability.  Wind throw is factor when considering one tree on a slope, however it is of lesser importance when considering general slope stability for a body of trees as the wind forces involved represent a smaller percentage of the potential disturbing forces and the trees which are in the centre of the group will be sheltered by those on the outside.&lt;ref name=Greenwood2004&gt;Greenwood, J.; Norris, J. &amp; Wint, J. 2004, ‘Assessing the contribution of vegetation to slope stability’, Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, vol. 157, no. 4, pp.&amp;nbsp;199–207.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Removal of water==

Vegetation influences slope stability by removing water through [[transpiration]]. Transpiration is the vaporisation of liquid water contained in plant tissue and the vapour removal to the air.&lt;ref name=FAO/&gt; Water is drawn up from the roots and transported through the plant up to the [[Leaf|leaves]]. 
 
The major effect of transpiration is the reduction of [[Characterisation of pore space in soil|soil pore water]] pressures which counteracts the loss of strength which occurs through wetting, this is most readily seen as a loss of moisture around trees. However it is not easy to rely on tree and shrub roots to remove water from slopes and consequently help ensure slope stability. The ability to transpire in wet conditions is severely reduced and therefore any increase in soil strength previously gained in evaporation and transpiration will be lost or significantly reduced, consequently the effects of transpiration cannot be taken into account at these times. However it can be assumed that the chance of slope failure following saturation by storm event or periods of extended rainfall will be lessened as a result of transpiration. Moreover, although changes in moisture content will affect the undrained shear strength, the effective shear stress parameters as commonly used in routine slope stability analysis are not directly influenced by changing moisture content, although the water pressures (suctions) used in the analysis will change.&lt;ref name=Greenwood2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=FAO&gt;Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations 2007, Introduction to evapotranspiration, viewed 10 June 2007, http://www.fao.org/docrep/X0490E/x0490e04.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that desiccation cracks can potentially be extended by vegetation in dry weather promoting the deeper penetration of water to a potential slip plane and increased water pressure into the soil during the wet periods. Nevertheless, these cracks will be filled by roots growing deeper into the soil as they follow the path of least resistance.&lt;ref name=Greenwood2004/&gt;

Studies in Malaysia&lt;ref name=Osman&gt;Osman, N. &amp; Barakabah, S. 2006, ‘Parameters to predict slope stability – Soil water and root profiles’, Ecological Engineering, vol. 28, no. 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;90–95&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that there is a significant relationship between root length density, soil water content and ultimately slope stability. Slopes that had high root density (due to dense vegetation on the surface) were less likely to undergo slope failure. This is because a high root length density results in low soil water content which in turn results in an increase in shear strength and a decrease in soil permeability. It is suggested that root length density and soil water level could be used as indicators of slope stability and possibly could be used to predict future slope failure.&lt;ref name=Osman/&gt;

Transpiration is accentuated when the vegetation has an extensive root system and rapid transpiration continues throughout winter.&lt;ref name=Perry&gt;Perry, J., Pedley, M., &amp; Reid, M. 2003, Infrastructure embankments condition appraisal and remedial treatment, MWL Digital, Pontypool, South Wales.&lt;/ref&gt;

The removal of water is also affected by the shading provided by vegetation. Shading helps prevent the desiccation of the soils which results in shrinkage and cracking allowing the deep penetration of rain water. Plants need to have a high leaf to root ratio and have the ability to persist through hot summer months in order to provide effective shading of the soils.&lt;ref name=Perry/&gt;

==The mass of vegetation==

The mass of vegetation is only likely to have an influence on slope stability when larger trees are growing on the slope. A tree of 30–50m height is likely to have a loading of approximately 100–150&amp;nbsp;kN/m2. The larger trees should be planted at the toe of the slope with a potential rotational failure as this could increase the factor of safety by 10%. However, if the tree is planted at the top of the slope this could reduce the factor of safety by 10%. A suggested design vegetation envelope which shows which type of plant should be grown at each level of the slope.&lt;ref name=Greenwood2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Perry/&gt;

Each slope stability situation should be considered independently for the vegetation involved. It is important to remember that transpiration will reduce the weight of the slope as moisture is lost. This can be significant on slopes of marginal stability.&lt;ref name=Greenwood2004/&gt;

If larger trees are removed from the toe area of a slope there will be both a reduction in soil strength due to the loss of evapotranspiration effects and a reduction in applied loading which may result in temporary suctions in clay soils which could lead to softening as the available water is drawn in to compensate for the suction forces. This is similar to the recognised softening of overconsolidated clays due to the relaxation of overburden pressures when placed in the top layers of an embankment from deep cutting.&lt;ref name=Greenwood2004/&gt;

==Mechanical reinforcement of roots==

Roots reinforce the soil through growing across failure planes, root columns acting as piles, and through limiting surface erosion.&lt;ref name=Perry/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cammeraat&gt;Cammeraat, C.; van Beek, R. &amp; Kooijman, A. 2005, ‘Vegetation succession and its consequences for slope stability in SE Spain’, Plant and Soil, vol. 278, no.1, pp.&amp;nbsp;135–147.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Morgan&gt;Morgan, R. 2007, ‘Vegetative-based technologies for erosion control’, in Stokes, A.
(eds), Eco- and Ground Bioengineering: The use of vegetation to Improve Slope Stability,  
Dordrecht, London, pp.&amp;nbsp;265–272.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Root growth across failure planes===

When roots grows across the plane of potential failure there is an increase in shear strength by binding particles. The roots anchor the unstable surficial soil into the deeper stable layers or bedrock.&lt;ref name=Mattia/&gt; This most readily occurs when there is rapid deep growth (1.5m deep) of roots which last for more than two years. However it is important to note that the strength exerted by roots generally only extends down to 1m while most failures occur between 1.2 – 1.5m soil depth.&lt;ref name=Perry/&gt;

===Root reinforcement model===

The root reinforced earth root model is the result of the root elongation across a potential slip plane which produces a tensile root force which is transferred to the soil by cohesive and frictional contacts between the root and the soil.&lt;ref&gt;van Beek, L.; Wint, J.; Cammeraat, L. &amp; Edwards, J. 2005, ‘Observation and stimulation of root reinforcement on abandoned Mediterranean slopes’, Plant &amp; Soil, vol. 278, no.1, pp.&amp;nbsp;55–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tensile root strength contribution and pull out resistance===

The pull out resistance of a root is the measured resistance of root structure to be pulled out of the ground and is likely to be only a little less than the measured tensile strength of the root which is the roots resistance to breaking as measured in the laboratory. In the cases where there is no pull out data available the tensile strength data maybe used as a rough guide to the maximum pull out resistance available.&lt;ref name=Greenwood2004/&gt;

The tensile root strength of a range of diameters over a range of species has been tested in the laboratory and has been found to be approximately 5 – 60MN/m2. In order for the root to actually enhance slope stability the root must have sufficient embedment and adhesion with the soil. The way that roots interact with the soil is intricate but for engineering purposes the available force contributions may be measured with in situ pull out tests.&lt;ref name=Greenwood2004/&gt;

===Root morphology and modes of failure===

The root length and the type of root branching effects the way that root failure occurs&lt;ref name=Greenwood2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Norris&gt;Norris, J. 2005, ‘Root reinforcement by hawthorn and oak roots on a highway cut-slope in Southern England’, Plant and Soil, vol. 278, no. 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;43–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Three different modes of failure have been identified in hawthorn roots which relate to the root soil relationship which is shown in the shape of the roots and the shape of the failure curve. Roots which have no branches tend to fail in tension and pull straight out of the ground with minimal resistance. Roots which have multiple branches generally fail in stages as each branch breaks inside the soil. These roots can then separated into two different groups; 1) those that initially reach their maximum peak force and then maintain a high force that progressively decreases as the root branches fail after significant strain and 2) those that break with increasingly applied force. In a number of tests considerable adhesion between a segment of the root and the soil can be measured prior to the root eventually slipping out of the soil mass.&lt;ref name=Greenwood2004/&gt;

===Type A failure===

Roots that do not have branches generally fail in tension and pull straight out of the ground with only minimal resistance. The root reaches its maximum pullout resistance then rapidly fails at a weak point. The root easily slips out of the soil due to the gradual tapering (progressive decrease in root diameter along its length) which means that as the root is pulled out it is moving through a space that is larger than its diameter which consequently has no further bonds or interaction with the surrounding soil.&lt;ref name=Norris/&gt;

===Type B failure===

Type B failure occurs when branched roots initially reach their maximum peak resistance then sustain a high resistance which slowly reduces as the branches of the roots fail after significant strain. In some tests considerable adhesion between a section of the root and the soil mass can be measured before the root eventually slips out. Forked roots require a greater force to be pulled out as the cavity above the fork is thinner than the root which is trying to move through the cavity, this can then result in deformation of the soil as the root moves through the soil.&lt;ref name=Norris/&gt;

===Type C failure===

Roots that have multiple branches or forked branches also can undergo tensile failure but predominantly fail in stages as each branch breaks within the soil. These roots break with increasingly applied force in stages in the form of stepped peaks corresponding to the progressive breaking of roots of greater diameters. The root progressively releases its bonds with the soil until final tensile failure.&lt;ref name=Norris/&gt;

In some cases when the root has a sinusoidal shape with many small rootlets along its length the root reaches its maximum pull out resistance on straightening and then breaks at the weakest point, however at this point the root is not pulled out of the soil as it adheres and interacts with the soil producing a residual strength. If pulling was stopped at this point, the root would give increased strength to the soil. However, if the root is completely pulled out of the ground then there is no further interaction with soil and therefore no increase in soil strength is provided.&lt;ref name=Norris/&gt;

===Factors which affect root pull out resistance===

Studies have shown&lt;ref name=Norris/&gt; that the pull out resistance of hawthorn and oak roots are affected by intra species differences, inter-species variations and root size (diameter) in a similar as way as root tensile strength varies (as measured in the laboratory). In the pull out test the applied force acting on the root acts across a larger root area, which involves multiple branches, longer lengths) than the short (approximately 150mm) length of root used in tensile strength tests. In pull out test the root is likely to fail at weak points such as branching points, nodes or damaged areas.

The studies also showed&lt;ref name=Norris/&gt; that there is a positive correlation between maximum root pull out resistance and root diameter for hawthorn and oat root. Smaller diameter roots had a lower pull out resistance or breaking force than the larger diameter roots.

===Root columns acting as piles===

Trees and root columns can prevent shallow mass movement through acting as piles when there is buttressing and soil arching through a woody deep root system which has multiple sinker roots with embedded stems and laterals.&lt;ref name=Perry/&gt;

===Limitation of surface erosion===

Vegetation can also be used to control water erosion by limiting surface processes such as sheet wash and overland flow.&lt;ref name=Cammeraat/&gt;&lt;ref name=Morgan/&gt; Vegetation can provide a considerable contribution to the stability of slope through enhancing soil cohesion. This cohesion is dependent upon the morphological characteristics of root systems and the tensile strength of single roots.&lt;ref name=Mattia/&gt;

There is considerable evidence of fine roots resisting surface erosion. The role of fine roots in general slope stability is not fully understood. It is thought that the fine roots help keep the surface soil together and prevent surface erosion. The fine root network may have an apparent enhanced cohesion which is comparable to geosynthetic mesh elements. The limitation of surface erosion processes is particularly apparent in areas of shrub and grass where the fine root distribution is consistent and clearly defined, however cohesion is generally limited to the top 1m of soil.&lt;ref name=Greenwood2004/&gt;
