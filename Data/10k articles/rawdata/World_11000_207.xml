      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1225">In [[Armenian mythology]], '''Azhdahak''' ({{lang-hy|Աժդահակ}}) was a man-vishap (man-[[dragon]]). Vishaps are believed to live in high mountains, in big lakes, in the sky, and in the clouds. They are believed to roar and sweep away everything in their path, especially when descending onto lakes. It is believed that a thousand-year-old vishap can absorb the whole world. 

According to [[Movses Khorenatsi]], Azhdhak was a king of the Marrs (also known as the [[Medes]]), and the grandfather of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]]; i.e., [[Astyages]]. Movses Khorenatsi wrote that Azhdhak was killed by Armenian king [[Tigran Orontid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Azmari'', who may be either male or female, are skilled at singing extemporized verses, accompanying themselves on either a ''[[masenqo]]'' (one-stringed fiddle) or ''[[krar]]'' (lyre).  ''Azmari'' often perform in drinking establishments called ''tejbeit'', which specialize in the serving of ''[[tej]]'' (honey mead). The Azamri introduced the popular [[Tizita]] ballad form.&lt;ref name="dag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts.cornell.edu/english/_lib/pdf/fa08_english_cu.pdf|title=Tizita: A New World Interpretation|accessdate=2010-02-05 |author=Dag Woubshet|year=2008|work=English at Cornell: A newsleter from the Department of English|publisher=[[Cornell University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baltic 21''' is a plan to cooperate on implementing regional sustainable development. It is managed by the [[Council of the Baltic Sea States]] (CBSS).{{r|hist}}

The mission of Baltic 21 is to contribute towards advancing sustainable development in the Baltic Sea Region by coordinating goals and activities, and by serving as a forum for cooperation across borders and between stakeholder groups.

==History==
Initiated by the [[Prime Minister]]s of the [[Baltic Sea]] countries in 1996, '''Baltic 21''' is a regional expression of the global [[Agenda 21]] adopted by the [[United Nations]] “[[Earth Summit]].”&lt;ref name=hist&gt;http://www.cbss.org/sustainable-prosperous-region/egsd-baltic-2030-2/&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, the CBSS updated the plan in accordance with UN's ''[[Sustainable Development Goals|Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]]''. The CBSS Expert Group on Sustainable Development created the '''Baltic 2030 Action Plan''', specifically tailored for the BSR to guide macro-regional stakeholders through the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The senior adviser was Krista Kampus.{{r|hist}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.balticseafuture.org/-/media/files/balticseafuture/krista-kampus.ashx&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, a presentation of the work involved to archive the targets was given in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seit.ee/file_dl.php?file_id=550&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
As a multinational team, members of Baltic 21 are government ministries and agencies from the 11 Baltic Sea states, the [[European Commission]], numerous intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations, academic and financial institutions, as well as local, city and business networks. The Baltic 21 network brings together people who are active in sectors including [[agriculture]], [[education]], [[energy]], [[fisheries]], [[forests]], [[industry]], [[tourism]], [[transport]] and [[spatial planning]].

The Baltic 21 process is steered, coordinated and monitored by the Senior Officials Group (SOG) consisting of representatives of the member countries, organizations and institutions.

'''Bolyarka''' is a [[Bulgaria]]n [[beer]] brand ({{lang-bg|Болярка}}) from the city of [[Veliko Tarnovo]]. The company was founded in 1892 by the HadjiSlavchevi brothers, five years after the first brewery in Tarnovo was founded in 1887 by the German Artur Wilser. During the latter part of the 20th century the beer was called simply ''Velikotarnovsko pivo'', renamed ''Bolyarka'' in 2000, in honour of the city's history as the capital of the [[Second Bulgarian Kingdom]] and home of the ''[[bolyar]]s''. &lt;ref&gt;[http://boliarka.com/site/za_nas/istoria2.html Bolyarka – History], Bolyarka.bg. Retrieved Mar 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company currently has four own brands –
* Bolyarka Light (Болярка светло, 4.1% ABV)
* Bolyarka Dark (Болярка тъмно, 5% ABV)
* Bolyarka Weiss (Болярка вайс, [[wheat beer]], 5.4% ABV)
* Bolyarka Live (Болярка живо, [[ale]])

The company brews several other Bulgarian brands, such as ''Schweik'' and ''Balkansko'', and it also imports several brands, including [[Warsteiner]] and [[König Ludwig Schlossbrauerei|Kaltenberg]]. &lt;ref name="brands"&gt;[http://boliarka.com/site/produkti/boliarka_svetlo.html Bolyarka – Brands], Bolyarka.bg.

The '''Botswana Movement for Democracy''' ('''BMD''') is a new opposition [[political party]] in [[Botswana]]. It was established in 2010 by MPs and other politicians who split from the ruling [[Botswana Democratic Party]] over differences with [[Ian Khama]], the BDP's leader and President of Botswana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-05-29/botswana-breakaway-party-launched-in-split-with-khama-update1-.html | title=Botswana Breakaway Party Launched in Split With Khama (Update1) | publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek | date=29 May 2010 | accessdate=27 October 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110416212446/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-05-29/botswana-breakaway-party-launched-in-split-with-khama-update1-.html | archivedate=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the first party to split from the BDP, which has ruled Botswana since [[Independence of Botswana|independence]] in 1966. Its leader is [[Gomolemo Motswaledi]], elected on May 2, 2011 at the party's inaugural congress. [[Botsalo Ntuane]],  currently MP for Gaborone West South constituency and the Leader of the Opposition in Parliament, was elected as party Vice President. [[Sydney Pilane]], who had been serving as the party's Public Relation's Officer since its formation, lost his bid for Party President to Motswaledi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.botswanaguardian.co.bw/newsdetails.php?nid=1882&amp;cat=BG%20News The Battle for BMD] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720034520/http://www.botswanaguardian.co.bw/newsdetails.php?nid=1882&amp;cat=BG%20News |date=July 20, 2011 }},''Botswana Guardian'', 3 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Preamble of the Constitution of the BMD, the party was founded "to defend and advance the rights of the peoples of Botswana during and in order to interrupt and reverse the progressive destruction of their independence and the  creation  of  what,  by  most  accounts,  threatens  to  be  an authoritarian government". The document goes on to stress that is aims to remove the current "undemocratic" government of Botswana "through constitutional and democratic means" with the aim of restoring and promoting "a united, non-racial, non-sexist and democratic Botswana." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmd.org.bw/download/BMD_Constitution.pdf Constitution of the BMD]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Croire"''' ([[English language|English]] title: "Trust") was the [[Luxembourg]]ish entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1988]], performed in [[French language|French]] by [[Belgium|Belgian]] singer [[Lara Fabian]], an at the time 18-year-old up and coming artist, and some twenty years later an established performer in all of the world.

The song is a ballad, with Fabian singing that she wants to believe in the good of humanity, rather than its dark side. She sings that ''"we have love within us"'', which is her central belief. Fabian also recorded the song in [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]] language versions, as "Trust" and "Glaub'" respectively.

The song was performed seventeenth on the night (following [[Belgium]]'s [[Reynaert]] with "[[Laissez briller le soleil]]" and preceding [[Italy]]'s [[Luca Barbarossa]] with "[[Vivo (Ti scrivo)]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 90 points, placing 4th in a field of 21.

It was succeeded as [[Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest|Luxembourgish representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1989|1989 Contest]] by [[Park Café]] with "[[Monsieur (song)|Monsieur]]". In 1999 "Croire" was included as a bonus track on Lara Fabian's eponymously titled [[Lara Fabian (French album)|debut album]], originally released in 1991.

1988 was the last year Luxembourg ended in the top 5 and it was also the last year Luxembourg ended in the top 10

'''"Dile que la quiero"''' ({{IPA-es|ˈdile ke la ˈkjeɾo}}, "Tell Her that I Love Her") was the [[Spain|Spanish]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2001]], performed in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] by [[David Civera]].

The song was written by [[Alejandro Abad]] who had represented Spain at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994|1994 Contest]] with "[[Ella no es ella]]". It appears on the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2001]] compilation album misspelled as "Dole Que la Quiero".  It appears on Civera's album of the same name, with the introduction part repeated, making it slightly longer.  The album also contains a remix version so therefore three versions of the song officially exist.

"Dile que la quiero" was performed thirteenth on the night, following [[Ireland]]'s [[Gary O'Shaughnessy]] with "[[Without Your Love (Gary O'Shaughnessy song)|Without Your Love]]" and preceding [[France]]'s [[Natasha St-Pier]] with "[[Je n'ai que mon âme]]". At the close of voting, it had received 76 points, placing 6th in a field of 23.

The song was succeeded as [[Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest|Spanish representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2002|2002 Contest]] by [[Rosa López|Rosa]] with "[[Europe's Living a Celebration]]".

'''Dobričić''' is an ancient red [[wine]] [[grape]] variety from the island of [[Šolta]] off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast in [[Croatia]]. Some areas still grow Dobričić – many vineyards were left to grow wild following World War II. 

== Ancestry ==
It is one parent of the [[Plavac Mali]] red wine grape variety;&lt;ref name="MeredithZAP"&gt;{{cite news | author=Meredith, C | url=http://www.zinfandel.org/about_zin/pdf/2002_01_Looking_for_Zin_in_Croatia.pdf | format=PDF | title=Looking for Zinfandel in Croatia | publisher=Zinfandel Express | date=January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; the other one is [[Zinfandel]], a grape variety also known as Crljenak Kaštelanski in Croatia, from where it originates.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 130 &amp; 786"&gt;{{cite book | author=Robinson, J (ed) | title=The Oxford Companion to Wine | edition=3rd | pages=130 &amp;amp; 786 | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=2006 | isbn=0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Vinologue" /&gt;

== Agriculture ==
Historically, it was prone to mold, while [[Zinfandel|Crljenak]] was prone to be overly heat sensitive, thus the cross of Plavac Mali resulted in a grape that had neither of these negative attributes and was perfect for the region. &lt;ref name="Vinologue" /&gt;

{{About|the group of countries||E7 (disambiguation){{!}}E7}}

The '''E7''' (short for "Emerging 7") is the seven countries  China, India, Brazil, Mexico, Russia, Indonesia and Turkey, grouped together because of their major [[Emerging markets|emerging economies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12133254|title=BBC News - UK economy risks 'playing in slow lane of history'|date=2011-01-07|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by the economists [[John Hawksworth (economist)|John Hawksworth]] and Gordon Cookson at [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pwc.com/la/en/publications/assets/world_2050_brics.pdf|title=The World in 2050|last=Hawksworth|first=John|date=|website=PricewaterhouseCoopers|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The growth of the E7 countries has been characterized in comparison with its size versus the [[Group of Seven]] countries, which had made up many of the largest economies in the world in the 20th century. In 2011, the E7 were predicted to have larger economies than the [[G7 (economies)|G7]] countries by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investmentweek.co.uk/investment-week/news/1936788/china-overtake-2018-pwc |title=China to overtake US by 2018 - PwC |author=Emma Dunkley |date=2011-01-13|accessdate= 2012-04-16|work=[[Investment Week]] |publisher=Incisive Financial Publishing Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2014, the E7 countries had passed the G7 countries based on [[purchasing power parity]] terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GZzgDQAAQBAJ|title=Promotional Strategies and New Service Opportunities in Emerging Economies|last=Vipin|first=Nadda|last2=Sumesh|first2=Dadwal|last3=Roya|first3=Rahimi|date=2017-01-10|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=9781522522072|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other estimates said the E7 were 80% of the G7 in 2016 in PPP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hhiHDQAAQBAJ|title=Integral Operational Leadership: A relationally intelligent approach to sustained performance in the twenty-first century|last=Park|first=Greg|date=2016-11-18|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317070863|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, another prediction estimated that the E7's economies would be larger than the G7 in 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DIF4CwAAQBAJ|title=Managing and Leading People Through Organizational Change: The theory and practice of sustaining change through people|last=Hodges|first=Dr Julie|date=2016-02-03|publisher=Kogan Page Publishers|isbn=9780749474201|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; PWC predicted that the E7 could be 75% larger than the G7 in PPP terms by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gem_CwAAQBAJ|title=The BRICS and Beyond: The International Political Economy of the Emergence of a New World Order|last=Xing|first=Li|date=2016-03-16|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317040002|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Estatuto Orgânico de Macau''''' (abbreviated '''EOM'''; [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for '''Organic Statute of Macau''') was an [[Organic law|organic statute]] that provided for government in [[Portuguese Macau]]. Approved on February 17, 1976, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] legislation reclassified Macau as a "Chinese territory under Portuguese administration" (''território chinês sob administração portuguesa''). On December 20, 1999, the ''Estatuto Orgânico'' was replaced by the [[Macau Basic Law]], as the territory became a [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Region]] of the [[People's Republic of China]].

'''Euro1080''' was the first commercial broadcaster in Europe to broadcast full-time [[high-definition television]] (HDTV) content. It was founded by [[Gabriel Fehervari]] in 2004 and is owned by Alfacam.

The name originates from the 1080 lines of vertical resolution in the signal broadcast, which is [[1080i50]] - 1920 x 1080 at an interlaced frame rate of 50 Hz. The signal uses [[Dolby Digital]] 5.1 sound.

The headquarters and studios are located in Belgium at the Eurocam Media Center. The parent company of Euro1080 is the Belgium-based Alfacam Group.

Euro1080 began broadcasting on January 1, 2004, from the [[Astra 1H]] satellite at [[Astra 19.2°E|19.2° east]] and was [[free-to-air|free to air]] during its first few months. Thereafter, a €200 conditional access card was required to watch the flagship channel HD1.  

In addition to HD1, whose content is primarily HDTV showcasing for regular users, a second channel was soon created, HD2 focusing on live and recorded HDTV broadcasts of special event for selected theatres. Euro1080 currently broadcasts HD1 and HD3 on the following satellite:

* [[Eutelsat]] W3A at 7°E, 10.880 MHz, DVB-S2, QPSK, Symbol rate 13.333 Mbit/s, Vertical, FEC 4/5, MPEG4.

It is also possible to receive it from a growing number of cable operators. 

Two channels have been temporarily removed recently:{{when|date=July 2013}}
* HD2 (previously HDevents or Hde): broadcasts premium events in [[pay-per-view]].
* HD5 (timesharing with HD2): promotional channel, broadcasting a six-minute informative video about HDTV and what Euro1080 is, as well a brief glimpse of the previous day's footage.

A new channel was launched in 2008:
* [[HD3]]: Culture with music. (HD1 then became a sports channel.)

In October 2005, HD1 and HD2 simulcast in both MPEG-4 and MPEG-2. This dual encoding lasted until 2007. 

[[Telenet (Belgium)|Telenet]], the main cable operator in [[Flanders]], confirmed as part of its launch announcement of "Telenet Digital TV" on June 16, 2005, that it would sell HDTV set-top-boxes from June 2006.

Since July 2005, the cable operator Integan has broadcast HDTV in the outskirts of the city of [[Antwerp]], in partnership with Euro1080.

On October 1, 2006, Euro1080 started a new digital culture channel named EXQI. The first target audience was the Flemish and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] market, but the channel has expansion plans to more than 10 channels for the major European countries.

On January 7, 2007, Euro1080 switched to [[MPEG-4 AVC]] for its satellite broadcasts. MPEG-2 broadcasts for HD1 were switched off on January 1, 2008.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1345">'''FM Stereo Johor Bahru''' or '''FMJB''' and '''JBFM''' was a regional radio station operated by [[Radio Televisyen Malaysia]] (RTM) exclusively for the [[Johor Bahru]] metropolitan area, and as a complement to [[Johor FM]]. The station came into being on 20 October 1988 by taking over the FM Stereo transmitter of the old [[Johor FM]], then known as Radio Malaysia Johor Bahru. Similar to [[Johor FM]], the station featured local news and entertainment for 18 hours a day. Unlike [[Johor FM]] though which has Johor statewide coverage, FMJB could only be heard in South Johor and Singapore transmitting on FM 107.5&amp;nbsp;MHz from Johor Bahru. In its final few years of broadcasting, the station was simply a repeater of Johor FM. It ceased broadcasts around March 2011.  [[Radio24 (Malaysia)]] started using the same frequency from 27 December 2011 for test transmissions from Gunung Pulai, Johor. Official transmission started in January 2012.[https://twitter.com/bernamaradio24/status/151648381754806272]

A '''fictional country''' is a country that is made up for fictional stories, and does not exist in real life, or one that people believe in without proof. 
Sailors have always mistaken low clouds for land masses, and in later times this was given the name [[Dutch cape]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Schott's Quintessential Miscellany, p.119, {{ISBN|978-1-4088-1577-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other fictional lands appear most commonly as settings or subjects of [[myth]], literature, film, or video games. They may also be used for technical reasons in actual reality for use in the development of specifications, such as the fictional country of ''[[Bookland]]'', which is used to allow [[European Article Number|EAN]] "country" codes 978 and 979 to be used for ISBN numbers assigned to books, and code 977 to be assigned for use for [[ISSN]] numbers on magazines and other periodicals.  Also, the [[ISO 3166]] country code "ZZ" is reserved as a fictional country code,{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}.

Fictional countries appear commonly in stories of early [[science fiction]] (or [[scientific romance]]). Such countries supposedly form part of the normal Earth landscape although not located in a normal atlas. Later similar tales often took place on [[planets in science fiction|fictional planets]].

[[Jonathan Swift]]'s protagonist, [[Gulliver's Travels|Lemuel Gulliver]], visited various strange places. [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] placed adventures of [[Tarzan]] in areas in Africa that, at the time, remained mostly unknown to the West and to the East. Isolated islands with strange creatures and/or customs enjoyed great popularity in these authors' times. By the 19th century, when Western explorers had surveyed most of the Earth's surface, this option was lost to Western culture. Thereafter fictional [[utopia]]n and [[dystopia]]n societies tended to spring up on other [[planet]]s or in space, whether in human colonies or in alien societies originating elsewhere. Fictional countries can also be used in stories set in a distant future, with other political borders than today.

[[Superhero]] and secret agent [[comic books|comic]]s and some [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]]s also use fictional countries on Earth as backdrops. Most of these countries exist only for a single story, a TV-series episode or an issue of a comic book. There are notable exceptions, such as [[Qumar]] and [[Equatorial Kundu]] in ''[[The West Wing]]'', [[Marvel Comics]] [[Latveria]] and [[DC Comics]] [[Qurac]] and [[Bialya]].

==Purposes==
Fictional countries often deliberately resemble or even represent some real-world country or present a utopia or dystopia for commentary. Variants of the country's name sometimes make it clear what country they really have in mind.  By using a fictional country instead of a real one, authors can exercise greater freedom in creating characters, events, and settings, while at the same time presenting a vaguely familiar locale that readers can recognize. A fictional country leaves the author unburdened by the restraints of a real nation's actual history, politics, and culture, and can thus allow for greater scope in plot construction and be exempt from criticism for vilifying an actual nation, political party, or people.  The fictional "Tomania" (a [[parody]] of [[Nazi Germany]] named after [[ptomaine]]) serves as a setting for [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s [[The Great Dictator]] and skewers a régime infamous for religious bigotry, militarism, racism, diplomatic bullying, and violations of civil liberties.

[[File:Dictator charlie2.jpg|thumbnail|Charlie Chaplin mocks [[Adolf Hitler]] in a setting that ridicules Nazi Germany and its leadership, and uses [[double cross (betrayal)|double-cross]]es as mockery of the Nazi [[swastika]].]]

Fictional countries are also invented for the purpose of military training scenarios,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navynews.co.uk/articles/2001/0107/0001072701.asp|title=Navy News - News Desk - News - HMS Edinburgh works out in the Pacific|publisher=www.navynews.co.uk|accessdate=2008-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. the group of islands around [[Hawaii]] were assigned the names "Blueland" and "Orangeland" in the international maritime exercise, [[RIMPAC 98]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0WDQ/is_/ai_53001543|title=RIMPAC simulates conflict between divided countries - Asian Political News|publisher=findarticles.com|accessdate=2008-12-14 | date=1998-08-03}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/rimpac.htm|title=Rim of the Pacific Exercise (RIMPAC)|publisher=www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate=2008-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In survey research==
Fictional countries have been created for polling purposes. When polled in April 2004, 8% of British people believed that the [fictional] country of Luvania would soon join the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/04/29/luvania_eu/|title= Brits welcome Luvania to EU|author= Haines, Lester|date= 2004-04-29|publisher= ''The Register''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1989 General Social Survey, U.S. respondents were asked to rate the social status of people of "Wisian" background, a fictional national heritage.  While a majority of respondents said they could not place the Wisians in the U.S. social hierarchy, those who did ranked their status as quite low, giving an average of 4.12 on a 9-point scale, where 9 was the highest social standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFDD123DF93BA35752C0A964958260|title= Bias Thrives In a Vacuum|date= January 8, 1992|publisher= ''New York Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Once you let the Wisians in, the neighborhood goes to pot," quipped ''Time Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,974679,00.html?promoid=googlep|title= American Notes: Ethnicity|date= January 20, 1992|publisher= ''Time''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The find confirms that Ophir was a place where gold was imported from, although its location remains unknown.)

'''5 Days Off''' is a festival that includes music and cultural events in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]]. It started in 2001 as spin-off of [[Ghent, Belgium]]'s [[Ten Days Off Festival]].

==History==
'''[[10 Days Off]]''' began as 10 Days Of Techno in 1995. A couple of years later the name was changed to 10 Days Off and since then all genres of electronic music could be seen, heard and experienced at the festival.

5 Days Off is the first multi-day indoor dance event in the Netherlands. It has grown out of a fairly small festival in the Amsterdam [[Melkweg]] into a true citywide festival, which now also involves [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]] and [[De Balie]].

Nowadays, 5 Days Off is an important cultural meeting with a reputation reaching far across the borders, giving its young public five days of nightclubbing, live shows and performances. Since 2001, the organization puts together a program which contains a strong mix of acknowledged names and upcoming talents from the Netherlands and abroad. The organization is continuously following the latest developments within the ever-evolving music industry and club culture. The festival attracts more than twenty thousand visitors annually.

Five nights in a row, the best artists will be performing in the Melkweg and Paradiso. In the past, 5 Days Off has featured performances by [[Daft Punk]], [[The Gaslamp Killer]], [[Darkside (band)|Darkside]], [[SBTRKT]], [[Hudson Mohawke]], [[Flying Lotus]], [[Jeff Mills]], [[Netsky (musician)|Netsky]], [[Dizzee Rascal]] and [[Monolake]]. Before the nighttime program kicks off, the festival presents an Art program in De Balie. This is a diverse side program that gives a platform to other art disciplines like film, photography, media art, graphic design, fashion, and lifestyle.

In 2015, 5 Days Off will celebrate its 15th birthday.

A '''GPS satellite''' is a [[satellite]] used by the NAVSTAR [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS). The first satellite in the system, Navstar 1, was launched February 22, 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1978-020A |title=Navstar 1 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=27 April 2016 |website=[[NASA]] |publisher= |access-date=25 July 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GPS [[satellite constellation]] is operated by the [[50th Space Wing]] of the [[United States Air Force]].

The GPS satellites circle the Earth at an altitude of about 20,000&amp;nbsp;km (12,427 miles) and complete two full orbits every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/space_geodesy/ATLAS/gps.html|title=The Global Positioning System|work=harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Block I satellites ==
[[File:Navstar.jpg|thumb|A Navstar GPS satellite undergoing pre-launch testing.]]
[[Rockwell International]] was awarded a contract in 1974 to build the first eight Block I satellites. In 1978 the contract was extended to build an additional three Block I satellites. Beginning with Navstar 1 in 1978, ten "Block I" GPS satellites were successfully launched. One satellite, "Navstar 7", was lost due to an unsuccessful launch on 18 December 1981.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url = ftp://tycho.usno.navy.mil/pub/gps/gpsb1.txt | title = BLOCK I SATELLITE INFORMATION | publisher = USNO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Block I satellites were launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base using [[Atlas (rocket family)|Atlas]] rockets that were converted [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s. The satellites were built by [[Rockwell International]] at the same plant in [[Seal Beach, CA]] where the [[S-II]] second stages of the [[Saturn V]] rockets had been built.&lt;ref name=wtec&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://www.wtec.org/loyola/satcom2/e_02.htm | title = Site: Boeing North American, Inc. | publisher = WTEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Block I series consisted of the concept validation satellites and reflected various stages of system development. Lessons learned from the 11 satellites in the series were incorporated into the fully operational Block II series.

Dual solar arrays supplied over 400 watts of power, charging NiCd batteries for operations in Earth's shadow. [[S-band]] communications were used for control and telemetry, while a [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] channel provided cross-links between spacecraft. A [[hydrazine]] propulsion system was used for orbital correction. The payload included two [[L-band]] [[GPS signals|navigation signals]] at 1575.42&amp;nbsp;MHz (L1) and 1227.60&amp;nbsp;MHz (L2).

The final Block I launch was conducted on 9 October 1985, but the last Block I satellite was not taken out of service until 18 November 1995, well past its 5-year design life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/navstar.htm|title=GPS (Navstar)|work=skyrocket.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Block II satellites ==

=== Initial Block II series ===
The Block II satellites were the first full scale operational GPS satellites, designed to provide 14 days of operation without any contact from the control segment. The prime contractor was [[Rockwell International]], which built a SVN 12 qualification vehicle after an amendment to the Block I contract. In 1983 the company was awarded an additional contract to build 28 Block II/IIA satellites.

Block II spacecraft were 3-axis stabilized, with ground pointing using [[reaction wheel]]s. Two solar arrays supplied 710 watts of power, while [[S band]] communications were used for control and telemetry. A UHF channel was used for cross-links between spacecraft. A hydrazine propulsion system was used for orbital correction. The payload included two [[L band]] [[GPS signals|navigation signals]] at 1575.42&amp;nbsp;MHz (L1) and 1227.60&amp;nbsp;MHz (L2). Each spacecraft carried 2 rubidium and 2 cesium clocks, as well as nuclear detonation detection sensors, leading to a mass of {{convert|1660|kg|lb|-1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/navstar-2.htm|title=GPS-2 (Navstar-2)|work=skyrocket.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of the nine satellites in the initial Block II series was launched February 14, 1989; the last was launched October 1, 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = ftp://tycho.usno.navy.mil/pub/gps/gpsb2.txt | title = BLOCK II SATELLITE INFORMATION | publisher = USNO}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final satellite of the series to be taken out of service was decommissioned on March 15, 2007, well past its 7.5 year design life.

=== Block IIA series ===
The Block IIA satellites were slightly improved versions of the Block II series, designed to provide 180 days of operation without contact from the control segment. However, the mass increased to {{convert|1816|kg|lb|-1}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/navstar-2a.htm|title=GPS-2A (Navstar-2A)|work=skyrocket.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteen satellites in the Block IIA series were launched, the first on November 26, 1990 and the last on November 6, 1997. Only one satellite of the Block IIA ([[USA-96|SVN-34]]) is still in service, broadcasting the PRN 18 signal.&lt;ref name="IIA-status"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?Do=constellationStatus | title=GPS CONSTELLATION STATUS | work=U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Center | accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the satellites in this series, numbers 35 and 36, are equipped with laser [[Retroreflector|retro-reflectors]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cddis.nasa.gov/bulletin_v9n5.html |title=CDDIS Bulletin - June 1994, Volume 9 No. 5 |publisher=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320120644/http://cddis.nasa.gov/bulletin_v9n5.html |archivedate=2009-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing them to be tracked independently of their radio signals, providing unambiguous separation of clock and ephemeris errors.

=== Block IIR series ===
[[File:GPS-IIR.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of a GPS-IIR satellite in orbit.]]
The Block IIR series are "replenishment" (replacement) satellites developed by [[Lockheed Martin]]. Each satellite weighs {{convert|4480|lb|kg|-1}} at launch and {{convert|2370|lb|kg|-1}} once on orbit.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/products/gps.html | title = Global Positioning management System IIR | publisher = Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first attempted launch of a Block IIR satellite failed on January 17, 1997 when the [[Delta II]] rocket exploded 12 seconds into flight. The first successful launch was on July 23, 1997. Twelve satellites in the series were successfully launched.
At least ten satellites in this block carried an experimental [[S-band]] payload for [[search and rescue]], known as [[Distress Alerting Satellite System]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gpsworld.com/innovation-the-distress-alerting-satellite-system-10883/ GPS World (January 2011) : The Distress Alerting Satellite System (DASS)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/features/2010/search-and-rescue.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Block IIR-M series ===
[[File:GPS-IIRM.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of a GPS-IIRM satellite in orbit.]]
The Block IIR-M satellites include a new military signal and a more robust civil signal, known as L2C.

=== Block IIF series ===
{{main|GPS Block IIF}}
[[File:Navstar-2F.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of a Navstar-2F satellite in orbit.]]
The Block IIF series are "follow-on" satellites developed by Boeing. The satellite has a mass of 1,630 kilograms (3,600&amp;nbsp;lb) and a design life of 12 years. The first Block IIF space vehicle was launched in May 2010 on a [[Delta IV]] rocket.&lt;ref name=bss&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/bss/g/launch_sched.html |title=Boeing Satellite Launch Schedule |publisher=Boeing |date=January 15, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The twelfth and final IIF launch was February 5, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://gpsworld.com/air-force-successfully-launches-gps-iif-12-satellite/ | title = Air Force successfully launches GPS IIF-12 satellite | publisher = GPS World | date = February 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Block III satellites ==

=== Block IIIA series ===
{{main|GPS Block IIIA}}
[[File:GPS Block IIIA.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of a GPS Block IIIA satellite in orbit.]]
GPS Block IIIA is the first series of third-generation GPS satellites, incorporating new signals and broadcasting at higher power levels. In September 2016, the Air Force awarded [[Lockheed Martin]] a contract option for two more Block IIIA satellites, setting the total number of GPS IIIA satellites to ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.af.mil/News/ArticleDisplay/tabid/223/Article/952894/smc-exercises-contract-options-to-procure-two-additional-gps-iii-satellites.aspx |title=SMC exercises contract options to procure two additional GPS III satellites |date=September 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 2018, the first GPS IIIA launch is scheduled for December 2018 by SpaceX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-10/gps-satellite-praised-by-pence-for-space-force-delayed-yet-again |title=The GPS Satellite Praised by Mike Pence for Space Force Is Delayed Yet Again |publisher=Bloomberg |date=August 10, 2018 |access-date=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Block IIIF series ===
{{main|GPS Block IIIF}}

The Block IIIF series (or "tranche") is the second set of GPS Block III satellites, which will consist of up to 22 space vehicles.&lt;ref name="insidegnss_20171122"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insidegnss.com/node/5695 |title=Next Tranche of GPS Satellites to be called GPS IIIFs |last=Divis |first=Dee Ann |publisher=Gibbons Media &amp; Research LLC |website=Inside GNSS |date=November 22, 2017 |access-date=December 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Block IIIF launches are expected to begin no earlier than 2025 and continue through 2034.&lt;ref name="gleckel-2017-11"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gps.gov/governance/advisory/meetings/2017-11/gleckel.pdf |title=GPS Status &amp; Modernization Program |publisher=U.S. Air Force |website=GPS.gov |last=Gleckel |first=Gerry |date=November 15, 2017 |access-date=December 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr ''' James Hunter Harvey Pirie''' [[FRSE]] [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh|FRCPE]] (10 December 1878&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.abps.org.uk/Awards/Roll_of_Distinguished_Philatelists/RDP_Background_20111231_LR.pdf Background notes on The Roll of Distinguished Philatelists September 2011]'', Roll of Distinguished Philatelists Trust, London, 2011. [https://www.webcitation.org/6OlHSBOTl Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt; – 27 September 1965&lt;ref name=LP&gt;"Dr. J.H. Harvey Pirie" in ''[[The London Philatelist]]'', Vol. 74, No. 876, December 1965, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a 20th century Scottish [[medical doctor]], [[philately|philatelist]], orchid-grower and [[bacteriology|bacteriologist]]. Pirie named the bacterial genus ''[[Listeria]]'' in honor of [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] and the [[Pirie Peninsula]] is named after him. [[Cape Mabel]] was named after his wife. In authorship he is known as '''J. H. H. Pirie'''.

==Life==
[[File:Scotia on Laurie Island.jpg|thumb|upright|alt= Rear view of a three-masted sailing ship with all sails furled, lying in an ice-covered sea.|thumb|260px|''Scotia'', anchored at [[Laurie Island]] in 1903]]
He was born in [[Glasgow]] the son of Dr John Pirie of 26 Elmbank Crescent.&lt;ref&gt;Glasgow Post Office Directory 1878&lt;/ref&gt;

Pirie earned his first medical degree at [[Glasgow University]] graduating MB ChB in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1902 until 1904 he participated in the [[Scottish National Antarctic Expedition]] on the ex-whaling ship [[Scotia (barque)|"Scotia"]], under [[William Speirs Bruce]], Pirie acting as both surgeon and geologist. This involved spending the majority of 1903 on a makeshift base on the [[South Orkney Islands]]. He went on to postgraduate studies at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and was awarded his doctorate (MD) in 1907 after producing his thesis - 'On the smaller polygonal cells of the grey matter of the spinal cord'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=J.H.H.|first=Pirie,|date=1907|title=On the smaller polygonal cells of the grey matter of the spinal cord|url=https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/19238|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1908 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[Daniel John Cunningham]], [[Alexander Bruce (neurologist)|Alexander Bruce]], [[Henry Littlejohn|Henry Harvey Littlejohn]] and [[David Waterston (anatomist)|David Waterston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later worked in a private medical practice in Scotland. In 1913, he joined the [[Colonial Medical Service]] in [[Kenya]] as a bacteriologist and he became deputy director at the [[South African Institute for Medical Research]] in [[Johannesburg]] from 1926 till 1941.

==Philately==
Pirie was a noted [[philatelist]] with a specialism in the philately of the polar regions. He was Editor of the ''South African Philatelist'' for thirty-six years, and wrote important works on the stamps of Swaziland and the New Republic.&lt;ref name=LP/&gt; He signed the [[Roll of Distinguished Philatelists]] in 1948&lt;ref name=LP/&gt; and in the same year, the [[Roll of Distinguished Philatelists of South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philatelysa.co.za/?/page/rdpsa RDPSA], [[Philatelic Federation of South Africa]], 2013.

'''Hubert Schmetz''' was [[Mayors of Moresnet|Mayor of Neutral Moresnet]], a small neutral territory, from 20 June 1885 until 15 March 1915.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Belgium.html#Moresnet&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Life==
Schmetz became mayor of Neutral Moresnet on 20 June 1885, succeeding [[Oskar Anton Bilharz]] to become the territory's fifth mayor. As mayor, Bilharz served as the territory's head of state, alongside two commissioners, one each from the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and [[Belgium]].

During his term, [[German invasion of Belgium|Germany invaded Belgium]] on 4 August 1914, initially leaving Neutral Moresnet as "an oasis in a desert of destruction".&lt;ref name="Musgrave1918"&gt;{{cite book |first=George Clarke |last=Musgrave |title=Under Four Flags for France |date=1918 |page=8 |chapter=The Belgian Prelude |chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/underfourflagsfo00musgiala#page/8 |publisher=D.&amp;nbsp;Appleton &amp;&amp;nbsp;Company |location=New York |hdl=2027/uc2.ark:/13960/t8qb9xr4b |lccn=18003816 |oclc=1157994 |ol=7209571M |quote=As a proof of German preparation, war had come automatically at 7&amp;nbsp;a.m., August 3 {{bracket|1914}}.

The pretty towns defended near the frontier were soon flaming ruins, the quaint neutral territory of Moresnet rising as an oasis in a desert of destruction.}}{{nbsp}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 147 Neutral Moresnet citizens were killed, though it is unclear whether they were killed inside the territory or in fighting outside its borders.

As a result of the occupation, Schmetz was removed from his post on 15 March 1915 and Germany appointed [[Wilhelm Kyll]] to succeed him. Neutral Moresnet was formally annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia on 27 June 1915, although the annexation never received international recognition.

With a term of nearly 30 years, Schmetz was Neutral Moresnet's second-longest serving mayor, having served more than a quarter of the territory's existence.

Students of the school have achieved success in music competitions in Serbia and abroad, averaging 100 awards per year, and receiving numerous awards for excellent performance and pedagogical achievements. One such example is the "Vuk Stefanovic Karadzic Award", received in 1999 from the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Serbia and Cultural and Educational Society of Serbia.

{{quotation|In music school, pupils are encouraged to work independently and to fulfill their duties, which has great influence on forming children’s characters... Pupils will not only learn how to play the instrument, but they will also be educated how to understand and enjoy music as a science, by learning theory of music scientific disciplines... Music school is a cultural institution that has a very serious task and has public responsibility for fulfilling it successfully.

'''''Kobarweng or Where is Your Helicopter?''''' (1992) is a short documentary directed by [[Johan Grimonprez]] that deals with the history of a remote village in the highlands of New Guinea. The videotape assembles archival footage and oral histories depicting the first encounter between the Irian Jaya people and the scientific crew, including anthropologists, of the Dutch [[Star Mountains]] Expedition.&lt;ref name=Helicoptor&gt;{{cite web|title=Kobarweng or Where is Your Helicopter|url=http://www.li-ma.nl/site/catalogue/art/johan-grimonprez/kobarweng-or-where-is-your-helicopter/63|publisher=LIMA|accessdate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The confrontation with the crew and their helictopter caused a shock that threw the worldview of the villagers upside down.&lt;ref name="To the Mountains of the Stars"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brongersma &amp; Venema|first=L.D. &amp; G.F.|title=To the Mountains of the Stars|year=1962|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event even entered their Sibil-tongue language; literally translated, weng means language, whilst kobar airplane.&lt;ref name="Mannen in het draagnet, mens- en wereldbeeld van de Nalum Sterrengebergte"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hylkema|first=S|title=Mannen in het draagnet, mens- en wereldbeeld van de Nalum Sterrengebergte|year=1974|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff|location='S-Gravenhage|isbn=978-90-247-1622-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kobarweng's'' title is an ironic reference to a question first posed to Grimonprez by a local man named Kaiang Tapor, who, upon Grimonprez's arrival in the village of Pepera after a three-day hike, asked him where his helicopter was. The footage in the film is traversed by a running band of script, reporting observations and remarks culled from anthropologists' interviews, eye-witness reports, and the reminiscences of those highlanders who recall those moments of 'first contact' between the white intruders ([[missionaries]], [[prospectors]], [[anthropologists]], [[adventurers]]) and the local inhabitants: "We never tell everything, we always keep something for the next anthropologist" they are candid enough to admit to [[Margaret Mead]], while another wit remarks: "We called the whites 'people of soap', but their shit smelled the same as ours."&lt;ref name=lsaesser&gt;{{cite web|last=Elsaesser|first=Thomas|title=Johan Grimonprez Kobarweng or Where is Your Helicopter?|url=http://www.thomas-elsaesser.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=91%3Aneuer-berliner-kunstverein&amp;catid=39%3Ablog-category-01&amp;Itemid=70&amp;limitstart=3|work=Neuer Berliner Kunstverein - Kobarweng|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Switching the roles of observer and observed, the relation implied in the anthropological representation is reversed: the desire of the observing anthropologist itself becomes “other”, “exotic”, an object of curiosity destabilised by the villager’s questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expo.argosarts.org/work.jsp?workid=44a7c4d9a96b4d52aed399c9df68ca7d |title=Open Archive #2 - Kobarweng or Where is Your Helicopter? |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Grimonprez: "''Kobarweng'' critically considers the myth of objectivity, the pretence of an epistemic and scientific detachment maintained not just by the anthropologist, but throughout the discourse of western science, where the observer finds himself caught in an alienated position of transcendence over his/her subject."&lt;ref name='Johan Grimonprez: "We must be over the rainbow!'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grimonprez &amp; Asselberghs|first=J. &amp; H.|title=Kobarweng or Where is Your Helicopter|journal=Johan Grimonprez: "We must be over the rainbow!|year=1998|volume=Centro Galego Arte COntemporanea|pages=85–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Midcyru''''' is a fictional land and is the setting for events that take place in [[The Night Angel Trilogy]]. The landscape is composed of many of the normal elements you would find in any natural realm. There is a main body of land, where most of the story takes place, as well as a few outlying islands. Midcyru is split into several small countries each with its own unique peoples, religions, magics and so on..

== The continent of Midcyru ==

=== Cenaria ===

Cenaria is a kingdom in western Midcyru. Its capital is Cenaria City, which is most well known for its powerful Sa'kagé underworld. Aided by [[Night_Angel_Trilogy#The_Talent|Talented]] assassins called wetboys, the Cenarian Sa'kagé controls all of the city's illicit trades ([[smuggling]], [[prostitution]], [[extortion]] etc.) and plays a notable role in the kingdom's political life, wielding more power than the king himself. By the time of the events described in the books Cenaria has little to no political or military power, being considered by its neighbours to be corrupt and weak. Eastern Cenaria has been occupied by the Lae'knaught Order for a long time.
Cenarians who show Talent can either apprentice as wetboys to become skilled killers for hire or apply to a mage's school in another country.
Most of the trilogy's storyline takes place in this country.

=== Waeddryn ===

A kingdom in central Midcyru ruled by queens from the city of Caernarvon, a center of trade and craftsmanship.

=== Khalidor ===

Khalidor is located in northern Midcyru and ruled by a line of tyrannical Godkings. Its population has been corrupted by the false goddess Khali, who feeds on human suffering. Khalidoran mages (called meisters and Vürdmeisters) use the unnatural vir, powered by a reservoir of magic that is collected from the life energy - or glore vyrden - of everyone who "prays" to Khali. Some Khalidoran Vürdmeisters also know the secrets of raising undead creatures known as krul and every variation thereof.

=== Ossein ===

Ossein is Cenaria's eastern neighbor. The Chantry, a school for female magae, is situated in Ossein.

=== Alitaera ===

A large country in southern Midcyru. The Sho'Fasti mages' school is located there. By the time of the trilogy's story, Alitaera had the most powerful army in Midcyru. The names and titles of Alitaera resemble those of [[Ancient Rome]].

=== Ceura ===

'Ceura' means 'sword' in the natives' tongue. The sa'ceurai are among the most skilled swordsmen in Midcyru, surpassing even Khalidoran Highlanders. The Ceurans have a very strict code of honor and show great respect for skillful and honorable fighters. According to their beliefs, a man's sword is his soul.
While officially a kingdom, Ceura has long been under the rule of Regents. Lantano Garuwashi has been proclaimed King after retrieving Ceur'caelestos, the Blade of Heaven, and Ceura has also acknowledged the rule of the High King.
Some of the Ceuran names sound Japanese, and the code of honor (including a [[harakiri]]-like suicide ritual) resembles the ways of the [[samurai]]. Its capital city is Aenu.

=== Friaku ===

A country in eastern Midcyru bordering Alitaera and Ymmur. Friaki are fierce warriors divided into clans which are led by goranthi - Talented warriors who go into battle half-naked and seem to resemble [[berserker]]s.

=== Lodricar ===

A country in northern Midcyru which has been occupied by Khalidor. Khalidorans and Lodricari dislike each other, but the Lodricari learned to use the vir and make up parts of the Khalidoran Godkings' army. Vürdmeister Neph Dada was a Lodricari.

=== Modai ===

A country in south-western Midcyru. The mages' school of Sho'Cendi is located there. Its capital city is Gan. It can be thought of as the loose fictional counterpart to India/the Middle East.

=== The Freeze ===

Territories in northern Midcyru populated by barbarian tribes. It is a mystical place- Kylar hears about many mythological creatures that apparently roam the Freeze.

=== Ymmur ===

Ymmur is the name of a country or territory in eastern Midcyru covered by [[steppe]]s and populated by a nomadic people. They are famous for their mounted archers armed with amazingly powerful Ymmuri shortbows.
Talented Ymmuri can become stalkers, hunters/killers akin to Cenarian wetboys. Unlike wetboys, however, stalkers kill for a cause rather than for money. The way their people are described is similar to the likeness of the people of Mongolia.

=== Locations outside of Midcyru ===
==== The Island Empire of Seth ====
The Sethi come from an [[archipelago]] to the west of Midcyru. Their capital is the city of Hokkai. Seth is famous for its wine and for its sailors. Although still called an [[empire]], Seth has lost all of its colonies over time. Sethi can be thought of as the loose fictional counterpart of Greece.

==== Gandu ====
An island-state to the south of Midcyru famous for its healers.

==== Planga ====
Planga is a small island-state near the western shore of Ceura and Modai.

==== Ladesh ====
Ladesh is a large continent/country to the south-west of Midcyru.It is so large that even a Ladeshian duke can hold an estate the size of Cenaria. It holds a [[monopoly]] for [[silk]] production. The Ladeshian system of titles is based on merit rather than inherited.

== Important Places ==
=== Screaming Winds ===

A [[garrison]] in the mountains separating Cenaria from Khalidor. Screaming Winds consists of three sets of walls that stretch across the only pass large enough to accommodate an army. Screaming Winds fell when the Khalidorians carrying Khali to Cenaria attacked the pass. The only person to survive the attack was Solon Tofusin.

=== Pavvil's Grove ===

A location in Cenaria close to the Ceuran border. The decisive battle between Cenarian rebels and the Khalidoran invaders takes place there.

=== Black Barrow (Trayethell) ===

Trayethell was a great city once, but it was devastated and sealed by mighty spells by Jorsin Alkestes when he defended it against Roygaris Ursuul's hordes of undead. For seven centuries the place has been known as Black Barrow and was barren along with most of eastern Khalidor.
After laying hands on Iures, the Staff of Law, Neph Dada managed to break the spells which were woven over Black Barrow (one to prevent the use of vir, one to prevent the re-raising of krul and one to hold a trapped Titan inside). After Neph and Khali were defeated, Trayethell was restored to its former beauty. High King Logan renamed it Elenea in honor of Elene Cromwyll and made it his capital.

=== Iaosian Forest (Ezra's Wood) ===

Residence of the Dark Hunter. Every living creature to enter the Wood has been killed by the Dark Hunter, with the exception of Kylar Stern and Durzo Blint, who briefly recovered Curoch from the Wood, and Feir Cousat, who enters attempting to retrieve Curoch (as Ceur'Caelestos, although he only obtains a hilt)

=== The Chantry (The Alabaster Seraph) ===

School for magae (female mages) in Ossein and headquarters of the Sisterhood.

=== Mount Thrall ===

Location of the Great Citadel built by the Khalidoran Godkings.

=== Tlaxini Maelstrom ===

The location of the Blue Ka'kari. The Maelstrom appeared when Durzo Blint threw the Ka'kari in the ocean.

=== Mount Tenji ===

An active volcano containing the Red Ka'kari. The volcano was dormant until Durzo Blint threw the Ka'kari into the mouth of the volcano.

=== Sho'cendi ===

Mages' school in Modai.

=== Sho'fasti ===

Mages' school in Alitaera.

'''Polis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɒ|l|ᵻ|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|[[:wikt:πόλις|πόλις]]}} {{IPA-grc|pólis|pron}}), plural '''''poleis''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɒ|l|eɪ|z}}, {{lang|grc|πόλεις}} {{IPA-el |póleːs|}}), literally means [[city]] in Greek. It can also mean a body of citizens. In modern historiography, ''polis'' is normally used to indicate the [[List of ancient Greek cities|ancient Greek city-states]], like [[Classical Athens]] and its contemporaries, and thus is often translated as "[[city-state]]". These cities consisted of a fortified city centre built on an acropolis or harbor and controlled surrounding territories of land (''[[khôra]]'').

The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] city-state developed during the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic]] period as the ancestor of city, state, and citizenship and persisted (though with decreasing influence) well into [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times, when the equivalent [[Latin]] word was ''civitas'', also meaning "citizenhood", while ''municipium'' applied to a non-sovereign local entity. The term "city-state", which originated in English (alongside the German ''Stadtstaat''), does not fully translate the Greek term. The ''poleis'' were not like other primordial ancient city-states like [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] or [[Sidon]], which were ruled by a king or a small [[oligarchy]], but rather political entities ruled by their bodies of citizens. The traditional view of archaeologists—that the appearance of [[urbanization]] at excavation sites could be read as a sufficient index for the development of a ''polis—''was criticised by François Polignac in 1984&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Polignac | first = François | language = French | title = La naissance de la cité grecque | place = Paris | year = 1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn | group = lower-alpha | An attempt to dissociate urbanization from state formation was undertaken by {{Citation | first = I | last = Morris | contribution = The early polis as city and state | editor1-first = J | editor1-last = Rich | editor2-first = A | editor2-last = Wallace-Hadrill | title = City and Country in the Ancient World | place = London | year = 1991 | pages = 27–40}}}} and has not been taken for granted in recent decades: the ''polis'' of Sparta, for example, was established in a network of villages. The term ''polis'', which in archaic Greece meant "city", changed with the development of the governance center in the city to signify "state" (which included its surrounding villages). Finally, with the emergence of a notion of citizenship among landowners, it came to describe the entire body of citizens. The ancient Greeks did not always refer to [[Athens]], [[Sparta]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], and other ''poleis'' as such; they often spoke instead of the Athenians, Lacedaemonians, Thebans and so on. The body of citizens came to be the most important meaning of the term ''polis'' in ancient Greece.

The [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] term that specifically meant the totality of ''urban'' buildings and spaces is ''[[asty]]'' ({{lang|grc|ἄστυ}}).

== The ''polis'' in Ancient Greek philosophy ==
[[Plato]] analyzes the ''polis'' in [[The Republic (Plato)|''The Republic'']], whose Greek title, Πολιτεία ([[Politeia]]), itself derives from the word ''polis''. The best form of government of the ''polis'' for Plato is the one that leads to the common good. The [[philosopher king]] is the best ruler because, as a philosopher, he is acquainted with the [[Form of the Good]]. In Plato's analogy of the [[ship of state]], the philosopher king steers the ''polis'', as if it were a ship, in the best direction.

Books II–IV of ''The Republic'' are concerned with Plato addressing the makeup of an ideal ''polis''. In ''The Republic'', Socrates is concerned with the two underlying principles of any society: mutual needs and differences in aptitude. Starting from these two principles, Socrates deals with the economic structure of an ideal ''polis''. According to Plato, there are five main economic classes of any ''polis'': producers, merchants, sailors/shipowners, retail traders, and wage earners. Along with the two principles and five economic classes, there are four virtues. The four virtues of a "just city" include, wisdom, courage, moderation, and justice. With all of these principles, classes, and virtues, it was believed that a "just city" (''polis'') would exist.

==Archaic and classical ''poleis''==
The basic and indicating elements of a ''polis ''are:
* Self-governance, autonomy, and independence (city-state)
* [[Agora]]: the social hub and financial marketplace, on and around a centrally located, large open space
* [[Acropolis]]: the citadel, inside which a temple had replaced the erstwhile [[Helladic period|Mycenaean]] ''anáktoron'' ([[palace]]) or [[Megaron|''mégaron'']] (hall)
* Greek urban planning and architecture, public, religious, and private (see [[Hippodamian plan]])
* [[Greek temple|Temples]], [[altar]]s, and sacred precincts: one or more are dedicated to the ''poliouchos'', the patron deity of the city; each ''polis'' kept its own particular [[festival]]s and customs (''[[Political religion]]'', as opposed to the individualized religion of later antiquity). Priests and priestesses, although often drawn from certain families by tradition, did not form a separate collegiality or class; they were ordinary citizens who on certain occasions were called to perform certain functions.
* [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|Gymnasia]]
* [[Ancient Greek theatre|Theatres]]
* Walls: used for protection from invaders
* [[Ancient Greek coinage|Coins]]: minted by the city, and bearing its symbols
* [[Greek colonies|Colonies]] being founded by the [[oikistes]] of the [[metropolis]]
* Political life: it revolved around the sovereign [[wikt:congregation|Ekklesia]] (the assembly of all adult male citizens for deliberation and voting), the standing [[Boule (ancient Greece)|boule]] and other civic or judicial councils, the [[archon]]s and other officials or magistrates elected either by vote or by lot, [[ancient Greek clubs|clubs]], etc., and sometimes punctuated by [[Stasis (political history)|stasis]] (civil strife between parties, factions or socioeconomic classes, e.g., aristocrats, oligarchs, democrats, tyrants, the wealthy, the poor, large, or small landowners, etc.).  They practised [[direct democracy]].
* Publication of state functions: laws, decrees, and major fiscal accounts were published, and criminal and civil trials were also held in public.
* [[Synoecism]], conurbation: Absorption of nearby villages and countryside, and the incorporation of their tribes into the substructure of the ''polis''. Many of a ''&lt;nowiki&gt;polis'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' citizens lived in the suburbs or countryside. The Greeks regarded the ''polis'' less as a territorial grouping than as a religious and political association: while the ''polis'' would control territory and colonies beyond the city itself, the ''polis'' would not simply consist of a geographical area. Most cities were composed of several [[tribe]]s or ''[[phylai]]'', which were in turn composed of ''[[phratry|phratries]]'' (common-ancestry lineages), and finally ''[[Genos|''génea'']]'' (extended families).
* [[:Category:Social classes in ancient Greece|Social classes]] and citizenship: Dwellers of the ''polis'' were generally divided into four types of inhabitants, with status typically determined by birth:
** Citizens with full legal and [[political rights]]—that is, free adult men born legitimately of citizen parents. They had the [[right to vote]], be elected into office, and [[bear arms]], and the obligation to serve when at war.
** Citizens without formal political rights but with full legal rights: the citizens' female relatives and underage children, whose political rights and interests were meant to be represented by their adult male relatives.
** Citizens of other ''poleis'' who chose to reside elsewhere (the [[metic]]s, μέτοικοι, ''métoikoi'', literally "transdwellers"): though free-born and possessing full rights in their place of origin, they had full legal rights but no political rights in their place of residence. Metics could not vote or be elected to office. A liberated slave was likewise given a metic's status if he chose to remain in the polis, at least that was the case in Athens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=92_Nz8jjrSUC&amp;pg=PA82 |title=The Law in Classical Athens |first=Douglas Maurice |last=MacDowell |publisher=[[Cornell University Press]] |year=1986 |page=82 |isbn=9780801493652}}&lt;/ref&gt; They otherwise had full personal and property rights, albeit subject to taxation.
** [[Slave]]s: [[Personal property|chattel]] in full possession of their owner, and with no privileges other than those that their owner would grant (or revoke) at will.

==Hellenistic and Roman==
During the [[Hellenistic period]], which marks the decline of the classical ''polis'', the following cities remained independent: [[Sparta]] until 195 BC after the [[War against Nabis]]. [[Achaean League]] is the last example of original Greek city-state federations (dissolved after the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)]]). The [[Cretan]] city-states continued to be independent (except [[Itanus]] and [[Arsinoe (Crete)|Arsinoe]], which lay under Ptolemaic influence) until the conquest of Crete in 69 BC by Rome. The cities of [[Magna Graecia]], with the notable examples of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] and [[History of Taranto|Tarentum]], were conquered by Rome in the late 3rd century BC. There are also some cities with recurring independence like [[Samos]], [[Priene]], [[Miletus]], and [[History of Athens|Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = City government in Hellenistic and Roman Asia minor | first = Sviatoslav | last = Dmitriev | page = 68 | isbn = 0-19-517042-3 | year = 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A remarkable example of a city-state that flourished during this era is [[Rhodes]], through its merchant navy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece | first = Nigel Guy | last = Wilson | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-aFtPdh6-2QC&amp;pg=PA627&amp;dq=Rhodes+Hellenistic+city+navy#v=onepage&amp;q=Rhodes%20Hellenistic%20city%20navy&amp;f=false | page = 627 | isbn = 978-0-415-97334-2 | year = 2006 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150317061354/http://books.google.com/books?id=-aFtPdh6-2QC&amp;pg=PA627&amp;dq=Rhodes+Hellenistic+city+navy#v=onepage&amp;q=Rhodes%20Hellenistic%20city%20navy&amp;f=false | archivedate = 2015-03-17 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; until [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|43 BC]] and the Roman conquest.

The Hellenistic [[Towns of ancient Greece#Katoikia|colonies and cities]] of the era retain some basic characteristics of a ''polis'', except the status of independence ([[city-state]]) and the political life. There is self-governance (like the new Macedonian title [[politarch]]), but under a ruler and king. The political life of the classical era was transformed into an individualized religious and philosophical view of life (see Hellenistic [[hellenistic philosophy|philosophy]] and [[hellenistic religion|religion]]). Demographic decline forced the cities to abolish the status of [[metic]] and bestow citizenship; in 228 BC, [[Miletus]] enfranchised over 1,000 Cretans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Milet I, 3 | pages = 33–38}}.{{clarify|please expand ref|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dyme, Greece|Dyme]] sold its citizenship for one talent, payable in two installments. The foreign residents in a city are now called [[paroikoi]]. In an age when most political establishments in Asia are kingdoms, the [[Chrysaorian League]] in Caria was a Hellenistic federation of ''poleis''.

During the [[Roman era]], some cities were granted the status of a ''polis'', or free city, self-governed under the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Coinage and Identity in the Roman Provinces | first1 = Christopher | last1 = Howgego | author1-link = Christopher Howgego | first2 = Volhker | last2 = Heuchert | first3 = Andrew | last3 = Burnett | url = https://books.google.com/?id=66HWcKwrOmEC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;dq=Polis+Roman#v=onepage&amp;q=Polis%20Roman&amp;f=false | page = 158 | isbn = 0-19-923784-0 | year = 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The last institution commemorating the old Greek ''poleis'' was the [[Panhellenion]], established by Hadrian.

==Derived words==
Derivatives of ''polis'' are common in many modern [[Europe]]an languages. This is indicative of the influence of the ''polis''-centred Hellenic world view. Derivative words in English include '''[[policy]]''', '''[[polity]]''', '''[[police]]''', and '''[[politics]].''' In [[Greek language|Greek]], words deriving from ''polis'' include ''politēs'' and ''politismos'', whose exact equivalents in [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Romance languages|Romance]], and other European languages, respectively ''civis'' ("citizen"), ''civilisatio'' ("civilization"), etc., are similarly derived.

A number of words end in ''-polis''. Most refer to a special kind of city or state. Examples include:
* [[Astropolis (disambiguation)|Astropolis]] – a star-scaled city/industry area; a complex space station; a European star-related festival
* [[Cosmopolis (disambiguation)|Cosmopolis]] – a large urban centre with a population of many different cultural backgrounds; a novel written by [[Don DeLillo]]

* [[Decapolis (disambiguation)|Dodecapolis]] – a group of twelve cities
* [[Pentapolis]] – a group of five cities
* [[Tripolis (disambiguation)|Tripolis]] – a group of three cities, retained in the names of [[Tripoli]] in [[Libya]], in [[Greece]], and a namesake in [[Lebanon]]

A [[landlocked country]], the Republic of Macedonia has borders with [[Kosovo]]{{Ref label|status|a|}} to the northwest, [[Serbia]] to the north, [[Bulgaria]] to the east, [[Greece]] to the south, and [[Albania]] to the west.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.mk/default1.aspx?ItemID=288 The Republic of Macedonia&amp;nbsp;– BASIC FACTS], Republic of Macedonia, Ministry of foreign affairs {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081116102337/http://www.mfa.gov.mk/default1.aspx?ItemID=288 |date= 16 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It constitutes approximately the northwestern third of the larger geographical region of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], which also comprises the neighbouring parts of northern Greece and smaller portions of southwestern Bulgaria and southeastern Albania. The country's geography is defined primarily by mountains, valleys, and rivers. The capital and largest city, [[Skopje]], is home to roughly a quarter of the nation's 2.06&amp;nbsp;million inhabitants. The majority of the residents are ethnic [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]], a [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] [[people]]. [[Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia|Albanians]] form a significant minority at around 25 percent, followed by [[Turks in the Republic of Macedonia|Turks]], [[Romani people in the Republic of Macedonia|Romani]], [[Serbs in the Republic of Macedonia|Serbs]], [[Bosniaks in the Republic of Macedonia|Bosniaks]], [[Aromanians in the Republic of Macedonia|Aromanians]] and others.

This region's history dates back to [[Ancient history|antiquity]], beginning with the [[Paeonia (kingdom)|kingdom of Paeonia]], probably a mixed [[Thracians|Thraco]]-[[Illyrians|Illyrian]] polity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Paeonia|title=Paeonia – historical region|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late sixth century BC, the area was incorporated into the [[Persian Achaemenid Empire]], then annexed by the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Kingdom of Macedonia]] in the fourth century BC. The Romans conquered the region in the second century BC and made it part of the much larger province of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]]. Τhe area remained part of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire]], and was often raided and settled by [[Early Slavs|Slavic]] [[tribe]]s beginning in the sixth century of the Christian era. Following [[Byzantine-Bulgarian Wars|centuries of contention]] between the Bulgarian, Byzantine and Serbian empires, it gradually came under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman dominion]] from the 14th until the early 20th century, when following the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912 and 1913, the modern territory of Macedonia came under Serbian rule. In the aftermath of the [[First World War]] (1914–1918), it became incorporated into the Serb-dominated [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], which after the [[Second World War]] was re-established as a republic (1945) and which became the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] in 1963. Macedonia remained a [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|constituent socialist republic]] within Yugoslavia until its peaceful secession in 1991.

The [[sovereign state]] of Macedonia is a  [[parliamentary republic]] and member of the UN and of the [[Council of Europe]]. Since 2005 it has also been a [[Accession of Macedonia to the European Union|candidate for joining the European Union]] and has [[Accession of Macedonia to NATO|applied for NATO membership]]. Although one of the poorest countries in Europe, Macedonia has made significant progress in developing an open, market-based economy.

[[Roman Empire|The Romans]] established the [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Province of Macedonia]] in 146 BC. By the time of [[Diocletian]], the province had been subdivided between ''Macedonia Prima'' ("first Macedonia") on the south, encompassing most of the kingdom of Macedon, and ''Macedonia Salutaris'' (known also as ''Macedonia Secunda'', "second Macedonia") on the north, encompassing partially Dardania and the whole of Paeonia; most of the country's modern boundaries fell within the latter, with the city of [[Stobi]] as its capital.&lt;ref&gt;A Companion to Ancient Macedonia, By Joseph Roisman and Ian Worthington, page 549&lt;/ref&gt; Roman expansion brought the Scupi area under Roman rule in the time of [[Domitian]] (81–96 AD), and it fell within the [[Moesia|Province of Moesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9068124/Skopje |title=Encyclopædia Britannica&amp;nbsp;– Scopje |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst [[Greek language|Greek]] remained the dominant language in the eastern part of the Roman empire, Latin spread to some extent in Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;A.

[[Early Slavs|Slavic]] [[tribe]]s settled in the [[Balkans|Balkan]] region including Macedonia by the late 6th century AD. During the 580s, [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] literature attests to the Slavs raiding Byzantine territories in the region of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], later aided by [[Bulgars]]. Historical records document that in c. 680 a group of Bulgars, Slavs and Byzantines led by a Bulgar called [[Kuber]] settled in the region of the Keramisian plain, centred on the city of [[Bitola]].&lt;ref&gt;"Acta Sancti Demetrii", V 195–207, Гръцки извори за българската история, 3, стр. 159–166&lt;/ref&gt; [[Presian I of Bulgaria|Presian's]] reign apparently coincides with the extension of Bulgarian control over the Slavic tribes in and around Macedonia. The Slavic tribes that settled in the region of Macedonia converted to Christianity around the 9th century during the reign of Tsar [[Boris I of Bulgaria]].

In 1014, the Byzantine Emperor [[Basil II]] defeated the armies of [[Samuel of Bulgaria|Tsar Samuil of Bulgaria]], and within four years the Byzantines restored control over the Balkans (including Macedonia) for the first time since the 7th century. However, by the late 12th century, Byzantine decline saw the region contested by various political entities, including a brief [[Normans|Norman]] occupation in the 1080s.
[[File:Marko-Monastery-church.jpg|thumb|[[Marko's Monastery]] in [[Markova Sušica]].]]
In the early 13th century, a revived [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] gained control of the region. Plagued by political difficulties, the empire did not last, and the region came once again under Byzantine control in the early 14th century. In the 14th century, it became part of the [[Serbian Empire]], who saw themselves as liberators of their Slavic kin from Byzantine [[despotism]]. [[Skopje]] became the capital of [[Stephen Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia|Tsar Stefan Dusan]]'s empire.

Following Dusan's death, a weak successor appeared, and power struggles between nobles divided the Balkans once again. These events coincided with the entry of the [[Ottoman Turks]] into Europe.

The Krushevo manifesto was declared, assuring the population that the uprising was against the Sultan and not against Muslims in general, and that all peoples would be included.

Following the two [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912 and 1913 and the [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]], most of its European-held territories were divided between [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]].&lt;ref name="Nicolle 2008 162"&gt;{{harvnb|Nicolle|2008|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; The territory of the modern Macedonian state was annexed by Serbia and named [[South Serbia (1919–22)|''South Serbia'']].

In 1929, the Kingdom was officially renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and divided into provinces called [[Subdivisions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia#Banovina|''banovinas'']].

IMRO followed by starting an insurgent war in Vardar Banovina, together with [[Macedonian Youth Secret Revolutionary Organization]], which also conducted guerilla attacks against the Serbian administrative and army officials there. In 1923 in Stip, a paramilitary organisation called [[Association against Bulgarian Bandits]] was formed by Serbian [[chetniks]], IMRO renegades and [[Macedonian Federative Organization]] (MFO) members to oppose IMRO and MMTRO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vassil Karloukovski |url=http://www.promacedonia.org/ag/ag_4_6.html |title=Гиза, Антони, "Балканските държави и Македония", Македонски Научен Институт  София, 2001 г |publisher=Promacedonia.org |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He began in earnest to organise armed resistance to the Bulgarian rule and sharply criticised Sharlo's pro-Bulgarian policy. At a meeting of the partisan brigades, as well as a group of battalions in the Resen region on 21 December 1943, Tempo makes the following comments about Shatorov and the leadership of the MCP: "They thought that the Macedonian people were Bulgarians and that they were oppressed by the hegemony of Great Serbia and had to be transferred to Bulgaria. Their basic slogan is: 'All non-Macedonians out of Macedonia'. The capital J [Serbo-Croatian spelling of Yugoslavia, Yugoslavian, etc.] was deleted from all documents. In fact they did not want Yugoslavia, no matter where it stood politically. When the war started, the initial decision of this leadership was to be separate from Yugoslavia and from Tito. They declared that Macedonia would be free as soon as the Bulgarians came...."&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Liberation War of Macedonia|National Liberation War]] ensued, with German forces being driven out of Yugoslav Macedonia by the end of 1944.&lt;ref name="НОБ на Македонија"&gt;"НОБ на Македонија" Јован Поповски.

Macedonia remained at peace through the [[Yugoslav Wars]] of the early 1990s. A few very minor changes to its border with Yugoslavia were agreed upon to resolve problems with the demarcation line between the two countries. However, it was seriously destabilised by the [[Kosovo War]] in 1999, when an estimated 360,000 [[Albanians|ethnic Albanian]] refugees from Kosovo took refuge in the country.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Nigel|ref=Thomas|year=2006|publisher=Osprey Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a7cOQ9Nch2AC |title=The Yugoslav Wars (2): Bosnia, Kosovo And Macedonia 1992–2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they departed shortly after the war, [[Albanian nationalism|Albanian nationalists]] on both sides of the border took up arms soon after in pursuit of autonomy or independence for the Albanian-populated areas of Macedonia.&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of the Republic of Macedonia}}

[[File:Mount Korab, Republic of Macedonia.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Korab]], the highest mountain in Macedonia]]

Macedonia has a total area of {{convert|25713|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}. It lies between latitudes [[40th parallel north|40°]] and [[43rd parallel north|43° N]], and mostly between longitudes [[20th meridian east|20°]] and [[23rd meridian east|23° E]] (a small area lies east of 23°). Macedonia has some {{convert|748|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of boundaries, shared with [[Serbia]] ({{convert|62|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) to the North, [[Kosovo]] ({{convert|159|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) to the northwest, [[Bulgaria]] ({{convert|148|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) to the east, [[Greece]] ({{convert|228|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) to the south, and [[Albania]] ({{convert|151|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) to the west. It is a transit way for shipment of goods from Greece, through the Balkans, towards Eastern, Western and Central Europe and through Bulgaria to the east. It is part of a larger region also known as [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], which also includes [[Macedonia (Greece)]] and the [[Blagoevgrad Province]] in southwestern [[geography of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]].
  
Macedonia is a [[landlocked country]] that is geographically clearly defined by a central valley formed by the Vardar river and framed along its borders by mountain ranges. The terrain is mostly rugged, located between the [[Šar Mountains]] and [[Osogovo]], which frame the valley of the [[Vardar]] river. Three large lakes&amp;nbsp;– [[Lake Ohrid]], [[Lake Prespa]] and [[Dojran Lake]]&amp;nbsp;– lie on the southern borders, bisected by the frontiers with Albania and Greece. Ohrid is considered to be one of the oldest lakes and biotopes in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moe.gov.mk/soer2/ohrid_a.htm |title=Macedonian Ministry of Environment |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=28 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119010740/http://www.moe.gov.mk/soer2/ohrid_a.htm |archivedate=19 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The region is seismically active and has been the site of destructive earthquakes in the past, most recently in 1963 when Skopje was heavily damaged by a major earthquake, killing over 1,000.

Macedonia also has scenic mountains. They belong to two different [[mountain range]]s: the first is the Šar Mountains&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/523838/Sar-Mountains |title=Britannica's article about Sar Mountains |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euratlas.com/Atlasphys/Sarplanina2.htm |title=Sar Mountains on the Euratlas map of the Europe's most significant mountain ranges |publisher=Euratlas.com |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; that continues to the West Vardar/Pelagonia group of mountains ([[Baba Mountain, Macedonia|Baba Mountain]], [[Nidže]], [[Kožuf|Kozuf]] and [[Jakupica]]), also known as the [[Dinaric Alps|Dinaric range]]. The second range is the [[Osogovo]]–[[Belasica]] mountain chain, also known as the [[Rhodope Mountains|Rhodope range]]. The mountains belonging to the Šar Mountains and the West Vardar/Pelagonia range are younger and higher than the older mountains of the Osogovo-Belasica mountain group. [[Mount Korab]] of the Šar Mountains on the Albanian border, at 2,764 m (9,068&amp;nbsp;ft), is the tallest mountain in Macedonia.
 
[[File:Matka_Lake_-_Macedonia.jpg|thumb|right|[[Matka Canyon]]]]

In the Republic of Macedonia there are 1,100 large sources of water. The rivers flow into three different basins: the Aegean, the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] and the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mymacedonia.net/links/geography.htm | title=Macedonia | publisher=Mymacedonia.net | accessdate=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aegean basin is the largest. It covers 87% of the territory of the Republic, which is {{convert|22075|km2|0|abbr=out}}. [[Vardar]], the largest river in this basin, drains 80% of the territory or {{convert|20459|km2|0|abbr=out}}. Its valley plays an important part in the economy and the communication system of the country. The Vardar Valley project is considered to be crucial for the strategic development of the country.

The river [[Black Drin]] forms the Adriatic basin, which covers an area of about {{convert|3320|km2|0|abbr=on}}, i.e., 13% of the territory. It receives water from Lakes Prespa and Ohrid.

The Black Sea basin is the smallest with only {{convert|37|km2|0|abbr=on}}. It covers the northern side of Mount [[Skopska Crna Gora]]. This is the source of the river Binachka Morava, which joins the [[Great Morava|Morava]], and later, the [[Danube]], which flows into the Black Sea.

Macedonia has around fifty ponds and three natural lakes, [[Lake Ohrid]], [[Lake Prespa]] and [[Lake Dojran]].

In Macedonia there are nine spa towns and resorts: Banište, Banja Bansko, Istibanja, Katlanovo, [[Kežovica]], Kosovrasti, Banja Kočani, Kumanovski Banji and Negorci.

===Climate===

[[File:Macedonia map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|Macedonia map of Köppen climate classification.]]
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}

Macedonia has a transitional climate from Mediterranean to continental. The summers are hot and dry, and the winters are moderately cold. Average annual precipitation varies from {{convert|1700|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in the western mountainous area to {{convert|500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in the eastern area. There are three main climatic zones in the country: temperate Mediterranean, mountainous, and mildly continental. Along the valleys of the [[Vardar]] and [[Strumica]] rivers, in the regions of [[Gevgelija]], [[Valandovo]], [[Dojran]], Strumica, and [[Radoviš]], the climate is temperate Mediterranean. The warmest regions are [[Demir Kapija]] and Gevgelija, where the temperature in July and August frequently exceeds {{convert|40|°C|°F}}. The mountainous climate is present in the mountainous regions of the country, and it is characterised by long and snowy winters and short and cold summers. The spring is colder than the fall. The majority of Macedonia has a moderate [[continental climate]] with warm and dry summers and relatively cold and wet winters. There are thirty main and regular weather stations in the country.

===Biodiversity===
{{Main|Flora of Macedonia|Fauna of Macedonia}}

[[File:MacedonianSunflower.JPG|thumb|Sunflower|right]]
[[File:Pelister Molika.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Pinus peuce]]'', the Macedonian Pine or Molika, one of Macedonia's most recognisable trees]]

The [[flora]] of Republic of Macedonia is represented by around 210 [[family (biology)|families]], 920 [[genus (biology)|genera]], and around 3,700 plant [[species]]. The most abundant group are the [[flowering plant]]s with around 3,200 species, followed by [[moss]]es (350 species) and [[fern]]s (42).

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Macedonia belongs to the Illyrian province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) and the Digital Map of European Ecological Regions by the [[European Environment Agency]], the territory of the Republic can be subdivided into four [[ecoregion]]s: the [[Pindus Mountains]] [[mixed forests]], [[Balkan]] mixed forests, [[Rhodopes]] mixed forests and [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] [[sclerophyllous]] and mixed forests.

[[Baba Mountain, Macedonia|National Park of Pelister]] in Bitola is known for the presence of the endemic [[Macedonian Pine]], as well as some 88 species of plants representing almost 30 percent of Macedonian dendroflora. The Macedonian Pine forests on Pelister are divided into two communities: pine forests with ferns and pine forests with junipers. The Macedonian Pine, as a specific conifer species, is a [[relict]] of tertiary flora, and the five-needle pine [[Macedonian Pine|Molika]], was first noted on Pelister in 1893.

Macedonia's limited forest growth also includes [[Macedonian Oak]]s, the sycamore, weeping willows, white willows, alders, poplars, elms, and the common ash. Near the rich pastures on Šar Mountain and Bistra, Mavrovo, is another plant species characteristic of plant life in Macedonia—the poppy. The quality of thick [[Poppy (flower)|poppy]] juice is measured worldwide by morphine units; while Chinese [[opium]] contains eight such units and is considered to be of high quality, Indian opium contains seven units, and Turkish opium only six, Macedonian opium contains a full 14 morphine units and is one of the best quality opiums in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macedonia.co.uk/client/index1.aspx?page=246 |title=Macedonian Flora |publisher=Macedonia.co.uk |accessdate=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fauna of Macedonian forests is abundant and includes bears, wild boars, wolves, foxes, squirrels, [[chamois]] and deer. The [[Eurasian lynx|lynx]] is found, although very rarely, in the mountains of western Macedonia, while deer can be found in the region of [[Demir Kapija]]. Forest birds include the [[blackcap]], the [[grouse]], the [[black grouse]], the [[Eastern imperial eagle|imperial eagle]] and the forest owl.

The three artificial lakes of the country represent a separate fauna zone, an indication of long-lasting territorial and temporal isolation. The fauna of Lake Ohrid is a relict of an earlier era and the lake is widely known for its letnica trout, lake [[Lake whitefish|whitefish]], [[Gudgeon (fish)|gudgeon]], [[Rutilus|roach]], podust, and pior, as well as for certain species of snails of a genus older than 30&amp;nbsp;million years; similar species can be found only in [[Lake Baikal]]. Lake Ohrid is also noted in zoology texts for the [[European eel]] and its baffling reproductive cycle: it comes to Lake Ohrid from the distant [[Sargasso Sea]],&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, J. (1912) Danish researches in the Atlantic and Mediterranean on the life-history of the Fresh-water Eel (''Anguilla vulgaris'', Turt.). Internationale Revue der gesamten Hydrobiologie und Hydrographie 5: 317–342.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macedonia.co.uk/client/index1.aspx?page=247|title=Macedonian Fauna|author=|date=|work=macedonia.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; thousands of kilometres away, and lurks in the depths of the lake for 10&amp;nbsp;years.

Macedonia is a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] with an [[executive (government)|executive government]] composed of a coalition of parties from the [[unicameralism|unicameral legislature]] ({{lang|mk|Собрание}}, {{lang|mk-Latn|Sobranie}}) and an independent [[judiciary|judicial branch]] with a [[constitutional court]]. The Assembly is made up of 120 seats and the members are elected every four years. The role of the President of the Republic is mostly ceremonial, with the real power resting in the hands of the Prime Minister. The President is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the state armed forces and a president of the [[National security|state Security]] Council. The President is elected every five years and he or she can be elected twice at most. On the second run of the [[Macedonian presidential election, 2009|presidential elections held on 5 April 2009]], [[Gjorge Ivanov]] was elected as new Macedonian president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/ivanov-elected-new-macedonian-president |title=Ivanov Elected New Macedonian President |publisher=BalkanInsight |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the passage of a new law and elections held in 2005, local government functions are divided between 78 municipalities ({{lang|mk|општини}}, {{lang|mk-Latn|opštini}}; [[Grammatical number|singular]]: {{lang|mk|општина}}, {{lang|mk-Latn|opština}}). The capital, [[Skopje]], is governed as a group of ten municipalities collectively referred to as the "City of Skopje". Municipalities in Macedonia are units of local self-government. Neighbouring municipalities may establish co-operative arrangements.

The country's main political divergence is between the largely ethnically based political parties representing the country's ethnic Macedonian majority and Albanian minority. The issue of the power balance between the two communities led to a brief war in 2001, following which a power-sharing agreement was reached. In August 2004, Macedonia's parliament passed legislation redrawing local boundaries and giving greater local autonomy to ethnic Albanians in areas where they predominate.

After a troublesome pre-election campaign, Macedonia saw a relatively calm and democratic change of government in the [[Macedonian parliamentary election, 2006|elections held on 5 July 2006]]. The elections were marked by a decisive victory of the centre-right party [[VMRO–DPMNE|VMRO-DPMNE]] led by [[Nikola Gruevski]]. Gruevski's decision to include the [[Democratic Party of Albanians]] in the new government, instead of the [[Democratic Union for Integration]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Party for Democratic Prosperity]] coalition which won the majority of the Albanian votes, triggered protests throughout the parts of the country with a respective number of Albanian population. However, a dialogue was later established between the Democratic Union for Integration and the ruling VMRO-DMPNE party as an effort to talk about the disputes between the two parties and to support European and NATO aspirations of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://limun.hr/en/main.aspx?id=127474 |title=Ahmeti accepts the invitation for dialog with Gruevski |publisher=Limun.hr |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the early parliamentary elections held in 2008, VMRO-DPMNE and Democratic Union for Integration formed a ruling coalition in Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2008/07/08/feature-02 |title=VMRO-DPMNE and DUI form ruling coalition in Macedonia |publisher=SeTimes |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, presidential and local elections in the country were carried out peacefully, which was crucial for Macedonian aspirations to join the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0322/breaking39.htm |title=Macedonia elections pass off peacefully |publisher=Irish Times |date=3 March 2009 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling conservative VMRO-DPMNE party won a victory in the local elections and the candidate supported by the party, Gjorgi Ivanov, was elected as the new president.

{{Asof|2017|5|31}}, the Prime Minister of Macedonia is [[Zoran Zaev]], who also heads the [[Social Democratic Union of Macedonia|SDUM]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/06/zoran-zaev-wins-confidence-vote-form-goverment-170601065207690.html |title=Macedonia: Zaev wins confidence vote to form goverment  &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93;|website=www.aljazeera.com |access-date=2017-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the current President of the Parliament is [[Talat Xhaferi]].&lt;ref name="xhaferi"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.balkaneu.com/tension-in-skopje-talat-xhaferi-is-elected-assembly-speaker-in-a-situation-of-chaos/ |title=Tension in Skopje, Talat Xhaferi is elected Assembly Speaker in a situation of chaos |website=www.balkaneu.com |language=en-US |access-date=2017-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The election of Xhaferi was immediately met with protests led by VMRO-DPMNE, which was quickly handled by Macedonian police.&lt;ref name="xhaferi"/&gt;

=== Governance ===
{{Main|Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia}}

[[File:Macedonian parliament interior.jpg|thumb|right|The interior of the Macedonian parliament in Skopje.]]

Parliament, or ''Sobranie'' ({{lang-mk|Собрание}}), is the country's [[legislature|legislative body]]. It makes, proposes and adopts laws.  The [[Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia]] has been in use since the formation of the republic in the 1993. It limits the power of the governments, both local and national. The military is also limited by the constitution. The constitution states that Macedonia is a social free state, and that [[Skopje]] is the capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eudo-citizenship.eu/NationalDB/docs/MAC%20Constitution%20(amended%20by%20XXX)%20eng.pdf|title=Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=17 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110075847/http://eudo-citizenship.eu/NationalDB/docs/MAC%20Constitution%20(amended%20by%20XXX)%20eng.pdf|archivedate=10 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 120 members are elected for a mandate of four years through a general election. Each citizen aged 18&amp;nbsp;years or older can vote for one of the political parties. The current president of Parliament is [[Talat Xhaferi]].

Executive power in Macedonia is exercised by the Government, whose prime minister is the most politically powerful person in the country. The members of the government are chosen by the Prime Minister and there are ministers for each branch of the society. There are ministers for economy, finance, information technology, society, internal affairs, foreign affairs and other areas. The members of the Government are elected for a mandate of four years. The current Prime Minister is [[Zoran Zaev]].
 
Judiciary power is exercised by courts, with the court system being headed by the Judicial [[Supreme court]], Constitutional Court and the Republican Judicial Council. The assembly appoints the judges.

Macedonia became a member state of the UN on 8 April 1993, eighteen months after its independence from Yugoslavia. It is referred to within the UN as "the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia", pending a resolution of the [[Macedonia naming dispute|long-running dispute]] with [[Greece]] about the country's name.

The major interest of the country is a full integration in the European and the [[wikt:transatlantic|Trans-Atlantic]] integration processes. Five foreign policy priorities are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.mk/default1.aspx?ItemID=308 |title=Republic of Macedonia, Ministry of foreign affairs |publisher=Mfa.gov.mk |accessdate=5 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081116050319/http://www.mfa.gov.mk//default1.aspx?ItemID=308 |archivedate=16 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Commencing negotiations for full-fledged membership in the European Union
* Lifting the visa regime for Macedonian nationals &lt;!--could be clarified for readers--&gt;
* NATO membership
* Resolving the naming issue with Greece
* Strengthening the economic and public diplomacy

Macedonia is a member of the following international and regional organisations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.mk/default1.aspx?ItemID=314 |title=Republic of Macedonia, Ministry of foreign affairs |publisher=Mfa.gov.mk |accessdate=5 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081116103843/http://www.mfa.gov.mk//default1.aspx?ItemID=314 |archivedate=16 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] (since 1992), [[World Health Organization|WHO]] (since 1993), [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development|EBRD]] (since 1993), [[Central European Initiative]] (since 1993), [[Council of Europe]] (since 1995), [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] (since 1995), [[Southeast European Cooperative Initiative|SECI]] (since 1996), [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] (since 2003), [[Central European Free Trade Agreement|CEFTA]] (since 2006), [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|La Francophonie]] (since 2001).

In 2005, the country was officially recognised as a [[European Union]] candidate state.

At the NATO [[2008 Bucharest summit]], Macedonia failed to gain an invitation to join the organisation because Greece vetoed the move after the dispute over the name issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=91875 |title=Bulgaria: Macedonia Remains Out of NATO Because of Greek Veto over Name Dispute&amp;nbsp;– Novinite.com&amp;nbsp;– Sofia News Agency |publisher=Novinite.com |date=3 April 2008 |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The USA had previously expressed support for an invitation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/4/2/worldupdates/2008-04-02T203446Z_01_NOOTR_RTRMDNC_0_-328122-1&amp;sec=Worldupdates |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410030104/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F4%2F2%2Fworldupdates%2F2008-04-02T203446Z_01_NOOTR_RTRMDNC_0_-328122-1&amp;sec=Worldupdates |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 April 2008 |title=Greece stands by NATO veto threat for Macedonia |publisher=Thestar.com.my |accessdate=5 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the summit then decided to extend an invitation only on condition of a resolution of the naming conflict with Greece.

In March 2009, the [[European Parliament]] expressed support for Macedonia's EU candidacy and asked the EU Commission to grant the country a date for the start of accession talks by the end of 2009. The parliament also recommended a speedy lifting of the visa regime for Macedonian citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/ep-urges-accession-talks-for-macedonia |title=EP Urges Accession Talks For Macedonia |publisher=BalkanInsight.com |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Macedonia has so far failed to receive a start date for accession talks as a result of the naming dispute. The EU's stance is similar to NATO's in that resolution of the naming dispute is a precondition for the start of accession talks.

In October 2012, the EU Enlargement Commissioner [[Štefan Füle]] proposed a start of accession negotiations with Macedonia for the fourth time, while the previous efforts were blocked each time by Greece. At the same time Füle visited Bulgaria in a bid to clarify the state's position with respect to Macedonia. He established that Bulgaria almost has joined Greece in vetoing the accession talks with Macedonia. The Bulgarian position was that Sofia cannot grant an EU certificate to Skopje, which is systematically employing an ideology of hate towards Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/enlargement/bulgaria-vetoes-macedonia-eu-acc-news-515809|title=Bulgaria vetoes Macedonia's EU accession talks|author=|date=|work=euractiv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights===
{{Main|Human rights in the Republic of Macedonia}}

The Republic of Macedonia is a signatory to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and the U.N. Geneva [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] and [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|Convention against Torture]], and the Constitution guarantees basic human rights to all Macedonian citizens.

There do, however, continue to be problems with human rights. According to human rights organisations, in 2003 there were suspected extrajudicial executions, threats against, and intimidation of, human rights activists and opposition journalists, and allegations of [[torture]] by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/region/macedonia?page=2 |title=Amnesty International&amp;nbsp;– Summary&amp;nbsp;– Macedonia |publisher=Web.amnesty.org |accessdate=6 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518152631/http://www.amnesty.org/en/region/macedonia?page=2 |archivedate=18 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hrw2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/campaigns/macedonia/|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130414225403/http://www.hrw.org/legacy/campaigns/macedonia/|deadurl=yes|title=Human Rights Watch – Defending Human Rights Worldwide|date=14 April 2013|archivedate=14 April 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military ===
{{Main|Military of the Republic of Macedonia}}

[[File:Macedonian_Soldiers_in_Kabul.jpg|thumb|right|[[Army of the Republic of Macedonia]]]]

The [[Army of the Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian Armed Forces]] comprise the army, [[Macedonian Air Force|air force]] and [[Wolves (military)|Special Forces]]. The government's national defence policy aims to guarantee the preservation of the independence and sovereignty of the state, the integrity of its land area and airspace and its constitutional order. Its main goals remain the development and maintenance of a credible capability to defend the nation's vital interests and development of the Armed Forces in a way that ensures their interoperability with the armed forces of NATO and the European Union member states and their capability to participate in the full range of NATO missions.

The Ministry of Defence develops the Republic's defence strategy and assesses possible threats and risks. It is also responsible for the defence system, including training, readiness, equipment, and development, and for drawing up and presenting the defence budget.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morm.gov.mk/morm/en/ARM/Defence-Structure.html National Command Management] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100904165013/http://www.morm.gov.mk/morm/en/ARM/Defence-Structure.html |date=4 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] in 1991, the name of Macedonia became the object of a dispute between [[Greece]] and the newly independent Republic of Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;Floudas, Demetrius Andreas; {{cite news |publisher=24 (1996) Journal of Political and Military Sociology, 285|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3719/is_199601/ai_n8752910/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060127053906/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3719/is_199601/ai_n8752910 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 January 2006 |title=A Name for a Conflict or a Conflict for a Name?

Citing [[Macedonia naming dispute#Greek position|historical and territorial concerns]] resulting from the ambiguity between the Republic of Macedonia, the adjacent Greek region of Macedonia and the ancient [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Kingdom of Macedon]] which falls within Greek Macedonia, Greece opposes the use of the name ''Macedonia'' by the Republic of Macedonia without a geographical qualifier, supporting a compound name (such as ''North Macedonia'') for use by all and for all purposes (''[[erga omnes]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gr/en/fyrom-name-issue/ FYROM Name Issue], Hellenic Republic&amp;nbsp;– Ministry of Foreign Affairs&lt;/ref&gt; As millions of ethnic Greeks identify themselves as [[Macedonians (Greeks)|Macedonians]], unrelated to the [[Slavs|Slavic]] [[people]] who are associated with the Republic of Macedonia, Greece further objects to the use of the term ''Macedonian'' for the neighboring country's largest [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|ethnic group]]. The Republic of Macedonia is accused of appropriating symbols and figures that are historically considered parts of [[Culture of Greece|Greece's culture]] (such as [[Vergina Sun]], a symbol associated with the ancient Kingdom of Macedon, and [[Alexander the Great]]), and of promoting the [[irredentist]] concept of a [[United Macedonia]], which would include territories of [[Greece]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Albania]], and [[Serbia]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

From 1992 to 1995, the two countries engaged in a dispute over the Macedonian state's new flag, which incorporated the [[Vergina Sun]] symbol. This aspect of the dispute was resolved when the flag was changed under the terms of an interim accord agreed between the two states in October 1995.

Initially the [[European Community]]-nominated Arbitration Commission's opinion was that "the use of the name 'Macedonia' cannot therefore imply any territorial claim against another State";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol4/No1/art8-02.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050215223455/http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol4/No1/art8-02.html |archivedate=15 February 2005 |title=European Journal of International Law |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=28 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the commission's opinion, Greece continued to object to the establishment of relations between the Community and the Republic under its constitutional name.&lt;ref&gt;Floudas, Demetrius Andreas; {{cite web |publisher=in: Kourvetaris et al.

Since the coming to power in 2006, and especially since Macedonia's non-invitation to NATO in 2008, the VMRO-DPMNE government has pursued a policy of "[[Macedonian nationalism#Post-independence period and Antiquisation|Antiquisation]]" ("Antikvizatzija") as a way of putting pressure on Greece as well as for the purposes of domestic identity-building.&lt;ref name="Georgievski"&gt;''Ghosts of the past endanger Macedonia's future''. Boris Georgievski, BalkanInsight, 27 October 2009 [http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/ghosts-of-the-past-endanger-macedonia-s-future].&lt;/ref&gt; Statues of [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip of Macedon]] have been built in several cities across the country. Additionally, many pieces of public infrastructure, such as airports, highways, and stadiums have been renamed after Alexander and Philip. These actions are seen as deliberate provocations in neighboring Greece, exacerbating the dispute and further stalling Macedonia's EU and NATO applications.&lt;ref&gt;''Greece slates Skopje's provocative Alexander statue'' Sinisa Jakov Marusic, Balkan Insight, 15 June 2011 [http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/greece-slates-skopje-s-provocative-alexander-statue]&lt;/ref&gt; The policy has also attracted criticism domestically, as well as from EU diplomats.&lt;ref name="Georgievski"/&gt;

In November 2008, Macedonia instituted proceedings before the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) against [[Greece]] alleging violations of the 1995 Interim Accord that blocked its accession to NATO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Davorin&amp;nbsp;– Ljubljana |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20081117-macedonia-sues-greece-blocking-nato-entry-membership-name |title=Macedonia sues Greece for blocking NATO entry |publisher=France 24 |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICJ was requested to order Greece to observe its obligations within the Accord, which is legally binding for both countries.  In 2011, The United Nations' International Court of Justice ruled that Greece violated Article 11 of the 1995 Interim Accord by vetoing Macedonia's bid for [[NATO]] membership at the 2008 summit in [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia institutes proceedings against Greece for a violation of Article 11 of the Interim Accord of 13 September 1995|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/142/14881.pdf|publisher=International Court of Justice|accessdate=7 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216072534/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/142/14881.pdf|archivedate=16 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court, however, did not consider it necessary to grant Macedonia's request that it instruct Greece to refrain from similar actions in the future since "[a]s a general rule, there is no reason to suppose that a State whose act or conduct has been declared wrongful by the Court will repeat that act or conduct in the future, since its good faith must be presumed";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Application of the Interim Accord of 13 September 1995|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/142/16827.pdf|publisher=International Court of Justice|accessdate=13 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901184115/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/142/16827.pdf|archivedate=1 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; nor has there been to date a change in the EU's stance that Macedonia's accession negotiations cannot begin until the name issue is resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21541400|title=Call it what you want|author=|date=10 December 2011|publisher=|via=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 June 2018, Greece and Macedonia signed an agreement to end their dispute, which would result in Macedonia being renamed the ''Republic of North Macedonia'' (Република Северна Македонија).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The agreement still requires [[ratification]] by both parliaments to come into effect. As of June 2018, both governments are expected to have to overcome stiff political opposition in their respective countries in order to conclude this process. Macedonia held [[Macedonian referendum, 2018|an advisory referendum]] about the required changes to its constitution in September 2018.

== Administrative divisions ==

[[File:Map of urban and rural municipalities of Macedonia en.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Rural/Urban municipalities]]
[[File:MSR.png|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Macedonian statistical regions]]
Macedonia's statistical regions exist solely for legal and statistical purposes. The regions are:
* [[Eastern statistical region|Eastern]]
* [[Northeastern statistical region|Northeastern]]
* [[Pelagonia statistical region|Pelagonia]]
* [[Polog statistical region|Polog]]
* [[Skopje statistical region|Skopje]]
* [[Southeastern statistical region|Southeastern]]
* [[Southwestern statistical region|Southwestern]]
* [[Vardar statistical region|Vardar]]

In August 2004, the Republic of Macedonia was reorganised into 84 municipalities ({{lang|mk|opštini}}; sing. {{lang|mk|opština}}); 10 of the municipalities constitute the [[Greater Skopje|City of Skopje]], a distinct unit of local self-government and the country's capital.

Most of the current municipalities were unaltered or merely amalgamated from the previous 123 municipalities established in September 1996; others were consolidated and their borders changed. Prior to this, local government was organised into 34 administrative districts, communes, or counties (also opštini).

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of the Republic of Macedonia}}
Ranked as the fourth "best reformatory state" out of 178 countries ranked by the [[World Bank]] in 2009, Macedonia has undergone considerable economic reform since independence.&lt;ref name="worldbank"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lnweb90.worldbank.org/eca/eca.nsf/f27e125b8411fe0e852567d10013f34a/fffd3db0d7306bfd85256c250061ac88/$FILE/Macedonia%20Country%20Brief.pdf |title=Macedonia Country Brief |publisher=The World Bank |date=24 April 2009 |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country has developed an [[open economy]] with trade accounting for more than 90% of GDP in recent years. Since 1996, Macedonia has witnessed steady, though slow, economic growth with GDP growing by 3.1% in 2005. This figure was projected to rise to an average of 5.2% in the 2006–2010 period.&lt;ref name="worldbank-devdata"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://devdata.worldbank.org/AAG/mkd_aag.pdf |title=World Bank development data |format=PDF |accessdate=28 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308000321/http://devdata.worldbank.org/AAG/mkd_aag.pdf |archivedate=8 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has proven successful in its efforts to combat inflation, with an [[inflation rate]] of only 3% in 2006 and 2% in 2007,&lt;ref name="worldbank"/&gt; and has implemented policies focused on attracting [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]] and promoting the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The current government introduced a [[flat tax]] system with the intention of making the country more attractive to foreign investment. The flat tax rate was 12% in 2007 and was further lowered to 10% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vlada.mk/english/News/December2006/ei8-12-2006.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080127122623/http://www.vlada.mk/english/News/December2006/ei8-12-2006.htm |archivedate=27 January 2008 |title=Government of the Republic of Macedonia |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=28 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nuwireinvestor.com/articles/macedonias-new-flat-tax-51002.aspx |title=Macedonia's Flat Tax |publisher=Nuwireinvestor.com |date=15 February 2007 |accessdate=28 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522141422/http://www.nuwireinvestor.com/articles/macedonias-new-flat-tax-51002.aspx |archivedate=22 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite these reforms, {{As of|2005|lc=y}} Macedonia's [[unemployment|unemployment rate]] was 37.2%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org.mk/ |title=Macedonian unemployment rate |publisher=Worldbank.org.mk |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{As of|2006|lc=y}} its [[poverty threshold|poverty rate]] was 22%.&lt;ref name="worldbank-devdata"/&gt; However, due to a number of employment measures as well as the successful process of attracting multinational corporations, and according to the Macedonian State Statistical Office, country's unemployment rate in the first quarter of 2015 decreased to 27.3%.&lt;ref&gt;State Statistical Office [http://www.stat.gov.mk/PrikaziSoopstenie_en.aspx?rbrtxt=98 Active population – Unemployment data]&lt;/ref&gt; Government's policies and efforts in regards to foreign direct investments have resulted with the establishment of local subsidiaries of several world leading manufacturing companies, especially from the automotive industry, such as: [[Johnson Controls|Johnson Controls Inc.]], [[Van Hool|Van Hool NV]], [[Johnson Matthey|Johnson Matthey plc]], [[Lear Corporation|Lear Corp.]], [[Visteon|Visteon Corp.]], [[Kostal-Gruppe|Kostal GmbH]], [[Gentherm Incorporated|Gentherm Inc.]], [[Dräxlmaier Group]], [[Kromberg &amp; Schubert]], [[Marquardt Group|Marquardt GmbH]], [[Amphenol|Amphenol Corp.]], [[Tekno Hose SpA]], [[KEMET Corporation|KEMET Corp.]], [[Key Safety Systems Inc.]], [[ODW-Elektrik GmbH]], etc.

Macedonia has one of the highest shares of people struggling financially, with 72% of its citizens stating that they could manage on their household's income only "with difficulty" or "with great difficulty", though Macedonia, along with Croatia, was the only country in the Western Balkans to not report an increase in this statistic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balkan-monitor.eu/files/BalkanMonitor-2010_Summary_of_Findings.pdf Gallup Balkan Monitor], 2010 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121227084847/http://www.balkan-monitor.eu/files/BalkanMonitor-2010_Summary_of_Findings.pdf |date=27 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption and a relatively ineffective legal system also act as significant restraints on successful [[economic development]]. Macedonia still has one of the lowest [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|per capita GDPs]] in Europe. Furthermore, the country's [[grey market]] is estimated at close to 20% of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;The 2006 [[The World Factbook|CIA Factbook]] [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mk.html CIA Factbook Macedonia]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Грозје - Вранец.jpg|thumb|left|Vineyard in Macedonia]]
[[File:Macedonia treemap.png|thumb|Graphical depiction of Macedonia's product exports.]]
In terms of GDP structure, {{As of|2013|lc=y}} the manufacturing sector, including mining and construction constituted the largest part of GDP at 21.4%, up from 21.1% in 2012. The trade, transportation and accommodation sector represents 18.2% of GDP in 2013, up from 16.7% in 2012, while agriculture represents 9.6%, up from 9.1% in the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;State Statistical Office [http://www.stat.gov.mk/PrikaziSoopstenie_en.aspx?id=32&amp;rbr=1495 Gross domestic product 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of foreign trade, the largest sector contributing to the country's export in 2014 was "chemicals and related products" at 21.4%, followed by the "machinery and transport equipment" sector at 21.1%. Macedonia's main import sectors in 2014 were "manufactured goods classified chiefly by material" with 34.2%, "machinery and transport equipment" with 18.7% and "mineral fuels, lubricants and related materials" with 14.4% of the total imports. Even 68.8% of the foreign trade in 2014 was done with the EU which makes the Union by far the largest trading partner of Macedonia (23.3% with Germany, 7.9% with the UK, 7.3% with Greece, 6.2% with Italy, etc.). Almost 12% of the total external trade in 2014 was done with the Western Balkan countries.&lt;ref&gt;State Statistical Office [http://www.stat.gov.mk/PrikaziSoopstenie_en.aspx?id=78&amp;rbr=1590 External trade volume 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

With a GDP per capita of US$9,157 at [[purchasing power parity]] and a [[List of countries by Human Development Index|Human Development Index]] of 0.701, Macedonia is less developed and has a considerably smaller economy than most of the former Yugoslav states.

According to [[Eurostat]] data, Macedonian PPS GDP per capita stood at 36% of the EU average in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tec00114&amp;plugin=1 |title=GDP per capita in PPS |publisher=Eurostat |accessdate=1 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524215819/http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tec00114&amp;plugin=1 |archivedate=24 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infrastructure and e-infrastructure===

Macedonia (along with [[Montenegro]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Kosovo]]) belongs to the less-developed southern region of the former Yugoslavia. It suffered severe economic difficulties after independence, when the Yugoslav [[internal market]] collapsed and subsidies from Belgrade ended. In addition, it faced many of the same problems faced by other former socialist [[Eastern Europe|East European]] countries during the transition to a [[market economy]]. Its main land and rail exports route, through [[Serbia]], remains unreliable with high transit costs, thereby affecting the export of its formerly highly profitable, early vegetables market to Germany. Macedonia's IT market increased 63.8% year on year in 2007, which is the fastest growing in the Adriatic region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idc-cema.com/?showproduct=34598 "Investment in Government, Finance, and Telecom Sectors Makes Macedonia's IT Market the Fastest Growing in the Adriatic Region, Says IDC"], ''IDC'' (global provider of market intelligence)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade and investment===

The outbreak of the Yugoslav wars and the imposition of sanctions on [[Serbia and Montenegro]] caused great damage to the Republic's economy, with Serbia constituting 60% of its markets before the disintegration of Yugoslavia. When Greece imposed a [[embargo|trade embargo]] on the Republic in 1994–95, the economy was also affected. Some relief was afforded by the end of the [[Bosnian War]] in November 1995 and the lifting of the Greek embargo, but the Kosovo War of 1999 and the 2001 Albanian crisis caused further destabilisation.

Since the end of the Greek embargo, Greece has become the country's most important business partner. (See [[Greek investments in the Republic of Macedonia]].) Many Greek companies have bought former state companies in Macedonia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greekembassy.org/embassy/Content/en/Article.aspx?office=1&amp;folder=19&amp;article=24108 |title=Greek investments in FYROM at 1 bil.

However, local cross-border trade between Greece and the Republic of Macedonia sees thousands of Greek shoppers visiting to purchase cheaper domestic products.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} The moving of business to Macedonia in the oil sector has been caused by the rise of [[Greece]] in the oil markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.neweurope.eu/article/depa-sees-natural-gas-role-greece-exiting-crisis/|title=DEPA sees natural gas role for Greece exiting from the crisis|date=3 April 2017|work=New Europe|access-date=2017-04-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other key partners are Germany, Italy, the United States, Slovenia, Austria and Turkey.

The Republic of Macedonia is in its position a continental country in the middle of the [[Balkans|Balkan peninsula]], and the main transport links in the country are those that connect the different parts of the peninsula (transbalkan links). Particularly important is the connection between north-south and Vardar valley, which connects Greece with the rest of Europe.

The total length of the railway network in the Republic of Macedonia is 699&amp;nbsp;km. The most important railway line is the line on the border with Serbia – Kumanovo – Skopje – Veles – Gevgelija – border with Greece. Since 2001, the railway line Beljakovci has been built – the border with Bulgaria, which will get a direct connection Skopje-Sofia. The most important railway hub in the country is [[Skopje]], while the other two are Veles and Kumanovo.

[[Makedonska Pošta|Macedonian Post]] is a Macedonian state-owned company for the provision of postal traffic. It was founded in 1992 as PTT Macedonia. In 1993 she was admitted to the World Postal Union in 1997, PTT Macedonia was divided into Macedonian Telekom and Macedonian Post. As far as Water Transport is concerned, only lake traffic through Ohrid and Prespan Lake has been developed, mostly for tourist purposes.

There are 17 airports officially in the Republic of Macedonia, of which 11 are with solid substrates. Among them are two airports of international character, since they are listed on the airport's [[IATA Airport code]] [[International Airport Skopje]] and [[Ohrid "St. Paul the Apostle" Airport]].

===Tourism===

Altogether, there were 1,842 churches and 580 mosques in the country at the end of 2011.&lt;ref name="dnevnik"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnevnik.com.mk/?ItemID=A080C78F46FF724BB7AA82A63C63251E |title=Во Македонија има 1.842 цркви и 580 џамии |date=28 December 2011 |publisher=Dnevnik |language=Macedonian |accessdate=28 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111014137/http://www.dnevnik.com.mk/?ItemID=A080C78F46FF724BB7AA82A63C63251E |archivedate=11 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Orthodox and Islamic religious communities have secondary religion schools in Skopje. There is an Orthodox [[Seminary|theological college]] in the capital. The Macedonian Orthodox Church has jurisdiction over 10 provinces (seven in the country and three abroad), has 10 bishops and about 350 priests. A total of 30,000 people are baptised in all the provinces every year.

Relations between the Macedonian Orthodox Church, which declared [[autocephaly]] in 1967 and remains unrecognised by the other Orthodox Churches, and the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], which [[Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric|claims ecclesiastical jurisdiction]] over the Republic of Macedonia, remain tense and politically fraught, especially since the Serbian Church appointed [[Jovan Vraniškovski]] as its Exarch for the Archbishopric of Ohrid in September 2002. 
[[File:Македонска ханукија - מקדוני חנוכייה - Macedonian Hanukkah menorah.jpg|thumb|right|A 19th-century Macedonian silver [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|Hanukkah Menorah]]]]

The reaction of the Macedonian Orthodox Church was to cut off all relations with the new Ohrid Archbishopric and to prevent bishops of the Serbian Orthodox Church from entering Macedonia. Bishop Jovan was jailed for 18&amp;nbsp;months for "defaming the Macedonian Orthodox church and harming the religious feelings of local citizens" by distributing Serbian Orthodox church calendars and pamphlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwpr.net/?p=bcr&amp;s=f&amp;o=257037&amp;apc_state=henibcr200508 |title=Church Rivalry Threatens to Brim Over |publisher=Iwpr.net |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Macedonian Greek Catholic Church|Macedonian Byzantine Catholic Church]] has approximately 11,000 adherents in Macedonia. The Church was established in 1918, and is made up mostly of converts to Catholicism and their descendants. The Church is of the [[Byzantine Rite]] and is in communion with the Roman and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]. Its liturgical worship is performed in [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic-hierarchy|country|mk|Macedonia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of|21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a small [[Protestant]] community. The most famous Protestant in the country is the late president [[Boris Trajkovski]]. He was from the [[Methodism|Methodist]] community, which is the largest and oldest Protestant church in the Republic, dating back to the late 19th century. Since the 1980s the Protestant community has grown, partly through new confidence and partly with outside missionary help.

The Macedonian [[Judaism|Jewish community]], which numbered some 7,200 people on the eve of World War II, was almost entirely destroyed during the war: only [[Holocaust Memorial Center for the Jews of Macedonia|2% of Macedonian Jews survived]] the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkanalysis.com/2007/03/14/macedonia%E2%80%99s-jewish-community-commemorates-the-holocaust-and-embraces-the-future/ |title=Blog Archives " Macedonia's Jewish Community Commemorates the Holocaust, and Embraces the Future |publisher=Balkanalysis.com |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After their liberation and the end of the War, most opted to emigrate to [[Israel]]. Today, the country's Jewish community numbers approximately 200 persons, almost all of whom live in Skopje. Most Macedonian Jews are [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]]&amp;nbsp;– the descendants of 15th-century refugees who had been expelled from [[Alhambra Decree|Castile, Aragon]] and [[Persecution of Jews and Muslims by Manuel I of Portugal|Portugal]].

According to the 2002 Census, 46.5% of the children aged 0–4 were Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.gov.mk/publikacii/knigaIX.pdf |title=naslovna-9PUB |format=PDF |accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Makedonija - Jezicki sastav po naseljima 2002.gif|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Linguistic map of Macedonia, 2002 census.]]
The official and most widely spoken language is [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], which belongs to the Eastern branch of the [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic language]] group. In municipalities where ethnic groups are represented with over 20% of the total population, the language of that ethnic group is co-official.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.president.gov.mk/en/about-macedonia/basic-facts.html|title=Basic Facts|author=|date=|work=president.gov.mk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225062506/http://www.president.gov.mk/en/about-macedonia/basic-facts.html|archivedate=25 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macedonian is closely related to and [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with standard [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]. It also has some similarities with standard [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and the intermediate [[Torlak]]ian and [[Shopi|Shop]] dialects spoken mostly in southern Serbia and western Bulgaria (and by speakers in the north and east of Macedonia). The [[standard language]] was [[Codification (linguistics)|codified]] in the period following [[World War II]] and has accumulated a thriving literary tradition. Although it is the only language explicitly designated as an official [[national language]] in the constitution, in municipalities where at least 20% of the population is part of another [[minority group|ethnic minority]], those individual languages are used for official purposes in local government, alongside Macedonian.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

A wide variety of languages are spoken in Macedonia, reflecting its ethnic diversity. Besides the official national language, Macedonian, [[minority language]]s with substantial numbers of speakers are [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Romani language|Romani]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] (including [[Balkan Gagauz Turkish language|Balkan Gagauz]]&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=MK|title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition|last=Gordon|first=Raymond G., Jr. (ed.)|year=2005|publisher=[[SIL International]]|accessdate=3 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Serbian language|Serbian]]/[[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] and [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] (including [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romanian]]).&lt;ref name="United Nations Document"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/0/974c7c980fa0cce7802566870032a38e?Opendocument|title=Core document forming part of the reports of States Parties : The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia|publisher=United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=7 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eurominority"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurominority.eu/version/eng/minority-state2.asp?id_states=28|title=Macedonia ethnic and linguistic minorities|publisher=Eurominority|accessdate=7 November 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130106233113/http://www.eurominority.eu/version/eng/minority-state2.asp?id_states=28|archivedate=6 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurominority.eu/version/maps/map-european-languages.asp|title=Map of the European languages|publisher=Eurominority|accessdate=7 November 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729060330/http://www.eurominority.eu/version/maps/map-european-languages.asp|archivedate=29 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media-2.web.britannica.com/eb-media/83/1983-004-1B1C7082.gif |title=Indo-European languages in contemporary Eurasia |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |accessdate=4 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217180856/http://media-2.web.britannica.com/eb-media/83/1983-004-1B1C7082.gif |archivedate=17 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/european_languages/countries/macedonia.shtml|title=BBC: Languages across Europe&amp;nbsp;– Macedonia|publisher=BBC |accessdate=7 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eupedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eupedia.com/europe/maps_of_europe.shtml#languages|title=Europe languages map|publisher=Eupedia|accessdate=7 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few villages of [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]] speakers and an immigrant [[Greek language|Greek]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ell|title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition|last=Gordon|first=Raymond G., Jr. (ed.)|year=2005|publisher=[[SIL International]]|accessdate=4 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=MK|title=Lewis, M.

[[File:Куќата_на_Робевци_во_целост.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|[[Robevi family house]]&amp;nbsp;– typical Ottoman architecture widespread in  the area.]]

Macedonia has a rich cultural heritage in art, architecture, poetry, and music. It has many ancient, protected religious sites. Poetry, cinema, and music festivals are held annually. [[Music of the Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian music]] styles developed under the strong influence of [[Byzantine music|Byzantine]] church music. Macedonia has a significant number of preserved [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] [[fresco]] paintings, mainly from the period between the 11th and 16th centuries. There are several thousands square metres of [[fresco|fresco painting]] preserved, the major part of which is in very good condition and represent masterworks of the Macedonian School of ecclesiastical painting.

The most important cultural events in the country are the [[Ohrid]] Summer festival of classical music and drama, the [[Struga Poetry Evenings]] which gather poets from more than 50 countries in the world, International Camera Festival in [[Bitola]], Open Youth Theatre and [[Skopje Jazz Festival]] in Skopje etc.
The [[Macedonian Opera]] opened in 1947 with a performance of ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' under the direction of Branko Pomorisac. Every year, the May Opera Evenings are held in Skopje for around 20 nights. The first May Opera performance was that of [[Kiril Makedonski]]'s ''Tsar Samuil'' in May 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.culture.in.mk/story.asp?id=19442&amp;rub=35 |title=Macedonian Opera Marks 60th Anniversary.

Famous for its rich [[Šopska salad]], an appetiser and side dish which accompanies almost every meal, Macedonian cuisine is also noted for the diversity and quality of its [[dairy products]], wines, and local alcoholic beverages, such as [[rakija]]. [[Tavče Gravče]] and [[mastika]] are considered the national dish and drink of the Republic of Macedonia, respectively.

Throughout the past century, the medium of film has depicted the history, culture and everyday life of the Macedonian people. Over the years many Macedonian films have been presented at film festivals around the world and several of these films have won prestigious awards. The first Macedonian feature film was ''Frosina'', released in 1952. The first feature film in colour was ''Miss Stone'', a movie about a [[Protestant]] missionary in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. It was released in 1958. The highest grossing feature film in the Republic of Macedonia was ''[[Bal-Can-Can]]'', having been seen by over 500,000 people in its first year alone.

{{confuse|SS Malakand (1905)}}

|}'''SS ''Malakand''''' was a [[cargo liner]] built in 1919 for the [[Brocklebank Line]]. She was the second Brocklebank Line ship named 'after the [[Malakand Agency|Malakand]] area of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. 

During [[World War II]], ''Malakand'' was loaded with munitions at the [[Huskisson Dock]] in [[Liverpool]], [[England]], on the evening of 3 May 1941 during a heavy German air raid – a part of the "[[Liverpool Blitz]]" – when flames from dock sheds that had been bombed spread to her. The fire services could not contain the fire and on 4 May 1941, a few hours after the raid had ended, ''Malakand'' exploded, destroying the entire Huskisson No. 2 dock and killing four people. It took seventy-four hours for the fire to burn out.&lt;ref name=merseygatewaycon&gt;

Although the ''Malakand'' explosion is often attributed to a burning [[barrage balloon]], the fire the balloon started was put out before it could affect the ship.&lt;ref name=merseygatewaycon/&gt;

'''Slobodná Európa''' (translates to Free Europe) is a [[Slovakia|Slovak]] [[punk-rock]] music group formed in 1989.

== History ==
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slobodnaeuropa.sk/content/8-biografia&lt;/ref&gt;

The band was formed by Braňo Alex ([[bass guitar|bass]]) (ex-member of Zóna A), Sveto Korbel ([[guitar]]) (also an ex-member of Zóna A, left in early 1988), Ozi (real name Peter Hurtig, [[drum kit|drums]])(ex-member of Zóna A) and [[singing|vocalist]] Whisky (real name Milo Láber). In 1991 they released the first album ''Pakáreň'' through Opus Records. Ozi leaves the band after the release and is replaced by Juraj Černý, at that time also a member of [[hard rock]]/[[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Tublatanka]], who played drums on two tracks from Pakáreň. Shortly afterwards the band adds secondary drummer Čunďo (Roman Čunderlík) who variously switches places with Černý until 1994. Band members took hard drugs (heroin with methamphetamine) that would influence their darker second album ''Unavení a zničení'' (trans. Tired and Broken) but eventually also almost destroy their lives. Due to various problems the band went on hiatus in 1995.

Slobodná Európa reformed in 2002 when Whisky married Dorota Nvotová. Černý, who was a part of the reunion is soon replaced by Tuleň (Tomáš Vojtek) and the band records their new album ''Trojka''. In 2004 the band adds new guitarist Temo (Braňo Černák) who also fills in for Korbel during latter's personal hiatus from the band between 2004 and 2006. Tuleň left in 2006 and was replaced by Juraj Vitez. In 2011 Černý returned to the band. Alex was dropped from the line-up in 2012 due to health reasons and drug addiction and was replaced by Žumo. This line-up recorded and released fourth album ''Štvorka'' in 2014.

The '''Union of Djibouti Workers''' (UDT) is a [[trade union]] centre in [[Djibouti]]. It was founded in 1992, and is affiliated with the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITUC).

==Government/union conflict==
ICTUR reports ongoing harassment and police violence against union activities in Djibouti.{{Ref|ICTUR}}

Harowo.com reported the arrest of two members of the UDT on March 11, 2006. General secretary [[Aden Mohamed Abdou]], and Hassan Cher Hared, International Relations Secretary, were arrested and
&lt;blockquote&gt;taken to the premises of the Criminal Brigade without being presented with any form of warrant. According to the information received, the two trade union leaders were brought before an examining magistrate for questioning, charged with “supplying information to a foreign power” (Articles 137 and 139 of Djibouti’s Penal Code) and then committed to the civil prison of Gabode. They have not had access to a lawyer or a doctor.{{Ref|Harowo}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

ICFTU reported on the arrest of two union leaders on February 20, 2006.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Mohamed Ahmed Mohamed, the Legal Affairs Officer of the Union of Port Workers which is a member of an ICFTU affiliate, the Union Djiboutienne du Travail (UDT), and Djibril Ismael Egueh, the General Secretary of MTS, which is also an ICFTU affiliate, were arrested on 20 February. They were both on their way back from a training session on rural cooperatives organised and delivered by the International Institute of Histadrut, the ICFTU’s affiliate in Israel.{{Ref|ICFTU}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
